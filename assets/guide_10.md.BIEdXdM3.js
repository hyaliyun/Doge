Zara belongs to a lower-middle-class family while Maleeha comes from an upper class household. Yet their class difference did not threaten their unbreakable bond. Maleeha had been there for her friend through many hardships, but she never really felt the extent of anguish which plagued Zara's life. The great blow to their friendship comes when Maleeha's elder brother Junaid (Adeel Hussain), shows his interest in marrying Zara. Their parents have no objection to the union, but it comes as ashock to Maleeha. She thought that Zara was trapping her brother who is eligible in all means to live a better life. Maleeha's cousin Fiza (Sanam Saeed), who is also Zara and Maleeha's class fellow, starts manipulating her against Zara. Meanwhile, Zara's family found the perfect suitor for her older sister Aasma (Nimra Bucha) whose marriage was a reason of depression for anyone. She promises Junaid that his family can approach hers with their proposal after her sister's marriage. But things didn't go as planned. Zara's father got imprisoned for deceit in a business scheme he was involved in. Her family needed to accumulate a large amount to pay for his bail, which they couldn't afford. Zara asks Maleeha for help, but Maleeha makes a bargain with her. She decided to give Zara the money only if she breaks things up with Junaid. Insulted, disdained and helpless, Zara agrees and gives Maleeha the pendant Junaid gifted to her as a token of his love. Junaid's family later approaches Zara, but she turns them down by saying that she is committed to one of her cousins. Meanwhile, Fiza starts to develop feelings for Junaid. When Junaid refuses, Fiza made life miserable for Maleeha and her husband Yasir (Fiasal Shah) who is also Fiza's brother. Zara in the meanwhile receives a 100% scholarship, and shifts to Glasgow for her further education. Moving to UK after a short period of time, Zara returns Maleeha every single penny which Maleeha had spent on her ever in the seven years of their friendship. Seven years later, a professionally successful Zara reconnects with Junaid who is unhappily married to Fiza. Junaid discovers that Zara lied of her engagement, and was single all along. He confronts Maleeha and decides to divorce Fiza. Yasir threatens Maleeha of their own divorce if her Junaid abandons Fiza. Maleeha visits Zara to apologize for what she made her do. Zara who had no intentions of marrying Junaid tells Maleeha how deeply she loved him, and how unfair Maleeha had been. Maleeha regrets her awful behavior and realizes that she had lost two important people of her life. Thus she tells Junaid the truth and leaves Yasir on her own. Zara moves back to UK rejecting Junaid but saying it would be impossible for her to forget the memories which she made with him. A year later, Maleeha calls a happily married Zara to wish her birthday. When her husband (Humayun Saeed) asks who the caller was, Zara talks of her as an old class mate and not her once best friend symbolizing she had moved on for better.

It takes place in Roman Britain and tells the tale of an orphaned Roman child who is shipwrecked on a coast of Dumnonia in Celtic Britain, outside of Roman rule. He is adopted by a childless couple, grows up within the tribe, eventually leaving to rejoin Roman society, and being carried along by a chain of events all the way to Rome and ultimately back to Britain. Like many Sutcliff novels, the plot is driven by the protagonist's search for identity amidst several cultures in which he feels himself to be an outcast. Plot summary The story is about a boy named Beric, who is raised amongst the Dumnonii. After coming of age, his status within their culture comes under pressure, shown in a conflict between the acceptance of the village Bard and the condemnation on religious grounds by the village Druid. After a bad harvest is linked to his presence, the superstitious views of the Druid win out, and Beric is exiled from the tribe. He journeys to Isca Dumnoniorum, where he falls afoul of a Greek slave trader, who tricks Beric and takes him as a slave. He is ultimately purchased by Publius Pio, a Roman Magistrate, and becomes part of Pio's patrician household on the Viminal Hill. Beric antagonizes Glaucus, son of Publius Pio, embarrassing Glaucus at a dinner celebrating Pio's election to the office of Aedile. This scene is witnessed by Centurion Justinius, and results in Beric being condemned to work in the salt mines, a certain slow and painful death. Beric makes his escape from Pio's household, hiding in a disused temple of Sylvan Pan, and making his way north on the Via Flaminia, hoping to walk back to Britain. He is caught in the Roman countryside, condemned as a bandit, and sentenced to live out his life as a galley slave. He works in the Rhenus Fleet, stationed in Colonia Agrippina, living many years on the galley Alcestis. His galley is eventually sent to Britain, surviving a great storm, during which Beric is thrown overboard for dead. Beric washes ashore for the second time in his life, this time to be rescued by the Roman British household of the centurion Justinius, who had returned to his duty station after his leave in Rome. Beric now joins in the work on the Rhee Wall of Romney Marsh, where the Romans led by Justinius are working reclaim land from the sea. The progress of the Rhee Wall and the lives of the workers are threatened by a great storm, during which Beric bonds with his new comrades, and after which he concludes that he has finally found a place and a people where he belongs. Like in many Sutcliff novels, the theme of Outcast revolves around Beric's struggle to find belonging as he is caught in various degrees of acceptance and descrimination by the various societies through which he travels. Another theme common to other Sutcliff novels is the Celtic native hound strongly featured in Outcast; Beric's progress is paralleled by renouncing his native dog in the beginning of the novel, later adopting a mixed-breed dog near the Roman camp by the Rhee wall, and ultimately having his breakthrough moment of feeling accepted when the second dog drops her newborn pup on his feet.

He was also a cousin of the First Lady, Edith Roosevelt.\\"President Weeding Out His Relatives,\\" Boston Sunday Post, 28 May 1905, p. 22. An avid amateur boxer, and a sparring partner for Roosevelt, he struck the President in the eye, causing him to lose much of the sight of that eye. Early life Moore was born in Montgomery, Alabama, on February 9, 1877. He came from a family with a strong military heritage, and was the great-great-nephew of Aaron Burr. He grew up in Hanover, Germany, and was educated in Switzerland. In 1898, he graduated from the Eidgen√∂ssische Polytechnische Schule in Zurich, two classes ahead of Albert Einstein. Moore returned to the United States just before the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and was commissioned in the 15th Infantry. He served in Cuba from 1899 until 1901, then transferred to the artillery and served in the Philippines from 1902 until 1904. In 1904, he was made a military aide to President Roosevelt. While serving in that capacity, he served as a sparring partner for Roosevelt, who was an enthusiastic amateur boxer. While boxing with the President, Moore struck Roosevelt so hard in the eye that the President lost sight in it. Moore did not learn of the result of the blow until 1917, and only from reading Roosevelt's statement of how he came to lose sight in that eye, in which Roosevelt did not name Moore, but Moore realized that only he fit the description. (fee for article) Moore stated, \\"But could you ask for any better proof of the man's sportsmanship than the fact that he never told me what I had done to him?\\" Military pioneer In 1907, the Artillery was divided, with separate divisions to deal with field artillery, and shore artillery. Moore remained with the \\"Redlegs\\", as the field artillery was known. At the time, only Germany had a workable system of indirect fire (how guns may be trained on a target that cannot be seen. Roosevelt wrote to Kaiser Wilhelm II, calling Moore \\"my young cousin\\" and secured his admission to the German artillery school, the first foreigner to attend. Moore spent much of 1909 and 1910 at the school, and was careful to appear to be a lazy but amiable officer, while soaking up all the knowledge he could. He returned to the United States in April 1910, prolonging his stay in Europe for six weeks so he would qualify as a non-resident for customs fees. (fee for article) Following his return to the United States, in 1911, Captain Moore was sent to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where he was to found the U.S. Army School of Fire (today the Field Artillery School). He was given complete authority to design the training of Army privates, non-commissioned officers, and officers at the school, which was initially run on a shoestring. He remained at the school until late 1914. He was then sent to Washington, where he joined the staff of the Army War College. His houseguest there was Franz von Papen, later Chancellor of Germany during the Weimar Republic (and Vice Chancellor briefly under Hitler)‚Äîvon Papen had been Moore's roommate in Germany. Unbeknownst to Moore, von Papen was running a spy ring out of Moore's house, for which the German was later expelled from the United States. In World War I, Moore, by now a Lieutenant Colonel, commanded a field artillery brigade. Upon his return to the United States in 1919, he resigned from active duty, though he maintained a reserve commission until his 1941 death. Personal life In 1906 Moore married Luvie Jones Butler. After Butler's death in 1915, Moore married Maria Christina Crespi the following year. His children include author Dan Tyler Moore Jr., and four daughters, including Luvie Moore Abell, wife of Washington Post columnist Drew Pearson. He is buried in the National Cemetery at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.

Club career =NK Zagreb= A product of NK Zagreb academy, Paliƒá, after turning professional in July 2007 was sent on loan to third division side NK Luƒçko where he spent his first senior season. At the end of 2007‚Äì08 season Paliƒá returned to NK Zagreb just to be immediately released on free transfer in the summer transfer period, without ever appearing in a single official senior match for NK Zagreb. Release was never explained by Zagreb officials even though Paliƒá was at the time on a wider list of Croatia national under-20 football team. =First Division Clubs= In July 2008 Paliƒá went on to join NK Croatia Sesvete signing his first professional contract. In a season and half long stay at Croatia Sesvete he made 31 league appearances, adding two more in Croatian Cup competition. He scored only three league goals of which one was particularly valuable, achieved against major Croatian team Hajduk Split on 5 October 2008 at Kranjƒçeviƒáeva. An early opening goal in the end proved to be the only and crucial one in 1‚Äì0 win, resulting in first-ever club victory over Hajduk. In December 2009 club management made a strange move at the time, placing him on transfer list for opening winter transfer window. Especially surprising was timing of decision from the club as Paliƒá was in process of recovery from an injury and was a regular member of Croatia national under-21 football team. Reason was proved later on to be due to the major financial trouble club was going on, finally leading to dissolving the club in 2012 due to financial irregularities. Croatia Sesvete continued to write off players. At the end Paliƒá terminated contract with Croatia on mutual agreement together with his teammates Marijo Jurin and Matija Katanec.

The Risk Management Framework is a United States federal government policy and standards to help secure information systems (computers and networks) developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology. The two main publications that cover the details of RMF are NIST Special Publication 800-37, \\"Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems\\", and NIST Special Publication 800-53, \\"Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations\\". NIST Special Publication 800-37, \\"Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems\\", developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative Working Group, transforms the traditional Certification and Accreditation (C&A;) process into the six-step Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Risk Management Framework (RMF), illustrated at right, provides a disciplined and structured process that integrates information security and risk management activities into the system development life cycle.Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems The RMF steps include: * Categorize the information system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by that system based on an impact analysis. Vested party is identified. * Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the information system based on the security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline as needed based on an organizational assessment of risk and local conditions. If any overlays apply to the system it will be added in this step * Implement the security controls identified in step 2. * Assess: a third party assesses the controls and verifies that the controls are properly applied to the system. * Authorize: the information system is granted or denied an Authorization to Operate (ATO), in some cases it may be postponed while certain items are fixed. The ATO is based on the report from the Assessment phase. * Monitor: the security controls in the information system are monitored in a pre-planned fashion documented earlier in the process. ATO is good for 3 years, every 3 years the process needs to be repeated. Risks During its lifecycle, an information system will encounter many types of risk that affect the overall security posture of the system and the security controls that must be implemented. The RMF process supports early detection and resolution of risks. Risk can be categorized at high level as infrastructure risks, project risks, application risks, information asset risks, business continuity risks, outsourcing risks, external risks and strategic risks. Infrastructure risks focus on the reliability of computers and networking equipment. Project risks focus on budget, timeline and system quality. Application risks focus on performance and overall system capacity. Information asset risks focus on the damage, loss or disclosure to an unauthorized part of information assets. Business continuity risks focus on maintaining a reliable system with maximum up-time. Outsourcing risks focus on the impact of 3rd party supplier meeting their requirements.

The Garden Theatre, which hosts over 200 events a season, including professional level theatre, music, dance, and films. The Garden Theatre serves as the primary performing arts center for the Winter Garden area. History The theatre first opened in December 1935 as a single screen cinema and was the first in Central Florida built for \\"talkies\\" . Several renovations changed the face of the theatre until it closed in 1963, as movie attendance declined in the new age of television. Soon after, the site became a farming supply store, where the interior seating was removed and the sloped floor was filled and leveled with cement. In 2002 the City of Winter Garden purchased the site and the Winter Garden Heritage Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, began restoration of the theatre. Theater architecture The Winter Garden Heritage Foundation acquired the building January 1, 2004 through an operating agreement with the City of Winter Garden. The warmly-lit interior of the 299-seat theatre has Mediterranean revival architecture with a Spanish tile courtyard, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" balconies, and lanterns in the windows over the proscenium arch with palm trees decorating either side of it . The theatre newly features a 12‚Äô X 24‚Äô screen with a digital projector and a full-service box office and concession stand. The ceiling of the theatre was dark blue, resplendent with stars. In 2008, the Winter Garden Heritage Foundation completed the restoration of the Garden Theatre. Restoration brought the Garden Theatre back to its original architectural simplicity, in keeping with the character and revitalization of historic downtown Winter Garden, making the building an authentic period piece. The Garden Theatre also hosts well presented plays each summer for teens and children. In 2012, they put on Oliver!, which was later reviewed as a hit. The theatre has become the heartbeat of the city as a performing arts center, movie theatre and multi-purpose venue.

According to the legend, the son of Zanahary descended to Earth at a location named Anerinerina (north of Angavokely) ‚Äì source of the sovereign's Earthly name ‚Äì to play with the Vazimba, the reportedly primitive original inhabitants of Madagascar. The Vazimba were specifically warned not to cook Andrianerinerina's sheep because he couldn't consume their flesh, but one was nonetheless butchered and cooked in a stew that was served to him. By unwittingly eating the forbidden mutton, Andrianerinerina was no longer able to return to the heavens to rejoin his father.

An exemplar of modernist architecture, the building includes louvers similar to the Kaufmann Desert House. Additionally, the screen to the right of the louvres was a feature by sculptor Malcolm Leland to incorporate ornamentation into modernist buildings.County Collection, Hall of Records. LA County Arts Commission The previous Hall of Records was immediately south of the current one, built in 1911 and demolished in 1973. Description The Hall of Records was estimated to cost $13.7 million in 1961. Counter proposals were made by the Los Angeles County Chief Administrative Officer to preserve the old Hall of Records and move it to the Temple Street location, however, it was estimated that the cost of moving the building would be prohibitively high--$1.5 million to move, and much more to renovate.\\"Plan to Move Hall of Records 50ft., Twist it Around, Studied.\\" Los Angeles Times, June 9, 1961. B1 Originally envisioned as two separate buildings, one for storing records and the other for workers,\\"Permit Issued for New Hall of Records\\" Los Angeles Times, July 31, 1958. B1 Neutra and Alexander combined the buildings into one. The T-shaped building has odd number floors on the north side, with double high ceilings and tall windows. The records block on the south side, has floors at 8-ft intervals. Currently, no vital records accessible to the public are in the building, and the windowless south records block designed for storage has been converted to office cubicles. In 1991, the County Recorder's office moved to Norwalk following merging the office with the County Registrar and County Clerk by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.http://www.huttoncompanies.com/historical/pdfs/County%20Purchase%20of%20Hutton%20Development%20Building%20Seen%20as%20Economic%20Boost%20-%20LA%20Times%20(10-31-91).pdf The Hall of Records houses offices for the Alternative Public Defender, Probation Department, Regional Planning, Sheriff's Department, and the Los Angeles County District Attorney. The Los Angeles County archives are below the building, and there are publicly accessible tunnels to the Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration. There are terraces on the 13th and 15th floors, and at ground level. The upper terraces were designed for a dining room and lounge with panoramic views of downtown.\\"Permit Issued for New Hall of Records\\" Los Angeles Times, July 31, 1958.

Section F, Page 1. The building was designed to be energy efficient, with large aluminum louvers on the south face running the height of the building. Originally, they turned with the angle of the sun throughout the day to allow more indirect light into the building. No longer operable, they are now locked in one position. The Temple Street side of the building features a Mosaic Mural titled Topographical Map of Water Sources in County of Los Angeles by Joseph Young (artist). The mural and reflecting pool were restored in 2007, and again in 2017.

Banham concludes his thoughts on downtown with the following, placed below an image of the Hall of Administration: \\"They are, frankly, a gutless‚Äìlooking collection but not gracious with it; they are neither tough-minded nor sensitive, nor architectural monuments, nor Pop extravaganzas.

He was professed in 1917, and then studied at the seminary of St. Anthony's on the Hudson in Rensselaer, NY, where he completed his theological training. He was ordained to the priesthood on August 22, 1920, by Bishop Edmund Gibbons. In 1938 Father Grassmann founded the Fonda Memorial of Catherine Tekakwitha near Fonda, New York.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press.

He came from a family of artisans. He was the older brother of Pierre Mignard, who became one of the leading French painters of the 17th century and a rival of Charles Le Brun.Albert Babeau, Nicolas Mignard - sa vie et ses oeuvres in: 'Annuaire administratif et statistique du d√©partement de l'Aube... / publi√© sous les auspices et la direction de la Soci√©t√© d'agriculture, sciences, arts et belles-lettres du d√©partement', Soci√©t√© acad√©mique de l'Aube, 1895, p. 113-124 Venus and Adonis, c.1650 Nicolas Mignard studied painting with a local master of Troyes whose identity is unknown. He travelled subsequently to Fontainebleau where he copied the works of the Mannerist painters. He likely also spent time in Paris where he is believed to have studied with Simon Vouet. Mignard then spent some time in Lyon before moving to Avignon around 1633. He then traveled to Rome in the retinue of Alphonse-Louis du Plessis, the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyon and brother of Cardinal Richelieu. Mignard came back to Avignon in 1636, after having executed several series of etchings in Rome, principally after the works of Annibale Carracci. In Avignon he mostly painted for religious institutions as well as decorations for opulent residences. He married Marguerite d'Avril. Their son Paul Mignard became a painter and etcher and their son Pierre II Mignard a painter and architect. When King Louis XIV and his Court visited Avignon on their way to the King's wedding with Maria Theresa of Spain, Mignard was commissioned to paint portraits of various courtiers including Cardinal Mazarin. Mazarin ordered Mignard by lettre de cachet to come to Paris in 1660. Mignard joined the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in 1663 without having to submit an admission piece. He became Professor and Assistant Rector of the Acad√©mie in 1664 and Rector in 1666. He was a supporter of Charles Le Brun in his conflict with his own brother Pierre. He and later his son Paul would be on poor terms with Pierre over this conflict of Pierre with Le Brun. Nicolas Mignard died on 20 March 1668 in Paris. Work Moli√®re in the role of Julius Caesar, 1656 Mignard painted history scenes as well as portraits. As he spent most of his life in Avignon he was somewhat overshadowed by his younger brother Pierre, who had made a career in Paris. After his death, paintings by Nicolas Mignard mostly stayed in Avignon or in small cities around Avignon. During the French Revolution, many paintings were expropriated from their owners. Many of the works of Nicolas that were thus confiscated were subsequently erroneously attributed to his brother Pierre.Anthony Blunt, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 121, No. 918 (Sep., 1979), pp. 603‚Äì605+607 His earliest work showed the influence of the Mannerists working in Fontainebleau and of Carracci. Later his style followed the Italianate classicizing aesthetic that dominated seventeenth-century France, and was very much influenced by the French classical Baroque painter Charles Le Brun.

He was born on 27 November 1920 in Castleton, Monmouthshire, and his family later moved to Lancashire. He joined the army (Royal Engineers) in 1941 and served as an officer in India, Burma, Malaya and Singapore. He married Norah Fallon in Singapore in July 1947. After a number of postings, including witnessing an atomic bomb test at Maralinga, Australia, where he suffered a heart attack at the age of 35, he settled in Netheravon, Wiltshire in 1958 and retired from the army in 1965. Kite gained a wide affection and audience among television viewers in the 1960s as the presenter of Kite's Country on Southern TV, gently displaying his skills as a fly fisherman and his keen naturalist's eye for the wildlife of Wiltshire and Hampshire, each weekly episode being narrated in his lilting Welsh accent with considerable charm and expert knowledge. Known for his simple fishing style, extraordinarily keen vision and his invention of several enduringly successful fly patterns including Kite's Imperial, his many friends locally were augmented by admirers in France, Norway and across the UK. Kite popularised to a wide audience the Netheravon style of nymph fishing invented by Frank Sawyer, the Avon riverkeeper and author and also resident in Netheravon, to whom he gave full credit in his book Nymph Fishing in Practice, first published in 1963. Kite went on to co-host a program with Jack Hargreaves, also on Southern Television, called Country Boy: the idea being to teach a young boy from the city the ways of country life; each week this young person would be introduced to another new experience living in the country such as fishing. Kite died of a second heart attack on the banks of the River Test in 1968, at the age of 48.

Manchester University Press, 1928. https://archive.org/stream/lemystredadama00stud#page/n25/mode/2up It is a dramatic representation of the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve, the story of Cain and Abel, and a series of prophets including Isaiah and Daniel. It is part of the medieval tradition of mystery plays, which developed from dramatic elements in the celebration of Mass, and includes choral music. The opening statement of the piece describes part of the set: :Let paradise be constructed in a prominently high place [constituatus paradisus loco eminentori]; let curtain and silken hangings be placed around it at such a height that those persons who will be in paradise can be seen from the shoulders upwards; let sweet-smelling flowers and foliage be planted; within let there be various trees, and fruits hanging on them, so that the place may seem as delightful as possible [ut amoenissimus locus videatur]. The play was to be presented outside the church, possibly with Paradise being located at the top of the stairs to the west door, such that the church doors would stand in for the gates of Heaven. The author of this play is unknown, although we can assume from his knowledge of Latin that he was in a religious position.  Modern performances  The 2009 English translation of the play by Carol Symes in The Broadview Anthology of British Literature was staged at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Cloisters Museum in New York City in December 2016. That production, directed by Kyle A. Thomas, also traveled to the campus of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign where it was filmed and made publicly available.

Summary  One of Harding's Pleasure & Profit Books. A collection of real life outdoor stories based on the experiences of the author, Eldred Nathaniel Woodcock. Writing from memory, Mr. Woodcock tells of incidents that happened during the fifty years (1855‚Äì1905) he spent camping, hunting, trapping and fishing in the wilderness of Northern Pennsylvania and several other states. Most of E. N. Woodcock's stories feature an interesting partner (who he sometimes refers to as \\"Pard\\"), and other local people who lived in the Potter County, Pennsylvania area. Many of the wild places where he made his camps are now State Parks and Forests. E. N. Woodcock tells his stories in plain language, about deer and bear hunting; trapping bear, wild cat, fox, marten, mink and muskrat; run-ins with porcupines and skunks; mishaps that happened to himself and his partners; and the everyday occurrences of camp life. He gives his opinion of state game laws and bounties, and his views on the need for conservation. The book also includes practical information on building cabins, camp fires and cooking, staying warm, finding bee hives, trap sets, building deadfalls, using baits, skinning, stretching and drying fur, tracking game, and types of guns and ammunition.Woodcock, E.

Setting This ecoregion consists of a long range of high rocky mountains of the Alaska Interior running north from the bottom of the Alaska Peninsula, eastwards taking in the Alaska Range and southwards to include the Wrangell and St. Elias Mountains in eastern Alaska on the Canada‚ÄìUS border as far as Yakutat Bay. Across in Canada, the ecoregion includes the southwestern corner of the Yukon Territory and the northwestern corner of British Columbia. These mountains are largely covered with permanent ice and snow, with permanent snow above about 2150 m, and are separated by valleys filled with ice fields and great glaciers. There are small patches that are not under ice and consist of rock, rubble and alpine tundra. Elevations of the ecoregion range from sea level (on the western coast) to 600 m in the valleys, to peaks over 4,000 m. Indeed, Denali (Mount McKinley), the highest peak in North America at 6,100 m, is located here, while the St Elias Mountains reach as high as 6000 m and are some of the highest peaks in Canada. This ecoregion is largely separated from the coast by the Pacific coastal mountain icefields and tundra so the climate is continental. Rainfall varies from 200 mm per year on the higher slopes to 400 mm per year in the lower areas. Flora Permafrost is everywhere on the higher slopes but there are patches of alpine tundra plant life at lower elevations, including mountain avens (Dryas octopetala) and Ericas such as Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Cassiope tetragona. Fauna Animals of the area include large brown bears of Denali National Park and the southwestern coast near Iliamna Lake and Kamishak Bay. Other mammals include mountain goat, caribou, moose, Dall sheep, North American beaver and snowshoe hare. The rivers of the area are home to salmon. Birds include willow grouse, Siberian tit, wheatear, Wilson's warbler and boreal chickadee. Threats and preservation This is a largely unspoilt environment home to large predators, although there is some development associated with tourism, especially at Kantishna near Denali Park, and some mining activity including the abandoned copper mining camp of Kennecott, Alaska in the Wrangell Mountains and coal mining at Nabesna and Healy, Alaska. Protected areas include Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Denali National Park, the adjacent Denali State Park, Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge and the Wrangell-St. Elias Park and Preserve, all in Alaska, and parts of Tatshenshini‚ÄìAlsek Provincial Park and Kluane National Park and Reserve in Canada.

The project prototype was originally designed and implemented in Rotorua, New Zealand as a leisure attraction. In September, 2010, a proposal for development of an expanded network was chosen to receive funding from Google as part of project 10100. As of August 2017, there are no active proposals to utilise the system for public transportation although a \\"sport resort\\" in the United States is considering it. The original track in New Zealand is open to the public. The proposed Shweeb transit network relies on recumbent bicycle technology to power pods suspended from monorails. According to Shweeb Monorail Technology, the intent of their proposal is to \\"create a solution which provided the user with the same flexibility and comfort offered by the car but without the consequential costs - both direct financial and indirect health and environmental costs.\\" The proposal envisions networks of monorail track providing point to point and commuter transit for urban areas. Technical =Track= The track is built in folded galvanised steel. Its external height and width is . Support piles are also in galvanised steel. =Pods= Pods are covered with transparent plastic sheets, with ventilation holes. Front and rear long dampers are provided to limit the impact acceleration in case of pods collision and to ease the association of pods to build 'pod trains' which could significantly improve overall aerodynamic efficiency. =External power boost= To help climb ramps, an electrically powered chain installed on a track section could push the pods for a limited distance, in a way similar to the Trampe bicycle lift. This could also help entering stations built at a higher elevation than the track. The purpose of this elevation is to help a pod gaining momentum while descending from station track to the main line track.

This museum is dedicated to Brighton's fishing and seaside history. It is located a short distance to the west of Brighton Pier within an area known as the Fishing Quarter, occupying two of the arches on the Kings' Road, which runs along Brighton's beachfront. Admission is free and donations appreciated. The history, traditions and practices of the fishing community are shared by a mix of images, artifacts and fishing boats. Archive and contemporary film, a slide show and a tape of fishing families talking and singing depict Brighton and the sea fishing industry from the 1800s to the 1990s. Historical and technical research underpins the renovation of vernacular Sussex beach boats and marine engines. Works are carried out on the hard in front of the museum's workshop and the restored fishing and pleasure boats are drawn up on the hard and beach. Model boats are also displayed inside the museum. Tradition and free public entertainments are combined in the Annual Brighton Mackerel Fair organised by the museum and the fishing community, every May. There has been a fishing industry on the Brighton beach for over one thousand years, the seafront arches in the fishing quarter have been in continuous use by the fishing community since they were built in the 1860s. In earlier times there were wooden netshops and rope houses on the beach below a natural cliff. Capstans were used to haul up boats that were then ranged along the beach in front of the arches and workshops. Nets were spread out to dry on the beach or upon the railings of the esplanade. When Brighton became a fashionable seaside resort some of the fishing families adapted themselves to the leisure trade, operating bathing machines and pleasure boats for the visitors. The museum as an area devoted to two of Brighton's folk heroes: Martha Gunn the famous ‚ÄòDipper,‚Äô or bathing woman, and ‚ÄòCaptain‚Äô Fred Collins of the Skylark pleasure boat. The museum is filled with images of Brighton in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century when the fishing industry was based in both town and beach. Following conflicts with fashionable Brighton in the early nineteenth century the fishery was confined to the beach. The museum illustrates the evolution of the beach and arches and also the types of fishing boat worked off Brighton beach. A scale model of the classic Brighton hog-boat is displayed at the back of the museum. The 27 ft lugger Sussex Maid, inside the museum, represents a 1920s Brighton beach fishing boat with an auxiliary motor. Towards the back of the arch are areas devoted to the history of Brighton's lifeboats, pleasure boats and fish market. The Brighton Fish Market was originally held on the beach but a new purpose-built fish market was provided in arches to the east of the museum in 1867. Fish were landed at Brighton by boats from all around the south east coast of England and also brought in by rail from as far afield as Cornwall. The fish market was closed in 1960 and Brighton fishermen now sell their catch at Shoreham-by-Sea. At the front of the museum is an area devoted to the popular culture and dress of the fishing community. This highlights some traditional fishing and pleasure boat names and shows example of souvenirs - some brought home by fishermen, others made by fishermen for sale to holidaymakers. Images of costume illustrate both the variety of occupations and the social hierarchy of the beach. The danger of fishing, mortality and religion are an important theme: the museum arch was once base of St. Margaret's Mission and the Brighton Sailor and Fisherman's Home founded in 1860. On the outside wall of the arch is a memorial plaque to Sean Tierney, a Brighton fisherman lost at sea in 1994. Inside the museum, by the bow of Sussex Maid is a display dedicated to the Brighton fishermen and boatmen who took part in the heroic evacuation of Dunkirk and St. Valery in the Second World War. Altogether 26 Brighton boats took part, two were sunk and two men were awarded medals for bravery.

A judicial enquiry by a Supreme Court Judge determined that the crash was caused by errors in radio navigation equipment used by the pilot to navigate the route from Brisbane to Sydney. One of the passengers was Margaret McIntyre, the first woman elected to the Parliament of Tasmania. Flight On 2 September 1948, the Lutana departed Brisbane's airport on a scheduled flight to Sydney. About 280 nautical miles (520 km) south of Brisbane it crashed into rising terrain in the North West Slopes of Australia's Great Dividing Range, due to an erroneously determined position based on errors in the navigational equipment the pilots relied upon for determining a safe course through the rising terrain.\\"AIRLINER FROM BRISBANE MISSING\\" The Sydney Morning Herald ‚Äì 3 September 1948, p.1 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 6 July 2015\\"Court Says Directional Aids Misled Lutana's Pilot\\" The Argus ‚Äì 25 November 1948, p.7 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 6 July 2015 Inquiry An Air Court of Inquiry was conducted by Judge William Simpson of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, and two assessors, E. J. Bowen, Sci. D, PhD; and Captain L. M. Diprose, chief pilot of Associated Airlines, nominated by the Australian Pilots Association. The inquiry report, released 17 November 1948, found the pilot, Captain J. A. Drummond, to be a \\"pilot of more than ordinary ability,\\" and led to a reorganisation of the Department's system of air traffic control. The inquiry found that the probable cause of the crash was interference with the aeroplane's magnetic compass due to a nearby electrical storm and a temporary defect in the navigational signals sent by the Government-maintained Kempsey low-frequency radio range station, an important navigational aid to flights in the area. The inquiry also identified errors and deficiencies in the aeronautical charts used to navigate the mountainous area. Australia's then Air Minister, Arthur Drakeford, objected to the findings of the inquiry, stating that the lack of definitive evidence in the report rendered its findings \\"inconclusive,\\" and that the assertion that the Kempsey range station malfunctioned temporarily was \\"difficult to believe.\\" See also  References Bibliography * Fyshwick, Australia. pp. 200\\\\.

Not long thereafter, the town established a militia, then known as a \\"traine band\\". The date of establishment of the militia is not known, but records of assemblies date to 1673. The Grand Committee of the Militia met in Hartford on August 11, 1673 to organize militia against a potential attack by the enemy. The Committee ordered the raising of 500 \\"dragoones\\" from the state, of which 160 were to come from Hartford County. At that meeting, Simon Wolcott and John Griffin of Simsbury were appointed to command the Simsbury Traine Band, which at that time numbered seven \\"dragoones\\". The Committee included the following order: Two years later, John Griffin was confirmed as sergeant of the Traine Band and placed in command. First home and first ferry The first home in Simsbury was located in the Terry's Plain area. The land where the house would be built was granted in 1653 to Thomas Ford, although a house would not be built until approximately 1660, when Captain Aaron Cook, the son-in-law of Thomas Ford, built the first home in Simsbury. In the same general area, a ferry was established to facilitate crossing of the Farmington River. The exact date of the origin of the Pent Street Ferry is not known, but a road to the ferry was commissioned in 1668.

It is also the usual ƒÄqƒÅz. # The 7th above the finalis is a semi-tone flatter than its lower octave, the 2nd below. # Leaps of thirds both ascending and descending are common. # Ascending leaps of perfect fourths are occasionally used. A leap of perfect fifth from the finalis to the 5th above is rarely used. The use of such leaps makes MƒÅhur capable of greater excitement than most other Persian modes. But, the melodic movement is still predominantly step-wise. Forud In DastgƒÅh-e MƒÅhur, because of its many diverse Gu≈°es, the role of the Forud is very significant in binding the whole repertoire together. In the Forud, the 3rd and the 2nd below receive emphasis, and usually the finalis is approached from below. The following score is a typical Forud of MƒÅhur, transcribed here in MƒÅhur C : :: 590px () The finalis may be approached from above. This type, as shown in the next score, is less typical and gives no emphasis to the tetrachord below the finalis: :: 500px () A third type of Forud, given in the following score emphasis the four notes above and below the finalis: :: 460px () DarƒÅmad An authentic style of performance in DastgƒÅh-e MƒÅhur customarily begins with an improvisation under the name of Moqaddame (meaning introduction in Persian) before the DarƒÅmads. This Moqaddame is sometimes followed by a group of metric pieces, which are of recent origins and not of sufficient interest or authenticity to be considered here. The Moqaddame itself is nearly always included in a performance. It is a stately but unornate declamation which sets the tone for the DastgƒÅh, even though its characteristics are not maintained throughout. The Moqaddame places more emphasis on the tetrachord below the finalis; its basic melodic pattern is given here in MƒÅhur C : :: 600px () After the Moqaddame, the DarƒÅmad section begins. Here, certain modifications in the mode of MƒÅhur are effected. These modifications are: # The tetrachord above the finalis receives more emphasis than the tetrachord below it, except in the Forud. # The 2nd above the finalis (d in our scale) becomes the ≈†ƒÅhed. # The 4th above may function as the ƒÄqƒÅz in place of the finalis. # The melodic movement is overwhelmingly diatonic. Rare leaps of thirds are used; larger leaps are avoided, unless between phrases. The basic formula for a DarƒÅmad in MƒÅhur C is given in the following score: :: 560px () DƒÅstgah-e MƒÅhur is rich in the number and variety of its Gu≈°es, many of which modulate to modes very remote from the mode of MƒÅhur itself. The major Gu≈°es are DƒÅd, XosrovƒÅni, Tusi, AzarbƒÅyejƒÅni, Feyli, Abol, Delka≈°, Neyriz, ≈†ekaste, Nahib, ArƒÅq, ƒÄ≈°ur, RƒÅk, RƒÅk-e Ka≈°mir, and RƒÅk-e Hendi.

Apart from the titular story, it contains several one-page Smurf gags. Plot Brainy Smurf and two other Smurfs wander through the forest. When they are near Gargamel's house, they see a giant arriving. The giant introduces himself to Gargamel as Bigmouth and declares he's hungry. Gargamel, driven by fear, gives him some soup, but Bigmouth is still hungry tries to eat Azrael but the wizard stops him. Observing that Bigmouth will eat anything (even candles), Gargamel decides to use him as a tool in his vengeance against the Smurfs, offering to get him some to make a soup. Luckily the three Smurfs hear this and go to the Smurf Village to warn Papa Smurf. On their way to find the village, Gargamel and Bigmouth separate and Bigmouth follows a Smurf riding a stork to the village. There, Papa Smurf makes a plan. He makes the Smurfs behave very politely to Bigmouth, offering to make the Smurf soup he wants. Papa Smurf makes many Smurfs distract Bigmouth (a band with music, Poet Smurf with an ode to Bigmouth, Brainy Smurf with some moral phrases, and so on) while he prepares a cream that prevents burnings. The following day, Papa Smurf secretly calls four Smurfs. They apply the cream to themselves and then jump to the boiling water, where the cream (about which Bigmouth does not know) protects them. Papa Smurf sends Bigmouth after more wood to the fire, and while he's out, the four Smurfs leave the water, a magic formula is applied to it, and four Smurf costumes are thrown to make the giant believe that the Smurfs have dissolved into soup. When Bigmouth returns and drinks the soup, he becomes a blue monster (due to the formula), and Papa Smurf tricks him into believing that was the effect of drinking Smurf soup and that Gargamel knew all along. Right then Gargamel arrives. He catches some Smurfs, but they aren't worried because they know Bigmouth is furious with him. When Gargamel sees the blue Bigmouth, he releases the Smurfs and tries to run, but the angry giant catches him and everybody goes to Gargamel's house to see him try to make an antidote to Bigmouth. Papa Smurf carries a little box. All of Gargamel's tries for an antidote fail, making Bigmouth angrier, who then destroys most of the wizard's lab. Finally, Gargamel is reduced to begging Papa Smurf for help. Papa Smurf opens his box, takes out a little sarsaparilla leaf which he feeds to Bigmouth, who then returns to normal. At the end, the Smurfs return to the village when Azrael tries to catch one of them. This Smurf calls for Bigmouth, and even though the giant doesn't answer, Azrael runs away in fear.

Produced by Leftfield Pictures, the first six seasons were recorded in Las Vegas, Nevada, where it chronicled the daily activities at Rick's Restorations, an antique restoration shop, with its owner Rick Dale, his staff, and teenage son, as they restore various vintage items to their original condition. For season 7, History rebooted the program with a new concept and cast, with the series now following five American restoration shops.http://www.history.com/shows/american-restoration/about The show is the first spin-off of Pawn Stars, in which Dale has appeared several times as an on-camera expert and restored various items.\\"Meet the Experts\\" History.com; Accessed October 17, 2010Episodes of Pawn Stars in which Dale has appeared include \\"Time Machines\\" (Episode 1.8), \\"Rick's Big Bet\\" (Episode 1.10), \\"A Shot and a Shave\\" (Episode 2.4), \\"Wheels\\" (Episode 2.12), \\"Off the Wagon\\" (Episode 2.21), \\"Bumpy Ride\\" (Episode 2.26), \\"Hell Week\\" (Episode 2.29), \\"The British Are Coming\\" (Episode 2.31), \\"Trail Breaker\\" (Episode 3.1) and \\"Deals from Hell\\" (Episode 3.6) The series has featured cameo appearances by the cast of Pawn Stars, American Pickers, Counting Cars, magician/illusionist Lance Burton & David Copperfield, NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, and musicians Sammy Hagar, Billy Joel, and Jason Mraz.Stevens, Buck (June 6, 2012). \\"Greg Biffle To Get 'Restored' On History Channel Tonight\\". B104.  Format  = Seasons 1‚Äì6 = The series focuses on Rick's Restorations, a company owned and operated by Las Vegas area metal artist and antique restoration expert Rick Dale, who has been restoring various vintage items for almost 30 years. Dale and his company first appeared on the History reality television series Pawn Stars, in that show's first-season episode \\"Time Machines,\\" and in nine subsequent episodes in which he restored numerous decades-old items for the Harrisons (owners of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop where Pawn Stars takes place), including vending machines, gas pumps, barber chairs, motorcycles, and jukeboxes. Beginning with the June 6, 2012 episode (\\"Dirt Bike Duels\\"), a new feature, \\"Rick's Tips\\", was added preceding the second commercial break, in which Rick poses a question related to restoration, similar to the trivia question feature on Pawn Stars. According to Dale, who claims to emphasize a great attention to detail in his work, his shop typically works on 6 ‚Äì 12 projects at any given time. Although he and his staff restore the items brought in by customers themselves, they are shown consulting other merchants and experts for parts, and calling in freelance employees, such as Bob, a metalworker, when their workload requires it. In addition to items brought in by customers, Dale will also purchase items himself to restore from pickers, such as the toy train he purchases in \\"Buttered Up.\\" The range of services offered by Rick's Restorations is limited by financial concerns. Although Dale has a positive view of his staff's abilities, he observes that they are sometimes difficult to manage, in particular his younger brother, Ron. = Season 7 = Premiering on January 1, 2016, these episodes of American Restoration featured projects helmed by Bodie Stroud, Dale Walksler, Andy Bowman Jr., Steve Hale, and Bob Halliday, who own five separate restoration shops around the country.

In the episode \\"Tyler's Promotion\\", he was promoted to Shop Foreman, which was welcomed with mixed reactions from the rest of the crew. * Ron Dale ‚Äì Rick's younger brother, who works primarily as a picker. Rick feels his brother is the hardest of his employees to manage. Ron, who says his life is \\"relaxed [and] easy-paced\\", takes his time in his work. When going to get an item cleaned away from the shop in \\"Ice Cold\\", he and Tyler take lunch, even though Tyler informs that the staff generally does not do so, which Ron says is one of the \\"perks\\" of being out with him. Tyler remarks that this explains why it takes Ron three hours to go to the hardware store. Rick worries that Tyler, who looks up to Ron, and enjoys going out on jobs with him, will pick up Ron's bad habits.

Created in 2005 as a successor to Carolina Rail Services, the railroad was initially a Gulf & Ohio subsidiary before a change of contract in 2010 transferred operational responsibility to the Carolina Coastal Railway. Traffic includes rubber, chemicals, metal, and others, generating 3,000 annual carloads. History The first rail line reached Morehead City in 1858, and was constructed by the state sponsored Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad. Beginning in 1904 the railroad was operated under lease by the original Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). The lease on the segment from Morehead City to Beaufort was dropped by NS in 1937. The Beaufort and Morehead Railway was created on May 31, 1937 to operate the line vacated by NS. On January 12, 1981 the North Carolina Ports Railway Commission acquired the Beaufort & Morehead Railway and began independent operations. In 1986, the NCPRC transferred operations of the Beaufort & Morehead to Carolina Rail Services. 1998 brought an additional change, as the Beaufort & Morehead was merged with the state owned North Carolina Railroad. The following year control of the franchise was transferred back to the North Carolina Ports Railway Commission. Action by the state government in 2002 abolished the NCPRC and merged its assets with the North Carolina State Ports Authority. Further change came in 2005 as Gulf & Ohio created a new subsidiary, Morehead & South Fork, to replace the Beaufort & Morehead and take control of the lease from Carolina Rail Services. Ownership remained with the State Port Authority. In February 2010, the Carolina Coastal Railway took control of the lease and began operating the Morehead & South Fork.

When it was introduced in late 1969, it was one of the smallest electronic calculators ever produced commercially. Previous electronic calculators had been about the size of a typewriter and had logic circuits built from numerous discrete transistors and diodes or small- to medium-scale ICs. The QT-8D's logic circuits were packed into just four LSI ICs. The QT-8D was released in Japan at a price of 99,800 Japanese yen, a new low for electronic calculators. The retail price in the United States was $395 in 1970, equivalent to about $2,650 in 2019. The QT-8D only performs the four basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Like many calculators intended for business use, the QT-8D adds and subtracts in the style of an adding machine: after entering each number, the operator presses either the white key, to add it to the current total, or the red key, to subtract it from the total. However, the QT-8D is unusual in that multiplication and division share a single key . To multiply or divide, the operator enters the first number, presses , enters the second number, and then presses either to multiply or to divide. The resulting product or quotient is then added to or subtracted from the total in the usual way, by pressing or . The keyboard has 15 keys in all and uses magnetic reed switches, which, although expensive, are extremely reliable. The display has eight digits, with both a minus sign and an overflow indicator dot on the right hand side. The decimal point is \\"floating\\"‚Äîit is positioned automatically by the calculator logic. This was an advanced feature for the time; many desk calculators of this era had fixed decimal points and required very wide displays to maintain a minimum level of precision across the entire range of numbers available. The QT-8D's floating decimal allowed its display to be much narrower while still keeping eight digits of precision. The display is a vacuum fluorescent display, the first such display ever used in a production calculator. It is built from nine individual tubes, one tube for each digit and a single extra tube for the minus sign and overflow indicator. These Iseden \\"itron\\" tubes\\"Iseden\\" is an abbreviation for the manufacturer's full name, , known in English as Ise Electronics Corporation. have a unique digit style which is very different from today's seven-segment displays. Each digit tube uses nine segments to form the digits,Some sources say eight segments, but this is incorrect for the specific display tubes used in the QT-8D. and these segments are of varying shapes and lengths, producing a distinctive digit style reminiscent of handwritten digits. The digit \\"0\\" is only half the height of the other digits. This half-height zero makes it easy to distinguish zeros from other digits, a useful feature since the QT-8D does not have logic to suppress leading or trailing zeros in the display. Because Japanese integrated circuit manufacturers were not yet able to produce the high-density MOS LSI ICs which Sharp needed, Sharp sought help from U.S. semiconductor firms. Sharp eventually made an agreement with Rockwell International, which manufactured the QT-8D's LSI ICs for Sharp based on Sharp's logic designs. Each of the four LSI ICs contains the equivalent of about 700 to 900 transistors, and the ICs are named based on their functions. The NRD 2256 handles numerical read-in and display, converting keyboard scancodes into digit values and activating the various display tube segments based on digit values. The DC 2266 does decimal- point control, performing the automatic floating-decimal logic and aligning decimal points for arithmetic operations. The AC 2261 controls the arithmetic and provides the registers, and the AU 2271 performs the arithmetic (using a digital adder) and controls input to the registers. Sharp QT-8D Micro Compet Main PCB By the standards of its time, the QT-8D is quite a fast calculator. Dividing 99999999 by 1, which is the worst case for the simple long division method used on many calculators, takes roughly 200 milliseconds, and addition and subtraction are nearly instantaneous. The QT-8D is much smaller than earlier calculators; it is about long, wide, and high, and it weighs about . Although it isn't truly portable, since it needs AC power to operate, it does have a carrying handle on the rear, allowing it to be moved around easily. Its MOS LSI technology also greatly reduced its power usage compared to previous calculators: it has an AC power consumption rating of only 7 watts. This low power usage made it feasible for Sharp to introduce a battery-powered version, the QT-8B, in mid-1970. This was the first mass-produced electronic calculator to be battery-powered. It replaced the QT-8D's integrated power supply with a rechargeable battery pack, but it was otherwise nearly identical to the QT-8D. The four ICs of the QT-8D and QT-8B were also used as the basis of the Sharp EL-8, one of the first mass-produced hand-held electronic calculators, introduced in 1971. Sharp also built OEM versions of the QT-8D for the Swedish office machine company Facit and its subsidiary Addo, which sold them as the Facit 1115 and the Addo-X 9354. These had the same internals as the QT-8D but used a different case and keycaps. Facit 1115J and Addo-X 9354 The Soviet- built Elektronika EKVM 24-71, introduced in 1971, was reverse-engineered from the Sharp QT-8D with minor differences.Sharp QT-8D vs Elektronika 24-71 (in Russian)  Notes   References   External links  * SHARP Micro Compet QT-8D * Sharp QT-8D - Rechnerwiki * FACIT: 1115 (the Facit OEM version) * Fiche detaillee du modele: Addo-X 9354j (the Addo OEM version) * Museum of Soviet Calculators - EKBM 24-71 (the Soviet clone) * Soviet Digital Electronics Museum -- EKVM 24-71 (more on the Soviet clone) * Sharp QT-8D in Curtamania (In English) QT-8D ","title":"Sharp QT-8D"},{"id":"28941685","text":"John Norton (28 September 1823 ‚Äì 10 November 1904) was an English architect who designed country houses, churches and a number of commercial buildings. Early life Norton was born and educated in Bristol. He became the pupil of architect Benjamin Ferrey (1810‚Äì80) in 1846. Ferrey was an early member of the Royal Institute of British Architects and a close friend of the designer Augustus Pugin (1812‚Äì52), who took his inspiration from the Gothic medieval styles of the pre-Reformation era. Ferrey's association with Pugin had a profound effect upon Norton, who adopted Pugin's principles and Christian moral dimensions in his own subsequent designs for church architecture. The vital tenets of Pugin's and thus Norton's creed were centred on the revival of the pointed structure of the Gothic arch. It was argued that only this construction truly symbolised Christian striving towards heaven and Christ's resurrection, Classical architecture having been based on pagan temples. Furthermore, that '...there should be no features about a building which are not necessary for convenience, construction or propriety,...all ornament should consist of enrichment of the essential construction of the building...[and that] in pure architecture the smallest detail should have a meaning or serve a purpose.' Pugin A.W.N. (1841/2003) 'The True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture Set Forth (intro. T.Brittain-Catlin), (Reading: SpireBooks). Career Pugin died in 1852 at the time that Norton, not yet 30, was to embark upon a succession of Gothic revivalist designs for parish churches throughout Somerset. Ferrey had continued to maintain a thriving architectural practice in the west of England and had been appointed honorary architect to the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Norton, although now based in London also maintained a Bristol office. Norton's association with Sir Peregrine Acland, who donated the ¬£16,000 necessary to rebuild the former mediaeval church of St. Audries, bore further fruit with the commission to design Stogursey School in 1860. This was undertaken by Norton with his now customary flamboyance and dedication to the ideals of Gothic revivalism, and was constructed from local Quantock stone with Bath stone dressings. The school stands in use today. In accordance with Ferrey and Pugin's prescient concerns for the inter-relationship of humanity and the environment it produces, Norton's designs called for the sourcing of construction materials from their locality. Holy Trinity, Stapleton, was built from pennant stone quarried from nearby Broomhill dressed in stone from Bath. St. Audries from red sandstone quarried from nearby Stampford Brett, and Holy Trinity, Walton, from the hard underlying blue lias, a sedimentary Jurassic limestone quarried from Somerton, just five miles from the church site. In addition to the regular ecclesiastical commissions, Norton's London practice had designed the grand residences that line Crystal Palace Road in Sydenham. The sale of these properties partly financed the park which had been laid out to display Paxton's Crystal Palace, reconstructed from the Great Exhibition of 1851. Work on country residences Later that decade, Norton's reputation was enhanced with commissions to build Nutley Priory near Redhill, (Surrey), for the banker E.H.Gurney, Brent Knoll in the West Country for G.S.Poole, and Chewton Magna Manor for W.Adlam. John Norton's greatest commission was now on the horizon. William Gibbs (1790‚Äì1875) had become a partner in the family trading company and by the time of Queen Victoria's accession in 1837 had, with his brother Henry, circumspectly steered their business through the French Wars and the dissolution of Spanish colonial interests. William became sole owner in 1842 and the following 40 years produced annual profits that would have reached beyond his ancestors' imagining. Gibbs' Peruvian office had secured contracts for the export to Britain of guano, the nitrogen-rich deposits of seabird droppings that became a principal fertiliser for the increase of wheat yields. William Gibbs now required a country seat for his family away from London and in 1843 purchased Tyntes Place, an attractive house with relatively simple and plain internal decoration that overlooked the Bristol Channel. The house had been rebuilt to the conservative tastes of a Reverend Seymour and further improved by Nailsea architect Robert Newton after 1836. During the 1850s the celebrated designer John Gregory Crace (1809‚Äì89), who had worked closely with Augustus Pugin, was commissioned by Gibbs to make improvements to the London house at 16 Hyde Park Gardens, and also to refurbish Tyntesfield House, as it was now officially referred to. Norton was first invited to Tyntesfield on 21 August 1860, when Gibbs outlined his needs for further expansion to his country seat. The meeting went well and in March the following year, with fellow ecclesiastical architect Rohde Hawkins, introductions were made to the builders William Cubitt & Co. in London, and meetings held with senior partner George Plucknett. It was Plucknett who held the responsibility for executing Norton's designs. Cubitts had built Osborne House for Queen Victoria on the Isle of Wight, and thus came with the highest recommendations. Norton's dramatic designs were completed by 1863 and the extensive re-modelling of Tyntesfield commenced in October. The building work took over two years and was completed close to the ¬£70,000 budget allowed for it. Reverend Seymour's restrained Regency house had been utterly absorbed, doubled in size and transformed into a soaring Gothic-revival masterpiece bristling with ornamentation born from its diverse construction elements. Though quite new, the range of buildings gave the appearance of having grown over a much longer period of time. Pinnacles, gables, crenellated towers, stained glass, plain glass and leaded light windows harmonised in a testimony to Norton's visionary skills and balance, and Plucknett's craftmanship. The interiors of the vast house were just as breathtaking. 'Norton's creation was quite extraordinary. He had combined the Gothic beauty of holiness with a reverence for nature. He created domestic architecture based on the recent collegiate buildings in Oxford. Suddenly, too, the tenets of Ruskin and Pugin have become transfixed in stone.' Miller J. (2003) 'Fertile Fortune: The Story of Tyntesfield' (London: The National Trust) Tyntesfield remains at the zenith of Norton's designs but his architectural practice continued the ecclesiastical, country house and suburban output for which he was now rightly celebrated. St John the Evangelist's in Middlesbrough dates from 1865. Between 1866 and 1875 Norton built and restored parish churches in South Wales: St. David's, Neath,(1866), St. Matthew, Llanelwydd and the parish church of Builth Wells, (1870). In 1875, he re-designed the west wall of St. Thomas the Apostle, Redwick, Newport, inserting a large window. Norton's occasional forays into suburban architecture, notably Berkeley Square, Clifton, and the Crystal Palace estate designs, re-emerged in 1871 when the south side of Crystal Palace Park was developed and Norton's London practice designed a series of impressive houses. Dalewood House in winter From 1867‚Äì72, he lived at nearby Litchfield House, and in 1873 moved to 'St. Helens' 55 Crystal Palace Road where he remained until 1881. Norton also continued with his country house commissions and in 1884, re-modelled and enlarged Badgemore House, west of Henley in Oxfordshire for Richard Ovey. During this period he designed Dalewood House in Mickleham, Surrey. The house now serves as the main building of Box Hill School a Public School in the village which was established in 1959 by Roy McComish, a former house master and art master at Gordonstoun School who developed the school under the same principles as Gordonstoun's founder Kurt Hahn Norton returned to South Wales in 1887 to design Gwyn Hall, the principal civic building and music hall for Neath Port Talbot. This handsome structure with its fine windows and trademark colonnade of Gothic arches cost ¬£6,000 to design and build. It was recently undergoing a ¬£4 million facelift when a fire gutted the building in 2007. Fortunately, Norton's exterior has mostly survived. In the 1890s, Norton was commissioned to design Saint Helen's Church, Lundy Island, by the then owner, the Rev'd Hudson Grosset Heaven. St Helen's stands prominently on the top of the island and, visible from the sea on all sides, is the island's most conspicuous landmark. The church is built largely of Lundy granite and the 65-foot-high tower houses 8 bells. The high church interior of polychromed brick is enhanced by some good stained glass (though the fine east window has been partially blocked up due to weather damage) and a beautiful reredos of carved alabaster by Harry Hems of Exeter. St Helena's was completed in 1896 and consecrated by the Bishop of Exeter in 1897. Other than his dynamic, traditional Christian faith and the references from William Gibbs' business- like diary, which note his satisfaction as to the progress at Tyntesfield, we know little of John Norton's personality. One intriguing and revealing insight however is illuminated from the autobiography of the great author Thomas Hardy (1840‚Äì1928). Norton's London practice was in Old Bond Street, and in April 1862, despite being fully staffed he agreed that the young Hardy, who at the time sought apprenticeship in architecture,'...should come daily to the office and make drawings'. The biography, (penned in fact by Hardy's second wife Florence), records that, 'he proved himself to be one of the best helps Hardy ever had' Hardy, T.& F. (1928/2007) 'Wordsworth Literary Lives: Thomas Hardy' (Ware: Wordsworth Editions) Other projects he was associated with include Berkeley Square, Bristol, for which in 1851 he made the replica of the Bristol High Cross which stands in the square; the Manor House in Chew Magna; St Audries Park; the college of St Matthias, Bristol; and Christ Church, Clifton Down, Bristol. This church was built by Charles Dyer in 1841. Norton added the steeple, which reaches , in 1859. Norton died on 10 November 1904 and was buried in Bournemouth, Dorset. References *Miller J.

Classical Chinese poetry forms are those poetry forms, or modes which typify the traditional Chinese poems written in Literary Chinese or Classical Chinese. Classical Chinese poetry has various characteristic forms, some attested to as early as the publication of the Classic of Poetry, dating from a traditionally, and roughly, estimated time of around 10th‚Äì7th century BC. The term \\"forms\\" refers to various formal and technical aspects applied to poems: this includes such poetic characteristics as meter (such as, line length and number of lines), rhythm (for example, presence of caesuras, end-stopping, and tone contour), and other considerations such as vocabulary and style. These forms and modes are generally, but not invariably, independent of the Classical Chinese poetry genres. Many or most of these were developed by the time of the Tang Dynasty, and the use and development of Classical Chinese poetry and genres actively continued up until the May Fourth Movement, and still continues even today in the 21st century. History Gao Bing wrote the Graded Compendium of Tang Poetry (Tangshi Pinhui), which is the first work using prosodic principles in a systematic method to classify poetry by Classical Chinese poetry forms. This built upon an extensive but less systematic approach; for example, by Yan Yu. Formal elements There are various formal elements of Classical Chinese verse which are associated with its classification into formal types. =Scansion= Various factors are considered in scanning Classical Chinese verse in order to determine the meter. Meter For the purpose of metrically scanning Classical Chinese verse, the basic unit corresponds to a single character, or what is considered one syllable: an optional consonant or glide (or in some versions of reconstructed Old or Middle Chinese a consonantal cluster), an obligatory vowel or vowel cluster (with or without glides), and an optional final consonant. Thus a seven-character line is identical with a seven-syllable line; and, barring the presence of compound words, which were rare in Classical Chinese compared to Modern Chinese (and even people's names would often be abbreviated to one character), then the line would also be a seven words itself. Classical Chinese tends toward a one-to-one correspondence between word, syllable, and a written character. Counting the number of syllables (which could be read as varying lengths, according to the context), together with the caesuras, or pauses within the line, and a stop, or long pause at the end of the line, generally established the meter.See Stimson The characters (or syllables) between the caesuras or end stops can be considered to be a metric foot. The caesuras tended to both be fixed depending upon the formal rules for that type of poem and to match the natural rhythm of speech based upon units of meaning spanning the characters. Line length Line length could be fixed or variable, and was based on the number of syllables/characters. In more formal poetry it tended to be fixed, and varied according to specific forms. Lines were generally combined into couplets. Lines tended to be end-stopped; and, line couplets almost always. Line length is the fundamental metrical criterion in classifying Classical Chinese poetry forms. Once the line length is determined, then the most likely of the line by caesuras is also known, since they are as a rule fixed in certain positions. Thus, specifying the line-length of a Chinese poem is equivalent to specifying both the type of feet and the number of feet per line in poetry using quantitative meter. =Fixed line length poems= A three-character line is known from the Three Character Classic, a book for children written in three-character eight-line verse in rhymed couplets. Four-character lines are encountered in the popular form of verse matching, where two verses are matched, often with rhyme, and often traditional four-character idioms, frequently drawn from classical poetry. For instance, two four-character lines may be written on matching scrolls, in Chinese calligraphy, and each decoratively hung on either side of a door or entrance way, these are known as Duilian. Some ancient style poetry was also four-line. Six-character line lengths are relatively rare in fixed-length poems, but are found for example in the work of Wang Jian. Five, Seven, and eight (or doubled four character lines) character lines are standard for serious, fixed-length poetry. =Variable line length poems= Some poems have lines of variable lengths within a single poem, either experimentally, as unique specimens, or in certain fixed formats. For example, the poems written according to fixed patterns based, or originally based, upon song lyrics such as the ci form or upon folk ballads such as the yuefu. The \\"tune\\", or tonal structure of these poems was also fixed within each specific pattern. This resulted eventually in quite a few fixed-forms with variable line lengths within each piece, with hundreds of named models identified. Often the name of the model used features in the title of the poem. Couplets Most Classical Chinese verse consists of multiple couplets or pairs of lines (), which are considered to be somehow especially related to each other by such considerations as meaning, tone-structure, or parallelism. A common rhyme scheme is the rhymed couplet, so that generally in rhymed poetry, the even numbered lines rhyme. Sometimes these couplets appear by themselves, for example one-half on each side of a door. Poem length Because of the tendency to write poetry as groups of couplets, most poems had an even number of lines. Generally four lines (two couplets) were considered to be the minimum length for a poem. In the case of curtailed verse (jueju), the poem was limited to this length. Other types of poems were limited to eight lines (four couplets). If the overall length of some form of poetry was not limited, the poems tended to be written using four- or eight-line stanzas, so the poem lengths would work out to multiples of four or eight. Some poems were quite long. The length of poems based upon specific song and ballad forms depended upon the specific tune or form selected as the model. The fu type of poem, which sometimes even incorporated sections of prose, had few limitations on line length, except that, within a section of verse, the line lengths tended to be of equal length.Frankel, 212‚Äì213 A specific poem's length for those forms in which this was a restriction, is another basic classifying criterion (as in Seven-character eight-line verse). Old, new, regulated, unregulated Poems of the same length in terms of line-length and poem-length and/or poems within the same general type were often distinguished by using the concepts \\"new\\", \\"old\\", \\"regulated\\", or \\"unregulated\\". =\\"Old\\" versus \\"new\\"= \\"Old\\" and \\"new\\" were generally used to denote a basic change of form within a mode or form, like \\"old\\" yuefu and \\"new\\" yuefu. However, the use of these terms can be confusing, since something called \\"new\\" might be centuries old by the present time. =\\"Regulated\\" versus \\"unregulated\\"= \\"Regulated\\" verse, or new- style shi poetry, has very strict and often complex formal limitations, such as mandatory tonal alterations between adjacent positions within a line, or in regards to the same line-positions between couplets. Tone The existence of tone in Old through early Tang Chinese is debatable.See Norman Certainly by the major period of poetic flourishing in Tang, syllable tones were divided into level and not-level. These variations were or became an important aspect of poetry, sometimes in an esoteric way. The presence or absence of formal tonal constraints regarding tone pattern varies according to the poetic form of a specific poem. Sometimes the rules governing the permissible tone patterns for a poem were quite strict, yet still allowed for a certain amount of liberty and variation, as in the case of Regulated verse. In the fixed-tone pattern type of verse the poems were written according to preexisting models known as \\"tunes\\". This was the case with the ci and the qu: an individual poem was written so that its tone pattern (and line lengths) were the same as one of the model types, the poetic variation was in the change in the particular wording of the lyrics. Rhythm Rhythm was mostly a matter of tonal variation, line length, caesuras within lines, and end stopping. Variations of rhythm were subtly played off in between the various lines within a poem. Rhyme Rhyme, or rime, was important in some forms of poetry. However, it was often based on a formal and traditional schema, such as is in a Rime table or rime dictionary, and not necessarily upon actual vernacular speech. The Pingshui Yun system was the standard for poetry rhyme from Yuan to Qing Dynasty, even though it was very different from actual contemporary pronunciations. Also, generally level tones only rhymed with level tones, and non-level tones with non-level tones. The original rhymes of a poem can be difficult to detect, especially in Modern Chinese, such as Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese pronunciations (including syllable finals and tone) tend to be quite different from in the older, historical types of Chinese language, although perhaps to a lesser extent in Cantonese: either way, Classical Chinese is no longer a spoken language, and pronunciation was subject to major historical variation, as attested through linguistic studies. =Vocabulary= Certain restrictions or associations of particular words were often typical of certain poetic forms, and for some forms of poetry there were rules restricting or encouraging the repetition of the same word within a poem, a stanza, or a line or couplet. Sometimes a deliberately archaic or traditional poetic vocabulary was used. Often the use of common words such as pronouns and \\"empty words\\" like particles and measure words were deprecated. Certain standard vocabulary substitutions were standard where a certain word would not fit into the metrical pattern. Formal types Classical Chinese poems are typified by certain formal structures. Some of these can be considered closed collections, such as the groups of poems actually composing the Classic of Poetry (Shijing), the Songs of the South (Chuci), or the Nineteen Poems: These corpora were closed categories, one could not add to these classics, although one might write poems in the similar style, as in Old Style Poetry (Gushi). Further, one might follow the new styles that were introduced over succeeding dynasties, or make up one's own style, which may or may not catch on. In terms of literary form, however, Classical Chinese poetry has the three main formal types: shi, fu, and ci.Watson, 1 =Shi= Although in Chinese the word shiShi: can mean \\"poetry\\" more or less generically, in a more technical sense shi refers to a certain more specific tradition within the broader category of poetry, which references the poems collected in the Shijing and further developments along certain lines. There are various types of shi poetry, such as \\"old style\\" gushi and \\"new style\\" jintishi. Classic of Poetry (Shijing) This is the style of those poems which compose this collection, the Shijing, or Shi Jing, known variously in English such as The Book of Songs, the Classic of Poetry, the \\"Book of Odes\\", or just The Odes. Associated with the court of the Zhou Dynasty, particularly Western Zhou, the poems of this collection are of uncertain dates. Some of the individual pieces of this material may be quite older than other ones. The Classic of Poetry was edited supposedly by Confucius in the Spring and Autumn period, which correlates with the first half of the Eastern Zhou. Confucius at this time is said to have chosen approximately 300 out of a collection which at that time included about 3,000 individual pieces of verse.Yip, 31 Although some of these may have been collected as folk-songs, they show signs of editorial reworking. The original musical scores and choreography meant to be performed together with them have all been lost. In following dynasties, especially with the Han Dynasty deification of Confucius and the incorporation of the Classic of Poetry into the mandatory material for testing under the imperial examination system, the poems within it became subject to much artificial and moralistic reinterpretation.Yip, 32‚Äì33 Especially the sexual elements came to be officially viewed as parables for love of the Confucian rites and social order, especially the love of the subject for his political lord and master. Although of historical interest and importance, such interpretations are not in line with modern scholarship. All of the Classic of Poetrys poems are anonymous. The style of the poems represent the first examples of Chinese regular verse; that is verse with fixed-length lines, generally of four characters, with these mostly as syntactic couplets.Frankel, 216 Its poems also feature a good deal of rhythmic repetition and variation and many of the songs or poems are arranged into stanzas of similar metrical structure.Frankel, 215‚Äì216 The poems use end rhyme and internal rhyme, occasional parallelism, and a vocabulary of identical and matching words. =Verses of Chu (Chuci)= Chuci, also known as Songs of the South and as Ch'u Tz'u, refers to the poems and the style of those poems which compose this collection. The name literally refers to the state of Chu, which was to the south of the area from which the poems of the Classic of Poetry were collected, and south of the main area populated by people of Chinese culture in China at the time of its composition and for many centuries afterwards (in fact, until the great population change in the time of the Song Dynasty, or, perhaps more accurately, the time of the Tang-Song transition). The collection includes the Li Sao, attributed to Qu Yuan, as well as the Nine Songs. =Fu= Fu is one of the traditional main categories of Classical Chinese poetry, or literature; however, it is traditionally not generally considered not to be a pure form of poetry (having been usually classified as wen rather than shi‚Äîhowever the Chinese terms do not really correspond with the English terms \\"literature\\" and \\"poetry\\").Davis, xlvi The main characteristics of the fu form are that each individual piece be multisectional, that the sectional divisions are marked in one or more of 3 ways, that the whole piece be monothematic (devoted to 1 explicit topic), and that the description of this topic be exhaustive, both in detail and vocabulary. Other, less apparent features are also typically present, which can be summarized as being part of a process of poetic indirection. Even though subject to extreme minimalism the indirect commentary forms the true crux of this art form. Formal elements  =Definition= Certain elements of a fu are definitional, or obligatory. In order for a piece of literature to be considered to be a fu certain, basic criteria must be met. Multisectionality for fu is obligatory. The sections may be differentially marked in 3 various ways: change in meter, change in rhyme, and change in supernumerary phrase usage.Frankel (1976), 3 Sometimes the formal sectional divisions are marked by change between prose and poetry.Frankel (1976), 209 In printed versions, typographic spacing is also used. Conventions of the fu include that each particular fu focus on one particular theme or subject. And, that this theme or subject be treated in exhaustive detail.Frankel (1976), 78 This tends to lead to an art form characterized by hyperbole and the artistic use of explicit exclusion.Frankel (1976), 79 =Vocabulary= A typical feature of the fu form is the repetitive use of certain nonce syllables or \\"empty words\\" in fixed positions within the lines. For example, the fu form often but not necessarily includes the use of the exclamatory particle ÂÖÆ (, Middle Chinese (Tang) hei, Old Chinese: *gÀ§e). ÂÖÆ is an interjection generally used at the end of a line within a couplet, or as a mid-line break within one line.Frankel (1976), 212 Similarly characteristic of the fu is the use of certain other particular fixed position particles (function, or \\"empty\\" words), often at or near the center of a line, and probably with an unstressed pronunciation. Another characteristic of the fu form is the use of supernumerary initial words or phrases, and or the use paired particles.Frankel (1976), 212, and also see 163‚Äì164 The use of these words or phrases are typically used repetitively in parallel constructions. As for the rest of the words, the author strives for a rich, varied vocabulary, designed to impress the reader by an exhaustive display of synonyms including the rare, the obscure, and the exotic. =Rhyme, meter, and stanzaic divisions= Generally, every other line in a particular fu rhyme;Frankel (1976), 213 that is, fu tend to use rhymed couplets. The complex metering is determined by line-length, caesura, and the use of certain specific particles, in fixed positions. The line-lengths within a particular fu tend to vary, yet remain consistent within each discrete section, so that the lines within each section usually are of equal length to each other.Frankel (1976), 212‚Äì213 The use of a luan in the form of an appended lyrical coda, is \\"not uncommon\\". Thus, the end of a fu often consists of a final stanza or section which poetically sums up the piece in a brief reprise. Generic features As a genre, fu tend to express certain themes or topics. =Topics and themes= Fu can be on various topics and themes, although each individual piece is strictly limited in its explicit focus. Typical subjects of fu tend to be an exotic object or creature (such as a parrot), a well-known object or creature but which is shown in a new and boldly impressive way to the reader (such as an owl), the majesty and luxury of noble rulers (such as the royal hunt), and the \\"fu of discontent\\", that is, the frustrations experienced by a scholar (such as not being properly rewarded and appreciated by royal patronage despite great talent and true loyalty). =Poetic indirection= The use of poetic indirection is a key feature of fu.Frankel (1976), 4 That is the poet may hint at a certain point by subtly and discretely including a comment hinting towards something or by deliberately avoiding saying what the reader would otherwise expect to appear within the highly structured context of the piece. So, on the one hand, the fu style is a lavish and florid rhapsody of almost unrestrained gushing forth upon an explicit topic; but, typically, on the other hand, the authors use the greatest restraint and circumspection to impart a subtle discourse for the discerning and critical reader. =Protest= Despite the surface appearance of fu as unrestrained enthusiasm for some particular object or event upon which the author gets carried away in a rhapsody of words, in actuality the fu genre traditionally dealt with sociopolitical protest, such as the theme of the loyal scholar-official who has been overlooked for promotion or even been unjustly exiled by the ruler or by a disloyal faction in power at the court, rather than receiving the promotion and respect which he truly deserves. This may be expressed allegorically through the use of the persona of a friend or historical figure (a safer course in the case of a poet-official who might be punished for any too blatant criticism of the current emperor).Davis (1970): xlviii In a fu elaborately describing the exotic luxuries possessed by the nobility at the royal courts described so lavishly there is an implied contrast with the life of suffering and deprivation experienced by the common folk, implicit to the reader, but not directly stated. A rhapsody on the royal hunt, and the vast slaughter of creatures powerless to save themselves from the majestic power of the royal hunt for the enjoyment of the ruler also invites the reader to make a comparison with the nature of imperial political power in human society. Criticism in fu of the current social or political situation was traditionally done in the most restrained and indirect way possible: explicit social or political commentary was not acceptable, unless it was masked by setting it in the confines of a former era and avoiding mention of any similarity with the current dynastic power, which, if mentioned could only be lavishly praised. For example, a traditional fu theme during the Han dynasty was the unfair treatment of scholar-official Qu Yuan, at the hands of high-ranking officials in the former Kingdom of Chu: this allows for the reader to compare the situation of the author versus the current officialdom, but does not compel such an interpretation, allowing for what might be called \\"deniable plausibility\\", and a defense against a charge of l√®se-majest√©. Part of the poetic tradition was to actively engage the reader as a participant in the process of a poetic experience; and, although not a purely poetic form, the fu shares this feature of providing a space where the reader and the author can meet half way, and in the case of the fu this tends to be an engagement with social or political criticism. As Hellmut Wilhelm puts it: \\"...the Han fu can easily be classified into a limited number of types. All types have one feature in common: almost without exception they can be and have been interpreted as voicing criticism‚Äîeither of the ruler, the ruler's behavior, or certain political acts or plans of the ruler; or of the court officials or the ruler's favorites; or, generally, of the lack of discrimination in the employment of officials. The few examples that are positive in tone recommend the authors or their peers for employment, or even contain specific political suggestions. In short, almost all fu have a political purport, and, in addition, almost all of them deal with the relationship between the ruler and his officials.\\"Wilhelm (1967 [1957]): 311. Seen in context, Ban Gu's discussion of Qu Yuan and the Chu sao style is less to the point of the actual evolutionary path of the fu and more to the point that the main purpose of the fu is political and social criticism through poetic indirection: thus, in fu, paradoxically, the \\"fantastic descriptions and an overflowing rhetoric...can be reduced to...restraint\\", as the sociopolitical criticism which was key to the fu was constrained within a very subtle, elaborately indirect, occasional, and allusive mode.Wilhelm (1967 [1957]): 312‚Äì314, quoting Sima Qian on Sima Xiangru. History  The fu form is associated with the influence of Chu literature, as anthologized in the Chuci and it had a great flourishing during the beginning of the Han dynasty (founded 206 BCE). The Book of Han explicitly references the Xunzi fu, from the Warring States era from which the Han dynasty emerged. Examples Many examples of fu exist, some number of which have been translated into French, English, and other languages. For example, \\"Return to the Field\\", by Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139). Fu authors Various persons are prominent in the area of fu literature, including original authors, anthologists, critics, and translators. Han dynasty authors of fu include Jia Yi, Zhang Heng, Ban Gu, Yang Xiong, Yang Xiong, Wang Can (177‚Äì217),and Sima Xiangru. Consort Ban is also credited with authoring several Han fu. Also: Mi Heng (173‚Äì198). Wang Can (177‚Äì217) was a late- Han/early Jian'an fu author. During the Six dynasties era, Guo Pu wrote fu during the Eastern Jin dynasty. In the field of criticism and fu authorship, Lu Ji's's Wen fu is an important work, which was later rendered into English by Achilles Fang. The Wen Xuan anthologized by Xiao Tong (501‚Äì531) is an important source work for surviving fu, including fu which he attributes to Song Yu. During the Tang dynasty fu revival, the fu form was used by Li Bai, among others. =Old Style Poetry (Gushi)= GushiGushi: is the style based upon older forms of shi, but allowing new additions to the corpus (unlike the fixed corpus of the \\"classic shi\\" of the Shijing). One type of poetry imitative of \\"old\\" poetic forms is the Literary Yuefu. The literary yuefu include imitations in the style of original Han Dynasty ballad lyrics or imitations of the original \\"Southern-style\\" ballad lyrics from the Six Dynasties.Yip, 67 The gushi form begins with the Nineteen Old Poems. Nineteen Poems The Nineteen Old Poems, sometimes shortened to Nineteen Poems, and also known in English transliteration as Ku-shih shih-chiu shih, refers both to a specific collection of poems as well as to the style in which those poems were composed. The original nineteen poems, in the ballad or old yuefu style, were collected during the Han Dynasty. =Yuefu= Yuefu were a development of the forms of poetic literature collected by or edited by the Han Dynasty Music Bureau. In later dynasties the term yuefu (\\"Music Bureau\\") was used to identify these officially propagated ballad-style poems, as well as being used as a descriptor for poems in the yuefu style, as it came to be elaborated by following poets. These later yuefu were sometimes distinguished from the classic anthology pieces by qualifying these yuefu as \\"new\\" or \\"literary\\" \\"yuefu\\". Old Music Bureau Lyrics (old yuefu) This is the style of the official Han Dynasty Music Bureau, which once existed. New yuefu This is the style, consisting of several subdivisions, of those poems based upon the poems and the style of the poems of the former Han Dynasty Music Bureau, after it had ceased to exist. =New pattern poems (jintishi)= Regulated verse, or jintishi includes three subforms. Although, to a quick glance not necessarily all that different from regular line length yuefu in terms of line length in characters per line, or numbers of lines, there are internally a whole \\"new\\" (at the time of their introduction, in the Tang dynasty) set of rules or regulations, for example regarding tonal patterns, parallelism, repetition of characters. Eight-line Regulated Verse (lushi) LushiLushi, sometimes spelled l√ºshi: refers to the regulated, or strict formal rules, of this poetry form. It is most associated with the eight-line style, although the same rules basically apply to the curtailed form (jueju) and the expanded form (pailu). *Five-character eight- line regulated verse (wulu) A form of regulated verse with eight lines of five characters each. *Six-character eight-line regulated verse is relatively rare. *Seven-character eight-line regulated verse (qilu) A form of regulated verse with eight lines of seven characters each. Curtailed form (jueju) The curtailed form is sometimes referred to as a quatrain due to its requirement to consist of four lines. Basically, the jueju is a shortened version of the eight-line version, resulting in a verse form which can more challenging in terms of conveying a complete poem or developing a complete poetic concept; this is, indeed, especially the case with the five-character line version. *Five-character four-line curtailed verse () Also known as the Five-character- quatrain, this form of regulated verse is characterized by four lines of five characters each. *Seven-character four-line curtailed verse () Also known as the Seven-character-quatrain, this is a form of regulated verse with four lines of seven characters each. Expanded form (pailu) While embracing all, or most of, the lushi rules and regulations the pailu allows for a number of linked couplets with no maximum upward limit. A strict emphasis on formal parallelism is typical of the pailu form. =Fixed tone-pattern poetry= Poems based on traditional structures, originally meant as lyrics to go along with particular musical tunes or scoring, included in the fixed tone-pattern forms are the ci, qu, and yuanqu. Ci Poems based on traditional structures, originally meant as lyrics to go along with music. Qu and Yuanqu Qu, similarly to Ci refers to a fixed tone-pattern form of poetry, however the tunes to which the qu are based are different from the ci poems, and also there are some accompanying stylistic differences. Yuanqu are fixed tone-pattern poems derived from Yuan dramas, or matching the arias of those operas. The \\"Yuan\\" part of the name is merely a reference to the dynastic era involved, namely the Yuan Dynasty.

Classical Chinese poetry genres are those genres which typify the traditional Chinese poems written in Classical Chinese. Some of these genres are attested to as early as the publication of the Classic of Poetry, dating from a traditionally, and roughly, estimated time of around 10th‚Äì7th century BCE, in what is now China, but at that time was composed of various independent states. The term \\"genres\\" refers to various aspects, such as to topic, theme, and subject matter, what similes or metaphors were considered appropriate or how they would be interpreted, and other considerations such as vocabulary and style. These genres were generally, but not always independent of the Classical Chinese poetry forms. Many or most of these forms and genres were developed by the Tang Dynasty, and the use and development of Classical Chinese poetry genres actively continued up until the May Fourth Movement, in 1919, and still continues even today in the 21st century. Landscape style poetry genre Similarly to the classification of Chinese painting, some poetry is regarded as \\"landscape poetry\\", because it primarily utilizes images of scenes of nature. Some of the genesis of this can be seen in the nature imagery of the Shijing. Also, the Orchid Pavilion Gathering was an important influence in this regard. Similarly, this genre may be divided into two subgenres: the more domestic nature poetry of the \\"Fields and Gardens\\" genre and the more completely untrammeled nature encountered in the \\"Rivers and Mountains\\" (shansui shi).Hinton, 111 The landscape style of poetry also developed an impetus through a happy conjoining with similar generic developments in Chinese painting such as the Shan shui style. =Rivers and Mountains (Â±±Ê∞¥)= The Rivers and Mountains or shanshui style or genre of poetry involves or depicts naturalistic images or settings. Mountains, rivers and often waterfalls are prominent in this art form. The direct focus of this poetry tends to be explicitly on the scene itself, rather than the human elements or viewer(s) of the scene. One of the greatest exemplars of this type of poetry was Wang Wei.Yip, 131 =Fields and Gardens (Áî∞Âúí)= Although the Fields and Gardens style or genre of poetry involves depictions of naturalistic images or settings like the Mountains and Rivers genre, the settings and specifics are more oriented to the cultivated countryside and the domesticated garden. Tao Qian, also known as Tao Yuanming, wrote poems exemplifying this form.Yip, 163 to 169 Frontier Fortress (ÈÇäÂ°û, Âá∫Â°û, or Â°û‰∏ãÊõ≤) \\"Border Fortress\\" (), but also known by other names such as \\"Beyond the Borders\\", this genre of Classical Chinese poetry deals with the experiences ‚Äì real or imagined ‚Äì of life on the edge of the Chinese empire. They are set especially in the arid regions to the North and West, which were remote, subject to temperature extremes and to sand and dust storms, and populated with sometimes exotic and often hostile people. Yet these frontier areas were vital to the empire: politically due to imperial ambitions, economically due to the Silk Road trade, and symbolically. Important poets who wrote in this genre include Gao Shi and Cen Shen, both of the Tang Dynasty. Gufeng Gufeng (Âè§È¢®), literally \\"ancient airs\\" are a Chinese poetry genre based on the \\"Airs (feng) from the Kingdoms (States)\\" section of the Shijing. Examples include Li Bo's gufeng on Mount Taibai. Li Bo also wrote a poem entitled Âè§È¢®.Stimson, 59 Huaigu, recalling the past One widespread genre is known as Huaigu (). In this type of poem, the poet looks back at some bygone time, place, or persons. This is \\"one of the perennial themes of Chinese poetry,\\" according to Burton Watson, in which \\"the poet contemplates the ruins of past glory.\\"Watson, 88 Huiwen, \\"palindrome\\" poem style Reproductions of the lost original of Su Hui's \\"Xuanji Tu\\" palindrome poem. The major exponent of this was Su Hui. Her \\"Xuanji Tu\\" poem is in the form of a twenty-nine by twenty-nine character grid, and can be read forward or backwards, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Midnight Songs poetry Midnight Songs poetry also known as, Zi Ye, or \\"Lady Midnight\\" style, supposedly originating with an eponymously named fourth-century professional singer of the Eastern Jin dynasty.Watson, 60 Xiaoxiang poetry Xiaoxiang poetry has a long tradition in China, and later has been of influence more globally. This poetry was associated with the Xiaoxiang region of China, which was in turn historically associated with social and political exile. Yuan poetry of death and destruction (sangluan) One genre of Classical Chinese poetry is known as sangluan (): this is a genre of verse associated with the poetry of the Yuan Dynasty which thematically has to do with the devastation of war and its associated death and disorders, specifically regarding the violent and tumultuous events leading up to and occurring during the course of the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty by Kublai Khan.

History  The RM of Mountain View No. 318 incorporated as a rural municipality on December 13, 1909. Its incorporation was triggered by a petition compiled by a municipal committee and sent to the Municipal Commissioner for Saskatchewan on May 19, 1909. It asked for the authority to proceed with an election whereby local residents would vote on whether to proceed with the establishment of an official RM. At the same time, a list of potential names for the RM was submitted. In all there were seven suggestions including Glengarry, Bramley and Newbury but it was the name Mountain View that prevailed. Prior to incorporation, the area was known as the Mountain View Local Improvement District (No. 16-N-3). Councillors elected to the Local Improvement District included: *Division 1: Charles T. Ramsey; *Division 2: Frank Cutten; *Division 3: Alex Walker; *Division 4: William J. Heatherington (Chairman); *Division 5: D. Dubrueil; and *Division 6: M. J. McMillan. Charles Lawrence, Notary Public, Berkshire Farm, of Wiggins was Secretary-Treasurer. On June 15, 1909, the Municipal Commissioner agreed to hold elections for the new RM on July 20, 1909. 52 voters turned out that day to cast their ballots. The results of the election were clear. 36 people voted in favour of establishing a new RM, while 16 people voted against the proposal. A letter dated August 16 from the Deputy Municipal Commissioner officially established the RM of Mountain View No. 318 on December 13, 1909. In the early years of the RM, large areas of land in the municipality were taken up by large farms. The Engen farm of 1909 contained 9 sections; the Lamborn farm of 1910 contained 5 sections (sold later to a group of Mennonite settlers in 1925) and the Bellamy farm of 1912 contained 17 sections. The Engen and Bellamy farms were later broken up into smaller farms. Now history is reversing itself; the smaller farms are being taken over by larger farming units.  Geography  The RM is drained by Eagle Creek which flows in a southeasterly direction. The valley of this creek is approximately one mile wide, and in most places is more than 100 feet deep. The ground surface on the uplands varies from gently undulating to quite hilly. The elevations a long the valley vary from approximately 1,950 feet at Lake Opuntia to 1,900 feet where the stream leaves the municipality. The elevation rises to the southwest and northeast of the valley. A portion of the area is mantled by moraine deposits. The remainder of the area is covered by glacial till or boulder clay. = Communities and localities = The following unincorporated communities are within the RM. ;Special service areas *Herschel (restructured to hamlet, December 31, 2006) ;Localities *Downe *Glenellen *Kingsland *Stranraer (dissolved as a village)  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the RM of Mountain View No. 318 recorded a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census of Population, the RM of Mountain View No. 318 recorded a population of , a change from its 2006 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  Economy  With the coming of the homesteaders, the plough turned land that once produced grass to support vast herds of plains bison, now it has become some of the best agricultural land in Saskatchewan. This is due in part to the RM being located in the Dark Brown Soil Region of the province. This has resulted in very high wheat yields over the years. There is also an abundance of good ranch land in the RM as the fertile flat land in the middle of the municipality is bordered on the north by the Bear Hills and on the south by the Bad Hills. The hill regions of the area are idea for grazing livestock. Today, agriculture is the primary economic activity in the RM. In the 1930s soft coal began to be mined a small valley just south of Herschel, which lead to the valley being named, the Coal Mine Ravine. Today the ravine is no longer mined for coal but it is home to the Ancient Echoes Interpretive Centre, several archaeological sites, as well as being home to several endangered species of plants and the remains of a former First Nations/Metis/pioneer Red River Cart trail.

Built in 1795, it was the city's first tavern located on the eastern side of the Passagassawakeag River, and is a well-preserved example of vernacular Federal period architecture. The building, now a private residence, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The building known in the 19th century as the Black Horse Tavern stands on the north side of Searsport Avenue (United States Route 1), near the mouth of the Passagassawakeag River and between Old Searsport Avenue and Stephenson Lane. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style house, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. Its main facade faces roughly east, and the main entrance, located at the center, has no trim. A single-story ell, a 20th-century replacement for an older ell, extends to the north, with two gabled dormers projecting from the roof. The interior of the main house is well preserved, with wide pine wainscoting, large fireplaces in both front rooms, with simple vertical-board partitions in the rear. Original doors and frames are still generally in use. The house was built about 1795 by Jerome Stephenson, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who moved to Belfast in 1784. Stephenson was prominent in local civic affairs, serving as selectman in 1785. Although he built the house for his family, he converted it into a tavern in 1800, a role it fulfilled under is son and grandson, until about 1852. The sign used to identify the tavern is now stored in the house.

The first book, Witch was released in 2002 through Simon Pulse. In 2009 the series was optioned by DreamWorks' Mark Sourian, with the intent to combine the first two books in the series into a single screenplay. Witch & Curse The five novels depict a family feud between a coven of witches called the Cahors and a coven of warlocks called the Deveraux. In Witch, Holly Cathers, the main character, is the lone survivor of the rafting trip her family took with her best friend, and later receives a small cat who is deaf, Bast. After her parents die, her aunt and uncle that she never knew of get custody of her. Bizarre incidents occur to Holly, such as strange visions and dreams. Eventually, Holly realizes she is a witch and that she carries the soul of Isabeau of the Cahors house. Holly belongs to the Cahor house and reveals this to Amanda. Bast (Holly's), Hecate (Nicole's), and Freya (Amanda's) become the three girls cat familiars. However, Nicole already knew a little about witchcraft due to her boyfriend, Eli. When Holly's aunt dies, they are left in the custody of her uncle, Richard. Nicole is performing as Juliet in their school play and suddenly a fire starts. Holly and her cousins discover that Michael and his son, Eli are behind this. Michael is a warlock of House Deveraux. He had an affair with Holly's aunt, Marie-Claire Anderson and was the one who killed her. Jeraud (Jer), Michael's other son attempts to stop him with his girlfriend and his two best friends. Jer carries with him the spirit of his ancestor Jean. Jer and Holly have a strange connection due to the ancestors that they carry with them and at a party they almost fell into bed with one another. At the party though, all three cousins receive a strange burn-like birthmark on their hands, marking them as the Three Ladies of the Lily of the Cahors family. Jean and Isabeau were once married to try to form a connection and truce between the two feuding families, but it backfired as the two lovers had to betray the other, setting forth a Romeo and Juliet type of reincarnation cycle. Jer saves Holly from being burned, but her cousins drag her away before she can save Jer. In the end of Witch, Jer is burned and horribly scarred. And then Curse begins.

D'Appolito initially configured his design using a 3rd order (18 dB/oct or 60 dB/dec) crossover, D'Appolito has since amended this original recommendation in favor of 4th order topology. However, this does not impart any significant effect on the MTM design's unique characteristics. There are speakers where the tweeter appears below the larger driver and though electrically it is identical to the MT configuration, it is customarily denoted as \\"TM\\". The only other difference is the lobe tilt which is exactly the opposite of the MT configuration. The direction in which the lobe tilts (i.e., the vertical orientation or angle of the lobe) is a function of the difference or offset between the acoustic centers of the two drivers.  Lobe tilting of MT or TM configurations  Since it is rare for a tweeter and mid- range (or woofer) to have their diaphragms or acoustic centers in the same physical plane, it follows that sound waves emitted by them (of the same frequency) will not reach a particular listening position in the on-axis plane at the same time. Conversely, the MT or TM combination's on-axis plane is not coincident with the physical on-axis plane - it is tilted w.r.t. the physical plane. The overall effect is that at the crossover frequency (when both drivers are reproducing the same frequency) the sound from both drivers does not acoustically sum ideally at the on-axis listening position. There will, however, be some off-axis listening position where the acoustic sum is ideal - but the listening position itself may be such that it is not practical. Thus, with a typical TM or MT loudspeaker where the drivers are not time-aligned, the main lobe is tilted away from the horizontal. \\"Article by Rane discussing the Linkwitz-Riley crossover, time-alignment, lobing and correction of lobe tilt in TM or MT speaker configurations.\\" Lobing pattern of a typical TM speaker without time-alignment The above image shows the lobing pattern of a typical TM loudspeaker. As can be seen, the lobe tilts downwards towards P' which is not the same as the on-axis listening position P. This is one of the reasons for physically offsetting the mid-range and tweeter such that the tweeter is physically behind the mid-range, or tilting the speaker upwards, to achieve an on-axis response that is coincident with the physical on-axis plane. This process is known as time-alignment. Other ways to time-align are to introduce a phase shift in the tweeter signal (lag or lead, depending upon the offset between the drivers) so that it mimics the physical offset. All these methods, however require some amount of measurement and effort to get right.  The MTM alternative  Lobing pattern of a MTM speaker When another mid-range or midwoofer is added vertically and symmetrically opposite to the existing one, the result is that the tilted on-axis plane gets corrected such that the differences between the midwoofer and tweeter planes become immaterial - the on-axis plane is always w.r.t. the tweeter's center. \\"Biro Technology article showing lobe correction with MTM loudspeaker configuration, and other analyses\\" This of course requires that the two midwoofers are in exactly the same plane, and exactly the same distance from the tweeter - which is much easier to do physically. There is however a price to pay for this - although the MTM's on-axis response is near perfect, its radiation pattern or main lobe is much narrower than that of the MT or TM configuration's. As a result, the off-axis response (i.e., response at locations vertically away from exactly opposite the tweeter) is much weaker and there can be obvious and discernible change in tonality at the crossover as one's listening height relative to the tweeter changes, and the effect is perceived more as the listener moves closer to the loudspeaker. This is corrected by (1) mounting the midwoofers as close to the tweeters as possible (so that the listening distance is much larger than the distance between the drivers) and (2) operating the midwoofers and tweeter in quadrature, i.e., achieved by ensuring that the tweeter lags the midwoofer by 90¬∞ in phase at the crossover frequency, and this in turn can be achieved if the crossover has a 3rd order Butterworth characteristic. To achieve the smallest distance between the mids and tweeters requires the drivers to have the smallest possible size - but there are design limitations to this (lowest mid-range frequency, for example, will place a lower limit to the mid's diameter). Another problem with the MTM configuration is the interaction between the two midwoofers. For any frequency (over the operating range of the midwoofers), the off-axis response exhibits different lobing patterns because of the vertical distance between the midwoofers, and as a function of the frequency and horizontal distance from the speaker. At any off-axis listening position, although both midwoofers operate in phase (are time-aligned), the waves from each reach the listening position at different times (and therefore have a relative phase difference) - at frequencies where the time displacement between the two midwoofers corresponds to one-half of one wavelength, the outputs of the two midwoofers will null. \\"Biro Technology article, section 3\\" However, the time displacement itself is a function of the distance from the speaker and frequency, which means that the lobing for a given listening distance and off-axis position will be different at different frequencies. Since the basic reason for this is the distance between the midwoofers, again the solution is to use as small drivers as possible, placed as close as possible. With this, for listening distances much greater than the distance between the drivers the lobing effects are much less obvious.

Background Born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Peter Wegner earned his BA at Yale University. He works in multiple media, ranging from paintings and photography to large-scale installations and wall works. His pieces are included in major public and private collections worldwide. He currently lives and works in Berkeley, California.  Themes  Critics and scholars have identified at least four major themes in Wegner's work. The first is the idea of systems and their hidden inadequacies. As architectural scholar Noah Chasin wrote in a 2007 essay, \\"Systems often make appearances in Wegner's work to suggest the potential for order, yet the artist continually exposes them as means of introducing disorder‚Ä¶ [H]e systematically questions their foundations from within so that the very integrity of each system's signifying capacity is compromised‚Ä¶.\\" Wegner himself embraces this idea, even when it comes to classifying the media in which he operates. His official bio states that \\"[h]e often works between conventional categories, creating sculptural paintings, painterly installations, and architectural photographs.\\" However, Chasin advises viewers to see this aspect of the artist's approach as a constructive rather than a destructive one: ‚ÄúWe should not conclude that Wegner‚Äôs subversion eliminates meaning but instead that it draws our attention to the way that meaning is created and naturalized.‚Äù Another core theme in Wegner's work is color. Professor, author, and critic Eve Meltzer noted in a 2002 review that ‚Äúcolor may be the‚Ä¶ center‚Äù of his entire practice. Poet and essayist John Koethe also described Wegner as \\"obsessed with color.\\" The artist first began deconstructing the subject in the late 1990s with his \\"Remarks on Color\\" series, which used commercial paint chip samples as their starting point. Yet analysts (and Wegner himself) have pointed out that, for the artist, color is often a path to other topics. His color-based \\"D65\\" series, begun in 2014, takes its title from \\"the standard scientific shorthand for the color of daylight, roughly 6500 degrees Kelvin\\" and is \\"inspired by sunlight in California,\\" according to Wegner. More than a decade earlier, Meltzer linked his use of color with market mechanisms. She wrote of the paint chip works that \\"there is always the problem of capital and its ideological effects. After all the paint chip is an advertising tool‚Äîa ploy to make a buck on a dream. Wegner's work makes these systems palpable, not through barefaced institutional critique, but by quietly elbowing some room into their rigid structures or‚Äîas he says in his book The Other Today Is the One You Want (2002)‚Äîby ‚Äòopen[ing] up the space between the lines‚Äô and ‚Äòpush[ing] back the horizon.‚Äô\\" A third theme identified in Wegner's work is language. Meltzer writes that Wegner's paint chip pieces beg the question: ‚ÄúHow can so many shades of red claim the same name when, clearly, language‚Äôs system of difference can‚Äôt fracture fast enough or splinter small enough to cover the range?‚Äù In a 2007 essay, curator Henriette Huldisch observed that Wegner ‚Äúrepeatedly invokes language specifically to create associations, to link his works back to the world of ideas and things from which they originated: systems of classification, names of places, and the incidental items of our daily lives (rulers, billboards, contracts, and so on).‚Äù Huldisch goes on to describe how ‚ÄúWegner also work[s] as a bibliophile collagist, appropriating snippets of marketing jargon, then cutting and pasting the functional epithets into semi-accidental verse he terms ‚Äòpoetry written by commerce.‚Äô\\" A fourth theme identified by experts is Wegner's engagement with architecture. For example, in his photography series \\"Buildings Made of Sky,\\" Wegner reverses urban streetscapes to reveal how skyscrapers shape the open-air spaces between one another into skyscraper-like forms of their own. Chasin described a 2004 piece from the series in these terms: ‚ÄúA magical reversal thereby takes place: the physical buildings read visually as a darkened background offset by architectural contours from startling blue-hued visions of skyscrapers carved from atmosphere. Sky becomes building; building, sky‚Äîor to invoke K. Michael Hays in a different context, ‚Äònot architecture but evidence that it exists.‚Äô‚Äù Wegner has also often pushed the construction of his works in an architectural direction, presenting paintings in the form of leaning columns, complex lattices, and multi-layered scrims. Huldisch noted that ‚Äú[h]is stacks, grids, and lattice structures reveal both an interest in the forms of Minimalism and a rejection of the stringent doctrine that predicated them.\\" Yet Wegner does all of the above with a sense of light-heartedness. As he states in a 2007 interview, \\"I‚Äôd like the humor of the work to make itself available to you slowly, so that maybe a couple hours after you‚Äôve been exposed to it, it's still sinking in. You‚Äôre not actually laughing until the second or third day, and by that time, you can't quite remember what was funny.\\"  Key works  Wegner's early work focuses on everyday artifacts embedded in popular culture, including typography specimens (the basis for the \\"American Types\\" series), commercial paint chips (in the \\"Remarks on Color\\" series), and security envelopes (in the \\"Security\\" series). When asked in an interview about his interest in such mundane subjects, he answered, \\"The world is ravishing. Even when you‚Äôre focused on nothing, it's almost too much.\\" From roughly the mid-1990s to early 2000s, he gave form to these ideas in discrete objects such as paintings, works on paper, and artist's books. However, beginning in the mid-2000s, Wegner's practice expanded to include large-scale site-specific installations. The first of these was \\"COMPLETE & FINAL COLOR THEORY SUPERSEDING ALL PREVIOUS THEORIES & PRE-EMPTING ALL FUTURE THEORIES WITH ADD‚ÄôL THOUGHTS ON THE POETRY OF COMMERCE, THE CRUELTY OF SYSTEMS & THE BANALITY OF THE GRID, ACCOMPANIED BY A FOOTNOTE RE: ARCHITECTURE‚Äù at New York's Bohen Foundation in 2004. The installation included monumental paint chip-based paintings and sculptures made from colored paper, either stacked vertically or arrayed in horizontal, hedge-like rows. Wegner followed in 2005 with \\"Lever Labyrinth,\\" a human-scale maze composed of 2.2 million sheets of stacked paper‚Äì‚Äìall in various shades of green, creating columns of subtly gradating color‚Äì‚Äìconstructed inside the Lever House building. In 2008, Wegner executed the major paper installation \\"GUILLOTINE OF SUNLIGHT, GUILLOTINE OF SHADE\\" at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The piece consisted of 1.4 millions sheets of die-cut paper in 40 hues, arranged to create two 12‚Äô x 26.5‚Äô x 7\\" color gradations inside the museum: a wall progressing from blue to yellow in one gallery, and a wall progressing from yellow to red in another. Around this same time, Wegner introduced two new elements into his work: time and neon. He combined both in 2007 to create ‚ÄúTHE UNITED STATES OF NOTHING,‚Äù which included time-controlled neon signage showing the name, latitude, and longitude of every U.S. city that invokes the concept of nothingness. Wegner arranged each neon unit according to its relative geography on a midnight blue-painted wall meant to stand in for the continental U.S. = Stanford University commission = Stanford University commissioned Wegner to create four permanent installations on the campus of its Graduate School of Business. In a Los Angeles Times feature on the works, arts writer Jori Finkel noted, that it was \\"an unusual project in many ways. Most public art is inserted into a landscape after the fact, but Wegner's artworks were integrated into the campus‚Ä¶ And though most university art tends to be committee-sanctioned or boring, Wegner's suite of works for Stanford are thought-provoking in ways that his supporters have come to expect.\\" Completed in 2011, the quartet includes two kinetic works and two static works. The kinetic pieces include \\"WAYS TO CHANGE\\" and \\"MONUMENT TO CHANGE AS IT CHANGES.\\" The former is a wall-sized (171\\" x 216\\" x 8\\") glass, steel, and LED display depicting hundreds of adverbs programmed to illuminate in pre-determined groupings on a continuous 90-minute loop. Finkel mentions that it was \\"built into the fa√ßade of an auditorium that had to be redesigned and re-permitted to accommodate its weight and behind- the-scenes apparatus,\\" and that the work \\"could be seen to question the business school's‚Äîor business world's‚Äîemphasis on productivity. ‚ÄòIt raises the question not of what you are doing, but how you are doing it,‚Äô says the artist.\\" ‚ÄúMONUMENT TO CHANGE AS IT CHANGES\\" is an enormous (108\\" x 384\\" x 3\\") array of \\"flip-digit\\" modules of the variety used to announce arrivals and departures in European train stations‚Äì‚Äìexcept instead of digits, each module contains 80 cards individually screenprinted a different solid color. Wegner then programmed the entire array to animate through a continuous eight-hour cycle of constantly changing patterns. Wegner tells Finkel in the Times feature, \\"The train signage arrives at a particular destination [visually], just as you would in a train, somewhere that's specific and recognizable. The way I've programmed the board there's never a moment of stasis or arrival‚Äîit's perpetual arrival.\\" The two works static works in the commission are both outdoor installations. \\"MONUMENT TO THE UNKNOWN VARIABLES\\" consists of the bracketed variables \\"[x]\\" and \\"[y]\\" formed into sets of wood and steel benches measuring 216\\" x 200\\" x 30\\" each. Finkel notes that \\"[t]hey could be read as a very short concrete poem about uncertainty. They are also for sitting on.\\" The last work, \\"MONUMENT TO THE FUTURE OF DREAMS,\\" is a large (32\\" x 44\\" x 4\\") upright stone tablet placed at the campus's entrance and inscribed with the message, \\"DEDICATED TO THE THINGS THAT HAVEN'T HAPPENED YET AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT TO DREAM THEM UP‚Ä¶.\\" Describing the genesis of the piece, Wegner tells Finkel that he \\"started thinking about what cornerstones signify‚Äîusually the moment of completion for a project. But what if instead of looking back over your shoulder, you were looking ahead?\\" = Later works = Wegner's next permanent installation after the Stanford commission was \\"HELL-WHISKEY-GUNS- MUD-MICHIGAN,\\" completed in 2014 for Michigan State University. Similar to \\"THE UNITED STATES OF NOTHING\\" and \\"WAYS TO CHANGE,\\" it uses an LED display to continuously cycle through pre-programmed groupings of text. Their subject matter is the placenames and GPS coordinates of various locations in Michigan, which Wegner divides into categories such as verbs, colors, and historical figures; the program lasts two full hours before repeating, and the LEDs are partially covered by glass and wood veneer. In 2014, Wegner also began concentrating on creating individual paintings again. His \\"Color Wheel\\" and \\"D65\\" series focus on color relationships played out over ring-shaped, wall mounted MDF in various diameters.

Engineers at Google (primarily Paul Menage and Rohit Seth) started the work on this feature in 2006 under the name \\"process containers\\". In late 2007, the nomenclature changed to \\"control groups\\" to avoid confusion caused by multiple meanings of the term \\"container\\" in the Linux kernel context, and the control groups functionality was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 2.6.24, which was released in January 2008. Since then, developers have added many new features and controllers, such as support for kernfs in 2014, firewalling, and unified hierarchy. cgroup v2 was merged in Linux kernel 4.5 with significant changes to the interface and internal functionality.  Versions  There are two versions of cgroups. Cgroups was originally written by Paul Menage and Rohit Seth, and mainlined into the Linux kernel in 2007. Afterwards this is called cgroups version 1. Then development and maintenance of cgroups was taken over by Tejun Heo. Tejun Heo redesigned and rewrote cgroups. This rewrite is now called version 2, the documentation of cgroups-v2 first appeared in Linux kernel 4.5 released on 14 March 2016. Unlike v1, cgroup v2 has only a single process hierarchy and discriminates between processes, not threads.  Features  One of the design goals of cgroups is to provide a unified interface to many different use cases, from controlling single processes (by using nice, for example) to full operating system-level virtualization (as provided by OpenVZ, Linux-VServer or LXC, for example). Cgroups provides: ; Resource limiting : groups can be set to not exceed a configured memory limit, which also includes the file system cache ; Prioritization : some groups may get a larger share of CPU utilization or disk I/O throughput ; Accounting : measures a group's resource usage, which may be used, for example, for billing purposes ; Control : freezing groups of processes, their checkpointing and restarting  Use  As an example of indirect usage, systemd assumes exclusive access to the cgroups facility A control group (abbreviated as cgroup) is a collection of processes that are bound by the same criteria and associated with a set of parameters or limits. These groups can be hierarchical, meaning that each group inherits limits from its parent group. The kernel provides access to multiple controllers (also called subsystems) through the cgroup interface; for example, the \\"memory\\" controller limits memory use, \\"cpuacct\\" accounts CPU usage, etc. Control groups can be used in multiple ways: * By accessing the cgroup virtual file system manually. * By creating and managing groups on the fly using tools like \`cgcreate\`, \`cgexec\`, and \`cgclassify\` (from \`libcgroup\`). * Through the \\"rules engine daemon\\" that can automatically move processes of certain users, groups, or commands to cgroups as specified in its configuration. * Indirectly through other software that uses cgroups, such as Docker, Firejail, LXC, libvirt, systemd, Open Grid Scheduler/Grid Engine, and Google's developmentally defunct lmctfy. The Linux kernel documentation contains some technical details of the setup and use of control groups version 1 and version 2.https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/admin- guide/cgroup-v2.rst \`systemd- cgtop\`https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-cgtop.html command can be used to show top control groups by their resource usage.  Redesign  Redesign of cgroups started in 2013, with additional changes brought by versions 3.15 and 3.16 of the Linux kernel. = Namespace isolation = While not technically part of the cgroups work, a related feature of the Linux kernel is namespace isolation, where groups of processes are separated such that they cannot \\"see\\" resources in other groups. For example, a PID namespace provides a separate enumeration of process identifiers within each namespace. Also available are mount, user, UTS, network and SysV IPC namespaces. * The PID namespace provides isolation for the allocation of process identifiers (PIDs), lists of processes and their details. While the new namespace is isolated from other siblings, processes in its \\"parent\\" namespace still see all processes in child namespaces‚Äîalbeit with different PID numbers. * Network namespace isolates the network interface controllers (physical or virtual), iptables firewall rules, routing tables etc. Network namespaces can be connected with each other using the \\"veth\\" virtual Ethernet device. * \\"UTS\\" namespace allows changing the hostname. * Mount namespace allows creating a different file system layout, or making certain mount points read-only. * IPC namespace isolates the System V inter-process communication between namespaces. * User namespace isolates the user IDs between namespaces. * Cgroup namespacehttps://lkml.org/lkml/2016/3/26/132/ Namespaces are created with the \\"unshare\\" command or syscall, or as new flags in a \\"clone\\" syscall. The \\"ns\\" subsystem was added early in cgroups development to integrate namespaces and control groups. If the \\"ns\\" cgroup was mounted, each namespace would also create a new group in the cgroup hierarchy. This was an experiment that was later judged to be a poor fit for the cgroups API, and removed from the kernel. Linux namespaces were inspired by the more general namespace functionality used heavily throughout Plan 9 from Bell Labs. = Unified hierarchy = Kernfs was introduced into the Linux kernel with version 3.14 in March 2014, the main author being Tejun Heo. One of the main motivators for a separate kernfs is the cgroups file system. Kernfs is basically created by splitting off some of the sysfs logic into an independent entity, thus easing for other kernel subsystems the implementation of their own virtual file system with handling for device connect and disconnect, dynamic creation and removal, and other attributes. Redesign continued into version 3.15 of the Linux kernel. = Kernel memory control groups (kmemcg) = Kernel memory control groups (kmemcg) were merged into version 3.8 () of the Linux kernel mainline. The kmemcg controller can limit the amount of memory that the kernel can utilize to manage its own internal processes. = cgroup awareness of OOM killer = Linux Kernel 4.19 (October 2018) introduced cgroup awareness of OOM killer implementation which adds an ability to kill a cgroup as a single unit and so guarantee the integrity of the workload.https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_4.19#Memory_management  Adoption  Various projects use cgroups as their basis, including CoreOS, Docker (in 2013), Hadoop, Jelastic, Kubernetes, lmctfy (Let Me Contain That For You), LXC (LinuX Containers), systemd, Mesos and Mesosphere, and HTCondor. Major Linux distributions also adopted it such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.0 in November 2010, three years later adoption by the mainline Linux kernel.https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en- US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/pdf/6.0_Release_Notes/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux-6-6.0_Release_Notes- en-US.pdf On 29 October 2019, the Fedora Project modified Fedora 31 to use CgroupsV2 by defaulthttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1732114  See also  * Operating system‚Äìlevel virtualization implementations * Process group * Tc (Linux) a traffic control utility that has slight functional overlap with network-oriented cgroup settings  References   External links  * Linux kernel documentation on cgroups * Linux kernel Namespaces and cgroups by Rami Rosen * Namespaces and cgroups, the basis of Linux containers (including cgroups v2), slides of a talk by Rami Rosen, Netdev 1.1, Seville, Spain, 2016 * Understanding the new control groups API, LWN.net, by Rami Rosen, March 2016 * Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg, April 2015, by Abhishek Verma, Luis Pedrosa, Madhukar Korupolu, David Oppenheimer, Eric Tune and John Wilkes * Job Objects, similar feature on Windows Interfaces of the Linux kernel Linux kernel features Operating system security Virtualization-related software for Linux ","title":"Cgroups"},{"id":"28942497","text":"Schelhammera undulata, the lilac lily, is a small plant found in eastern Australia.

The name was coined by Ameghino from a combination of the ' meaning \\"shin\\" and ' meaning \\"a small sheet of paper\\". The etymology of the specific epithet is not clear, but possibly from the '. The genus and species were described from a single partial bone which Ameghino considered to be a tarsometatarsus section. The bone was found in Oligocene (Tinguirirican to Deseadan) beds of the Deseado Formation near San Jorge Gulf in Southern Patagonia.Cruschedula at Fossilworks.org Designated the holotype specimen, it was added to the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum along with a large portion of Ameghino's fossil collections.  Taxonomy  In his paper, Ameghino erected the family Cruschedulidae, however in his 1906 paper \\"Enumeracion de los Impennes Fosiles de Patagonia y de la Isla Seymour\\" he synonymized the family into Cladornithidae. When described Ameghino envisioned the genus and the family Cladornithidae as a whole to have represented a group of extinct \\"dry- land\\" penguins. This was because the fossil, having been collected from an outcrop of the Deseado Formation, was thought to be similar to other penguin fossils Ameghino attributed to the same formation. The Deseado Formation preserved a terrestrial environment, and thus the presence of penguins was considered highly unusual. The placement of Cruschedula as a penguin was not challenged until 1946 by eminent paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson. After examining the holotype, Simpson concluded there were no distinguishable details that defined the bone as from a penguin, but did not have any opinion as to what bird group it may have belonged to. The fossil was again restudied in 1964 by Pierce Brodkorb, who asserted the fossil to not be a tarsometatarsus but rather the end of a scapula. In his Catalogue of Fossil Birds Brodkorb placed the genus into the diurnal bird of prey family Accipitridae. This placement was followed by Simpson in his 1972 Conspectus of Patagonian fossil penguins However, the placement was rejected by Eduardo P. Tonni in his 1980 paper The present state of knowledge of the Cenozoic birds of Argentina where he considered the bone fragment upon which the genus was erected to be undiagnostic. This assessment was supported by Storrs L. Olson in 1985, who quoted Tonni's assessment of the Cruschedula holotype as undiagnostic.

The last time a type CO3 meteorite fell from the sky was in 1937 with Kainsaz, Russia. There are 6 known falls of a CO3 meteorite. Being of the rare carbonaceous subtype, 'meteorite man' Robert Haag stated to the media that this was the most important meteorite fall since the Canadian Tagish Lake fall in January 2000. History =Prelude= The summer of 2006 was the meteorite summer in Norway. The summer was very warm and dry. It was perfect weather to protect the valuable droppings that the skies let fall over Norway. It started in the beginning of June when on the 7th a very large meteor explosion was seen and heard over large areas in northernmost Norway. Although no meteorites was found from that event, its size stirred a whole world of meteorite aficionados and a stunned scientific community in Norway and abroad. Then on the 10th of July it was announced on NRK1, Norway's number one TV channel, that a meteorite had been found in a man's driveway south of Stavanger. The story was soon denounced by the experts as being a plutonic rock from a nearby source. But then, incredible as it was, just four days later the skies opened for a true meteorite fall event. This turned out to be the 13th find of a meteorite in Norway. At the same time its 9th fall. As if this was not enough, at the end of August a very large fireball was seen north from Troms county to south of Bergen, almost along the whole coast of the country, but no meteorites were found. =Fall= At about 10:20 a.m. on the 14th of July a large meteor was seen in broad daylight by a large number of people heading north-northwest over √òstfold county, Norway. It split into 4 or 5 smaller objects. It was seen from a large area extending outwards in all directions from the Oslofjord area, in north limited to roughly Lake Mj√∏sa, in east from √Örj√§ng, Sweden, and in the southwest to the coast area of S√∏rlandet. Over Rygge and Moss a loud explosion and a rumbling sound was heard. A man near his summer cabin in Rygge saw and heard a small piece of stone hit an aluminium sheet about 2 meter away. This was the only directly observed impacting stone from the fall. =Finds= In all there were five separate findsMoss-Avis (newspaper): About first stone, 36.7gMoss-Avis (newspaper): About second stone, 752gMoss-Avis (newspaper): About fifth stone, 676g of the Moss CO3.6 meteorite. They distributed over a strewnfield about long from southeast in Rygge to northwest in parts of north Moss. The largest find, the main mass, was in several tens of pieces, part of it being smashed while hitting a fence. It was almost in weight. The total weight of all the finds was over . Classification and scientific studies Moss slice Several scientific papers have come out on the closer study of the meteorite. The first preliminary study of August 2006 showed that it contains numerous small chondrules, most <0.2mm and small <1mm amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs) and small CAIs (calcium aluminium inclusions). It also contains isolated grains of olivine, troilite and kamacite in a gray matrix. It has been classified as carbonaceous chondrite of type CO3 - Ornans type. Its accepted designation is CO3.6. Its petrologic type 3.6 means that it is only slightly metamorphosed by heating from its original state, but more so than most of the 5 other CO3 falls. Its closest kin of these falls is Ornans, the group type specimen. It contains only about 0.25 percent carbon, some present as organic compounds. Typically benzene, toluene, C2-alkyl benzene and traces of biphenyl, benzonitrile and aliphatic hydrocarbones. The shock stage is S2.

Seventh Regiment Band In 1852, the 7th Regiment Band was organized. A German musical society of the mid-19th century formed the Seventh Regiment Band consisting of forty-two professional German musicians. It was the only exclusively regimental band of the Civil War‚Äìera and one of the most popular brass bands of the time; the band-leader, who went by the name Noll, used brass and reed instruments in duo proportion. In 1860, Claudio S. Grafulla became the band- leader and reorganized the band. He added woodwinds to the band and continued to serve as its director until his death in 1880. The band gained a high reputation under his leadership. He composed and is best remembered for his march, Washington Greys.\\"The President's Own\\" United States Marine Band, Hall of Composers The band was honored in 1922 by John Philip Sousa's The Gallant Seventh march.

Carvalho Jr. (born September 29, 1961) is an American politician and former American football player who served as Mayor of Kauai in Hawaii from December 1, 2008 to December 3, 2018. Carvalho was elected in November 2008 to complete the unexpired term of former Mayor Bryan J. Baptiste, who died in office in June 2008. Biography =Early life= Carvalho was born on Kauai island to Bernard P. Carvalho Sr. and Priscilla Hanohano. He graduated from Kapaa High School in 1979. While in high school, Carvalho was a star athlete in football and basketball. Carvalho then enrolled at the University of Hawaii on a full football scholarship. He earned a bachelor's degree in communications and public relations in 1983. Carvalho was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in 1984 shortly after graduating from college. He played in the NFL for the Dolphins for two seasons. He returned to Kauai after leaving the Dolphins in order to get married. Carvalho is married to the former Regina \\"Gina\\" Godinez, who is originally from Oceanside, California. The couple have three children, Bronson, Brennan, and Brittney. In addition to his political and football careers, Carvalho has also held positions in the tourism and airline industries on Kauai. =Kauai government= Carvalho was hired by the Kauai Department of Public Works Recreation as an entry level employee in 1985. Former Mayor Bryan J. Baptiste appointed Carvalho as Director of the Offices of Community Assistance in December 2002. He oversaw several Kauai County government agencies, including transportation, housing, recreation, and the elderly. He is credited with the expansion of The Kauai Bus service on the island. In 2007, Mayor Baptiste appointed Carvalho to create and implement the new Kauai Department of Parks and Recreation as its first director. The new department had been authorized by voters in the 2006 Hawaii general election. He remained head of the Department of Parks and Recreation until Mayor Baptiste's death in June 2008. =Mayor of Kauai= Carvalho announced his candidacy for Mayor of Kauai on July 8, 2008, to fill the remaining two years of former Mayor Bryan J. Baptiste's unexpired term. Baptiste had died in office on June 22, 2008. Carvalho made the announcement at the Historic County Building with supporters and members of the Baptiste family, including Baptiste's widow, Annette Baptiste. Carvalho won the nonpartisan mayoral primary with 7,143 votes, or 39.8% of the vote. Former Kauai Mayor JoAnn Yukimura, who has previously served as Mayor of Kauai from 1988 until 1992, also qualified for the general election by finishing in second place with 5,372 votes (29.9%). Mel Rapozo and Rolf Bieber finished in third and fourth place respectively. On November 4, 2008, Carvalho was elected Mayor of Kauai in a special election held to fill the remaining two years of Baptiste's unexpired term in office. Carvalho defeated JoAnn Yukimura in the 2008 election. He was sworn into office in Lihue on December 1, 2008. Carvalho announced his intention to seek a full four-year term in the 2010 mayoral election. Carvalho easily won the nonpartisan mayoral primary election held on September 18, 2010, garnering 13,024 votes, equivalent to 75.7% of the vote. Carvalho's only primary challenger, Diana LaBedz, a substance abuse counselor who campaigned against plastic bottles and genetically modified organisms, came in a distant second in the primary with 2,548 votes, or 14.8%. Under Kauai County law, the two top vote earners in the primary, Carvalho and LaBedz, automatically advance to the mayoral general election. Bernard Carvalho faced opponent Diana LaBedz in the mayoral general election on November 2, 2010.

Life and career La Grange was born in Paris, of an American mother (Emily Sloane) and a French father, , who was a senator, one-time government minister, and Vice-President of the International Aviation Federation. Henry-Louis studied the humanities in Paris and New York and literature at Aix-en-Provence University and at the Sorbonne. From 1946 to 1947 he studied at the Yale University School of Music and subsequently, from 1948 until 1953, privately in Paris ‚Äì piano under Yvonne Lef√©bure and harmony, counterpoint, and analysis under Nadia Boulanger. La Grange began working as a music critic in 1952, writing articles for the New York Herald Tribune and The New York Times, and the magazines Opera News, Saturday Review, Musical America, and Opus in the United States, and Arts, Disques, La Revue Musicale, and Harmonie in France. He first heard the music of Gustav Mahler, the Ninth Symphony, on 20 December 1945 at a concert in which Mahler's disciple, Bruno Walter, conducted the New York Philharmonic in its first performance of the work. La Grange had attended the concert because he had become a great admirer of the conductor, but knew very little about Mahler, who at the time was not nearly as well known as he is now. He was surprised at the length of the symphony and its unusual style, and his interest was piqued. Gradually becoming more and more interested, from the early 1950s on he began to seriously investigate Mahler's works and his life. He met Mahler's widow Alma Mahler in 1952, became a close friend of her daughter Anna, and interviewed other contemporaries of the composer. He carried out research in Europe and North America and over time accumulated a collection of materials which became one of the richest existing archives concerning Mahler and his epoch. These documents are now part of a multimedia library, the M√©diath√®que Musicale Mahler, founded in 1986 with Maurice Fleuret as the Biblioth√®que Gustav Mahler. The first volume of his definitive Mahler biography was published by Doubleday (New York) in 1973, and Gollancz (London) in 1974 and received the Deems Taylor Award (U.S. 1974). A revised edition in French was published by Fayard in 1979, followed by two more volumes in 1983 and 1984, the entire series reaching a final length of about 3600 pages. This work was recognized by the Prize for the Best Book on Music awarded by the Syndicat de la critique dramatique et musicale (France 1983), and the Grand Prix de Litt√©rature musicale of the Acad√©mie Charles Cros (France 1984). Subsequently, Oxford University Press started to publish a revised and expanded English 4-volume version of the French 3-volume set, starting with Volume II in 1995 (awarded the Prize of the Royal Philharmonic Society in London), Volume III in 2000, and Volume IV in 2008. The revision of the English Volume I was incomplete at the time of La Grange's death; the work is being completed by his associate, Sybille Werner. The first volume was released in April 2020. Lecturing on Mahler for many years, Henry-Louis de La Grange toured the United States, Canada, England, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Spain, Italy, Morocco and, in the Far East, Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. He spoke at Stanford University, Columbia University, and Indiana University (1974‚Äì81), the University of Geneva (1982), the University of Leipzig, the Juilliard School, the University of California at Los Angeles (1985), Budapest University (1987), the University of Hamburg (1988), the University of Oslo (1993), the Paris Conservatory, as well as the universities in Kyoto, Hong Kong, Wellington, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Boulder, and San Francisco (1998), and taught a DEA seminar at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris (1986). He directed the Festival \\"Les Nuits d'Alziprato\\" in Corsica for five years (1974‚Äì1979), and in the Summer of 1986 the Mahler Festival in Toblach (Dobbiaco, Italy), produced or took part in many broadcasts on radio and television, including 34 two-hour programs on France Musique (Radio) on the life and work of Mahler, six one-hour programs for WGUC (Public Radio) in Cincinnati, U.S.A, and a series of six on Mahler's last years for Radio Suisse Romande. He also collaborated in the conception and production of the first large-scale exhibition on Mahler: \\"Une Oeuvre, une Vie, une Epoque\\" at the Mus√©e d'Art moderne, Paris, in 1985, which attracted over 27,000 visitors, thus breaking all previous records for a musical exhibition. In the same context, he organized two international Mahler symposiums, in Paris and Montpellier. On the occasion of the complete Mahler cycle performed at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris from February to May 1989, he mounted two exhibitions, one at the Ch√¢telet and the other at the Biblioth√®que Gustav Mahler, gave 5 lectures, and organized a symposium at the Sorbonne. Registration and purchase required. Registration and purchase required. La Grange acted as advisor for the Mahler cycle given by the Orchestre National de Lyon from 1991 to 1994 and, in 1999, organized an International Symposium about \\"Irony in Mahler's Music\\" at the University of Montpellier. In 1998, he spent three weeks in San Francisco as guest lecturer for the San Francisco Symphony's \\"Mahler Celebration\\", and he was one of the first European musicologists to lecture about Mahler in Beijing. He toured the United States and Mexico as a lecturer in 2000, and in 2002 he gave four pre-concert talks in Philadelphia and New York for the Philadelphia Orchestra.

It is the fourth episode of the show's seventh season and was broadcast on October 17, 2010. Plot Carlos and Gaby meet the family who raised their biological daughter Grace. Their personalities and looks are astonishingly similar. Both families agree not to tell the girls about what happened and agree on making monthly family visits. We see that Grace is very well taught on how to behave, but Juanita is not. Grace falls in love with Gaby's Chanel purse, so Gaby wants to give her one, but Juanita's real mother, Carmen Sanchez, doesn't accept it. She tells Gaby that Grace is not spoiled and is a modest child. Gaby opens up to Carlos about her argument with Carmen, during which he tells Gaby that she better not drive their daughter's family away because they might take her and never come back. A few days later, when the Sanchez family is at the Solis home, Gaby gives Grace a necklace that she bought at the beginning of her modeling years. The mother and daughter agree to keep that as a secret. Maxine tells Susan that she has sold her business, and the new investors' plan for expansion is heavy marketing in the United States. She tells Susan she has about a month left before their adverstising campaign begins and her activities could be exposed to friends and family. However, the next day while driving, Susan sees that a \\"Va-Va-Va-Broom!\\" billboard is being hung with a screen-capture of her on it. Panicked, she managed to rip down the segment with her face and goes crying to Maxine. Maxine makes a phone call to her new business partners just to find out that Susan must pay them $9,000 for the cost of the billboards if she doesn't want them displayed. Susan is very worried, but Maxine comforts her with telling that \\"Va-Va-Va-Broom!\\" also offers jobs that cross Susan's boundaries, meaning that they involve nudity and maybe pornography. Desperate for help, Susan accepts her offer. Later, a mysterious man, whose face isn't shown, is seen taking the ripped billboard out of the trash and leaving. Penny offers to take care of Paige after seeing that Lynette is very busy and needs help. Lynette takes advantage of Penny's help and one day she goes jogging while she leaves Paige to Penny even though Penny told her that she has a test that day and must hurry to catch the school bus. Later, Lynette arrives at home and finds no one in it, so she hurries to Penny's school where she is called to the principal. The principal tells her that Penny even took the baby monitor before she went to sleep and got up earlier to feed her baby sister, and as a result she is exhausted. Lynette talks to Penny and finds out that she loves it when Lynette spends more time with her, so she tells Tom to hire a nanny so she can be the mom she used to be. Renee ruins Bree's date with Keith by calling Danielle with her son Benjamin, Bree's grandson, to come visit Bree, just so Keith would find out that Bree is a grandmother.

That distance is no longer run in high school competition since the NFHS converted to metric distances in 1980, but it is still an international record event. Her record lasted over 30 years until it was surpassed on January 26, 2013 by Mary Cain, indoors, running 4:32.78 at the New Balance Games. Cain later improved her own mark to 4:28.25, also indoors at the Millrose Games. Because Cain's marks were set on an indoor track, which is generally considered to be more difficult, they were not recognized by Track and Field News the ratifier of high school records in non-NFHS sanctioned events (high school athletes in open competition), so Plumer retains the record as published. Christine Babcock, born 8 years and 3 days after Plumer's record, running for Woodbridge High School, also in Irvine, took the record in the more commonly run but shorter 1600 meters to an equitable 4:33.82 in 2008. Babcock's record was improved to 4:33.29 in 2014 by Alexa Efraimson. A couple of weeks after setting the record, Plumer won her third consecutive championship in the 1600 metres at the CIF California State Meet. Only Kira Jorgensen has duplicated that feat. Plumer's state meet record of 4:39.82 stood for 25 years, from 1982 to 2007, until being beaten by Babcock. The University High School team of that time has been considered one of the best high school teams ever assembled. In 1981, Plumer was part of the team's course record at Mt. SAC, the most commonly used course in Southern California, that stood for two decades. The team, including Plumer, Laura Sauerwein, Judy McLaughlin and Teresa Barrios continue to hold the national high school record for the 4x1500 meters relay at 18.52.5, set during the Mt. SAC Relays in 1982. Her older sister is PattiSue Plumer, who ran collegiately for Stanford University. After high school, Polly Plumer ran for UCLA, winning multiple All American Honors, despite suffering serious injuries and illnesses. She ran in the 3000 metres at the 1988 Olympic Trials, finishing 10th in her heat, and the 1992 Olympic Trials, finishing 12th in her semi final in the 1500 and 10th in her semifinal in the 3000. Each time she ran in the trials, her sister also ran and qualified for the Olympic team in those events. The alliterative nature of both their names and their competition in the same events has led to confusion amongst some spectators. Polly is blonde, while PattiSue has darker hair.

Professional tour tennis is played globally with one season consisting of one calendar year. Several tournaments are held each week as players win prize money and earn ranking points. A player's ranking determines her or his ability to enter a particular tournament, as tournaments vary in the amount money and points obtainable. Winning a tournament typically requires winning four to six matches in succession, generally a match a day, as play is single- loss elimination. Current professional tour tennis Currently professional male tennis players compete in one of three tours, while there are two tours for female pro players. The highest level of tour tennis is the ATP World Tour and the WTA Tour, for men and women respectively. The ATP World Tour is integrated with the second tier ATP Challenger Tour and the third tier ITF Men's Circuit, as a single, unified global ranking system is kept, the ATP Rankings. For women, a player's results on both the WTA Tour and ITF Women's Circuit determine her WTA Ranking. Female players are free to play in events in either tour, although top-ranked players almost always play just in WTA Tour events. In fact, they are obliged to appear in certain of the most prestigious tournaments and in a certain number of these during the year or face being penalized by the tour. The same is true of male players. For singles tennis, both men and women ranked outside of the world top 40 or so and inside the top 180 or so will compete in both the top and second tier tour events. For male players, those ranked outside of the top 180 will then compete on both the ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Men's Circuit, while most players ranked outside the top 400 or so must compete on the ITF Men's Circuit. (A few players, despite their ranking, have a certain personal stature that allows them to be granted wild cards into tournaments. It may be that they were once ranked higher or have a certain level of fame, either globally or where the tournament is being held.) A ranking cut-off is maintained that varies for each tournament - players ranked above the cut-off gain direct entry in that event's main draw while players ranked below it yet above a second cut-off gain entry into a qualifying tournament for the main draw. In singles tennis, such a player typically needs to win two or three qualifying matches to qualify for entry into the main draw. Matches are nearly always contested best two-of-three sets. Tiebreaks are the norm in deciding sets level at six games apiece. A typical tournament in any tier main draw for singles consists of 32 entrants, while the ATP 1000 events feature 58. For doubles, generally 16 teams compete and matches tied at one set each are settled by match tiebreaks. A few tournaments, notably the season-ending championship, feature round-robin play where players play initially in a mini- league instead of in the typical single-loss elimination. Generally in such events however, the final few rounds are still played in the typical knock-out format. The ATP and WTA tours generally hold more than one tournament each week, while the ITF circuits, which oversees several events weekly, hold a few events during the month of December, the top tier tours' off-season. =Grand slam play= Grand slam tournament play is unique in that, for men, matches are best three of five sets, and that both female and male players do not play singles (or doubles) matches in consecutive days, barring inclement weather or other unforeseen scheduling issues. The fields are expanded as one hundred twenty-eight singles players and 64 doubles teams are featured in the main draws. Previous world tennis tours =Men's= Prior to 1990 professional men's tour tennis consisted of two competing tennis circuits, the Grand Prix tennis tour and World Championship Tennis. This was particularly true during the 1970s, when tour tennis was started in its current format - previous to this, during the 1930s through to the 1960s, touring professional players tended to play exhibition matches instead of tournaments, as they were given appearance money instead of prize money. This changed most significantly with the advent of open tennis, being in 1968. By 1973, computer rankings were established for singles tennis. (Computer rankings for doubles tennis was begun in the early 1980s.) By the 1980s, the Grand Prix tour was the main men's tennis tour, while WCT events were in certain years even part of the Grand Prix circuit. In 1990, all top tier tour events became part of the ATP Tour as the Association of Tennis Professionals took control of professional tour tennis from the ITF's Men's Tennis Council. Challenger tournaments were begun in 1978 and initially were separate events that did not comprise a unified tour. At some point the ATP Challenger Series was formed, the precursor to today's ATP Challenger Tour. Futures tennis tournaments were started by the ITF in the late 1990s. Over time these one-week events replaced satellite tournaments, a mini-circuit typically held over a four-week period at one location. By 2007 satellite events were entirely phased out on the ITF Men's Circuit.

Osgood to China as a medical missionary, arriving at Foochow on January 22, 1870. Upon his arrival he began practicing medicine part-time, while putting much of his energy in the study of the Chinese and the Foochow vernacular, and very soon he mastered the language. He established the Foochow Medical Missionary Hospital near Ponasang, where he devoted much of his energy. In 1878 a new fifty-bed hospital at the Peace Street was completed with funds contributed by foreign businessmen and Chinese merchants and officials in Foochow, and the old building was turned into an opium asylum.Carlson, Ellsworth C. (1974): The Foochow Missionaries, 1847-1880 Osgood worked in Foochow for a little more than a decade until his own health broke down in the summer of 1880. During his ten years of labor he had given medical aid to 51,838 patients and about 1,500 opium smokers. On August 17, 1880, Osgood died of sunstroke at a sanitarium on Sharp Peak Island near the mouth of River Min. The day before his death he completed a five-volume translation of a standard work on anatomy into Chinese. Grave Dr. Osgood was buried in the American Mission Cemetery in Foochow, near the corner of the grounds and close to the wall at the right of the cemetery gate. There was a white marble cross at the head, and the grave was surrounded by a black iron chain set in a low granite base. The English inscription on his tombstone read:Lacy, Carleton (1951): The Story of the Foochow Foreign Cemeteries :In the cross of Christ I glory :Dauphin William Osgood :Arrived at Foochow January 22, 1870 :Died at Sharp Peak August 17, 1880 :Erected by the foreign community of Foochow as a token of respects.

The Teatro Goldoni (formerly Teatro San Luca, Teatro Vendramin di San Salvatore) is one of the opera houses and theatres of Venice. Today it is the home of the Teatro Stabile del Veneto. The modern theatre is located near the Rialto Bridge in the historic center of Venice.  History  All the main Venetian theatres were owned by important patrician families; combining business with pleasure in the Italian city with the most crowded and competitive theatrical culture. When most opera in Europe was still being put on by courts, \\"economic prospects and a desire for exhibitionistic display\\", as well a decline in their traditional overseas trading, attracted the best Venetian families to invest in the theatre during the 17th century.Lorenzo Bianconi, Giorgio Pestelli, Lydia G. Cochrane; Opera Production and Its Resources, p.16 ff, 1998, University of Chicago Press, Europe's first dedicated public and commercial opera house was the Teatro Tron from 1637. The Grimani, with whom the Vendramin often inter-married, were dominant, owning what is now called the Teatro Malibran, then called the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as well as the Teatro San Benedetto and other houses. The Veniers owned La Fenice, still the main opera house. =Teatro San Luca= The Vendramin owned the important Teatro di San Luca or Teatro Vendramin or Teatro San Salvatore, founded in 1622 in the San Salvatore, or in Venetian dialect San Salvador district, later renamed the Teatro Apollo, and since 1875 called the Teatro Goldoni, which still thrives as the city's main theatre for plays, now in a building of the 1720s.Teatro Goldoni The Teatro San Luca was rebuilt in the 1720s and renamed the Teatro Apollo. This building survives today. In the age of Carlo Goldoni, the greatest Venetian dramatist, only the San Luca and the Malibran still put on spoken drama, and his desertion of the Grimani for the Vendramins at San Luca in 1752 was a major event in the theatrical history of the period, ushering in perhaps his finest period, in which as well as his comedies, he played a significant role in the development of the opera buffa.Martin Banham, The Cambridge Guide to Theatrep. 433, 1995, Cambridge University Press, The Vendramins, who had considerable direct involvement in the management of the theatre, had a sometimes uneasy relationship with him, arguing over money and the style of his plays, until he left for Paris in 1761, as a result of a dispute with his rival, Carlo Gozzi. However the Vendramin did not take their involvement as far as Vincenzo Grimani, who was a cardinal and opera librettist. The theatre had many changes and renovations due to fire or structural failures. Among them the most important was by architect and set designer Giuseppe Borsato in 1818, and the redecoration of the rooms by Francesco Bagnara, then art director at La Fenice in 1833. In 1826 the theatre had been the first in Italy to install gas lighting. It is a traditional 18th Century Italian theater, with an auditorium in four tiers of boxes and galleries, with a total capacity of 800 seats. The stage is wide and deep with an iron lattice. =Teatro Goldoni= In 1875 during the celebrations of the birth of the playwright the theatre was renamed the Teatro Goldoni at the instigation of Angelo Moro Lin] with the backing Regina De Marchi widow of the Vendramin family. =Teatro Stabile del Veneto \\"Carlo Goldoni\\"= The theatre remained in the hands of the descendants of the Vendramin until 1957. The archives of the Teatro Vendramin', now held in the museum that was Goldoni's house, are increasingly being used by historians. The theatre was closed after the Second World War because it was unsafe, and dispossessed in 1957. After a lengthy restoration and renovation to improve capacity and services it reopened in 1979. The first performance was La Locandiera by Goldoni. The theatre is home to a prose season organized by the Teatro Stabile del Veneto \\"Carlo Goldoni\\", as well as children's theater, opera, concerts, ballets and other events.

Godolphin was the eldest son of Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin and his wife Lady Henrietta Godolphin, n√©e Churchill. His grandparents were the Earl and Countess of Godolphin and the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. In 1712 his father succeeded as 2nd Earl of Godolphin (Lord Godolphin had been promoted in 1706). As heir-apparent to the earldom, William assumed the courtesy title Viscount Rialton. He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge. On 9 June 1720, Hugh Boscawen, the Member of Parliament for Penryn, was raised to the House of Lords as Viscount Falmouth. Lord Rialton was elected to the House of Commons in his place on 24 June 1720, sitting as a Whig. He was related to Lord Falmouth on both his father's and his mother's side, as Falmouth was a grandson of Sir Francis Godolphin and had married Charlotte Godfrey, daughter of Arabella Churchill. Rialton represented Penryn for the remainder of the Parliament and was not re-elected in the general election of 1722. On 16 June 1722 Lord Rialton's maternal grandfather the Duke of Marlborough died, and was succeeded by his daughter Henrietta under a special Act of Parliament. William Godolphin was now heir-apparent to his mother's dukedom as well as his father's earldom, and adopted the higher courtesy title of Marquess of Blandford. He returned to Parliament at the general election of 1727, being elected for Woodstock on 21 August. On 25 April 1729 Lord Blandford married Maria Catherina de Jong, the daughter of Peter de Jong, a mayor of Utrecht. Lady Blandford's sister Isabella was wife of the Earl of Denbigh. On 30 August 1730 he was made an honorary Doctor of Civil Laws by the University of Oxford. Lord Blandford died at Balliol College, Oxford of apoplexy on 24 August 1731. Lord Egmont noted in his diary that this was probably brought on by a drinking bout. As he had no children and no surviving brother, the heir to the Dukedom of Marlborough was now his first cousin the Earl of Sunderland. Lord Sunderland's brother John Spencer was elected to Parliament in Blandford's place on 22 January 1732. The Earldom of Godolphin now had no heir, but Lord Godolphin was granted a barony in 1735 that would allow more distant members of the Godolphin family to succeed. Lady Blandford remarried on 1 June 1734, Harlington, Middlesex, the Tory MP Sir William Wyndham, as his second wife. She was widowed again on 17 June 1740 and died at Sheen on 7 September 1779.

Tavares served as the Mayor of Maui from January 2007 to January 2011. She unsuccessfully sought a second four-year term in office in the 2010 Maui mayoral election. Biography =Early life= Tavares was born in 1943 in Hana, Hawaii, in eastern Maui, to Hannibal and Harriet Tavares. Her father, Hannibal Tavares, served as the mayor of Maui from 1979 until 1991, the longest tenure of any Maui mayor to date. Tavares is the descendant of Japanese and Portuguese immigrants who settled in Hawaii. Her mother, Harriet, is of Japanese descent and her father was of Portuguese descent. She attended both Kaunoa Elementary School and Maul High School, before graduating from St Anthony High School. Tavares earned a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1967. She also received a fifth-year professional diploma in education from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1970. =Career= Tavares worked in Hawaiian public schools as a teacher, counselor and athletic director from 1967 to 1982. She was the program director of the Maui Community College (MCC) Upward Bound program from 1983 to 1989. Tavares served as the director of the Department of Parks and Recreation for Maui County from 1989 to 1995. =Maui County Council= Tavares was first elected to the Maui County Council in 1996. She served on the Council, representing the Upcountry Seat, from 1997 until 2006. She was elected to the Maui County Council in five separate elections. =Mayor of Maui= Tavares was elected mayor of Maui in the 2006 election. She defeated incumbent Mayor Alan Arakawa and was sworn into office on January 2, 2007. Tavares ran for reelection to a second four-year term in 2010. The primary election was held on September 18. Tavares narrowly won, taking 7,307 votes, or 25.4% of the total. She defeated her nearest opponent, former Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa, by 268 votes. Tavares and Arakawa automatically advanced to the general election as the two top vote-getters in the primary. Electric contractor Randy Piltz placed fourth with 5,602 votes (19.4%); Chris Hart placed fifth with 3,035 (10.5%); Maui Council member Sol Kaho'ohalahala came in sixth place with 2,912 votes (10.1%); businessman Marc Hodges placed seventh with 1,761 votes (6.1%). Five other candidates earned a combined 1.5% of the vote. Tavares won 11 of Maui's 39 election precincts in the 2010 primary. Most of these precincts were in Central Maui. Former Mayor Alan Arakawa won 23 precincts in South Maui and West Maui. Tavares faced Arakawa in the general election on November 2, 2010. The election was a rematch of the 2006 Maui mayoral election, in which Tavares defeated Arakawa. Tavares did not fare as well in the rematch, becoming one of the only Democrats in Hawaii to lose reelection to a Republican.

Wilemon campus. It is one of only 91 STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) academies in the state of Texas.http://tea.texas.gov/About_TEA/News_and_Multimedia/Press_Releases/2014/TEA_designates_16_new_T- Stem_Academies/ It was additionally granted Early College High School status in 2009 through a partnership with Navarro College, allowing students to earn an associate degree along with their high school diploma. Recently, as of the start of the 2013-2014 school year, Global High made a partnership with UT Tyler for all the STEM-based college courses offered at Global. As a public charter school, students from Ellis County and surrounding areas can attend regardless of zoning. Many students commute from surrounding cities such as Waxahachie, Red Oak, Ennis, Maypearl, Midlothian, Palmer, Italy, Cedar Hill, and Desoto. Waxahachie Global was named a 2014 \\"Best High School\\" by U.S. News & World Report.https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools Starting in the 2018-19 school year, the Global campus is located in the Billy R. Hancock Building (formerly the Ninth Grade Academy).  Campus  First housed in the T.C. Wilemon campus built in 1917, Global High consists of three levels. A postcard preserved by the McGovern Library hints that the building was originally designed in 1913 to become a sanitarium, a plan that fell through (the building was instead erected inside of a house near the Chautauqua, on the site of what is now Baylor Hospital). The original 1920s wooden flooring is preserved on the second floor and in the auditorium, and the exterior still boasts the original stonework, including an engraved pediment and entrance columns. The architectural aspects of Global's exterior have been richly debated by students and staff alike, and it has been concluded that the building is primarily Federal style, with trace elements of Greek Revival and Split Level stylings. Two additions have been made to the building since its construction. In the mid-1930s, a wing extension in Art Deco style and a gym were built as part of the \\"recovery\\" portion of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal in an effort to create jobs during the Great Depression. Though the floor has been replaced, original wooden bench bleachers remain from the early construction. In the 1960s, the science wing was added through generous private donations. Laminate flooring, a low and long shape, and glass curtain walls and windows set this wing apart from the main building. Over the years, the building has served as the town's primary high school (until 1970), an alternative school, a primary school, and an administrative center interspersed with several years of abandonment before becoming Global. With the opening of a new Waxahachie High School campus in 2018, Global moved to the Billy R. Hancock Building (formerly the Waxahachie Ninth Grade Academy).  Grounds  Global's front and rear flower beds are tended by the Ellis County Master Gardener Association, and use in part a rainwater tank designed by the students as part of their engineering education to irrigate the soil. Global also boasts the start of a community garden in its rear grounds, as well as a courtyard built by the class of 2011, where students are able to eat lunch. On the front lawn are 6 oak trees, planted after the end of World War II in 1945. Many of the men from the then Waxahachie High School had fought in the war between 1941 and 1945. Five oaks were planted to commemorate the bravery of the soldiers who returned, while one live oak was planted to memorialize alumni who never returned. A stone plaque next to the front walkway explains the significance of the oaks.  School structure and graduation requirements  As both a T-STEM academy and Early College High School, Global has a unique structure. Upon passing the Accuplacer tests or earning sufficient TAKS scores, students are fully enrolled in Navarro College. Tuition is paid by the college with no cost to Global families, and as such, qualifying students are encouraged to fully utilize Navarro's resources. In addition to dual credit classes offered during the school day, students may take zero and ninth hour (before and after school) courses on Global's campus, and select evening and summer courses on Navarro's Midlothian or Waxahachie campus. To graduate with an associate degree, students must earn 63 credit hours in select fields mandated by Navarro College. Global students who complete all the required courses in good standing are eligible to receive an Associate's of Science (AS) or an Associate's of Art (AA) degree. Any credit hours earned, regardless of degree completion status, may be transferred to participating four-year universities. This enables even non- degree earning students to transfer a minimum amount of credits to their continuing education without having to pay for the courses. Global offers a variety of upper level science classes, engineering electives, mathematics from Geometry through college Calculus II, and a wide assortment of technical computer courses to fulfill its STEM standing. To fill unique graduation requirements, all students are required to take an engineering course in addition to two technology courses. Other graduation requirements follow the Texas standards. The third pillar of Global's structure is project-based learning. This method teaches teamwork, responsibility, presentation skills, time management and more. Each teacher assigns around 5 projects per school year; often more in the case of engineering and technology courses. Popular projects have included designing math board games in Algebra II, building cardboard furniture in Engineering, creating an island society in World Geography, and filming skits, plays, and music videos for a variety of classes using school provided cameras.  Unique courses  Global's STEM Department hosts a variety of advanced classes: Science- Astronomy, Scientific Research & Design Technology- Computer Applications, Digital & Interactive Media, Animation, Graphic Design, Web Technologies Engineering- Introduction to Engineering & Design, Principles of Engineering, Civil Engineering & Architecture, Aerospace Engineering, Engineering Development and Design and Digital Engineering (discontinued in the 2012-2013 school year). Several dual credit courses offer advanced study opportunities as well. Many students take 2 semesters of college chemistry instead of high school chemistry, and these courses are known as some of the most difficult at the school. Other dual credit science opportunities include Astronomy, Physical Science (college level Earth-Space Science), and Biology. Mathematics extends to Calculus, but instead of the usual AP classes, Global Calculus is dual credit. In some cases, these courses may not be taken during the regular school day, but only during additional class slots (zero/ninth hour, summer, evening, and mini- mester).  Extracurriculars  Waxahachie Global High does not have any UIL- sanctioned sports teams, but has co-oped with the YMCA and formed recreational teams for flag football, basketball, softball, ballroom dance, cheerleading, and volleyball. Past and present academic and social clubs at Global High include TSA, Robotics, DI, Interact, Student Council, Recipe Club, Pro-Life, Bible Study, Gaming Club, Philosopher's Club, Science Club, FCS, Choir, Prom Committee, Gardening Club, Art Club, Quidditch Club, Media Club, and NHS.  Student awards and achievements  Global has produced National Merit Finalists, National Merit Commended Scholars, multiple Technology Student Association National Finalists and qualifiers, Singleton Scholarship awardees, Jack Kilby Prize recipients, over 500 degree-earning early college graduates, a President's Volunteer Service awardee, multiple teams of Destination Imagination National and Global Finalists, camp RYLA attendees, a FIRST Robotics Innovation in Control award, and numerous other state-level competition awards.

Hanley (February 8, 1861 - September 15, 1935), known as Bill Hanley, was a pioneer rancher in Harney County in southeastern Oregon. He owned several ranches between Burns, Oregon and Harney Lake. Together, his properties comprised one of the largest privately owned cattle operations in the United States. Hanley was also a progressive thinker and well known host. Among his personal friends were leading political figures, fellow cattle barons, industrialist, writers, and artists including Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, William Jennings Bryan, Peter French, James J. Hill, CES Wood, and Will Rogers. Hanley's progressive political views led him to run for Governor of Oregon and the United States Senate. A strong advocate of wildlife conservation, much of his ranch is now part of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.  Early life  Bill Hanley was born in Jacksonville, Oregon on February 8, 1861. He grew up tending livestock on his father's farm. In 1879, he moved to Harney County in eastern Oregon with his brother John. His father told the two young men to find a good valley with water and hold on to it. The brothers initially purchased land near Burns. Another brother, Ed, later joined them. After his two brothers moved to Alaska, Hanley acquired the Double O Ranch near Harney Lake for $6 an acre. Over time, Hanley turned it into one of the county's largest cattle ranches. After he was married in 1892, Hanley and his wife Clara made their ranch a showplace for worldly guests who wanted to enjoy the privacy and open space of southeastern Oregon.Jackman, E.

It only covered , but it was widely regarded as one of the finest ranch estates in the western United States. His Double O Ranch was over . At the Double O Ranch, it was from ranch gate to front door of the main house.Friedman, Ralph, \\"William Hanley: A Fine Feeling For Life\\", The Other Side Of Oregon, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, 1993, pp. 173-180.Oregon End of the Trail, Oregon State Board of Control, Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1940, p. 432. Hanley also had access to thousands of acres of public range land. In 1913, The New York Times reported that Hanley's cattle operation covered .\\"Hanley of Harney Lauds His State\\", The New York Times, New York, New York, 23 November 1913. He eventually established the Harney Valley Improvement Company to promote his land interests and encourage the development of Harney County. Hanley normally drove cattle to market four times a year. Each drive covered over , sometimes as much as . He delivered his stock to the railhead at either Huntington, Oregon in southern Baker County or Ontario, Oregon on the Idaho border. Hanley was an expert on selecting routes for his cattle drives. He carefully planned each trip to utilize natural water sources and seasonal grasslands along the way. In Steens Mountain in Oregon's High Desert Country, E. R. Jackman wrote: \\"His riders swore that in all of his drives he never once arrived with fewer cattle than he had at the start.\\" Because he always delivered healthy herds, cattle buyers paid premium prices for Hanley's cattle. During the time he was building his ranch empire, Hanley knew the other powerful eastern Oregon cattle barons well. His peers included Peter French, the driving force behind the French- Glenn Cattle Company and owner of the vast P Ranch; John Devine, the first white settler in Harney County and founder of the White Horse Ranch; and Henry Miller, head of the Miller and Lux Company that controlled over of land in California, Oregon, and Nevada.Jackman, E. R. and John Scharff, Steens Mountain in Oregon‚Äôs High Desert Country, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, Idaho, 1967, pp. 143-148, 156-157, 168-173.  Conservationist  Hanley's property included the lower Silver Creek drainage and several lakes that provided water to irrigate his ranch lands. The ranch's riparian areas, lake shore wetlands, and grassy meadows provided habitat for migratory birds traveling along the Pacific Flyway. A number of natural warm springs made the lakes a winter haven for non-migratory bird as well. Numerous birds including great white egrets, herons, pelicans, wild swans, Canada geese, and many duck species nested on the Double O Ranch. Throughout his life, Hanley was a strong advocate of wildlife conservation. Deer, antelope, beaver, and countless bird species were abundant throughout his ranch lands. His ranches became feeding stops for wild geese during migration seasons. Some geese were so sure of being fed at the Double O Ranch that they made their appetites known by attacking the cookhouse door with their wings until grain was put out for them. Hanley often invited friends to visit the Double O Ranch in the fall just to watch the great flocks of migrating geese and swans. He was also known to have hunters arrested if they were caught shooting birds on Double O property.\\"Bill Hanley\\", The Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 16 September 1935, p. 4.  Sage of Harney County  Bill Hanley was a progressive thinker and homespun philosopher, who became famous for his ranch hospitality. He entertained guests at his Bell A Ranch near Burns or took them to the rustic Double O Ranch to enjoy the outdoors. His guest included prominent politicians, industrialist, literary figures, and artists from all over the United States.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades (Third Edition), Binford and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, p. 245. Hanley counted among his personal friend political leaders with widely divergent views from conservative Republicans like William Howard Taft to populist Democrats like Williams Jennings Bryan. His personal political views were closely aligned with his friend and fellow Bull Moose progressive Theodore Roosevelt. He also included among his close friends business tycoons such as James J. Hill, owner of the Great Northern Railway and well known literary figures like CES Wood, poet Edwin Markham, and painter Childe Hassam.Engeman, Richard H., The Oregon Companion, Timber Press, Portland, Oregon, 2009, p. 168.

Before heading to Alaska on the cross-country flight that took his life, Will Rogers stopped in Burns to refuel his aircraft and to see his friend Bill Hanley. Hanley was a nationally known figure. In 1911, Hanley accompanied a delegation of eight western governors, including Oregon Governor Oswald West, on a trip to New York City. While several of the governors were quoted in The New York Timess report of the visit, Hanley was the center of attention throughout the visit.\\"Show City Wonders to Eight Governors\\", The New York Times, New York, New York, 12 December 1911. During subsequent visits to New York City, The New York Times announced his arrival and published his itinerary, referring to him as a pioneer, philosopher, and one of the most prosperous and influential men on the Pacific Coast. Hanley lobbied his powerful friend, James Hill, to extend his Great Northern railroad system into central Oregon. Eventually, Hill built a north-south rail line along the Deschutes River. The ceremony to drive the last spike was held in Bend, Oregon on 5 October 1911. It is reported in a number of sources that after the final golden spike was driven into the track and removed for display, Hill gave the spike to Hanley, saying: \\"I built this railroad so I could come see you, my friend.\\"\\"Railroad Magnates in Bend at Road‚Äôs Finish\\", The Bend Bulletin (story reprinted from The Bend Bulletin of 11 October 1911), Bend, Oregon, 17 August 1940, p. 6. Hanley was an advocate of progressive government. In 1914, he was the progressive Bull Moose Party's candidate for a United States Senate seat from Oregon. He finished third in a five-person race, doing particularly well in Harney and Malheur counties in rural eastern Oregon and in the state's urban center of Portland. He also ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Oregon, also on a progressive platform. Hanley had been appointed to the Oregon State Highway Commission in 1931, but had to resign in 1933 due to ill health. Hanley died on 15 September 1935, while celebrating Bill Hanley Day at the Pendleton Round-Up. The Round-Up's organizers had invited Hanley to attend a day of rodeo events which were dedicated to the Sage of Harney County. He received rousing cheers and standing ovations at every stop. Shortly after the final event, Hanley suffered a heart attack. He died the next morning at the home of a friend.

Located east of Kodiak Island and reaching to within of the ocean surface, Patton is one of the largest seamounts in the Cobb‚ÄìEickelberg Seamount chain. It was originally created near the coast of Oregon by the Cobb hotspot 33 million years ago, and was moved to its present location by tectonic plate movement. Patton is one of the most well-understood seamounts, as a major expedition using DSV Alvin in 1999 and another in 2002 helped define the scope of the seamount's biological community. Like other large seamounts, Patton acts as an ecological hub for sea life. Dives have revealed that the volcano is heavily encrusted in sea life of various forms, including sea stars, corals, king crabs, demersal rockfish, and other species.  Geology  Segmented basalt on Patton Seamount. A small coral and squid can also be seen, to the lower right. Patton Seamount was created by the Cobb hotspot, and it lies in the Cobb‚ÄìEickelberg Seamount chain. The Cobb chain is unusual in that it is not one individual volcanic chain, but a mosaic of many, created by several hotspots that now lie along the western coast of North America. Patton Seamount lies near the northwestern edge of the chain, in the Gulf of Alaska, and is 33 million years of age, among the oldest in the group. The part of the chain that Patton Seamount lies in is known variably as either the \\"Gulf of Alaska Seamounts\\" or the \\"Patton Seamounts.\\" The Gulf seamounts are the best-known and most heavily studied features in the chain. Patton itself is over tall and wide at is base, and originally formed off the coast of Washington 33 million years ago. It has since been moved to its present Gulf location by the northwestern movement of the Pacific Plate. Dives indicate that the structure of Patton Seamount is rough near the top, with many boulders, and consists of much broader, finer particulates near the ocean bottom. Not much is known about Patton geologically, as expeditions have mostly focused on its biology.  Ecology  A male specimen of large-clawed spider crab (Macroregonia macrochiera) collected on Patton Seamount during the 2002 expeditions, at a depth of . This is the deepest that they have yet been observed. Patton Seamount is ecologically vibrant: geologist Randy Keller of the Oregon State University once said \\"...it's just astonishing how much there is around you. You see rocky outcroppings and there's life everywhere‚Äîsponges and sea stars.\\" Patton Seamount, like many other seamounts, serves as an \\"oasis of life\\" for resident organisms. Isolated populations found on seamounts like Patton have been shown to have high levels of endemism and specialization, and Patton Seamount is almost completely encrusted in life. Limited-scale fishing operations and scientific investigations were carried around in the 80s and 90s, mostly due to the rough nature of the seamounts, and the difficulty of sampling at such depths. July 1999 marked the first detailed observations on the seamount, in an expedition based on the and utilizing the DSV Alvin. This cruise would be followed by a more extant expedition, covering all of the Patton seamounts, in 2002, for which the Patton cruise served as a model. 8 dives were conducted during the cruise, the deepest being deep, and of the seamount's surface was surveyed. The researchers found that the volcano's ecosystem could be divided into three parts or faunal assemblies. First is a shallow ecosystem, predominated by demersal rockfish of the (Sebastes) and Sebastolobus genera. Other residents include Embassichthys bathybius, Lithodes aequispinus, Florometra spp., brittle stars, sea anemones, and sea stars. The mid-range community had a greater degree of suspension feeders, including Psolus spp., corals, and sponges. It also included Albatrossia pectoralis and Anoplopoma fimbria. The deepest community was distinct from the two above it, as it was populated less by sessile animals and more by more mobile ones. Especially notable are Coryphaenoides spp., Antimora microlepis, and Macroregonia macrochira. A complete right whale skeleton was discovered on the seamount in 2005. The skeleton had been mostly stripped of flesh when it was found, indicating that it had probably spent many years on the ocean bottom. Although it was not obvious from surrounding fauna, whale falls like this may be boons for organisms living in ordinarily resource-poor regions.

It could further concern the association or representation of those who negotiate or seek to negotiate the terms or conditions of employment.  Prevention  Preventing labor disputes involves coordinating actions at multiple levels, including: = Publicity = Toho labor disputes Through the multi-channel and multi-level promotion of policies and regulations to ensure that the employer knows the law, workers' rights activists should know how to deal with the social and cultural environment. = Collective bargaining = In countries such as the US, the workforce can form unions, strike and collectively bargain with employers.

The F-106 is considered one of the finest all-weather interceptors ever built. It served on active duty with the United States Air Force Air Defense Command (and successor organizations) and Air Defense squadrons of the Air National Guard for almost 30 years, much longer than most of its contemporaries. Originally designated the F-102B, it was redesignated F-106 because of extensive structural changes and a more powerful engine. The first F-106A flew on 26 December 1956, and deliveries to the USAF began in July 1959 with the 539th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at McGuire AFB, New Jersey. Production ended in late 1960 after 277 single-seat F-106As and 63 two-seat F-106B trainers had been built. The last squadron to relinquish its F-106s was the 119th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron of the New Jersey Air National Guard, which sent its last plane to AMARC in August 1988. The last operator of the F-106 was the 82d Aerial Targets Squadron, which used retired F-106s as target drones beginning in 1990. The last shoot down of a QF-106 (57-2524) took place at Holloman AFB on 20 February 1997. The last unexpended flyable 82d ATS QF-106 drone was sent to AMARC in January 1998 for storage.

He was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1910 and died in London in 1986. Rosenfeld made seminal contributions to Kleinian thinking on psychotic and other very ill patients; while his emphasis on the role of the analyst in contributing to potential impasses in the analytic encounter has had a wide impact on analysts both in Britain and internationally.Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (London 1996) p. 12-3 Life With a medical diploma from Munich (1934), Rosenfeld emigrated to Britain in 1935, where he retook his medical degree. He became a psychiatrist and specialised in the psychoanalytic treatment of psychosis. Analyzed by Melanie Klein, he himself became an analyst in 1945 and continued to work within the Kleinian movement, alongside such figures as Wilfred Bion and Hanna Segal. Among his most significant contributions were his groundbreaking exploration of projective identification;James Grotstein, But at the Same Time and on Another Level (London 2009) p. 43 the development of the concept of \\"confusion\\"; and the foundation of a theory of destructive narcissism, since taken up and developed by Andr√© Green and Otto Kernberg. On \\"confusion\\" Rosenfeld saw confusion as a half-way house between splitting and reintegration, either as a progressive step towards the latter, or as a regression from it.Salomon Resnik, The Delusional Person (London 2001) p. 199 In its negative aspect, according to Hanna Segal, \\"a most powerful element in confusion is envy...Narcissistic organisation protects us from that confusion\\".Hanna Segal/Nicola Abel-Hirsch, Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (2007) p. 233-4 Destructive narcissism Rosenfeld played a leading part in the work of Kleinians on the destructive aspects of narcissism.Casement, Further p. 168 For Rosenfeld, \\"destructive narcissism...is directed against the libidinal ties or bonds of the self to the object\\".Herbert Rosenfeld,Impasse and Interpretation (London 1987) p. 27 The concept of what Rosenfeld termed \\"narcissistic omnipotent object relations\\"Quoted by James Grotstein, in Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 1993) p. xii-xiv \\\\- a state of mind dominated by an internal object merging ego and ego ideal in a form of mad omnipotence - was later to feed into Kernberg's notion of the pathologically grandiose selfGrotstein, p. xiv Analytical impasse Rosenfeld's final work, Impasse and Interpretation (1987), focused on the possibility of the overcoming of critical moments of impasse with difficult patients. Rosenfeld was increasingly convinced that such potentially destructive impasses were predicated on the existence of blind spots in the analyst,De Masi, in Grotstein, Same Time p. 44 thus pointing the way for the later developments of intersubjective psychoanalysis. While for some analysts, the negative therapeutic reaction is an insurmountable block, Rosenfeld attempts to show that these \\"dead ends\\" are moments that can and should be overcome. Using the concept of envy to shed light on analytic impasse, Rosenfeld maintained that while patients may in some ways prefer to resist change rather than allow the analyst to help them,Robert Withers, Controversies in Analytical Psychology (2003) p. 241 if handled innovatively, such stalemates may allow patients to bring back to life for their analyst the impasses they subjectively lived at key moments in their development.

It is an erect, bushy shrub with narrow oblong leaves, and pink flowers with five petals in late winter and early spring. Description Eriostemon australasius is an erect, bushy shrub which grows to a height of . It has simple leaves that are narrow oblong in shape, long, long and are covered with tiny star-like hairs when young, although the hairs may only be visible with a magnifying glass. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils, mostly near the ends of the branches, on a stalk long. At the base of each flower are five to twelve sepal-like bracteoles. There are five pink to reddish petals which are about long and are covered with similar hairs to those on the leaves, but become smooth with maturity. Flowering occurs in late winter and early spring.Eriostemon australasius in the Gibraltar Range National Park Taxonomy and naming Eriostemon australasius was first formally described in 1805 by Christiaan Persoon and the description was published in Synopsis plantarum, seu enchiridium botanicum, complectens enumerationem systematicam specierum. The specific epithet (australasius) is derived from the Latin word australis meaning \\"south\\". The common name is derived from the thick waxy petals. Distribution and habitat Pink wax flower grows in heathland and dry eucalyptus woodlands from Lake Conjola on the New South Wales south coast northwards along the coast to Fraser Island in Queensland. Use in horticulture Eriostemon australasius was first cultivated in England in 1824. It adapts fairly readily to the garden situation, as long as it has good drainage, in dappled shade to full sun. The roots benefit from some shelter. It can be propagated from cuttings or from seed with difficulty and is moderately frost tolerant.

It was formed after the Great Depression when the Opera was experiencing funding problems. Its purpose was to reach out to both current and potential audience members beyond the traditional upper-class audience. It offered educational insights about opera and the opera world through local events, workshops, publications for enthusiasts and for educators. Beginning in the 1935/36 season the Guild soon reached 2,000 members in its first year of operations, and was able to make its first gift to the Metropolitan Opera: a new cyclorama. Throughout the 1930s membership continued to grow and they were able to underwrite the fund needed for larger projects like a new production of Wagner's Ring Cycle and then to provide one third of the cost paid by the Metropolitan Opera Association to the house owned by the Metropolitan Opera and Real Estate Company. The Guild furthered educational access on the art and artists of opera to opera lovers from across the country, many of whom only knew the Met from their weekly radio broadcasts. They share their knowledge with adults seeking to learn more, and through school programs reaching the next generation of opera lovers. The first student matin√©e was presented by the Guild in 1937 and access to live productions has continuously been offered ever since. In the 1970s as arts education funding was severely cut, the Guild stepped in to assist teachers. From teacher training to in school artist residency programs, the Guild offers age-appropriate, research-based arts education to all grades, in ways that are connected to the school curriculum and the needs of teachers. Most well known may be their publication Opera News which was tested first as a newsletter but quickly became the leading publication devoted to opera.

It is in the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery. Given the artist's lack of interest in fashion or conventional beauty, the portrait has been noted as \\"a rare example of Eakins's studying the physical beauty of a young woman,\\" and \\"one of Eakins's loveliest paintings.\\"Sewell, 1982, p. 121Sewell et al. 2001, p. 261 Maud was the sister of Weda Cook, who posed for Eakins' The Concert Singer in 1892. She is seen in a pink dress, the fabric flowing from her shoulders and pinned between her breasts. Her head is tilted to the left, in the direction of the light source. The light creates deep shadows that define the structure of her face, yet is subtle enough to suggest a youthful skin tone. In a letter written to Lloyd Goodrich in 1930, Cook recalled: \\"As I was just a young girl my hair is down low in the neck and tied with a ribbon....Mr. Eakins never gave (the painting) a name but said to himself it was like a 'big rose bud'.\\"Goodrich, Vol. II, 1982. p. 69 Several art historians have remarked on the implications of Eakins' description, especially the Victorian association of the rose with virginity, and the bud with sexual potential.Wilmerding, et al. 1993. p.124 Cook was in her twenties when she sat for the portrait and did not marry until eleven years later. The painting has been described as an example of Eakins' typical stark and unflattering vision.Homer, p. 224 Although described as \\"resembling a classical sculpture more than a pretty, contemporary woman\\",Sewell, 1982, p. 121 Cook's representation is viewed as sensual, and representing an intensely private moment, underscored by the attention paid to her features and the disarray of her hairline. The suggestion of repressed sexuality has been seen as both intriguing and disturbing. Before giving the painting to Cook, Eakins inscribed \\"To his friend/Maude Cook/Thomas Eakins/1895\\" on the back and carved its frame.Wilmerding, et al. 1993. p.124-125 Eventually the painting was acquired by Stephen Carlton Clark, who bequeathed it to Yale University Art Gallery, where it has been held since 1961.

Teatro San Samuele was an opera house and theatre located at the Rio del Duca, between Campo San Samuele and Campo Santo Stefano, in Venice. One of several important theatres built in that city by the Grimani family, the theatre opened in 1656 and operated continuously until a fire destroyed the theatre in 1747. A new structure was built and opened in 1748, but financial difficulties forced the theatre to close and be sold in 1770. The theatre remained active until 1807 when it was shut down by Napoleonic decree. It reopened in 1815 and was later acquired by impresario Giuseppe Camploy in 1819. In 1853 the theatre was renamed the Teatro Camploy. Upon Camploy's death in 1889, the theatre was bequeathed to the City of Verona. The Venice City Council in turn bought the theatre and demolished it in 1894. History One of the most important Venetian theatres of the 17th and 18th centuries, the Teatro San Samuele was constructed in 1656 through a commission made by the Grimani family a year earlier. Initially the theatre was used primarily for plays but in the 18th century the house became more closely associated with opera and ballet. The famous playwright and librettist Carlo Goldoni notably served as the theatre's director from 1737‚Äì1741, and many of his works were premiered at the theatre during his career.Nicola Mangini. I teatri di Venezia, Mursia, 1974. The original Teatro San Samuele was destroyed by fire on the last night of September 1747.Eleanor Selfridge-Field A new chronology of Venetian opera and related genres, 1660-1760 p465 A new theatre was built in almost identical design and opened in May 1748 as opulent competition for the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo. The new theatre became associated with the opera buffa repertoire, as the Grimani family preferred to stage opera seria and other more dramatic works at their other theatre, the Teatro San Benedetto (built 1755). At the end of the 18th century the Teatro San Samuele lost much of its former prestige. In 1770 the Grimani family had been forced to sell the theatre due to the economic crisis that hit the Venetian aristocracy. The theatre continued to operate until 6 April 1807 when it was ordered closed by a Napoleonic decree which also shut down the Teatro San Cassiano, the Teatro San Angelo, and the Teatro San Luca. The San Samuele and the San Luca were re- opened after a 21 April 1815 Austrian decree. In 1819 the Teatro San Samuele was acquired by impresario Giuseppe Camploy. With the exception of the 1840s when performances were sporadic, the theatre remained continuously active until Camploy's death in 1889. In 1853 the theatre was renamed as the Teatro Camploy. In the third edition of Murray's Hand-book for travellers in northern Italy (1847) Sir Francis Palgrave reported \\"It is a pretty theatre well adapted for hearing. Opera buffas are performed here\\" Hand-book for travellers in northern Italy [by sir F. Palgrave?]. Murray - Page 362 1847 In his will, Camploy bequeathed the theatre to the City of Verona. The Venice City Council bought it and, after demolishing the theatre in 1894, built the A. Scarsellini elementary school on the former site of the theatre.

Career =Early career= Beccacece played for Argentine amateur club Juan XXIII as a right back when he was teenager. After failing to have success as footballer, he involved in football management, beginning at Newell's Old Boys football academy in 2001. Since 2003, aged twenty three, he worked as Jorge Sampaoli‚Äôs assistant coach, joining alongside him to Peruvian side Sport Boys from Callao. After four years at the Peruvian football, in 2008, they moved to Chilean top-level club O'Higgins, staying there until August of the incoming year. Weeks later, they signed for Emelec, Ecuadorian giant. In 2010, following the World Cup, he had the possibility to work with Marcelo Bielsa in the Chile national football team. Nevertheless, Beccacece refused the offer and remained as Sampaoli‚Äôs assistant. Then, in December, they returned to Chile, joining powerhouse club Universidad de Chile to face the 2011 season. There, together reached the two league titles (Apertura and Clausura) and the Copa Sudamericana. Following their success at Universidad de Chile, in 2013, Beccacece and Sampaoli were signed by the ANFP to led the Chile national team, finally arriving there after rejecting Bielsa‚Äôs offer. At Chile they achieved the qualification to the 2014 World Cup finals and the first ever Copa Am√©rica title in the country‚Äôs history. In 2015, they resigned from the Chile national team amid the FIFA corruption case where they were involved alongside Federation‚Äôs president Sergio Jadue. =Universidad de Chile= Beccacece with Universidad de Chile‚Äôs 2011 Copa Sudamericana champion team at Moneda Palace with the then president Sebasti√°n Pi√±era. On 11 January 2016, after putting an agreed end to his years as assistant coach of Sampaoli, Universidad de Chile signed him as first-team coach, replacing former coach Mart√≠n Lasarte. During his first days at the club, the team received as signings the Argentine playmaker Luis Fari√±a on 12 January, and a week later, the Chilean international Gonzalo Jara and the also Argentine Fabi√°n Monz√≥n from Calcio Catania. On 24 January, in his second league game since his debut for this competition at the bench (a 1‚Äì1 away draw with Deportes Antofagasta), Beccacece impressed following the team‚Äôs 8‚Äì1 home thrash over O'Higgins at the Estadio Nacional. After of that great victory nevertheless the team reaped three draws and one loss against Palestino (2‚Äì1). During February‚Äôs first days, the team was eliminated of the Copa Libertadores first stage by Uruguay‚Äôs River Plate F.C., which was his first failure and it meant being the target of criticism from the press and the team‚Äôs supporters. On 28 February, the 4‚Äì1 away victory over Cobresal would be a balm of the team‚Äôs moment. Following a 0‚Äì0 draw with Uni√≥n Espa√±ola and two losses (3‚Äì1 with Universidad de Concepci√≥n as local and 5‚Äì4 against Santiago Wanderers as visitors), he back to draw, now in the Chilean football derby with Colo-Colo, which was again a goalless where both teams were criticized for its game level. Finally, Beccacece would end in the tenth place with three wins, seven draws and five losses and his continuity was heavily questioned during the Copa Am√©rica Centenario break. For the purpose of the 2016 Torneo Apertura, the club hired to Luis Mar√≠a Bonini as fitness coach and were appointed ten players which joined the club, between the most important figured Jean Beausejour from archi-rivals Colo-Colo, Christian Vilches from Atl√©tico Paranaense (former Colo-Colo too) and the Argentine playmaker Gast√≥n Fern√°ndez from Estudiantes de La Plata. He began the tournament losing 1‚Äì0 with Wanderers at Valpara√≠so, and drawing 1‚Äì1 as locals with Deportes Antofagasta on 7 August, date where again his continuity was questioned. Nevertheless he would return to victory, reaching two consecutive triumphs with San Luis de Quillota (4‚Äì2) and Universidad de Concepci√≥n (3‚Äì1), that this time saw their end on 27 August after being defeated 3‚Äì0 by Universidad Cat√≥lica.

Timberlake attended the U.S. Military Academy, having a successful role on the football team there. Upon his graduation in 1923, he was commissioned in the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant of Artillery. He later moved to the Army Air Corps and became a certified command pilot, combat observer, and aircraft observer. He commanded units in Panama, North Africa, Okinawa and Naples before retiring from the U.S. Air Force in 1957. Early life Timberlake was born in Fort Greble, Dutch Island, Newport County, Rhode Island on Christmas Day, 1901. His family had a strong military tradition, with several West Point graduates.

San Jacinto College. The sculpture is mounted on a 6-foot high granite base with poetry inscription by Robert Nanninga, and is in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Encinitas, California, United States. Locals have nicknamed Magic Carpet Ride as The Cardiff Kook, a pejorative name popularized by the local surfing community.  History  The sculpture was commissioned by the Cardiff Botanical Society at a cost of approximately $120,000. It was installed in 2007 at the entrances to the San Elijo State Beach campground on Coast Highway 101. The $92,000 construction cost was raised by the Botanical Society, with the $30,000 installation funded by the city of Encinitas. The sculpture was intended to depict a surfer performing a \\"(backside) floater\\", but the Botanical Society's budget could not cover the cost of an additional water/wave component. Antichevich was chosen from more than 50 bidders on the commission. His original design was for a female surfer on a breaking wave, which also exceeded the budget, and the Botanical Society chose an image of a male surfer on a granite plinth that halved the amount of required bronze. Other proposed designs were discussed with the Botanical Society, including the figure of professional surfer Rob Machado and a surfer on a longboard. According to Antichevich and to Michael Ames Clark (then-chairman of the Botanical Society's selection committee), the sculpture represented the joy and awkwardness of a young boy learning how to surf, in acknowledgement of the area's attraction to novice surfers.  Public response  The San Diego Architectural Foundation, in its annual \\"Orchids & Onions\\" awards for the best and worst architecture of the year, awarded the Magic Carpet Ride an Onion rating in 2007. The nickname of The Cardiff Kook comes from derogatory surfer slang for a \\"wannabe\\" surfer, and reflects the low opinion that local surfers had of the sculpture. The sculpture was criticized by surfers for its unrealistic depiction of a surfer. Other critics maintained that the feet were positioned incorrectly, the hands were odd in appearance, the figure was too thin and effeminate, and that as a whole it resembled the figure of a novice surfer about to fall off his board (as the artist intended) rather than that of a more experienced surfer. The early criticism surprised both the Botanical Society and artist Matthew Antichevich, who stated that he did not expect the piece to be as widely misunderstood as it was upon its unveiling. The original models for the sculpture included a wave component, and Antichevich stated that if the wave had been included, the figure's surfing stance would have been better understood. Antichevich also noted that it was impossible, while creating the sculpture, to look at its hands from the necessary angles, since he \\"wasn't working 16 feet in the air\\". At the sculpture's installation, Deputy Mayor Jerome Stocks defended the piece and answered critics with \\"Well, you go raise your own 90,000 dollars and put up a statue that you like.\\". After its early criticisms, the sculpture has evolved into a humorous landmark attracting frequent \\"costuming\\" efforts. The popularity of The Cardiff Kook has led to its own Google Maps feature listing, and themed community events, such as \\"The Cardiff Kook Costume 5K & 10K Run.\\"  Alterations to Magic Carpet Ride / The Cardiff Kook  The sculpture began to attract pranksters who dressed the surfer in various attire, costumes, even with extended backdrops, which at times approached vandalism. The list of such pranks is extensive, often coordinated with current events: a pink pleated skirt, bikini top and lucha libre wrestling mask; a Zorro costume; a pumpkin head (at Halloween); a Santa Claus hat (at Christmas); a full Uncle Sam costume for United States Independence Day; the hood of the prisoner on a box photograph from Abu Ghraib prison; a clown costume; a loincloth and surrounded by a prehistoric setting while being snatched up by a sculpted pterodactyl in flight; and a papier m√¢ch√© statue of a shark about to swallow up the surfer from beneath. The shark costume was one of two prank additions to the sculpture performed by local artist Eric Hardtke, himself a sculptor who works in bronze and stone, and accomplices. The first was a 2009 addition next to the statue of a wave crashing down over the Kook, carrying a wire mesh outline of another surfer about to knock the Kook off his board. This wave still exists, since it was removed undamaged by city employees, and is stored at the ranch of Paul Ecke, a local grower of poinsettias. It is constructed of wood, paper, and chicken wire, and Hardtke stated that \\"It was to make the point that you could make a better sculpture for less money.\\". The second alteration to the Kook by Hardtke was the shark. This 15 foot work was made of papier m√¢ch√© over a wooden frame, and estimated by Hardtke to have consumed $450 and two weeks. It was constructed in two halves, which were then sealed together around the Kook using foam sealant that was moulded to resemble ocean spray coming down off the flanks of the shark. It was installed in the early morning, around 04:00, of 2010-07-24 by Hardtke and some two dozen friends, and had been presaged over the preceding few days by the appearance of similarly constructed shark fins, positioned across the street from the statue and gradually moved closer to the Kook over a period of days, to imply a shark drawing close underwater to the Kook. $400 in diverted employee time was used to clean up the shark. Unlike the wave, the shark was damaged when it was removed by four city public works employees, who took 10 minutes to split it apart using hand saws in the morning of 2010-07-26 and two hours overall to remove it. Hardtke himself was not critical of the Kook, and considers it a fair representation of average surfers, saying that \\"I'm sure I look like that. That's why everybody is so down on it. They like to think they don't look like that, but they do.\\". Today, people continue to dress the Kook in various costumes and signage. Often for events such as birthdays, graduations, and local sports games, Cardiff locals will turn to the Kook for a fun way to announce to the Cardiff community that an event is happening. While these alterations are on a much smaller scale than the ones above, they are what locals tend to look out for on daily strolls past the Kook. Since the large alterations of the Cardiff Kook began, merchandise such as calendars have been created as a sort of souvenir for tourists to purchase when visiting the city of Encinitas. =City officials' reaction= While such pranks are officially discouraged by Encinitas mayor Dan Dalager and city authorities, it is unofficially acknowledged that the sculpture's repeated costuming or vandalism is a boost to Cardiff's tourist trade. Antichevich regards the vandalism as an insult to his work. No legal action has been taken against such vandals, because no damage has been done to the sculpture itself. It does not cost the city extra to clean up the various defacements, but it does divert time from tasks that city employees could otherwise be doing. Mayor Dalager has stated that, while he personally likes the attention that this gives to the sculpture, he does not want the city to be having to divert city time and money away from the city's real problems. Deputy city manager Richard Phillips concurred, comparing the vandalism of the Kook to school pranksters dressing up a school's mascot, stating that \\"it gets old\\" and that city time and money could be better spent fixing potholes than cleaning up pranks.

It was called by the name of Jesus Izcoa Moure, as he was the first state legislator, native of Naranjito, also his signature is stamped on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The bridge crosses the Rio La Plata between the two municipalities. According to data collected more than 80,000 residents of Puerto Rico benefit bridge; this is the very first Cable-stayed bridge in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. Puerto Rico is an area of moderate to high seismic activity. The bridge was designed using an AASHTO response spectrum (Soil Profile Type I and an Acceleration Coefficient of 0.20g). All major bridge members were required to remain elastic for the design level earthquake and ductile detailing in accordance with AASHTO Seismic Performance Category C was provided in all potential plastic hinge regions. PPD Governor Anibal Acevedo Vila led the opening ceremony of the project on October 24, 2008. The total cost of the project was $31 million which came from local and federal funds. The bridge (including approach spans) is 703 meters long. The cable stayed portion is supported by two hollow diamond-shaped towers and 96 stay. The total cable stayed supported length is 315 meters with a main span over La Plata river of 157.5 meters. Few days after inaugurated the bridge, took out the marathon \\"Carrera 10K del Chango sobre el Puente Atirantado\\" where all proceeds would go to help families of the people of Naranjito. The bridge is now restricted to two lanes to minimize impact loads on the cable stayed system. These impact loads are generated when traveling trucks bounce on the bridge deck due to the bumpiness of the concrete surface. The bumpiness of the bridge deck was the result of unfortunate judgement provided by consultants during the construction of the cast-in-place bridge deck. This structural condition is fixable. The design of the Jes√∫s Izcoa Moure Bridge was carried out by a joint venture between CSA and HNTB. The inspection during construction was performed by a firm named Edwards and Kelcey managed at the time by Eng. Ralph Burrington. The cable stayed system was provided by Dywidag Systems International.

In 1809, he became professor at K√∂nigsberg. In 1820, he resumed his chair at Halle. Although he taught theology, he is chiefly known as a philologist. Work Following Alexander Geddes, he applied the fragmentary hypothesis to the whole of the Pentateuch, treating it as an aggregate of numerous minor documents that had been compiled together.Joseph Estlin Carpenter and George Harford, The Composition of the Hexateuch (London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1902), 73. Vater's major work, Commentar √ºber den Pentateuch was published in three volumes in Halle between 1802 and 1806.Johann Severin Vater, Commentar √ºber den Pentateuch, 3 vols. (Halle, 1802‚Äì1805). This work's primary purpose was to advance the Supplementary Hypothesis against the earlier Documentarian endeavors of Jean Astruc, Johann Gottfried Eichhorn, and Karl David Ilgen. Many of Vater's conclusions ‚Äì most prominently, his assertion of the late nature of the Pentateuch as compared to the historical books ‚Äì mirror the independent work of Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette, whose Beitr√§ge zur Einleitung in das Alte Testament was published in 1806-7. Against de Wette, though, Vater supposed, based on historical book allusions to Deuteronomy, that at least some parts of Deuteronomy had existed prior to the collection of the Pentateuch.John Rogerson, Old Testament Criticism in the Nineteenth Century: England and Germany (Eugene, Oregon: Wipf and Stock, 1984), 35.

He was convicted of two counts of wire fraud, including stealing nearly 2 million credit card numbers and running up about $86 million in fraudulent charges.  Early life  Butler was born on July 10, 1972,U.S. Public Records Index Vol 1 (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2010. and grew up in Meridian, Idaho with a younger sibling; his parents divorced when he was 14. His father was a Vietnam War veteran and computer store owner who married a daughter of Ukrainian immigrants. As a teenager, Max Butler became interested in bulletin board systems and hacking. After a parent reported a theft of chemicals from a lab room, Meridian High School expelled Butler, and Butler pleaded guilty to malicious injury to property, first- degree burglary, and grand theft. Butler was diagnosed as bipolar in a two- week psychiatric evaluation at an in-care facility and ultimately received probation for his crimes, sent to live with his father, and transferred to Bishop Kelly High School.Poulsen, pp. 4‚Äì5.  First offense  Butler attended Boise State University for a year. In 1991, Butler was convicted of assault during his freshman year of college. His appeal was unsuccessful on procedural grounds, as a judge ruled that Butler's defense attorney did not raise the issue in an earlier appeal. The Idaho State Penitentiary paroled Butler on 26 April 1995.Poulsen 2011, p. 15.  Professional and personal life  Butler moved with his father near Seattle and worked in part-time technical support positions in various companies. He discovered Internet Relay Chat and frequently downloaded warez, or illegally downloaded software or media. After an Internet service provider in Littleton, Colorado traced Butler's uploads of warez to an unprotected file transfer protocol server ‚Äìthe uploads were consuming excessive bandwidth‚Äìto the CompuServe corporate offices in Bellevue, Washington, CompuServe fired Butler.Poulsen 2011, p. 16. Moving to Half Moon Bay, California, he changed his last name to Vision and lived in a rented mansion \\"Hungry Manor\\" with a group of other computer enthusiasts.Poulsen 2011, pp. 14, 16. Butler became a system administrator at computer gaming start-up MPath Interactive.Poulsen 2011, p. 17. The Software Publishers Association filed a $300,000 lawsuit against Butler for engaging in unauthorized distribution of software from CompuServe's office and later settled the case for $3,500 and free computer consulting. After marrying Kimi Winters, he moved to Berkeley, California, and worked as a freelance pentester and security consultant. During this time, he developed 'an online community resource called the \\"advanced reference archive of current heuristics for network intrusion detection systems,\\" or arachNIDS.'  FBI investigation, guilty plea, and sentencing  In the spring of 1998, Butler installed a backdoor onto American federal government websites while trying to fix a security hole in the BIND server daemon. However, an investigator with the United States Air Force found Butler via pop-up notifications. He hired attorney Jennifer Granick for legal representation after hearing Granick speak at DEF CON. On 25 September 2000, Butler pleaded guilty to gaining unauthorized access to Defense Department computers. Starting in May 2001, Butler served an 18-month federal prison sentence handed down by US District Judge James Ware. After his release from prison in 2003 on supervised release, Butler exploited Wi-Fi technology to commit cyberattacks anonymously along with Chris Aragon from San Francisco.Poulsen 2011, pp. 68‚Äì71. He advanced to programming malware, such as allowing the Bifrost trojan horse to evade virus scanner programs and exploited the HTML Application feature of Internet Explorer to steal American Express credit card information.Poulsen 2011, pp. 80‚Äì84. Butler also targeted Citibank by using a Trojan horse towards a credit card identity thief and began distributing PINs to Aragon, who would have others withdraw the maximum daily amount of cash from ATMs until the compromised account was empty.Poulsen, pp. 101‚Äì104. Arrested in 2007, Butler was accused of operating CardersMarket, a forum where cyber criminals bought and sold sensitive data such as credit card numbers. After pleading guilty to two counts of wire fraud, stealing nearly 2 million credit card numbers, which were used for $86 million in fraudulent purchases, Butler was sentenced to 13 years in prison, which was the longest sentence ever given for hacking charges in the United States of America at the time. At least two longer sentences are known ‚Äì Albert Gonzales, the TJX hacker (2010: 20 years), and Roman Seleznev, (2017: 27 years). After prison, Butler will also face 5 years of supervised release and is ordered to pay $27.5 million in restitution to his victims. Butler is currently incarcerated at FCI Victorville in California.

History Piston‚Äôs First Quartet was premiered on March 7, 1933 by the Chardon Quartet, to whom it is dedicated. It is a charming but by no means bland work that later became a favorite of the Juilliard Quartet . Aaron Copland singled out this quartet, praising its \\"acidulous opening movement, the poetic mood painting of its second, and its breezy finale\\", all of which \\"sets a superb standard of taste and of expert string writing\\" . Analysis The quartet is in three movements: #Allegro () #Adagio () #Allegro vivace (, ) The first movement is in sonata-allegro form in a mixed C major/minor. The harmonic language stresses chords based on perfect fourths, and features the chromatic, dissonant counterpoint characteristic of Piston‚Äôs early period . A nightmarish quality is produced by the approach to the F-minor second, waltzlike theme through C minor . The second movement is a simple ABA in E minor, with the strings muted in the brooding, chromatic outer sections, and an unmuted fugato in sharply dotted rhythms in the central part . This movement especially features the cello . The rondo finale is based throughout on a repeated-note motive of three sixteenth notes, and the first subject recalls the quartet‚Äôs opening movement by alternating C and D .

History Piston's Second Quartet was composed two years after his First Quartet and, like it, was premiered by the Chardon Quartet, on March 16, 1935. It was written, together with the Piano Trio, while Piston was on a Guggenheim Fellowship . Analysis The quartet is in three movements: #Lento () ‚Äì Allegro () #Adagio molto e con espressione () #Allegro giusto () The restlessly chromatic Lento introduction to the first movement is built on a three-note motive, A-C-D, that is found also in a number of the composer's other works . The boisterous main allegro portion of the movement is in A minor and sonata-allegro form. The slow movement is based on the motive from the Lento introduction of the first, and is in a chromatically inflected C major . The finale is in changing meters, with a dissonant-contrapuntal first theme, and a pandiatonic second one that wavers between G major and E major. These tonalities contrast sharply with the equally wavering A minor and C major tonalities of the movement as a whole, which remain undecided until an A minor cadence at the end of the coda, followed immediately by a surprising Picardy third A-major triad .

The first Thermal Head was constructed in 1996 by James Kerner. It was initially designed to control a slot 1 Intel processor's temperature while making computations in a test platform. A Thermal Head attached to a CPU may also increase a CPU's performance during computation. Today it is used for test/validation of a processor in conjunction with a Thermal Management System consisting of a temperature controller attached to the Thermal Head by way of an electrical umbilical. A Thermal Head is always used in conjunction with a Thermal Tool System. \\"Among the USTC Thermal Tool System products are the Integrated Thermal Management System (ITMS), Hybrid Air Thermal Management System (HATMS), Rack Integrated Thermal Management System (RITMS), Temperature Control System (TCS), and Thermal Heads (TH). Integrating cooling modules and the TCS in one enclosure with liquid as working fluid, combined with TH, the ITMS executes temperature control tasks without other components. Using air as cooling media, the HATMS executes the tasks like ITMS. The RITMS includes a smart TCS unit which automatically adjusts parameters for temperature control, with an ultra-low noise level and low power consumption. The TCS is a standard temperature control unit, and the TH dissipate heat from a heat-generated device, like a computer. The RITMS or TCS, combined with a chiller (or a heat exchanger) and TH, provide a standard way to control the temperature and dissipate heat on electronic components for production validation tests.\\" References Central processing unit ","title":"Thermal Head"},{"id":"28944236","text":"Okiseius alniseius is a species of mite in the family Phytoseiidae.

History Piston‚Äôs Fourth Quartet was commissioned by the Coolidge Foundation in celebration of the centennial of Mills College, and is dedicated to Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge. It was premiered on May 18, 1952 by the Hungarian Quartet. It is closely related to Piston‚Äôs Fourth Symphony . Analysis The quartet is in four movements: #Soave ( ) #Adagio (9/8) #Leggero vivace (2/4) #Con fuoco (6/8) The first movement is a sonata-allegro in D major, whose harmonies are pandiatonic rather than triadic. The second theme is given in the high register of the viola, with the other instruments softly accompanying sulla tastiera (near the fingerboard). The slow movement features the cello in a pensive cantilena, and a shifting, unstable harmony that settles on E minor only at the end . The third movement is a fugal scherzo with a fleetness comparable to Mendelssohn and a dense chromaticism that recalls Schoenberg . Its exaggerated staccato and duple meter resemble the scherzos of the Flute Quintet and the Sixth Symphony, respectively, while the pizzicato A-minor chords at the opening and close recall the scherzo movements of the string quartets by Debussy and Ravel . The finale is in sonata-allegro form like the opening movement, but with an expressionist tone. The first theme is dramatic, marked by contrasting textures, sharp dissonances, crescendos starting forte, irregular downbeats, and abrupt rests. The second theme is a grotesque march. The urgent character of this movement is similar to Piston's finales from the early 1940s, and this may be because it, too, was written in wartime‚Äîthe Korean War in the present instance .

History Construction of the cathedral was begun in 1482, to plans by Lorenzo of Bologna, and completed in the 1560s.Guidolotti, P., Beltramini, G. (2001): Andrea Palladio: the complete illustrated works, p. 308: \\"VICENZA CATHEDRAL: DOME AND SIDE PORTAL: Begun in 1482 to a design by Lorenzo da Bologna, the apse of Vicenza cathedral was ... however, in two stages: from 1558 to 1559, the main cornice was built over the windows and the drum raised, ...\\" The cupola was planned by Andrea Palladio and probably the north doorway also. Only the original fa√ßade survived the bombing of World War II; the rest of the present building has been reconstructed. The maestri di cappella include Fra Ruffino d'Assisi (1525‚Äì31),Cori Spezzati: An Anthology of Sacred Polychoral Music, vol. 2, Anthony F. Carver Nicola Vicentino (1563‚Äì65), Giammateo Asola and his pupil Leone Leoni (1588-1627).Sadie, Julie-Ann (n.d.): Companion to Baroque Music, p. 31  Exterior  = Facade - Gable = Facade - Gable The original facade is Gothic and attributed to Domenico da Venezia 16th century. It is divided into four sections: the lower one has five arches in transoms, the second with arches in the center of an oculus, the third is smooth, the fifth is decorated with five statues (and two pinnacles added in 1948). = Dome = The construction of the apse in the Cathedral of Vicenza had begun in 1482 to the design of Lorenzo da Bologna, but in 1531 it was still unfinished. Early, temporary, roofing was erected in 1540, as a result of the possibility that Vicenza might host the Church Council which in the end was held at Trent. Only in 1557 did the Comune of Vicenza receive the financial means necessary from the Republic of Venice, in the shape of a bequest left by Bishop Zeno at the beginning of the century, and were therefore able to set in motion the work‚Äôs completion. Andrea Palladio, the author of the new projecthttps://www.palladiomuseum.org/veneto/opera/7?lang=en, most probably drew up an overall design which was however executed in two phases: from 1558 to 1559 the main cornice was built over the windows and the drum raised, while from 1564 to January 1566 the dome itself was constructed. The characteristic form of the lantern, abstract and devoid of decoration, was replicated on the summit of the cupolas of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice (planned in the same years), and is also present in some of Palladio‚Äôs reconstructions of centrally planned antique temples, such as the Mausoleum of Romulus on the Via Appia. Since 1994, the dome, together with other Palladian buildings in and around Vicenza, has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto.https://www.comune.vicenza.it/uffici/dipserv/cultur/unesco.php/il_sito_unesco/le_componenti_del_sito/cupola_della_cattedrale = The bell tower = It is slightly detached from the church and placed in the street that runs along the south side of the cathedral.

Pesa is the Kiswahili word for money. Eco- Pesa's was in circulation for one year and was considered the pilot that resulted in the more sustainable Bangla-Pesa model of community currencies that have been duplicated in five communities in Kenya and two in South Africa. Issuance Residents could obtain Eco-Pesa through being part of a business network or participating in community events (such as trash collection days) or through local sales and services. Introduction Eco- Pesa were introduced by William O. Ruddick, May 2010 to three slum villages (or informal settlements) inside the Kongowea Location in Mombasa County, namely: Kisimu Ndogo, Shauri Yako and Mnazi Mmoja. Once registered, local businesses become part of a business Network. Once in this network, businesses are allowed to exchange their Eco-Pesa Voucher for the national currency Kenyan shillings backed by donor funds. They also receive business and environmental training. Businesses included but were not limited to general shops, pharmacies, health clinics, child care, haircuts, charcoal kiosks, produce sellers, poultry sellers, transportation providers, water sellers, and distributors. The Eco-Pesa themselves were security printed with several security features including: Visicoin printing, UV ink, security designed backgrounds and watermarked paper with UV fibers, as well as serial numbering. The Eco-Pesa vouchers were available in 5/ep, 10/ep, and 20/ep denominations and depict local landmarks such as the Kengelele Bell, Nyali Beach and the Nayli Bridge. The advantages of local currencies for the empowerment of women was demonstrated through this first phase of eco-pesa, as many women set up their own businesses with eco-pesa. The first experiments were run under supervision by Koru while Mr. Ruddick also served as director of Green World Campaign's Kenya chapter in Mombasa. Eco-Pesa was originally developed with assistance from Green World Campaign and its founder and executive director, Marc Barasch. Post Eco-Pesa Pilot Expansion William O. Ruddick later founded Grassroots Economics Foundation and in 2013 developed the Bangla-Pesa model based on the results of Eco-Pesa, in the informal settlement of Bangladesh, Kenya. Grassroots Economics is working to employ mobile phone systems to trade community currency. The Bangla-Pesa uses a [mutual credit] model where there is no longer need for national currency or donor funds to keep it running. Other currencies in Kenya that follow the Bangla-Pesa model include: Gatina-Pesa in Kawangware, Kangemi-Pesa in Kangemi, Lindi-Pesa in Kibera, Ng'ombeni-Pesa in Mikindani. K'Mali in Kokstad South Africa as well as Berg-Rand or BRAND in Bergrivier South Africa also follow a similar model. All local currencies that emerged after the Eco-Pesa in Kenya (five in 2016) experience are now grouped under the label Sarafu-Credit, but they originally were issued under the supervision of an association named Koru Kenya, which does no longer exist.  Allegation of forgery and Indiegogo online petition  On the 29th of May 2013, Will Ruddick was arrested with five other members of Koru Kenya, under the suspicion of forgery and being linked to the Mombassa Republican Council (MRC). The link to the MRC was dropped first, but the Central bank of Kenya filled in a charge for forgery. An Indiegogo online petition was issued to gain support and financial assistance to the 6 arrested members of Koru Kenya. The petition managed to raise a total of 8835 euros. The group was released very quickly and forgery but was released a few months later as the charges were never proved.

Several European countries operate short-time schemes to limit the impact of recessions on the economy and on employees. Their intent is to enable companies to avoid layoffs or bankruptcies during a recession because of the state's wage subsidies. Short-time programs have notably been used as an instrument against the COVID-19 recession in 2020. Austria In Austria, the introduction of short time requires a special arrangement between what are called the \\"social partners\\" of Austrian collective bargaining (which is to say, the Chamber of Commerce and the labour unions), who negotiate on behalf of the employer and affected staff the scope of the ' arrangement in terms of the staff covered, the maximum period of its application, the conditions for any lay-offs during the arrangement, and the scope of any professional training or re-training courses included. Czech Republic Amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic, the government of Czech Republic Andrej Babi≈° announced plans to partially subsidise salaries of employees on reduced work schedules, covering 50-70% of pay for 1, 2, or up to 4 days per week that employees are at home due to shocks to companies coming from pandemics or natural disasters. Employers have to cover health and social insurance for the days when workers are at home, and employees contribute by the partial reduction in their pay.Czech PM Babis: new Kurzarbeit law should take effect from November Reuters, September 7, 2020.

Under the scheme temporarily laid-off workers receive payments, now from the Federal Employment Agency (BA), the agency that is also responsible for issuing unemployment benefit. The scheme promises them 60 per cent of their original pay.Guy Chazan in Berlin and Richard Milne (March 23, 2020), Kurzarbeit: a German export most of Europe wants to buy Financial Times. In 2009, the German government had budgeted 5.1 billion euros on the program, which replaced some of the lost income of over 1.4 million workers. The program was favorably cited in a 2009 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report, which stated that it had saved nearly 500,000 jobs during the recession. Besides helping to avoid mass layoffs, proponents of the program also cite its keeping skilled work groups together and avoiding the atrophy of their skills during extended layoffs, while critics have expressed concerns about its expense and that it might prop up non-viable firms.

The conquest of the Mamluk Empire also opened up the territories of Africa to the Ottomans. During the 16th century, Ottoman power expanded further west of Cairo, along the coasts of northern Africa. The corsair Hayreddin Barbarossa established a base in Algeria, and later accomplished the Conquest of Tunis in 1534. Following his capture in Cairo, Caliph Al-Mutawakkil III was brought to Constantinople, where he eventually ceded his office as caliph to Selim's successor, Suleiman the Magnificent. This established the Ottoman Caliphate, with the sultan as its head, thus transferring religious authority from Cairo to the Ottoman throne. Cairo remained in Ottoman hands until the 1798 French conquest of Egypt, when Napoleon I claimed to eliminate the Mamluks.Cairo by Andr√© Raymond p.189 See also * Ottoman‚ÄìMamluk War (1485‚Äì1491) * Ottoman wars in Africa * Ottoman wars in the Near East * History of Ottoman Egypt References Invasions by the Ottoman Empire Wars involving the Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo) History of the Middle East 16th century in Africa 1516 in the Ottoman Empire 1517 in the Ottoman Empire 1516 in the Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo) 1517 in the Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo) Conflicts in 1516 Conflicts in 1517 1516 in Africa 1517 in Africa 1516 in Asia 1517 in Asia ","title":"Ottoman‚ÄìMamluk War (1516‚Äì17)"},{"id":"28944762","text":"Lewis Meeson Newsagent was a chain of newsagents in the United Kingdom, with branches located from Liverpool down to London.

Overview  ScuttlePad was created to be an educational social network for youngsters under 13 years old, the minimum required age for most social networks. The site was created because many youngsters use Facebook and MySpace before they turn the minimum required age and recent studies have shown the increase in usage of social networks among children under the required age for registration.  How ScuttlePad Works  Users require a parental email address and answers to security questions to create a profile. Users create profiles and upload photos. Members can add friends and communicate using pre-defined word lists. All photos are manually reviewed by ScuttlePad management. Adults may not join ScuttlePad, but can use the site in a supervisory role with their children. ScuttlePad offers basic social networking, including user photos and status updates, and communication among users. = Security, Profanity & Cyberbullying Prevention = ScuttlePad abides by the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) guidelines.

He was a surveyor, Native American trader, miner, merchant, and land speculator. Early life Arent Philipse Schuyler was born on June 25, 1662, in Rensselaerswyck, New York. He was the son of Philip Pieterse Schuyler (1628‚Äì1683) and Margarita Van Slichtenhorst (1627‚Äì1710) and the younger brother of Pieter Schuyler (1657‚Äì1724). He was one of 10 children born to his parents, including Gysbert Schuyler (1652-1664/5), Gertruj Schuyler (b. 1654), who married Stephanus van Cortlandt (1643‚Äì1700) (the patroon of Van Cortlandt Manor and a Mayor of New York City from 1677 to 1678 and again from 1686 to 1688), Alida Schuyler (b. 1656), who first married Nicholas van Rensselaer (1636-1678) and then second, Robert Livingston the Elder (1654‚Äì1728), Pieter Schuyler (1657‚Äì1724), who married Engeltie Van Schaick and Maria Van Rensselaer, Brant Schuyler (1659-1702), who married Cornelia Van Cortlandt, Sybilla Schuyler (b. 1664), Philip Schuyler (b. 1666), Johannes Schuyler (b. 1668), and Margritta Schuyler (b. 1672), who married Jacobus Verplanck. The many Schuyler children established the family name and homes, including the Schuyler Mansion in Albany. They were closely related with the great family patroons of New York, the Van Cortlandts. Career Schuyler participated in the military actions of an early French and Indian War in Canada in the 1690s. In 1694, Schuyler traveled into north-western New Jersey to investigate rumors that the French were trying to incite the local Lenni-Lenape population to rebel against the English. Schuyler found no evidence of a rebellion, but discovered a rich fertile valley where the Lenni-Lenape grew a variety of crops. Schuyler reported his findings to the English and then convinced Major Anthony Brockholst, Samuel Bayard, Samuel Berry, Hendrick and David Mandeville, George Ryerson and John Mead to invest in the purchase of the land he referred to as the Pompton Valley. The seven chose Schuyler to be negotiator with the Lenape for the rights to the area. Samual Bayard, however, was chosen to negotiate with the East Jersey Company, which maintained land rights over the area that is now Wayne. Approximately 5,000 acres (20 km¬≤) were purchased on November 11, 1695. He built the Schuyler-Colfax House along the Pompton River. In 1710, he bought a large tract on New Barbadoes Neck. The new purchase (present-day Kearny, North Arlington, and Lyndhurst and Kingsland) had a significant deposit of copper, and the family became wealthy as they started to mine the metal at the Schuyler Copper Mine. Personal life Arent Schuyler married three times, first to Jenneke Teller (1662‚Äì1703) on November 26, 1684. Together, they had: * Margareta Schuyler (b. 1685) * Philip Schuyler (b. 1687), who married Hester Kingsland * Maria Schuyler (b. 1689), who died young * Olivia Schuyler * Judik Schuyler (b. 1692) * Casparus Schuyler (1695‚Äì1754) * Wilhemus Schuyler (b. 1700), who died young After her death in 1703, he married Swantje Van Duyckhuysen (1679‚Äì1724).

They did not have any children. Schuyler died in Belleville, New Jersey, on November 26, 1730. After his death, his widow, Maria Walter, married Archibald Kennedy (1685‚Äì1763), with whom she had five children, including Archibald Kennedy (1736‚Äì1794), who would eventually marry Schuyler's granddaughter, Katherine. =Descendants= Schuyler's son, Peter Schuyler (1710‚Äì1762), was responsible for the introduction of the first steam engine assembled in the United States.

It was awarded the New York Music Critics Circle Award in 1964 . Analysis The quartet is in three movements: #Allegro #Adagio #Allegro Each movement is based on twelve-tone technique, though the character is cool and refined, as usual with Piston. The first movement is a binary sonata form with novel textures, tonal relations, and dynamic twists The second movement is in variation form, with a theme presented initially as if it were a four-voice fugue, and subsequent formal ambiguities. The finale is a seven-part rondo (ABACABA), though the basic design is obscured by a number of formal devices, which led one analyst to believe it is a fugue with three subjects . Discography * 1974.

Many of the larger web publishers of the world use a supply-side platform to automate and optimize the selling of their online media space. A supply-side platform interfaces on the publisher side to advertising networks and exchanges, which in turn interface to demand-side platforms (DSP) on the advertiser side. This system allows advertisers to put online advertising and DOOH advertising before a selected target audience. SSPs send potential impressions into ad exchanges, where DSPs purchase them on marketers' behalf, depending on specific targeting attributes and audience data. By offering impressions to as many potential buyers as possible publishers can maximize the revenue. Therefore, SSPs are sometimes referred to as yield-optimization platforms. Often, real-time bidding (RTB) is used to complete DSP transactions. Unlike advertising networks that target buyers (advertisers), supply-side platforms provide services for publishers (website, app, and DOOH owners). Supply-side platforms are often integrated into the structure of advertising and ad serving companies, as well as ad exchanges that work with both publishers (supply side) and advertisers (demand side).

About 60 artists from 21 countries and 4 continents participate.  Facts  The \\"Biennale f√ºr Lichtkunst Austria 2010\\" is a non-commercial biennale of light art-projects and the first biennale of light art that happened in Austria. The biennale 2010 has the slogan \\"private light in public spaces\\" and runs in several Austrian cities in the autumn of 2010. It started on September 1 in Linz, at nearly the same time as the Ars Electronica festival which started on September 2. The organisation is done by Gallery Artpark Linz, consultant is Peet Thomsen (USA/Copenhagen/Linz). The selection of the artists was curated. Members of the jury were artists and curators, one of them Laura Plana Gracia from Spain.  Concept  This first Biennale for Light Art in Austria wants to generate a cut surface between society and art. The spontaneous conjunction with art in public spaces leans on the art concept of Joseph Beuys from 1965 \\"How to define the paintings to the dead rabbit\\" in D√ºsseldorf. A dialogue should arise between art and the public. The concept was made by the two founders of the Light Art Biennale, Manfred Kielnhofer and Martina Schettina.

It has been serialized in Enterbrain's Harta (formerly known as Fellows!) magazine since October 2008, with serial chapters collected into twelve bound volumes as of December 2019. It won the (\\"Intergenerational Award\\") at the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival in 2012, as well as the Manga Taish≈ç Award in 2014. Yen Press licensed the series for an English-language release in North America. Set in a rural town near the Caspian Sea in Central Asia during the late 19th century, the story revolves around a young woman, Amir, who arrives from a distant village across the mountains to marry Karluk, a young man eight years her junior. The series follows their relationship as it develops, while introducing other storylines about various young women and their daily lives with their respective fianc√©s and husbands along the Silk Road. Characters =Eihon family= The Eihon family descended from nomads, but have lived in a village for several generations. The family is largely patrilocal, but Yusuf, a son-in-law, married into the family. ; :The female protagonist of the story, a twenty-year-old woman and Karluk's bride. She stems from a different (semi-nomadic) tribe. She is skilled in archery, horse-riding, and hunting. A free-spirited, adventurous woman, she is more open and outgoing in her day-to-day activities compared with the rest of the women in the family, who are noticeably more reserved. Despite the noticeable age gap between her and Karluk, she genuinely loves him. Unknown to Amir, some of the men she encounters look down on her because she is considered old for a new bride, and long past the traditional age when women in the society have started having children. ; :The male protagonist of the story, Amir's twelve- year-old husband. He is the youngest son of Akunbek and Sanira. He works very hard to be a good traditional husband to Amir, but because of his young age, he struggles to form a closer relationship with her. Karluk is considered an oddity in that he is younger than his bride; traditionally the bride is usually many years younger than the groom. Some men treat Karluk with pity since they fear that his wife will be too old when he is mature enough to have children with her. ; :Karluk's grandfather. ; :Karluk's grandmother who hails from the same clan as Amir and was at least acquainted with Amir's father prior to her marriage to Mahatbek. Naturally, she is very protective of Amir. Like Amir, she is a skillful archer and rider and remains a fearsome individual despite her advanced age. She is nonetheless a loving matriarch who practices her own brand of tough love. As a firm believer in the importance of needlework, she guides both Pariya and Tileke in realising both the necessity of the skill and the matriarchal history that is passed down through it. ; :Karluk's father. Serves as one of the village elders due to his wealth and status. While he is a traditional man, he is also very understanding and very supportive of Karluk and Amir's marriage. ; :Karluk's mother. ; :Yusuf's wife and Karluk's elder sister. She is often surprised by Amir's carefree and spontaneous personality. She patiently explains to Amir when their tribal customs differ. Her three sons often exasperate her with their rowdiness, but she loves them all the same. ; :Karluk's brother-in-law. Seleke's husband. He lives with his wife's family and proves a loving, though reasonable, father. ; :Daughter of Seleke and Yusuf, and Karluk's niece. As the elder sister of three rowdy brothers, she is more assertive and bossy around them. She loves falcons and is very talented at embroidering. ;, , and :The eldest, middle, and youngest sons of Seleke and Yusuf, respectively, and Karluk's nephews. The trio are playful and rambunctious. Though not malicious, Torkcan and Chalg can go overboard in teasing Rostem, causing him to cry and prompting Yusuf to step in. ; :An English traveler and researcher who lives with the Eihon family. He has been researching the customs, language, and culture of the tribes and peoples. =Residents of the town= ; :A young woman who is introduced in chapter 6; attracted to Amir's free-spirited nature, the two become good friends. Pariya has always struggled to be a traditional woman in the society, but her habit of speaking her mind regardless of situation creates a lot of uncomfortable situations. As a result, she tends to become anxious in social situations, which results in embarrassing outbursts. She is very good at baking and skilled at creating extremely elaborate designs in her bread, which she teaches to Amir. Her father is Togo, a potter, who feels rather resigned at trying to find a suitable husband for his daughter because her outspoken nature tends to scare off potential suitors. This changes when she is betrothed to Umar, much to her joy, but she becomes anxious trying to act more mature and reliable in order to please him, which sometimes leads to unexpected results. :Pariya also appears in a short-comic spin-off of the series called \\"Pariya-san wa Otoshigoro\\". ; :An old man who raises sheep, and told of wolves living around Soma Lake. Introduced in chapter 1. ; :A lovely young woman in the village who is well-regarded because she is skillful at domestic tasks and is well-mannered and good-natured. She is known to have many suitors. Pariya aspires to more like her as she perceives Kamola to be an ideal young woman and tries to discreetly to observe her. When Kamola believes that she has inadvertently angered Pariya due to Pariya's behavior, Pariya admits that she actually looks up to Kamola, who in turn confesses that she admires Pariya's ability to speak her mind. Through Amir's encouragement, Pariya and Kamola become friends. =Halgal family= The family Amir was born into. They are nomadic during the summer. Introduced in chapter 4. ; :Amir's eldest brother, a serious and stoic man. He is a respectful individual who addresses Balkirsh as an \\"esteemed mother\\" and Karluk as an \\"honoured brother\\". He is not present during Amir's wedding, a conspicuous absence that Amir's father-in-law brings up. He struggles between loyalty to his clan and affection for his sister. Though he does not openly oppose his clan's orders, he has expressed frustration over the decisions of his elders. Although he goes along with the attack on Amir's village, he is quick to defend the villagers the moment his clan is betrayed by the Balkans. Initially mistaken for an enemy, he is saved by the village women's intercession. He becomes the leader of the Halgal clan after his father's death in the battle against Amir's village. ; :A maternal cousin of Amir and Azel. His clothing differs from Azel and Baimat's because he is a maternal, not paternal, relative. His deadpan sense of humour and preoccupation with food make him appear more flippant than he is. He disagrees with the clan elders on many matters but does not bother voicing his sentiments because he understands it is futile. This does not stop him from trying to convince Azel to persuade Azel's father, the clan leader, from abandoning the idea to marry Amir to the Numaji as he knows that the Numaji are physically, often fatally, violent to their women. He wants to marry, but understands that the current state of his clan makes it difficult to attract any brides. ; :A paternal cousin of Amir and Azel. Unlike Joruk, Baimato is reserved, stoic, and dependable. He has a stricter sense of morality compared to Joruk and calls the latter out for filching some apricots from a tree in Amir's village. However, like Azel and Joruk, he privately disagrees with the clan elders. He is shown to be a perceptive and encouraging individual, correctly assessing Karluk's feelings towards hunting and Amir, while cheering him up after he makes mistakes while learning to hunt. ; :One of Amir and Azel's younger sisters. Amir describes her as lively and healthy, recalling that Aterui had never been sick. Her death after marrying the Numaji comes as a sudden shock to Amir, but Joruk reveals that she was beaten to death, presumably by her husband. Joruk elaborates that the beating was so severe that her bones shattered, while the matriarch Balkirsh confirms that the Numaji are a violent, barbaric bunch. ; :Another one of Amir, Aterui, and Azel's younger sisters. Like Aterui, she dies shortly after marrying the Numaji. She is heavily implied to have been a victim of domestic abuse. Her death shocks Amir, as she was alive prior to Amir's marriage. Aterui and Karahiga both die within a year of Amir's wedding. =Other characters= ; :A clan notorious for their wealth and brutality. ; :A young nomadic woman living with her mother-in-law. Introduced in chapter 12. Married into her current family at age sixteen, but in a few years became a widow of all its five sons as per tradition, which dictates that a widow with no children marries one of her husband's brothers. Since her father-in-law also died, she helps and keeps company to her mother-in-law instead of going back to her own family. She becomes romantically involved with Mr. Smith. ; :An old nomadic woman. She wishes for Talas to have a future with a loving husband and won't accept any marriage offers that would make her daughter-in-law unhappy, including the one from her uncle. She tries to convince Smith to marry Talas, but fails. Later marries Talas's uncle in order to secure a good match for her. ; :The brother of Talas's father-in-law. A wealthy, aggressive man that wants Talas to be a second wife for his son. He reports Smith to the town's authorities which leads to Smith's arrest and later marries Talas's mother-in-law. ; : Smith's guide to Ankara. Introduced in chapter 15. He is associated with the local military, and unabashedly greedy and resourceful, taking advantage of a situation as he sees fit. He is unmarried, but expresses interest in finding a wife when he feels he has obtained sufficient financial stability. ; : Twin sisters from a thriving fishing village who are of marriageable age. They are very mischievous and are always together, sharing the same ideas about nearly everything. When Mr. Smith and Ali arrive in their village, Laila and Leyli have been causing trouble trying to find wealthy grooms for themselves who will also bend to their will. Their father later marries the two sisters to the first and second sons of one of his friends. ; : Laila and Leyli's father is a fisherman who is strict with his children. He allows Mr. Smith to remain at his house believing he is a doctor. Though he wants to find good husbands for his daughters, he is reluctant to do so because he worries about the expense of dowries for both of them. The twins' mother, , is also very strict with them, often having little patience for their antics and not hesitating to resort to severe methods to ensure they will be good wives someday. However, she cares for them deeply and it is implied she was very much like her daughters when she was young. The girls' family also includes several younger siblings, their maternal aunt, their grandfather, and their grandmother, who proves to be very adept at tricking the twins into doing household tasks. ; : Sarmaan and Farsami are the eldest and second sons, respectively, of a fisherman, and both happen to be fishermen themselves. Their father is an old friend of Laila and Leyli's father and the brothers are childhood friends of the twins. When their father suggests that the twins marry the brothers, they are mostly indifferent and admit to have been expected it. When their fathers are too caught up with arguing about dowries, the brothers are arbitrarily matched to the twins so they will get to know each other better. Both brothers express a mature attitude towards marriage, and with both pairs satisfied with the matches, Sarm is paired with Laila, and Sami with Leyli. ; : The young wife of a wealthy and kindhearted man living in Persia. She is the mother of a young son, Hasan. Smith and Ali are briefly guests in the home of Anis' husband, though Smith never sees Anis herself. Though Anis has everything she could have, she is isolated and lonely until her maid Maarfe encourages her to join her at the public baths. Anis forms an immediate connection with Sherine, with whom she hopes to form a bond of sisterhood with. ; : A taciturn woman married to a poor man and the mother of a son a little older than Hasan. Sherine becomes fond of Anis, finding her endearing. Shortly after she and Anis commit themselves as sisters, Sherine's husband dies because of an illness. Anis persuades her husband to take Sherine on as a second wife and her family joins the household. ; : Pariya's suitor, a young man close to her age whose father raises sheep and runs a traveler's inn. A thoughtful and observant youth, he is skillful at a number of tasks, including calculating figures on an abacus. His father has been searching for a suitable bride for his son for some time and took notice of Pariya when she accompanied the Eihons to find Mr. Smith during his brief engagement to Talas. In contrast to Pariya's other suitors, Umar seems to like Pariya's outspokenness, though she is constantly flustered around him and becomes even more conscientious of her lack of gentle qualities, and Umar's father considers her liveliness to be a positive trait. When her town is severely damaged by the attack from the Halgals, Pariya and Umar's engagement is delayed.

It may also be a variant form of a German surname. Bains shares many of the same origins as the surname Baines.Reaney, P.H. A Dictionary of British Surnames Routledge & Kegan Paul, 2nd edition (1976) Origin of the surname =Northern English= There are two origins for the Northern English surname. #The northern English surname Bains is sometimes derived from a nickname meaning \\"bone\\", which probably referred to someone who was exceptionally tall, or lean. This nickname is derived from the Old English ban, meaning \\"bone\\". In northern dialects of Middle English, the a was preserved, but in southern dialects the a was changed to o (the southern form became the standard). #In other cases, the northern English surname is derived from a nickname of a hospitable person. This nickname is derived from the northern Middle English beyn, bayn, which mean \\"welcoming\\", \\"friendly\\"; these are in turn derived from the Old Norse beinn, meaning \\"straight\\", \\"direct\\". =English/French= An English and French origin of the surname Bains is from the occupational name of an attendant of a public bath house. This name is derived from the Middle English, and Old French baine, meaning \\"bath\\". =French= There are several other derivations of the French surname. #One French derivation of the surname Bains is from a topographic name, for someone who lived near a Roman bath. This name is derived from the Old French baine, meaning \\"bath\\". #In other cases, the name may originate from a habitational name, derived from a place in Ille-et-Vilaine. =Scottish= The Scottish surname Bains is derived from a nickname for a person with fair-hair. This name is derived from the Scottish Gaelic b√†n, meaning \\"white\\", \\"fair\\". The name was common in the Scottish Highlands, and is first recorded in 1324 in Perth. The surname can also be, in some cases, a reduced form of the surname McBain. The Scottish Gaelic form of the surname Bains is B√†ins (masculine), and Bh√†in (feminine). =German= The name may also be a variant spelling of the north German surname Behn. which cited for the surname \\"Erskine\\". =Punjabi= The Punjabi surname Bains is common amongst Punjabi Jats. The meaning of the surname is said to be a word for Buffalo, reflecting the Punjab region's agricultural tradition.https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/punjabi-she-buffalo.1435078/ People with the surname * Addison Bain, retired NASA scientist * Alexander Bain (1818‚Äì1903), Scottish philosopher and educationalist * Alexander Bain (inventor) (1811‚Äì1877), Scottish instrument inventor, technician, and clockmaker * Aly Bain (born 1946), Scottish fiddler * Andrew Geddes Bain (baptised 1797‚Äì1864), South African geologist, road engineer, palaeontologist and explorer * Atu Emberson Bain, Fijian political leader * Barbara Bain (born 1931), American actress * Barbara J.

It was built in 1965 in honor of the Yugoslav Partisans of Mostar who were killed during World War II in Yugoslavia. It's located on Bijeli Brijeg and displays all the features of a complex architectural, aesthetic and landscape design. It is a unique monument in the urban scale of the city of Mostar, and is of particular ambient value. History At the initiative of D≈æemal Bijediƒá, the Serbian architect Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá was put in charge of the design. The Municipal Assembly passed the decision in 1960 and was carried out by Mostar's Parks and Plantations Corporation. Preparation for the cemetery began in October 1960 and work started on 1 December 1960. Ahmet Ribica, a civil engineer, was in charge of drilling and dynamiting works on the hill and constructing the monument. On 25 September 1965, the 20th anniversary of the liberation of Mostar and the formation of the Mostar Battalion, it was opened by Josip Broz Tito. In 1992, the cemetery was badly damaged by war and dynamiting. After the war, the cemetery deteriorated due to severe neglect, vandalism and devastation. On 31 January 2003, a committee composed of Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá, Boris Podreka, Amir Pa≈°iƒá, Darko Minarik, Ekrem Krpo, Zdravko Gutiƒá, Tihomir Roziƒá, Alija Bijavica, Milica Dogan, Florijan Miƒçkoviƒá, Milivoj Gagro, Radmilo Andriƒá, Mumin Isiƒá and Mustafa Selimoviƒá was created in support of renovating the cemetery. By the end of 2004 an operational programme of measures was created. In 2005, works were fixed and various parts of the complex and greenery were reconstructed. On 9 May 2005, the cemetery was formally opened. In 2006, the cemetery was proclaimed a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It opened in 1913 deep in the wilderness of the Boundary Waters, at the juncture of Namakan and Rainy Lakes. Today it is the only lodging operating inside the park, and remains accessible only by water. In 1976 the hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its state-level significance in the themes of commerce, entertainment/recreation, industry, and transportation. It was nominated for its long history of providing lodging and refreshment to fishermen, lumberjacks, traders, and tourists at a key portage deep in a roadless area. With Two years later the hotel was included as a contributing property to the Kettle Falls Historic District. History The site was first patented as a homestead in 1910 by Ida May Winslow. The property passed to Minneapolis surgeon Frederick A. Dunsmoor, who in turn sold the land to William E. \\"Big Ed\\" Rose, a timberman, in 1913. Rose is reputed to have built the north‚Äìsouth wing of the hotel in 1913. Rose sold his Kettle Falls holdings to Robert Sloan Williams in 1918 for $1,000 () and four barrels of whiskey. Williams operated a hotel and nightclub in Ranier, Minnesota, with the Kettle Falls Hotel as a sideline. Williams had a number of run-ins with the law, charged with selling illegal whiskey in Ranier and Kettle Falls, and later operated stills and a smuggling operation. The hotel was electrified by 1935. An annex, called the \\"big house\\", was built behind the hotel in 1946. Bob Williams died in 1956; his widow Lil and step-son Charlie and his wife Blanche continued to run the hotel. Lil Williams died in 1961. The National Park Service acquired the hotel from the Williams family, who continued to operate it, in 1976. The hotel was extensively renovated in 1986-87.

It consists of a network of radial copper wires suspended above the ground, connected to the transmitter feedline ground. It is suspended about 8 feet above ground, so technicians can get access to the helix house at the foot of the tower. Antenna used in Lodge- Muirhead wireless system around 1900, the first counterpoise. In electronics and radio communication a counterpoise is a network of suspended horizontal wires or cables (or a metal screen), used as a substitute for an earth (ground) connection in a radio antenna system. It is used with radio transmitters or receivers when a normal earth ground cannot be used because of high soil resistance or when an antenna is mounted above ground level, for example, on a building. It usually consists of a single wire or network of horizontal wires, parallel to the ground, suspended above the ground under the antenna, connected to the receiver or transmitter's \\"ground\\" wire. The counterpoise functions as one plate of a large capacitor, with the conductive layers of the earth acting as the other plate. The counterpoise evolved with the Marconi (monopole) antenna during the 1890s, the first decade of radio in the wireless telegraphy era, but it was particularly advocated by British radio pioneer Oliver Lodge, and patented by his associate Alexander MuirheadAlexander Muirhead, British patent no. 11271 \\"Hertzian Wireless Telegraphy\\" in 1907. How it works Counterpoises are typically used in antenna systems for radio transmitters where a good earth ground connection cannot be constructed. Monopole antennas used at low frequencies, such as the mast radiator antennas used for AM broadcasting, require the radio transmitter to be electrically connected to the Earth under the antenna; this is called a ground (or earth). The ground must have a low electrical resistance, because any resistance in the ground connection will dissipate power from the transmitter. Low-resistance grounds for radio transmitters are normally constructed of a network of cables buried in the earth. However, in areas with dry, sandy or rocky soil the ground has a high resistance, so a low-resistance ground connection cannot be made. In these cases, a counterpoise is used. Another circumstance in which a counterpoise is used is when earth for a buried ground under the antenna mast is not available, such as in antennas located in a city or on top of a tall building. A common design for a counterpoise is a series of radial wires suspended a few feet above the ground, extending from the base of the antenna in all directions in a \\"star\\" pattern, connected at the centre. The counterpoise functions as one plate of a large capacitor, with the conductive layers in the earth as the other plate. Since the radio frequency alternating currents from the transmitter can pass through a capacitor, the counterpoise functions as a low-resistance ground connection. There should not be any closed loops in the wires of a counterpoise system, as the strong fields of the antenna will induce circular currents in it which will dissipate transmitter power. Use at low frequencies Inverted-L antenna with counterpoise, in a powerful amateur radio station, Colorado, 1920. The counterpoise is the lower grid of horizontal wires, suspended below the antenna. The largest use of counterpoises is in transmitters on the low frequency (LF) and very low frequency (VLF) bands, as they are very sensitive to ground resistance. Because of the large wavelength of the radio waves, feasible antennas used at these frequencies are electrically short, their length is a small fraction of the wavelength. The radiation resistance of antennas (the resistance that represents power radiated as radio waves) drops as their length becomes small compared to a wavelength, so the radiation resistance of antennas on the LF and VLF bands is very low, often as low as one ohm or less. The other, larger resistances in the antenna-ground circuit can consume significant portions of the transmitter‚Äôs power. The largest resistance in the antenna-ground circuit is often the ground system, and the transmitter power is divided proportionally between it and the radiation resistance, so the resistance of the ground system has to be kept very low to minimize the \\"wasted\\" transmitter power. However, at low frequencies the resistance of even a good ground system in high conductivity soil can consume a major portion of the transmitter power. Another source of resistance is dielectric losses from the penetration of radio waves into the ground near the antenna due to the large skin depth at low frequencies. Therefore, particularly at VLF frequencies, large counterpoises are often used instead of buried grounds, to reduce the ground system resistance, allowing more of the transmitter power to be radiated. Sometimes a counterpoise is combined with an ordinary ground, with the buried radial ground cables brought above ground near the base of the antenna to form a counterpoise. The area of the counterpoise around the base of the antenna is often covered with copper screening, to shield the ground to reduce ground currents. Size The size of the counterpoise used for radio work depends on the wavelength of the transmit frequency. With a monopole antenna, the counterpoise functions as a ground plane, reflecting the radio waves radiated downward by the antenna. To perform adequately, the counterpoise should extend at least half a wavelength from the antenna tower in all directions.20th edition of The ARRL Antenna Book in 2003, page 2-16 In designing a counterpoise for a medium-wave radio station, for example, radio-waves are a maximum of long. Therefore, the counterpoise should extend from the tower to make a circle in diameter. See also *Monopole antenna *Tesla coil References External links *Papalexopoulos, A. D., Meliopoulos, A.

They are often identified as the Xiongnu. Identification Chinese annals contain a number of references to the Xunyu. The earliest authors were Sima Qian (c. 145 or 135 BC ‚Äì 86 BC), Ying Shao (AD 140-206), Wei Zhao (204-273), and Jin Zhuo (c. late 3rd or 4th century).Sima Qian, \\"Shiji\\", Bo-na, 1958, Ch. 110, p. 1a Without citing any supporting document, they claimed that Xunyu or Xianyun were names that designated nomadic people who during the Han dynasty were called Xiongnu (ÂåàÂ•¥). That view was also held by the Tang dynasty commentator Sima Zhen (c. 8th century):Taskin V.S., \\"Materials on history of nomadic tribes in China 3rd-5th cc\\", Issue 3 \\"Mujuns\\", \\"Science\\", Moscow, 1992, p. 276, Sima Zhen quoted Zhang Yan (ÂºµÊôè) as saying that ‚ÄúChunwei, during the Yin era, fled to the northern borders.‚Äù; immediately after, Sima Zhen stated that Yue Chan (Ê®ÇÁî¢) wrote in the now-lost Guadipu (Êã¨Âú∞Ë≠ú) \\"Register of the Encompassing Lands\\" that: ‚ÄúJie, (ruler of) the House of Xia lived an immoral life.

Suoyin, chapter 24 Based on phonetical studies and comparisons of inscriptions on bronze and the structure of the characters, Wang Guowei (1877‚Äì1927) came to the conclusion that the tribal names Guifang (È¨ºÊñπ), Xunyu, Xianyu (ÈÆÆËôû), Xianyun (Áç´ÁãÅ), Rong, Di, and Hu in the old annals designated one and the same people, who later entered Chinese history under the name Xiongnu,Wang Guowei, \\"Guantang Jilin\\" (ËßÄÂ†ÇÈõÜÊûó, Wang Guowei collection of works), Ch.2, Ch. 13Taskin V.S., \\"Materials on history of nomadic tribes in China 3rd-5th cc\\", Issue 3 \\"Mujuns\\", p. 276Taskin V.S., 1968, \\"Materials on history of S√ºnnu\\", \\"Science\\", Moscow, p.10 The exact period when the form Xunyu existed as the oldest phonetization of the name Xiongnu remains unclear: Sima Qian stated that in the earlier pre-historic period the Xiongnu were called Hu and Rong, and in the late pre-historic period Xunyu. In the literate period starting with the Shang dynasty (1600‚Äì1046 BC) they were called Guifang, in the Zhou period (1045‚Äì256 BC) they were called Xianyun, and starting from the Qin period (221‚Äì206 BC) the Chinese annalists called them Xiongnu.Sima Qian, \\"Shi Chi\\", Ch. 1, l. 4b, Ch. 110, l. 1a, notesin Taskin V.S., \\"Materials on history of S√ºnnu\\", p.10 See also * Proto-Mongols * List of past Chinese ethnic groups References *Zhonghan Wang, \\"Outlines of Ethnic Groups in China\\", Taiyuan, Shanxi Education Press, 2004, p. 133, Ethnic groups in Chinese history Ancient peoples of China Xiongnu ","title":"Xunyu"},{"id":"28945836","text":"Mill Green is a hamlet in the Brentwood District, in the English county of Essex.

Plot Well-dressed Bill (Spencer Tracy) takes pity on Trina (Loretta Young), a hungry young woman he meets in a city park and treats her to a dinner in a fancy restaurant. After she is finished, he informs the manager he has no money. He then raises such a ruckus that the manager is all too willing to let them go. When Bill learns that Trina is also homeless, he lets her stay at his ramshackle home in a shanty town. Among their neighbors and friends are widowed former preacher Ira (Walter Connolly) and Flossie (Marjorie Rambeau), an alcoholic older woman Ira is trying to reform. Bill is a wandering sort, unwilling to live in the same place too long. Trina falls in love with him, but wisely makes no demands that will make him feel trapped in their developing relationship. When she longs for a new stove, he raises the down payment by serving a summons on Fay La Rue (Glenda Farrell), the star of a show. Far from resenting it, Fay wants him for a playmate. He is tempted, but turns her down. Just as Bill's restless nature starts becoming too much for him, Trina tells him she is pregnant. Ira presides at Bill and Trina's wedding. Before hitting the road by himself, Bill decides to get enough money to support his wife and future child. He agrees to help slimy neighbor Bragg (Arthur Hohl) rob the payroll from a toy factory where Bragg used to work. Ira, the night watchman, shoots Bill before recognizing him, but it is only a flesh wound. Wanting Trina for himself, Bragg turns on the burglar alarm, but Bill gets away with Ira's help. Back home, Trina dresses the wound. Flossie suggests that Bill take Trina away with him, solving Bill's dilemma. After they leave, Bragg threatens to set the police on their track, but Flossie silences him with Ira's gun.

However, with the Production Code in full force, the Hays Office mandated nine minutes of cuts to win a seal of approval. This resulted in a number of blatantly obvious jump cuts where racy dialogue has been removed, as well as the deletion of a shot of a nude Young (or more likely a stunt double) diving into the river. This 66-minute version is all that currently survives, although Sony Pictures (the parent company of Columbia) continues to search for the deleted trims. Columbia's movie channel showed Man's Castle in April 2016. The stated running time is 78 minutes. There are no obvious jump cuts or any apparent attempt to gloss over Trina's pregnancy. Reception =Critical reception= Mordaunt Hall in The New York Times remarked, \\"Even though Frank Borzage in his direction of Man's Castle, ... gives an occasional fleeting reminder of his successful silent film, Seventh Heaven the story is by no means as plausible or as poetic as that memorable old work. ... Man's Castle can, however, boast of the thoroughly efficient portrayals of Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young, particularly Mr. Tracy's. Their work results in much of the narrative being quite interesting and several of the scenes are blessed with touches of originality.\\" The film's box office performance was described as \\"dismal\\".

The raid was in retaliation for the French and Indian Siege of Pemaquid (1696) at present day Bristol, Maine. In the English Province of Massachusetts Bay. Colonel Benjamin Church was the leader of the New England force of 400 men. The raid lasted nine days, between September 20‚Äì29, 1696, and formed part of a larger expedition by Church against a number of other Acadian communities.  Historical context  During King William's War ‚Äì the first of the four French and Indian Wars ‚Äì French and Natives were victorious in the Siege of Pemaquid (1696) (present day Bristol, Maine) earlier that year. In the Siege of Pemaquid, the French and natives had destroyed Fort William Henry, which the English colonial militia leader Benjamin Church himself assisted in erecting. The Acadians at Chignecto posted a proclamation heralding the success of French arms on their church door. In response to the defeat, the following month Benjamin Church led a devastating raid on the Isthmus of Chignecto at Beaubassin in 1696.  The raid  Church and four hundred men (50 to 150 of whom were Indians, likely Iroquois) arrived offshore of Beaubassin on September 20. When they came ashore, the Acadians and Mi'kmaq opened fire on them. Church lost a lieutenant and several of his men. They managed to get ashore and surprise the Acadians. Many fled while one confronted Church with papers showing they had signed an oath of allegiance in 1690 to the English king. Church was unconvinced, especially after he discovered the proclamation heralding the French success at Pemaquid posted on the church door. He burned a number of buildings, killed inhabitants, looted their household goods, and slaughtered their livestock. Governor Villebon reported that \\"the English stayed at Beaubassin nine whole days without drawing any supplies from their vessels, and even those settlers to whom they had shown a pretence of mercy were left with empty houses and barns and nothing else except the clothes on their backs.\\"  Aftermath  On September 29, Church and his men proceeded to the mouth of the Saint John River. Church captured two Frenchmen here and learned from them of cannons buried nearby; these he unearthed and then proceeded towards Boston. At Passamaquoddy, Church's force was met by Colonel John Hathorn who took command of the entire force and proceeded to the Saint John River. They moved up the river to lay siege to the capital of Acadia Fort St. Joseph (Nashwaak) (present-day Fredericton, New Brunswick). The siege failed. Church threatened the Chignecto Acadians before leaving that he would return if more New Englanders suffered. He did return to raid Chignecto again during Queen Anne's War in a campaign against Acadia that also included the Raid on Grand Pre.

For several actions with the 2-VLG-V squadron under command of Captain Jacob Pieter van Helsdingen he received the Vliegerkruis on 24 February 1942. Before World War II =Childhood= Albert Eduard (Ed) Stoov√© was born on 26 December 1920, the third of eight children of Jozeph Leophinus Gaillard Stoov√© and Louise Caroline Fran√ßoise Manz, in Yogyakarta, Netherlands East Indies. His father was of Dutch and German descent; his mother came from a Swiss background. His father was fairly affluent, owning a dairy farm named \\"Louise\\" in Djetis He had trained racehorses and jockeys, delivering racehorses to Sultan Hamengkubuwana VIII of Yogyakarta, so Stoov√© had a relatively easy childhood.Information taken from a genealogy book written by a nephew of Albert Eduard Stoov√©.

Photo taken at end of 1946 by a close friend =Start of service= Having just turned 18 in December 1938, Stoov√© had to report for duty in January 1939. After basic training he joined the Navy, but as he did not feel like being away at sea for months he was granted a transfer to the air force. Because of his family background he was allowed to start pilot training at Kalidjati airfield in Bandoeng-Java. Here he trained several months in a Koolhoven FK 51, and received his wings in December 1939. At first he flew Glenn Martin 139 bombers, but within six months transferred to fighter planes. After a re-organisation of all the squadrons, Stoov√© was added to the newly formed second squadron of aircraft group five (short 2-VLG-V) on 1 July 1941. There he received a \\"personal\\" aircraft, a Brewster F2A Buffalo with serial number B-3117. World War II =Battle of Malaya= Dutch support for the British army in Singapore had already been agreed before war broke out in the Pacific. From October 1940 the Dutch and British agreed to share military information, and one month later the British, Dutch and Australians decided to defend the Pacific area together. On 9 December 1941 several squadrons from the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force, including Stoov√©'s squadron, 2-VLG-V, were sent to Kallang Airfield. The Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force stationed 27 Glenn Martin 139 bombers and 12 Brewster Buffalo fighters at Kallang Airfield for the defense of British Singapore. Stoov√© flew several missions from this airfield; his squadron successfully torpedoed a Japanese destroyer, and they shot down four Japanese fighter planes. During the defense of Singapore one Dutch pilot (Sgt. Groot) lost his life. On 18 January 1942 Stoov√©'s squadron headed back to Java for the defense of the islands of the Dutch East Indies. Stoov√©, together with seven other Brewster Buffalo pilots flew to Semplak, while the other pilots went to Andir and Tjilitian. As the Dutch retreated on the 18th for the defense of Java, they just missed the Battle of Singapore. =Battle of Balikpapan= On 23 January 1942 Stoov√© took part in an air-raid against the Japanese navy fleet off Balikpapan in the Makassar Strait. A total of nine Glenn Martin 139 bombers were escorted by 20 Brewster Buffaloes from 1-VLG-V and 2-VLG-V, each carrying two bombs. The Brewsters managed eight hits on four Japanese ships. During the bombing, Stoov√©'s wingman, Ensign Robert Adolf Rothkrans was shot down and killed. Stoov√© was awarded the Vliegerkruis. =Battle of Java= On 1 March 1942, when Captain van Helsdingen decided to attack Japanese infantry landing on the beach of Eretan Wetan, he chose Stoov√© as his wingman. Around 05:30 am, seven Brewster Buffaloes (five from 1-VLG-V and two from 2-VLG-V) started their engines. An eighth aircraft (from 2-VLG-V) could not participate because the engine had caught on fire during a test-run. The participating pilots from 1-VLG-V were; Captain van Rest, 1st Lieutenant Tideman, 1st Lieutenant Benjamins, Sargeants Adam and van Kempen. While under heavy enemy fire the pilots dropped their bombs on several Japanese battle ships and shot at the landing craft during three runs. Van Rest's aircraft (B-3131) was hit multiple times and after returning to base had to remain on the ground. In almost the same garrison as the first attack (except for Captain van Rest and Sargeant van Kempen who was replaced with Sargeant Compaan) the Brewsters took off for a second attack at 07:45 am. During this run 1st Lieutenant Benjamins and Sargeant Stoov√© were instructed to shoot at Japanese infantry landing on the beach. On his way back to base Stoov√© had to deal with engine problems but returned safely. =Prisoner of war= After the capitulation of the Dutch East Indies on 8 March 1942, Stoov√© was imprisoned in several Japanese POW camps. His longest stay was in a POW camp on the island of Flores, where he and fellow prisoners were forced to build landing strips for the Japanese airforce. After the War =Emigration= After the war had ended, Stoov√© was liberated from the Japanese POW camp on Flores, and served out his army contract until January 1947. When the Netherlands gave up the Dutch East Indies in 1949, and it became Indonesia, it became dangerous for citizens of European descent, in particular ex-military and indigenous civilians who had served the Dutch. After Stoov√© heard from a friend that people were looking for him, he decided to leave. In 1954, Stoov√© together with his wife, Janet Edith van Handenhove, emigrated to the Netherlands. Starting on 12 May, they sailed for three weeks on the MS Willem Ruys from Yogyakarta to Rotterdam. After a short time in pensions they settled in Bloemendaal. =Back in service= Stoov√© heard from an old friend from the Dutch East Indies that the Royal Netherlands Air Force were looking for ex- pilots from the ML-KNIL to fill jobs in the Royal Netherlands Air Force. He was accepted and was stationed at Soesterberg airfield flying for the 334th Squadron, so the family moved to Delft. Stoov√© transported goods and personnel of the Royal Netherlands Air Force, and goods and members of the Royal Dutch Family. At the end of 1975 Stoov√©, aged 55, retired with a pension. After this he worked for 15 years in an Opel garage as a mechanic. He died in a nursing home in Delft, Netherlands, on 23 September 2010. He was 89 years old.

He was asked to take two suitcases to Monte Carlo, but on examination at the airport they contained stolen watches, so he grabbed the cases and ran. All attempts by the couple to remove him from the yacht fail, and they end up going to Rouen, Paris, and finally Monte Carlo. In the meantime, romance has blossomed between Nicholas the stowaway, and Jackie, the young niece of the skipper. They plan to get married, but first Nicholas decides to confront the smugglers, then turn himself in to the police. Unknown to him, the police have been tailing him ever since he left England, and follow him to the hotel, where they overhear him talking with the head of the smugglers, whom they have been trying to nail for years.

The teaching of classics at Oxford has been going on for 900 years, and was at the centre of nearly all its undergraduates' education well into the twentieth century. The Faculty was renamed \\"Classics\\" in 2001 after Philosophy, which had previously been a sub-faculty, became a faculty in its own right. The Faculty of Classics is divided into two sub-faculties of Classical Languages & Literature, and Ancient History & Classical Archaeology. The Faculty organises teaching and research - the main undergraduate programme being known as Literae Humaniores. It also runs a BA programme in Classical Archaeology and Ancient History. The Faculty of Classics is part of the Humanities Division. It runs projects including the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus Project and the Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama. It is the largest Classics department at any university in the world. Location The Faculty is based at the Ioannou School for Research in Classical and Byzantine Studies on St. Giles', next to the Ashmolean Museum and Sackler Library. These three therefore form an informal 'Classics Triangle' in Oxford.

After he is rejected by a woman, a man leaves his safe job and joins a gang that robs banks. The film features actual stock earthquake footage. Plot A telephone line repairman named Joe Graham (Spencer Tracy) lives in Los Angeles. One night he's offered a promotion but declines telling his boss he's happy being a \\"trouble shooter\\" working out in the field solving problems for a living. Later Joe‚Äôs co-worker and partner Dan Sutter cannot work the night shift, and Joe has to work with a new repairman called Casey, who has an aptitude for practical jokes. Joe and Casey run into some odd things during their shift, finding a corpse at the place of their first assignment. When the shift is over, both men go for a drink, and they find their colleague Dan very drunk in a casino. This night the police are on their way to raid the casino, but Casey hears about the raid and manages to warn both his colleagues and the casino owner, causing the raid to be a complete failure. The next day both Casey and Joe are accused of tipping off the owner and causing the raid to be unsuccessful. In an attempt to exculpate himself, Joe tells his boss about the reason for their involvement in the events, and about Dan‚Äôs visit to the casino. The result is that Dan is fired from his position without notice. Joe has been involved with one of the company‚Äôs switchboard operators, Ethel Greenwood. They split up after he suspected her of dating his partner Dan one night when Joe was working overtime. Now he reconciles with her and they go back together. However, soon after they are reunited, Dan tells Ethel about how he got fired from work, and Ethel is upset with Joe for causing it. They break up again. Joe and Ethel don‚Äôt see each other for a while, but he hears she quit her job and started working for another company together with Dan. It turns out the office where they work is a cover-up for a racketeering operation, run by two men by the name of George and Max. Their illegal business idea consists of tapping into the phone lines of a nearby investment company to get secret stock tips. Joe is unaware of this sly operation, until one day when he and Casey are sent to investigate the investment company‚Äôs phone lines. They have complained about the lines malfunctioning, and when Joe sees the tap he discloses the racketeering operation. Joe catches Dan red handed, as he is trying to get into the investment company‚Äôs vaults and steal the contents. The police are notified, and the robbery in progress is stopped, but Dan manages to escape from the crime scene. Joe tips off the police about Dan and they go to his apartment. When they arrive, Ethel is there to meet up with Dan for their trip to Mexico with the bounty from the robbery. Ethel finds Dan shot and killed in the apartment and comes running out into the street in a state of complete hysteria. When the police catch her, she has a check from Dan‚Äôs bosses in her hand, and it has Dan‚Äôs fingerprints all over it. Ethel is arrested for killing Dan and being an accomplice in the racketeering operation. Joe is doubtful of Ethel‚Äôs involvement in the illegal business, and he doesn‚Äôt believe she killed Dan. He decides to find Dan‚Äôs other girlfriend and partner in crime, Pearl Latour. Joe searches all over Long Beach to find her, and eventually he does. Pearl confesses to Joe that she indeed killed Dan, and that the reason was that he was trying to trick her and take the money that was hers. While Joe and Pearl are still talking, an earthquake shakes the whole area, and the house where they are caves in from the shaking. Pearl doesn‚Äôt escape the house in time and is buried under the masses, but is still alive. To get Pearl‚Äôs story about how she killed Dan, Joe and Casey manage to use an emergency phone line to contact her under the debris. Pearl‚Äôs last confession is then heard by the police, and Ethel is released. Before Joe can take Pearl in, however, a huge earthquake hits Long Beach, and Pearl is buried in debris. Joe and Casey rig an emergency phone line, and police Captain Flynn records Pearl's dying confession. Ethel is cleared of all suspicions and released from jail. Upon her release Ethel and Joe are both guests at Casey and his fiancee Maizie‚Äôs wedding at city hall, at which Ethel persuades Joe to get a marriage license of his own.Looking for Trouble Detail View, tcm.com; accessed August 7, 2015.

Before Federation, he was a liberal Minister in the Munro, Shiels and McLean governments. He served seven terms in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1885 before being defeated by F. J. Field in 1902. Joining with Labor, Outtrim successfully recontested Maryborough in 1904 and then served an additional seven terms to 1920 ending his political career as the father of the house. Before the 1890s, there was no formal party system in Victoria. Party labels before that time indicate a general tendency only. From the 1880s, until after Federation in 1901, Victorian politics were dominated by Protectionist Liberals, who were opposed by Free Trade Conservatives. The Labor Party did not emerge as a major party until after 1910, which meant that Victoria was slow to develop a two-party system. Outtrim's political career reflects this strongly. Over the course of his 34-year parliamentary career, Outtrim changed parties several times: from 1885 to 1902 he served as a liberal and supported liberal and reform administrations. In 1902 he was defeated in Maryborough but returned representing Labor from 1904 to 1916. With the split in Labor over conscription Outtrim sided with Prime Minister Billy Hughes and became a Nationalist from 1916. Outtrim was now the father of the Victorian Assembly and in 1920 he was finally defeated by Labor's George Frost. Early life In December 1851, when he was just 6, Outtrim, his two sisters, four brothers and their mother, arrived from England to join their father. Shortly after, his father and youngest brother died and the family was forced to live in a tent in Collingwood. The family moved to Maryborough 1854. As a young man, Outtrim became manager of the Maryborough branch of Cobb and Co, worked as a wine and spirit merchant and, with a brother, purchased the carrying business of McCulloch & Company. Outtrim became a director and legal manager of mining companies. He courted Jane Lavinia Tutcher, who was born in Somerset and had come to Maryborough in 1856. Her mother and stepfather owned the McIvor Hotel. On 7 March 1871, Alfred and Jane married at the Maryborough Christ Church. Between 1871 and 1883, they had five daughters and two sons. By 1885, Outtrim was an auctioneer, general commission agent, district auditor, legal manager, and director of local gold-mining companies. Political career Outtrim unsuccessfully contested Maryborough and Talbot in 1883. A councilor for six years, Outtrim was Maryborough mayor from 1884‚Äì86. In December 1885 Outtrim entered colonial politics winning a by-election for Maryborough and Talbot. He sat on five royal commissions and seven select committees. He was appointed chairman for seven of these. Outtrim introduced the 1896 and 1898 referendum bills against the Victorian Upper House which prompted Sir Alexander Peacock to describe him as a radical politician. In 1899 Outtrim was appointed Railways minister in Allan McLean's liberal government and proceeded to promote regional Victoria, introducing a railway bill to connect Woomelang to Mildura. A supporter of women's suffrage in 1899 Outtrim addressed the Victorian Parliament thus, \\"I notice that those who oppose women's franchise, as a rule, are those who are the wealthiest in the community and they do not know who they are who have to go out between five and six in the morning. But I very often have to catch an early train and travel on these trams and I have no hesitation in saying that there are hundreds of women ‚Äì honest, respectable women ‚Äì travelling at that time of the morning to their occupations, having perhaps sick fathers or mothers depending on their earnings, and doing all they can to keep the wolf from the door.\\" In 1913 Outtrim served as a minister in the 14-day Labor government of George Elmslie. In 1916 Outtrim's loyalty to the British Empire saw him split with the Labor party over their anti- conscription stance and he ultimately joined the conservative Nationalist Party. Outtrim was defeated in Maryborough by Labor candidate George Clement Frost in the 1920 Victorian state election. Outtrim died on 21 December 1925 at his home in Carisbrook east of Maryborough. He was buried with Anglican rites in Maryborough cemetery. He was survived by his wife and four children. For his commemoration his family donated an set of stained-glass windows to Christ Church, where he had been a regular attender and where he and Jane had married 54 years before. The township of Outtrim, southwest of Korumburra, is named after him. Outtrim Avenue in the Canberra suburb of Calwell is also named in his honour.

In the U.S. it was known under this title and also as Doomed Cargo.. The screenplay concerns an American detective and his sidekick, who travel from France to England to take on a gang of international criminals. The film was made at Lime Grove Studios by Gainsborough Pictures.Wood p. 92 Its sets were designed by the Hungarian art director Ern√∂ Metzner. Plot During Carnival in Nice, somewhat drunk, New York private detective Ed Harwood accidentally stumbles into the hotel room of Heinrich Wagner, who had helped him earlier that evening. He finds Wagner dead, but by the time he fetches the hotel manager and others, the corpse has disappeared. They all assume Harwood imagined it, including Caryl Fenton, a Worldwide Insurance Company employee sent to take him to Scotland to investigate a robbery. Unable to convince anyone otherwise, he boards a train with Fenton. However, the train crashes. When Harwood comes to, he finds the missing body nearby. On the dead man's shirt cuff, he finds written an address in Paris; he takes the cuff with him, but the body is afterwards destroyed by fire. He tells Paul Turb√©, the assistant prefect of police, his theory that the wreck was deliberate, to try to conceal the murder. Turb√© confirms that it was no accident ‚Äì the railway signals were tampered with ‚Äì but is skeptical of Harwood's hypothesis. Harwood bets him $5000 that he will catch the killer, and devotes no further attention to the case in Scotland (which is eventually solved without his and Fenton's help). In Paris, Harwood and Fenton go to the address; they inform the occupant, whose name is Hoyt, that Wagner was killed in the train wreck. The man claims he had not heard of the wreck, although it is the front-page story of the newspapers in his wastebasket. Harwood recognizes a photo of a Buenos Aires racetrack, but the man says it came with the apartment. That night, Harwood breaks into the place, with Fenton in tow. They find the suite almost completely empty of furniture. However, Harwood finds an old banquet invitation from the \\"Lord Mayor Elect and the Sheriffs of London\\" to \\"Axel Hoyt and party\\". Gunshots from across the street proves that the case is real. They find a photograph of the banquet, showing Hoyt seated together with Wagner. A woman nearby is wearing a unique dress, which they trace to an Elizabeth Wentworth. At an event for a charity called Pilgrims of Peace, Harwood manages to strike up a conversation with Wentworth. When he remarks that recently he saw her acquaintance, Hoyt, she informs him that Hoyt died three years ago. They trace the doctor responsible for Hoyt's death certificate, but he has been unexpectedly called away to Southampton. They drive off after his train, but he is killed when it crashes into a lorry left on the tracks at a crossing. While talking to the local chief constable, Harwood is surprised when Turb√© shows up. Turb√© shows him that the doctor's cuff link looks exactly like Wagner's. In fact, they show the emblem of the Pilgrims of Peace. Harwood and Fenton attend a Pilgrims of Peace rally, where Hoyt is calling himself Father Planchat. They learn that the leaders are about to board a relief ship bound for Bordeaux. To escape, Harwood starts a brawl. He and Fenton race to catch the boat train, where they encounter both Turb√© and the Pilgrims' leaders. Harwood asks Turb√© to bring the two Scotland Yard agents in on his signal. Then Harwood and Fenton confront the Pilgrims in the dining car. Harwood has been in touch with the Buenos Aires police: he now accuses the Pilgrims of gunrunning, something Hoyt also did there. However, as Harwood glances at Turb√©, he realises that he too was in the banquet photograph, with his back turned. Harwood informs the gang members that Turb√© has double-crossed them. He was worried about being exposed, but his associates applied pressure to force him to continue working with them. Instead, he set about killing them all. Turb√© uncouples the dining car, leaving it to be destroyed by a following train. The gang try to escape from the front of the car, but the door is locked; they are killed. Harwood and Fenton survive by escaping from the back. Turb√© is killed while trying to escape arrest. Afterward, Harwood and Fenton decide to get married.

Directed by Professor Nicholas Cronk, it forms part of Oxford's Humanities Division.  Origin  In the 1950s, the bibliographer and translator Theodore Besterman started to collect, transcribe and publish all of Voltaire's writings. He founded the Voltaire Institute and Museum in Geneva where he began publishing collected volumes of Voltaire's correspondence. During the final years of his life, Besterman opened discussions with the University of Oxford. These culminated in him naming the university his residuary legatee and arranging for the posthumous transfer of his collection of books and manuscripts, which included many collective editions, to the Taylor Institution (the university centre for modern languages). The Institution dedicated a room as the Voltaire Room in January 1975, to house Besterman's collection and The Taylor Institution's own.

More reputation, however, he gained early as an amateur astronomer. In 1919, he was charged with selling the equipment of the closed observatory in Bothkamp. In 1922, Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg engaged him for the newly set-up observatory in Wolfersdorf. Afterwards Kisshauer moved to the near Jena where he worked at Carl Zeiss and wrote first publications on astronomy and projection planetaria designed by Walther Bauersfeld. In 1926, he founded and led the municipal planetarium of Dresden, situated north-west of Gro√üer Garten.

His story is mentioned by Jordanes in the Getica (550‚Äì551); in the preceding years, the Ostrogoths under Ermanaric had conquered a large number of tribes in Central Europe (see Oium), including the Antes. Some years after the Ostrogothic defeat by the invading Huns, a king named Vinitharius, Ermanaric's great-nephew, marched against the Antes of Boz and defeated them. Vinitharius condemned Boz, his sons, and seventy of his nobles, to crucifixion, in order to terrorize the Antes. These conflicts constitute the only pre-6th century contacts between Germanics and Slavs documented in written sources. History =Background= Byzantine historian Jordanes wrote in his De origine actibusque Getarum (or \\"Getica\\", written in 550 or 551) that King Ermanaric ( 370s) of the Greuthungi (a Gothic tribe, most likely the same as the later Ostrogoths), member of the Amali dynasty, managed to subdue a large number of tribes in Europe (Cassiodorus called him \\"ruler of all nations of Scythia and Germania\\"), and he is said to have lastly subjugated the Wends (Slavs). Jordanes noted that the Gothic tribes regularly made raids into Slavic territory. Jordanes mentioned three tribes of the same origin, that constituted the Slavs: Wends (West Slavs), Antes (East Slavs) and Sklaveni (South Slavs), and stated that the Antes were the bravest and strongest among these.; He also stated that the Antes' rule was hereditary, while Procopius maintained that the Sklaveni and Antes \\"are not ruled by one man, but they have lived from old under a democracy\\". According to Ukrainian scholar Roman Smal-Stocki (1893‚Äì1969), the Antes received a strong ruling power and military organization over time from the Gothic influence. They inhabited the area between the Dniester and Dnieper, most likely in the region extending from the Vistula to the Danube mouth and eastwards to the Don. The tribal union of the Antes probably included some neighbouring West Slavic tribes. The Antes seem to have attempted to form their own state in the frontiers of, or even within, the Gothic state, judging by Jordanes' naming Boz as \\"king\\". =Story of Boz= Approximate location of the Ostrogoths, Antes, Huns and Alans in 380. The Huns, accompanied by the Alani whom they had just conquered, invaded Ermanaric's territories. Ermanaric, who feared devastation, took his own life. In the years following Ermanaric's death, there was a war between the section of the Ostrogoths who remained under Hun rule, and the Antes.; Ermanaric's great-nephew, Vinitharius, who disliked being under Hun rule, withdrew his forces and marched against the Antes in order to defeat them and to show his courage. This took place in the last quarter of the 4th century, possibly around 380. Boz, the king of the Antes (rex Antorum), had organized an alliance to defend the Antes, and managed to defeat Vinitharius in their first encounters, however, Vinitharius fought valiantly and managed to capture and crucify Boz, together with his sons and 70 of his chiefs (primates). Vinitharius left their bodies hanging to induce fear in those who had surrendered. These conflicts constitute the only pre-6th century contacts between Germanics and Slavs documented in written sources. =Aftermath= Afterwards, the Alans (according to contemporary Marcellinus, though Jordanes said it was Huns) rushed to rescue their kin, with a decisive battle fought against the Ostrogoths at the river Erak (now called Tylihul), in which the Ostrogoths were defeated and pushed west. The Ostrogoths eventually reached the lower Danube shores. Assessment Historian Florin Curta believes that Jordanes' account regarding Boz and Vinitharius possibly originated in the Gothic oral tradition, given the narrative pattern of the story. He views of Boz as \\"quasi-legendary\\", as he is the only Slavic leader mentioned by Jordanes, while no leader is mentioned by Procopius. Some historians have tried to identify Boz with Bus mentioned in the Tale of Igor's Campaign, in which boyars tell Sviatoslav I of Kiev (r. 945‚Äì972) of \\"Gothic maidens ... singing about the time of Bus\\", but this has been refuted.; ; The first to connect the two was O. Ohonovskyj in 1876. He was later supported by S. Rospond. Jordanes wrote his name in Late Latin as Boz (\\"Boz nomine\\"), though several manuscripts of the Getica use Box or Booz. There are various theories in etymological studies regarding the name. The name has been rendered in the Slavic languages as (, ; transliterated as ). One theory is that it derives from the Slavic word bog, \\"God\\", interpreted as \\"God's\\", \\"Godly\\". Polish linguist Stanis≈Çaw Urba≈Ñczyk (1909‚Äì2000) mentioned (divine), (chief), and ' (barefooted) as possibilities. Polish papyrologist noted that \\"chief\\" was a possibility as it corresponded to the circumstances. Polish linguist Stanis≈Çaw Rospond (1906‚Äì1982) concluded that , \\"barefooted\\", was his name, and that the other etymologies put forward by Urba≈Ñczyk were less probable; he supported this by connecting Boz with Bus () of The Tale of Igor's Campaign, as (1833‚Äì1894) had first done in 1876. Ukrainian scholar Mykhailo Hrushevsky (1866‚Äì1934) speculated that his name was \\"perhaps Bozhko, Bozhydar, Bohdan\\". Ukrainian historian Bohdan Struminsky stressed that as the first palatalizations (g—å > ≈æ—å, etc.) had not yet occurred in Slavic at the time of Boz, was unconvincing and \\"even less acceptable\\". Although supporting the connection with Bus, he assumed that it was Gothic, as , found in similar variants as West Gothic , of uncertain date, \\"probably meaning 'Sorcerer'\\", and Anglo-Saxon B≈çsa, from the 7th century. Others have theorized an Iranian etymology (Bwzrmyhr or Burzmipuhr). German historian F. Altheim (1898‚Äì1976) treated the Hunnic name Bozos as derived from , a short form of Iranian . His title, rex Antorum, translates to \\"King of the Antes\\".; ; Ukrainian historian (1902‚Äì1985) assumed, as Jordanes used rex for both Germanic rulers and the ruler of the Antes, that the Eastern Slavs had adopted \\"*kuning-\\" from the Goths and Slavicized it into \\"k«înƒôdz«ê\\" (knyaz), translated by Jordanes as \\"rex\\".

National flag ‚Äì flag of Israel  Flag of Israel The flag of Israel is the official flag of the State of Israel, which represents the state, its sovereignty, its institutions and its citizens both in Israel and worldwide. This flag has a white background and two horizontal blue stripes, charged with a blue Star of David (Magen David) in the middle. The flag was conceived during the period of the First Aliyah and was adopted as the flag of the Zionism since the movement's inception in 1897. The flag was officially chosen as the flag of the State of Israel on 28 October 1948, and it was favoured over other flag proposals mainly due to the popularity it gained among the Jewish population in Israel. The two blue stripes represent a tallit or prayer shawl, and both sides of the split Red Sea that the Hebrews walked through as written in the Book of Exodus. The Star of David also represents the Jewish identity of Israel, as well as the culture and history of the Israeli people.  National emblem ‚Äì emblem of Israel  Emblem of Israel The emblem of Israel is an escutcheon which contains a menorah in its center, two olive branches on both sides of the menorah and at the bottom the label \\"Israel\\" in Hebrew. The emblem was designed by the brothers Gabriel and Maxim Shamir, and was officially chosen on 10 February 1949 from among many other proposals submitted as part of a design competition held in 1948.  National anthem ‚Äì \\"Hatikvah\\"  The words of Israel's national anthem, \\"Hatikvah\\" \\"Hatikvah\\" is the national anthem of Israel. The anthem was written in 1878 by Naphtali Herz Imber, a secular Galician Jew from Zolochiv (today in Lviv Oblast), who moved to the Land of Israel in the early 1880s. The music to Haitkvah was composed by Samuel (Shmuel) Cohen, adapted from a Moldovian-Romanian folk song, in 1888. The poem was subsequently adopted as the anthem of Hovevei Zion and later of the Zionist Movement at the First Zionist Congress in 1897. The text subsequently underwent a number of other changes. \\"Hatikvah\\" is one of only a few national anthems in the world which is in a minor scale, such as \\"Mila Rodino\\" (Bulgaria) and \\"Meni√± Qazaqstanƒ±m\\" (Kazakhstan); the anthems of some other Asian countries are of a different tonality such as Japan and Nepal. Though it sounds mournful, the song is optimistic and uplifting as the title (which means \\"hope\\") suggests. The anthem's theme revolves around the nearly 2,000-year-old hope of the Jewish people for freedom and sovereignty in the Land of Israel, a national dream that was later realised with the founding of the modern State of Israel in 1948.  National colors ‚Äì blue and white  The national colours of Israel are officially blue and white as seen on the flag of Israel. The origin of the combination of these colors is from the Bible, in which they are mentioned in several instances. Blue and white are also the traditional team colours of the Israel national sporting teams.

He is best known for his role in the posthumous attempts to publish, and then for trying to suppress, several of Milton's State Papers, including De Doctrina Christiana. Biography Skinner is presumed to have been a relative of Cyriack Skinner. Biographer Henry John Todd believed him to be probably Cyriack's nephew. He was educated at Westminster School until 1670, and was a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. The college's register records him as 2 October 1674. Daniel Skinner juratus et admissus in socium minorem. and as May 23d, 1679. Daniel Skinner juratus et admissis in socium majorem. These dates, the normal date of admission for major Fellows being July not May and the normal interval between minor and major Fellowship being a year and a half, indicate the extraordinary circumstances that surround Skinner's Fellowship at Trinity. Skinner attempted to arrange for the posthumous printing and publication, outside England, of some of Milton's state papers, which were at the time unlikely to be publishable in England. In 1675, via Symon Heere, who is presumed to be a Dutch boat skipper, he contacted a printer in Amsterdam, Daniel Elzevir of the House of Elzevir, and attempted to have Elzevir publish Milton's Letters. However, Elzevir was reluctant to do so, and (as he later reported in a letter, dated 1676-11-20, to Sir Joseph Williamson, then Secretary of State) after he had received the manuscripts contacted Skinner in Cambridge to tell him that he was unwilling to publish them, given their contents. Elzevir had sent the manuscripts on for review by Philipp van Limborch, at the time a professor at Remonstrant College. In the meantime, Skinner was approaching Samuel Pepys, whose resident mistress was Mary Skinner, Daniel's sister, about the possibility of patronage. He wrote an ornate and lengthy letter in Latin, which has since been lost, to Pepys on 1676-07-05, in which he noted that after four years he had still not been fully elected Fellow of Trinity. Elzevir reported to Williamson that Skinner came to Amsterdam to retrieve the manuscripts from Elzevir, and told Elzevir that he was glad that Elzevir had not published anything, and that he would have bought up and destroyed all copies if Elzevir had. Skinner afterwards stayed out of England, with the manuscripts, but was subjected to official reprimand and recall. Isaac Barrow, Master of Trinity College, wrote to Skinner, ordering him: Skinner followed the order, and in 1679 obtained his major Fellowship. In a letter to Williamson, W. Perwich, the government agent who had conveyed Barrow's instruction to Skinner, who at the time was in Paris, records Skinner's reaction to the order thus: Skinner's supplication for his M.A. and subscription to the Three Articles was done via proxy. His supplicat, in the University Archives, is dated 1677-01-30. At that time, Skinner was still in Paris, and the supplicat itself is signed by the Proctor on his behalf. Skinner's return to Trinity College in 1679 follows the calling of his religious beliefs into question. Although the signing of a supplicat implied (at the time) that one intended to be a Protestant; because Skinner's was signed by the Proctor, possibly not with Skinner's authorisation, it is not necessarily the case that Skinner intended to be one. The Master and Senior Fellows of the college, in March of that year, had issued a further order to Skinner, that he \\"come home to the College to clear himself of suspicion of being a papist\\". What is unusual about this request is that such suspicion usually arose from a person's unwillingness to sign the oath of supremacy, a necessary part of the M.A. degree that in turn was a requirement for Major Fellowship of the college. However, by that point, Skinner had already received his M.A. (almost two years earlier, in 1677). Whatever the difficulty may actually have been, for which documentary evidence does not survive, it was overcome. (Campbell advances the hypothesis that Skinner was elected by Royal Mandate, under the patronage of Williamson, against the opposition of the College Seniors.) After becoming a Major Fellow, Skinner once gain left Cambridge. On 1679-06-04 \\"Mr Daniel Skinner a protestant\\" was issued with a passport. He is identified with the \\"young mister Skinner\\", discussed in a 1680-07-08 letter by Pepys, who was resident in Barbados and Mevis in 1680-1681\\\\. William Howe, Pepys' correspondent, replied on 1681-06-15 telling Pepys that he had attempted to place Skinner in the employment of Edwin Stede of the Royal Africa Company upon Skinner's arrival at Barbados, but that Stede declined to employ Skinner. Thereupon Howe placed Skinner with a friend who was a lawyer. Skinner's legal career lasted roughly one week, and had left for Mevis. Skinner returned again to Trinity College that same year, and his religious beliefs were still doubted at the college. Writing style Skinner's writing style, in particular his abilities with Latin, are of particular concern to scholars, in that they shed light on his presumed r√¥le as amanuensis. Gordon Campbell observes that the Latin that Skinner used in his letter to Pepys \\"contains small touches which would have been condemned by Milton or any purist\\", and that Skinner's mistakes \\"while fairly rare, seem to point to a limited competence in Latin rather than carelessness\\". Campbell notes that Skinner's occasional slips in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew render suspect the oft-made assertion that Skinner was one of Milton's pupils; pointing out that whilst the Latin of Picard's portion of De doctrina Christiana is \\"virtually perfect\\", Skinner's chapters of the same contain \\"a light sprinkling of errors\\". (Dr Charles Richard Sumner records 27 errors in Skinner's work, but only four in Picard's, which is longer than Skinner's.)

Later on the class was seen on many other parts of the GWR system. Sixty \\"Metro\\" Tanks were built, from 1868 onwards, during the lifetime of their designer, Joseph Armstrong. His successor William Dean regarded the class so highly that he would add a further 80, the final 20 examples appearing as late as 1899. The \\"Metros\\" were all built at Swindon Works, in nine lots of ten or 20 engines each. Numbering They were numbered as followed: * 455-470, 3-6 (Lot 18, 1869) * 613-632 (Lot 25, 1871) * 967-986 (Lot 38, 1874) * 1401-1420 (Lot 47, 1878) * 1445-1464 (Lot 57, 1881/2) * 1491-1500 (Lot 91, 1892) * 3561-3570 (Lot 96, 1894) * 3581-3590 (Lot 117, 1899) * 3591-3599, 3500 (Lot 119, 1899) Nos. 3-6 were briefly numbered 1096-1099 when new, and No. 3500 was numbered 3600 until December 1912. No. 3593 was rebuilt as a 2-4-2T in 1905. Variations The first two batches had inside frames on all axles, but subsequently the leading wheels had outside axleboxes. The original 20 engines had a shorter coupled wheelbase than all the others, 8'0\\" rather than 8'3\\". Nos. 455-470 were partially rebuilt with longer wheelbases when first reboilered, in the 1880s, though not between the coupled wheels. Many of the earlier engines were rebuilt with larger tanks when reboilered, while the locomotives built in 1899 had still larger side tanks and coal bunkers when new; Nos. 1401-1410 were likewise rebuilt with larger tanks about the same time. Because of all these variations, the class is said to have existed in Small, Medium and Larger varieties. They all had driving wheels of 5'0\\" diameter (later sometimes enlarged by the use of thicker tyres to 5'2\\") and 16\\" x 24\\" cylinders. The earlier locomotives also differed from each other as to the boilers fitted. None of the originals had cabs - Armstrong always considered that these had a bad effect on the crew's attentiveness - but both half and full cabs were added later, and were provided from new on the later batches. A proportion of the class was intended to be fitted with condensing apparatus, for service on the Metropolitan: Nos. 613-622, 967-976, 1401-1410, and the engines of the last three batches. However, photographs show that some engines in the series did not in fact carry the apparatus. In their later years, from 1905, some of the class was fitted with autotrain apparatus for push-pull working. Use Up to the electrification of the Metropolitan and the District in 1905-7, the Metros operated on various underground routes. The original GWR services (1863) on the Metropolitan were broad gauge, but from 1869 standard gauge trains ran through to Moorgate Street; these were extended to Bishopsgate (Liverpool St) in 1875 and Aldgate in 1894. The GWR also provided about half the trains on the Hammersmith & City, and much of the Metropolitan's Aldgate-Paddington-Richmond service. The other principal service was the so-called Middle Circle, which differed from the later Circle Line in being routed via Addison Road (Olympia) and the West London Line. After the electrification of these services, the GWR continued to provide services from Notting Hill to Gunnersbury (until 1910) and from Old Oak Common to Victoria (until 1915); these were not in tunnel so did not require condensing locomotives. Naturally, the \\"Metro\\" tanks lost their condensing apparatus in their later years. For the \\"underground\\" services the GWR maintained a fleet of about 50 \\"Metro\\" Tanks. Later the class continued to work on outer suburban services from Paddington, where O. S. Nock recalled many lively and precise runs with the class as late as c.1930. They were finally ousted by the 6100 Class after the rebuilding of Bishop's Road station at Paddington in 1933. Other than this, the class found much use around the GWR's Southern Division. Typical centres were Swindon, Oxford and Gloucester, while others were also seen in South Wales and in the West of England. They even hauled main-line trains on cross-country routes such as Gloucester- Cardiff, being capable of remarkably fast running when needed. After the end of their \\"underground\\" work some also appeared in the Northern Division, at Wellington and elsewhere. Withdrawal 3588 at Swindon in 1950, after withdrawal Withdrawal of the earlier locomotives began around 1900, though many others proved long-lived and worked on into the 1930s. Ten of the William Dean 3561-3599 series survived in British Railways ownership in 1948, though the last of them, No. 3599, was withdrawn in December 1949.

He is best known for having commanded the Norwegian Army in the first days after the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, and for having been replaced because of what was seen by the leading Norwegian politicians as passive leadership. Early life and family He was born in Ullensaker as a son of farmers Kristian Gulbrandsen Laake (1835‚Äì1875) and Karen Pedersen Taugland (1839‚Äì1903). His older brother Knut M. Laake, a cavalry officer, became a politician and activist, and Kristian Laake joined the Liberal Party as well. On 24 September 1901, Laake married Nes-born farmer's daughter Signe Henaug (28 November 1879 ‚Äì 8 January 1960). The couple had three children, and in 1908 they acquired the farm Stalsberg in Skedsmo, Akershus. One of their daughters married entomologist Leif Reinhardt Natvig. Military career He finished his secondary education in 1894 and graduated from the Norwegian Military Academy in 1897 and the Norwegian Military College in 1900. He served in the artillery, and reached the rank of colonel in 1928. Laake commanded the 3rd Artillery Regiment in 1928-1929, and then the 1st Artillery Regiment from 1929. He spent April‚ÄìMay 1929 with the 2nd Prussian Artillery Regiment in Germany. In 1931 he was appointed as the Commanding General of Norway. He received the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1934, and held the Order of the White Rose of Finland (Grand Cross), the Order of the Sword (Grand Cross) and the Order of the Dannebrog (Knighthood). Becoming Commanding General The appointment on 6 February 1931 of Kristian Laake as Commanding General of the Norwegian Army was a controversial one. The preceding Commanding General, Ivar Bauck, reached the age limit for Commanding Generals on 12 February of that year. When the Liberal Party cabinet appointed Laake, it was generally viewed as a political move to enable the cabinet to push through reforms of the Norwegian Army. A member of the Liberal Party himself, Laake fully expressed full support for the politicians as they reduced the budgets for the Norwegian armed forces. The general had taken part in shaping the party's new reduced-size army plans, which his predecessor had opposed vigorously.Ag√∏y 1997: 260 In Laake's opinion it was vital for soldiers to loyally accept the decisions of the politicians in all respects.Ag√∏y 1997: 261 Laake's appointment was also criticized because of his lack of previous service on the general staff. Laake had only served in the general staff until 1912, at that time holding the rank of adjoint, the second lowest officer's rank in the general staff. It was almost unheard of that an officer with such limited general staff experience should be appointed Commanding General. Internal security issues During Laake's first years as Commanding General the issue of the army's preparations to deal with possible revolutions came up. At the time the Norwegian minister of defence was the future fascist collaborator Vidkun Quisling. Quisling saw internal troubles and revolutionary activities as a clear and present threat to the state, and on several occasions in the summer of 1931 employed the military to assist the police forces. Laake disagreed with Quisling's views on the social and political stability of Norway, and repeatedly opposed and delayed the defence minister's internal security measures.Ag√∏y 1997:262-263, 265 Among the anti-revolutionary measures that Laake opposed was blocking industrial labourers from serving in the Norwegian Royal Guards.Ag√∏y 1997:278-279 At the time, both conservative and left-wing organizations were providing non-governmental military training for volunteers. Laake attended exercises held by the conservative organizations, although he was also criticized by the same organizations for not giving them enough support.Ag√∏y 1997:287-303 In 1932 Laake opposed vague instructions from Quisling that units from paramilitary organization should be mobilized in times of crisis, and requested direct and clear orders as to which units this would include, and from which organizations. The implication was that Quisling wanted the conservative Samfundsvernet to be given an open, contra-revolutionary role as units separate from the army. Laake instead suggested that those members of voluntary organizations who had a military background would be mobilized, while those without formal ties to the military would not. In this case, Laake was overruled by Quisling and the Ministry of Defence.Ag√∏y 1997:304-308 During the same time, Quisling was working on plans for a coup, using paramilitaries to seize power. Quisling wanted to bypass Laake in this regard, as he suspected that the general would refuse to cooperate.Ag√∏y 1997:310-313 After months of planning, Quisling's coup plans did not come to fruition and the cabinet in which he served lost power in 1933.Ag√∏y 1997:326-327 During the 1930s the Norwegian Army was often troubled by anti-military protesters, both from outside and within its own ranks of conscripts. General Laake saw it as very important for the status of the military to arrest such agitators and hand them over to the police for prosecution, even though the protesters were rarely convicted in court.Ag√∏y 1997:347-350 The army continued to have a counter-revolutionary function, and as late as in November 1937 Laake approved the inclusion of mountain artillery in the units in Western Norway which were designated to deal with internal troubles. He did, however, refuse to allow air support to be used for possible internal security operations. Only in 1938 did the army begin to scale down its preparations to put down a revolution.Ag√∏y 1997: 361 The process of dismantling the anti-revolution preparations in the Norwegian Army began in 1936, and was founded to end the fears of the establishment of a revolution led by the Norwegian Labour Party. Laake was considered a moderate amongst the military in this regard.Ag√∏y 1997:369-370 Second World War On 9 April 1940 Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany. Laake was perceived as too passive by the political leadership, and he was asked to resign on 10 April. He stepped down on 11 April. =Prelude= Following the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Laake had repeatedly warned the Norwegian authorities of the possibility that the war could reach Norway in a sudden manner.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 9 In the first months of the war, the Norwegian Army Air Service's fighter flight Jagevingen had orders not to fire at intruding aircraft. This order was changed by General Laake on 5 March 1940 and Norwegian Gloster Gladiator fighter aircraft were given the task of preventing intrusion into Norwegian airspace by aircraft belonging to the warring parties. Laake gave the Norwegian fighter pilots permission to use force if necessary to ward off intruders.Guhnfeldt 1990: 43 Before the outbreak of war, Laake had been one of a number of prominent Norwegians to support giving Neville Chamberlain the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the Munich Agreement with Nazi Germany in September 1938.Fure 1996: 198 On 8 April 1940, after the British had announced that they had laid three naval mine fields along the Norwegian coast to force German shipping out of neutral Norwegian waters, Laake and the general staff contacted minister Ljungberg and suggested mobilizing the Norwegian Army. The most wide-ranging of the suggestions involved mobilizing significant forces in southern and western Norway. Defence Minister Birger Ljungberg then advised the government to postpone the decision to the next day. The same day that the British mine fields had been laid, a German ship carrying troops and war mat√©riel had been sunk by the Polish submarine Orze≈Ç off the southern Norwegian port of Lillesand. The British mine fields, however, overshadowed this news.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 10-11 Although many alarming incidents were taking place in the days leading up to the invasion, no orders came through from the politicians, and Laake preferred to wait passively for orders rather than act, believing the government to be relying on better intelligence than he had access to. Only on 8 April did he suggest a partial mobilization.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 59 Three days earlier, on 5 April, Laake had been among some 200 prominent Norwegians to attend a party held at the German legation in Oslo. At the party, the Germans had shown their guest from the political and military elites of Norway a dramatic propaganda film about their conquest of Poland the year before.Guhnfeldt 1990: 55 On the evening of 8 April, Laake boarded a train that brought him to his farm near Str√∏mmen, east of Oslo, where he was to celebrate his 65th birthday on 9 April 1940.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 17 =War= At 2330 hours Laake was warned by chief of the general staff Rasmus Hatledal that foreign warships were intruding on Norwegian territorial waters.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 47 Before Laake could get back to Oslo minister of defence Ljungberg, the latter had left the general staff's offices to attend a cabinet meeting. The top officers of the Norwegian Army were gathering at the general staff in Oslo.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 53 In the early hours of 9 April 1940, Hatledal repeatedly attempted to get in contact with defence minister Ljungberg, and confusion reigned in the general staff as no orders from the politicians came. No attempts were made by the general staff at preparing for mobilization by warning the telegraph offices, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, or the newspapers. General Laake was of the opinion that it served no purpose to prepare for mobilization, as the mobilization itself would take at least three days to carry out in any case. The situation remained uncertain, with no declarations of war from Germany.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 58 Defence minister Ljungberg had informed the military leadership of the government's decision to mobilize at around 0200hrs on 9 April. Both Laake and the general staff understood the orders from Ljungberg to entail a partial and silent mobilization. This led to much confusion amongst both the military and the civilian population. At the same time, minister of foreign affairs Halvdan Koht was reported to have said that orders for a general mobilization had been issued.Voks√∏ 1994: 25 Laake reached minister Ljungberg by telephone at 0200hrs and discussed mobilizing the army. Laake suggested mobilizing the 1st to the 4th Brigades of the army, meaning most of the forces ready for mobilization in Eastern, Southern and Western Norway. This was the most wide-ranging of the mobilization alternatives that Laake had proposed on 8 April. Ljungberg quickly received approval from the government, and relayed the message to Laake. The government had agreed with a mobilization and left it to the military to decide on the details. After the telephone conversation, an argument quickly broke out between Laake and Hatledal. Hatledal viewed the mobilization in question was inadequate and wanted a total and open mobilization, rather than the silent and partial mobilization by mail that Laake was organizing. Laake stated that if Hatledal wanted an open mobilization then he could discuss it with minister Ljungberg when the minister arrived at the general staff at Akershus Fortress.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 65-66 In the end, Hatledal went against orders and declared 11 April as the first mobilization day, instead of 12 April. The chief of the general staff also expanded the mobilization from 24,000 men to 38,000 and included Tr√∏ndelag in the mobilization area. Hatledal did not disobey orders to the extent that he carried out a total mobilization, which would have involved 100,000 soldiers, or make the mobilization an open one. The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and the newspapers were left out of the system. No mobilization posters were posted. Meanwhile, General Laake had returned to his farm at Str√∏mmen to retrieve his toiletries. He left his uniform and military effects with his subordinates.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 74-75 During much of 9 April 1940, the Norwegian armed forces were left leaderless on the top levels, the general staff having evacuated Oslo, and General Laake stuck at Str√∏mmen without his uniform while he was waiting for a taxi to pick him up at his farm. When a taxi finally arrived and brought him to Slemdal, the general staff had already evacuated to Eidsvoll without making arrangements for Laake's transport. Laake duly walked to the nearby Slemdal station and took the Holmenkoll Line to Majorstuen to find a taxi. Having failed again in finding transport, Laake made his way to Norges Geografiske Oppm√•ling to try and see if they had a car to lend him. When it was concluded that they did not have a car for him, Laake went to Oslo East Station, to find that the rail service was still functioning. Laake managed to board a train and make his way out of Oslo to rejoin the general staff.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 138, 159, 193 The General finally succeeded in finding the general staff, and set up a headquarters in the town of RenaBj√∏rnsen 1977: 280 The confusion that reigned after the German invasion led to delays in Norwegian countermeasures. At 1500hrs on 10 April, Laake and the general staff met with minister of justice Terje Wold. During the meeting, Laake expressed his pessimistic views on the resistance against the invasion, and his disappointment at the government's decision to end negotiations with the Germans. In Laake's view, negotiations were Norway's alternative to an unconditional surrender. The Commanding General also expressed his disappointment at the lack of communication from the government. Minister Wold reacted fiercely to Laake's statements, criticising the general for not having issued orders to his troops and for not carrying out a general mobilization. Laake rebutted by stating that all he had and had not done was in accordance with the government's wishes.Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 280-281 The General was of the opinion that the negotiations could not be called off until it was clear whether or not allied help was actually coming.Fj√∏rtoft 1990: 24 Following the meeting, the government decided, based on Wold's report, to replace Laake. He was called to Nybergsund, where he offered to resign. His resignation was approved and General Otto Ruge, seven years younger than Laake, was appointed as Commanding General.Voks√∏ 1994: 26Bj√∏rnsen 1977: 289 Ruge was optimistic that at least Trondheim could be recaptured from the Germans once Allied help arrived. Before the meeting in Nybergsund, Laake did not suspect that he was to be replaced, and believed he was going to give the government a briefing on the military situation. The government explained Laake's resignation to the public by referring to the mandatory retirement age of generals at 65 years of age. However, as Commanding General, Laake was exempted from this regulation, only being required to retire at age 68.Fj√∏rtoft 1990: 25-26 After his resignation, Laake held a short meeting with his successor Ruge at Rena and left the area. Rasmus Hatledal, chief of the general staff, immediately requested sick leave when he heard of the dismissal of Laake, but was persuaded to stay a few days longer to help Ruge in his new position.Fj√∏rtoft 1990: 30-31 Post-war life Laake resided at the farm Stalsberg in Skedsmo from 1908 to his death. Laake testified against Vidkun Quisling at the latter's post-war trial, telling the court about Quisling's attempts to disrupt the Norwegian mobilization after the German invasion on 9 April 1940.Dahl 1992: 604 References Bibliography    * 1875 births 1950 deaths People from Ullensaker Norwegian Military Academy alumni Norwegian Military College alumni Norwegian expatriates in Germany People from Skedsmo Norwegian Army World War II generals Liberal Party (Norway) politicians Recipients of the Order of the Sword Knights of the Order of the Dannebrog ","title":"Kristian Laake"},{"id":"28946745","text":"Portrait Sadettin Dilbilgen was a philatelist who was born in Ottoman Macedonia.

New Orleans soul has ingredients of pop music and soul and is influenced by boogie-woogie style. The songs always are accompanied by a piano and a saxophone. Guitars are rare in this genre. It was popularized in the postwar era in the Crescent City. This genus stands out in its use of simple pop structures and Rock rhythms that have become very influenced by the \\"second line\\" and \\"parade\\" hits common to the city. The Caribbean music and Latin music from the 60's, that earned a great importance in the city, also inspired to this genre of Soul to develop more exotic rhythms. There are also normal midtempo rhythms. The musicians give more importance to the music and sound that to the letter, which sometimes makes no sense. The choir is always feminine, with the participation of one or two women in it.  Origins  The first songs of this style of Soul emerged from the hand of songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint in 1960. Soon, however, this musical style began to assume great importance among other local and regional authorities. In the nineties, New Orleans Soul attracted the attention of many singers from other genres of soul music, in addition, influences to acquiring the Soul of the South. The success of this genre was originally developed in New Orleans, with little influence outside the city. Despite this, some musicians from Memphis have named the genre as a major element in the development of Soul of this city. That genre also influenced the Northern Soul and British soul. Around 1965, when the Soul of New Orleans had only five years of operation, Toussaint, the mentioned operator of this kind of Soul, produced a slower version of gender, which caused much of the birth of Funk. The genus was about 24 national success.

It is based on the webcomic of the same name about a female half human, half cat bounty hunter named Kit Ballard. The game was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in September 2010, with Episode 2 released as DLC in March 2015 on Steam. It features a type of anime-style, cell shaded graphics. Plot and gameplay Blade Kitten is a video game adaptation of the anime webcomic series by Steve Stamatiadis, the game's director. Blade Kitten is a 2.5D platforming action adventure game set three years before the comic book series on an artificial alien planetoid known as Hollow Wish. The game begins with Kit tracking down a local troublemaker called Terra-Li but on her way to doing so, Kit uncovers a dark and evil secret about Hollow Wish and its inhabitants. Soon after arriving at the planetoid, Kit runs into fellow bounty hunter Justice Kreel who destroys her ship and steals her breaker key which contains all the information she needs to track down and capture Terra-Li. While the only playable character is Kit, the game does boast a large array of alternate costumes that change either Kits clothing or to a completely different person. The game also includes Kit's alien sidekick Skiffy and her floating sword called a Darque Blade. She is able to swing her sword at close range or send it flying over a larger distance to attack enemies and hit inaccessible switches. While progressing through the game, the sword can be upgraded and changed to four different types of blade that can deal either higher amounts of damage, faster attack speed or auto lock-on. She can also ride dinosaur style animals called Noots over the plains of Hollow Wish. The game features different types of collectible items that are picked up while progressing through the game or a hidden inside treasure chests which themselves are hidden somewhere in each level. These items act as both a score booster and the games currency, which can be used to buy upgrades like more health and stamina for Kit Ballard, costume changes and blade upgrades. The Krome Studios mascot, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger also makes an appearance as one of the unlockable costumes. The game consists of nineteen levels and three boss battles. Characters *Kit Ballard is a universally famous bounty hunter and the game's main protagonist. She has arrived on Hollow Wish to claim the bounty reward for taking down the gang cult leader, Terra-Li. *Justice Kreel is a fellow bounty hunter and rival to Kit. She destroys Kit's ship and steals her key at the beginning of the game. She hopes to stop the gang leader Terra-Li first so that she can claim the bounty reward for herself. *Terra-Li is the game's main villain and leader of the Norteun Wolves gang that is stationed on Hollow Wish. She has a bounty of one million Hex, dead or alive (preferably alive) on her head. *Skiffy is Kit Ballard's pet Skiff and faithful companion. He changes colour to red when the attack bar is full, alerting the player that they can use Kit's special attacks. *Walrut Hed is sheriff of Hollow Wish. He sometimes helps Kit on what to do next. *Terra-Gin is the son of Terra-Li. In the final level of episode one, he went to save his mother from her damaged Dreadnought after she was knocked out by Kit. *The Sol-Triumvirate are the enforcers of Hollow Wish. They are an obstacle to Kit's objectives and will do anything to stop her. *The Norteun Wolves are the outlaws of Hollow Wish. Led by Terra-Li, they also plan to stop Kit from reaching her goals. *The Magasse Sisterhood are an unknown organization. Development The game was first announced to the public via the Blade Kitten official websites blog in April 2009 and was created by Krome Studios Creative Director, Steve Stamatiadis who is also the creator and writer of the Blade Kitten comics series. Once he had finished working on Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, he returned to working on Blade Kitten, which had been a project he had wanted to do for some time. \\"Blade Kitten is a brain child of mine that originated as a comic series,\\" said Stamatiadis. \\"Bringing Kit's anime-inspired universe to life is a milestone for us, and we're excited to open her world up to gamers.\\" Around four hundred eighty people auditioned for the voice roles of the game's seven of the main characters. The voice actress Kelly Fuller was chosen to be the voice of Kit Ballard. The game was showcased at many events, to help promote it during the run up to its release, such as the PAX Seattle and the Supanova Pop Culture Expo. On June 2, 2010, Atari announced that they had acquired the rights to publish the game. At the same time it was announced that the PlayStation Network game would also be coming to Xbox Live Arcade. On May 22, 2014 Krome Studios announced they had obtained the rights for Blade Kitten back from Atari and were re-publishing the game. On March 16, 2015, Episode 2 was released on Steam. Reception Blade Kitten received \\"mixed\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Most reviewers criticize the game's level design, lack of difficulty and high price but praising the game's graphical style and in game cutscenes. IGN said that the game \\"relies too heavily on its anime-style charm, which doesn't translate to other areas of the title.\\" 1UP.com gave the Xbox 360 version a more favorable review and said that \\"Kit Ballard's first outing may be flawed, but it's never really terrible either.\\" GameSpot claimed that the \\"clumsy action platformer is often far too easy, and the action doesn't generate much excitement.\\" Cheat Code Central stated that \\"what I got was a game with bad mechanics, repetitive level design, and little incentive to keep playing past the first few levels.\\" Eurogamer gave the game a much more favourable review, claiming that \\"If Blade Kitten is a signal of intent for Atari's on going digital reinvention, then the future looks bright for all concerned.\\" The gaming site NowGamer said that Blade Kitten \\"somehow manages to hold onto just enough quality and semi-inspired design to offer it a certain amount of credibility\\", despite the game's shortcomings causing \\"minor motion sickness\\".

It is the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Alba (otherwise Alba Pompeia). It is a Romanesque building located in the Piazza del Risorgimento, better known as Piazza Duomo (\\"cathedral plaza\\"), amidst cobbled streets. History The earliest structure appears to have been built on the site at the end of the 5th century. A subsequent Romanesque structure was built on its ruins. The current structure, built upon the original one, dates to the first half of the 12th century, probably over holy edifices of Roman age, and is of red brick, Between the 12th and 15th centuries the cathedral was reshaped in the form of late Gothic architecture. It was restructured in the 15th century by bishop Andrea Novelli,Filippo Alizeri, Notizie dei professori del disegno, Genova 1876, 382-383. who arrived in Alba in 1484 to find the cathedral in poor condition. The most important renovation dates to 1652 to repair the damage caused by earthquakes in 1626. After the earthquake, the ceiling of the nave fell. It was restored along with the construction of two side aisles, one dedicated to San Theobald of Provins and the other to SS. Sacramento. The last major restoration was between 1867 and 1878 by the engineer Edoardo Arborio Mella who modified the exterior of the cathedral as well as the interior d√©cor. This reconstruction included roofs, aisle vaults, the rebuilding of the apse, the rehabilitation of the facade, opening side windows and the replacement of the pavement. The current appearance dates to the controversial restoration of the 19th century, of which the three portals and the crypt are from the original edifice. Recent adaptations Restoration work in 2007, including the heating infrastructure, was carried out with financial backing from Bank Foundation of Cassa di Risparmio di Cuneo. An ancient baptismal font was found during archaeological excavation in the aisle in front of the Blessed Sacrament chapel. Approximately 100 graves, primarily of children, dating from the 16th and 18th centuries were also found. The finding was not unusual as it was once customary to reuse the space of an ancient baptistery redesigned as a burial place. The recent renovation gave the Diocese the opportunity to consider the next restoration which will be a 'liturgical adaptation' to the cathedral. In 2008, an Evaluation Committee was formed, consisting of the vicar, the parish priest, the Cultural Property Office of the Diocese, the Director of the National Office of Ecclesiastical Cultural Heritage, as well as expert architects and superintendents. It selected a design that takes into account of two of the cathedral's architectural aspects, the ancient chorus and the special decoration of with bands on the columns that stress the development of building upward. The cost of the work will be supported by the Diocese. Architecture and fittings The fa√ßade The building has a nave and two aisles, on the Latin cross plan. The first chapel on the right is that of the Holy Cross. Its altar was designed in Mella-style with neo-Gothic walls on the left side. The painting of St Joseph is from the 18th century. Paintings of Madonna and Child and St Philip date from the same century, and are attributed to Pietro Paolo Operti. The altar of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart is in Gothic style and holds a statue of the same name. The walls display paintings by Agostino Cottolengo include one of the Abbot San Palemon (1827), and the other depicting Pope Eugene (1840). The church organ was built by Fratelli Lingiardi of Pavia in 1876. The current belfry, from the 12th century, includes entirely the original bell tower. The old bell tower, not particularly high, contains at least five overlapping buttresses to form a powerful base. It is visible by ascending through a cavity that leads to the belfry and was built as a public works project. It is symbolic of the union between Alba's clergy and Alba's society. Reconstruction of the ancient tower included the interior staircase. The nave The church is well known for its wood-carved chorus stalls built in 1512 by Bernardino Fossati. The stalls consist of thirty-five seats in two semicircle rows. The center one is the Episcopal stall. An overhead canopy is flanked by 34 children's stalls, seventeen on each side. The canopies and stalls are decoratively framed in an architectural style typical of the area. This includes a traditional iconographic motif of Renaissance marquetry. The seats are separated from each other by arm rests with plant motifs. The outer paneling consists of inlaid wood scenes, each enclosed in a frame with geometric motifs. The images alternate in their subject matter. They depict differing views of development of the city of Alba, actually inventing architectural features. The semicircle of sculptural depictions, thirty-five in all, are of the Renaissance tradition. The builder used different wood types for the inlay in order to create color nuances. The sculptured subjects include bound books, cups filled with fruit and inverted cups, landscapes, musical instruments, objects of worship, symbols of the Passion, and villages perched on hilltops. A small altar, built in 1872, is dedicated to Saint Bavo. It contains an oil painting on canvas, a representation of San Bovo, by the artist Luigi Morgari and was painted for the cathedral. Placed over a sacred table that was built to a design of Edoardo Arborio Mella, the painting is framed by stucco decorations, pale blue in color, with gold decorations. The painting portrays San Bovo kneeling in admiration of the cross which pierces the sky. The saint is wearing a red cloak, and is dressed as a soldier in boots and a helmet. He holds a waving white flag; a shield lies at his feet. A tower is visible in the distance. A baptistery chapel designed by the architect Ugo Della Piana in 1991 contains the painting Baptism of Jesus.

In a temporary alliance, both groups consisting of Hindu Rajas and Muslim Governors attacked Guru Gobind Singh and his followers. The united Mughal-Rajput Imperial alliance laid siege to the fort at Anandpur Sahib. In an attempt to dislodge the Sikhs, Aurangzeb promised that the Guru and his Sikhs would be allowed to leave Anandpur safely. He is said to have validated this promise in writing. However, he deliberately failed to keep his promise and when the remaining few Sikhs were leaving the fort under the cover of darkness, the Mughals were alerted and engaged them in battle once again. Two of the younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh, Zoravar Singh and Fateh Singh, were bricked up alive within a wall by Wazir Khan in Sirhind (Punjab). The other two elder sons - Ajit Singh and Jujhar Singh along with several Sikhs fought against the giant Mughal force, achieving martyrdom. The Emperor died shortly after on 20 February 1707. He was succeeded by BahƒÅdur ShƒÅh, who invited the Gur≈´ to a meeting which took place at ƒÄgrƒÅ on 23 July 1707. NawƒÅb Wazƒ´r KhƒÅn of Sirhind objected to the Emperor's conciliatory treatment of the Guru and sent two of his soldiers, Jamshed Khan and WƒÅsil Beg, to kill the Guru. Jamshed Khan attacked and wounded the Guru, while he was sleeping, and was beheaded by one sword cut from the waking Guru. The Guru later died from the wounds inflicted on him. The Three Chieftains of the Sikh Misls The Misl's primarily employed cavalry in warfare At the time of the late 18th century, frequent invasions by Ahmad Shah Abdali of Durrani Empire led to a lack of governance in the Punjab region. During thirty years following the final departure of Ahmed Shah Abdali, Sikhs were left to themselves and increased in wealth and numbers.Sykes, Percy (2008)A History of Persia READ books. They gradually divided themselves into independent misls, under the command of hereditary chieftains, having a common place of meeting at Amritsar. Lahore, meanwhile, was portioned out amongst a triumvirate of Sikh chieftains of the Bhangi Misl, named, respectively, Gujjar Singh, Lehna Singh Majithia and Suba Singh, who are spoken of to this day as the Three Hakims. The three chieftains split the city's revenue. For almost thirty long years Gujjar Singh along with Lehna Singh and Sobha Singh, ruled supreme and kept paying to the Durrani Empire. The Lahore Fort and the Walled City and its gates went to Lehna Singh. He was, for formal purposes, the governor of Lahore, and was so recognized. To Suba Singh went the area to the south of the Walled City, and he resided in the garden of Zubaida Begum in Nawankot, where he built a small fort for himself. The area between Amritsar and Lahore, or more correctly between the Shalamar Gardens and Lahore, went to Gujjar Singh. Gujjar Singh erected that part of the city, then a jungle and invited people to settle there. He also dug wells to supply water. A mosque was also built for the Muslims in the area. He also built himself a small fort called Qila Gujar Singh. Today, a few walls of that old fort can be seen in a street between today‚Äôs Nicholson Road and Empress Road, and the area is still called Qila Gujjar Singh. The Bhangi misl engaged in numerous power struggles with the Sukerchakia Misl until they were severely weakened at the Battle of Basin when Ranjit Singh besieged the Lahore Fort in 1799. The three chieftains fled from the city and on 7 July 1799, Ranjit Singh became the master of Lahore. Singh, Khushwant A History of the Sikhs, Volume 1: 1469-1839.

Maharaja Ranjit Singh by Leopold Massard. Ranjit Singh was crowned on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with Baisakhi) as the leader of a Sikh Empire.Maharaja Ranjit Singh was a Jat sikh ruler Sahib Singh Bedi, a descendant of Guru Nanak Dev, conducted the coronation. \\"Ranjit Singh, Maharaja\\", Sikh Cyber Museum The 1740s were years of chaos, and the city had nine different governors between 1745 and 1756. Invasions and chaos in local government allowed bands of warring Sikhs to gain control in some areas. In 1799, all Sikh Misls (warring bands) joined into one to form a sovereign Sikh State ruled by Maharaja Ranjit Singh from the royal capital, Lahore. During the 1740s, frequent invasions by Afghans led by Ahmad Shah Abdali and chaos in local government had made life very uncomfortable for the citizens of Lahore. Bhangi Misl was the first Sikh band to plunder the Mughal Lahore. Later Ranjit Singh was able to make gains in this chaos. He defeated Zaman Shah, the son of Abdali, in a battle between Lahore and Amritsar. Out of the chaos of Afghani and Sikh conflicts emerged a victorious Sikh by the name of Ranjit Singh who was able to unify the Sikh factions and capture Lahore where he was crowned Emperor. Ranjit Singh made Lahore his capital (shifting from the former capital, Gujranwala) in 1799 and was able to expand the kingdom to the Khyber Pass and also included Jammu and Kashmir, while keeping the British from expanding across the River Sutlej for more than 40 years. He rose to power in a very short period, from a leader of a single Sikh misl to finally becoming the Maharaja (Emperor) of Punjab. For a brief half century, from 1799 to 1846, Lahore recovered under the patronage of Ranjit Singh and his successors. Ranjit Singh consolidated the Sikh misldaars (commanders) who had ruled more or less independently during the eighteenth century under a unified command and in 1799 he established Lahore as the administrative capital of a new Sikh kingdom. Nearby Amritsar became the spiritual and commercial center of the kingdom in 1802, after Ranjit Singh's troops occupied the city and the maharaja announced his intention to extend patronage and protection to the city's leading groups.The Samadhi of Emperor Ranjit Singh in Lahore, Pakistan. While much of Lahore's Mughal era fabric lay in ruins by the end of eighteenth century, rebuilding efforts under the Sikhs were shaped by and indebted to Mughal practice. Ranjit Singh moved into the Mughal palace in Lahore's citadel. By 1812 he had mostly refurbished the city's defenses by adding a second circuit of outer walls that followed the outline of Akbar's original walls and were separated from them by a moat. The maharaja also partially restored Shah Jahan's decaying gardens at Shalimar, and British maps of the area surrounding Lahore dating from the mid-nineteenth century show that walled private gardens - many of them bearing the names of prominent Sikh nobles - continued in the Mughal pattern under Sikh rule. The Sikh court continued to endow religious architecture in the city, including a number of Sikh gurdwaras, Hindu temples, and mosques. In short, the decaying structures and architecture of Lahore was restored by the emperor. Ranjit Singh's death on 27 June 1839 ultimately ended his reign, while his son Kharak singh became his successor. He was cremated in Lahore and his samadhi still stands there. Arrival of the British Colonial Rule Dalip Singh, entering his palace in Lahore, escorted by British troops after the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845-46) The British occupation of Lahore took place in a protracted but concerted manner. Capitalizing on the disarray surrounding the succession struggles after Ranjit Singh's death and only partially diminished by a war fought against the Sikhs on their eastern frontier, the British rode into Lahore in February 1846 and garrisoned their troops in the citadel. Two unstable years later, they were drawn into a second war with the Sikhs at the southern city of Multan when that city's governor, Diwan Mulraj Singh, encouraged his troops to rebel. After a series of closely fought battles, the Sikh army was finally defeated in the Battle of Gujrat, sixty miles north of Lahore. In March 1848, following the British victory, Dalip Singh, Ranjit Singh's teenage son and heir to the throne, was formally deposed in Lahore. The remaining Sikh regiments in the city were abruptly decommissioned and camped outside the city demanding severance pay. Within a year, the Punjab was formally annexed to the British Empire and military sappers had begun leveling Lahore's city wall.

The process combines two process units, the Cyclone Converter Furnace (CCF) for ore melting and pre-reduction and a Smelting Reduction Vessel (SRV) where the final reduction stage to liquid iron takes place. The process does not require the manufacturing of iron ore agglomerates such as pellets and sinter, nor the production of coke, which are necessary for the blast furnace process. Without these steps, the HIsarna process is more energy-efficient and has a lower carbon footprint than traditional ironmaking processes. In 2018 Tata Steel announced it has demonstrated that more than 50% CO2 emission reduction is possible with HIsarna technology, without the need for carbon capture technology. The HIsarna process was developed in stages and with pauses at Koninklijke Hoogovens / Corus IJmuiden / Tata Steel IJmuiden, starting in 1986. The final stages were made possible through the Ultra-Low Carbon Dioxide Steelmaking (ULCOS) consortium and cooperation between former Corus (now Tata Steel) and the Rio Tinto Group. The latter contributed their HIsmelt technology to the final design of the installation, prompting the name HIsarna for the process (\\"HI\\" from HIsmelt and \\"sarna\\" from Isarna, a Celtic word for iron). HIsarna is considered one of the most promising developments in reducing CO2 emissions from the steel industry. History The very first attempts at applying cyclone oven technology in the reduction of iron ore took place at Koninklijke Hoogovens in the 1960s. Cyclone technology had already been used successfully in different industrial, chemical processes and designers at Hoogovens thought it might be a strategy for improvement for their process. However, at the time they could not get it to work properly and the experiment was quickly abandoned. The first serious revival came in 1986, when Hoogovens sought a method of producing steel without having to produce iron ore agglomerates such as pellets and sinter. At that time the desire was mostly a cost-cutting measure in order to make the process cheaper in trying economic times. The trying times did not last however and the project was put on the back burner until the early 1990s. By the early 1990s the availability of cokes was becoming limited due to many of the major coking facilities in the West that produced cokes from coal reaching the end of their economic life. Heavy environmental restrictions made it unattractive to build new facilities, so steel producers sought ways to reduce the need for cokes; Hoogovens started putting more effort into the cyclone technology as a solution to this problem and a test facility for the cyclone part proved capable of producing twenty tons of pig iron per hour. The rest of the process didn't work very well though, so when steel producers massively moved to replace part of the coke by powdered coal injection and China started mass- producing cokes, the project lost momentum again. The steep drop in prices of commodities around 1999 caused the project to be halted. In 2004 however, the European Union brought pressure on the steel industry to reduce its carbon footprint; the ULCOS consortium was founded as a result and in the period 2005‚Äì2007 the cyclone technology was selected as one of four high-potential technologies. A theoretical answer was found to the earlier problems of the post-cyclone part of the cyclone furnace in the form of a Smelting Reduction Vessel and the Rio Tinto Group had industrial-scale experience with the required process, called HIsmelt. An agreement between them and ULCOS added the HIsmelt technology to the cyclone furnace and the result was the HIsarna process. In 2017 Tata Steel obtained the IP rights from Rio Tinto, now fully owning all HIsarna IP. Pilot plant In 2010 the HIsarna pilot plant was constructed at Tata Steel IJmuiden. The pilot plant has a capacity of producing 65,000 tons of pig iron per year. A first campaign of experiments was completed in spring 2011, which was followed by three more successful experimental campaigns. The second and third campaign were co-financed by the Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS). The fourth campaign finished in June 2014. The fifth campaign started in the autumn of 2017. This project is part funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme from the EU, as part of the second Sustainable Industry Low Carbon (SILC-II) funding round. Process The HIsarna process is a smelting reduction process with two directly coupled process stages in which the production of liquid pig iron takes place. It is a combination of a Cyclone Converter Furnace (CCF) which is placed above the Smelting Reduction Vessel (SRV), forming a continuous, once through process. The HIsarna plant is shaped like a wine bottle: a \\"bottle\\" at the bottom and a thin \\"neck\\" at the top. The geometry of this furnace causes a cyclone to form in the neck when the crushed iron ore is injected into this cyclone together with oxygen (so oxygen is injected at the top rather than at the bottom). The heat of the cyclone causes the initial (partial) reduction reaction to take place that reduces iron ore to iron. The molten iron droplets then drip down the furnace wall to the place where the \\"neck\\" widens into the \\"bottle\\". Here the droplets fall from the wall into the molten slag, which sits on top of the liquid iron bath in the bottom of the furnace. Between the cyclone and the slag layer, oxygen is injected through water cooled lances to generate heat by partly combusting the gasses being released from the final reduction reaction step that takes place in the slag. Powder coal is injected into the slag layer, again through water cooled lances. The reduction reaction now continues \\"as normal\\" in the bottom of the furnace, with the partially reduced iron ore further reducing to regular pig iron and the whole separating into two molten layers (a top layer of slag and a bottom layer of molten pig iron). Both layers can be tapped individually and the pig iron can be used immediately in the remainder of the basic oxygen steelmaking process. Advantages In a technical sense, the advantage of the HIsarna process is that it removes the step of creating iron ore agglomerates and coke to create a porous burden for the blast furnace. In the traditional process one cannot use powdered coal alone since the strength of the coke is required to support the burden. By comparison, in HIsarna, the powder form of the coal and ore are an advantage because the increased surface area improves the speed and quality of the reduction reaction in the cyclone. The main advantages of the process are derived from those mentioned above, however: the fact that the separate steps of creating ore agglomerates and cokes disappear from the process makes the process more energy efficient and reduces its carbon footprint. This makes the process attractive to steelmakers, who are being pressured to make their processes more environmentally friendly -- particularly in Europe, where government regulations are increasingly attaching a financial penalty to high carbon dioxide emissions. The HIsarna process uses 20% less energy and emits at least 20% less CO2 per ton steel compared to conventional pig iron production. Further environmental advantages include a significant reduction of other emissions such as NOx, SOx and fine dust. CO2 emission reductions of more than 50% can be achieved by replacing part of the coal for sustainable biomass and using steel scrap in the process. Besides the direct environmental benefits HIsarna offers economic benefits as well. The process is able to handle low cost ores and coals and has lower investment costs. The hot metal produced in HIsarna also has advantages for the steelmaking process, allowing for lower slag and metal phosphorus levels in the BOF converter or larger hot metal charges in an Electric arc furnace. Further development Tata Steel is also planning to develop the process in such a way that zinc can be recovered, supported by the EIT RawMaterials, and CO2 can be captured for utilisation or storage. In November 2018 it was announced that a large-scale HIsarna pilot facility would be built at the Tata Steel site in Jamshedpur, India, but that the site in IJmuiden would still be a potential location for further industrial implementation of the technology.

The property was acquired in 1864 to be the corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility for Joubert and White Company - manufacturers of high-grade buckboards. The building is located at the corner of Warren and Jay streets. The Joubert and White Building is a three-story, flat-roofed, brick factory structure above a cut limestone foundation. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Construction In 1864, after borrowing $50, Edward Joubert and J. Huyler White formed a partnership and began to develop a manufacturing building at what was then 45-47 Warren Street (now 77-79 Warren Street) The building consisted of a large building for manufacturing, a second building on Jay Street was used for storage of completed vehicles and a lumberyard where their lumber was seasoned until ready to use. Joubert and White Company Joubert and White began the manufacture of high-grade buckboards in Glens Falls in 1865. They were the innovators and inventors of a famous model that was known for its suspension system and was sought by many wealthy people here and abroad. Notable owners of the buckboard included Cornelius Vanderbilt, John Jacob Astor, J. Pierpont Morgan, Louis Tiffany, Spencer Trask, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. A standard buckboard was constructed by running two planks of wood between the front and rear axles and mounting the passenger seat body on the planks. The only shock absorption was in the flexibility of the planks. When riding on the rough roads of their day, passengers felt like they were riding a bucking horse, hence the name. Joubert devised a way to attach two steel leaf springs, bowed upwards to the planks, with the passenger seat attached to the top of the springs. The seats moved vertically on the springs and also rocked forward and back, making for a more cushioned ride. In 1880, Joubert patented his suspension design in 1880. Some 50 carriage and sleigh models by Joubert and White were considered to be of superior quality. A good buggy would sell for $50 to $75, while the Joubert and White buckboard might cost $500 to $800 with some as high as $1000 or more if customized. By 1897 the company had 35 employees, made 75 vehicles annually and reached $50,000 in sales. Joubert handled the manufacturing details for the firm before he died in 1890. White, who handled sales, kept the business and traveled the country as the \\"Buckboard King\\" taking mail orders by catalog. Production continued into the 20th century, only falling off with the coming of the gasoline-powered automobiles. When White died in 1916, the company went out of business with assets of $100,000, which were divided among the heirs of Joubert and White. Empire Automobile Company Starting in 1910, the Joubert and White Building also housed the Empire Automobile Company owned by D.H. Cowles and Frank M. Starbuck. Catering to the affluent of the Saratoga Springs, New York-Adirondack Mountains resort-touring season, Cowles and Starbuck provided an automobile storage and repair facility. Patrons had the opportunity to have their autos serviced overnight, before continuing via auto or carriage to their destinations in the Adirondacks. In 1933, Empire Automotive began to share their space with Comac Sales, Inc. - another automobile dealership. Empire Auto remained in business until 1935, dealing in such brands as Chevrolet, Cadillac, Essex, Hudson, and LaSalle automobiles, as well as GMC trucks. Decline and Rehabilitation After the closing of Empire Automobile Company, Comac Sales, Inc., a Chevrolet dealer, occupied the building until 1956 when it changed ownership and became Whiteman Chevrolet. Whiteman remained in the Joubet and White Building until 1957, when they moved to their current location on Dix Avenue in Glens Falls. The Joubert and White Building remained vacant until it was occupied by Campbell Wholesale Plumbing and Heating Corporation in 1960. The Joubert and White Building housed various businesses after the closing of Campbell in 1970, including Armando Candle Mill Inc., a Parts Plus auto part store, an H&R; Block tax preparation store, and a martial arts studio, before then becoming warehouse space for Glen Street Associates in 2008. In 2011 the building was renovated and leased for commercial and residential use under the name Warren Street Square.

Like other artisan groups, they have seen a decline in their traditional occupation, with many petty businessmen or wage labourers. Like other Gujarati Muslims groups, they have a caste association, the Jamat Gilkhan Afroz, which deals with issues of community welfare. The Bharbhunjas are Sunni Muslims, and have customs similar to other Gujarati Muslims communities. = In Uttar Pradesh = The Bharbhunja in Uttar Pradesh are traditionally grain parchers. They have a mixed origin, with some claiming to be of Shaikh origin, while other claiming Rajput origin. In fact, the community consists of forty clans, each of whom has its own origin myth. Often the divisions is merely territorial, such as the Hamirpuriya, originally from Hamirpur, the Jaunpuriya, originally those from Jaunpur. Each subdivision in referred to as a biradari. They are found mainly in the districts of Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Aligarh, Ghaziabad, Bijnor, Moradabad and Badaun. The Bharbhunja speak both Urdu and Khari boli. A second cluster of Bharbhunjas are found in the districts of Barabanki and Bahraich, who speak the Awadhi dialect.Tribes and Castes of North Western Provinces and Oudh Volume II by William Crook The Bharbhunja are still involved with grain parching, although many are now petty businessmen. They are strictly endogamous, and marriages tend to occur within the biradari. They live in multi caste and multi religious settlements, but occupy their own distinct quarters. Each settlement has a caste council, known as a panchayat, which acts as an instrument of social control. It deals with intra community disputes, as well as punishing those who breach communal norms. Although they live in close proximity to other Muslim groups, such as the Shaikh, Kabaria, Ansari, Muslim Dhobi and Qassab in Awadh, and the Muslim Teli, Muslim Banjara, Baghban and Rohilla in Rohilkhand, there is very little interaction, and virtually no intermarriage.

Gameplay The player controls a snake, crawling into a rectangular area. At the start of the game the snake has three lives and gains a life when it successfully exits a level. The goal is to eat 10 apples in each of the 28 levels. If an apple is not eaten during the given deadline, three extra apples are to be eaten. The snake becomes longer and moves more quickly with each apple eaten. The snake loses a life when crashing into a fence, the wall or itself. After the last apple in each round is eaten the snake must exit the area through a gate which appears. Higher levels have more complicated fences, making the area trickier to navigate. Levels are increasingly difficult and the last ones allow almost no mistakes at all. Level 29 wraps back to level 1, but the counter does not reset. After completing enough levels the display will go from 99 to 00. The game can be played in two modes: two-key (left/right) or four-key (left/right/up/down), with 0, 1 or 2 bouncing plums.

In addition to France, the gold bloc included Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, and Switzerland. History As the shock from the May 1931 default of Austria's largest commercial bank, Creditanstalt, spread throughout Europe, several countries, most notably Great Britain in September 1931, abandoned the gold standard. Other countries, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden (September 1931), Finland (October), and Japan (December), also abandoned the gold standard. But the gold bloc countries recommitted themselves to maintain a stable rate of exchange of their currencies at the 1933 international economic conference in London, by which time 35 countries, including the United States and Italy, had abandoned the gold standard. They thus persisted with deflationary policies‚Äîi.e., \\"while foreswearing exchange controls, they raised tariffs and tightened quotas on imports in an effort to insulate their economies from the downturn and protect their gold reserves\\". The currency crisis continued after the devaluation of the United States dollar in 1934 and the ongoing devaluation of the British pound sterling. The gold bloc countries' export businesses found it difficult to maintain profitability and suffered from massive capital flight to the United States. Belgium and Luxembourg gave up the gold standard in March 1935 and devalued their currencies. In September 1936, the United States, Great Britain, and France signed the Tripartite Agreement, and finally the remaining gold bloc countries abandoned the gold standard.

Biography  Born in 1947 the son of an Italian theatre producer, Ciro Ippolito started his career during childhood being an actor in the film Class of Iron (Classe di ferro, 1957) by Turi Vasile. In 1972 he participated in the film Augustine of Hippo (Agostino d'Ippona) by Roberto Rossellini, with whom he worked as assistant director. In the mid-1960s, he produced two theatre shows of Leopoldo Mastelloni (Le compagnie and Brechtomania), and participated in various films (I misteri di Napoli, La Badessa di Castro, Vieni amore mio, Flavia la monaca musulmana, La fine dell'innocenza) as actor or screenwriter. His first work as a film director came in 1980 with the film Alien 2: On Earth (Alien 2 sulla terra), made under the pseudonym Sam Cromwell. His main successes from that period are Lacrime napolitane (Berlin Film Festival, 1980), followed by Pronto...Lucia (1982) and Zampognaro innamorato (1983), both with Carmelo Zappulla. Arrapaho, a film about the Amerindian tribe Arapaho, was an immediate success. The film was made in a fortnight at a cost of 135 million Italian lira and recovered five billion. Ippolito continued his activity as film producer with La venexiana (1986) directed by Mauro Bolognini and his television activity with works like La romana by Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, Gli indifferenti, miniseries by Bolognini, Disperatamente Giulia by Enrico Maria Salerno, Donna d'onore by Stuart Margolin, The Seventh Scroll (Il settimo papiro) by Kevin Condor and Il terzo segreto di Fatima by Alfredo Peyretti. During the 1990s, he was producer for Lina Wertm√ºller in Io speriamo che me la cavo and Ninfa Plebea, and for Maurizio Nichetti in Palla di neve. Ciro Ippolito's last film was Vaniglia e cioccolato / Vanilla and Chocolate (2004), an adaptation of the homonym novel of Sveva Casati Modigliani, which had a discrete success. In 2010 Ippolito published a book entitled Un Napoletano a Hollywood.Ciro Ippolito, Un Napoletano a Hollywood, N√°poles: Casa Editrice Tullio Pironti S.r.l., 2010, 180 pp.  Filmography  = Director = * Strangers (1974) (under the pseudonym George Spelvin) * Alien 2: On Earth (Alien 2 sulla Terra) (1980) (under the pseudonym Sam Cromwell) * Lacrime napoletane (1981) * Pronto...

It stars Rituparno Ghosh and Indraneil Sengupta, with Ghosh playing a gay filmmaker. It is the first film on homosexuality to be shot after the Delhi High Court struck down portions of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in July 2009 as unconstitutional with respect to gay sex (in a decision overturned by the Supreme Court of India in 2013). The film premiered at the 60th Berlin Film Festival in 2010. Plot The film is about Abhiroop Sen (Rituparno Ghosh), a Delhi-based transgender documentary filmmaker, whose bisexual lover is the cinematographer (Indraneil Sengupta) of the film. They visit Kolkata to make a documentary on the life of the real-life legendary jatra actor Chapal Bhaduri, who in his heyday was known as 'Chapal Rani', noted for his portrayal of female roles on the stage at a time when women did not perform on stage. Initially Abhiroop Sen has to face some difficulties to start the documentary, as he is a transgender. But with Chapal Bhaduri's support Abhiroop starts the shoot. During the course of the shoot, Abhiroop feels himself in the position of Chapal Bhaduri. The film goes on with a comparison between Abhiroop's intimate relation with Indraneil Sengupta, who is married to Rani (Churni Ganguly) and Chapal Bhaduri's (Rituparno Ghosh) relation with Kumar (Indraneil Sengupta), who is married to Gopa (Churni Ganguly). In the course of the film Abhiroop gets attached to Uday and Chapal Bhaduri to Tushar, both played by Jisshu Sengupta. The film takes the viewers through the present life of Abhiroop Sen and past life of Chapal Bhaduri with the same actors. The film focuses on the mental trauma faced by a transgender, the rejection by men, after using them sexually.

These snakes feed on moray eels and various fish that live on the seafloor, up to 110 cm (3.6 feet) in size. They are viviparous, giving birth to live young rather than laying eggs.Aipysurus duboisii Bavay, 1869, SeaLifeBase site: UBC - CanadaHeatwole, p. 22.

The fangs are 1.8 mm long, which are relatively short for a snake, and the venom yield is 0.43 mg. Aipysurus duboisii is a crepuscular species, meaning that they are most active at dawn and dusk.Heatwole, p. 40.

Etymology The specific name, duboisii, is in honor of Belgian naturalist Charles Fr√©d√©ric Dubois.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Aipysurus duboisi, p. 76). Description Adults of A. duboisii grow up to 148 cm (4.86 feet) in total length (including tail) but usually to around 80 cm (2.6 feet). The head is slightly wider than the neck with nostrils on its upper part and nasals contacting each other. Eyes are separated from supralabial scales by a row of large subocular scales. Dorsal scales are usually smooth, but sometimes have a small keel or small knobs. Individuals vary significantly in color and its body patterns. The tail is relatively long; the chin and throat have lighter color than rest of the body. Venom The acute toxicity of snake venom is conventionally tested on laboratory animals and is evaluated in terms of the median lethal dose (LD50), that is, the dose required to kill half the members of a tested population divided by the weight of the tested animal. The LD50 depends on the animal. Rabbits are about twice as sensitive to sea snake venom as mice, and fish and frogs are even more susceptible. The LD50 for subcutaneous injection of A. duboisii venom into mice is 0.044 mg/kg of body weight. This makes A. duboisii the most venomous sea snake tested, and the third most venomous snake overall, behind the inland taipan (Oxyuranus microlepidotus, LD50=0.025 mg/kg) and the eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis, LD50=0.036 mg/kg).Heatwole, p. 115.Gopalakrishnakone P (1994).

She was the elder sister of Elizabeth, Charlotte, Branwell, Emily, and Anne. She was born in Hartshead, Yorkshire, and died at the age of 11.  Early life and education  When Maria was six years old, she was characterised as \\"grave, thoughtful, and quiet, to a degree far beyond her years\\". Plaintext Soon after their mother's death in 1821, Maria and her sisters grew up largely with the company of one another, preferring to stay away from society. Maria often read the many newspapers bought into the household by their father and revealed her findings to her sisters. Maria was said to have been a precocious child. According to her father, when he asked 10-year-old Maria \\"what...the best mode of spending time [was]\\", she answered, \\"By laying it out in preparation for a happy eternity.\\"Patrick Bront√´ to Elizabeth Gaskell, 1855, Bront√´ Society Transactions 8:44:127 He later said that he could speak with Maria on any popular topic of the day as fluently as with an adult, and regretfully recalled her \\"powerfully intellectual mind\\".Patrick Bront√´ to Elizabeth Gaskell, 20 June 1855 A printer from Thornton also remembered Maria correcting the proofs of one of Mr. Bront√´'s long poems. According to Charlotte, she was rather serious and silent than otherwise, and Mrs. Gaskell described her as \\"delicate, unusually clever and thoughtful for her age, gentle, and untidy\\". On 1 July 1824, Maria, 10, and Elizabeth, joined the Cowan Bridge School with Charlotte and Emily following soon after in September. The food provided by the school was generally poorly cooked and unhealthy, and the cook was reported to be \\"careless, dirty, and wasteful\\". Both Maria and Elizabeth had just recovered from measles and whooping cough, and despite hunger, they often did not eat. The school register read:Shakespeare Head I, Lives and Letters, p. 69 > Maria Bront√´, aged 10 ... reads tolerably. Writes pretty well. Ciphers a > little. Works badly. Very little of geography or history. Has made some > progress in reading French, but knows nothing of the language grammatically. Miss Andrews, a teacher there, admitted that Maria had a \\"fine imagination and extra-ordinary talents\\".  Death  In spring 1825, a typhoid epidemic swept through the school, causing the departure of almost a sixth of the students between February and June.Edward Chitham, A Life of Emily Bront√´, Basil Blackwell, 1987, p. 46 By the winter of 1824, Maria's health was already deteriorating due to consumption. On 14 February 1825, Maria was withdrawn from the school. She lived at Haworth for three months, alongside her brother Branwell and her youngest sister, Anne ‚Äì who were the only siblings left at the parsonage ‚Äì before dying at the age of 11. Patrick attributed Maria's death to a divine aspect: \\"She exhibited during her illness many symptoms of a heart under Divine influence. Died of decline\\".  Influence  According to Elizabeth Gaskell, Maria inspired the pious character Helen Burns in Jane Eyre, and a teacher on whom Miss Scatcherd was modelled subjected Charlotte's \\"gentle patient dying sister [Maria]\\" to \\"worrying and cruelty\\".

He is the son of Samuel Atkins Eliot, Jr., the grandson of Samuel Atkins Eliot, and the great-grandson of Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard for fifty years. Eliot was the art editor of Time magazine from 1945 to 1960. His many books include ‚ÄúThe Universal Myths: Heroes, Gods, Tricksters, and Other‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Global Myths: Exploring Primitive, Pagan, Sacred, and Scientific Mythologies‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe Timeless Myths: How Ancient Legends Influence the Modern World‚Äù.Listing on LibraryThing Eliot was married to writer Jane Winslow Eliot, author of \\"Around the World by Mistake\\" from 1952 until her death on July 31, 2011. Together they produced the film \\"The Secret of Michelangelo ‚Äì Every Man‚Äôs Dream\\", which appeared on ABC primetime television in 1967-68. Their children are Jefferson Eliot and the writers May Paddock and Winslow Eliot. Personal life In 1960, Eliot was awarded a Guggenheim Guggenheim Fellowship, and moved with his wife and children to Spain for a year. There he wrote Sight and Insight ‚Äì on how to ‚Äòsee‚Äô art. While he was there, he and Jane Winslow Eliot made the decision to leave his job as art editor of Time magazine and the stressful Manhattan lifestyle and live in Greece instead. In 1963, he took his family on a Yugoslav freighter for a long journey through Middle and Far East, eventually disembarking in Osaka, Japan. (The story of that journey is written in Around the World by Mistake, a narrative written by Eliot's wife and published in 2007). In 1964 the family moved to Rome, Italy, and later to Sussex, England where Eliot lived until 1974. In 1975 he received a fellowship from the Japan Foundation to study Zen Buddhism in Kyoto, Japan. Eliot is descended from aristocratic educators, beginning with the younger son of an English lord who arrived in Plymouth in 1632 and proceeded to be interested in educating the Algonquins. His great-grandfather, Charles W. Eliot, was the president of Harvard for fifty years. He was the first male Eliot not to attend Harvard; instead, when he was eighteen years old, he drove across the country to live with the Navajos in New Mexico. Art was his great love and eventually he chose to attend Black Mountain College so that he could study with Josef Albers. In 1945 he joined Time magazine as the art editor, where he remained until 1960. He knew most artists who lived in New York during his tenure at Time, and also had encounters with artists when he lived abroad, including Matisse, Picasso, and his friend Salvador Dal√≠. In 1968 he spent six weeks in the Sistine Chapel to research a documentary on Michelangelo‚Äôs Sistine Ceiling. The ‚Äòresearch‚Äô was done mostly by having a scaffold built on wheels that he and his wife Jane could lie on top of: this way they could be as close to Michelangelo‚Äôs work as he was himself; and to study and talk about the stories that he depicted on the ceiling. The hour- long documentary, ‚ÄúThe Secret of Michelangelo ‚Äì Every Man‚Äôs Dream,‚Äù was shown in December 1968 on ABC primetime. Books and articles Eliot published eighteen books, including books on art, mythology, history, and novels. He was also the author of hundreds of essays, published in magazines as varied as The Eastern Buddhist and England‚Äôs Systematics, and, most well-known, his weekly column when he was the art editor of Time magazine. His tastes in art were wide-ranging, and he was among the few critics of the time who understood the persistence of figurative painting in the era of abstraction, championing painters such as Henry Koerner, who remained representational. = Myths and Spirituality = *The Universal Myths: Heroes, Gods, Tricksters, and Others (New American Library, 1990) Introduced by Joseph Campbell, Mircea Eliade *The Timeless Myths: How Ancient Legends Influence the Modern World, New York: Truman Talley Books/Meridian, 1997 *The Global Myths: Exploring Primitive, Pagan, Sacred, and Scientific Mythologies (New York: Continuum, 1993) *Myths (New York : McGraw-Hill International, 1976) (published in 5 languages) *Zen Edge (London: Thames and Hudson, 1976) (written when he received a Senior Fellowship from the Japan Foundation and lived with his wife for a year in Kyoto, studying Zen Buddhism) *Creatures of Arcadia (Indianapolis: Bobbs- Merrill Company, 1967) *Earth, Air, Fire and Water ‚Äì A Personal Adventure into the Sources of Our Life and Legend (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1959) = Art, history, and travel = *Three Hundred Years of American Painting (New York: Time Inc., 1957) (selected by John F.

First found in 1943 by Captain W. Stanley Moss, a British officer in the Special Operations Executive, it was a spacious villa, with a great ballroom with parquet floors, which four or five people might share. Moss chose the villa rather than live in the SOE hostel, \\"Hangover Hall\\". He moved in alone at first, then bought his Alsatian puppy, Pixie; Xan Fielding, who had worked in Crete, joined him. Next was Countess Zofia (Sophie) Tarnowska, forced to leave Poland in 1939 by the German invasion, followed by Arnold Breene of SOE HQ. Finally Patrick Leigh Fermor, an SOE officer who had spent the previous nine months in Crete, joined the household.Moss, W. Stanley, Diary, 1944 The villa's new inhabitants called it Tara, the legendary home of the High Kings of Ireland. Sophie Tarnowska and two other women had been asked to share the house with the SOE agents, but only she went through with it, after the men pleaded with her not to let them down. She moved in with her few possessions (a bathing costume, an evening gown, a uniform and two pet mongooses), and had her reputation in the all-male household protected by an entirely fictitious chaperone, \\"Madame Khayatt\\", who suffered from \\"distressingly poor health\\" and was always indisposed when visitors asked after her.

Tara became the most exciting place in the city, the centre of high-spirited entertaining of diplomats, officers, writers, lecturers, war correspondents and Coptic and Levantine party-goers. The residents adopted nicknames: \\"Princess Dneiper-Petrovsk\\" (Sophie Tarnowska) and the young buccaneers, \\"Sir Eustace Rapier\\" (Billy McLean), \\"the Marquis of Whipstock\\" (David Smiley), \\"the Hon. Rupert Sabretache\\" (Rowland Winn), \\"Lord Hughe Devildrive\\" (Xan Fielding), \\"Lord Pintpot\\" (Arnold Breene), \\"Lord Rakehell\\" (Patrick Leigh Fermor) and \\"Mr Jack Jargon\\"Lord Byron, Don Juan, Canto The Thirteenth, LXXXVIII, \\"There was Jack Jargon, the gigantic guardsman\\" (W.

Tarnowska drew on memories of liqueur-making on her father's estates to produce the party drinks, adding plums, apricots and peaches to raw alcohol (as a substitute for vodka) purchased from the local garage, in the bath. The results were disappointing as, rather than being left to mature for three weeks, the mixture was drunk after three days. At the end of their first ball, Leigh Fermor fell asleep on a sofa which ignited, before it was thrown burning into the garden below.

Biography Cyriack Skinner was the third son of William Skinner, a Lincolnshire squire who died in 1627. His mother was Bridget Coke, daughter of the famous jurist Sir Edward Coke. Skinner was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 31 July 1647, and became a lawyer by profession. He came to live near Milton in 1654, and probably began to help the poet at that time. After the Rump Parliament had been reconstituted in 1659 following the death of Oliver Cromwell, Skinner joined the Rota Club. This group met each night at the Turk's Head Coffee House to debate proposals by Milton's opponent, the republican James Harrington, and was often chaired by Skinner. Skinner would have kept Milton informed of the progress of these discussions. He remained close to Milton during the difficult period that followed the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, and was present at Milton's death bed in 1674. Cyriack Skinner has been identified as author of the anonymously published book The Life of Mr. John Milton, an important source of first-hand information on the poet. Milton's later assistant Daniel Skinner may have been his relative, notable for first attempting to publish some of Milton's state papers, then attempting to suppress them. Sonnets Two of Milton's Sonnets are addressed to Skinner: =Sonnet XVIII= Cyriack, whose Grandsire on the Royal Bench Of British Themis, with no mean applause Pronounc't and in his volumes taught our Lawes, Which others at their Barr so often wrench: To day deep thoughts resolve with me to drench In mirth, that after no repenting ; Let Euclid rest and Archimedes pause, And what the Swede intend, and what the French. To measure life, learn thou betimes, and know Toward solid good what leads the nearest way; For other things mild Heav'n a time ordains, And disapproves that care, though wise in show, That with superfluous burden loads the day, And when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains. =Sonnet XXII= Cyriack, this three years' day these eyes, though clear To outward view of blemish or of spot, Bereft of light, their seeing have forgot; Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear Of sun or moon or star throughout the year, Or man or woman. Yet I argue not Against Heav'n's hand or will, not bate a jot Of heart or hope, but still bear up and steer Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask? The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied In liberty's defence, my noble task, Of which all Europe talks from side to side.

In 1861, he enrolled in the academy run by Takechi Hanpeita where he studied swordsmanship. He was one of the founding members of the Tosa Kinno-t≈ç, a paramilitary shishi organization created by Takeichi to support the sonn≈ç j≈çi movement. After the coup d‚Äôetat of September 30, 1863, led to the suppression of the sonn≈ç J≈çi faction, he fled to Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain together with pro-Sonn≈ç J≈çi nobles, including Sanj≈ç Sanetomi. In 1864, he participated in a failed plot to assassinate Shimazu Hisamitsu, and fought alongside Ch≈çsh≈´ forces during the Kinmon Incident and the Bombardment of Shimonoseki. Later that year, as a member of the Kaientai formed by Sakamoto Ry≈çma, he worked to bring about the Satsuma-Ch≈çsh≈´ Alliance and to obtain the backing and support of Sanj≈ç Sanetomi for the project. In March, 1867, he travelled with Sakamoto Ry≈çma to their native Tosa Domain to negotiate a similar alliance between Tosa and Satsuma. In June, he began negotiations to further expand the new alliance to include Ch≈çsh≈´ as well as Hiroshima Domain, but the issue was rendered moot when sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu formally returned governing power to the Emperor. Realizing that civil war was now increasingly probable, Nakaoka returned to Tosa and established the Rikuentai militia. Rikuentai was modeled after the Kiheitai in Ch≈çsh≈´ in July. On December 10, 1867, Nakaoka traveled to Kyoto for discussions with Sakamoto Ry≈çma, but was mortally wounded together with Sakamoto when unknown assailants attacked their lodgings (i.e. the \\"≈åmiya Incident\\"). Sakamoto died soon afterwards, but the critically injured Nakaoka lingered for two days, although never regaining enough consciousness to identify the attackers. His grave is located at the Ryosen Gokoku Jinja in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. He was posthumously awarded with the court rank of 4th grade in 1891 by Emperor Meiji.

This expedition, composed of seven ships of the line and three frigates under the orders of Rear-Admiral Richery sailed from Cadiz in August 1796 accompanied by a much stronger Spanish squadron, commanded by General Solano, which had the aim of escorting it to the coast of Newfoundland. On 28 August 1796 this combined Franco-Spanish squadron of 20 vessels, carrying 1,500 regular troops, appeared off the coast of Newfoundland. Considerable alarm was occasioned in England by the first accounts of these events in Newfoundland, the news being to the effect that the French had actually landed 1,500 men at Bay Bulls and 2,000 at Portugal Cove in Conception Bay, from which they were marching against St. John's.Pedley p.174 The harbour of St. John's was defended by a number of fortifications and gun emplacements such as Fort Amherst, Chain Rock Battery, Fort Frederick, and the large star-fort known as Fort Townshend.O'Neill p.60 At St. John's the local garrison of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Newfoundland Volunteers, aided by most able-bodied men, established a camp atop Signal Hill at the beginning of September. A boom was constructed across the harbour and three fire ships prepared. French Admiral Joseph de Richery, decided not to land after he saw this force, and after hovering in the area for several days, he chose instead to land at Bay Bulls, 18 miles south of St. John's, on 4 September. On 4 September the expedition entered the town of Bay Bulls, and there being no sufficient force to protect Newfoundland, it was ravaged with fire and destruction, and a great deal of mischief was done to the fisheries. After taking dozens of British prisoners, the combined fleet sailed toward Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which were held by the British at that time, and remained near the islands for two weeks, taking on water and preparing for the voyage back to France and Spain. The combined expedition destroyed over 100 fishing vessels from the Newfoundland fleet and burned fishing stations along the Newfoundland coast, including the base of the English garrison at Placentia Bay.James p.409 Background On 19 August a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, between France and Spain was signed at San Ildefonso, by which the latter power was to have a fleet in readiness to assist the French.Cust. p.65 The treaty was ratified in Paris on 12 September, and on 5 October a declaration of war by Spain against Great Britain was issued from Madrid. The fleet, under the command of Don Juan de Langara, put to sea from Cadiz. Ten sail of the line under the flag of Rear- Admiral Solano were dispatched to join with a French force consisting of seven sail of the line and three frigates, under Rear-Admiral Richery, in an expedition against the British settlement of Newfoundland. In August 1796, both Canada and Nova Scotia were stirred by the news that Admiral Richery had escaped the vigilance of Admiral Robert Mann out of Cadiz, and was proceeding to Newfoundland with seven sail of the line and several frigates.Anspach p.227 Against this force Vice-Admiral Wallace at St. John's could only oppose the old Romney of 50 guns, two 32's and two 16's. Captain Taylor, in Andromeda, of thirty-two guns, had parted for the banks with orders to cruise there for the protection of the sea trade. On 3 September he spoke with a schooner, the master of which informed him that he had seen on the coast an enemy's fleet, consisting of several ships of the line and frigates. Subsequent reports increased alarm on the mainland by telling of French landings in Conception Bay. Attempt on St. John's Richery made for St. John's, estimating that with his superior firepower, he could pound Fort Amherst into submission. With the battery silenced, he could then force his way into the harbour to destroy the town. Outnumbered at sea, the British retired behind the forts and batteries of St. John's and prepared to put up stiff resistance.McKee p.42 It was the morning of 2 September 1796 when the French fleet was sighted off the coast. Wallace did not have a large garrison in St. John's at the time, so he tried to give the impression that he had. This was intended to make the French believe that St. John's would be too costly to try to take.Molloy p.40 He had his men erect tents on both sides of the entrance to the Narrows and then marched them to and fro at Fort Amherst and below Signal Hill. Richery was handicapped by having no intelligence of the defenses of St. John's and no pilots for Newfoundland waters.O'Neill p.63 He had to depend for information on John Morridge, master of a fishing ship belonging to Governor Wallace, who was one of the prisoners taken at Bay Bulls. Richery's huge fleet hove to off Cape Spear for a day observing the daunting sight. The next morning, Richery formed a battle line and drove for the harbour entrance. As they came within the range of the twenty-four pounders at Fort Amherst, his resolve weakened.Molloy p.41 Tacking the great ships, he headed back out to sea. The ruse had worked and the town saved. Admiral Richery's threat to St. John's finally came to nothing in face of the vigour of the new Governor, Admiral Sir Richard Wallace, who raised volunteers, strengthened the forts, and prepared new batteries.Smith p.74 In France, the public were informed that Richery had forced the surrender of St. John's and captured large quantities of shipping and sent more than a thousand sailors as prisoners to Santo Domingo. Not until October did authentic information reach England, when it was learned that the French admiral had given up the larger plan of an assault on St. John's and had left the coast on 29 September.Graham p.227 Bay Bulls On 4 September the French squadron entered Bay Bulls. The town surrendered on their approach. Admiral Richery plundered and destroyed the entire settlement and shipping, including the fishing-stages, driving the inhabitants into the woods.Page p.21Tocque p.166 57 buildings and 47 fishing ships were captured along with more than 400 prisoners. Chateau Bay On 5 September, Richery detached Adm. Zacharie Jacques Th√©odore Comte Allemand, to raid the Bay of Castles (Labrador) with Duquesne, Censeur, and Friponne while Richery himself proceeded to Saint Pierre and Miquelon with Victoire, Barras, Jupiter, Berwick, and R√©volution 74s, and frigates √âmbuscade and F√©licit√© to visit a like treatment upon its shore establishments. Delayed by head winds and fogs, M. Allemand did not enter the bay of Castles until 22 September, by which time most of the fishing vessels had departed for Europe. The French commodore sent an officer with a flag of truce demanding the surrender of the town. This was refused, but the approach of the squadron compelled the British commanding officer to destroy the fishing-stages. Raid on Saint Pierre and Miquelon Richery destroyed all the buildings, vessels, and fishing-stages he found at Saint Pierre and Miquelon, claiming the islands for FranceRannie p.40 but leaving them unpopulated. Approximately 225 houses, 17 large scaffolds, 8 large buildings, 80 fishing boats and 80,000 quintals of cod were burnt to the ground. Admiral Richery hoisted the French flag on the island of St. Pierre, which had surrendered to a force from Halifax years before, but had been left without a garrison, though a number of British fishermen had taken possession and built a town. Richery's squadron then divided, and a portion sailed for the coast of Labrador to intercept the homeward-bound fishing fleet from Quebec while Admiral Richery remained near Cape Breton with four sail of the line and a frigate.Fullom p.62 On 27 September, Admiral Murray arrived at Halifax from Bermuda. Although the information presented to him was still confused, the apparent lack of transports and troops indicated that the expedition was a raid rather than a serious attempt to take Newfoundland. Two days later, Allemand stood away from the coast, and, as Richery had already done, steered homeward. On 5 November, Richery, with his division, entered the port of Rochefort, and on the 15th Allemand with his reached Lorient. Aftermath The combined fleets of France and Spain had destroyed upwards of 100 merchant vessels, and taken a great number of prisoners. Some were sent in a cartel to Halifax, and the remainder, about 300 in number, were carried into France and Spain. The British bank fisheries in Newfoundland recovered following the signing of the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, and in that year, 71 Newfoundland and 58 British \\"banker\\" vessels prosecuted the fisheries on the Grand Banks. They declined again with the outbreak of war in 1803 and recovered somewhat after the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805, but declined again during the Anglo-American war of 1812‚Äì14.Ryan p.35 Popular literature The Spanish novelist Arturo P√©rez-Reverte cites this expedition in one of his works, Cabo Trafalgar: un relato naval.P√©rez Reverte, Arturo (2011).
