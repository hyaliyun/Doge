The panic of 1893 hit the coal mining industry particularly hard. Wage cuts in the industry began immediately, and wages were slashed again in early 1894. By the late spring of 1894, the United Mine Workers, which had a mere $2,600 in its treasury and a paid membership of 13,000, called a general strike in the bituminous coal mining industry. The demand was for wages to return to the level they were at on May 1, 1893. Initially, the strike was a major success. More than 180,000 miners in Colorado, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia struck. In Illinois, 25,207 miners went on strike, while only 610 continued to work through the strike, with the average Illinois miner out of work for 72 days because of the strike.The Coal Miners Strike – 1894, Coal in Illinois, 13th Annual Report of the State Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1894, Springfield, 1895; Appendix pages 5–26, see particularly Table III. But the mine owners were unwilling and/or unable to restore wages. Some owners adjusted wages slightly upward, but most refused to budge. In some areas of the country, violence erupted between strikers and mine operators or between striking and non-striking miners. On May 23 near Uniontown, Pennsylvania, 15 guards armed with carbines and machine guns held off an attack by 1500 strikers, killing 5 and wounding 8.W. T.

By late June, almost all the miners had returned to work. The strike shattered the United Mine Workers. A year after the strike, the union's secretary-treasurer wrote to the American Federation of Labor (AFL), declaring, 'The National is busted...' The union almost ceased to exist. It suspended publication of its newsletter and ceased paying per capita dues to the AFL. It would be a quarter of a century before John L. Lewis would turn the Mine Workers into a successful union again. References Further reading * Foner, Philip S.

One example might be breakthrough by the high field strengths produced by a nearby radio transmitter. EMC problems are not always due to defects in the transmitter, and so do not necessarily require improvements in the radio transmitter design, such as reducing its radiated harmonics. It may be that the immunity of the affected equipment is poor due to inadequate shielding, or filtering of sensitive inputs. EMC problems can have a range of effects on equipment, and there are ways to mitigate or eliminate them in practice. Effective EMC mitigation techniques may differ by the type of equipment that malfunctions, and by the nature of the strong radio frequency field.  Singing sparks and allied effects  The singing spark can be thought of as the ultimate form of the rusty bolt effect. This is a situation where the output of a transmitter is clean, the receiver is able to reject the transmitter's frequency but some object energised by the RF field is then able to generate harmonics or act as a non-linear mixer which generates intermodulation products. To solve this the best thing to do is to locate the rusty bolt and either remove it or render it harmless. Possible examples of rusty bolts include the pole holding an aerial, cast iron drainpipes, loose manhole covers and guy wires on radio masts.  TV and radio equipment   Common problems   Motorboating  Motorboating can be seen in radio equipment, it can be regarded as a self-inflicted EMC problem. While this idea of self-imposed EMC effects could include all manner of unwanted feed back and crosstalk effects within an item of equipment, for reasons of brevity no discussion of internal feed back (which does not involve a signal leaving an item of equipment) will be included here. The best method of curing this defect is to improve the RF shielding and the RF filtering of all power, audio and control leads entering the affected unit.  Harmonics generated in situ  In situ harmonics occur when an RF current flows through a device, and harmonics are generated due to the non-linear nature of the device. This can be regarded as a rusty bolt effect which exists within the malfunctioning device. A good example of this is the pair of diodes which protect the receivers in many VHF rigs lacking an electromechanical relay to switch between transmit and receive (such as the 144 MHz DJ-F1E) from the transmitter's RF output. In the case of the DJ-F1E, these diodes can create intermodulation products when the radio set is overloaded.  Reproduction of the signal in an IF stage  It is possible for the unwanted signal to enter an Intermediate frequency stage, and if it falls within the passband of the stage, it can cause an unwanted effect. In an AM system, it is possible that the unwanted signal will be amplified by the linear stage and appear finally to the detector as if it were a sideband of the carrier, it is possible sometimes for harmonics of an HF transmitter generated within a TV set to enter the video IF (which is at about 30 MHz). These harmonics which enter the TV IF could give similar herring bone pattern effects to those seen when harmonics of the HF transmitter are generated in the front end. In FM systems where the IF stage gain is very high and the stage is designed to be linear, it is likely that if the unwanted signal is at least 10 dB weaker than the wanted signal that the capture effect will result in the receiver ignoring the unwanted signal. If however the unwanted signal is stronger than the wanted signal then it is likely that the receiver will be unable to demodulate the wanted signal. This is related to the normal method of jamming FM systems, to jam an FM signal it is normal to transmit a signal which is 10 dB stronger (at the front end of the target receiver) and is within the plateau of most narrow IF stage.  Cures  Braid-breakers If an electronic device with a long coaxial aerial lead is disturbed by a signal from a HF transmitter then the braid of the coaxial should be considered as a path of entry of RF into the affected device. One additional feature which can assist a braid breaker is the use of an RF ground, a quarter wavelength of wire will act as an RF ground even when it goes nowhere. This is because the quarterwave transforms the infinite impedance into a zero impedance. The quarterwave length of wire can be regarded as an artificial earth for RF purposes. By adding a braid-breaker filter to the system common mode signals will be attenuated while unbalanced signals will be allowed to pass unhindered. This is also something which is added to long leads in military electronic equipment which is intended to continue to function even after being subjected to a nuclear electromagnetic pulse (EMP) and also would increase the likelihood of an electronic device surviving a nearby lightning strike (direct lightning hits are very hard to protect against). For UHF TV a wide range of good designs exist, these include a ferrite RF choke on the downlead and some networks of passive components. On the left is a normal TV installation which is being troubled by TVI while on the right is a TV installation which has features to eliminate/mitigate the TVI  RF chokes on leads  RF chokes are a well used method for filtering many leads on communication equipment. In common with the braid breaker the intention is to suppress common mode signals. One popular method of making an RF choke is to use a large ferrite bead where the cable passes through the hole. Such chokes can often be seen on the power connection leads of laptops and on the video signal leads of computer monitors. The addition of RF chokes can often reduce greatly the RF current flowing through a TV set and hence improve the immunity of the installation.  Filters in the aerial lead  If the receiver's input is routed via a device which rejects the unwanted signals then this additional filtering can improve the immunity of the installation. It is the case that the additional filter will improve the situation. When a transmitter needs to be colocated with a receiver where the frequency difference is very small (for example 145.000 and 145.600 MHz) the cavity filters can be used on both the transmitter and the receiver to improve the purity of the transmitter and the immunity of the receiver. One design for VHF/UHF TV which also has the ability to filter out 144 MHz, 432 MHz and 1296 MHz signals has been created by a Russian (UA9FAD).. A design for UHF TV which is designed for the six meter band (50 MHz) has been published by the UK six meter group. One design for FM radios (band II) has been created by a German (DF9CY)  Audio equipment   Different transmitter modes  It is possible for the non-linear circuits within audio equipment to act as an inadvertent radio receiver. In the case of FM transmitters a click may be heard as the RF field appears and also when it disappears. In the case of amplitude modulation it is possible for the original audio to be recovered by the affected device. AM is still used for longwave and mediumwave broadcasting, and sometimes in communications equipment used by services such as the fire brigade, military or police. A weird animal quacking or an unintelligible human voice is a likely sign that the transmitter is using single-sideband modulation. SSB (single-sideband) tends to be used in applications where long range communication is needed. Here, the non-linear device is mixing frequencies, but because the carrier has been suppressed, it is not possible to restore the original audio with such a simple demodulator.  Stereo leads as a dipole  It is the case that a stereo system with external speaker attached by long leads to the main unit (holding the audio electronics) can be troubled by EMC problems which are caused by the speaker leads acting as a dipole antenna. One method of curing this is to add a ferrite choke to the speaker leads close to where they enter the main unit.  Rectification in the audio equipment  According to the RSGB handbook one common way in which stereo systems are affected is when the RF current picked up by the speaker cable, and then flows through the feedback circuit into an early stage in the audio amplifier. The RF is then rectified when it flows through the base/emitter junction of a bipolar transistor.

Gilkey (1890-1976) and Mildred (Talbot) Gilkey, and was raised in Ames, Iowa, where his father was a professor of Engineering. He earned a Bachelor's of Science degree from Iowa State in 1949 and, after a tour of duty in the Navy during World War II, began graduate study in Geology at Columbia University, where he earned a Master of Science degree in 1950. Prior to his death, Gilkey had completed his doctoral dissertation, “Fracture Pattern of the Zuni Uplift,” and was posthumously awarded a Ph.D. His thesis advisor was Walter H. Bucher. An article Gilkey wrote with Arie Poldervaart was published posthumously. Gilkey explored Alaska in 1950 and 1952. He died during the 1953 American expedition to summit K2. At Camp III, he came down with thrombophlebitis (blood clots in the leg) or possibly deep venous thrombosis, followed by pulmonary embolism. His fellow expedition members, including Charles Houston and Pete Schoening, immediately turned back in an attempt to save his life. During the descent, Gilkey, wrapped in a sleeping bag, suddenly disappeared. It is believed he was swept away by an avalanche, but others conjecture that he untied himself from the ropes to spare his teammates from further risk on his behalf. Gilkey's remains were discovered in 1993, melting out of the glacier at the base of the south face of K2.

The earliest existing examples of the written Irish language are Ogham inscriptions dating from the 4th century. Extant manuscripts do not go back farther than the 7th century. Two works written by Saint Patrick, his Confessio and Letter to Coroticus were written in Latin some time in the 5th century, and preserved in the Book of Armagh. The earliest Irish authors It is unclear when literacy first came to Ireland. The earliest Irish writings are inscriptions, mostly simple memorials, on stone in the ogham alphabet, the earliest of which date to the 4th century. The Latin alphabet was in use by 431, when the fifth century Gaulish chronicler Prosper of Aquitaine records that Palladius was sent by Pope Celestine I as the first bishop to the Irish believers in Christ.Michael Richter, Medieval Ireland, Revised Edition, Gill & MacMillan, 2005, p. 11, 41 Pelagius, an influential British heretic who taught in Rome in the early 5th century, fragments of whose writings survive, is said by Jerome to have been of Irish descent.Jerome, Patrologia Latina, XXIV, 682, 758 Coelius Sedulius, the 5th century author of the Carmen Paschale, who has been called the \\"Virgil of theological poetry\\", was probably also Irish: the 9th-century Irish geographer Dicuil calls him noster Sedulius (\\"our Sedulius\\"), and the Latin name Sedulius usually translates to the Irish name Siadal. Two works written by Saint Patrick, his Confessio (\\"Declaration\\", a brief autobiography intended to justify his activities to the church in Britain) and Epistola (\\"Letter\\", condemning the raiding and slaving activities in Ireland of a British king, Coroticus), survive. They were written in Latin some time in the 5th century, and preserved in the Book of Armagh, dating to around 812, and a number of later manuscripts.A. B. E. Hood (ed. & trans.), St. Patrick: His Writings and Muirchu's Life, Phillimore, 1978 The 6th-century saint Colum Cille is known to have written, but only one work which may be his has survived: the psalter known as the Cathach or \\"Book of Battles\\", now in the Royal Irish Academy. Another important early writer in Latin is Columbanus (543-615), a missionary from Leinster who founded several monasteries in continental Europe, from whose hand survive sermons, letters and monastic rules, as well as poetry attributed to him whose authenticity is uncertain. The earliest identifiable writer in the Irish language is Dallán Forgaill, who wrote the Amra Coluim Chille, a poetic elegy to Colum Cille, shortly after the subject's death in 597. The Amra is written in archaic Old Irish and is not perfectly understood. It is preserved in heavily annotated versions in manuscripts from the 12th century on.Richter 2005, pp. 54-55 Only a little later, in the early 7th century, Luccreth moccu Chiara, a Kerryman, wrote poems recording the legendary origins of Munster dynasties, including Conailla Medb michuru (\\"Medb enjoined illegal contracts\\"), which contains the oldest surviving reference to characters and events from the Ulster Cycle.James Carney, \\"Language and literature in 1169\\", in Dáibhí Ó Cróinín (ed.), A New History of Ireland 1: Prehistoric and Early Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 451-510 The Old Irish glosses The oldest surviving manuscripts containing examples of the written Irish language date to the 8th century. Their Irish contents consist of glosses written between the lines or on the margins of religious works in Latin, most of them preserved in monasteries in Switzerland, Germany, France, and Italy, having been taken there by early Irish missionaries, and where, not being understood, they were rarely consulted and did not wear out, unlike their counterparts in Ireland.Rudolf Thurneysen, A Grammar of Old Irish, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1946, p. 4 They are thus quite different from manuscripts with significant Irish language content preserved in Ireland, the oldest of which is the Book of Armagh (c. 812). The early glosses, though of little interest outside of philology, show the wide learning of the commentators and the extraordinary development, even at that early period, of the language in which they wrote. Their language and style, says Kuno Meyer, stand on a high level in comparison with those of the Old High German glosses. \\"We find here\\", he writes, \\"a formed learned prose style which allows even the finest shades of thought to be easily and perfectly expressed, from which we must conclude that there must have been a long previous culture [of the language] going back at the very least to the beginning of the sixth century\\".Kuno Meyer, Kultur der Gegenwart, part I, section xi, p. 80 The glosses are to be found in manuscripts from Würzburg, St. Gallen, Karlsruhe, Milan, Turin, Sankt Paul im Lavanttal, and elsewhere. The Liber Hymnorum and the Stowe Missal are, after the glosses and the Book of Armagh, perhaps the most ancient manuscripts in which Irish is written. They date from about 900 to 1050. Existing manuscript literature The oldest books of miscellaneous literature are the Lebor na hUidre, or \\"Book of the Dun Cow\\", transcribed about 1100, and the Book of Leinster, which dates from about fifty years later. These books are great miscellaneous literary collections. After them come many valuable vellums. The date at which these manuscripts were penned is no criterion of the date at which their contents were first written, for many of them contain literature which, from the ancient forms of words and other indications, must have been committed to writing at least as early as the 7th century. We cannot carry these pieces further back with firm certainty using linguistic methods, but it is evident from their contents that many of them must have been orally transmitted for centuries before they were committed to writing. A 17th-century manuscript may sometimes give a more correct version of a 7th-century piece than a vellum many centuries older. The exact number of Irish manuscripts still existing has never been accurately determined. The number in the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, alone is enormous, probably amounting to some fifteen hundred. O'Curry, O'Longan, and O'Beirne catalogued a little more than half the manuscripts in the Academy, and the catalogue filled thirteen volumes containing 3448 pages; to these an alphabetic index of the pieces contained was made in three volumes, and an index of the principal names, in addition to some other material in thirteen volumes more. From an examination of these books one may roughly calculate that the pieces catalogued would number about eight or ten thousand, varying from long epic sagas to single quatrains or stanzas, and yet there remains a great deal more to be indexed, a work which after a delay of very many years is happily now at last in process of accomplishment. The Library of Trinity College, Dublin, also contains a great number of valuable manuscripts of all ages, many of them vellums, probably about 160. The British Museum, the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, the Advocates Library in Edinburgh, and the Bibliothèque Royale in Brussels are all repositories of a large number of valuable manuscripts. From what we know of the contents of the existing manuscripts we may set down as follows a rough classification of the literature contained in them. We may well begin with the ancient epics dating substantially from pagan times, probably first written down in the seventh century or even earlier. These epics generally contain verses of poetry and often whole poems, just as in the case of the French chantefable, Aucassin et Nicollet. After the substantially pagan efforts may come the early Christian literature, especially the lives of the saints, which are both numerous and valuable, visions, homilies, commentaries on the Scriptures, monastic rules, prayers, hymns, and all possible kinds of religious and didactic poetry. After these we may place the many ancient annals, and there exists besides a great mass of genealogical books, tribal histories, and semi-historical romances. After this may come the bardic poetry of Ireland, the poetry of the hereditary poets attached to the great Gaelic families and the provincial kings, from the 9th century down to the 17th. Then follow the Brehon Laws and other legal treaties, and an enormous quantity of writings on Irish and Latin grammar, glossaries of words, metrical tracts, astronomical, geographical, and medical works. Nor is there any lack of free translations from classical and medieval literature, such as Lucan's Bellum Civile, Bede's Historica Ecclesiastica, Mandeville's Travels, Arthurian romances and the like. To this catalogue may perhaps be added the unwritten folk-lore of the island both in prose and verse which has only lately begun to be collected, but of which considerable collections have already been made. Such, then, is a brief and bald résumé of what the student will find before him in the Irish language. There may be observed in this list two remarkable omissions. There is no epic handed down entirely in verse, and there is no dramatic literature. The Irish epic is in prose, though it is generally interwoven with numerous poems, for though epic poems exist in rhyme, such as some of the Ossianic poems, they are of modern date, and none of the great and ancient epics are constructed in this way. The absence of the drama, however, is more curious still. Highly cultivated as Irish literature undoubtedly was, and excellent scholars both in Greek and Latin as the early Irish were, nevertheless they do not seem to have produced even a miracle play. It has been alleged that some of the Ossianic poems, especially those containing a semi-humorous, semi-serious dialogue between the last of the great pagans, the poet Oisín (Ossian as he is called in Scotland), and the first of the great Christian leaders, St. Patrick, were originally intended to be acted, or at least recited, by different people. If this be really so, then the Irish had at least the rudiments of a drama, but they never appear to have carried it beyond these rudiments, and the absence of all real dramatic attempt, however it may be accounted for, is one of the first things that is likely to strike with astonishment the student of comparative literature. Early Irish epic or saga In Ireland, the prose epic or saga developed, and kept on developing, for well over a thousand years. In the Book of Leinster, a manuscript of the middle 12th century, we find a list of the names of 187 epic sagas. The ollam, or arch-poet, who was the highest dignitary among the poets, and whose training lasted for some twelve years, was obliged to learn two hundred and fifty of these prime sagas and one hundred secondary ones. The manuscripts themselves divide these prime sagas into the following categories, from the very names of which we may get a glance of the genius of the early Gael, and form some conception of the tragic nature of his epic: Destruction of Fortified Places, Cow Spoils (i.e., cattle-raids), Courtships or Wooings, Battles, Stories of Caves, Navigations, Tragical Deaths, Feasts, Sieges, Adventures of Travel, Elopements, Slaughters, Water-eruptions, Expeditions, Progresses, and Visions. \\"He is no poet\\", says the Book of Leinster, \\"who does not synchronize and harmonize all these stories.\\" In addition to the names of 187 sagas in that book, more names occur in the 10th or 11th century tale of MacCoise. All the known ones—except for one added later, and another with a transcription error—refer to events prior to 650 or thereabouts. Apparently then, the list was drawn up in the 7th century. No trace of author identity remains. Author may not even be the right word for stories that likely grew gradually—woven around racial, tribal, or even family history, and in some cases around incidents of early Celtic mythology. This process formed stories that were told and retold, burnished and added to by professional poets and saga-tellers. Some of them were handed down for generations before ever put on parchments, even before scholars made lists of just their names and contents. Those that recount ancient tribal events or dynastic wars were probably much exaggerated, magnified, and undoubtedly distorted over time. More recent tales may provide fairly accurate accounts of real events. It seems certain that—as soon as Christianity pervaded the island and bardic schools and colleges formed alongside the monasteries—no class of learning more popular than studying the great traditional doings, exploits, and tragedies of the various Irish tribes, families, and races. The peregrinations of the bards and communication among their colleges must have propagated throughout Ireland any local traditions worthy of preservation. These stories embodied the essence of the island's national life, but only a few of their enormous number survive—and most of these are mutilated, or preserved in mere digests. Some, however, survive at nearly full length. These ancient vellums, however, probably don't tell the same exact tales as did the professional poet, for the poets didn't write them. Generally, early Christian monks recorded the tales. They took interest and pride in preserving early memorials of their people. They cultivated the native language to such a degree that at an early period it was used alongside Latin, and soon almost displaced it, even in the Church itself. This patriotism of the Irish monks and early cultivation of the vernacular are remarkable, since it was the reverse of what took place in the rest of Europe. Elsewhere, the Church used Latin as a principal means of destroying native and pagan tradition. The Northmen inflicted irrevocable losses on the Irish from the end of the 8th to the middle of the 11th century—followed by the ravages of the Norman invasion of Ireland, and the later and more ruthless destructions by the Elizabethan and Cromwellian English. Despite those tragic and violent cultural wounds, O'Curry could assert that he knew of 4,000 large quarto pages of strictly historical tales. He computes that tales of the Ossianic and Fenian cycles would fill 3,000 more and that, in addition to these, miscellaneous and imaginative cycles that are neither historical nor Fenian, would fill 5,000. Pagan literature and Christian sentiment The bulk of the ancient stories and some of the ancient poems were probably committed to writing by monks of the 7th century, but are substantially pagan in origin, conception, and colouring. Yet there is scarcely one of them in which some Christian allusion to heaven, or hell, or the Deity, or some Biblical subject, does not appear. This is likely because, when Christianity displaced paganism, in a tacit compromise, sympathetic clerics let the bard, fili (poet), and the representative of the old pagan learning propagate their stories, tales, poems, and genealogies—at the price of a little Christian admixture. So respectful is the dovetailing of the Christian into the pagan in most of the oldest romances, that even casual analysis easily separates the pieces. The pagan substratum stands forth entirely distinct from the Christian addition. For example, in the evidently pagan saga called the Wooing of Étaín, we find the description of the pagan paradise given its literary passport by a cunningly interwoven allusion to Adam's fall. Étaín was the wife of one of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who were gods. She is reborn as a mortal—the pagan Irish seem to have believed in metempsychosis—and weds the king of Ireland. Her former husband of the Tuatha Dé Danann still loves her, follows her into life as a mortal, and tries to win her back by singing a captivating description of the glowing unseen land to which he would lure her. \\"O lady fair, wouldst thou come with me,\\" he cries \\"...to the wondrous land that is ours?\\" He describes how, \\"..the crimson of the foxglove is in every brake—a beauty of land the land I speak of. Youth never grows into old age there, warm sweet streams traverse the country...\\" etc. Then the evidently pagan description of this land of the gods is made passable by an added verse that adroitly tells us that, though the inhabitants of this glorious country saw everyone, nobody saw them, \\"...because the cloud of Adam's wrongdoing has concealed us.\\" This easy analysis of the early Irish literature into its pre-Christian and post-Christian elements lends an absorbing interest and a great value in the history of European thought. For, when all Christian additions are removed, we find a picture of pagan life in Europe that we can't find elsewhere. \\"The church adopted [in Ireland] towards Pagan sagas the same position that it adopted toward Pagan law [...] I see no reasons for doubting that really genuine pictures of a pre-Christian culture are preserved to us in the individual sagas.Ernst Windisch, Irische Texte, I, 258 \\"The saga originated in Pagan and was propagated in Christian times, and that too without its seeking fresh nutriment, as a rule, from Christian elements. But we must ascribe it to the influence of Christianity that what is specifically pagan in Irish saga is shifted into the background. And yet there exist many whose contents are plainly mythological. The Christian monks were certainly not the first who reduced the ancient sagas to fixed form. but later on they copied them faithfully and promulgated them after Ireland had been converted to Christianity\\".Ernst Windisch, Irische Texte, I,62 Irish literature and early Europe When it is understood that the ancient Irish sagas record, even though it be in a more or less distorted fashion, in some cases reminiscences of a past mythology, and in others real historical events, dating from the pagan times, then it needs only a moment's reflection to realize their value. Zimmer writes that nothing except a spurious criticism that \\"...takes for original and primitive the most palpable nonsense of which Middle-Irish writers from the Twelfth to the Sixteenth century are guilty with regard to their own antiquity, which is in many respects strange and foreign to them, nothing but such a criticism can on the other hand make the attempt to doubt of the historical character of the chief persons of the saga cycles. For we believe that Méve, Conor MacNessa, Cuchulainn, and Fionn mac Cumhaill (Cool) are just as much historical personalities as Arminius or Dietrich of Berne or Etzel, and their date is just as well determined.\\" (Kelt. Studien, fasc. ii, 189.) The first three of these lived in the 1st century BC, and Finn in the 2nd or 3rd century. D'Arbois de Jubainville expresses himself to the same effect. \\"We have no reason\\", he writes, \\"to doubt the reality of the principal rôle in this [cycle of Cuchulainn]\\" (Introduction à l'étude de la littérature celtique, 217); and of the story of the Boru tribute imposed on Leinster in the 1st century he writes: \\"The story has real facts for a basis though certain details may have been created by the imagination\\"; and again, \\"Irish epic story, barbarous though it be, is, like Irish law, a monument of a civilization far superior to that of the most ancient Germans\\" (L'épopée celtique en Irlande, preface, p. xli.). \\"Ireland in fact,\\" writes M. Darmesteter in his English Studies, which summarize conclusions he derives from the works of the great Celtic scholars, \\"...has the peculiar privilege of a history continuous from the earliest centuries of our era to the present days. She has preserved in the infinite wealth of her literature a complete and faithful picture of the ancient civilization of the Celts. Irish literature is therefore the key which opens the Celtic world (Eng. tr., 1896, 182). But the Celtic world means a large portion of Europe and the key to its past history can be found at present nowhere else than in the Irish manuscripts. Without them we would have to view the past history of a great part of Europe through that distorting medium, the coloured glasses of the Greeks and Romans, to whom all outer nations were barbarians, into whose social life they had no motive for inquiring. Apart from Irish literature we would have no means of estimating what were the feelings, modes of life, manners, and habits of those great Celtic races who once possessed so large a part of the ancient world, Gaul, Belgium, North Italy, parts of Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and the British Isles, who burnt Rome, plundered Greece, and colonized Asia Minor. But in the ancient epics of Ireland we find another standard by which to measure, and through this early Irish medium we get a clear view of the life and manners of the race in one of its strongholds, and we find many characteristic customs of the continental Celts, which are just barely mentioned or alluded to by Greek and Roman writers, reappearing in all the circumstance and expansion of saga-telling. Of such is the custom of the \\"Hero's Bit\\" Posidonius mentions, which provides the foundation for one of the most famous Irish sagas, Bricriu's Feast. The Irish sagas repeatedly refer to the chariot, which became obsolete in Gaul a couple of hundred years before Caesar's invasion. In the greatest of the epic cycles, the warriors always fight from chariots. We find, as Diodorus Siculus mentions, that the bards had power to make battles cease by interposing with song between the combatants. Caesar says (Gallic War, 6.14) the Gaulish druids spent twenty years in studying and learned a great number of verses, but Irish literature tells us what the arch-poet, probably the counterpart of the Gaulish druid, actually did learn. \\"The manners and customs in which the men of the time lived and moved are depicted,\\" writes Windisch, \\"...with a naive realism which leaves no room for doubt as to the former actuality of the scenes depicted. In matter of costume and weapons, eating and drinking, building and arrangement of the banqueting hall, manners observed at the feasts and much more, we find here the most valuable information.\\" (Ir. Texte I, 252). \\"I insist,\\" he says elsewhere, \\"..that Irish saga is the only flowing source of unbroken Celtism.\\" \\"It is the ancient Irish language,\\" says d'Arbois de Jubainville, \\"that forms the connecting point between the neo-Celtic languages and the Gaulish of the inscribed stones, coins, and proper names preserved in Greek and Roman literature.\\" It is evident that those of the great Continental nations of today, whose ancestors were mostly Celtic—but whose language, literature, and traditions have completely disappeared—must, to study their own past, turn to Ireland. The principal saga cycles There are four great cycles in Irish story-telling, not all of which fully survive. Mythological Cycle The Mythological Cycle dealt with the Tuatha Dé Danann, the gods of good, and the Fomorians, gods of darkness and evil, and giving us, under the apparently early history of the various races that colonised Ireland, really a distorted early Celtic pantheon. According to these accounts, the Nemedians first seized upon the islands and were oppressed by the Fomorians, who are described as African sea-robbers; these races nearly exterminated each other at the fight round Conand's Tower on Tory Island. Some of the Nemedians escaped to Greece and came back a couple of hundred years later calling themselves Fir Bolg. Others of the Nemedians who escaped came back later, calling themselves the Tuatha Dé Danann. These last fought the battle of North Moytura and beat the Fir Bolg. They fought the battle of South Moytura later and beat the Fomorians. They held the island until the Gaels, also called Milesians or Scoti, came in and vanquished them. Good sagas about both of these battles are preserved, each existing in only a single copy. Nearly all the rest of this most interesting cycle has been lost or is to be found merely in condensed summaries. These mythological pieces dealt with people, dynasties, and probably the struggle between good and evil principles. There is over it all a sense of vagueness and uncertainty. Ulster Cycle The Ulster Cycle (), formerly known as the Red Branch Cycle, one of the four great cycles of Irish mythology, is a body of medieval Irish heroic legends and sagas of the traditional heroes of the Ulaid in what is now eastern Ulster and northern Leinster, particularly counties Armagh, Down and Louth. The Ulster Cycle stories are set in and around the reign of King Conchobar mac Nessa, who rules the Ulaid from Emain Macha (now Navan Fort near Armagh). The most prominent hero of the cycle is Conchobar's nephew, Cú Chulainn. The Ulaid are most often in conflict with the Connachta, led by their queen, Medb, her husband, Ailill, and their ally Fergus mac Róich, a former king of the Ulaid in exile. The longest and most important story of the cycle is the Táin Bó Cúailnge or Cattle Raid of Cooley, in which Medb raises an enormous army to invade the Cooley peninsula and steal the Ulaid's prize bull, Donn Cúailnge, opposed only by the seventeen-year-old Cú Chulainn. In the Mayo Táin, the Táin Bó Flidhais it is a white cow known as the 'Maol' that is the object of desire, for she can give enough milk at one milking to feed an army. Perhaps the best known story is the tragedy of Deirdre, source of plays by W. B. Yeats and J. M. Synge. Other stories tell of the births, courtships and deaths of the characters and of the conflicts between them. Fenian Cycle After the Red Branch or heroic cycle we find a very comprehensive and even more popular body of romance woven round Fionn Mac Cumhaill, his son Oisin, his grandson Oscar, in the reigns of the High Kings Conn of the Hundred Battles, his son Art Oénfer, and his grandson Cormac mac Airt, in the second and third centuries. This cycle of romance is usually called the Fenian cycle because it deals so largely with Fionn Mac Cumhaill and his fianna (militia). These, according to Irish historians, were a body of Irish janissaries maintained by the Irish kings for the purpose of guarding their coasts and fighting their battles, but they ended by fighting the king himself and were destroyed by the famous Battle of Gabhra. As the heroic cycle is often called the Ulster cycle, so this is also known as the Leinster cycle of sagas, because it may have had its origin, as MacNeill has suggested, amongst the Galeoin, a non-Milesian tribe and subject race, who dwelt around the Hill of Allen in Leinster. This whole body of romance is of later growth or rather expresses a much later state of civilization than the Cúchulainn stories. There is no mention of fighting in chariots, of the Hero's Bit, or of many other characteristics that mark the antiquity of the Ulster cycle. Very few pieces belonging to the Fionn story occur in Old Irish, and the great mass of texts is of Middle and Late Irish growth. The extension of the story to all the Gaelic-speaking parts of the kingdom is placed by MacNeill between the years 400 and 700; up to this time it was (as the product of a vassal race) propagated only orally. Various parts of the Fionn saga seem to have developed in different quarters of the country, that about Diarmuid Ua Duibhne in South Munster, and that about Goll mac Morna in Connacht. Certain it is that this cycle was by far the most popular and widely spread of the three, being familiarly known in every part of Ireland and of Gaelic-speaking Scotland even to the present day. It developed also in a direction of its own, for though none of the heroic tales are wholly in verse, yet the number of Ossianic epopees, ballads, and poems is enormous, amounting to probably some 50,000 lines, mostly in the more modern language. Historical cycle It was part of the duty of the medieval Irish bards, or court poets, to record the history of the family and the genealogy of the king they served. This they did in poems that blended the mythological and the historical to a greater or lesser degree. The resulting stories form what has come to be known as the Historical Cycle, or more correctly Cycles, as there are a number of independent groupings. The kings that are included range from the almost entirely mythological Labraid Loingsech, who allegedly became High King of Ireland around 431 BC, to the entirely historical Brian Boru. However, the greatest glory of the Historical Cycle is the Buile Shuibhne (The Frenzy of Sweeney), a 12th-century tale told in verse and prose. Suibhne, king of Dál nAraidi, was cursed by St Ronan and became a kind of half man, half bird, condemned to live out his life in the woods, fleeing from his human companions. The story has captured the imaginations of contemporary Irish poets and has been translated by Trevor Joyce and Seamus Heaney. Early Christian literature Perhaps no country that ever adopted Christianity was so thoroughly and rapidly permeated and perhaps saturated with its language and concepts as was Ireland. It adopted and made its own in secular life scores and hundreds of words originally used by the Church for ecclesiastical purposes. Even to the present day we find in Irish words like póg, borrowed from the Latin for \\"[the kiss] of peace\\", pac[is], Old Irish póc. From the same root comes baitheas, \\"the crown of the head\\", i.e. the baptized part. A common word for warrior, or hero, laich, now laoch, is simply from laicus, a layman. The Latin language was, of course, the one used for religious purposes, both in prose and verse, for some time after the introduction of Christianity. In it were written the earliest hymns: Saint Patrick used it in his Confession, as did Adomnán in his \\"Life of Columcille\\". But already by the middle of the 8th century the native language had largely displaced it all over Ireland as a medium for religious thought, for homilies, for litanies, books of devotion, and the lives of saints. We find the Irish language used in a large religious literature, much of which is native, some of which represents lost Latin originals now known to us only in Irish translations. One interesting development in this class of literature is the visions- literature beginning with the vision of St. Fursa, which is given at some length by Bede, and of which Sir Francis Palgrave states that, \\"Tracing the course of thought upwards we have no difficulty in deducing the poetic genealogy of Dante's Inferno to the Milesian Fursæus.\\" These \\"visions\\" were very popular in Ireland, and so numerous they gave rise to the parody, the 12th century Aislinge Meic Con Glinne. More important than these, however, are the lives of the saints, because many of them, dating back to a very remote period, throw a great deal of light on the manners of the early Irish. In the first half of the 17th century Brother Michael O'Cleary, a Franciscan, travelled round Ireland and made copies of between thirty and forty lives of Irish saints, which are still preserved in the Burgundian library at Brussels. Nine, at least, exist elsewhere in ancient vellums. A part of one of them, the voyage of St. Brendan, spread all through Europe, but the Latin version is much more complete than any existing Irish one, the original having probably been lost. Irish historical literature Owing to the nature of the case, and considering the isolation of Ireland, it is extremely difficult, or rather impossible, to procure independent foreign testimony, to the truth of Irish annals. But, although such testimony is denied us, yet there happily exists another kind of evidence to which we may appeal with comparative confidence. This is nothing less than the records of natural phenomena reported in the annals, for if it can be shown by calculating backwards, as modern science has enabled us to do, that such natural phenomena as the appearance of comets or the occurrence of eclipses are recorded to the day and hour by the annalists, then we can also say with something like certainty that these phenomena were recorded at their appearance by writers who personally observed them, and whose writings must have been actually consulted and seen by these later annalists whose books we now possess. If we take, let us say, the Annals of Ulster, which treat of Ireland and Irish history from about the year 444, but of which the written copy dates only from the 15th century, we see from the years 496 to 884 as many as eighteen records of eclipses and comets, and all these agree exactly with modern astronomy. How impossible it is to keep such records unless written memoranda are made at the time by eyewitnesses is shown by the fact that Bede, born in 675, in recording the great solar eclipse that took place only eleven years before his own birth, is yet two days astray in his date; while on the other hand the Annals of Ulster give, not only the correct day, but the correct hour, thus showing that their compiler, Cathal Maguire, had access either to the original, or a copy of an original, account by an eyewitness. Whenever any side-lights have been thrown from an external quarter on the Irish annals, either from Cymric, Saxon, or Continental sources, they have always tended to show their accuracy. We may take it then without any credulity on our part, that Irish history as recorded in the annals may be pretty well relied upon from the 4th century onward. The first scholar whom we know to have written connected annals was Tighearnach, Abbott of Clonmacnoise, who died in 1088. He began in Latin with the founding of Rome; later on he makes occasional mention of Irish affairs, and lays it down that Irish history is not to be trusted before the reign of Cimbaed, that is, prior to about the year 300 BC, Omnia monimeta Scotorum [the Irish were always called Scotti till into the late Middle Ages] usque Cimbaed incerta erant. In the 4th century BC the references to Ireland become fuller and more numerous, they are partly in Latin, partly in Irish, but towards the end of the work Latin gives way to the native speech. The greatest book of annals, with a few trifling exceptions also the latest, is known under the title of the \\"Four Masters\\". It is evident from the entries that the compilers of the \\"annals of Ulster\\" and the rest copied from ancient originals. In the \\"Annals of Ulster\\" for instance, we read under the year 439 Chronicon magnum scriptum est, at the years 467 and 468 the compiler writes sic in libro Cuanach inveni, at 482 ut Cuana scriptsit, at 507 secundum librum Mochod, at 628 sicut in libro Dubhdaleithe narratur, etc. No nation in Europe can boast of so continuous and voluminous a history preserved in a vernacular literature. The only surviving history of Ireland as distinguished from annals was written by Geoffrey Keating, a learned priest, in the first half of the 17th century. It also is taken, almost exclusively, from the old vellum manuscripts then surviving, but that mostly perished, as Keating no doubt foresaw they would, in the cataclysm of the Cromwellian wars. Irish poetry No other vernacular poetry in Europe has gone through so long, so unbroken, and so interesting a period of development as the Irish. The oldest poems are ascribed to the early Milesians and may be the most ancient pieces of vernacular literature. None of the early poems rhymed. Little distinguishes them from prose, except a strong tendency, as in the Germanic languages, toward alliteration, and a leaning toward disyllables. They are also so ancient as to be unintelligible without heavy glosses. It is a tremendous claim to make for the Celt that he \\"taught Europe to rhyme\\", yet it has often been made for him, and not by himself, but by such men as Zeuss, the father of Celtic learning, Constantine Nigra, and others. Certain it is that by the time of the Irish mission to the continent, as early as the 7th century, we find the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection, that is, centuries before most of the vernacular literatures of Europe knew anything at all about it. Nor are their rhymes only such as we are accustomed to in English, French, or German poetry, for they delighted not only in full rhymes, like these nations, but also in assonances, like the Spaniards, and they often thought more of a middle rhyme than of an end rhyme. The following Latin verses, written no doubt after his native models by Aengus Mac Tipraite some time prior to the year 704, will give the reader an idea of the middle or interlinear rhyming which the Irish have practiced from the earliest times down to the present day: : Martinus mirus more : Ore laudavit Deum, : Puro Corde cantavit : Atque amavit Eum. Among the few surviving Old Irish poems of this early period is Pangur Bán, probably written in Reichenau abbey shortly after the year 800. A very curious and interesting peculiarity of a certain sort of Irish verse is a desire to end a second line with a word with a syllable more than that which ends the first, the stress of the voice being thrown back a syllable in the last word of the second line. Thus, if the first line end with an accented monosyllable, the second line will end with a disyllabic word accented on its first syllable, or if the first line end with a disyllable accented on its penultimate the second line will end with a trisyllable accented on its ante-penultimate. This is called aird-rinn in Irish, as: : Fall'n the land of learned mén : The bardic band is fállen, : None now learn a song to sing : For long our fern is fading. This metre, which from its popularity must be termed the \\"hexameter of the Irish\\", is named Deibhidhe (D'yevvee), and well shows in the last two lines the internal rhyme to which we refer. If it be maintained, as Thurneysen maintains, that the Irish derived their rhyming verses from the Latins, it seems necessary to account for the peculiar forms that so much of this verse assumed in Irish, for the merest glance will show that the earliest Irish verse is full of tours de force, like this aird-runn, which cannot have been derived from Latin. There were two kinds of poets known to the early Gael. the principle of those was called the filè; there were seven grades of filès, the most exalted being called an ollamh. These last were so highly esteemed that the annalists often give their obituaries, as though they were so many princes. It took from twelve to twenty years to arrive at this dignity. Some fragments of the old metrical textbooks still exist, showing the courses required from the various grades of poets, in pre-Norse times. One of these, in elucidation of the metric, gives the first lines of three hundred and fifty different poems, all no doubt well known at the time of writing, but of which only about three have come down entire to our own time. If there were seven species of filès there were sixteen grades of bards, each with a different name, and each had its own peculiar metres (of which the Irish had over 300) allotted to him. During the wars with the Norsemen the bards suffered fearfully, and it must have been at this time, that is during the 9th and 10th centuries, that the finely drawn distinction between poets and bards seems to have come to an end. So highly esteemed was the poetic art in Ireland that Keating in his history tells us that at one time no less than a third of the patrician families of Ireland followed that profession. These constituted a heavy drain on the resources of the country, and at three different periods in Irish history the people tried to shake off their incubus. However, Columcille, who was a poet himself, befriended them; at the Synod of Druim Ceat, in the 6th century, their numbers were reduced and they were shorn of many of their prerogatives; but, on the other hand, public lands were set apart for their colleges, and these continued until the later English conquest, when those who escaped the spear of Elizabeth fell beneath the sword of Cromwell.

Coffee, with the help of Thomas Swain. After establishing the counties of Early, Irwin, and Appling in 1819, the Georgia General Assembly approved construction of the road December 23, 1822, with funds of $1,500. The trail was built in the early 1820s and ran from Jacksonville, Georgia, through Metcalf and across the Florida border to Tallahassee. The trail was about wide, cleared, dug, and leveled by enslaved African-American laborers. This became the first vehicular path through the region. The trail was initially built to carry munitions of war to Florida Territory to fight the Indians during the Creek Wars. It was later used by settlers moving into the Georgia frontier. It has no bridges or ditches and only private ferry crossings. Many pioneer families, including Hall, Folsom, Roundtree, Parrish, and Knight, migrated to claim land for farms and plantations.

A regional center in the northern portion of the state, it is the second most populous city in the region with 105,059 inhabitants, second only to the city of Passo Fundo. The municipality ranks 17th in total gross domestic product in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Erechim was one of the first planned modern cities in Brazil. City planners were inspired by urban concepts used in the design of Washington, D.C. (1791) and Paris (1850). These were characterized by very wide streets and bold outlines, with diagonal streets converging at important points. Key elements of its design include a perpendicular grid of streets cut by diagonal avenues, blocks of regular dimensions and a promenade around its perimeter. The municipality is located north of Rio Grande do Sul, in the Upper Uruguay, on the ridge of the Serra Geral. The origin of the name of Erechim refers to the ancient indigenous inhabitants of the region, and comes from \\"Caingangue, which means \\"small field\\"; it probably was given this name as the city was surrounded by forests at the time. History Maurício Cardoso Square in 1920s The city was initially called the Great Barn and then successively named Boa Vista, Boa Vista Erechim, Jose Bonifacio Erechim and finally just Erechim. Like many other villages in Brazil, it was built beside the railroad, in this case, the railroad that linked Rio Grande do Sul to São Paulo. The town was settled mostly by Polish, Italian and German immigrants, 36 pioneers from Europe and others from the old lands (Caxias do Sul). They came by railroad in 1908, building their homes beside the track, and the place soon became a district of Passo Fundo. The town's early economy depended on agriculture, livestock production, trade and services. It thrived and the city of Erechim was created on April 30, 1918, through Decree No. 2343 of April 30, signed by Antonio Borges, then governor of Rio Grande do Sul. Once known as the \\"Capital of Wheat\\" due to the high volumes of grain produced, today Erechim is considered the \\"Capital of Friendship\\". Origins of the city's urban design The following testimony was written in 1970 by José Maria de Amorim, the first clerk of Erechim, who lived there from 1924 until the date of his death on December 12, 1978. He recounts the design aspects of the city, its origin and its setbacks, which are not yet recorded in the official history of the county. Today Erechim, with its ups and downs, is still thriving and flourishing. It has the air of a big city, with its cobbled streets and low buildings, and is increasingly known as the Capital of Friendship. Notable people Victoria's Secret supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio (b. 1981) was born in Erechim. Also well known are Erechim born football players including former goalkeeper Gilmar Rinaldi, who played at Internacional, São Paulo and Flamengo, Fernando, Striker Rafael Sóbis, currently playing at Tigres UANL, and the former midfielder and current coach, Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani. Transportation Erechim is served by Erechim Airport with scheduled flights to various cities. The city can be reached by road via state highways RS-135, RS-331, RS-419, RS-420, RST-480, and federal highways BR-153 and BR-480. These roads link the various municipalities in the region and are all paved. Erechim lies 360 km from the state capital, Porto Alegre.

He was postulated to the see of St. Andrews (Cell Rígmonaid or Cill Rìmhinn) while holding the position as Bishop-elect of Glasgow, which he resigned when, on 2 June 1271, he was elected to that vacant see. He was succeeded at Glasgow by his cousin (consanguieus), Robert Wishart. His election to St. Andrews was notable, because apparently the bishopric's Céli Dé community were excluded from the election. Pope Gregory X charged the Bishop of Moray, the Bishop of Aberdeen, and the Bishop of Argyll, to look over the character of the elect and to investigate the legitimacy of the election, of the latter of which the Pope had suspicions. William, however, emerged successfully, and was consecrated at Scone on 15 October 1273. William died on 28 May 1279, at Morebattle in Teviotdale. He was buried at St Andrews.

The fort is connected to the neighboring Visapur fort by a small range. The fort was under the Maratha empire for the majority of the time, with a short period of 5 years under the Mughal empire. History Lohagad has a long history with several dynasties occupying it at different periods of time: Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavas, Bahamanis, Nizams, Mughals and Marathas. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured it in 1648 AD, but he was forced to surrender it to the Mughals in 1665 AD by the Treaty of Purandar. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj recaptured the fort in 1670 AD and used it for keeping his treasury. This fort was used to keep the loot from Surat. Later in Peshwa time Nana Phadnavis used this fort for living for some time and built several structures in the fort such as a big tank and a step-well.The lohagad fort also has caves on its south side facing Lohgadwadi.  Jain Inscription  In September 2019 an inscription in Brahmi script in Prakrit language dating back to the 2nd or 1st century BC was discovered by team of trekkers from Pune (Vivek Kale, Saiprakash Belsare, Abhinav Kurkute, Amey Joshi, Ninad Bartakke and Ajay Dhamdhere)https://www.ancient-asia-journal.com/articles/10.5334/aa.187/ in the cave on the cliff. The inscription was studied by Dr.Shreekant Pradhan (an ancient Indian paintings scholar working at Deccan College Post Graduate and Research Institute),Abhinav kurkute and Vivek Kale https://www.ancient-asia- journal.com/articles/10.5334/aa.187/ https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/jain-inscription-discovered-on- wall-of-rock-cut-cave-at-lohgad-fort/articleshow/71470386.cms The inscription was found on the outside wall of a rock-cut cave on the eastern side cliff of the Lohgad fort, close to Lohgadwadi village. The inscription is written in the Brahmi script and the language is Prakrit influenced Sanskrit. The inscription is similar to, but more descriptive than, an inscription discovered at Pale caves (Maval)by Mr. R.L.Bhide and studied by archaeologists HD Sankalia and Shobhana Gokhale in 1969. It starts with ‘Namo Arihantanam’ which is commonly used by Jains, pointing to the fact that the Lohgad cave is a Jain rock-cut cave. The inscription at Pale caves also begins in a similar manner and based on Sankalia and Gokhale’s study, it was assumed to be a Jain inscription which speaks about spread of Jainism in this region. The newly discovered inscription is 50c m-wide and 40cm-long and is written in six lines.The Lohagad Jain cave is near the fort. The fort has been declared as a protected monument by the government. Geography and Climate Lohagad is part of the Western Ghats. It rises to an elevation of above sea level, and is located to the southwest of the larger Visapur fort. The range divides the basins of the Indrayani river and Pavana lake. Lohagad overlooks the Pavana reservoir, located to the south of the mountain. The hill extends to the northwest to a fortified spur, called Vinchukada (Scorpion's tail) because of its resembling shape. The four large gates of Lohagad are still in good condition and reasonably intact. During the monsoon, the top of the fort is covered with mist and clouds and becomes particularly wet with growing moss. The roads and trails leading to the hill are quite slippery at this time of the year and precautions are necessary to be taken while venturing the routes.

Bruning Collection of Japanese Books and Manuscripts, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University. are Japanese yōkai of pregnant women. They can also be written '. Throughout folk stories and literature the identity and appearance of ubume varies. However, she is most commonly depicted as the spirit of a woman who has died during childbirth. Passersby will see her as a normal looking woman carrying a baby. She will typically try to give the passerby her child then disappear. When the person goes to look at the child in their arms, they discover it is only a bundle of leaves or large rock. The idea that pregnant women who die and get buried become \\"ubume\\" has existed since ancient times; which is why it has been said that when a pregnant woman dies prepartum, one ought to cut the fetus out the abdomen and put it on the mother in a hug as they are buried. In some regions, if the fetus cannot be cut out, a doll would be put beside her.  Variations  An image of ubume as depicted by Toriyama Sekien, an ukiyo-e artist famous for his prints of yokai and obakemono. In the 16th volume, first half of the Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang of the Tang dynasty, volume 462 of the Taiping Guangji of Northern Song dynasty, the \\"night-going leisure woman\\" is a nocturnal strange bird that steals peoples' babies and about it is written, \\"perhaps it is the changed form of what was once someone who died in childbirth\\" (). In Japan, they would often wear a blood-stained koshimaki, embrace children and chase after people who accompany them. They are also mentioned in the Hyakumonogatari Hyōban (\\"They are women who died upon childbirth, and became this due to attachment. In appearance, they are stained with blood below the waist, and they are said to cry out, \\"obareu, obareu\\" ()), the Kii Zōdan Shū (\\"the ubume does not give childbirth, and if only the fetus had life, such a deep delusion of the mother remains, and thus they change to this and embraces a child at night. It's said when the child cries, the ubume does too\\"), the Compendium of Materia Medica, and the Wakan Sansai Zue. The ubume's blood-soaked appearance is thought to be because in feudal society, the continuation of the family was considered important, so pregnant women who died were believed to fall into a hell with a pond of blood. Ubume in Hinoemata, Minamiaizu District and Kaneyama, Ōnuma District, Fukushima Prefecture were called \\"obo\\". It is said that when they encounter someone, they make that person hug a baby and then disappear in peace and the one hugging the baby will have their throat bitten by the baby. It is said that when one encounters an obo, throwing a piece of cloth, such as a string with a billhook attached for men, or a gōkōsō (a type of women's handkerchief), tenugui, or a yumaki (a type of waistcloth) for women, it would divert the obo's attention and create an opportunity to escape. It is also said that if one does end up hugging the baby, hugging the baby with its face facing the other way would result in not being bit. Also, the \\"obo\\" is, like the \\"ubu\\" in \\"ubume\\", originally a dialect term referring to newborns. In Yanaizu, Kawanuma District, there is a legend centered on the \\"obo\\" called the \\"obo hugging Kannon\\". In the Nishimatsuura District, Saga Prefecture and in Miyamachi Miyaji, Aso, Kumamoto Prefecture, they are called \\"ugume\\" and it is said that they appear at night and they would make people embrace a baby a night, but when dawn comes, they would generally be a rock, a stone tower, or a straw beater. (On Goshōra island in Nagasaki Prefecture, also in Kyushu, there is a type of funayūrei called \\"ugume\\".) In the Iki region of Nagasaki Prefecture, they are called \\"unme\\" or \\"uume\\" and they occur when a young person dies or when a woman dies from difficult childbirth, and they would sway back and forth before disappearing, having the appearance of a creepy blue light. Kokakuchō (姑獲鳥, or 夜行遊女, \\"night-going leisure woman\\") from the Wakan Sansai Zue by Terajima Ryōan In Ibaraki Prefecture, there are legends of a yōkai called the \\"ubametori\\" and when children go dry their clothes a night, this ubametori would think of the child as their own, and give some poisonous milk. This has some similarities to a similar wrathful spirit called a kokakuchō and nowadays specialists infer that Ibaraki's ubametori is the same as this kokakuchō, and furthermore, kokakuchō is theorized to be the changed form of a pregnant mother's spirit, so it is said that this mysterious bird is considered the same as ubume. Also, the ubume in Japanese legends is a bird that resembles the gull in appearance and voice and it is said that they would land on the ground and shapeshift into a woman carrying a baby and they would request \\"please hold on to this child\\" to people they meet and those that flee would be cursed with chills and fevers and eventually death. In Iwaki Province, now Fukushima Prefecture and Miyagi Prefecture, it is said that ryūtō (an atmospheric ghost light said to be lit by a dragon spirit) would appear at beaches and try to come up to land, but it is said that this is because an ubume is carrying a ryūtō to the shore. In Kitaazumi District, Nagano Prefecture, ubume are called yagomedori, and they are said to stop at clothes drying at night, and it is said that putting on those clothes would result in dying before one's husband.  Social and cultural influence  The yokai ubume was conceived through various means of social and religious influence. During the late Medieval period of Japan, the attitudes surrounding motherhood started to change. Rather than the infant being considered a replication of the mother and an extension of her body, the fetus started to be seen as separate from the mother. This distancing of mother and fetus caused an emphasis on the paternal ownership of the child, reducing the mother to nothing more than a vessel for male reproduction. For a mother to die in childbirth or late pregnancy soon came to be considered a sin, the blame for the death of the unborn child being placed on the mother who in a sense was responsible for the infant's death (Stone & Walter p. 176). In folklore Originally the name for a kind of small sea fish, in Japanese folklore the term is now applied to the ghost of a woman who had died in childbirth, or \\"birthing woman ghost\\". Typically, the ubume asks a passerby to hold her child for just a moment and disappears when her victim takes the swaddled baby. The baby then becomes increasingly heavy until it is impossible to hold. It is then revealed not to be a human child at all, but a boulder or a stone image of Jizō. Many scholars have associated the ubume with the legend of the hitobashira, where a sacrificial mother and child \\"are buried under one of the supporting pillars of a new bridge.\\" The Shoshin'in Temple, according to scholars, is where local women come to pray to conceive a child or to have a successful pregnancy. According to Stone and Walter (2008), the origins of the temple's legend, set in the mid-16th century, concern: :a modern statue of Ubume, displayed once a year in July. At this festival, candy that has been offered to the image is distributed, and women pray for safe delivery and for abundant milk. The statue, which is clothed in white robes, has only a head, torso, and arms; it has no lower half. In literature Stories about ubume have been told in Japan since at least the 12th century. The early 17th- century tale collection Konjaku hyaku monogatari hyoban says of the ubume: :When a woman loses her life in childbirth, her spiritual attachment (shūjaku) itself becomes this ghost. In form, it is soaked in blood from the waist down and wanders about crying, ‘Be born! Be born!’ (obareu, obareu). Natsuhiko Kyogoku's best-selling detective novel, The Summer of the Ubume, uses the ubume legend as its central motif, creating something of an ubume 'craze at the time of its publication and was made into a major motion picture in 2005. In art Tokugawa-era artists produced many images of ubume, usually represented as \\"naked from the waist up, wearing a red skirt and carrying a small baby.\\" Other illustrations of ubume are from Toriyama Sekien’s late-18th-century encyclopedia of ghosts, goblins, and ghouls, Gazu Hyakki Yagyō.

He withdrew from the Guardsmen when he became disappointed by the new membership's lack of heroic standards. He regarded the Golden Guardsman as his mentor and role model, and after the current Guardsmen were all killed, his guilt at writing them off led him to try to establish a similar mentoring role over the less experienced and powerful heroes all around him. In his secret identity he was the owner of a chain of fitness centers and a former bodybuilding champion. Kris (Golden Guard): Daughter of the original Golden Guardsman, she inherited his superhuman strength and was targeted for murder by her brother, jealous that she had inherited powers and he apparently hadn't. Although she adopted a version of her father's costume early on she took a while to adopt a version of his pseudonym, superheroing for a while just as \\"Kris\\". Sepulchre: Self- confessed murderer of the Guardsmen (by planting bombs in their headquarters), Sepulchre was up until that point regarded as a minor, easily defeated villain. He was later revealed as a knife-wielding serial killer who had never been caught. Sentry: A Batman pastiche, he kept his powers (or lack of same) a secret. Apostate: Growing up apparently without powers, Kris' brother developed a resentment against his father and sister because his father was lavishing attention on his presumed successor as a superhero. He stole his father's helmet, which apparently had electrical powers, and used it to kill the old retired superhero, as well as another randomly encountered hero named Predator; and to try to kill his sister and Victor. He later learned his electrical powers were innate and the helmet simply a psychological crutch. Gemini +: A pair of identical twins who possessed super strength shared between them, and a force field which operated only when they were in close proximity to each other; it was their capture of Sepulchre and the unimpressed reactions of the other heroes to their feat that led to Sepulchre's confession to having killed the Guardsmen. Bob was an obnoxious loudmouth, and his brother Steve apologetic for Bob's behavior. Hover: A telekinetic who lost the use of his legs in action and had to fly to get around out of a wheelchair. Tawny Winters - An empath, her appearance altered to become the perfect woman for everyone who saw her. Gossamer - A woman with the power of intangibility over herself and anyone with whom she has contact. StarCorp Man - Sponsored by a major corporation. Out of ethical concerns, his abilities were linked to an \\"empathic limiter\\" that would cause him to experience pain equal (or at least proportional) to any he inflicted using these granted powers, to encourage restraint. This control method backfired when he began to develop a psychological addiction to the induced sensations.

He also appeared in CBS's Perry Mason and other TV series. He was the grandnephew of South African president Paul Kruger. Early life and education Born in Toledo, Ohio, Kruger was of German descent. He was the son of Bernard Alben Kruger and Elizabeth Winers Kruger and the grandnephew of South African pioneer and president Paul Kruger. Otto was musically trained, but switched careers and became an actor after studying engineering at the University of Michigan. Career Making his Broadway debut in 1915, Kruger quickly became a matinee idol. Though he started to get noticed in the early 1920s, it was the 1930s when his career was at its height. His sound film debut came in Turn Back the Clock (1933) and he made an appearance in the film Chained (1934). Though he played the hero on occasion, for most of his career, he played the main villain or a charming or corrupt businessman. One of his best known roles was in the Douglas Sirk film Magnificent Obsession (1954). Kruger played the supporting role of Judge Percy Mettrick, who unsuccessfully urges Will Kane to leave town in High Noon (1952). Kruger is also remembered for playing the villain Tobin in Alfred Hitchcock's spy film Saboteur (1942) and mob boss Stevens in the film noir 711 Ocean Drive (1950). Kruger in Dracula's Daughter (1936) His television roles included those of Dr. Mumford in the 1959 episode \\"Experiments in Terror\\" of the NBC science fiction/adventure series The Man and the Challenge, as Ben Tully in \\"Gun City\\" of the ABC western series, The Rebel, as Franklyn Malleson Ghentin in the 1961 episode \\"A Fool for a Client\\" of James Whitmore ABC's legal drama, The Law and Mr. Jones, and as Karl in the episode \\"Quite a Woman\\" of the short-lived 1961 CBS series The Investigators starring James Franciscus. Kruger made four guest appearances on CBS's Perry Mason.

In his final appearance, he played Judge Norris in \\"The Case of the Missing Button\\" (1964). Personal life, later years and honors On March 20, 1920, Kruger married Broadway actress Susan \\"Sue\\" MacManamy. Their daughter, Ottilie Kruger (1926–2005), was also an actress and was the first wife of pioneering cinematographer Gayne Rescher. Kruger supported Thomas Dewey in the 1944 United States presidential election. Kruger died at the Motion Picture and Television Country House in Woodland Hills, California, on his 89th birthday. Kruger was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; one for TV and one for film.

He was also a prominent St. Louis aviator and benefactor of aviation. Early life He was son of Jordan W. Lambert, founder of Lambert Pharmaceutical Company which made Listerine. He initially studied at the University of Virginia and became president of the family business in 1896. He became chairman in 1923 and stepped down in 1926 when it was acquired by another firm. Golf At the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, France, Lambert finished eighth in the individual event. Four years later he was part of the American team which won the silver medal, making Lambert the only golfer to have competed in both Olympic golf tournaments. He finished 12th in this competition. In the individual competition he finished eighth in the qualification and was eliminated in the quarter-finals of the match play. Aviation Lambert lifted by a kite at the Forest Park airfield, 1908 In 1906 he became interested in aviation and took ballooning lessons. In 1907 he was one of the founders of the Aero Club of St. Louis. (The Club used \\"military\\" titles; hence Lambert's title \\"Major.\\") He attended the Smith Academy at Washington University in St. Louis In 1909, Lambert met the Wright Brothers, and purchased his first airplane from them. He took flying lessons from Orville Wright, and in 1911 became the first St. Louis resident to hold a pilot's license. During World War I, he served in the Aviation Section of the United States Army Signal Corps, as an instructor in ballooning and parachuting. One of Lambert's first flight instructors was Orville Wright. In 1926, a young Charles Lindbergh visited this home while looking for financial support for his proposed transatlantic flight. Lambert offered financial support to Lindbergh and encouraged others to do the same. In return for this financial support, Lindbergh's plane was named The Spirit of St. Louis. Furthermore, St. Louis' Lambert Airport was later named after Albert Bond Lambert. In 1925, for $68,000, Lambert purchased Kinloch Field of Kinloch, Missouri, a field northwest of St. Louis, which had been used for hot air balloon ascensions and the first international air meet. Lambert, at his own expense, developed the field with runways and hangars. In 1927 he was one of the St. Louis committee of backers of Charles Lindbergh's purchasing of his airplane The Spirit of St. Louis for his epoch-making transatlantic solo trip to Paris. Lindbergh was at the time a resident of St. Louis as well as an airmail pilot flying the mail between St. Louis and Chicago. The following year, 1928, Lambert sold the field to the city of St. Louis for $68,000, the same price he had paid for it before making improvements. St. Louis Lambert International Airport thus became one of the first municipal airports in the nation. Family He was married to Myrtle McGrew, daughter of the George F. McGrews of St. Louis. They had a daughter, Myrtle; and two sons, Albert Bond Jr. and Don L. Lambert.\\"Widow of Pioneer St. Louis Airman, Maj. Lambert, Dies,\\" St. Louis Globe-Democrat, August 23, 1954, image 3 Residence 2 Hortense Place was the Lamberts' home in St. Louis, Missouri. The Albert Bond Lambert House is a red-brick and symmetrical mansion which has a two-story portico with columns. The nearly 12,000 square foot Neoclassical-style home was designed by noted architect George W. Hellmuth and was built between 1902 and 1903. It has 6 bedrooms and 8 bathrooms. Before construction, its cost was estimated to be $45,000 (). This home was constructed just before the 1904 World's Fair. The King of Sweden also visited this house with the fireplace in the solarium apparently being a gift from the king.

Deadlock provisions vary enormously between different countries and with respect to different types of transactions. However, characteristically the format of the provision will be as follows: #Certain \\"key matters\\" will be designated as matters upon which deadlocks can arise. These will usually be fairly fundamental matters relating to the management and control of the business. #The provisions will then indicate if a \\"key matter\\" is raised at a certain number of consecutive meetings (occasionally just one meeting, but more often two or three) of the board of directors or other management organ of the business, a deadlock is said to have arisen. #The two parties may then be asked to summarise their differences in writing, and ordinarily senior personnel on either side will meet to try to find an amicable resolution to the deadlock. The provisions may require that a mediator may or shall be involved. #If the parties fail to find an amicable solution, then the termination provisions will normally operate. The main focus of most deadlock provisions are the termination provisions. The principle underlying them is that a successful business enterprise should not be destroyed solely because the two partners are unable to agree on a core issue; the value of the business as a going concern should be preserved, and a fair way should be found to allow one party to bow out with fair recompense for giving up their share in the venture. There are as many different types of termination provisions as the ingenuity of lawyers can create. However, a number of specific types of termination provisions have come to be used fairly regularly in commercial transactions where the parties are of equal standing in the venture, and have acquired characteristically descriptive names. *Russian roulette. A draconian solution to a deadlock, a Russian roulette provision requires one of the two deadlocked parties to serve a notice on the other party, and the serving party will name an all-cash price at which it values a half interest in the business. The party receiving the notice then has the option to either buy the other party out, or sell out to the other party, at that price. *Texas shoot-out. Another dramatic solution to a deadlock, a Texas shoot-out involves each party sending a sealed all-cash bid to an umpire stating the price at which they are willing to buy out the other party. The sealed bids are opened together, and the highest sealed bid \\"wins\\", and that bidder must then buy (and the \\"loser\\" must sell) the other half share in the business. *Mexican shoot-out (also called 'Dutch auction). A variation on the Texas shoot-out (and slightly different from the traditional Dutch auction), the parties send in sealed bids indicating the minimum price that they would be prepared to sell their half share for. Whichever sealed bid is the higher \\"wins\\" and that bidder then buys the \\"loser's\\" share at the price indicated in the loser's sealed bid. *Multi-choice procedure. A softer option, when the parties do not wish to commit themselves to a more dramatic termination procedure, the deadlock can often provide for a series of options, one of which the parties must agree on, if the deadlock cannot be resolved. The benefit of an open textured clause like this is that, when faced with the draconian consequences of the next step, the parties are thought to be better able to compromise. The downside is that if the parties are truly at loggerheads, it usually requires a third party adjudicator (often an arbitrator) to impose one of the options upon them. *Cooling-off/Mediation. Not strictly a termination provision at all, many deadlock provisions 'end' by providing that the parties shall mediate until a solution is found (sometimes providing that if they cannot mediate out, the mediator will make a determination of reasonableness, which can then have knock-on effects under the contract). Whilst sounding like a 'soft' option, such clauses often represent the judgment of Solomon, as if the parties are unable to mediate the dispute out, then usually the enterprise will be dissolved. *Deterrence approach. Often the termination clause in deadlock provisions provides a punitive element for the party initiating the deadlock procedure. In those clauses, a deadlock is only said to arise when one party serves a notice on the other indicating that a deadlock has arisen (instead of a failure to resolve on a key matter at a certain number of meetings). The provisions will then provide for the determination of the \\"fair market value\\" of a half share in the business, usually by having it valued by an expert or auditor (or sometimes both in consultation). Once the valuation is made, the party who served the notice must either (a) buy all the other party's share in the business at 125% of the fair price, or (b) sell its share to the other party at 75% of the fair price. The downside to such clauses is that deadlocks rarely get resolved, and can lead to the business being paralysed by indecision. Often the drafting of the deadlock provisions will depend to a great extent upon what the \\"key issues\\" that the parties want to ensure consensus upon are.

The ancient parish of Harrow on the Hill, or simply Harrow, was one of the largest parishes in Middlesex. Apart from Harrow Town, it encompassed a number of smaller settlements, including Roxeth itself, Greenhill, Harrow Weald, Kenton, Preston, Uxendon, Tokyngton, Sudbury, Wembley and Alperton. Roxeth village was adjacent to Harrow on the Hill, along the main road to the south. The name Roxeth is thought to derive from a contraction of 'Rooks Heath' and much of the land between Roxeth and Sudbury was indeed heathland as far as the early 19th century. A mediaeval moated manor existed until the mid-20th century. On its site stands a council housing estate. Development around the crossroads at the bottom of Harrow on the Hill, an area known as Roxeth Corner, was under way in the early 19th century, using brick from the nearby brickworks in Lower Road. A Wesleyan Chapel was built soon after 1817 on London Hill (now called Roxeth Hill). In 1864, the Wesleyans moved to a new larger chapel in Lower Road, which has since become the Welsh Congregational Chapel. By 1880, the former Wesleyan chapel had been converted to an elementary school which it remained until at least the 1930s. Christ Church on Roxeth Hill, which was built in 1862 by the celebrated architect George Gilbert Scott as a chapel of ease to St Mary's Harrow on the Hill, has cemetery records that begin in 1863 and go on till at least 1942. In 1906, the stone was laid for a Salvation Army Hall (presently vacant) on Roxeth Hill, adjacent to the Half Moon Pub which was there since at least 1880. South Harrow and Roxeth railway station, on the Marylebone to High Wycombe mainline, was opened in 1926 at the far end of the village and renamed Northolt Park Station in 1929.Northolt - Introduction British History Online Roxeth is now also served by South Harrow tube station. The name of the parish lives on as a current Ward of the London Borough of Harrow and in local schools, Roxeth First and Middle Schools as well as Rooks Heath College (formerly known as Rooks Heath High School and, before that, Roxeth Manor Secondary School for Boys and Roxeth Manor Secondary School for Girls), as well as in the name of the parish church, Christ Church Roxeth. Roxonian Football Club was formed in 1933. It is now called Harrow Borough F.C. and plays at Earlsmead Stadium on the west side of Roxeth, on former common land known as Dobbs Field.

It is located along the border with the city of Rivera, Uruguay, forming together an international city of almost 170,000 inhabitants. In 2009, the city was officially declared by the Brazilian government as the symbolic city of Brazilian integration with the Mercosur member states.  History  The first known occupants of the region of the current municipality were the charrúa and minuane indigenous. Then came Spanish Jesuits, then throughout the 19th century came Portuguese and Italian immigrants. In 1810, the political instability that would lead to the independence of the Spanish colonies in the Platina Basin led to the arrival of Portuguese troops to the region, in order take advantage of the opportunity and extend their empire in areas of temperate weather so coveted by them. These troops, commanded by Diogo de Sousa, Count of Rio Pardo, began the present city of Santana do Livramento, through the construction of a chapel dedicated to the homonymous saint. The permanent Portuguese settlement of the region began with the donation of sesmarias made by the Marquês of Alegrete in 1814. Founded the city on July 30, 1823, it was elevated to the category of municipality in 1857, emancipating itself from Alegrete. Santana do Livramento is located on the Brazilian border with Uruguay; on the other side of the dry divide (an urban street), is the Uruguayan city of Rivera. It is one of the oldest municipalities, and the second largest in the territorial extension of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. It went through periods of great prosperity, when large woolen mills, refrigerators, social organizations and soccer clubs were emerging. Slowly, the economy has been fading, for many reasons, among which can be cited: isolation (distance from other expressive economic centers), centralist vision (in politics, industry, commerce, territorial organization), economic option agriculture and trade, without emphasis on the development of industry, which plays the role of \\"bridge\\" between the aforementioned activities. Livramento records more than 100 kilometers of dry border with Uruguay. In 1912, the city started to have the first train station in Brazil with international traffic, between Santana do Livramento and Rivera, Uruguay, making trains connect Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo to Montevideo and Buenos Aires. Currently, the International Train is disabled. The area of the municipality located between the Quaraí River and the Arroio Invernada (called the Rincão de Artigas) has been claimed by the government of Uruguay since 1934.  Overview  Obelisk of the International Square, at the Fronteira da Paz, cities of Santana do Livramento (Brazil) and Rivera (Uruguay) It is 208 meters above sea level, and is from its capital city (Porto Alegre). The population in 2010 was 82,513 inhabitants in an area of . Santana do Livramento was founded on July 30, 1823 and in 1857 was emancipated from Alegrete as a city.

The two main wineries are Almaden and Santa Colina. Many tourists come to Livramento to visit the duty-free shops in its neighboring city Rivera. Rural tourism is also an attractive option in Santana do Livramento. Events: * International kite fair; * 20 September day, when the gaúchos commemorate the Ragamuffin War; * Festival of lamb and wine. Ibirapuitã Park, on BR 293, lies about ten kilometers from the city. The border community is unusual in that the two cities maintain an open border without any physical border barriers. Inhabitants from both Livramento (Brazil) and Rivera (Uruguay) are free to move anywhere throughout the twin city community. It is easy for one to get lost in the suburbs and not know whether they are in Brazil or Uruguay. Travellers crossing the border here and proceeding further into the other country are required to complete border formalities at an integrated border control post located at Siñeriz Shopping in Rivera. The integrated border control post housing the immigration and customs offices of both countries was inaugurated on 28 December 2016. Previously, travellers had to visit various offices located in different parts of the twin cities.  Religion  The majority of the population declares themselves Roman Catholic.

It is located in the northwest direction of the Janjira fort at a distance of about 4 km. During cleanup activities in 2012, ASI authorities found around 250 cannonballs of historical value. The sea fort of Padmadurg is not as big as Janjira but still the fort can be visited and enjoyed. Visiting the fort requires taking permission from the Customs/Navy. The fort was not only a part of Sindhudurg's defenses but was also Shivaji Maharaj's main ship construction yard. This fort can also be viewed from Janjira. There was a belt of land from Dandi seashore to Padmadurga but it got blown away under the water in 2004. This fort can be accessed by boats. Boats are mainly available from Murud-Koliwada. Restoration The fort is included in the protected monuments list of Archaeological Survey of India, but as on 2011, the fort and the area is in neglected state and ASI is unable take restoration work for want of resources. During cleanup activities in 2012, ASI authorities found around 250 cannonballs of historical value.

The rock, on which the fort was built, was called Kasa and the fort was named Padmadurg. The fort has six bastions. The fort lay between the Sindhudurga and the coast, and featured a dry dock - a narrow tongue of water between two rock walls. It is also said that there was an underground way to sindhudurga fort. There are no direct boat fares to the fort as a result of which the visitors have to hire a personal boat.

He appeared in many plays during his childhood. In his early teens he combined his technical skill and expressed desire to pursue his strong artistic inclination, setting out to prove that the two could be successfully blended. In 1936 he was called upon to assist in the history-making telecast of the Berlin Olympic Games. In 1937 Klaus was appointed laboratory engineer and assistant to Dr. Arthur Korn, the inventor of picture telegraphy. During this association, Landsberg himself created many new electronic devices. The most outstanding of these achievements was the invention of an electronic aid to navigation and blind landings, considered so vital to the Third Reich that upon being patented was declared a military secret, which Landsberg was determined to destroy as a Nazi weapon (he was successful). This basic radar principle later became Landsberg's passport to America. Following his arrival in the US, Farnsworth Television, Inc. hired Klaus Landsberg as Television Development Engineer in Philadelphia in 1938. In 1939 he went to New York for the National Broadcasting Company television division. During this period, Landsberg helped NBC make possible the first public demonstrations of electronic television in America, at the April 30, 1939 opening of the New York World's Fair. Allen B. DuMont recognized Landsberg's qualifications, and signed him as television design and development engineer for the New York-based DuMont Laboratories, a pioneer United States television organization. There he supervised technical operations of the television unit at the U.S. Army Maneuvers in Cantons, New York, developing automatic synchronizing circuits. In 1939 he was contracted to build DuMont's station WABD, as well as produce the station's first shows. In 1941 Klaus was sent by Paramount Pictures to Los Angeles to build W6XYZ, an experimental television station. He ran the experimental station from 1942 to 1947, during which time he produced Paramount's first kinescope. Also in 1947, KTLA (Channel 5), a Los Angeles Television station funded by Paramount and helmed by Klaus Landsberg, began regular commercial broadcasts, with the first such KTLA commercial broadcast was January 22, 1947, hosted by Bob Hope. By 1948, KTLA boasted a show lineup that included Spade Cooley, The Ina Ray Hutton Show, The Continental Lover, Time for Beany, Korla Pandit's Adventures in Music and Hollywood Wrestling. Landsberg died of cancer in 1956 in Los Angeles.

Africa is represented by a naked man holding a spear, Asia by a horse and a mosque-like building, Europe by a woman with a horse and a church-like building, and America by a man with a dog at his feet. The front of the building as it can be seen today (in a restored state), was not an original feature of the building - it was later added by Robert Sparrowe between 1660 and 1670. It bears the Royal Arms of King Charles II, and the words \\"honi soit qvi mal y pense\\". This is Old French for \\"shame upon him who thinks evil of it\\", and is also the motto of the Order of the Garter. Pargeting Images showing the four discovered continents represented in pargeting.

In the 16th century the house was owned by a string of local merchants, including George Copping, a draper and fishmonger, who acquired the property in 1567. It was Copping who commissioned the panelling of the ground-floor room at the front of the house. He also built the 'long gallery'. The Sparrowe family became the owners of the house in 1603, and continued ownership for the next 300 years. They promoted a tradition that a hidden room in the house, fitted up as a secret place of worship for Catholics in the time of the Civil Wars, served Charles II as a hiding place while he was in flight after being defeated at the Battle of Worcester.Clarke G. R. (1830) \\"The history and description of the town and borough of Ipswich\\", pp. 211-213. Retrieved 1 October 2019. The tradition is unlikely to be true, since Ipswich is over 100 miles away from any location Charles is known to have visited.\\"The Monarch's Way Route\\". Retrieved 1 October 2019 Today The Ancient House is currently owned by Ipswich Borough Council with Lakeland being the main tenant. There is also a small art gallery in the attic, which houses occasional exhibitions. Restoration The condition of the house by 1979 was so bad that it was in danger of collapsing. The foundations had sunk, among other structural problems. In addition to this, woodworm and dry and wet rot had set in, and the deathwatch beetle was rife. Renovation began in 1984, and no part of the building was untouched. Foundations were underpinned, the rot & infestations were eradicated, floors were strengthened, plasterwork was restored, windows were releaded and features were exposed. The renovation was not without its problems: the foundations had sunk, but the heavy fireplaces had sunk at a different rate. * List of Grade I listed buildings in Ipswich References *Material in the museum section of the building * External links Category:Houses completed in the 15th century Category:Houses in Suffolk Category:Grade I listed buildings in Ipswich Category:Grade I listed houses Category:Buildings and structures in Suffolk Category:Timber framed buildings in Suffolk ","title":"Ancient House, Ipswich"},{"id":"5816098","text":"is a Japanese voice actress.

Due to his proclaimed \\"battle against corruption\\", he became one of the more popular, but also polarizing, politicians in Poland. His uncompromising approach and publicized prosecutions earned him the title Man of the year 2006, awarded by Wprost magazine. However, some of his policies were repeatedly characterized as partisan and overzealous by local and international press, including The Economist.Bad habits, The Economist, September 27, 2007Squeaky if not clean, The Economist, September 6, 2007 In 2007, former Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration Janusz Kaczmarek, allegedly linked to the Andrzej Lepper bribery case, was forced to resign.

In a media confrontation with vice-PM Andrzej Lepper, Ziobro revealed that he had secretly recorded a conversation with Lepper.

In February 2016 he became Prosecutor General as well, which is result of new law unifying both positions.

Political views Ziobro is against Istanbul Convention, In July 2020 Ziobro declared he will begin preparing the formal process to withdraw from the treaty. He said that the treaty is harmful because it requires that schools teach children about gender in an ideological way and de-emphasizes biological sex. In 2012, when in opposition, Ziobro had referred to the treaty as \\"an invention, a feminist creation aimed at justifying gay ideology\\". Ziobro is also against same sex marriage, with him saying in 2020 that it would be unacceptable for the European Union to force Poland to legalize gay marriage so it can get EU financial aid.

Her uncle, Mark DeWolfe Howe taught constitutional law at Harvard and was Oliver Wendell Holmes’ law clerk and biographer. Her aunt, Helen Howe, was a successful monologist and novelist. Howe's family placed an emphasis on its members' reading and writing: \\"Thanksgivings and family occasions were always about, 'What are you reading, what are you writing, what are you working on, what poetry are you interested in?'\\" When Howe was ill with hepatitis, her father visited her every day in the hospital, reading James Joyce's Ulysses to her during his lunch break.\\"Theater.

Biography  Crimea at the time of Mengli Girai Struggle for power (1466–1478) 1466–1478 is abstracted from the Russian Wikipedia, there apparently being no good source in English. It took Mengli twelve years to establish himself as khan. When Haji Girai died power went to his eldest son Nur Devlet. Mengli revolted. He was supported by the Crimean nobility while Nur Devlet was supported by the Great Horde. In 1467 Mengli occupied the capital of Kyrk-Er (Chufut-Kale) but was soon driven out by Nur Devlet and fled to the Genoese at Kaffa. In June 1468 a delegation of nobles elected him khan at Kaffa. He, the nobles and a Genoese detachment marched on the capital. After six months Nur Devlet was expelled and fled to the North Caucasus, but was captured and imprisoned in the Genoese fortress at Sudak. Second reign 1469–1475 He made an anti-Turkish alliance with Principality of Theodoro. In the summer of 1469 a Turkish fleet burned some villages near Kaffa. From late 1473 Eminek made himself head of the Shirin clan which held the eastern peninsula of Crimea. He became the second most powerful man in the country and was often hostile to Mengli. In March 1475 the nobles replaced Mengli with his elder brother Hayder of Crimea. Mengli fled to Kaffa. In May 1475 a large Turkish fleet arrived at Kaffa seeking to subordinate the Genoese. They took Kaffa and other Genoese forts and the Principality of Theodoro. Mengli, who had supported the Genoese, was captured and taken to Constantinople. Nur Devlet was released from prison and restored as a Turkish vassal. Nur Devlet’s third reign (1475-78) was unsuccessful. In the winter of 1477/78 Crimea was briefly conquered by Janibeg, a nephew of Akhmed Khan of the Great Horde. Eminek wrote to the sultan asking that Mengli be restored. In the spring of 1478 Mengli was released and arrived at Crimea with a Turkish fleet and Turkish soldiers. He was joined by Eminek’s troops, Nur Devlet was driven out and Mengli became khan as a Turkish vassal. Third reign (1478–1515) He made a great contribution to the development of Crimean Tatar statehood. He founded the fortress of Özü.René Grousset, L’Empire des steppes, Attila, Gengis-Khan, Tamerlan, Payot, Paris In 1480, Meñli entered into a treaty of alliance with Ivan III, Grand Duke of Muscovy. The alliance was directed against Poland-Lithuania, the Great Horde and the Khanate of Astrakhan. This was an important factor in the Great stand on the Ugra river which led to Russian independence from the Great Horde. In 1502, Meñli defeated the last khan of the Golden Horde and took control over its capital, Saray. He proclaimed himself Khagan (Emperor), claiming legitimacy as the successor of the Golden Horde's authority over the Tatar khaganates in the Caspian-Volga region. Meñli was buried in the Dürbe (or türbe) of Salaçıq in Bakhchysarai. In that city, he commissioned Zıncırlı Medrese (medrese with chains) in Salaçıq (1500), Dürbe in Salaçıq (1501), and \\"Demir Qapı\\" (Iron Gate) portal in the Bakhchisaray Palace (by Aloisio the New) (1503). Meñli often depended on troops from the Crimea's numerous Italian trading cities, and Genoese mercenaries formed a significant part of his army. For his raids on Lithuania see Crimean-Nogai Raids for 1480–1511.

In Jarosław Kaczyński's government he was a deputy minister of national education. Biography Orzechowski promotes strong anti-homosexual views, being (together with Roman Giertych) a proponent of legislation banning any form of broadly defined promotion of homosexuality and other deviations in schools under threat of severe punishment - including imprisonment. He also actively pursues legislation banning any identified homosexual person from working with children in public education institutions of any level. He publicly confirmed his intentions of sacking any homosexual teacher during numerous interviews in Polish media on March 15, 2007, with the strongest statement being aired by Radio Tok FM. Orzechowski holds the theory of evolution to be false and wants to introduce teaching of creationism in schools.Wiceminister edukacji: Poradzimy sobie bez tolerancji, Gazeta Wyborcza, October 14, 2006 This led 1,135 Polish scientists to demand his dismissal as deputy minister of education.Pełna lista sygnatariuszy listu naukowców polskich do premiera, Gazeta Wyborcza, December 4, 2006 On 25 March 2008, in an interview with TVN24, he publicly proposed the idea of prohibiting sex before the age of 18 and was supported by Ewa Sowińska in this matter. The idea was dropped from the debate after massive criticism. In June 2008 he wrote a letter to the President of Poland Lech Kaczyński, calling for revoking Polish citizenship of soccer players taking part in matches against the Polish National Team. However, pursuant to Article 34 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, Poles cannot lose their citizenship without their consent. When this was brought to his attention, he proposed to change the constitution so that playing in the national football team of any other country would be interpreted as an act of voluntarily abandoning Polish citizenship.Gazeta Wyborcza, Orzechowski chce teraz zmian w konstytucji, 2008-06-17 The background of this proposal was Poland's defeat against Germany in the European Football Championship 2008. Lukas Podolski, whose family had left Poland when he was two and who never formally lost Polish citizenship, had scored both goals in this match. Orzechowski ran for the Senate in the Krosno constituency by-election on 22 June 2008 but failed to gain enough votes. On 6 March 2009 he had been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. On 14 July 2009 he pleaded guilty to the charge and, subject to a plea agreement, he was ordered to pay a 5000 PLN fine, donate 500 PLN to a car accident relief charity and banned from driving any vehicles for three years.Orzechowski bez prawa jazdy, rp.pl z 14 lipca 2009 See also *Members of Polish Sejm 2005-2007 References External links *Poradzimy sobie bez tolerancji, interview with Orzechowski by Gazeta Wyborcza in October 2006; English translation Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Łódź Category:Members of the Polish Sejm 2005–2007 Category:League of Polish Families politicians Category:Christian creationists Category:21st- century Polish criminals Category:Polish Roman Catholics Category:Councillors in Łódź ","title":"Mirosław Orzechowski"},{"id":"5816254","title":"New Providence station"},{"id":"5816255","text":"Alsophila coactilis, synonym Cyathea coactilis, is a rare species of tree fern known only from the southern highlands of Papua New Guinea, where it grows in alpine shrubland at an altitude of about 3000 m.

The scheme consists of a 32-storey tower called St Paul's Tower, which is primarily faced with glass, along with a 9-storey block called St Paul's View, which is primarily faced with glass, sandstone and bronze. They are linked at the bottom by one floor of retail space and a roof terrace atop the retail building. It fronts onto two new squares, Millennium Square and St Paul's Place, part of a new bar and restaurant district. The towers and associated squares form part of the St Paul's Place development, which also includes three other office blocks, a multi-storey car park and a casino, and faces onto Hallam Square, less than from Sheffield railway station. They represent just one element of the wider regeneration of the area around Sheffield Town Hall, known as the Heart of the City Project. The tower became the tallest building in Sheffield when completed in August 2010, at , overtaking the Arts Tower by , although the base of the Arts Tower is approximately higher above sea level than the base of St Paul's tower, meaning the roof of the Arts Tower is still higher by around than the roof of St Paul's tower. The tower and its smaller neighbour provide private apartments for city centre living, with retail on the ground- floor of the tower, facing Arundel Gate, and restaurants on the upper-ground floor of St Paul's View, facing St Paul's Place. Development Planning permission for the project was first granted in October 2005, with excavation work beginning in May 2006 and construction officially commencing in May 2007. The construction process of the development was originally due to be completed by late 2008. The development includes a total of 316 one- and two-bedroom apartments located in two linked towers of 32 and 9 storeys. The project's design is conservatively modern, complementing the surrounding buildings such as the adjacent Grade I listed Town Hall and the modern Winter Garden. According to the official website for the project: Collapse of City Lofts Group Plc On 4 July 2008, it was announced that the company leading this project, City Lofts Group Plc, had gone into administration. The insolvency followed from a series of large financial losses, spiralling lending costs and falling property market values. Although construction at St Paul's tower was not immediately affected, a number of completed developments were placed under the control of the administrators (Ernst & Young). Cladding controversy On 3 October 2008, the BBC Look North news programme reported that the exterior cladding for the main tower had been significantly changed due to costs and was causing concern amongst Sheffield City Council planning officials – and the wider public. Two well-known websites that had been following the construction of the tower reported that the council was calling a halt to any more cladding being placed on the building pending a decision as to whether the new design complied with the original plans.See \\"St Paul's tower cladding?? Have read the council aren't happy -and neither am I!\\". Sheffield Forum A revised set of design plans was drafted before being finally approved in December 2008. The new plans removed or modified certain features of the build, such as the removal of the spire and increased thickness of the window frames.

Borden's father had made a fortune in Colorado silver mining, but the family was unrelated to the Borden Condensed Milk Company—an advantage for Borden since if asked about his wealth, he could honestly reply that his family was often mistaken for \\"the rich Condensed Milk firm that bears the name of Borden.\\"Mary Geraldine Guinness (Mrs. Howard) Taylor, Borden of Yale '09 (Philadelphia: China Inland Mission, 1927), 256. Borden's mother was born in Detroit on August 31, 1861, to John Talman Whiting and Mary Sophia Hill. His father was born in August 1850, and his parents were married on December 28, 1882. Wikitree.com. Borden had three siblings: John (1884-1961),Fort Scott Tribune, July 29, 1961. John Borden, a lawyer and businessman, became the father-in-law of presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson. Joyce (1897-1971), and novelist and poet Mary Borden Spears (1886-1968). After his mother converted to evangelical Christianity in 1894, she took Borden to Chicago Avenue Church, later Moody Church, where he responded to the gospel preaching of R. A. Torrey. From that juncture, prayer and Bible study became hallmarks of his life. After he graduated from The Hill School, Pottstown, Pennsylvania, at age 16, his parents gave him the gift of a chaperoned trip around the world, during which he first developed a desire to become a foreign missionary.Taylor, 35, 47, 70, 75-76. Borden visited Japan, China (where he survived typhoid fever), India, Egypt, Palestine, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Switzerland (where he developed a love of mountain climbing), France, and England. In London, once again under the preaching of Torrey who was holding meetings there, Borden surrendered his life for Christian service.Taylor, 82. Yale Borden entered Yale University in 1905, and with the encouragement of young classics tutor Henry Burt Wright, Borden began daily prayer groups that within two years reached the entire university from the freshman class to the senior.Taylor, 97-98. Borden noted that one voluntary meeting, held in Dwight Hall in 1906, perhaps 500 students, some of them standing, heard a sermon by Robert Elliott Speer, who was secretary of the American Presbyterian Mission and an authority on world missions. At a 1906 Student Volunteer Movement convention in Nashville, Samuel Marinus Zwemer, \\"a man with a map,\\" impressed Borden with his emphasis on the open doors for evangelizing the Muslim world.Taylor, 106-08. Borden had a charismatic personality, was sociable, athletic, and fun loving but also was an intense and hardworking natural leader. At Yale, he was elected president of Phi Beta Kappa and was active in several collegiate sports, especially wrestling and crew. He also became the master of his own sailing yacht. Borden refused to join a fraternity fearing \\"it might set him apart from the body of the class,\\" but he was elected to the Elihu society.Taylor, 143, 145, 148-49, 157. Though an opponent of liberal Christianity, Borden was ecumenical in spirit. With his own money, he funded a New Haven rescue mission and there did personal work himself. One well-traveled English visitor, when asked what had most impressed him about America, is said to have replied, \\"The sight of that young millionaire kneeling with his arm around a 'bum' in the Yale Hope Mission.\\"Taylor, 223. Brief career After graduating from Yale in 1909, Borden attended Princeton Theological Seminary before graduating in 1912. Professor Charles R. Erdman wrote that no other student had exerted a greater personal influence over him than Borden. \\"His judgment was so unerring and so mature that I always forgot there was such a difference in our ages. His complete consecration and devotion to Christ were a revelation to me, and his confidence in prayer a continual inspiration.\\"Taylor, 177. Meanwhile, Borden's reputation was such that he became a board member of the National Bible Institute in New York City and at one point temporarily took charge of the whole ministry, including office management, oversight of student practical training, and the operations of four rescue missions.Taylor, 196. He also became a director of Moody Bible Institute and, at age 22, a member of the North American Council of the China Inland Mission. (He was asked to withdraw from the meeting when the Council officially passed on his own fitness to become a probationer of the Mission.)Taylor, 180-81. Borden's intention was to become a missionary to Uyghur Muslims in northwestern China, but he decided first to study Islam and Arabic in Cairo, boarding with a Syrian family there so that he would hear Arabic spoken as much as possible. He also spent time distributing on the streets Christian sermons written in a Koranic style.Taylor, 241-42. In March 1913, he contracted cerebral meningitis and died a few weeks later. He was 25. Ironically, his mother had just arrived from America to vacation with him in the mountains of Lebanon, and she was present for the simple funeral in which Samuel Zwemer participated. Borden is buried in the American Cemetery in Cairo. On his grave were inscribed words suggested by Charles Erdman: \\"Apart from faith in Christ, there is no explanation of such a life.\\"Taylor, 275. Borden's full epitaph reads: \\"A man in Christ/He arose and forsook all and followed Him,/Kindly affectioned with brotherly love,/Fervent in spirit serving the Lord,/Rejoicing in hope,/Patient in tribulation,/Instant in prayer,/Communicating to the necessity of saints,/In honour preferring others./Apart from faith in Christ,/There is no explanation for such a life.\\" Memorial services were conducted for Borden at Princeton University and at a little African Methodist church where Borden had taught Sunday school for two years. Other services were held at Yale Hope Mission, at Moody Church, at Marble Collegiate Church in New York, and in Japan, Korea, India and South Africa.Taylor, 266-72.

Later he was said to have written \\"No Retreat,\\" after his father supposedly told him that he would never hold a position in the family business. Finally, shortly before he died in Egypt, he is supposed to have added the phrase \\"No Regrets.\\" There is no evidence for the historicity of this anecdote.

By 1890 the Port was exporting 33.2 % of the national production, compared with 21.2% exported from San Juan.\\"Aida Belen Rivera Ruiz, Certifying Official, and Juan Llanes Santos, Preparer, Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office.

The Port of San Juan became Puerto Rico's main shipping port during this time, experiencing significant expansion projects and heavy traffic year-round, while the Port of Ponce was left to handle mostly local operations.

The administration of the Port of Ponce was to also administer the Port of the Americas. Today Today the port seeks to position itself into the international shipping hub. The city continues to search how to best make use of its port's potential, and various business models have been studied. Some have met with strong opposition from San Juan, as was the case in 2003, when there was significant opposition from the International Longshoremen's Association there to moving freight traffic from the San Juan port to the Port of the Americas.ILA seeks new options in San Juan port planning.

By then Puerto Rico's economy was highly dependent on an export manufacturing industry, which in turn relied on substantial federal and commonwealth government tax subsidies. Political and business leaders alike agreed that, in order to secure Puerto Rico's economic future, the island had to diversify its economy and improve its attractiveness towards manufacturers and similar businesses since it could not rely solely on tax benefits. Therefore, the government decided to invest heavily in developing tourism areas, such as new passenger cruise ship terminals at the San Juan Port, and to initiate plans to convert Puerto Rico into the leading manufacturing and shipping location in the Caribbean. During the late 1990s, the megaport project obtained significant support when the US federal government decided to phase out most of the federal tax subsidies awarded to manufacturing companies in Puerto Rico, and after the neighboring countries of Jamaica and the Dominican Republic announced plans to create megaports of their own. A new quay crane was installed as part of the port expansion project in 2005. Potential locations The Government of the Commonwealth soon began researching the viability of a megaport in Puerto Rico by conducting land studies throughout the island, economic studies both in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, and visiting existing megaports, such as the Port of Singapore and the Port of Rotterdam, in order obtain an idea of a megaport's operations and impact on local economies. These studies revealed the need for a large transshipment port in the Caribbean region to facilitate distribution from the emerging markets in Asia and the US west coast to the eastern coasts of North, Central and South America. The government also found that Puerto Rico had several advantages over its Caribbean competitors, which included first-class infrastructure (such as highways and several airports), strong economic and political ties with the United States, and the island's close proximity to the Mona Passage (a large and deep channel between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic through which most ships sail when traveling between the Panama Canal and the US eastern coast). During this research stage, three potential locations were considered for the megaport * San Juan Port – This consideration contemplated moving most local shipping operations to other ports on the island and expanding the Port of San Juan into an international megaport. * Ponce/Guayanilla/Peñuelas Port – This option contemplated leaving most local operations in San Juan, while converting the Port of Ponce into an international megaport with additional port facilities in the nearby towns of Guayanilla and Peñuelas. * Roosevelt Roads (RR) Port – This possible location came into consideration after the US Navy closed its Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in the town of Ceiba. The naval station had adequate piers and quay side, a small airport, and large sections of undeveloped lands. The plan envisioned leaving local operations in San Juan and other local ports while expanding the naval station's port facilities into a megaport. This option was complicated by the fact that the area was not under the jurisdiction of either the Ceiba municipal government or the government of the Commonwealth, but under that of the U.S. federal government, and would have required either a land concession or a low-cost sale to make the option viable. Ponce chosen Ponce mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago lobbied heavily for the location of the megaport to be in his hometown of Ponce before his untimely death in early 2004. He argued that Ponce already included adequate port facilities, a nearby airport, sufficient road and highway infrastructure, and the availability of approximately adjacent to the port area for immediate development. Expanding the San Juan Port became unattractive as it had run out of land area for any further expansion, while locating the mega port in Guayanilla was abandoned because of environmental concerns in the area.Obstacles to Sustainability in the Development of the Port of the Americas, Ponce, Puerto Rico.

Signs and symptoms FLD produces rapidly progressive weakness of tongue, face and pharyngeal muscles in a clinical pattern similar to myasthenia. Neuromuscular transmission may be abnormal in these muscles because of rapid denervation and immature reinnervation. Paralysis occurs secondary to degeneration of the motor neurons of the brain stem. It causes progressive bulbar paralysis due to involvement of motor neurons of the cranial nerve nuclei. The most frequent symptoms at onset of progressive bulbar paralysis of childhood has been a unilateral facial paralysis. It is followed in frequency by dysarthria due to facial weakness or by dysphagia. Palatal weakness and palpebral ptosis also have been reported in few patients. Both sexes can be affected. Genetics Fazio–Londe disease is linked to a genetic mutation in the SLC52A3 gene on chromosome 20 (locus: 20p13). It is allelic and phenotypically similar to Brown–Vialetto–Van Laere syndrome. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The gene encodes the intestinal riboflavin transporter (hRFT2). Diagnosis Symptoms of Fazio- Londe include bulbar palsy, hearing loss, facial weakness, and difficulty breathing. The disease is caused by mutations in the SLC52A2 gene and the SLC52A1 (GPR172B) genes which code for hRFT3 and hRFT1, human riboflavin transporters. Only muscle biopsy and examination of the transporter genes is considered to provide a definitive diagnosis. However, because the disease is so often fatal without treatment, and because the treatment is so inexpensive and with little risk, it is recommended that if the disease is suspected that riboflavin therapy be started immediately while testing is in progress. Treatment The condition is treatable. High doses of oral riboflavin 5 phosphate may work. If that didn't work sublingual FAD may work. Prognosis Onset of first symptom has been reported between 1–12 years, with a mean age of onset at 8 years. Clinical course can be divided into early (< 6 yrs age, predominance of respiratory symptoms) and late course (6–20 years of age, predominance of motor symptoms on superior limbs). Progression to involve other cranial nerve muscles occurs over a period of months or years. In the Gomez review facial nerve was affected in all cases while hypoglossal nerve was involved in all except one case. Other cranial nerves involved were vagus, trigeminal, spinal accessory nerve, abducent, occulomotor and glossopharyngeal in this order. Corticospinal tract signs were found in 2 of the 14 patients. The disease may progress to patient's death in a period as short as 9 months or may have a slow evolution or may show plateaus. Post mortem examination of cases have found depletion of nerve cells in the nuclei of cranial nerves. The histologic alterations found in patient with Fazio–Londe disease were identical to those seen in infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy. Strength may improve with administration of cholinesterase inhibitors.

Preparation Pearl powder is made from freshwater pearls or saltwater pearls below jewellery grade. These are sterilised in boiling water and then milled into a fine powder using stainless steel grinding discs or by milling with small porcelain balls in moist conditions. The powder is sold as such or mixed into creams. Cosmetic uses Pearl powder is widely believed to help improve the appearance of the skin, and is used as a cosmetic by royal families in Asia.Jamie Ott, \\"Pearl powder: Eat it, wear it, brush your teeth with it\\", examiner.com, March 10, 2011 It is also used as a treatment for acne. Some studies have claimed that pearl powder can stimulate the skin's fibroblasts, help regenerate collagen, and accelerate healing of certain skin conditions, wounds, and burns. Medical uses Pearl powder contains a number of amino acids, over 30 trace minerals, and a high concentration of calcium. In Chinese medicine, it is used as an anti-inflammatory and detoxification agent, and as a relaxant. The calcium content is considered beneficial for calcium deficient persons with issues such as osteoporosis. A typical dose is 1 gram of pearl powder taken by mouth, traditionally mixed into water or tea, twice weekly. Excessive doses may cause calcium toxicity. The powder is also used to treat stomach and intestinal conditions such as indigestion and chronic constipation. It is claimed to minimize pain from sores and ulcers, and to help reduce the sores and ulcers themselves. History China The use in China of pearl powder, both as medicine and as cosmetic, dates back at least to 320 AD. Pearl powder was an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), in the treatment of eye diseases, tuberculosis and to prevent heart attacks. The empress Wu Ze Tian (625 AD – 705 AD) used pearl powder internally and on her skin. The medical book Bencao Gangmu of the Ming dynasty claimed that pearl can stimulate new skin growth and healing, release toxins, and remove sun damage and age spots. India Pearl powder was also used in Ayurvedic medicine in the Indian subcontinent. Narahari, a physician of Kashmir, wrote in about 1240 that the pearl was an antidote to poisons, cured conditions of the eyes, consumption and \\"morbid disturbances\\", and increased general strength and health.\\"The Book of the Pearl\\", p. 308 Powdered pearl was also an ingredient of love potions. An Indian pharmacological work published in 1903 listed the powder as a tonic, stimulant and aphrodisiac.\\"The Book of the Pearl\\", p. 310 Philippines In the Philippines from pre-colonial times, selected youths called binukot are special type of princes and princesses that were kept in seclusion and hidden from the sun in order to have fair and white skin. The binukot were fed crushed pearl powders to enhance the fairness and luminosity of their skin. Crushed pearl powder was also applied to their face and body to make their skin more pale and firm. Europe In medieval Europe, pearl powder was widely perceived to have therapeutic qualities. It was used in an attempt to treat the insanity of Charles VI of France (1368–1422), and the fever of which Lorenzo de Medici died in 1492. Seventeenth-century German and English works claimed its effectiveness in a wide range of physical and mental conditions.\\"The Book of the Pearl\\", p. 312 Francis Bacon (1561–1626) recommended it as a means of prolonging life.\\"The Book of the Pearl\\", p. 313 Pearl powder was also used as a skin whitener by women in Europe during the nineteenth century; one work, however, deprecated it as imparting a \\"pale, sickly hue\\", as well as being injurious to the skin and general health.

The first Portuguese settlement was in 1558 by two Jesuit priests, João Gonçalves and Antônio Rodrigues. They formed a village called Aldeia do Divino Espírito Santo. Aldeia do Divino Espírito Santo played an important role in the expulsion of the Dutch who arrived in Bahia in the 17th century. Troops under the leadership of bishop D. Mark Teixeira drove out the Dutch in 1624. The name of the village was changed to Vila de Nova Abrantes do Espírito Santo on September 28, 1758 under orders from the Marquiq de Pombal. The Jesuits were also expelled from the area at the same time. Later the village came to be known simply as Vila de Abrantes.

His grandfather, Major John Buchanan, was one of the founders of Nashville, Tennessee. His brother, John P. Buchanan was a governor of Tennessee. He attended public school and the academy at Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Then he attended and graduated from Cumberland University at Lebanon, Tennessee in 1885 with a Bachelor of Science degree. He did graduate work at both Vanderbilt University in 1893-4 and the University of Chicago in 1896. He received his LL.D. from Kingfisher College, Kingfisher, Oklahoma in 1917. Buchanan was one of the earliest faculty members appointed to the newly created Oklahoma University by its first president, David Ross Boyd, and began advancing through the academic ranks. He became chairman of the History Department, then Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, where he served for 19 years. Described as extremely popular with both students and faculty, he proved to be a very effective administrator. He also survived political purges that swept away two presidents and several other highly rated faculty members during the early years of the University's existence. After serving nearly one year as acting president and one as full president, he returned to full-time teaching and serving as the school vice president until his death in March 1930. Move to Oklahoma James' brother, John, was the Governor of Tennessee during 1891 - 1893. He appointed James as the assistant superintendent of public schools for the state. Instead, James decided to move to Indian Territory, where he became a professor of history at Central Normal School in Edmond in 1894.Levy, David W. \\"Buchanan, James Shannon (1864 - 1930).\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed October 6, 2017. In 1895, Buchanan moved to Norman and accepted the same position at the newer University of Oklahoma, a connection he would maintain for the rest of his career. Politics and academia Around the dawn of the Twentieth Century, territorial colleges and universities were ripe fields for political patronage. There had been only one Democratic Governor in Oklahoma Territory since it was created in 1890, W. C. Renfrow was appointed by Democratic President Grover Cleveland and served between 1893 and 1897. David Ross Boyd, the first President of OU, had been appointed by the first Oklahoma Territorial Governor, George W. Steele, a Republican, who had been appointed by Republican President Benjamin Harrison. At the first statewide election after being granted statehood on November 16, 1907, the electorate chose an administration controlled by the Republican Party, led by Charles N. Haskell. Among other \\"reforms\\", the Democrats were determined to purge Republican influence from OU. Very soon, Haskell fired the entire OU Board of Regents and named a new president for the school, Arthur Grant Evans, who was to take over, effective July 1, 1908. Evans had previously been president of Henry Kendall College, then a Presbyterian School located in Muskogee. \\"Uncle Buck\\" survives Every faculty member was directed to appear before the Board of Regents on June 23, 1908, to present reasons why he or she should be allowed to remain at OU. For most, this was a formality, as the outcome had already been decided before the meeting, based on party affiliation. Fortunately for them, most were hired outside the state before the start of the next school year. Buchanan was one of two southern Democrats on the faculty prior to Oklahoma becoming a state. Because of this, he was one of the few who survived the cuts the newly elected Democratic governor of Oklahoma, Charles N. Haskell, made to the University; cuts which included the first president of Oklahoma, David Ross Boyd. He came to the university in 1895 as a professor of history. Buchanan had other advantages as well. He was politically active, having been a member of the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention in 1906-7. He was also elected to the Norman City Council. He had a great talent for making friends all over the state. He was extremely popular among his students, who had coined the nickname, \\"Uncle Buck\\", for him, and by which he was known all over the campus. Another faculty member said,\\"... everybody liked Professor Buchanan. I presume he never had an enemy.\\" Through the years, he progressed up the ranks. Soon, he was head of the department of history. In 1909, he was named as the first dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. He also was a busy man outside of his university duties: he was an official in his church, the superintendent of his Sunday school, member of a civic club, member of the chamber of commerce, and of a prominent fraternal organization. University president In 1922, John C. \\"Jack\\" Walton, a Democrat, was elected Governor of Oklahoma. Walton had a very different agenda for the university. He represented a solidly populist wing of the electorate who felt that the institution had become too elitist, too expensive, and whose curriculum taught too many social concepts that they opposed. Almost as soon as he took office, he began a campaign to eliminate these problems. First he fired five members of the Board of Regents and replaced them with his own backers. Then he began to undermine President Stratton Duluth Brooks, who had been hired in 1912. By 1923, Brooks decided that he did not want to remain in a position where he clearly was unwanted, and resigned from OU on January 12, 1923.Harp, p.37. Evidently realizing that it would not be possible to hire a highly qualified president before classes began in the fall of 1923, Walton appointed Professor James S. Buchanan as Acting President. Buchanan was dean of the college of arts and sciences for 14 years before he was named acting president of the university on July 1, 1923. He was appointed president one year later. He was not in office very long but he still had several notable accomplishments. For one he was responsible for the reestablishment of the Oklahoma Geological Survey. Also, the concept and fundraising began for a combination football stadium/student union began during his year as president. In 1925, Buchanan led a $1 million fund-raising campaign to build both a football stadium and a student union building. Construction began in the same year, and the student union building was completed and opened November 22, 1928. Both the Oklahoma Memorial Union and Memorial Stadium, were dedicated in honor of the OU students and alumni who died in World War I. Later, it was rededicated to honor all members of the OU community who sacrificed their lives in defense of their country. A clock tower was included in the original, but was not added until 1936 because of the onset of the Great Depression.\\"Oklahoma Memorial Union.\\" Undated. Accessed October 7, 2017. He served effectively, but made known that he strongly desired to return to teaching. After he was replaced as university president by William Bennett Bizzell in June 1925, he remained at OU serving as the Vice-President of the university. Personal James married Vinnie Galbraith at Terrell, Texas on June 24, 1896. They had three children: Frances, James and William, before Vinnie died May 15, 1921. On December 23, 1924, he married his second wife, Katharyn Osterhaus, who had been the supervisor of English at University High School also in Norman, Oklahoma. James Shannon Buchanan died on March 20, 1930. Katharyn and the three children survived him.

Itabuna covers a total area of and has a population density of 550 residents per square kilometer. History The Portuguese arrived in the 16th century. The region was inhabited by the Tupiniquim, an indigenous group of the larger Tupi people. The Portuguese established the Captaincy of Ilhéus in the region, but it failed due to attacks by the nomadic Aimoré people, who emerged from the interior of Brazil in the 1550s. The region was populated by non-native Brazilians from 1867, mainly by migrants from Sergipe. Felix Severino de Oliveira, later known as Félix Severino do Amor Divino, and José Firmino Alves, his cousin, founded Fazenda Marimbeta, a farm, in the municipality. A street remains with the name in the Conceição of Itabuna. Itabuna was emancipated from Ilhéus in 1910. In 1978, the city became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Itabuna. Economy Itabuna is a regional center of commerce, industry and services, along with its neighbour Ilhéus. Its economic importance grew during the golden era of cocoa cultivation. Thanks to its fertile soil, the city became the second biggest producer of cocoa in Brazil, exporting to the United States and Europe. After the devastation of crops caused by the fungus Crinipellis perniciosa (which causes a disease known as witch's broom), which led to a profound crisis in its economy, the city began to search a diversification of its economical activities.

Slapton Ley is visible behind the houses. The \\"inland\\" part of Torcross seen from across Slapton Ley. Salvaged tank Torcross is a village in the South Hams district of Devon in England. It stands at grid reference at the southern end of Slapton Sands, a narrow strip of land and shingle beach which separates the freshwater lake of Slapton Ley from Start Bay and carries the A379 coastal road north to Dartmouth.  Early history  The first mention of Torcross was recorded at the manorial court in the court rolls of 29 March 1602 when it was recorded that a representative of the new village reported that everything was \\"all well\\". In 1854 the coastal road between Kingsbridge and Dartmouth was built passing through Torcross giving a much needed lifeline to the community. In 1858 a coach service started between Dartmouth and Kingsbridge.  WW2 evacuation and Exercise Tiger  In late 1943 Torcross was evacuated, along with many other villages in the South Hams area, to make way for 15,000 allied troops who needed the area to practice for the D-Day landings. In the early hours of 28 April 1944 a tragic incident happened during Exercise Tiger: nine German torpedo boats (Schnellboote), alerted by heavy radio traffic, intercepted a three-mile-long convoy of vessels travelling from the Isle of Portland to Slapton Sands to undertake landing rehearsals for D Day. Two Tank landing ships (LST) were sunk in the engagement and 946 American servicemen died. Poor communications led to badly-timed shelling on the beach, killing about 300 more men. Over 1,000 lives were lost over the course of the operation, most of them through US Army friendly fire. A Sherman amphibious tank and several plaques stand at Torcross car park between Slapton Ley and the beach as memorials to the men who lost their lives. The operation to salvage the tank from the shallow waters of Start Bay was financed by Ken Small, a Torcross hotelier, and was completed in 1984.  Storms and coastal erosion  Over the years Torcross has survived a battering from some terrible storms. On 4 January 1979 enormous waves washed over the roofs of the dwellings causing substantial damage to all the buildings along the then beach front; in the aftermath lorry-loads of boulders were brought in from the Plymouth area as temporary protection and a new curved seawall was built. On 11 and 12 January 2001 another bad storm caused the loss of up to five metres of the beachhead along a stretch of beach about 1000 metres long. Part of the A379 road along Slapton Sands near Slapton village was also destroyed; it was not reopened for three months after being rerouted. 3,000 tons of boulders were initially used to protect the road, but were later removed because of damage to the Slapton Ley SSSI. The maintenance of the road is vital to Torcross as it is the main access route to Dartmouth for the villagers and local businesses. South Hams District Council is working to keep the A379 from being eroded, realigning the road and importing shingle from parts of Slapton Sands that have a surplus. A study by Natural England after the 2001 storm confirmed that because of the reduction in the amount of shingle available and the increasing frequency of storms, coupled with a predicted 30 to 40 cm rise in sea level over the next 50 years, Slapton Sands is retreating and will continue to retreat. On Tuesday and Wednesday 4 and 5 February 2014 a storm caused extensive damage to the properties along the promenade with the sea entering all properties except one on the night of 4 February. The buildings were hit by green water that came over the sea wall and large shingle also hit them. The road was also covered with the beach and became unpassable. Another storm on the night of Friday 14 February resulted in thousands of tonnes of the beach being washed onto the beach road, 4 people had to be rescued from their cars that were washed off the road, the coastguards undertaking the rescue also got their vehicle stuck on the unpassable beach road. In January 2015, some 27,000 tonnes of shingle was moved from further up the beach at a cost of £250,000 to strengthen the sea defences this was washed away by the next high tide. During February 2016 the sea wall collapsed beyond the easternmost buildings, which resulted in the road being closed. Also the concrete promenade began to crack along its length.  Tourism  The village was originally a fishing/farming village however tourism developed in the late Victorian age with at its peak 3 hotels and 10 B&B;'s hosting many tourists who visited the area, sadly no hotels remain. There are only 3 B&B;'s and a few airbnb's, village facilities includes 3 eating places, The Torcross Boathouse restaurant and fish and chip takeaway, The Start Bay Inn and Sea Breeze cafe. Torcross lies at the southern end of Slapton Ley National Nature Reserve where Slapton Ley issues through a culvert under the road and into the sea. The A379 road swings inland towards Kingsbridge at the village and the dwellings of Torcross follow the road inland for a few hundred metres. Some dwellings situated on higher ground south of the village offer views of Start Bay.  See also  * Hallsands, a nearby village that was destroyed by the sea in 1917.

Like human rights more generally, these rights are protected through the ongoing incorporation of global norms into legal systems and enforcement of the law, with the goal of holding duty- bearers accountable for their enactment and redress for victims of their violation. Recent reports by Human Rights Watch note persistent flaws with systemic exclusion of the Roma minority population, harassment of the press and LGBT populations, hesitant prosecution of war crimes, and faulty asylum protections (particularly for children). Overview During the breakup of Yugoslavia Serbia was the perpetrator of several human rights violations, most recognizably in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many who participated in Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina were brought up on crimes against humanity and eventually indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for The Former Yugoslavia. The most recent United Nations Human Rights Committee's periodic reports of Serbia note positive aspects such as the adoption of progressively inclusive legislation. However, ongoing matters of concern cited include insufficient implementation and funding of anti-discriminatory measures, persistent exclusion of Roma peoples, discrimination against LGBTI and HIV+ persons, lack of legal protection for those with disabilities, insufficient access to personal identity documents for refugees and displaced peoples, and a general failure to collect information of ethnic and racial minorities to ensure accountable reporting. By region Kosovo After the conflict, in fear of their safety, perhaps up to 250,000 Serbs and other ethnic minorities fled their homes to go north.\\"Kosovo: The Human Rights Situation and the Fate of Persons Displaced from Their Homes (.pdf) \\" Timok In 2005, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe \\"regreted that Serbia applies double standards in artificially separating the Romanians of Vojvodina from the Romanians of Eastern Serbia\\". Since 2004 they are regular clashes between the Serbian authorities and the Romanian community in Timok when Bojan Aleksandrović, a Romanian Orthodox priest decided to build Romanian Orthodox Church, Malajnica where he holds services in Romanian. The priest has been subjected to threats. In Negotin, the Romanian Cultural Association was vandalized in 2004 when Serbian pro-fascist ultra-nationalists wrote \\"Out of Serbia\\" on the windows of the main doors.http://www.dw- world.de/dw/article/0,,850103,00.html April 25, 2003 on Deutsche Welle In 2002 census, there appears to be 34,576 declared as Romanians, and 40,054 declared as Vlachs. The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia drew attention to the situation of the Romanian people living in Timok, and to their right to preserve their Romanian identity. Vojvodina Vojvodina has been in 2003 and 2004 identified by Human Rights Watch and the European Parliament as region experiencing human rights violation, and a marked increase in ethnic violence since the national elections of 2003. After thoroughly investigating these allegations, and taking into account the long history of ethnic conflict in the Balkans, the European Parliament in September 2005, unanimously passed a resolution summarised on the Europa website as: \\"In its resolution on Vojvodina, adopted with 88 votes in favour, none against and 2 abstentions, Parliament expresses its deep concern at the repeated breaches of human rights and the lack of law and order in that province.\\"\\"Human rights in Nepal, Tunisia and Vojvodina\\" Parliament of the European Union Resolution on Vojvodina 29 September 2005. (Accessed January 29, 2007) One instance of effective Police enforcement against ethnic violence involved a recent attack against an ethnic Serb Man, Zoran Petrović from Novi Sad, in Temerin on 26 June 2004. On that day, five young ethnic Hungarian drug users: István Máriás, Zsolt Illés, Árpád Horvát, Zoltán Szakáll, and József Uracs, attacked and tortured (by means of inserting a baseball bat into his anus) Mr. Petrović, and almost killed him the following is not encyclopedic: \\"which triggered comparisons to a similar event in Kosovo several years ago, when several Albanians inserted a bottle into anus of one Kosovo Serb, which triggered some of the events of the Kosovo conflict. This was interpreted in some media reports as having the symbolic purpose of reminding Serbs of execution by impalement during the period of Ottoman rule. The five criminals were convicted and received a penalty prescribed by the law, namely 11 to 15 years of imprisonment.  Recent United Nations Reporting  The third periodic report of Civil and Political Rights in Serbia concluded in 2017 and the second periodic report on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights concluded in 2014. They highlight measures taken towards the realization of Human Rights since prior reporting in Serbia, as well as ongoing matters of concern. Positive aspects include: * ratification or accession of multiple international human rights conventions and protocols * adoption of national strategies towards gender equality and antidiscrimination, and action plans against corruption, trafficking of persons, and domestic violence. * Adoption of a national employment strategy with subsidies for Roma employment * Changes to Social Welfare and Education System laws that promote social inclusion * Legal protections for working mothers and pregnant women * A new 2016 law on the prevention of domestic violence, as well as heightened efforts towards finding missing persons. However, the authors also note persistent hate crimes, discrimination and/or a lack of legal protection, particularly for Roma peoples, LGBTI and HIV+ individuals, persons with disabilities, Internally Displaced peoples, Refugees and Asylum Seekers, religious minorities, and particularly women and children within these groups. They also note concerns in human trafficking and labor exploitation, inadequate application of asylum law and protection of children seeking asylum, a denial of state pensions for previously displaced peoples, inadequate legal accountability for past human rights violations, and low levels of rights protection through government monitoring. These reports contain suggestions on progressive work towards improving Serbia’s protection of human rights, similar to suggestions held as a primary requirement in Serbia’s negotiations for entrance to the EU.

It is in the microregion of the Paraíba Valley, within the mesoregion of the South Fluminense. It is located at latitude 22º32'39 \\"south, longitude 44º10'17\\" west and altitude of 381 meters. Its estimated population in 2013 was of 179,472 inhabitants, forming a conurbation with the cities of Volta Redonda and Pinheiral with a population of more than 450 thousand inhabitants. It has an area of 548.9 km². The administrative and legislative center is in the Centro district. In it are located the city hall and the City Hall). The judicial center is the Barbará neighborhood, where the municipal forum is located. In 1954 the district of Volta Redonda was emancipated and, in 1991, it was Quatis's turn, taking with him the districts of Ribeirão de São Joaquim and Falcão. In 1993 Antônio Rocha was elevated to the condition of district, as well as the district Santa Rita de Cássia, in 2006. The population of Barra Mansa is made up of descendants of European immigrants (mainly Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish), but also French and German, as well as a dynamic Syrian-Lebanese colony, as well as Amerindians and African descendants. The municipality has the second largest population of the South Fluminense mesoregion, has more than 528 industrial units, a large rail, road and river junction. It is located in a privileged area, close to the two largest Brazilian cities: Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. It is also close to regional economic centers such as São José dos Campos, Juiz de Fora and Volta Redonda. Barra Mansa has a per capita income above the national average of R $13,956.15 [5], and has a Human Development Index (HDI) considered high by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) of 0.806 (year 2000 ). It is sixth in the ranking of best Human Development Index (HDI-M) among the municipalities of Rio de Janeiro. Barra Mansa has a strong and traditional shopping center, vital to the municipality's economy. Around 1700, arriving in São Paulo was an almost impossible task, because of the natural barrier created by the Serra do Mar. But for the trip to become faster, the governor Luís Vaía Monteiro ordered a way through the Itaguaí mountain range. After completing the route, several incursions were made to the Paraíba do Sul River, but without the commitment to form villages or towns. These incursions were almost always made up of adventurers looking for gold. The first clue to settlement occurred in 1764 when Francisco Gonçalves de Carvalho obtained with the viceroy D. Antônio Álvares da Cunha a sesmaria to found a farm of cattle and supplies (Fazenda da Posse) between the Paraíba River of the South and the river Bananal, exactly in the place where there was a stream called Barra Seca or Barra Mansa. In 1764, the Vice King of Brazil, Antônio Álvares da Cunha, granted a sesmaria to the farmer Francisco Gonçalves de Carvalho. Thus was born in these lands the first building of the Vila de São Sebastião da Barra Mansa. Built on the banks of the Barra Mansa River and the Paraíba do Sul River, the Posse farm, dating from 1768. The Barão de Guapi Palace is a historical building of Barra Mansa that received illustrious people like the Princess Isabel. Already hosted the City Hall and the City Hall. It currently houses the Library. In 1765, José Alberto Monteiro also obtained from the viceroy a sesmaria on the bank of the Paraíba River, where it is today the city of Volta Redonda. Over the years, these sesmarias were changed owners, until, around 1827, they arrived, by inheritance, at the hands of Colonel Custódio Ferreira Leite, the Baron of Aiuruoca, founder of the municipality. From there, the site became the obligatory point of passage of troops of travelers on the way to seaports. In 1800, in the lands of Henrique Magalhães, very near the mouth of the river Barra Mansa, already existed a mill and a chapel. Gradually, a small population nucleus began to emerge and the beginning of the settlement encouraged Colonel Custódio Ferreira Leite, who had another chapel built on the right bank of the Paraíba, also dedicated to São Sebastião, located almost in front of Fazenda Ano Bom , on the opposite bank of the river. The small village grew and on October 3, 1832, thanks to a letter addressed to the General Legislative Assembly of the Empire, the village of São Sebastião de Barra Mansa was created, becoming part of the village dismembered lands of the neighboring Resende, Valença and St. John Mark. In 1954, due to a political maneuver, it had emancipated the until then district of Santo Antônio de Volta Redonda and in 1991 the districts of Quatis, Falcão and Ribeirão de São Joaquim.

The annual event takes place the first Saturday in October on the Signal Mountain, Tennessee, portion of the Cumberland Trail. In 2007 the race field was limited to 400 participants to limit the impact on this wilderness area. The race benefits the Cumberland Trail Conference, and in 2007, raised $4,000 for CTC's for trailbuilding and maintenance programs. Course The course is shaped like a lollipop, with a total elevation gain of several thousand feet. Runners leave the stick of the lollipop at mile 10.3, then run a 10.2 mile loop and rejoin the stick at mile 20.5. This means that runners see the first 10 or so miles twice, which contains the most elevation change in the whole race. Runners cross Suck Creek Road twice. The 50k course’s first and last 4 miles are on a jeep/dirt road. For the middle portion of the race, the trail is predominantly technical single track made up of packed dirt and mountain stone, including one section runners have nicknamed the \\"Rock Garden\\". History and records The Rock/Creek StumpJump 50k was started in 2002 by local trail running enthusiast Matt Sims as a way to get support for the Cumberland Trail Conference and promote local participation in trail running. Today, the race receives some of trail running’s top athletes including Max King, Duncan Callahan, John Stamstad, Josh Beckham, Bryan Dayton and David Riddle, who holds the course record of 3 hours 49 min. and 52 seconds, set in 2011.

Description  The Atlas III consisted of two stages. The first stage was new, but the upper stage was the Centaur, which is still in use today on the Atlas V EELV. The first stage engines were Russian RD-180s, which are also used by the Atlas V. The Atlas III was produced in two versions. The baseline was the Atlas IIIA, but the Atlas IIIB, featuring a twin-engine version of the Centaur upper stage, was also produced.  Launches  The first flight of the Atlas III occurred on 24 May 2000, launching the Eutelsat W4 communications satellite into a geosynchronous orbit. All Atlas III launches were made from Space Launch Complex 36B at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

The fruit body has a cap that is a dull to golden shade of yellow, and typically in diameter. The cap surface is sticky when moist, and characterized by white warts, which are easily detached. It is initially convex, and flattens out when mature. The flesh is white and does not change colour when cut. Gills are white and closely spaced. The stem is pale yellow, and measures long by thick. The partial veil that covers the young fruit body turns into the ring on the stem at maturity. The spore print is white, while the spores are roughly elliptical, and measure 8–10 by 6.5–7.5 μm. This species is a mycorrhizal fungus, widespread in Europe. It can grow either singly, scattered, or in groups. It prefers habitats like coniferous and mixed forests and alongside paths, where it fruits in summer and fall. It is a toxic mushroom, containing muscarine, also found in many species in the Clitocybe and Inocybe genera, as well as in Amanita muscaria and Amanita pantherina, albeit in insignificant quantities in the latter two. It is often confused with various other European species. A. gemmata resembles the false death cap, tawny grisette and panther cap mushrooms. Its cap is brighter in color than the former, and more yellow than the latter two. Taxonomy and phylogeny The species was first described scientifically by Swedish mycologist and botanist Elias Magnus Fries as Agaricus gemmatus in 1838. It was transferred to the genus Amanita in 1866 by the French statistician Louis Bertillon. The species has been transferred to several genera in its history, resulting in a number of synonyms, including Amanita muscaria var. gemmata (1886, Lucien Quélet), Amanitopsis gemmata (1887, Pier Andrea Saccardo), Amanitaria gemmata (1940, Jean-Edouard Gilbert), and Venenarius gemmatus (1948, William Murrill). Amanita authority Rodham E. Tulloss considers A. amici (published by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1891) to be synonymous with A. gemmata, as the macroscopic characteristics of the former fall within the limits of the range expected for the latter. Within the genus Amanita, A. gemmata is classified in subgenus Amanita, section Amanita, subsection Gemmatae, and series Gemmatae. Tulloss places the species in a stirps (an informal ranking above species level) with A. russuloides and A. viscidolutea. Some mycologists believe that A. gemmata is not different from A. russuloides. Two molecular studies based on sequences of the large ribosomal subunit RNA gene (nLSU-rDNA) and the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit RNA gene (mtSSU-rDNA) show that A. gemmata is part of a clade within Amanita with its close relatives A. muscaria, A. farinosa and A. roseitincta. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"gemmed Amanita\\", the \\"jonquil Amanita\\", or the \\"European gemmed Amanita\\". Description Young specimen after several days of dry weather (note pale color of dry cap) The fruit bodies are colored yellow overall. The fresh cap, ranging in color from dull creamy yellow to golden yellow to buff, is sticky when moist. White warts adorn the cap surface, but they are usually flimsy and easily washed away by rain. They are placed randomly, but tend to be more concentrated in the center. The cap is typically in diameter, and initially convex before flattening out in maturity. The flesh is white, and shows no change when sliced. The gills are adnate to adnexed, and white; they are close together, with little intervening space. The pale yellowish stem is long by thick, and either roughly equal in width throughout, or slightly thicker at the base. Young mushrooms have a membranous partial veil extending from the upper stem to the cap margin; as the mushroom grows, the partial veil tears to leave a flimsy, skirt-like, easily lost ring on the stem. At the base of the stem is a white volva (a remnant of the universal veil that covered the immature mushroom) that usually forms a small, free rim. Spore prints are white. There is no distinctive odour. Microscopic characteristics The spores are thin-walled and ellipsoid. Amanita gemmata has ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid spores measuring 8–10 by 6.5–7.5 μm with an average Q-ratio (the fraction of length/width) of 1.35; they are not amyloid. The spores are smooth, thin-walled, and they contain one to several small oil droplets. The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are usually four-spored, club shaped, and measure 30–40 by 8–11 μm. The gill tissue is divergent, meaning that the cells are more or less parallel near the center of the gill, but bend outwards near the end of the gill. The hyphae in this tissue are cylindrical to inflated, thin walled, hyaline (translucent) to yellowish, and measure 2.2–9 μm wide; the hyphae in the central strand are narrower and typically cylindrical. The hyphae of the subhymenium (a layer of tissue directly under the hymenium) are interwoven. These hyphae are branched, cylindrical to slightly inflated, hyaline, and 6–9 μm wide. The hyphae of the cap cuticle are filamentous, interwoven, and radially arranged. They are cylindrical, 2.7–4 μm wide, thin-walled, hyaline to yellowish, and gelatinize when mounted in potassium hydroxide. The cap tissue is also interwoven, with hyphae that are cylindrical to somewhat inflated, 3.7–14.6 μm wide, thin-walled, branched, and hyaline to yellowish. Caulocystidia are abundant on the apex of the stem; they are club-shaped to cylindrical, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 3–9 μm wide. The annulus tissue comprises interwoven cylindrical hyphae measuring 3–9 μm wide. Sphaerocysts (inflated, spherical cells) are also present in the annulus tissue; they are club shaped to ellipsoidal, with dimensions of 29–55 by 30–70 μm. The warts on the cap surface (remnants of the universal veil) comprise loosely interwoven cylindrical to inflated thin-walled hyphae that are 3.5–8 μm wide. Sphaerocysts in this tissue are 58.5–70.2 by 17.5–40 μm, ellipsoidal, and hyaline. The volval tissue is interwoven, with cylindrical, hyaline hyphae that are 4.4–7.3 μm wide. The sphaerocysts here are ellipsoidal to roughly spherical, hyaline, and measure 35–70 by 20–35 μm. In A. gemmata, where they are most abundant in the region just below the cap cuticle, these refractive cells are scattered, and have a width of 3.7–6 μm. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of A. gemmata; they are present in the annulus, gill tissue, subhymenium, and cap tissue. Similar species There are numerous species in North America that resemble A. pantherina. In 2005, mycologist Rod Tulloss described Amanita aprica, a species that has been confused with A. gemmata several times in the past. According to mycologists Pierre Neville and Serge Poumarat, the Mediterranean species A. amici (synonymous with A. gemmata f. amici) is similar in appearance to A. gemmata but is larger. According to Tulloss however, their measurements of the cap and stem dimensions of A. amici fell within the range expected for A. gemmata, and for this reason, the two taxa should be considered conspecific. Neville and Poumarat suggest that the name A. gemmata still persists for Mediterranean collections because of its frequent historical misapplication to the native Italian species A. gioiosa, which had not been described as a distinct species until 2004. A. orientigemmata, a mushroom ranging from Japan to China, is a lookalike, but has clamps, unlike A. gemmata. Other differences between the two species include the slightly smaller spores of A. orientigemmata, and differences in the microstructure of the cap warts. Toxicity Toxicity is suspected to be due to the presence of muscimol and ibotenic acid. Generally, symptoms of poisoning appear within three hours of ingestion of the mushroom as visual hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, irregular and slow heart beat and agitation. Severe cases involving coma, convulsions, or death are extremely rare. Ecology, habitat and distribution A. gemmata specimen from Commanster, Belgium Amanita gemmata is a mycorrhizal fungus, meaning it forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source, and the fungus provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of A. gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. The fungus favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads. The species is distributed in areas of Asia and Europe. It is widely distributed (as a species cluster, not the actual Amanita gemmata) in North America, where it has been found as far south as Ixtlán de Juárez, Mexico. The species has been reported from the Dominican Republic. In South America, it is known from Chile and Colombia. In Asia, the mushroom has been collected from Iran and China.

He served three terms as a United States Representative for Illinois. Bowler is the oldest person to win his first election to Congress, and was 78 years old at the time he assumed office. Early life Bowler was born in Chicago, Illinois on February 5, 1875. He attended the parochial and public schools of Chicago, and was a professional bicycle endurance rider and racer before running for Alderman. He later became involved in the insurance business and was the owner of several race horses, both ventures he acquired from the family of John Coughlin following Coughlin's death. Career  Chicago politics  He became an Alderman (City Councilman) for Chicago's 19th Ward in 1906, serving alongside John Powers. When Anthony D'Andrea ran against Bowler in 1916, the violence during the election sparked the five-year-long Aldermen's Wars, which saw thirty political operatives killed. Bowler served on the Chicago City Council until 1953, with hiatuses from 1923 to 1927 when he served as Chicago's Commissioner of Compensation, and in 1934, when he was Chicago's Commissioner of Vehicle Licenses. He served as chairman of several committees, including Rules and Finance, and was the council's President pro tempore for eight years. His 42 years on the City Council made him one of the longest-serving Aldermen in Chicago history. From 1927–1934 and 1945–1953, he was the alderman from the 25th Ward. Bowler was the Chairperson of the City Council's remapping committee in 1923 when it became apparent that the fairest map would redistrict him out of his own 19th Ward. With no hesitation, he proceeded to remap himself out of the City Council. Four years later, he ran in the new ward in which he found himself residing, the 25th, and won. Congress In 1953, he became a U.S. Representative for Illinois' 7th District. He was elected as a Democrat to the Eighty-third Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Adolph J. Sabath. He was reelected to the Eighty-fourth and Eighty-fifth Congresses and served from July 7, 1953, until his death. During his later years, Bowler suffered from arthritis and other ailments, and walked with the aid of a cane. During his final term, he was confined to a hospital bed and unable to attend House sessions, and his oath of office was administered in Chicago by Congressman Charles A. Boyle. Bowler is considered to have been one of the five individuals most responsible for pushing through legislation that helped fund the building of the Congress Street (now Eisenhower) Expressway in Chicago. He also was instrumental in creating the Illinois Medical District in Chicago, which contains several hospitals and other healthcare providers. Personal life In 1905, Bowler was appearing in Salt Lake City as a member of a bicycle racing team when he married Anastasia V. Sweeney of Chicago, who had traveled to Salt Lake City for the ceremony. Bowler died in Chicago on July 18, 1957. He had been ill for several years following a heart attack and suffered from complications from arthritis.Congerssman Dies; Harrisburg Daily Register; Harrisburg, Illinois; Page 10; July 18, 1957 He was buried at All Saints Cemetery, Des Plaines, Illinois.

He was born in Gotha, the fifth child and first son of Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and Magdalena Sibylle of Saxe-Weissenfels. After the death of his father, in 1691, Frederick II assumed the duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Because he was still under age, a guardianship and co-regency was formed between his uncles, the dukes Bernhard I of Saxe-Meiningen and Heinrich of Saxe-Römhild. In 1693, after he returned from a journey to Holland and England, he wrote to the emperor for a license of adult age and took independent control of the government of his duchy. Frederick was a splendor-loving baroque ruler; maintaining his court and standing army, which he had taken over from his father and even expanded, devoured a considerable amount of his income. As a solution, Frederick hired out his soldiers to foreign princes, which caused him great difficulties in 1702, when the King Louis XIV of France hired his troops and used them in his war against the Emperor. Relating to domestic affairs, Frederick essentially continued the policy of his father. He created an orphanage in Altenburg (1715), a workhouse and a lunatic asylum in Kahla (1726), as well as the Magdalenenstift - in honor of his mother and wife (both with the same name) - (1705), an endowment for unmarried noble women. For 100,000 thaler from his private property, he bought the famous numismatic collection of Prince Anton Günther of Schwarzburg Arnstadt, which formed the basis of the current collection of coins (Münzkabinetts) at Schloss Friedenstein. By accumulation of parts of Saxe-Coburg (dissolved in 1699), Saxe-Eisenberg (dissolved in 1707) and Saxe-Römhild (dissolved in 1710), he succeeded to all, however only at long hereditary disputes under the other Ernestine duchies, which went only to 1735 with an arbitral award of the Emperor finally to end reaching in each case area increases for his country.

A biological survey was conducted at the base of the Alaska Peninsula in 1902 by Wilfred Hudson Osgood, which included the Egegik River.Baker, p. 53 Etymology The river has been known by other names and spellings: Ougagouk (1828); Ugaguk (obsolete except on Government maps) or Igagik (Russian variations); also variously Agouyak, lgiagik. Egegak. Ugiagik. Geography The river is located on the Alaska Peninsula. Its watershed originates in the Aleutian Range before it flows westward from Becharof Lake into Bristol Bay via Egegik Bay, an arm of Kvichak Bay. Egegik rapids are reported at the outlet of Becharof Lake. The town of Egegik is situated at the mouth of the river. White bluff is situated on the river's north shore, just inside Cape Chichagof at Bristol Bay.Baker, p. 672 The major tributaries are Kejulik River, Shosky Creek, and King Salmon River. The King Salmon River, which drains the area between Becharof and Naknek lakes, is the principal tributary to the Egegik from the north.Baker, p. 367 Being in length, it enters about from the mouth of the Egegik. Becharof National Wildlife Refuge is nearby. Egegik River heads at Becharof Lake (Peulik volcano in background). Ugaguk River, the outlet of Lake Becharof, flows in a westerly direction for approximately . It empties into the Kvichak Bay approximately north of Cape Greig with its northern entrance point at Cape Chichagof. Its tidewater extends up river and the river is navigable to within of the lake, where there is a succession of rapids. At low water, a large part of the river bed is exposed with shoals, banks, and narrow, winding channels. At the mouth, shoal water extends for several miles offshore. Fauna Spawning of pink salmon most commonly occurs in the river in the month of August. The coho salmon spawning and rearing habitat is situated along the main stem of the river. The main stream of the river supports chum salmon. Arctic Char migrate down the river in late May. Lake Trout are found near at the lake's outlet to Egegik River. Economy In 1895, the Alaska Packers Association established a fishing station on the right bank about from the mouth and operated as a saltery until 1900, when the operations was moved to the cannery site. In 1899, the Alaska Packers Association, under the name of the Egegak Packing Company, began construction of a cannery on the left bank opposite and a little above the salting station; it was finished in 1900. In 1903, the North Alaska Salmon Company built and operated a cannery on the opposite shore from the Alaska Packers Association; it changed its name after several years to that of its new owners, Libby, McNeill & Libby. The cannery plants operated about from the mouth, the river being about wide at the point of the canneries. Only gillnetting was employed for commercial fishing, with fishing operations occurring from about above the canneries to the South Spit, near the mouth. Gill nets only were employed, and the catch included king salmon (Chinook), dog salmon (chum salmon, canned under a pink salmon label), and coho salmon. In the mid 1980s, there was one shore based processor/buyer at Egegik, with eight others working by other rivers in the locale. The Egegik District maintained 22 floating stations and had 492 drift net permit holders. Three-quarters of all personal use salmon came from the commercially caught fish.

The headwaters of the river originate in the eastern portion of the peninsula, around Granite Mountain. The river flows north to its mouth at Kiwalik Lagoon, Chukchi Sea. The start of the 20th century mining town of Candle is found on its western bank at the confluence of Candle Creek. The ore minerals and materials found in the river basin are galena, gold, pyrite, scheelite, silver and sphalerite, and the primary commodities are tungsten, lead and zinc. Etymology The Inuit name, published by the British Admiralty, about 1880 on Chart 593, was spelled \\"Kee-wa-lik.\\" Geography The Kiwalik River flows on the north side of Seward Peninsula. Its origin is in a low ridge that divides the Kiwalik catchment, flows for a length of about in a northerly direction, and finally debouches into Spafarief Bay; this bay protrudes from the Kotzebue Sound in a southeasterly direction. Its traverse further lower down for stretch of , through the flat lowland areas, is through a wide expanse of many miles; the river, however, has a narrow stretch of about in river stretch of a few miles, upstream of Candle. Beyond the Candle, it forms into a lagoon. The lagoon consists of vast areas of mud flats that get exposed during low tide. Tributaries The river has many tributaries that emerge from the west and form narrow basins with long and low ridges forming the dividing line; these tributaries are: Canoe Creek, Gold Run, and Glacier, Dome, Bonanza, Eldorado, Candle Creek, and Minnehaha creeks. Another important stream, which provides for water supply needs of the town, is the Glacier Creek which originates from the eastern slope of Monument Mountain, which is the highest peak in the Fairhaven district. It confluences with the Kiwalik, about above the estuary. The water resource is from limestone springs during the low flow season, which increases substantially from glacial melt during the season. Another stream joining the Kiwalik, about above the mouth of Glacier Creek, is the Gold Run. This stream is also sourced by springs but its flows are not comparable to that of Glacier Creek; the discharge of these two steams together, as reported in the summer of 1909 during the low flow season, was only of the order of /sec. Even in respect of other streams in the vicinity, there is very little flow during lean season. It is also reported that Candle Creek, which has a catchment area of at the mouth, goes dry during the lean season. From the eastern part of the Kiwalik River basin, the streams emanating from the east are the Quartz and Hunter creeks. Quartz Creek, with a larger catchment (rugged and hilly on the eastern and southern borders of the basin) joins the Kiwalik River, about above the mouth of Glacier Creek. A thin layer of moss covers the floor of the basin. The hill slopes are steep and precipitation drains out fast over the river bed which consists of loose gravel. Other streams that flow through the basin and which join the Quartz Creek are the Hunter Creek and Bear Creek; the former creek has lesser flows compared to Quartz Creek. Lava Creek, another small tributary from the east that drains a flat lava area in the north of Hunter Creek, has high runoff during the rainy months. The banks of the river and the creeks are lined with spruce and also willow vegetation, in specific stretches. History The river bed has very low slopes which retards the flow; the slope is generally in the range of to , except in its headwater reach of the river. This feature did not permit diversion of river water for mining to adopt hydraulicking procedure, particularly when the Alaska gold mining was at its peak. Hence, the Candle-Alaska Hydraulic Gold Mining Company excavated a ditch (an unlined canal), in 1907, to collect water from Glacier and Dome creeks, and to convey it to a location near Candle to facilitate mining the gold-bearing gravels of Candle Creek. To cater to the needs of the low flow season, when the streams (Quartz and Hunter creek to Candle Creek) carried low flows, an additional canal was constructed during the summers of 1908 and 1909 to facilitate the hydraulicking process of mining. The ditches were of substantial length, measuring of canals and an additional of pipe line to a point about above the mouth of Candle Creek. Gold and other minerals Kiwalik River is the third largest river in the region which cuts across the gold belt, and its tributary the Candle Creek holds gold deposits which were reported to be economical for extraction. Candle Creek and the town of candle close by have maximum extraction locations with the operations extensively carried out by the Arctic Circle Explorations Inc. Dredging was also carried out in the bed of the Kiwalik River for gold which was not successful. Gold placers were also located in the Quartz Creek. Uranium concentrations of more than 0.025% of equivalent uranium has also been found in the placers of the headwaters of the tributaries of the Kiwalik River. Candle on the Kiwalik Creek saw the gold rush in 1901 and 1906 and became the central Placer Gold District, when the population in the town was about 546; by about 1938 it had declined to 85 with the end of the gold rush.

Early life Stephen Ray Hettinger was born on August 25, 1945 in Memphis, Tennessee. He graduated from Mississippi State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in 1967, and moved to Huntsville, Alabama shortly after. Hettinger worked in the space program while studying towards a Master of Science in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, which he received in 1974. Career In 1982, he successfully ran for a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives, defeating an incumbent. He left the House after winning the 1988 race for mayor of Huntsville, where he defeated five-term Mayor Joe Davis. While serving as Mayor in June 1990, Hettinger appealed to President George H. W. Bush to restore the United States citizenship of Arthur Rudolph, a former Nazi and NASA scientist who had been brought to the United States under Operation Paperclip and denaturalized when his Nazi past resurfaced. The appeal failed. In 1995, Hettinger decided not to seek a third term in 1996 election. He considered running as a Democrat for a United States Senate seat being vacated by Howell Heflin, but the primary went to Roger Bedford, Jr. and the seat ultimately was won by Republican Jeff Sessions.

Seafood boil is the generic term for any number of types of social events in which shellfish, whether saltwater or freshwater, is the central element. Regional variations dictate the kinds of seafood, the accompaniments and side dishes, and the preparation techniques (boiling, steaming, baking, or raw). In some cases, a boil may be sponsored by a community organization as a fund-raiser or a mixer. In this way, seafood boils are like a fish fry, barbecue, or church potluck supper. Boils are also held by individuals for their friends and family for a weekend get-together and on the holidays of Memorial Day and Independence Day. While boils and bakes are traditionally associated with coastal regions of the United States, there are exceptions. Louisiana The Tulane University Crawfest festival. Shrimp, crab, and crawfish boils are a Louisiana Cajun tradition and can be found across Louisiana and can even now be found along the Gulf South. But it is the more popular crawfish boil that is most closely associated with Louisiana. The Breaux Bridge Crawfish Festival in Louisiana has been named one of the top 10 food events by USA TodayBreaux Bridge Crawfish Festival 2006 and is a showcase for Cajun music and culture. Major crawfish boils are held by churches and other organizations as fundraisers throughout the spring. Tulane University holds an annual \\"Crawfest\\" in April, and the University of New Orleans holds an annual crawfish boil for all students at the end of the spring semester (Students unwinding on Crawfish and Unprecedented Fun—SUCAUF). Smaller events can be found in backyards and parks throughout April, May, and June. Locals traditionally eat crawfish, as well as crabs, without tools such as shell crackers or picks. One reason for the popularity of crawfish may be price. During the height of the season (late spring) the price may be less than a $1.50/pound retail for live crawfish (2006) with crawfish prices currently being around $.99/pound. Shrimp and crab are higher valued cash crops, and can be a less affordable option for larger groups. Cooking crawfish at a party A boil is usually done in a large pot (60 to 80 quarts) fitted with a strainer and heated by propane. However, some traditionalists see no need for a strainer and make use of a net or a wire mesh scoop. Seasonings include crab boil packets, cayenne pepper, hot sauce, salt, lemons, and bay leaf. Ears of corn, new potatoes, onions, and heads of garlic are usually included in shrimp and crawfish boils. Some people will add smoked sausage links or mushrooms. When cooking crawfish there is a debate over whether or not the crawfish must first be purged by covering them with clear water and a generous amount of salt for a few minutes. Advocates argue that this forces the crawfish to rid their bodies of impurities. Others argue that it does not work and is an unnecessary step. A \\"Boil Master\\" is in charge of making sure the ingredients go into the pot in the proper sequence and controls the timing of the steps. There is no right or wrong when seasoning a crawfish boil and many experienced boilers simply go by feel although there are some guidelines to follow and a great deal of opinions on how a boiled crawfish should be seasoned.How To Season a Crawfish Boil Many recipes call for a short boil followed by a period of soaking with the heat turned off. The contents of the pot are removed, drained, and then dumped onto a newspaper covered table. Sometimes, crawfish may be dumped into the traditional watercraft in which crawfishermen have historically used to traverse the bayous and swamps; a pirogue. Bottles of hot sauce, lemons and melted butter are usually available, along with cocktail sauce at a shrimp boil. Some families like to use Italian salad dressing or ketchup, or a mixture of both. Howard Mitcham and his Guild of Chimney Sweepers (named in honor of a dinner that Charles Lamb hosted for the London sweeps) hosted a shrimp boil every year for French Quarter bohemians during the 1950s and 1960s. He notes, \\"At our last big party we boiled 400 pounds of shrimp and 400 fat crabs for 200 guests and we drank eight thirty-gallon kegs of beer. For music we had Kid Thomas and his Algiers Stompers, the famous old gut-bucket jazz group from Preservation Hall, and the Olympia Funeral Marching Band\\".Mitcham, Howard. Creole Gumbo and All That Jazz, p.66. Pelican Publishing Company 2003, . The Chimney Sweepers technique was to use new thirty-gallon galvanized garbage cans, filled one third full of water and brought to a boil with seasonings. The shrimp were divided into 25 pound batches and stuffed into new pillow cases and tied off. Twenty-five pounds of shrimp took about 25 minutes to cook. One batch came out and the next went in. Georgia and South Carolina Shrimp boil, also known as Lowcountry Boil or Frogmore Stew There are two kinds of social gatherings in coastal Georgia and South Carolina that revolve around shellfish. One is very much like a Louisiana boil, usually involving shrimp, corn on the cob, sausage, and red potatoes, and sometimes ham, and is considered part of Lowcountry cuisine. Known variously as Frogmore Stew, Beaufort Stew, a Beaufort boil, a Lowcountry boil, or a tidewater boil, they tend to be a bit milder than their Louisiana cousins. For example, it is not unusual for a Lowcountry recipe to call for a mixture of hot and mild boil seasonings, whereas a Louisiana recipe may start with crab boil packets and add large amounts of cayenne pepper. While shrimp are most often used, crabs or crawfish may be included if available. This is also a bit different from a Louisiana boil, which usually involves just one kind of shellfish at a time. Frogmore is the name of a community in the middle of St. Helena Island, near Beaufort, South Carolina. Although there are many versions of this dish around, the name Frogmore Stew was coined in the 1960s by Richard Gay, one of the owners of Gay Fish Company, circa 1948, on St. Helena Island. Frogmore Stew became far better-known after it was featured on the cover of Gourmet Magazine in the 1980s, and is enjoyed by all, with this name, to this day. In 2005, The Travel Channel featured Richard's brother, Charles Gay, cooking Frogmore Stew in its popular program Taste of America with Mark DeCarlo. The Low Country Boil may have possible influences from Louisiana, as there are some obvious similarities to some dishes of the cuisine of Louisiana. It showcases the same set of French, Spanish, African and Caribbean influences, including slave trade influences that Louisiana is known for. Meals for large gatherings of people would have to be made as quickly as possible with readily available foods. The boil was a quick and easy way to prepare all the foods at once. The best attended function to feature Frogmore Stew occurs in July at the 10-day Beaufort Water Festival (in the 54 years of the festival it has grown to be the largest totally volunteer run festival on the south eastern coast), the event feeds 2,400, the recipe includes 1,200 lbs of shrimp, 2,400 ears of corn, 600 lbs of sausage, 72 oz of seafood seasoning and is served with 350 lbs of coleslaw, 250 gal of iced tea, 2,400 rolls and 90 watermelons. The other kind of event is the Oyster Roast. Sheet metal or a fine mesh grill is placed over hot coals. Oysters are piled onto the grill (after having the mud washed off their shells). Wet burlap sacks are draped over the shells and the oysters are half grilled and half steamed. A shovel is used to scoop them onto nearby tables (plywood sheets on sawhorses works as well as anything). The shells have popped open (and are still hot), but the oysters are attached and just need a little coaxing to come free. This is particularly popular in the winter when the oysters are good and a hot fire keeps the coastal chill at bay. Both of these events are often large social functions in which a neighborhood, family, or friends gather for fellowship. Music, drinking, and dancing, especially the Carolina shag, are also common at these events. The most famous example of such a function takes place in Columbia, South Carolina, in late November prior to the in-state Clemson and South Carolina football game, on South Waccamaw Street. Chesapeake Bay The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary system in North America and provides an abundance of blue crab, Chincoteague oysters, and clams. It is located at the boundary between the South and Mid-Atlantic states and shares culinary traditions with both. Crab houses (also known as Crab shacks) serve freshly steamed crabs and are found along both shores of the bay. The Maryland Crab Feast (\\"Crab Boil\\" is not a phrase used in Maryland, as is in Louisiana) is a popular event for small groups of friends. Despite the name, the cooking technique is actually steaming. Crab pots have a raised bottom that keeps a fitted basket above the liquid. A couple of inches of beer (or water) mixed with vinegar is brought to a boil. The crabs are placed in the basket and sprinkled liberally with a seasoning mix (usually Old Bay), and then placed in the steamer. Twenty minutes later the bright red crabs are pulled up and turned out onto trays or platters. Tables are covered with layers of brown paper and wooden mallets and serrated knives are made available for cracking claws and picking out meat. Typical side dishes are cole slaw and corn on the cob. New England In New England, a clam bake is traditionally done on a beach. A pit is dug in the sand and lined with stones. A fire is built on top of the stones from driftwood. Once the fire dies down, seafood is placed on the stones and covered with seaweed and a canvas tarp. The residual heat from the stones along with steam from the moisture of the seaweed combines to cook the food. While lobster is often featured at clam bakes, some authors suggest that in practice, lobster will not be fully cooked by the time the stones have lost most of their heat.Deus Ex Culina An alternative to the labor-intensive bake is the New England Clam Boil. Like other regions, corn, potatoes, and sausage are popular additions. Recipes from the region suggest that little or no seasonings are added. Beer is often used as the boiling liquid. Charente- Maritime Mussels arranged for an eclade The Charente-Maritime département of France on the Bay of Biscay, is noted for the abundance of mussels. The Éclade des Moules (or, locally, Terré de Moules) is a bake often held on the beaches outside of La Rochelle. The mussels are arranged in concentric circles on a plank so that the hinged part of the shell is facing up. Pine needles are mounded on top to a depth of a foot or so and set afire. The needles burn down quickly, producing a rich resinous smoke. Two or three minutes after the fire goes out, the ashes are swept away and the mussels are eaten directly from the shell along with country bread, butter, and white wine.

The river originates in the interior of the peninsula, at the Lost Jim Lava Flow of the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, where it flows southeast towards the mouth of Norton Bay on Norton Sound. The native village of Koyuk is located at its mouth. The two major tributaries are the Peace and Salmon rivers; other tributaries include Dime and Sweepstakes. full text Etymology Its Inuit named as Tebenkof Eskimos, reported by Captain Tebenkov (1852, map 2), IRN, as Kvyguk or Kvieguk. The Western Union Telegraph Expedition spelled the name Koikpak (\\"big river\\"). The Seward map of 1867 gives Koipak, and later as Kayuk, Koyuk, and Kuyuk. The Kanguksuk is also known as the Left Fork of the Kviguk (Koyuk). The present spelling comes from Alfred Hulse Brooks', 1900 United States Geological Survey. Geography The Koyuk River, one of the largest in the Seward Peninsula, originates in a lake (no designated name) bounded on the north by the Bendeleben Mountains, in the upper reaches of the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, in Northwest Alaska. The upper reach is also reported as being made up of flat lava fields to the north of the mountains. The long river flows southeast for , then south for another . The river empties into Norton Bay, which it enters via a tidal estuary downstream of the river's confluence with the East Fork Koyuk River near the village of Koyuk. The last stretch of the river, is in a southeasterly direction as it joins the bay, and flows through the tundra wetland area. The catchment in the middle and upper reaches has a horse-shoe shape, and the hills surrounding the valley lie in an elevation range of ; the two prominent mountains are the Bendeleben Mountains and Domes of Granite Mountain, the latter named after the granite geological formations. In its initial reaches, the river has steep slopes with rapids in the upper most reaches having shallow depth of flows. The river widens as it flows down with more flow additions from tributaries which join it and the width of the river attains , with a slow moving stretch of the river recording a depth of water. On both banks of the river rock exposures derived lava flows are bedded on a horizontal direction; the rockfall from these exposures has filled the river bed with boulders. While the lava beds were noted in the upper region of the river and also in the valley, geological formations in the valley were mapped by Walter Curran Mendenhall, the fifth director of the US Geological Survey. He reported these formations as basalts of Pleistocene or Late Pleistocene age. Gold, platinum, and radioactive minerals were reported by the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1973, as well as lode and placer claims, along a wide stretch of the river. ;Basin The river becomes a broad estuary subject to tidal effect extending for long stretch upstream forming a flat mud- and sand-filled basin. The basin area measure approximately . The Bering Land Bridge National Preserve is in the uppermost part of the basin. Its drainage includes southeastern Seward Peninsula through Norton Bay. History A study of the archaeological remains at the Lyatayak site, south of Cape Denbigh and south of Koyuk, indicated that the area was inhabited 6000 to 8000 years ago. The recorded history of Koyuk is traced to Lieutenant L.A. Zagoskin of the Imperial Russian Navy during the 1840s. In 1865, William Wennis of the Western Union Telegraph expedition reported that the Koyuk was deserted on account of possibly the smallpox epidemic wiping out the entire population of the village and that the village had been abandoned for 13 years. The Yupik-speaking Unali Eskimos and the Melemute Eskimos resettled in Koyuk during the 1860s to take advantage of caribou herding. In 1879, a trading post for furs was established at the river's mouth by the Alaska Commercial Company. During the gold rush, there was intense activity in the region but hardly any gold was found though claims had been staked at many places within the Koyuk River valley. By 1900, the village had declined to the level of subsistence economy, depending on fishing and hunting caribou and moose and picking on berries. Wildlife Caribou reindeer Under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (P.L 96-487) the Koyuk River is categorized as \\"Freshwater Aquatic Herbaceous\\" and is one out of 25 nominated as the National Wild and Scenic Rivers. The river and the basin draining it is rich of wild life species, which consists of five fish species, 22 mammals species and 46 bird species. The flora of the river watershed, in their descending order of distribution are: closed needleleaf forest dominating the riparian zone; closed tall shrub scrub is also part of the riparian zone, and open-air low shrub scrub with willows and grasses as dominant vegetation. The wet graminoid herbaceous habitat lies between the river riparian and higher ground. The mesic graminoid herbaceous forms the hilly tussock tundra. The dominant vegetation in the valley is of tundras, except in the basin area below Knowles Creek, where it consists of tree species of willows, spruce and birch. The river is well known for its fishing resources. the fish species reported are Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), steelhead/rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma), northern pike (Esox lucius), grayling (Thymallus thymallus), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma malma), and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). Some of the important mammals reported in the river basin are moose (Alces alces), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), black bear (Ursus americanus), caribou (Rangifer tarandus), wolves (Canis lupus), lynx, red fox, beaver, and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). Some of the important bird species reported in the river watershed are: bald eagles, glaucous gulls, spruce grouse, northern flying squirrel, song birds, ravens, waterfowl, lesser golden-plover, whimbrel and Lapland longspur.

The missions gave Spain a valuable toehold in the frontier land, and introduced European livestock, fruits, vegetables, and industry into the region. The Indians were severely impacted by the introduction of European diseases such as smallpox and measles and by 1800 their numbers were a fraction of what they had been before the arrival of the Spanish. Mexico secularized all missions in its territory in 1834 and the last of the missionaries departed in 1840. Some of the mission churches survive and are still in use.Burckhalter, David, Sedgwick, Mina, and Fontana, Bernard L. (2013), Baja California Missions, Tucson: University of Arizona Press, p.27. Downloaded from Project Muse. Background As early as the voyages of Christopher Columbus, the Kingdom of Spain sought to establish missions to convert pagans to Catholicism in Nueva España (New Spain). New Spain consisted of the Caribbean, Mexico, and portions of what is now the Southwestern United States. To facilitate colonization, the Catholic Church awarded these lands to Spain. In addition to the presidio (royal fort) and pueblo (town), the misión was one of three major agencies employed by the Spanish crown to extend its borders and consolidate its colonial territories. Asistencias (\\"sub-missions\\" or \\"contributing chapels\\") were small-scale missions that regularly conducted Catholic religious services on days of obligation, but lacked a resident priest. Smaller sites called visitas (\\"visiting chapels\\") also lacked a resident priest, and were often attended only sporadically. Since 1493, the Crown of Spain had maintained missions throughout Nueva España. The location of the Indian peoples of Baja California. Each frontier station was forced to be self-supporting, as existing means of supply were inadequate to maintain a colony of any size. To sustain a mission, the padres needed colonists or converted Indigenous Americans, called neophytes, to cultivate crops and tend livestock in the volume needed to support a fair-sized establishment. Scarcity of imported materials and lack of skilled laborers compelled the Fathers to employ simple building materials and methods. Although the Spanish hierarchy considered the missions temporary ventures, individual settlement development was not based simply on \\"priestly whim.\\" The founding of a mission followed longstanding rules and procedures. The paperwork involved required months, sometimes years of correspondence, and demanded the attention of virtually every level of the bureaucracy. Once empowered to erect a mission in a given area, the men assigned to it chose a specific site that featured a good water supply, proximity to a population of indigenous peoples, and arable land. The padres, their military escort and often converted mainland indigenous people or mestizos initially fashioned defendable shelters, from which a base was established and the mission could grow. Construction of the iglesia (church) constituted the focus of the settlement, and created the center of the community. The majority of mission sanctuaries were oriented on a roughly east–west axis to take the best advantage of the sun's position for interior illumination. The workshops, kitchens, living quarters, storerooms, and other ancillary chambers were usually grouped in the form of a quadrangle, inside which religious celebrations and other events often took place. The Native Americans Indian peoples encountered by the Spanish missionaries in Baja California (from north to south) were the Kumeyaay, Cocopah, Pai Pai,Winter, Werner. 1967. \\"The Identity of the Paipai (Akwa'ala).\\" In Studies in Southwestern Ethnolinguistics: Meaning and History in the Language of the American Southwest, edited by Dell H.

In a policy followed throughout much of Latin America called reductions, the missionaries concentrated the Indians at or near the mission for religious instruction and training to become sedentary farmers and stock herders. Their goal was to create a self-sufficient theocracy in which the missionary, usually supported by Spanish soldiers and laymen, attempted to rule over every facet of the Indian's religious and secular lives.Burckhalter, David, Sedgwick, Mina, and Fontana, Bernard L. (2013), Baja California Missions, Tucson: University of Arizona Press, p. 7. Downloaded from Project Muse. The Indigenous peoples were housed often by gender, forcibly converted to Catholicism and acculturated to the Spanish Empire within the confines of the mission. Recalcitrant indigenous peoples often ran away or revolted, and many missions maintained a precarious existence during the colonial era. Use of firearms, corporal punishment in the form of whippings and religious ritual and psychological punishments were all methods employed by the missionaries to maintain and expand control.Jackson, Robert H., 1981, Epidemic Disease and Population Decline in the Baja California Missions, 1697-1834. Southern California Quarterly 63:308-346. Downloaded from JSTOR. There were instances of armed resistance by the Indians against the missions, notably the Pericue revolt of 1734-1737, and Indians at the missions frequently ran away to escape the religious and labor regime forced on them by the missionaries or sabotaged the missionary's efforts by passive resistance.Jackson, Robert H.

At the time of first contact with the Spanish, the Native Americans living in Baja California may have numbered as many as 60,000. By 1762, their numbers had fallen to 21,000 and by 1800 to 5,900. The primary reason for the decline was recurrent epidemics of European diseases, primarily smallpox, measles, and typhus. The spread of disease was facilitated by the missionary's practice of congregating the population near the mission. Endemic Syphilis resulted in higher child mortality and a reduced birth rate. By the early 19th century, the tribes of Baja California were culturally extinct, except for the Kumeyaay, Cocopah, and Pai Pai.Jackson, Robert H.

However, it was Hernán Cortés who recognized the peninsula as the \\"Island of California\\" in May 1535, and is therefore officially credited with the discovery. In January 1683, the Spanish government chartered an expedition consisting of three ships to transport a contingent of 200 men to the southern tip of Baja California. Under the command of the governor of Sinaloa, Isidoro de Atondo y Antillón, and accompanied by Jesuit priest Eusebio Francisco Kino, the ships made landfall in La Paz. The landing party was eventually forced to abandon its initial settlement due to the hostile response on the part of the natives. The missionaries attempted to establish a settlement near present-day Loreto, which they named Misión San Bruno but failed for lack of supplies.Burckhalter et al, p. 17; Bolton, 1936 Kino went on to establish a number of missions in the Pimería Alta, now located in southern Arizona, USA and Sonora, Mexico. The Jesuit priest Juan María de Salvatierra eventually managed to establish the first permanent Spanish settlement in Baja California, the Misión Nuestra Señora de Loreto Conchó. Founded on October 19, 1697, the mission become the religious center of the peninsula and administrative capital of Las Californias. From there, other Jesuits went out to establish other settlements throughout the lower two-thirds of the peninsula, founding 17 missions and several visitas (sub-missions) between 1697 and 1767.Crosby, Harry W. (1994), Antigua California, Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, pp. 20-26, p.179 Unlike the mainland settlements that were designed to be self-sustaining enterprises, the remote and harsh conditions on the peninsula made it all but impossible to build and maintain these missions without ongoing assistance from the mainland. Supply lines from across the Gulf of California, including from the missions and ranches of Padre Eusebio Kino on the mainland to the Port of Guaymas, played a crucial role in keeping the Baja California mission system intact. During the sixty years that the Jesuits were permitted to work among the natives of California, 56 members of the Society of Jesus came to the Baja California peninsula, of whom 16 died at their posts (two as martyrs). Fifteen priests and one lay brother survived the hardships, only to be subjected to enforcement of the decree launched against the Society by King Carlos III of Spain.Robert Michael Van Handel, \\"The Jesuit and Franciscan Missions in Baja California.\\" M.A. thesis. University of California, Santa Barbara, 1991. It was rumored that the Jesuit priests had amassed a fortune on the peninsula and were becoming very powerful. On February 3, 1768 the King ordered the Jesuits forcibly expelled from the Americas and returned to the home country. Gaspar de Portolà was appointed Governor of Las Californias, with orders to supervise the Jesuit expulsion and oversee the installation of replacement Franciscan priests.Engelhardt, pp. 275-77 The Franciscans, under the leadership of Fray Junípero Serra, took charge of the missions and closed or consolidated several of the existing installations. A total of 39 Friars Minor toiled on the peninsula during the five years and five months of Franciscan rule. Four of them died, 10 were transferred to new northern missions, and the remainder returned to Europe.Robert Michael Van Handel, \\"The Jesuit and Franciscan Missions in Baja California.\\" M.A. thesis. University of California, Santa Barbara, 1991. Governor Portolà was put in command of an expedition to travel north and establish new settlements at San Diego and Monterey. Serra went along as leader of the missionaries, to establish missions in those places.Engelhardt, pp. 3-18 On the way north, Serra founded Misión San Fernando Rey de España de Velicatá. Francisco Palóu was left in charge of the existing missions, and founded the Visita de la Presentación in 1769. Representatives of the Dominican order arrived in 1772, and by 1800, had established nine more missions in northern Baja, all the while continuing with the administration of the former Jesuit missions. The peninsula was divided into two separate entities in 1804, with the southern one having the seat of government established in the Port of Loreto. In 1810, Mexico sought to end Spanish colonial rule, gaining her independence in 1821, after which Mexican President Guadalupe Victoria named Lt. Col. José María Echeandía governor of Baja California Sur and divided it into four separate municipios (municipalities). The capital was moved to La Paz in 1830, after Loreto was partially destroyed by heavy rains. In 1833, after Baja California was designated as a federal territory, the governor formally put an end to the mission system by converting the missions into parish churches.

History Local name published in 1898 by USC&GS.; Location (1334) Little Susitna River, West of Point MacKenzie, is said to be navigable for landing craft and skiffs at high water for about . (1335) Caution: the depths offshore and in the approach to Little Susitna River are subject to drastic and continual change. The Little Susitna River is a river in Alaska. It originates in Hatcher Pass, at , in the Talkeetna Mountains which form the northern boundary of the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. It flows a few dozen miles to the Cook Inlet. It contains a variety of hydrology ranging from flat water near the inlet to class 5 water in Hatcher Pass. It is bridged by Fishook Road in Hatcher Pass, Edgerton Parks Road, Welch Road, George Parks Highway, Sushanna Road, and Schrock Road. It flooded in 1972 and again in August 2006, and September 2012 reaching a volume of over , causing minor damage to homes and infrastructure. It is fed by the mint glacier, Archangel Creek, Fishhook Creek, Government Creek, Nurse Creek, Mary Creek, Swiftwater creek, and numerous other unnamed streams. Popular activities along the river include camping, fishing, wildlife viewing and photography, and hunting.  Access  The river begins in Hatcher Pass, a state recreation area that was originally opened by hard rock mining. This area still has active gold mines and is also open for recreational mining. Much of the land between Hatcher Pass and the George Parks Highway bridge is privately owned, while most of the land below the George Parks Highway Bridge is owned by the state. The George Parks Highway crosses the river at RM 69.5 and parallels the river for about a mile (1.6 km). 42 river miles down stream there is the Little Susitna Public Use Facility, which offers camping and boating access approximately south of Wasilla. This campground/boat launch lies within the Susitna Flats State Game Refuge on the pristine Little Susitna River. There are 3 major whitewater runs on the Su. Upper little su (above motherlode) is class 4+, Lower su Motherlode to fishhook bridge is class 4+, and Baby Su (Fishhook bridge to edgerton park bridge) is 3-. Mostly characterized by clear cold water flowing over rounded granite boulders and drops of moderate size. Normally ran at flows of 350-900 cfs on the little su gauge. Below the Carneyville bridge to the inlet is all class 1 floating. Normal summer flows can range from 80-1200 cfs. Floods can bring 4500 cfs of water or more.  Fishing  The Alaska Department of Fish and Game operates a weir to count King, Red, Coho, and Chum salmon in the river. The Little Susitna River weir is located a short distance upstream from the Public Use Area off Burma Road. Salmon fishing is closed upstream of the George Parks Highway. The Little Susitna River provides a multitude of sport angling opportunities. King, silver, chum, red, and pink salmon are available, as well as some Dolly Varden and rainbow trout. Several other less targeted species such as Arctic grayling, burbot, round whitefish and northern pike also call the Little Susitna River home.

Sheet Harbour is a rural community on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. It is located in the eastern reaches of the Halifax Regional Municipality, approximately northeast of the central urban area of the municipality, concentrated on Downtown Halifax and Dartmouth. The community is located along the Marine Drive scenic route on Trunk 7 at its junctions with Route 224 and Route 374. Surrounding the branched harbour which its name is derived from, the community has a population of about 800 and its respective census tract, containing sizable amounts of land around the community, has a population of 3,478 as of the 2011 Census. Two rivers, West River and East River, flow through the community and into the Northwest and Northeast Arms of the harbour respectively. The coastline of the community is heavily eroded and the region in which the community is located has an abundance of lakes. The region has a humid continental climate, congruent with the majority of Nova Scotia, and the ocean significantly influences the temperature. The majority of the land that the community occupies was granted in 1773, and a colony was established thereafter in 1784 by Loyalist refugees and British veterans of the American Revolution. The mi'kmaq referred to the area as Weijooik, meaning \\"flowing wildly\\". The settlement was labelled as \\"Port North\\" on the Royal Navy Chart published in 1778, and retained this name until 1805. Alternate names such as Campbelltown and Manchester were proposed for the settlement, but the name was ultimately changed to Sheet Harbour, named for a rock at the entrance to the harbour resembling a sheet, to provide a more descriptive name for the settlement. Sheet Harbour became a prosperous hub for the lumber industry. A sawmill was built around 1863 at the tide head of East River, though its operating company dissolved a few years later due to financial issues. The first sulphide pulp mill in Canada was built in 1885 at East River. The mill closed in 1891 due to the cost of importing sulphide. The first bank in Sheet Harbour, a branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia, was built in 1921. The establishment was moved to a new building in 1929, and again in 1959. Electrical lines were first run into the community in late 1925. A ground-wood pulp mill owned by the American Pulp and Wrapping Paper Co. of Albany, New York produced its first ground-wood pulp on October 5, 1925. Located along West River near its mouth at the head of the Northwest Arm, the mill remained in operation until it was destroyed by Hurricane Beth in 1971. The first efforts to bring a hospital to Sheet Harbour began in the mid 1940s sparked by Duncan MacMillan, a longtime physician in the area. The project was given unanimous approval at subsequent meetings, and Leslie R. Fairn was enlisted as the architect, as well as John Smiley and later Robert MacDonald, as contractors. Construction began in 1947 and the Eastern Shore Memorial Hospital was opened on May 24, 1949, with a ceremony in which Premier Angus L. MacDonald officiated. It was operated as an outpost hospital by the Canadian Red Cross until 1954, after which the local residents operated it until 1959. The hospital has been operated by the Nova Scotia Government thereafter. The East River Bridge was built across the Northeast Arm in 1957 to replace its predecessor. It was a long green arch bridge and its ribs were reinforced heavily in 1988. It was replaced by a long multi-span bridge of the same name which began construction in 2014 and opened fully on December 18, 2015. Duncan MacMillan High School, the only school in Sheet Harbour and the only secondary school in the Sheet Harbour area, was opened in 1963. A new school is currently under construction which will serve grades primary through twelve and will be the only school in the region. Sidewalks were laid through the main downtown area and moorings were installed in the harbour in 2010 and 2017 respectively. A deep-water dock and accompanying industrial park was built in the 1990s on the western shore of the harbour. It serviced the Sable Offshore Energy Project, due to it being the closest terminal to the project, and is in close proximity to major intercontinental shipping routes. Several franchises have establishments in Sheet Harbour, including Foodland, Home Hardware and the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission. An RCMP detachment and a branch of the Halifax Public Libraries are present within the community as well, along with the aforementioned hospital and high school. Geography Location Sheet Harbour is a small rural community located on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, in the eastern area of the Halifax Regional Municipality. Sheet Harbour is located slightly more northward compared to other coastal communities in the area, due to the shape of the harbour. The population of the census tract for the Sheet Harbour area is 3,478 as of the 2011 Census. Census tracts are small divisions of land that are used for statistics gathering by Statistics Canada that usually have a population of 2,500 to 8,000. Each census tract has a numerical designation. The population of the community proper is about 800. West of Sheet Harbour lies Sheet Harbour 36, a small Mi'kmaq reserve. The community of Sheet Harbour is located along the shores of the harbour of the same name, a branched saltwater harbour. Extending from the convergence of the two arms below Church Point, the wider Northwest Arm travels until it meets the mouth of West River at the West River Falls. There is a very small island in the arm. Six moorings were installed in the arm in the Spring of 2017. The Northeast Arm is the more narrow arm and extends generally northeastward under the East River Bridge until it meets the mouth of the East River. Beyond the convergence of the arms, the harbour is known as Sheet Harbour. It is wider than both arms and is approximately eleven to fifteen metres (36–49 ft) deep at low tide. The harbour gradually widens as it travels southeastward toward the Atlantic, passing the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port as well as the small community of Watt Section. The area around Sheet Harbour is heavily forested and rich in lakes. The shore is very rocky and eroded, as is commonplace on the Eastern Shore. Sheet Harbour has an average tidal range of about . Rivers Several rivers and small streams empty into the arms of the harbour. West River begins near Beaver Dam. The main branch of the river is about long. The river has two secondary branches, the Killag River, which is long, and Little River, which is long. Many lakes and ponds in the region flow into the river through numerous smaller rivers and streams. The river flows through Sheet Harbour Lake, and narrows back in to a river near the West River Bridge, where Trunk 7 passes over the West River. The West River Falls carry the river from elevation down to sea level, where it empties into the Northwest Arm. The river area has been deforested and is prone to flash-flooding. Sheet Harbour was the first community in North America to use a lime doser on one of its rivers. which sprays limestone into the water to stabilize pH levels. Dosing began in September 2005 in West River. It was successful in stabilizing the pH of the river at 5.5, a healthy level for salmon and other aquatic life. Grand Lake, a large lake west of Sheet Harbour, also empties into the Northwest Arm via West Lake and Little West River in West Sheet Harbour. The river flows into the Northwest Arm via West Cove. East River, formally East River Sheet Harbour, is the other main river that discharges into the harbour. Originating in the Marshall Flowage, the river flows southward past the Ruth Falls Power Plant, a hydropower generating station. It narrows back into a river for the remainder of its watercourse, then flows into the head of the Northeast Arm. Climate The closest weather station to Sheet Harbour is in Malay Falls, about northeast of the community. As with most of the province, Sheet Harbour has a humid continental climate, and the temperature is heavily influenced by the ocean. History 18th and 19th centuries Almost all of the present land area of Sheet Harbour was granted in 1773, and the settlement was established around 1784, by Loyalist refugees and British veterans of the American Revolution and became a prosperous centre for the lumber industry. The Mi'kmaq name for the area was Weijooik, which translates to \\"flowing wildly\\". Sheet Harbour was named \\"Port North\\" on the Royal Navy Chart that was published in 1778. In January 1805, the ship Salisbury was wrecked off of Sheet Harbour and nine of the crew were lost.Naval Chronicles, Vol. 14, p. 263 The settlement was referred to as Port North until 1807. Alternate names for the settlement were Campbelltown and Manchester. Campbelltown would have been named after Lord William Campbell, who was a Captain General as well as a Governor-in- Chief from 1776–73. It was decided that \\"Port North\\" was not descriptive enough, so the name was changed to Sheet Harbour, starting in 1818 because of a white, flat rock at the entrance to the harbour that looks like a sheet, named Sheet Rock. The population of the settlement in 1818 was 156. A church was built soon after the founding of the settlement, but was in a state of disrepair by 1815. A new church was built on the site by 1837. Around 1863, a sawmill was built at the tide head of the East River Sheet Harbour, by Demming and McFarlane, a lumber company. However, they did not succeed financially, and they dissolved a few years later. Another church was constructed in the community in 1860 and a post office was opened in the community in May 1873. New schools were built in 1867 at Sheet Harbour and East River, and at West Sheet Harbour in the 1870s. A Freemasons hall was built at Church Point in 1869. In October 1885, the Halifax Wood Fibre Company built the first sulphide pulp mill in Canada at East River, Sheet Harbour. Since the discovery of the sulphite process happened earlier in 1866, the news had traveled to William Chisholm, who was a lumber manufacturer in Halifax. Chisholm decided to test the method at the head of East River. He had 60 thousand acres (24,281 hectares, or 242 km2) of woodland on the Sheet Harbour rivers. The mill closed in January 1891, due to the high costs of importing sulphide from the United States. The cookhouse which was used at the mill was bought by the residents of Watt Section and was floated down the harbour to the community. A bridge was built over East River and was opened on January 15, 1889. A school was constructed at East River in 1897. 20th century A school was built at West River in 1903 to replace its predecessor which was destroyed in a fire. A new Freemasons hall was built in the same year, and its predecessor became a Sunday school. The first bank in Sheet Harbour, a branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia, was opened in 1921. The branch still exists, however it is operated from a different building than the original. The second location of the bank, a two-storey building, was built in 1929. The present location of the bank was built in 1959. In 1922, a ground-wood pulp mill, owned by the American Pulp and Wrapping Paper Co. of Albany, began operation on the West River at the head of the Northwest Arm of Sheet Harbour. They had purchased it from the previous owners who were a lumber company. In 1925, the company had the Fairchild Aerial Survey Company of the United States take aerial photographs of the company limits, as well as the adjoining Crown land. This was the first aerial survey done by a company in Nova Scotia. The mill produced its first ground-wood pulp on October 5, 1925. It remained in operation until it was destroyed by Hurricane Beth in August 1971. The first electrical lines were run into Sheet Harbour in the fall of 1925. The first line ran along the shore and was an offshoot of the line that ran to the mill, which received its power from the Ruth Falls power plant along East River. A second line was built in 1928 along the west side of the highway to provide street lighting. A lighting ceremony was held after all of the houses in the community has been wired. The first efforts were made to establish a hospital in Sheet Harbour in the spring of 1945. The effort was sparked by Duncan MacMillan, a doctor who had been serving the Sheet Harbour area for about 20 years at the time. A meeting was held in early 1946 at the Masonic Hall in Sheet Harbour. Representatives of the Nova Scotia branch of the Canadian Red Cross were in attendance. The plan was given unanimous approval at the meeting and steps were taken to organize an official hospital board, which was incorporated in March 1946 by the Nova Scotia Legislature. An enthusiastic funding campaign was started afterward. The hospital board then engaged an architect, Leslie R. Fairn, to design the hospital. The plans called for a 21-bed Georgian style building. John Smiley was engaged as the contractor for the project, and was later succeeded by Robert MacDonald. The old East River Bridge in June 2008, which was built in 1956 and demolished in 2016. Construction began in 1947. The total cost of construction was $170,000, with $34,000 contributed by the provincial and federal governments, while the remaining $136,000 was contributed by the residents of the Sheet Harbour area. The Eastern Shore Memorial Hospital was opened with an official ceremony on May 24, 1949, which Premier Angus L. MacDonald officiated. The Canadian Red Cross equipped the hospital and ran it as an outpost hospital from its opening until July 15, 1954. The responsibility of the hospital was then shifted to the residents of the area, and administered by the hospital board. The hospital came under the plan of the Nova Scotia Hospital Insurance Commission on January 1, 1959. It has been administered under that plan up to the present day. Sheet Harbour Consolidated School in 2008. A two-room elementary school was built around 1955 at East River. The population of Sheet Harbour in 1956 was 1,073. A steel arch bridge, named the East River Bridge, was built in 1956 over the Northeast Arm. The bridge opened to traffic in December 1957. It was a green bridge which had a half-through, two-hinge type arch, as well as a built-up box-cross section for support. The bridge was in length, with a main span of . It spanned the Northeast Arm of Sheet Harbour, just north of the new bridge. The structure had engineering ties with the Angus L. MacDonald Bridge in Halifax. The deck carried the two lanes of Trunk 7, and was hung from the arch by vertical steel hangers. The ribs of the bridge were reinforced heavily in 1988. Sheet Harbour Consolidated School (SHCS) was an elementary school in the community. It was built in 1957, and served grades primary through six. In the 1990s, the Government of Nova Scotia built a common user deep water dock and industrial park just west of Sheet Harbour, named the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port. It is currently operated by the Halifax Port Authority. It currently ships wood chips for the pulp industry and imports wind turbine segments, which are then transported across Nova Scotia and to the rest of North America. The port was used to service the Sable Offshore Energy Project with natural gas pipes processed at coating plant therefore making them suitable for placement on the ocean floor. The port is the closest marine terminal to the fields, at a distance of . It is also approximately west of the Great Circle Route, a major shipping route between North America and Europe. The docking area is long and wide. It also has of draft, which is connected to a concrete pad. 21st century The new East River Bridge shortly after opening. The old bridge is visible in the background, as the green arch. Sidewalks were built through the main downtown area of Sheet Harbour in 2010. They cost approximately $2.9 million (US$2.4 million). Watts Wind Energy, Inc. built a wind turbine in Watt Section, a small community east of Sheet Harbour. It was the outcome of favourable wind data that was obtained by a meteorological tower near the future site of the wind turbine. It was constructed in 2010 and was producing power by October 2011. It stands tall and produces about 1.5 MW of electricity, powering 375 households. DMHS in June 2017. A motion was put forward to the former Halifax Regional School Board in 2012 to review the schools within the Duncan MacMillan High catchment area. The review was conducted and concerns were raised about the aging facilities as well as a high transfer rate and commute time for faculty. Boundary changes were proposed - the catchment area was the largest in the board - but proved highly unpopular among the populous. The HRSB publicly announced the project to build a new P-12 school in the Sheet Harbour area on December 23, 2013. Three sites in and around Sheet Harbour were proposed, but it was decided in 2016 to construct the facility on the then current ground of SHCS and DMHS. SHCS was closed in 2017 to provide clearance for the new structure. Lakefront Consolidated Elementary in Tangier was closed in 2019 as a part of the consolidation process associated with the plan. Students from both schools were amalgamated into DMHS soon thereafter. 61 potential names for the new school were submitted by the public in the collection period from February to March of 2019. The list was narrowed down to two definite candidates, though consensus could not be reached on a third and the two names were put to a vote. Students of DMHS and LCS voted in April 2019 on the third submission. From the top three names, the name selected for the new facility by the associated naming committee was Marine Drive Academy. The East River Bridge was built from 2014 through 2015 to replace its predecessor of the same name. The Nova Scotia Government had proposed minor repairs, but they decided that an entirely new bridge would be more cost-effective. The new bridge was designed, unlike its predecessor, without large, overhead steel arches, because it would have been twice as expensive to build. The new bridge was constructed on the same site as the old bridge's predecessor which was constructed just south of the East River Bridge in 1907. The bridge cost $19,000,000 (US$14,671,644) to build and construction began in September 2014. The contractor, Dexter Construction, poured 2,260 cubic metres (79,811 cubic feet) of concrete over of rebar. The new bridge relies on two pillars set in the granite below the Northeast Arm. A deck, along with railings and sidewalks, were laid when it was nearing completion. The bridge was officially opened on December 17, 2015 to pedestrians and opened the next day to traffic. Road adjustments were made on the Sheet Harbour side of the bridge to accommodate it. Trunk 7 was aligned with what was formerly Riverside Drive, Church Point Road and Pool Road were slightly modified and the access road to Duncan MacMillan High School was slightly modified as well. Sprott Lane, a minor loop, was extended along a part of the old Trunk 7 for a few households. Shortly after the new bridge was opened, the old East River Bridge was closed and was demolished through 2016. Economy The beginning of the Seaside Festival parade, August 9, 2008. The Sheet Harbour post office in 2013. The MacPhee House Museum and Visitor Information Centre, located on the grounds of the old mill. Eastern Shore Memorial Hospital serves the Sheet Harbour area. Construction began in 1947, and the hospital was opened on May 24, 1949. It is administered by the Nova Scotia Health Authority. It has sixteen beds for patients. There is a cenotaph and gardens in front of the site where Duncan MacMillan Nursing Home (DMNH) previously stood. The hospital offers several services and is connected to Harbourview Lodge through a corridor. Harbourview Lodge was built in 2011 to replace DMNH, which was nearing the end of its life span. The community also has a local radio station, broadcasting on 94.7 FM as Sheet Harbour Radio. Sheet Harbour has a Chamber of Commerce. It was formed in 1935, and was formerly known as the Sheet Harbour Board of Trade. They comprise more than 25 of the businesses in the Sheet Harbour area and they also operate a Visitor Information Centre at the MacPhee House, situated on the site of the ground-wood pulp mill just east of the West River Bridge, where Trunk 7 crosses the West River at the entrance to Sheet Harbour. There is a community museum at the MacPhee House and they have a collection interpreting \\"Life before plastic\\". Sheet Harbour also has an RCMP detachment and a fire station, as well as a Ground Search and Rescue team. The community also hosts a Foodland grocery store, a Home Hardware store, an NSLC liquor store, a post office and a branch of the Halifax Public Libraries. Sheet Harbour also has three gas stations. Eastern Shore Cartage serves the area. The community is home to a Scotiabank branch as well as a branch of the East Coast Credit Union. A park surrounds the West River Falls, and there are two motels in the community as well. There is also a campground in the community, which is located near the mouth of the East River. Taylor Head Provincial Park is located ten minutes west of Sheet Harbour. Every August, the \\"Seaside Festival\\" is hosted by the local Lions Club. The 2610 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps is based in Sheet Harbour. They were originally formed on October 1, 1957, but were disbanded on December 31, 1973. Twelve years later, the corps was reformed on February 1, 1985 and is still active today. They have won the Strathcona cup, an award that is given to the best performing cadet corps in Nova Scotia, five times. Duncan MacMillan High School is the only school in the Sheet Harbour area. The school was built in 1963. The school teaches grades primary through twelve and offers Integrated French for grades seven through twelve. As of 2018, there are 249 students enrolled at DMHS.

It originates in British Columbia, near Haines Highway. It flows north into Yukon, then it turns west and south before it returns into British Columbia, where it flows through the Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Wilderness Park. There it joins the Alsek River, which then flows into the Pacific Ocean in Alaska, United States. It is popular for wilderness rafting trips. History This river was used as a vital trade route by First Nations, in particular the coastal Tlingit people. The first Europeans to travel the present-day Tatshenshini River were Jack Dalton and Edward Glave in 1890, accompanied by two native guides. Prior to 1891, the present-day Tatshenshini River was considered to be the upper Alsek River., at pp. 15, 18-19 (“All-segh'”; “Katch-kwae-wugh”; “Ta-tchan-seena”). (At that time, the present-day upper Alsek River was considered to be the lower Kaskawulsh River.) In or about 1891, the present-day Tatshenshini River (pre-1891 upper Alsek River) was assigned the name Tatshenshini by the Canadian government, and the pre-1891 lower Kaskawulsh River became the present-day upper Alsek River.The Canadian government assigned the name Alsek to the present-day Alsek River in 1891. , at page 19 (Alsek River). It is presumed that the Canadian government assigned the name Tatshenshini to the present-day Tatshenshini River at the same time. At the very latest, the change had occurred by 1898. About 1897, Jack Dalton established a trading post near the location where the present-day Tatshenini begins to flow westward. This trading post flourished during the Klondike Gold Rush. Today, the site of Dalton's trading post is a popular location for salmon fishermen, and it is the launch point for rafting trips on the Tatshenshini River. The Tatshenshini River was designated a Canadian Heritage River in 2004. Etymology Localised rain shower on the river Prior to 1891, the name Tatshenshini did not refer to the present-day Tatshenshini River. Instead, the name referred to the present-day Blanchard River, which is a tributary of the present-day Tatshenshini River, located about upstream from Dalton's trading post. In 1891, or shortly thereafter, the Canadian government reassigned the name Tatshenshini from the present-day Blanchard River to the present-day Tatshenshini River. Apparently, the government did this without knowledge of the English translation of tatshenshini. The name Tatshenshini is derived from a Tlingit phrase, the meaning of which was not recorded., at page 253 (Tatschants-hīni). ( The original 1885 German edition at page 383, Tatschants- hīni) However, the original phrase appears to have been t’áchán shahéeni, a compound Tlingit noun meaning river with stinking chinook (king) salmon at its headwaters (t’á [chinook or king salmon] + chán [stink] + sha [head of] + héen [river] + i [possessed noun suffix] )., at pp. i (i=possessed noun suffix), 1-6 (chán), 1-24 (héen), 1-40 (shá), 1-44 (t’á), 2-27 (head of), 2-46 (river), 2-47 (chinook [king] salmon), 2-56 (stink). (Since a stink [chán] is always created by something, no possessed noun suffix is needed following chán.) The Tlingit phrase t’áchán shahéeni describes the present-day Blanchard River (pre-1891 Tatshenshini River). Chinook (king) salmon run up the present-day Tatshenshini River to the Blanchard River and, thence, up the Blanchard River.After the present-day Blanchard River lost the name Tatshenshini (presumably, in 1891) until 1915 (when it was assigned its present-day name), the Blanchard River was known as Bear Creek. (The Blanchard River was not known as Kleheela; Kleheela was a variant name for the Klehini River, which flows into the Chilkat River.) Annual Report of Inspector A. M. Javis at page 100, App. H., Part 3, Annual Report of North-west Mounted Police 1898, reproduced at, Sessional Papers Vol. 15, 8th Parliament, 4th Sess. (1899) (Kleheela River is south of summit and south of Rainy Hollow; salmon go up Bear Creek to spawn; present-day Tatshenshini River is referred to as “Alsac,” a variation of its original name). At the headwaters (shahéen) of the Blanchard River, the salmon (t’á) die, and their carcasses stink (chán). These headwaters were on the old Tlingit trail and trade route between Haines, Alaska and Lake Kusawa, Yukon., at page 214 (map: “Tatschanzhīni”).

It is a part of the metropolitan region of the city of Rio de Janeiro and was created in 1990. Its population was 508,614 in 2018 and its area is 79 km². Belford Roxo is not one of the richest and wealthiest cities in the state, due to its low GDP and relatively high population. Its climate is tropical with an average temperature of 18 °C (63 °F). Bayer and Lubrizol are the biggest companies in the municipality. It was named after Engineer Raimundo Teixeira Belfort Roxo. While serving as General Construction and Building Inspector for the city of Rio de Janeiro, Engineer Belfort Roxo, together with Engineer Paulo de Frontin, solved the water shortage problems of the area during the summer of 1889. The city gained fame from the samba school Lambs of Belford Roxo, parading annually in the carnival of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Currently the municipality is the seventh most populous of Rio de Janeiro, with 479,386 inhabitants, according to IBGE estimates for 2014, and has the 14th largest state GDP, with 3.539.442.000 thousand. Nevertheless, its per capita income in 2008 was R $7,140.38, one of the state's low. When comparing social indicators with other cities in the state, as Niterói and Petrópolis, it is clear that the municipality provides basic services infrastructure, with lower standards than other neighboring municipalities. Its HDI is 0.684, which despite being considered average by calculating the IBGE / 2010, according to UN standards is critically below the average of the state of Rio de Janeiro (0768), and the national average (0744 ).  History  Old Belford-Roxo, 1872. A few years after the expulsion of the French, the governor of Rio de Janeiro, Christopher de Barros, gave the captain Belchior Azeredo one sesmaria on the river Sarapuí, in the old village of Jacutingas Indians. There, he founded the Santo Antônio mill Jacutinga, which in the future would be the current municipality of Belford Roxo. A shrine to St. Anthony was built on a hillside 750 meters from the river bank Sarapuí, near the site established for port activities. At the dawn of the seventeenth century, the Holy mill Antonio Jacutinga was dismembered, appearing then the maxambomba mill (Nova Iguaçu) and the ingenuity of Poce (Tenure). In the eighteenth century, a new break (this time in maxambomba the mill lands) has raised the Caxoeira mill (Mosque), on land that belonged to the governor of Rio de Janeiro Salvador de Sá. For over two hundred years, the land remained, by hereditary succession, under the control of the heirs of Salvador de Sá, the Vasques Correia family. In the middle of that eighteenth century, the lands of the San Antonio sugar mill again be dismembered for the formation of new devices: the Brejo and Sarapuí. In the same period, the lands of maxambomba ingenuity were dismembered for the formation of Madureira ingenuity. In 1767, in a topographic map of the captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, made by Manuel Vieira Lion, appears clearly in this region the ingenuity of Brejo. Its first occupant was Christopher Mendes Leitão, in 1739. The Baixada Fluminense is cut by Sarapuí River and was surrounded by marshes and swamps. Had in his bank, a port for flow of production: sugar, rice, beans, corn and brandy. After a succession of owners in 1815, Father Miguel Arcanjo Leitão, who owned the land and sold them to the first Viscount of Barbacena, Felisberto Caldeira Brant, future Marquis of Barbacena. In 1843, Peter Brant, the Comte de Iguaçu - son of the first Viscount and Marquis of Barbacena - took over the farm after his father's death, which occurred in the city of Rio de Janeiro on July 13, 1842. In 1851, Brant Boiler family sold their farm to the Commander Manuel José Coelho da Rocha. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the estate fell into decay due to the occurrence of epidemics. The laying of tracks for crossing the Rio d'Ouro railway, cutting the farm Heath in 1872 on land donated by the Rock Rabbit descendants, began a movement claiming to turn it on railway line passengers, as previously, this railway was built to capture water in Tinguá saws, Rio d'Ouro and San Pedro, with placement of aqueducts along its margin.  Geography  Occupying an area of 79.791 square kilometers, Belford Roxo currently has 481,127 inhabitants, it is the seventh most populous city in the state. The municipal seat has the following geographical coordinates: 22º 45 '50 \\"South Latitude and 43º 26' 56\\" West Longitude. Located in the Baixada Fluminense, in the micro region of Rio de Janeiro, is limited to the municipalities of: Nova Iguaçu and Mesquita (west); Saint Johns Wood (South); and Duque de Caxias (east).  Relief  The topography of the city is presented as gently rugged, with many hills. The maximum altitude is approximately 121 meters. In the southern and northern part of town, there are elevations on the east and west side, with the north APA Alto Iguaçu (Environmental Protection Area) and Maringa-Recantus APA, a part with several preserved vegetation hills.  Vegetation  The vegetation consisted of swamps and marshes and across the Baixada Fluminense. Also along the lines of Baixada, it was almost all cleared to give way to the city. Much of the north of Belford Roxo is occupied by extensive forests, on the border with the municipalities of Duque de Caxias and Nova Iguaçu, a place called as Iguaçuana Forest, it is where the river flows into Boots on the Iguaçu River. It is where it is located the Maringa-Recantus APA. Currently 3.34% of the county soil are secondary vegetation; 5.62% are areas of fields and pasture and 85.20% of the territory are urban area.  Hydrography  The city is located in the Hydrographic Region 5 of the State of Rio de Janeiro, covering the basins of the rivers that are born on the slopes of Serra do Mar, in the hills and in coastal massifs, flowing into the bay. The basin of the Iguaçu River has two major tributaries to the city: the rivers Boots and Sarapuí. Draining an area of 726 square kilometers and covering the municipalities of Belford Roxo, Duque de Caxias, Nilópolis, Nova Iguaçu, Rio de Janeiro and São João de Meriti, the watershed of the Iguaçu River has its headwaters located in Sierra Tinguá; its course develops in the southwest direction, with a total length of 43 km and flowing into the bay. The Capivari, Pati and Tinguá on the left bank and right bank Botasà are the main tributaries of the Iguaçu River. Rivers most important city are: Iguaçu, Boots, Sarapuí, Velhas, Outeiro, Silver and maxambomba. The quality of rivers and Boots Sarapuí, according to CONAMA, are classified as Class 2: are water bodies that can be used for domestic supply, if they are treated conventionally. With proper care, these waters are also suitable for the protection of aquatic communities, primary contact recreation, fruit plants and irrigation of vegetables, and natural creation and / or intensive species for human consumption. However, these rivers are very polluted, being compared to sewage ditches in the open, with indicative serious organic and faecal pollution and heavy metals such as nickel and lead. According FEEMA, it appears, also, the presence of cadmium, chromium and iron.  Climate  The climate is tropical presenting average monthly temperatures between 21 °C and 27 °C, with an annual average of 26 °C. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Belford Roxo, was 6 °C, in July 2000. The annual rainfall fi ed around 1,229 mm. The most rainy season starts in November and ends in March, and the driest is from June to August. Because it is situated near the Tropic of Capricorn, the Baixada Fluminense is influenced by winds from the Amazon and the Atlantic Ocean. And to be a marshland, the winds do not hit much at ground height, increasing the sensation of heat, with temperatures often rising from 30 °C  Demography  The municipality of Belford Roxo has an area of 77.815 square kilometers. The urban area of the municipality accounted for approximately 64.7738 square kilometers, or 85.20% of its area in 2000. In 2010, they lived in Belford Roxo, 469,261 inhabitants, divided into 226,757 men and 242,504 women, according to IBGE surveys in 2010, but the Ministry of Health increases that number by 5% when funds are transferred from the Single System health for the city, raising it to 492,724 residents. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Belford Roxo had 302,637 voters in 2010. For 2014, the population is estimated at 479,386. Belford Roxo has since the 60s, more than 100 thousand inhabitants, a number that many municipalities still have failed to achieve, as we can see in the chart below. The Municipal Human Development Index (HDI) of Belford Roxo is considered average by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and its value to 0.684. Although it is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, which has the 4th highest HDI in Brazil, the value of the city index is below the state average (0.768), and country (0.744). There is still a wide disparity in social indicators of the municipality and other neighboring localities, revealing a history of abandonment, and regional inequality. The per capita income is real 7140.38, the literacy rate is 91.99% and life expectancy is 67.64 years. The gross rate of school attendance is 78.01%, [22] The incidence of poverty in 2003, measured by the IBGE, was 60%. and the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality, was 0 , 49 in 2000, and 1.00 is the worst number and 0.00 is the best.

Its programs include its flagship symphony orchestra, Chamber Music program, Jazz Band Classic, Apprentice Conducting, and Making Score (composition program). Its members range from 12 to 22 years of age. The Youth Symphony is also a leader in classical music with its innovative commissioning program called First Music, established in 1984, in which young composers under the age of 30 are selected to write works for the programs. Commissions have included composers such as David Lang, Augusta Read Thomas, Julia Wolfe, and Aaron Jay Kernis. Each Orchestra program (there are three each year) includes such a world premiere. There is also a First Art commissioning program for young visual artists. NYYS members are said to include the most talented young musicians in the New York area. The Youth Symphony consists of young musicians from the New York metropolitan area, and has them perform before their careers hit full stride. The orchestra rehearses under the supervision of New York Philharmonic members, and performs at Carnegie Hall, Merkin Hall, Lincoln Center, and local colleges. Symphony Orchestra The Orchestra, the flagship program of the NYYS, was founded in 1963. It has had a tradition of seeking the best young orchestral talent in the New York area from ages 12 to 22. The New York Times wrote: \\"its players ... are sufficiently devoted to the music that when they perform at Carnegie Hall ... they produce a sound that would do an adult orchestra proud, in programs built largely of cornerstones of the standard canon.\\" The orchestra plays three programs per year, each of which is performed at both United Palace and Carnegie Hall. The New York Times reported: \\"Its Carnegie Hall concerts are always ambitious and usually excellent\\". Each program usually includes, at least, a cornerstone of the orchestral repertoire and a premiere of a commissioned work. Usually a soloist or soloists perform, either an established artist, or a young artist as presented by the Roy and Shirley Durst Debut Series which was founded in 1997. The first Durst artist was Alisa Weilerstein.New York Youth Symphony Membership Booklet, 2008–09 For the 2010–11 season, these artists were Anthony McGill, Principal Clarinet of the Metropolitan Opera, violinist Hahn-Bin, and percussionist/composer Eric Guinivan.

There are a number of other methods of compliance, including parts manufactured to government or industry standards, parts manufactured under technical standard order authorization [TSO], owner-/operator-produced parts, experimental aircraft, field approvals, etc. 14 C.F.R. 21.9(a) PMA-holding manufacturers are permitted to make replacement parts for aircraft, even though they are not the original manufacturer of the aircraft. 14 C.F.R. 21.9(a)(2) The process is analogous to 'after-market' parts for automobiles, except that the United States aircraft parts production market remains tightly regulated by the FAA. An applicant for a PMA applies for approval from the FAA. The FAA prioritizes its review of a new application based on its internal process called Project Prioritization.See Aircraft Technology, Calnek, Matthew, December 2014, A Change of Priorities, http://www.aecotechnologies.com/wp/wp- content/uploads/2014/12/AECO_AircraftTechnology_Dec2014.pdf, Seattle, January 5, 2015. The FAA Order covering the application for PMA is Order 8110.42 revision D. This document is worded as instructions to the FAA reviewing personnel. An accompanying Advisory Circular (AC) 21.303-4 is intended to address the applicant. 8110.42C addressed both the applicant and the reviewer. Per the order, application for a PMA can be made per the following ways: Identicality in which the applicant attempts to convince the FAA that the PMA part is identical to the OAH (Original Approval Holder) part. Identicality by Licensure is accomplished by providing evidence to the FAA that the applicant has licensed the part data from the OAH. This evidence is usually in the form of an Assist Letter provided to the applicant by the OAH. PMA may also be granted based upon prior approval of an STC . As an example: If an STC were granted to alter an existing aircraft design then that approval would also apply to the parts needed to make that modification. A PMA would be required, however, to manufacture the parts. The last method to obtain a PMA is Test & Computation. This approach consist of one or a combination of both of the following methods: General Analysis and Comparative Analysis. General analysis compares the proposed part to the functional requirements of that part when installed. Comparative Analysis compares the function of the proposed part to the OAH part. As an example: If a PMA application for flight control cables were to show that the PMA part exceeds the pull strength requirements of the aircraft system it is meant for, that is general analysis. To show that it exceeds that of the OAH part is comparative analysis. The modern trend is to use a variety of techniques in combination in order to obtain approval of complicated parts - relying on the techniques that are most accurate and best able to provide the proof of airworthiness desired. Parts Manufacturer Approval Procedures, FAA Order 8110.42C, Chapter 2, Paragraph 5 (June 23, 2008) The cognizant regional FAA Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) determines if the applicant has shown compliance with all relevant airworthiness regulations and is thus entitled to design approval. The second step in the application process is to apply to the FAA Manufacturing Inspection Divisional Office (MIDO) to obtain approval of the manufacturing quality assurance system (known as production approval). Production approval will be granted when the FAA is satisfied that the system will not permit parts to leave the system until the parts have been verified to meet the requirements of the approved design, and the system otherwise meets the requirements of the FAA quality system regulations. 14 C.F.R. 21.137 A Production Approval Holder (PAH) will typically already have satisfied this requirement before PMA application is made. PMA applications based upon licensure or STC do not require ACO approval (since the data has already been approved) and can go straight to the MIDO.  History  Under the Civil Air Regulations (CARs), the government had the authority to approve aircraft parts in a predecessor to the PMA rules. This authority was found in each of the sets of airworthiness standards published in the Civil Air Regulations.See, Certification Procedures for Products and Parts, 29 Fed. Reg. 14562 (Oct. 24, 1964) (explaining in the preamble that the authority for producing parts had previously been in the \\".18\\" sections of CARs 3, 4b, 5, 6, 7, 13, and 14). CAR 3.31, for example, permitted the Administrator to approve aircraft parts as early as 1947.See 12 Fed. Reg. 7898 (1947) (promulgating Amendment 03-3 to CAR 3). In 1952, the Civil Aeronautics Board adjusted the location of the parts production authority from the \\".31\\" regulations to the \\".18\\" regulations.17 Fed. Reg. 1083 (Feb 5, 1952) (Civil Air Regulation Amendment 3-7 was effective March 5, 1952). For example, the CAR 3 authority for modification and replacement parts could be found in section 3.18 after 1952. In 1955, the Civil Aeronautics Board separated the parts authority out of the airworthiness standards, and placed it in a more general location so that one standard would apply to replacement and modification parts for all different forms of aircraft.Civil Air Regulation (CAR) 1.55 (adopted on April 13, 1956). In 1965 CAR 1.55 became Federal Aviation Regulation section 21.303.Certification Procedures for Products and Parts, 29 Fed. Reg. 14562 (Oct. 24, 1964) (this change became effective February 1, 1965). The 1965 regulatory change also imposed specific obligations on the PMA holder related to the Fabrication Inspection System.14 C.F.R. § 21.303(c) (1965). Amendment 21-38 of Part 21 was published May 26, 1972.Replacement and Modification Parts, 37 Fed. Reg. 10658 (May 26, 1972) (this change became effective June 26, 1972). This was the next rule change to affect PMAs. This rule eliminated the incorporation by reference of type certification requirements in favor of PMA-specific data submission requirements. This change established the separate process and separate requirements for data that must be submitted by an applicant for a PMA (prior to this there was no explicit distinction between the application data requirements for type certificated products and the data requirements for PMAed articles).14 C.F.R. § 21.303(c) (1973). The aircraft parts aftermarket expanded greatly in the 1980s as airlines sought to reduce the costs of spares by finding alternative sources of parts. During this time period, though, many manufacturers failed to obtain PMA approvals from the FAA. In the 1990s, the FAA engaged in an \\"Enhanced Enforcement\\" program that educated the industry about the importance of approval and as a consequence a huge number of parts were approved through formal FAA mechanisms.60 Fed. Reg. 10480 (February 27, 1995) Under this program, companies that had previously manufactured aircraft parts without PMAs could apply for PMAs in order to bring their manufacturing operations into full compliance with the regulations. This movement brought an explosion of PMA parts to the marketplace.  2009 Rule Change  The FAA published a significant revision to the U.S. manufacturing regulations on October 16, 2009. _Production and Airworthiness Approvals, Part Marking, and Miscellaneous Amendments_ , 74 Fed. Reg. 53368 (October 16, 2009) This new rule eliminates some of the legal distinctions between forms of production approval issued by the FAA, which should have the effect of further demonstrating the FAA's support of the quality systems implemented by PMA manufacturers. Specifically, instead of having a separate body of regulations for a PMA Fabrication Inspection System (FIS),14 C.F.R. 21.303(h)(2009) as was the case in prior regulations, the PMA regulations now include a cross reference to the 14 C.F.R. § 21.137,14 C.F.R. 21.137 which is the regulation defining the elements of a quality system for all production approval holders. _See_ _Production and Airworthiness Approvals, Part Marking, and Miscellaneous Amendments_ , 74 Fed. Reg. 53368, 53377 (October 16, 2009) (describing the elimination of the FIS requirements and the new cross reference to section 21.137) In practice, all production approval holders were held to the same production quality standards before the rule change _Parts Manufacturer Approval Procedures_ , FAA Order 8110.42C (June 23, 2008)  this will now be more obvious in the FAA's regulations. Accomplishing this harmonization of standards was an important goal of the Modification and Replacement Parts Association (MARPA). The new rule became effective April 16, 2011. _See_ _Production and Airworthiness Approvals, Part Marking, and Miscellaneous Amendments_ , 74 Fed. Reg. 53368, 53380 (October 16, 2009) (describing the implementation schedule, and setting the implementation date at 18 months after publication in the Federal Register) The FAA's FAQ on Part 21 stated that PMA quality systems would be evaluated for compliance by the FAA during certificate management activity after the compliance date of the rule. _FAA Questions & Answers: 14 CFR Part 21 Amendments, Subpart G – Production Certificates_, Section 21.137, Question Four (updated April 27, 2010) Today, all FAA production approvals - whether for complete aircraft or for piece parts - rely on a common set of quality assurance system elements. E.g. 14 C.F.R. §§ 21.137 (quality system requirements for production certificates), 21.307 (requiring PMA holders to establish a quality system that meets the requirements of § 21.137), 21.607 (requiring TSOA holders to establish a quality system that meets the requirements of § 21.137).  Relationship to repair  The FAA is also working on new policies concerning parts fabricated in the course of repair. This practice has historically been confused with PMA manufacturing, although the two are actually quite different practices supported by different FAA regulations.Compare 14 C.F.R. 21.9(a)(6)(authority for fabrication in the course of maintenance) with 14 C.F.R. 21.301 et seq. (PMA regulations) Today, FAA Advisory Circular 43.18 provides guidance for the fabrication of parts to be consumed purely during a maintenance operation, and additional guidance is expected to be released in the near future. One of the key features of FAC 43.18 is that it recommends implementation of a quality assurance system quite similar to the fabrication inspection systems that PMA manufacturers are required to have.  Industry association  The trade association representing the PMA industry is the Modification and Replacement Parts Association (MARPA). MARPA works closely with the FAAAgenda for the 2008 FAA-EASA International Safety Conference, in which MARPA's President (Jason Dickstein) is speaking on collaborative efforts to improve supplier control 70 Fed. Reg. 65713 (November 9, 2006)(FAA acknowledges the assistance of Jack Buster, MARPA Airworthiness Directive Committee) and other agencies to promote PMA safety. MARPA maintains a website at http://www.pmaparts.org. Developments Outside the United States The United States has Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreements (BASA) with most of its major trading partners, and the standard language of these BASAs requires the trading partner to treat FAA-PMA as an importable aircraft part that is airworthy and eligible for installation on aircraft registered in the importing jurisdiction.FAA Bilateral Agreement Listing This process has been facilitated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) which has published a book on accepting PMA parts. Guidance Material and Best Practices for Alternate Parts (PMA) and Approved (non-OEM) Repairs (DER). 2nd Edition. Although the PMA industry began in the United States, several countries have begun promoting production of approved aircraft parts within their own borders. These jurisdictions include: *AustraliaSee, e.g., Australian Government Production Approvals Page *ChinaSee, e.g., Standardization Procedure for Design Approval of Civil Aircraft and Parts, AP-21-AA-2012-20 (Nov. 5, 2012) (published by the Civil Aviation Authority of China and describing PMA parts in China) *The European Union (which produces them as \\"EPA Parts\\")See, e.g. Why and how must Parts and Appliances be marked, when are the letters EPA required, and which exceptions are acceptable?, EASA FAQ n.20095 (November 23, 2015) Other jurisdictions have established PMA regulations and are working with trading partners to achieve acceptance of their PMA industries, and thus should be expected to enter the PMA marketplace in the near future. For example, Japan has PMA regulations and has secured a bilateral agreement with the United States that authorizes the export of these parts to the United States as airworthy aircraft parts.

He was the great evangelist of the Evangelical awakening and preached during the Ulster Revival of 1859 which drew thousands to hear him. He was responsible for training and sending hundreds of \\"faith missionaries\\" all over the world. Earlier life Guinness was born in Montpelier House, Kingstown in Taney, Dublin, Ireland. He was homeschooled by his parents and later at Cheltenham and Exeter under Rev. Dr. Mills and Rev. C. Worthy. He was the grandson of Arthur Guinness and Olivia Whitmore. His father was John Grattan Guinness (1783–1850), Arthur's youngest son, who was an officer in the Madras Army of the East India Company. His mother was Jane Lucretia D'Esterre, whose first husband Captain John Norcot D'Esterre had been killed in a duel in 1815 by Daniel O'Connell, who remorsefully paid her an annuity. In 1853 at 17 years old, and somewhat backslidden in his faith, Guinness went to sea. During that year he visited the West Indies, Mexico, Texas, and Caribbean Sea area. He returned to England in 1853. In 1854 he was \\"sick unto death\\" when starting for the East Indies. So returning home, he repented and resolved to serve the Master. In January 1856 Guinness entered New College in London under a tutor named Dr. Harris. Possessed of extraordinary talent; his gift was that he spoke the language of the people, not the scholar. He preached much while still a student and in 1857 he was ordained an evangelist and began preaching to large audiences, as well as in the open air. Visited many cities and towns in the British Isles. During this time it is claimed that he was persecuted by Roman Catholics. From 1858 to 1860 he was in Canada and had a part in A. B. Simpson's conversion. He married Fanny Emma Fitzgerald October 2, 1860. She became known in her writings simply as Mrs. H. Grattan Guinness (1831–1898). They had one child, a son named Harry, who was born October 2, 1861 in Toronto, Canada. The Dublin Daily Express wrote in 1858: Later life The East London Institute (Harley House) training center for missionaries. Fanny Grattan Guinness, ca. 1890 From 1860-1872 he was a travelling evangelist in France, America, the Near East and the British Isles. He was compared by some to George Whitefield. He offered to join the China Inland Mission founded by James Hudson Taylor in 1865, but took Taylor's advice to continue his work in London. In September 1866 while in Keighley, Yorkshire, Guinness saw a notice advertising a series of lectures by the freethinker and communist Harriet Law. For a week he held a series of meetings at the same time to try to counteract her influence. He was appalled at the \\"scoffing unbelief\\" of such speakers. In 1868 he went to France, and helped the Evangelisation Populaire and the McCall Mission. He stayed there 18 months. In this same year Guinness and his wife published The Regions Beyond and Illustrated Missionary News, which was edited by Mrs. H. Grattan Guinness. With the help of Professor John Couch Adams, some astronomical tables and examination of the scriptures, Guinness worked out the prophetic chronology of the bible in terms of a series of \\"solilunar cycles.\\" This proved to him that he was living at the end of the sixth unsabbatic day of creation, 6,000 years from Adam, and that the \\"redemption Sabbath\\" would soon arrive. This revelation became the subject of many books that he wrote, and many sermons. In March 1873 Henry and wife Fanny started the famous East London Missionary Training Institute (also called Harley College) at Harley House in Bromley-by- Bow, East End of London with just six students. The renowned Dr. Thomas Barnardo was co-director with Dr. Guinness and greatly influenced by him. The school trained 1330 missionaries for 30 societies of 30 denominations. Harley College became so successful it needed a larger home. In 1883, Elizabeth Hulme offered Guinness \\"Cliff House\\" near Calver, Derbyshire. Harley College was renamed Hulme Cliff College. Now known as Cliff College it continues to this day training and equipping Christians for mission and evangelism. In 1873 Guinness founded the East London Institute for Home and Foreign Missions, the root of the Regions Beyond Missionary Union. In 1877 he founded the Livingstone Inland Mission, which worked in Congo, Argentina and Peru. His son Dr. Henry Grattan Guinness (1861–1915) founded the Congo-Balolo Mission in 1888 and co-founded the Congo Reform Association in 1904. He traveled to India, where he wrote critically that to the people there, \\"God is everything, and everything is God, and, therefore, everything may be adored. ... Her pan- deism is a pandemonium.\\"Henry Grattan Guinness, \\"First Impressions of India,\\" in John Harvey Kellogg, and the International Health and Temperance Association's, The Medical Missionary (1897), pages 125-127. From 1903-1907 as a widower, Mrs Guinness had died in the autumn of 1898, he went on world missionary tours before retiring in 1908 to his final resting place in Bath, UK. Legacy His daughter, and later famous author, Mary Geraldine Guinness married Frederick Howard Taylor, the son of China Inland Mission founder J. Hudson Taylor. She was one of seven children who entered Christian ministry. Dr. Gershom Whitfield Guinness was a medical missionary to China who escaped the Boxer Rebellion and went on to found the first hospital in Henan south of the Yellow River. A granddaughter, Ruth Eileen, married the famous geneticist and statistician Ronald Fisher, one of those responsible for Neo-Darwinism. His daughter Lucy wrote Across India at the Dawn of the 20th Century, about her hopes of converting the natives to Christianity. His great-grandson Os Guinness is an active author and speaker today.

Education Noble was educated at Emanuel School and University College London (UCL). In 1958 he began his investigations into the mechanisms of heartbeat. This led to two seminal papers in Nature in 1960 giving the first proper simulation of the heart. From this work it became clear that there was not a single oscillator which controlled heartbeat, but rather this was an emergent property of the feedback loops in the various channels. In 1961 he obtained his PhD working under the supervision of Otto Hutter at UCL.Dennis Noble (2006). The Music of Life, Research Noble's research focuses on using computer models of biological organs and organ systems to interpret function from the molecular level to the whole organism.

Noble is also a philosopher of biology, and his books The Music of Life and Dance to the Tune of Life challenge the foundations of current biological sciences, question the central dogma, its unidirectional view of information flow, and its imposition of a bottom-up methodology for research in the life sciences Reductionism His 2006 book The Music of Life examines some of the basic aspects of systems biology, and is critical of the ideas of genetic determinism and genetic reductionism. He points out that there are many examples of feedback loops and \\"downward causation\\" in biology, and that it is not reasonable to privilege one level of understanding over all others. He also explains that genes in fact work in groups and systems, so that the genome is more like a set of organ pipes than a \\"blueprint for life\\". His 2016 book Dance to the Tune of Life sets these ideas out in a broad sweep from the general principle of relativity applied to biology, through to the role of purpose in evolution and to the relativity of epistemology. He contrasts Dawkins's famous statement in The Selfish Gene (\\"Now they [genes] swarm ... safe inside gigantic lumbering robots ... they created us, body and mind; and their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our existence\\") with an alternative view: \\"Now they [genes] are trapped in huge colonies, locked inside highly intelligent beings, moulded by the outside world, communicating with it by complex processes, through which, blindly, as if by magic, function emerges. They are in you and me; we are the system that allows their code to be read; and their preservation is totally dependent on the joy we experience in reproducing ourselves. We are the ultimate rationale for their existence\\". He then suggests that there is no empirical difference between these statements, and says that they differ in \\"metaphor\\" and \\"sociological or polemical viewpoint\\".The Music of Life, pp. 12-14 He argues that \\"the paradigms for genetic causality in biological systems are seriously confused\\" and that \\"The metaphors that served us well during the molecular biological phase of recent decades have limited or even misleading impacts in the multilevel world of systems biology. New paradigms are needed if we are to succeed in unravelling multifactorial genetic causation at higher levels of physiological function and so to explain the phenomena that genetics was originally about.\\" Evolution Noble has called for an extended evolutionary synthesis, and more controversially a replacement for the modern synthesis.\\"The theory of evolution has evolved\\".

It is held in Mahesh, a historical locality within Serampore in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is a week-long festival and a grand fair is held at that time. People throng to have a share in pulling the long ropes (Rosshi) attached to the chariots of Lord Jagannath, Balarama and Subhadra on the journey from the temple to Mahesh Gundicha Bari (or, Masir Bari) and back within 8th day.  History  Jagannath temple at Mahesh It was the fourteenth century. Drubananda Brahmachari, a great Bengali sage went to Puri for pilgrimage. He had a desire to offer Lord Jagannath ‘Bhoga’ with his own hand. But the Temple authority prevented him do so. Broken-hearted Drubananda decided to fast until death. On the third day, he heard the Lord’s voice in his dream, “Drubananda, go back to Bengal. At the bank of Bhagirathi, you will find a place called Mahesh. There I shall send you a huge Daru-Brahma (Neem trunk). Make Balarama, Subhadra and my Idol with this trunk. I am eager to have ‘Bhoga’ in your hand.” So Drubanada returned to Mahesh and started his Sadhana. Then in a scary rainy night, that Daru-Brahma appeared at Mahesh. He jumped into the water and received it. Then he made the Idols of the Holy Trinity and established a Temple. After taking sanyas, Sri Chaitanya left for Puri. In the way, he reached at Mahesh. After visiting Drubananda’s Temple, he lost his sense, and absorbed in deep Samādhi. Sri Chaitanya christened Mahesh as 'Naba Nilachal' meaning the 'new Puri'. Later old Drubananda requested him to take charge of the temple. On his request he made Kamalakar Piplai, the fifth of his twelve Gopalas, the sebait of the temple. After few days Dhrubananda died. Kamalakar Piplai was, as it is mentioned earlier, fifth of the twelve Gopalas of Sri Chaitanya. He was the son of the Zamindar of Khalijuli in Sunderbans. He came to Navadwip to study Logic. Later he became a favorite of Mahaprabhu and joined his ministry. He was the first of the 64 Mohantas. After taking the charge of Mahesh Temple, he remained there and it is he who started the famous chariot festival, more than 600 years ago. His heirs still lives in Mahesh and some in Kolkata as the Sebait or ‘Adhikary’ of the Temple.  Chariot  But nor the Ratha neither the Temple of Kamalakar has existed. The modern Temple was made by Nayanchand Mallik of Pathuriaghata, Kolkata in 1755. It cost Rs. 20,000. Nothing about the first Ratha is known. Once a devotee of Baidyabati donated a ratha to the Temple. In 1797, Sri Ramakrishna’s famous disciple Balarama Basu’s grandfather Krishnaram Basu donated another Ratha. His son Guruprasad Basu renewed the Ratha in 1835. But after some years the Ratha was burnt. Then Kalachand Basu made another in 1852. But one day a person committed suicide inside the Ratha. Taking this as a sign of evil, Biswambhar Basu made a different Ratha in 1857, but it also got burnt. Then Dewan Krishnachandra Basu ordered an Iron-Chariot from Martin Burn This Ratha is still inexistent. The present ratha or the chariot was constructed under the patronage of Krishnaram Basu by the Martin Burn Company in 1885. The cost of the construction was two million rupees. The ratha is a Nabaratna temple having nine shikharas. The ratha has a steel framework with wooden scaffolding. It is fitted with twelve iron wheels each measuring twelve inches in circumference. The ratha is four storied, measuring 50 feet in height and 125 tonnes in weight. Two copper horses are attached to the front.  Festival  Rathayatra of Mahesh in 2016 The snanayatra is held on the full moon day preceding the rathayatra. On the day of snanyatra, the idols of Jagannath, Balaram and Subhadra are bathed in generous quantities of milk and Ganges water. It is believed that the idols suffer from fever due to the heavy bath. So three physicians, one each from Arambag, Goghat and Ghatal are summoned to treat the deities. They offer a liquid mixture as the medicine, which are then administered on the idols. Gradually their fever lapses and they regain normal health. Unlike the idols in Puri's Jagannath temple which are changed every twelve years, the same idols prepared by the founder Kamalakar Pipilai is used till date. However, two days after the snanayatra and just two weeks before the rathayatra, the angaraga ceremony is held. This is a three-day ceremony where the idols are repainted using herbal pigments behind closed doors. The artist covers his face and hairs while painting the idols and has only one vegetable meal a day for three days. He doesn't charge any money for the services. A day before the rathayatra, Jagannath is sworn in as the king. On the day of the rathayatra, the Jagannath idol placed on the highest storey of the ratha. The idols of Balaram and Subhadra are also placed in the ratha. A neelkantha bird is brought and made to sit at the topmost shikhara of the chariot. When the bird flies away the procession starts. Not only this festival is the oldest but also the biggest Rathayatra in Bengal. Nearly 2-3 lakh people come to see the month-long fair. Lord goes to Gundicha Temple and remains there till Punarjatra, or Ultorath, as it is popularly known in Bengal. Sri Ramakrishna, his wife Sarada Devi, Dramatist Girish Chandra Ghosh etc. many people came to visit the famous fair of the lord.  In popular culture  Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s famous novel ‘Radharani’ consists of a wonderful description of Mahesh Rathayatra. Radharani, the little heroine of the novel got lost in the fair, and then found by her future lover. Bankim’s description does not only gives a vivid picture of the festival but also it gave the fair a romantic literary charm. It is said that even today one can feel the brokenhearted girl’s sorrow.

It connects the town of Walsall to the city of Wolverhampton. The complete line does not currently have any regular scheduled passenger services: The line's local passenger service was withdrawn in 1965, it was restored in 1998, only to be withdrawn again in 2008. At present, the main use of the line is by freight trains, and it is also used as a diversionary route when engineering works are carried out on the West Coast Main Line. In 2017, the West Midlands Combined Authority announced that they would restore services to the line over the following decade, with new stations at Willenhall and James Bridge. History  Early history Most of the present route was opened in 1837 as part of the original Grand Junction Railway (GJR), one of the first railway trunk routes. Built as a long distance trunk route, the original GJR line did not directly serve either Walsall or Wolverhampton, instead running around the outskirts of both of them. A station on the original line called Wolverhampton was opened at the edge of the town centre, this was later renamed in 1855 after the centrally located Wolverhampton (High level) station on the Stour Valley Line was opened, Wednesfield Heath was then closed in 1873. A station called Walsall (also known as Bescot Bridge) was also opened, located some distance from the town, this station was closed in 1850, shortly after the present station opened on the South Staffordshire Line, it was reopened as , in 1881 and then closed in 1941. The GJR amalgamated with other railways to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1846. The present line was completed in 1881, when the LNWR constructed two spurs from the GJR at Wolverhampton and Walsall. The Wolverhampton spur diverged south from the original line and linked to Wolverhampton (High Level) station. The spur at the Walsall end diverged north from the GJR and linked to the South Staffordshire Line at Pleck Junction, where it gave access to Walsall station. A station was opened on the Walsall spur called , this later closed in 1958. The line later came under the control of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and later British Rail in 1948. The line's strategic use as a freight and diversionary route led to it being electrified with overhead wires in the 1960s, as an offshoot of the West Coast Main Line electrification, along with the connecting Walsall Line. However the local passenger service was withdrawn in 1965 as part of the Beeching Axe, and the line's remaining intermediate stations at and were closed. Recent history A passenger service was reintroduced 1998, however this was not a success and was withdrawn again in 2008. The service, which was funded by Centro and operated by Central Trains (later London Midland), operated hourly, and was reintroduced to the line on 24 May 1998. However, in 2005 the Strategic Rail Authority proposed the withdrawal of the service, citing low passenger numbers and a lack of rolling stock. Centro opposed this, and the service was given a temporary reprieve. There were also proposals to reopen the stations at and to increase passenger numbers and the viability of the service. During the early-mid 2000s, the line was used as part of an hourly service between Walsall and Wellington. But these services were withdrawn in 2006 and the service was reduced to an hourly service between Walsall and Wolverhampton, with only one or two trains per day in each direction extending to Wellington in the early morning and late at night. It was announced in July 2008 that the government was withdrawing funding for this service, and as a result the local service was mainly withdrawn as of December 2008. However the line remains open for freight trains, and the section between Wolverhampton and Darlaston Junction continues to be used by certain trains between Birmingham and Wolverhampton, and will also be used as a diversionary route when the West Coast Main Line is closed for engineering works. Between 2008–2011 this section was also used by the now defunct Wrexham & Shropshire passenger services to London. The full service was withdrawn on 13 December 2008, although there is still a 'Parliamentary train' – initially, one train per day ran directly from Walsall to Wolverhampton on weekdays, leaving Walsall at 19:36, but this was replaced in the 19 May 2013 timetable by a Saturdays-only train from Wolverhampton to Walsall leaving Wolverhampton at 05:42 (in the December 2019 timetable).GB National Rail timetables December 2012, May 2013 & May 2016 Editions, Table 70 Centro still have ambitions to reinstate the service and reopen stations at and Portobello, but its plans have been put on hold until the next West Midlands franchise award is made in 2016-17.\\"Plans to reopen rail line are put on hold\\"Express & Star news article 20 October 2012; Retrieved 24 May 2016 A service calling at all stations via Birmingham New street now operates, taking over 1 hour, compared with 15 minutes for the direct service, and London Midland advise passengers to use the National Express West Midlands 529 bus instead.

History Cliff Brewery, Ipswich The name Tolly Cobbold is an amalgamation of the two family-run brewers: the Tollemache Brewery owned by the Tollemache family and the Cobbold Brewery owned by the Cobbold family. The original Cobbold brewery was founded in Harwich, Essex in 1723 and in 1746 the Cobbold Cliff Brewery was founded, at Cliff Lane, Ipswich. The current building of 1896 is a tower brewery by William Bradford. The Tollemache Brewery was founded in the 1880s by sons of John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache. The family acquired Ipswich Brewery from Cullingham & Co. in 1880, the Essex Brewery at Walthamstow in 1920, a controlling share of the Star Brewery, Cambridge in 1930 and full control in 1947. Tollemache and Cobbold merged in 1957 to form Tolly Cobbold. Tolly Cobbold was taken over by Ellerman Lines in 1977 who sold it to the Barclay brothers in 1983 who then sold it to Brent Walker in 1989. Brent Walker announced they would close the brewery for development as a marina, with production of Tolly Cobbold beers to transfer to Camerons Brewery. Brian Cowie and Bob Wales led a management buy-out of the brewery (but not the pubs) for £4m, supported by the Tollemaches and Cobbolds among others. The brewery was then acquired by Ridley's brewery in 2002. Three years later, Ridley's Brewery was taken over by Suffolk-based Greene King in 2005. Tolly Original, the only Tolly Cobbold beer that Ridley's continued to brew in Chelmsford, is likely to become extinct since Greene King are unlikely to continue brewing it. Greene King was the main sponsor of Ipswich Town F.C., which was established by the Cobbold family. Tolly Follies One of the Tolly Follies, the Suffolk Punch in Ipswich, Suffolk In the 1930s the Tollemache brewery underwent a large expansion, taking over the Cambridge Star Brewery and building a number of mock-baronial pubs, mostly in Ipswich. The ornate style, and the scale of the expansion, led to their being known as \\"Tolly Follies\\". They were based on the design of the Tollemache stately home, Helmingham Hall. Most survive, though some, notably The Golden Hind in Cambridge, which was the only Tolly Folly outside of Ipswich, underwent major alteration in the 1980s. The Waveney Arms on Bramford Road in Ipswich closed in 1994 and stood empty for a number of years, before being demolished for housing. The Golden Hind in Ipswich, another example of a Tolly Folly Cobbold family The Cobbolds have an important status in Ipswich as the family were landowners in the town and surrounding area. John Chevalier Cobbold (1797-1882) was descended from \\"Big\\" John Cobbold (1746-1835), a 3rd generation brewer.Anthony D Lytton Cobbold's family tree. Christchurch Park was donated to \\"The people of Ipswich\\" by the family, along with many other donations of land such as Ipswich Racecourse. The family also provided several Members of Parliament for Ipswich over the years. In addition they have provided five chairmen of Ipswich Town Football Club. Lady Blanche Cobbold was president of the club for many years. ITFC have named part of a stand in their stadium and a prestigious member's club after the Cobbold family. Tolly Cobbold beers Beers in the range included Tolly Original, Cobnut, Tolly Bitter, Tolly Mild, Old Strong, Old Strong Porter (bottle only). Tollyshooter (named in honour of the visit of Sir John Harvey-Jones to the brewery shortly after the 1990 management takeover) Cantab, Cardinal Ale, Cobbold's Conquest, Cobbold's IPA (a straw-coloured bitter), Beano Stout, Countdown, Election Ale (1997), Final Brew and Last Orders – a final brew in 2002. For a short time in the 1960s, Tolly Cobbold produced an infamous lager known as Husky Brew, which John Cobbold himself compared to a dog's urine.

They are said to be named by Jah Shaka after producing exclusively for Jah Shaka. They recorded four albums of instrumental dub for Jah Shaka's King Of The Zulu Tribe label during 1987 to 1990. Russ D. acquired some basic recording equipment in 1985 which started their productions. Over the years this has seen many changes moving from a bedroom with four- and eight track recording to a small purpose built studio which now comprises full 24 track recording and mixing facilities. The Disciples built their own sound system in 1991 and played events across the UK for the following five years. They played alongside Aba Shanti-I, Iration Steppas and Channel One Sound System. Musical content was strictly roots reggae and dub music from all eras. Their first label, Boom Shacka Lacka, was formed in 1993 for releasing heavyweight instrumental dubs and this included a release of Prowling Lion. They also produced another album, For Those Who Understand. During this time their tracks featured on compilations for labels such as Virgin (Macrodub series), Dope On Plastic, Zip Dog and Dubhead. Further albums were released with artists such as Rootsman, Dayjah and Sister Rasheda. In 1996, they formed their second label, Backyard Movements, which was designed for releasing roots reggae vocal releases. The label has seen works with both homegrown and Jamaican artists including Prince Alla, Michael Rose, Bunny Lie Lie, Lutan Fyah, Prince Malachi, Tony Roots, Danny Vibes, Christine Miller, Ras Mac Bean, High Priest, Anthony Que and others. Since 1996, the Disciples sound system was dissolved and brother Lol pulled out of the business, Russ D. continued with both the label and DJing, teaming up with long-time friend Jonah Dan. The works continue in the Disciples Backyard Studio for their own productions and other labels.

Holonomic functions can also be described as differentiably finite functions, also known as D-finite functions. When a power series in the variables is the Taylor expansion of a holonomic function, the sequence of its coefficients, in one or several indices, is also called holonomic. Holonomic sequences are also called P-recursive sequences: they are defined recursively by multivariate recurrences satisfied by the whole sequence and by suitable specializations of it. The situation simplifies in the univariate case: any univariate sequence that satisfies a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients, or equivalently a linear homogeneous difference equation with polynomial coefficients, is holonomic.See and . Holonomic functions and sequences in one variable Definitions Let \\\\mathbb{K} be a field of characteristic 0 (for example, \\\\mathbb{K} = \\\\mathbb{Q} or \\\\mathbb{K} = \\\\mathbb{C}). A function f = f(x) is called D-finite (or holonomic) if there exist polynomials 0 eq a_r(x), a_{r-1}(x), \\\\ldots, a_0(x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[x] such that :a_r(x) f^{(r)}(x) + a_{r-1}(x) f^{(r-1)}(x) + \\\\cdots + a_1(x) f'(x) + a_0(x) f(x) = 0 holds for all x. This can also be written as A f = 0 where :A = \\\\sum_{k=0}^r a_k D_x^k and D_x is the differential operator that maps f(x) to f'(x). A is called an annihilating operator of f (the annihilating operators of f form an ideal in the ring \\\\mathbb{K}[x][D_x], called the annihilator of f). The quantity r is called the order of the annihilating operator. By extension, the holonomic function f is said to be of order r when an annihilating operator of such order exists. A sequence c = c_0, c_1, \\\\ldots is called P-recursive (or holonomic) if there exist polynomials a_r(n), a_{r-1}(n), \\\\ldots, a_0(n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{K}[n] such that :a_r(n) c_{n+r} + a_{r-1}(n) c_{n+r-1} + \\\\cdots + a_0(n) c_n = 0 holds for all n. This can also be written as A c = 0 where :A = \\\\sum_{k=0}^r a_k S_n and S_n the shift operator that maps c_0, c_1, \\\\ldots to c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots. A is called an annihilating operator of c (the annihilating operators of c form an ideal in the ring \\\\mathbb{K}[n][S_n], called the annihilator of c). The quantity r is called the order of the annihilating operator. By extension, the holonomic sequence c is said to be of order r when an annihilating operator of such order exists. Holonomic functions are precisely the generating functions of holonomic sequences: if f(x) is holonomic, then the coefficients c_n in the power series expansion :f(x) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} c_n x^n form a holonomic sequence. Conversely, for a given holonomic sequence c_n, the function defined by the above sum is holonomic (this is true in the sense of formal power series, even if the sum has a zero radius of convergence). Closure properties Holonomic functions (or sequences) satisfy several closure properties. In particular, holonomic functions (or sequences) form a ring. They are not closed under division, however, and therefore do not form a field. If f(x) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} f_n x^n and g(x) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} g_n x^n are holonomic functions, then the following functions are also holonomic: * h(x) = \\\\alpha f(x) + \\\\beta g(x), where \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are constants * h(x) = f(x) g(x) (the Cauchy product of the sequences) * h(x) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} f_n g_n x^n (the Hadamard product of the sequences) * h(x) = \\\\int_0^x f(t) dt * h(x) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} (\\\\sum_{k=0}^n f_k) x^n * h(x) = f(a(x)), where a(x) is any algebraic function. However, a(f(x)) is generally not holonomic. A crucial property of holonomic functions is that the closure properties are effective: given annihilating operators for f and g, an annihilating operator for h as defined using any of the above operations can be computed explicitly. Examples of holonomic functions and sequences Examples of holonomic functions include: * all algebraic functions * some transcendental functions such as \\\\sin(x), \\\\cos(x), e^x, and \\\\log(x)See . * the generalized hypergeometric function {}_pF_q(a_1,\\\\ldots,a_p, b_1, \\\\ldots, b_q, x), considered as a function of x with all the parameters a_i, b_i held fixed * the error function \\\\operatorname{erf}(x) * the Bessel functions J_n(x), Y_n(x), I_n(x), K_n(x) * the Airy functions \\\\operatorname{Ai}(x), \\\\operatorname{Bi}(x) * all classical orthogonal polynomials, including the Legendre polynomials P_n(x) and the Chebyshev polynomials T_n(x) and U_n(x). The class of holonomic functions is a strict superset of the class of hypergeometric functions. Examples of special functions that are holonomic but not hypergeometric include the Heun functions. Examples of holonomic sequences include: * the sequence of Fibonacci numbers F_n, and more generally, all constant-recursive sequences * the sequence of factorials n! * the sequence of binomial coefficients {n \\\\choose k} (as functions of either n or k) * the sequence of harmonic numbers H_n = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{k}, and more generally H_{n,m} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{k^m} for any integer m * the sequence of Catalan numbers * the sequence of Motzkin numbers. * the sequence of derangements. Hypergeometric functions, Bessel functions, and classical orthogonal polynomials, in addition to being holonomic functions of their variable, are also holonomic sequences with respect to their parameters. For example, the Bessel functions J_n and Y_n satisfy the second-order linear recurrence x (f_{n+1} + f_{n-1}) = 2 n f_n. Examples of nonholonomic functions and sequences Examples of nonholonomic functions include: * the function \\\\frac{x}{e^x-1}This follows from the fact that the function \\\\frac{x}{e^x-1} has infinitely many (complex) singularities, whereas functions that satisfy a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients necessarily have only finitely many singular points. * the function tan(x) + sec(x)See . * the quotient of two holonomic functions is generally not holonomic. Examples of nonholonomic sequences include: * the Bernoulli numbers * the numbers of alternating permutationsThis follows from the fact that the function tan(x) + sec(x) is a nonholonomic function. See . * the numbers of integer partitions * the numbers \\\\log(n) * the numbers n^{\\\\alpha} where \\\\alpha ot\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} * the prime numbers * the enumerations of irreducible and connected permutations.See . Holonomic functions in several variables Algorithms and software Holonomic functions are a powerful tool in computer algebra. A holonomic function or sequence can be represented by a finite amount of data, namely an annihilating operator and a finite set of initial values, and the closure properties allow carrying out operations such as equality testing, summation and integration in an algorithmic fashion. In recent years, these techniques have allowed giving automated proofs of a large number of special function and combinatorial identities. Moreover, there exist fast algorithms for evaluating holonomic functions to arbitrary precision at any point in the complex plane, and for numerically computing any entry in a holonomic sequence. Software for working with holonomic functions includes: * The HolonomicFunctions package for Mathematica, developed by Christoph Koutschan, which supports computing closure properties and proving identities for univariate and multivariate holonomic functions * The algolib library for Maple, which includes the following packages:  gfun, developed by Bruno Salvy, Paul Zimmermann and Eithne Murray, for univariate closure properties and proving  mgfun, developed by Frédéric Chyzak, for multivariate closure properties and proving  numgfun, developed by Marc Mezzarobba, for numerical evaluation See also Dynamic Dictionary of Mathematical functions, A online software, based on holonomic functions for automatically studying many classical and special functions (evaluation at a point, Taylor series and asymptotic expansion to any user-given precision, differential equation, recurrence for the coefficients of the Taylor series, derivative, indefinite integral, plotting, ...)

Early life and career  Giambattista Rubini was born in Venice in 1642, the second son of Donato Rubini and Cristina Medici. His grandmother, Cristina Ottoboni, was the sister of Pope Alexander VIII.Giambattista Rubini by S. Miranda (Florida International University, last updated May 2012) He was educated at the University of Padua, becoming a doctor of both laws. He became a canon of Padua Cathedral at an early age. After law school, he moved to Rome to become Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura. He later became governor of the cities of Fabriano, Spoleto, Frosinone, Viterbo, and Macerata. He then went on to be governor of the Campagne and Maritime Province, Umbria, and the March of Ancona. Rubini received the minor orders on 10 September 1683; became a subdeacon on 12 September 1683; and was made a deacon on 19 September 1683. He was ordained to the priesthood on 21 September 1683. On 15 May 1684, the cathedral chapter of Vicenza Cathedral elected him to be Bishop of Vicenza. He was consecrated as a bishop by Cardinal Alessandro Crescenzi on 21 May 1684.  Cardinalate  Rubini's great-uncle, Pope Alexander VIII, named him Cardinal Secretary of State in October 1689. The pope made him a cardinal priest in the consistory of 13 February 1690. On 10 April 1690, he received the red hat and the titular church of San Lorenzo in Panisperna. He was made papal legate to Urbino on 27 September 1690. After Alexander VIII's death, Rubini participated in the papal conclave of 1691, which elected Pope Innocent XII, who did not name Rubini as his Secretary of State. He later participated in the papal conclave of 1700, which elected Pope Clement XI. He resigned as Bishop of Vicenza on 25 March 1702. On 15 January 1703, he was named Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals, and he held that office until 14 January 1704. On 25 March 1706, he opted for the titular church of San Marco.

It is part of Community High School District 128, which also includes Libertyville High School. The school is a blue ribbon of excellence school. History Following the successful passage of a $48.5 million bond referendum in 1997, construction on the school began. The doors opened on September 7, 1999 for all freshmen in District 128. Construction continued for the next year, upon which the school opened for all grades in August 2000. The school was formally dedicated on April 9, 2000. The first graduating class was that of 2002. The Cougar mascot was chosen following a poll of the freshmen and sophomore students attending the new school in August 2000. Academics In 2012, Vernon Hills had a mean composite ACT score of 25.4. The average class size is 20.3. Vernon Hills has made Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievements Examination, a state test part of the No Child Left Behind Act. The faculty consists of 111 teachers, of whom 97 hold a master's degree or beyond. In 2009, Newsweek released a list of the best high schools in America. Vernon Hills High School was ranked 638th nationwide and 14th statewide. In 2015, Vernon Hills was ranked as the 517th school nationwide, and 19th statewide, according to U.S. News & World Report. This was good enough to earn VHHS a Silver Medal of Excellence. Demographics In 2015, the school had 36% minority enrollment. To break this down, the high school had 17% Asian, 2% Black, and 14% Hispanic Enrollment. Athletics Vernon Hills competes in the Central Suburban League. Its mascot is the Cougar. Vernon Hills offers 31 Varsity Sports, 16 of which are male and 15 of which are female. The school has an on site pool for aquatics, as well as a baseball field and a football field, both of which were recently covered in field turf, allowing for optimal usage. The VHHS football team has been solid especially for a relatively small school compared to local competition such as Stevenson High School. They typically have qualified for the state playoffs, or at least been close to qualifying. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the team featured two future college stars: DaVaris Daniels, who went on to play for Notre Dame, and Evan Spencer, who went on to play for Ohio State. The team came close to making the state finals their senior year, losing to Kaneland in the Quarterfinals. This 2010 team shut out their opponents 310–0 to start off their season before a loss to Lake Forest. The boys' bowling team has also been successful, placing 3rd in the state during the 2005–06 season. They have since won Sectionals in both 2008 and 2009 and placed 2nd in the state during the 2010–11 and 2011–12 season. In 2020, the Cougars won their 4th straight CSL conference title, led by senior Jacob Gates. The 2007–08 Pom Pons team won a state championship in the TEAMDance Illinois Class AA Open Dance category. They defended their state title with additional wins in 2009, 2010, and 2011 for a total of 5 state titles. The boys' volleyball team has been very successful within the North Suburban (Prairie) Conference. They have earned five conference championships, in 2003, 2008, 2009 (when they finished 10–0 in conference play), 2010 and co-champion 2011. They were the first team of any sport at VHHS to become back-to-back conference champions. In the 2009 season the bass fishing team of Mike Seal and Brandon Wolff qualified for the state championship during the IHSA bass fishing inaugural season. In the 2010 and 2012 season the Girls' Track and Field team won their IHSA AA Sectional. Activities Fine arts Theatre Vernon Hills High School's Backlight Theatre Company presents two plays, a musical, a freshman-sophomore play, and student-directed one acts each year. Music =State competitions= The VHHS music department has always performed very well at the IHSA state competition, placing 4th in its class in its first year of existence. VHHS has placed within the top three schools in the state every year since 2004, and as of 2009 has placed first in the state in Class A for three consecutive years. In 2006, 2009 and 2011, the VHHS Wind Ensemble was selected as the Class AA Honor Band at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign–sponsored Superstate band competition, recognizing the VHHS Wind Ensemble as one of the top high school concert bands in Illinois. FBLA and DECA VHHS also sponsors two award-winning business clubs. FBLA sent five students to compete in the National Competition in Anaheim in the summer of 2009. FBLA has had students place in the top 10 of Accounting at the National level for two straight years (2008, 2009). DECA sent 13 state winners to the International Competition in Orlando. VHHS's DECA Financial Analysis team, which consisted of two freshmen, Sean Hogan and Jake Dinkel, placed 7th at the International Competition out of the over 150 teams competing in 2007.

The Junior/Senior 8-Person team placed first in State, the Frosh/Soph 8-Person placed second, and Calculator team placed fourth. Junior/Senior 2 Person team of Justin Yim and Eric Zhang qualified for the playoff round and finished first in State. The Frosh-Soph relay team of Aparajitha Adiraju, Kishore Iyer, Ari Bard and Ryan Curtis finished in 2nd place. WYSE The Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering club at VHHS continues to be successful in their 1500 division. They have placed at the state level in many years past. A team of 14 students competes in the events of Math, Biology, Chemistry, English, and Physics, with each student taking two tests, and at least two students per each subject. The competition takes place at a regional, sectional, and state level. Regional and sectional levels are usually successful, and have resulted in first-place finishes. The team is coached by Joshua Ravenscraft, physics teacher, who has led the team for six years and Sarah Stoub, chemistry teacher. The WYSE team has placed within the top three schools in the state for seven of its eight years, and won its first state championship in 2009. Since 2018, WYSE was discontinued by the University of Illinois, but Eastern Illinois University continues to hold the competition. In their first season with EIU, VHHS placed 3rd at the state level in the 1500 division with Nicolas Beaumont, Alexa Pomerantz, Itamar Shifrin, Rachel Liu, and Jeffrey Zhang placing in the top five for biology, chemistry, computer science, English, mathematics and physics.

The mosque was the largest mosque in the Indian subcontinent. It was built during the Bengal Sultanate as a royal mosque by Sikandar Shah, who is also buried in the mosque. Shah was a member of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty and carried lofty titles such as \\"the exalted Sultan\\" and \\"Caliph of the Faithful\\". The mosque is situated in Pandua, a former royal capital. The vast architecture is associated with the hypostyle of the Umayyad Mosque, which was used during the introduction of Islam in new areas. The early Bengal Sultanate harbored imperial ambitions after having defeated the Delhi Sultanate twice in 1353 and 1359. The Adina Mosque was commissioned in 1364. Its construction absorbed materials from pre-Islamic Hindu and Buddhist structures. The Bengal Sultanate disintegrated during the sixteenth century with the rise of the Mughal Empire. Adina Mosque is included in the List of Monuments of National Importance in West Bengal by the Archaeological Survey of India (serial no. N-WB-81). Design The central mihrab of the mosque The design of the mosque incorporated Bengali, Arab, Persian and Byzantine architecture. Although the mosque is eye-catching from far because of its size, but because of the finely precise executed designed decoration makes it hard to see the characteristics it holds without standing in a good distance from it. It was built with rubble masonry that was covered with brick, stone, coatings of stucco, plaster, concrete, glazing or lime smoothing. Stone flowers were integrated into the arches of the interior and exterior all around the building. Its plan is similar to the Great Mosque of Damascus. It had a rectangular hypostyle structure with an open courtyard. There were several hundred domes. The structure measured 172 by 97 m. The entire western wall evokes the imperial style of pre-Islamic Sasanian Persia. The mosque's most prominent feature is its monumental ribbed barrel vault over the central nave, the first such huge vault built in the subcontinent, and another feature shared in common with the Sassanian style. The mosque consciously imitated Persianate imperial grandeur. The prayer hall is five aisles deep, while the north, south and east cloisters around the courtyard consist of triple aisles. In total, these aisles had 260 pillars and 387 domed bays. The interior of the courtyard is a continuous façade of 92 arches surmounted by a parapet, beyond which the domes of the bays can be seen. The ornament on the building is simple, but if you look closer you can see the intensity and disciple in the engravings that have been created on the walls and arches. The interior elevated platform, which was the gallery of the Sultan and his officials, still exists. The Sultan's tomb chamber is attached with the western wall. History Accounts of Pandua Arches and columns in the interior of Adina Mosque. The elevated platform was the royal gallery where the Sultan prayed. Central prayer hall in the mosque alt= Tomb of Sultan Sikandar Shah Detailed arabesque The mosque was built during the reign of Sikandar Shah, the second Sultan of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty of the Bengal Sultanate. The mosque was designed to display the kingdom's imperial ambitions after its two victories against the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century. According to Encyclopedia Iranica, the mosque's construction material included stone from Bengali temples. A few parts of the mosque's exterior wall have carvings like elephants and dancing figures. Historians have considered whether the builders used stone from pre-Islamic structures or whether the mosque was built on the site of a pre-existing ruin. Inscriptions on the mosque proclaimed Sikandar Shah as \\"the exalted Sultan\\" and the \\"Caliph of the faithful\\". The Sultan was buried in a tomb chamber attached to the wall facing the direction of Mecca. The mosque was located in the historic city of Pandua, a former capital of the Bengal Sultanate. Pandua was a thriving and cosmopolitan trading center during the period of the sultanate. According to the accounts of Chinese envoy Ma Huan, Pandua developed from a small hamlet into a capital city with a military garrison and then a commercial, manufacturing and trade center. Its population included royalty, indigenous people, and foreigners from across Eurasia who settled or were part of a floating population. It was a walled city with well-arranged streets and bazaars. The marketplaces sold many kind of goods, including six varieties of muslin and four types of wine. The markets included eateries, drinking houses and bathing areas. The Sultan's residence was a white mansion. Alcohol was not served in the royal court.María Dolores Elizalde; Wang Jianlang (6 November 2017). China's Development from a Global Perspective. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. pp. 61, 68 and 69. . Another remnant of the former royal capital that still stands is the Eklakhi Mausoleum. The main structure of the royal palace, with its high steps, nine walls and three gates, no longer exists. Remnants of the palace, including floral carvings, can be seen in Pandua's raised mounds. The mixture of seemingly Buddhist, Hindu, and Islamic decorative characteristics of Adina Mosque has been questioned by many people. Wondering if this building is considered Islamic architecture or not, but with careful study it has become clear that this building was put together using Islamic traditions used in many other islamic architecture. Modern era The mosque was damaged by earthquakes in the 19th century. It fell into disuse. Much of Pandua also became part of the wilderness. Tribal rebellion On 3 December 1932 AD, Jitu Santhal, the leader of an anti- landlord movement in North Bengal had engaged in his last combat at the ruins of the Adina mosque. A largeband of Santhals, who had recently converted to Hinduism, marched up to the historic city of Pandua, occupied the ruins of Adina, and conducted a debased form of Hindu worship in order to transform the mosque into a temple. Jitu, who now called himself Gandhi, declared the end of British Raj and proclaimed his own government from within the mosque. Eventually, Jitu was killed in the vicinity of the mosque after a battle with armed police, who opened fire after the Santhals refused to come out.

Story The capitalist nation of Randa has long had a history of excellence in the creation of aircraft, attracting the best of engineers in aerodynamics, artillery, and structuring from the world over. Once, even this interest had waned, until the creation of the air show Bakraid, in which the capabilities of the fighters could be demonstrated outside of simulations for all to see. Around the time of the seventh Bakraid, a nearby nation, Deneb, had attained an expansionist attitude, forcibly subjugating and annexing several of its neighbors with the assistance of the Shtarterra Security Council. Recently, Deneb has asked to participate in Bakraid. Randa's defense council, perfectly aware that this is just a pretext for Deneb to get its and the SSC's engines of war into Randan borders and more easily prosecute their war from there, give their blessing. However, the council secretly contacts the other Bakraid participants, offering even more prize money than normal if they will perform in a special version of Bakraid—genuine war conditions. In other words, use their own top- of-the-line planes to shatter Deneb's schemes. In all, nine pilots accept this plan, and begin Bakraid two weeks early to catch Deneb unaware...

When specifying a stage or boss (by pressing left or right), player plays a course consists of the selected stage or boss twice, with second trial featuring increased difficulty. Special can be unlocked either by entering code a special code at the title screen or clearing the Advance game. However, clearing Advance game does not unlock the Special course permanently. After choosing Normal or Advance course, Stage Edit mode allows player to choose the sequence of stages 2–5 from a set of 4 stages. In Special/Only Boss mode, an additional Stage I is included, which consists of mid-boss battle in Cloud stage (Stage 6).

Pressing different buttons when choosing a fighter can alter a fighter's ability: * Main shot power type: Press A button * Bomber power type: Press B button * Side shot power type: Press C button * Speed up type: Press Start button When using Team Edit, player can choose different fighters for successive lives after the initial fighter is destroyed. If Team Edit is unavailable, it can be unlocked by inserting a coin and press Up, Down, Up, Down Left, Right, Left, Right, A, B, Start before timer passes 10. Fighter's rapid fire rate can be increased by holding C then press A when inside a stage, or decreased by holding C then press B when inside a stage. * Sky Dragon * Saber Tiger * Lightning Wolf * Hammer Shark Phase 2 fighters * Flame Viper * Steel Bat Phase 3 fighters * Buster Lizard * Blade Owl Medal system Some enemies drop medals when destroyed. In addition, medal can also be found in neutral background objects when destroyed. The medal initially worth 100 points, but the value increases when player collects all on-screen medals without missing any before another medal is revealed, up to 10000 points. When a medal is missed, the next revealed medal is worth 100 points. If there are multiple on-screen medals, player can restore medal level after missing a medal by collecting the remaining highest value medal on-screen without missing further medals, before revealing any other medal. Multiplier system Whenever a player's fighter destroys a large enemy, a score multiplier is set. The multiplier doubles every time a large enemy is destroyed before timer reaches 0, for up to 64. The multiplier timer increases whenever a large enemy is destroyed. When multiplier is in effect and the player's medal level is already at 10000 points, revealing medal causes 100000-point medal to appear instead. When multiplier timer reaches 0, the score multiplier effect simply disappears. Rank Bakraid features a dynamically adjusting rank system that makes the game harder, similar to the rank system in Armed Police Batrider and Battle Garegga. The rank increases when the player collects items, fires its weapons, or uses its bombs. The rank will only decrease when the player grazes bullets or loses lives. In Bakraid, it's easier to graze bullets and survive than in Batrider since the player sprites are larger in comparison to their hitbox. Bakraid has a fixed moderate starting rate at the beginning of the game compared to the high starting rank of Batrider and the minimum starting rank of Battle Garegga. Still, it's no surprise players would suicide or graze bullets to decrease the rank for the game. As rank increases, more bullets spawn, some bullets move faster, attack patterns are generally trickier to negotiate, and enemies gain health.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Battle Bakraid on their June 1, 1999 issue as being the tenth most-successful arcade game of the year.

(now Square Enix) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. In keeping with the time travel theme of the game's storyline, the characters hail from different eras of a fictional history, ranging from prehistoric times to a post- apocalyptic future. Creation and influences Masato Kato's original sketches of the main characters. From left to right: the daughter of a fairy king, a tin robot (top), a monster man (bottom), an inventor girl, the male protagonist, a demon king, a primitive girl, and an old sage The characters of Chrono Trigger were designed by Akira Toriyama based on sketches from the story planner Masato Kato. The development team wanted a diverse cast to reflect the various eras visited by the player; while working on the in-battle actions of the game, they decided to include a playable character that was neither human nor robot. Kato drew sketches for a cast of eight playable characters, comprising a male protagonist, the daughter of a fairy king, a tin robot, a monster man, an inventor girl, a demon king, a primitive girl, and an old sage. Pig and monkey characters were also considered. Six of the initial ideas were reworked by Toriyama, while the old sage character was scrapped and the monster man replaced with Toriyama's own frog man design. In addition to the artwork for the main cast, Toriyama designed the non-playable characters and the monsters of the game, though Hironobu Sakaguchi contributed the idea of the singing robot Gato. The development staff studied all the drawings Toriyama made for the game and tried to be as faithful to his lighthearted style as possible. In particular, humorous names were chosen for several characters. The staff noted that this kind of humor would have been impossible in the Final Fantasy series. Some of the names used in the English localization of the game were inspired by Biblical characters, including Belthasar, Gaspar, Melchior, and Magus. However, Kato did not especially have the Bible in mind when writing the story and was not aware of the names created by the translator Ted Woolsey. Playable characters Crono is the red spiky-haired silent protagonist of the game. He is never shown speaking, using facial expressions to communicate. His name is spelled in Japanese materials. He lives in the village of Truce with his mother. A chance encounter with Marle at the fair begins a series of adventures and uncovers a pre-millennial evil. In 12,000 BC, when the party is confronted with Lavos in the Ocean Palace of the Kingdom of Zeal, Crono sacrifices himself to save his friends, resulting in his death. With time travel, the player can manage to replace Crono at the moment before he dies with a clone received from the Millennial Fair in 1000 A.D, saving his life. The PlayStation and Nintendo DS versions of Chrono Trigger include an FMV scene at the end that shows Crono and Marle getting married. A second FMV depicts the fall of Guardia Kingdom in the year AD 1005, though it is unknown what happened to him during this event. Crono uses a katana as a weapon and learns to use \\"Light\\" magic (\\"Heaven\\" in the original Japanese version). Most of the game's triple techs require his presence in the battle party if they are to be performed. Though there are triple techs that do not need him, certain accessories are required to use triple techs where he is not involved. In the initial design sketches, Crono was a \\"bad kid\\" wearing goggles and a cape. He is called Chrono in the Japanese version, and Crono in the North American version. Concerning his death in the game, Kato noted that his policy has always been \\"to try and create games that run counter to users' expectations, surprise them\\". Kato and Yuji Horii initially proposed Crono's death, though they intended he stay dead; the party would have retrieved an earlier, living version of him to complete the quest. Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story. In a special Chrono Trigger Cross Review, Famicom Tsūshin scored Crono a 30 out of 40.CHRONO TRIGGER CROSS REVIEW - キャラクター: クロノ. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.332. Pg.68. 28 April 1995. Marle Marle (), is the princess of Guardia. Her real name is Princess Nadia ( in the original Japanese version), and she is often at odds with her father, the king. Bored of royal life in the castle, she slips out to the Millennial Fair in Truce. Here, she meets Crono and tries out Lucca's teleporter, which reacts with her pendant and creates a time Gate, sending her to the Middle Ages and kicking off the events of the game. Her family line is the victim of two unsuccessful plots to overtake the kingdom: once in the Middle Ages, and once in the Present time by the shapeshifting monster and his descendant Yakra XIII, respectively. In both cases, the monsters kidnap the chancellor and assume his form. The likeness of the latter was perfect to a fault, but he did make one mistake: barring Marle from the courtroom, allowing her to investigate the false claims leveled against her father. The PlayStation and Nintendo DS versions of Chrono Trigger includes an FMV scene at the end that shows Crono and Marle getting married. A second FMV depicts the fall of Guardia Kingdom in the year AD 1005, though it is unknown what happened to Marle during this event. Marle uses a crossbow as her weapon. When she gains the ability to use magic, she learns to use \\"Ice (Water)\\" elemental magic manifesting as ice and healing spells. In the initial character sketches, she was the daughter of a fairy king and had shorter hair. In a special Chrono Trigger Cross Review, Famicom Tsūshin scored Marle a 26 out of 40.CHRONO TRIGGER CROSS REVIEW - キャラクター: マール. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.332. Pg.68. 28 April 1995. Lucca Ashtear is Crono's childhood friend. Using her intelligence and creativity, Lucca invented many devices, such as a battle-training robot named Gato (\\"Gonzales\\" in the Japanese version) and a short-range teleporter. This device caused Marle to go back in time, inevitably leading to the start of the game. Lucca is directly responsible for the playability of another character in the game - Robo, whom she finds and repairs in the future. In the ending FMV scene of the PlayStation and Nintendo DS versions, it is seen that Lucca eventually created a mini-robot modeled after Robo. In the same scene, Lucca finds an infant with a pendant and takes her in. That child is revealed to be Kid, Schala's daughter-clone and the female protagonist in the sequel to Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross. Lucca battles with a gun and hammer, and when spells become available she learns to cast \\"Fire\\" magic. In the initial character sketches, Lucca had a \\"wilder personality\\" and wore seemingly-opaque glasses and a bow tie. In a special Chrono Trigger Cross Review, Famicom Tsūshin scored Lucca a 27 out of 40.CHRONO TRIGGER CROSS REVIEW - キャラクター: ルッカ. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.332. Pg.68. 28 April 1995. Frog Frog is an anthropomorphic frog knight from the Middle Ages era. He is called in Japanese materials. He was born as a human by the name Glenn and a friend of the late brave knight Cyrus. After witnessing Cyrus' death at the hands of Magus and being transformed into a frog, Frog vowed to avenge Cyrus by killing Magus. During the game, he obtains the Masamune (Grandleon in the Japanese version), an ancient sword whose offensive capabilities against magic users is Magus' major weakness. Frog can later put Cyrus' ghost to rest, regaining his courage and clearing his conscience. Frog wields a broadsword and can also learn \\"Water\\" and, like Marle, healing magic. His design in the final version of the game replaces that of a monster man character from the initial character sketches. In Ted Woolsey's English translation, Frog speaks in a grandiose, pseudo- Shakespearean manner, using words such as 'thou', 'thee', and 'shalt'. No one else from his era speaks that way, nor does he use it himself as the young or adult Glenn. In the re-translation for the DS version, Frog's manner of speech is closer to modern, yet antiquated English, and no longer adopts the accent of the earlier versions. Likewise, in the Japanese version, he does not speak with the accent and instead talks rather rudely.Compare original and translation for this line– Frog: \\"P, perish the thought, lass! By the way, whither the blue-haired one?\\" to Japanese– カエル「バ、バカヤロー！ それより、あお白いツラした マントのヤローは、いなかったか！？\\" to the re-translated version– Frog: \\"D, dumbass! More importantly, that pale-faced caped bastard wasn't there!?\\" Chrono Trigger. Square, 1995. Translation retrieved from Chrono Compendium , June 20, 2006. In a special Chrono Trigger Cross Review, Famicom Tsūshin scored Frog a 39 out of 40.CHRONO TRIGGER CROSS REVIEW - キャラクター: カエル. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.332. Pg.68. 28 April 1995. Robo is a futuristic robot with serial number R-66Y. He was rendered dormant by the apocalypse in AD 1999 but is found and repaired by Lucca in the year AD 2300. Upon his reactivation, Robo has no memory of his prior mission and joins the party. In a sidequest, Robo is branded a traitor by his maker, , a rogue computer who opposes humans and desires a utopia of robots. Robo learns of his original purpose which was to observe and study human behavior as well as his original name, which is Prometheus. Robo is then forced to kill his long-lost, brainwashed companion robot Atropos XR because he refuses to side with her before he manages to shut down the computer. In another side quest, Robo can volunteer to spend four hundred years restoring Fiona's forest. During this time, Robo ponders the existence of an \\"entity\\", a dying being who wished Crono and his friends to witness its life throughout time. At the end of this side quest, the beginning of another side quest involving Lucca is started. Robo uses his robotic arm as a weapon and can use laser attacks which mimic \\"Shadow\\" magic, as well as other techs that mimic \\"Fire\\" and \\"Light\\" skills. He is considered unable to use magic because he is not organic, and therefore did not descend from the magic-using people of Zeal. In the initial character sketches, he had a different design and was larger. In the Japanese version, Robo has a unique speech; he speaks with bits of katakana in his sayings and has trouble with pronunciations. Most of the robots talk in katakana, with the exception of Johnny. In a special Chrono Trigger Cross Review, Famicom Tsūshin scored Robo a 32 out of 40.CHRONO TRIGGER CROSS REVIEW - キャラクター: ロボ. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.332. Pg.68. 28 April 1995. Destructoid's Chad Concelmo named Robo the best robot in gaming, citing an ongoing connection with the character. Ayla Ayla is the chief of a prehistoric tribe. Her name is spelled as in Japanese materials. She is engaged in a conflict with , the leader of the Reptites who leads the effort to destroy the human race to prove their superiority. Ayla and the party eventually defeat Azala at the Tyrano Lair, and Azala dies from the impact of Lavos crashing into the place. At that point, Ayla is revealed to be the person who gave Lavos its name, claiming that \\"La\\" means fire, and \\"Vos\\" means big. In the ending anime cut-scene of the PlayStation version, Ayla is seen brashly forcing engagement on Kino, her sweetheart, and Marle's ancestor. She relies on unarmed combat and physical prowess in battle. Ayla cannot use magic because she was born before humans became capable of doing so. Due to her being from the prehistoric era she speaks in a Stereotype-caveman manner, using broken English. Ayla's character seems most likely derived from the blond hair, blue-eyed, Cro-Magnon era heroine of the same name in the Earth's Children series of novels by the author Jean Auel. In a special Chrono Trigger Cross Review, Famicom Tsūshin scored Ayla a 29 out of 40.CHRONO TRIGGER CROSS REVIEW - キャラクター: エイラ. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.332. Pg.68. 28 April 1995. Magus Magus is the lord of the Mystics of the Middle Ages. He is called in Japanese materials. Depicted as an antagonist for a large part of the game, Magus is eventually revealed to be the older version of Janus ( in the Japanese version), the young prince of Zeal in 12,000 BC. After an encounter with Lavos as a child, he had been sent through a time gate to the Middle Ages, where he was adopted by Ozzie of the Mystics and became their leader. After the fall of Zeal, the player can choose to fight Magus or spare him, allowing him to reluctantly join the party. As the second fight is to the death, Magus will be permanently gone after this fight plays out. In the DS version of the game, a future version of Magus appears in the new scenario, stating that the player's party may or may not be from the same dimension as his. He finally finds Schala at the Time's Eclipse, integrated into Lavos as the Dream Devourer the early form of Time Devourer from Chrono cross. Failing to save his sister, Magus is sent away by his sister Schala and erase his memories in a fit of desperation. Though he lost his memories, Magus is determined to remember what he had desired to find something. Also in the Nintendo DS version, most NPCs have given him the title of \\"the Fiendlord.\\" Magus fights using a scythe, as well as a combination of all magic types, including his own exclusive \\"Shadow\\" magic. Contrary to the other characters, he does not learn any dual techs, and accessories must be found to unlock several triple techs. His three main generals in the Middle Ages they are Ozzie, Slash, and Flea (called , , and in the Japanese version). In a side-quest, the player can visit the place they took refuge in after the fall of Magus' castle and defeat them again. In a special Chrono Trigger Cross Review, Famicom Tsūshin scored Magus a 29 out of 40.CHRONO TRIGGER CROSS REVIEW - キャラクター: 魔王. Weekly Famicom Tsūshin. No.332. Pg.68. 28 April 1995. Main non-playable characters Lavos is the game's primary antagonist, an alien parasite with immense destructive powers, which crash landed in the year 65,000,000 BC (65,000 BC in the Japanese version). Lavos slept, gaining power until AD 1999, when he emerged and put the world into an apocalyptic state. While traveling to AD 2300, Crono, Marle, and Lucca see a video of the Day of Lavos of AD 1999, and decide to prevent it somehow. It is eventually revealed that Lavos came to Earth with the intention of draining its energy so that it could produce genetically enhanced spawn, which would then continue the cycle on other planets. The DS version adds an optional final boss to the game, the \\"Dream Devourer\\", which is the result of the assimilation of Schala by the defeated Lavos at Time's Eclipse. In the North American version of the game, it is claimed that Lavos directly influenced all technology and life on the planet, evolving the planet's life forms to cultivate it, and make itself stronger. Magus states, \\"We were created only to be harvested. All people... and all living things...\\" However, the line is absent in the Japanese version, with Lavos being a more passive parasite instead. Early in the game, the characters believe that Lavos created the time Gates. However, they come to a different realization in one of the sidequests, in Fiona's Forest: due to the timing of when the gates appeared and their significance, the gates may have been created by some other entity reliving its life cycle, flashing back over important memories in its past, which were tied to Lavos. The original Japanese dialogue in this scene heavily implies that this entity is the planet itself. Gurus The Gurus of Life (Melchior), Time (Gaspar), and Reason (Belthasar) are three highly intelligent figures of authority originally living in the Kingdom of Zeal in 12000 BC. Their original Japanese names are , , and . Their English names are taken from the traditional names given to the Magi who brought gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to the infant Jesus. When Queen Zeal became obsessed with harnessing the energy of Lavos, the Gurus tried to stop her, which ultimately resulted in Lavos sending each of them into different eras of the future: Melchior to AD 1000, Belthasar to AD 2300, and Gaspar to the End of Time. The player encounters the Gurus in their respective eras or in 12000 BC and receives valuable items and advice from them. * Melchior's main creation is the Masamune, which has a symbiotic relation with twin magical creatures named Masa and Mune (known in Japan as and ). The two have a \\"big sister\\" named Doreen, who has a liking for dreams. * Gaspar's main creation is the \\"Time Egg\\", also known as the \\"Chrono Trigger\\", a mysterious item capable of effective miracles. Gaspar lives in the End of Time with , the self-proclaimed \\"Master of War\\" who introduces the art of Magic to Crono and his teammates. * Balthasar lives in the wastelands of the year 2300 and his main creation is the Epoch, a time-traveling machine that works independent of portals. Schala is the daughter of Queen Zeal and the older sister of Janus. She was raised in the Kingdom of Zeal in 12000 BC when mankind was separated from the Enlightened Ones, who are able to use magic, and the Earthbound Ones, who are not. She is one of the few Enlightened Ones sympathetic towards the Earthbound Ones. Schala was forced by her power-hungry mother, Queen Zeal, to use her magic powers in order to try and control the energy of Lavos with the Mammon Machine. She disappeared after the Ocean Palace disaster. In the DS version, she is revealed to have been assimilated by the defeated Lavos in the Time's Eclipse, as in the sequel Chrono Cross. The creature can be fought, as the \\"Dream Devourer\\", which unlocks a new ending. Dalton Zeal's general and high-ranking adviser of the magical Kingdom of Zeal, is depicted as an overall inept character, once even breaking the fourth wall when he complains about the wrong music playing in the background while he stole the Epoch. He is not entirely loyal to Queen Zeal, he wants to have Lavos' power for himself, Dalton has an army of Golems that he uses to attack the party. He also uses the plane, The Blackbird, as a flying fortress. After the rise of the Ocean Palace and the disappearance of Zeal's royal family, Dalton sees himself as the new king of the Dark Ages. He abducts the party shortly after Crono's death and imprisons them on The Blackbird. He is also responsible for modifying The Epoch with the ability to fly for his own purposes. Ultimately, Dalton disappears by accident in a portal he himself opened. however, In the DS remake, Dalton later resurfaces at the Dimensional Vortex and attacks the party one final time. When defeated, he vows revenge and disappears again after stating he will raise the world's greatest army in Porre and defeat Guardia. A caped silhouette is seen briefly during the attack on Guardia Castle in the ending FMV from the PlayStation and DS versions of the game, and Masato Kato has stated that the armies of Porre received assistance from \\"beyond the regular flow of time\\" in their invasion of Guardia. Zeal is the ruler of the kingdom of the same name in 12,000 BC. Her change from kind and loving to evil and manipulative seems to be linked to her interest in Lavos, whom she wishes to use to achieve power and eternal life. Zeal's court of Enlightened Ones includes her magician and general, Dalton, her young son, Janus, her unwilling daughter, Schala, and the mysterious Prophet (actually Magus in disguise). Zeal becomes the antagonist for a period of the game and eventually becomes the catalyst for the death of Crono. She commissions to have the Mammon Machine built for direct communication to Lavos, as well as to help the creature achieve more power. Eventually, Zeal raises her Ocean Palace and lives in the Black Omen for several thousand years, even into the post- apocalyptic world of 2300 AD. She is eventually killed by Crono and company if they infiltrate the Black Omen. Other appearances In Radical Dreamers Magus appears in Radical Dreamers as Gil, a shadowy and handsome member of the Radical Dreamers thieving group. He is depicted as masked and mysterious, though gentle and cultured. He has the ability to slip in and out of the shadows of the night at will. In the game, Schala's fate is explained as she is seen reincarnated in the present time as a girl named Kid. Gil is mentioned in Chrono Cross in an easter egg designating the events of Radical Dreamers as having taken place in an alternate dimension. In the English version of this easter egg, Gil is referred to as \\"Magil\\". In Xenogears Early in Xenogears, Lucca has a brief cameo appearance in the Lahan Village, in which she gives a tutorial about the basics of the game's battle system and explains save points to Fei. In Chrono Cross In Chrono Cross, Crono, Marle, and Lucca make appearances as ghost children. Kato stated that Crono and Marle's fate \\"is not thoroughly explained in Chrono Cross\\" but that the two were likely involved in \\"some kind of incident\\" related to the invasion of their kingdom by the Porre army. He further explained that an intervention \\"from outside the original flow of history\\" had helped Porre build its military, though the details were left out of Chrono Cross as they did not directly relate to the sequel. On the other hand, Lucca plays a role in the backstory of Chrono Cross, being involved in the \\"Project Kid\\" central to the game's plot and presumably killed by the antagonists Lynx and Harle. An artificial intelligence named Prometheus also plays a part in the plot and is eventually erased by FATE, a supercomputer based on Mother Brain. Masato Kato implied in an interview that this character is the same as Chrono Trigger's Robo, whose real name was also Prometheus. Magus was slated to appear in Chrono Cross. Several designs were considered for his appearance, including one close to his Chrono Trigger design, one as a teenage boy, and one as a masked magician called Guile. However, as development of the game progressed and the number of playable characters increased, the staff decided it would be too difficult to integrate his complex relationship with Schala into the plot. Consequently, Guile's backstory as Magus was removed and his design was altered to look paler. Kato noted that Magus' non-appearance in the game is \\"in a way, […] a pity\\". Though he died in Chrono Trigger, Balthazar reappears alive and well in Chrono Cross due to the changed future created by Crono's actions. Belthasar initiated \\"Project Kid\\", a complicated series of events that would lead to the saving of Schala and the annihilation of the Devourer of Time, thus saving the universe. The Devourer of Time is the result of the defeated Lavos assimilating Schala in the darkness beyond time. In \\"New Game+\\" mode, Ozzie, Slash, and Flea also make an appearance as hidden bosses, nicknamed the \\"mystical knights\\". In other media Gaspar and Johnny appear in the board game Koi Ha Balance: Battle of Lovers released on the Satellaview system. The promotional anime Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar centers on the adventure of a Kilwala and a , a mysterious type of creature which in Chrono Trigger was found in all time periods, usually sleeping. Gato and Johnny also appear in Dimensional Adventure Numa Monjar. Reception IGN described the cast of characters as one that players “immediately fell in love with, and helped “Chrono Trigger” become one of the most beloved RPGs ever released. Games Radar praised the depth of the characters’ sub-plots, which gave the game a deeply “personal” feel. In a retrospective, Game Informer noted that the characters still felt “fresh and interesting” even two decades since the game's original release. Venture Beat described the more realistic proportions of the characters than previous games, which helped give characters a more “human-like” appearance and thus more relatability. The dialogue lets the characters express the emotions they would rather hide, and the games emphasis on character interaction leads to great emotional investment in Chrono and Marie's relationship, Frog's struggles for redemption, and even Magus's eons-long fight for revenge against Lavos. GamePro ranked Lavos the 34th most diabolical video game villain of all time. IGN ranked Lavos 75th in the \\"Top 100 Videogames Villains\\" saying \\"Despite Crono's victory, being the perpetrator of humankind's annihilation while at the same time napping makes Lavos a pretty good candidate for the Top 100 Villains, wouldn't you think?\\". Magus was also ranked 52nd.

It was ported to the Atari, Commodore 64, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, and Vector-06c. The game contained a puzzle which could be solved for a Spy's Demise T-Shirt. According to Antic magazine in June 1984, only four people had solved it. The game was followed by a 1983 sequel, The Spy Strikes Back. Gameplay The first level of Spy's Demise consists of twelve floors. The player must cross the series of floors, one at a time, while avoiding seven elevators at varying positions. Being hit by an elevator results in loss of a life. Finishing all floors starts the next level. Floors are gradually removed from level to level making it more difficult for the player to avoid the elevators. Ports of the game had a music loop of renditions of Eastern European classical and folk tunes, including: * Hungarian Dance #5 * The Comedians \\"Gallop\\" * Katyusha * The Nutcracker \\"Trepak\\" The puzzle consisted of a nine-line cryptogram, one line of which was displayed after completing the corresponding level. It revealed a phone number to call, and a person's name for whom to ask. There is a tenth line in the programming code which is never displayed in the game itself. That tenth line gives a code word that is to be spoken to the person who answers the phone, but it was a trap planted by Penguin Software to foil anyone who tried to solve the puzzle by scanning the program code instead of playing through the end of the game! Development The original title of the game was Poof!, with identical gameplay. For marketing reasons, it was decided to change the graphics to fit a spy theme and Mary Locke at Penguin Software created the animated spy character. The Spy's Demise title was inspired by a drink name at a spy-themed bar in Milwaukee named The Safe House. Reception In the July/August 1983 \\"New Products\\" column of Atari computer magazine ANALOG Computing, the author wrote \\"SPY'S DEMISE is the winner of this issue's 'Potato Chip' award. You can't stop playing it.\\" In 1984 Softline readers named the game the eighth-worst Atari program of 1983, tied with Gwendolyn. Legacy The 1983 sequel, The Spy Strikes Back, was not written by Zeldin, but Penguin Software founder Mark Pelczarski and Robert Hardy. Both games, along with Penguin's Thunderbombs, were later released together as Arcade Album #1 for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit, and Commodore 64. A machine language type-in program for a clone of Spy's Demise was printed in Atari computer magazine ANALOG Computing as Elevator Repairman (1985). Another clone is Elevator (1986) by David Bayliss for MS-DOS.

It is situated on the river White Elster, and is protected from extremes of temperature by the surrounding wooded hills. It is 25 km southeast of Plauen, and 25 km northwest of Cheb. It is part of the Freunde im Herzen Europas microregion.  History  Elster before 1800  Two kilometers north west of the town centre lies the remains of a twelfth- century walled village, known today as the \\"Alte Schloss\\" or \\"Old Castle\\". This was first documented in 1324. In 1412 a manor was sold to the von Zedtwitz family, who held it until 1800. In 1533 the Reformation reached Adorf and its daughter church in Elster, and the first Protestant pastor was installed in 1540. The healing properties of the waters from the spring now known as the Moritzquelle were recognised well before Georg Leisner, physician to the Duke Moritz von Sachsen-Zeitz, wrote in 1669 that inhabitants of both Adorf and Elster come to the spring to take the waters, and he had successfully used them on many different patients. One famous visitor was Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who came in 1795. He mentions the spring at Elster in his work Hermann and Dorothea.  (Bad) Elster in the 19th and 20th century  Elster became an independent parish in 1851. In 1892 the old St. Peter und Paul church was demolished and replaced with the Revival Gothic, St. Trinitatiskirche.

The Technical Site of RAF Locking, as distinct from the RAF Weston-super-Mare airfield about a mile away was the home of the No. 1 Radio School RAF, until its relocation in 1998 to RAF Cosford. 21st century The base was bought by the South West of England Regional Development Agency and the agency English Partnerships from the Ministry of Defence in 2002. The agencies and North Somerset Council intend to attract high-tech companies to the site. In October 2006, Oxford Instruments Plasma Technology became one of the first such companies to announce its move there. Proposals are under consideration for an employment and residential development for the site that could deliver of employment space and up to 1,800 new homes. In July 2011, North Somerset Council gave planning permission for the £50 million LeisureDome, which was to contain a indoor ski slope, a climbing wall, a vertical wind tunnel for indoor skydiving, indoor surfing, a BMX track, a health and fitness club, and a number of shops and restaurants. Construction was planned to finish in early 2013, but in 2015 the future of the project was in doubt because of the need for additional funding, and no mention of the LeisureDome proposals appear on the information provided by St. Modwen Properties, the developers about their plans for Locking Parklands as the site is now known. In 2011, a housing development known as Parklands Village was proposed and eventually went ahead. Monument 2018 The Dedication of the RAFLAA Monument was held at 14.00hrs on Wednesday, 18 July 2018, at Locking Parklands. There were some 70 attendees including: 25 RAFLAA members and wives; the Mayor of Weston-Super-Mare; Chairman of Locking Parish Council; St Modwen Southwest Regional Director; St Modwen Senior Development Manager; Representative from Homes England; Branch Secretary of W-s-M RAFA; Squadron Leader John Clark (Retd.) ex-Flight Commander, RAF Locking. The monument itself is situated across the road from the new community facility, otherwise known as the Radio Wing, also paying homage to the site’s history.

He also earned two caps with the U.S. national team. Since retiring from playing in 2000, he has become a college and youth soccer coach. Player Youth Martin began his college career at UC Berkeley in 1986. However, he transferred to Fresno State where he would go on to play three season (1987–1989) for the Bulldogs. During those three seasons, Martin captained the team and earned honors as the 1989 Big West player of the year, made Big West and Far West Regional First Teams. In 1989, he was also selected as an NCAA First Team All-American. He finished his career at Fresno State with 25 assists. Club In 1987, Martin spent the collegiate off season with the San Jose Earthquakes.1987 San Jose Earthquakes He was First Team All League that season. In 1989, Martin signed with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the Western Soccer Alliance (WSA) as a midfielder.1989 San Francisco Bay Blackhawks In 1990, the WSA merged with the American Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). Martin continued to play with the Blackhawks through the 1992 season when he saw time in only one game for as the team ran to an 8–8 record. At the end of the season, the team's owner moved the Blackhawks to the lower division USISL and renamed the team the San Jose Hawks. Martin spent the 1993 USISL season with the Hawks, but the team folded at the end of the season. He then moved to the semi-pro San Francisco Greek-Americans. Martin and the Greek- Americans won the 1994 U.S. Open Cup. In the fall of 1994, Martin played with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the APSL. In 1995, Martin joined the Atlanta Ruckus of the A-League where he was voted to the USISL All-Star team. In February 1996, the San Jose Clash selected Martin in the third round (twenty- eight overall) in the league's Inaugural Player Draft. He spent three seasons with the Clash before being released at the end of the 1998 season. In 1996, the Clash named Martin the team's Defender of the Year. In February 1999, the Colorado Rapids selected Martin in the third round (thirty-second overall) of the 1999 MLS Supplemental Draft. He spent the 1999 season in Colorado as the Rapids went to the MLS quarterfinals as well as the U.S. Open Cup championship game. Martin retired from the Rapids on February 22, 2000. Following his retirement from MLS, Martin signed with the A-League Bay Area Seals for the 2000 season. He was named the USL Defender of the Year for 2000, then retired permanently. National team Martin earned two caps with the U.S. National Team. His first game with the national team came on November 14, 1993 in an 8–1 win over the Cayman Islands. Martin was a halftime substitute for Jeff Agoos. His second cap came three years later in the infamous October 16, 1996 defeat to Peru. For that game, the United States Soccer Federation was forced to field a team of fringe players after the national team went on strike just prior to the game.

Ants are abundant all over the world, and potential predators that rely on vision to identify their prey, such as birds and wasps, normally avoid them, because they are either unpalatable or aggressive. Spiders are the most common ant mimics. Additionally, some arthropods mimic ants to escape predation (protective mimicry), while others mimic ants anatomically and behaviourally to hunt ants in aggressive mimicry. Ant mimicry has existed almost as long as ants themselves, the earliest ant mimics in the fossil record appear in the mid Cretaceous alongside the earliest ants. Indeed one of the earliest, Burmomyra was initially classified as an ant. In Wasmannian mimicry, mimic and model live commensally together; in the case of ants, the model is an inquiline in the ants' nest. Wasmannian mimics may also be Batesian or aggressive mimics. To overcome ants' powerful defences, mimics may imitate ants chemically with ant-like pheromones, visually (as in Batesian mimicry), or by imitating an ant's surface microstructure for tactile mimicry. Batesian mimicry Batesian mimics are species which typically lack strong defences of their own, and make use of their resemblance to well-defended ants to avoid being attacked by their predators, some of which may be ants. There are ant-mimicking arthropods in several different groups, described below. Orthoptera: Crickets, grasshoppers etc. bush cricket nymph, Macroxiphus sp. Young instars of some Orthoptera, such as the bush cricket Macroxiphus sumatranus, have an \\"uncanny resemblance\\" to ants, extending to their black coloration, remarkably perfect antlike shape, and convincingly antlike behaviour. Their long antennae are camouflaged to appear short, being black only at the base, and they are vibrated like ant antennae. Larger instars suddenly change into typical-looking katydids, and are entirely nocturnal, while the adult has bright warning coloration. Spiders Ant mimicry by a jumping spider, Diolenius phrynoides Over 300 spider species mimic the social behaviours, morphological features and predatory behaviour of ants. Fourteen genera of jumping spiders (Salticidae) mimic ants. The jumping spider genus Myrmarachne are Batesian mimics which resemble the morphological and behavioural properties of ants to near perfection. These spiders mimic the behavioural features of ants such as adapting their zig-zag locomotion pattern, and the act of creating an antennal illusion by waving their first or second pair of legs in the air. The slender bodies of these spiders make them more agile, allowing them to easily escape from predators. Studies on this genus have revealed the major selection force, the avoidance of ants by predators such as spider wasps, that has driven the evolution of ant mimicry in spiders. Ant mimicry has a cost: the body of spider myrmecomorphs is much narrower than non-mimics, reducing the number of eggs per eggsac, compared to non-mimetic spiders of similar size. They seem to compensate by laying more eggsacs over their lifetimes. A study of three species of (predatory) mantises suggested that they innately avoided ants as prey, and that this aversion extends to ant-mimicking Salticidae. True bugs Mirid ant bug, Myrmecoris gracilis Among several Hemiptera (true bugs) that resemble ants are: Dulichius (family Alydidae) and in the Miridae: the wingless Myrmecoris gracilis which feeds on aphids,E. Wachmann, A. Melber, J. Deckert: Cimicomorpha. Microphysidae (Flechtenwanzen), Miridae (Weichwanzen). Goecke & Evers, Keltern 2004. . while Systellonotus triguttatus, in which nymphs and females strongly resemble ants, is often found in the vicinity of ants. Males of Formiscurra indicus (family Caliscelidae) are antlike, but not the females. Stick insects phasmid Extatosoma tiaratum mimics Leptomyrmex ants, unlike the cryptic adult. The phasmid Extatosoma tiaratum, while resembling dried thorny leaves as an adult, hatches from the egg as a replica of a Leptomyrmex ant, with a red head and black body. The long end is curled to make the body shape appear ant-like, and the movement is erratic, while the adults move differently, if at all. In some species the eggs resemble plant seeds, complete with a mimic elaiosome (called a \\"capitulum\\") as in plants that are associated with ants in myrmecochory. These eggs are collected by the ants and taken to their nests. The capitulum is removed and eaten and the eggs continue to be viable. Thrips Franklinothrips is a predatory genus of thrips. Especially the females mimic ants in appearance and behavior. Ant mimicry also occurs in other genera of Aeolothripidae, where it has arisen independently, for example Aeolothrips albicinctus in Europe and A. bicolor in North America, the Australian species Desmothrips reedi, Allelothrips with seven species from Africa and India, Stomatothrips with eight species from the Americas. This kind of mimicry probably evolved as a response to the presence of ants. Mantises While praying mantises are carnivorous insects, they also are in danger of being eaten by larger animals. The young instars of several mantids such as the bark mantid Tarachodes afzelii are Batesian mimics of ants, but there seem to be no mantids that mimic models in any other taxon. Curiously, the young instars derive protection from their resemblance to ants, while bigger instars and adults, neither of which are ant mimics, eat ants. Flies sepsid fly Flies that resemble ants include species in the Richardiidae genus Sepsisoma, which mimic the formicine ant Camponotus crassus. Several species of Micropezidae (stilt-legged flies) resemble ants (especially the wingless, haltere-less Badisis ambulans), as do species in the genus Syringogaster, which \\"strikingly\\" resemble Pseudomyrmex and are hard even for experts to distinguish \\"until they take flight\\". Beetles The ant-mimicking beetle Anthelephila cyanea Many parasitic Staphylinidae that march with army ants strikingly resemble their hosts. An outstanding example is Ecitomorpha nevermanni, whose color varies to match the color variation of its host Eciton burchellii. Since Eciton army ants have poor vision, this is probably an example of Batesian mimicry to escape predation by vertebrates. Some genera of the Anthicidae are ant-like in appearance, for example Anthelephila cyanea. Since Anthelephila do not associate with ants, this is presumably Batesian mimicry. Members of the cerambycid genus Euderces are ant mimics. E. velutinus mimics Camponotus sericeiventris. Several other cerambycids also resemble ants. The Central American Mallocera spinicollis, Neoclytus and Diphyrama singularis all closely resemble stinging ants. Pseudomyrmecion ramalium closely resembles Crematogaster scutellaris in size and coloration and leaves in close vicinity to it. In North America certain Anthoboscus, Cyrtophorus and Tillomorpha are ant mimics. Cyrtinus pygmaeus resembles Lasius niger americanus, and Michthisoma heterodoxum mimics small workers of Camponotus pennsylvanicus.Monné, M. A. & F. T. Hovore. 2005. Electronic checklist of the Cerambycidae of the Western Hemisphere. Bioquip, 393 pp  Plants  Mimicry has evolved in certain plants as a visual anti- herbivory strategy. This is the case in Passiflora flowers, they have dark dots and stripes on their flowers that mimic ants and deter ant avoiding predators. Ants are numerous and act as a deterrent, herbivores often avoid consuming them and this benefits Passiflora flowers as it serves as protection, especially from damage to their reproductive organs. There have been studies that focus on plants that mimic ants in order to benefit pollination processes. The Passiflora flower however, is distinct in that it mimics ants for defensive purposes Aggressive mimicry Aggressive mimics are predators which resemble ants sufficiently to be able to approach their prey successfully. Some spiders, such as the Zodariidae and Myrmarachne species including Myrmarachne melanotarsa, use their disguise to hunt ants. Ant hunters often do not visually resemble ants very closely.Murphy, Frances & Murphy, John (2000): \\"An Introduction to the Spiders of South East Asia\\". Malaysian Nature Society, Kuala Lumpur. Page 303 Aphantochilus rogersi is a spider which mimics Cephalotini ants in which they share a habitat with. A. rogersi solely predate on their model. In addition to exhibiting Batesian and Wasmannian mimicry, A. rogersi demonstrates aggressive mimicry of the Cephalotini ant, this mimicry allows them to approach and prey upon their models without the risk of being attacked by the ant. A. rogersi further resembles Cephalotini in many morphological features, protecting it from visual predators which avoid Cephalotini, an example of Batesian mimicry.  Chemical mimicry   Lycaenid butterflies  Many insects live in habitats with social insects which serves as an asset in obtaining food sources and receiving social benefits from ants. In order to do this, it is necessary for insects to develop strategies so that they are not recognized as an intruder by the members of the colony. It is suggested that chemical mimicry has evolved so that insects can mimic the chemical signals produced by the host species, providing them with a disguise. Chemical signals are a single or complex mixture of substances that can illicit a behavioural response by another organism. Chemical mimicry is used as a tactic by Lycaenid butterfly larvae (Aloeides dentatis and Lepidochrysops ignota) which mimic the ant species Acantholepis caprensis. These Lycaenid mimic the brood pheromone and the alarm call of ants so they can integrate themselves into the nest. In A. dentatis the tubercles release the mimicking pheromone which elicits A. caprensis to care for the mimics as they would their own brood. In these relationships worker ants give the same preference to the Lycaenid's as they do to their own brood, demonstrating that chemical signals produced by the mimic are indistinguishable to the ant. This process is also used by larvae of the European Lycaenid species Phengaris rebeli which live in the nests of Myrmica ants and feed on their ant brood. Wasmannian mimicry Wasmannian mimicry occurs when two species live in close proximity with one another. The mimic then models various features of the model with chemical or morphological mimicry.  Mimicry by parasitoid wasps  Lasius niger The parasitoid wasp Gelis agilis (Ichneumonidae) shares many similarities with the ant Lasius niger. G. agilis is a wingless wasp which exhibits multi-trait mimicry of garden ants. While it is quite common for species to mimic both morphological and behavioural characteristics of their model ants, G. agilis is distinctive as it also exhibits the uncommon anti-predator strategy of chemical mimicry. In addition to Batesian mimicry, the relationship between G. agilis and the black garden wasp also demonstrates Wasmannian mimicry as the two organisms live in close proximity. G.agilis mimics the body size, locomotion and other morphological features of its model ant. When threatened it releases a toxic chemical similar to the ant's alarm pheromone. This multi-trait mimicry serves to protect G. agilis from ground predators such as wolf spiders.  Arthropod mimics of Camponotus planatus  Four species of arthropod mimic the ant Camponotus planatus within the Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve of British Honduras. This is both Batesian and Wassmanian mimicry. The first mimic is the clubnoid spider (Myrmecotypus fuliginosus) which mimics C. planatus in various ways including morphology and behaviour. Secondly, the salticid spider Sarindia linda mimics C. planatus so well that they are hard to distinguish. S. linda mimics the locomotion patterns, pumping of the abdomen, and movements of the antennae. The third mimic is a Mirid bug (Barberiella) which mimics the model in both gait and antennal mimicry. Finally, the mantid, Mantoida maya also uses C. planatus as a model. Individuals that mimic C. planatus are typically 3-9mm long and predators tend to avoid them. All four mimics have been seen foraging in areas with their model with no interference. Tactile mimicry The phoretic mite Planodiscus (Uropodidae) appears to exploit tactile or Wasmannian mimicry. The mite attaches itself to the tibia of its host ant, Eciton hamatum. The cuticular sculpturing of the mite's body as seen under the electron microscope strongly resembles the sculpturing of the ant's leg, as do the arrangements and number of the bristles (setae). The effect is presumed to be that when the ant grooms its leg, the tactile sensation is as it would be in mite-free grooming. Tactile mimicry is found in the cricket Myrmecophila acervorum; its relationship with ants was first studied by Paolo Savis in 1819. It has many ant species as hosts, and occurs in large and small morphs suited to large hosts like Formica and Myrmica, and the small workers of species such as Lasius. On first arriving in an ants' nest, the crickets are attacked by the workers, and are killed if they do not run fast enough, but within a few days they adjust their movements to match those of their hosts, and are then tolerated. Mimicry appears to be achieved by a combination of \\"social releasers\\", whether by imitating \\"solicitation signals\\" with suitable behaviour or ant pheromones with suitable chemicals; Hölldobler and Wilson (1990) propose that Wasmannian mimicry be redefined to permit any such combination.

They gave a concert for the full conference, and were also invited to sing for the Dalai Lama at a small pre-conference gathering.Attwood, Janet Bray Songs of the Divine: An interview from the Dialogues with the Masters Series, Healthy Wealthy nWise, Feb 2008. They had heard that the Dalai Lama's favorite mantra was the Tara Mantra, dedicated to the Green Tara of Compassion, and that he had asked for it be chanted recently when he was ill, so they chanted it for him. Premal's Tibetan Mantras for Precarious Times (2010) was recorded with the Gyuto Monks of Tibet, known for their tradition of overtone singing, also described as \\"chordal chanting\\". It was created as a support for mantra meditation practice, featuring eight mantras chanted 108 times each. It is a benefit CD, with proceeds going to the Gyuto Monastery in Dharmsala, India, the Phowa Project, and Veggiyana.  Music & information  Premal and Miten say they use a process of \\"natural selection\\" to choose the mantras on their albums. Premal has said she gravitates toward Sanskrit mantras, rather than mantras from other languages. She says that, for her, removing her ego from her understanding of the mantra allows the creative process to express the true meaning of the mantra. She explains that the purpose of their work \\"is to be open to the Goddess of music – to be true to ourselves, as musicians, as 'teachers;' as partners, and ultimately, as individuals – fellow travellers. We accomplish this by not 'trying' to accomplish anything. We take very little credit for what is happening around our so-called success (we have sold over a million albums now) – we see ourselves as messengers of a 5,000-year-old tradition...so, our part in the process is simply to show up and chant.\\" Her vocal range is contralto.

The ship was constructed in the 1870s for the Royal Navy to oppose the perceived growing threat from the Italian Regia Marina in the Mediterranean. The Italian Navy had started constructing a pair of battleships, and , equipped with four Armstrong 17.7-inch (450 mm) guns weighing 100 tons each. These were superior to the armament of any ship in the British Mediterranean Squadron, and Inflexible was designed as a counter to them. Inflexible mounted larger guns than those of any previous British warship and had the thickest armour ever to be fitted to a Royal Navy ship. Controversially, she was designed so that if her un-armoured ends should be seriously damaged in action and become water-logged, the buoyancy of the armoured centre section of the ship would keep her afloat and upright. The ship was the first major warship to depend in part for the protection of her buoyancy on a horizontal armoured deck below the water-line rather than armoured sides along the waterline. Design thumbleft300pxPlans of Inflexible as shown in Brasseys Naval Annual A heavily armoured citadel wide and long was located amidships, which would keep the ship afloat and stable regardless of what happened to the ends. This citadel contained the main guns, the boilers and the engines. The ends were unarmoured, but with a armoured deck 6–8 ft below the waterline to limit damage to the underwater section to keep them buoyant. Coal bunkers were located over the armoured deck and surrounded by compartments filled with cork. The ship had bunker capacity for 400 tons of coal below the deck for use during combat, when the above-deck bunkers would be inaccessible and possibly flooded. The structure above the armoured deck also contained a large number of watertight compartments to further preserve buoyancy. There was also light superstructure to provide crew accommodation, and freeboard in rough weather, although anticipated to be seriously damaged in any major engagement. Barnaby wanted a ship both broader than existing designs to mimimise rolling and as short as possible to reduce its size as a target. Making a ship broader compared to its length was known to reduce its speed, so the innovative technique of water tank tests on models, pioneered by William Froude, was used to finalise a design. This was ten feet wider than Duillo and twenty-one feet shorter, the smallest ever ratio of length to breadth in a metal first class warship.Padfield p.84 Once the outline design was agreed, the detailed architectural design was done by William White and she was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 24 February 1874. Controversy Inflexible was launched 27 April 1876. Later that year the MP Edward Reed, formerly Director of Naval Construction, visited the Italian ships and subsequently questioned their stability if the unarmoured ends were flooded. As Inflexible was of similar design, he raised grave concerns about it too. When he failed to persuade the Admiralty, in June 1877 he publicised his charges in The Times. An editorial in the same edition, 18 June, said \\"it is said that the unarmoured ends are, in fact, the corks on which she floats, that she cannot swim without them, and it would appear that if she lost one she would capsize\\". Further exchanges followed until in July, construction was halted on Inflexible (and two other smaller ships, and ) whilst a hastily convened committee examined the design. In their report published in December 1877, they concluded that it would be hard for gunfire to completely flood the unarmoured but heavily compartmentalised and partially cork-filled ends. However, if this was managed then the ship would just be stable, capsizing at about 35 degrees heel. Work restarted on the ship in December 1877, and the ship was commissioned 5 July 1881, under Captain John Fisher, although she was not completed until 18 October. Her eventual cost was £812,000. Main armament Main guns Drawing depicting one of the gun turrets Turret cross-section showing guns pointing downwards for reloading To counter the perceived threat from the Italians, Inflexible was to be equipped with four of the largest guns available, weighing 60 tons each. In October 1874 it was decided to modify the design of Inflexible to use an even bigger gun which Armstrongs was producing, a 16-inch (406 mm) gun weighing 81 tons. The Italians responded by changing their design to take even larger 100-ton 17.7-inch (450 mm) Armstrongs guns. As these could not be fitted to Inflexible, four examples were ordered by the British Government, two each for the coastal defences around Gibraltar and Malta respectively. Two of these guns still exist, at Fort Rinnella on Malta and at the Napier of Magdala Battery on Gibraltar. The four 81-ton muzzle-loading rifles were mounted in two turrets mounted en echelon, with the forward turret mounted on the port side of the ship and the after turret on the starboard side. The superstructure both fore and aft was very narrow to allow one gun in each turret to fire axially, i.e. directly forward or directly aft. In practice, as in previous ships, it was found that axial fire led to so much blast damage to the ship's superstructure that it was impractical. However, the en-echelon arrangement also meant that at least three guns could fire on bearings close to fore and aft. All four guns could be fired broadside. The en-echelon configuration was retained for the two ships of the Colossus class, but subsequently abandoned in the Royal Navy in favour of centreline mounts at either end of the ship. The en-echelon configuration did not reappear in Royal Navy capital ships until launched in 1909. Each turret weighed 750 tons and was protected by an outer layer of of compound armour, an inner layer of wrought iron, with a total of of teak backing. The turrets were rotated hydraulically, taking around a minute to perform a complete rotation. Inflexibles guns were muzzle loaded, and because of their length could not be reloaded from inside the turrets. Consequently reloading was done using hydraulic rams fitted outside the two turrets underneath an armoured glacis. To reload the guns, the turret was rotated to align the guns with the rams, and the guns depressed so that the rams could push the gunpowder charge and 1,684-pound shell into it. The rams had to be extended twice: First, to extinguish any burning material remaining inside the gun using a sponge and water jet fixed to the end of the ram, and then again after charge, shell and wadding had been placed on a loading tray in front of it to be driven into the gun. The shell had a copper disk at its base which engaged with rifled grooves cut into the barrel to spin the shell, rather than zinc studs used on earlier designs. Tests showed that the normal full charge of 450 pounds of brown prismatic gunpowder would produce a muzzle velocity of , which could penetrate of wrought iron armour at . The muzzle loading took between 2.5 and four minutes. Ram She was also equipped with a ram – ramming was considered a practical means of sinking an enemy battleship at that time. The Italian Re d'Italia had been rammed and sunk by the Austrian flagship, Ferdinand Max, at the Battle of Lissa in 1866. This had started a vogue for ramming (which persisted until the 1890s), and many naval experts even believed this was the most effective weapon a ship could have. For example Gerard Noel won the 1874 Royal United Services Institute essay contest with an article that asserted that \\"[i]n a general action I do not hold that the guns will be the principal weapon\\". This was less surprising than it might seem to modern eyes, because it was expected that naval battles would be fought at a range of only a couple of thousand metres. The advent of steam power meant that ships were no longer restricted in manoeuvring by wind direction and had led to a belief that it would be possible to steer into enemy ships. Rams turned out to be a handicap in retrospect, as several warships were accidentally sunk by them – for example by in 1875, and by in 1893. Whilst this showed the considerable potency of a ram, it also demonstrated the inadequate manoeuvring characteristics of many of the ships equipped with them. The ram was designed to be removable to avoid damage during accidental collisions, but although other ships customarily carried theirs detached, Inflexible seems to have kept hers in place. The ram was a solid iron forging supported by an extension of the armoured deck which turned downwards behind it.Padfield p. 86 Torpedoes The ship was fitted with two underwater torpedo tubes. These were cast-iron cylinders attached to a swivel joint in the hull, one on each bow. Inside the ship the opposite end was attached to a graduated scale for targeting. There was a watertight door at either end of the tube. The torpedoes were loaded inside a brass cylinder which slid into the iron casting. To fire the torpedo, the outer door was opened and a guide was extended which helped the torpedo clear the currents around the ship. A piston in the brass cylinder forced out the torpedo when it was to be fired, and at the same time its own compressed air motor was started. Protection The central citadel in particular was exceptionally heavily armoured. At the waterline, the armour consisted of a layer of armour plate backed by of teak. Behind this was another armour plate backed by of teak. Finally on the inside of this were two layers of shell plating. This layer of protection weighed 1,100 pounds per square foot. 24 inches of armour was considered almost completely proof against any contemporary gun and is still the thickest armour which has ever been used on a battleship. The armour was reduced to thick above the waterline, with a outer plate and an inner one, with the thickness of teak increased to to maintain the same overall thickness of protection. Below the waterline, again there was a outer plate, but with a inner plate, with of teak backing in total to maintain the overall thickness of protection at 41 inches. Outside the citadel, above the armoured deck were a large number of small watertight compartments used to hold coal and stores. Between them and the hull were compartments filled with cork and containing a coffer dam. The dam was filled with oakum and canvas which had been shown to help reduce the size of the hole made by a projectile passing through the coffer dam. All of these materials were treated with calcium chloride to try to reduce their flammability. Experiments were carried out with firing 64-pounder shells into full scale replicas of the cork compartments and coffer dams. Propulsion Inflexible in 1881port quarter sometime prior to the 1885 removal of her full sailing rig.Inflexible late in her career while serving as port guard ship at Portsmouth between 1893 and 1897. With a slenderness ratio of 4.6:1 Inflexible was a stable gun platform. Work by the hydrodynamicist William Froude had demonstrated that such a short length for the ship's width would not require excessive installed power at the design speed of . However, the same proportions were adopted in the similar but smaller and , but resulted in a serious lack of directional stability in those ships. The ship had two compound steam engines manufactured by John Elder and company. Each had one high-pressure and two low-pressure cylinders connected to a crankshaft. The connecting rods were in diameter attached to bearings on the crankshaft. A hollow steel shaft drove each of the two screws at a maximum 75 rpm. There were two boiler rooms, one each end of the engine room. Each contained two and two boilers operating at 61 psi. Similar high pressure systems had been used on HMS Alexandra launched in 1875 and Temeraire in 1876, but they were a recent innovation and more economical than the previous low pressure engines. Gangs of stokers were continuously bringing coal from the bunkers to feed the fires. The ship had a further 39 smaller engines for various purposes including bilge pumps capable of shifting 300 tons of water per hour, pumps for cooling water through the steam condensers, fans to draw air through the ship through a system of ventilation ducts, steering gear, hydraulic pumps for the guns, air compressors, winches and for generating electricity. The engine room was noisy, wet, greasy, oily and steamy. It would be a normal occurrence for engines to leak steam and for bearings to run hot so that they had to be hosed down to keep them operating. All the essential equipment was contained within the armoured citadel.Padfield p. 86-87 Although she was propelled principally by steam, she was equipped with a pair of masts and yards, so that of sail could be deployed. This was to help exercise and train the crew, especially as such an area of sail (less than per ton) would hardly move the ship. As Jackie Fisher wrote: \\"The sails had so much effect upon her in a gale of wind as a fly would have on a Hippopotamus in producing any movement.\\" The masts and sails were removed after four years in service, and replaced by simple pole masts for carrying signal flags and circular fighting tops, platforms carrying quick firing guns. Innovations She was also the first Royal Navy ship to be completely lit by electricity, and the first to have underwater torpedo tubes. The electrical installation provided 800 volts DC to power arc lamps in the engine and boiler rooms and Swan incandescent bulbs in other parts of the ship. The circuitry was complicated because the lighting consisted of sets of 18 Swan lamps and an arc lamp arranged in series. Each incandescent bulb was fitted with an automatic mechanism to switch in a resistor to maintain continuity should it fail, so that the set of 19 lights would not be extinguished if one failed. The arrangement also led to the first fatal electrocution on a Royal Navy ship, in 1882, after which the Navy adopted an 80 volt standard for its ships. Sectional drawing of HMS Inflexible The ship was equipped with many other novelties, including water tanks to dampen the roll, which turned out to be useless. Much of the ship was without natural illumination, and Fisher had different deck levels painted in contrasting colours to make it easier for crew members to find their way around the ship. Service history On completion the ship was sent to join the Mediterranean squadron. She took part in the bombardment of Alexandria on 11 July 1882 during the Urabi Revolt, firing 88 shells and was struck herself twice; one 10-inch (254mm) shell killed the ship's carpenter, mortally wounded an officer directing the fire of a 20-pounder breech-loader, and injured a seaman. The blast from Inflexibles own guns did considerable damage to upperworks and boats. She was at this point under command of Captain John Arbuthnot Fisher.Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.304 She was refitted in Portsmouth in 1885, when the full sailing rig was removed. She was in the Fleet Reserve until 1890, except for brief service in the 1887 review and the manoeuvres of 1889 and 1890. She was re-commissioned for the Mediterranean Fleet from 1890 to 1893, serving thereafter as Portsmouth guard ship until 1897. From there she went to Fleet Reserve, and in April 1902 to Dockyard Reserve, until sold at Chatham in 1903 for scrap.

Early life and education  Farrukh Ahmad was born in the village of Majhail of Sreepur Upazila of Magura District. He was the second son of Syed Hatem Ali and Begum Rawshan. He graduated from Khulna Zila School in 1937 and did his IA from Ripon College, Kolkata in 1939. He then enrolled at the prestigious Scottish Church College to pursue a BA (Hons) in Philosophy and English Literature, but was unable to his complete studies there.Some Alumni of Scottish Church College in 175th Year Commemoration Volume. Scottish Church College, April 2008, p. 589. Subsequently, he studied at the City College. He married his cousin Saieda Taieba Khatun in 1942. He started his professional life in Inspector General (IG) Prison Office in 1943. He worked for Civil Supply for a short time in 1944. As a student, Farrukh Ahmad had been attracted to the radical humanism of Manabendra Nath Roy and had participated in leftist politics. From the forties, however, he supported the Pakistan movement to have an independent Muslim state created within the region of South Asia from the British Indian empire. Despite his Pakistani and Islamic ideals, he supported the Language Movement in 1952 and, later, the liberation war of Bangladesh.

It is a part of the municipality of Zoeterwoude, and lies about 3.5 km south of Leiden. It has its origins in the 13th century, and even though the whole town went up in flames in the late 16th century, it was rebuilt within a hundred years and significantly expanded over the course of the 20th century. History Although signs of human settlement in the Zoeterwoude region were dated to as early as the 8th century in the vicinity of present-day Weipoort, a village on the current location of Zoeterwoude-Dorp was not constructed until about 1276 when the mire in the area was cultivated. A Catholic church from the earlier village dedicated to the English missionary Saint Lebuinus was rebuilt in what was then called \\"Zwieterwoude\\". Over the course of the centuries, the village was constructed with this Lebuinus church as its center. In the 15th century, the northern part of town became known as \\"Noordbuurt\\" (). In 1574, Zoeterwoude-Dorp was burnt down by the neighbouring town of Leiden. Leiden did this in order to protect itself against the Spanish in the Eighty Years' War, which had come to envelope the entire country. The town was rebuilt by 1650. During the 19th century, the town saw some changes. The Dorpsstraat () was outfitted with nine new houses in 1828, while in 1866 a cow bush (a burial place for cows that died of anthrax – a disease to which the town was no stranger) was removed. In 1870 the town hall was moved from a rental building at the Hoge Rijndijk () to a new building at its present location at the Noordbuurtseweg. In the 20th century, the town was expanded significantly. After World War II, three new neighbourhoods named Westwout, Vogelweide and Bloemenweide were built on the west side of the town, giving the town its current function as the heart of the Zoeterwoude municipality, and a residential center. Attempts to discover more information about the origins of the town were thwarted in October 1981, when an archaeological survey in the centre of the town failed to unveil anything of note. Demographics In 2015, the town of Zoeterwoude-Dorp had 4205 inhabitants, which means that in the previous four years the population has shrunk by 280. In 2001, the built-up area of the town was calculated to be 0.87 km² and containing 1576 residences.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Bevolkingskernen in Nederland 2001. (Statistics are for the continuous built-up area). Politics During the last general election, in 2012 voters in the three polling stations within Zoeterwoude-Dorp gave the VVD the highest share of the vote. With 31.7% in Huize Emmaus, 34.4% in the town hall and 31.4% in the Muziekcentrum (), the VVD in Zoeterwoude-Dorp outperformed its national average of 26.6%. The PvdA came in second – underperforming its national average by 2.6–4.4% across the three polling stations – while CDA came in third overperforming their national average by 2.8–6%. Education In the late 19th century, Zoeterwoude-Dorp had only one primary school. It was a municipal school located in the Dorpsstraat ()., which survived until the 1960s when it was taken down. The school had become outdated, and too small for the current population. Nowadays, the town has three primary schools: Klaverweide (founded in 1979), Corbulo (founded in 1985), and Westwoud (founded in 1985). In 2014, an investigation was opened to see if the three primary schools could merge into a 'broad school' in 2018, A plan was put forward and approved, allowing for a new building to be constructed at the Bennebroekweg in the centre of the town. When the merger is completed, Zoeterwoude-Dorp will have only one primary school left. Transportation Road In the west, Zoeterwoude-Dorp is connected to the A4 motorway through its seventh exit, which directly connects Zoeterwoude-Dorp to The Hague and Amsterdam, as well as its municipal neighbour Zoeterwoude-Rijndijk. Along the western border, provincial motorway N206 connects Zoeterwoude-Dorp to Stompwijk in the south and Leiden in the north. The Molenpad () in the northeast allows pedestrians and cyclists to travel to Zoeterwoude-Rijndijk, while the town's southern exit at the Zuidbuurtseweg () leads to Zuidbuurt. The Nieuwe Weg () in the southeast connects the town to Weipoort. Bus Two bus routes cross Zoeterwoude-Dorp. Bus route 400 (served by Arriva) has two stops along the western edge of the town, and takes the passenger either to Leiden in the north or Zoetermeer in the south. Prior to 2015, the 400 was numbered 365 and made an hourly ride through to the town itself. When Ariva was planning to scrap the route in 2013 (which was inherited from Connexxion which served Zoeterwoude-Dorp previously with their now defunct route 32), inhabitants protested and Arriva eventually caved. Bus route 176 is the one now making stops at various locations within the town itself. Popular culture A street in the northern part of the town, Laan van Oud Raadwijk (), was used as a backdrop for the 1960s and 1970s Dutch television series Swiebertje.

It grows in submontane to montane forest in damp areas, particularly near the tree line. The trunk is usually prostrate, but may sometimes be erect. It may reach about 1 m in height. Fronds are tripinnate and about 1.5 m long or more. The rachis and stipe are slender, pale brown and are covered with brown scales. Sori occur in two rows, one along each side of the fertile pinnule midvein, and lack indusia. Plants form a thicket with no sign of a trunk. In cultivation, this species requires rich humus, good shade and much moisture. Being a montane plant, it does well in cooler regions. The specific epithet colensoi commemorates William Colenso (1811-1899), a missionary and New Zealand botanist.

They are the twin children of Thena, leader of the Eternals, and Kro, sometime leader of the race of Deviants. The Ritter twins were created by Roy Thomas, Dann Thomas and Mark Texeira. The twins first appeared in the one-shot special Eternals: The Herod Factor. Fictional character biographies Thena and Kro, despite being members of two offshoots of humanity who have been traditional enemies, have had a relationship for over 25,000 years. During the Vietnam war, the two had a sexual encounter, and Thena discovered she was pregnant. Using her powers, she secretly implanted the embryos into an infertile human woman, and the two grew up unaware of their ancestry. When Dr. Daniel Damian, a human who was aware of the existence of Deviants and Eternals, sent a monster (formerly Ajak) to slay the two children, killing numerous other sets of twins in the process, Thena took the two to Olympia, the city of Eternals, but did not inform them of their heritage. However, even Olympia proved unsafe, and the monster captured the two and fled to Peru, where they confronted Damian. The Twins learned of their true origin, and were rescued by Kro and Thena. The Ritter twins have been shown twice since then; In Avengers #370-371, the two joined Kro's Delta Network, and demonstrated the ability to merge into a two-mouthed, four-eyed and four-armed creature calling itself Tzabaoth. In Heroes for Hire #6, they again merged, this time forming into a sleek, winged metallic creature called Dark Angel. In both stories, the twins were supposedly merging for the \\"first\\" time, and both stories also portrayed the \\"resurrection\\" of the Deviant Ghaur, suggesting that perhaps the writers of these stories were unaware that these characters had already been used in this way. Both Tzabaoth and Dark Angel had Eternal-like abilities, including great strength and durability, flight, and the power to fire energy beams from its eyes. Notes The Ritter Twins are not the only characters to use the identity of Dark Angel. These include: *A former CIA agent was known as the Dark Angel. She first appeared in Master of Kung Fu vol. 1 #107 *Jessica Drew was called the Dark Angel in Spider-Woman vol. 1 #1 *X-Men member, Archangel was called the Dark Angel in X-Factor vol. 1 #34. *The Guardian of Souls was known as the Darkangel.

The longer of the two pairs will always be the one that crosses. Antiparallelograms are also called contraparallelograms. or crossed parallelograms. An antiparallelogram is a special case of a crossed quadrilateral, which has generally unequal edges.Quadrilaterals A special form of the antiparallelogram is a crossed rectangle, in which two opposite edges are parallel. Properties Every antiparallelogram has an axis of symmetry through its crossing point. Because of this symmetry, it has two pairs of equal angles as well as two pairs of equal sides. Together with the kites and the isosceles trapezoids, antiparallelograms form one of three basic classes of quadrilaterals with a symmetry axis. The convex hull of an antiparallelogram is an isosceles trapezoid, and every antiparallelogram may be formed from the non-parallel sides (or either pair of parallel sides in case of a rectangle) and diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid.. Every antiparallelogram is a cyclic quadrilateral, meaning that its four vertices all lie on a single circle. In polyhedra Several nonconvex uniform polyhedra, including the tetrahemihexahedron, cubohemioctahedron, octahemioctahedron, small rhombihexahedron, small icosihemidodecahedron, and small dodecahemidodecahedron, have antiparallelograms as their vertex figures, the cross-sections formed by slicing the polyhedron by a plane that passes near a vertex, perpendicularly to the axis between the vertex and the center.. For uniform polyhedra of this type in which the faces do not pass through the center point of the polyhedron, the dual polyhedron has antiparallelograms as its faces; examples of dual uniform polyhedra with antiparallelogram faces include the small rhombihexacron, the great rhombihexacron, the small rhombidodecacron, the great rhombidodecacron, the small dodecicosacron, and the great dodecicosacron. The antiparallelograms that form the faces of these dual uniform polyhedra are the same antiparallelograms that form the vertex figure of the original uniform polyhedron. Bricard octahedron constructed as a double pyramid over an anti­parallelogram. One form of a non-uniform but flexible polyhedron, the Bricard octahedron, can be constructed as a double pyramid over an antiparallelogram. . Four-bar linkages The antiparallelogram has been used as a form of four-bar linkage, in which four rigid beams of fixed length (the four sides of the antiparallelogram) may rotate with respect to each other at joints placed at the four vertices of the antiparallelogram. In this context it is also called a butterfly or bow-tie linkage. As a linkage, it has a point of instability in which it can be converted into a parallelogram and vice versa. Fixing the short edge of an anti­parallelogram linkage causes the crossing point to trace out an ellipse. If one of the short (uncrossed) edges of an antiparallelogram linkage is fixed in place, and the remaining linkage moves freely, then the crossing point of the antiparallelogram traces out an ellipse that has the fixed edge's endpoints as its foci. The other moving short edge of the antiparallelogram has as its endpoints the foci of another moving ellipse, formed from the first one by reflection across a tangent line through the crossing point.. For both the parallelogram and antiparallelogram linkages, if one of the long (crossed) edges of the linkage is fixed as a base, the free joints move on equal circles, but in a parallelogram they move in the same direction with equal velocities while in the antiparallelogram they move in opposite directions with unequal velocities.. As James Watt discovered, if an antiparallelogram has its long side fixed in this way it forms a variant of Watt's linkage, and the midpoint of the unfixed long edge will trace out a lemniscate or figure eight curve. For the antiparallelogram formed by the sides and diagonals of a square, it is the lemniscate of Bernoulli., pp. 58–59. The antiparallelogram is an important feature in the design of Hart's inversor, a linkage that (like the Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage) can convert rotary motion to straight-line motion.. An antiparallelogram-shaped linkage can also be used to connect the two axles of a four-wheeled vehicle, decreasing the turning radius of the vehicle relative to a suspension that only allows one axle to turn.. A pair of nested antiparallelograms was used in a linkage defined by Alfred Kempe as part of his universality theorem stating that any algebraic curve may be traced out by the joints of a suitably defined linkage. Kempe called the nested-antiparallelogram linkage a \\"multiplicator\\", as it could be used to multiply an angle by an integer. Antiparallelogram braced to stop it turning into a normal parallelogram. The points PQRS are the midpoints of the sides and are collinear, and X can be any distance away on the perpendicular bisector of SQ. With this linkage . Without bracing an antiparallelogram linkage can be turned into a normal parallelogram. It can be braced to stop this happening using a construction by Abbott and Barton 2004. This construction can be used to fix a problem in Kempe's Universality Theorem. Celestial mechanics In the n-body problem, the study of the motions of point masses under Newton's law of universal gravitation, an important role is played by central configurations, solutions to the n-body problem in which all of the bodies rotate around some central point as if they were rigidly connected to each other. For instance, for three bodies, there are five solutions of this type, given by the five Lagrangian points. For four bodies, with two pairs of the bodies having equal masses (but with the ratio between the masses of the two pairs varying continuously), numerical evidence indicates that there exists a continuous family of central configurations, related to each other by the motion of an antiparallelogram linkage. .

Much of his work is satirical. Early life Born Igor Semyonovich Shteyngart () in the Soviet Union, he spent the first seven years of his childhood living in a square dominated by a huge statue of Vladimir Lenin in what is now St. Petersburg—which he alternately calls \\"St. Leningrad\\" or \\"St. Leninsburg\\". He comes from a Jewish family, with an ethnically Russian maternal grandparent, and describes his family as typically Soviet. His father worked as an engineer in a LOMO camera factory; his mother was a pianist. When he was five, he wrote a 100-page comic novel. Shteyngart immigrated to the United States in 1979 and was brought up in Queens, New York, with no television in the apartment in which he lived, where English was not the household language. He did not shed his thick Russian accent until the age of 14. He is a graduate of Stuyvesant High School in New York City, and Oberlin College in Ohio, where he earned a degree in politics, in 1995, with a senior thesis on the former Soviet republics of Georgia, Moldova and Tajikistan. Career After Oberlin, he worked a series of jobs, as a writer, for non-profit organizations in New York.Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society Shteyngart took a trip to Prague in the early 1990s, and this experience helped spawn his first novel, The Russian Debutante's Handbook, set in the fictitious European city of Prava. In 1999, as part of the application to Hunter College’s MFA program he mailed a portion of his first novel to Chang-Rae Lee, the director of the creative writing program at Hunter College. Lee helped Shteyngart get his first book deal. Shteyngart earned an MFA in Creative Writing at Hunter College of the City University of New York. Shteyngart had a fellowship at the American Academy in Berlin, Germany, for Fall 2007. He has taught writing at Hunter College, and currently teaches writing at Columbia University. Awards Shteyngart's work has received numerous awards. The Russian Debutante's Handbook won the Stephen Crane Award for First Fiction, the Book-of-the-Month Club First Fiction Award and the National Jewish Book Award for Fiction. It was named a New York Times Notable Book and one of the best debuts of the year by The Guardian snapshot 2011-05-13 at archive.org In 2002, he was named one of the five best new writers by Shout NY Magazine. Absurdistan was chosen as one of the ten best books of the year by The New York Times Book Review and Time magazine, as well as a book of the year by the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, San Francisco Chronicle and many other publications. In June 2010, Shteyngart was named as one of The New Yorker magazine's \\"20 under 40\\" luminary fiction writers. Super Sad True Love Story won the 2011 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for comic literature. His memoir Little Failure was a finalist for the 2014 National Book Critics Circle Award (Autobiography). Work Shteyngart's novels include The Russian Debutante's Handbook (2002), and Absurdistan (2006). Super Sad True Love Story (2010) was promoted by a film trailer with Paul Giamatti and James Franco. Thirty-five years after he emigrated to the U.S., in January, 2014, Random House published Little Failure: A Memoir, and promoted it by a film trailer with James Franco and Rashida Jones. His 2018 book, Lake Success was promoted by a film trailer with Ben Stiller. His other writing has appeared in The New Yorker, Slate, Granta, Travel and Leisure, and The New York Times. Blurbs Shteyngart has also become known for his prolific blurbing, which has inspired a Tumblr website devoted to his Collected Blurbs, a live reading, and a fifteen-minute documentary narrated by Jonathan Ames.

It stars Eddie Foy Jr. and Audrey Christie. Premise Eddie Walker (Foy) and Tommy Finch (Victor Maddern) were World War II veterans and old friends who decided to have their teenage daughters live in each other's households for a year because Eddie's daughter Patty (Lynn Loring) wanted to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London. While Patty lived in London with Tommy, his wife Sybil (Diana Chesney) and their son, Neville (Dennis Waterman), their daughter, Heather (Judy Carne) lived with Eddie and Dorothy Walker and their son, also named Tommy (Flip Mark) in New York. The show focuses on the joys and the difficulties that Heather and Patty experience as they live in each other's families. Heather had troubles in trying to deal with a less formality ridden way of life in New York City and in the States, while Patty was trying to deal with the more formal and more tradition-emphasized way of life in London. The fathers had their own share of difficulties in trying to help the daughters to adjust, while Dorothy and Sybil, while also having to adjust with different girls living in their households, were able to take it more in stride. Fair Exchange replaced Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone on CBS's fall schedule in 1962. The series was the first hour-long sitcom since The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour, but it was dropped. After mail protested CBS's decision, the network revived Fair Exchange in a half-hour format, but again the series failed in the ratings and was finally cancelled. The Twilight Zone would replace Fair Exchange mid-season, albeit in an hour-long format.

Formerly a United States air-sea rescue vessel during World War II, she later served as an oceanographic research platform before sinking in 1976. Ship history The vessel was built by the Casey Boat Building Company Inc., of Fairhaven, Massachusetts, in early 1943, as a Design 235 U.S. Army Air Force crash rescue boat, and designated P-102. As the largest of the crash boats the Design 235-class were equipped with emergency medical facilities which could accommodate up to 23 people, which the crew of 12 were all cross-trained to operate. Under the name USCB Shearwater, the United States Crash Boat operated from the Naval Air Station Argentia until 10 September 1947, when she was purchased by the Newfoundland Tuberculosis Association for US$5,000 and converted into a floating clinic. Since the purchase of the boat was funded by the sale of Christmas Seals, she was renamed M/V Christmas Seal. From 1947 the vessel sailed to isolated outports on the coast of Newfoundland, screening residents for tuberculosis, which was a leading cause of death on the island. Under the command of Captain Peter Troake from 1950, the ship was fitted to provide chest X-rays, and also carried out vaccinations for TB and polio, and tested for diabetes. Doctors, nurses, technicians, and health educators staffed the vessel in addition to the operating crew The ship also provided general health education in the form of leaflets, talks and film shows, as well as providing emergency medical evacuations. A measure of the success of Christmas Seal can be seen in mortality rates; in 1947 there were 500 deaths from TB in the province, in 1958 it was 64. By 1970, the decline in rates of infection, and the improvements in road access on the island, meant that the services of Christmas Seal were no longer required. She was sold to a Lewisporte man who later chartered her to the Bedford Institute of Oceanography. On the morning of 13 May 1976 Christmas Seal sailed from Halifax, Nova Scotia, but after three hours suffered an explosion in her engine room. The coast guard and several nearby ships responded to their mayday signal, and the crew of eight were rescued, with only one man slightly injured. The ship burned and eventually sank. In 2006 wood salvaged from Christmas Seal was contributed to the construction of the Six String Nation project. Part of that material now serves as kerfing on the interior of Voyageur, the guitar at the heart of the project.

The original 20th Television was the syndication and distribution arm of 20th Century Fox Television. It was part of The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of the majority of 21st Century Fox's assets. Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox was completed on March 20, 2019. History 20th Century Fox Television was originally formed in 1949 by 20th Century Fox as other studios were branching out into television production as well. At that time, the company was known as TCF Television Productions, Inc. until 1958. Decades later, TCFTV folded the operations of TV production companies it has acquired: Metromedia Producers Corporation in 1986, New World Entertainment in 1997, and MTM Enterprises in 1998, and is the current distributor (via its distribution division, the original 20th Television) for most of the shows originally produced by these companies. From 1986-2019, 20th Century Fox Television served as the Fox television network's official production arm (with Fox Television Studios being viewed as the network's unofficial television production division), producing the bulk of television series airing on the television network. TCFTV produced the first two series that aired on Fox's sister network, MyNetworkTV: the telenovelas Desire and Fashion House. In 1989, 20th Century Fox Television's functions were taken over by Twentieth Television Corporation, a separate entity from 20th Century Fox. Both companies were subsidiaries of News Corporation unit Fox Inc.; the move was made to separate the television productions from the movie studio in order to increase the latter's output. Following a 1994 restructuring of Fox's television production companies, 20th Television was refocused on syndication and \\"non-traditional programs\\", while network television programming once more came under the 20th Century Fox Television banner and returned to being a division of the movie studio. In 1997, MTM Enterprises became part of 20th Century Fox Television, and thus remains an in-name only division of TCFTV. In 2012, 20th Century Fox Television was reorganized as a separate unit of News Corporation; 20th Century Fox Television chairs Dana Walden and Gary Newman now report to Chase Carey, COO of 21st Century Fox. In July 2014, it was announced that the operations of the Fox Broadcasting Company and 20th Century Fox Television would merge into a new unit, the Fox Television Group, which was overseen by Walden and Newman. In early 2015, Mythology Entertainment signed a first look deal with the company and fellow company Fox 21 Television Studios while announcing its TV division head. 20th Television distribution arm The original incarnation of 20th Television was the television distribution arm of 20th Century Fox Television and the 20th Century Fox movie studio. It was formed in 1989 in order to separate television production from the 20th Century Fox division which oversaw film production. During this time, 20th Television and 20th Century Fox served as two of Fox's four main units, along with the Fox Broadcasting Company and Fox Television Stations. Following a 1994 restructuring of Fox's television production companies, 20th Television was refocused on syndication and \\"non-traditional programs\\"; its network television division was moved back to 20th Century Fox and retook the 20th Century Fox Television name. 20th Television distributes almost all programming and documentaries from the television production unit including Foxstar Productions and its subsidiaries and the motion picture studio's output (and their own subdivisions). It owns programming from other production companies and studios they have acquired, including MTM Enterprises, most by Metromedia Producers Corporation, and most by New World Entertainment (including those by Four Star Television and Genesis Entertainment). The company also syndicates and/or co-syndicates product from partners such as Regency Television and Debmar-Mercury (until April 2019). The Lincolnwood Drive subsidiary of 20th Television has been used to produce the syndicated court series Divorce Court since the 2014-15 season, mainly for tax reasons. In 1992, Greg Meidel became president of 20th Television, serving until 1995. Meidel was president of MyNetworkTV when he add 20th Television's same position to his responsibility in 2009. As part of the restructuring that stemmed from News Corporation spinning off its entertainment assets into 21st Century Fox, it was announced on July 8, 2013, that 20th Television will operate under the management of 20th Century Fox Television; it was previously under Fox Television Stations. As a result, the former company's president reported to the latter's chairmen. Under Disney Television Studios In March 2019, both 20th Century Fox Television and 20th Television were acquired by the Walt Disney Company and integrated into Walt Disney Television as part of Disney Television Studios. As a result, Newman departed and Walden was made head of Disney programming. Jonnie Davis and Howard Kurtzman, who previously held high ranking positions with the Fox Television Group, became the co-heads of 20th Century Fox Television. In July 2019, Disney promoted Davis to the position of President of ABC Studios. Carolyn Cassidy succeeded Davis as President of Creative Affairs at 20th Century Fox Television, running the studio jointly with Kurtzman. In January 2020, Kurtzman announced that he would retire by June 2020.

Her most notable published work is the novel Hope's Highway (1918) and Clouds and Sunshine (1920). She was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and grew up in Brooklyn. Growing up, she had aspirations to become a schoolteacher but her father thought the only job viable for her was domestic work. Despite her parents’ sentiments, she went on to become the first black schoolteacher in the Brooklyn School system.  Personal life  On November 5, 1902, she married Richard Stedman Fleming, who was also groundbreaking in his own right as the first African-American dentist in Connecticut. They had two children, Dorothy and Harold, born in 1903 and 1906 respectively.  Civic work  Sarah Fleming had many accomplishments in her life. In her civic work, she organized the New Haven's Women’s Civic League (1929) and founded the Phillis Wheatley Home for Girls (1936), where she promoted and developed a small shelter for young black women who came to New Haven in search for work. She was cited before Congress in 1955 for her many community contributions, and that same year she also received the Sojourner Truth Scroll, an annual award sponsored by the National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women’s Club. She was also an associate of Mary McLeod Bethune who was a prominent influence in education. She was devoted to furthering the advancement of colored girls and women.  Artistic work  Sarah Fleming has been most recognized for her civic work rather than her art. The songs, skits, and musicals that she wrote have not been published. Her two known works of literature are Hope’s Highway and Clouds and Sunshine. Hope’s Highway is an antislavery novel that calls for integration and educational advancement. It suggests that educated African Americans must lead the race. Fleming addresses issues of religion, class, race, and gender. Clouds and Sunshine is a collection of poetry that sheds light on Fleming’s political views. The book is divided into three parts containing different types of poems: general poems, dialect poems, and race poems. Her writings demonstrate her determination and optimism of uplifting the African-American race.  Death  She died five days before her 87th birthday. References *Shockley, Ann Allen.

The horizontal line represents the Equator, which is misplaced too far north due to its being calculated from the Tropic of Cancer using the Ptolemaic degree, which is only five-sixths of a true degree. The Golden Chersonese or Golden Khersonese (, Chrysḗ Chersónēsos; ), meaning the Golden Peninsula, was the name used for the Malay Peninsula by Greek and Roman geographers in classical antiquity, most famously in Claudius Ptolemy's 2nd- century Geography. Name The earliest references to a fabulous land of gold that could be interpreted as places in South East Asia may be found in Indian literature. In Ramayana, there are mentions of Suvarnabhumi (Land of Gold) and Suvarnadvipa (the Golden Island or Peninsula, where dvipa might refer to either a peninsula or an island) Greek knowledge of lands further to their east improved after the conquests of Alexander the Great, but specific references to places in South East Asia did not appear until after the rise of the Roman Empire. Greek and Roman geographers Eratosthenes, Dionysius Periegetes, and Pomponius Mela had written about a Golden Isle (Khrysē, Chryse Insula), which some in modern times argued to mean Sumatra while excluding the Malay Peninsula.H. Kern, \\"Java en het Goudeiland Volgens de Oudste Berichten\\", Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indië, Volume 16, 1869, pp.638-648.Udai Prakash Arora, “Greek Geographers on the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia”, in Chattopadhyaya, D. P. and Project of History of Indian Science, Philosophy, and Culture (eds.), History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization, New Delhi, Oxford University Press, 1999, Vol.1, Pt.3, C.G. Pande (ed.), India's Interaction with Southeast Asia, Chapter 6, pp.184-185. Pliny in Natural History, however, referred to Chryse as both a promontory and an island. Ptolemy's Geography, based on the work by Marinus of Tyre, contains the best-known and perhaps the earliest reference to the Golden Chersonese. However, Geography includes information added by later geographers, and the first specific mention of the Golden Chersonese may be in the work of Marcian of Heraclea. Chersonese means peninsula in Greek, and although a few early scholars had attempted to link the Golden Chersonese with Lower Burma, the term is now generally accepted to mean the Malay Peninsula. The Malay Peninsula is thought to have been a producer of gold in ancient times, and gold mines in Patani and Pahang were still mentioned in the 17th century by the Malay-Portuguese writer Godinho de Erédia. Although gold is now not a major product of modern-day Malaysia, it is still being mined, for example in Raub in Pahang. Cartographic references Urb. Gr. 82, done according to Ptolemy's 1st projection . The Indian Ocean is depicted as a closed basin. The Golden Chersonese is the peninsula to the far east, just prior to the Great Gulf. Aurea Cersonese, the Golden Peninsula, near Java in the Indian Ocean, on the map of Andreas Walsperger, c.1448 Martin of Bohemia's Erdapfel The Golden Chersonese appears in the map of Ptolemy, which gives some geographical locations on the peninsula. The earliest surviving maps of Ptolemy however came from the end of the 13th century. Note that Ptolemy, like many early geographers, believed the Indian Ocean to be a closed sea, and maps based on Ptolemy's work show Golden Chersonese to be located within a closed basin. To the east of the Golden Peninsula is the Great Gulf, which is enclosed further east by the border of terra incognita (unknown lands). Arab geographers were aware that the idea of the Indian Ocean as a closed basin was mistaken by the 8th century, for example in the work of al-Khwārizmī, Book of the Description of the Earth. They showed that the Indian Ocean might be linked to the World Oceans, with the eastern limit of the inhabited world beyond the Malay Peninsula being the Island of the Jewel in the Sea of Darkness. The Ptolemaic eastern shore became the Dragon's Tail peninsula. The Golden Chersonese is shown on the mappa mundi of Andreas Walsperger made in Constance around 1448. It bears the inscription, hic rex caspar habitavit (here lived King Caspar). Caspar was one of the Three Magi who worshipped the newborn Christ at Bethlehem. Martin of Bohemia, on his 1492 geographical globe, located the islands of Chryse and Argyre (\\"Gold\\" and \\"Silver\\") in the vicinity of Zipangu (Japan), which was said to be \\"rich in gold\\" by Marco Polo. An expedition was sent to find the purported islands in this location under the command of Pedro de Unamuno in 1587.The Travels of Pedro Teixeira, tr. and annotated by W.F. Sinclair, London, Hakluyt Society, Series 2, Vol.9, 1902, p.10.E.W.

No.1, 1916-1917, pp.1-222, pp.47-48, 66. Geographical locations The names of various geographical features and settlements of the Golden Chersonese are given in Ptolemy's Geography, including towns and rivers. Different identities however have suggested by different scholars for these names. Although coordinates are given for many of these places, they are not considered reliable for places so far away from the Mediterranean as they may not be based on astronomical observation, and therefore cannot be reliably used for identification. Ptolemy's work was also copied and translated over many hundreds of years, with the oldest surviving version copied over a thousand years after it was written, and errors may have been introduced. Rivers The Ptolemy map shows three rivers which are joined together to form as their source a single river which does not actually exist. It has however been suggested that this might be an indication of the existence of an ancient transpeninsular route that linked Perak and Pahang, a short cut between the east and west coasts of the Malay Peninsula. *Khrysoanas river, meaning \\"River of Gold\\", proposed to be various rivers on the west coast, from the Trang River (in southern Thailand) or Lungu River, to the Perak River or the Bernam River, or further south the Muar River. *Palandas river, proposed to be Johor River by a number of scholars. *Attabas river, which most authors agreed to be the Pahang River. Settlements * Takola – a trading emporion, located at Trang in southern Thailand according to most authors. Takua Pa is another suggestion. Takola was known to the Indians in ancient times; a place named Takkola is mentioned in the 2nd or 3rd century Indian texts Maha Niddesa and Milinda Panha, and it is also considered to be the same as the Talaittakkōlam mentioned in the 1030 Tanjore inscription as one of the places conquered by Rajendra Chola in his invasion of Srivijaya. These Indian sources indicate the existence of Takola from the 3rd to 11th century. *Konkonagara – a place near the Khrysoanas, with many scholars placing it in Perak (e.g. at Kuala Kangsar, in the Kinta District, or along the Bernam river), but some placed it further north on the Muda River in Kedah, or in Krabi opposite Phuket in Thailand. It is thought to be an Indian name, but it has also been proposed to be a hybrid of Malay and Sanskrit – kolong-kolong (or kekolong) and negara, meaning \\"the country of mines\\". Some writers have suggested link with Gangga Negara. *Sabara or Sabana – the second emporion, variously proposed to be in Selangor or near Klang, or just south of Malacca, or south Johor, as well as Singapore. * Tharra – at least 10 different sets of coordinates have been given in different texts for this site, it is therefore difficult to pinpoint and there is no agreement in its identification. *Palanda – suggested to be Kota Tinggi by a few authors. *Kalonka – various sites ranging from Chumphon Province in southern Thailand to the Pahang River basin have been proposed. * Kole polis – thought to be located on the north east coast of the Malay Peninsula, and suggested to be in Kelantan, or somewhere between Kemaman River and Kuantan. * Perimula - placed on the north east coast of the Malay Peninsula, suggestions include Ligor, the deltas of Kelantan or Trengganu River, and Redang Island. Other features * Cape Maleou-kolon – the name appears to refer to a \\"Malay Point\\", perhaps the south east corner of the Malay Peninsula. * The Perimulikos gulf – possibly the Gulf of Siam, although alternative proposals ranging from the Bay of Patani to the lake of Tale Sap in Songkhla have been suggested.

A History of Malaysia and Singapore. London: Oxford University Press. pp. 4 & 5\\\\. The Proto-Malays are the ancestors of the Malays in the modern Malaysia and Indonesia. The Proto- Malays are believed to be seafarers knowledgeable in oceanography and possessing advanced fishing as well as basic agricultural skills. Over the years, they settled in various places and adopted various customs and religions as a result of acculturation and inter-marriage with most of the people they come in contact with Orang Asli tribes such as the Semang and Senoi peoples. Origin The Encyclopedia of Malaysia: Early History has pointed out three theories of the origin of the Proto-Malay: * The Yunnan theory, Mekong river migration (first published in 1889). The theory of Proto- Malay originating from Yunnan is supported by R.H Geldern, J.H.C Kern, J.R Foster, J.R Logen, Slametmuljana and Asmah Haji Omar. Other evidence that supports this theory includes: stone tools found at Malay Archipelago which are analogous to Central Asian tools; similarity of Malay customs and Assam customs; and the fact that the Malay and Cambodian languages are kindred languages because the ancestral home of Cambodians originated at the source of Mekong River. * The seafarers theory (first published in 1965). * The Taiwan theory (first published in 1997). For more information, see Austronesian languages. Some historical linguists have concluded that there is scant linguistic basis for a Proto-/Deutero-Malay split. The findings suggests that the Proto-Malay and the Deutero-Malay peoples possibly belong to the same stock and origin. Previous theories suggested that the Deutero-Malays came in a second wave of migration, around 300 BCE, compared to the arrival of the Proto-Malays who came much earlier. Geographical regions Indonesia Ernest-Théodore Hamy (1896) first identified 3 Proto-Malay groups that are found in Sumatra and Borneo, Indonesia: * Batak people * Dayak people * Nias people Both Koentjaraningrat and Alfred Russel Wallace's (1869) research also concluded that most of the Moluccans come under the Proto-Malay classification. However, António Mendes Correia's findings re-classified the Timorese in Alfred Russel Wallace's ethnological chart as predominantly Proto- Malay. This is evidenced by the striking similarity in the architectural designs of traditional houses in Lospalos, East Timor with the Batak and Toraja people. In Sulawesi, not only are the Toraja people are regarded as part of the ancient Proto-Malay, but their neighboring Minahasan people as well who have migrated to the island in the megalithic period. In Sumatra, a little known pygmy tribe called the Mante people of Aceh are regarded as Proto-Malay and have thought to be extinct. Other ethnic groups that are closely related to the Proto-Malay are such as the Nage people from Flores, which are considered a mixture of Proto-Malay and Melanesian and the Sakai people from Riau, which were originally pure Proto-Malay until later they were forced into the interior by the Deutero-Malays which led to their mixing with the Negritos. Off the west coast of Bengkulu, Sumatra Island, the indigenous people of Enggano Island known as the Enggano people are considered largely Proto-Malays.  Malaysia  In Malaysia, the Proto-Malay are classified under the native Orang Asli group of people in the Peninsular Malaysia. They are officially known as: * Jakun people * Orang Kanaq * Orang Kuala * Orang Seletar * Semelai people * Temoq people * Temuan people Other ethnic groups outside of the Peninsular Malaysia that are also regarded as Proto-Malay apart from the Orang Asli people group are such as the Rungus people. The Philippines A comparison of height with an American (left), a mixed blood of Native Indonesians and Proto-Malay (middle) and a pure Negrito (right) from Northern Luzon, 1869. In the Philippines, there are several people groups that have been identified as part of the Proto-Malay group: * Mangyan people * Mangguangan people While there are other ethnic groups in the Philippines, that are in some ways related or shares a mixture of Proto-Malay, namely: * Teduray people, mainly a mixture of Proto-Malay and Native Indonesians * Apayao people, a mixture of Proto-Malay and Negrito * Zambale people, mainly Negrito with a mixture of Proto-Malay and Australoid * Albay Bikol people, mainly Proto-Malay with some mixture of Negrito * Batak people (Philippines), a mixture of Proto-Malay and Native Indonesians * Bataan people, mainly Negrito with a mixture of Proto-Malay and Australoid * Bagobo people, a mixture of Proto-Malay and Native Indonesians * Blaan people, a mixture of Proto-Malay and Native Indonesians * Manobo people, a mixture of Proto-Malay and Native Indonesians * Subanon people, mainly Proto-Malay with a mixture of either Malay people (coastal) or Native Indonesians (interior) * Ifugao people, a mixture of Proto-Malay and Malay people * Tinggian people, a mixture of Native Indonesians and Malay people * Bontoc people, mainly Malay people See also * Prehistoric Malaysia * Melayu Kingdom, a Melayu Kuno kingdom References Category:Prehistoric Asia Category:Anthropology Category:Malayan languages ","title":"Proto-Malay"},{"id":"5817768","text":"William Joseph Gabriel Doyle, MC (3 March 1873 – 16 August 1917), better known as Willie Doyle, was an Irish Roman Catholic priest who was killed in action while serving as a military chaplain to the Royal Dublin Fusiliers during the First World War.

He was also posthumously recommended for both the Victoria Cross and the Distinguished Service Order, but was awarded neither. According to Patrick Kenny, anti-Catholicism may have played a role in the British Army's decision not to grant Father Doyle both awards.

Services of worship are held every Sunday at 10am, apart from months with 5 Sundays in which the congregation meets with Bervie Parish Church, with which it has been united for a number of years, on the 5th Sunday. The church building, dedicated to Saint Ternan dates back to the 13th Century and is one of the few pre-reformation churches still in weekly use. The graveyard around the church has a few burials within it every year. The manse for the parish is in nearby town Inverbervie and the minister is the Rev Andrew Morrison. The former manse, located only a few metres from the church, is now owned by the Arbuthnott family. The Filling Station The Filling Station is a non-denomination Christian gathering that meets monthly on the last Monday of the month in the Grassic Gibbon Centre. It is a cross-church venture, involving people from many different church backgrounds with the aim of bringing the Christian message to those who don't do church. Each meeting involves refreshments, some worship music, and a Christian speaker.  Local radio  Alongside the commercial enterprise of the local newspaper, The Mearns Leader, Arbuthnott has a Local Community Radio Station in Mearns FM. Broadcasting from nearby Stonehaven in the Townhall, Mearns FM helps to keep Arbuthnott up to date with local and charity events, as well as playing a wee bit of music.

It is composed of starch combined with several other biodegradable materials. The starch is modified in order to obtain heat-resistant properties, making PSM one of few bioplastics capable of withstanding high temperatures. PSM began to be commercially available in 2005. PSM is stable in the atmosphere, but biodegradable in compost, wet soil, fresh water, seawater, and activated sludge where microorganisms exist. It has a softening temperature of 257°F (125°C) and a melting temperature of 313°F (156°C). It is also hygroscopic. The material has to be dried in a material dryer at 150°F (66°C) for five hours or 180°F (82°C) for three hours. For injection molding and extrusion the barrel temperatures should be at 340° +/- 10°F (171°C) with the nozzle/die at 360°F (182°C). Due to how similar PSM is to other plastics (such as polypropylene and CPET), PSM can run on many existing thermoforming and injection molding lines. PSM is currently used for a wide variety of applications in the plastic market, such as food packaging and utensils, personal care items, plastic bags, temporary construction tubing, industrial foam packaging, industrial and agricultural film, window insulation, construction stakes, and horticulture planters. Since PSM is derived from a renewable resource (corn starch), it has become an attractive alternative to petrochemical-derived products. Unlike plastic, PSM can also be disposed of through incineration, resulting in non-toxic smoke and a white residue which can be used as fertilizer. However, concerns have been expressed about the impact of such technologies on food prices.  Biodegradability Concerns  Some PSM products - such as cutlery - contain a mix of PSM and plastics. These plastics prevent the PSM from degrading, making the entire product non- biodegradable.

Waller Tazewell Patton (July 15, 1835 - July 21, 1863), was a professor, attorney, and an officer of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Early life and career Waller T. Patton was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia, into a well-known family. He was named for the Governor of Virginia, Littleton Waller Tazewell. His father, John Mercer Patton, a member of the Council of State, served as Acting Governor in March 1841. An ancestor, Hugh Mercer, served as a general during the American Revolution. His brother was Confederate colonel George S. Patton, Sr. Patton graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1855, placing 2nd in a class of 16. While still a student, he became a member of the faculty, serving as acting assistant professor of Latin from 1852 until 1854. Patton also served as lieutenant in the cadet corps and for a time, as assistant professor of languages and assistant.

Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War and Virginia's subsequent secession, Patton enlisted in the Confederate Army in the spring of 1861 and was elected to serve as a major in the 7th Virginia Infantry. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on April 27, 1862. Patton took command of the regiment in June 1862 following the promotion of the previous colonel, James L. Kemper, to the command of the brigade. He was badly wounded at Second Manassas on August 30, 1862, and spent the remainder of the year back home in Fredericksburg recuperating. Patton was elected to the Virginia Senate in 1863, but chose instead to return to his regiment. His regiment served in North Carolina in the spring of 1863, then Patton led it northward during the Gettysburg Campaign into Pennsylvania. On July 3, the 7th Virginia was in Pickett's Division, and as part of Kemper's Brigade, formed the right of the Confederate line during Pickett's Charge. Colonel Patton was mortally wounded while leading his men towards the Union positions on Cemetery Ridge. Part of his jaw had been ripped away by an artillery shell fragment. He died in a makeshift hospital at Pennsylvania College several weeks later. His first cousin, Lewis B. Williams, Jr, commanded another Virginia regiment in Pickett's Division and was also mortally wounded. An older brother, George Smith Patton, was killed at the Third Battle of Winchester during the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Both George and Waller Patton are buried in the Stonewall Cemetery, a part of Mt. Hebron Cemetery, Winchester, Virginia. Four other brothers were officers in the Confederate States Army: Col. John Mercer Patton, Col. Isaac Patton, Lt. James F. Patton, and Lt. Hugh Mercer Patton. Waller Patton was a great-uncle of American World War II General, George S. Patton. Memorialization The Waller Tazewell Patton Camp #1661, Sons of Confederate Veterans, was named in his honor. Media mogul Ted Turner made a cameo appearance in the 1993 film Gettysburg, playing Patton. He later reprised the role in the 2003 prequel Gods and Generals.

After the death of the khan in 1792, begs headed by Qasim beg Selimkhanov (according to other sources, his surname was Mansurov) declared him as their new khan.  Early reign  His reign mostly contested by his cousin, former khan Mirza Muhammad II. Soon after his ascension, he defeated Mirza Muhammad who fled to Quba. He also sent Manaf beg Selimkhanov to Count Gudovich, to present his application for Russian citizenship in 1792. However he was detained in Derbent by Shaykhali Khan's men, who regarded himself as overlord of Baku until 1795. Shaykhali khan marched on Baku in 1794, however upon hearing the news from Shaki Khanate that Salim khan – new khan of Shaki – massacred all children of former khan, including Shaykhali's nephew, marched on Shaki, leaving Mirza Muhammad II near Balakhana with a thousand men. Being not far from Baku, Mirza Muhammad blocked all trade and support routes to city, causing Huseyngulu to send Manaf beg to Gudovich again complaining of Shaykhali khan while he himself suddenly ambushing Mirza Muhammad and capturing him with his family. His younger brother Husein agha was the only one to escape battle, go to Quba and tell the story. Gudovich on the other hand, advised Shaykhali to settle matters peacefully. Indeed, through Mostafa khan's help, cousins made peace and Mirza Muhammad went back to Quba, while retaining his income from Baku oil fields. According to treaty signed in December 1795:  Capture of Baku  After Agha Muhammad Shah's invasion of Georgia, Shaykhali khan rushed to submit to Qajar rule. This did not go without retribution from Russia as Catherine II ordered Valerian Zubov to invade Shirvan. Zubov stormed Derbent on 10 May and captured Shaykhali, moving on to Baku. However Huseyngulu sent envoys to Zubov on 20 May, explaining his will to submit.Ashurbeyli, p. 294 Khan himself arrived at Russian encampment near Gilgilçay on 13 June with city keys. General Vasili Rakhmanov was sent to occupy Baku with 3 battalions of infantry, 2 cavalry squadrons and 3 artillery guns. Tsitsianov was named commanding officer of castle in 1797. However, death of Catherine II and Paul's cancellation of expedition, forced Zubov to withdraw to Russia in 1797.  Later reign  Now being left at mercy of Agha Muhammad, Huseyngulu was captured and imprisoned in Shusha on 11 May. However shah was assassinated next day, Huseyngulu left for Baku. Hearing developments, Mirza Muhammad rushed to seize Baku. Huseyngulu khan's fast arrival ruined his plans. After new treaty, he positioned himself in Mashtaga, acting as a vice-khan. However, he later sent gifts to Fatali shah, fearing another invasion. Russian consul in Qajar Iran - Skibinevski arrived in Baku on 22 January 1800 and demanded compensation for Russian merchants from whom large sums of money was taken after Russian withdrawal. Khan declined, but pleaded guilty when a Russian ship \\"Kizlyar\\" fired a cannon on city on 6 February. He sent envoys to congratulate Alexander I on his ascension on 1 March 1801. He invaded Mashtaga, this time with Mostafa khan's help in 1803. Exiling Mirza Muhammad II to Quba.  Occupation of Baku  Baku was again matter of interest to Russians in the course of Russo-Persian War of 1804–13. As a result of Tsitsianov's negotiations in early 1803, an agreement was reached with the ambassador of the Baku khan – Allahverdi beg on conceding Baku to Russia. On 24 April 1803, Tsitsianov asked Vorontsov to dispatch two regiments (from Taman and the Crimea) at his disposal for the garrison in Baku and the occupation of other points lying about. However, in 1804, at the insistence of the Baku and Shemakhan nobility, the agreement with Russia was cancelled by Huseyngulu.Ashurbeyli, p. 300 Soon tensions rose in Baku, as city folk killed 7 of the Russian consul's soldiers, expelling him out of the city. In 1805, a Russian squadron entered the Baku bay under the command of General Irinarch Zavalishin and proceeded to siege the city. Khan sent an envoy to Zavalishin to negotiate, however, he responded that he had been sent by the emperor to occupy Baku and demanded the immediate surrender of the city. Khan asked for a time to give an answer. On 15 April, when the deadline passed and the city did not surrender, Zavalishin landed ashore. However, with reinforcements from Shaykhali khan and Nuh beg of Derbent, khan prevailed in defence of the city. Having suffered defeat after several battles, the Russians boarded the ships and retreated to the island of Sari (near Lankaran).Ashurbeyli, p. 301 On 27 December 1805, Tsitsianov informed Alexander I that he himself was going with the army to Baku, to help Zavalishin. At the beginning of February 1806, Tsitsianov, marching with a large army, joined forces with General Zavalishin 2 versts from Baku and began negotiations with khan about the surrender of the fortress to the Russians. Russian troops encamped near Nakhirbulag, just next to city walls. On 8 February, khan, accompanied by his retinue, left the fortress to present city keys to Prince Tsitsianov. In a surprise to many, khan's cousin Ibrahim beg suddenly gunned Tsitsianov and killed him. Huseyngulu went to Ağsu in person to submit Abbas Mirza. Meanwhile, Mirza Muhammad Khan II joined army of Russian general Sergei Bulgakov in July 1806 to guide Russian army to Baku. Together they captured Baku on 6 October 1806, while Huseyngulu fled to Ardabil with his family. Huseyngulu appeared again in 1826, this time with Qajar army to recapture Baku, but failed to do so. He died in Ardabil, 1845 and was buried in Karbala.  Family  He had 8 wives, 5 sons and 17 daughters.

They are generally introduced to the environment through careless industrial practices. Overview VOCs are responsible for a number of adverse health effects especially for nursing and pregnant mothers. Many of these compounds were not known to be harmful until the late 1960s and it was some time before regular testing of groundwater identified these substances in drinking water sources. Specific VOCs PCE Tetrachloroethylene is used in metal degreasing and dry cleaning. It is suspected to cause cancer, and a host of other health problems. TCE Trichloroethylene is used in cleaning metal parts and was widely believed to be harmless before being linked to birth defects. It is suspected to cause cancer, and a host of other health problems. Toluene Toluene is an organic compound which is mostly harmless to adults and is sometimes abused as an inhalant. Fetal toluene syndrome has been defined and resembles fetal alcohol syndrome with resultant birth defects, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have identified differentiating features between the two syndromes including FTS having the additional facial features of micrognathia, large anterior fontanel, down-turned mouth corners, hair patterning abnormalities, bifrontal narrowing of the face, and ear abnormalities.CDC.

In 1982, the Marine Corps discovered volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in several drinking water wells that fed into two of the eight water systems. The sources were traced to Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) from a two dry cleaners - one on base, the other off the base and Trichloroethylene which had been used in vehicle maintenance on the base. These problems were addressed but there were concerns with nursing and pregnant mothers who may have been exposed previously. It wasn't until the late 1990s that the federal government tried to track down people who may have been exposed. Love Canal Love Canal was an abandoned canal near Niagara Falls, New York which was used by the U.S. military and Occidental Petroleum as a chemical waste dumping ground. Numerous cases of cancer and birth defects were found from the 1950s to the 1970s. The primary VOC at Love Canal is toluene, which is found along with dioxins and other pollutants.

A crab boil is also a social event where boiled crabs are eaten, a kind of seafood boil. Crab boils are known in the Ville Platte areas of Louisiana as \\"dome lobster boils,\\" stemming from the local term \\"dome lobster\\" based on the shape and composition of crabs and their likeness to a domed lobster. The largest of these gatherings is the Crayon d'Orange festival (French for 'Orange Pencil') in Evangeline Parish. Louisiana and New Orleans Boiled seafood in southern Louisiana tends to be spicier than that found in other parts of the country. Homemade crab boil recipes call for abundant amounts of hot sauce, cayenne pepper, salt, bay leaf, lemon, and garlic. Mustard seeds, coriander seeds, and allspice are popular extra options. Many people will start with a commercial crab boil product and then supplement it with extra pepper. The leading commercial product is Zatarain's which comes in two forms. One is a mesh bag with seasonings inside that will steep into the water. The second is a liquid concentrate that can be added directly to the water. The concentrate form can also be used as a flavor enhancer for soups. Other regional crab boil companies are Tony Chachere's, and Rex Crab Boil. Note that even when boiling shrimp or crawfish, most recipes call for adding crab boil packets as a seasoning. Maryland Maryland crabs are prepared by seasoning generously with Chesapeake Bay crab seasoning such as Old Bay and then steaming over, not in, vinegared water (often, beer is added to the steaming water). Carolinas The Lowcountry boil, Tidewater boil, and Frogmore Stew are variations on the same theme in North and South Carolina. Here, recipes may go in either a Louisiana or Maryland direction.

It was created in 1963 in Switzerland at Lucerne by a decision of the European Civil Aviation Conference as a European forum focusing on electronic equipment for air transport. It EUROCAE has now been operating for more than 50 years as a non-profit organisation whose membership comprises aviation stakeholders made up of regulators, manufacturers, services providers, users (such as airlines and airports) and academia. The membership is not limited to the European region. From the outset, EUROCAE has developed performance specifications and other documents exclusively dedicated to the aviation community. EUROCAE documents are widely referenced by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) as Guidance Material and by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) as means of compliance to European Technical Standard Orders (ETSOs) and other regulatory documents. To achieve the desired global harmonisation of aviation standards, EUROCAE has a close cooperation with RTCA, Inc. and SAE International. About 50% of the EUROCAE Working Groups (WG) work jointly with RTCA, and another 10% with SAE. The joint development of standards and the subsequent reference of those standards by EASA and the FAA as Acceptable Means of Compliance allows for a globally harmonised implementation of specific applications or systems based on the state of the art technology. This includes aircraft but also satellites. EUROCAE documents are also produced in the context of the applicable ICAO standards and are coherent with existing ARINC specifications to ensure global interoperability. EUROCAE documents (ED) are developed by the Working Groups (WG) composed of voluntary experts from the member organisations of EUROCAE and – in case of joint activities - RTCA and SAE. Before publication EDs undergo a rigorous internal and external scrutiny process (Open Consultation) to ensure the high quality of the approved standards. Since its creation EUROCAE has published more than 250 EDs. The EUROCAE governance is led by the Council composed of senior staff from Full Members of the Association who are elected by the annual General Assembly. A Technical Advisory Committee consisting of technical experts in various aviation domains advices the Council in technical decisions. The day-to-day work of the organisation is carried out by the EUROCAE Secretariat, a collective term for the Secretary General, Programme Managers and administrative staff.

It is located in the northern area of the Lower Peninsula within the eight counties of Alpena, Antrim, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Emmet, Montmorency, Otsego, and Presque Isle. The forest is served by Interstate 75, U.S. Highway 23 (US 23), and US 131. Description Most of the Mackinaw State Forest was logged for red pine and white pine during the golden age of Michigan old-growth lumbering, which ended about 1910. Much of the cut-over land was seen as worthless and was allowed to revert to the state of Michigan in lieu of unpaid property taxes. Second-growth trees found within the Mackinaw State Forest include the alder, aspen, paper birch, yellow birch, hophornbeam, sugar maple, balsam poplar, willow, balsam fir, hemlock, larch, jack pine, black spruce, white spruce, and northern whitecedar. The forest is managed today for second- growth logging, recreation, and tourism purposes. Starting in 1918, the state stocked part of the forest with a herd of free-range elk (Cervus canadensis). Today numbering about 850, the elk live in and around the Black River area where Cheboygan, Montmorency and Otsego counties come together. The Mackinaw State Forest is home to a rich diversity of animal species, including the Northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), American black bear (Ursus americanus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), American marten (Martes americana), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus). The Mackinaw State Forest is home to Michigan's two most critically endangered species: the Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii) and Hungerford's crawling water beetle (Brychius hungerfordi). Indeed, of the five known locations in which Hungerford's crawling water beetles have been found, two are within the Mackinaw State Forest, one along the East Branch of the Black River and the other in Van Hetton Creek. The Van Hetton Creek identifications are significant as they represented a new location beyond those originally identified when the Hungerford's crawling water beetle was categorized as endangered in 1994. This suggests that the rare beetle may occur in other sites as yet undiscovered elsewhere in Mackinaw State Forest. Fifty miles (80 km) of the North Country Trail run within the Mackinaw State Forest. Deadman's Hill Scenic Overlook Deadman's Hill is a scenic overlook and trailhead near Elmira, Michigan in Antrim County within the Mackinaw State Forest; the overlook enjoys a panoramic view over the headwaters of the Jordan River, and the trailhead serves an parcel of state forestland that surrounds the same river headwaters. The overlook is located at 45.04578 N., -84.93850 W., and is accessible by all-weather gravel road from U.S. 131. The hill and overlook are named in memory of Samuel Graczyk (also known as 'Stanley' Graczyk), who perished here in a \\"Big wheel\\" accident on May 20, 1910. The relatively steep slopes of the upper Jordan River made this a dangerous area to cut down trees or transport logs. Graczyk planned to marry his fiancée on the evening of the day of the fatal accident, and local legend asserts that the bridegroom's ghost haunts the overlook, especially at sunset. A large proportion of the trees in the upper Jordan River valley are sugar maples, and the overlook is a noted autumn foliage viewing spot.

Starting out as a progressive rock band, they later experimented with many other styles including jazz, funk, and pop. During their heyday they were one of Hungary's most popular rock bands. The band broke up in 2016 after the death of longtime singer/bassist Tamás Somló. History  Early years  The band was formed in April 1971 by members of previously successful Hungarian rock bands. A poll in Hungarian Youth magazine listing the nation's favorite rock musicians inspired several of the winners to form a new band together. Singer/keyboardist Gábor Presser and drummer József Laux had been members of Omega, singer/bassist Károly Frenreisz had been a member of Metró, and singer/guitarist Tamás Barta had been in Hungária. They played their first concert in Budapest in July 1971. Much of their early activity was as a backing band for pop singers, due to Hungary's restrictions on employment for rock musicians; they gained notice in particular for backing Sarolta Zalatnay and Kati Kovács during their first few years of existence. Their self-titled debut album was released in December 1971, and their second album Ringasd el magad was released the following year. They received coverage in New Musical Express, which called them “The new rock sensation [that] could come from the East!”; traveled to Japan to play at the World Popular Song Festival; and were invited to perform at the Great Western Express Festival in England. In 1973 the band wrote the music for the politicized theater production An Imaginary Report on an American Pop Festival. This endeavor frustrated Frenreisz who left to form his own band Skorpió; he was replaced by Tamás Somló, another former member of Omega. The band's third album Bummm! was released in 1973. Tamás Barta left the band and defected to the United States, which then caused the Hungarian government to ban Bummm! for the next ten years in retaliation. (Barta was murdered in the United States under mysterious circumstances in 1982.) Barta was replaced by János Karácsony. The band's first three albums were compiled in 1974 for an American/British release titled Locomotiv GT (not to be confused with their first Hungarian release), which included some new material produced by Jimmy Miller and a guest appearance by Jack Bruce on harmonica. Their first album with Karácsony, Mindig magasabbra, was released in Hungary in 1975. During this period, the Hungarian government suppressed much of the band's work, followed by the governments of neighboring countries like Romania and Czechoslovakia, because the band's rock music was considered subversive; most of their sales and acclaim were gained in English-speaking countries. The English-language songs recorded with Jimmy Miller for the 1974 international compilation were not released in Hungary until 1988. Their 1976 release, the double album Locomotiv GT V., was also banned in Hungary. József Laux then left the band, also to defect to the United States. After the band received help from two temporary drummers, Laux was replaced by János Solti.  Later years  Tamás Somló in 2009The lineup of Presser, Somló, Karácsony, and Solti remained intact for forty years until the group disbanded. The band released the albums Zene – Mindenki másképp csinálja in 1976, Mindenki in 1978, and Loksi in 1980. The latter album was the first for which they were paid royalties for retail sales. They toured the Soviet Union in 1980 and were offered an international contract by EMI the following year, with an invitation to record at Abbey Road Studios in England. The EMI albums Locomotiv GT X. (1982) and Ellenfél nélkül (1984) were unsuccessful and the band gave up their international touring ambitions to focus on the Hungarian market. The band ceased regular activity in 1986 but re-emerged in 1992 for a major concert in Budapest celebrating the downfall of Communism. They released the reunion album 424 – Mozdonyopera in 1997.

Thorpe is identified by his initials, T.T. Thomas Thorpe (c. 1569c. 1625) was an English publisher, most famous for publishing Shakespeare's sonnets and several works by Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson. His publication of the sonnets has long been controversial. Nineteenth-century critics thought that he might have published the poems without Shakespeare's consent; Sidney Lee called him \\"predatory and irresponsible.\\" Conversely, modern scholars Wells and Taylor assert their verdict that \\"Thorpe was a reputable publisher, and there is nothing intrinsically irregular about his publication.\\"Wells and Taylor, p. 444. Life The son of an innkeeper in Barnet, Middlesex, Thorpe worked as an apprentice to Richard Watkins for nine years in a small shop. In 1594 Thorpe obtained his publishing rights, but was still without his printing rights. His first book published was The First Book of Lucan, Marlowe's translation of the Pharsalia, the copyright of which he received from Edward Blount, who would come to be a close friend of Thorpe's. He then returned the favour by dedicating the volume to Blount, which was quite unorthodox for the time: publications were generally dedicated to noblemen, local celebrities, aristocracy, royalty, and other men of distinction. In 1605 Thorpe's publishing career took off, as he published George Chapman's All Fools and Ben Jonson's Sejanus His Fall, the latter of which was also provided by Blount. It has even been speculated that Jonson himself may have even been involved in the printing, with critic Jonas Barish noting \\"The exactness of the marginal annotations, the closeness with which the typography conveyed Jonson's metrical intentions, and the corrections made in proof all suggest that Jonson oversaw the printing himself.\\" Thorpe was a mysterious anomaly among the stationers of his generation: there is no evidence that he ever maintained either a print shop or a bookshopand without such a facility it is hard to comprehend how he stayed in business. Yet he managed: he commissioned printers to do his printing and arranged for booksellers to sell his books. For one example, his 1609 edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets (see below) was printed by George Eld, and sold by William Aspley and William Wright. Thorpe had a cryptic relationship with Aspley; together the two men entered plays into the Stationers' Register – The Malcontent on 5 July 1604, and Eastward Ho on 4 September 1605 – yet when the plays were published soon after, they were issued by Aspley alone.Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 254, 431. Thorpe remained in business until at least 1624, when he and Blount transferred the copyright of Marlowe's Hero and Leander to fellow stationer Simon Vicars.Halliday, p. 494. Thomas Thorpe stopped publishing in 1625, the probable year of his death. Dorcas Thorpe of St. Olave Southwark was granted administration of the estate of her late husband Thomas Thorpe on 30 July. Thorpe also stopped receiving his pension from the Stationers' Company that year, which strengthens the evidence for his death that year.Kathman, David. \\"Thomas Thorpe\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. The Sonnets In 1609, Thorpe published the most important work of his career, Shakespeare's Sonnets. His apparent disregard for Shakespeare's permission earned him a poor reputation, although modern author Katherine Duncan-Jones has argued that he was not such a \\"scoundrel\\" as he was portrayed, and the amiable and admirable Blount would certainly not associate with him if he were a scoundrel. It has even been suggested that Shakespeare did sell his manuscript to Thorpe, because of his acquaintance with Jonson as an actor in Sejanus, who may have recommended Thorpe to him as a good publisher. The dedication, which is addressed to a mysterious Mr. W.H., may have been written either by Shakespeare himself or by Thorpe. Thorpe was probably responsible for the arrangement of the sonnets, with 1–17 being the \\"procreation sonnets\\", 18–126 being love sonnets to the Fair Youth (for the most part), and 127–154 being written on a variety of subjects, including politics, sex, and the Dark Lady. Critics have failed to agree whether or not his arrangement was the most apt, but most detect a logical coherence in the order, which is generally retained today. The possibility that the manuscript was provided to Thomas Thorpe by a needy \\"MR. W. H.,\\" the dedicatee of the volume and the poems’ possible recipient, seems seldom to have been explored.

He led Palmyra's expeditions in the middle east which included annexing territory spanning from Roman Egypt to Asia Minor. Following Emperor Aurelian's campaign in the east and the fall of Palmyra, Zabdas, among other notable Palmyrene officials including Cassius Longinus was executed in Emesa after being held on trial by the emperor. Campaigns Expedition against the Tanukhids Aided by another general of the army, Septimius Zabbai, and Zenobia herself, Zabdas started an expedition against the Tanukhids in the spring of 270, during the reign of emperor Claudius II. Reasons cited for Palmyra's military campaign in Arabia are the weakness of Roman central authority over its eastern provinces and its corresponding inability to protect them, which harmed Palmyra's trade and probably convinced Zenobia that the only way to maintain stability in the East was to control the region directly. The conflict of Palmyra's economic interest with as Bostra and Egypt receiving trade which would have otherwise passed through Palmyra also played a part. Regardless, the defiance of the Tanukhids against Palmyrene domination is probably the main reason which triggered a military response from Zenobia. The attack seemed to be intentionally timed, as the Palmyrene army south to Bostra while the Romans were preoccupied with their battles against the Goths in the mountains of Thrace. The Roman governor of Arabia, a certain Trassus, confronted Palmyra's approaching army while commanding the Legio III Cyrenaica, but was routed and killed in action. As a result, the city of Bostra surrendered, and the Palmyrene army captured and sacked the city, and destroyed the temple of Zeus Hammon, the legion's revered shrine. Invasion of Egypt In October of 270, a Palmyrene army of 70,000 invaded Egypt, led by Zabdas. The invasion of Egypt is sometimes explained by Zenobia's desire to secure an alternative trade route to the Euphrates, which was cut because of the war with Persia, although the Euphrates route was only partially disrupted, and Zenobia's personal ambition and political motivation to establish Palmyrene dominance over the east definitely played a part in her decision to invade Egypt. The Palmyrenes entered Alexandria, and left a garrison of 5,000, although shortly after, Tenagino Probus, Egypt's prefect, who was occupied with naval expeditions against pirates, was alerted of the situation in Egypt and quickly returned there. He recaptured Alexandria, but the Palmyrene army shortly thereafter regained control of the city. Probus retreated to Babylon Fortress. Although Timagenes, a native of Egypt with knowledge of the land who was aiding Zabdas during the invasion, ambushed the Roman rear and captured the fortress. Tenagino Probus ended up committing suicide, and the Palmyrenes consolidated their dominion over Egypt. Campaigns in Asia Minor Afterward, in 271, Zabbai, another Palmyrene general serving Zenobia, started the operations in Asia Minor, and was joined by Zabdas in the spring of that year. The Palmyrenes annexed Galatia and, according to Zosimus, reached Ancyra. Bithynia and the Cyzicus mint remained beyond Zenobia's control, and her attempts to subdue Chalcedon failed. The Asia Minor campaign is poorly documented, but the western part of the region did not become part of the queen's authority. By August 271 Zabdas was back in Palmyra, with the Palmyrene empire at its zenith. Battles against Aurelian In 272, the Emperor Aurelian crossed the Bosphorus and advanced quickly through Anatolia, to reconquer the lost provinces now under Palmyra. Entering Issus and heading to Antioch, Aurelian defeated Zabdas in the Battle of Immae, near Antioch. The Palmyrene armies retreated to Antioch then later Emesa while Aurelian advanced and took the former. The defeat at Emesa forced the Palmyrene armies to evacuate to the capital. The Romans began a siege, and tried to breach the city defenses several times but were repelled, however, the situation worsened, so Zenobia, Vaballathus's mother, left the city and headed east to ask the Sassanians, for help. The Romans whatsoever followed the queen, arrested her near the Euphrates and brought her back to the emperor. Soon after, the Palmyrene citizens asked for peace, and the city fell. Death Zenobia, Vaballathus and her war council, including Zabdas, were taken to Emesa and put on trial. Most of the high ranking Palmyrene officials were executed, which might have included Zabdas, as he is not mentioned in any account of Zenobia's life after the fall of Palmyra.

The name was long obsolete by the 19th century, but known from its poetic use, as in Robert Burns's 1794 poem Ca' the Yowes (\\"Hark the mavis evening sang/Sounding Clouden's woods amang\\"); and in the popular love song \\"Mary of Argyle\\" (c.1850), where lyricist Charles Jefferys wrote, \\"I have heard the mavis singing its love-song to the morn.\\" Mavis had its height of popularity between the 1920s and 1940s. Its usage declined thereafter, and it has been rather unfashionable since the 1960s.

It can also develop in humans. It develops when the neurons known as Purkinje cells, located in the cerebellum of the brain, begin to die off. These cells affect balance and coordination. They have a critical role to play in the brain. The Purkinje layer allows communication between the granular and molecular cortical layers in the cerebellum. Put simply, without Purkinje cells, an animal loses its sense of space and distance, making balance and coordination difficult. People with damage to the cerebellum can experience symptoms like unsteady gait, poor muscle control, and trouble speaking or swallowing.NINDS Cerebellar Degeneration Information Page , National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, accessed May 5, 2016 Abiotrophy means the loss of a vital nutritive factor. The cause of cerebellar abiotrophy is not known, but it is thought to be due to an intrinsic metabolic defect. In most cases, the Purkinje neurons begin to die off shortly after the animal is born and the condition is noticeable when the animal is less than six months old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms is gradual and the animal is much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem. Cerebellar abiotrophy cannot be prevented, other than by selective breeding to avoid the gene, and it cannot be cured. Genetic testing can detect carriers. In addition to dogs and horses, there also have been cases of cerebellar abiotrophy in Siamese and Domestic shorthair cats; in Angus, Polled Hereford, Charolais and Holstein Friesian cattle; Merino and Wiltshire sheep; and Yorkshire pigs. Terminology The condition in Kerry Blue Terriers is sometimes called progressive neuronal abiotrophy.Breed Information: Kerry Health , United States Kerry Blue Terrier Club, accessed November 6, 2011 Other terms used to describe the condition in dogs include cerebellar cortical atrophy and postnatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Cerebellar abiotrophy in horses was originally thought to be a form of cerebellar hypoplasia (CH) and was described as such in older research literature. However, it was discovered that in horses, the die-off of purkinje cells began after the animal was born, rather than occurring in utero. Cerebellar hypoplasia is distinctly different in that it is a condition from a lack of these cells being formed during the development of the cerebellum and is not progressive or degenerative. CH has been found in several species, including: cats, dogs, cows and lambs. There are other diseases that lead to cerebellar degeneration, but the loss of Purkinje cells is a clear way to diagnose cerebellar abiotrophy, and the combination of symptoms is sufficiently unique that cerebellar abiotrophy can easily be distinguished from other conditions, even in a living animal. Clinical Signs Symptoms of cerebellar abiotrophy include ataxia or lack of balance, an awkward wide- legged stance, a head tremor (intention tremor) (in dogs, body tremors also occur), hyperreactivity, lack of menace reflex, stiff or high-stepping gait, coarse or jerky head bob when in motion (or in very young animals, when attempting to nurse), apparent lack of awareness of where the feet are (sometimes standing or trying to walk with a foot knuckled over), poor depth perception, and a general inability to determine space and distance. The symptoms, when taken as a group, are distinctive and not easily mimicked by other illnesses, though certain types of neurological injury and infection need to be ruled out. Verifying the diagnosis in a laboratory setting is possible only by examining the brain post-mortem to determine if there has been a loss of Purkinje cells.Cerebellar Abiotrophy Most affected animals have normal intelligence and mildly affected animals can, in theory, live out a normal lifespan. However, affected animals are quite accident-prone, and for this reason many animals that develop cerebellar abiotrophy, particularly horses, are euthanized for humane reasons. Horses may experience difficulty stepping up and over objects, run into fences, fall easily, and even if allowed to mature to full growth, are generally considered unsafe to ride. Dogs may need lifetime assistance with tasks such as climbing stairs. In horses, the symptoms may worsen from the time of onset for six to 12 months, but if not severe enough to mandate euthanasia, they stabilize over time. In some dog breeds, symptoms appear to progressively worsen, but research is not consistent on this point. There also is some evidence that affected animals partially compensate for the condition by cognitively learning alternative methods for moving or to determine distance, and thus appear to improve because they become less accident-prone. Horses Cerebellar abiotrophy is best known as a condition affecting Arabian horses. It has also been observed in the Curly horse, Miniature horse, the Gotland Pony, one Eriskay Pony, and possibly the Oldenburg. Most foals appear normal at birth, with symptoms noticeable at an average age of four months, though there have been cases where the condition is first seen shortly after birth and other cases where symptoms are first recognized in horses over one year of age. Breeds DNA tested that reveal some carrier lines, but to date no affected animals, include the Welsh pony and the Trakehner. However, other breeds heavily influenced by Arabian breeding, such as the Thoroughbred and the American Saddlebred, do not appear to carry the mutation. In horses, cerebellar abiotrophy is believed to be linked to an autosomal recessive gene. This means it is not sex-linked, and the allele has to be carried and passed on by both parents in order for an affected animal to be born. Horses that only carry one copy of the gene may pass it on to their offspring, but themselves are perfectly healthy—without symptoms of the disease. Because it is recessive, the allele for cerebellar abiotrophy may pass through multiple generations before it is expressed. Cerebellar abiotrophy is sometimes misdiagnosed. Though the symptoms are quite distinguishable from other neurological conditions, it has been confused with Wobbler's syndrome, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, and injury-related problems such as a concussion. A DNA test which identifies markers associated with cerebellar abiotrophy became available in 2008.Larson, Erica. \\"Researcher: Genetic Mutation Likely the Cause of Neurologic Disorder\\" The Horse online edition, January 23 2011, Article # 17589. Accessed February 28, 2011 The test was refined to identify the most likely mutations, and retesting of earlier samples based on an earlier indirect marker test developed by UCD,Johnson, Robert S. \\"Test Allows Arabian Breeders to Scan for Inherited Neurologic Disorder\\" The Horse online edition, September 23 2008, Article # 12746. Accessed September 23, 2008 indicated a 97% accuracy rate for the old test relative to the newer version, with no false negatives.\\"Update on Sample Retesting\\" The causative mutation was identified in 2011. Research on cerebellar abiotrophy and the DNA test was led by the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. Researchers working on this problem include Drs. Cecilia Penedo and Leah Brault. Dr. Ann T. Bowling made significant early contributions to the genetics research on cerebellar abiotrophy. Dogs Cerebellar abiotrophy has been seen in the Australian Kelpie, Gordon Setter, Border Collie, Labrador Retriever, Airedale, English Pointer, Scottish Terrier, Kerry Blue Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, Lagotto Romagnolo, and other dog breeds. Time of onset varies. In a few breeds, such as the Beagle, Rough Collie, and Miniature Poodle, Purkinje cells begin to die off at or shortly before birth, and pups are born with symptoms or develop symptoms by three to four weeks of age. Most breeds prone to the condition, such as the Kerry Blue Terrier, Border Collie, Australian Kelpie, and Labrador Retriever, begin showing symptoms between six and sixteen weeks of age. In a very few breeds, such as the American Staffordshire Terrier, Old English Sheepdog, Brittany Spaniel, and Gordon Setter, symptoms do not appear until adulthood or even middle age. In dogs, cerebellar abiotrophy is also usually an autosomal recessive gene, but in a few breeds, such as the English Pointer, the gene is sex-linked.

It was written by Judson Kinberg, and produced by Wilbur Stark and Michael Carreras (who was uncredited) for Hammer Film Productions. The story concerns a travelling circus, the vampiric artists of which prey on the children of a 19th-century Serbian village. It was filmed at Pinewood Studios.  Plot  One evening near the small Serbian village of Stetl, early in the nineteenth century, schoolmaster Albert Müller witnesses his wife Anna taking a little girl, Jenny Schilt, into the castle of Count Mitterhaus, a reclusive nobleman rumored to be a vampire responsible for the disappearances of other children. The rumours prove true, as Anna, who has become Mitterhaus' willing acolyte and mistress, gives Jenny to him to be drained of her blood. Men from the village, directed by Müller and including Jenny's father Mr. Schilt and the Bürgermeister, invade the castle and attack the Count. After the vampire kills several of them, Müller succeeds in driving a wooden stake through his heart. With his dying breath, Mitterhaus curses the villagers, vowing that their children will die to give him back his life. The angry villagers force Anna to run a gauntlet, but when her husband intervenes, she runs back into the castle where the briefly revived Count tells her to find his cousin Emil at \\"the Circus of Night\\". After laying his body in the crypt, she escapes through a tunnel as the villagers blow the castle with gunpowder and set fire to it. Fifteen years later, Stetl is being ravaged by a plague and blockaded by the authorities of neighboring towns, with men ready to shoot any villager who tries to leave. The citizens fear that the pestilence may be due to the Count's curse, though the new physician Dr. Kersh dismisses vampires as just a myth. A travelling circus, calling itself the Circus of Night, then arrives at the village, directed by a dwarf and an alluring gypsy woman who are equivocal about how they got past the blockade; the villagers, appreciative of the distraction from their troubles, do not much question the matter. No-one in the village suspects that one of the circus artists, Emil, is Count Mitterhaus's cousin and a vampire, as are the twin acrobats Heinrich and Helga. Emil and the gypsy woman go to the remains of the castle, where in the crypt they find the Count's staked body still preserved, and they reiterate his curse that all who killed him and all their children must die. Whilst his son Anton distracts the armed men at the blockade, Dr. Kersh gets past them to appeal for help from the capital. At the Circus of Night, the villagers are amazed and delighted by the entertainment. Despite his wife's concerns over their wayward daughter Rosa's attraction to the handsome Emil, the Bürgermeister takes her to the circus and, at the gypsy woman's invitation, visits its hall of mirrors where he sees in one, called \\"The Mirror of Life\\", a vision of a revived Count Mitterhaus, which causes him to collapse. Frightened by this event, Schilt tries to flee with his family from the blockaded village with the circus dwarf Michael as their guide, only to be abandoned by him in the forest and mauled to death by Emil, whose shapeshifting form is a black panther. Müller's daughter Dora, whom he sent away earlier for her protection, has slipped past the blockade and is returning to the village to reunite with her father and her beloved Anton when she discovers the Schilts' dismembered bodies, arousing suspicions about the animals of the circus. That evening, Jon and Gustav Hauser, two village boys whose father helped instigate the killing of Mitterhaus, are invited by the gypsy woman to enter the hall of mirrors and are magically drawn by Heinrich and Helga to the Count's crypt, where they are killed and drained. After the boys' bodies are found near the castle, their grieving father and the sick Bürgermeister begin to shoot the circus animals. After an encounter with Emil, the Bürgermeister dies of heart failure; his daughter leaves with the vampire, who kills the girl. Dora and Anton are lured by the twins into the hall of mirrors where they try to whisk Dora through the Mirror of Life, but the cross she is wearing saves her. Later, the vampires enter the school house where Dora and Anton have taken refuge. Emil, in panther form, kills the boarding students, diverting Anton, while the gypsy woman (revealed to be Anna Müller and the twins' mother) tears the cross from Dora's neck, enabling Heinrich and Helga to attack her. Dora, however, escapes into the school chapel, where the twins are overwhelmed by a giant crucifix which she topples on them, destroying them. Nevertheless, with the help of the circus strongman, Emil and Anna succeed in having Dora and her guardian, Hauser's wife Gerta, kidnapped and taken to the crypt at Castle Mitterhaus, where they intend to use their blood—just like the blood from their previous child victims—as part of a ritual to restore the Count back to life. Meanwhile, Dr. Kersch returns from the capital with an imperial escort and medicines for the plague. He also brings news of vampire killings in other villages, all of them toured by the Circus of Night. The men attack the circus and set fire to it, killing the strongman when he tries to stop them. As Hauser starts to burn down the hall of mirrors, he sees in the Mirror of Life a vision of Emil and Anna bleeding Gerta over the Count's body. This horrifying sight distracts him long enough to be burned fatally by the fire, but he lives long enough to alert Anton and the other men to Dora's plight. Back in the castle crypt, Anna is killed when she attempts to save Dora from Emil out of sudden remorse. Anton, finding his way through the tunnel into the crypt despite a deadly ambush by Michael the dwarf, attempts to rescue Dora but is halted by Emil. Just then Müller, Dr. Kersh, and a soldier break into the crypt and battle Emil. Emil kills or disables all his attackers, but Müller pierces him with the stake from the Count's chest as he dies from Emil's bite. Revived by the stake's removal, the Count rises from his sarcophagus and advances on Dora and Anton. Anton uses Müller's crossbow as a makeshift cross, repelling the Count long enough for him to jam the vampire's neck between the weapon's bow and stock and then pulling the trigger, decapitating him. As Dr. Kersh leads Dora and Anton from the tomb, he and the villagers set the ruins afire with torches, ending the curse; but Dora and Anton see a bat fly out of the tomb into the night and are left uncertain.

David Prowse, who later played Darth Vader in the first Star Wars trilogy, appears in a silent role as the circus strongman. Robin Sachs played the part of Ethan Rayne in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and as the space conqueror Sarris in the science-fiction comedy Galaxy Quest. Robin Sachs and Lynne Frederick also featured, as lovers Thomas Culpeper and Katherine Howard, in Henry VIII and his Six Wives (1973). In Stanley Kubrick's 1971 film of A Clockwork Orange, Corri had played the wife of writer F. Alexander, being ravaged by Alex and his droogs who left her husband crippled, to be shown later relying on the care of bodybuilder \\"Julius\\", portrayed by Prowse. Production George Baxt says Hammer paid him £1,000 just for the title and that was his only contribution. Production began on August 9, 1971. First-time director Robert Young was unfamiliar with Hammer's tight production schedules, and at one point used up some 500 feet of film stock while trying to get a tiger to sink its teeth into a fake human arm stuffed with pork (it finally bit after beef was substituted). When filming stretched from the scheduled six weeks into seven, the production was shut down and the footage given to editor Peter Musgrave with instructions to make a finished film out of what he had.  Critical reception  Vampire Circus has been well received by modern critics, and currently holds an 80% approval rating on movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. AllMovie called the film \\"one of the studio's more stylish and intelligent projects\\". PopMatters also called it \\"one of the company's last great classics\\", writing, \\"erotic, grotesque, chilling, bloody, suspenseful and loaded with doom and gloom atmosphere, this is the kind of experiment in terror that reinvigorates your love of the scary movie artform\\". Critics at the time of its original release weren't quite as impressed. New York Times film reviewer Howard Thompson dismissed it outright without even the courtesy of a proper review, in favor of its Hammer stablemate Countess Dracula with which it shared a double bill. His curt review measured two sentences: \\"Wise horror fans will skip 'Vampire Circus' and settle for 'Countess Dracula' on the new double bill at the Forum. Both are Hammer Productions, England's scream factory, but the first was dealt a quick, careless anvil.\\" before continuing with semi-praise for Countess Dracula. David Pirie in The Monthly Film Bulletin praised the \\"delicate fairy tale atmosphere\\" established in the early going but lamented that it was \\"only fleetingly sustained\\" as \\"the plot finally succumbs to formula.\\" The Los Angeles Times was fairly positive, calling the film \\"a true chiller\\" with \\"lots of real-looking teeth, believable gore, and—save for a very lurid ending (not for the kiddies)—a lot of pace, a certain sense of subtlety and a definite, consistent style.\\"Milstein, Fredric (December 16, 1972). \\"'Circus' Outgores 'Countess'.

It binds Bone morphogenetic proteins, members of the TGF beta superfamily of ligands, which are involved in paracrine signalling. BMPs are involved in a host of cellular functions including osteogenesis, cell growth and cell differentiation. Signaling in the BMP pathway begins with the binding of a BMP to the type II receptor. This causes the recruitment of a BMP type I receptor, which it phosphorylates. The Type I receptor phosphorylates an R-SMAD a transcriptional regulator.  Function  Unlike the TGFβ type II receptor, which has a high affinity for TGF-β1, BMPR2 does not have a high affinity for BMP-2, BMP-7 and BMP-4, unless it is co-expressed with a type I BMP receptor. On ligand binding, forms a receptor complex consisting of two type II and two type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Type II receptors phosphorylate and activate type I receptors which autophosphorylate, then bind and activate SMAD transcriptional regulators. Binds to BMP-7, BMP-2 and, less efficiently, BMP-4. Binding is weak but enhanced by the presence of type I receptors for BMPs. In TGF beta signaling all of the receptors exist in homodimers before ligand binding. In the case of BMP receptors only a small fraction of the receptors exist in homomeric forms before ligand binding. Once a ligand has bound to a receptor, the amount of homomeric receptor oligomers increase, suggesting that the equilibrium shifts towards the homodimeric form. The low affinity for ligands suggests that BMPR2 may differ from other type II TGF beta receptors in that the ligand may bind the type I receptor first.  Oocyte Development  BMPR2 is expressed on both human and animal granulosa cells, and is a crucial receptor for bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) and growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF 9). These two protein signaling molecules and their BMPR2 mediated effects play an important role in follicle development in preparation for ovulation. However, BMPR2 can't bind BMP15 and GDF9 without the assistance of bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1B (BMPR1B) and transforming growth factor β receptor 1 (TGFβR1) respectively. There is evidence that the BMPR2 signaling pathway is disrupted in the case of polycystic ovary syndrome, possibly by hyperaldosterism. It appears that the hormones estrogen and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) have roles in regulating expression of BMPR2 in granulosa cells. Experimental treatment in animal models with estradiol with or without FSH increased BMPR2 mRNA expression while treatment with FSH alone decreased BMPR2 expression. However, in human granulosa-like tumor cell line (KGN), treatment with FSH increased BMPR2 expression.  Clinical significance  An inactivating mutation in the BMPR2 gene has been linked to pulmonary arterial hypertension. BMPR2 functions to inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle tissue. It functions by promoting the survival of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, therefore preventing arterial damage and adverse inflammatory responses. It also inhibits pulmonary arterial proliferation in response to growth factors, which prevents the closing of arteries by proliferating endothelial cells. When this gene is inhibited, vascular smooth muscle proliferates and can cause pulmonary hypertension, which, among other things, can lead to cor pulmonale, a condition that causes the right side of the heart to fail. The dysfunction of BMPR2 can also lead to an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure due to an adverse response of the pulmonary circuit to injury. It is especially important to screen for BMPR2 mutations in relatives of patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, for these mutations are present in >70% of familial cases. There have been studies which has correlated BMPR2 with exercise induced elevation of PA pressure by measuring tricuspid regurgitation velocity by echocardiography.

Standing on the north side of Hastings Street and bounded by Willingdon Avenue to the west and Fell Avenue in the east, this neighbourhood is known for its Italian, Portuguese, and Croatian expat communities as well as being a student area associated with the nearby Simon Fraser University. Spring on Capitol Hill History According to the Greater Vancouver Book (Editor in Chief Chuck Davis), Capitol Hill was logged by early settler L.I. Dundas in 1902 who used oxen to transport lumber. There is Dundas Street in North Burnaby. Housing There are several apartment buildings in the area, mainly along Hastings Street and Holdom Avenue. Although the majority of housing is single- family, the size and value of land increases towards the top of the hill as does the view of downtown Vancouver, the mountains and the water. Notable Canadians One of Canada's most notable inventors, Donald Lewes Hings, CM MBE (November 6, 1907 – February 25, 2004) lived at the peak of Capitol Hill. In 1937 he created a portable radio signaling system for his employer CM&S;, which he called a \\"packset\\", but which later became known as the \\"Walkie- Talkie\\". Also, one of Canada' most celebrated artists, Jack Leonard Shadbolt, OC OBC (February 4, 1909 – November 22, 1998) was a Canadian painter lived on HarbourView, an extension of Glynde Avenue on Capitol Hill.

The battle, having taken place in the modern-day hamlet of Warnerville, New York, near the modern (2019) Cobleskill-Richmondville High School, marked the beginning of a phase in which Loyalists and Iroquois, encouraged and supplied by British authorities in the Province of Quebec, raided and destroyed numerous villages on what was then the United States western frontier of New York and Pennsylvania. A small party of Iroquois entered Cobleskill and drew the local defenders into a trap set by a much larger party of Iroquois and Loyalists under the command of Joseph Brant. After killing a number of the militia and driving off the remainder, Brant's forces destroyed much of the settlement. New York's defenders retaliated against Brant's actions against Cobleskill and other communities by destroying Iroquois villages later in the year, and Continental Army forces destroyed more Iroquois villages in the Sullivan Expedition of 1779. Background With the failure of British General John Burgoyne's campaign to the Hudson after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777, the American Revolutionary War in upstate New York became a frontier war.Graymont, pp. 155–156 British leaders in the Province of Quebec supported Loyalist and Native American partisan fighters with supplies and armaments.Kelsay, p. 212 During the winter of 1777–78 Brant and other British-allied Indians developed plans to attack frontier settlements in New York and Pennsylvania.Graymont, p. 160 In February 1778 Brant established a base of operations at Onaquaga (present-day Windsor, New York). He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in May.Barr, p. 150Kelsay, p. 216Graymont, p. 165 One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of John Butler, who was planning operations in the Susquehanna River valley.Halsey, p. 207 In 1778 the settlement of Cobleskill, New York consisted of twenty families living on farms spread out along Cobleskill Creek. It was part of the Schoharie Creek area which was a significant source of food for the Patriot war effort.Proceedings of the New York Historical Society, pp. 35, 37 Its principal defense was the small local militia under Captain Christian Brown. When attacks by the Iroquois were rumored to be coming in the spring of 1778, the militia appealed for additional defenses. Continental Army Colonel Ichabod Alden sent a company of thirty to forty men from his 7th Massachusetts Regiment under Captain William Patrick to reinforce the militia.Hart, p. 3:132Proceedings of the New York Historical Society, p. 37 Battle Joseph Brant, portrait by Charles Willson Peale On the morning of May 30 Brant laid a trap for Cobleskill's defenders. He sent forward a small number of natives as a lure. Captain Patrick's force and the local militia spotted them near the southern edge of the settlement. Despite Captain Brown's warning that the Indians might be setting a trap, Patrick pressed forward as the natives withdrew, engaging them in a running battle. After about one mile (1.6 km) Brant sprung his trap, and Patrick's company was engulfed by Brant's larger force. Both Patrick and his second in command were killed in the battle, as was about half of their force. Brown organized the remaining forces into a fighting retreat back into the settlement. Five men took refuge in the house of George Warner which the attackers set on fire, killing all five men.Graymont, p. 166 A total of 22 settlers were killed, eight were wounded, and five captured by Brant's men,Barr, p. 151 while Brant's force suffered an estimated 25 casualties.Allen, p. 255 Aftermath Brant and his men burned ten houses and associated outbuildings before withdrawing, killing any cattle they could not take. Brant took five [seven] prisoners, [which the Indians prepared to burn at the stake as retribution for a previous group of captives effecting an escape from the Indians, killing several Indians to do so. This group of seven prisoners were made to gather wood for their own funeral pryer, and the fire was actually lit, before one of the captives, Lt. Maynard, a freemason, gave the mason signal of distress. Chief Brant noticed this, and stopped the execution. All of the seven captives were then made to march 40 days, first to Montreal, then to Quebec, obtaining only the sustenance they were able to gather while on the forced march. On the journey the Indians forced these seven captives to repeatedly \\"run the gauntlet\\" and forced them at times to keep their fingertips pushed into hot glowing pipe bowls for the Indians' amusement. They were never given a choice of their future or lives by the Indians, or Chief Brant at any time. At Quebec these seven were ransomed by the Iroquois to the British authorities, and were kept at Quebec as prisoners of war until the treaty of 1783. The account of Lt. Maynard is related in \\"1000 Famous Freemasons\\" along with stories of an additional five masons, other revolutionary patriots, who were likewise saved by Brant. The groups capture and journey is chronicled in \\"Forests and Clearings by BF Hubbard, Montreal, 1874 pp. 62–63-64.] Brant continued to build his forces and raid frontier communities in the Mohawk valley.Graymont, pp. 166–167 He considered following up the attack on Cobleskill with one on Cherry Valley, but because the militia was on high alert, he instead withdrew back to Iroquois territory.Mintz, p. 51 Cherry Valley was the scene of a massacre the following November by forces led in part by Brant.Halsey, p. 240 New York Governor George Clinton, who had been considering operations against Onaquaga, enlarged those plans after the raid on Cobleskill and Brant's attack on German Flatts in September. In October 1778 Continental and militia forces destroyed Onaquaga and Unadilla, another Indian village that supported Brant and Butler.Halsey, pp. 229–234Barr, p. 152 The settlers of Cobleskill who were rendered destitute by the action received £200 in compensation for their troubles. Settlers from many area communities began withdrawing to larger, better fortified communities like Cherry Valley (which began construction of a fort after the raid) and Schenectady. This action and later ones by Brant and Butler contributed to the decision by the Continental Congress to authorize a major Continental Army expedition into Iroquois territory.Graymont, p. 167 Commanded by Generals John Sullivan and James Clinton, the 1779 expedition systematically destroyed the villages of Iroquois tribes fighting for the British, but did little to stop the frontier war.Graymont, pp. 194–223 Notes References     External links *Three Rivers History *schohariehistory.net *6th (7th) Massachusetts Regiment Category:1778 in the United States Cobleskill Cobleskill Cobleskill Cobleskill Cobleskill Cobleskill Category:Schoharie County, New York Category:1778 in New York (state) Cobleskill ","title":"Battle of Cobleskill"},{"id":"5818230","text":"View over the Elgin valley from the west Elgin is a large, lush area of land, circled by mountains, in the Overberg region of South Africa. This broad upland valley lies about 70 km southeast of Cape Town, just beyond the Hottentots Holland Mountains. The Elgin region is centered on the town of Grabouw. The Elgin Valley is one of the more intensively farmed districts of South Africa and produces 60% of the national apple crop. Consequently it is now internationally known as the place in South Africa “where the apples come from”.Elgin Valley Information Center http://www.elginvalley.co.za/default.aspx , 3 August 2009 However a recent shift in economic focus has led to Elgin also becoming one of South Africa's most notable and successful wine regions, with the coolest climate of any region in the country. Elgin wines and tourism have consequently become significant parts of the valley's economy.Elgin - Wine Regions of South Africa Deciduous fruit, Flowers and Wine The Elgin valley is historically known for its deciduous fruit farming Today the Elgin valley is renowned for its apple and pear orchards, its greenhouse cut flowers, its rose growing, and, increasingly, for the production of high quality, cool climate wines. Over 40 percent of South Africa’s apple production is exported,USDA Foreign Agricultural Service: GAIN Report Number: SF8016, pub. 19 June 2008 and the Elgin Valley produces about 60 percent of the total annual apple crop of about 819,000 metric tonnes (2012 data). Industry and government export estimates can vary slightly. The United Kingdom is the top destination for South African apples, with Malaysia, Benin and Netherlands as the next largest importers of South African apples. Granny Smith and Golden Delicious were the top apple varieties exported in 2007/08. South Africa is said to be the only southern hemisphere county that produces a top quality Golden Delicious apple, a major advantage against competing exporting countries. Elgin has more recently developed a large and thriving wine industry, and wines from the region have won several international awards. It is South Africa's coolest climate wine growing region. Other key geographic factors include its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the prevailing wind directions, and its altitude. The cool temperatures and plentiful winter rainfall mean that the Elgin basin has a set of conditions for wine growing which are markedly different to those in surrounding areas. Of the many varietals grown in the region, special attention has been paid to Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir.Elgin Wine Route - South Africa Directory SiteWines of ElginD. Jansen, K. Leresche: Exploring the Cape Winelands. CTP. Penstock Publishing, South Africa. 2015. . Route 9. Elgin. pp.142-153. The region is historically significant for South Africa's wine history also because it had one of the earliest movements towards Black ownership of vineyards and wineries. The Elgin winery Thandi was in fact the country's second post-Apartheid winery with significant black involvement (after New Beginnings in Paarl).A. Domine (ed.): Wine. pg 752-769, Ullmann Publishing, 2008. . Location of the Elgin valley, to the east of Cape Town. Grabouw Old buildings on the outskirts of Grabouw Today, the town of Grabouw, in the heart of the vast Elgin Valley, is the commercial centre for what is the largest single export fruit producing area in Southern Africa. It lies just to the north of the N2 highway, and has a population of 30,337 (2011).https://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/171009Elgin and Grabouw. Overberg Municipality Website Grabouw was created on the farm Grietjiesgat acquired on 22 November 1856 by Wilhelm Langschmidt, who named the place after Grabow, the village of his birth in Germany. His wife opened a small trading store and he was the bookkeeper. Later he sold parts of his farm and so began the farming community of Grabouw as it was later spelled. Langschmidt was the father of 23 children, including 3 sets of twins. Etymology Early map of the farms around the Palmiet River, Elgin In the late 1800s, a locally-born child named \\"Elgine Herold\\" was killed by snakebite near the Palmiet River. Her distraught father named the area of land \\"Elgin\\" in his daughter's memory, with support from other locals. Two main events caused this name eventually to be used for the entire valley. Firstly, when the earliest railway was built through the area, it was found that this plot of land was the most suitable for a railway station, and the station was consequently also named \\"Elgin\\". For decades, this station provided the main connection between the people and produce of the valley, and the outside world. The name therefore became known around the world due to Elgin's famous agricultural produce. Secondly, two young brothers had bought a small plot of land here named \\"Glen Elgin\\" in 1903, where they grew vegetables. The Molteno brothers were partially responsible for revolutionising the region's deciduous farming industry and, in an unusual move in the 1950s, they ordered that their vast \\"Glen Elgin\\" farming enterprise was to be divided up and returned \\"...to Elgin's farmworkers and inhabitants for their own use.\\"C. Schoeman: The Historical Overberg. Traces of the Past in South Africa's Southernmost Region. Penguin Random House South Africa. 2017. p.27. The name \\"Elgin\\" thereby gained a certain significance, as the name by which some of the region's land first began to be shared with the majority. A range of other names were applied for the region, or parts of the region, over the course of its history. The original Chainouqua Khoikhoi names for the various parts of the valley were unfortunately not well recorded. Early colonial era names included the Dutch name \\"Groenland\\" (\\"Greenland\\"), used variously for the Groenland mountains to the north, and sometimes for the low-lying area to the south. The name \\"Grietjiesgat\\", after the farm owned by the settler Wilhelm Langschmidt, was used for parts of the valley, including the area where the modern town of Grabouw is located. Yet another early name was \\"Koffiekraal\\", after the spot where settlers unhitched oxen from the wagons, between Bot River and Palmiet River on the Cape Town to Caledon road.

By the middle of the 20th century, there was widespread standardisation of the naming, so that the names became popularly recognised as \\"Elgin\\" for the low- lying farming valley to the south; \\"Groenland\\" for the green mountainous area to the north; and \\"Grabouw\\" for the town.R.

The original inhabitants of the area were the Khoikhoi pastoralists and the San hunter gatherers. The indigenous people of the region, the Chainouqua Khoi, inhabited a large area on both sides of the Hottentots Holland Mountains. They traded with early European settlers, but were later dispossessed from their lands by the Dutch colonists, who began to move into the area in the late 1600s.E. Boonzaier: The Cape Herders: A History of the Khoikhoi of Southern Africa New Africa Books, 1996. p.78. https://camissapeople.wordpress.com/ After displacing the Chainouqua Khoi, the colonists divided up the Chainouqua land into farms, and the region remained a relatively underdeveloped backwater for many centuries. Several waves of settlers arrived in the valley, after the initial Dutch colonists. Small numbers of British settlers arrived from the 19th century. Other diverse groups of settlers arrived in smaller numbers, including even groups of Italian prisoners of war. However demographically, the valley remained predominantly Afrikaans speaking, like the majority of the greater Overberg area. Similarly, land remained in the hands of a minority of farmers, while the majority of the region's inhabitants remained landless. The development of the region changed substantially in the early 20th century, with the arrival of several influential families who had an enormous effect on Elgin. Sir Antonie Viljoen, an Afrikaans medical doctor, bought a farm named Oak Valley Estate in the Elgin Valley in 1898. He spent much of the next few years under house arrest on his farm (he had signed up as a medical officer with the Boer army, during the war, and was soon captured by the British. His internment on Oak Valley was only granted on condition that he paid for the services of two British soldiers to guard him for the duration of the war!) Antonie Viljoen was a farmer extraordinaire growing everything from grape vines to potatoes. Amongst his many farming achievements were the purchase of the first deciduous fruit trees in the Elgin valley. These were initially grown and maintained by his farm labourers, mostly as their own private project. However they constituted the first known deciduous orchard in the region, and Antonie Viljoen's farm workers deserve the honour of being the first true deciduous fruit farmers of Elgin.S. Stander: Tree of Life. The Story of Cape Fruit. S&W; Ltd. Cape Town. 1983. p.62. In 1903 an Italian South African family named Molteno began farming in the area. Two friends of Dr Viljoen, the young brothers Edward and Harry Molteno initially bought a small plot of land named \\"Glen Elgin\\", near the modern Elgin railway station, where they grew vegetables. They soon started growing deciduous fruit though, and built up a vast fruit farming enterprise that spanned the entire valley. Charismatic and eccentric, they long dominated the fruit export industry but later left their enormous network of farms, as a trust, to be broken up, distributed, and used for the benefit of the farm workers and the region's inhabitants.Phillida Brooke Simons: Apples of the sun : being an account of the lives, vision and achievements of the Molteno brothers. Vlaeberg: Fernwood Press, 1999. A. Cartwright: Outspan, Die Goue Oes, Geskiedenis van die Suid- Afrikaanse Sitrusbedryf. Purnell & Sons. Cape Town. 1977. These early farming groups had a relatively inclusive and progressive effect on the Cape's conservative farming society. Sir Antonie was an MP in the Cape Parliament and, together with fellow MP James Molteno, he launched the first movement to give women of all races the right to vote, in 1907. Another progressive local entrepreneur who had an enormous influence on the valley was Kathleen Murray, who was a leader in the Black Sash among other political activities.M.Coburn: The Overberg: Inland from the Tip of Africa.

They are yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup. History Moldova played their first international on October 10, 1991 against Lithuania. Moldova won the match, 22 points to six. The next year they played against Bulgaria, which Moldova won, 42 points to three. Moldova played Hungary in 1995, which they won, by three points, 17 to 14. They played Georgia, who defeated them 47 to five. They then played Ukraine and Latvia and Bulgaria soon after. Moldova played twice in 1997, defeating Norway and losing to Croatia. They won a number of fixtures in 2000. They played the Netherlands the following year. The national rugby team was designated by the members of Moldova's Sports Press Association as the best Moldovan team in 2004. Following this, they played in qualifying tournaments for the 2007 Rugby World Cup European qualifiers. Moldova were grouped in Pool B of the second round, and they won two of their four matches, which saw them finish second in their pool behind Germany, and thus move onto round three and enter Pool A in round 3. However, their road to the World Cup was ended when a respectful 2nd place above Poland, Netherlands and Andorra was not enough to proceed to round 4. Popularity Surprisingly, the popularity of rugby in Moldova is growing rapidly, with well over 1,250 fans regularly turning up to their home matches in the European Nations Cup. Since 2004, the number of Moldovan rugby players has more than doubled, due to the national team's growing international reputation. Notable players Moldovan international Alexei Cotruţa was the top try-scorer in the Russian Professional Rugby League in 2006, scoring 16 tries in 14 matches for Moscow-area side VVA-Podmoskovye. During March 2011, Vadim Cobîlaş signed for Aviva Premiership side, Sale Sharks. Shortly after, his younger brother Maxim Cobîlaş also signed for Aviva Premiership side, Sale Sharks making the two the first Moldovan players to sign for a professional English team. More recently, props Dmitri Arhip and Gheorghe Gajion have signed for two Welsh regional sides, Cardiff Blues and Ospreys. On the 23rd of August 2018, Cristian Ojovan another prop made his debut for D2 side Aurillacois.

The Indian Boreas rated him for staying in his dominions after he had routed away the flowers, and driven off the sea-gulls and herons. Shingebis laughed at him, and the North Wind went at night and tried to blow down his hut and put out his fire. As he could not do this, he defied the diver to come forth and wrestle with him. Shingebis obeyed the summons, and sent the blusterer howling to his home. The People of the Three Fires, the Odawa, Ojibwe and Podawadomi Indians of the Great Lakes area, had many stories about winter. In one, Shingebis is a diving duck who dared Winter. Shingebis decided that he would not trouble himself to fly south for the winter. He was sure he could survive just fine in his summer home. He built himself a warm lodge and got four big logs for his fire, one for each month of winter. Fairly soon, along came Kabibonooka, the Winter Maker. Kabibonooka was angry with Shingebis for staying in his dominions after he had routed away the flowers, and driven off the sea-gulls and herons. Shingebis laughed at him, and Kabibonooka went at night and tried to blow down his wigwam and put out his fire. As he could not do this, he froze the lake where Shingebis hunted for food. Shingebis found that he could pull the reeds and make a hole in the ice, dive through and get his fish. Kabibonooka raged and sent an ice storm so fierce that the lake froze too deep to break through by pulling the reeds. Shingebiss grew very hungry, and when the storm finally subsided, he managed to use his beak to break through the ice and get some fish. This went on for three moons. Each time it got colder, Shingebis would get another log. Kabibonooka was becoming truly outraged, and he followed Shingebis to the lake and froze him in. He was so surprised when Shingebis managed to pull reeds and peck a big enough hole to get out, dragging a string of fish. He finally challenged Shingebis to let him into his lodge. He knew he could freeze the little duck that way. Shingebis cheerfully put his last log on the fire, and prepared for his guest. As Kabibonooka sat there by the fire in the warm lodge, he did his best to freeze the fire, but Shingebis would stir it up and it got very warm in the lodge. Weaker and weaker from the heat, Kabibonooka finally turned and left. Soon after that Ziigwan (Spring) came. Kabibonooka never bothered Shingebis again. This story teaches that those who follow the ways of Shingebis will always be warm and have plenty to eat no matter how hard the winter is.

This plain was one of fours plains - the Ginninderra Plain, the Limestone Plain, and the Tuggeranong Plain (Isabella's Plain) are the others - upon which the city of Canberra is situated. The term Molonglo Plains refers collectively to the flood plains along the entire length of the Molonglo River, including the flood plain located north-east of Queanbeyan on the Molonglo River. The upper Molonglo Plain sometimes referred to as the Hoskinstown Plain is bordered to the east by the low ridges of the Turallo Range, Forbes Creek Ridge and Thurralilly Hill before the steep rise up to the top of the Great Dividing Range. The area is noted as the birthplace of cricketer and Australian rules football pioneer Tom Wills.  Upper Molonglo Plain  Some of the Queanbeyan district's most successful rural stations specifically 'Gidleigh', 'Foxlow', 'Carwoola' and 'Primrose Valley' were located on the Molonglo flood plain. 'Foxlow' was established by HC Antill who relinquished the grant to J Hoskins after whom the village of Hoskinstown is named.  Lower Molonglo Plain  Prior to Lake Burley Griffin's inception the fertile soils of the Molonglo plain were some of most productive in the Canberra region. John Joshua Moore was the first pastoralist to occupy land on the present site of Canberra, preceding Robert Campbell by about a year. It was, however, only an outstation formed by an overseer and a few convict stockmen. Moore's property took in the present sites of the hospital, of Civic Centre and of the Australian National University and the portions of the Molonglo Plain (2006), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University In 1843 during a depression he sold the land to Lieutenant Lieutenant Arthur Jeffreys, R.N., son-in-law of Robert Campbell. Of the original buildings situated on the former Molonglo Plain, only 'Blundells cottage' remains today. It was constructed in the year 1858 by Robert's son George Campbell for the use of his ploughman William Ginn at a point above the natural flood level, about 400 metres north of the course of the Molonglo River. A number of others building situated near to or on the Molonglo Plain have been lost to Canberra's urban development over the past 70 years. The Klensendorlffe villa is one of the most impressive, a substantial oblong stone ten-roomed stone house, which stood until the mid-1920s near the present site of Albert Hall. The Acton homestead established in about 1843 by Lieutenant Arthur Jeffreys survived until 1941 when it was demolished to make way for the Canberra Community Hospital..  River flow changes  The viability of the floods plains relies of regular flood events that deposit soil and other water borne nutrients onto the plain. The Googong Dam was constructed in 1979 on the Queanbeyan River at a point about 5 km above Queanbeyan. This structure regulates river flows below the junction of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo River. The lower Molonglo River experienced its last major flooding event in 1971.

The idea behind relevance feedback is to take the results that are initially returned from a given query, to gather user feedback, and to use information about whether or not those results are relevant to perform a new query. We can usefully distinguish between three types of feedback: explicit feedback, implicit feedback, and blind or \\"pseudo\\" feedback.  Explicit feedback  Explicit feedback is obtained from assessors of relevance indicating the relevance of a document retrieved for a query. This type of feedback is defined as explicit only when the assessors (or other users of a system) know that the feedback provided is interpreted as relevance judgments. Users may indicate relevance explicitly using a binary or graded relevance system. Binary relevance feedback indicates that a document is either relevant or irrelevant for a given query. Graded relevance feedback indicates the relevance of a document to a query on a scale using numbers, letters, or descriptions (such as \\"not relevant\\", \\"somewhat relevant\\", \\"relevant\\", or \\"very relevant\\"). Graded relevance may also take the form of a cardinal ordering of documents created by an assessor; that is, the assessor places documents of a result set in order of (usually descending) relevance. An example of this would be the SearchWiki feature implemented by Google on their search website. The relevance feedback information needs to be interpolated with the original query to improve retrieval performance, such as the well- known Rocchio algorithm. A performance metric which became popular around 2005 to measure the usefulness of a ranking algorithm based on the explicit relevance feedback is NDCG. Other measures include precision at k and mean average precision.  Implicit feedback  Implicit feedback is inferred from user behavior, such as noting which documents they do and do not select for viewing, the duration of time spent viewing a document, or page browsing or scrolling actions.https://web.archive.org/web/20040316204714/http://www.scils.rutgers.edu/etc/mongrel/kelly- belkin-SIGIR2001.pdf There are many signals during the search process that one can use for implicit feedback and the types of information to provide in response.Jansen, B. J. and McNeese, M. D. 2005. Evaluating the effectiveness of and patterns of interactions with automated assistance in IR systems. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. 56(14), 1480-1503Kelly, Diane, and Jaime Teevan. \\"Implicit feedback for inferring user preference: a bibliography.\\" ACM SIGIR Forum. Vol. 37. No. 2. ACM, 2003. The key differences of implicit relevance feedback from that of explicit include:https://web.archive.org/web/20070611121933/http://haystack.lcs.mit.edu/papers/kelly.sigirforum03.pdf # the user is not assessing relevance for the benefit of the IR system, but only satisfying their own needs and # the user is not necessarily informed that their behavior (selected documents) will be used as relevance feedback An example of this is dwell time, which is a measure of how long a user spends viewing the page linked to in a search result. It is an indicator of how well the search result met the query intent of the user, and is used as a feedback mechanism to improve search results.  Blind feedback  Pseudo relevance feedback, also known as blind relevance feedback, provides a method for automatic local analysis. It automates the manual part of relevance feedback, so that the user gets improved retrieval performance without an extended interaction. The method is to do normal retrieval to find an initial set of most relevant documents, to then assume that the top \\"k\\" ranked documents are relevant, and finally to do relevance feedback as before under this assumption. The procedure is: # Take the results returned by initial query as relevant results (only top k with k being between 10 and 50 in most experiments). # Select top 20-30 (indicative number) terms from these documents using for instance tf-idf weights. # Do Query Expansion, add these terms to query, and then match the returned documents for this query and finally return the most relevant documents. Some experiments such as results from the Cornell SMART system published in (Buckley et al.1995), show improvement of retrieval systems performances using pseudo-relevance feedback in the context of TREC 4 experiments. This automatic technique mostly works. Evidence suggests that it tends to work better than global analysis.Jinxi Xu and W. Bruce Croft, expansion using local and global document analysis, in Proceedings of the 19th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (SIGIR), 1996. Through a query expansion, some relevant documents missed in the initial round can then be retrieved to improve the overall performance. Clearly, the effect of this method strongly relies on the quality of selected expansion terms. It has been found to improve performance in the TREC ad hoc task . But it is not without the dangers of an automatic process. For example, if the query is about copper mines and the top several documents are all about mines in Chile, then there may be query drift in the direction of documents on Chile. In addition, if the words added to the original query are unrelated to the query topic, the quality of the retrieval is likely to be degraded, especially in Web search, where web documents often cover multiple different topics. To improve the quality of expansion words in pseudo-relevance feedback, a positional relevance feedback for pseudo-relevance feedback has been proposed to select from feedback documents those words that are focused on the query topic based on positions of words in feedback documents.Yuanhua Lv and ChengXiang Zhai, relevance model for pseudo-relevance feedback, in Proceedings of the 33rd international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval (SIGIR), 2010. Specifically, the positional relevance model assigns more weights to words occurring closer to query words based on the intuition that words closer to query words are more likely to be related to the query topic. Blind feedback automates the manual part of relevance feedback and has the advantage that assessors are not required.  Using relevance information  Relevance information is utilized by using the contents of the relevant documents to either adjust the weights of terms in the original query, or by using those contents to add words to the query. Relevance feedback is often implemented using the Rocchio algorithm.

Guitars by different builders often reflect different sound preferences—e.g., when comparing instruments of Lacôte or Grobert, with Torres, etc. All can have high sound quality, yet many guitarists feel one may be more appropriate for particular repertoire choices, e.g., Lacôte or Grobert for \\"classical era repertoire\\" or \\"central European romantic repertoire\\"; versus Torres for \\"Spanish or late-romantic nationalist repertoire\\", etc.). #\\"Playability\\" aspects This includes the shaping of the frets,Fernandez \\"Custom Set-up\\" for frets, etc.; video demonstration string-spacing, neck-width, neck, nut and bridge height (influence on action); decisions about scale-length; etc. The aim is a guitar that is easy and comfortable to play, does not have string-buzz, and suits the requirements/desires of a particular player. #\\"Visual/decorative\\" aspects This includes the visual features of the guitar, including rosette design, inlays, ornamentation, etc. (In general these creative visual aspects should not interfere or diminish the sound features, or hinder the playability of the guitar). Fernando Sor has written that an instrument-maker \\"should be an accurate draughtsman, understand the common principles of mechanics, the composition and resolution of forces, and the laws of vibrating strings and surfaces\\". Gasparo Duiffopruggar (1514 - c. 1570) - Engraving by Pierre Woeiriot (1532–1599) Viva fui in sylvis, sum dura occisa securi, dum vixi, tacui, mortua dulce cano Shaping of wood with acoustics and resonance aims This shaping of the wood is known as \\"resonance plate tuning\\"Die Theorie der harmonischen Abstimmung der Resonanzplatten bei der Geige ... (1907) by Max Grossmann (Grossmann's text should not be interpreted as the only way to do plate tuning. They simply represent Grossmann's own theories—which were used by luthier Otto Seifert from c. 1904 - c. 1914) (or \\"plate tuning\\"). It refers to a comprehensive tuning of the wood and bracing (its density, thickness, tension, sound-influence) to influence the acoustic properties. It does not refer to a tuning of the guitar-body to a single \\"default\\" frequency. Instead, it is a comprehensive way of shaping the wood and its response and resonance properties to improve the guitar's sound. The \\"tuning\\" of the wood is also called \\"voicing\\" the instrument. The techniques used trace to previous centuries, especially in violin-making (example: attempt at understanding some of the tuning schemes of Italian violins: 1, 2). Some guitarmakers believe that the actual voicing of the wood, and working with and \\"shaping\\" the wood (during and even after construction) is more important than the outer construction itself (such as chosen bracing): \\"As my skill and experience have grown I have come to believe that what makes a good guitar good is firstly how well fine tuned and balanced it is rather than what type of strutting system it is built with. Different strutting systems can add different flavours to the sound but is never the main factor in the Good Guitar.\\" (Per Hallgren) Sound characteristics (Timbre) Spectrum One of the important aspects that good luthiers need to understand, is that a single tone consists of the \\"fundamental and simultaneous overtones\\".Modes, Overtones and Harmonics - Chapter 3 from The Physics of Music and Musical Instruments by David Lapp (Historically the scientific analysis of this discovery can be associated with Nicole Oresme,Nicole Oresme Marin Mersenne and Joseph Sauveur.) The ratio of the \\"intensity of fundamental\\" and the various overtones, defines the \\"colour\\" (Frequency spectrum) of the tone. Overtones are simply frequencies that are at a multiple of the base fundamental frequency. (Overtones defining colour, do not only occur in instruments, but also in the human voice. When singing a note, there are numerous overtones present. Singers experienced in overtone singing are able to control their voice in such a way, that they can increase the intensity of any high overtone to such an extent, that it becomes clearly audible, whilst simultaneously singing the fundamental. In this way two pitches (fundamental and high-intensity overtone) can be made clearly audible while singing.Overtone singing, Frequency Spectrum of the voice, showing the fundamental and various overtones: octave, ..., and high-intensity higher overtones (a melody is created, by shifting the intensity to various overtones, while others are more suppressed)) Tonal colour is an important characteristic on a guitar. Usually the notes of the guitar's different registers (low bass, mid-range, high, etc.) have different colour-spectrums, i.e., differing relative intensities of fundamental to different overtones. Various types of guitars have tone-differences in the various registers (also differences in response, action, etc.). Specific colour-spectrum characteristics of certain types of guitars can be said to form a specific \\"sound aesthetic\\"—this is like a \\"fingerprint\\" of the characteristic of that type of guitar. Other guitars have a different \\"sound aesthetic\\", i.e., a different colour-spectrum characteristic. Different historic instruments reflect various sound aesthetics. Temporal change of spectrum (attack/onset, decay) Important in characterizing the sound of instruments (or more precisely, notes of particular registers), is how the player initiates the sound. This is the attack or onset: a short-duration transient. This occurs at the moment when a string is plucked - the string builds up motion for some time, before it can vibrate in the normal way. The attack is nonlinear and usually has very high-pitched frequencies present. The duration of the transient (until normal string vibration continues) and frequencies occurring during the transient, are a very important factor in how we perceive the tone. Once the string is in its normal mode of vibration, the standard colour-spectrum is present. As time progresses the amplitude of the vibrations decreases, and usually the intensities of higher pitched overtones decay at a faster rate than the intensities of fundamental and lower overtones (thus a change of colour over the vibrating-time). In this way one can observe the acoustic \\"envelope\\": the attack, followed by the way the intensity of frequencies (fundamental and overtones) decrease with time. The \\"envelope\\" can thus be regarded as the temporal change of the spectrum of the sound. This envelope is different for notes in different registers. Thus the tone or timbre is determined by: *Attack or onset (how long until normal vibration of the string? -> response of the guitar) *Relative intensities of frequency spectrum: fundamental to overtones (defines colour -> colour change over vibrating time, since the higher-freq overtones decay quicker) These factors can be influenced by the shaping of the wood. A good luthier understands how to shape the wood to directly influence these acoustic properties. Guitar players can actively vary the timbre by the way they pluck the string—by changing the nail or finger angle, the distance from the bridge, etc. A good instrument helps the musician produce widely varying timbres and have yet have good resonance. Nevertheless, a default colour and response is identifiable for notes in the different registers and define the instrument's sound. Styles of \\"sound aesthetic\\" As was mentioned, it is possible to group historic instruments according to the colour and response sound characteristic (present for notes in the various registers). A baroque guitar has a different \\"sound aesthetic\\" than a 19th-century guitar, i.e. a differing colour-spectrum in the various registers (low, mid, high) and a different duration of attack (response of the instrument). The \\"sound aesthetic\\" is determined by the sound characteristic of notes in specific registers (an instrument's low notes has a different relative timbre, than its high notes). There is a historical parallel between musical styles (baroque, classical, romantic, Spanish nationalist, flamenco, jazz) and the style of \\"sound aesthetic\\" of the musical instruments used: Robert de Visée played on a baroque guitar with a very different sound aesthetic than the guitars used by Mauro Giuliani or Luigi Legnani - they used 19th-century guitars. Whilst the difference between baroque guitars and 19th-century guitars is large and immediately obvious, one can also identify differences in style within the 19th-century guitars themselves: They are part of the same family, but one can distinguish early Italian instruments (Fabricatore), then French instruments and Viennese instruments, etc.As an example: Viennese guitars usually have more fundamental in the tone (but less, than with Torres fan-bracing), while the earlier French models have more overtones Guitar making in the 19th century To get a picture some of the ideas on guitar-building from the 19th century, some newspaper reports of guitar-related patents (note that the newspaper reports given in the cross-references are only brief mentionings, with the actual patent papers providing more details and drawings etc.) and other newspaper writings are listed: *Arzberger *Johann Georg Staufer and Johann Ertl1 *Bernhard Enzensperger *Franz Besetzny *Wenzel Soukup *Lacôte, Carulli: Décacorde *J.F. Salomon: Harpolyre *Ventura: Harp Ventura (modification of harp and guitar) There are also 19th-century mentionings of Lacôte winning a prize for the quality of his instrument - the second prize went to Laprevotte. In the competition organized by Makaroff, it was the guitar of Scherzer that took first place. Guitars in the 19th century were initially all ladder-braced Examples of ladder-bracing: 1828 Lacote, A. Stauffer & Comp., ca. 1825, Lavigne, Paris circa 1815, (Pons- style Y-Bracing) (ref) Fabricatore Stauffer guitar from about 1836 (ref) Early 6-string guitar from about 1780: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 (ref ) Nicolas Bonafon around 1840 (ref) and had their tonal energy spread over a lot of overtones (a desirable characteristic in instruments of the early classical and romantic era), as opposed to the more fundamental-rich guitars of Torres. Francisco Sanguino was one of the first to experiment with fan-bracing, then came Páges and Panormo—but Torres did not use it, so Panormo and Páges still had more tonal energy spread over overtones, compared to the Torres guitars, which focus tonal energy more in the fundamental (desirable in Spanish music). Movable frets To solve all guitar intonation problems, or help guitarists use different musical temperaments (or to play microtonal music) it is necessary for the frets on the guitar to be adjustable. Work in this field began in the 19th century, when Thomas Perronet Thompson (1783–1869) wrote a work on the Enharmonic Guitar,Instructions to my daughter for playing on the enharmonic guitar: an attempt to effect the execution of correct harmony, on principles analogous to those of the ancient enharmonic by Thomas Perronet Thompson (1783–1869) image Review (The Harmonicon, 1830) Excerpt on temperament (The Harmonicon, 1830) Extended Review (The Westminster Review, Volume XVI, 1832) with ideas used by Panormo.Louis Panormo, \\"Enharmonic Guitar\\", London 1829 Lacôte also built a \\"guitare enharmonique\\"Lacote: Guitare Enharmonique (E.1043 Cite de la musique) photo1 photo2 ref \\"An enharmonic guitar by René François Lacôte, Paris, ca. 1850\\"; Description & Restoration Report: Ian Watchorn, Melbourne, 1990. with movable frets. The luthier Walter J. Vogt (1935–1990) developed a contemporary mechanism with movable frets,Walter J.

Other concepts for changeable frets, include removable detachable fingerboards: \\"switchboards\\".Patent: Fretted musical instrument with detachable fingerboard by Thomas D. StoneSwitchboards and Vogt System of movable fretsDetachable fingerboard image See also: article \\"Just guitar\\" by John Schneider Contemporary classical guitar making The basis of most modern classical guitar designs was developed by Spanish luthier Antonio Torres Jurado in the mid-19th century. Earlier guitars were often smaller bodied (though there are exceptions: Scherzer, Guadagnini, etc.). Torres created a Spanish design, with light materials supported by fan bracing. Torres' fan bracing was influential for modern classical guitars: it consists of wooden strips glued inside the body to provide support and particular deep resonance that is saturated in fundamental.fundamental as opposed to overtone (However, a type of fan bracing was already used before, in some guitars by the Spanish builder Joseph Páges, and after him Louis Panormo used a fan bracing too in some of his guitars from 1823 to 1854; but both Páges' and Panormo's guitars have a different sound aesthetic to Torres' guitars.) Torres used a string scale-length of 650 mm, which is usually the standard length for today's modern classical guitars. The designs Torres developed were later adapted by several very influential luthiers; Manuel Ramirez (1864-1916) and his brother José Ramírez (1858-1923), Hermann Hauser, Sr. (1882-1952) and Ignacio Fleta (1897-1977). More contemporary luthiers such as Robert Bouchet and Victor Bedikian also use the ideas and designs of Torres, Hauser, and Fleta in their own guitars. Some luthiers experiment with their own bracing, and some also offer cutaway, acoustic electric and composite top models. For years, Brazilian Rosewood was the industry standard as the best wood for the backs and sides of guitars. Unfortunately, the export of Brazilian Rosewood has been restricted due to the endangerment of the species. Much of the Brazilian Rosewood used for guitars is of poor quality, and the inflated price of the wood has caused many luthiers to search for alternative tonewoods. There are many other good very dry woods for guitar construction. In fact, of the surviving Torres instruments, the most common back and side wood used was maple. Many guitars made today use East Indian Rosewood because it is a close substitute for Brazilian Rosewood, is readily available in high-quality, and has desirable characteristics as tonewood. There are many other woods with the characteristics to make excellent guitars and are excellent alternatives: cocobolo, maple, bubinga (African Rosewood), African Blackwood, Camatillo Rosewood, Spanish Cypress (used exclusively for flamenco guitars), granadillo, ebony, satinwood, ziricote, among others, are excellent choices for backs and sides. Contemporary Innovations Lattice braced guitars The Australian guitarmaker Greg Smallman introduced guitars with an extremely thin soundboard, which is supported by bracing in the shape of a lattice. Smallman combines this with heavier, laminated back and sides with a frame. Smallman is well known for building the guitars played by John Williams. A large number of luthiers worldwide have incorporated Smallman's design innovations into their own guitars. Double-top, sandwich-top and composite-top The terms double-top, sandwich-top, and composite-top all refer to a relatively new way to construct the soundboard of a guitar, developed by Matthias Dammann in Germany in the late 1980s. Other luthiers such as Robert Ruck, Fritz Mueller, Jim Redgate, Michel Bruck, Boguslaw Teryks and Gernot Wagner have since adopted the method. A double top usually consists of a material called Nomex sandwiched by two thin sheets of tonewood. A flame resistant meta-aramid (a polymer used to make synthetic fiber) material, Nomex was originally designed by DuPont Chemical Co. in the 1960s as a lightweight material for use in the aviation industry. Luthiers use the honeycomb sheet (calendered paper) version of the product: the low mass, strength, and ease of shaping make it ideally suited for guitar soundboards. Though the construction of a double top significantly differs from the traditional soundboard, a double top guitar often looks just like a traditional guitar. A thin soundboard is often incorporated and used to obtain the most vibration and to allow for optimal sound. Criticism of Lattice Bracing, Double Tops, etc. While some people are positive towards innovations that directly affect a guitar's loudness, prefer the full round bodied tone, change in tone that can come with it (if done well),abc radio, John Williams and Craig Ogden. and feel that the loudness of some of these guitars (in particular Smallman guitars) is a by- product of their musical qualities rather than an end in itself;, John Williams. there are also a number of people who are generally critical of the tonal qualities of these guitars; why should guitar makers devote so much time in producing loud guitars with a thin sound, when the vast majority of guitarists do not need an exceptionally loud guitars? A Plea For Traditional Construction  Side Soundport  A number of luthiers are now incorporating a soundport, an additional small soundhole on the guitar's side, usually facing the player. This is said to allow air to move more freely in and out of the body of the guitar as it is vibrating, and to have the advantage of allowing the player to better hear the sound projecting from the guitar. The only published formal research on the latter subject suggests however that players may not be able to hear any difference in a soundport equipped guitar. Finger board Improvement of intonation and playability. Elevated fingerboard Some guitar makers like American Thomas Humphrey (who patented such a system in US patent 4,873,909), Italian guitarmaker Renato Barone, Frenchman Antoine Pappalardo, and the Canadian Fritz Mueller, make elevated fingerboard guitars. The primary advantage is to improve left hand playability on the upper frets, although the increased distance between the strings and the top is also advantageous for the right hand. The elevated fingerboard is visually unobtrusive from the front, and the instrument retains its traditional appearance. Curved fingerboard Some guitar makers like the French Antoine Pappalardo make a Curved fingerboard to improve the playability. High frets High frets facilitate vibrato and barreing, and generally aid in the development of a \\"lighter\\" left hand.  Multiple scale length fretboards  The 17th-century wire-strung instruments, Orpharion and Bandora are early examples of instruments featuring multiple scale fretboards. Armrest An armrest provides three primary benefits: it lessens damping of the top caused by the right forearm; it is potentially more comfortable for the player; and it absorbs the wear to the finish that would otherwise happen on the top, the binding, and the side. These benefits are of particular importance for ultra-thin-topped instruments, such as Smallman's, but could subtly improve any guitar, including double-tops. The state of classical guitar making Der Lautenmacher (The lute maker)Jost Amman: Der Lautenmacher - The Lute Maker by Kenneth Sparr by Jost Amman (1539–1591) While most classical guitar makers are today mainly concerned with making modern classical guitars with their typical fan-bracing or experimenting to make the instrument louder (e.g., \\"thin-top lattice-braced\\", \\"double-top\\", with results that are not without criticismTraditional versus modern construction of soundboards by Sebastian Stenzel ); they seem to give little consideration to historical sound ideals, or to tuning and voicing of the parts of the instrument.Example: José Romanillos (although he acknowledges that plate tuning may provide benefits: \\"a field to think about\\") looks upon plate tuning rather critically and—as can be seen from a video—he neither understands it (this can be deduced from his rather confused presentation, and strong difference when compared with Somogyi's presentation), nor does he use plate tuning in his own guitars. On the other hand, there are opinions that those guitar makers who openly refer to using plate tuning, may be using it more as a marketing gimmick, than something that they truly understand; and has a marked influence on the instrument's sound. *\\"[...] my building technique doesn't include \\"component tuning.\\" My experience of thirty five years has led me to the conclusion that \\"tuning\\" the sound of a guitar is an illusion and a chimera, and those who publicly advocate that they can accurately control the response of a guitar by responding to noises derived from tapping parts of it, are simply seducing the innocent, or at best, self- deluded.\\" (William R. Cumpiano on \\"Tap Tuning\\") And yet: plate tuning (voicing the instrument) is a significant part of violin-making culture—recently considerable advances have been made in the voicing of violins, so that modern violins by some makers are finally beginning to compete tonally with the best violins of the past (Stradivari, Guarneri, Amati, etc.). In fact, top violinists who traditionally played Stradivari, are now slowly beginning to use modern violins (this was rather uncommon up till recently).Debunking the Stradivarius myth by Geoffrey Norris; 10 February 2005; The TelegraphIn Direct Competition with Stradivari July 2006; goethe.desee last 4 paragraphs: A Violin's Value, and What to Pay the I.R.S. Fiddler by Richard Lezin Jones; 2 May 2004; New York Times Making an exact copy does not guarantee an instrument with sound qualities identical to the original. There is, however, some evidence that violinists may be under some similar self-delusion as regards the end result of these efforts on the finished violin. A Strad? Violinists Can't Tell Thus, while some consider that in this respect (and considerations of sound aesthetic), that guitar making today is still lagging behind professional violin-making, the scientific evidence is ambiguous, at best. In violin culture many good old master-violins have been analyzed for their sound qualities (e.g. Stradivari, or Guarneri are favoured by many people; though some consider these instruments as too \\"outwardly\\" loud, yet lacking the \\"inner\\" tonal qualities of say Amati). Plucked instruments from Musurgia universalis (1650)Athanasius Kircher: Page 477 (alternative) from Musurgia universalis sive ars magna consoni et dissoni - Tome 1 Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680) by Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680). In guitar making, it is in many cases more difficult to find similarly idealized instruments for a number of reasons: *There are multiple guitar traditions still currently active, each with its own ideals of tone, voicing, projection, etc. The flamenco tradition, for example, favors a very different kind of instrument construction from that of the concert classical guitar. And the ideal concert instrument for concerto performance with orchestra may not be the best choice for solo or salon- ensemble playing.George, D.; The Flamenco Guitar; Society of Spanish Studied; Madrid, Spain: 1969.Sloane, I.; Classic Guitar Construction; E.P. Dutton & Co., Inc.; New York: 1966. *There are not many guitars still in existence, from the period that some people consider the \\"Golden Age of Acoustics or instrument making\\" (17th and 18th centuries); e.g. there are only five guitars from Stradivari still known to existThe Sabionari Guitar, made in Cremona in 1679The Rawlins Stradivari Guitar, 1700 (National Music Museum; University of South Dakota)Guitar by A Stradivari (Ashmolean Museum) and luthiers and players are unlikely to have even heard them to judge their tonal quality. *As can be seen from violin making, there was a decrease in luthiers' tonal quality in the 19th century, when compared to the \\"Golden Age\\" (some people attribute this to luthiers' greater focus on the visible aspects, as opposed to the sound itselfInterview with Keith Hill ; original: Building Sound at 3 Quarks Daily). Also, in this time, the guitar went through many different outer shapes, and luthiers also had to cater for guitar demands from many amateurs at the time;Fernando Sor notes: \\"This skillfull artist [Lacote] is very frequently obliged to satisfy those who consider the instrument otherwise than I do, and make guitars on which it is impossible to play my music or any other that has the base and other parts of the harmony always proceeding correctly; but let a good instrument be ordered of him, leaving him at liberty to make it as he pleases, he will make one for me [...]\\" (Fernando Sor. \\"Méthode pour la Guitare\\" . Tecla.) so ultimately, for any given instrument from about 1800 to 1900, it could be one of high tonal quality, but might just as well be a mediocre instrument; or one with a design and tonal characteristic, that was later abandoned by the maker (though there are 19th- century guitar-makers such as Lacôte and Scherzer, who are generally considered as having built guitars with high tonal quality). *Most guitars today are still built using Spanish Torres or post-Torres fan-bracing. This has become the de facto classical guitar instrument today, but while being suitable for most modern Spanish repertoire, it is rather unsuitable for much of the earlier repertoire from the baroque, classical and romantic era. Neither guitarists, nor luthiers have a lot of knowledge on earlier design idioms, or sound aesthetics; though this is improving with an increasing interest in historically informed performance; and luthiers who do not only limit themselves and their interests to guitars (but also consider violin- making culture, lute-making culture (ladder-bracing!) and draw parallels). The de facto standard classical guitar today is the Spanish guitar: usually fan- braced and strong in fundamental. While fan-braced Spanish (Torres, post- Torres style) instruments coexisted with traditional central European ladder- braced (19th-century style) guitars at the beginning of the 20th century, the central European guitars eventually fell away. Some attribute this to the popularity of Segovia, considering him \\"the catalyst for change toward the Spanish design and the so-called 'modern' school in the 1920s and beyond\\".Early Classical Guitar and Early Romantic Guitar Time Period by earlyromanticguitar.com The styles of music performed on ladder-braced guitars, were becoming more and more unfashionable; and e.g. in Germany musicians were in part turning towards folk-style music (Schrammel-music and the Contraguitar), which only remained localized in Germany, etc. On the other hand, Segovia was concertizing around the world popularizing his Spanish guitar, as well as a new style of music in the 1920s: Spanish romantic-modern style, with guitar works by Moreno Torroba, de Falla, etc. In fact, Segovia's Santos Hernandez (Ramirez) guitar from 1912, has a slightly different sound aesthetic, than the earlier Torres design. While the Torres is a guitarnote in particular that Torres also built guitars that have a smaller body than today's modern classical guitars that some consider more appropriate to the salon style music of Tarrega, Arcas or Llobet (or arrangements of Granados, Albeniz), the later romantic-modern style of Moreno Torroba (whom Segovia met in 1918), Castelnuovo-Tedesco (whom Segovia met in 1932), etc.—combined with requirements of performing in large concert halls—was uniquely suited to Segovia's performance on the Santos Hernandez and later on the numerous Hauser guitars (1929, 1931, 1937, etc.)Hauser: 126 Years Of Manufacturing Guitars And Musical Instruments In Bavaria that he owned. Yet \\"Andrés Segovia presented the Spanish guitar as a versatile model for all playing styles\\", to the extent that still today, \\"many guitarists have tunnel-vision to the world of guitar, coming from the modern Segovia tradition of revisionism\\".Early Romantic Guitar Period Technique by earlyromanticguitar.com Torres and post-Torres style modern guitars with their fan-bracing, have a thick and strong tone: but they are considered too saturated in fundamental for earlier repertoire (Classical/Romantic: Carulli, Sor, Giuliani, Mertz, ...; Baroque: de Visee, ...; etc.). Cover art of L'art du Luthier by Auguste Tolbecque (1830–1919) Torres and post-Torres guitars have a strong thick sound (not to be confused with rich overtones, since these guitars are rather saturated in fundamental). *\\"With the change of music a stronger fundamental was demanded and the fan bracing system was approached. [...] the guitar tone has been changed from a transparent tone, rich in higher partials to a more \\"broad\\" tone with a strong fundamental.\\"Function, Construction and Quality of the Guitar; 1983 The sound aesthetic of early romantic guitars (such as Lacôte) on the other hand, has stronger overtones (yet without being starved in fundamental—which would again be undesirable). This stronger overtone presence is due to the ladder-bracing and soundboard design, and the particular voicing of the instrument. A comparison with lutes (ladder bracing) can be made, which also have strong overtones, which gives these instruments (lutes, early romantic guitars) a type of \\"inner\\" vulnerability, lacking in the modern guitars. (In fact there are people who claim that a performer's interpretational style is psychologically related to the instrument's aesthetic; and that this can even be observed in contemporary recordings, e.g., Bach's lute works as performed on luteTimothy Burris, Hopkinson Smith, etc.(with convincing expressive phrasing), versus the markedly different interpretations of these works on the modern classical guitar.John Williams (guitarist), Stephan Schmidt, etc. Alternately, the Spanish repertoire such as Moreno Torroba, would be completely unfitting, for a lute or early-guitar sound aesthetic.) Even amongst parlor guitar players, there are some that consider ladder bracing necessary, for achieving the desired \\"old-time sound\\". Ladder-braced Guitars and the Enduring Mysteries of the Old-Time Sound by Dan Margolies With an increase in interest in historically informed interpretation, there are more and more luthiers that are beginning to look at traditions of guitar building. Man drawing a lute by Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) Some contemporary luthiers suggest building historic instruments based not only on outer visual details, but based on acoustic principles from master luthiers of the 17th and 18th centuries, leaning towards and learning from the great makers (Stradivari, Amati, Ruckers, etc.).Acoustical Technology Training by Keith Hill Drawing a parallel to violin-making culture, and lutherie as a broader art, it might be interesting to deriving indications for the possible aims and ideals of \\"sound aesthetic in guitars\\" from other instruments (e.g., of the \\"Golden Age of Acoustics\\"), which would open up the possibility of tonally competing with luthiers from earlier periods, instead of only visually imitating and copying them.and—for 19th-century instruments—some of their substandard instruments, or instruments made for amateurs (see the Sor comment above)  See also  * Luthier * Lucien Gélas * Brahms guitar * Classical guitar strings * Classical guitar accessories  References  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_oxwnP1_68  External links  *Tonewood in the Making, Classical Guitar wood preparation *The Guitar Family Tree by Dennis Cinelli * A wiki on classical guitar making Category:Classical guitar Category:Lutherie ","title":"Classical guitar making"},{"id":"5818406","text":"Robert Rendall (1898–1967)Maggie Fergusson, George Mackay Brown: The Life, John Murray, 2006, p. 94, p. 200. was a poet, and amateur naturalist who spent most of his life in Kirkwall, Orkney.

She was the first non-white student to earn a bachelor's degree in music from Oberlin College, Ohio. She briefly taught at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, before becoming involved in international work with the YWCA in 1930. During a six-month trip through Asia in the mid 1930s, Thurman became the first African-American woman to have an audience with Mahatma Gandhi. The meeting with Gandhi inspired Thurman and her husband, theologian Howard Thurman, to promote non-violent resistance as a means of creating social change, bringing it to the attention of a young preacher, Martin Luther King Jr. While they did not actively protest during the Civil Rights Movement, they served as spiritual counselors to many on the front lines, and helped establish the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. Thurman played an active role in establishing international student organizations to help prevent foreign students feeling isolated while studying abroad. She organized one of the first international scholarship programs for African-American women. She studied racism and the effects of prejudice on various people throughout the world, making two round-the-world trips in her lifetime. She wrote books and newspaper articles to preserve black heritage, and initiated the publishing efforts of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) by founding the Aframerican Women's Journal. In addition to writing the second ever history of black Californians, in 1958 Thurman published a cookbook laced with historical information about black professional women at a time when African Americans had few civil rights. Recognizing that there was little academic interest in black women's history at the time, Thurman used the marketing ploy of food to report on the lives of black women who were not domestics. She participated in international peace and feminist conferences, and in 1945 attended the San Francisco Conference for the founding of the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation. Thurman also established museums such as the Museum of Afro-American History in Boston in 1963. Thurman and her husband retired in San Francisco in 1965. She worked with the San Francisco Public Library in 1969 to develop resources for black history of the American West. In 1979 she was honored with a Centennial Award at Spelman College, sharing the recognition with UNESCO director Herschelle Sullivan Challenor. After her husband's death in 1981, Thurman took over the management of the Howard Thurman Educational Trust, which funded research for literary, religious and scientific purposes and assisted in scholarships for black students. On her death in 1996, she left the couple's vast archives to numerous universities. Early years Oberlin CollegeSue Elvie Bailey was born on August 26, 1903, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to Reverend Isaac and Susie (née Ford) Bailey. She attended primary school at Nannie Burroughs' School for Girls in Washington, D.C. In 1920, she graduated from the college preparatory school, Spelman Seminary (now Spelman College) in Atlanta, Georgia. She continued her education at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, graduating in 1926 with bachelor's degrees in music and liberal arts, making her the first black student to earn a music degree from Oberlin. While there, Bailey developed a friendship with Louise Thompson, who would become a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance movement, and encouraged Langston Hughes, inventor of jazz poetry, to read poetry there. She traveled with a quintet giving concerts in Cleveland, New York, and Philadelphia, as well as London and Paris. Early career After graduating, Thurman took a post as a music teacher at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, but did not enjoy the work. One of the issues at Hampton was that her friend, Louise Thompson, also a teacher there, had written anonymously to W. E. B. Du Bois, co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), complaining about conditions at the college under the predominantly white administration. Although Bailey was suspected of writing the letter after Du Bois published it in the NAACP's journal The Crisis, she did not betray Thompson but instead invited Langston Hughes to Hampton for a poetry reading and moral support. Nevertheless, she left Hampton in 1930 to become a traveling National Secretary for the Student Division of the YWCA. She lectured throughout Europe and established the first World Fellowship Committee of the YWCA. On June 12, 1932, in the dining hall at Lincoln Academy, Kings Mountain, North Carolina, Bailey married Howard W. Thurman (1900–1981), a minister, who would become a social critic, writer and dean of several prominent US universities.\\"Nuptial Set for Thurman-Bailey\\" New York Amsterdam News (May 25, 1932): 4.\\"Y. W. C. A. Secretary Pretty Bride of Howard Thurneau\\" Chicago Defender (July 2, 1932): 6. At the time of their marriage, he was serving as Dean of Rankin Chapel and Professor of Systematic Theology at Howard University in Washington, D.C. Asia Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma GandhiIn 1935, the couple embarked upon a six-month trip through southern Asia, visiting Burma, Ceylon and India, culminating in a \\"Pilgrimage of Friendship\\" to the International Student Conference in India. Her husband led the American delegation, lecturing at more than forty universities, while Thurman herself was asked to meet with journalists and students, to discuss race relations and evaluate the parallels between the situation with Indians and the British and the African Americans and white Americans. Initially, Howard had turned down the opportunity and his wife was not included in the offer, but when the trip was finally agreed, both were participants. Thurman was not chosen simply as the wife of Howard Thurman but, in the words of the committee, because she was one of \\"four persons best able to do this particular job\\".Dixie & Eisenstadt (2011), p. 137. This decision was remarkable for the period given that black women were often invisible members of society and generally prohibited from authoritative roles in social welfare programs. Thurman lectured during the trip on negro women and the organizations to which they belonged, as well as internationalism and culture.Dixie & Eisenstadt (2011), p. 147. During their meeting with Rabindranath Tagore in Santiniketan she presented a paper \\"The History of Negro Music\\", though initially she had been reluctant to discuss slave music. She finally agreed only after Tagore and Gandhi explained that to Asian Christians, negro spirituals were deemed to express the profound faith of people even in bondage and seemed more authentic than western hymns. Thurman both sang and taught songs to local choirs.Dixie & Eisenstadt (2011), pp. 131, 153. She also commented on art, having acquired knowledge on the subject during an earlier trip to Mexico.Dixie & Eisenstadt (2011), p. 140. The couple met with Mahatma Gandhi, becoming the first African Americans to have an audience with him. When Thurman asked him to take his message to the United States, he demurred as his work in India and his personal quest there were not finished.Dixie & Eisenstadt (2011), p. 179. One important aspect of the meeting was a discussion of how non-violent resistance could be used as a means of creating social change. The meeting had a profound effect on the couple, changing the direction of their lives.Dixie & Eisenstadt (2011), p. 178. Though they would remain Christians, the meeting with Gandhi led them to consider establishing a church free of prejudice, transcending racial, social, economic and spiritual boundaries. After they returned to the United States, Howard received a letter from A. J. Muste on behalf of Alfred Fisk who was looking for someone to establish a church in San Francisco which crossed the racial and spiritual divides. Muste was hopeful that Rev. Thurman might know of a divinity student interested in the position. Instead, Howard decided to take up the challenge himself, securing a leave of absence in order to found the church. Thurman went with him bringing their two daughters, as she strongly believed in the cause. Mid-career Scholarly work and San Francisco Thurman established the Juliette Derricotte Scholarship in the late 1930s, which allowed African-American undergraduate women of high academic achievement to study and travel abroad. The first two recipients of the scholarship were Marian Banfield of Howard University and Anna V. Brown of Oberlin College. Banfield was a goddaughter of Howard Thurman. The following year the recipients of her scholarship were Elizabeth McCree from Boston, who attended Fisk University, and Margaret Bush Wilson of Talladega College. Mary McLeod Bethune Council House In 1940, Thurman founded the Aframerican Women's Journal, the first publishing vehicle of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), which she edited from 1940 until 1944. In 1941, an archive committee was formed to design a plan for collecting works about the achievements of African-American women. Though their plans focused primarily on written records and professional accomplishment and would thus reflect middle-class life, the committee initiated work on collecting historical records of black women. In 1944, Thurman became the committee's chair and her mother donated $1,000 toward creating the National Council of Negro Women's National Library, Archives, and Museum. On June 30, 1946, they held an archive drive, printing notices in newsletters and asking ministers, organizations, librarians and others to help them acquire photographs, books and mementos. They opened the first facility of the library at what is now the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site. In 1943, Thurman and her husband moved to San Francisco. She wrote several articles about their Asian trip, analyzing information, discussing their meeting with Gandhi and pressing for scholarship exchanges for negro students at Indian universities. It was from the Thurmans and their talks and writings that Martin Luther King Jr. learned of non- violent resistance as a means of social protest. By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. While her husband assumed the pastoral duties, Thurman organized forums and lectures for the members to learn about other peoples such as Native Americans, Africans, Asians and their cultures, covering everything from the Jews to the Navajos. \\"Pioneers of Negro Origin in California\\" by Sue Bailey ThurmanIn 1945, Thurman attended the San Francisco Conference for the founding of the United Nations as part of an unofficial delegation. The official African-American delegation included W. E. B. Du Bois, founder of the NAACP; Walter Francis White, Executive Secretary of the NAACP; and Mary McLeod Bethune founder of the National Council of Negro Women, but Bethune insisted on sending three additional observers from the NCNW, which included Thurman. After the event, Thurman published a report in the Chicago Defender on April 16, 1945, in which she questioned the limited role that people of color played in the proceedings and pointed out that the large populations of developing countries would become a force to be reckoned with. Thurman, as a representative for the NCNW, attended the Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, in 1947. The congress addressed many of the issues she supported such as women's rights, internationalism, and peace initiatives. In 1949, she led a delegation of members from the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples to Paris for the Fourth Plenary Session of UNESCO. After researching black history in California, Thurman wrote eight articles for the San Francisco Sun Reporter as part of a series entitled \\"Pioneers of Negro Origin in California\\". Using the same title, she published the articles in book form in 1952. It was the second history of black Californians published—the first being The Negro Trail Blazers of California by Delilah L. Beasley in 1919—and filled a gap caused by a lack of academic interest. History in America, at the time, was written about men and almost exclusively about white men. Neither of the women who wrote about the history of blacks in California was a native Californian. Boston Cookbook by Sue Bailey ThurmanIn 1953, Howard Thurman became the Dean of the Boston University School of Theology and, after ten years in California, the couple moved to Boston. The move was prompted by the desire to share their ideas of outreach and inclusion in a university setting, though they were aware that the arrival of the first black pastor in a white university would lead to difficulties. From the beginning, Thurman tried to create an inclusive environment, organizing monthly dinners for the Marsh Chapel Choir members and their friends.Thurman (1979), p. 185. Shortly after they arrived, a Japanese student committed suicide leaving a note that she had no friends. Not only was she not known well at the university, finding her family to notify them was difficult.Thurman (1979), p. 184. In response, Thurman organized the International Student Hostess Committee to keep international students from feeling isolated. By 1965, the committee was serving 500 international students at Boston University. The Thurmans were at times criticized by those who felt they should be visibly active in the Civil Rights Movement, but they believed their commitment was to addressing the spiritual needs of those who were visible, rather than participating in marches, protests and demonstrations. Among the papers of MLK were many letters from people such as Homer A. Jack, who co-founded the Congress of Racial Equality; Lillian Smith,Carson (1997), p. 170. author of the novel Strange Fruit; Glenn E. Smiley, national field secretary of Fellowship of Reconciliation,Carson (1997), p. 19. as well as King's own acknowledgement, which credited their spiritual guidance.Carson (1997), pp. 20, 177. Thurman continued her writing work in Boston. In 1958, she published The Historical Cookbook of the American Negro, which not only gave recipes but included black history. It retold stories of professional women and history to counter the belief that all black women were maids and domestics at a time when African Americans were excluded from basic civil rights. She recognized that in order to tell their history, a new approach was needed as there was no market for histories of the African Americans. In the preface to her book, she explained she was creating \\"palatable history\\", testifying to her shrewd marketing ability.Bower (2009), pp. 155–156. The African Meeting HouseDuring the 1960s, the Thurmans traveled widely, making various trips to study racial barriers that prohibited creation of community. A two-year sabbatical granted from Boston University made their travels possible. In 1962, they journeyed to Saskatchewan, Canada, to meet with tribal leaders about discrimination and in 1963, they embarked on a trip that included Nigeria, Israel, Hawaii, and California. In Nigeria, Howard Thurman lectured at the University of Ibadan. The couple's second round-the- world tour took them to Japan, the Philippines and Egypt. Boston African- American Heritage TrailIn 1963, Thurman founded the Museum of Afro-American History in Boston. Interested in history, she had discovered a settlement where free blacks had lived prior to the Civil War and their 1808 African Meeting House, which housed both Boston's first black church and the first segregated public school in the United States. The museum was created to save the site and provide a means to purchase other significant properties for preservation of African-American heritage in the area. Thurman also created a map of important African American historical sites in Boston with the help of her daughter, Anne Chiarenza, which she called \\"Negro Freedom Trails of Boston\\".\\"Mrs. Howard Thurman and Daughter: Team Charts Boston Freedom Trails\\", New Pittsburgh Courier (February 8, 1964): 11. The map highlighted twenty-two points of interest to black history within the city of Boston and was in part created to give black school children a sense that they were part of the history of the city. What is today known as the Black Heritage Trail was adapted from Thurman's original idea. While in Boston, in 1962, Thurman arranged for the sculptor Meta Warrick Fuller to create a commissioned \\"freedom plaque\\" for Livingstone College, of Salisbury, North Carolina. Bailey was an invited speaker at Livingstone in 1963 and at that time, in honor of United Nations Day, she donated a collection of dolls representing the member nations to the college. As far back as the 1930s, Thurman had collected ethnic dolls and given them to universities to promote understanding of cultural differences. In 1967, Livingstone awarded her with an honorary doctorate. San Francisco return Howard Thurman took retirement from Boston University in 1965 and the couple moved back to San Francisco. Thurman continued to pursue historic preservation. She worked with the San Francisco Public Library in 1969 to develop resources for black history of the American West.\\"History of Black America Launched at Library\\", Sun Reporter (June 14, 1969): 13. In the 1970s, the couple took a trip to the Pacific basin. In 1979 she was honored with a Centennial Award at Spelman College, sharing the recognition with UNESCO director Herschelle Sullivan Challenor.\\"Sue Bailey Thurman Cited\\", Sun Reporter (May 10, 1979): 21. After her husband's death, in 1981, Thurman took over the management of the Howard Thurman Educational Trust, which funded research for literary, religious and scientific purposes, endowed scholarships for black students and assisted charitable projects. Thurman was the mother of Anne Spencer ThurmanChiang, Harriet, \\"Anne Spencer Thurman\\", San Francisco Chronicle (June 4, 2001). and stepmother to Olive Thurman, her husband's daughter with his first wife.\\"Sue Thurman, Widow of Noted Theologian Howard Thurman\\", Los Angeles Sentinel (February 19, 1997): A21. Olive was the first wife of actor Victor Wong.Pulley, Michael. \\"The Last Days of Victor Wong\\", Sacramento News & Review (October 18, 2001). Thurman died on Christmas Day, 1996, at the San Francisco Zen Buddhist Hospice Center. Legacy After her death in 1996, she and Howard's vast archives were donated per their wishes to numerous universities. The largest collection of their documents is housed at Boston University. There are additional collections of their writings and works at Oberlin, Emory University and several other institutions like the National Council of Negro Women's archives in Washington, D.C and libraries in Arkansas named for her mother, Mrs. Susie Ford Bailey. The collection at Emory University includes the correspondence between the Thurmans and Mrs. Bailey, their personal libraries, and nearly one thousand photographs.

They are most widely read by young adult members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Titles There are twelve books in the series so far, with the thirteenth expected to be released soon: # Tennis Shoes among the Nephites (1989) # Gadiantons and the Silver Sword (1991) # The Feathered Serpent, Part One (1995) # The Feathered Serpent, Part Two (1996) # The Sacred Quest (formerly Tennis Shoes and the Seven Churches) (1997) # The Lost Scrolls (1998) # The Golden Crown (1999) # Warriors of Cumorah (2001) # Tower of Thunder (2003) # Kingdoms and Conquerors (2005) # Sorcerers and Seers (2010) # Drums of Desolation (2014) # Thorns of Glory: Part 1 (2020) General synopses The main characters of the series are Jim Hawkins, his sister Jenny Hawkins and Garth Plimpton, and later, their family members and friends. The novels involve people from modern times being transported to the past (at various times and locations described in the Standard Works) by means of a cave in Wyoming called \\"Frost Cave\\" (a real cave on the Spirit Mountain in Cody, Wyoming) in the United States. They feature both Book of Mormon and Bible themes. The first four books feature Jim Hawkins as the main character: first as a teenager, then as a young man in college, and in the third and fourth as a father of three children. *In book 1, Jim, his friend, Garth, and his younger sister, Jennifer, discover a time passage and spend two months in the time of the Nephites, at the time of Helaman and Captain Teancum around 67 B.C. *In book 2 (Gadiantons and the Silver Sword), a few inhabitants of Book of Mormon times travel to the present day in search of an evil sword, the Sword of Coriantimur, an infamous sword that continuously pops up in the lives of the family, throughout many of the books. It ends with Jim destroying it, in modern times. *Books 3 and 4 are two parts of the same story, when Jim Hawkins’ 16-year-old daughter, Melody, is kidnapped and Jim takes his other two children, Steffanie and Harry, with him to early first- century Book of Mormon times to rescue her. They are caught in the maelstrom of the Savior's death, while in the Americas and are there to witness Jesus Christ's coming to the people of the Americas after his resurrection. These are also the first books in the series to be written in somebody besides Jim's point of view. The 3rd and 4th books are written in dual person, about half in Jim's point of view and the rest in Melody's point of view. *Books 5–7 are another multi-part story, in which many members of Jim Hawkins' now-large family visit the land of Israel in late first-century Biblical times. :*Book 5 (The Sacred Quest) starts with Harry setting off with his step sister-to-be, Meagan, to Ancient Roman times to find Marcos, Melody's true love, and bring him back to her.

Heimerdinger said that tentative plans are for book 11 (Sorcerers and Seers) to be published in early fall in 2010, with volume 12 (more appropriately named Thorns of Glory) to be published 6–12 months after book 11. Frost Cave: Tennis Shoes Bombshell, Frost Cave Blog. November 22, 2009. Later in his official blog, Heimerdinger said that he had submitted the draft to his publisher, and he didn't know how far into the editing process they are.

In even later blog posts, Heimerdinger stated that the story had gotten even more complex and would culminate in combining the Tennis Shoes Adventure Series with his Passage to Zarahemla series. The volume uniting the two series was Passage's sequel, Escape From Zarahemla.

From U.S. Route 78 (US 78) in Leeds northeast to its terminus at the Georgia state line, SR 25 is the unsigned partner route of US 411\\\\. The southwestern terminus of SR 25 is at its intersection with SR 5 near Pine Hill in Wilcox County. Route description For the first of its route, SR 25 travels in a north–south direction. This highway begins by traveling through rural areas of west-central Alabama, connecting numerous small towns in the Black Belt region of Alabama. From Greensboro to its terminus, the orientation of SR 25 is in a general northeasterly–southwesterly direction. As this highway begins its northeastward path, it passes through rural areas, villages, and small towns, skirting the southern area of the Birmingham metropolitan area in Shelby County. The Double Oak Mountain area SR 25 traverses one of the higher peaks in the Birmingham area, Double Oak Mountain, connecting the Coosa and Cahaba River valleys. The roadway was constructed between 1914 and 1921 with support from Buffalo Rock founder Sidney Word Lee, who owned a 3,000-acre camp in Calcis. There is also a railroad line that travels parallel with SR 25 between Vincent and Leeds that tunnels through Double Oak Mountain below the highway. The stretch of SR 25 between Vincent and Leeds is popular with motorcyclists and other outdoor enthusiasts. This road is off limits to heavy trucks except for local deliveries due to a large number of sharp curves, blind entrances and exits, and a narrow, elevated roadway. The small communities of Vandiver, Sterrett, Calcis, and Dunnavant straddle the highway in this area.

He was the son of John I of Avesnes and Adelaide of Holland. From his father he received the stadholdership (government) of Zeeland. After he left Zeeland, he took up service with Charles II of Naples, who made him constable of the Kingdom of Naples. After his marriage with Isabella (16 September 1289), he had one daughter: Matilda. She succeeded him and her mother as princess. Florent settled with his wife in Morea. He negotiated the Treaty of Glarentsa with the Byzantine Empire in 1290. The situation for the Franks in Greece was hopeless by this time, however. The fall of the Angevins in Sicily meant that they were preoccupied with recouping territory there and few Western governments would send troops to defend Morea. Florent thus made peace and maintained it until 1293, when the Greeks retook Kalamata. Florent did not despair and did not reopen the war which had been ongoing until his succession: he instead sent an embassy in protest to Andronikos II Palaiologos, and the emperor returned Kalamata. In 1296, the Greeks retook the castle of Saint George in Arcadia. Florent besieged the castle, but died before it could be taken. Sources *Grousset, René.

It is located some 5 kilometers to the border with Poland. Population: . History Dobromyl was first mentioned in 1374, as a settlement founded by the Herburt family, upon request of Polish prince Władysław Opolczyk. In 1566 it was granted Magdeburg rights by the King Sigismund I the Old. Eighteen years later, Stanislaw Herburt built a castle here, the town also had a printing shop, where in 1612 the Annales seu cronici incliti regni Poloniae (The Annals of Jan Długosz) were published. Until the Partitions of Poland (1772), Dobromil was part of Przemyśl Land, Ruthenian Voivodeship. In the course of time, the branch of the Herburt family which resided in the town changed its name into Dobromilski. In 1772, Dobromil was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and until 1918 belonged to Austrian Galicia. After World War I, the town returned to Poland, and in the Second Polish Republic, was the seat of a county in Lwów Voivodeship. In 1921 its population was 5386. Following the Nazi and Soviet Invasion of Poland (September 1939), Dobromil was transferred to the Soviet Union. In June 1941, Soviet NKVD murdered here hundreds of prisoners (see NKVD prisoner massacres). Under German occupation, Dobromil was transferred to Przemyśl County, District of Kraków, General Government. Its Jewish population perished in The Holocaust, and on August 8, 1944 the town was seized by the Red Army. Currently, Dobromil belongs to Ukraine. The town has a local office of the Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land.

It is bordered by the river Vltava and Holešovice to the north, Vítkov hill and Žižkov to the south, New Town to the west and Libeň to the east. History The building of the Karlín district began in 1817, surrounding the Rosarium of the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star. The new settlement was named after the fourth wife of Emperor Francis I of Austria, Caroline Augusta of Bavaria. After the demolition of the city walls, the properties in Karlín were counted among the cheapest properties of Prague. For that reason, the number of industrial enterprises and dwellings grew very quickly in the area of \\"Rohan Island\\" (Rohanský ostrov). On January 1, 1922, Karlín was incorporated into Prague. At this time, the electrical engineering pioneer and industrialist František Křižík had great influence in the area. He established a streetcar line, which he then sold to the city. In the 1970s, traffic was rerouted onto the Rohanské nábřeží and the main arterial road was relieved. Since 1990 Karlín is connected to the Prague Metro and a pedestrian zone has been established. In 2002 Karlín was severely affected by the 100-year flood. It has since recovered and is becoming a new destination for businesses and residences. Notable buildings A notable building in Karlín is the Karlín Railway Bridge, which connects the Masaryk Railway Station to the Bubny station. The viaduct (also called Karlín viaduct) was named after Alois Negrelli, it is long and was put into operation on June 1, 1850. It is the longest bridge/viaduct on Czech territory. Other notable buildings include: * Theater Karlín (Karlínské hudební divadlo) * Hotel Olympik * House of the Invalid (Invalidovna) * Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius (Kostel Sv. Cyrila a Metoděje) * Czech Statistical Office (Český statistický úřad) * Palais Danubia Notable people * Lucia Moholy (born Schulz January 18, 1894, Karolinenthal bei Prag, died May 17, 1989, Zollikon, Switzerland) photographer, documentarist, publicist * Franz Baermann Steiner (born October 12, 1909, died November 27, 1952, Oxford, England) ethnologist, polymath, essayist, aphorist, and poet.

Events Ezra Pound mug shot * March 4 — Pablo Neruda elected a Communist party senator in Chile. He officially joins the Communist Party of Chile four months later. * April — Ilona Karmel and Henia Karmel, sisters from the Kraków Ghetto and together Polish Jewish prisoners of the Nazis, are on a forced death march when Germans in tanks crush them and then shove them, still living, into a mass grave. Soon after, a group of prisoners passes them, including a cousin of theirs. From their hiding place in her clothes, Henia Karmel rips out some poems she and her sister had written and hands them to her cousin to give to her husband, Leon, back in Kraków. The cousin delivers the poems, and the sisters are saved by a nearby farmer who takes them to a hospital. Henia writes in 1947, \\"these poems are real, not just scribblings.[they] came about when I was still creating myself, experiencing the pain of separation. How I could have survived, you might ask? If so, sir, you know nothing of life. It lasted, that's all.\\" Henia writes in her poem, \\"Snapshots\\": \\"My name is Number 906. / And guess what?

Cited in Tim Redman, Ezra Pound and Italian Fascism, Cambridge University Press, , 1991, p. 274 On May 5, he turns himself in to U.S. forces. He is incarcerated in a United States Army detention camp outside Pisa, spending 25 days in an open cage before being given a tent. Here he appears to have suffered a nervous breakdown. While in the camp he drafts the Pisan Cantos, a section of the work in progress which marks a shift in Pound's work, being a meditation on his own and Europe's ruin and on his place in the natural world. The Pisan Cantos wins the first Bollingen Prize from the Library of Congress in 1948. * May 8 — Victory in Europe Day: Edmund Blunden writes the poem \\"V Day\\" to mark the occasion; it will not be published until the 75th anniversary. * June — Australia's most celebrated literary hoax takes place when Angry Penguins is published with poems by the fictional Ern Malley. Poets James McAuley and Harold Stewart created the poems from lines of other published work and then sent them as the purported work of a recently deceased poet. The hoax is played on Max Harris, at this time a 22-year-old avant garde poet and critic who had started the modernist magazine, Angry Penguins. Harris and his circle of literary friends agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great merit had come to light in suburban Australia. The Autumn 1944 edition of the magazine with the poems comes out in mid-1945 due to wartime printing delays. An Australian newspaper uncovers the hoax within weeks. McAuley and Stewart loved early Modernist poets but despise later modernism and especially the well-funded Angry Penguins and are jealous of Harris's precocious success. * June 7 — Benjamin Britten's opera Peter Grimes, based on George Crabbe's The Borough, is first performed. * Two small Canadian literary magazines, Preview and First Statement (each founded separately in 1942) combine to form Northern Review (which lasts until 1956).Roberts, Neil, editor, A Companion to Twentieth-century Poetry, Part III, Chapter 3, \\"Canadian Poetry\\", by Cynthia Messenger, Blackwell Publishing, 2003, , retrieved via Google Books, January 3, 2009 * Kyk-over-al magazine founded in Guyana.\\"Selected Timeline of Anglophone Caribbean Poetry\\" in Williams, Emily Allen, Anglophone Caribbean Poetry, 1970–2001: An Annotated Bibliography, page xvii and following pages, Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, , retrieved via Google Books, February 7, 2009 * Vladimir Nabokov becomes a naturalized citizen of the United States.

He succeeded his father, Frederick I. Thomas II, Marquess of Saluzzo His mother Margarete de La Tour du Pin, a daughter of Humbert I de La Tour du Pin, Dauphin de Viennois. His succession was disputed by his uncle Manfred. The ensuing war was part of the wider Guelf–Ghibelline conflict. Thomas, who had married a Visconti, was a Ghibelline and Manfred a Guelf with the support of the Angevin King Robert of Naples. Robert therefore, to reduce Ghibelline (and Visconti) power in the north, advanced on Saluzzo and besieged it. He succeeded in taking it and sacking it, setting the city on fire and imprisoning Thomas, who had to pay a ransom. The whole dramatic event is recorded by Silvio Pellico. In August 1347, he joined John II, Marquess of Montferrat and Humbert II of Viennois as they attacked Savoy and conquered the Angevin lands in northern Italy after the death of Robert. The 1348 treaty which resolved this war left none of the participants satisfied. Thomas now owed allegiance to Milan, as well as his prior allegiance to Savoy. Thomas was eventually succeeded by his son Frederick II. Marriage and children Thomas married Ricciarda Visconti. She was a daughter of Galeazzo I Visconti, Lord of Milan and Beatrice d'Este. Beatrice was a daughter of Obizzo II d'Este by either his first wife Giacoma Fieschi or his second wife Constanza della Scala.

During his reign, he came into conflict with the city of Emden. Edzard was a staunch Lutheran while the city of Emden was mostly Calvinistic. In 1595 Emden revolted and, after an intercession by the Calvinistic Dutch Republic, Edzard was forced to accept a large degree of independence from Emden.  Life  Edzard II had a dispute with his dominant mother, Anna. She had abolished his right of primogeniture, in an attempt to curb the influence of the Swedish royal family. She decreed that Edzard should rule East Frisia jointly with his younger brothers Johan and Christopher. When Christopher died early, Edzard ran into a strong and almost hateful rivalry with his brother Johan II. The power struggle between two increasingly hamstrung their government. After Johan died in 1591, Edzard became the sole ruler, but his authority had been severely hit by the ongoing conflict. At the request of the Estates, Edzard founded the High Court in Aurich in 1593. In 1595, the city of Emden revolted. In the course of this Emden Revolution, the Cirksena family were driven out of Emden. Under pressure from the Dutch States General, Edzard signed on 5 July 1595 the Treaty of Delfzijl, which gave Emden a large degree of independence. During Edzard's reign, the Counts of East Frisia definitively lost the Lordship of Jever. Maria of Jever, the last baroness, died and left her territory to the Counts of Oldenburg. Edzard died on 1 March 1599. The Great Church at Emden refused to allow him to be buried in the Cirksena family vault, because he was a Lutheran and it was a Reformed church. He was buried on 13 May 1599 in the St. Lambert Church in Aurich. He was the first member of the Cirksena family to be buried there. However, all later family members were buried in this church, until the family died out in 1744.  Marriage and issue  Married to Katarina Vasa, daughter of King Gustav I of Sweden, on October 1, 1559 in Stockholm. He was the only ruler of East Frisia who ever married a princess. Through this marriage, the Swedish royal family sought to secure their influence on the North Sea coast.

He is reputed to have been the long-time lover of Wilhelmine of Baden, the Grand Duchess consort of Hesse, and the actual father by her of the Empress consort Maria Alexandrovna of Russia and Prince Alexander of Hesse, ancestors of modern royalty in Bulgaria, Germany, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Life He became the stable master of Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse, a major general and a knight in the Order of Malta. It is also alleged that he was the biological father of four of the children of his employer's wife and, therefore, a likely ancestor of Felipe VI of Spain and Charles, Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the throne of the United Kingdom. He may also be a direct-line ancestor of several royal pretenders: Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia, King Michael of Romania and Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia, heir to the throne of the German Empire which collapsed at the end of World War I. Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse, bought the property of Heiligenberg near Jugenheim in 1820, installing his chamberlain, Senarclens de Grancy, there. From the year of that acquisition Grand Duchess Wilhelmine no longer lived with her consort, with whom she had not had any children since 1809, and proceeded to give birth four times between 1821 and 1824. Senarclens's identity as the father of the later children of Wilhelmine was strongly suspected: correspondence asserting or repeating the allegation was recorded by several government ministers, ambassadors and sovereigns, including Tsar Nicholas I and Queen Victoria. By Wilhelmina, Senarclens de Grancy is believed to have fathered four children during her marriage to Grand Duke Louis: * Princess Amalia Elisabeth Luise Karoline Friederike Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt (20 May 1821 - 27 May 1826). * Stillborn daughter (7 June 1822). * Prince Alexander Ludwig Georg Friedrich Emil of Hesse and by Rhine (15 July 1823 - 15 December 1888), morganatically married to Countess Julie Hauke, she and their children being elevated to the title of princess/prince of Battenberg. * Princess Maximiliane Wilhelmine Auguste Sophie Marie of Hesse and by Rhine (8 August 1824 - 3 June 1880); the future Empress consort of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. Alexander and Marie were the only two to survive childhood and remained legally the children of Wilhelmina's husband, Grand Duke Louis II, who neither denied paternity nor sought to disinherit any of the children to whom his wife gave birth, even after the death of the Grand Duchess. Alexander and Marie are ancestors of the last emperors of Russia, as well as the princely Battenbergs (now known as the Mountbattens). In 1836, the same year of Grand Duchess Wilhelmine's death, he married Luise Wilhelmine Camille von Otting und Fünfstetten (24 May 1810 – 1876), said to be a morganatic descendant of the Counts Palatine of Zweïbrucken and the Margraves of Baden-Durlach, by whom he had three sons and three daughters:http://geneall.net/en/name/2091755/auguste-louis-de- senarclens-de- grancy/http://geneagraphie.com/getperson.php?personID=I671385&tree;=1http://gw.geneanet.org/cvpolier?lang=en&p;=august+ludwig&n;=von+senarclens+grancy * Baroness Wilhelmine von Senarclens de Grancy (11 August 1837 - 1912), unmarried. * Baron Ludwig von Senarclens de Grancy (9 June 1839 - 2 February 1910), married Amalie Barbara, Baroness Löw von und zu Steinfurth. * Baroness Marie Wilhelmine von Senarclens de Grancy (9 June 1840 - 5 July 1908), married Ludwig Heinrich von Hesse. * Baron Henri Adolphe Louis von Senarclens de Grancy (1845 - died young). * Baron Albert Ludwig Friedrich von Senarclens de Grancy (9 February 1847 - 20 January 1901), married his kinswoman Antoinette von Senarclens de Grancy. * Baroness Constance von Senarclens de Grancy (11 September 1852 - 9 March 1933), married Karl von Oertzen.

It is a subsidiary of Stagecoach. History Devon General A preserved Devon General Leyland Atlantean and modern Stagecoach Alexander ALX400 bodied Dennis Trident 2 (Exeter depot, June 2014) The Devon General Omnibus and Touring Company commenced operations in South Devon in 1919 with two bus routes from Exeter to Torquay. In 1922, Torquay Tramways purchased the company, although it was operated as a subsidiary of the National Electric Construction Company (NECC) and the tramway company's motor buses were transferred to Devon General. In 1931, the NECC became a part of the British Electric Traction Group. British Electric Traction's bus operations, including Devon General, became part of the National Bus Company when it was formed in 1969. In April 1970, the Exeter City Council's buses and routes were transferred to Devon General but the city's unusual use of route letters (as opposed to numbers) continued. In January 1971, the bus operations of Devon General were transferred to neighbouring Western National but the Devon General name was retained as a brand. In January 1983, Western National was split into four new companies, one of which was Devon General LimitedCompanies House extract company no 1673326 Devon General Limited that operated in south and east Devon as the old Devon General had done, but the Tiverton area services became part of North Devon.Companies House extract company no 1662631 North Devon Limited On 19 August 1986, Devon General became the first National Bus Company subsidiary to be privatised under the Transport Act 1985 being sold in a management buy out led by managing director Harry Blundred. An experimental high-frequency service using 22 minibuses was introduced in Exeter on 27 February 1984. By the time the company was privatised the minibus fleet had expanded with more than 200 Ford Transits and Ivecos in service, comprising over half the fleet. By the end of 1990, all regular services had been converted to minibus operation using a mixture of 16 and 24 seat vehicles. In 1992, the operations in Torbay and Newton Abbot were split off to a new Bayline company,Companies House extract company no 2118422 Bayline Limited while Devon General continued to operate in the Exeter area. Both companies were sold to Stagecoach in 1996, and in 2003 was rebranded Stagecoach Devon. Stagecoach Devon Stagecoach introduced low floor buses to the Torbay area with vehicles such as this Volvo B6LE (preserved vehicle, 2011) Alexander ALX400 bodied Dennis Trident 2 with North Devon Wave branding (Bideford, August 2011) Alexander ALX400 bodied Dennis Trident 2 operating on the former First Group route 93 (Kingsbridge, September 2015) During the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of the old fleet of buses were refurbished. Minibuses have been replaced with a mixture of midibuses, double deckers, and coaches, the most recent buses being Optare Solos, Alexander Dennis Pointer bodied Dennis Dart SLFs, Dennis Trident 2s and Alexander Dennis Enviro400s, all Stagecoach Group standard bus types. Stagecoach injected some new buses after acquisition of the company including Volvo B6LEs (14), Volvo B10M coaches (6), Volvo B10M buses (7), Dennis Javelins (4) and Mercedes-Benz Varios (16) after which there were few more for some years. Stagecoach Devon's fleet was mostly cascades from other areas. Between 1997 and 2004, only six new buses entered the fleet (three Alexander ALX200s for route 56 and three Dennis Tridents for route 373 in January 2003). Since then, the company has invested heavily in new vehicles, taking on a large fleet of Dennis Tridents (21 initially) for the busy route 12 in Torbay and the new route 54 Culm Valley Connect services (8 Tridents), it was also the launch customer for the Optare Solo Slimline, with 30 for Exeter city routes. Later in 2006, Exeter services received new Alexander Dennis Pointers for city services A and H, displacing Solos onto other routes. The company faced an industrial stoppage in July 2003 that led to cutbacks in the period afterwards. The company recovered strongly positing excellent growth in passengers and a steadily improving financial position underlined by innovative marketing, engaging in community activities, promotions including telemarketing. The company has also been a significant winner in the 'Kickstart competition', a directly government funded initiative to provide and upgrade to services which should eventually become self-supporting. Stagecoach Devon won three such bids, the Culm Valley connect services in September 2004, the 12A South Devon College services in September 2005, and the upgrade of Exeter City services in spring 2006. The company won tenders outside the traditional boundaries of the Devon General area and has had buses based in Yeovil since 2005, and from September 2006 opened depots at Barnstaple, Bude and Torrington after gaining tenders in the County Council tender round. The introduction of free concessionary fares to the disabled and those over 60 and the inherent organic growth in the business put considerable capacity demands on the company, which is switched to double-deck buses on many routes to cope, with older double-deckers being transferred from other Stagecoach operations. The company has campaigned for a better settlement on the fare concessions and the reimbursement from the scheme is said to be amongst the weakest in the country whilst demand is amongst the strongest. In six months concessionary demand increased 90% over the previous year. In June 2008, Alexander Dennis Enviro400 buses were purchased for use on the new go2 service from Exeter to Newton Abbot. In August 2008, Stagecoach announced a trial of a ferry from Torquay to Brixham using a 138-seat catamaran. Stagecoach released a leaflet explaining the details of the trial between 29 August and 27 September 2008.

Changes to routes in Exeter in September 2007 caused complaints from residents of the affected areas. The following month, Devon County Council announced that it would fund Stagecoach until March 2008 to restore some of these services after the council received more than 80 letters from passengers.

Stagecoach acquired their depot in Plymouth along with its outstations in Tavistock and Dartmouth, and operated a smaller network of routes that First had withdrawn. The First park and ride fleet initially remained at Plymouth on hire to Stagecoach along with buses transferred from Stagecoach Manchester and Stagecoach East Kent as well as other locations. This was a temporary solution until 22 Alexander Dennis Enviro400 MMCs and 5 Alexander Dennis Enviro200 MMCs could be delivered. The South West Falcon service was launched in February 2016. This is an limited stop coach service between Plymouth and Bristol which serves places such as Exeter, Taunton and Bristol Airport. .

His first appearance was in Alpha Flight #1. Publication history Flashback first appeared in Alpha Flight #1 (August 1983), and was created by John Byrne. He was unidentified in his first appearance, and was not named until Alpha Flight #11. Fictional character biography Gardner Monroe was born in Manitoba Province, Canada. Possessing the mutant ability to summon duplicates of himself from future timelines, Monroe was recruited by Department H, a branch of Canada's Department of National Defence concerned with training superhumans as government agents. Given the code-name Flashback, Monroe progressed through the initial Gamma Flight training program and had advanced to the second-tier Beta Flight team before Department H as a whole was shut down by the Canadian government; while the primary team, Alpha Flight, continued to operate without government support, the members of Gamma and Beta Flights were simply dismissed. Some time later, Flashback was recruited,Alpha Flight vol. 1 #7, February 1984 along with other disenfranchised members of Gamma and Beta, by Jerry Jaxon and his robot assistant Delphine Courtney into Omega Flight, a team put together to gain revenge on Department H's founder, James MacDonald Hudson, and the Alpha Flight team that he led as Guardian.Alpha Flight vol. 1 #11, June 1984 Though Omega Flight was defeated, the encounter ended with Guardian's apparent death.Alpha Flight vol. 1 #12, July 1984 During Alpha Flight's second encounter with Omega Flight, one of Flashback's duplicates was killed by a construct created by Madison Jeffries after Courtney used it as a shield against the construct's attack, causing all other duplicates present to vanish. Upon the realization that his duplicate's death would mean his death in the future, Flashback fell to his knees in shock while Jeffries dealt with the remaining Omegans and destroyed Courtney. Flashback and his teammates were left under guard by Jeffries' construct until the police arrived to apprehend them.Alpha Flight vol. 1 #28, November 1985 Some years later Alpha Flight was informed that Flashback had disappeared from prison. Alpha Flight took this to mean that Flashback's past had finally caught up with him. This was not to be, as years later Flashback resurfaced. Having sworn off his powers, he tried to destroy his costume, reasoning that if he didn't have his costume he couldn't be sent back to his death. Then one morning Flashback woke up to discover his costume hanging in the bathroom. This version however had the same design as the ones worn by his duplicates. Flashback soon discovered that no matter what he did, he kept on finding himself in the duplicate suit. In desperation, Flashback contacted Sasquatch and his Alpha Flight team and convinced them to help him. The Alpha Flight member Nemesis came to the conclusion that she would have to kill him with her enchanted blade in order to stop him from dying in the future. After much trial and error Alpha Flight managed to keep Flashback from being sent to the past. Powers and abilities Flashback is a mutant with the psionic ability to cause temporal counterparts of himself from alternate future timelines to appear in the present and to control them. Each duplicate appears in a reverse-color version of the original Flashback's costume. These counterparts vanish whenever Flashback is rendered unconscious; lacking any apparent skill in combat or tactics (relying solely on his advantage in numbers), this makes Flashback a comparatively easy foe to defeat, as he tends to stand back from actual combat and focus solely on the activities of his duplicates, to the exclusion of all else. Other versions Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse, Flashback was targeted by Apocalypse's purge of chrono-variant mutants. His fate is unknown, as Apocalypse's databases listed him as missing in action.

The center works closely with, and is an arm of, the National Fire and Aviation Executive Board (NFAEB), which provides unified guidance for fire agencies in the U.S., and handbooks and guidelines to provide common procedures. It was created to implement the Federal Wildland Fire Management Act Policy. The NFAEB has created the Federal Fire Policy Directives Task Group, which coordinates with state agencies in order to implement cooperative agreements.Federal Fire Policy Directives Task Group Charter. National Interagency Fire Center. Retrieved May 13, 2008. The center's primary mission is the complex interagency co-ordination of wildland firefighting resources in the U.S. Although NIFC was initially founded to manage firefighting resources throughout the western states, the center is now designated as an \\"all-risk\\" co-ordination center, and as such provides support in response to other emergencies such as floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes for the United States at large; accordingly it also contributes to the national preparedness level.  History  The National Interagency Fire Center began in 1965 as the Boise Interagency Fire Center; its name was changed in 1993 to more accurately reflect its national mission. Originally the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and National Weather Service saw the need to work together to reduce service duplication, cut costs, and coordinate national fire planning and operations. The National Park Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs joined BIFC in the mid 1970s. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service joined in 1979. The Wildland Firefighters National Monument was dedicated on May 25, 2000, and is on the grounds of the NIFC's headquarters Escalation of fire coordination Tier 3 - Local Control Any wildland fire is perforce initially managed by the local agency which has the fire protection responsibility in its jurisdiction. Engines, ground crews, hotshots, smokejumpers, helicopters with water buckets, and airtankers may all be used for initial suppression. Various local agencies may work together, sharing personnel and equipment, to fight both new fires and those not contained by the initial response. Tier 2 - Geographic Area Coordination Center(s) The United States is divided into 11 geographic areas. If a wildland fire grows to the point where local personnel and equipment are insufficient, the responsible agency contacts the Geographic Area Coordination Center (GACC) for help. The GACC will dispatch a Type 2 Incident Management Team (IMT) and they will locate and dispatch additional firefighters and support personnel throughout the geographic area at risk. When the emergency exceeds the resources of the GACC, a call is then made to the National Interagency Coordination Center at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). Tier 1 - National Interagency Coordination Center NIFC is the home of the National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC). If a fire exceeds the level of local control and all the resources in its geographic area, NICC will dispatch a type 1 Incident Management Team and additional national resources from multiple agencies as required. National Multi-Agency Coordination Group The National Multi-Agency Coordination Group (NMAC or MAC) also resides at the NIFC; it is used to allocate and prioritize personnel and equipment if several simultaneous national emergencies are straining the support system. MAC also establishes the National Preparedness Levels throughout the calendar year in order to help assure that firefighting resources are ready and able to respond to probable new incidents (a form of risk management). Preparedness Levels are dictated by burning conditions, fire activity, and (especially) resource availability.

It belongs to the same family as the closely related genus Palaelodus, but was more specialized. Megapaloelodus represents a specialization of the lifestyle of Palaelodus, which apparently was more like a wading duck in behavior – long-legged but still able to swim with ease, possibly even diving a lot – than a modern flamingo. Megapaloelodus, on the other hand, seems to have been evolved into a true wading bird, convergent with the true flamingos.  Description  Its \\"knee\\" (actually ankle) joints had evolved to a peculiar form not known from modern flamingos and only incipient in Palaelodus; the function of this character is not known but possibly it enabled the bird to \\"lock\\" its leg in standing position when asleep in shallow water, out of the reach of most terrestrial as well as aquatic predators. Megapaloelodus species were sized from equal to an average greater flamingo until 15 to 20% larger. Unfortunately, it is not known whether their bills were specialized for filter feeding as in the true flamingos, or whether they retained the less- specialized shape of Palaelodus which fed on small aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates. The Miocene species M. connectensconnectens, Latin for \\"connecting\\", as the first bones discovered seemed intermediate between those of Palaelodus and modern flamingos. is known from the Early Miocene of Bennett County, South Dakota; Rosebud Formation: late Arikareean, 23-19 mya and Hemingfordian Batesland Formation. The fossils comprise fragments of a femur and a tarsometatarsus), and from some bones of the early Late Miocene Temblor and Barstow Formations of San Bernardino County, California (c. 11 mya; UCLA 2303 & 2364). The latter may represent a distinct species due to the considerable difference in space and time between the two localities, but all these bones at least were from birds of similar size, about as large as a big greater flamingo. The Californian population probably inhabited freshwater or saline lagoons or shallow lakes. A later species, M. opsigonus, was found in the Clarendonian Juntura Formation at Juntura, Malheur County, Oregon. Whether the species M. goliathgoliath, after the biblical figure. belongs into this genus or into Palaelodus is not quite certain; it surpasses all forms in the latter genus in size, but is generally similar. It is the earliest representative of Megapaloelodus, living from the Late Oligocene to the Middle Miocene, and has been found in a wide range of Central European localities, from France to Southern Germany (Ringingen-Frontal 1) and on to the Czech Republic and Hungary; it dwelled in the wetlands created by the rerouting of rivers due to the beginning uplift of the Alps. Fossils referrable to this genus have also been found in the Huayquerian Ituzaingó Formation, Argentina. At least two additional undescribed species await description pending availability of more material. Fossils have also been found in the Almejas Formation of Baja California, Mexico.

The song chronicles an engagement in the English Channel on 17 June 1778 between the Arethusa and the French frigate, Belle Poule. It opens :Come all ye jolly sailors bold :Whose hearts are cast in honour's mould :While English glory I unfold :Hurrah for the Arethusa :She is a frigate tight and brave :As ever stemmed the dashing wave :Her men are staunch to their favorite launch :And when the foe shall meet our fire :Sooner than strike we'll all expire :On board of the Arethusa :'Twas with the spring fleet she went out :The English Channel to cruise about :When four French sail in show so stout :Bore down on the Arethusa When Sir Henry Wood wrote his Fantasia on British Sea Songs in 1905 a version of this song became the third movement.

The pale leaves show symptomatic discolouration, distinct from the healthy green leaves Root rot is a disease in plants, in which the roots of a plant rot and decay.  Symptoms and outcomes  Root rot is seen in both indoor plants, such as houseplants, and in outdoor plants such as trees. It is more commonly seen in indoor plants. Plants' roots are not typically visible as they are below the surface of the soil, so the symptoms of root rot are often apparent only when the disease is advanced. Roots of plants affected by root rot may turn from firm and white to black/brown and soft. Affected roots may also fall off the plant when touched. The leaves of affected plants may also wilt, become small or discolored. Affected plants may also look stunted due to poor growth, develop cankers or ooze sap. Prolonged root rot may lead to death of the plant. In extreme cases, plants affected by root rot may die within 10 days. Root rot is usually lethal although it is treatable. An affected plant will not normally survive, but may potentially be propagated.  Causes  Root rot is primarily caused by poor drainage of damp soil, overwatering or a poorly functioning root system. Prolonged exposure to excess water causes waterlogging, which interferes with aeration of the roots, leading to low oxygenation and decay. Planting in a dense soil, such as garden soil, can also lead to root rot. Rot can spread from affected roots to other ones. Excess or insufficient light and fertilizer can also increase the chance of a plant developing root rot. Aside from waterlogging, many cases of root rot are caused by pathogens, such as the water mold genus Phytophthora; particularly the species P. cinnamomi. Other commonly responsible pathogens include Pythium, Rhizoctonia, and Fusarium. Spores from root rot causing agents do contaminate other plants, but the rot cannot take hold unless there is adequate moisture. Spores are not only airborne, but are also carried by insects and other arthropods in the soil. The wet environment of waterlogged soil promotes the growth of these fungi, allowing them to cause the disease. Garden soil often contains spores of pathogens so it is not advised to be used as a potting medium for indoor house plants. Other causes of root rot include: *Armillaria, which cause white root rot disease and shoestring root rot *Rhododendron root rot *Texas root rot *Rosellinia necatrix, also known under its synonym Dematophora necatrix *Scytinostroma galactinum, also known under its synonym Corticium galactinum  Treatment and prevention  The most effective treatment for root rot is prevention such as destruction of affected plants. It is recommended that, in localised cases of root rot, the affected plant simply be destroyed and the surrounding soil replaced. Treatment options depend on the extent of the rot. To treat root rot, is recommended to replant the affected plant in fresh soil with good drainage to avoid standing water. It is also recommended to gently wash diseased roots and remove all brown, soft parts of the roots with a sterilized pair of scissors or a tool such as a pulaski for larger roots. Rapid treatment and replanting of root rot is imperative to stop the disease spreading to the rest of the affected plant or to other plants and to allow plants to form new roots. Chemical treatments, such as fungicides, chloropicrin and methyl bromide may also be used to limit progression of the disease but must be specific to the responsible pathogen. Some sources claim that cinnamon powder is an effective treatment for reducing spread of root rot, when applied to exposed tissue after removal of diseased tissue. Cinnamon is also claimed to act as a potential fungicide. To prevent recurrence and progression of root rot, it is recommended to water plants only when the soil becomes dry, and to plant the plant in a well-drained pot. It is recommended that pots used for diseased plants should be sterilized with bleach to kill potential spores. This allows the plant to drain properly and prevents fungal spores affecting the plant. It is recommended to keep the soil around the plant as dry as possible and to pry back the soil to allow proper aeration. Hydroponics Root rot can occur in hydroponic applications, if the water is not properly aerated. Aeration is usually accomplished by use of an air pump, air stones, air diffusers and by adjustment of the frequency and length of watering cycles where applicable. Hydroponic air pumps function in much the same way as aquarium pumps, which are used for the same purpose. Root rot and other problems associated with poor water aeration were principal reasons for the development of aeroponics.

Little is known of his life, except from an account by Daniel Defoe, which is often considered unreliable, the report on his execution, and an account by Mr. Alan Fea, descendant of his captor, published in 1912, almost two centuries after his death. Early life Gow was probably born in Wick, Caithness, to William Gow, a merchant, and Margaret Calder. He was raised in Stromness, Orkney, where he went to school and learned to sail a ship. Pirate Prior to August 1724 he crewed a voyage from London to Lisbon and back, during which he plotted to seize control of the vessel. He failed to attract sufficient numbers, however, and the effort went nowhere. In London, word spread about the attempt, so Gow fled to Amsterdam, where he joined the Santa Cruz-bound Caroline as second mate.Samuel Menefee, \\"Gow, John\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. After several months' layover in Santa Cruz, on 3 November 1724 the Caroline departed for Genoa, Italy, with a cargo of beeswax, leather, and woolens. The shipboard climate, however, was troubled. There were complaints about the food on board the ship, and Freneau, the captain of the Caroline, was accused of treating the other crewmen of the vessel improperly. Grousing of short allowance, the crewmen of the Caroline started to disobey some of the captain's orders. The captain, realising that his orders were being disobeyed, consulted his mate. The two men agreed to stash some small arms in the cabin so they could defend themselves in case of mutiny. Unfortunately for the captain, two of the conspirators on the upper deck overheard the conversation. Not realising that Gow was the ring leader of the attempted mutiny, Freneau ordered Gow to prepare arms to defend the crew. Upon hearing this, the mutineers decided to act that night. At ten p.m., after half the ship's company had retired following evening prayer, shots echoed across the deck. Told that someone had fallen overboard, Freneau ran to the rail, where he was stabbed in the neck and shot twice in the stomach by Gow, then thrown overboard by the other conspirators. Still alive, he managed to clutch a rope dangling from the side of the ship, but when the conspirators realised this, they cut the rope and he tumbled into the sea. The next morning, the remainder of the crew was given the option of following their captain or joining the mutineers. Accounts indicate that they all accepted their former position. The ship was renamed Revenge. Over the next few weeks the Revenge began attacking British ships in the area, starting with the Delight (12 November) and the Sarah (21 November). The crews were usually set adrift, though some deemed useful were given the option of joining Gow's crew. Over the next few months, Gow attacked several other ships plying the region. Capture After a successful career as a pirate off the Iberian Peninsula, Gow decided to return to the Orkney Islands. He was running low on supplies, and the authorities were on his trail. Arriving in early 1725, he adopted the name Mr. Smith for himself, and renamed his vessel the George, and passed as a wealthy trader, even courting a Miss Gordon. He was eventually recognised by a merchant passing through the islands, and his true identity was revealed.A summary of Scott's The Pirate and its sources According to other accounts, some of his prisoners escaped there and notified the authorities.Famous Pirates. Rather than surrender, Gow and his men successfully raided the Hall of Clestrain on 10 February 1725, but when they attempted to attack another remote mansion, they ran aground on the Calf of Eday, where they were captured. Death The Execution Dock, where John Gow's adventures came to an end According to the Newgate Calendar, Gow was slow to die when he hanged. To relieve his pain, some of his friends pulled at his legs, but this just broke the rope, causing him to tumble to the ground, from where he was gathered up and hanged again. After his death, his body (along with those of his crew) was left in the River Thames. The bodies were then tarred and suspended on the riverbank, as a warning to other would-be pirates. He was tried alongside pirate Brigstock Weaver, whose crimes were unrelated to Gow's. While Gow was hanged for his piracies, Weaver was reprieved and soon pardoned. In literature Daniel Defoe wrote a fictional account, The Pirate Gow. Gow also served as the model for Captain Cleveland in Sir Walter Scott's novel The Pirate.Warren S. Walker, \\"A 'Scottish Cooper' for an 'American Scott'\\", 537; John Robert Moore, \\"Defoe and Scott,\\" 729. Gow was also featured in some of the writings of George Mackay Brown. In the late nineteenth century Gilbert and Sullivan adapted the story for their comical operetta The Pirates of Penzance, changing the setting from Orkney to the coast of Cornwall in the reign of Queen Victoria. The factual account of the capture of Gow was featured in the book The Real Captain Cleveland by a distant relative of the pirate catcher named Allan FEA (1860-1956), and published by Secker, London, in 1912.

It lies at the top of the Måbødalen valley in the municipality of Eidfjord, in Vestland county. It is located near Norwegian National Road 7, which connects Oslo with Bergen. It has a total drop of , and a major drop of . It is perhaps the most famous in the country and a major tourist attraction on the way down from Hardangervidda to Hardangerfjord. Accessed on 2020-02-22. The name Vøringsfossen () is derived from the verb vyrða (English: esteem, revere). The last element fossen, the definite form of foss (waterfall), is a later addition. History The waterfall was hardly known by anyone other than locals until 1821. In that year professor Christopher Hansteen, who was on his way to the Hardangervidda plateau to make astronomical observations, estimated the height of the waterfall to be about by throwing stones down from the edge and measuring the time they took to fall with his pocket watch. In 1893 it was measured with a string, and the real height was revealed to be . In 1880 Ola Garen decided to build a hotel at top of the waterfall. The only way up there was a path with 1,500 stairs up Måbøbjerget together with a bridle path that had been built in 1872 to carry English tourists to the waterfall. In 1891 a new road with tunnels was built along Eidfjordvandet, and in the same year the Fossli Hotel was finished, designed in Art Nouveau style by architect Frederik Konow Lund. All materials for the construction had to be carried on horseback from Eidfjord up to the top of the hill. Around the year 1900 large cruise ships began to visit Eidfjord, and from there passengers were transported by horse and wagon up the valley. The composer Edvard Grieg had a log cabin nearby and was a frequent visitor to the falls.

It is composed of 4 squadrons, which provide the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing and II Marine Expeditionary Force with complete airfield operation services (less air traffic control), engineer and transportation support, medical assistance, food services, security support, and other direct combat and combat service support to Aviation Combat elements. Mission Command and control all functions of Aviation Ground Support (AGS) within the Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW), in garrison or deployed as part of the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Subordinate units * Marine Wing Support Squadron 271 * Marine Wing Support Squadron 272 * Marine Wing Support Detachment 273 * Marine Wing Support Squadron 274 History Marine Wing Service Group 27 was activated on July 1, 1953, and redesignated as Marine Wing Support Group 27 on April 1, 1967. The Support Group was established after years of staff study, several reorganizations and extensive planning to determine the organization needed to best meet its unique mission. That mission encompasses most of the capabilities needed to establish and operate airfields and aviation forward sites in an expeditionary environment. In earlier years, Marine Wing Support Group 27 (MWSG-27) was composed of three squadrons and a sub unit: Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron (H&MS-27;), VMGR-252, Wing Equipment and Repair Squadron (WERS-27), and sub-unit 1 (SU-1) of Marine Weapons Unit 2 (MWWU-2). With the implementation of the Marine Corps Combat Service Support Concept, the Group ceased all aviation functions on April 20, 1976. This included the separation of VMGR-252 from the Group and the detachment of SU-1, MWWU-2. On May 13, 1976, Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 27 and Wing Equipment Repair Squadron 27 were redesignated Headquarters and Ground Maintenance Squadron 27 and Wing Transport Squadron 27(WTS-27) respectively. On that same date Wing Engineer Squadron 27 (WES-27) was activated. Detachments (Dets) \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", were activated at MCAS New River and MCAS Beaufort to provide support service at those stations. Det \\"A\\" was activated on September 10, 1976; Det \\"B\\" was activated on October 27, 1976. MWSG-27 was then composed of three squadrons and two detachments: H&MS-27;, WES-27, WTS-27, and Dets \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". During December 1979 through January 1980, MWSG-27 once again reorganized under the Service Support concept at which time H&MS-27; was redesignated as Headquarters Squadron 27 (HQS-27). On January 1, 1986, MWSG-27 reorganized in to its present configuration with the implementation of the Marine Wing Support Squadron (MWSS) concept. The reorganization required MWSG-27 to consolidate personnel and equipment from the three squadrons and two detachments with the five Marine Air Base Squadrons (MABS) located at four different geographic airfields. HQS-27 was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron 27 (H&HS-27;), WTS-27 with MABS elements became MWSS-271, Det \\"A\\" with MABS elements redesignated as MWSS-272, Det \\"B\\" with MABS elements was redesignated as MWSS-273, and WES-27 with MABS elements was redesignated as MWSS-274. In August 0f 1990 with the invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi military forces, the Marine Wing Support Squadrons deployed to Saudi Arabia and set up forward expeditionary airfields in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. The MWSG-27 headquarters also sent elements to coordinate the two squadrons during the combat operations in the desert. In the summer of 1991 those elements deployed returned to the United States. From the summer of 1991 to the summer of 1997 the MWSG continued providing support to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing during normal operations, exercises, deployments and training. During this same period, MWSS 271 was designated as the principal squadron to run one of two expeditionary airfields currently in operation within the United States at Marine Corps Auxiliary Landing Field Bogue Field while maintaining support in conjunction with MWSS-274 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. In April 1997, the MWSG-27 headquarters element went through a restructuring and redesignation. The Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron-27 was redesignated as Headquarters 27 and the Personnel and Support Detachment 27 was incorporated into this new structure. On May 14, 2012 MWSG 27 disbanded and its squadrons came under direct control of the four Marine Aircraft Groups of 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. On May 22, 2018, MWSG-27 was reactivated at MCAS Cherry Point. As part of the re-organisation of the corps, MWSG-27 will be de-activated by 2030.
