It runs from Fife in the south to Everett in the north, passing through the cities of Federal Way, SeaTac, Seattle, Shoreline, and Lynnwood. The route primarily follows arterial streets but has several freeway segments, including the SR 99 Tunnel in Downtown Seattle. SR 99 was officially named the William P. Stewart Memorial Highway by the state legislature in 2016, after a campaign to replace an unofficial moniker honoring Confederate president Jefferson Davis. SR 99 was originally a section of U.S. Route 99 (US 99), which was once the state's primary north‚Äìsouth highway. US 99 was created in 1926 and replaced earlier local roads that date back to the 1890s and state roads designated as early as 1913. The highway was moved onto the Alaskan Way Viaduct in 1953, replacing a congested stretch through Downtown Seattle, and other sections were built to expressway standards in the 1950s. US 99 was ultimately replaced by the Tacoma‚ÄìEverett section of Interstate 5 (I-5), which opened in stages between 1965 and 1969. The route was de-certified in 1969 and SR 99 was created to keep segments of the highway under state control. After decades of rampant crime on some sections of SR 99, various city governments funded projects to beautify the highway and convert it into a boulevard. A section of the highway in Tukwila was transferred to city control in 2004, creating a gap in the route between the interchanges of SR 518 and SR 599\\\\. The Alaskan Way Viaduct was closed on January 11, 2019, and was replaced with a downtown bored tunnel that opened on February 4, 2019. The replacement project was spurred by the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, which damaged the viaduct and left it vulnerable to further damage, as well as city plans to revitalize the Seattle waterfront. The $3 billion megaproject was mired in planning delays for several years before construction began in 2011 with the partial demolition of the viaduct. The tunnel was constructed using Bertha, the world's largest tunnel boring machine at the time of its launch in 2013, which had a two-year delay and was completed in 2017. The viaduct was demolished in 2019, leaving room for an expanded park promenade on Alaskan Way that is planned to be completed in 2024. Route description SR 99 follows a section of former U.S. Route 99 (US 99) within the Seattle metropolitan area, from Fife to southern Everett. It is officially designated as the William P. Stewart Memorial Highway, but is commonly known as the Pacific Highway or by one of its local monikers. The entire highway is listed as part of the National Highway System, a national network of roads identified as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. A section of the highway from Tukwila to Shoreline is also designated as a Highway of Statewide Significance by the state legislature. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) estimates that average traffic volumes on SR 99, measured in terms of average annual daily traffic for 2016, range from a minimum of 17,000 vehicles on Everett Mall Way to a maximum of 97,000 at the First Avenue South Bridge in Seattle. =Fife to SeaTac= light rail station serving Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport, seen from across SR 99alt=Elevated train station seen above a freeway on an embankment. A bus stop can be seen below the embankment and across a road from a sign reading \\"SeaTac/Airport Station\\" in the foreground. SR 99 begins in Fife as an extension of 54th Avenue East at a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 5. Immediately north of the interchange, SR 99 turns east onto Pacific Highway and passes the Emerald Queen Casino, a gambling and hotel facility operated by the Puyallup Tribe, and a commercial district at the outskirts of Fife. The highway makes a gradual turn to the north, parallel to Interstate 5 and the West Fork of Hylebos Creek, and enters Milton. SR 99 travels north along a ridge and crosses into King County, turning northeast and entering the city of Federal Way in King County. The road cuts through a forested part of the Hylebos basin near West Hylebos Wetlands Park and reaches a commercial district surrounding Kitts Corner. At Kitts Corner, the highway intersects the western section of State Route 18, which continues east to an interchange with I-5 and onto a freeway traveling towards Auburn and Covington. SR 99 continues due north through Federal Way's main commercial strip and passing Celebration Park, The Commons at Federal Way, and Steel Lake. The highway gains a set of high- occupancy vehicle lanes that are also open to right turns into parking lots and side streets. From northern Federal Way to the Redondo area of Des Moines, SR 99 is concurrent with SR 509, which continues southwest to Dash Point State Park and northwest to downtown Des Moines, for . The two highways pass Saltwater State Park and the former Midway landfill before splitting near Highline College at an intersection with Kent Des Moines Road (SR 516). SR 99 then enters the city of SeaTac and continues north as International Boulevard, passing a federal detention center and light rail station on the southwest side of Angle Lake. The highway runs along the east side of Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport and its expressway, serving the airport's terminals, parking garage, light rail station, and nearby hotels. SR 99 terminates at an interchange with SR 518 in southern Tukwila, near the airport's consolidated rental car facility and the Tukwila light rail station. A section of International Boulevard in Tukwila forms the gap between the two segments of SR 99. =Seattle and Aurora Avenue= Looking south from alt=An elevated highway with inbound traffic seen atop a double-decked structure. Several buildings can be seen off to the side of the highway, while CenturyLink Field and Mount Rainier can be seen in the background. SR 99 resumes at the north end of Tukwila International Boulevard and supersedes SR 599, a short freeway connecting to I-5, near the Duwamish River. The freeway travels northwest along the river's west bank through an industrial area that faces Boeing Field. It then enters the city of Seattle and intersects the Des Moines Memorial Drive in the South Park neighborhood before the freeway ends. At an interchange with SR 509, SR 99 turns north and travels across the Duwamish River on the First Avenue South Bridge, a pair of bascule bridges that form a continuation of the SR 509 freeway. At the north end of the bridge, SR 99 turns northwest onto East Marginal Way South and travels through Seattle's industrial neighborhood along the east bank of the Duwamish Waterway. The six- lane street turns north and passes a cement factory before transforming into a four-lane freeway at an interchange with the West Seattle Freeway on the east end of the West Seattle Bridge. SR 99 widens to six lanes, including a northbound bus lane, and passes through the SoDo neighborhood as the dividing line between the Port of Seattle's container ship terminals to the west and industrial businesses to the east beyond a rail terminal. The freeway passes the corporate headquarters of Starbucks and Coast Guard Station Seattle before turning northeast and reaching the southern portal of the Alaskan Way Tunnel near CenturyLink Field and T-Mobile Park. The tunnel entrance includes offramps to nearby streets, including Dearborn Street, Alaskan Way, and a frontage road along the east side of the highway. The tunnel travels under Downtown Seattle and carries SR 99 along the central waterfront, running roughly parallel to the former Alaskan Way Viaduct. It is arranged with two stacked decks, carrying two lanes of southbound traffic on the upper deck and two lanes of northbound traffic on the lower deck. SR 99 emerges from the tunnel on the north side of Denny Way and travels onto Aurora Avenue North through the South Lake Union neighborhood, located to the east of the Seattle Center and the Space Needle. Aurora Avenue continues north as a six-lane street with bus lanes and a median barrier that restricts access from side streets to right-in/right-out. The highway runs along the eastern slope of Queen Anne Hill, above the Westlake neighborhood along Lake Union, to the Lake Washington Ship Canal. George Washington Memorial Bridge and the Downtown Seattle skyline in the backgroundalt=A divided highway seen alongside several buildings, with a city skyline in the background behind a hill. Aurora Avenue then crosses the ship canal on the George Washington Memorial Bridge (commonly known as the Aurora Bridge), a steel cantilever arch bridge with a clearance of . The bridge has six lanes and no median barrier, which resumes after an interchange with Bridge Way on the north approach, which crosses over the Fremont Troll. The highway continues north through part of Fremont and intersects North 46th Street before entering Woodland Park. SR 99 forms the boundary between Woodland Park to the east and the Woodland Park Zoo to the west and passes under a series of three pedestrian overpasses. The highway turns northeast to follow the shore of Green Lake and passes through the residential districts of Phinney Ridge and Greenwood, where traffic signals replace the medians and right-in/right-out access. SR 99 passes west of the North Seattle College campus in Licton Springs and intersects Northgate Way, a major street that provides access to Northgate Mall. Aurora Avenue then bisects the Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park, the city's largest cemetery, and passes between Haller Lake and Bitter Lake before reaching the northern city boundary at North 145th Street (SR 523). =Shoreline and Snohomish County= SR 99 enters Shoreline and passes through the city's main commercial district, running parallel to the Interurban Trail. The stretch of Aurora Avenue through Shoreline has a landscaped median, plant buffers for sidewalks, several left- turn pockets, and an overpass for the Interurban Trail. Near Shorewood High School and the Shoreline city hall, the highway is flanked to the east by the Interurban Trail and a park with a preserved section of the original North Trunk Road, which was paved in red bricks. After passing Echo Lake and the Aurora Village shopping center, SR 99 reaches the boundary between King and Snohomish counties and a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 104 and its spur route on the county line itself. alt=A wide suburban street with turn lanes, seen against strip malls, utility poles, and mountains in the background. After the interchange, the highway turns northeast and runs through a predominantly commercial area of Edmonds, passing east of the Swedish Medical Center's Edmonds campus and west of Hall Creek and the Interurban Trail. SR 99 continues northeast into Lynnwood and passes the Edmonds College campus before reaching the Crossroads commercial district at a junction with 196th Street Southwest (SR 524). The highway runs along the city's retail strip and through its international district (also described as a Koreatown), which is surrounded by apartments and homes that are setback from SR 99. Beyond the city limits of Lynnwood, SR 99 enters an unincorporated area near Lake Serene. The highway intersects SR 525 at a partial cloverleaf interchange and crosses Airport Road, which provides access to Paine Field and its passenger terminal. The highway travels north into Everett on Evergreen Way and turns northeast onto Everett Mall Way in the Fairmont neighborhood. SR 99 then passes through several residential subdivisions and reaches the Everett Mall, where it turns north and terminates at the Broadway Interchange. The interchange includes connections to I-5, the Boeing Freeway (SR 526), and SR 527\\\\. The road itself continues north towards Downtown Everett as Broadway. History=Pacific Highway and U.S. Route 99= SR 99 was created from the remnants of US 99, a highway which spanned Western Washington from the Oregon border in Vancouver to the Canadian border at the Peace Arch in Blaine. US 99 itself was preceded by a century-old network of military roads, wagon roads, and auto trails that were built across the state in the 19th century and early 20th century until it was formally incorporated into the state highway system. In southern King County, modern-day SR 99 runs parallel to a section of the Fort Steilacoom‚ÄìFort Bellingham military road, constructed in the 1850s by the U.S. Army. A section north of Seattle follows the R.F. Morrow wagon road, constructed in 1901 and later incorporated into the North Trunk Road. The North Trunk Road was completed from Seattle to the area east of Edmonds in August 1912 and initially paved with bricks. An interurban railway was also built along sections of the wagon road in 1906 and would serve Everett‚ÄìSeattle traffic until 1939. The Pacific Highway, an inter-state coastal highway, was championed by good roads advocates in the early 1910s and added to the state highway system in 1913. It originally followed the Puyallup and Green rivers from Tacoma to Renton and the Bothell‚ÄìEverett Highway along North Creek in Snohomish County. The highway was designated as State Road 1 in 1923, a number that it would retain after the creation of Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1) in 1937. The Pacific Highway was incorporated into the new national numbered highway system in 1926 as US 99, connecting the three West Coast states and running from the Mexican border to Canada. The Bothell route was bypassed by a newer and straighter highway to the west that opened on October 9, 1927. It was built by the state government in tandem with a set of new bridges connecting Everett to Marysville and cost $645,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct and partially pave. The White River route was bypassed in early 1928 by the Highline route, which traveled along the western plateau near Des Moines. The new highway cost $3 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct and pave and reduced the distance to Tacoma by . US 99 was originally routed north from Downtown Seattle on 4th Avenue, Westlake Avenue, 7th Avenue, and Dexter Avenue, crossing the Lake Washington Ship Canal on the Fremont Bridge before continuing onto Fremont Avenue. A high-level crossing of the Ship Canal to replace the existing drawbridges was proposed in the 1920s as the \\"final link\\" in the Pacific Highway. The bridge was funded by the state, county, and municipal governments and approved for construction in 1927. Construction on the bridge began in 1929 and was completed on February 22, 1932, during a dedication ceremony that named it the George Washington Memorial Bridge. The bridge was sited on Aurora Avenue, which was expanded into a limited-access expressway that extended south to Denny Way and north through Woodland Park to North 65th Street. The expressway on the north side of the bridge was completed in May 1933 after a public debate over its routing through Woodland Park, which was opposed by The Seattle Times and conservationists. The debate was settled after the passing of a city council ordinance in June 1930 and a ballot measure in November that approved the through-park route. =Viaduct and expressway construction= Within Downtown Seattle, US 99 was routed along 4th Avenue, connecting to the north with the Aurora Avenue expressway via 7th Avenue and to the south with East Marginal Way near Boeing Field. An alternate route was designated in the early 1950s along 1st Avenue, rejoining the highway in Georgetown. Congestion and difficulty in directing freight trucks through downtown led to proposals for a bypass route for US 99 as early as 1928 along Railroad Avenue on the city's waterfront. Railroad Avenue, later renamed Alaskan Way, was rebuilt in the 1930s as part of the federal government's improvements to the city seawall and became the primary bypass route for through traffic, experiencing major congestion as a result. Formal proposals to build \\"motor viaducts\\" bypassing the city along Alaskan Way were submitted by the city engineering department in 1937 and supported by automobile and traffic safety groups. The bypass viaduct gained popularity following the end of World War II and engineering work was approved in 1947, with construction funds sourced from the city and the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944. A double-deck elevated design was chosen to accommodate the six lanes that would displace railroads along the east side of Alaskan Way. Construction on the Alaskan Way Viaduct began on February 6, 1950, and the first section between Railroad Way and Elliott Avenue opened to traffic on April 4, 1953. It cost approximately $8 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars), using pile-driven columns and a pair of moving gantry cranes to lift sections of the roadway from street level. The Battery Street Tunnel, connecting the viaduct with the Aurora Avenue expressway, was opened to traffic on July 24, 1954, and cost $2.8 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars). A extension of the viaduct, linking south to a surface freeway and US 99 at East Marginal Way, cost $7.6 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars) and opened on September 3, 1959. The southern extension eased congestion at the Railroad Way terminus and was used by a daily average of 25,000 vehicles within days of opening and 37,000 vehicles by the end of the year. A series of ramps connecting the viaduct to the Spokane Street Viaduct were completed in January 1960, followed by a downtown offramp to Seneca Street in November 1961 and onramp from Columbia Street in February 1966. The state government had prepared to build a set of ramps from the viaduct to US 10 (later part of I-90) near Connecticut Street, but plans for the freeway were delayed in the 1960s and eventually abandoned, leaving the ramps unused. The viaduct was initially signed as part of U.S. Route 99 Alternate and US 99 Bypass until 1959, when US 99 was formally switched to the viaduct after the completion of the southern extension. 4th Avenue was signed as a business route of US 99 and also carried a section of US 10 to its terminus at the north end of the Battery Street Tunnel. The East Marginal Way route through the Boeing Field area was heavily congested due to traffic heading to Boeing facilities, leading to proposals in the 1950s to build a new expressway on the west side of the Duwamish River. Construction of the two- lane West Marginal Way expressway began in November 1958 and was completed in July 1959, including grade-separated interchanges and bridges at South 118th Street, 14th Avenue South, and South Cloverdale Street. The expressway split from US 99 at South 118th Street and connected to 1st Avenue at the south end of the viaduct using the First Avenue South Bridge, which opened in 1956 with the intent of becoming part of US 99. In March 1959, the state government approved $3 million in funds (equivalent to $ in dollars) for an expansion project that would widen the West Marginal Way expressway to four lanes. The expansion was completed in 1968, and was signed as US 99 Temporary and later State Route 99T after the 1964 state highway renumbering. =Replacement and redesignation= alt=A set of green highway signs reading \\"Southbound US 99\\" and \\"Waterfront\\" seen above a street intersection. The state legislature authorized planning of a tolled expressway from Tacoma to Everett in 1953, with the intent of building a grade-separated bypass of US 99. The tollway plan was superseded three years later by the Interstate Highway Program, which was authorized by the federal government and included a north‚Äìsouth freeway through the Seattle area replacing US 99. The route was designated as Interstate 5 in 1957 and planning for the Seattle Freeway began at the same time using federal funds. The first section of the Tacoma‚ÄìSeattle‚ÄìEverett freeway to be built was in southern Tacoma and was opened to traffic in October 1959. The Tacoma sections opened in October 1962 from the Puyallup River to the Kent‚ÄìDes Moines Road in Midway, and in October 1964 in downtown Tacoma. Construction of the Seattle section began in 1958 with work on the Ship Canal Bridge, which was opened to traffic on December 18, 1962. The northern approach to Downtown Seattle was opened the following August to coincide with the completion of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and SR 520. A section of the freeway traveling from North Seattle to southern Snohomish County and Everett was opened to traffic on February 3, 1965. The freeway connecting Midway to the south side of Downtown Seattle was opened on January 31, 1967, completing the final section of the urban freeway. I-5 itself was completed two years later with the opening of the section between Everett and Marysville on May 14, 1969. The state government introduced a new highway numbering system in 1964 to align with the Interstates and prepare for the decommissioning of U.S. routes. PSH 1 was replaced with US 99, which remained as a temporary designation on various freeway sections until I-5 was fully completed. US 99 was decommissioned at a meeting of the American Association of State Highway Officials on June 24, 1969, shortly after the full completion of I-5 within Washington state. While most US 99 signs were removed, an overhead sign in Downtown Seattle at the Columbia Street onramp to the Alaskan Way Viaduct remained until the viaduct was demolished in 2019. During the 1970 codification of the new highway system, the state legislature created State Route 99 (SR 99) to delay transferring ownership and maintenance of the highway to local jurisdictions. SR 99 was created from a section of US 99 running from Fife to the Broadway Interchange in Everett, and was retained as a permanent addition to the state highway system in 1971 due to the corridor's importance to state affairs. A provision in the 1971 law allows for the abandonment of the Fife‚ÄìFederal Way section of SR 99 after the completion of the SR 509 freeway extension. Instead of continuing north into Everett on Evergreen Way, SR 99 was routed northeasterly on Everett Mall Way, a section of the Broadway Cut-off (also named Diagonal Way) that opened in 1954. =Street and bridge improvements= alt=An aerial view of a suburban street with several traffic lanes and traffic lights amid strip malls and gas stations. Sections of SR 99 in North Seattle along Aurora Avenue and in South King County declined economically after the opening of Interstate 5, losing businesses amid increased crime. It became notorious havens for drug dealers, prostitutes, the homeless, and strip clubs by the 1970s and 1980s. The stretch from Federal Way to Tukwila in South King County, popularly known as the \\"SeaTac Strip\\", was where the Green River Killer (Gary Ridgway) picked up many of his victims in the 1980s. The highway was also unsafe for pedestrians and cross-traffic due to the lack of crossings and improper management of utility lines and overgrown foliage. In an effort to clean up sections of the corridor, various cities have undertaken reconstruction projects in the 1990s and 2000s to turn the highway into a landscaped boulevard. In southern King County, the cities of Federal Way, SeaTac, and Tukwila drew up redevelopment plans that were largely built out in the 2000s, reducing traffic collisions and crime while improving the area's appearance. After being denied permission to plant trees along SR 99, the city of Tukwila requested control of the highway within its city limits and was granted a jurisdictional transfer in 2004 by the state legislature, allowing them to redevelop of International Boulevard into a new street with traffic calming features. The city of Shoreline was incorporated in 1995 and made the redevelopment of Aurora Avenue into an early priority, completing its $140 million modernization and multi- use trail project in stages between 2008 and 2017. The project included new traffic signals, BAT lanes, underground utility lines, and two pedestrian bridges. Edmonds plans to add widened sidewalks with planted buffer zones, new crosswalks, and turn lane pockets to its section of SR 99 beginning in 2021. The city of Seattle also plans to improve its section of Aurora Avenue North, but funding shortages and the timing of WSDOT repaving projects have led to a lack of sidewalks along some sections of the street. The Aurora Bridge, part of the expressway linking Aurora Avenue to downtown Seattle, was the site of frequent suicide jumps until a set of emergency phones and new fences were installed in 2011 at a cost of $4.6 million to deter would-be jumpers. The bridge and its expansion joints underwent a major seismic retrofit that was completed in 2012 at a cost of $5.7 million; the retrofit was followed by a repainting and repaving project that was completed in two stages between 2016 and 2018 at a cost of $35 million. On September 24, 2015, a collision between an amphibious Duck tour vehicle and a charter bus on the Aurora Bridge killed four people and injured 50 more. The incident raised questions regarding the safety of Aurora Bridge, which lacks a median barrier and is the narrowest six-lane bridge in the state, with a lane width of . Other sections of Aurora Avenue were retrofitted to install median barriers in 1973, and the state government considered a 2003 plan to put barriers on the bridge and relocate the sidewalks to compensate for the additional weight but ultimately deferred any improvements. In the aftermath of the crash and its three-year-long court case, WSDOT and the Seattle Department of Transportation have argued over whether to install a center barrier or median zipper system, and which agency would be responsible for funding either option. =Viaduct replacement and tunnel project=Proposals and earthquake studies The 1989 collapse of the alt=A collapsed elevated freeway with the upper deck resting on the lower deck and several pillars destroyed. Several people with hard hats are seen investigating the scene. Proposals to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct date back to the 1970s during attempts to revitalize the city's waterfront for tourism and recreation rather than traditional industrial uses. A similar double-decker freeway, the Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland, California, collapsed during the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 and killed 42 people, leading to intensified calls to replace the viaduct due to the realized earthquake risk. A 1995 study commissioned by the state government after the Kobe earthquake found vulnerabilities in the Alaskan Way Viaduct's design that could cause severe damage and collapse during a major earthquake, along with liquefaction risks due to the underlying reclaimed land that the highway was built on. The study estimated that it would cost $118 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to demolish the viaduct, $344 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to retrofit the structure for earthquake resistance, and $530 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to build a new elevated freeway to replace it; other options included replacing the freeway with a tunnel or a surface boulevard with public transit on Alaskan Way, similar to San Francisco's Embarcadero. On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually earthquake struck the Seattle area with strong shaking that caused signs of visible damage on the Alaskan Way Viaduct. The freeway was shut down for inspections, which found small cracks and other minor damage to non-structural elements that allowed it to reopen within 26 hours. Four more closures were ordered later in March and April due to pieces of concrete dropping onto the streets below, requiring emergency repairs to add steel rods to reinforce the columns. The first repairs were completed in November at a cost of $1.8 million and a set of new vehicle weight restrictions were implemented; in total, $14.5 million was spent on various repairs due to earthquake damage. Annual inspections and continued monitoring found that the earthquake had caused settling of up to into the soil and weakened connections between the columns and highway decks. Additional investigations also found unrelated damage to the underlying seawall, which would need to be rebuilt to prevent a resulting collapse of the viaduct. An ongoing state study investigating a viaduct replacement strategy was accelerated by the state legislature using $5 million in funds, while a separate engineering study suggested immediate demolition of the structure due to a 1-in-20 chance of collapse in an earthquake within the next decade. In late 2001, WSDOT began work on an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the viaduct replacement project using emergency funds from the state legislature and consulted the city government and community leaders to generate concepts. By the following year, a set of 76 concepts organized into four general alternatives were presented for public feedback. Among the options were an elevated freeway similar to the current viaduct and several tunnel concepts, including a bored tunnel, a two-level cut-and-cover tunnel, and a mined tunnel carrying one direction of traffic. Five finalist options were paired with the seawall replacement and evaluated in June 2002, with costs ranging from $3.5 billion for a rebuilt viaduct to $8.8‚Äì$11.6 billion for various tunnel designs. Tunnel concept, advisory votes, and subprojects Reconstruction of the alt=An open trench with a temporary steel bridge separates a boardwalk business from a parking lot. The tunnel plan was endorsed by WSDOT and the city council based on public support for waterfront revitalization, but design changes would be needed to bring down its cost. After voters rejected a statewide gas tax referendum that would have funded a portion of the project's cost, WSDOT and the city government drafted new cost- saving concepts for a shorter tunnel and a surface boulevard that were included in the five options evaluated by the draft EIS in 2004. The six-lane, $4 billion tunnel option was chosen as the preferred alternative by WSDOT in late 2004, despite backlash from activists groups who favored a rebuilt viaduct or a waterfront boulevard. The state legislature passed an $8.5 billion gas tax program in 2005, allocating $2 billion in funding for the viaduct replacement. A supplemental EIS was prepared in 2006 to include new project requirements for the Battery Street Tunnel area and evaluate the cut- and-cover tunnel and elevated options. A pair of advisory, non-binding ballot measures was held in March 2007 to find a consensus between the $2.8 billion elevated replacement supported by Governor Christine Gregoire and a smaller four-lane tunnel with surface public transit improvements that would cost $3.4 billion and was supported by Mayor Greg Nickels; Nickel's \\"hybrid tunnel\\" proposal was rejected by Gregoire and state legislators prior to the vote based on operational and safety problems identified by WSDOT. Both options were rejected by voters, with 70 percent opposed to the tunnel and 55 percent opposed to the elevated concept. The governments of Washington state, King County, and Seattle agreed to re-evaluate the planning process for the viaduct replacement and split the main proposals from essential safety and traffic improvements that would be included in all alternatives. A $915 million package of projects was approved for immediate construction, beginning with work to strengthen sinking columns in late 2007 and repairs to the Battery Street Tunnel the following year. Although the column strengthening project was declared successful, further inspections found that the Columbia Street onramp had sunk an additional during the nearby construction. The southernmost stretch of the viaduct, between Holgate and King streets, was demolished in October 2011 and replaced with a six-lane elevated freeway that opened the following year at a cost of $115 million. Seattle voters approved a bond measure in 2012 to replace the Alaskan Way Seawall; the project began construction in 2013 and was completed in 2017 at a cost of $410 million, running 21 percent overbudget. Deep-bored tunnel approved and contested The state government announced a new timeline for the project in January 2008, with Governor Gregoire declaring her intention to demolish the viaduct by 2012 regardless of Seattle's approval. Eight new concepts for a four-lane replacement were developed by June from a set of priorities developed for SR 99, I-5, and public transit in downtown. The eight options included two surface boulevards with transit improvements, a one-way couplet, a set of two elevated freeways, an elevated freeway with a rooftop park, and three tunnels: a cut-and-cover tunnel, a lidded trench, and a deep-bored tunnel. Several early concepts, including a bridge across Elliott Bay and a complete rebuild of the double-decked viaduct, were rejected by the panel of public officials. The final decision was delayed until after the gubernatorial election, but would have to meet an end-of-year deadline imposed by the state legislature. In December 2008, two finalists were chosen for further study and consideration by the state legislature: a $2.3 billion elevated freeway and the $2.2 billion surface-transit option. While the deep-bored tunnel was not chosen as one of the two finalists, it remained popular with tunnel activists and was considered separately due to its $4.25 billion cost (equivalent to $ in dollars). On January 13, 2009, Governor Gregoire signed an agreement with Mayor Nickels and King County Executive Ron Sims to ratify the deep-bored tunnel as the replacement for the Alaskan Way Viaduct, to be completed by 2015. $2.8 billion would be covered by state gas taxes and federal funds, leaving a $1.4 billion shortfall to be filled by the local government and potential tolls. The state legislature passed a bill in April 2009 to commit $2.8 billion in state funding for the tunnel project, which Governor Gregoire signed the following month. In total, more than 90 alternatives were considered before the final agreement was reached in 2009. The tunnel project received $300 million in funds from the Port of Seattle in exchange for design input on the surface boulevard that would replace Alaskan Way. Neighborhood and environmental activist Mike McGinn was elected mayor in 2009, largely on an anti-tunnel platform, and threatened to veto project agreements until the state took responsibility for cost overruns that would fall upon Seattle. The city council approved a non-binding resolution to authorize the tunnel project, pending the outcome of contract bidding, which was completed in December 2010 with the selection of Seattle Tunnel Partners (STP), a consortium led by Dragados USA. STP presented a $1.09 billion plan to use a tunnel boring machine, the world's widest, to complete the tunnel by late 2015. WSDOT signed the tunnel construction contract in January 2011, sending a set of contractor agreements to the city council for approval. The state's agreements were approved by the city council in February 2011, shortly before being symbolically vetoed by Mayor McGinn; the veto was overridden by the end of the month‚Äîthe 10th anniversary of the Nisqually earthquake‚Äîwith an 8‚Äì1 city council majority. McGinn joined other tunnel opposition groups to file a referendum questioning whether the city council had the authority to approve the state and federal agreements. The referendum was initially blocked by a lawsuit filed by the city, but was approved and placed on the August 2011 ballot by a county judge. The referendum was approved by 58 percent of voters on August 16, 2011, authorizing the city's agreements with WSDOT. The Federal Highway Administration completed its analysis of the project's final EIS and issued its record of decision with WSDOT later that month, allowing pre- construction activities to begin. Tunnel boring and viaduct closure alt=The inside of a large concrete cylinder with steel cables and forms on the sides. Ahead is a massive structure with several floors of machinery and a large yellow tube at the top. After the demolition of the viaduct's southernmost stretch and its lanes were realigned onto an adjacent bypass in 2012, crews began excavation of a launch pit to house the tunnel boring machine. Local officials, with the notable absence of Mayor Mike McGinn, participated in a ceremonial groundbreaking was held for the tunnel on June 20, 2012. The tunnel boring machine was manufactured by Hitachi Zosen in Osaka, Japan, and named \\"Bertha\\" in honor of Mayor Bertha Knight Landes. Bertha arrived in Seattle on April 2, 2013, and its 40 pieces were assembled in the launch pit before tunnel boring began on July 30‚Äîsetting a record for the world's largest tunnel boring machine. Tunnel boring was halted at near South Main Street in December 2013 after the machine encountered an unknown object that caused it to overheat. The object was found to be a steel pipe and well casing that was left behind by a groundwater research crew for the project in 2002. The pipe caused extensive damage to Bertha's cutterhead and main bearing seal, requiring the excavation of a rescue pit for repairs. Bertha reached the completed excavation pit in March 2015 and the machine's front end was disassembled and lifted to the surface to repair the damage, which was found to be more extensive than previously thought. The repaired cutterhead was lowered into the access pit in August 2015 and tunnel boring resumed on December 22, 2015, reaching past the pit the following month. During the two-year halt in tunnel boring, public officials considered alternative plans to accelerate demolition of the viaduct while awaiting tunnel completion. The project was named one of the worst boondoggles in the United States by several transportation groups and critics, due in part to the stoppage and its high cost. Tunnel boring was halted by Governor Jay Inslee in January 2016 due to the appearance of a sinkhole in Pioneer Square, but resumed the following month. The machine passed under the Alaskan Way Viaduct in April 2016, requiring a closure while the structure was monitored for movement, and reached the halfway mark in October. Bertha completed its bore on April 4, 2017, arriving at the north portal near Aurora Avenue for disassembly, which was completed in August. The tunnel portals and their maintenance areas were completed while work on the double-decker freeway inside the tunnel progressed behind the machine. The Alaskan Way Viaduct permanently closed on January 11, 2019, beginning a three-week realignment of ramps at the portals as ramps were prepared for the opening of the tolled downtown tunnel on February 4, 2019. The remaining section of the viaduct was demolished in stages between February and November 2019, with some of the of rubble deposited into the Battery Street Tunnel as it was filled and sealed. A three-block section of Aurora Avenue between Denny Way and the new tunnel portal was raised and reconnected to cross-streets in 2019. The Alaskan Way promenade and boulevard project is planned to cost $668 million and will be completed in 2024. The new boulevard will be eight lanes wide in some sections due to requirements placed by WSDOT for Colman Dock access and the Port of Seattle for truck access. The viaduct replacement megaproject is estimated to cost $3.3 billion, with $200 million of construction costs and additional funds for ongoing maintenance to be raised through tunnel tolls that began to be collected on November 9, 2019. Names and designations alt=A wide suburban road with several parking lots. At the right of center is a sign reading \\"William P. Stewart Memorial Highway\\". The name of SR 99 differs from city to city, with several sections named the Pacific Highway and International Boulevard, a moniker invented by SeaTac for the 1990 Goodwill Games hosted by King County. In Seattle, the highway is known as East Marginal Way and Aurora Avenue North; in Everett, it uses Evergreen Way and Everett Mall Way. A four-block section of former SR 99 between Denny Way and the new tunnel portal was renamed to 7th Avenue North and Borealis Avenue in early 2019 as part of the reconfiguration of Aurora Avenue. The United Daughters of the Confederacy unsuccessfully lobbied the state legislature in 1939 to designate the entirety of US 99 within the state as part of the national \\"Jefferson Davis Highway\\". A pair of granite markers were installed the following year in Blaine and Vancouver to commemorate the highway, allegedly to recognize Davis's contributions to the territorial development of Washington as U.S. Secretary of War. The two markers were removed in 1998 and 2002, and are now located at the privately owned Jefferson Davis Park in Ridgefield. The State House of Representatives unanimously approved a bill in 2002 that would have removed Davis' name from the road, but it was deferred by a State Senate committee. The attempted renaming, led by Snohomish representative Hans Dunshee, generated political controversy and death threats against legislators from people opposed to the bill. The bill was revived in May 2016 and was passed unanimously by both houses of the legislature, renaming SR 99 for William P. Stewart, an African-American Civil War veteran and early settler in Snohomish. New highway signs for the William P. Stewart Memorial Highway were installed the following year, amid a new wave of Confederate monument removals. Public transit The alt=A red-and-yellow articulated bus seen on a suburban street from a nearby sidewalk. The bus's front sign reads \\"[A] Federal Way TC\\". SR 99 is a major regional public transit corridor and carries several bus rapid transit routes and a light rail line in SeaTac. The highway features bus lanes and business access and transit lanes (BAT lanes) in several locations to give buses traffic priority while retaining access to right turns. Pierce Transit route 500 runs on the SR 99 and Pacific Highway corridor between Tacoma Dome Station and Federal Way Transit Center. Through Federal Way and SeaTac, the highway is served by the RapidRide A Line, an rapid bus route that debuted in 2010 and features enhanced bus stops and transit signal priority. Sound Transit's Link light rail trains on Central Link run along elevated tracks above or near SR 99 from Angle Lake station to Tukwila International Boulevard station at the SR 518 interchange. The Alaskan Way Viaduct carried several non-stop routes connecting Downtown Seattle to West Seattle (including the RapidRide C Line) and Burien. Aurora Avenue carries the RapidRide E Line, which transports 18,000 passengers daily and is the busiest bus route in the King County Metro system. The E Line debuted in 2014, replacing Route 358‚Äîitself a replacement for Route 359, a route number that was retired in 1999 after a Metro bus was involved in a shooting and crashed off the Aurora Bridge. The E Line terminates in Downtown Seattle and near the county line at the Aurora Village Transit Center, where Community Transit's route 101 and Swift Blue Line begins. Swift features off-board fare payment and longer spacing between stops, and runs from Shoreline to Everett Station via Evergreen Way. The Everett Mall Way section of SR 99 is served by Everett Transit route 7, which connects the Everett Mall to Downtown Everett and Everett Station.

Bulliet (born 1940) is a professor of history at Columbia University who specializes in the history of Islamic society and institutions, the history of technology, and the history of the role of animals in human society. Early life and education Bulliet grew up in Illinois. He attended Harvard, from which he received a BA in 1962 and a PhD in 1967. He is the grandson of Clarence Joseph (\\"C.J.\\") Bulliet, an art critic and journalist. Work Several of his books focus on Iran but deal also with the larger Muslim world, including The Patricians of Nishapur: a Study in Medieval Islamic History (1972), Conversion to Islam in the Medieval Period: An Essay in Quantitative History (1979), and Islam: the View from the Edge (1994). His books on a broader view of Islamic history and society include Under Siege: Islam and Democracy (1994) and The Case for Islamo-Christian Civilization (2004). His book The Camel and the Wheel (1975) brings together his interest in the histories of technology, animal domestication, and the Middle East, dealing for example with the significant military advantage early Muslim armies gained from a slight improvement in the design of cloth camel saddles. He would return to the history of animal domestication with his Hunters, Herders, and Hamburgers: The Past and Future of Human-Animal Relationships (2005). Hunters, Herders, and Hamburgers: The Past and Future of Human-Animal Relationships presents the four stages of human-animal relationship history: separation (when humans began to consider themselves as fundamentally separate from animals), pre-domestication (rich in symbolic expression of animals), domestication (exploiting and taming animals for human use), and post- domestication (our current industrialized consumption and separation from domestic animals). He is the writer and editor of books of more general interest as well, including The Columbia History of the Twentieth Century (editor, 1998), The Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East (co-editor, 1996), and The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History (co-author, 1997). He has also written several novels which draw on his knowledge of international politics and the Middle East, and is a promoter of the validity of comics as an art form. His first fiction book, Kicked to Death by a Camel (1973), was nominated for an Edgar for \\"Best First Mystery\\". His other fiction includes Tomb of the Twelfth Imam (1979), The Gulf Scenario (1984), The Sufi Fiddle (1991), and The One-Donkey Solution (2011). Bulliet's commentaries and opinion pieces on the Middle East have appeared in such newspapers The Guardian, New York Times International, and S√ºddeutsche Zeitung.SZ, 4.6.2004, \\"Whose Theocracy?\\" According to an interview in Columbia magazine's Fall 2007 edition, Columbia President Lee C. Bollinger credits Bulliet with the idea for inviting Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak on campus on September 24, 2007.\\"In the Eye of the Storm\\" http://www.columbia.edu/cu/alumni/Magazine/Fall2007/EyeOfTheStorm.html ReferencesExternal links *Bulliet's address to the Dialogue among Civilizations, United Nations, New York City, 5 September 2000 *Islam: The View from the Edge back cover matter 1940 births Living people Columbia University faculty Harvard University alumni American historians of religion American medievalists Historians of the Middle East American scholars of Islam ","title":"Richard Bulliet"},{"id":"626390","text":"Belgium *Belgian Congo ‚Äì Auguste Tilkens, Governor-General of the Belgian Congo (1927‚Äì1934) France * French Somaliland ‚Äì Pierre Aimable Chapon- Baissac, Governor of French Somaliland (1924‚Äì1932) * Guinea ‚Äì *# Antoine Paladi, Lieutenant-Governor of Guinea (1927‚Äì1928) *# Jean-Claude Tissier, acting Lieutenant-Governor of Guinea (1928) *# Jean Louis Georges Poiret, Lieutenant-Governor of Guinea (1928‚Äì1929) Japan * Karafuto ‚Äì K≈çji Kita,In accordance with Wikipedia Manual of Style, Japanese born in or after 1868 are represented in Western name order; those born earlier are presented in traditional name order (surname first).

Though there were other ships of the Navy that had been named Dunkirk, as far back as the 1650s, it held added meaning after the evacuation from Dunkirk between late May and early June 1940, in which over 300,000 British, as well as French troops, were rescued by a ragtag fleet of ships. Dunkirk was built by Alexander Stephen and Sons of Govan. She was launched on 27 August 1945 and commissioned on 27 November 1946. Service In the year of her commissioning, Dunkirk joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet.Critchley, Mike, \\"British Warships Since 1945: Part 3: Destroyers\\", Maritime Books: Liskeard, UK, 1982. , page 115-16 In 1950, Dunkirk was placed in Reserve, as were many of her sister ships in the 1950s. She subsequently performed a variety of duties and in 1958, while in the Mediterranean, Dunkirk, in broad daylight, collided with her sister ship during naval manoeuvres off Malta, causing minor damage. In 1961, Dunkirk, along with the cruiser and the frigate , undertook a tour of the South American continent. Instead of returning home to the UK from the deployment's culmination Dunkirk deployed to the Mediterranean to take up the duties of , a of the 7th Destroyer Squadron, based in the Mediterranean, which had experienced some engine problems and therefore had to be replaced. Dunkirk finally returned home in 1963. Decommissioning and disposal In 1965 Dunkirk was listed as 'reserve' and later that year was scrapped at Faslane.

Description As a mountainous system the Pre- Pyrenees are part of the Pyrenees. They run parallel to the main mountain range in a west to east direction. On the French side the Pyrenees's slopes descend rather abruptly, thus on the northern side, the Pre-Pyrenees are confined to the Corbi√®res Massif, towards the eastern end of the mountain system. Christophe Neff : Les Corbi√®res maritimes ‚Äì forment-elles un √©tage de v√©g√©tation m√©diterran√©enne thermophile masqu√© par la pression humaine ?

The Massif de Plantaurel further west deserves mention as well, although not as clearly a foothill. On the Iberian side, however, the picture is very different: a large and complex system of foothill ranges stretches from Navarre, across northern Aragon, reaching the Mediterranean coast on the Catalan end of the Pyrenees. At the eastern end on the southern side lies a distinct area known as the Sub- Pyrenees.Jordi Sacasas i Llu√≠s, Geograf√≠a de Catalunya, Publicacions L'Abadia de Montserrat.

In 1996, two years after their acclaimed Re, the band had amassed enough new music to fill four CDs, but couldn't winnow it down to a single album. So instead, they covered eight songs by other Spanish-speaking artists, who ranged from totally obscure to well-known. Track listing All the covers are very different from the originals - and from each other. Chilanga Banda is a hip-hop piece in Mexican slang (featuring the sound \\"ch\\"), and Ojal√° Que Llueva Caf√© is marked by fast-paced fiddle and rapid switching from chest register to head register - reminiscent, in fact, of yodeling.

While often cited as a descendant of the knight Hugo Herr, scholarship done in the 20th century has put this claim in doubt. He joined the Swiss Brethren (later called Mennonites) and became a bishop. He was the first Mennonite bishop to emigrate to America. When religious persecution became unendurable in Switzerland, many of his congregation emigrated with him to the Electorate of the Palatinate in Germany, which was governed by a ruler who promised them protection and religious freedom. This was satisfactory until the Palatinate fell into the hands of other rulers, subjecting the Mennonites to severe religious persecution once again. When this occurred, a number of them visited William Penn in London, in 1707, and arranged terms with him to colonize a portion of what is now Lancaster County, near what was then the western frontier of Pennsylvania. In 1710, Hans Herr, John R. Bundely, Martin Meylin (Mylin), Martin Kendig, Jacob Miller, Hans Funk, Hans Graff (Groff), Martin Oberholtzer, Wendel Bowman and others bought 10,000 acres (40 km¬≤) of land on the south side of Pequea Creek. A warrant was issued for the land October 10, 1710, and it was surveyed October 23, 1710. The tradition, which has never been disproved, is that these immigrants held a conference as to what steps should be taken to inform their relatives and friends in Europe of their opinions and expectations of their new lands, and it was determined that Hans Herr, their revered minister, should return, explain the situation and the great advantages of emigration, and bring with him those he could induce to come. He sailed to Europe and returned to America with many more immigrants, despite making the journey at 70 years old. He had six sons and one daughter by his wife Elizabeth Kendig. He died in West Lampeter Township on October 11, 1725. House and museum The Hans Herr House The Hans Herr House, built by his son Christian Herr in 1719, is open to the public as a museum, and is the oldest Pennsylvania German settlement still in existence today. The house is located at 1849 Hans Herr Drive in Willow Street, Pennsylvania.

Piracicaba, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Alternative fuels, known as non- conventional and advanced fuels, are any materials or substances that can be used as fuels, other than conventional fuels like; fossil fuels (petroleum (oil), coal, and natural gas), as well as nuclear materials such as uranium and thorium, as well as artificial radioisotope fuels that are made in nuclear reactors. Some well-known alternative fuels include bio-diesel, bio-alcohol (methanol, ethanol, butane), refuse-derived fuel, chemically stored electricity (batteries and fuel cells), hydrogen, non-fossil methane, non- fossil natural gas, vegetable oil, propane and other biomass sources. Background The main purpose of fuel is to store energy, which should be in a stable form and can be easily transported to the place of use. Almost all fuels are chemical fuels. The user employs this fuel to generate heat or perform mechanical work, such as powering an engine. It may also be used to generate electricity, which is then used for heating, lighting, or other purposes. Current official definitions All official definitions are not the same. =Definition in the European Union= In the European Union, alternative fuel is defined by Directive 2014/94/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. =Definition in the USA= In the US, EPA defines alternative fuel =Definition in Canada= In Canada, since 1996, Alternative Fuels Regulations SOR/96-453 Alternative Fuels Act defined alternative fuel: =China= In China, alternative fuel vehicles should comply with technical guidelines for the local production of alternative-fuel vehicles: they should have a shelf life of more than 100,000 km, and a complete charge should take less than seven hours. Up to 80% of a charge must be available after less than 30 minutes of charging. In addition, pure-electric vehicles must consume electric energy of less than 0.16 kWh/km.https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/knowledge-base/china-announces- guidelines-for-alternative-fuel-vehicles/ History Regulation No 83 of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UN/ECE) related to the emission of pollutants according to engine fuel requirements defines the concept of Alternative fuel vehicle. In 1995, Canada had yet an act which defined Alternative fuel. Bio-fuel Alternative fuel dispensers at a regular gasoline station in Arlington, Virginia. B20 biodiesel at the left and E85 ethanol at the right. Bio-fuels are also considered a renewable source. Although renewable energy is used mostly to generate electricity, it is often assumed that some form of renewable energy or a percentage is used to create alternative fuels. Research is ongoing into finding more suitable bio-fuel crops and improving the oil yields of these crops. Using the current yields, vast amounts of land and fresh water would be needed to produce enough oil to completely replace fossil fuel usage. =Biomass= Biomass in the energy production industry is living and recently dead biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production. It has become popular among coal power stations, which switch from coal to biomass in order to convert to renewable energy generation without wasting existing generating plant and infrastructure. Biomass most often refers to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food or feed, and are specifically called nitrocellulose biomass.[2] As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of bio-fuel. =Algae-based fuels= Algae-based bio-fuels have been promoted in the media as a potential panacea to crude oil-based transportation problems. Algae could yield more than 2000 gallons of fuel per acre per year of production. Algae based fuels are being successfully tested by the U.S. Navy Algae-based plastics show potential to reduce waste and the cost per pound of algae plastic is expected to be cheaper than traditional plastic prices. =Bio-diesel= Bio-diesel is made from animal fats or vegetable oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as atrophy, soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, safflower, canola, sesame, cottonseed, etc. Once these fats or oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, diesel is brought to life from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions or used alone. Despite one‚Äôs mixture preference, bio-diesel will release a smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because bio- diesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel‚Äôs reduced quantity of sulfur from the LSD (ultra-low sulfur diesel) invention, bio-diesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free. Alcohol fuels Methanol and ethanol fuel are primary sources of energy; they are convenient fuels for storing and transporting energy. These alcohols can be used in internal combustion engines as alternative fuels. Butane has another advantage: it is the only alcohol-based motor fuel that can be transported readily by existing petroleum-product pipeline networks, instead of only by tanker trucks and railroad cars.  Ammonia  Ammonia (NH3) can be used as fuel. Benefits of ammonia include no need for oil, zero emissions, low cost, and distributed production reducing transport and related pollution.  Emulsion Fuels  Diesel can also be emulsified with water to be used as a fuel.[1] Jhalani A, Sharma D, Soni SL, Sharma PK, Sharma S.

Carbon-neutral and negative fuels  Carbon neutral fuel is synthetic fuel‚Äîsuch as methane, gasoline, diesel fuel or jet fuel‚Äîproduced from renewable or nuclear energy used to hydrogenate waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbolic acid in seawater. (Review.) (Review.) (Review.) Such fuels are potentially carbon neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases. (Review.) To the extent that carbon neutral fuels displace fossil fuels, or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbolic acid, and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe, they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere, and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation. (Review.) (Review.) Such carbon neutral and negative fuels can be produced by the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen used in the Sabbatical reaction to produce methane which may then be stored to be burned later in power plants as synthetic natural gas, transported by pipeline, truck, or tanker ship, or be used in gas to liquids processes such as the Fischer‚ÄìTroopship process to make traditional transportation or heating fuels. (Review.) Carbon-neutral fuels have been proposed for distributed storage for renewable energy, minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittent, and enabling transmission of wind, water, and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines. Such renewable fuels could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels, enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles. Germany has built a 250-kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts. Audi has constructed a carbon neutral liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Werlte, Germany. The plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset LNG used in their A3 Sportback g-tron automobiles, and can keep 2,800 metric tons of CO2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity. Other commercial developments are taking place in Columbia, South Carolina,Doty Windfuels Camarillo, California,CoolPlanet Energy Systems and Darlington, England.Air Fuel Synthesis, Ltd. The least expensive source of carbon for recycling into fuel is flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion, where it can be extracted for about US $7.50 per ton. Automobile exhaust gas capture has also been proposed to be economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting. Since carbonic acid in seawater is in chemical equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide, extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied. Researchers have estimated that carbon extraction from seawater would cost about $50 per ton. Carbon capture from ambient air is more costly, at between $600 and $1000 per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration. Nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day. Therefore, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative. Off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U.S. averaged 1.64 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009, but only 0.71 cents/kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day. Typically, wholesale electricity costs 2 to 5 cents/kWh during the day.Bloomberg Energy Prices Bloomberg.com (compare to off-peak wind power price graph.) Retrieved September 7, 2012. Commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce fuel for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel. The U.S. Navy estimates that shipboard production of jet fuel from nuclear power would cost about $6 per gallon. While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive. However, U.S. civilian nuclear power is considerably more expensive than wind power.Sovacool, B.K. (2011). Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy, World Scientific, p. 126. The Navy's estimate that 100 megawatts can produce 41,000 gallons of fuel per day indicates that terrestrial production from wind power would cost less than $1 per gallon. Hydrogen & formic acid Hydrogen is an emissionless fuel. The byproduct of hydrogen burning is water, although some mono-nitrogen oxides NOx are produced when hydrogen is burned with air. Another fuel is formic acid. The fuel is used by converting it first to hydrogen and using that in a fuel cell. Formic acid is much more easy to store than hydrogen.Team FASTTeam FAST's formic acid car Hydrogen/compressed natural gas mixture HCNG (or H2CNG) is a mixture of compressed natural gas and 4-9 percent hydrogen by energy. Hydrogen could also be used as Hydroxy gas for better combustion characteristics of C.I. engine. Hydroxy gas is obtained through electrolysis of water. Compressed air The air engine is an emission-free piston engine using compressed air as fuel. Unlike hydrogen, compressed air is about one- tenth as expensive as fossil fuel, making it an economically attractive alternative fuel. Propane autogas Propane is a cleaner burning, high- performance fuel derived from multiple sources. It is known by many names including propane, LPG (liquified propane gas), LPA (liquid propane autogas), Autogas and others. Propane is a hydrocarbon fuel and is a member of the natural gas family. Propane as an automotive fuel shares many of the physical attributes of gasoline while reducing tailpipe emissions and well to wheel emissions overall. Propane is the number one alternative fuel in the world and offers an abundance of supply, liquid storage at low pressure, an excellent safety record and large cost savings when compared to traditional fuels. Propane delivers an octane rating between 104 and 112 depending on the composition of the butane/propane ratios of the mixture. Propane autogas in a liquid injection format captures the phase change from liquid to gas state within the cylinder of the combustion engine producing an \\"intercooler\\" effect, reducing the cylinder temperature and increasing air density. The resultant effect allows more advance on the ignition cycle and a more efficient engine combustion. Propane lacks additives, detergents or other chemical enhancements further reducing the exhaust output from the tailpipe. The cleaner combustion also has fewer particulate emissions, lower NOx due to the complete combustion of the gas within the cylinder, higher exhaust temperatures increasing the efficiency of the catalyst and deposits less acid and carbon inside the engine which extends the useful life of the lubricating oil. Propane autogas is generated at the well alongside other natural gas and oil products. It is also a by-product of the refining processes which further increase the supply of Propane to the market. Propane is stored and transported in a liquid state at roughly of pressure. Fueling vehicles are similar to gasoline in the speed of delivery with modern fueling equipment. Propane filling stations only require a pump to transfer vehicle fuel and do not require expensive and slow compression systems when compared to compressed natural gas which is usually kept at over . In a vehicle format, propane autogas can be retrofitted to almost any engine and provide fuel cost savings and lowered emissions while being more efficient as an overall system due to the large, pre-existing propane fueling infrastructure that does not require compressors and the resultant waste of other alternative fuels in well to wheel lifecycles. Natural gas vehicles Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are two cleaner combustible alternatives to conventional liquid automobile fuels. = Compressed natural gas fuel types = Compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles can use both renewable COG and non- renewable COG. Conventional CNG is produced from the many underground natural gas reserves are in widespread production worldwide today. New technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to economically access unconventional gas resources, appear to have increased the supply of natural gas in a fundamental way. Renewable natural gas or bio-gas is a methane‚Äêbased gas with similar properties to natural gas that can be used as transportation fuel. Present sources of biogas are mainly landfills, sewage, and animal/agri‚Äêwaste. Based on the process type, biogas can be divided into the following: biogas produced by anaerobic digestion, landfill gas collected from landfills, treated to remove trace contaminants, and synthetic natural gas (SNG). = Practicality = Around the world, this gas powers more than 5 million vehicles, and just over 150,000 of these are in the U.S. American usage is growing at a dramatic rate. = Environmental analysis = Because natural gas emits little pollutant when combusted, cleaner air quality has been measured in urban localities switching to natural gas vehicles Tailpipe can be reduced by 15‚Äì25% compared to gasoline, diesel. The greatest reductions occur in medium and heavy duty, light duty and refuse truck segments. reductions of up to 88% are possible by using biogas. Similarities to hydrogen Natural gas, like hydrogen, is another fuel that burns cleanly; cleaner than both gasoline and diesel engines. Also, none of the smog-forming contaminates are emitted. Hydrogen and natural gas are both lighter than air and can be mixed together. Nuclear power and radiothermal generators= Nuclear reactors = Nuclear power is any nuclear technology designed to extract usable energy from atomic nuclei via controlled nuclear reactions. The only controlled method now practical uses nuclear fission in a fissile fuel (with a small fraction of the power coming from subsequent radioactive decay). Use of the nuclear reaction nuclear fusion for controlled power generation is not yet practical, but is an active area of research. Nuclear power is usually used by using a nuclear reactor to heat a working fluid such as water, which is then used to create steam pressure, which is converted into mechanical work for the purpose of generating electricity or propulsion in water. Today, more than 15% of the world's electricity comes from nuclear power, and over 150 nuclear- powered naval vessels have been built. In theory, electricity from nuclear reactors could also be used for propulsion in space, but this has yet to be demonstrated in a space flight. Some smaller reactors, such as the TOPAZ nuclear reactor, are built to minimize moving parts and use methods that convert nuclear energy to electricity more directly, making them useful for space missions, but this electricity has historically been used for other purposes. Power from nuclear fission has been used in a number of spacecraft, all of them unmanned. The Soviets up to 1988 orbited 33 nuclear reactors in RORSAT military radar satellites, where electric power generated was used to power a radar unit that located ships on the Earth's oceans. The U.S. also orbited one experimental nuclear reactor in 1965, in the SNAP-10A mission. No nuclear reactor has been sent into space since 1988. =Thorium fuelled nuclear reactors= Thorium-based nuclear power reactors have also become an area of active research in recent years. It is being backed by many scientists and researchers, and Professor James Hansen, the former Director at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies has reportedly said, ‚ÄúAfter studying climate change for over four decades, it‚Äôs clear to me that the world is heading for a climate catastrophe unless we develop adequate energy sources to replace fossil fuels. Safer, cleaner and cheaper nuclear power can replace coal and is desperately needed as an essential part of the solution‚Äù. Thorium is 3-4 times more abundant within nature than uranium, and its ore, monazite, is commonly found in sands along bodies of water. Thorium has also gained interest because it could be easier to obtain than uranium. While uranium mines are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners, thorium is taken from open pits. Monazite is present in countries such as Australia, the United States and India, in quantities large enough to power the earth for thousands of years. As an alternative to uranium-fuelled nuclear reactors, thorium has been proven to add to proliferation, produces radioactive waste for deep geological repositories like technetium-99 (half-life over 200,000 years),Thorium fuel No panacea for nuclear power and has a longer fuel cycle. For a list of experimental and presently-operating thorium-fueled reactors, see thorium fuel cycle#List of thorium fueled reactors. = Radiothermal generators = In addition, radioisotopes have been used as alternative fuels, on both lands, and in space. Their use of land is declining due to the danger of theft of isotope and environmental damage if the unit is opened. The decay of radioisotopes generates both heat and electricity in many space probes, particularly probes to outer planets where sunlight is weak, and low temperatures is a problem. Radiothermal generators (RTGs) which use such radioisotopes as fuels do not sustain a nuclear chain reaction, but rather generate electricity from the decay of a radioisotope which has (in turn) been produced on Earth as a concentrated power source (fuel) using energy from an Earth-based nuclear reactor.

The Ventura first entered combat in Europe as a bomber with the RAF in late 1942. Designated PV-1 by the United States Navy (US Navy), it entered combat in 1943 in the Pacific. The bomber was also used by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), which designated it the Lockheed B-34 (Lexington) and B-37 as a trainer. British Commonwealth forces also used it in several guises, including antishipping and antisubmarine search and attack. The Ventura was developed from the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar transport, as a replacement for the Lockheed Hudson bombers then in service with the Royal Air Force. Used in daylight attacks against occupied Europe, they proved to have weaknesses and were removed from bomber duty and some used for patrols by Coastal Command. After USAAF monopolization of land-based bombers was removed, the US Navy ordered a revised design which entered service as the PV-2 Harpoon for anti-submarine work. Development=Lockheed Ventura/B-34 Lexington= An RAF Ventura Mk 1 At the start of the war, Lockheed proposed military conversions of the Lodestar for the RAF as replacement for the Hudson reconnaissance aircraft and the Bristol Blenheim bomber. The first British order was placed in February 1940 for 25 Model 32 as bombers. This was followed by an order for 300 Model 37 with Double Wasp engines, then for a further 375 later in 1940. Lockheed needed more production capacity and nearby Vega Aircraft Corporation was contracted for building the Ventura. The Ventura was very similar to its predecessor, the Lockheed Hudson. The primary difference was not in layout; rather, the Ventura was larger, heavier, and used more powerful engines than the Hudson. The RAF ordered 188 Venturas in February 1940, which were delivered from mid-1942. Venturas were initially used for daylight raids on occupied Europe but, like some other RAF bombers, they proved too vulnerable without fighter escort, which was difficult to provide for long-range missions. Venturas were replaced by the faster de Havilland Mosquito. The Venturas were transferred to patrol duties with Coastal Command as the Mosquito replaced them in bomber squadrons; 30 went to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and some to the South African Air Force (SAAF). The RAF placed an order for 487 Ventura Mark IIs but many of these were diverted to the USAAF, which placed its own order for 200 Ventura Mark IIA as the B-34 Lexington, later renamed RB-34. =Lockheed B-37= In August 1941, large orders for Venturas were placed with Lend-Lease Act money. Among the orders were for 550 armed reconnaissance versions of the Ventura. This aircraft was originally planned to be built under the designation O-56. The main differences between the Ventura and the O-56 were in the engines: rather than the 2,000 hp (1,491 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radials of the Ventura, the O-56 used 1,700 hp (1,270 kW) Wright R-2600-13 radials. Before completion of the first O-56, the U.S. Army Air Forces dropped the \\"O-\\" category used to designate \\"observation\\" (reconnaissance) aircraft. The O-56 was redesignated the RB-34B (the R denoted 'restricted' meaning it was not to be used for combat). Before the first of these flew, the design was redesignated again as the B-37 with a higher powered version of the R-2600, later it also was designated the RB-37. While 550 were ordered by the Army Air Forces, acquisition by the USAAF stopped after only 18 Venturas were accepted, when the Army Air Forces agreed to turn over exclusive use of the Ventura to the United States Navy. =PV-1 Ventura= A PV-1 Ventura The PV-1 Ventura, built by the Vega Aircraft Company division of Lockheed (hence the \\"V\\" Navy manufacturer's letter that later replaced the \\"O\\" for Lockheed), was a version of the Ventura built for the U.S. Navy (see Venturas in U.S. Navy service below). The main differences between the PV-1 and the B-34 were the inclusion of special equipment in the PV-1, adapting it to its patrol bombing role. The maximum fuel capacity of the PV-1 was increased from 1,345 gal (5,081 l) to 1,607 gal (6,082 l), to increase its range; the forward defensive armament was also reduced for this reason. The most important addition was of an ASD-1 search radar. Early production PV-1s still carried a bombardier's station behind the nose radome, with four side windows and a flat bomb-aiming panel underneath the nose. Late production PV-1s dispensed with this bombardier position and replaced it with a pack with three 0.50 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns underneath the nose. These aircraft could also carry eight 5-inch (127 mm) HVAR rockets on launchers underneath the wings. The PV-1 began to be delivered in December 1942, and entered service in February 1943. The first squadron in combat was VP-135, deployed in the Aleutian Islands in April 1943. They were operated by three other squadrons in this theatre. From the Aleutians, they flew strikes against bases in Paramushiro and Shimushu, Japanese islands in the Kurile chain. Often, PV-1s would lead B-24 bomber formations, since they were equipped with radar. In late 1943, some PV-1s were deployed to the Solomon Islands as night fighters with VMF(N)-531, a Marine Corps fighter squadron. =PV-2 Harpoon= A PV-2 Harpoon in flight in 1945 PV-2 Harpoon at the National Naval Aviation Museum Naval Air Station Pensacola FL 2008 PV-2 Harpoon at the National Naval Aviation Museum Naval Air Station Pensacola FL 18 JUN 2009 PV-2 Harpoon repainted and marked \\"Air Tropic Island Charters\\" on display at MAYDAY GOLF in North Myrtle Beach SC 14 AUG 2012 The PV-2 Harpoon was a major redesign of the Ventura with the wing area increased from 551 ft2 (51.2 m2) to 686 ft2 (63.7 m2) giving an increased load-carrying capability, and which first flew on 3 December 1943. The motivation for redesign was weaknesses in the PV-1, which had shown itself to have problems in taking off when carrying a full load of fuel. On the PV-2, the armament became standardized at five forward-firing machine guns. Many early PV-1s had a bombardier's position, which was deleted in the PV-2. Some other significant developments included the increase of the bombload by 30% to 4,000 lb (1,800 kg), and the ability to carry eight 5-inch (127 mm) HVAR rockets under the wings. While the PV-2 was expected to have increased range and better takeoff, the anticipated speed statistics were projected lower than those of the PV-1, due to the use of the same engines but an increase in weight. The Navy ordered 500 examples, designating them with the popular name Harpoon. Early tests indicated a tendency for the wings to wrinkle dangerously. As this problem could not be solved by a 6 ft (1.8 m) reduction in wingspan (making the wing uniformly flexible), a complete redesign of the wing was necessitated. This hurdle delayed entry of the PV-2 into service. The PV-2s already delivered were used for training purposes under the designation PV-2C. By the end of 1944, only 69 PV-2s had been delivered. They finally resumed when the redesign was complete. The first aircraft shipped were the PV-2D, which had eight forward-firing machine guns and was used in ground attacks. When World War II ended, all of the order was cancelled. With the wing problems fixed, the PV-2 proved reliable, and eventually popular. It was first used in the Aleutians by VP-139, one of the squadrons that originally used the PV-1. It was used by a number of countries after the war's end, but the United States ceased ordering new PV-2s, and they were all soon retired from service. =Civil conversions= Howard 350 executive conversion of the PV-1 Ex-military PV-1 Venturas from Canada and South Africa were converted by Howard Aero in San Antonio, Texas, in the 1950s and 1960s as high-speed executive transports. The earliest conversions, called Super Venturas, incorporated a 48 in (122 cm) fuselage stretch, extra fuel tankage, large picture windows, luxury interiors, and weapons bays transformed into baggage compartments. The landing gear was swapped for the heavier-duty units from the PV-2. Later conversions, of which eighteen were completed in the 1960s,Marson, 2001, p. 27 were called Howard 350s.Taylor 1965, p.244. At least nineteen PV-1s were further modified, including cabin pressurization under the designation Howard 500.Marson, 2001, p. 26 A final PV-1 modification by Howard was the Eldorado 700, with longer wings, a pointed nose, and streamlined engine cowlings. A notable crash of a civilian version occurred on December 17, 1954, killing four, including Fred Miller, president of the Miller Brewing Company and grandson of founder Frederick Miller. The company plane was bound for Winnipeg, Manitoba, but had trouble with both engines and crashed shortly after takeoff from Mitchell Field in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Also killed were his oldest son, 20-year-old Fred, Jr., and the two company pilots, Joseph and Paul Laird. Oakland Airmotive (later Bay Aviation Services, based in Oakland, California) also offered a PV-2 executive aircraft conversion dubbed Centaurus starting in 1958. The cost of the conversion was $155,000 in addition to the airframe. Operational history=Portuguese Air Force= The Portuguese Air Force received 42 Lockheed PV-2C Harpoons from 1953, which replaced the Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldiver as an anti-submarine aircraft. The Harpoons equipped squadrons 61 and 62 at the Montijo Air Base. In 1960, the Harpoons were replaced as maritime patrol and anti-submarine aircraft by Lockheed P2V-5 Neptunes. The remaining Harpoons were sent to Portuguese Angola and Mozambique, where they formed Squadron 91 operating from Luanda Air Base and Squadron 101 at Beira Air Base. The Harpoons were used on operations in the Angolan and Mozambican theatres of the Portuguese Overseas War (1961‚Äì1974). They served mainly as light bombers and ground attack aircraft, with occasional reconnaissance, transport and maritime patrol sorties. The last Portuguese Harpoons were retired in 1975.CARDOSO, Adelino, Aeronaves Militares Portuguesas no S√©culo XX, Lisbon: Essencial, 2000 The Museu do Ar (Portuguese Air Museum) has what is believed to be the only remaining Lockheed PV-2C Harpoon in Europe. =Royal Air Force= A No. 21 Squadron RAF Ventura attacking IJmuiden, February 1943. The first Ventura Mark Is were accepted by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in September 1941, with aircraft being delivered to Britain from April 1942.Francillon 1982, p. 198.Bowyer 1974, p. 254. By the end of August, enough Venturas had arrived to equip No. 21 Squadron RAF, No. 487 Squadron RNZAF and No. 464 Squadron RAAF.Bowyer 1974, pp. 254‚Äì256. The Ventura flew its first operational mission for the RAF on 3 November 1942, when three Venturas of 21 Squadron attacked railway targets near Hengelo in the Netherlands.Bowyer 1974, p. 261.Carey 2002, p. 12. On 6 December 1942, 47 Venturas from 21, 464 (RAAF) and 487 (RNZAF) squadrons participated in Operation Oyster, the large daylight 2 Group raid against the Philips radio and vacuum tube factories at Eindhoven. Also committed to the raid were 36 Bostons and 10 de Havilland Mosquitos.Bowyer 1974, pp. 263, 266, 273. Carrying incendiaries, they were placed in the third wave of aircraft, and suffered the highest rate of loss. Nine of the 47 Venturas were shot down and many others were damaged by flak or bird strikes. The force also lost four Bostons and one Mosquito.Bowyer 1974, pp. 280, 282. Six months later, on 3 May 1943, Venturas of 487 Squadron RNZAF were sent on Operation Ramrod 16, an attack on a power station in Amsterdam. The squadron was told that the target was of such importance to Dutch morale, that the attack was to be continued regardless of opposition. Significant problems developed with rendezvousing with the escorting fighters, with the end result being that all 10 Venturas that crossed the coast were lost to German fighters. Squadron Leader Leonard Trent, (later the last of the Great Escapers), won the Victoria Cross for his leadership in this raid. The Ventura was never very popular among RAF crews. Although it was faster and carried more than twice as many bombs as its predecessor, the Hudson, it proved unsatisfactory as a bomber. By the summer of 1943, the Ventura had been replaced by the de Havilland Mosquito. The last Ventura raid was flown by 21 Squadron on 9 September 1943. Some Venturas were modified to be used by Coastal Command as the Ventura G.R.I. and 387 PV-1s were used by the RAF as the Ventura G.R.V in the Mediterranean and by Coastal Command. Some RAF aircraft were modified into Ventura C.V transport aircraft. A small number of Venturas were also used in other air forces, including the RCAF, RNZAF and SAAF. =Royal Australian Air Force= In the United Kingdom, No. 464 Squadron RAAF (formed of mixed Commonwealth personnel) at RAF Feltwell in September 1942 to operate the Ventura as part of 2 Group, Bomber Command; it converted to the de Havilland Mosquito in September 1943. In the Mediterranean, No. 459 Squadron RAAF was equipped with the Ventura V between December 1943 to July 1944, flying mainly anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols. In Australia, fifty-five PV-1s were supplied to the RAAF for use in the South West Pacific Area. No. 13 Squadron RAAF was the only operational squadron in Australia equipped with the Ventura. It operated primarily in north-eastern Queensland and then the Northern Territory, and later serving in the Borneo campaign of 1945. After the war, the squadron used its aircraft to help transport liberated prisoners of war. =Royal Canadian Air Force= A total of 157 Ventura G.R. Mk. Vs were used operationally by the RCAF from 16 June 1942 to 18 April 1947 in the home defence coastal patrol role in both Eastern and Western Air Command. They were flown by 8, 113, 115, 145, and 149 Squadrons. A further 21 Ventura Mk. Is and 108 Ventura Mk. IIs were used in a training role at 1 Central Flying School, Trenton, Ontario, and at RCAF Station Pennfield Ridge, New Brunswick (RAF No. 34 Operational Training Unit) as part of the BCATP. A total of 21 Mk. Is, 108 Mk. IIs, and 157 G.R. Mk. Vs were in service during this period for a total of 286 aircraft. =South African Air Force= The SAAF also received some 135 PV-1s, which were used to protect shipping around the Cape of Good Hope and to bomb Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. In December 1942 four SAAF Venturas dropped supplies to survivors of the shipwreck on South-West Africa's Skeleton Coast. Venturas served in the South African Air Force until 1960. =Soviet Air Force= A few US Navy PV-1s force-landed in the Soviet Union after attacking Japanese targets on the Kurile islands and were impounded. Some of them were repaired and pressed into service by the Soviet Air Force where the type became known as the B-34. By December 1944, eight planes were located on airfields on Kamchatka: four were fully airworthy, three were undergoing repairs and one was a write-off. By 1945 seven PV-1s (five of them being airworthy) were used by the Soviets, one plane was the personal liaison aircraft of Ltc M.A. Yeryomin. The planes were used during the Soviet-Japanese campaign in August 1945. After the end of the war only one aircraft remained in service. =Royal New Zealand Air Force= 487 Squadron NCOs at RAF Methwold early 1943 From August 1942, 487 Squadron RNZAF, (operating in Europe as part of the RAF), was equipped with the type, although losses (including on 3 May 1943 the loss of all 11 aircraft attacking Amsterdam), lead to their replacement with the de Havilland Mosquito in June. The Royal New Zealand Air Force in the Pacific received 139 Venturas and some Harpoons from June 1943 to replace Lockheed Hudsons in the maritime patrol bomber and medium bomber roles. Initially Venturas were unpopular with the RNZAF due to rumoured poor performance on one engine, the fate of Squadron Leader Leonard Trent VC of 487 Squadron (above) as well as the failure of the U.S. to provide New Zealand with promised B-24 Liberators. Despite that the RNZAF Venturas came to be among the most widely used of any nation's, seeing substantial action until VJ Day over South West Pacific islands. The first 19 RB-34s that arrived by sea from the U.S. in June had much equipment either missing or damaged. Six airworthy machines were hurriedly produced by cannibalization and sent into action with No. 3 Squadron RNZAF in Fiji. On 26 June the first PV-1s were flown to Whenuapai and No. 1 Squadron RNZAF was able to convert to 18 of these by 1 August, then replacing the mixed 3 Squadron in action at Henderson Field, Guadacanal in late October. By this time No. 2 Squadron RNZAF at Ohakea and No. 9 Squadron RNZAF were also using the type. The following year No. 4 Squadron RNZAF and No. 8 Squadron RNZAF also received Venturas. Some squadrons were retained on garrison duty while others followed the allied advance to Emirau and Green Island and to New Britain. RNZAF Venturas were tasked with routine patrols, anti-shipping strikes, minelaying, bombing and strafing missions, air-sea rescue patrols, and photographic reconnaissance missions. In an apparently bizarre case of taking Lockheed's marketing slogan of The Fighter-Bomber too literally, even briefly, Venturas conducted fighter sweeps. RNZAF machines often clashed with Japanese fighters, notably during an air-sea rescue patrol on Christmas Eve 1943. NZ4509 was attacked by nine Japanese single-engined fighters over St. George's Channel. It shot down three, later confirmed, and claimed two others as probables, although it suffered heavy damage in the action. The pilot, Flying Officer D. Ayson and navigator, Warrant Officer W. Williams, were awarded the DFC. The dorsal turret gunner Flight Sergeant G. Hannah was awarded the DFM. By late 1944 the Ventura began to be phased out of front line action as the RNZAF backed away from the Patrol Bomber concept, orders for PV-2 Harpoons were canceled after a handful of aircraft had been delivered. At VJ Day only 30 PV-1 aircraft remained on the front-line with No. 3 Squadron at Jacquinot Bay. Planned re-equipment with de Havilland Mosquitos did not take place until after the cessation of hostilities. The last Ventura unit was No. 2 Squadron, which continued to operate PV-1 and PV-2 aircraft on meteorological duty until 1948. A restored RNZAF RB-34 (NZ4600) is owned by the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland. =United States Army Air Forces= Some 264 Ventura Mark IIs ordered by the RAF were seized by the U.S. Army Air Forces. Though some were used as anti-submarine patrol bombers under the designation B-34 Lexington, most were used for training with various stateside units. 27 of these were used by the U.S. Navy for anti-submarine patrols as well; these were designated PV-1 Ventura and PV-2 Harpoon. =United States Navy= PV-1s of VPB-147 in the Caribbean in 1944. VPB-136 at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, c.1945‚Äì46 Long range aircraft at Hawkins Field (Tarawa), March 1944 During the early months of 1942, the primary responsibility for anti-submarine warfare in the United States was shouldered by the Army Air Forces. This irked the Navy, as it considered this region of battle its burden. To carry out such a task, the Navy was pursuing a long- range, land-based patrol and reconnaissance aircraft with a substantial bomb load. This goal was always resisted by the Army Air Forces, which carefully protected its monopoly on land-based bombing. This forced the navy to use long-range floatplanes for these roles. The Navy was unable to upgrade to more capable aircraft until the Army Air Forces needed the Navy plant in Renton, Washington to manufacture its Boeing B-29 Superfortress. In exchange for use of the Renton plant, the Army Air Forces would discontinue its objections to Naval land-based bombers, and provide aircraft to the Navy. One of the clauses of this agreement stated that production of the B-34 and B-37 by Lockheed would cease, and instead these resources would be directed at building a navalized version, the PV-1 Ventura. The PV-1 began to be delivered in December 1942, and entered service in February 1943. The first squadron in combat was VP-135, deployed in the Aleutian Islands in April 1943. They were operated by three other squadrons in this theatre. From the Aleutians, they flew strikes against Paramushiro, a Japanese island. Often, PV-1s would lead B-24 bomber formations, since they were equipped with radar. In late 1943, PV-1s were deployed to the Solomon Islands and to the newly captured field at Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands. After the war, the U.S. Navy deemed many PV-1s obsolete and the aircraft were sent to Naval Air Station Clinton, Oklahoma to be demilitarized and reduced to scrap. =Other operators= * Brazil (15 Venturas, 5 Harpoons) * Italy (22 Harpoons) * Japan (17 Harpoons) * Netherlands (18 Harpoons) * Peru (6 Harpoons) Variants One of 18 USAAF B-37s, 1943.

Vaile is currently a non-executive director of a number of public listed corporations. Early life Vaile was born in Sydney and worked as a farm machinery retailer and stock and station and real estate agent before entering politics. He was a member of the Greater Taree City Council 1985‚Äì93, including three years as Deputy Mayor. Parliamentary career Vaile was a member of the Australian House of Representatives between March 1993 and July 2008, representing the Division of Lyne, New South Wales. In his first bid for the seat, in the 1993 election, Vaile led over the Liberals by only 233 votes on the third count, despite the seat's long history as a National stronghold. Labor had taken a large first-count lead which it held for most of the night, but Vaile won after Liberal preferences flowed overwhelmingly to him. However, had 120 votes gone the other way, the Liberals would have taken the seat.http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2008/lyne/ Vaile was able to revert the seat to its traditional status as a safe National seat in 1996, and he would go on to hold the seat without serious difficulty from then onward. He was Assistant National Party Whip 1994‚Äì96 and National Party Whip 1996‚Äì97. In 1997 he was appointed Minister for Transport and Regional Development, and in 1998 he became Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In July 1999, following the resignation of Tim Fischer and the election of John Anderson as National Party leader, he was elected the party's Deputy Leader and became Minister for Trade. When John Anderson resigned in 2005, Vaile was elected Leader unopposed. On 6 July 2005 he was sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister. As Trade Minister, Vaile was involved in the negotiation of the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which was opposed by some traditional National Party constituencies such as the sugar industry. There was much controversy over the intellectual property chapter of the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The chapter contains elements modelled on the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act 1998 (US) and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 (US) In December 2003, Trade Minister Mark Vaile pledged to defend the copyright term in Australia: \\"It is a very important issue, particularly in terms of cost to libraries, educational institutions and the like here in Australia.\\" Two months later, Australia agreed to a copyright term extension, as part of the deal with the United States. There was also much criticism of the adoption of a US-style technological protection measures ‚Äì particularly as the High Court of Australia was considering the matter of Stevens v Sony. There was also controversy over the evergreening of pharmaceutical drug patents and access to essential medicines under the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement. During 2005 he also conducted negotiations for the proposed Australia-China Free Trade Agreement. In late 2005 he had an operation to remove a malignant melanoma from his back. Since Vaile took on the leadership of the Nationals in 2005, there were increasing suggestions for Vaile to take on a domestic portfolio as the trade portfolio requires frequent overseas travel. Throughout 2006, Vaile's position in the trade portfolio came under increasing scrutiny due to his handling of the AWB kickbacks scandal and Australia's worsening trade performance. He also faced the difficult task of placating his back bench, with Queensland Senator Barnaby Joyce having crossed the floor on more than one occasion. On 24 September 2006 he switched portfolios with deputy Nationals leader Warren Truss and became Minister for Transport and Regional Services. His new position had a greater focus on regional Australia, the Nationals party's main constituency. Following the coalition's defeat at the 2007 federal election, Vaile resigned his position as Nationals leader and moved to the backbench. On 19 July 2008 Vaile announced his forthcoming resignation from Parliament; he submitted it on 30 July. The ensuing by-election was won by independent Rob Oakeshott, the former state member for Port Macquarie and a former Vaile staffer. Post-parliament career In September 2008, Vaile was appointed to the board of Virgin Australia Holdings (). He was replaced by Angus Houston in December 2018. Vaile is also the independent chairman and a non-executive director of Whitehaven Coal Limited ; non-executive director of Palisade Investment Partners, a specialist independent infrastructure manager; a non-executive director, appointed by the Australian Hotels Association of HOSTPLUS, an industry superannuation fund; a non-executive director of Servcorp (); a director of the Singapore-listed Stamford Land Corporation (); and Chairman of 123 Childcare, an education provider in the People's Republic of China. Honours On 1 January 2001, he was awarded the Centenary Medal for \\"service as Minister for Trade\\". In 2012 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, through support for rural and regional communities, to the pursuit of global trade and investment opportunities, and to the citizens of the Taree region.

He is known for his work on Marvel Comics' Conan the Barbarian from 1970 to 1973, and for his work on Wolverine ‚Äì particularly the original Weapon X story arc. Early life Barry Windsor-Smith was born Barry Smith on 25 May 1949 in Forest Gate, a working class area in the East End of London. He displayed artistic abilities at an early age, and his parents supported in pursuing an education in the arts. He attended East Ham Technical College for three years, earning degrees in Industrial Design and Illustration. Career Windsor-Smith produced his first published work in 1967 and 1968 ‚Äì single page \\"Powerhouse Pinups\\" of Marvel Comics characters for Terrific and Fantastic comics, titles published by Odhams Press that included licensed Marvel Comics reprints for the UK market. Following this, he flew to the U.S. in summer 1968 with fellow artist Steve Parkhouse for meetings at Marvel in New York. \\"I sent material first, and based solely upon a pleasant return note from Stan [Lee]'s assistant Linda Fite, my pal and me were at Marvel's doorstep in the blink of an eye.\\" Largely due to his Jack Kirbyesque style,Windsor-Smith in Cooke (1998): \\"Stan loved my stuff because although it was pretty amateur and klutzy, it had the essence of Jack Kirby about it, and that was what sold Marvel comics in those days.\\" Marvel Comics Editor Stan Lee gave him the job of drawing both the cover and story of X-Men No. 53 (cover-dated Feb. 1969), credited to Barry Smith as he was then known. and He drew Marvel's Daredevil #50‚Äì52 (March‚ÄìMay 1969), a Western short story, \\"Half Breed\\" (probably the story \\"Outcast\\" eventually published in Western Gunfighters No. 4, Feb. 1971),Western Gunfighters #4 (Feb. 1971) at the Grand Comics Database: Special note at the end states \\"This strip was conceived by Roy Thomas and executed by Smith and Parkhouse nearly Two Years ago!\\" and issue #12 of Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (May 1968), both scripted by Parkhouse. Windsor-Smith later called his early art \\"amateur and klutzy\\" and a \\"less than skillful\\" Kirby imitation, but Stan Lee liked it enough to give him more work. Despite this, Roy Thomas assigned him issues No. 66 and No. 67 of The Avengers (July‚ÄìAug. 1969) after he had returned to the UK. These stories introduced the fictitious indestructible metal alloy adamantium. He continued to work at a distance for Marvel, providing the art for a number of stories in the horror anthology titles Tower of Shadows and Chamber of Darkness. Thomas, a long-time fan of Robert E. Howard's 1930 pulp-fiction character Conan the Barbarian, had Windsor-Smith provide art for a sword and sorcery story, \\"Starr the Slayer\\", in Chamber of Darkness No. 4 (April 1970). Soon afterwards, Thomas offered Windsor-Smith the job as penciller for Marvel's adaptation of Conan, starting with Conan the Barbarian No. 1 (Oct. 1970).Sanderson, Peter \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 146: \\"Writer Roy Thomas and British artist Barry Smith (later known as Barry Windsor-Smith) launched Marvel's sword-and-sorcery comics with Conan the Barbarian, in a series that ran for 275 issues.\\" In 1971, Windsor-Smith moved to the United States, having been granted a work permit. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Windsor-Smith's \\"initial efforts were slightly sketchy, but his technique progressed by leaps and bounds. Within a few months he had achieved a style never seen in comics before.\\" During his run on Conan the Barbarian, Windsor-Smith was involved in the writing as well.Windsor-Smith in Cooke (1998): \\"I was always plotting my own stories right from the beginning...To give the scripter some clue as to what was going on, I would write my own dialogue on the edge of the pages. Some scripters would use my dialogue, others would wilfully ignore it. In either case I was never paid or credited for the work. Some of the more amusing dialogue in Conan came from me, Jenna telling Conan he looks like a yak with that dumb helmet he used to wear; the slow-dawn on Conan's face as he realizes he gotten involved with a wizard again. 'Sorcery? No one said aught of sorcery [when I signed on for this war]!' Roy was good at picking up the better stuff and letting others go.\\" He and writer Roy Thomas adapted a number of R.E. Howard short stories, the aforementioned \\"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\\", \\"Tower of the Elephant\\", \\"Rogues in the House\\", and \\"Red Nails\\". As well as the art and story contributions, Windsor-Smith provided the covers for most issues. They worked on original adventures and characters based on R.E. Howard's characters ‚Äì most notably the flame-haired warrior-woman, Red Sonja ‚Äì loosely based on a character from one of Howard's non-Conan stories, who has now become a major comics character in her own right ‚Äì in \\"The Song of Red Sonja\\" in Conan the Barbarian No. 24 (March 1973), Windsor-Smith's last issue of the title. By then he had worked on 21 of the first 24 issues of the series, missing only issues No. 17 and No. 18, and No. 22 (which was a reprint of issue #1), and both he and the title had won a number of awards. Windsor-Smith would later say that the reason he missed those issues was because he had quit the series a number of times as he was dissatisfied with the work and how the comics business worked, rather than the deadline problems Marvel quoted. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Thomas and Windsor-Smith's work on Conan the Barbarian seventh on its list of the \\"Top 10 1970s Marvels\\". Windsor-Smith provided the art for a number of other Marvel Comics titles, including the Ka-Zar stories in Astonishing Tales #3‚Äì6 (December 1970 ‚Äì June 1971) and No. 10 (February 1972),Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 147 three further issues of The Avengers (#98‚Äì100, April‚ÄìJune 1972) ‚Äì about which he would later remember the nightmare of drawing \\"all those bloody characters that I didn't give tuppence about\\", Iron Man No. 47 (June 1972), and Marvel Premiere #3‚Äì4 (July‚ÄìSeptember 1972), which featured Doctor Strange,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 156: \\"Dr. Strange began a new series of solo adventures. He got off to an impressive start with this story scripted by Stan Lee and illustrated by Barry Windsor-Smith.\\" both of which were apparently re-scripted by Stan Lee after being drawn to Lee's original scripts. Windsor-Smith was by now becoming disillusioned with the comics industry and the way in which in his opinion the writers and artists were being exploited: \\"I needed to be free of constraints and policies that were imposed by the dictates of creating entertainment for children\\" Shortly thereafter, Windsor-Smith left comics for the first time, leaving only a couple of inventory items in the Marvel Comics vaults, both stories of R.E. Howard characters: Kull in \\"Exile of Atlantis\\" (Savage Sword of Conan No. 3, December 1974), and Bran Mak Morn in \\"Worms of the Earth\\" (Savage Sword of Conan No. 16, November 1975). Other than ten pages of inking of Jack Kirby pencil work for Captain America's Bicentennial Battles (1976),Marvel Treasury Special Featuring Captain America's Bicentennial Battles #1 at the Grand Comics Database a one-off oversize Marvel Treasury Edition, he produced no more comics work until 1983. At this point he changed his professional surname to Windsor-Smith, adding his mother's surname to his own, and began to pursue a career in fine art. Granted residential status in the United States in 1974, Windsor-Smith, along with his partner Linda Lessman, set up Gorblimey Press, through which he released a small number of limited-edition prints of fantasy-based subjects that proved popular. In 1976 Windsor-Smith published The Gorblimey Press Catalogue, a high quality index to the work published by Gorblimey Press, with full-page reproductions of each piece. Prior to that, in 1975, together with Jeff Jones, Michael Kaluta, and Bernie Wrightson, he was one of four comic book artists-turned-fine- illustrator/painters who formed a small artist's loft commune in Manhattan known as The Studio, with the aim of pursuing creative products outside the constraints of comic book commercialism. By 1979 they had produced enough material to issue an art book under the name The Studio, which was published by Dragon's Dream (). =1980s= Smith designed and drew the fictitious comic strip \\"Mandro\\" for the 1981 Oliver Stone horror film The Hand. In the film, the artwork is used as that of character Jon Lansdale, a comic book illustrator played by Michael Caine. Stone explains the hiring of Smith thus: > I'd always been a fan of his. I think I fell in love with his version of > Conan before I had even read the Howard books. He did more for that comic > than anyone‚Ä¶Since the cartoonist was drawing a Conan-type character, Barry > was the logical choice. Oddly enough, Barry was English, as was Michael, and > they both have sandy blond hair. When they first met, they discovered that > they're both about 6' 2\\", and that they both have the same sort of East End > wit. The similarity was quite amazing. Windsor-Smith returned to mainstream comics work for Marvel in 1983 with two pieces, a short mystical tale of love, \\"The Beguiling\\", and a dark, humorous two-page black-and-white story, \\"A Path of Stars\\", both in Epic Illustrated No. 16 (February 1983), which featured a page-and-a-half Windsor-Smith spread accompanying an Archie Goodwin text story called \\"The Horde\\" (which appears to be a drawing of Conan and Valeria in battle). Later the same year he produced a short piece in Dave Sim's Swords of Cerebus (#5, 1983), followed in 1984 by several Marvel superhero stories: an untitled story, though usually referred to as \\"that night...\\", and an April Fool's story of The Thing in Marvel Fanfare No. 15 (July 1984), which he wrote and drew. He illustrated \\"Lifedeath\\" a double-sized Storm story in The Uncanny X-Men No. 186 (October 1984), and a four-issue Machine Man limited series (October 1984 ‚Äì January 1985),DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 219: \\"Machine Man was a living robot who was relaunched in 1984 by Tom DeFalco, Herb Trimpe, and Barry Windsor-Smith.\\" for which Windsor-Smith was artist and colourist over Herb Trimpe layouts for the first three issues, and drew and coloured alone for the fourth. Although he would return to the X-Men once a year for the next three years, (Uncanny X-Men No. 198, #205 and #214), his mainstream comics output remained limited throughout the rest of the 1980s, amounting to just one issue each of Fantastic Four (#296, November 1986) and Daredevil (#236, November 1986), two issues of Iron Man (#232, July 1988 and No. 243, June 1989), two pages for DC Comics' Heroes Against Hunger benefit project, and two small pieces for the Harvey Award-winning comics anthology A1 published by Atomeka Press. In 1987 he returned to his first major success and provided new painted covers for nine issues of Marvel's Conan reprint title The Conan Saga, all issues which contained black-and-white reprints of his original 1970s stories. =1990s= Together with the X-Men spinoff Excalibur (#27, September 1990), Windsor-Smith's last work for Marvel Comics came with the serialised Weapon X feature in Marvel Comics Presents #72‚Äì84 (1991),Manning, Matthew K. \\"1990s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 252: \\"It was not until Barry Windsor-Smith wrote and illustrated the thirteen-chapter Weapon X serial that fans really sat up and paid attention [to the Marvel Comics Presents series].\\" his telling of the origin of the X-Men character Wolverine which he wrote, drew, inked, coloured, and co-lettered. In late 1991, he was approached by Valiant Comics, a new comics publisher founded by former Marvel Comics writer and editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, and asked to act as their creative director and lead artist. Valiant had obtained the licenses for a number of characters originally published in the 1960s and 1970s by Gold Key Comics: Magnus Robot Fighter, Doctor Solar and Turok Dinosaur Hunter, and added their own original titles to the roster, including Harbinger, X-O Manowar, Shadowman, Archer and Armstrong, Eternal Warrior, Bloodshot, Ninjak, and Rai. Windsor-Smith was the chief designer of the \\"Unity\\" crossover storyline for Valiant Comics, and writer and artist for most of the first dozen issues of the title Archer and Armstrong. By focusing on storytelling and innovative marketing practices such as a tightly knit continuity, crossovers and send away issues Valiant quickly became a considerable success story, selling nearly two million copies of premiere issues and rapidly becoming the third largest comics publisher in the US, behind the long-time industry leaders Marvel and DC Comics. However, in 1993 Windsor-Smith once again found himself in opposition to company employment policies when Valiant decided to adopt the same work for hire practices that he had disliked in Marvel Comics, and became dissatisfied with his position in the company: \\"They needed me as a figurehead just as much as a creator.\\" He left Valiant soon after Jim Shooter's departure from the company. Smith has called work-for-hire contracts \\"a legal but unethical instrument designed to rape and plunder young talents of every possible prerogative they would otherwise possess if they had the fortune to work for more scrupulous, morally invested, publishers.\\" Of his work for Valiant, and the problems he encountered there over legal ownership of titles and characters, Windsor-Smith said in 2008, \\"In the 1970s I was constantly asked when I would 'do Conan again'. In these latter years I receive e-mails imploring me to return to Archer and Armstrong. My short reply is, 'When pigs fly to the Moon and return home safely. Since leaving Valiant, Windsor-Smith has worked for a number of companies. For Malibu's Ultraverse line he co-created Rune with Chris Ulm, including a crossover one-shot comic titled Conan vs. Rune published by Marvel Comics in 1994 after they took over Malibu. As a result he once again came up against legal ownership problems, and the Rune stories have remained un- reprinted as a result. For Image Comics he worked on the crossover storyline \\"Wildstorm Rising\\", drawing and colouring Wildstorm Rising No. 1 (May 1995), and all eleven of the covers for the interlinked series. Windsor-Smith later said that he was talked into illustrating Wildstorm Rising, and regretted participating in it, stating that in reading the story and illustrating it, he could not understand the motivations of any of the characters, even when he read earlier Wildstorm books featuring the characters. He says he altered the plot in an attempt to improve it and his enthusiasm for it, later learning that writer James Robinson was not pleased with his doing so. In 1995 Windsor- Smith created an oversized anthology series, Barry Windsor-Smith: Storyteller for Dark Horse Comics that contained three ongoing features: \\"The Paradoxman\\", a dark science-fiction tale, \\"Young GODS\\", a homage to Jack Kirby's Thor and New Gods series, and \\"The Freebooters\\", a lighthearted action series about an ageing Conan-like character grown older and heavier and now running a tavern. He cancelled Storyteller after nine issues, even though a tenth issue had been completed; since then Fantagraphics Books has issued hardcover collections of \\"Young GODS\\" and \\"The Freebooters\\". Each of these hardcover volumes includes supplemental features, essays and previously unseen art. Fantagraphics has published Windsor-Smith's Adastra in Africa, a hardcover starring a character from \\"Young GODS\\" in a story originally intended to be published as \\"Lifedeath III\\" for Marvel's X-Men, with the character Storm. In 1999 Fantagraphics published two volumes of BWS ‚Äì Opus, a hardcover art books featuring Windsor- Smith's work from throughout his career, including an autobiographical story, \\"Time Rise\\", which features details of his experiences with seemingly paranormal phenomena. =2000s= Windsor-Smith created a story called \\"UFO POV,\\" an 11-page story in Streetwise (July 2000), a trade paperback anthology published by TwoMorrows Publishing. In 2000 and 2001 he also produced cover art for a number of Marvel titles including Grant Morrison's New X-Men, and drew five pages of Wolverine #166 (Sept. 2001), a \\"Weapon X\\" tie-in written by Frank Tieri. In January 2004, Fantagraphics Books published Windsor-Smith's Young Gods and Friends, a hardcover collecting material from BWS Storyteller along with new material. November 2005 saw a follow-up hardcover titled The Freebooters, again collecting material from BWS Storyteller with new material. A planned third and final volume, collecting \\"The Paradoxman\\" serial, has not yet been released. In January 2006, Windsor-Smith announced on the website Comic Book Galaxy that he was in negotiations to publish a graphic novel for Marvel Comics starring The Thing. He was working on a Superman story in 1999 that has not yet seen print. He has produced no further work in mainstream comics since that announcement, and nothing has been produced by Gorblimey Press since the print \\"Liberomano\\" in 1993 .Monsters, a graphic novel which \\"explores the life and times of two disparate American families fatefully connected by an abandoned Nazi project in genetic engineering that has been covertly revived by the US government\\" has been in the works since the 1980s and is slated for release in 2021 by Fantagraphics.https://fantagraphics.com/flog/bwsmonsters/  Awards  *1970 ‚Äì Academy of Comic Book Arts Shazam Awards Best Individual Story (\\"Lair of the Beast Men,\\" by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith, from Conan the Barbarian #2) (nominated) *1971 ‚Äì Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards Best Continuing Feature (Conan the Barbarian) (winner) *1971 ‚Äì Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards Best Individual Story (\\"Devil Wings over Shadizar,\\" by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith, from Conan the Barbarian No. 6 and \\"Tower of the Elephant,\\" by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith, from Conan the Barbarian #4) (nominated) *1972 ‚Äì Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards Best Individual Story Dramatic (\\"The Black Hound of Vengeance,\\" by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith, from Conan the Barbarian #20) (nominated) *1973 ‚Äì Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards Best Continuing Feature (Conan the Barbarian) (nominated) *1973 ‚Äì Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards Best Individual Story Dramatic (\\"Song of Red Sonja,\\" by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith, from Conan the Barbarian #24) (winner) * 1973 ‚Äî Goethe Award Favorite Pro Artist (winner) *1973 ‚Äì British Fantasy Society Awards Best Comic (Conan the Barbarian) (winner) *1974 ‚Äì Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards Best Individual Story Dramatic (\\"Red Nails,\\" by Roy Thomas and Barry Smith, from Savage Tales #1‚Äì3) (nominated) *1974 ‚Äì Shazam Award for Superior Achievement by an Individual (nominated) *1974 ‚Äì British Fantasy Society Awards Best Comic (Conan the Barbarian) (winner) *1975 ‚Äì Inkpot Award (winner) *1975 ‚Äì British Fantasy Society Awards Best Comic (The Savage Sword of Conan) (winner) *1976 ‚Äì British Fantasy Society Awards Best Comic (The Savage Sword of Conan) (winner) *1977 ‚Äì Eagle Awards Favourite Comicbook Artist (nominated) *1985 ‚Äì Haxtur Awards Best Long Story (Machine Man) (nominated) *1985 ‚Äì Haxtur Awards Best Drawing (Machine Man) (nominated) *1990 ‚Äì Gem Award for Outstanding Service and Product Best Comic under $3 (Deathmate Prologue) (nominated) *1993 ‚Äì UK Comic Art Awards Best New Feature (Archer & Armstrong) *1997 ‚Äì Comics' Buyer's Guide Favorite Colorist (nominated) *1997 ‚Äì Harvey Award Best New Series (Barry Windsor-Smith: Storyteller) (nominated) *1998 ‚Äì Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Awards Favorite Colorist (nominated) *2008 ‚Äì Eisner Awards Hall of Fame (winner) Bibliography=DC Comics= *Batman 3-D graphic novel (one page pinup) (1990) *Heroes Against Hunger No. 1 (1986) *Sandman Special No. 1 (one page pinup) (1991) *Superman Special No. 1 (one page pinup) (1992) =Marvel Comics= *Astonishing Tales (Ka-Zar): #3‚Äì6, 10 (1971‚Äì72) *Avengers #66‚Äì67, 98‚Äì100 (1969‚Äì72) *Chamber of Darkness #3‚Äì4 (1970) *Conan the Barbarian #1‚Äì16, 19‚Äì24 (1970‚Äì73) *Conan vs. Rune No. 1 (1995) *Daredevil #50‚Äì52, 236 (1969‚Äì1986) *Epic Illustrated No. 7, 16, 19, 34 (1981‚Äì86) *Excalibur No. 27 (1990) *Fantastic Four No. 296 (among other artists) (1986) *Iron Man No. 47, 232, 243 (1972‚Äì1989) *Machine Man, miniseries, #1‚Äì4 (1984‚Äì85) *Marvel Comics Presents (Weapon X): #72‚Äì84 (1991) *Marvel Fanfare (The Thing) No. 15 (1984) *Marvel Premiere (Doctor Strange) #3‚Äì4 (1972) *Marvel Treasury Special Featuring Captain America's Bicentennial Battles (co-inker) (1976) *Monsters on the Prowl No. 9 (1971) *Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

A multiple Grammy nominee, Murphey has six gold albums, including Cowboy Songs, the first album of cowboy music to achieve gold status since Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs by Marty Robbins in 1959. He has recorded the hit singles \\"Wildfire\\", \\"Carolina in the Pines\\", \\"What's Forever For\\", \\"A Long Line of Love\\", \\"What She Wants\\", \\"Don't Count the Rainy Days\\", and \\"Maybe This Time\\". Murphey is also the author of New Mexico's state ballad, \\"The Land of Enchantment\\". Murphey has become a prominent musical voice for the Western horseman, rancher, and cowboy. Early life Michael Martin Murphey was born on March 14, 1945, to Pink Lavary Murphey and Lois (n√©e Corbett) Murphey, in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, Texas, where he grew up. He has a brother, Mark, who is three years younger. When he was six years old he started riding horses on his grandfather's and uncle's ranches. Years later he would remember sleeping on his grandfather's porch under the stars, listening to the older man's stories and cowboy songs. He enjoyed being around these men of the land as they went about their work. These experiences made a deep impression on the young boy.Robinson, Lana. \\"Michael Martin Murphey\\" in Texas Agriculture (September 2, 2005). During these early years, he developed a special love for cowboy songs and stories. He was also an avid reader, especially drawn to the books of Mark Twain and William Faulkner. As a youth, he enjoyed writing poetry and loved listening to his uncle's old 78 rpm records, particularly the music of country and folk artists such as Hank Williams, Bob Wills, and Woody Guthrie. In junior high school he began performing as an amateur, and later as a camp counselor at a summer camp called Sky Ranch. At the age of seventeen, he took his first \\"professional\\" music job, playing western songs around a campfire at a Texas ranch. By the early 1960s, Murphey was playing the clubs in Dallas, performing country music, folk music, and rock music. He won over the conservative Texas audiences with his charm and talent, and soon formed a band that developed a significant following in the Dallas area. Songwriting success After graduating from W. H. Adamson High School in Oak Cliff, Murphey studied Greek at the University of North Texas. As a member of the institution's Folk Music Club, he befriended Steven Fromholz, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Shiva's Headband fiddler Spencer Perskin and Armadillo World Headquarters co-founder Eddie Wilson. Murphey then moved to California, where he studied creative writing and majored in medieval history and literature at the University of California, Los Angeles. He signed a publishing contract with the Sparrow Music company, and soon he made a name for himself in the Los Angeles folk music scene. By 1964, he formed a musical group with an old Texas friend, Michael Nesmith, John London, and John Raines, under the name the Trinity River Boys. Murphey's first big break came through his friend Michael Nesmith, who had become part of the popular television musical group, The Monkees. Nesmith asked Murphey to write them a song for the next Monkees album, and Murphey composed \\"What Am I Doing Hangin' Round\\". The album Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. sold over five million copies. Murphey formed the Lewis & Clarke Expedition with Boomer Castleman, and recorded one self- titled album for Colgems Records, the company that also released the Monkees' LPs. They had a modest hit with \\"I Feel Good (I Feel Bad)\\". Boomer Castleman went on to find success with his controversial song \\"Judy Mae\\" and as the writer and producer of the million selling novelty hit \\"Telephone Man\\" for singer Meri Wilson. In 1968, Murphey moved to Wrightwood, a village in the San Gabriel Mountains adjacent to the Mojave Desert of California to work on his songwriting. Based on the success of his songs, he signed a contract with the Screen Gems company, the publishing arm of Columbia Pictures. Some of his songs were recorded by Flatt and Scruggs and Bobbie Gentry. Kenny Rogers and the First Edition recorded an entire album of Michael Murphey songs called The Ballad of Calico, about a Mojave Desert ghost town. Murphey wrote some additional songs for The Monkees, but he grew disillusioned with the poor financial rewards and the Southern California music scene.  Austin/Outlaw country years  In 1971, Murphey returned to Texas and became part of the so- called Outlaw country movement, playing alongside other maverick performers such as Willie Nelson and Jerry Jeff Walker. He created a unique sound that combined his country, rock, and folk influences. It was during this period that Murphey co-wrote \\"Geronimo's Cadillac\\" with the lyricist Charles John Quarto,Charles John Quarto a song about Native American rights that later became an unofficial anthem for the American Indian Movement in the early 1970s. In 1971, Murphey was signed to A&M; Records by Bob Johnston, who discovered him in a Dallas club, the Rubaiyat. Johnston had produced some of the country's most popular recording artists, including Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, and Simon and Garfunkel. In 1972, Johnston produced Murphey's first album Geronimo's Cadillac in Nashville, Tennessee. The sound of the album reflects Murphey's love of country, folk, and blues music. Murphey's early gospel influences are also evident throughout the album. The title track was released as a single, and reached the Top 40 on the US pop charts. In addition to the title track, the album included \\"Boy from the Country\\", \\"What Am I Doin' Hangin' Around?\\", and \\"Michael Angelo's Blues\\". Rolling Stone magazine proclaimed, \\"On the strength of his first album alone, Michael Murphey is the best new songwriter in the country.\\" In 1973, Murphey followed up with the album Cosmic Cowboy Souvenir, which continued the urban cowboy theme of the first album. The album included \\"Cosmic Cowboy, Pt. 1\\", \\"Alleys of Austin\\", and \\"Rolling Hills\\". Throughout this period, Murphey's band included Bob Livingston and Gary P. Nunn, the author of \\"London Homesick Blues\\". He performed a number of times at the Armadillo World Headquarters, and his photo was even used for the original cover of Jan Reid's book, The Improbable Rise of Redneck Rock.News reports at the time suggested that Murphey was upset that his image was used on the book's cover, and his photo was removed in subsequent editions. But Michael Murphey's musical vision was expanding beyond the confines of the outlaw country sound and moving toward a much more ambitious musical tapestry. \\"Wildfire\\" and the Epic years In 1973, Murphey signed to Epic Records and released the album Michael Murphey that same year. Produced by Bob Johnston, the album included the orchestra anthem \\"Nobody's Gonna Tell Me How To Play My Music\\", and \\"Southwestern Pilgrimage\\". In 1975, Murphey released his seminal album, Blue Sky ‚Äì Night Thunder, also produced by Bob Johnston. The album generated two hit singles: \\"Carolina in the Pines\\" and his Platinum-certified signature song \\"Wildfire\\", a sentimental song about the ghosts of a woman and her horse. As a boy, he first heard from his grandfather the story of a ghost horse rescuing people in the desert. Years later, Murphey had a dream about this ghost horse and wrote the words and music the same day with songwriter Larry Cansler. In the summer of 1975, \\"Wildfire\\" became a chart-topping hit, reaching No. 2 in Cash Box and No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary charts, giving Murphey a new level of commercial success and exposure. It immediately sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in July 1975. It eventually surpassed two million in US sales and was awarded a platinum disc by the R.I.A.A. in September 2001. The song's harmonies were supplied by Jeff Hanna and Jimmy Ibbotson from the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and the piano introduction and ending coda played by jazz pianist Jac Murphy.Profile , westernjubilee.com; accessed March 14, 2017. The introduction is based on a piece by the Russian classical composer Alexander Scriabin. During the late 1970s, he recorded four albums: Swans Against the Sun (1976), Flowing Free Forever (1976), Lone Wolf (1978), and Peaks, Valleys, Honky Tonks & Alleys (1979). The album Swans Against the Sun produced his first country hits \\"A Mansion on the Hill\\" and \\"Cherokee Fiddle\\", which also became a top ten hit for Johnny Lee. Murphey's friends, John Denver, Willie Nelson, Charlie Daniels, and Steve Weisberg appeared on the album. In 1981, Murphey made his first film appearance in Hard Country, which he cowrote. To distinguish himself from actor Michael Murphy, the singer began using his middle name for film and music credits. To this day, he is known as Michael Martin Murphey.Michael Murphy the actor co-starred with Woody Allen in several films, including Annie Hall and Manhattan. Mainstream success In 1982, Murphey signed with Liberty Records and produced two original albums, Michael Martin Murphey and The Heart Never Lies, as well as a compilation of re-recorded versions of his A&M;, Epic, and Liberty hits called The Best of Michael Martin Murphey. In the early 1980s, Murphey had significant commercial success with hits like \\"Still Taking Chances\\", \\"Disenchanted\\", \\"Don't Count the Rainy Days\\", \\"Will It Be Love by Morning\\", \\"Radio Land\\", \\"Maybe This Time\\", and the number one hit \\"What's Forever For\\", written by Rafe Van Hoy, which also crossed over to number three at AC Radio and number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 Pop Singles Chart. In 1983, Murphey was voted Best New Male Vocalist of the Year by the Academy of Country Music. In 1985, his rerecorded version of \\"Carolina in the Pines\\" reached the Top 10. In 1985, Murphey signed a new recording contract with Warner Bros. Records and continued his streak of successful recordings. In 1986, he released the album Tonight We Ride, which included \\"Rollin' Nowhere\\", \\"Fiddlin' Man\\", and \\"Sante Fe Cantina\\". In 1987, he released the album Americana, which included \\"Once Upon a Time\\", \\"My Darling Wherever You Are\\", and another number one country hit with the song \\"A Long Line of Love\\". That same album produced the hit single \\"A Face in the Crowd\\" with Holly Dunn, which was nominated for a Grammy Award. In 1988, Murphey released the album River of Time, which produced three hit singles that reached number three on the charts: Jesse Winchester's \\"I'm Going to Miss You, Girl\\", his own \\"From the Word Go\\", and \\"Talkin' to the Wrong Man\\", which featured his son Ryan. In 1989, Murphey closed out a successful decade of recording with the album Land of Enchantment, which contained \\"Never Givin' Up on Love\\", \\"Got to Pay the Fiddler\\", \\"Route 66\\", and \\"Land of Enchantment\\", which became New Mexico's state ballad. Cowboy songs Despite the impressive critical and commercial success he achieved throughout the 1980s, Murphey's authentic creativity began to gravitate towards the Western music that appealed to him as a child coming of age in Texas. As early as 1985, Murphey performed with the New Mexico Symphony in a show called A Night in the American West, which led to many subsequent performances with American and Canadian symphonies, including the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington, D.C. These western shows, and the songs he was writing and recording at the time, presaged a major change in Murphey's career. In 1990, he released the album Cowboy Songs. The album contained Murphey's versions of old cowboy songs from the public domain such as \\"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\\", \\"The Old Chisholm Trail\\", the beautiful \\"Spanish is the Loving Tongue\\", the classic \\"The Streets of Laredo\\", and his tip of the hat to Roy Rogers, \\"Happy Trails\\". The album contained Murphey's own \\"Cowboy Logic\\". Murphey was reluctant to promote the project, but he eventually released \\"Cowboy Logic\\" as a single and it quickly became a hit. Soon after, the album caught on and sold much better than expected. Cowboy Songs earned widespread praise from country and folk music critics, such as Jack Hurst from the Chicago Tribune who wrote, \\"[This is] not only one of the finest albums of [the] year but also one of the finest of the last decade. Its 22 riveting cuts represent a labor of not only love but also scholarship; it raises a cult musical genre to the level of mainstream art.\\" Cowboy Songs went on to achieve Gold status, the first western album to do so since Marty Robbins' No. 1 Cowboy in 1980. In 1991, Murphey followed up with two additional albums of cowboy songs. His innovative concept album, Cowboy Christmas: Cowboy Songs II, contained versions of traditional and original western Christmas songs, including \\"The Christmas Trail,\\" \\"The Cowboy Christmas Ball,\\" and \\"Two-Step 'Round the Christmas Tree\\". An accompanying video was later released of one of Murphey's Cowboy Christmas Ball concerts, which included many of these songs. Cowboy Songs III contained a mix of traditional and original cowboy songs, including a virtual duet with Marty Robbins, \\"Big Iron,\\" which used an early Marty Robbins' vocal track. Cowboy Songs and its follow-up albums were so successful that they inspired the formation of Warner Western, a new subsidiary label of Warner Bros. Records devoted to western music and cowboy poetry. In 1992, Warner Western issued albums by Don Edwards, Waddie Mitchell, and the Sons of the San Joaquin. All three records were produced by Murphey. In 1995, Murphey further demonstrated his musical ambitions with the concept album Sagebrush Symphony, recorded live with the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra, Herb Jeffries, and the Sons of the San Joaquin. In 1997, he released the album The Horse Legends, a musical tribute to this majestic animal. The album included several new Murphey songs, a new version of \\"Wildfire\\", and covers of some well-known songs, such as Dan Fogelberg's \\"Run for the Roses\\" and Gordon Lightfoot's \\"The Pony Man\\". In 1998, Murphey left Warner Bros. Records and started his own record label, WestFest/Real West Productions. That year, he released Cowboy Songs Four, which contained both traditional and original cowboy songs, including \\"Utah Carroll,\\" \\"Little Joe, the Wrangler,\\" and Murphey's \\"Song from Lonesome Dove\\". In 1999, he released Acoustic Christmas Carols: Cowboy Christmas II, which included Murphey's quiet renditions of traditional Christmas songs, and featured his son Ryan and daughter Laura. In 2001, Murphey released a compilation of some of his best-loved songs, Playing Favorites, which included rerecorded versions of such songs as \\"Carolina in the Pines,\\" \\"Cherokee Fiddle,\\" \\"Cowboy Logic,\\" \\"What's Forever For,\\" and \\"Wildfire\\". He followed this up in 2002 with Cowboy Classics: Playing Favorites II, which again included re-recorded versions of some of his best-loved cowboy songs. That same year, Murphey released Cowboy Christmas III, which contained a new original song \\"The Kill Pen,\\" as well as original cowboy poetry written and recited by his daughter Karen. In 2004, Murphey released Live at Billy Bob's Texas, and in 2006, he released Heartland Cowboy: Cowboy Songs, Vol. 5. Murphey has championed Western cowboy culture and the wilderness. In 1986 he founded WestFest, an annual music festival held at Copper Mountain, Colorado that celebrates western art and culture. Molly Carpenter, writing in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, noted, \\"Murphey's love for the American West clearly comes through in his songs, painted with vivid images of the rugged mountains and vast deserts of southwest landscapes, all evidence of his travels from his native Texas to California's Mojave Desert, Colorado's Rockies and the wild diversity of New Mexico, his home for the past 10 years.\\"Carpenter, Molly. Richmond Times-Dispatch During the 1990s, in a further effort to preserve the traditions of the West, Murphey led a group of performers‚Äîincluding cowboy poet Waddie Mitchell and western music historian and troubadour Don Edwards ‚Äî in a series of improvisational concerts called Cowboy Logic, which toured throughout the United States, including such unlikely locations as New York City and Las Vegas. Waddy Mitchell is the co-founder of the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering. Murphey met Mitchell there in 1986, the first such event he had ever attended. He later described the transforming event as \\"a religious experience ... I'd been collecting cowboy music and performing it among my friends. But when I saw a lot of other guys like me and also women performing this music and enjoying each other's company, it was the most important thing that had happened to me in years in my musical life.\\"Holden, Stephen. \\"Pop/Jazz; Cowboy Revue in the Sky At Rainbow and Stars\\" in The New York Times, May 22, 1992. On May 22, 2007, he made a rare appearance in New York City to perform \\"Wildfire\\" on the Late Show with David Letterman. The song had become one of Letterman's favorites and was included regularly on the show. That same month, Murphey organized and performed for John Wayne's 100th Birthday Celebration, with the approval of the John Wayne Family. Murphey was commended by the White House for his activities. Later that year, he released three DVDs detailing his love of the cowboy ways, life, and preservation of the American West traditions. The DVDs document his trail rides, cattle drives, and Cowboy Poetry gatherings. One of Murphey's Cowboy Christmas Ball concerts, recorded in Oklahoma City, was included as a fourth DVD in the combination CD/DVD set. In December 2007, Murphey released \\"A Soldier's Christmas\\" based on a poem by Michael E. Marks, a soldier serving in Iraq. Marks sent the poem to Murphey, who was so moved by the poem he sought permission to set it to music, which he did. He started including the song in all his concerts, including his Cowboy Christmas Ball concerts, to long standing ovations after its performance, which prompted its release in December 2007. Bluegrass years Michael Martin Murphey at the Sportsman's Texaco in Lake City, Colorado, July 2, 2009 In February 2009, Murphey released Buckaroo Blue Grass, which marked a return to his bluegrass musical roots. Murphey's love of Bluegrass music dates back to when he sang lead vocals with the Earl Scruggs Band. Over the years, his songs have been recorded by Bluegrass artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver, the Country Gentlemen, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. On Buckaroo Bluegrass, Murphey offers new versions of his famous Bluegrass songs, such as \\"Carolina in the Pines\\", \\"Fiddlin' Man\\", \\"Lost River\\", and \\"What Am I Doing Hanging Around\\". Murphey also includes new Bluegrass versions of several of his classics, such as \\"Boy from the Country\\", \\"Dancing in the Meadow\\", and \\"Healing Spring\\". The album includes two new songs, \\"Close to the Land\\", the theme song of the PBS documentary television series America's Heartland, and \\"Lone Cowboy\\", a song that reflects Murphey's experiences as a solo artist performing throughout the West at music festivals, cowboy gatherings, historical theaters, and trail rides. Michael's son, Ryan, produced the album, and added acoustic guitar and vocals. In February 2010, Murphey released a follow-up album, Buckaroo Blue Grass II ‚Äì Riding Song, which follows the production approach of the first album. In May 2011, Murphey gave a benefit concert at the Prairie Rose Chuckwagon Supper near Benton, Kansas to help save the cabin where Brewster Higley wrote the song \\"Home on the Range\\", Kansas' state song. \\"He might have been living anywhere,\\" Murphey noted, \\"but he was inspired by that place. This song gives focus to the heritage of the American West, to the prairie and its songs, poems and literature.\\" Murphey made his first pilgrimage to the cabin prior to the concert, where he performed the song. Jonathan Edwards, Michael Martin Murphey, and Gary Roller at the Flying Monkey, Plymouth, NH, October 13, 2012 In June 2011, Murphey released Tall Grass & Cool Water, subtitled Cowboy Songs VI and Buckaroo Blue Grass III. The CD includes two classics from the Sons of the Pioneers, \\"Cool Water\\" and \\"Way Out There\\", as well as other Western classics such as \\"Texas Cowboy\\", \\"Santa Fe Trail\\", and \\"The James Gang Trilogy\\". Murphey closes out the album with a beautiful duet with Carin Mari, \\"Springtime in the Rockies\\". On September 4, 2011, Murphey performed at the wedding of long-time friend David Lauren and Lauren Bush, the niece of former President George W. Bush, at Ralph Lauren's Double RL Ranch near Ridgway, Colorado. The event was called \\"America's Royal Wedding\\". Murphey, who helped Ralph Lauren find the ranch they now call home, has been friends with the Lauren family for nearly 30 years. \\"I go there to write songs from time to time\\", Murphey noted, \\"It's the most spectacular ranch in the Rockies.\\" At David Lauren's request, Murphey performed \\"Vanishing Breed\\" for the couple's first dance. Murphey wrote the song at a cabin on the Lauren ranch in the 1980s. Murphey and his Rio Grande Band played nearly six hours for the Lauren and Bush families. In January 2012, Tall Grass & Cool Water became the number 1 album on the Top 20 Western Music Albums Chart of the Western Music Association. In July 2013, Murphey released Red River Drifter, his first album of all new original songs in 20 years. The album reached number three on the Billboard Top Bluegrass Albums chart. He was named among the top 50 Greatest Country & Western singers by American Cowboy magazine. Legacy Murphey has had a successful music career that has spanned four decades and included such musical genres as folk, country, rock, popular, western, and cowboy music. As a singer, songwriter, and producer, he has contributed some of the best-loved songs of his generation. His songs have been recorded by Johnny Cash, Kenny Rogers, John Denver, Cher, Lyle Lovett, Flatt and Scruggs, Claire Hamill, Hoyt Axton, Roger Miller, Bobbie Gentry, Michael Nesmith, and the Monkees. Murphey is the narrator of the short film Spirit of the Cowgirl at the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas Murphey played a major role in the resurrection of the cowboy song genre, recording and producing some of the most successful cowboy music of the past forty years. His album Cowboy Songs inspired a whole series of albums. For his accomplishments in the Western and Cowboy Music field, Murphey received five awards from the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, formerly known as the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City. Political views Murphey has long been a champion of the western wilderness and wildlife, and has lent his support to various political causes associated with western culture and ideals. Early in his career, for example, he supported the Native American rights movement, which used his song, \\"Geronimo's Cadillac\\", as an anthem. In 1986, he founded an annual festival, WestFest, celebrating western art and culture in an effort to preserve the traditions of the West. He has been a long-time supporter of the conservation movement, attempting to find a middle ground between ranchers and activists on opposite sides of environmental issues. Murphey campaigned for George W. Bush in 2004.The Rural Thing: ‚ÄòWildfire‚Äô author Michael Martin Murphey fights to preserve Western tradition Las Vegas Sun In the past decade, Murphey has focused his political energies on the issue of private property rights‚Äîespecially in the western and southwestern United States. In 2006, he released \\"The Ballad of Kit Laney\\" in support of the New Mexico rancher's fight with the United States Forest Service over water rights. Laney was imprisoned for assault after standing up to federal agents who seized his ranch in 2004. Murphey helped form the Farmers' Freedom Agriculture Alliance and scheduled a benefit‚ÄîThe Farmers' Freedom Concert‚Äîto protest unfair land acquisitions across the western states. Murphey's opposition to the political forces threatening the American family farmer and rancher transcends political party affiliation. \\"I can tell you,\\" Murphey observed, \\"that politics‚Äîdoesn't matter whether it's Democrats or Republicans‚Äîhave been involved with big agribusiness for a long, long time.\\"  Honors and awards  * 2019 Wrangler Award Induction into the Cowboy Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Awards * 2009 Grammy Award Nomination for Best Bluegrass Album, for Buckaroo Blue Grass * 2009 Texas Country Music Hall of Fame * 2008 National Day of the Cowboy \\"Cowboy Keeper Award\\". * 2007 National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum Wrangler Award for Best Song, for \\"Long and Lonesome Road to Dalhart\\" * 2007 Texas Music Award for Best Song, for \\"Close the Land (America's Heartland)\\" * 2007 Letter of Commendation from the President of the United States, for Murphey's involvement producing John Wayne's 100th Birthday Celebration * 2004 Western Music Association Hall of Fame * 2000 The New Mexico Distinguished Public Service Lifetime Achievement Award * 1999 Academy of Western Artists Award for Best Album, for Cowboy Songs Four * 1998 The Golden Smokey Award for Outstanding Service to the U.S. National Park Service * 1997 Will Rogers Cowboy Philosopher Award, Will Rogers Memorial Commission * 1982 Academy of Country Music Top New Male Vocalist * 1972 Rolling Stone Magazine Best New Singer-Songwriter in the Nation, for the album Geronimo's Cadillac * American Quarter Horse Association Lifetime Honorary Member * CMA Award Nominations (three times) * BMI Platinum Record, for the song \\"Wildfire\\" * BMI Gold Record, for the album Cowboy Songs, the first Gold album in Cowboy music since Marty Robbins * RIAA Certified Gold Records for \\"Blue Sky, Night Thunder\\" and \\"Cowboy Songs\\" * King of the Cowboys Award for Outstanding Contribution to Western Family Entertainment by the Cody Order of Scouts, State of Nebraska * Cody Order of Scouts, Nebraska * Nebraska Country Music Hall of Fame * Colorado Country Music Hall of Fame * Western Heritage Awards from the Cowboy Hall of Fame (six-time winner) * International Charley Russell Western Heritage Society Red Sash Award for Outstanding Service in Preservation of Western Heritage, 1999‚Äì2000  Discography * Geronimo's Cadillac (1972) * Cosmic Cowboy Souvenir (1973) * Michael Murphey (1974) * Blue Sky ‚Äì Night Thunder (1975) * Swans Against the Sun (1976) * Flowing Free Forever (1976) * Lone Wolf (1978) * Peaks, Valleys, Honky Tonks & Alleys (1979) * Hard Country (1981) * Michael Martin Murphey (1982) * The Heart Never Lies (1983) * Tonight We Ride (1986) * Americana (1987) * River of Time (1988) * Land of Enchantment (1989) * Cowboy Songs (1990) * Cowboy Christmas: Cowboy Songs II (1991) * Cowboy Songs III (1993) * Sagebrush Symphony (1995) * The Horse Legends (1997) * Cowboy Songs Four (1998) * Acoustic Christmas Carols (1999) * Playing Favorites (2001) * Cowboy Classics: Playing Favorites II (2002) * Cowboy Christmas III (2002) * Live at Billy Bob's Texas (2004) * Heartland Cowboy: Cowboy Songs, Vol. 5 (2006) * Buckaroo Blue Grass (2009) * Lone Cowboy (2010) * Buckaroo Blue Grass II (2010) * Tall Grass & Cool Water (2011) * Campfire on the Road (2012) * Red River Drifter (2013) * High Stakes (2016) * Austinology - Alleys of Austin (2016) Featuring Willie Nelson, Lyle Lovett, Steve Earle and many others  References  External links  * Michael Martin Murphey's Official Website =Archival Materials= * Michael Martin Murphey papers, 1982‚Äì2014, at Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library, Texas Tech University 1945 births American country singer-songwriters American male singer-songwriters Country musicians from Texas Epic Records artists Living people Musicians from Dallas Singers from New Mexico People from Wrightwood, California Singing cowboys Songwriters from Texas 21st-century American singers 20th-century American singers Singers from California People from Oak Cliff, Texas Country musicians from California 20th-century male singers 21st-century male singers Country musicians from New Mexico ","title":"Michael Martin Murphey"},{"id":"626514","text":"A speaker giving a presentation using a projector A presentation is the process of presenting a topic to an audience.

He was the mayor of Las Vegas, Nevada from 1999 to 2011. His wife, Carolyn Goodman, succeeded him as mayor in 2011. Goodman is an independent.Goodman Switches Party Affiliation. KXNT, Ret. December 16th 2009 Biography Goodman was born and raised in a Jewish family in Philadelphia. After attending Central High SchoolList of alumni of Central High School (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) for a time, he graduated from The Haverford School,Oscar Goodman, \\"Being Oscar: From Mob Lawyer to Mayor of Las Vegas Only in America\\", (Weinstein Books, 2013), p. 277 Haverford College and received his J.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He and his wife Carolyn have four children. During his career as a defense attorney he represented defendants accused of being some of the leading organized crime figures in Las Vegas, such as Meyer Lansky, Nicky Scarfo, Herbert \\"Fat Herbie\\" Blitzstein, Phil Leonetti, former Stardust Casino boss Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal, and Jamiel \\"Jimmy\\" Chagra, a 1970s drug trafficker who was acquitted of ordering the murder of Federal Judge John H. Wood, Jr. One of his notorious clients was reputed Chicago mobster Anthony \\"Tony the Ant\\" Spilotro, who was known to have a short and violent temper. In the semi- factual 1995 movie Casino, the character of Nicky Santoro was based on Spilotro and was portrayed by actor Joe Pesci. Goodman had a cameo appearance in the film as himself while defending \\"Ace Rothstein\\", a character closely based on Lefty Rosenthal and played by Robert De Niro. Goodman and his wife were active in the local Jewish federation soon after they moved to Las Vegas in 1964 as well, with Carolyn eventually serving as head of the federation's women's divisions. Goodman also represented former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock, who was convicted of accepting illegal campaign contributions and eventually forced to resign. Hedgecock was later cleared of all charges on appeal. In 1980‚Äì81, he served as president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Goodman was a senior partner in the law firm of Goodman & Chesnoff. Goodman currently serves as Of Counsel to Goodman Law Group, a Las Vegas law firm formed by his son, Ross C. Goodman. Goodman was elected mayor of Las Vegas on June 8, 1999, receiving 32,765 (63.76 percent) votes while his opponent, then-Las Vegas City Councilman Arnie Adamsen, received 18,620 (36.24 percent). Goodman was re-elected to a second four-year term in 2003, defeating five opponents and receiving 29,356 (85.72 percent) of the votes. On April 3, 2007, he was re-elected to a third and final term with 26,845 votes (83.69 percent), again defeating five opponents. Las Vegas law prevents the mayor, who has been called the town's \\"most popular mayor\\", from serving more than three terms. His wife was elected to succeed him as mayor in 2011, winning 60% of the vote. Goodman was a member of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority before being elected mayor. Significant events Goodman in 2003 Goodman appears as himself in the 1995 Martin Scorsese film Casino. Later on, he made another brief appearance in the film Looney Tunes: Back in Action on the DVD extras. In 2006 he appeared as himself in the Direct-to-DVD film Bachelor Party Vegas and respectively in 2015 and 2016 did interviews for the television programs The Making of the Mob: New York and The Making of the Mob: Chicago. On June 8, 1999, he was elected mayor of Las Vegas. On June 28, 1999, Goodman was the first mayor of Las Vegas to have his image placed on $5 and $25 casino chips issued by a Las Vegas casino. The two chips were issued by the Four Queens Hotel and Casino in Downtown Las Vegas. In 2006, the Four Queens put out a $200 Silver Strike with the likeness of Oscar on it. In 2000, a bobblehead doll was issued as a promotion during a Las Vegas 51s baseball game. Mayor Goodman was an invited celebrity photographer for the Playboy Cyber Club. He shot a topless pictorial of Miss January 2001 Irina Voronina for the website. In 2002, he became a spokesman for Bombay Sapphire gin, receiving a $100,000 salary which was donated to charity, including $50,000 donated to The Meadows School, a private school in Las Vegas founded by his wife Carolyn. In April 2003, he was re-elected for a second four-year term, winning 86% the vote, and becoming one of the most popular politicians elected to office in Las Vegas. In 2003, Las Vegas Review- Journal columnist John L. Smith wrote a book titled Of Rats and Men: Oscar Goodman's Life from Mob Mouthpiece to Mayor of Las Vegas, which chronicles Goodman's life, including 35 years spent defending notorious U.S. crime figures, including, among others, Meyer Lansky, Anthony \\"Tony The Ant\\" Spilotro and Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal (the last two portrayed by Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro respectively, under different names, in the film Casino). In 2003, Goodman was voted the Least Effective Public Official in the Review- Journal's annual reader's poll. Goodman has been vocal about having a Major League Baseball team relocate to Las Vegas. In 2004, the city failed to secure a move by the Montreal Expos to the city. Instead, the team relocated to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals. Later that year, Goodman met with officials of the Florida Marlins. The Chicago White Sox were considering a move but talks fell through after Chicago officials provided incentives for the team to stay. During his time as mayor, Goodman tried to get a National Football League team to relocate to Las Vegas. On April 24, 2006, he called the San Diego Chargers and asked if they would be interested in moving. Because of a contract, the city could not talk about a possible move. On January 4, 2007 he called again, since the team was not allowed to talk to other cities about a possible move. Again, Goodman was turned down \\"for the time being. According to Mark Fabiani, the Chargers general counsel, Goodman is a longtime season ticket holder of the Chargers and a fan. Ultimately in 2017, under the tenure of his wife as mayor the Oakland Raiders agreed to relocate to Las Vegas for the 2020 season. The Chargers ultimately relocated to Los Angeles. Goodman was angered by President Barack Obama's negative remarks about Las Vegas in 2009 and 2010. He guest starred three times as himself on the CBS series CSI in the episodes \\"Sqweegel\\" while defending Ann-Margret's character from being harassed by the LVPD, and \\"Maid Man\\", first appearing at the opening of the Mob Museum, which was re-created for the show in advance of its opening, and in \\"Last Rollout\\" as a lawyer for a suspect during an interrogation. His memoir, Being Oscar: From Mob Lawyer to Mayor of Las Vegas, written with George Anastasia, was published in 2013. Seeking higher office Goodman briefly entertained challenging Jack Carter, the son of President Carter, for the Democratic nomination to run against incumbent Republican U.S. Senator John Ensign in 2006. However, on April 20, Goodman announced that he would not run but instead would run for a third term as mayor. After winning the mayoral election in 2007, Goodman, like his counterpart Michael Bloomberg in New York City, looked into a means to change the city charter to remove term limits. In the absence of that change, Goodman fueled speculation that he might run as an Independent in the 2010 gubernatorial race against incumbent, Republican Jim Gibbons and the presumptive Democratic candidate, Rory Reid.Ball, Molly (2009-6-11), Goodman Eyes Race for Governor. Las Vegas Review-Journal http://www.lvrj.com/news/breaking_news/47891957.html However, Goodman decided not to run for governor, citing his desire to stay close to his family and objections to moving to the capital Carson City.Powers, Ashley (January 25, 2010), Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman decides not to go for Nevada governor. \\"Los Angeles Times http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/01/oscar- goodman-nevada-governor.html Goodman has appeared interested in higher office and was the focus of a story (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) about being the first Jewish president of the United States by Las Vegas commentator Dayvid Figler.Figler, Dayvid HEEB Magazine, Issue 18, The First Jewish President Criticism=Ethics investigation= In February 2004, Robert Rose, an ethics watchdog, filed a complaint with the Nevada Commission on Ethics claiming that during the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Goodman handed out to fellow mayors, conference attendees and other political figures invitations to a cocktail party Goodman was hosting. Rose alleged that this was nothing more than the mayor abusing his power of office to help promote a business that is owned by his son, Ross Goodman, and Las Vegas Councilman Michael Mack. The Nevada Ethics Commission opened an investigation on April 14, 2004, and on May 13, 2004, the members of the commission found the mayor in ethics violations, although no fine was rendered. Goodman sued the commission and won; the commission's ruling was reversed by the court. On September 16, 2004, Rose again filed a complaint with the Nevada Commission on Ethics, this time asking the commission to clarify Goodman's affiliation with his son Ross's law firm. In a statement, the mayor explained his name on the letterhead is a way of informing out of state law firms that Ross Goodman is his son. However, a person serving as an elected public official in Nevada may not have his name listed on a law firm letterhead, and Goodman removed his name under protest after several newspaper articles noted the infraction. On July 18, 2005, the Nevada Commission on Ethics concluded insufficient cause for a hearing and recommended the allegations be dismissed, clearing Goodman of the ethics complaint regarding his name listed as \\"Of Counsel\\" to Goodman Law Group. On September 11, 2007, the Supreme Court of Nevada ruled that Goodman did not violate any ethics laws during the 2004 cocktail party that he hosted on behalf of his son Ross C. Goodman. =Remarks to schoolchildren= On March 3, 2005, Goodman spoke to a group of fourth-graders at Jo Mackey Elementary School. When asked what he would take with him if marooned on a desert island, the mayor replied, \\"A bottle of Bombay Sapphire Gin.\\" When asked about his hobbies, the mayor named drinking Bombay Sapphire Gin as a favorite. Later, when asked to comment about his statements, Goodman was unapologetic: \\"I'm the George Washington of mayors. I can't tell a lie. If they didn't want the answer, the kid shouldn't have asked the question.\\" This caused an outcry from parents whose children heard the remark, and school officials said the remark was inappropriate. =Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas= In July 2006 the mayor criticized the Ubisoft game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas for its premise of terrorism in Las Vegas, because he thought it may tarnish the city's image. He stated, \\"It's based on a false premise.... It could be harmful economically, and it may be something that's not entitled to free speech (protection).... I will ask... whether or not we can stop it.\\" Publication of the game was not hindered. =Legalized prostitution= Currently, prostitution is legal in Nevada only in rural counties with fewer than 400,000 residents, a requirement which excludes Clark County and the city of Las Vegas from allowing the practice. Goodman supports legalizing prostitution in the city's downtown area as a revenue generator and tool for revitalization, although a majority of Nevadans polled in 2003 opposed the mayor's position. Goodman's views on prostitution have been criticized by The New York Times columnist Bob Herbert, as well as Las Vegas Sun columnist Jon Ralston.

The first program for the degree was introduced in 1954. The Master of Music (M.M. or M.Mus.) is, as an academic title, the first graduate degree in Music awarded by universities and conservatories. The M.M. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually performance in singing or instrument playing, composition, or conducting) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as music history, music theory, or music pedagogy. The degree, which takes one or two years of full-time study to complete, prepares students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers, according to their area of specialization. The M.M. is often required as the minimum teaching credential for university, college, and conservatory instrumental or vocal teaching positions. Types The M.M. is widely available in performance (sometimes with a specialization in music teaching/pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and music education. The music education degree may also be awarded as a more specifically titled Master of Music Education (M.M.Ed.). The master's in music theory, musicology (commonly called \\"music history\\"), and ethnomusicology is typically the Master of Arts (M.A.). Nevertheless, some universities in the UK (e.g. Sheffield University) utilize the M.M. as a special research degree, in which the student undertakes original research and prepares a written thesis or similar document. Programs focusing on preparing musicians for careers in sacred music for churches and houses of worship may alternatively be called Master of Sacred Music (M.S.M.). Components of degree=Applied studies and courses= One of the major differences between a typical M.A. degree and the M.M. is that whereas M.A. degree students often undertake original research and prepare and submit a thesis or similar research document, M.M. students focus on practical, applied areas, as set out in their M.M. area of specialization, which are typically instrumental or vocal performance, composition of new music, or conducting (the latter may focus on orchestral conducting, choral conducting, or a combination of both. In M.M. programs, the student spends intensive lesson time with a professor. For singers and instrumentalists, this is with a voice and instrument professor, respectively. For composition students, they take coaching sessions with composer-professors. For conducting students, they get conducting coaching from a conductor-professor at the university. M.M. students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons with a professor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many M.M. programs, all of the different M.M. streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses, as these core courses are a necessary background for all three careers. The different streams may also have different required courses for each stream. For example, vocal performance students may be required to take an opera or art song class; orchestral instrumentalists may be required to take an orchestral excerpts or orchestral audition preparation class; composition students may be required to take composition courses; and conducting students may be required to take conducting, score-reading, or piano classes. Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing an M.M. in Baroque violin might do a sub- specialization in Baroque music history (e.g., on historically authentic performance). Some institutions permit M.M. students to do a sub- specialization in a field outside music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a M.M. in piano pedagogy may be able to do a sub-specialization in the psychology of learning in the university's department of psychology or take a sub-specialization in educational methods in the university's department of education. Doing sub- specializations outside the faculty of music typically requires the approval of both the faculty of music and the other faculty (e.g., psychology, education, etc.). =Recitals and comprehensive exams= The last stage of the M.M. is usually the performance of one or two recitals and completion of comprehensive exams. Most programs require that the recitals include advanced- grade pieces that are drawn from the different eras of music history, such as Baroque-era solo suites (late 17th to mid 18th century), a Classical-era (mid to late 18th century) sonata or concerto; a Romantic-era (19th century) concerto or solo; and a Contemporary era (20th and 21st century) piece. The specific components of the recital vary between schools. Some programs allow students to include chamber pieces, in which the student plays a major role as part of a chamber group, for some of the pieces. In some schools, students are required to give a lecture for one or both of the recitals, in which they explain the historical context or music theory or compositional issues involved in the pieces. This approach, called a lecture-recital, is designed to give students experience explaining and contextualizing the pieces or songs they perform. This skill is important for performers because many also teach or coach students, and some will go on to become professors, where they may be required to give lectures on music history, theory, or composition. Some M.M. programs require students to pass comprehensive exams on their area of specialization and subjects such as music history and music theory. The goal of this exam is to ensure that the student has obtained a well-rounded knowledge and understanding that extends beyond their specialization. Since the M.M. is the standard minimum credential to teach applied subjects (performance or composition) at universities and conservatories, it is important that M.M. graduates have this broader understanding of music history and theory. Admission requirements To be admitted to a M.M. program, most institutions require an undergraduate degree or diploma in music, such as a B.M. or B.A. with a major in music, usually with a grade average of B+ or higher. M.M. programs in performance usually require a live audition that includes advanced pieces (or for singers, songs) from a wide range of styles, typically ranging from the Baroque era (1600-1750), the Classical music period (1750-1800), the Romantic music era (1800-1910) to the 20th and/or 21st century. Singers typically perform arias from operas and art songs, which are typically accompanied by a pianist. Instrumental musicians typically perform solo J.S. Bach or other unaccompanied repertoire, a movement from a sonata, and a movement from a virtuoso concerto. Instrumentalists who play orchestral instruments (violin family, woodwinds, brass, etc.) may be asked to perform excerpts from the standard orchestral repertoire. Auditionees are typically told which pieces and movements to prepare; some schools even give the bar numbers or rehearsal letters (e.g., Beethoven Symphony no. 5, movement 1, bar 100 to 120). Some institutions use videotaped recitals or performances as a pre-screening method. This approach helps to eliminate candidates who do not meet the school's minimum performance standards, and as such, it saves those candidates the time and cost of traveling to the institution for an in-person audition, and it also saves the school the cost of having a panel of professors hear the candidate on location. Some universities have multiple audition locations to reduce the traveling expenses faced by candidates. For example, a school located on the west coast of the United States might offer the option of auditioning at a central and eastern US location. The school's professors who form the audition panel travel to these other locations to hear auditionees. Some schools which normally require in-person auditions waive this requirement for students who play the larger instruments (e.g., double bass and tuba), and allow a videotape to be sent instead. Applicants are typically asked for official transcripts from all post-secondary programs and letters of recommendation from music professors and teachers. For most graduate programs, transcripts of every program or degree are required, whether or not the degree was completed. For students who have started out, but then withdrawn from a number of programs, they may have to request transcripts from many institutions. To protect against applicants changing marks on the transcripts using forgery, most schools require that the transcripts be sent directly from the previous institution's registrar to the music school, or that the transcripts be in sealed envelopes with the other school's registrar's seal (stamp) over the closure. Some programs may also request a statement of intent/statement of purpose or another type of essay, in which the candidate explains why she wishes to be admitted, and sets out her professional, performance or career goals. Some programs may request copies of recital programs from previous performances or a list of performance experience, which may include, for orchestral instrumentalists, orchestra experience. In some universities, candidates must also be admitted to the university's graduate school; as such, applicants may have to achieve a certain mark on standardized tests, such as the GRE. Similarly, students from countries where the official language is not that of the university may be required to achieve a certain mark on standardized language tests. For example, students applying to a US M.M. program who come from a country where English is not an official language, may be required to pass the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Admission to M.M. programs in conducting often requires a video recording of a live rehearsal and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings (audio or video) of live performances. Careers The M.Mus degree is usually undertaken to prepare students to be professional performers (typically either singers or instrumental musicians), conductors, and composers. As such many recipients of the M.Mus. degree do not seek further formal education after they complete the M.Mus. The M.Mus. is typically the minimum credential that allows them to teach instrumental or vocal performance at universities, colleges, and conservatories (some institutions will also hire teachers who do not have the M.Mus. who hold an Artist's Diploma or similar diploma, and/or who have had a significant performing career as either a solo recitalist, chamber musician or orchestral musician). Some graduates do additional graduate or professional study in other areas, such as a law degree or medical degree. The combination of an M.Mus. and a professional degree could enable the degree holder to work in fields where music and law (or medicine) overlap. Recipients of the M.Mus. may also make use of the general education provided in the degree (e.g., in writing and researching) to get a job in government, university administration, or in the non-profit or arts administration sector. Other recipients of the M.Mus. may go on to further graduate studies in music by continuing their M.Mus. specialization in performance or conducting at the doctoral level, by completing a DMA (Doctor of Musical Arts) degree in those areas. Some students branch out to another area of music at the PhD level, such as musicology or music theory. While PhD programs in musicology and music theory normally require an MA in music, in some cases, students with a M.Mus. in performance or composition who show strong promise may be conditionally admitted to PhD programs in musicology or music theory. As well, some recipients of the M.Mus. degree may go on to do graduate work in another area in which music is a supporting field, such as an Ed.D. in music education (e.g., specializing in music instruction) or a master's degree in Library Science, in order to become a music reference librarian. M.Mus. graduates who wish to pursue graduate studies in an area that is not directly connected with music may be conditionally admitted to PhD programs in areas such as women's studies or sociology, subject to the condition that they complete a list of qualifying courses.

A leading banker and businessman, who worked closely with Secretary of State Elihu Root, 1905-1909, and served as United States Secretary of State from January to March 1909. He served as ambassador to France 1909 to 1912. He was a leader in the Preparedness Movement setting up training programs for would-be Soldiers before the United States entered the First World War in April 1917. He was defeated narrowly as a candidate for the United States Senate in 1916. He was commissioned as a major in the United States Army in 1917, and played a major role as Chief of the American Military Mission at British General Headquarters. Early life and family  Born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, to William Benjamin Bacon and Emily Crosby Low, he was a graduate of Harvard University (Class of 1880), where he was a member of the A.D. Club and Delta Kappa Epsilon. He was married on October 10, 1883, to Martha Waldron Cowdin.Marquis Who's Who, Inc. Who Was Who in American History, the Military. Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1975. P. 22 They had four children: Robert Low Bacon, Gaspar Griswold Bacon, Elliot Cowdin Bacon, and Martha Beatrix Bacon (1890-1967) who married George Whitney (1885-1963). Their son Robert was a United States Congressman; their other son Gaspar was the President of the Massachusetts Senate from 1929 to 1932 and Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts from 1933 to 1935. Career  He worked in the steel world, including partnership with J.P. Morgan & Co. for many years starting in 1894. He acted as J.P. Morgan's chief lieutenant and participated in the formation of the U.S. Steel Corporation and the Northern Securities Company. The pressure of the job shot his nerves, and he left the company in 1903. After Theodore Roosevelt (with whom he was friends at Harvard) had been reelected, Bacon was named Assistant Secretary of State in 1905, a position which he held until 1909; he was acting secretary while Elihu Root was in South America in 1906. For the last 38 days of Roosevelt's term, he became full secretary from January 27 to March 5, 1909, because of Root's election to the Senate. Bacon obtained the advice and consent of the Senate for the Panama Canal treaties with Colombia and Panama. He served as United States Ambassador to France from 1909 until 1912. He was supposed to return home on the RMS Titanic with his wife and daughter, but delays kept them in Paris. Portrait by Joaqu√≠n Sorolla In August 1914, he went to France to help with the work of the American Field Service ‚Äì which provided ambulances and drivers to support French and British forces. He was also attached to the British Army Medical Corps and assisted with the establishment of a typhoid hospital near Ypres. His book For Better Relations with Our Latin American Neighbors was published in 1915.Bacon, Robert. For Better Relations with Our Latin American Neighbors: A Journey to South America. Washington, D.C.: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Division of Intercourse and Education, 1915. He was a staunch advocate of the United States' entry into World War I and spoke in favor of increased military preparedness via universal military service as the president of the National Security League in 1916. He criticized President Woodrow Wilson for inaction at the invasion of Belgium and sought the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate against William M. Calder. Bacon continued to push for a stronger national defense as well as a protective tariff that could be used for the mobilization of industry in case of war. Although he had support from former president Theodore Roosevelt and Elihu Root, Bacon lost the race by about 9,000 votes and pledged to support Calder. He was named as the candidate of the American Party but withdrew on account of his pledge to Calder. He was then commissioned a major in the U.S. Army in May 1917 before sailing to France as a member of General Pershing's staff. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1918 and served as chief of the American military mission at British General Headquarters working with British commander, General Sir Douglas Haig. He returned to the United States in April 1919. Bacon died on May 29, 1919, from blood poisoning after undergoing surgery on his mastoiditis. Memorial Malvina Hoffman, The Sacrifice, caen marble sculpture, 1922, Modern and Contemporary Art Museum, Harvard University A sculpture entitled The Sacrifice was made by Malvina Hoffman as a memorial to the late Ambassador of France, Robert Bacon, and alumni of Harvard University who lost their lives during the World War I. In it, the head of a 13th-century crusader lay on the lap of a draped woman. The sculpture was dedicated in 1923 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. After the War Memorial Chapel at Harvard University was completed in 1932, it was installed there.

Risset was a former student of Andr√© Jolivet and former co-worker of Max Mathews at Bell Labs. Risset was born in Le Puy-en-Velay, France. Arriving at Bell Labs, New Jersey in 1964, he used Max Mathews' MUSIC IV software to digitally recreate the sounds of brass instruments. He made digital recordings of trumpets and studied their timbral composition using \\"pitch-synchronous\\" spectrum analysis tools, revealing that the amplitude and frequency of the harmonics (more correctly, partials) of these instruments would differ depending on frequency, duration and amplitude. He is also credited with performing the first experiments on a range of synthesis techniques including FM Synthesis and waveshaping. After the discrete Shepard scale Risset created a version of the scale where the steps between each tone are continuous, and it is appropriately called the continuous Risset scale or Shepard-Risset glissando. Risset has also created a similar effect with rhythm in which tempo seems to increase or decrease endlessly. Risset was the head of the Computer Department at IRCAM (1975-1979). At MIT Media Labs, he composed the first Duet for one pianist (1989). For his work in computer music and his 70 compositions, he received the first Golden Nica (Ars Electronica Prize, 1987), the Giga-Hertz Grand Prize 2009, and the highest French awards in both music (Grand Prix National de la Musique, 1990) and science (Gold Medal, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, 1999).

It traces its origins to 1611, when under the Royal Charter granted by King Sigismund III Vasa, the Jesuit College became the first university in Pozna≈Ñ. The Pozna≈Ñ Society for the Advancement of Arts and Sciences which played an important role in leading Pozna≈Ñ to its reputation as a chief intellectual centre during the Age of Positivism and partitions of Poland, initiated founding of the university. The inauguration ceremony of the newly founded institution took place on 7 May 1919 that is 308 years after it was formally established by the Polish king and on 400th anniversary of the foundation of the Lubra≈Ñski Academy which is considered its predecessor. Its original name was Piast University (Polish: Wszechnica Piastowska), which later in 1920 was renamed to University of Pozna≈Ñ (Polish: Uniwersytet Pozna≈Ñski). The history of AMU. Uniwersystet Adama Mickiewicza During World War II staff and students of the university opened an underground Polish University of the Western Lands (Polish: Uniwersytet Ziem Zachodnich). In 1955 University of Pozna≈Ñ adopted a new patron, the 19th-century Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz, and changed to its current name. The university is organized into six principal academic units‚Äîfive research schools consisting of twenty faculties and the doctoral school‚Äîwith campuses throughout the historic Old Town and Morasko. The university employs roughly 4,000 academics, and has more than 40,000 students who study in some 80 disciplines. More than half of the student body are women. The language of instruction is usually Polish, although several degrees are offered in either German or English. The university library is one of Poland's largest, and houses one of Europe's largest Masonic collections, including the 1723 edition of James Anderson's The Constitutions of the Free- Masons. The university is currently publishing over 79 research journals, most of them on Pressto publishing platform based on Open Journal System. Adam Mickiewicz University Repository (AMUR) contains over 23704 records of research publications and is one of the first research repositories in Poland. Due to its history, the university is traditionally considered Poland's most reputable institution of higher learning, this standing equally being reflected in national rankings. Adam Mickiewicz University is a member of the European University Association, EUCEN, SGroup European Universities' Network, Compostela Group of Universities and EPICUR.http://epicur.education/partners/  History  The founding of the Lubra≈Ñski Academy in 1518, painted by Jan Matejko (1886). From the beginning, the history of the Adam Mickiewicz University has been inextricably linked to the history of Pozna≈Ñ itself and in some measure ‚Äì the history of the entire Republic of Poland, which, partitioned by the neighboring countries (Prussia, Austria-Hungary and Russia) towards the end of the eighteenth century disappeared from the European map for more than a hundred years. On 28 October 1611, when under the Royal Charter granted by King Sigismund III Vasa, the Jesuit College became the first university in Pozna≈Ñ. These edicts were later affirmed with charters issued by King John II Casimir in 1650 and King John III Sobieski in 1678, the university in Pozna≈Ñ lasted until 1773. Based on these charters, the university granted scholar degrees to its members. Collegium Minus as a part of Nazi Reichsuniversit√§t Posen (1941)The inauguration ceremony of the newly founded took place on 7 May 1919 that is 308 years after it was formally established by the Polish king and the 400th anniversary of the foundation of the Lubra≈Ñski Academy which is considered its spiritual predecessor. Its original name was Piast University (Polish: Wszechnica Piastowska), which later in 1920 was renamed to the University of Pozna≈Ñ (Polish: Uniwersytet Pozna≈Ñski). In 1920 sociologist Florian Znaniecki founded the first Polish department of sociology at the university, one of the first such departments in Europe. In the same period of the university's history, botanist J√≥zef Paczoski founded the world's first institute of phytosociology. After the invasion of Poland, Pozna≈Ñ was annexed by Germany and the University was closed by the Nazis in 1939. It was reopened as a German university in 1941, which operated until 1944. Staff and students of the Polish university, some of them expelled by Germans to Warsaw, opened an underground Polish University of the Western Lands (Polish: Uniwersytet Ziem Zachodnich), whose classes met in private apartments (see Education in Poland during World War II). Many of the professors and staff were imprisoned and executed in Fort VII in Pozna≈Ñ, including professor Stanis≈Çaw Paw≈Çowski (rector in the years 1932-33). The Polish university reopened, in much smaller form, after the end of World War II. In 1950, the Medical Faculty, including the Dentistry section and the Faculty of Pharmacy, were split off to form a separate institution, now the Pozna≈Ñ University of Medical Sciences. In 1955 the University of Pozna≈Ñ adopted a new patron, the 19th-century Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz, and changed to its current name.  Sites  Collegium Minus (2019) The university's central administrative building is Collegium Minus, on the west side of Adam Mickiewicz Square at the western end of the street ≈öwiƒôty Marcin. (This is one of a group of buildings, including the Imperial Palace, built in the first decade of the 20th century while Pozna≈Ñ was still under German rule; it originally housed a Royal Academy.) Adjoining this is the Aula, which is frequently used for ceremonies and for classical music concerts, and Collegium Iuridicum (accommodating the law faculty). Some teaching takes place in Collegium Maius, another of the aforementioned group of buildings (on ul. Fredry), although this is mainly used by the medical university. Other buildings in the city centre include former communist party headquarters on ≈öwiƒôty Marcin, Collegium Novum (used mainly for language teaching) on Al. Niepodleg≈Ço≈õci, and the university library on ul. Ratajczaka. Skottehytta ‚Äì venue of until 2009. Since then the Adam Mickiewicz University Polar Station is located in container on opposite side of the bay. The university also uses a number of other buildings in southern and western districts of Pozna≈Ñ. However it is strongly developing its site at Morasko in the north of the city. As of 2006, the faculties of physics, mathematics and computer science, biology, geographical and geological science had moved to the new location. In 2015 they were joined by the faculty of history (Collegium Historicum Novum). The university also has external branches in other towns of western Poland, including Kalisz, Ostr√≥w Wielkopolski and S≈Çubice. Adam Mickiewicz University maintains close cooperation with Viadrina European University, Germany. The two universities jointly operate the Collegium Polonicum, located just opposite Viadrina on the Polish side of the Oder River. University owns a seasonal polar research station located in the Petuniabukta (Petunia Bay), in the Northern part of Billefjord, and central part of Spitsbergen island in the Svalbard archipelago. Staff and student numbers left At the start of the 2008/2009 academic year, the university had 46,817 undergraduates (including about 18,000 on weekend or evening courses), 1308 doctoral students, and 2247 other post-graduate students. The number of undergraduates declined slightly between 2005 and 2008.Rector's Report 2008, p. 25 ff. At the end of 2008, the university had a total of 2892 teaching staff, including 257 full professors and 490 associate/assistant professors. It also had 2120 other employees.Rector's Report 2008, p. 51 ff. and Appendix 10  Reputation  The Adam Mickiewicz University is one of the top Polish universities. It was ranked by Perspektywy magazine as the third Polish university. University Ranking at Perspektywy.pl International rankings such as ARWU and QS University Rankings rank the university as the fourth best Polish higher level institution. On the list of the best Emerging Europe and Central Asia universities compiled by QS University Rankings, the Adam Mickiewicz University was placed as 60th.

Hanna Suchocka, 5th Prime Minister of Poland, first woman to hold this post in Poland and the 14th woman to be appointed and serve as prime minister in the world, graduated from university.Skard, Torild (2014) \\"Hanna Suchocka\\" in Women of Power - Half a century of female presidents and prime ministers worldwide, Bristol: Policy Press, Additionally, Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, the 12th Prime Minister of Poland and Roman Giertych, the Deputy Prime Minister of Poland and Minister of National Education between 2006 and 2007, are graduates. Bohdan Winiarski was one of the longest serving Judges of the International Court of Justice (1946‚àí1967) and between 1961 and 1964 its President.Winiarski received his Habilitation at the Faculty. Additionally, Krzysztof Skubiszewski, Minister of Foreign Affairs (1989‚Äì1993), was the Judge sitting ad hoc on the Court (1993‚àí2004), also Pawe≈Ç Wili≈Ñski, Professor of Jurisprudence, Chair in Criminal Procedure, served as the Judge sitting ad hoc on the European Court of Human Rights for two terms (2010‚àí2012, 2015‚àí2016). Three of the school's graduates, including Prof. Alfons Klafkowski (1985‚àí1989), Prof. Mieczys≈Çaw Tyczka (1989‚àí1993) and Julia Przy≈Çƒôbska (since 2016), have served as the Presidents of the Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland. Three of the current fifteen members of the court graduated from AMU: Julia Przy≈Çƒôbska, Dr. Andrzej Zielonacki and Prof. Justyn Piskorski. Additionally, the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda, refused to swear in Prof. Roman Hauser, former President of the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland and Prof. Krzysztof ≈ölebzak as the Tribunal's judges.

The Polish Cipher Bureau sought to break it due to the threat that Poland faced from Germany, but its early attempts did not succeed. Near the beginning of 1929, the Polish Cipher Bureau realized that mathematicians may make good codebreakers; the bureau invited math students at University of Pozna≈Ñ to take a class on cryptology. After the class, the Bureau recruited some students to work part-time at a Bureau branch set up in Pozna≈Ñ for the students. The branch operated for some time. On 1 September 1932, 27-year-old Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski and two fellow Pozna≈Ñ University mathematics graduates, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki, joined the Bureau full-time and moved to Warsaw. Their first task was to reconstruct a four- letter German naval cipher. = Honorary doctors = Recipients of honorary doctorates from the University include Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, Marie Curie, Ignacy Paderewski, Roman Dmowski, Witold Hensel, Ernst H√•kon Jahr, Al Gore and John Maxwell Coetzee.

She was the biggest and fastest of the Royal Navy's battleships, the only ship of her class, and the last battleship to be built. The Royal Navy anticipated being outnumbered by the combined German and Japanese battleships in the early 1940s, and had therefore started building the s. However, the time-consuming construction of the triple-16-inch turrets for the Lion-class would delay their completion until 1943 at the earliest. The British had enough guns and turrets in storage to allow one ship of a modified Lion-class design with four twin-15-inch turrets to be completed faster than the Lion-class vessels that had already been laid down. Work on Vanguard was started and stopped several times during the war, and her design was revised several times during her construction to reflect war experience. These stoppages and changes prevented her from being completed before the end of the war. Vanguards first task after completing her sea trial at the end of 1946 was, early the next year, to convey King George VI and his family on the first Royal Tour of South Africa by a reigning monarch. While refitting after her return, she was selected for another Royal Tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1948. This was cancelled due to King George's declining health and Vanguard briefly became flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1949. After her return home in mid-1949, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. Throughout her career, the battleship usually served as the flagship of any unit to which she was assigned. During the early 1950s, Vanguard was involved in a number of training exercises with NATO forces. In 1953 she participated in Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Review. While she was refitting in 1955, the Admiralty announced that the ship was going to be put into reserve upon completion of the work. Vanguard was sold for scrap and was broken up beginning in 1960. Design and description By early 1939 it was clear that the first two s could not be delivered before 1943 at the earliest and that further battleship construction would be necessary to match the German and Japanese battleships already under construction. The main constraint on the construction of any new battleships was the limited available capacity and the time required to build large- calibre guns and their gun turrets. Using four existing twin 15-inch mountings offered the possibility of bypassing this bottleneck and allowed the construction of a single fast battleship more quickly than building more Lion- class ships. The turrets were originally built for the battlecruisers and during the First World War, and were removed during the conversions of these ships to aircraft carriers in the 1920s. To save time, the Lion design was modified to accommodate the four turrets, and preliminary design work began in July 1939. The square or transom stern was retained as it was estimated to improve speed at full power by . This made Vanguard the only British battleship built with a transom stern as the Lions were never finished. Design work was suspended on 11 September 1939, after the start of the Second World War, but resumed in February 1940 after the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, expressed an interest in the ship. The design was modified to increase protection against shell splinters on the unprotected sides of the ship's hull, the armour of the secondary armament was increased to resist semi-armour-piercing bombs, and the splinter belt's thickness fore and aft of the main armour belt was reduced by in compensation. A small conning tower was added aft, and four Unrotated Projectile mounts were added to supplement the six octuple-barrel 2-pounder anti-aircraft mounts already planned. More pressing commitments forced the preliminary design work to be suspended again in June and when it resumed in October, the design was modified again in light of recent war experience. Greater fuel capacity was added and the armour protection improved but these changes deepened the design's draught so that it exceeded the limit of the Suez Canal. The thickness of the main belt was reduced by to save weight but the primary method chosen to reduce the draught was to increase the beam by . This exceeded the width of the docks at Rosyth and Plymouth, which severely limited the number of docks that could handle the ship but these changes were approved by the Board of Admiralty on 17 April 1941. The ship had already been ordered on 14 March under the 1940 Emergency War Programme, although the drawings were not turned over to John Brown & Company until ten days later. Overhead view of Vanguard Vanguards design was revised again, while the ship was under construction in 1942, to reflect lessons learned from the loss of the battleship and operations with the other battleships. The longitudinal distance between the inboard and outboard propellers was increased from to reduce the chance of a single torpedo wrecking both propeller shafts on one side and watertight access trunks were added to all spaces below the deep waterline to prevent progressive flooding through open watertight doors and hatches as happened to Prince of Wales. This change and the relocation of some of the ammunition handling rooms from the lower deck to the middle deck seriously delayed the ship's completion. The design requirement that the guns of 'A' turret be capable of firing straight ahead at 0¬∞ of elevation was sacrificed to allow her freeboard forward to be increased, and her bow was reshaped to make it less prone to shipping water and throwing sea spray in head seas. The ship's fuel supply was increased from to to prevent the fuel shortage problems suffered by and during their pursuit of the . The Unrotated Projectile mounts were deleted from the design and the light anti-aircraft armament was increased to a total of 76 two-pounders in one quadruple and nine octuple mounts and 24 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon were also added in 12 twin mounts. Space for these was made available by removing the two floatplanes, the catapult and their associated facilities. A proposal was made in 1942 to convert Vanguard to an aircraft carrier. The Director of Naval Construction stated that doing so along the lines of the would present no major difficulties but would require six months to redesign the ship. The proposal was formally rejected on 17 July. =General characteristics= Vanguard during NATO Operation Mainbrace, 1952 Vanguard had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship was significantly larger than her predecessors of the class, almost longer and displaced about more than the older ships at deep load. Vanguard was overweight by some , which magnified the difference. The ship had a complete double bottom deep and she was divided into 27 main compartments by watertight bulkheads. The King George V-class ships had been built with almost no sheer to the main deck forwards to allow 'A' turret to fire straight forward at zero elevation, resulting in those ships being wet forward. Vanguard was redesigned as a result of this experience, significant sheer and flare being added to the bow. The ship was well regarded as seaworthy, able to keep an even keel in rough seas. At full load, Vanguard had a metacentric height of . As a fleet flagship, her complement was 115 officers and 1,860 men in 1947. Air conditioning was provided for many of the ship's control spaces, and asbestos insulation was provided on exposed areas of the ship's sides, decks and bulkheads. Steam heating was provided for her armament, instruments, look-out positions and other equipment to make Vanguard suitable for operations in the Arctic. An Action Information Centre was fitted below the main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around Vanguard. =Propulsion= To save design time, the four-shaft unit machinery from the Lion-class battleship was duplicated with alternating boiler and engine rooms. Vanguard had four sets of single-reduction geared Parsons steam turbines housed in separate engine rooms. Each set consisted of one high- pressure and one low-pressure turbine, driving a propeller that was in diameter. The turbines were powered by eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers in four boiler rooms at a working pressure of and temperature of . The engines were designed to produce a total of and a speed of but achieved more than during the ship's sea trials in July 1946, when she reached a speed of . After trials, the three-bladed propellers on the inboard shafts were replaced by five-bladed propellers in a failed attempt to reduce vibrations of the inboard propeller shafts. Vanguard was designed to carry 4,850 long tons of fuel oil and of diesel fuel. With a clean bottom, she could steam at a speed of for . The ship had four turbogenerators and four diesel generators that supplied the common ring main at 220 volts. Their total output of was the largest of any British battleship. =Armament= The ship's main armament consisted of eight 42-calibre BL 15-inch Mk I guns in four twin hydraulically powered gun turrets, 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' from bow to stern. When the turrets were modernised to the Mk I(N) RP12 design, their maximum elevation was increased from 20¬∞ to +30¬∞, although the guns were loaded at +5¬∞. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this provided a maximum range of . These guns were also capable of firing the same projectiles while using supercharges which gave a maximum range of . Their rate of fire was two rounds per minute. Vanguard carried 100 shells per gun. The 15-inch turrets had been designed when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room and it was not cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement, which was adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder- handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire. The secondary armament consisted of sixteen 50-calibre QF 5.25-inch Mk I* dual-purpose guns in eight twin gun mounts. They had a maximum depression of ‚àí5¬∞ and a maximum elevation of 70¬∞. They fired an high-explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of . The improved RP10 spec 5.25 turrets on Vanguard were claimed to be fully automatic, with a power-rammed breech and automatic tracking and elevation under radar control enabling a rate of fire of about 18 rounds per minute. At maximum elevation, the guns had a maximum range of . 391 rounds were provided for each gun. Short-range air defence was provided by 73 Bofors 40 mm AA guns in a variety of mountings. Vanguard had ten sextuple- barrel power-operated mounts concentrated in the superstructure and stern, a twin-barrel mount on 'B' turret and 11 power-operated single mounts on the upper deck and rear superstructure. All mounts could depress to ‚àí10¬∞ and elevate to a maximum of +90¬∞. The gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The guns' rate of fire was approximately 120 rounds per minute. Space was not available to stow the standard allowance of 1,564 rounds per gun, and Vanguard carried only 1,269 rounds per gun. Two of the single guns on the quarterdeck were removed in 1949 and five others during a major refit in 1954. All of her multiple Bofors mounts were removed at this same time. =Fire control= Vanguard was unique among British battleships in having remote power control (RPC) for her main, secondary and tertiary guns along with the Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk X for surface fire control of the main armament. There were two director control towers (DCT) for the 15-inch guns, each carrying a \\"double cheese\\" Type 274 fire-control radar for range finding and spotting the fall of shot. Each DCT could control all four turrets while 'B' turret could control 'A' and 'X' turrets. 'X' turret could only control 'Y' turret. There were four American Mark 37 DCTs for the 5.25-inch guns, each carrying the twin domes of Type 275 gunnery radar. Each Mark VI sextuple 40 mm Bofors mounting was provided with a separate CRBF (\\"close range blind fire\\") director fitted with a Type 262 radar, although the ship never mounted her complete outfit of those directors. The STAAG Mk II 40 mm Bofors mounting carried its own Type 262 on the mounting itself. Other radar sets carried were Type 960 air and surface search, Type 293 target indication and Type 277 radar height finding. When the 15-inch gun turrets were modernised, their rangefinders were replaced by ones in all turrets except for 'A' and they were fitted for RPC in azimuth only. The turrets were also provided with de-humidifying equipment and insulation to improve their habitability. =Protection= Rear quarter view of Vanguard showing her transom stern The ship's armour scheme was based on that of the King George V class with a thinner waterline belt and additional splinter protection. Originally the belt armour was equal to that of the older ships but it had to be reduced to offset weight increases when the design was modified to reflect wartime experience. The waterline main belt was composed of Krupp cemented armour (KCA) thick but increased to abreast the magazines. It was high and tapered to a thickness of at the bottom edge of the belt. Fore and aft of the transverse bulkheads that closed off the central citadel, the belt continued almost to the ends of the ship. Forward it tapered to a thickness of and a height of and aft to the same thickness but a height of . At the aft end of the steering gear compartment was a transverse bulkhead. After the Battle of the Denmark Strait in 1941, non-cemented armour bulkheads were added on the sides of the magazines, to protect them from splinters from any hits from plunging shells that might have penetrated the ship's side beneath her belt. When the gun turrets from the First World War-era battlecruisers were modernised, their KCA faceplates were replaced by new ones 13 inches thick, and their roofs were replaced by non-cemented armour plates. Their sides remained in thickness. The barbettes for the 15-inch guns were 13 inches thick on the sides but tapered to closer to the centreline of the ship. The side and roof armour of the 5.25-inch turrets was thick. Their ammunition hoists were protected by armour thick. Intended to resist the impact of a armour-piercing bomb dropped from a height of , Vanguards deck protection was identical to that of the King George V class. It consisted of six-inch non-cemented armour over the magazines that reduced to over the machinery spaces. The armour continued forward and aft of the citadel at the lower-deck level. Forward it tapered in steps from five inches down to 2.5 inches near the bow. Aft, it protected the steering gear and propeller shafts with 4.5 inches of armour before tapering to a thickness of 2.5 inches near the stern. Unlike the Germans, French and Americans, the British no longer believed that heavy armour for the conning tower served any real purpose given that the chance of hitting it was very small; Vanguards conning tower was therefore protected with of armour on the face and 2.5 inches on the sides and rear. The secondary conning tower aft had of armour on its sides. Vanguards underwater protection was enhanced when she was redesigned in 1942 to reflect the lessons learned when Prince of Wales was sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers. It still consisted of a three-layer system of voids and liquid-filled compartments meant to absorb the energy of an underwater explosion. It was bounded on the inside by the torpedo bulkhead. Her enlarged oil tanks reduced the empty spaces that could flood and cause the ship to list and greater provision was made to pump these spaces out. The longitudinal bulkheads of the side protection system were raised one deck higher to further subdivide the spaces behind the waterline armour belt. The side protection system had a maximum depth of but this decreased significantly as the ship narrowed at its ends. Over the length of the citadel, this system was found to be proof against of TNT during full- scale trials. Construction and career Vanguard was laid down on 2 October 1941 by John Brown and Company of Clydebank, Scotland, with the yard number of 567. After the Japanese invasion of Malaya in December, the ship was given an A1 priority in the hope of finishing her by the end of 1944, and construction of the light cruiser HMS Bellerophon, as well as some merchant shipping, was halted to expedite the ship's completion. This was unsuccessful, however, due to a shortage of skilled labour. As a result, it was not until 30 November 1944 that the ship was launched. Princess Elizabeth presided over this ceremony, the first ship she ever launched, and was presented with a diamond rose brooch to commemorate the event. Two yard workers were killed and six others injured when a \\"blinding explosion ripped\\" the ship in a fitting-out basin at Clydebank on 16 September 1945. Captain William Gladstone Agnew assumed command on 15 October 1945. The end of hostilities following Japan's surrender reduced the need for new warships, and consequently the ship was not commissioned until 12 May 1946. By this time, a total of ¬£11,530,503, including ¬£3,186,868 for the modernisation of the main armament, had been spent on producing Vanguard. A Westland WS-51 Dragonfly coming in to land on the ship's foc'sle After commissioning, the ship spent several months conducting sea trials and training until August, when she began the necessary modifications to serve as a royal yacht for the forthcoming royal tour of South Africa. The Admiral's suite was reworked into accommodations for the Royal Family and their staff while the anti-aircraft mount on top of 'B' turret was replaced by a saluting platform. Agnew was promoted to rear-admiral with effect from 8 January 1947. The alterations were complete by December, and Vanguard made a shakedown cruise into the Central Atlantic and made a port visit to Gibraltar on the return voyage. Initially escorted by the destroyers , , , , and , the ship rendezvoused with the Home Fleet on 1 February 1947 to receive a 21-gun salute led by the battleships and , and the aircraft carrier . Later that morning, a Sikorsky R-4 helicopter landed aboard to pick up mail and photographic film. Vanguard arrived in Cape Town on 17 February, escorted by the South African frigates , and on the last leg of her voyage. While the Royal Family toured the country on the first visit by a reigning monarch to South Africa, the ship exercised with ships of the South African and Royal Navies stationed there and made port visits to a number of South African cities. She sailed for home on 22 April and made brief visits to Saint Helena and Ascension Island en route. Vanguard arrived in Portsmouth on 11 May, and Captain F. R. Parham relieved the newly promoted Agnew on 29 May. In July, the ship began an overhaul in Devonport, which lasted until August 1948. While she was refitting, Vanguard was tasked to carry the Royal Family on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, planned for January 1949. On 31 August, she began a shakedown cruise to the Mediterranean and returned to Devonport on 12 November. Around this time, Vanguard was considered, along with a number of other large warships, for conversion to carry anti-aircraft missiles, but nothing further was done along these lines. George VI was now too ill for travel, and the Royal Tour was indefinitely postponed later that month. Vanguard became the flagship of Admiral Sir Arthur Power, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, on 1 March 1949, and the ship made port visits to Algeria, France, Italy, Cyprus, Libya, Lebanon, Greece and Egypt before she arrived back at Devonport on 21 July. The newly promoted Rear Admiral Parham was relieved by Captain G. V. Gladstone a week later. The ship then became the flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron under Rear Admiral Edward Evans- Lombe on 12 November. While returning from a brief training sortie to Gibraltar, Vanguard went to the aid of a small French merchantman whose cargo had shifted in a severe storm on 13 February 1950. The merchantman, , was taken under tow and the cargo was redistributed. Once the storm had abated, Boffa was able to resume her voyage under her own power. Vanguard reached Weymouth Bay the following day. Later, in March, she fired the salute to Vincent Auriol, the President of France, during his state visit to Great Britain. Vanguard at anchor On 13 September 1950 Admiral Sir Philip Vian hoisted his flag as Commander in Chief, Home Fleet, on Vanguard and the ship joined the rest of Home Fleet on exercises with the Royal Canadian Navy and the Mediterranean Fleet. On 19 December, Vian transferred his flag to . Nearly two months later, on 10 February 1951, the aircraft carrier collided with Vanguard as the carrier docked at Gibraltar. The hole in the battleship's stern was not serious, and Vian re-hoisted his flag in Vanguard shortly afterwards. After manoeuvres with Indomitable, during which her aircraft \\"sank\\" the battleship, the ship made port visits in Genoa and Villefranche- sur-Mer before returning for a brief refit in Devonport on 14 March. After completing her refit in May, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron under Rear Admiral R. M. Dick at the Isle of Portland. Four months later the admiral transferred his flag to the carrier as Vanguard began another refit in preparation to again become the flagship of Home Fleet. Vanguard in Rotterdam, June 1952 Buckingham Palace announced in November that King George VI was planning to take a short cruise for his health aboard Vanguard, which meant that her Admiral's suite again had to be modified to accommodate him and his staff. Captain John Litchfield assumed command on 21 December while the ship was still refitting, but the King died on 6 February 1952 before he could make his cruise. A detachment from the ship participated in his funeral procession before she departed for her post-refit shakedown cruise on 22 February. After exercising with Implacable, Indomitable and the fast minelayer , Vanguard returned home on 29 March. She became flagship of Home Fleet again on 13 May when Admiral Sir George Creasy hoisted his flag. Due to manning and weight problems, Vanguard operated with many of her turrets unmanned and with ammunition carried for only two of the 15-inch turrets and only starshell ammunition for the 5.25-inch guns. She participated in exercises with the Dutch and American navies, before returning to Portsmouth for the holidays. Litchfield was relieved by Captain R. A. Ewing on 19 January 1953; the ship departed the next day for a brief refit at Gibraltar. After its completion on 2 March, the ship trained with several of the Royal Navy's carriers before arriving back at Portsmouth on 25 March. Vanguard participated in Queen Elizabeth's Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 15 June 1953. The following September, she participated in NATO's Exercise Mariner in the Denmark Strait. Howe in reserve at Devonport, 1956 Admiral Sir Michael Denny replaced Creasy as Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, on 5 January 1954 and Vanguard participated in Exercise Medflex A with Dutch and French ships in March. During the rest of the year she participated in anti-submarine and anti-aircraft exercises as well as making port visits to Oslo and Kristiansand in Norway and Helsingborg in Sweden. She was inspected on 11 July by King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden before returning home later that month. Denny struck his flag on 15 September, and Vanguard sailed to Devonport for a ¬£220,000 refit 10 days later. The February 1955 Defence Estimates had intended her as the Home Fleet flagship with a role as a killer, but after the appointment of Earl Mountbatten in April 1955 and with Antony Eden replacing Churchill as prime minister, the government decided instead to maintain two extra cruisers in the fleet, and Vanguard was placed in reserve when it completed its 1955 refit. She subsequently became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet when Vice Admiral Richard Onslow hoisted his flag on 28 November. While moored in Fareham Creek, during her time in the reserve fleet, waterline shots of Vanguard in Portsmouth Harbour were filmed for the title sequence of the 1957 comedy film Carry on Admiral. Just before decommissioning, scenes for the 1960 film Sink the Bismarck! were filmed aboard, with Vanguard being used to depict interiors of the bridges, Admiral's Quarters and gun turrets for Hood, Bismarck and King George V. = Decommissioning and fate = On 9 October 1959 the Admiralty announced that Vanguard would be scrapped, as she was considered obsolete and too expensive to maintain. She was decommissioned on 7 June 1960 and sold to BISCO for ¬£560,000. On 4 August 1960, when the ship was scheduled to be towed from Portsmouth to the breaker's yard at Faslane, Scotland, the whole of the Southsea sea front was packed with people who came to see her off. As Vanguard was being towed towards the harbour entrance, she slewed across the harbour and ran aground near the Still & West pub. She was pulled off by five tugboats an hour later, and made her final exit from Portsmouth. Five days later she arrived at Faslane, and by mid-1962 the demolition process was complete; she was the last British battleship to be scrapped. As a part of the scrapping process, sections of pre-atomic steel plate uncontaminated with radionuclides were recovered from Vanguard and used for the shielding of the whole body monitor at the Radiobiological Research Laboratory (now DSTL) at Alverstoke, Gosport in Hampshire, England.

Sewri has a fort that dates back to 1770. The Agri-Horticultural Society had established gardens at Sewri, which were acquired in 1865 by Arthur Crawford, then the Municipal Commissioner of Bombay, for building a European cemetery. Large parts of Sewri belong to the Bombay Port Trust and were incorporated into the harbour facilities. In 1996, the mangrove swamps of Sewri were declared a protected ecology. Lesser flamingos from other parts of India come to these mangroves to breed. The coastal area of locality includes the Sewri mudflats, a wetland.Sewri wetland to get global status?

His works include Fugue for a Darkening Island, The Inverted World, The Affirmation, The Glamour, The Prestige, and The Separation. Priest has been strongly influenced by the science fiction of H. G. Wells and in 2006 was appointed Vice-President of the international H. G. Wells Society. Early life Priest was born in Cheadle, Cheshire, England in 1943. As a child, Priest spent some time holidaying in the English county of Dorset. Here he explored the ancient hillfort of Maiden Castle, near Dorchester, which he would later use as the location for the novel A Dream of Wessex. Career Priest's first story, \\"The Run\\", was published in 1966. Formerly an accountant and audit clerk, he became a full-time writer in 1968. One of his early novels, The Affirmation, concerns a traumatized man who apparently flips into a delusional world in which he experiences a lengthy voyage to an archipelago of exotic islands. This setting featured in many of Priest's short stories, which raises the question of whether the Dream Archipelago is actually a fantasy.https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/10/its-time-christopher-priests- devout-congregation-extended-beyond-sci-fi-enthusiasts/ The state of mind depicted in this novel is similar to that of the delusional fantasy-prone psychoanalytic patient (\\"Kirk Allen\\") in Robert Lindner's The Fifty-Minute Hour, or Jack London's tortured prisoner in The Star Rover. Priest also dealt with delusional alternate realities in A Dream of Wessex, in which a group of experimenters for a British government project are brain-wired to a hypnosis machine and jointly participate in an imaginary but as-real-as-real future in a vacation island off the coast of a Sovietized Britain. His most recent novels are The Islanders (2011), set in the Dream Archipelago, and The Adjacent (2013), a multi-strand narrative with recurring characters. Of his narrative's plot twists, Priest told an interviewer in 1995, \\"my shocks are based on a sudden devastating reversal of what the reader knows or believes.\\"Interview with David Langford, 1995 = Tie-in work= Priest wrote the tie-in novel to accompany the 1999 David Cronenberg movie eXistenZ, which contains themes of the novels A Dream of Wessex and The Extremes. Such themes include the question of the extent to which we can trust what we believe to be reality and our memories. Priest was approached to write stories for the 18th and 19th seasons of Doctor Who. The first, \\"Sealed Orders\\", was a political thriller based on Gallifrey commissioned by script editor Douglas Adams; it was eventually abandoned due to script problems and replaced with \\"Warriors' Gate\\". The second, \\"The Enemy Within\\", was also eventually abandoned due to script problems and what Priest perceived as insulting treatment after he was asked to modify the script to include the death of Adric. It was replaced by \\"Earthshock\\". Priest received payment while Doctor Who producer John Nathan- Turner and script editor Eric Saward were forced to pen a letter of apology for the treatment of the writer. This falling-out soured the attitude of the production office to the use of established literary authors, and no more were commissioned until Neil Gaiman authored the episode \\"The Doctor's Wife\\" in 2011. A film of his novel The Prestige was released on 20 October 2006. It was directed by Christopher Nolan and starred Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. Despite differences between the novel and screenplay, Nolan was reportedly so concerned the denouement be kept a surprise that he blocked plans for a lucrative US tie-in edition of the book. = Pseudonyms = * Priest uses the pseudonyms John Luther Novak and Colin Wedgelock, usually for movie novelizations. As well as the eXistenZ novelization (which undermined the pseudonym by including Priest's biography on the pre-title page), he has novelised the movies Mona Lisa (as John Luther Novak) and Short Circuit (as Colin Wedgelock).http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/priest_christopher * Priest has co-operated with fellow British science fiction author David Langford on various enterprises under the Ansible brand. = Other writing = Priest has written for The Guardian since 2002, largely obituaries of such figures as Robert Sheckley, Stanislaw Lem, Jack Williamson, Diana Wynne Jones, John Christopher and many more. Awards and honours Priest has won the BSFA award for the best novel four times: in 1974 for Inverted World; in 1998 for The Extremes; in 2002 for The Separation and in 2011 for The Islanders. He has won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction and the World Fantasy Award (for The Prestige). He won the BSFA award for short fiction in 1979 for the short story \\"Palely Loitering\\"; and has been nominated for Hugo Awards in the categories of Best Novel, Best Novella, Best Novelette, and Best Non- Fiction Book (this last for The Book on the Edge of Forever (also known as Last Deadloss Visions), an exploration of the unpublished Last Dangerous Visions anthology). The Space Machine won the International SF prize in the 1977 Ditmar Awards . Priest's 1979 essay \\"The Making of the Lesbian Horse\\" (published as a Novacon chapbook) takes a humorous look at the roots of his acclaimed novel Inverted World. He was guest of honour at Novacon 9 in 1979 and Novacon 30 in 2000, and at the 63rd World Science Fiction Convention in 2005. In 1983 Priest was named one of the 20 Granta Best of Young British Novelists. In 1988 he won the Kurd-La√üwitz-Preis for The Glamour as Best Foreign Fiction Book. Between 7 November and 7 December 2007, the Chelsea College of Art and Design had an exhibition in its gallery Chelsea Space inspired by Priest's novel The Affirmation. It followed \\"themes of personal history and memory (which) through the lens of a more antagonistic and critical form of interpretation, aims to point towards an overtly positive viewpoint on contemporary art practice over any traditional melancholy fixation\\". Personal life Priest lived in Devon but now lives on Isle of Bute.https://www.buteman.co.uk/news/bute-writers-make-up-half-the-best-novel- nominations-1-4701347 He was married to writer Lisa Tuttle from 1981 to 1987 and to Leigh Kennedy from 1988 to 2011, with whom he had twins.

It is one of the two peninsulas of Mumbai while the other being Worli. During Portuguese rule in the 16th century, the island was known as Candil. After the British took over the island in the late 17th century, it was known as Colio. History Seven Islands of Bombay, before reclamation The name Colaba comes from Kolabhat, a word in the language of Kolis, the indigenous inhabitants of the islands, before the arrival of the Portuguese. The area that is now Colaba was originally a region consisting of two islands: Colaba and Little Colaba (or Old Woman's Island). The island of Colaba was one of the Seven Islands of Bombay ruled by the Portuguese. The Portuguese had acquired these lands from the Sultanate of Cambay by the Treaty of Bassein (1534). The group of islands was given by Portugal to Charles II of England as a dowry when he married Catherine of Braganza in 1661. The cession of Bombay and dependencies was strongly resented by Portuguese officials in Goa and Bombay, who resisted transfer of possession for several years, while the English representatives were confined to the island of Anjediva while negotiations continued. Angered by the back-tracking, Charles II leased these lands to the British East India Company for a nominal annual rent. Gerald Aungier, second Governor of Bombay (1672), and the president of the English settlement of Surat, took possession of Colaba and Old Woman's Island on behalf of the Company in 1675. Portugal continued to hold Little Colaba island for several decades more before ceding it to the English in about 1762, subject to the retention of Portuguese ownership of a house on the island, that is now the Blessed Sacrament Chapel in Middle Colaba. This was leased by the Portuguese Government of Goa to the Bishop of Damao, the head of the Padroado party in Bombay, as his residence. After an attempt by the Propaganda Fide party to seize the chapel, a court ruled that the house remained the property of the Government of Portugal and evicted the Propaganda Fide party. Old Bombay, 1909Ambitious reclamation plans from 1912 have been only partly realised. Colaba Chapel, Bombay (Clutterbuck, 1889, p. 173) In 1743, British Colaba was leased to Richard Broughton at Rs. 200 yearly, and the lease was renewed in 1764. By 1796, Colaba had become a cantonment. Colaba was known for the variety of fishes - the bombil (Bombay duck), rawas, halwa, turtles, crabs, prawns and lobsters. A Colaba Observatory, a meteorological observatory was established in 1826 in the part that was called Upper Colaba. The Colaba Causeway was completed in 1838, and thus, the remaining two islands were joined to the others. Gradually, Colaba became a commercial center, after the Cotton Exchange was opened at Cotton Green in 1844. The real estate prices in the area went up. The Colaba Causeway was widened in 1861 and 1863. One of the Colonial-era buildings opposite Regal Cinema Colaba became a separate municipality ward in 1872. The Sick Bungalows (now known as INHS Ashvini) were built in the 19th century. The construction of the Anglican church of St. John the Evangelist (now known as Afghan Church after the First Afghan War of 1838) began in 1847. The Church was consecrated in 1858, with the work on the steeple being concluded in 1865. The horse-drawn tram-cars were introduced in 1873 by Stearns and Kitteredge, who had their offices on the west side of the Causeway, where the Electric House now stands. The Prong's lighthouse was constructed at the southern tip of the island in 1875. The eponymous Sassoon Docks were built by David Sassoon on reclaimed land in the same year. The BB&CI; Railways established the Colaba railway station or terminus, the site of which is now occupied by the Badhwar Park layout. The development of Colaba pushed the native kolis to the edges of the island. The Bombay City Improvement Trust reclaimed around on the western shore of Colaba. Eminent citizens of Mumbai, such as Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, opposed the work, fearing that the reclamation would depress prices of land. However, the reclamation work continued and was completed in 1905. There was no fall in the land prices. In 1906, a seafront road with a raised sea-side promenade was completed, and named as \\"Cuffe Parade\\" after T. W. Cuffe of the Trust.  Present  The Gateway of India, the art deco style Regal Theatre, the cafes (Caf√© Mondegar, Cafe Royal and Leopold Cafe), and the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Royal Bombay Yacht Club, Bademiya Restaurant and Bagdadi restaurant, as well as a number of modern pubs, restaurants and clubs all add to the atmosphere. The southern tip is occupied by a military cantonment, including the large Navy Nagar layout built on reclaimed land known as Holiday Camp. The older parts of the cantonment retains its large, wooded spaces and is the only bit of green left in this otherwise congested area. In the midst of Navy Nagar lies the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), one of India's leading scientific institutions. Colaba is renowned for high-end boutiques and imitation consumer goods, and is popular with tourists. Notable residents include Ratan Tata, Anil Ambani, and Ravi Shastri. Colaba Causeway, or just \\"Causeway\\" as it is known in Mumbai, offers everything from bracelets to perfumes to clothes to watches, clocks, DVDs and CDs. It has an old English charm and a very modern feel as well. Colaba is also the art center of Mumbai, with all the major galleries and museums located in and around this area. Even today, in 2020, the government has managed to preserve most of its colonial- era architectures. A 180¬∞ panoramic view of Colaba. Colaba is home to the Cooperage Football Ground.

In December 2013, a new link road was opened in Cambridge connecting the Addenbrooke's Road to the southern side of the hospital opposite the Rosie extension. This road was named Dame Mary Archer Way in recognition of the achievements of the former chairman. Personal life=Marriage= She married Jeffrey Archer in July 1966, having met him at Oxford University, where he had been studying for a Diploma in Education. They have two children: William Archer (born 1972), a theatre producer, and James Archer (born 1974), a financial advisor and businessman. The Archers live in the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, near Cambridge. In the summer of 1974, the Archers were struck by a financial crisis when Jeffrey lost over ¬£400,000 in a bad investment. Faced with the threat of bankruptcy, the Archers were forced to move out of their large house in The Boltons. Mary Archer took up a teaching post at Cambridge University which, together with her husband's eventual success as a novelist, saved them from financial ruin. In 1987 she gave evidence at the High Court in a libel case brought by her husband against the Daily Star newspaper, which claimed Jeffrey had slept with a prostitute. In 2001, when Jeffrey Archer was accused of having committed perjury in the 1987 trial, she appeared at the Old Bailey to defend him.\\"Mary Archer: For better and worse\\", BBC News, 2001 Jeffrey Archer was subsequently convicted and imprisoned for perjury and perverting the course of justice. The trial judge, Mr Justice Potts, questioned the veracity of Lady Archer's evidence, suggesting that she too had perjured herself. However, no further action was taken. In 2003, she took her former personal assistant to court over an alleged breach of confidentiality. Lady Archer sought a permanent injunction against Williams, claiming she had stolen confidential documents about the family, and had planned to sell the information to the media. Williams had previously taken Lady Archer to an industrial tribunal over claims of unfair dismissal. Between 1991 and 1999 she sat on the council of Cheltenham Ladies' College. She sings first alto and in 1988 released a CD of Christmas carols, titled A Christmas Carol. In 2011, she explained she had recently undergone major surgery for bladder cancer.

Designed by British architect Claude Batley, it serves as a major stop for both Local and Inter-City/Express trains with separate platforms for them. It is also a terminal for several long distance trains including the Mumbai Rajdhani Express. It is one of the five major Terminal stations in Mumbai while others being Mumbai CST, Mumbai LTT, Mumbai BDTS and Mumbai Dadar. Trains depart from the station connecting various destinations mostly across states in the northern, western and north-western parts of India. The station was renamed from Bombay Central to Mumbai Central in 1997, following the change of Bombay to Mumbai. In 2018, a resolution was passed to change the station code to MMCT, with implementation ongoing. An Inside View of Mumbai Central Station History The Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway extended its reach from Baroda to Pathankot via Delhi. The Colaba-Ballard Pier Railway Station proved insufficient in meeting the demands of a growing population which led the government to make plans for the construction of Bombay Central. The present suburban route that once ran till Colaba was earlier served by Bellasis Road station. It was renamed Bombay Central (local) after the construction of the long distance Bombay Central Terminus (BCT) on the eastern side. On 1 Feb 2018, a resolution was passed to change the station code from BCT to MMCT. When the station opened in 1930, The Times of India suggested that the name Bombay Central was inspired by the Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The paper argued that the station should have been called Kamathipura, after the area it was located in. The paper suggested that the name Kamathipura was probably ruled out, because the area is a red light district. Infrastructure=Platforms and Layout= The station is divided into two parts. The eastern half of the station serves long distance trains operated by Western Railways while the western half serves commuter trains running on the Churchgate-Virar suburban section of Western Railways. The mainline section has five high level platforms terminating in a large concourse on the southern end. The suburban section has four high level platforms. All the platforms are connected by foot overbridges and the mainline platforms are wheelchair accessible from the south end. =Tickets and reservation= A large Passenger Reservation Center with several ticket windows is located on the east side of the mainline station. Tickets between any two stations in India on any train offering reserved accommodation can be purchased from this facility. There are many Unreserved Ticket Counters in the main concourse for purchasing unreserved tickets for immediate travel on express and passenger trains starting from Mumbai Central. The west and south exits of the suburban section of the station have ticket windows for purchasing tickets for travel on the suburban trains. Suburban train tickets can also be purchased from Automatic Ticket Vending Machines (ATVMs) located at several locations in the station premises. =Food and other facilities= The concourse on the mainline side has an outlet of Rajdhani chain of restaurants (not to be confused with the train, Rajdhani Express ) serving authentic Indian food. Bellasis Rail Caf√© at Mumbai Central is located on the first floor near Bellasis Road overbridge connecting Mumbai Central station near the south end booking office. Items in this caf√© are available in food packets, with ready to take away facility. There are several stalls in the concourse and on the suburban platforms serving snacks, chips, bottled water and cold drinks (soda). There are book stalls in the main concourse and on the suburban platforms selling newspapers, magazines and other reading material. Train timetables are also available at the book stalls. Restrooms (toilets) are available in the concourse on the mainline side. =Gardens= There are two gardens located outside the station. One of the gardens houses a historic locomotive, popularly known as the \\"Little red horse\\". The locomotive was built by English firm Kerr Stuart and Co. in 1928. The engine operated on the Devgarh-Baria Railway Narrow Gauge line, owned by the Princely state of Devgarh-Baria. The line was merged into Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway (BB&CI;) in August 1949, and later became part of the Western Railway. The engine served for 61 years, before being transferred to the Pratapnagar workshop for shunting duties in 1990. It was placed at the garden in front of the Mumbai Central station in 1991 to commemorate its platinum jubilee. =WiFi Services= RailTel, the telecom arm of the Indian Railways, on 22 January 2016 launched free public Wi-Fi service at Mumbai Central station in collaboration with Google. ‚ÄúWe are delighted to launch India's first high-speed public Wi-Fi service in partnership with Indian Railways,\\" Google South East Asia and India VP & Managing Director Rajan Anandan said.

At 2150 hrs, when the task group was south of Karachi, they detected Pakistani naval vessels. Nirghat launched 2 SS-N-2 Styx missiles on the largest target, which was Khaibar, 45 miles to its northwest. Both missiles struck the destroyer, sinking it. Khaibar went down with most hands on board. A Pakistani minesweeper, , was also sunk and another destroyer, was severely damaged, later scrapped as a result. The missile boats then hit the fuel storage tanks at Karachi Harbour, setting them ablaze.

It is also important because of the diamond trading industry located here, mainly in the Panchratna and Prasad chambers building near the railway station. Charni Road eastern entrance The station derives its name from the fact that grazing lands for cattle and horses were located nearby in earlier days (Charne in Marathi means to graze). In 1838, the British rulers introduced a 'grazing fee' which several cattle-owners could not afford. Therefore, Sir Jamshedji Jeejeebhoy spent 20,000 from his own purse for purchasing some grasslands near the seafront at Thakurdwar and saw that the starving cattle grazed without a fee in that area. In time the area became known as \\"Charni\\" meaning grazing. When a railway station on the BB&CI; railway was constructed there it was called Charni Road. The BB&CI; line from Back Bay to Virar opened in 1867. There have also been some controversies during its renovation. Today Charni road is well known for its old charm Chawls, wholesale markets of diamonds (Opera House), garments, Irani caf√©s traditional Maharashtrian culture (Girgaon) and also tall skyscrapers.

It is available under Microsoft's Open Specification Promise. The acronym originally stood for Extensible Avalon Markup Language, Avalon being the code-name for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).Rob Relyea : January 2004 - Posts XAML is used extensively in .NET Framework 3.0 & .NET Framework 4.0 technologies, particularly Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Silverlight, Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Runtime XAML Framework and Windows Store apps. In WPF, XAML forms a user interface markup language to define UI elements, data binding, events, and other features. In WF, workflows can be defined using XAML. XAML can also be used in Silverlight applications, Windows 10 Mobile (previously Windows Phone) and Universal Windows Platform apps, also called Windows Store apps. XAML elements map directly to Common Language Runtime object instances, while XAML attributes map to Common Language Runtime properties and events on those objects. XAML files can be created and edited with visual design tools like Microsoft Expression Blend, Microsoft Visual Studio, and the hostable Windows Workflow Foundation visual designer. They can also be created and edited with a standard text editor, a code editor like XAMLPad, or a graphical editor like Vector Architect. Anything that is created or implemented in XAML can be expressed using a more traditional .NET language, such as C# or Visual Basic .NET. However, a key aspect of the technology is the reduced complexity needed for tools to process XAML, because it is based on XML. Consequently, a variety of products are emerging, particularly in the WPF space, which create XAML- based applications. As XAML is simply based on XML, developers and designers are able to share and edit content freely amongst themselves without requiring compilation. XAML also benefits from being a declarative definition of the UI rather than procedural code to generate it. Technology A XAML file can be compiled into a .BAML file (Binary Application Markup Language), which may be inserted as a resource into a .NET Framework assembly. At run-time, the framework engine extracts the .BAML file from assembly resources, parses it, and creates a corresponding WPF visual tree or workflow. When used in Windows Presentation Foundation, XAML is used to describe visual user interfaces. WPF allows for the definition of both 2D and 3D objects, rotations, animations, and a variety of other effects and features. When used in Windows Workflow Foundation contexts, XAML is used to describe potentially long-running declarative logic, such as those created by process modeling tools and rules systems. The serialization format for workflows was previously called XOML, to differentiate it from UI markup use of XAML, but now they are no longer distinguished. However, the file extension for files containing the workflow markup is still \\"XOML\\".MSDN forum post by the WF product managerRuleML and BPEL are other examples of XML-based declarative logic languages =Templates= XAML uses a specific way to define look and feel called Templates; differing from Cascading Style Sheet syntax, it is closer to XBL. Example This Windows Presentation Foundation example shows the text \\"Hello, world!\\" in the top-level XAML container called Canvas. Hello, world! The schema (the xmlns=\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170705010515/http://schemas.microsoft.com/...\\" part) may have to be changed to work on your computer. Using a schema that Microsoft recommends, the example can also beMicrosoft XAML Overview page at XAML Overview (Root element and xmlns) Hello, world! This can be integrated into a Web page if WPF is installed using XBAPs (XAML Browser Applications) that are compiled applications running in a sandboxed environment hosted within the browser. Another way is to use the Silverlight plugin. The code cannot be included directly in an HTML page; rather it must be loaded into the page via JavaScript. If .NET 3.0 or later is installed, loose XAML files can also be viewed on their own in a compatible Web browser (including Internet Explorer and Firefox) in conjunction with the .NET Framework 3.0, without the need for the Silverlight plugin.Windows Presentation Foundation on the Web: Web Browser Applications - MSDN Loose XAML files are markup-only files limited to defining the visual content to be rendered. They are not compiled with an application. The MySilverlight.js file must contain the code that loads the above XAML code (as an XML file) under the MySilverlight HTML element. A crucial part of utilizing XAML to its full potential is making appropriate usage of binding, as well as being comfortable with creating your own custom user elements as required, for your specific needs. Binding can be done as follows: Differences between versions of XAML There are four Microsoft main implementations of XAML: * The Windows Presentation Foundation version, which is used for the .NET Framework beginning with .NET Framework 3.0 * The Silverlight 3 version * The Silverlight 4 version * The Windows 8 XAML/Jupiter version These versions have some differences in the parsing behavior. Additionally, the Silverlight 4 XAML parser is not 100% backward compatible with Silverlight 3 files. Silverlight 3 accepted XAML files may not be accepted or are parsed differently by the Silverlight 4 parser. Criticism of XAML GUI usage in Silverlight The European Committee for Interoperable Systems said in 2007 that Microsoft's use of XAML in its Silverlight product aimed to introduce content on the World Wide Web that could only be accessed from the Windows platform. Using a plugin, XAML is viewable in some non- Microsoft browsers on Windows, Linux, and Mac; and Microsoft supported Novell's Silverlight viewer for GNU/Linux called Moonlight. As of January 2010, Moonlight 2 was compatible with Silverlight 2, but development of Moonlight was later discontinued.

Plot summary Juliette is raised in a convent. However, at age thirteen she is seduced by a woman who immediately explains that morality, religion and other such concepts are meaningless. There are plenty of similar philosophical musings during the book, all attacking the ideas of God, morals, remorse, love, etc., the overall conclusion being that the only aim in life is \\"to enjoy oneself at no matter whose expense.\\" Juliette takes this to the extreme and manages to murder her way through numerous people, including various family members and friends. As in Justine, there are several explicit references connecting an abundance of food to physical love and sexual pleasure. After an orgy, at the beginning of the book, Delbene says \\"Good plentiful food makes one efficient for physical love\\" and later chapters mention alcohol and \\"splendid wine and opulent food\\". During Juliette's life from age 13 to about 30, the wanton anti-heroine engages in virtually every form of depravity and encounters a series of like-minded libertines. She meets the ferocious Clairwil, whose main passion is in murdering young men and boys as revenge for the man's brutality to her sex. She meets Saint Fond, a 50-year-old multi-millionaire who commits incest with his daughter, murders his father, tortures young girls to death on a daily basis and even plots an ambitious scheme to provoke a famine that will wipe out half the population of France. In her journeys she also becomes acquainted with Minski, a nomadic, ogre-like Muscovite, who delights in raping and torturing young boys and girls to death and consuming the remains. =Real people in Juliette= A long audience with Pope Pius VI is one of the most extensive scenes in Juliette. The heroine shows off her learning to the pope (whom she most often addresses by his secular name \\"Braschi\\") with a verbal catalogue of alleged immoralities committed by his predecessors. The audience ends, like almost every other scene in the narrative, with an orgy (Pius is portrayed as a secret libertine himself). Soon after this, the male character Brisatesta narrates two scandalous encounters. The first is with \\"Princess Sophia, niece of the King of Prussia\\", who has just married \\"the Stadtholder\\" at the Hague. This is presumably intended for Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange, who married William V of Orange, the last Dutch Stadtholder, in 1767, and was still alive when Juliette was published thirty years later. The second encounter is with Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia. Publication and reception Both Justine and Juliette were published anonymously. Napoleon ordered the arrest of the author, and as a result de Sade was incarcerated without trial for the last thirteen years of his life. The essay (Excursus II) \\"Juliette or Enlightenment and Morality\\" in Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947) analyzes Juliette as the embodiment of the philosophy of enlightenment. They write: \\"she demonizes Catholicism as the most-up-to- date mythology, and with it civilization as a whole [‚Ä¶] her procedures are enlightened and efficient as she goes about her work of sacrilege [‚Ä¶] She favours system and consequence.\\"Theodor W.

It is also the name of a railway station on the Mumbai suburban railway, which lies along the Harbour line, which is a part of the Central Railway. There was an earlier Cotton Green in Colaba that is marked in old maps. That location is now part of Badhwar Park. Cotton was shipped from this location as recently as 1910. Etymology The station is named Cotton Green after an Art Deco building of the \\"Cotton Exchange\\" and a series of warehouses. The older Cotton Green in Colaba was thus named because it was in a village green and housed the original cotton exchange. One more possibility is as follows. The station is named Cotton Green after an Art Deco building of the \\"Cotton Exchange\\" and a series of warehouses. The older Cotton Green in Colaba was thus named because it was in a village green and housed the original cotton exchange. In the 18th century the area around the only English church (Today's St. Thomas Church at Fort, Bombay (Mumbai)) was situated on what is called as the Green, a spacious area that continued from the Fort thereto, and was pleasantly laid out in walks planted with trees. The area was naturally called ‚ÄòBombay Green‚Äô. Due to the area's proximity to the docks and the piled bales of Cotton for trade thereat, it came to be referred as ‚ÄòCotton Green‚Äô. In 1844, cotton trade was shifted from this area to further south at Colaba. The new locality came to be called rather predictably as ‚ÄòNew Cotton Green‚Äô. Subsequently, due to further remodeling and reclamation, the cotton trade at ‚ÄòNew Cotton Green‚Äô was shifted to ‚ÄòSewri-Mazgaon‚Äô reclamation area, where a spacious Cotton Exchange Building was also built. The Rail Station opposite this Cotton Exchange Building was for obvious reasons named \\"Cotton Green\\".  History  thumb The Cotton Exchange Building was built in 1924 and used for trading in Cotton until the 1945. The building originally was in a minty green colour, today it stands tall in beige and brown around the edges and has been fully restored to its former glory. The building is a stunning example of engineering and has not needed any maintenance except replacement of glass windows which are shattered by cricket balls as children play cricket on roads around the building. Overview The railway station caters to the area called Kalachowki, Ferbandar and Ghodapdeo. Kalachowki is a big residential area consisting of a colony called Abhyudaya Nagar which has 43 MHADA-built (Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority) housing, intended those who worked in the textile mills in the area. The colony has now turned into prime residential and commercial property, and is no longer owned by MHADA. Because of its proximity to Mumbai's prime central areas such as Dadar (15-minute drive) and Parel, Lower Parel and Worli (20‚Äì25 minutes' drive) Kalachowki also has another big colony called Labour Docks, which also belonged to MHADA. This area saw the development of numerous high-rise apartments (going up to 30 floors).

Many of the faithful attest to the miraculous powers of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The shrine attracts people from all faiths who pray to the Virgin Mary for expressing their gratitude or requesting favours. The church was destroyed in 1738 during a raid by the Marathas. During the Bandra Fair, the entire area is decorated with festoons and buntings. Many pitch up stalls to sell religious articles, roasted grams, snacks and sweets.

The statue of the Virgin Mary Statue of Mother Mary outside Mount Mary Church, Bandra. Although the current church edifice is just 100 years old, the history behind the current statue of Our Lady goes back to the 16th century when Jesuit priests from Portugal brought the statue to the current location and constructed a chapel. In 1700 Arab pirates interested in the gilt-lined object held in the hand disfigured the statue by cutting off the right hand. In 1760, the church was rebuilt and the statue was substituted with a statue of Our Lady of Navigators in St. Andrew's Church nearby. This statue has an interesting legend. It goes that a Koli fisherman dreamt that he would find a statue in the sea. The statue was found floating in the sea between 1700 and 1760. A Jesuit Annual Letter dated to 1669 and published in the book St. Andrew's Church, Bandra (1616-1966) supports this claim. The Koli Fishermen call the statue as Mot Mauli, literally meaning The Pearl Mother (Mot being corruption of the word \\"mount\\" and Mauli, meaning Mother). However, the previous statue is now restored and now enjoys the place of honour in the basilica.

Situated on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond, it is the most southerly of the Munros. Ben Lomond lies within the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park and the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, property of the National Trust for Scotland. Its accessibility from Glasgow and elsewhere in central Scotland, together with the relative ease of ascent from Rowardennan, makes it one of the most popular of all the Munros. On a clear day, it is visible from the higher grounds of Glasgow and across Strathclyde. Ben Lomond summit can also be seen from Ben Nevis, the highest peak in Britain, over away. The West Highland Way runs along the western base of the mountain, by the loch. Ben Lomond's popularity in Scotland has resulted in several namesakes in the former British colonies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States ‚Äì see this list. The mountain is mentioned directly in the popular folk song \\"The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond\\". Etymology The name Ben Lomond is generally agreed to mean \\"beacon mountain\\" or \\"beacon hill\\". Lomond is of Brittonic origin and derived from the element lumon meaning \\"a beacon\\" (Welsh llumon). This element, persevered in Scots as lum meaning \\"chimney\\", is found in other hill-names such as the Lomond Hills in Fife and Pumlumon in Wales. Like these hills, Ben Lomond is likely to have been perceived as a central point, probably the meeting-point of several territorial boundaries, where a signal beacon may have been frequently lit. Geography and geology Ben Lomond above Loch Lomond, as seen from the slopes of Beinn Narnain. Ben Lomond has a craggy summit which appears conical when viewed from the nearby Arrochar Alps range. The mountain comprises two parallel south-southeasterly ridges: the Sr√≤n Aonaich ridge to the east and the Ptarmigan ridge to the west. North of the summit these ridges come together and lead to a col with Cruin a' Bheinn, a Graham. The summit is grassy and rocky and is marked by a triangulation pillar Ben Lomond's geology is dominated by granite, mica schist, diorite, porphyry and quartzite. Ben Lomond lies on the Scottish watershed, the drainage divide which separates river systems that flow to the east from those that flow to the west. Ascent routes The usual route up Ben Lomond is via the 'tourist path', a wide, eroded and easy path which is roughly paved in steeper sections. This track was created owing to the mountain's status as one of the most popular in Scotland and climbs the gentle Sr√≤n Aonaich ridge, before ascending a steeper section to the rocky summit ridge. An alternative route follows the Ptarmigan ridge to the summit along a steeper and rockier path. The Ptarmigan path is the second most popular route, followed by a third route which approaches from Gleann Dubh. Despite the comparative ease of the tourist route, Ben Lomond can present a significant challenge to inexperienced walkers, especially in poor weather conditions. A dedicated Lomond Mountain Rescue Team has existed since 1967 to assist walkers and climbers on Ben Lomond and other surrounding peaks. Image:Ben Lomond - summit ridge.jpgA walker descending by the tourist route, seen from the summit in January 2010. Image:Ben Lomond from Ptarmigan.jpgThe summit of Ben Lomond seen from high on the Ptarmigan ridge in January 2010. Fauna The higher regions of the mountain support an alpine tundra ecozone, hosting bird species including peregrine falcon, merlins, rock ptarmigan, red grouse and golden eagles. A study by the British Trust for Ornithology found that Ben Lomond may host the most southerly breeding ptarmigan population in Scotland, following the decline of populations on Goatfell and the Arran mountains, possibly as a result of climate change. In addition to natural wildlife, the mountain area supports sheep farming. The National Trust for Scotland is tasked with maintaining a land management programme which sustains a balance of natural habitat conservation and the availability of land for grazing. Memorial Park and National Park Since 1995, the area around Ben Lomond, including the mountain summit, has been designated as a war memorial, called the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park. The park is dedicated to those who gave their lives in the First and Second World Wars and was created out of the former Rowardennan Estate with the support of the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Memorial Park was officially opened on Armistice Day in 1997 by the Rt Hon Donald Dewar, then Secretary of State for Scotland and who later became the first First Minister of Scotland. At the opening ceremony he unveiled a granite sculpture by Doug Cocker, a Scottish artist who had won a competition organised by the Scottish Sculpture Trust to design a permanent monument for the park. At the time of its creation, management of the Memorial Park was entrusted to the NTS, Forestry Commission and the now defunct Scottish Office. In 2002, the Scottish Parliament created the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, the first national park in Scotland. The national park includes the whole of Ben Lomond National Memorial Park.

It has a railway station on the Mumbai suburban railway on the Western Line. An extension of the Harbour Line was completed in 2018 because of which it has regular trains to CST on the Harbour line. This is in addition to existing trains to Churchgate on the Western Line. Owing to the rapid urbanization (mainly due to construction of metro lines) and growing population of metropolitan Mumbai, Goregaon, which was once merely a hilly forest region is now a crowded suburb of Mumbai. Gokuldham in Goregaon (East)  Transport  Goregaon Railway Station is the transport hub of Goregaon. The station currently has seven platforms, two of which are new harbor-line platforms, and was expanded as a part of the Harbour Line extension (under MUTP 2) from Andheri.http://mmrda.maharashtra.gov.in/mumbai-urban-transport-project-2 The expansion, involving two additional platforms and an elevated deck with passenger amenities (on the western side of the existing station) has been completed in 2018. A recently constructed skywalk connects one of the foot- over-bridges to S. V. Road near Citi Centre, a shopping complex near the M. G. Road junction. BEST has bus stations on both western as well as the eastern side of the railway station. Goregaon Depot, however, is located away from the railway station, on the Link Road. The link road has seen an increase in the traffic of late after the commencement of the Mumbai Metro construction work. Now there is a new flyover bridge at Ram Mandir road connecting Goregaon West and East. Also Ram Mandir railway station is operational since December 2016. The next important transport project for Goregaon will be the GMLR (Goregaon Mulund Link Road) which will be a 5km underground road consisting of two tunnels each having three lanes. This road will link Goregaon to Bhandup. The upcoming Metro line (Line 2) between Dahisar to Mankhurd will further improve the connectivity of this western suburb with the far-off eastern suburbs of the city. Currently, this section of the Metro Rail Project is under construction.

The area is home to a diverse flora and fauna. Aarey Colony and high-rises in the background Recent 'development' on the eastern side has led to a huge amount of deforestation.

Several references are made to him in Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, in which a series of anti- German jokes start with a horse theft, several references are made to German travellers in England and to a German duke who is not expected to come to Windsor. Arms of Frederick I, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, KG Frederick of M√∂mpelgard was born in Montb√©liard. He was heir apparent to the dukedom of W√ºrttemberg when he visited Windsor and other English cities in 1592. He developed a desire to be made a Knight of the Garter and solicited Queen Elizabeth for the honor repeatedly. After he had inherited the dukedom and become more prominent in affairs, she admitted him to the order. In a calculated slight, he was not informed of his admission in time to attend the investiture in spring 1597, the ceremony for which The Merry Wives of Windsor was written. Thus references to M√∂mpelgard's earlier visit and his not being in Windsor were jokes intended for the play's first audience, and appear in the First Folio edition of the play, taken from the first private performance, but not in the 1602 Quarto derived from public theatrical production. In May 1604 King James I sent William Dethick to invest Frederick in the order, and he presented jewels including two garters with diamonds and rubies, and two St Georges with diamonds and rubies, and a gold chain or collar, made by the London goldsmiths, John Spilman and William Herrick.HMC Laing Manuscripts at the University of Edinburgh, vol. 1 (London, 1914), pp. 93-7. In 1599, Frederick I issued an order that a new town should be established at the northern extremity of the Black Forest by the name of Freudenstadt. The aim was for the town to become the new residence of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg as it was closer to M√∂mpelgard than the W√ºrttemberg capital Stuttgart. However, Frederick I died in 1608, aged 50, in Stuttgart, and his plans never came to fruition. The sons of Frederick I established the ducal house of W√ºrttemberg-Neuenstadt, a branch line of the House of W√ºrttemberg after a F√ºrstbr√ºderlicher Vergleich  a mutual agreement made between ducal brothers on 7 June 1617. The eldest son, Johann Friedrich, assumed barony over the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg while the second youngest son, Frederick Achilles, was bequeathed Neuenstadt Castle and an annual endowment of 10,000 guilder.  Children  Johann Frederick, Ludwig Frederick, Julius Frederick, Frederick Achilles and Magnus (top left downwards), and 5 daughters: Sibylla Elisabeth, Eva Christina, Agnes, Barbara and Anna (top right downwards) Frederick and his spouse Sibylla of Anhalt (1564‚Äì1614), daughter of Joachim Ernst, Prince of Anhalt, had the following children: * Johann Frederick (1582‚Äì1628) * George Frederick (1583‚Äì1591) * Sibylla Elisabeth (1584‚Äì1606) - married John George I, Elector of Saxony * Elisabeth (born and died in 1585) * Louis Frederick (1586‚Äì1631), founder of the later branch line of W√ºrttemberg-M√∂mpelgard * Joachim Frederick (born and died in 1587) * Julius Frederick (1588‚Äì1635), founder of the branch line of W√ºrttemberg-Weiltingen, also known as the Julian Line * Philip Frederick (born and died in 1589) * Eva Christina (1590‚Äì1657) - married John George of Brandenburg (1577‚Äì1624), Duke of J√§gerndorf, son of Joachim Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg * Frederick Achilles (1591‚Äì1631) * Agnes (1592‚Äì1629) - married Francis Julius of Saxe-Lauenburg (1584‚Äì1634) * Barbara (1593‚Äì1627) - married Margrave Frederick V of Baden-Durlach * Magnus (de) (1594‚Äì1622), fell in the Battle of Wimpfen * August (born and died in 1596) * Anna (1597‚Äì1650)  Ancestors References * Paul Friedrich von St√§lin: \\"Friedrich I., Herzog von W√ºrttemberg\\".

Victoria & Albert Museum, London. Nathaniel Hone (24 April 1718 - 14 August 1784) was an Irish-born portrait and miniature painter, and one of the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768. Early life The son of a Dublin-based Dutch merchant, Hone moved to England as a young man and, after marrying Molly Earle - daughter of the Duke of Argyll - in 1742, eventually settled in London, by which time he had acquired a reputation as a portrait-painter. While his paintings were popular, his reputation was particularly enhanced by his skill at producing miniatures and enamels. He interrupted his time in London by spending two years (1750‚Äì52) studying in Italy. Works As a portrait painter, several of his works are now held at the National Portrait Gallery in London. His sitters included magistrate Sir John Fielding and Methodist preacher John Wesley, and General Richard Wilford and Sir Levett Hanson in a double portrait.Thomas Gainsborough and Picture Framing, Jacob Simon, The National Portrait Gallery, npg.org.uk He often used his son John Camillus Hone (1745-1836) in some of his works, including his unique portrait of \\"The Spartan Boy,\\" painted in 1774. =The Conjuror= He courted controversy in 1775 when his satirical picture The Conjurer (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin) was seen to attack the fashion for Italian Renaissance art and to ridicule Sir Joshua Reynolds, leading the Royal Academy to reject the painting. It also originally included a nude caricature of fellow Academician Angelica Kauffman in the top left corner, which was painted out by Hone after Kauffman complained to the academy. The combination of a little girl and an old man has also been seen as symbolic of Kauffman and Reynolds's closeness, age difference, and rumoured affair.Rosenthal, Angela. (2006) Angelica Kauffman: Art and sensibility. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006. pp. 226-7.

He loved soccer and to his day he is a big fan of Atlante F.C. (Mexican soccer team for which he played for in the reserves.) Career His first program was in radio in Telehit, then his first program in television was El Calabozo Later he moved to Miami to be a writer for Univision. He returned to Mexico. He worked for a while in Trapitos al Sol. He moved again to Miami for four years. He worked in Cotorreando and in the second of July in 2007 he appeared in Matutino Express for the first time. His show is about making fun of news. He is every week 1st or 2nd in the morning ratings. His program is from 7 to 10 A.M. on Canal Cuatro (channel 4). In a few months his show will appear on Galavision in the U.S. He has 3 children named Esteban who is 14 years old, Maria Jos√© who is 5 years old, and Marene who is 9 years old. He is married with Nieves Sanisteban. Arce was the third addition to the Telemundo tabloid show, after his program Calabozo, Cotorreando. He is known for his jokes, and his apparently amicable, on camera feud with co-host Mauricio Zeilic (the show has four co-hosts). Arce has been reprimanded on camera a few times by show producers for some comments that he has made. Public opinion about him is split: Although many see him as a host with good sense of humor, others consider his comments to be disrespectful. Because the majority of the public seems to like his humor. Arce does not discriminate when it comes to joking about entertainers: Some of his favorite targets seem to include Mexican superstars such as Mar√≠a F√©lix, Luis Miguel and Irma Serrano, but he has also made jokes about Julio Sabala, Madonna, Michael Jackson and Marc Anthony, among others. Arce worked as an interviewer during Telemundo's airing of the 2004 Premios Billboard Latinos, where he interviewed, among others, David Bisbal and Ricky Martin. He told Martin in Spanish that The only way I can get women is by hanging out with you!. In January 2007 he signed a contract with Televisa and his new program Matutino Express is one of the most successful shows in the country. It is a show with news comedy and Esteban's ongoing humor that mixes up topics and makes fun of his co-workers. Arce also appeared as himself in the episode \\"La Casa del Mill√≥n\\" of the comedy series, Una familia de diez. He now works in Mexico in Matutino Express. Controversy over homosexuality views and homophobic comments After a video of the December 18, 2009 \\"Matutino Express\\" was posted online and virally distributed in January 2010, controversy spread about the Arce's question and comments around sexual orientations vs sexual behavior, during the program Arce asked whether homosexual orientation was \\"normal\\" to the program's recurrent (sexologist Elsy Reyes) quite repeatedly since the sexologist failed to provide a straight answer to whether it was or not; during the exchange Elsy said that among some mammals homosexuality was a known behavior to which Arce replied that indeed the behavior exists although is considered \\"animal dementia\\". The most active media of discussion was Twitter, where a trend topic #Estebanarcefueradelaire (Spanish for \\"[take] Esteban Arce off air\\") was started and got full of petitions directed to Emilio Azc√°rraga Jean, president of Televisa, to replace Arce as host of Matutino Express.Twitter arremete contra Esteban Arce, El Universal, January 5, 2010.

Design and construction The Battle-class was developed as a result of operational experience in the early years of the Second World War, which had shown that the Royal Navy's existing destroyers had inadequate anti-aircraft protection, and in particular, lacked a modern dual-purpose main gun armament, capable of dealing with both surface targets and air attack, with guns lacking the high elevation mountings necessary to deal with dive bombers. The resulting design was armed with two twin 4.5 inch high-angle gun-turrets of a new design mounted forward and a heavy close-in anti-aircraft armament, with 16 Battle-class destroyers ordered under the 1942 construction programme. For the 1943 construction programme, 24 Battle-class destroyers of a revised design (known as \\"1943 Battles\\") were ordered, with four destroyers (Barrosa, , Talavera and Trincomalee to be built by the Scottish shipbuilder John Brown & Company. Barrosa was long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of normal and at full load. Displacement was standard and full load. Two Admiralty 3-drum boilers supplied steam at and to two sets of Parsons single-reduction geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of ( at full load. of fuel oil was carried, giving an endurance of at . Two twin 4.5 inch (113 mm) Mark IV gun mounts, capable of elevating to 85 degrees, were mounted forward, while a single 4.5 inch gun, elevating to 55 degrees was fitted behind the funnel - this fifth gun , which could fire astern, replaced a 4-inch gun fitted to the 1942 Battles used for firing Star shell and could be controlled by the main fire control system. Close-in anti-aircraft armament was eight Bofors 40 mm gun, with two twin stabilised STAAG mounts, with integrated fire control, aft, one simple Mark V twin mount amidships, and two single mounts on the bridge wings. Two quintuple 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo- tubes were fitted, with a Squid anti-submarine mortar aft. Barrosa, named after the Battle of Barrosa, which took place in 1811 between British-Allied forces and France, and which ended in a French defeat. was one of six 1943 Battles ordered on 10 March 1943. The destroyer was laid down by John Brown at their Clydebank shipyard as Yard number 615 on 28 December 1943, launched on 17 January 1945 and completed on 14 February 1947. Operations On commissioning, Barrosa joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, but later in the year, a manpower shortage caused most of the Flotilla, including Barrosa to be laid up in reserve. Barrosa returned to active duties with the 4th Flotilla in 1948. On 12 November 1949, Barrosa collided with the oiler , damaging some of the destroyer's portholes and causing a small split in her hull. In April 1950, Barrosa was placed in Reserve, as part of a wider transfer of destroyers to reserve with Loch-class frigates being returned to active service to improve the Royal Navy's anti-submarine capability. On 2 May 1952, Barrosa recommissioned into the 4th Destroyer Squadron, manned by the crew of , which went into reserve on the same day. In June 1953, Barrosa took part in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead in honour of the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II. Barrosa was positioned in the middle of her sister ships and .Souvenir Programme, Coronation Review of the Fleet, Spithead, 15th June 1953, HMSO, Gale and Polden Barrosa spent much of her time in the Mediterranean, duties including anti-arms smuggling patrols off Cyprus. In November 1956 Barrosa formed part of the Royal Navy force deployed in the eastern Mediterranean during the Suez Crisis, as part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron. Refit and conversion to radar picket On 15 March 1959, Barrosa collided with her sister ship in the Bay of Biscay. Later that year, Barrosa entered an extensive programme of modification to become a radar picket, with the addition of the Sea Cat missile, as well as new anti-aircraft weaponry and new radar. In 1963 Barrosa joined the 8th Destroyer Squadron, based in the Far East, before joining the 24th Escort Squadron. As well as radar picket duties, tasks included operations against pirates, and on 10 February 1963, Barrosa intercepted a pirate boat, with a gun battle occurring between Barrosa s search party and the pirates, with one of the destroyer's crew killed. The ship also carried out anti-infiltration patrols during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. In March 1967, at the start of her final commission, Barrosa was used in attempts to break up the oil spill from the supertanker Torrey Canyon, which had run aground off Cornwall, with detergent. In November 1967, she formed part of a naval task force deployed to cover the British Withdrawal from Aden. Other duties during this last commission included taking part in the Beira Patrol. On 2 October 1968, Barrosa took the Royal Fleet Auxiliary stores ship Lyness in tow after Lyness engine had broken down east of Shetland, stopping the supply ship from being driven onto rocks until power could be restored. In December 1968 Barrosa was decommissioned and was listed for disposal in 1972. By 1974 Barrosa was being used as a storage hulk at Portsmouth. She arrived at Blyth in Northumberland for scrapping on 1 December 1978.

Three years later, the burned buildings were reconstructed with money collected from donations.Nussbaum, \\"Heian jing≈´\\" in Architecture The architecture design was a reproduction of the Ch≈çd≈çin (Emperor's palace in the former eras) in 5/8th scale (in length). The large red entrance gate is a reproduction of the Outenmon of the Ch≈çd≈çin. The architecture of the main palace mirrors the style and features of the Kyoto Imperial Palace,Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Heian jing≈´\\" in the style from the 11th‚Äì12th century (late Heian Period). The Shrine's torii is one of the largest in Japan. Garden The Japanese-style garden takes up about half the land area (approximately 33060 m2). Renowned gardener Ogawa Jihei VII, also known as Ueji, created the garden over a 20-year period. The water used in the ponds comes from the Lake Biwa Canal. Species otherwise rare in Japan such as Acheilognathus cyanostigma, the Yellow pond turtle and the Japanese pond turtle live around the ponds. Visitors may feed the fish and turtles with food sold around the ponds. Festivals Annual festivals celebrate the memory of Emperor K≈çmei (late January) and Emperor Kanmu (early April). On October 22, Heian-jing≈´ hosts the Jidai Matsuri, which is one of the most important festivals of Kyoto. The procession of this festival begins at the old Imperial palace, and includes carrying the mikoshi (portable shrines) of Emperors Kanmu and K≈çmei to the Heian-jing≈´. The Shrine is also used for traditional Japanese weddings as well as concerts. It is rare for a modern concert to be held at a historic site like the shrine, but merging modern and old culture in Kyoto has become a trend. Around the Shrine Adjacent to the Shrine is Okazaki Park, where visitors can learn about culture. The Shrine is surrounded by the Kyoto Prefectural Library, Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art, the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto, Kyoto Kaikan, and the Kyoto City Zoo.

The current cabinet of the Netherlands is the Third Rutte cabinet, which has been in power since 26 October 2017. It is headed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his deputies Hugo de Jonge, Kajsa Ollongren and Carola Schouten. Composition and role The Hague's Binnenhof. The Ministry of General Affairs, where the Council of Ministers meets every Friday, is in the centre. The cabinet consists of the ministers and state secretaries. The cabinet is led by the Prime Minister. There are between twelve and sixteen Ministers, most of whom are also heads of specific government ministries, although there are often some ministers without portfolio who have areas of responsibility inside one or more ministries. For instance there has for some time been a minister for development cooperation, who works within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most ministries also have a state secretary who is responsible for part of the relevant portfolio. State secretaries (such as that of Trade and Development Cooperation) are given the right to call themselves \\"Minister\\" in other countries and be treated as such for protocolary purposes, while not having any of the domestic rights given specifically to Ministers. Most significantly, state secretaries are not members of the Council of Ministers. The policy of a cabinet is coordinated by the Council of Ministers, in which all ministers, including ministers without portfolio, take part. The Council initiates laws and policy. State secretaries do not attend the Council of Ministers unless invited, and even then they have no voting rights in the Council. The Council meets every Friday in the Tr√™veszaal (the Room of Treaties) in the Binnenhof. Meetings are chaired by the Prime Minister, or an acting Prime Minister if necessary. The Council makes decisions in a collegial manner; all ministers, including the Prime Minister, are (theoretically) equal. Behind the closed doors of the Tr√™veszaal, ministers can freely debate proposed decisions and express their opinion on any aspect of cabinet policy. Once a decision is made by the Council, all individual members are bound by it and are obliged to support it publicly. A member of Cabinet who is not prepared to publicly support a decision of the Council is obliged to step down. Typically, a good deal of effort is put into reaching relative consensus on any decision. A process of voting within the Council does exist, but is hardly ever used. Together with the King, the Council of Ministers forms the Government, which makes all the major decisions. In practice, the King does not participate in the daily decision-making of government, although he is kept up to date by weekly meetings with the Prime Minister. The Dutch constitution does not speak of cabinet, but instead only of the Council of Ministers and Government. The ministers, individually and collectively (as cabinet), are responsible to the States-General for government policy and must enjoy its confidence. It is not possible for a minister to be a member of parliament. Ministers or state secretaries who are no longer supported by a parliamentary majority are also expected by convention to step down. In contrast to the Westminster system, Dutch ministers may not simultaneously also be members of the States-General, although members of the States-General can be appointed as ministers, whereupon their seats become vacant. An important question is whether the relationship between the cabinet and parliament should be dualistic or monistic. That is, whether ministers and leaders of governing parliamentary parties should prepare important political decisions. According to the dualistic position, members of parliament of governing parties should function independently of the Cabinet. The monistic position, by contrast, is that the Cabinet plays an important role in proposing legislation and policy. Formation After a general election held generally every four years, or if a cabinet resigns during a parliamentary term, the process of cabinet formation starts. Because of the multi-party system of the Netherlands, no single party has had a majority in parliament since 1900, and formation of a coalition of two or often three parties is always necessary. This is a time- consuming process. The entire procedure is regulated by tradition and convention, with only the final appointment process specified by law. Initially, the Dutch Monarch has secret individual meetings with the presidents of the Senate and House of Representatives, and the Vice-President of the Council of State. Next the Monarch has a meeting with the leader of each parliamentary party in the House of Representatives. This is followed by appointing an informateur who explores the options of a new cabinet. The informateur is often a relative outsider and a veteran politician, who has retired from active politics, perhaps a member of the Senate or Raad van State, though by convention he or she has a background in the largest party in the House of Representatives. The Monarch may appoint multiple informateurs, with backgrounds in other parties. The informateur is given a specific task by the King or Queen regnant, often to \\"seek a coalition of parties with programmatic agreement and a majority in parliament.\\" The informateur has one- on-one meetings with the leaders of the parliamentary parties, and chairs sessions of negotiations between the chairs of parliamentary parties as they compromise in order to achieve agreement. If negotiations break down, a new informateur is appointed and the information process begins afresh. Once an informateur is successful, the Monarch appoints the formateur, conventionally the leader of the largest party in the prospective coalition and the likely Prime Minister. He or she leads any remaining negotiations between those parties willing to cooperate to form a cabinet. Often, these negotiations cover the details of the program of policies, the composition of the Cabinet, and the division of Ministerial portfolios. If the formateur is successful, the Monarch appoints all ministers and state secretaries individually by Royal Decision (Koninklijk Besluit). Each Minister privately swears an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. After this the entire Council of Ministers and the King or Queen regnant are photographed on the stairs of the palace Huis ten Bosch during the bordes scene. The new cabinet then proposes its plans to parliament. Between the dissolution of the States-General before general elections and the appointment of a new Cabinet, the incumbent Cabinet is termed demissionair, that is, a caretaker government limiting itself to urgent and pressing matters and traditionally not taking any controversial decisions. If a Cabinet falls during a parliamentary term because one of the coalition partners withdraws its support, the coalition partner in question may leave. This does not result in a demissionair Cabinet, unless the Prime Minister is granted a dissolution of the States-General. Instead, the remaining parties in the governing coalition form a rompkabinet (\\"rump cabinet\\"). If the parties do not between them control a majority of the House of Representatives, the Cabinet continues as a minority government. The formation is often considered as important as or even more important than the elections themselves. Because of the importance of negotiations, which can lead to policies that no party has promoted during the election, cabinet formations are sometimes seen as undemocratic. Recently it was attempted to make the process more democratic, with the formateur and informateur accounting for their actions before both the House of Representatives and the Dutch Monarch. Another source of discontent with this process is the role of the monarch in it. Incumbent CabinetMinistries There are now twelve ministries, all with their own Minister, there are also several Ministers without portfolio and in some ministries there is a State Secretary next to the Minister. The number of Ministers and State Secretaries and the division of their tasks may vary somewhat from one cabinet to another. The ministries are: History The first real cabinet was formed in 1848 after a constitution was adopted which limited the power of the King and introduced the principle of ministerial responsibility to parliament. Until 1888 cabinets lacked a real coordinating role, and instead ministers were focused on their own department. After 1888 cabinets became more political. Of the thirty coalition governments since World War II, only three excluded the largest party (all three times PvdA) and the largest number of parties in a coalition was 5 (in 1971 and 1973). After that, the three major Christian-democratic parties merged into CDA, and 2- or 3-party coalitions became standard. Since 1945 there have been thirty cabinets, which were headed by 15 Prime Ministers. Willem Drees and Jan Peter Balkenende both chaired the most cabinets (four) and Ruud Lubbers served as Prime Minister the longest (between 1982 and 1994). The second Rutte cabinet was the longest lasting cabinet since World War II (1,816 days); only the cabinet led by Theo Heemskerk sat longer (2025 days). The first Balkenende cabinet is the shortest lasting normal cabinet since World War II (87 days); only the fifth cabinet of Hendrikus Colijn lasted shorter (10 days). Council of Ministers of the Kingdom The Cabinet of the Netherlands also takes responsibility for day-to-day affairs in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is distinct from the Netherlands, as it also includes the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. If affairs are decided which are of vital importance of the Kingdom as a whole, the Council of Ministers of the Netherlands is joined by one Minister Plenipotentiary for Aruba and one for the other Antilles to form the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom. * Living former members of the Council of Ministers of the Netherlands Types There are different types of cabinets: * A demissionary cabinet (demissionair kabinet) is a caretaker government during the election campaign and the formation of a new cabinet. * An extra- parliamentary cabinet (extraparlementair kabinet) not based on a parliamentary majority. The last extra-parliamentary cabinet was the Den Uyl cabinet. It consisted of members of the three progressive parties (the social democratic PvdA, the social liberal D66, and the progressive Christian PPR) and progressive members from the Christian democratic ARP and KVP. It is contrasted with a parliamentary cabinet, which does have an explicit majority in parliament. * A rump cabinet (rompkabinet) is the continuation of a Dutch cabinet when it has lost a coalition partner, typically a form of minority government, where the cabinet has not become demissionary, but seeks support from a majority of parliament to finish the work that was already introduced by the cabinet to the parliament. Normally the Dutch Monarch will call for dissolution of parliament somewhat later, since the basis behind the coalition agreement is gone. * A broad basis cabinet (brede basiskabinet) is an oversized coalition or national cabinet. Between 1945 and 1959, several cabinets have included more parties than were necessary for a parliamentary majority. The first one of which was the Schermerhorn cabinet. Other parties were included to give the cabinet and its far-reaching proposals, like the formation of a welfare state, a broad basis in parliament and society. The core of these cabinets were formed by the social democratic PvdA and the catholic KVP, the Roman/Red alliance which by themselves had a large majority in parliament.

The first game in the Star Fox series, Star Fox follows Fox McCloud and the rest of the Star Fox team defending their homeworld of Corneria against the attacking forces of Andross. It ultimately sold over 4 million copies. Star Fox was Nintendo's second 3D game after the release of X for the Game Boy in 1992. However, it was Nintendo's first game to use polygonal graphics. It accomplished this by being the first ever game to use the Super FX graphics acceleration coprocessor powered GSU-1. The complex display of three-dimensional models with polygons was still new and uncommon in console video games, and the game was praised as a result. The series was rebooted with Star Fox 64 on the Nintendo 64 in 1997, which itself was later remade as Star Fox 64 3D on the Nintendo 3DS in 2011, and years later reimagined as Star Fox Zero on the Wii U in 2016. Nintendo re-released Star Fox worldwide in September 2017 as part of the Super NES Classic Edition, along with its previously unreleased sequel Star Fox 2. In September 2019, Star Fox was made available on the Nintendo Switch exclusively for subscribers of the Nintendo Switch Online service, along with 19 other SNES games. Gameplay 3D perspective. Gameplay is centred around aerial combat. Star Fox is a rail shooter in a third-person and first-person 3D perspective. The player must navigate Fox's spacecraft, an Arwing, through environments while various enemies (spaceships, robots, creatures, etc.) attack them. Along the way, various power-ups are placed in the stage to help the player. The player receives a score at the end of each level based on how many enemies have been destroyed and how well the player has defended their teammates. At the end of each level there is a boss that the player must defeat before progressing to the next level. Control of the Arwing includes thrusters and retro-rockets on the Arwing allowing the player to temporarily speed up or slow down. These can be used to manoeuvre around enemy attacks and other obstacles. Damage is incurred incrementally via loss of shield energy before the destruction of the craft. The game also has a small degree of locational damage detection: if the ship's wings clip against obstacles or the ground too much, they will break off, adversely affecting the craft's handling and removing the ability to upgrade weapons. Reproduction of the game's heads-up display. From left to right clockwise, the interface displays the player's number of lives, ammunition, boost meter, and shield strength. The difficulty in Star Fox is also set in a unique way. Most scrolling shooters, if they have selectable difficulty levels, allow the player to set the difficulty by choosing an option (e.g. \\"Easy,\\" \\"Normal,\\" and \\"Hard\\") at the beginning of the game. This option usually affects variables such as the number of lives a player has, the number of enemies encountered in the game, the speed of enemies, and so on. In contrast, at the beginning of Star Fox, the player is given a choice of one of three routes to take through the Lylat system. Each of these routes corresponds with a certain level of difficulty, but each route has its own series of unique levels. This gives Star Fox somewhat more replay value than other scrolling shooters that have a fixed series of levels each time the game is played. The three game paths all contain the planet Corneria (the first level) and Venom (the last level), but they each have different versions depending on the path taken. In each level, the player is accompanied by three computer-controlled wingmen: Peppy Hare, Slippy Toad and Falco Lombardi. At certain pre-scripted points, one will fly into the player's view, often either chasing an enemy or being chased and asking for assistance. Ignoring a wingman's pleas will result in him taking damage, or even being shot down. They cannot be damaged by the player's own lasers (although they will complain if hit). Regardless of their survival, wingmen are not present during boss battles but rejoin the player before the next stage. A player may choose to help their wingmen when they ask for assistance, as doing so will allow them to engage some of the enemies not destroyed by the player, helping the player to succeed and additionally making it easier to achieve maximum score in a given level. Additional points are also granted at the end of each level depending on the health of each wingman. If a wingman gets shot down, he will not return for the rest of the game. Plot This game takes place in a fictional solar system called the Lylat system, which is inhabited by anthropomorphic species such as foxes, frogs, birds, rabbits and apes. It contains the planets Corneria and Venom, representing good and evil, respectively. Andross, an evil scientist, fled to the planet Venom after being banished from Corneria, and declared war on the latter, unleashing an enormous army to wreak havoc on the Lylat System. General Pepper, the commanding officer of Corneria's defence force, dispatches a prototypical high-performance fighter aircraft called the \\"Arwing\\". However, lacking in time to train pilots for the new fighters, he summons the elite mercenary team Star Fox to defeat Andross. Fox McCloud, the leader of the team, is accompanied by his teammates, Falco Lombardi, Peppy Hare and Slippy Toad. Development Nintendo worked closely with Argonaut during the early years of the NES and SNES. They developed a prototype on the NES, initially codenamed \\"NESGlider\\", which was inspired by their earlier 8-bit game Starglider, and ported this prototype to the SNES. Programmer Jez San told Nintendo that this was as good as it could get unless they were allowed to design custom hardware to make the SNES better at processing 3D. Nintendo assented to this, and San hired chip designers to make the Super FX chip, the first 3D graphics accelerator in a consumer product. The Super FX was so much more powerful than the SNES's standard processor that the development team joked that the SNES was just a box to hold the chip. Argonaut did much of the base programming for the game's engine, while the character designs and artwork were mainly done in-house by Nintendo. The main game design was done by Shigeru Miyamoto and Katsuya Eguchi. Characters were designed by Takaya Imamura, and music was composed by Hajime Hirasawa. Nintendo suggested the \\"arcade-style shooting\\" element of the game and Argonaut brought the idea of using spaceships. Miyamoto frequently visited the Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine, about a fifteen-minute walk from the Nintendo corporate headquarters, and the Senbon Torii gates there inspired the idea of gates that the player would need to pilot the ship through. Miyamoto stated that he wanted the Star Fox series to star animal characters since he was not interested in making a series with conventional science fiction stories with humans, robots, monsters, and superheroes. He decided to use a fox as a main character since it reminded him of Fushimi Inari-taisha. Miyamoto explained that he had always planned to use the English word \\"fox\\" instead of the Japanese word . Imamura used Japanese folklore as an inspiration to add a bird and a hare as two other protagonists. He also added a toad; the inspiration came from a staff member of Nintendo EAD who used a toad as his personal mascot. Imamura populated the Cornerian army with dogs and the enemy army with monkeys, and made Pepper a dog and Andross a monkey, since there is a Japanese expression about fighting like dogs and monkeys. Miyamoto created several puppets and photographed them to use as artwork for the cover of the Star Fox game; Miyamoto was a fan of English puppet dramas, such as Thunderbirds, so he wanted the game cover to feature puppets.\\"Fushimi Inari Taisha and Fox.\\" Nintendo. Retrieved on 17 August 2011. The game was released under the title Starwing in Europe due to the similarity of the title Star Fox to the name of the German company StarVox. In the Netflix documentary High Score, Dylan Cuthbert and Giles Gooddard discussed how when they moved to Kyoto to work in the Nintendo office, they were put in a room remotely located from the rest of Nintendo because due to the two of them not being full-time Nintendo employees, Nintendo didn't want them to have access to confidential and secret projects they were working on at the time. They also discussed how Miyamoto would come visit them frequently, providing advice and feedback in between puffs of a cigarette, as Miyamoto was a notorious chain smoker at the time. On the weekend of April 30 to May 2, 1993, the \\"Super Star Fox Weekend Competition\\" took place at approximately 2,000 retail locations within the United States. Competitors received a limited edition Star Fox pin, and those who accumulated a particularly high score received Star Fox t-shirts as prizes. The competitors who achieved the highest score at their respective locations were entered into a randomized grand prize drawing for a choice between an all-expenses-paid trip for four to a choice of London, Paris, Sydney or Tokyo, or a lump sum of $15,000. The grand prize was won by Trevor Petersma of Garland, Texas, who opted for the cash prize. In the United Kingdom, the competition was known as the Star Wing Challenge and was held in gaming shops across the country on 29 May 1993. Nintendo Netherlands held the Starwing competition at various game-selling stores in early 1993; the winner of each day won a large Starwing poster. Annual Starwing competitions were held during the Dutch Nintendo Championships, held in October, from 1993 to 1996. After the original competition, a limited number of the game cartridges created and used for the competition were sold through the Nintendo Power magazine, listed in the Spring 1994 \\"Super Power Supplies\\" catalogue that was mailed to subscribers, with an original list price of $45. The cartridges feature a time-limited single-player mode on modified stages, as well as an exclusive bonus level. The altered start-up screen displays \\"Official Competition Cartridge\\". Reception Star Fox received generally positive reviews and was a commercial success on its release. It holds an aggregate score of 88% at GameRankings, based on an average of seven reviews. Nintendo sold over four million copies of the game worldwide by 1998. Star Fox was awarded Best Shooter of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly. The game took the No. 115 spot on EGMs \\"The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time\\", and 82nd best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list. It also received a 34 out of 40 from Famitsu magazine, and a 4.125 out of 5 from Nintendo Power Magazine. Next Gen Magazine pointed out Star Fox as helping pioneer the use of 3D video game graphics. The game has been used as an example of how, even with a fully polygon design, the game was still very similar to older games in that there was a set path to travel through each level. Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A and wrote that \\"The first game to incorporate Nintendo's 'Super FX' computer chip, this pseudo-3D space shooter moves so fast that it practically qualifies as virtual reality. Unlike most games of this genre, though, Star Fox (Nintendo of America, for Super NES) shows some heart behind the hardware ‚Äî rarely have such powerful spacecrafts been piloted by so adorable an array of frogs, birds, and bunnies.\\" Legacy Star Fox has become a Nintendo franchise, with six more games and numerous appearances by its characters in other Nintendo games such as the Super Smash Bros. series. A sequel titled Star Fox 2 was developed but never released for the SNES, although programmer Dylan Cuthbert says that the game was actually completely finished. Although Star Fox 2 was never released, some of the ideas and gameplay were salvaged for 1997's Star Fox 64 (released in Europe under the title Lylat Wars) for the Nintendo 64. Eventually, a handful of ROM dumps of Star Fox 2 at various stages of its development were leaked onto the internet, and a fan-made translation of Star Fox 2 from Japanese to English was released in the form of a patch that could be applied to one of the ROM dumps. A finalised version of the game, obtained from a complete ROM located in Nintendo archives, was released on the Super NES Classic Edition on 29 September 2017. In 2002, Rare's Star Fox Adventures was released for Nintendo GameCube. Adventures was the first Star Fox game to incorporate an action role-playing element, where the player acts as Fox McCloud on the world of Sauria, also known as Dinosaur Planet. In 2005, Star Fox: Assault was released for the GameCube, this time developed by Namco. It incorporates a third-person shooter aspect into the game. Star Fox Command, released for the Nintendo DS in 2006, is the first game of the series on a portable system, and the first featuring online gaming. It uses many features from the unreleased Star Fox 2. During the game's release, Nintendo teamed up with Kellogg's and Nelsonic to develop and release a promotional Star Fox LCD game watch to those who bought a box of corn flakes and sent the order form to Kellogg's to receive the Star Fox game watch for free. In the game watch, there are four levels and the object is to fly towards an attack carrier and destroy it while dodging plasma balls and falling structures. The game watch also includes a pair of earphones and a headphone jack due to the game watch missing a volume control. Nelsonic later released it in stores in a different watch appearance.

It is one of the constructions that represents the Higashiyama Culture of the Muromachi period.  History  Ashikaga Yoshimasa initiated plans for creating a retirement villa and gardens as early as 1460; Yamasa: Gikaku-ji. and after his death, Yoshimasa would arrange for this property to become a Zen temple. \\"Protecting Ginkaku-ji, the Beauty of Wabi-sabi; Reluctance to Black Lacquering the Outer Wall,\\" Kyoto Shimbun. January 23, 2008. The temple is today associated with the Shokoku-ji branch of Rinzai Zen. The two-storied , is the main temple structure. Its construction began February 21, 1482 (Bummei 14 , 4th day of the 2nd month).Keene, Donald. (2003). Yoshimasa and the Silver Pavilion, p. 87. The structure's design sought to emulate the golden Kinkaku- ji which had been commissioned by his grandfather Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. It is popularly known as Ginkaku, the \\"Silver Pavilion\\" because of the initial plans to cover its exterior in silver foil; but this familiar nickname dates back only as far as the Edo period (1600‚Äì1868).Keene, p. 88. During the ≈ånin War, construction was halted. Despite Yoshimasa's intention to cover the structure with a distinctive silver-foil overlay, this work was delayed for so long that the plans were never realized before Yoshimasa's death. The present appearance of the structure is understood to be the same as when Yoshimasa himself last saw it. This \\"unfinished\\" appearance illustrates one of the aspects of \\"wabi- sabi\\" quality. Like Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji was originally built to serve as a place of rest and solitude for the Sh≈çgun. During his reign as Sh≈çgun, Ashikaga Yoshimasa inspired a new outpouring of traditional culture, which came to be known as Higashiyama Bunka (the Culture of the Eastern Mountain). Having retired to the villa, it is said Yoshimasa sat in the pavilion, contemplating the calm and beauty of the gardens as the ≈ånin War worsened and Kyoto was burned to the ground. In 1485, Yoshimasa became a Zen Buddhist monk. After his death on January 27, 1490 (Entoku 2, 7th day of the 1st month),Titsingh, p. 361. the villa and gardens became a Buddhist temple complex, renamed Jish≈ç-ji after Yoshimasa's Buddhist name. After extensive restoration, started February 2008, Ginkaku-ji is again in full glory to visit. The garden and temple complex are open to the public. There is still no silver foil used. After much discussion, it was decided to not refinish the lacquer to the original state . The lacquer finish was the source of the original silver appearance of the temple, with the reflection of silver water of the pond on the lacquer finish.  Garden  In addition to the temple's famous building, the property features wooded grounds covered with a variety of mosses. The Japanese garden, supposedly designed by the great landscape artist S≈çami. In the later periods of Japanese garden history, fine stones were transported from a ruined or impoverished garden to a new one. According to the book Landscape design: A Cultural and Architectural History by Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, \\"In 1474, following his retirement from the shogunate, Yoshimasa (1436-1490), had some of the stones and pine trees of the Flowery Palace and Muromachi Hall, both of which had been devastated by civil warfare, removed to his villa retreat at the base of Higashiyama (the Eastern Hills). There he lived from 1438 until his death, when the villa was converted to the Zen temple, Jisho-ji, or Ginkakuji (the Temple of the Silver Pavilion), as it is better known.\\" The Zen culture is not entirely represented in this garden because it was financed by the shogunate as a retreat and the primary use was aesthetic enjoyment. Instead of being designed by and for the use of monks, practitioners of zazen, or seated meditation. Ginkakuji was constructed in relation to its surroundings. This is described in the Journal of Asian Studies by Ichito Ishida and Delmer M. Brown, \\"The southeast corner of the first floor has openings in the walls, since a pond is located on that corner of the building, beyond which the moon rises between the peaks of Higashiyama.

It is the home field of the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL), and serves as a venue for other events such as college and high school football, soccer, and concerts. It opened in 1999 as Cleveland Browns Stadium and was renovated in two phases in early 2014 and 2015. The initial seating capacity was listed at 73,200 people, but following the first phase of the renovation project in 2014, seating capacity was reduced to 67,431. Since 2017, capacity is listed at 67,895. The stadium sits on of land between Lake Erie and the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway in the North Coast Harbor area of downtown Cleveland, adjacent to the Great Lakes Science Center and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The site was previously the location of Cleveland Stadium from 1931 to 1996. History FirstEnergy Stadium is located on the site of Cleveland Stadium, commonly called Cleveland Municipal Stadium, a multipurpose facility built in 1931 that served as the Browns' home field from their inception in 1946 through the 1995 season. During the 1995 season, owner Art Modell announced his plans to move the team to Baltimore, which resulted in legal action from the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders. The day after the announcement was made, voters in Cuyahoga County approved an extension of the original 1990 sin tax on alcohol and tobacco products to fund renovations to Cleveland Stadium. Eventually, as part of the agreement between Modell, the city of Cleveland, and the NFL, the city agreed to tear down Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site using the sin tax funds. Modell agreed to leave the Browns name, colors, and history in Cleveland and create a new identity for his franchise, eventually becoming the Baltimore Ravens, while the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by 1999 through expansion or relocation of another team. Demolition on the old stadium began in November 1996 and was completed in early 1997. Debris from the former stadium was submerged in Lake Erie and now serves as an artificial reef. Ground was broken for the new stadium on May 15, 1997, and it opened in July 1999. The first event was a preseason game between the Browns and the Minnesota Vikings on August 21, followed the next week by a preseason game against the Chicago Bears. The first regular-season Browns game at the stadium was played the evening of September 12, 1999, a 43‚Äì0 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Since 2011, the stadium has been referred to by some as the \\"Factory of Sadness\\", a name that was first coined that year by comedian and Browns fan Mike Polk. Polk made a video outside the stadium in which he complains about the team's futility. Through the 2019 season, FirstEnergy Stadium is the only NFL venue that has yet to host a postseason game of any kind. The Browns are one of four teams who have yet to host a home playoff game in their respective stadium, along with the Atlanta Falcons, Detroit Lions, and New York Jets. These teams, however, have hosted the Super Bowl at their respective stadiums, while the Jets' home, MetLife Stadium, has also hosted a New York Giants home playoff game. Facility Dawg Pound in 2016 The stadium was designed by Populous, which was known at the time as the Sport Venue Event Division of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum (HOK). Indianapolis-based Huber, Hunt & Nichols was the construction manager. The stadium is a concrete and glass structure, using precast concrete and cast in-place for the upper concourse. Natural stone accents were used at the base of the stadium. The construction of the concrete superstructure took more than 6,000 truckloads of concrete, or the equivalent of , with a weight of approximately . The playing surface is a Kentucky Bluegrass irrigated field, with a sand-soil root zone and an underground heating system that involves nine boilers and of underground piping. The heating system prevents the field from freezing and extends the growing season of the turf. Although it was designed for football, the playing surface was built large enough to accommodate international soccer matches. The eastern seating section is the home of the Dawg Pound, a section of bleacher seats. It was designed as a successor to the original Dawg Pound at Cleveland Stadium, the bleacher section also located in the east end zone. When FirstEnergy Stadium opened in 1999, the Dawg Pound was a 10,644, double-deck area. During stadium renovations in 2014, the upper level of the Dawg Pound was reduced to make way for a new, larger scoreboard, auxiliary scoreboard, and additional fan areas, and the bleacher seating in the upper level was replaced with chairbacks. =Renovations= In 2013, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam announced a modernization project for FirstEnergy Stadium. The project included two phases that took place during the NFL offseasons in 2014 and 2015. Phase one included improving the audio system, installing new scoreboards three times the size of the original scoreboards and at the time the fourth largest in an NFL stadium, as well as adding more seats to the lower bowl. Phase two included concession improvements, upgrades to technology connectivity, graphics throughout the stadium, and enhancing the premium suites. The renovations reduced the stadium's capacity to approximately 68,000. The total cost of the renovations was estimated at $120 million with the city of Cleveland paying $30 million over 15 years and the Browns covering the rest of the cost. =Stadium naming= The city specifically chose not to sell the naming rights to the stadium itself, which is highly unusual for major American stadiums built in recent years. However, it instead sold the naming rights to each of the facility's four main entrance gates. Originally, the gates were named for National City Bank, Steris Corp., CoreComm Inc., and the Cleveland Clinic Sports Health. The arrangement was later discontinued, though has since been partially restored. As of the 2018 season, the southwest gate is not sponsored, while the southeast gate is sponsored by and named for University Hospitals of Cleveland, the northeast gate by Cree Inc., and the northwest gate by Fifth Third Bank. The stadium is sometimes referred to as the \\"Factory of Sadness,\\" due to the Browns' recent period of futility. Randy Lerner sold the Browns to Jimmy Haslam, CEO of truck stop chain Pilot Flying J, in August 2012. Before the deal officially closed in October 2012, Haslam announced he would sell the stadium's naming rights. Haslam effectively ruled out his family business as buying the naming rights, mentioning that he had received offers for the naming rights, and that none of them are based in his home state of Tennessee. On January 14, 2013, it was reported that the naming rights were sold to FirstEnergy Corporation, the Akron-based electric utility serving most of northeastern Ohio. The Browns announced the following day that the stadium would be renamed \\"FirstEnergy Stadium, Home of the Cleveland Browns\\", with the deal getting official Cleveland City Council approval on February 15, 2013. Though naming rights belong to FirstEnergy Corporation through 2029, the stadium itself is actually serviced by Cleveland Public Power. =Services= The stadium does not have public parking facilities. However, there are several adjacent parking facilities: the Port Authority visitors lot, the West 3rd Street parking lot, and the Great Lakes Science Center parking garage. Additionally, the West 3rd Street station of Cleveland's Waterfront light rail line serves the stadium. Other events Lined for soccer in 2016 In addition to home games for the Browns, the stadium hosts other events during the year, including college football, high school football, and international soccer, along with occasional concerts. The Ohio Classic, a college football game, was held there in both 2004 and 2005. In September 2006, it hosted the game between the Bowling Green Falcons and Wisconsin Badgers, which had an announced attendance of 30,307 people. From 2007 through 2009, the stadium hosted an event known as the Patriot Bowl, a season-opening game intended to showcase teams from the Mid-American Conference. The first Patriot Bowl featured the Army Black Knights and Akron Zips and drew 17,835 fans. The following season, Boston College defeated Kent State in the second Patriot Bowl on August 30, 2008 in front of 10,788 people. The third and final Patriot Bowl game was between the Ohio State Buckeyes and Toledo Rockets. While the game was considered a home game for Toledo, the crowd of 71,727 was mostly Ohio State fans. It has hosted numerous high school football games, including playoff games of the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) tournament. In June 2010, the Browns announced that four area powerhouses would play in doubleheader named the High School Football Charity Game. The games were played on August 28, 2010. Most recently it hosted the rivalry game between two of the Cleveland area's largest parochial schools, St. Ignatius High School and St. Edward High School, in October 2016, which had 17,400 fans in attendance. =Soccer= FirstEnergy Stadium is a periodic host for both the United States men's (USMNT) and women's national soccer (USWNT) teams. The stadium hosted a match between the USMNT and Venezuela in the run-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, a 2‚Äì0 victory for the Yanks, and a 2‚Äì4 loss in 2013 against Belgium that drew 27,720 fans. The USWNT has played at the stadium on three occasions, with the most recent being in 2018. It hosted a 4‚Äì0 friendly victory against Germany in 2010 and the second leg of a friendly series with Japan in 2016, a 2‚Äì0 win for the USWNT. The game against Japan had 23,535 fans in attendance, the largest crowd to see the USWNT play in Ohio. The USWNT returned on June 12, 2018, in a game against China, won by the U.S. 2‚Äì1. CONCACAF announced in December 2016 that FirstEnergy Stadium would host games in the group stage of the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup, with the USMNT playing at the stadium July 15, 2017 against Nicaragua as part of a doubleheader that also included Panama and Martinique. Both Panama and the United States won their respective matches by a score of 3‚Äì0. FirstEnergy Stadium again hosted group stage play during the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup, with Panama defeating Guyana 4‚Äì2 and the USMNT winning 6‚Äì0 over Trinidad and Tobago. =Concerts= A limited number of concerts have been held at FirstEnergy Stadium since it opened. The first concert held in the stadium was George Strait in 2000, followed in 2001 by NSYNC, as part of their PopOdyssey Tour, and The Three Tenors. Kenny Chesney has performed at the stadium on three occasions. His Flip-Flop Summer Tour came to Cleveland in 2007, followed by The Poets and Pirates Tour in 2008, and the Brothers of the Sun Tour in 2012. In 2015, the stadium was part of the circuits for One Direction and their On the Road Again Tour as well as Luke Bryan and his Kick the Dust Up Tour. U2 performed at FirstEnergy Stadium July 1, 2017 as part of The Joshua Tree Tour 2017. Tickets for the concert went on sale January 17 and were sold out the following day. Concerts held at the stadium in 2018 included Taylor Swift in Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour on July 17, followed by Beyonc√© and Jay-Z on July 25 as part of their On the Run II Tour.

Considered a form of attribution, the individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.Ciccarelli, S. K. & White, J. N. (2009). Psychology (2nd ed.) New Jersey: Pearson Education. . The diffusion of responsibility refers to the decreased responsibility of action each member of a group feels when she or he is part of a group. For example, in emergency situations, individuals feel less responsibility to respond or call for help if they know that there are others also watching the situation - if they know they are a part of the group of witnesses. In other group settings (in which a group is appointed to complete a task or reach a certain goal), the diffusion of responsibility manifests itself as the decreased responsibility each member feels to contribute and work hard towards accomplishing the task or goal. The diffusion of responsibility is present in almost all groups, but to varying degrees, and can be mitigated by reducing group size, defining clear expectations, and increasing accountability.Lickerman, Alex, \\"The Diffusion of Responsibility\\", Psychology Today, Sussex Publishers, 2010. Assumption of responsibility tends to decrease when the potential helping group is larger, resulting in little aiding behavior demonstrated by the bystander(s). Causes range from psychological effects of anonymity to differences in sex. Implication of behaviours related to diffusion of responsibility can be threatening as there have been increases in moral disengagement and helping behaviour.  Real-world examples  In many real-world examples, it can be difficult to say with complete certainty that certain events happened or happen because of a sociopsychological effect such as diffusion of responsibility, the reason's being that in these events, there are many other contributing factors. Many of these events have also been traumatizing for the individuals who have recounted them. In situations which have known to increase anxiety, events have been found to be interpreted more dangerously or inaccurately than they appear. While accurate representation of events may be questionable, there have been extensive analyses on the following events regarding diffusion of responsibility and applications of its concept. =World War II= The diffusion of responsibility for alleged war crimes during World War II was famously used as a legal defense by many of the Nazis being tried at Nuremberg. A similar defense was mounted by the defendants accused in the My Lai massacre. Because of the displacement of responsibility, they did not feel the personal responsibility to help or at least not harm victims, but they felt like they were just following orders, and they did not feel responsible or guilty for their own actions. They blamed those telling them to carry out the orders rather than blaming themselves for the atrocities they had committed. The diffusion of responsibility is a probable cause for many of their feelings and actions, but other possible contributing factors include the existing antisemitism of Germany at that time and the threats imposed by Nazi officials.Henry, Stuart. Recent Developments in Criminological Theory: Toward Disciplinary Diversity and Theoretical Integration. Routledge, 2017. =Workplace= Diffusion of responsibility can be seen in the workplace through the response to mass email when compared to many, individualized emails. When mass emails are sent out, people feel a lack of accountability due to the fact that the emails have not been addressed to them personally. This is a clear example of diffusion of responsibility. Studies have shown that email responses are more helpful and lengthier when personally addressed because of a greater sense of responsibility than compared to a mass email. Another example of diffusion of responsibility revolves around whistleblowing in the work place. Many people employed by companies that regularly committed accounting fraud do not blow the whistle. While this may seem contrary, this is again to due concepts of lack of accountability and moral disengagement. As mentioned earlier, it has been shown that many people often get so focused on their individual tasks, they forget to think about moral responsibilities in an organization. Thus whistleblowing may not even be considered. Moreover, in companies where it is promoted, people still do not participate since they assume others will take the responsibility, causing a feelings of similar to a lack of accountability.Thompson, Leigh (2011). Making the team. Chapter 2 Performance and Productivity: Team Performance Criteria and Threats to Productivity =Self-driving cars= Autonomous cars require a human driver to be attentive at all times, and intervene if necessary. One safety concern is that humans are less likely to maintain attention if the automated system has partial responsibility for driving.Analysis  The Tesla crash has highlighted a problem: When cars are partly self-driving, humans don‚Äôt feel responsible.  Causes  Diffusion of responsibility occurs in large group settings and under both prosocial and antisocial conditions. In prosocial situations, individuals' willingness to intervene or assist someone in need is inhibited by the presence of other people. The individual is under the belief that other people present will or should intervene. Thus, the individual does not perceive it as her or his responsibility to take action. This will not happen if the individual believes that they are the only one aware of the situation. If a bystander is deciding how to help, they may abstain from doing so if they believe that they lack the competence to be of aid. Individuals may become reluctant to provide help for fear of how observers will view them. =Anonymity= In addition, diffusion of responsibility is more likely to occur under conditions of anonymity. In prosocial situations, individuals are less likely to intervene when they do not know the victim personally. Instead, they believe that someone who has a relationship with the victim will assist. In antisocial situations, negative behaviours are more likely to be carried out when the person is in a group of similarly motivated individuals. The behaviour is driven by the deindividuating effects of group membership and the diffusion of feelings of personal responsibility for the consequences. As part of this process, individuals become less self-aware and feel an increased sense of anonymity. As a result, they are less likely to feel responsible for any antisocial behaviour performed by their group. Diffusion of responsibility is also a causal factor governing much crowd behaviour, as well as risk-taking in groups.Le Bon, G. (1995, 1895). The crowd: a study of the popular mind. London: Transaction. . Contrary to anonymity, it has been shown that if one can utilise technology to prevent anonymity, it can further prevent diffusion of responsibility. Studies have shown that if emails are sent directly to individuals as opposed to addressing individuals in mass emails, they can prevent diffusion of responsibility and elicit more responses. In addition to eliciting more responses, the responses that were received from individuals, as opposed to groups, were much longer and helpful to the initial questions asked. =Division of labor= Diffusion of responsibility can manifest itself in the workplace when tasks are assigned to individuals in terms of division of labor. In an economics context, diffusion of responsibility can be observed in groups when a leader assigns tasks to individuals. To promote the concept of fairness, the leader will generally assign an equal amount of work to individuals within the group. This is in part due to the idea that people in general want to seem fair and kind. According to Albert Bandura, diffusion of responsibility can occur when managers create subtasks in an organization. When people are subdivided into individual tasks they can often forget their role to the organization as a whole and get narrow minded into focusing on their own role. Individuals may unknowingly diffuse their responsibility to an organization by only doing what is required of them in their respective tasks. This is due to the fact that their focus for accountability is diverted from the organization to their individualized tasks. =Expertise= In organisations, diffusion of responsibility can be observed on the basis of roles and differing levels of expertise. For instance, in a hierarchical structure, where your position in the organisation is associated with your level of engagement to the group, people tend to diffuse accountability to those with greater responsibility and a higher level in the structure. Evidence from numerous research studies suggests \\"followers\\" have not taken responsibility because they feel they have a lower status in the organisation. Many individuals in a group assume those with a greater level of power are held accountable for more and assume they take on a greater level of responsibility. The association of level of expertise or role and the amount of work required can cause people to feel varying levels of responsibility and accountability for their own contributions. =Group size= Because of the diffusion of responsibility, people feel that their need to intervene in a situation decreases as the number of other (perceived) witnesses increases. In an experiment that John Darley and Bibb Latan√© conducted in 1968, it was found that a subject was much less likely to help someone having a seizure when the subject thought that at least one other subject was also hearing the individual have a seizure. The subject's likeliness to help decreased with the number of other subjects (up to four) he or she thought were also listening to the seizure. Group size is a key factor to the diffusion of responsibility, as in a different study, it was additionally found that the probability of an individual volunteering to be a primary helper or leader also decreases as the size of the group grows Greg Barron, Eldad Yechiam, Private e-mail requests and the diffusion of responsibility, In Computers in Human Behavior, Volume 18, Issue 5, 2002, Pages 507-520. =Gender= Research in the past has shown that gender does play a role in terms of how people make decisions about helping others. With regards to social responsibility of helping others in need, people feel less inclined to help those who they think need it less. Based on previous research, people have generally helped women and diffusion of responsibility is more prevalent when males have needed help because the general stereotype was that men don't need help and can handle situations on their own, whereas women were perceived as weaker than men. New research has shown that with changing viewpoints on gender stereotypes, diffusion of responsibility is less prevalent when a lone woman is in need of assistance due to the women's liberation movement, which has helped change those stereotypes.  Consequences =Groupthink= Groupthink occurs when each of the individuals composing a group desires and cares more about reaching consensus and total agreement than critically examining, understanding, and utilising information.Hollingshead, A. B., Wittenbaum, G. M., Paulus, P. B., et al. (2005). A look at groups from the functional perspective. In M. S. Poole & A. B. Hollingshead (Eds.), Theories of small groups: Interdisciplinary perspectives (pp. 21-62). Engaging in groupthink seeks to avoid any possible conflict or disagreement when making any decisions or actions, preferring compromises that may not be thought through to well-thought out arguments that do not receive unanimous approval from the group. Thus, groupthink cannot lead to the best decisions or solutions. Groupthink occurs when the group members are familiar with each other and seek each other's approval, especially in stressful situations. The diffusion of responsibility contributes to groupthink as when the diffusion of responsibility is occurring within a group, each group member feels less of a responsibility to express his or her own opinions or ideas, which leads to groupthink. Thus, when diffusion of responsibility occurs within groups, groupthink is also much more likely to occur. =Social loafing= Social loafing is the tendency for individuals to expend less effort when working collectively than when working individually. Social impact theory considers the extent to which individuals can be viewed as either sources or targets of social influence. When individuals work collectively, the demands of an outside source of social influence (e.g., an experimenter or one's boss) are diffused across multiple targets (i.e., diffusion of responsibility across all of the group members), leading to decreased levels of effort. On individual tasks, no such diffusion takes place, and individuals work hard, as there is no diffusion of responsibility. The division of social influence is thought to be a function of the strength, immediacy, and number of sources and targets present, and is predicted to follow an inverse power function specifying that each additional group member will have less influence as group size increases. Diffusion of responsibility is a direct cause of social loafing, as when diffusion of responsibility is occurring within a group, group members do not feel as responsible for their actions (or lack of action) and are much more likely to engage in social loafing. =Helping behavior= Social psychological experiments have demonstrated that individuals' failure to assist others in emergencies is not due to apathy or indifference, but rather to the presence of other people. This is explained by both bystander effect and diffusion of responsibility. In 1968 and a series of experiments that followed, John Darley and Bibb Latan√© demonstrated that an individual's choice to help or intervene when there is an emergency depends on the number of bystanders. Group size significantly influenced the likelihood of helping behavior in a staged emergency: 85% of participants responded with intervention when alone, 62% of participants took action when with one other person, and only 31% did when there were four other bystanders. Other studies have replicated the phenomenon, including reports from real emergencies such as calling an ambulance for overdose patients and offering CPR after cardiac arrest. In ambiguous situations, the individual's appraisal of the situation and subsequent action or inaction largely depends on the reactions of other people. Other bystanders' interpretation of an emergency influences perception of the incident and helping behavior. In one study, diffusion of responsibility does not occur if another bystander is perceived as being unable to help. Group psychology can also influence behaviour positively; in the event that one bystander takes responsibility for the situation and takes specific action, other bystanders are more likely to follow course. This is a positive example of the usually-pejorative herd mentality. Thus, the presence of bystanders affects individual helping behaviour by processes of social influence and diffusion of responsibility. = Moral disengagement = Diffusion of responsibility can negatively affect personal morals. With diffusion of responsibility, it has been found that people feel less accountable for their work. This lack of accountability can be due to the fact that labour is divided amongst members in a group and so no one member feels an overwhelming amount of responsibility for their organisation or their overall project. It has been found that many members get narrowed into focusing on their individual work, that they eventually forget about any moral aspects. Purely focusing on the functional aspects of their jobs is a result of division of labour, which is a mechanism for diffusion of responsibility. This can be highly concerning for organisations since division of labour is a common practice amongst many. Moral disengagement is likely to be particularly important in organisations because bureaucratic structures and the division of labour seem to lend themselves to moral disengagement mechanisms such as the diffusion and displacement of responsibility (Bandura, 1986). Euphemistic labelling is also common in organisations, such as when managers refer to layoffs as ‚Äúrightsizing.‚Äù Also, with victims out of sight, globalization makes it easier to ignore or distort the harmful consequences of business actions. Thus, moral disengagement seems highly relevant to understanding unethical behaviour in 21st century organizations.Detert, James & Klebe Trevi√±o, Linda & L Sweitzer, Vicki. (2008). Moral Disengagement in Ethical Decision Making: A Study of Antecedents and Outcomes. The Journal of Applied Psychology. 93. 374-91. 10.1037/0021-9010.93.2.374. =Risk-taking behaviour= The risky-shift effect (see groupshift) is the increased likelihood for a group to support or partake in a risky decision or action. Larger groups permit a wider responsibility diffusion than the groups of two or three. As group size increases, the likelihood also increases that the group contains at least one highly risky and influential member who would be able to win over all the others. This demonstrates how larger group size and the increased riskiness of one person can cause the diffusion of responsibility from all group members to only the decisive, risk-taking member.Nicholas Bateson, Familiarisation, group discussion, and risk taking, In Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 2, Issue 2, 1966, Pages 119-129. From the group-processes standpoint, then, the risky-shift effect becomes stronger as the groups grow larger. And it has been proved by various studies that the risky-shift effect is more pronounced the larger the size of the group. In risk-taking literature, diffusion of responsibility occurs when individual members of a group feel less personal responsibility for potential failure in the pursuit of risky options than if acting alone. Such risky shift is a stable phenomenon that has been shown in experiments involving group discussion and consensus. For example, a study using risks and payoffs based on monetary gain and loss for problem-solving performance found a greater percentage of shift‚Äîhence, increased risk taking in group decision making. Other research suggests that risky shifts can also be attributed to group polarization, majority rules, interpersonal comparisons, informational influence, and familiarisation. Like diffusion of responsibility in emergency situations, the larger the size of the group during conditions of discussion and information exchange, the greater the risky shift. = Bystander effect = Rising from the unfortunate case of Catherine \\"Kitty\\" Genovese, the bystander effect is a psychological notion that came to light in the1960s. Catherine Genovese's case seems to cast a predominantly daunting light on human behavior (Gallo, 2015). The event highlights the lessening of the likelihood of a person taking immediate action in a certain situation while part of a group or around other people.Gallo, M. M. (2015) No one helped: Kitty Genovese, New York City, and The Myth of Urban Apathy [e-book]. London: Cornell University Press. Available at: https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/nuim/reader.action?docID=3138734 Darley and Latan√© (1968) performed a study that viewed whether the presence of other bystanders would affect the likelihood and speed of which the subjects would respond to hearing another subject (a confederate) having a seizure. The subjects either believed they were in a two-person group, three-person group, or a six-person group. The researchers concluded that subjects were less likely to help the greater the number of bystanders, demonstrating the bystander effect. The bystander effect is a specific type of diffusion of responsibility‚Äîwhen people's responses to certain situations depend on the presence of others. The bystander effect occurs when multiple individuals are watching a situation unfold but do not intervene (or delay or hesitate to intervene) because they know that someone else could intervene, and they feel less responsibility to do so. This is directly caused by the diffusion of responsibility, as it is shown that individuals are much less likely to intervene in a situation when he or she knows others are watching; thus, the responsibility for helping is spread among the group of bystanders, and each bystander does not feel a strong responsibility to do so, so no one helps. However, it has been shown that people's responses and levels of aid can change depending on the type of situation (emergencies versus non-emergencies) as well.

In the Philippines, chamber pots are used as urinals and are known as arinola in most Philippine languages, such as Cebuano and Tagalog. In Korea, chamber pots are referred to as yogang (ÏöîÍ∞ï). They were used by people who did not have indoor plumbing to avoid the cold elements during the winter months. =Children's potties= Simple plastic baby's potty The term \\"potty\\" is used when discussing the toilet with small children, such as during potty training. It is also usually used to refer to the small, toilet-shaped devices made especially for potty training, which are similar to chamber pots. These \\"potties\\" are generally a large plastic bowl with an ergonomically-designed back and front to protect against splashes. They may have a built-in handle or grasp at the back to allow easy emptying and a non-slip bottom to prevent the child from sliding while in use. Some are given bright colors, and others may feature gentle or unoffensive drawings or cartoon characters. In many cases they are used since it is difficult for children to maneuver themselves up onto the normal toilet; in addition the larger opening in the regular toilet is much too wide for a child to sit over comfortably and not fall in without some type of aid. Their size means they can be packed away in a bag for days out or when camping with young children, and can be placed near or under beds for sufferers of nocturia or some other form of incontinence. Shapes and related items A chamber pot might be disguised in a sort of chair (a close stool). It might be stored in a cabinet with doors to hide it; this sort of nightstand was known as a commode, hence the latter word came to mean \\"toilet\\" as well. For homes without these items of furniture, the chamber pot was stored under the bed. The modern commode toilet and bedpan, used by bedbound or disabled persons, are variants of the chamber pot. Cultural references \\"The Crabfish\\" is an old tale, the moral of which is, look in your chamberpot before you use it. Philippine mythology recounts that giving newlyweds a chamberpot assures them of prosperity. President Elpidio Quirino, as part of a smear campaign against him, was falsely rumoured to possess a golden arinola. Thomas More in his satire Utopia had chamberpots made out of gold.

Background Murphy was born in Barrie, Ontario. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen's University in 1982 and a law degree from the University of Toronto. He practiced law with Blake, Cassels & Graydon and also served as a special advisor to Attorney General Ian Scott and a senior advisor to Ontario Minister of Education Sean Conway. In 1989-90, he ran the Ontario Campaign during Paul Martin's first unsuccessful bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. He lives in Toronto with his wife and daughter. Politics When Ian Scott resigned his legislative seat in late 1992, a by-election was called for April 1, 1993 to replace him. Murphy ran to succeed Scott as the Liberal member for St. George‚ÄîSt. David, and was successful, defeating Progressive Conservative Nancy Jackman by 2,232 votes. St. GeorgeSt. David, which is now part of Toronto Centre, included the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood, the largest gay village in Ontario. Although Murphy is not himself gay, he soon emerged as a leading spokesperson in the Ontario legislature for progressive legislation pertaining to the rights of same-sex couples, introducing a private member's bill in 1993 which would have partially extended spousal benefits.David Rayside, On the Fringe: Gays & Lesbians in Politics. He was one of only three Liberal MPPs, along with Jean Poirier and Dianne Poole, to support Bill 167, the Bob Rae government's more sweeping same-sex benefits package in 1994, and was critical of Liberal leader Lyn McLeod's decision to oppose the bill. Murphy was defeated in the 1995 provincial election, losing his seat to Progressive Conservative Al Leach by 337 votes while New Democratic candidate Brent Hawkes was a close third. Later life He returned to practicing law with McCarthy T√©trault, and served for a time as president of the Ontario Liberal Party. He supported Dwight Duncan's bid for the Ontario party leadership in 1996. On June 28, 2001, Murphy was hired by Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin as a senior political advisor. When Martin became Prime Minister in late 2003, he appointed Murphy as his chief of staff. Murphy was considered to be one of the most influential figures in the Canadian Prime Minister's Office, helping formulate policy matters as well as coordinating meetings with ministers and departments and with foreign heads of state. After the Martin government was defeated in the 2006 federal election, Murphy returned to Toronto where he joined the law firm of McMillan Binch Mendelsohn. Murphy served as a political panelist on Global's coverage of the 2006 Liberal leadership convention.

He flew aboard Soyuz 28 from 2 to 10 March 1978, becoming the first and only Czechoslovak in space. As the first cosmonaut from a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States, and with the entry of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the European Union, Remek is considered to be the first astronaut from the European Union. Remek was a member of the European Parliament between 2004 and 2013 for the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia. Since 2014, he has been the Czech Ambassador to Russia. Early life and military career Remek was born on 26 September 1948 in the city of ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. He spent two years studying at the observatory in Krav√≠ hora, Brno between 1962 and 1964. Remek was influenced by his father, Jozef Remek, himself a military pilot. Remek was an active member both in the Pioneers and the Czechoslovak Union of Youth. He studied mathematics and physics at middle school in ƒå√°slav where he earned awards in track running the 400-meter, 800-meter, and 1,500-meter events. Remek graduated in 1966 and proceeded to Vy≈°≈°√≠ Leteck√© Uƒçili≈°tƒõ, an aviation school in Ko≈°ice, where he trained in an Aero L-29 Delf√≠n. Remek graduated in 1970 and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Czechoslovak Air Force. Remek served as a fighter pilot, flying MiG-21s in the 1st Fighter Air Regiment. In the 1970s Remek married his first wife, Czech actress Hana Davidov√°, the daughter of politician V√°clav David. They had a daughter together, Anna, in 1980. He had a second daughter, Jana, three years after the first, with his second wife, also called Jana. From 1972 to 1976, Remek studied at the Gagarin Air Force Academy. Upon his return to Czechoslovakia in 1976, he was promoted to captain and appointed deputy commander of his fighter regiment, after which Remek went back to Russia to train for the Soviet-led space program. Following his return from space in March 1978, Remek spent time in the Czechoslovak People's Army (ƒåSLA) staff as the deputy director of the Flight Research Institute in Prague. In 1986, Remek became the deputy commander of a flight division based in ƒå√°slav. In 1988 he graduated from Voroshilov-Staff Academy of Soviet Air Force and was appointed to his highest command, as deputy of the 2nd Air Defense Division stationed in Moravia. Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Remek was relegated to a role as Director of the Museum for Aviation and Astronautics in Prague. Following his retirement from the air force in 1995, Remek represented Czech firm CZ Strakonice and joint venture CZ‚ÄìTurbo- GAZ in Moscow. Intercosmos program Module used by Remek to return to Earth Remek (then a Captain) joined the Interkosmos program in 1976; his backup was Old≈ôich Pelƒç√°k, the other Czechoslovak cosmonaut selected to participate with the program. During the flight, Remek experimented with the Kristall furnace on board the capsule. The mission, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the Soviet-backed 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat, and including Remek, the son of a Czech mother and Slovak father, had propaganda value in stressing Czechoslovak-Soviet cooperation. Remek himself has not denied this although he retains pride in his voyage regardless of the circumstances. On the Soyuz 28 mission that launched 2 March 1978, he became the first cosmonaut from a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States, and with the entry of the Czech Republic into the European Union, Remek is considered to be the first astronaut from the European Union. After Remek's flight, he was celebrated in his home country with a series of receptions at factories and other civil workplaces. He was also recognized at a ceremony at Prague Castle as a guest of Gust√°v Hus√°k, then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. On 16 March, Remek and Aleksei Gubarev, the other member of the crew, were awarded the medal Hero of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovak reaction to Remek's flight included comments about the media's inundation focused on Remek and the fact that he was only able to journey with a Soviet cosmonaut as if Remek needed a minder. One joke went: \\"Why didn't the Soviets send up two Czechoslovak cosmonauts? Because they would've landed in West Germany.\\" Remek himself joked that his Soviet counterpart would slap Remek's hands off of controls if he touched anything without permission. French astronaut Jean-Loup Chr√©tien experienced this same behavior onboard Soyuz TM-7 in 1988. Political career Due in part to his previous business contacts in Russia, Remek was appointed to the Czech Embassy in Moscow as a Trade and Economic Counselor. During the 2004 European Parliament election, Remek was a candidate for the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and, being second on the list behind Miloslav Ransdorf, was elected into the European Parliament. During his first term (20 July 2004 to 13 July 2009), Remek was a member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left‚ÄìNordic Green Left in the European Parliament. He was a vocal proponent of the EU's Galileo satellite constellation, warning that bureaucratic delay could cede opportunity to the BeiDou, a Chinese competitor. He was reelected in 2009. When Petr Kol√°≈ô resigned as the Czech Ambassador to Russia in December 2012, the ambassadorship sat empty for a year until the President of the Czech Republic, Milo≈° Zeman, appointed Remek in January 2014. The appointment met with controversy as it was against the wishes of Zeman's Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg. Observers have noted Remek has a friendly history with the Russians and although his communist affiliations are a minority in Russia, his appointment represents Zeman's pragmatic and pro-Russia stance. In popular culture Statue of Remek and Gubarev in Ko≈°ice Czech astronomer Anton√≠n Mrkos discovered an asteroid in September 1978 and named it 2552 Remek after the cosmonaut. Remek is featured in a 2009 independent comedy film called Osadne about three residents from Osadn√© that seek out Remek at his office in Brussels to help tourism in their town. Sculptor Jan Barto≈° created a statue of Remek and Gubarev, which is located at H√°je metro station, formerly known as Kosmonaut≈Ø (meaning [station of] the astronauts) until 1990, in Prague.

The verses are highlighted and are embedded inside the bhasya (commentary). Pata√±jali Statue (traditional form indicating kundalini or incarnation of Shesha) The Yoga S≈´tra of Pata√±jali is a collection of 195 Sanskrit sutras (aphorisms) on the theory and practice of yoga. The Yoga Sutra was compiled sometime between 500 BCE and 400 CE by the sage Patanjali in India who synthesized and organized knowledge about yoga from much older traditions. The Yoga S≈´tra of Pata√±jali was the most translated ancient Indian text in the medieval era, having been translated into about forty Indian languages and two non-Indian languages: Old Javanese and Arabic. The text fell into relative obscurity for nearly 700 years from the 12th to 19th century, and made a comeback in late 19th century due to the efforts of Swami Vivekananda, the Theosophical Society and others. It gained prominence again as a comeback classic in the 20th century. Before the 20th century, history indicates that the medieval Indian yoga scene was dominated by the various other texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Vasistha, texts attributed to Yajnavalkya and Hiranyagarbha, as well as literature on hatha yoga, tantric yoga and Pashupata Shaivism yoga rather than the Yoga S≈´tra of Pata√±jali. Yoga tradition holds the Yoga S≈´tra of Pata√±jali to be one of the foundational texts of classical Yoga philosophy.Stuart Sarbacker (2011), Yoga Powers (Editor: Knut A. Jacobsen), Brill, , page 195 However, the appropriation - and misappropriation - of the Yoga Sutras and its influence on later systematizations of yoga has been questioned by scholars such as David Gordon White, but reaffirmed by others such as James Mallinson. Modern scholars of yoga such as Philipp A. Maas and Mallinson consider the Bhasya commentary on the Sutras to be Patanjali's own, and the Sutras to be his summary of older accounts of yoga. The combined document is thus considered to be a single work, the PƒÅta√±jalayoga≈õƒÅstra. Author and dating=Author= The colophons of manuscripts of the Yoga S≈´tras attribute the work to Patanjali. The identity of this Pata√±jali has been the subject of academic debate because an author of the same name is credited with the authorship of the classic text on Sanskrit grammar named MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya that is firmly datable to the second century BCE. Yet the two works are completely different in subject matter and in the details of language, grammar and vocabulary, as was compellingly pointed out long ago by Louis Renou. Furthermore, before the time of Bhoja (11th century), no known text states that the authors were the same. =Dating= Philipp A. Maas assessed Pata√±jali's PƒÅta√±jalayoga≈õƒÅstra's date to be about 400 CE, based on synchronisms between its arguments and those of Vasubandhu, on tracing the history of the commentaries on it published in the first millennium CE, on the opinions of earlier Sanskrit commentators, on the testimony of manuscript colophons and on a review of extant literature. This dating for the PƒÅta√±jalayoga≈õƒÅstra was proposed as early as 1914 by Woods and has been accepted widely by academic scholars of the history of Indian philosophical thought. Edwin Bryant, on the other hand, surveyed the major commentators in his translation of the Yoga S≈´tras. He observed that \\"Most scholars date the text shortly after the turn of the Common Era (circa first to second century), but that it has been placed as early as several centuries before that.\\" Bryant concluded that \\"A number of scholars have dated the Yoga S≈´tras as late as the fourth or fifth century C.E., but these arguments have all been challenged. ... All such arguments [for a late date] are problematic.\\" Michele Desmarais summarized a wide variety of dates assigned to Yogasutra, ranging from 500 BCE to 3rd century CE, noting that there is a paucity of evidence for any certainty. She stated the text may have been composed at an earlier date given conflicting theories on how to date it, but latter dates are more commonly accepted by scholars.Michele Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds: Mind, Consciousness and Identity in Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 16-17 =Compilation= The Yoga Sutras are a composite of various traditions. The levels of samƒÅdhi taught in the text resemble the Buddhist jhanas. According to Feuerstein, the Yoga Sutras are a condensation of two different traditions, namely \\"eight limb yoga\\" (a·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga yoga) and action yoga (Kriya yoga). The kriya yoga part is contained in chapter 1, chapter 2 sutras 1-27, chapter 3 except sutra 54, and chapter 4. The \\"eight limb yoga\\" is described in chapter 2 sutras 28-55, and chapter 3 sutras 3 and 54. According to Maas, Pata√±jali's composition was entitled PƒÅta√±jalayoga≈õƒÅstra (\\"The Treatise on Yoga according to Pata√±jali\\") and consisted of both S≈´tras and BhƒÅ·π£ya. According to Wujastyk, referencing Maas, Patanjali integrated yoga from older traditions in PƒÅta√±jalayoga≈õƒÅstra, and added his own explanatory passages to create the unified work that, since 1100 CE, has been considered the work of two people. Together the compilation of Patanjali's sutras and the Vyasabhasya, is called PƒÅta√±jalayoga≈õƒÅstra. According to Maas, this means that the earliest commentary on the Yoga S≈´tras, the BhƒÅ·π£ya, that has commonly been ascribed to some unknown later author VyƒÅsa (the editor), was Pata√±jali's own work. Contents Pata√±jali divided his Yoga Sutras into four chapters or books (Sanskrit Pada), containing in all 196 aphorisms, divided as follows: * Samadhi Pada (51 sutras). Samadhi refers to a state of direct and reliable perception (pramƒÅ·πáa) where the yogi's self- identity is absorbed into pure consciousness, collapsing the categories of witness, witnessing, and witnessed. Samadhi is the main technique the yogi learns by which to dive into the depths of the mind to achieve Kaivalya (liberation). The author describes yoga and then the nature and the means of attaining samƒÅdhi. * This chapter contains the famous definitional verse: \\"Yoga≈õ citta-vritti-nirodha·∏•\\" (\\"Yoga is the restraint of fluctuations/patterns of consciousness\\"). * Sadhana Pada (55 sutras). Sadhana is the Sanskrit word for \\"practice\\" or \\"discipline\\". Here the author outlines two systems of Yoga: KriyƒÅ Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga (Eightfold or Eightlimbed Yoga). * KriyƒÅ Yoga in the Yoga S≈´tras is the practice of three of the Niyamas of A·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga Yoga: # tapas - austerity # svƒÅdhyaya - self-study of the scriptures # i≈õvara pra·πáidhana ‚Äì devotion to god or pure consciousness * A·π£·π≠ƒÅnga Yoga is the yoga of eight limbs: # Yama - restraints or ethics of behaviour # Niyama - observances # ƒÄsana - physical postures # PrƒÅ·πáƒÅyƒÅma - control of the prana(breath) # Pratyahara - withdrawal of the senses # DhƒÅra·πáa - concentration # DhyƒÅna - meditation # SamƒÅdhi - absorption * Vibhuti Pada (56 sutras). Vibhuti is the Sanskrit word for \\"power\\" or \\"manifestation\\". 'Supra- normal powers' (Sanskrit: siddhi) are acquired by the practice of yoga. Combined simultaneous practice of DhƒÅra·πáƒÅ, Dhyana and SamƒÅdhi is referred to as Samyama, and is considered a tool of achieving various perfections, or Siddhis. The text warns (III.37) that these powers can become an obstacle to the yogi who seeks liberation. * Kaivalya Pada (34 sutras). Kaivalya literally translates to \\"isolation\\", but as used in the Sutras stands for emancipation or liberation and is used where other texts often employ the term moksha (liberation). The Kaivalya Pada describes the process of liberation and the reality of the transcendental ego. =Purpose of yoga= Pata√±jali practicing dhyana at Patanjali Yogpeeth Patanjali begins his treatise by stating the purpose of his book in the first sutra, followed by defining the word \\"yoga\\" in his second sutra of Book 1: * Sanskrit Original with Translation 1: The Yoga Philosophy TR Tatya (Translator), with Bhojaraja commentary; Harvard University Archives; * Translation 2: The Yoga-darsana: The sutras of Patanjali with the Bhasya of Vyasa GN Jha (Translator), with notes; Harvard University Archives; * Translation 3: The Yogasutras of Patanjali Charles Johnston (Translator) This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms. I. K. Taimni translates it as \\"Yoga is the inhibition (') of the modifications (') of the mind (')\\".For text and word-by-word translation as \\"Yoga is the inhibition of the modifications of the mind.\\" See: Taimni, p. 6. Swami Vivekananda translates the sutra as \\"Yoga is restraining the mind- stuff (Citta) from taking various forms (Vrittis).\\"Vivekananda, p. 115. Bryant states that, to Patanjali, \\"Yoga essentially consists of meditative practices culminating in attaining a state of consciousness free from all modes of active or discursive thought, and of eventually attaining a state where consciousness is unaware of any object external to itself, that is, is only aware of its own nature as consciousness unmixed with any other object.\\"Edwin Bryant (2011, Rutgers University), The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali IEP =Ashtanga, the eight components of yoga= Patanjali defines yoga as having eight components (‡§Ö‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§æ‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó , \\"eight limbs\\"): \\"The eight limbs of yoga are yama (abstinences), niyama (observances), asana (yoga postures), pranayama (breath control), pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses), dharana (concentration), dhyana (meditation) and samadhi (absorption).\\"Yoga Sutras 2.29. 1. Yamas Yamas are ethical vows in the Yogic tradition and can be thought of as moral imperatives. The five yamas listed by Pata√±jali in Yogas≈´tra 2.30 are: # Ahi·πÉsƒÅ (‡§Ö‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ): Nonviolence, non-harming other living beings through actions and speechJames Lochtefeld, \\"Yama (2)\\", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N‚ÄìZ, Rosen Publishing. , page 777 # Satya (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø): truthfulness, non-falsehood # Asteya (‡§Ö‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Ø): non-stealing # Brahmacarya (‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø): chastity, marital fidelity or sexual restraint[a] Louise Taylor (2001), A Woman's Book of Yoga, Tuttle, , page 3; [b]Jeffrey Long (2009), Jainism: An Introduction, IB Tauris, , page 109; Quote: The fourth vow - brahmacarya - means for laypersons, marital fidelity and pre-marital celibacy; for ascetics, it means absolute celibacy; John Cort states, \\"Brahmacharya involves having sex only with one's spouse, as well as the avoidance of ardent gazing or lewd gestures (...) - Quoted by Long, ibid, page 101 # Aparigraha (‡§Ö‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π): Non-greed, non-grasping, non- possessivenessArti Dhand (2002), The dharma of ethics, the ethics of dharma: Quizzing the ideals of Hinduism, Journal of Religious Ethics, 30(3), pages 347-372 The commentaries on these teachings of Patanjali state how and why each of the above self restraints help in the personal growth of an individual. For example, in verse II.35, Patanjali states that the virtue of nonviolence and non-injury to others (Ahimsa) leads to the abandonment of enmity, a state that leads the yogi to the perfection of inner and outer amity with everyone, everything.The Yoga Philosophy T. R. Tatya (Translator), with Bhojaraja commentary; Harvard University Archives, page 80Jan E. M. Houben and Karel Rijk van Kooij (1999), Violence Denied: Violence, Non-Violence and the Rationalization of Violence in South Asian Cultural History, Brill Academic, , pages 4-5 with footnotes In Sutra 2.31, Patanjali calls the Yamas Mahavratam, which means a Great Vow. Patanjali states that practice of the Yamas is universal and it should not be limited by class, place, time or circumstances. 2.

PratyƒÅhƒÅra PratyƒÅhƒÅra is a combination of two Sanskrit words prati- (the prefix ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø-, \\"against\\" or \\"contra\\") and ƒÅhƒÅra (‡§Ü‡§π‡§æ‡§∞, \\"food,diet or intake\\")Ahara:Wisdomlimb, Meaning of term Ahara Pratyahara means not taking any input or any information from the sense organs. It is a process of retracting the sensory experience from external objects. It is a step of self extraction and abstraction. Pratyahara is not consciously closing one's eyes to the sensory world, it is consciously closing one's mind processes to the sensory world. Pratyahara empowers one to stop being controlled by the external world, fetch one's attention to seek self-knowledge and experience the freedom innate in one's inner world.Geeta Iyengar (1998), Yoga: A Gem for Women, , pages 29-30Charlotte Bell (2007), Mindful Yoga, Mindful Life: A Guide for Everyday Practice, Rodmell Press, , pages 136-144 Pratyahara marks the transition of yoga experience from first four limbs that perfect external forms to last three limbs that perfect inner state, from outside to inside, from outer sphere of body to inner sphere of spirit.RS Bajpai (2002), The Splendours And Dimensions Of Yoga, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 342-345 6. DhƒÅra·πáƒÅ Dharana (Sanskrit: ‡§ß‡§æ‡§∞‡§£‡§æ) means concentration, introspective focus and one-pointedness of mind.

DhyƒÅna Dhyana (Sanskrit: ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®) literally means \\"contemplation, reflection\\" and \\"profound, abstract meditation\\".dhyAna, Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (2008 revision), Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany Dhyana is contemplating, reflecting on whatever Dharana has focused on. If in the sixth limb of yoga one focused on a personal deity, Dhyana is its contemplation. If the concentration was on one object, Dhyana is non-judgmental, non-presumptuous observation of that object.Charlotte Bell (2007), Mindful Yoga, Mindful Life: A Guide for Everyday Practice, Rodmell Press, , pages 151-159 If the focus was on a concept/idea, Dhyana is contemplating that concept/idea in all its aspects, forms and consequences. Dhyana is uninterrupted train of thought, current of cognition, flow of awareness. Dhyana is integrally related to Dharana, one leads to other. Dharana is a state of mind, Dhyana the process of mind. Dhyana is distinct from Dharana in that the meditator becomes actively engaged with its focus. Patanjali defines contemplation (Dhyana) as the mind process, where the mind is fixed on something, and then there is \\"a course of uniform modification of knowledge\\".The Yoga Philosophy T. R. Tatya (Translator), with Bhojaraja commentary; Harvard University Archives, page 94-95 Adi Shankara, in his commentary on Yoga Sutras, distinguishes Dhyana from Dharana, by explaining Dhyana as the yoga state when there is only the \\"stream of continuous thought about the object, uninterrupted by other thoughts of a different kind for the same object\\"; Dharana, states Shankara, is focussed on one object, but aware of its many aspects and ideas about the same object. Shankara gives the example of a yogin in a state of dharana on morning sun may be aware of its brilliance, color and orbit; the yogin in dhyana state \\"contemplates on sun's orbit alone for example, without being interrupted by its color, brilliance or other related ideas\\", according to Trevor Leggett.Trevor Leggett (2006), Shankara on the Yoga Sutras: A Full Translation of the Newly Discovered Text, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 282-284 8. SamƒÅdhi Samadhi (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø) literally means \\"putting together, joining, combining with, union, harmonious whole, trance\\".samAdhi, Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (2008 revision), Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, GermanysamAdhi Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany Samadhi is oneness with the subject of meditation. There is no distinction, during the eighth limb of yoga, between the actor of meditation, the act of meditation and the subject of meditation. Samadhi is that spiritual state when one's mind is so absorbed in whatever it is contemplating on, that the mind loses the sense of its own identity. The thinker, the thought process and the thought fuse with the subject of thought. There is only oneness, samadhi.HariharƒÅnanda ƒÄra·πáya (1983), Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali, State University of New York Press, , pages 252-253Michele Marie Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds : Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patanjali'S Yoga-Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 175-176 All three (Dhyana, Dharana and Samadhi) practised on a particular object or subject is called Sanyam by Patanjali. Discussion=Samadhi= Samadhi is of two kinds, with and without support of an object of meditation: * Samprajnata Samadhi, also called savikalpa samadhi and Sabija Samadhi,Swami Sivananda, Samprajnata Samadhi meditation with support of an object. Samprajnata samadhi is associated with deliberation, reflection, bliss, and I-am-ness. :The first two associations, deliberation and reflection, form the basis of the various types of samapatti: :* Savitarka, \\"deliberative\\": The citta is concentrated upon a gross object of meditation, an object with a manifest appearance that is perceptible to our senses, such as a flame of a lamp, the tip of the nose, or the image of a deity. Conceptualization (vikalpa) still takes place, in the form of perception, the word and the knowledge of the object of meditation. When the deliberation is ended this is called nirvitarka samadhi. :* Savichara, \\"reflective\\": the citta is concentrated upon a subtle object of meditation, which is not percpetible to the senses, but arrived at through inference, such as the senses, the process of cognition, the mind, the I-am-ness, the chakras, the inner-breath (prana), the nadis, the intellect (buddhi). The stilling of reflection is called nirvichara samapatti. :The last two associations, sananda samadhi and sasmita, are respectively a state of meditation, and an object of savichara samadhi: :* Sananda Samadhi, ananda, \\"bliss\\": this state emphasizes the still subtler state of bliss in meditation; ::* Sasmita: the citta is concentrated upon the sense or feeling of \\"I-am-ness\\". * Asamprajnata Samadhi, also called Nirvikalpa SamadhiSri Swami Sivananda, Raja Yoga Samadhi and Nirbija Samadhi: meditation without an object,Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati, Integrating 50+ Varieties of Yoga Meditation which leads to knowledge of purusha or consciousness, the subtlest element. =Ananda and asmita= According to Ian Whicher, the status of ananda and asmita in Patanjali's system is a matter of dispute. According to Maehle, the first two constituents, deliberation and reflection, form the basis of the various types of samapatti. According to Feuerstein, Ian Whicher disagrees with Feuerstein, seeing ananda and asmita as later stages of nirvicara-samapatti. Whicher refers to VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra (900-980 CE), the founder of the BhƒÅmatƒ´ Advaita Vedanta who proposes eight types of samapatti: * Savitarka-samƒÅpatti and Nirvitarka-samƒÅpatti, both with gross objects as objects of support; * SavicƒÅra-samƒÅpatti and NirvicƒÅra- samƒÅpatti, both with subtle objects as objects of support; * SƒÅnanda-samƒÅpatti and NirƒÅnanda-samƒÅpatti, both with the sense organs as objects of support * SƒÅsmitƒÅ-samƒÅpatti and NirasmitƒÅ-samƒÅpatti, both with the sense of \\"I-am-ness\\" as support. Vijnana Bikshu (ca. 1550-1600) proposes a six-stage model, explicitly rejecting Vacaspati Misra's model. Vijnana Bikshu regards joy (ananda) as a state that arises when the mind passes beyond the vicara stage. Whicher agrees that ananda is not a separate stage of samadhi. According to Whicher, Patanjali's own view seems to be that nirvicara-samadhi is the highest form of cognitive ecstasy. = Epistemology = The epistemology in Patanjali's system of Yoga, like the SƒÅmkhya school of Hinduism, relies on three of six Pramanas, as the means of gaining reliable knowledge.John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, , page 238 These included Pratyak·π£a (perception), AnumƒÅ·πáa (inference) and Sabda (ƒÄptavacana, word/testimony of reliable sources). * Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, , pages 245-248; * John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, , page 238 Patanjali's system, like the Samkhya school, considers Pratyak·π£a or D·πõ·π£·π≠am (direct sense perception), AnumƒÅna (inference), and ≈öabda or ƒÄptavacana (verbal testimony of the sages or shƒÅstras) to be the only valid means of knowledge or Pramana. Unlike few other schools of Hinduism such as Advaita Vedanta, Yoga did not adopt the following three Pramanas: UpamƒÅ·πáa (comparison and analogy), ArthƒÅpatti (postulation, deriving from circumstances) or Anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof). =Metaphysics= The metaphysics of Patanjali is built on the same dualist foundation as the Samkhya school.Edwin Bryant (2011, Rutgers University), The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali IEP The universe is conceptualized as of two realities in Samkhya- Yoga schools: Puru·π£a (consciousness) and prakriti (matter). It considers consciousness and matter, self/soul and body as two different realities. Jiva (a living being) is considered as a state in which puru·π£a is bonded to prakriti in some form, in various permutations and combinations of various elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.Samkhya - Hinduism Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2014) During the state of imbalance or ignorance, one of more constituents overwhelm the others, creating a form of bondage. The end of this bondage is called liberation, or moksha by both Yoga and Samkhya school of Hinduism.Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 36-47 The ethical theory of Yoga school is based on Yamas and Niyama, as well as elements of the Gu·πáa theory of Samkhya. Patanjali adopts the theory of Gu·πáa from Samkhya. Gu·πáas theory states that three gunas (innate tendency, attributes) are present in different proportions in all beings, and these three are sattva guna (goodness, constructive, harmonious), rajas guna (passion, active, confused), and tamas guna (darkness, destructive, chaotic).Alban Widgery (1930), The principles of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 40, No. 2, pages 234-237James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, , page 265 These three are present in every being but in different proportions, and the fundamental nature and psychological dispositions of beings is a consequence of the relative proportion of these three gunas. When sattva guna predominates an individual, the qualities of lucidity, wisdom, constructiveness, harmony, and peacefulness manifest themselves; when rajas is predominant, attachment, craving, passion- driven activity and restlessness manifest; and when tamas predominates in an individual, ignorance, delusion, destructive behavior, lethargy, and suffering manifests. The gu·πáas theory underpins the philosophy of mind in Yoga school of Hinduism. =Soteriology= Kaivalya in Yoga school. Samkhya school suggests that jnana (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha, Patanjali suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha. Patanjali holds that ignorance is the cause of suffering and sa·πÅsƒÅra. Liberation, like many other schools, is removal of ignorance, which is achieved through discriminative discernment, knowledge and self-awareness. The Yoga S≈´tras is Yoga school's treatise on how to accomplish this. SamƒÅdhi is the state where ecstatic awareness develops, state Yoga scholars, and this is how one starts the process of becoming aware of Purusa and true Self. It further claims that this awareness is eternal, and once this awareness is achieved, a person cannot ever cease being aware; this is moksha, the soteriological goal in Hinduism. Book 3 of Patanjali's Yogasutra is dedicated to soteriological aspects of yoga philosophy. Patanjali begins by stating that all limbs of yoga are necessary foundation to reaching the state of self-awareness, freedom and liberation. He refers to the three last limbs of yoga as sanyama, in verses III.4 to III.5, and calls it the technology for \\"discerning principle\\" and mastery of citta and self-knowledge.Gregor Maehle (2007), Ashtanga Yoga: Practice & Philosophy, , pages 237-238 In verse III.12, the Yogasutras state that this discerning principle then empowers one to perfect sant (tranquility) and udita (reason) in one's mind and spirit, through intentness. This leads to one's ability to discern the difference between sabda (word), artha (meaning) and pratyaya (understanding), and this ability empowers one to compassionately comprehend the cry/speech of all living beings.The Yoga-darsana: The sutras of Patanjali with the Bhasya of Vyasa - Book 3 GN Jha (Translator); Harvard University Archives, pages 108-126The Yoga Philosophy TR Tatya (Translator), with Bhojaraja commentary; Harvard University Archives, pages 108-109 Once a yogi reaches this state of samyama, it leads to unusual powers, intuition, self- knowledge, freedoms and kaivalya, the soteriological goal of the yogi. =God= Patanjali differs from the closely related non-theistic/atheistic Samkhya school by incorporating what some scholars have called a \\"personal, yet essentially inactive, deity\\" or \\"personal god\\" (Ishvara).Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, , page 39-41Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 38-39Kovoor T.

Thesis awarded by University of Berne, Switzerland, page 8Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, , pages 31-46 The Yogasutras of Patanjali use the term Isvara in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Ever since the Sutra's release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is Isvara? These commentaries range from defining Isvara from a \\"personal god\\" to \\"special self\\" to \\"anything that has spiritual significance to the individual\\". * HariharƒÅnanda ƒÄra·πáya (2007), Parabhaktisutra, Aporisms on Sublime Devotion, (Translator: A Chatterjee), in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 55-93; * HariharƒÅnanda ƒÄra·πáya (2007), Eternally Liberated Isvara and Purusa Principle, in Divine Hymns with Supreme Devotional Aphorisms, Kapil Math Press, Kolkata, pages 126-129 Whicher states that while Patanjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of Isvara in Yoga philosophy functions as a \\"transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation\\". Patanjali defines Isvara (Sanskrit: ‡§à‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞) in verse 24 of Book 1, as \\"a special Self (‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•á‡§∑, puru·π£a-vi≈õe·π£a)\\", This sutra adds the characteristics of Isvara as that special Self which is unaffected (‡§Ö‡§™‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü, aparamrsta) by one's obstacles/hardships (‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§∂, klesha), one's circumstances created by past or one's current actions (‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ, karma), one's life fruits (‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡§æ‡§ï, vip√¢ka), and one's psychological dispositions/intentions (‡§Ü‡§∂‡§Ø, ashaya).aparAmRSTa, kleza, karma, vipaka and ashaya; Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, GermanyLloyd Pflueger (2008), Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 31-45 Philosophical roots and influences The Yoga Sutras incorporated the teachings of many other Indian philosophical systems prevalent at the time. Samkhya and Yoga are thought to be two of the many schools of philosophy that originated over the centuries that had common roots in the Vedic cultures and traditions of India. The orthodox Hindu philosophies of Samkhya, Yoga, Vedanta, as well as the non- orthodox Nastika systems of Jainism and Buddhism can all be seen as representing one stream of spiritual activity in ancient India, in contrast to the Bhakti traditions and Vedic ritualism which were also prevalent at the same time. The Vedanta-Sramana traditions, iconolatry and Vedic rituals can be identified with the Jnana marga, Bhakti marga and the Karma marga respectively that are outlined in the Bhagavad Gita. =Hinduism= The Yoga Sutras are built on a foundation of Samkhya philosophy, an orthodox (Astika) and atheistic Hindu system of dualism, and are generally seen as the practice while Samkhya is the theory. The influence of Samkhya is so pervasive in the Sutras that the historian Surendranath Dasgupta went so far as to deny independent categorization to Pata√±jali's system, preferring to refer to it as Patanjala Samkhya, similar to the position taken by the Jain writer Haribhadra in his commentary on Yoga.p222. A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1 By Surendranath Dasgupta Pata√±jali's Yoga Sutras accept the Samkhya's division of the world and phenomena into twenty-five tattvas or principles, of which one is Purusha meaning Self or consciousness, the others being Prakriti (primal nature), Buddhi (intellect or will), Ahamkara (ego), Manas (mind), five buddhindriyas (sensory capabilities), five karmendriyas (action-capabilities) and ten elements.Indian Philosophy Vol 2, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. p.314p236. Classical SƒÅ·πÉkhya: an interpretation of its history and meaning, By Gerald James Larson The second part of the Sutras, the Sadhana, also summarizes the Samkhya perspectives about all seen activity lying within the realm of the three Gunas of Sattva (illumination), Rajas (passion) and Tamas (lethargy).Reconciling yogas: Haribhadra's collection of views on yoga. By Christopher Chapple, Haribhadras≈´ri, John Thomas Casey p16 The Yoga Sutras diverge from early Samkhya by the addition of the principle of Isvara or God, as exemplified by Sutra 1.23 - \\"I≈õvara pranidh√£n√£t v√£\\", which is interpreted to mean that surrender to God is one way to liberation.Yoga sutras of Pata√±jali Sutra 1.23, from Light on the Yoga Sutras of Pantanjali by B.K.S Iyengar Isvara is defined here as \\"a distinct Consciousness, untouched by afflictions, actions, fruitions or their residue\\".Reconciling yogas: Haribhadra's collection of views on yoga. By Christopher Chapple, Haribhadras≈´ri, John Thomas Casey. p15 In the sutras, it is suggested that devotion to Isvara, represented by the mystical syllable Om may be the most efficient method of achieving the goal of Yoga.An outline of the religious literature of India. By John Nicol Farquhar. p. 132. This syllable Om is a central element of Hinduism, appearing in all the Upanishads, including the earliest Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishads, and expounded upon in the Mandukya Upanishad.Meditation on Om in the Mandukya Upanishad Another divergence from Samkhya is that while the Samkhya holds that knowledge is the means to liberation, Pata√±jali's Yoga insists on the methods of concentration and active striving. The aim of Yoga is to free the individual from the clutches of the matter, and considers intellectual knowledge alone to be inadequate for the purpose ‚Äì which is different from the position taken by Samkhya. However, the essential similarities between the Samkhya and Pata√±jali's system remained even after the addition of the Isvara principle,. These two are regarded in India as twins, the two aspects of a single discipline. provides a basic theoretical exposition of human nature, enumerating and defining its elements, analyzing their manner of co-operation in a state of bondage (\\"bandha\\"), and describing their state of disentanglement or separation in release (\\"\\"), while Yoga treats specifically of the dynamics of the process for the disentanglement, and outlines practical techniques for the gaining of release, or \\"isolation-integration\\" (\\"kaivalya\\"). with Max M√ºller noting that \\"the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord....\\"M√ºller (1899), Chapter 7, \\"Yoga Philosophy,\\" p. 104. The Bhagavad Gita, one of the chief scriptures of Hinduism, is considered to be based on this synthetic Samkhya-Yoga system. The Yoga S≈´tras of Pata√±jali is a foundational text of the Yoga philosophy school of Hinduism. =Buddhism= Scholars have presented different viewpoints on the relationship between Patanjali's Yoga Sutras and the teachings in Buddhist texts.Peter Heehs (2002), Indian Religions: A Historical Reader of Spiritual Expression and Experience, New York University Press, , pages 136-142Michele Desmarais (2008), Changing Minds: Mind, Consciousness And Identity In Patanjali'S Yoga- Sutra, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 72-81 with footnotes Karel Werner writes, \\"Patanjali's system is unthinkable without Buddhism. As far as its terminology goes there is much in the Yoga Sutras that reminds us of Buddhist formulations from the PƒÅli Canon and even more so from the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Abhidharma and from SautrƒÅntika.\\"Karel Werner (1994), The Yogi and the Mystic. Routledge, , page 26 He adds, \\"upon the whole it [Patanjali's Yoga sutras] is more elaborate and summarizes the actual technique of Yoga procedures more exactly than the Buddhist exposition\\".Karel Werner (1998), Yoga and the Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 131 However, states Werner, \\"The Buddha was the founder of his system, even though, admittedly, he made use of some of the experiences he had previously gained under various Yoga teachers of his time. Patanjali is neither a founder nor a leader of a new movement. (...) The ingenuity of his [Patanjali's] achievement lies in the thoroughness and completeness with which all the important stages of Yoga practice and mental experiences are included in his scheme, and in their systematic presentation in a succinct treatise.\\" Werner adds that the ideas of existence and the focus on \\"Self, Soul\\" in Patajali's Yogasutra are different from the \\"no Self\\" precepts of Buddhism.Karel Werner (1994), The Yogi and the Mystic. Routledge, , pages 120-125, 139-145 According to David Gordon White, the language of the Yoga Sutras is often closer to \\"Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, the Sanskrit of the early Mahayana Buddhist scriptures, than to the classical Sanskrit of other Hindu scriptures\\". He adds, historical evidence suggests that yoga philosophical systems influenced, and were influenced by, other philosophical systems in India such as early Buddhism and Jainism. White mentions controversies about the Yoga Sutras. A significant minority of scholars, notes White for example, believes that Vyasa lived a few centuries after Patanjali and his \\"Hindu-izing\\" commentary subverted Yoga Sutras' original \\"Buddhist\\" teachings; while the majority scholarly view disagrees with this view. Other scholars state there are differences between the teachings in the Yoga Sutras and those in Buddhist texts. Patanjali's Yoga Sutras for example, states Michele Desmarias, accept the concept of a Self or soul behind the operational mind, while Buddhists do not accept such a Self exists. The role of Self is central to the idea of Sa·πÉyoga, Citta, Self-awareness and other concepts in Chapters 2 through 4 of the Yoga sutras, according to Desmarias. According to Barbara Miller, the difference between Patanjali's Yoga Sutras and teachings in Buddhist texts is, \\"In Samkhya and Yoga, as in Buddhism and Jainism, the most salient characteristic of existence is duhkha or suffering. According to Buddhism, the origin of suffering is desire; according to Yoga, it is the connection between the observer (Purusha) with the observed (Prakrti). In both systems, the origin of duhkha is ignorance. There are also similarities in the means of deliverance recommended by the two systems. In Buddhism, the aspirant is asked to follow the eightfold path, which culminates in right meditation or samadhi. In Yoga, the aspirant is asked to follow a somewhat different eight fold path, which also culminates in samadhi. But the aim of yoga meditation is conceived in terms that a Buddhist would not accept: as the separation of an eternal conscious self from unconscious matter. The purpose of Patanjali's Yoga is to bring about this separation by means of understanding, devotion and practice.\\" Robert Thurman writes that Pata√±jali was influenced by the success of the Buddhist monastic system to formulate his own matrix for the version of thought he considered orthodox.Robert Thurman, The Central Philosophy of Tibet. Princeton University Press, 1984, page 34.

Jainism Today and Its Future.

It bars violence against \\"all creatures\\" (sarvabhuta) and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of metempsychosis/reincarnation (CU 8.15.1).T√§htinen pp. 2‚Äì5; English translation: Schmidt p. 631. It also names Ahimsa as one of five essential virtues].Christopher Chapple (2008) Yoga and the Luminous: Pata√±jali's Spiritual Path to Freedom New York: SUNY Press, Translations and commentaries The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali was the most translated ancient Indian text in the medieval era, having been translated into about forty Indian languages and two non-Indian languages: Old Javanese and Arabic. * In early 11th century, the Persian scholar Al Biruni (973-1050 CE) visited India, lived with Hindus for 16 years, and with their help translated several significant Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian languages. One of these was Patanjali's Yogasutras. His translation included the text and a hitherto unknown Sanskrit commentary.S Pines and T Gelblum (Translators from Arabic to English, 1966), Al-Bƒ´r≈´ni (Translator from Sanskrit to Arabic, ~ 1035 AD), and Pata√±jali, Al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´'s Arabic Version of Pata√±jali's Yogas≈´tra, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Vol. 29, No. 2 (1966), pages 302-325Hellmut Ritter, al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´'s √ºbersetzung des Yoga-S≈´tra des Pata√±jali, Oriens, Vol. 9, No. 2 (31 December 1956), pages 165-200 (in German) Al Biruni's translation preserved many of the core themes of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism, but certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated making it more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology. Al Biruni's version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD. * The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali was translated into Old Javanese by Indonesian Hindus, and the text was called Dharma Patanjala. The surviving text has been dated to about 1450 CE, however it is unclear if this text is a copy of an earlier translation and whether other translations existed in Indonesia. This translation shares ideas found in other Indian translations particularly those in the ≈öaiva traditions, and some in Al Biruni translation, but it is also significantly different in parts from the 11th century Arabic translation.Andrea Acri (2012), Yogas≈´tra 1.10, 1.21‚Äì23, and 2.9 in the Light of the Indo-Javanese Dharma PƒÅta√±jala, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Volume 40, Issue 3, pages 259-276 The most complete copy of the Dharma Pata√±jala manuscript is now held at the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin.Andrea Acri (2011), Dharma PƒÅta√±jala: a ≈öaiva scripture from ancient Java: studied in the light of related old Javanese and Sanskrit texts, Doctoral dissertation, Leiden University Institute for AREA Studies (LIAS), Leiden University. By the early 21st century, scholars had located 37 editions of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras published between 1874 and 1992, and 82 different manuscripts, from various locations in India, Nepal, Pakistan, Europe and the United States, many in Sanskrit, some in different North and South Indian languages.Philipp Maas (2008), \\"Descent with Modification\\": The Opening of the PƒÅta√±jalayoga≈õƒÅstra, in ≈öƒÅstrƒÅrambha: Inquiries Into the Preamble in Sanskrit (Editor: Walter Slaje), Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , pages 97-119 The numerous historical variants show that the text was a living document and it was changed as these manuscripts were transmitted or translated, with some ancient and medieval manuscripts marked with \\"corrections\\" in the margin of the pages and elsewhere by unknown authors and for unclear reasons. This has made the chronological study of Yoga school of philosophy a difficult task.Philipp Maas (2010), On the Written Transmission of the PƒÅta√±jalayoga≈õƒÅstra, in \\"From Vasubandhu to Caitanya, Studies in Indian Philosophy and its Textual History\\" (Editors: Johannes Bronkhorst und Karin Preisendanz), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 157-172 Many commentaries have been written on the Yoga Sutras. =Yogabhashya, separate or integral= The Yogabhashya is a commentary on the Yoga Sutras of Pata√±jali, traditionally attributed to the legendary Vedic sage Vyasa who is said to have composed the Mahabharata. This commentary is indispensable for the understanding of the aphoristic and terse Yoga sutras, and the study of the sutras has always referred to the Yogabhashya.Bryant, Edwin F. The Yoga Sutras of Pata√±jali: A New Edition, Translation, and Commentary; Introduction Some scholars see Vyasa as a later 4th or 5th century CE commentator (as opposed to the ancient mythic figure). Other scholars hold that both texts, the sutras and the commentary were written by one person. According to Philipp A. Maas, based on a study of the original manuscripts, Pata√±jali's composition was entitled PƒÅta√±jalayoga≈õƒÅstra (\\"The Treatise on Yoga according to Pata√±jali\\") and consisted of both S≈´tras and BhƒÅ·π£ya. This means that the BhƒÅ·π£ya was in fact Pata√±jali's own work. The practice of writing a set of aphorisms with the author's own explanation was well-known at the time of Pata√±jali, as for example in Vasubandhu's Abhidharmako≈õabhƒÅ·π£ya (that, incidentally, Pata√±jali quotes). These research findings change the historical understanding of the yoga tradition, since they allow us to take the BhƒÅ·π£ya as Pata√±jali's very own explanation of the meaning of his somewhat cryptic s≈´tras. The Yogabhashya states that 'yoga' in the Yoga Sutras has the meaning of 'samadhi'. Another commentary (the Vivarana) by a certain Shankara, confirms the interpretation of yogah samadhih (YBh. I.1): 'yoga' in Pata√±jali's sutra has the meaning of 'integration'.Sankaracarya; Pata√±jali; T. S. Rukmani; Vyasa.

Scholarly opinion is still open on this issue. =Medieval commentaries= Medieval commentaries on the Yoga sutras include: * VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra (900‚Äì980 CE) who composed the commentary Tattvavai≈õƒÅradƒ´. * Bhoja Raja's Raja-Martanda, 11th century. * Vijnanabhiksu's Yogabhashyavarttika (\\"Explanation of the Commentary on the Yoga Sutras\\" of Vyasa). The writer was a Vaishnava philosopher and exegete who tried to harmonize Samkhya and Vedanta and held the Bhedabheda view. * Ramananda Sarasvati's Yogamani-Prabha (16th century). =Modern translations and commentary= Countless commentaries on the Yoga Sutras are available today. The Sutras, with commentaries, have been published by a number of successful teachers of Yoga, as well as by academicians seeking to clarify issues of textual variation. There are also other versions from a variety of sources available on the Internet. The many versions display a wide variation, particularly in translation. The text has not been submitted in its entirety to any rigorous textual analysis, and the contextual meaning of many of the Sanskrit words and phrases remains a matter of some dispute.Christopher Key Chapple; Reading Pata√±jali without Vyasa: A Critique of Four Yoga Sutra Passages, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 62, No. 1 (Spring, 1994), pp. 85-105.

Influence=Indian traditions= Pata√±jali was not the first to write about yoga. Much about yoga is written in the Mok·π£adharma section of the epic MahƒÅbhƒÅrata. The members of the Jaina faith had their own, different literature on yoga, and Buddhist yoga stems from pre-Patanjali sources. Some of the major commentaries on the Yoga Sutras were written between the ninth and sixteenth century. After the twelfth century, the school started to decline, and commentaries on Patanjali's Yoga philosophy were few. By the sixteenth century Patanjali's Yoga philosophy had virtually become extinct. The manuscript of the Yoga Sutras was no longer copied, since few read the text, and it was seldom taught. Popular interest arose in the 19th century, when the practice of yoga according to the Yoga Sutras became regarded as the science of yoga and the \\"supreme contemplative path to self- realization\\" by Swami Vivekananda, following Helena Blavatsky, president of the Theosophical Society. =Western interest= According to David Gordon White, the popularity of the Yoga Sutras is recent, \\"miraculously rehabilitated\\" by Swami Vivekananda after having been ignored for seven centuries. It was with the rediscovery by a British Orientalist in the early 1800s that wider interest in the Yoga Sutras arose in the West. It has become a celebrated text in the West, states White, because of \\"Big Yoga ‚Äì the corporate yoga subculture\\".

It created the province of Manitoba and continued to enforce An Act for the Temporary Government of Rupert's Land and the North- Western Territories when united with Canada upon the absorption of the British territories of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory into Canada on July 15, 1870. The Manitoba Act, 1870 was created by the Parliament of Canada in response to the M√©tis' concerns about the provisional government. The Manitoba Act, 1870 was created with hopes to decrease tension between the Canadian Parliament and the Red River M√©tis. Many negotiations and uprisings came with this Act, some of which are still not settled today. Background Territory transferred to Canada (July 15, 1870) The Province of Manitoba was previously the area settled by the people of the Red River colony. In 1884 Manitoba was organized in many different municipalities. The county of Selkirk, Manitoba happened to be one of the regions that had to be split up for the purpose of creating townships.This area was originally a part of Rupert's Land, which was where the fur traders would do the majority of their hunting and trapping. Rupert's Land was controlled by the Hudson Bay Company, the largest fur trading company of its time. In the late 1860s, the Hudson's Bay Company surrendered the land to the British Crown. This is known as the Rupert's Land Act 1868. This caused severe controversy specifically in the area of the Red River Colony, now known as Manitoba. In the eyes of the British Crown and the Canadian government, the land was seen to be owned by the Hudson Bay Company, even though Indigenous people and M√©tis people lived there. The Canadian government paid ¬£300,000 for Rupert's land. This is the largest land purchase to date for the Canadian government. Once the Canadian government claimed the land from the Hudson Bay Company they began to set up Members of Parliament. William McDougall was appointed to be the Lieutenant Governor of Rupert's Land and the North-West Territory in 1869. In September 1869 Lieutenant Governor William McDougall set out to Red River accompanied by many administrative officers. The M√©tis were not consulted upon these government actions causing a great amount of uproar and distress. Once the M√©tis became aware of this new government attempting to control their territory, they created a provisional government of their own. Louis Riel became the leader for the M√©tis people. Riel had good qualities for this role because he had educational experience from his time spent at school training to be a priest and lawyer, even though he never finished his schooling. Riel's ability to speak both French and English was a huge advantage for him and the M√©tis people because the Red River Colony was a bilingual area. Many of the M√©tis people did not have the ability to understand all the legal action due to the lack of education and experience. = Rise of the M√©tis = Louis Riel and his supporters created a provisional government of their own. This time period is known as the Red River Resistance or Rebellion. Riel and the M√©tis prepared for the arrival of William McDougall and his accompanied administrative officers. Once McDougall and his people arrived at the border of the Red River Colony at the 49th Parallel, they encountered the armed party of the M√©tis, who denied them entry into the colony by creating a barrier. McDougall did not give up his efforts at that point, he stayed in Pembina for approximately a month's time attempting to control the area. The M√©tis actions separated the Canadian party due to their barriers, some were captured and held in jail at Fort Garry. On December 16, McDougall gave up his efforts for the time being. The Canadian government created a new expedition in attempts to establish sovereignty and establish a political solution. The Red River Resistance started out as a non-violent protest and uprising toward the Canadian government. Riel and his people had occupied Fort Garry. A group of Ontario settlers who were opposed to the Riel uprising set out to the fort. This caused 45 men to be incarcerated in the fort by Riel and his people. While these men were incarcerated a major historical event occurred. A man by the name of Thomas Scott was executed while being held captive at the fort on March 4, 1870. This event has been analysed by many historians because it is hotly disputed why Thomas Scott was executed. The execution of Thomas Scott had a great impact on how the Canadian government and its supporters viewed the M√©tis. People were so outraged that when Riel was to make appearances at Parliament he did not attend in fear of getting himself killed. Despite the execution, the Canadian government was still working towards sovereignty. The Manitoba Act, 1870 made the Red River Colony a part of Canada and created the province of Manitoba. Even with the Manitoba Act, 1870 in place, much work was to be done with the settling of land rights. Before land rights were settled Sir John A. MacDonald convinced the British to send a military expedition to Manitoba, led by Colonel Garnet Wolseley. This Red River Expedition became known as the Wolseley expedition. The government portrayed this expedition as non-punitive; however, the militiamen wanted to avenge the death of Thomas Scott. The ensuing chaos and retribution against the M√©tis population was labelled \\"The Reign of Terror\\" by newspapers in eastern Canada and the U.S.A.http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/149078.THE%20REIGN%20OF%20TERROR%20revised.pdfhttps://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/red- river-expedition Many M√©tis fled to Saskatchewan, while Louis Riel fled to the United States at this time. = The Government = A district called Assiniboia (provincial electoral district) became a part of the Canadian Federation for the purpose of receiving 1.4 million acres of land that was specifically for the betterment of the M√©tis nation. John A. Macdonald and George-√âtienne Cartier were both leading figures in the establishment of the Province of Manitoba during 1870. These two men shared personal alliances which made their conjunction a strong one when it came to political movements.  M√©tis List of rights  M√©tis have traditionally been known to come from the Red River Colony. M√©tis are people who come from European and Indigenous backgrounds. In areas such of the Red River Colony, many European trappers would marry and have children with the Indigenous women. M√©tis people have struggled with recognition as a distinct Aboriginal people. M√©tis people are known to be \\"self-identified\\". They are not settlers and they are not fully Indigenous. They are often to be labelled \\"Mixed Blood\\" or \\"half-breeds\\". M√©tis are not identified under the Indian Act of Canada causing a great amount of controversy. Throughout the years the definition of M√©tis have gone through many changes.\`In the 1990s there was a separate definition for \\"Red River M√©tis\\". This term was created for individuals whose families' M√©tis ancestry came from Red River. The Red River M√©tis were very influential in the creation of the Manitoba Act, 1870. They had many rights and requests that they pushed to be fulfilled by the Government of Canada. The following is a list of some of the Red River M√©tis' demands for the Act.Lawrence Barkwell, ‚ÄúMetis Lists of Rights: The Evolution of the List from the First to Fourth Iteration‚Äù (Louis Riel Institute). > Fourth list of rights May 9, 1870 # That this province be governed: ## By a > Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General of Canada; ## By a > Senate; ## By a Legislature chosen by the people with a responsible > ministry. # That, until such time as the increase of the population in this > country entitle us to a greater number, we have two representatives in the > Senate and four in the Commons of Canada. # That in entering the > Confederation the Province of the Northwest be completely free from the > public debt of Canada; and if called upon to assume a part of the said debt > of Canada, that it be only after having received from Canada the same amount > for which the said Province of the Northwest should be held responsible. # > That the annual sum of $80,000 be allotted by the Dominion of Canada to the > Legislature of the Province of the Northwest. # That all properties, rights > and privileges enjoyed by us up to this day be respected, and that the > recognition and settlement of customs, usages and privileges be left > exclusively to the decision of the Local Legislature. # That this country be > submitted to no direct taxation except such as may be imposed by the local > legislature for municipal or other local purposes. # That the schools be > separate, and that the public money for schools be distributed among the > different religious denominations in proportion to their respective > populations according to the system of the Province of Quebec. # That the > determination of the qualifications of members for the parliament of the > province or for the parliament of Canada be left to the local legislature. # > That in this province, with the exception of the Indians, who are neither > civilized nor settled, every man having attained the age of 21 years, and > every foreigner being a British subject, after having resided three years in > this country, and being Possessed of a house, be entitled to vote at the > elections for the members of the local legislature and of the Canadian > Parliament, and that every foreigner other than a British subject, having > resided here during the same period, and being proprietor of a house, be > likewise entitled to vote on condition of taking the oath of allegiance.

What the Act guaranteed = Land = In the M√©tis' favour, the Manitoba Act, 1870 guaranteed that the M√©tis would receive the title for the land that they already farmed and in addition they would receive of farmland for the use of their children. This land was to be divided up through an application process. The Act also set aside land for the M√©tis, with each family receiving scrip, a certificate, saying they owned 96 hectares of land, amount to a total of about 5600 km2. The number of applications that the government was going to receive was greatly underestimated. The 1.4 million acres of land was not enough for the number of applications. The Canadian government began giving money for land, the equivalent value of $1 per acre, which was the current land value at that time. Section 31 reads in part: = Religious and language rights = The Act covered an array of topics. It contained religious and language rights. It allowed the M√©tis to have rights to have denominational schools. The Act stated that laws had to be written and enforced in both French and English, either English or French can be used in the Legislature of Manitoba and any courts established by either Canada or the Province must use both languages. These have led to political controversy such as the Manitoba Schools Question in the nineteenth century, as denominational school rights were curtailed. = Parliament of Canada = The Act also provided for Manitoba to send four members to the House of Commons of Canada and two members to the Senate of Canada.  Controversies  Since the Manitoba Act, 1870 was put into action it has been adjusted and under review multiple times. Historian D. N. Sprague notes that the land assigned to the M√©tis in the Manitoba Act, 1870 was later revised by government laws, which took land away from the M√©tis. In order to receive scrip for children living or deceased, proof of birth in Manitoba prior to 1871 was required. Proof could be in the form of a baptismal or death certificate from the church, or a letter from an employer such as the Hudson's Bay Company. The legislature also enacted English-only laws, which were later found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case Reference re Manitoba Language Rights (1985). The Manitoba Act, 1870, and Section 31 in particular, was also used in the 2013 Supreme Court case Manitoba M√©tis Federation v. Canada and Manitoba.Constitution Act, 1982, s. 52 and Schedule, Item 2. = The Manitoba School Crisis = Most clauses in the Manitoba Act, 1870 were agreed upon apart from one. Topics such as language and religion were safeguarded by the government and recognized by the Canadian court system. The clause on the right to English and French in educational systems was not safeguarded and was instead disputed amongst political figures. Notable people such as: Honourable Mr. Chauveau and Liberal leader Mr. Mackenzie had opposing views on the clause that would affect the right to education in French or English. = Section 31 = Section 31 required the government to provide a tract of land to each M√©tis child upon reaching the age of 21 years, from a notional pool of 1.4 million acres of land appropriated for this purpose. M√©tis families were promised a large amount of land through the Manitoba Act, 1870. The government, however, did not grant the land until the land had been surveyed. The Act, therefore, would ensure this process. However, the Canadian government later realized that the amount of land that was promised fell short compared to the number of M√©tis children entitled. This issue is what changed the process of receiving land by lottery draw through the Land Titles Office to money scrips. The government decided to allot money scrips in place of land, which could only be provided for the purchase of lands in government- owned parts of the Northwest Territories. In subsequent legal case regarding Section 31, the Court claimed that ‚Äúthere was no request for, expectation of or consideration by Canada to create a M√©tis homeland or land base.‚ÄùManitoba M√©tis Federation v. Canada (Attorney General) et al., 2010 MBCA 71 at 238. = Validity of the Manitoba Act, 1870 = Following the enactment of the Manitoba Act, 1870, questions arose whether the federal Parliament had the constitutional authority to create new provinces by ordinary federal statute. To eliminate any uncertainty on this point, the Imperial Parliament enacted the Constitution Act, 1871, which confirmed that the federal Parliament had the power to establish new provinces and provide for their constitutions.Constitution Act, 1871, 34‚Äì35 Vict., c. 28 (U.K.), s. 2.

The first stories were asserted to take place in the same year as they were published, but in a world with an alternate history that is different from our own and that is governed by the rules of magic rather than the rules of physics. Despite the magical trappings, the Lord Darcy stories play fair as whodunnits; magic is never used to \\"cheat\\" a solution, and indeed, the mundane explanation is often obscured by the leap to assume a magical cause. Title character Lord Darcy is the Chief Forensic Investigator or Chief Criminal Investigator for the Duke of Normandy (Prince Richard, the brother of the king), and sometime Special Investigator for the High Court of Chivalry. An Englishman, he lives in Rouen, but spends very little time there. We are told that he speaks Anglo-French with an English accent, and that he speaks several languages and dialects fluently. His full name is never given; he is always referred to by his title as the Lord of Arcy (i.e., Lord d'Arcy or Lord Darcy), even by his friends. He dresses in the style of an English aristocrat. He thinks of himself as English and yet Arcy seems to be a French place name. How he comes to be addressed as a \\"Lord\\" is never explained, though he seems deferential when dealing with other Peers such as Dukes, Counts, and a Marquis. In Too Many Magicians Darcy is said to be a cousin of the Marquis of London. There are two conflicting reports of Lord Darcy's age. In \\"The Muddle of the Woad\\" he's described as a few years older than the King, who's ten years older than the Duke of Normandy, who was 19 years old in \\"The Eyes Have It\\", which is set in 1963. This places Lord Darcy's date of birth around 1931. However, he's described in \\"The Spell of War\\" as an 18-year-old lieutenant in the autumn of the War of '39, which would make him about ten years older. His assistant is Master Sean O'Lochlainn, a sorcerer who undertakes magical forensic work. Master Sean is highly proud of Irish magic and its superiority to those of other countries (especially to Polish magic). Works Too Many Magicians is the only Lord Darcy novel written by Randall Garrett: it first appeared in Analog magazine from August to November 1966 and was issued in book form by Doubleday in 1967. This was followed by two short story collections: Murder and Magic (1979), and Lord Darcy Investigates (1981), containing stories that had appeared in Analog, Fantastic and other magazines. Garrett's extended illness and death prevented him from writing more Lord Darcy tales as he had intended. Two more Lord Darcy novels, Ten Little Wizards (1988), and A Study in Sorcery (1989), were written by Garrett's friend Michael Kurland after Garrett's death. The two titles were manifestly modeled on those of famous detective novels by, respectively, Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle. This is similar to the way that Too Many Magicians was modeled on a famous novel by Rex Stout (whose Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have counterparts in the novel's universe in the Marquis de London and his Special Investigator, Lord Bontriomphe). In the eleventh chapter of Ten Little Wizards, Kurland sets Lord Darcy's rank in the peerage as a Baron. =Short stories= # \\"The Eyes Have It\\" (1964) # \\"A Case of Identity\\" (1964) # \\"The Muddle of the Woad\\" (1965) # \\"A Stretch of the Imagination\\" (1973) # \\"Matter of Gravity\\" (1974) # \\"The Ipswich Phial\\" (1976) # \\"The Sixteen Keys\\" (1976) # \\"The Bitter End\\" (1978) # \\"The Napoli Express\\" (1979) # \\"The Spell of War\\" (1979) =Novel= * Too Many Magicians (1967, ) =Novels by Michael Kurland= * Ten Little Wizards (1988, ) * A Study in Sorcery (1989, ) Also: Michael Kurland's 1969 novel The Unicorn Girl features protagonists who jump into a series of alternate timelines ‚Äî and one of the timelines they land in is Lord Darcy's.

Darcy's world=Magic= Magic is a scientific discipline, codified in the fourteenth century by Saint Hilary Robert, much involved with higher mathematics and possessed of theoretical and experimental underpinnings as sophisticated as those of our physics and chemistry. Licensed Sorcerers, possessed of the Talent and properly trained, achieve a wide range of effects. Healing by the laying on of hands is effective and a commonplace treatment for disease and injury; thanks to the efficacy of the Healers, it is common for people to live to the age of 100 and not rare for people to live to 125. Black magic is not a categorically different type of magic, but a matter of symbolism and intentat least in the Anglo-French sphere, as the Kingdom of Italy requests extradition of a woman for black magic when her actual offense was no more than unlicensed magic. However, the effect of symbolism and intent can be substantial; one character, a Witch-Smeller, is capable of detecting its effects on the black magician and his victims. Although magic is a central part of all the stories, none of the murders Lord Darcy investigates are directly caused by magic. All the homicides are committed by mundane means. =Social structure= France and the British Isles are combined into a single state as the Anglo-French Empire, whilst Russia, Italy, and Germany continue as loose collections of small states. Society is stratifiedmost important government positions are held by nobles, who dispense justice and still maintain private soldiers. The Church is powerful and a central component of everyone's life (there had never been a Reformation, or it took a very different form, as some of the worst abuses of the late-Medieval/Renaissance Catholic Church seem to have been eliminated or minimized). However, serfdom is as dead as in our own world, and the rights of the common people appear to be as well protected as in our world's Western democracies, if in different ways. Anglo-French regard themselves as fortunate in comparison to the subjects of the Polish King, who are reported to be living under a terrible tyranny. The characters expressing this are all living in the Anglo-French countries, but include a Polish refugee, whom the Italian government accused of black magic, and who is compelled to spy for Poland by a threat to her uncle. =Education= Little is mentioned of education, although Oxford continues. Lord Darcy is mentioned as being a graduate of the fictional Magog College (1954). A fictional St. Thomas' Academy is also mentioned. =Technology= Technology and physical sciences have suffered somewhat with the emphasis on magic. Physics has not been codified as a science; the one example of an investigator into the discipline is an eccentric on a par with the members of our own Flat Earth Society. Most mechanical devices are approximately those of our Victorian era. Characters travel by horse-drawn carriage and steam train and employ revolving pistols and bolt action rifles; buildings are illuminated with gas lights. An electric torch, with magical parts, is \\"a fantastic device, a secret of His Majesty's Government.\\" Messages can be sent by an electrical device called the \\"teleson\\", but the principles by which it operates are not well understood, and the technology to lay teleson lines underwater, or over water, has not yet been developed, so it is impossible to communicate across the Channel. Food is sometimes preserved in iceboxes; a magical \\"food preservator\\" has been invented, although preservators are expensive and rare because the stasis spell they employ is expensive to maintain, requiring the services of a specialist Journeyman or Master-grade magician. Sorcery is commonly employed in murder investigations, in much the same fashion as forensic science in our own world. Medical technology is not as advanced as in our world, because Healers are so effective, indeed the use of drugs with a genuine but non-magical benefit (\\"may cover a wound with moldy bread... or give a patient with heart trouble a tea brewed of foxglove\\") is regarded as little more than superstition. =International situation= The Anglo-French Empire was established by the Plantagenets, which dynasty has continued to rule (and which continues to use the Palace of Westminster as a royal residence, with Parliament far weaker than in our timeline). Richard I returned to England after being wounded at the siege of Chaluz, but recovered and ruled well, whilst John Lackland never held the throne and died in exile. Richard then went on to a decisive victory in the Anglo-French War which in our history King John lost. He dethroned the Capetian Dynasty and made himself and his successors Kings of France as well as of England, both kingdoms ruled from London, while Paris was left into the 20th century a provincial town, brooding over its lost glory. The Duchy of Normandy remained attached to the English crown and was never separated from it. Richard died in 1219 and was succeeded by his nephew Arthur whose reign was remembered as a Golden Age and sometimes confused in the popular imagination with that of King Arthur. Seven-hundred-fifty years later the present king is \\"John IV, by the Grace of God, King and Emperor of England, France, Scotland, Ireland [all the Anglo-French Empire], New England [North America], and New France [South America]; Defender of the Faith, et cetera\\". To judge by the Irishman who has a central role in the stories, the Irish in this timeline do not feel particularly oppressed under the Anglo-French throne and have no inclination to become independent. Irish history here seems to have been spared traumatic periods of foreign colonisation and dispossession and since everybody is Catholic, this Ireland has no problems of rival religious-ethnic communities. Moreover, the Irish are considered especially skilled in Magic - a source of upwards social mobility and prestige. The king is also Holy Roman Emperor,The Point of Divergence when this timeline diverges from ours is just prior to the accession of Frederick II - in our history one of the most important and powerful of Emperors. The information provided by Garret is not detailed enough to determine whether the implications of Richard the Lionheart's survival and takeover of France were enough the prevent his accession in the alternate timeline, and when did the Plantagenets gain possession of the Imperial title. exercising loose sovereignty over the many small German and Italian states. However, his actual exercise of sovereignty is limited by the ability of German states to call upon the Poles for help; the chronologically first Lord Darcy story (though not the first written) takes place during a military confrontation between Anglo-French and Polish forces on the soil of Bavaria. In Italy the King-Emperor is more of a Constitutional monarch, with an Italian Parliament seemingly holding much more power than the one in London (in a story set in Italy, a local policeman emphasizes that his oath of office is to the Parliament rather than the King). There is no mention, however, of whether the parliament is appointed or elected, and by whom. Italy being united implies that the Catholic Church was, like in our history, deprived at some time of its Temporal power over the city of Rome and its environs, but there is no mention of when and how this happened. Poland is a major power and the chief rival of the Anglo-French, and the two exist in a situation of Cold War; some of the stories are spy thrillers, where Lord Darcy is pitted against Polish agents and takes on some of the attributes of James Bond (with some magic ingredients added, such as a spell used to make him fall madly in love with a beautiful female Polish agent). Hungary is part of the Polish Empire (the University of Buda-Pest is mentioned as one of Poland's major institutes of learning), and the empire seems to extend southwards into the Balkans. It is stated that Kiev is part of the Polish Empire, and most of the Ukrainian steppe. The Russias are no more than a set of fractious statelets, which might unify in the face of Polish aggression but as yet have failed to do so (it had been close to that situation in some periods of our own historysee Polish-Muscovite War (1605‚Äì1618)). The main strategy of the Anglo-French is to bottle up the Poles and deny them access to the world's oceans. There is mention of a war in the 1940s (roughly equivalent to World War II, but of a much more limited extent) in which the Polish Navy was decisively beaten. Since then, an alliance with the Scandinavians at the exit from the Baltic and with the Roumelians (Byzantines) at the exit from the Black Sea denies passage to Polish warships though they try to circumvent this blockade and build an ocean-going navy with the help of some African states. As noted, the Byzantine Empire continues to exist and is, at least at times, an Anglo-French ally, but is a minor power corresponding to our Greece, its main importance being the control of the strategic Dardanelles. The Osmanlis rule a realm beyond it, apparently never having spread beyond Anatolia. The Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon never united into a single Spanish realm and were never of much account, and Southern Spain is still predominantly Muslim (one story features a suave Muslim from Granada residing in London). Since the Point of Departure which set this alternate history off is the survival of Richard the Lion Heart until 1219 and his success in eliminating the Capetians and making himself King of France, presumably in this history The Fourth Crusade of 1204 which fatally crippled the Byzantine Empire never took place. And with John Lackland never taking the throne, he never had a chance to behave tyrannically as a king, and therefore there was no rebellion culminating in the Magna Cartawhich may (very partially) explain the lack of any democratic institutions in this 20th century. (By which Garrett may have meant to imply that the villains of history sometimes have their uses.) Mexico (Mechicoe in Anglo-French) is still ruled by Aztecs, headed by the Christianised descendants of Montezuma, having been taken into the empire's high nobility and possessing considerable autonomy. North America (the whole of which is called \\"New England\\") is in the process of being settled by Europeans, but the process is far less advanced than in our history, with Native American tribes in the 1960s still able to offer significant resistance to whites encroaching on their land. However, there is also mention of thriving tobacco plantations, which seems to indicate that the equivalent of the US South is more thickly settled than the North. Mention is made of the first European ships reaching the shores of new England in 1569.\\"Too Many Magicians\\" Little is mentioned of \\"New France\\" (South America) beyond a single mention of its jungles being a punitive posting to unruly soldiers, from which it is clear that native inhabitants are far from completely subdued there, either. There are only few references to Africa. Lord Darcy's father, who was an army \\"coronel\\" (i.e. colonel), is mentioned as having fought in a war at Sudan (which might be not exactly the same as our timeline's state of this name). In West Africa, black states are mentioned as maintaining their independence, keeping a balance between the Anglo-French and the Poles, and possessing enough technology to equip modern warships. The impression given is that Africa was not as heavily touched by colonialism as in our timeline. (Presumably, because the Anglo-French have a whole continent at their disposal on the other side of the Atlantic, and they do their best to bar Polish access.) Allusions=Allusions in the Lord Darcy stories= As in many of Garrett's other writings, he takes every opportunity to insert subtle, or otherwise, allusions to other fiction  in these stories there are many echoes of other classic, or otherwise, detectives. For example, in Too Many Magicians there is a cameo appearance by the Marquis de London, who looks and talks like Nero Wolfe, an identification reinforced by his sidekick Lord Bontriomphe (whose name is a literal French translation of \\"Goodwin\\") and his cook Frederique Bruleur (corresponding to Wolfe's cook Fritz Brenner). The title, furthermore, echoes Wolfe novels Too Many Cooks (1938), Too Many Women (1947) and Too Many Clients (1960). That novel also contains a number of punning references to The Man from U.N.C.L.E.. More subtly, the murder victim, a famous Master Sorcerer named Sir James Zwinge, is named for Randall James Zwinge, better known as the stage magician James Randi; and the head of the magician's guild is Sir Lyon Gandolphus Gray, whose name is partially a reference to Gandalf from J. R. R. Tolkien and partially that of fantasy author Lyon Sprague de Camp, and whose appearance as described partakes of both men's appearance. In the short story \\"The Bitter End\\", a bumbling Sergeant-at-Arms is named Cougair Chasseur, a clear reference to Inspector Clouseau of the Pink Panther movies. And in several stories there is a secret agent, Sir James le Lein (le lien is French for \\"bond\\"; a clear James Bond reference). The story \\"A Case Of Identity\\" also contains two subtle references to contract bridge, including a magic spell for establishing identity called the Jacoby transfer which requires blood from \\"at least two hearts.\\" This is an allusion to a bridge convention known as transfer bidding, which attempts to make the stronger, concealed hand the declarer, and always results in a contract of at least Two Hearts. Also in the story, the murder victim is described as having been struck with a long club, because \\"according to the Kaplan‚ÄìSheinwold test, a short club cannot have been used.\\" In the Kaplan‚ÄìSheinwold bidding system, making an opening bid of \\"one club\\" when holding two or fewer club cards-a \\"short club\\"-is not permitted. The story \\"The Sixteen Keys\\" contains a reference to the \\"von Horst‚ÄìShea\\" process, whereby a person can maintain a lifelong youthful appearance, at the expense of a much shorter life, and a sudden dissolution at the end of it. This is done by a magical \\"balancing\\" of the body's processes, so that no one part of the body wears out before any other. This is a clear reference to the name of, and events in, Oliver Wendell Holmes' poem, \\"The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay\\". In two stories, Darcy encounters a magical reference to E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's Lensman series: King's Messengers, couriers who identify themselves with a be- gemmed badge that glows red for its owner, and only its owner. The spell on the badge is said to be invented by magician Sir Edward Elmer in the Thirties, and to have remained secret ever since. \\"E.E.\\" was short for Edward Elmer, and the badges are a reference to a device which preceded the Lens which gave the Lensmen their name. Darcy himself resembles Sherlock Holmes in a number of ways. However, unlike Watson, whose primary purpose was to allow Holmes to explain his deductions, Sean O'Lochlainn is more of a counterpart than a foil. The relationship between the two is very similar to that of the suave, analytical Napoleon Solo (Darcy) and technical expert Illya Kuryakin (O'Lochlainn). Sometime Garrett collaborator Michael Kurland (who would himself write later Lord Darcy works, with the permission of Garrett's estate) appears as Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Coeur-Terre in Too Many Magicians; and in \\"A Case of Identity\\" the Marquise of Rouen, worried about her missing husband, is described as drinking herself into a stupor on \\"the best brandy, the St. Courlande-Michele.\\" Similarly several books feature a magical theorist named Sir Thomas Leseaux, a play on another of Garrett's friends, the author and stage magician T. A. Waters; indeed, during the events of The Unicorn Girl Lesaux and Waters come face-to-face. The strong relation between Lord Darcy and Master Sean O'Lochlainn in some ways recalls that between Dorothy L. Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey and his servant Mervyn Bunter. In both cases there is a successful detection team composed of a nobleman and a commoner, with a built-in social hierarchy tempered by a strong and long-lasting personal friendship; in both cases, the commoner partner is an extremely capable and competent person, highly appreciated by his socially-superior noble partner; and in both cases, the partnership started as a wartime relationship between an officer and an NCO, and carried over into civilian life. Garrett's debt to Sayers and Lord Peter Wimsey perhaps strayed over the line in \\"A Matter Of Gravity\\" in which the method of murder was essentially a direct copy of the method in Sayers' \\"Busman's Honeymoon.\\" In addition, in the story \\"The Muddle of the Woad,\\" the surnames of the men employed in the cabinetmaker's shop are the surnames of characters in Sayers' The Nine Tailors. The story \\"The Napoli Express\\", a mystery taking place on board a socially-prestigious train travelling from London to Naples, is clearly related to the considerable subgenre of works whose plots take place on board the Orient Express. =Allusions to the Lord Darcy stories in other works= Kurland's later short story The Rite Stuff (first published in anthology Sorceror's Tales, 2004) features some of the same magical concepts specified in the Lord Darcy stories, but set on an Earth where T. Lesaux discovered the laws of magic in the nineteenth century and where society has developed a more superstitious concept of magic that doubts the credibility of forensic sorcerers like protagonist Dr. Jonathan Stryk. The 'alternate history' elements include attenuated scientific development (the internal combustion engine does not seem to have been invented), and references to Daniel Webster, Huey Long and Eleanor Roosevelt as former Presidents of the United States. Elizabeth Bear, whose novel New Amsterdam is set in a (quite different) alternate timeline where magic works, acknowledged her debt to the Darcy stories by giving her protagonist, a forensic sorceress, the name Abigail Irene Garrett. In David Weber's Honorverse novel Mission of Honor, a character is reading \\"a novel about the psychically gifted detective Garrett Randall by the highly popular Darcy Lord.\\" One of the many alternate history timelines visited in Michael Flynn's The Forest of Time is one in which \\"The Angevin Kings still rule\\". Flynn's traveler is generously hosted by a Goodman de Veres and his wife, living on the site of Philadelphia, and hears from his hosts about \\"what sounds like scientific magic\\" whose practice is widespread in this world. The traveler, versed in the science of our 20th Century, is skeptical and suspects this reputed magic to be \\"superstition or mass delusion\\", but is too polite to share this skepticism with his hosts - and anyway, he must soon depart. =Similarity with Times Without Number= Though having a completely different historical origin, Lord Darcy's 20th century has many similarities with that of John Brunner's Times Without Number. In both there is a Catholic Empire based in London and ruling the British Islands, France and the entire Western Hemisphere (with Christianized Native Americans accepted into its aristocracy). And in both works the Empire depicted is monarchial and conservative, without any trace of democracy, but still relatively benevolent; locked in a decades-long cold war with an Eastern European rival; technologically backward compared to our world, but still possessing a key field of knowledge (magic, time travel) unknown to our 20th century.

In 1716 the castle was forfeited to the Crown following the Earl of Mar's leadership of the 1715 Jacobite rising.Alex Inkson McConnochie, Alexander Inkson McConnochie, J G Murray, The Royal Dee: A Description of the River from the Wells to the Sea, 1898, Jolly Publishers, Scotland, 161 pages The castle and lands were purchased by John Farquharson, 9th Laird of Invercauld but the building was left in ruins until 1748 when it was leased to the government at a fee of ¬£14 per year, now to serve as a garrison for Hanoverian troops. Rebuilding started under the command of John Adam, Master Mason to the Board of Ordnance. In 1831 the military garrison was withdrawn and the castle returned to the Farquharson clan. Restoration to provide a family home began under the 12th Laird of Invercauld who entertained Queen Victoria there when she attended the Braemar Gatherings in the grounds of the Castle.

The central tower enfolds a round stair tower and is built of granite covered with harl. The main entrance retains an original iron yett, and many of the windows are protected by heavy iron grilles. On the ground floor are stone-vaulted rooms which contained the guardroom, ammunition store and original kitchen. These are built out into the salients of the outer wall, and in Victorian times a second kitchen was added adjoining the staff rooms. In the floor of a passage, an iron grill provided access to the Laird's Pit, a dark hole used as a dungeon. On each of the upper floors a large room and a small room occupied the two arms of the tower. On the first floor are the Dining Room and Morning Room, whilst on the floor above is the Laird's Day Room, entered by a curved door. Opposite is the Rose Room, and between the two is a small bathroom installed in 1901. In the main wing at this level is the Drawing Room, containing graffiti incised on the window-shutters by government troops. The words \\"John Chestnut, Sergeant, 1797\\" can be clearly seen. On the third floor is the Four Poster Bedroom, whilst on the fourth floor lie the Ladies Guest Bedroom, Gentlemans Guest Bedroom and the Principal Bedroom.

So fond of the chapel was he, that he even bade \\"trespassers and sacrilegious persons take warning, for I will proceed against them with the utmost rigour of the law, and, after my death and burial, I will endeavour, in all ghostly ways, to protect and haunt its hallowed walls\\".Hine, Reginald L. The History of Hitchin, Vol II page 38 (1929, Allen and Unwin (London)) Contrary to popular belief Hine is not buried at Minsden. His body was cremated at Golders Green (London) and his ashes were subsequently scattered at the chapel. His family erected a memorial stone at the site, which was subsequently re-laid in its current grave-like horizontal position by them after it was damaged by vandals in the early 1980s.Whitmore, Richard The Ghosts of Reginald Hine (2007, Mattingley Press (Hitchin)) In 1907, Thomas William Latchmore, a local professional photographer and friend of Hine, took a photograph that supposedly showed a ghostly monk at the Chapel. Rumours of paranormal activity first appeared around this time. The haunting most frequently reported is that of a single monk climbing stairs (which no longer exist) to the north-east area of the chapel; this is said to occur at midnight on Halloween. Other reported experiences include the sighting of a glowing cross on the wall, and the hearing of distant music or the ringing of the stolen bells. Legends also exist of a lost tunnel built during the time of the Crusades that extended to nearby Temple Dinsley, and another of a murdered nun. In an interview given in 1930 to Elliott O'Donnell, a well-known contemporary writer on occult matters, Latchmore finally admitted that his 'Minsden Ghost' photograph was a hoax. He explained that the picture was the deliberate result of an experiment in the techniques of double exposures, a subject that interested him greatly at the time. Although Latchmore refused to disclose the identity of the individual who had posed as the ghostly figure, it seems likely that it was a young man well known for practical jokes, Latchmore's good friend Reginald Hine. Hine re-published the photograph in 1929 in his History of Hitchin but never admitted it was a fake nor his own part in it.Whitmore, Richard The Ghosts of Reginald Hine pp113-116 Paranormal investigator Peter Underwood once spent a night there in the late 1940s, during which he claimed to have heard the sound of distant music and to have seen a white glowing cross on one of the walls, which disappeared and then reappeared, although he suggested \\"it could possibly have been a trick of the moonlight, as a full moon was shining down through the trees at the time\\". The iconic arch of Minsden Chapel finally fell in 2008 due to time and erosion from the elements. In 2017, it was reported that the Church Commissioners for England, who own the site, were intending selling it to a \\"surrounding landowner\\", sparking fears that the public could lose access to the site.

It is located near Kemnay in the Aberdeenshire region of Scotland. The castle stands in over of landscaped grounds, woodland and farmland which includes a walled kitchen garden of the 19th century. There is archaeological evidence of an older square tower dating from around 1400 or 1500 within the current construction. The castle is a Category A listed building and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. Construction A rear view of the castle. Location of Castle Fraser within Aberdeenshire. Originally known as Muchall-in-Mar, construction of the elaborate, five-storey Z-plan castle was begun in 1575 by the 6th Laird of Fraser, Michael Fraser, on the basis of an earlier tower, and was completed in 1636. A panel on the northern side of the castle is signed \\"I Bel\\", believed to be the mark of the master mason John Bell of Midmar, the castle is a joint creation over several decades with another master mason of this period, Thomas Leiper.Castle Fraser Taken from \\"Aberdeenshire: Donside and Strathbogie - An Illustrated Architectural Guide\\", by Ian Shepherd, 2006. Published by the Rutland Press Castle Fraser is contemporary with other nearby castles: Craigievar Castle, Crathes Castle and Midmar Castle which are also believed to have been designed by the Bell family of master masons. The castle was modernised in a classical style in the late 18th century, with a new entrance inserted in the south side and sash windows throughout. This work was supervised by Elyza Fraser, the lady laird, assisted by Mary Bristow. Elyza was also responsible for the landscaping of the grounds, sweeping away the remains of the original formal gardens and orchards, and for the construction of the impressive octagonal stable block. The interiors of the building were entirely reconstructed again between 1820 and 1850, by Charles Fraser, using the architects John Smith and William Burn. The Library is a fine example of John Smith's regency style with Tudor detailing. Many of William Burn's more extravagant gothic designs for the most important rooms were not carried out, although a gothic style pipe organ was installed (now removed to Kemnay Church). The rear courtyard. External works during this period included the construction of the twin gatehouses (still extant), and a grand domed stair and access corridors with loggias in the courtyard (removed). The castle was partially restored by the new owners around 1950. The architect and antiquary Dr William Kelly supervised the removal of much 19th-century work to reveal the earlier fabric. Castle Fraser retains the atmosphere of a family home and still contains the original contents, including Fraser family portraits, furniture and collections. The evocative interiors represent all periods of the castle's history, from the Medieval stone vaulted Great Hall to the Regency Dining Room. Ownership Portrait of Theodora Mackenzie Fraser. Castle Fraser was built as the home of the Frasers of Muchalls, later Frasers of Castle Fraser. The castle was passed down through the Lords Fraser, the Frasers of Inverallochy and then the Mackenzie family who took the name Mackenzie Fraser. In 1897 the last male Fraser of the direct line, Frederick Mackenzie Fraser, died childless. In 1921 his widow, Theodora, sold the castle due to the lack of a suitable heir and mounting financial difficulties. The buyer was Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray. The Pearson family restored the castle as a shooting lodge and gave it to the National Trust for Scotland in 1976.Scottish Castles Photo Library - Castle Fraser, Aberdeenshire Accessed 21 June 2008 The Trust opens the castle to visitors from Easter to October. The grounds and walled gardens are open year round. It can be hired for weddings, dinners, conferences and corporate events.

For centuries it was the seat of the chief of Clan Irvine. The place-name Drum is derived from Gaelic druim, 'ridge'.Drum Castle The site is located approximately northeast of Banchory and west of Peterculter. The property is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland and is open to the public. History The original 13th-century tower of Drum Castle has been suggested as the work of medieval architect Richard Cementarius, who built the Bridge of Don in Old Aberdeen. It is believed to be one of the three oldest tower houses in Scotland (and notably unaltered). A large wing was added in 1619 by the 9th laird, and further alterations were made during the Victorian era. The castle and its grounds were granted to William de Irwyn in 1325 by Robert the Bruce, and remained in the possession of Clan Irvine until 1975. William de Irwyn (of the Irvings of Bonshaw clan) was armour bearer/secretary (and neighbor) to King Robert the Bruce. In June 1636 Sir Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum and his wife Magdalene Scrimgeour were censured for harbouring the outlaw Gilderoy.William Fraser, The Chiefs of Grant, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1883), pp. 62-3. Drum played a role in the Covenanting Rebellion (as did nearby Muchalls Castle) leading to its being attacked and sacked three times. The castle in 1829 (by John Preston Neale) In the 19th century it was the home of Alexander Forbes Irvine of Drum FRSE (1818-1892). He had inherited the estate in 1861, on the death of his father. In 1875/1876, he arranged for a restoration of the courtyard, and the addition of an arched entrance and angle tower.Drum CastleDrum Castle He was also partly responsible for a restoration of the chapel.Drum Castle Chapel There was an older church located here; it was modified to create the chapel in the 1500s and 1600s. In 1857, the west window was enlarged and the cross was added; a new roof was also installed and some restoration of the interior was completed.Drum Castle ChapelDrum Castle Chapel The site was once served by Drum railway station on the Deeside Railway. Service was discontinued in 1951. Recent status The castle has been a Category-A Listed property since 1987. The report states that the agreement with the National Trust was made in 1964 by Mr H.Q. Forbes Irvine, the 24th Laird, and that the agreement came into force in 1976, after 650 years of ownership by the Irvine Lairds. The summary states that the tower was built in 1280‚Äì1300, that the Jacobean Wing was added in 1619 and that modificants were made ca. 1800, 1840 and 1875.

Roman legions marched from Raedykes to nearby Normandykes as they sought higher ground evading the bogs of Red Moss and other low-lying mosses associated with the Burn of Muchalls. That march used the Elsick Mounth, one of the ancient trackways crossing the Grampian Mountains; the situation of the Elsick Mounth terminating at a ford to the River Dee is thought to have been instrumental in the strategic siting of Drum Castle as a point to monitor traffic on the Elsick Mounth lying west of Netherley.

This harled castle was built by the Burnetts of Leys and was held in that family for almost 400 years. The castle and grounds are owned and managed by the National Trust for Scotland and are open to the public. History Crathes sits on land given as a gift to the Burnetts of Ley family by King Robert the Bruce in 1323. Crathes castle In the 14th and 15th century the Burnett of Leys built a fortress of timbers on an island they made in the middle of a nearby bog. This method of fortification, known as a crannog, was common in the Late Middle Ages. Construction of the current tower house of Crathes Castle was begun in 1553 but delayed several times during its construction due to political problems during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. It was completed in 1596 by Alexander Burnett of Leys, and an additional wing added in the 18th century. Alexander Burnett, who completed the construction of Crathes, began a new project, the early 17th- century reconstruction of nearby Muchalls Castle. That endeavour was completed by his son, Sir Thomas Burnett. Crathes Castle served as the ancestral seat of the Burnetts of Leys until Sir James Burnett, 13th Baronet gave it to the National Trust for Scotland in 1951. A fire damaged portions of the castle (in particular the Queen Anne wing) in 1966. Another historically important structure in this region linked to the Burnett of Leys family is Monboddo House. Interior The castle contains a significant collection of portraits, and intriguing original Scottish renaissance painted ceilings survive in several Jacobean rooms: the Chamber of the Muses, the Chamber of Nine Worthies and the Green Lady's Room. Garden and grounds The castle estate contains of woodlands and fields, including nearly of walled garden. Within the walled garden are gravel paths with surrounding specimen plants mostly in herbaceous borders. Many of the plants are labelled with taxonomic descriptions. There is also a grass croquet court at a higher terraced level within the walled garden. Ancient topiary hedges of Irish yew dating from 1702 separate the gardens into eight themed areas. Crathes and its grounds are open to tourists throughout the year. A visitors centre provides information about the castle and its surroundings. There is a tea shop on site and a car park for any size of car. Crathes Castle Mesolithic calendar In 2004 excavations at the castle uncovered a series of pits believed to date from about 10,000 years ago. The find was analysed in 2013 and is considered to be the world's oldest known lunar calendar dating from 8000 BC to about 4000 BC. This dating would make the structure up to five thousand years older than previously recorded time-measuring monuments in Mesopotamia. The site in Warren Field was identified from arial photography when unusual crop marks were seen by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.

The vertical flute is contrasted with the \\"cross flute\\" (or \\"transverse flute\\") and \\"globular flute\\", and in stricter usage may refer only to the first category above (Marcuse 1975, 187). Rim-blown vertical flutes include the Jiahu flute, the xiao, the danso, the kaval, the ney, the quena, and the shakuhachi. The most familiar ducted vertical flutes are the recorder, tin whistle, and tabor pipe. One historical variety has a slightly tapered (decreasing diameter) bore with 6 tone holes on the top side. A dorsal thumb hole is absent. It sometimes has a small foot section with a single key. The range is a little more than two octaves and the common keynote is \\"D\\" major. The instrument is often mistaken for a recorder with keynote C, but. like the tin whistle and tabor pipe, relies on overblowing to change registers instead of pinching open a thumbhole, recorder style, to \\"cancel\\" the fundamental harmonic (Bessarabov 1941, p62 ‚Äì p63).

It was the seat of Clan Sempill and the Forbes family resided here for 350 years until 1963, when the property was given to the National Trust for Scotland by William Forbes-Sempill, 19th Lord Sempill in the 1960s. The setting is among scenic rolling foothills of the Grampian Mountains. The contrast of its massive lower storey structure to the finely sculpted multiple turrets, gargoyles and high corbelling work create a classic fairytale appearance. History An excellent example of the original Scottish Baronial architecture, the great seven-storey castle was completed in 1626 by the Aberdonian merchant William Forbes, ancestor of the Forbes baronets of Craigievar and brother of the Bishop of Aberdeen, Patrick Forbes of Corse Castle. Forbes purchased the partially completed structure from the impoverished Mortimer family in the year 1610. He arranged for the continued construction, completing it in 1625 or 1626. Forbes was nicknamed \\"Danzig Willy\\", a reference to his shrewd international trading success with the Baltic states. Some used the nickname \\"Willy the Merchant\\", also based on the substantial profits he made while \\"merchandising at Dantzick\\", according to one source. Craigievar Castle in autumn in 2006 Location of Craigievar Castle within the former Grampian Region Location of Aberdeenshire William's son became a Baronet of Nova Scotia by Charles I and this title is now extant. The Forbes Baronetcy, of Craigievar in the County of Aberdeen, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 20 April 1630 for William Forbes. He was also a descendant of Hon. Patrick Forbes, third son of the second Lord Forbes, and the nephew of the first Baronet of the 1628 creation. The fourth Baronet represented Aberdeenshire in the House of Commons. The 5th Baronet married the Hon. Sarah Sempill, eldest daughter of Hugh Sempill, 12th Lord Sempill. Their grandson, the eighth Baronet, succeeded as seventeenth Lord Sempill in 1884 (see the Lord Sempill for earlier history of this title). The titles remained united until the death of his grandson, the 19th Lord and tenth Baronet, in 1965. Designed in the L plan, as was Muchalls Castle, which is located in the same region, Craigievar is noted for its exceptionally crafted plasterwork ceilings. Craigevar, Muchalls Castle and Glamis Castle are generally considered to have the three finest ceilings in Scotland. The Clan Forbes family was close friends of the Clan Burnett of Leys, who built both Crathes Castle and Muchalls Castle. The ceilings feature plaster figures of the Nine Worthies and other family emblems. =19th century= By the early 1800s, the tower had fallen into decay. Sir John Forbes had considered demolishing the tower and consulted the Aberdeen city architect John Smith who advised against that course of action, stating the tower was: \\"one of the finest specimens in the Country of the age and style in which it was built.\\" He decided to restore the building. Roof repairs were undertaken circa 1826; a timber base covered with slates was used. At about the same time, \\"the towers were altered and raised and a new entrance door was put in, which was subsequently restored to the original entrance\\" according to the records of the Aberdeenshire Council. Re-construction of almost the entire top floor was also completed. The windows, external harling and pointing were replaced and it is likely Smith also designed the gardener's cottage. The castle originally had more defensive elements including a walled courtyard with four round towers; only one of the round towers remains today. In the arched door to that round tower are preserved the carved initials of Sir Thomas Forbes, William Forbes' son. There is also a massive iron portcullis or gate covering the entrance door which is named a yett. According to the folklore of the area, the castle is haunted by one or more ghosts. =20th century= The Forbes family also owned a large granite house at Fintray near Inverurie, Aberdeenshire. This became the family's main residence for a number of years until the Second World War. During the war, Fintray House was used as a hospital for wounded Belgian soldiers. In 1963, the family donated the Craigievar estate to the National Trust for Scotland which took over operation. Since 1990, the estate has been a Listed building of the Aberdeenshire Council. By the late 1970s, the castle interior boasted a Great Hall that has the Stuart Arms over the fireplace; a musicians gallery; secret staircase connecting the high tower to the Great Hall; Queen's Bedroom; servants' quarters and of course several splendid plasterwork ceilings. There was a collection of Forbes family portraits inside as well as a considerable quantity of Forbes furnishings dating to the 17th and 18th centuries. The castle also housed two original Henry Raeburn portraits complete with original receipts. 21st century The castle, with new harling, in 2010 Between November 2007 and 2009, the castle was closed for its exterior to be given a new harl, returning it to what is believed to be a close equivalent of the harling put in place during the refurbishment of 1820. It was reopened to the public in April 2010. One report provided these specifics about the work and the state of the castle as of 2010: > The tower was renovated and rehabbed ... featuring a traditional lime-based > alternative to concrete-based harling and returning the castle to what would > have been its original shade of pink. The castle interior boasts a Great > Hall that has the Stuart Arms over the fireplace; a musicians‚Äô gallery; a > secret staircase connecting the high tower to the Great Hall; Queen's > Bedroom; servants' quarters and several splendid plasterwork ceilings. The > castle contains a collection of Forbes family portraits and furnishings > dating to the 17th and 18th centuries. No artificial lighting was ever added to the upper floors of the castle, so the artefacts would be viewed in the same natural light as they were during the previous centuries. In 2019, a report provided this summary of the castle grounds: > \\"Little remains of the 17th century designed landscape and the grounds > around the Castle date from the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Further > planting, particularly of ornamental conifers, was added at the end of the > 19th century. In the 1930s a rock garden was created behind the coach-house > and, more recently, flower borders were added around the Castle and in the > kitchen garden\\". In early 2019, a volunteer discovered what is apparently the original door of the property, made of oak; it was replaced in 1825 and was considered to be missing until 2019. The door was subsequently restored and put on display. By 2013 the castle, its grounds, and an estate of over of adjoining farmland and woodland were in their 50th year as a property of the National Trust for Scotland. Visits to the castle were allowed from Easter, or from the first of April (whichever is the earlier), until the end of September. In 2018, the castle was open between April and June, on Fridays to Tuesdays for guided tours; the grounds were open throughout the year. The site received 19,702 visitors in 2018. The National Trust continued to operate tours of the castle in 2019, but during 2020, the estate was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK; on re-opening in July, visits were allowed only on the grounds for the rest of the season. A September 2020 report states that the castle \\"holds a foremost place amongst the examples of what is known as the fourth or L period, from the form of ground plan upon which nearly all the Scottish castles of that date\\". In popular culture The castle is reputed to have been the inspiration for Walt Disney's castle motif.

History The earliest parts of Fyvie Castle date from the 13th century ‚Äì some sources claim it was built in 1211 by William the Lion. Fyvie was the site of an open-air court held by Robert the Bruce, and Charles I lived there as a child. Following the Battle of Otterburn in 1390, it ceased to be a royal stronghold and instead fell into the possession of five successive families ‚Äì Preston, Meldrum, Seton, Gordon and Leith ‚Äì each of whom added a new tower to the castle. The oldest of these, the Preston tower (located on the far right as one faces the main facade of Fyvie), dates to between 1390 and 1433. The impressive Seton tower forms the entrance, and was erected in 1599 by Alexander Seton; Seton also commissioned the great processional staircase several years later. The Gordon tower followed in 1778 , and the Leith in 1890. Inside, the castle stronghold features a great wheel stair, a display of original arms and armour, and a collection of portraits. Manus O'Cahan and Montrose fought a successful minor battle against the Covenant Army at Fyvie Castle on 28 October 1644. The battlefield was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland in 2011. Anne Halkett stayed at the castle from 1650 to 1652 with the Countess of Dunfermline, she treated wounded soldiers and the illnesses of local people, and negotiated with the English Major of a company of Commonwealth soldiers, and with three Colonels, Lilburne, Fitts, and Overton.John Gough Nichols, Autobiography of the Lady Halkett (London, 1875), pp. 64-71 Following Victorian trends, the grounds and adjoining Loch Fyvie were landscaped in the 19th century. The Scottish industrialist Alexander Leith (later Baron Leith of Fyvie) bought the castle in 1885. It was sold to the National Trust for Scotland in 1984 by his descendants. To the East there is a walled garden which is currently a garden of Scottish Cultivated Fruits. There is evidence for two other walled gardens closer to the castle itself to its West and South.http://cameronarchaeology.com/doc/Fyvie_Castle_Environs_Project_final_draft_with_images.pdf The one to the west appears on an estate plan of 1768.http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/record/nrs/RHP11/plan-lands-fyvie-and- surrounding-lands-aberdeenshire/nrs#zoom=2‚™´=2591.5&lon;=4958.5&layers;=B Hauntings The castle (like many places in Scotland) is said to be haunted. A story is told that in 1920 during renovation work the skeleton of a woman was discovered behind a bedroom wall. On the day the remains were laid to rest in Fyvie cemetery, the castle residents started to be plagued by strange noises and unexplained happenings. Fearing he had offended the dead woman, the Laird of the castle had the skeleton exhumed and replaced behind the bedroom wall, at which point the haunting ceased. It is said that there is a secret room in the south-west corner of the castle that must remain sealed, lest anyone entering meet with disaster.Anthony D. Hippisley Coxe, Haunted Britain, page 177, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York 1973 It is unclear if this is the same room in which the skeleton was found. There is also an indelible blood stain, two ghosts and two curses associated with this place.The Green Lady of Fyvie Castle One of the curses has been attributed to the prophetic laird, Thomas the Rhymer. The curse is said to have been part of the mysterious three weeping stones. Only one weeping stone is known to exist and is kept at the castle. The other two have never been found. In the Media Fyvie Castle has featured in a number of British television programmes, such as Living TV's Most Haunted season 6. and stv's Castles of Scotland. The castle also played host of the setting of a children's gameshow on CBBC called Spook Squad in 2004. 2009 saw the publication of the children's fantasy novel, The Time- Tailor and the Fyvie Castle Witch Trials, written by Deborah Leslie. The castle was also featured in BBC documentary, Castle Ghosts of Scotland www.imdb.com , narrated by Robert Hardy. In recent years, the castle grounds have hosted a Fyvie Live music festival in the summer, which was headlined in 2011 by Beverley Knight and in 2012 by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, then following a gap of several years, by The Shires in 2017. Following the revival, it was announced that the event would take place again in 2018, with Ward Thomas as the headline act. Today, the castle is open to tourists during the summer months.

The B-57 is a license-built version of the British English Electric Canberra, manufactured by the Glenn L. Martin Company. Initial Martin-build models were virtually identical to their British-built counterparts; Martin later modified the design to incorporate larger quantities of US-sourced components and produced the aircraft in several different variants. The B-57 Canberra holds the distinction of being the first jet bomber in U.S. service to drop bombs during combat.Bell 2011, p. 15. The Canberra was used extensively during the Vietnam War in a bombing capacity; dedicated versions of the type were also produced and served as high-altitude aerial reconnaissance platforms (the Martin RB-57D Canberra), and as electronic warfare aircraft. The B-57 Canberra was also sold to export customers abroad; further combat use was seen by the Pakistani Air Force during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. In 1983, the USAF opted to retire the type; the B-57 Canberra's retirement marked the ending of the era of the tactical bomber. The three remaining flightworthy WB-57Fs are technically assigned to the NASA Johnson Space Center, next to Ellington Field in Houston, as high-altitude scientific research aircraft, but are also used for testing and communications in the U.S. and Afghanistan.Axe, David. \\"America‚Äôs most important warplane is old, ugly ... and flown by NASA.\\" wired.com, 10 September 2012. Development=Origins= At the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the USAF found itself in dire need of an all-weather interdiction aircraft. The existing inventory of piston-engined Douglas B-26 Invaders had been dispatched in this capacity at the very start of the conflict; however, within only a few months within the theatre, the B-26 had suffered a very high rate of attrition and successes with the type were typically limited. In response to these needs, the USAF requested the British government to provide a private demonstration of the English Electric Canberra, a newly developed jet-powered bomber. On 17 August 1950, the Canberra demonstration was performed at RAF Burtonwood, Warrington, Cheshire, England; during the following month, a team of US test pilots and engineers visited English Electric's Warton factory to perform a series of flight tests and a detailed technical assessment of the aircraft.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 150. On 16 September 1950, the USAF formally issued a request for a jet-powered bomber; the sought aircraft had to possess a top speed of 630 mph (1,020 km/h), ceiling of 40,000 feet (12,190 m), and range of 1,150 miles (1,850 km). Full all-weather capability and a secondary reconnaissance role also had to be included in the design. The American contenders included the Martin XB-51, the North American B-45 Tornado and AJ Savage. To expedite the process, only projects based on existing aircraft were considered and, unusually, the service considered foreign aircraft. These included the Canadian Avro Canada CF-100 and the British English Electric Canberra, which had not yet officially entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF). Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist commented that \\"It seems likely that this first batch of trials convinced the Americans that the Canberra was ideal for the job, but in order to satisfy the US Senate a competitive evaluation of all likely contenders had to be arranged\\". As part of the USAF's evaluation process, all five aircraft were submitted to a series of fly-offs to determine their performance. On 21 February 1951, a British Canberra B.2 (WD932), flown by Roland Beamont, made the transatlantic journey, arriving in the United States to participate in the competition; by making this journey, the Canberra thus became the first jet aircraft to perform a non-stop unrefueled flight across the Atlantic Ocean, travelling from Warton, England, to Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, in the record time of 4 hours 37 minutes. On 26 February 1951, the flyoff took place at Andrews Field, Prince George's County, Maryland; each aircraft was tasked with performing a set sequence of maneuvers within a ten-minute window, directly demonstrating its agility and performance against its rivals. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Canberra proved to be significantly superior to any of the competing aircraft, and its selection was beyond doubt by the end of the competition. =Production arrangements= The Canberra was a foreign aircraft, which meant its superiority in terms of performance did not guarantee political support in spite of the urgent need, particularly in light of there being several rival indigenous aircraft designs. There were also doubts about production availability with English Electric being able to mesh with USAF demands, as well as questions over continued spares support. In March 1951, many of these questions were answered; with production lines already at full capacity meeting Royal Air Force orders and those emerging from other export customers, English Electric entered into discussions with Glenn L. Martin Company. It was proposed that Martin would receive a license to domestically build the Canberra in the United States. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Americanization of the Canberra program proved effective at dismissing much of the political opposition to the project. The British-built Canberra B.2 that was used as a pattern and prototype for the B-57 On 23 March 1951, the USAF issued a contract to Martin, requesting the manufacturing of an initial quantity of 250 Canberras, which had received the USAF designation B-57A (Martin internally designated the type as the Model 272). On 3 April 1951, English Electric and Martin both signed a formal licensing agreement to cover the Canberra's production. During August 1951, a second British-built Canberra (WD940) was flown to the US to act as a pattern aircraft for Martin, as well as to perform assorted trials and to support performance validation of airframe changes. On 21 December 1951, one of the British pattern aircraft (WD932) was lost in accident; although this was subsequently discovered to be caused by incorrect fuel scheduling having led to the tail-heavy aircraft exceeding its design limits during a maneuver, the crash jeopardized the entire program and invigorated the anti-Canberra political opposition. The crash did lead to some design changes in the face of political pressure, but these were not implemented on the first 75 aircraft to be produced. Due to the great urgency placed on delivering the B-57A Canberra, the initial phase of manufacturing performed by Martin used a minimum-change formula to expedite production; thus the first B-57As to be produced were largely identical to the Canberra B.2. As such, more than 30 changes that had been requested by the Wright Air Development Center (WADC) were rejected on program schedule or cost grounds. One noticeable exception was the adoption of more powerful Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engines capable of producing 7,200 lbf (32 kN) of thrust, which were license-built in the United States as the Wright J65. The Sapphire- based J65 powerplant had been selected in place of the British-built Canberra's Rolls-Royce Avons as the USAF had placed an emphasis on operations within hot climates and intended to fly at a slightly higher maximum gross weight than the RAF's operating practices.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 150-151. Several other minor differences were also present between early US- built and UK-built Canberras. These changes included the canopy and fuselage windows being slightly revised, the crew being reduced from three to two, the adoption of wingtip fuel tanks, engine nacelles were modified with additional cooling scoops, and the conventional \\"clamshell\\" bomb bay doors were replaced with a low-drag rotating door originally designed for the XB-51.\\"Pivoting Bomb-bay Door Permits Accurate Drops at High-Speeds.\\" Popular Mechanics, February 1954, p. 126. As a result of these changes, the bomb bay of the US- built aircraft was slightly smaller than its UK-built counterparts in order to allow the American aircraft to carry more fuel; however, the overall external shape of the Canberra remained unchanged.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 151. In early July 1953, the first US-built production aircraft (52-1418) rolled out; it conducted its maiden flight on 20 July 1953. One month later, this initial production aircraft was accepted by the USAF, by which point a cessation of hostilities had come into effect in Korea. This was one of only eight B-57A Canberras to be manufactured; the remaining 67 aircraft from this first batch, deemed no longer to be required as bombers, were converted on the assembly line to serve as medium-altitude reconnaissance aircraft while retaining all the basic Canberra features, and were accordingly re-designated as the RB-57A Canberra. =Further development= B-57B Canberras of the 345th Bombardment Wing in flight, 1957 In place of the curtailed B-57A, a more refined bomber variant, the B-57B, was developed. Having a more lengthy development time, this model incorporated the structural and system changes that had been recommended by WADC, which resulted in the aircraft being more adaptable than its B-57A predecessor. Of the external changes, the most significant was the adoption of a fighter-style canopy accompanied by a flat- panel windshield and a tandem seating arrangement, providing for greater transparency and an improved view for both the pilot and navigator, as well as allowing for a gunsight to be equipped. The corresponding glazed bombing nose of the B-57A was deleted along with the starboard crew entrance to the cockpit.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 151-152. The B-57B introduced several other major changes. In terms of armaments, a total of four hardpoints attached to the outer wing panels were installed on this variant, capable of mounting external bombs and rockets. The B-57B was also furnished with a gun armament for strafing attacks. The first 90 aircraft to be produced were equipped with a total of eight 0.50 cal (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns installed within the wings; on later aircraft these were substituted for by an arrangement of four 20 mm M39 cannon.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 152. A new rotary bomb door was adopted on the B-57B, which had originally been designed for the XB-51, replacing the hinged doors; this proved to be faster to open/close and reduced buffeting, which in turn improved accuracy and allowed for faster attack speeds. The redesigned bomb bay also enabled faster turnaround times on the ground.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 152-153. In addition, hydraulically-operated triangular air brakes were installed on the rear fuselage, which worked in addition to the existing 'finger'-type brakes installed in the wings; the new brakes gave the pilots a greater level of controllability, improving the accuracy of low-level bombing runs. The B-57B was equipped with an APW-11 Bombing Air Radar Guidance System for target approach guidance, as well as an APS-54 radar warning receiver.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 153. The engines were also furnished with a new cartridge starting system, eliminating the reliance on ground start carts. The substantial design changes between the B-57A and B-57B models resulted in delays to the overall program, as well as incurring substantial costs on the fixed-price contract. Gunston and Gilchrist stated of the consequences to the program: \\"This was clearly not the manufacturer's fault, but the money effectively ran out after 177 of the planned 250-aircraft order had been completed\\". In 1954, in response to the sound performance offered by the B-57B, the USAF elected to place a large second order; this included a further 100 B-57B bombers, 38 B-57C trainers, and 20 RB-57D high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. In 1955, a final batch of 68 B-57E target tugs was ordered. In 1969, in response to demands for a capable night interdiction aircraft for combat operations in the Vietnam theatre, a total of 16 B-57B Canberras were substantially rebuilt during a lengthy upgrade program.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 154. These aircraft received an entirely new nose section containing an AN/ANQ-139 forward-looking radar, a low-light television system, and an AN/AAS-26 forward-looking infrared detector. A laser rangefinder/designator was also installed, and the wing pylons modified to accommodate laser-guided Paveway bombs, while all the guns were removed to save weight.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, pp. 154-155. During the production run from 1953 to 1957, a total of 403 B-57s were built. Operational history EB-57A parked at Scott AFB, 1969. B-57B, 71st Bombardment Squadron, Laon- Couvron Air Base, circa 1957 B-57E with nose graft from a Bomarc, for testing of the missile The B-57A was not considered combat-ready by the USAF and the aircraft were used solely for testing and development. One of the aircraft was given to the National Weather Bureau which fitted it with a new nose radome and used it to track hurricanes. The aircraft was placed into limited production. Particularly contentious were the cockpit arrangement and the lack of guns, the Canberra having been designed as a high-speed, high altitude bomber rather than for close air support. The definitive B-57B, which introduced numerous improvements, made its first flight on 18 June 1954. The aircraft initially suffered from the same engine malfunctions as the RB-57As and several were lost in high-speed low-level operations due to a faulty tailplane actuator which caused the aircraft to dive into the ground. The USAF came to consider the B-57B as being inadequate for the night intruder role and thus Martin put all aircraft through an extensive avionics upgrade in response. Regardless, by the end of 1957, the USAF tactical squadrons were being re-equipped with supersonic North American F-100 Super Sabres. The complete retirement was delayed, however, by the start of the Vietnam War. =Reconnaissance and electronic warfare B-57s= : See also: 7407th Support Squadron, Martin RB-57D Canberra, Martin RB-57F Canberra While the USAF found the B-57A lacking, the photo reconnaissance RB-57A saw some operational use. First flying in October 1953, RB-57As fully equipped the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw Air Force Base by July 1954. The aircraft were also deployed with USAF squadrons in Germany, France, and Japan. However, operational readiness was poor and the aircraft suffered from significant production delays because of engine problems. Wright had subcontracted production of J65 engines to Buick, which resulted in slow deliveries and a tendency for engine oil to enter the bleed air system, filling the cockpit with smoke. The problems were ameliorated when Wright took over engine production in 1954. RB-57As also suffered from a high accident rate caused in part by poor single-engine handling. This resulted in the entire fleet spending much of 1955 on the ground. By 1958, all RB-57A craft were replaced in active service by the Douglas RB-66B and McDonnell RF-101A. Air National Guard units extensively used the RB-57A for photographic surveys of the United States until 1971. A number of modified RB-57As were used by the 7499th Support Group at Wiesbaden AB, West Germany in Operation \\"Heart Throb\\" reconnaissance missions over Europe.\\"Heart Throb.\\" Spyflight. Retrieved: 5 July 2010. Ten aircraft were pulled off Martin's production line and modifications were performed in August 1955 by the Wright Air Development Center and by Martin. All equipment not absolutely essential for the daytime photography role was eliminated. The bomb bay door was removed and the area was skinned over. The seat for the system operator/navigator was removed, and an optical viewfinder was installed in the nose so that the pilot could perform all the reconnaissance duties without the assistance of the navigator. The clear plexiglass nose cone was replaced by an opaque fiberglass cone, but with a small optical glass window cut for the viewfinder. The plane's J65-BW-5s were replaced by higher-thrust J65-W-7s. The aircraft was referred to as RB-57A-1. The weight reduction program shaved 5665 pounds off the weight of the RB-57A, and the ceiling was increased by 5000 feet.Mikesh, Robert C. Martin B-57 Canberra: The Complete Record. Atglen, Pennsylvania: Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 1995. . Two RB-57A-1s were used by the Republic of China Air Force for reconnaissance missions over China; one was shot down by a Chinese Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 on 18 February 1958 and the pilot killed. In 1959, two RB-57Ds were delivered to replace the A-types; one of them was shot down over China by a SA-2 Guideline missile, marking the very first successful operational engagement of surface-to-air missiles. Two other RB-57As were used by the Federal Aviation Administration to plan high-altitude airways for the upcoming jet passenger aircraft. Starting in 1959, Martin began to modify retired RB-57As with electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment in the bomb bay. Redesignated EB-57A, these aircraft were deployed with Defense Systems Evaluation Squadrons which played the role of aggressors to train the friendly air defense units in the art of electronic warfare. Subsequent bomber variants were also modified to fulfill this role. Although initially conducted by active duty Air Force units, the EB-57 mission eventually migrated to selected units of the Air National Guard.Witt, Lt Col Marquis. \\"EB-57 Electronic Countermeasures(ECM).\\" b-57canberra.org.

Strategic Air Command employed 20 RB-57D aircraft from 1956 until 1964. Little is known about their use. The aircraft were retired due to structural fatigue and the advent of the U-2 and SR-71.Mikesh 1977, pp. 46‚Äì47. For many years two WB-57F Canberras (NASA 926 and NASA 928) were flown and maintained by NASA for high altitude atmospheric research. These same two aircraft have also been deployed alternately to Afghanistan for use as communications platforms that fly high over an area linking various communications devices on the battlefield and to other airborne assets, they were known as the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node system (BACN).Tarantola, Andrew. \\"Why Are the Most Vital Aircraft in the USAF Arsenal Owned by NASA?\\" Gizmodo, 2 November 2013. In 2011 it was determined that a third aircraft was needed to satisfy mission requirements and an additional WB-57 was removed from the 309th AMARG after over 40 years at Davis-Monthan AFB and returned to flight status in August 2013 as NASA 927.Filmer, Paul. \\"NASA‚Äôs new WB-57F, N927NA, flies for the first time in 41 years.\\" Global Aviation Resource, 10 August 2013. =Vietnam War= Patricia Lynn RB-57E at Da Nang, January 1964 Tropic Moon III B-57G with FLIR/LLLTVradar mounted in the nose of the aircraft. Det 1 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing Tan Son Nhut Air Base South Vietnam with RB-57E 55-4264, early 1968 Patricia Lynn Project Although intended as a bomber and never before deployed by the USAF to a combat zone, the first B-57s to be deployed to South Vietnam were not operated in an offensive role. The need for additional reconnaissance assets, especially those capable of operating at night, led to the deployment of two RB-57E aircraft on 15 April 1963. The USAF had awarded General Dynamics a contract to modify two B-57E Canberras (55-4243, 55‚Äì4245) as all-weather high-altitude strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Under project Patricia Lynn these aircraft provided infrared coverage using their Reconofax VI cameras.Smith 1966, p. 8. General Dynamics was chosen to modify the B-57E as it had extensive experience modifying Canberras with the RB-57D and RB-57F projects and turning the B-57 into a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. The forward nose section of the B-57Es were modified to house a KA-1 36-inch forward oblique camera and a low panoramic KA-56 camera used on the Lockheed U-2. Mounted inside the specially configured bomb bay door was a KA-1 vertical camera, a K-477 split vertical day-night camera, an infrared scanner, and a KA-1 left oblique camera. The modified aircraft were redesignated RB-57E. The 2nd Air Division was desperate for tactical intelligence and on arrival the pilots that ferried in the RB-57Es were immediately assigned to the Division as combat crews and briefed on missions by Divisional intelligence officers on the reconnaissance flights they would make. The first mission was flown on 7 May 1963 by the highly classified Patricia Lynn squadron (Detachment 1, 33d Tactical Group, later 6250th Combat Support Group, later 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing) operating from Tan Son Nhut AB. The Detachment flew nighttime reconnaissance missions to identify Viet Cong (VC) base camps, small arms factories, and storage and training areas. The sorties yielded results that heretofore only had been wished for. The nighttime imagery showed VC training and base camps; small, hidden factories and storage dumps that RF-101 Voodoo crews had flown over during the day and had been unable to locate from the air. The existing RF-101s in 1963 could only photograph a few kilometers (they had to fly very low) per flight with their cameras. The RB-57Es could image the whole border with Cambodia in 2 1/2 flights at 16,000 to 17,000 feet with superior results. From then on, Patricia Lynn crews flew both night and day missions over South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and areas of North Vietnam until 1971, being some of the last USAF tactical aircraft to be withdrawn from the country. The RB-57Es carried the call-sign \\"Moonglow\\". Some missions were flown at low-level over single targets, others consisted of 4‚Äì6 specific targets. At night RB-57Es flew the canals and rivers in the Mekong Delta and southern part of South Vietnam. The sampans were easy to spot with the \\"real time\\" IR if the crew could keep over the canal which was difficult in the darkness. The United States began Operation Steel Tiger over the Laos Panhandle and the DMZ on 3 April 1965, to locate and destroy enemy forces and materiel being moved southward at night into South Vietnam, and to fly bomb damage assessment reconnaissance runs over targets attacked in the secret war the United States fought there. These flights teamed with B-57B bombers operating out of Bien Hoa Air Base and a C-130 Hercules flare ship. Three more aircraft were subsequently modified in 1964/65 bringing the number of aircraft to five. Two RB-57Es were lost in combat operations. The first (S/N 55-4243) was lost as a result of a fuselage fire caused by small arms while on a low level reconnaissance mission in August 1965. The crew ejected safely when near Tan Son Nhut Air Base. The second aircraft (S/N 55-4264) was lost on 15 October 1968, after an engine fire started by ground fire forced the crew to eject. A sixth Patricia Lynn aircraft (55‚Äì4257) joined the team in 1968, as a replacement for the combat losses. This aircraft had a Terrain-following radar designed to allow the aircraft to fly at a constant altitude, which would, in theory, produce better reconnaissance photos. Unfortunately, the aircraft flew so low (500‚Äì1000 feet) that the infrared film was used up before the entire assessment area could be photographed. A 1968 update, under the Compass Eagle program, gave the back-seater a video display to monitor the IR scanner system. This allowed the crew to call in strikes on targets in real time, instead of having to return to base to get imagery developed, by which time the enemy would have likely moved on. There were frequent changes and updating of the equipment, including the installation of 12-inch focal length KA-82 and 24-inch focal length KA-83 cameras. The infrared equipment was useful in spotting VC river traffic at night along the Mekong Delta southeast of Saigon. In 1969/70, Patricia Lynn missions were flown into Laos and into Cambodia including Operation Barrel Roll strikes in 1969. The Patricia Lynn operation was terminated in mid-1971 with the inactivation of the 460th TRW and the four surviving aircraft returned to the United States. Known RB-57E Patricia Lynn aircraft were: * Martin B-57E-MA 55-4243 Modified to RB-57E in 1963. Lost in combat with Detachment 1, 6250th Combat Support Group, when hit by ground fire 5 August 1965 and caught fire while on return to base. * Martin B-57E-MA 55-4245. Modified to RB-57E in 1963.

Converted to EB-57E in 1971 and transferred to ADC 4677th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron, Hill AFB, Utah. Retired to MASDC in 1979. Later in August 1965, a single RB-57F would be deployed to Udorn, RTAB in an attempt to gather information about North Vietnamese SAM sites, first under project Greek God and then under project Mad King. In December another RB-57F would be deployed for this purpose, under project Sky Wave. Neither project garnered useful results and they were terminated in October 1965 and February 1966 respectively.Smith 1966, pp. 41‚Äì42. Bombing and interdiction The deployment of actual combat capable B-57Bs from 8th and 13th Bomb Squadrons to Bien Hoa Air Base in August 1964 began with two aircraft lost and one damaged in collisions on arrival.Bell 2011, p. 91. An additional five aircraft were destroyed with another 15 damaged by a Viet Cong mortar attack in November of the same year. Low level sorties designated as training flights were conducted with the hope of it having a psychological effect. As a result, the first combat mission was only flown on 19 February 1965.Drendel 1982, pp. 13‚Äì14. The first excursion into North Vietnam took place on 2 March as part of Operation Rolling Thunder. The aircraft typically carried nine 500 lb (227 kg) bombs in the bomb bay and four 750 lb (340 kg) bombs under the wings. In April, Canberras began flying night intruder missions supported by USAF's Fairchild C-123 Provider or Lockheed C-130 Hercules flare ships and USN's EF-10B Skyknight electronic warfare aircraft. U.S. B-57 Canberras were primarily used for dive bombing and strafing, with the early models mounting eight .50 caliber machine guns, four per wing. Later models mounted four 20mm cannons, two per wing, for strafing. These weapons combined with their bomb loads and four hours of flight time made them excellent ground support aircraft, as well as exceptional truck killers along the Ho Chi Minh trail.Bell 2011, pp. 8, 16, 19‚Äì21, 43. Deployed along the notorious \\"trail\\" for much of their eight years in Vietnam, Canberras participated in truck hunting campaigns during operations Barrel Roll, Steel Tiger, and Tiger Hound, gaining reputations with their \\"Centurion Club\\" which consisted of Canberra crews which attained 100 truck kills.Bell 2011, p. 72. On 16 May 1965, an armed B-57B exploded on the runway at Bi√™n H√≤a, setting off a chain reaction that destroyed 10 other Canberras, 11 Douglas A-1 Skyraiders, and one Vought F-8 Crusader. Due to combat attrition, in October 1966, B-57Bs were transferred to Phan Rang where they supported operations in the Iron Triangle along with Australian-built Canberra B.20s of No. 2 Squadron RAAF. The aircraft also continued to fly night interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh trail. Of the 94 B-57Bs deployed to Southeast Asia, 51 were lost in combat and seven other Canberras were lost to other causes. Only nine were still flying by 1969.Bell 2011, pp. 73, 91. B-57s returned to Southeast Asia in the form of the Tropic Moon III B-57G, deployed to Thailand during the fall of 1970.Pfau and Greenhalgh 1978 Intended as a night intruder to help combat movement along the Ho Chi Minh trail, these aircraft were equipped with a variety of new sensors and other equipment, and were capable of dropping laser guided munitions.Pfau and Greenhalgh 1978, p. 29. The relative kill rates per sortie during Operation Commando Hunt V between the B-57G and the AC-130A/E showed that the former was not as suited to the role of truck hunter.Pfau and Greenhalgh 1978, p. 64. An attempt to combine both led to one B-57G being modified to house a special bomb bay installation of one Emerson TAT-161 turret with a single M61 20mm cannon as a gunship under project Pave Gat. After delays in testing at Eglin AFB, Florida, due to competition for mission time from the Tropic Moon III B-57Gs, Pave Gat tests proved \\"that the B-57G could hit stationary or moving targets with its 20mm gun, day or night. Loaded with 4,000 rounds of ammunition, the Pave Gat B-57G could hit as many as 20 targets, three times as many as the bomb-carrying B-57G. The Pave Gat aircraft could avoid antiaircraft fire by firing from offset positions, while the bomb carrier had to pass directly over the target.\\" Deployment to SEA was resisted, however, by the Seventh and Thirteenth Air Forces and others as the decision had been made in August 1971 to return the B-57G squadron to the U.S. in early 1972, leaving insufficient evaluation time. Project Pave Gat was terminated 21 December 1971.Pfau and Greenhalgh 1978, pp. 45‚Äì49. The B-57G was removed from Thailand in May 1972. Plans remained for the continuation of the B-57G program but post-conflict spending cuts forced the abandonment of these plans.Pfau and Greenhalgh 1978, pp. 91‚Äì92. For a short period Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) personnel operated four B-57B aircraft. The RVNAF never officially took control of the aircraft, and, after accidents and other problems, including apparent claims by RVNAF pilots that the B-57 was beyond their physical capabilities, the program was terminated in April 1966, and the aircraft were returned to their original USAF units.Mesko 1987, p. 43. A total of 58 B-57 Canberras were recorded as having been lost during the Vietnam War; of these, 26 were lost to ground fire, 5 were lost to mortar fire and ground attack, 4 were lost to mid-air collision, 10 were lost to airfield accidental bomb explosion, 7 were lost to operational causes, and 6 were lost due to unknown causes.Hobson 2001, p. 268. These figures include two B-57E Canberras from the 1st Det 33rd Tactical Group. =Pakistan= Pakistan Air Force B-57s The Pakistan Air Force was one of the main users of the B-57 and made use of it in two wars with India. In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, B-57s flew 167 sorties, dropping over 600 tons of bombs. Three B-57s were lost in action (only one as a result of enemy action), along with one RB-57F electronic intelligence aircraft.Baugher, Joe. \\"B-57 with Pakistan.\\" Martin B-57, Joe Baugher's Encyclopedia of American Aircraft, 6 May 2001.

On the very first night, 12 IAF runways were targeted and a total of 183 bombs were dropped rendering the Indian airfields useless for 6 hours to 6 days.Lal, cAir Chief Marshal P.C. My Days with the IAF. As the war progressed, PAF B-57s carried out many night missions.

He has been referred to as the \\"Human Condor\\".BBC SPORT  Federer wins top sportsman prize Biography D'Arrigo was born in Catania, Sicily but grew up from a very early age in Paris, as his parents emigrated there in search of work. He returned to Sicily after graduating from the university in Paris, and from his base on Mt. Etna gained a number of world records and world titles in the field of ultra light flying and free flying. In 2001 he initiated a sequence of breath-taking events which saw him flying alongside various birds of prey as he attempted to learn from them their techniques for migratory flight by taking advantage of thermal air currents for long distance flight with low energy consumption. In 2002 he crossed the Sahara and the Mediterranean with an eagle. His hang glider was launched from a microlight. In 2003 he flew 5,500 kilometres from northern Siberia to the Caspian Sea in Iran in the company of a flock of Siberian cranes BBC NEWS  Monitoring  Media reports  Siberian cranes take flying lessons who had been born in captivity and, due to imprinting, considered him their parent. The bird is at risk of extinction, and, in order to try to save the species, Russian ornithologists hatched a plan. It called for having the eggs incubated under Angelo's hang-glider, so the chicks saw this as they hatched. Angelo would then be with the chicks as they fledge. When they were ready to fly, they would fly alongside Angelo so they would consider him their mentor. That way, he could show them the traditional migratory route for their species. They had no other way to learn it. This approach was similar to the one taken in the movie Fly Away Home. In 2004, he was aerotowed by Richard Meredith-Hardy and released over Mount Everest BBC NEWS  England  Beds/Bucks/Herts  Man flies microlight over Everest another world record. He reportedly made this flight over the summit of Everest with a trained Nepalese eagle. However, there were no eyewitnesses to this achievement, even though climbers saw and photographed Meredith- Hardy's microlight aircraft. No evidence in the form of videos or photography has ever been brought forward, either, despite the fact that d'Arrigo's hang- glider was equipped with three video cameras and two still cameras.Telegraph, 01 Jun 2006  News  Obituaries  Angelo d'Arrigo The story is fully narrated in the documentary Flying Over Everest by director Fabio Toncelli. In 2006 he followed the migratory routes of the condor over Aconcagua in the Andean Cordillera, the highest mountain in the Americas. Death In March 2006, he died in an accident during an airshow at Comiso, Italy, at the age of 44. A small Sky Arrow airplane, in which he was a passenger, fell 200 meters to the ground. Both d'Arrigo and the pilot, a general of the Italian Air Force and ex-test pilot, were killed on impact. At the time of his death, Angelo was engaged in planning an expedition to Peru to re-introduce two Andean condors bred in captivity and raised by d'Arrigo at his home on Mount Etna. A documentary about this was being made at the time. It was called \\"Born to Fly\\". In memory of her husband, his widow Laura instituted a charity, the Fondazione Angelo d'Arrigo, with the aim of helping children in Peru. Angelo d'Arrigo was posthumously given the alternative sportsperson's award at the 2006 Laureus World Sports Awards.

The organization is divided into 12 sections, named SD-1 through SD-12. \\"SD\\" stands for Section Disparu ‚Äì literally, the section which has disappeared in French (Sydney translates it as \\"the section that doesn't exist\\" in the episode Q&A;), this was coined by founder Alain Christophe. These organizational cells are spread over 12 major cities of the world. The Alliance takes in recruits and tricks them to believe they are working for the CIA when in reality they are not. =Objectives= The purview of the Alliance is the black market trading of weapons, military secrets, industrial intelligence, medical technology, computer advances, and political agendas. Its clients include governments, corporations, wealthy citizens, and families. The Alliance aims to eventually reach world domination through its control over organized crime and the trade of intelligence. According to Jack Bristow and Arvin Sloane, the Alliance once wished to change the world when it had achieved this, and rid the world of corruption, but had become bloated and corrupt over the years, diverging from their original vision and focusing instead on profit. =Actions= According to Sydney Bristow in the episode \\"Q and A\\", the Alliance of Twelve was responsible for the carbon proxy disaster in 1992, in which an accidental methyl isocyanate leak at the manufacturer plant in Bhopal, Madhyapradesh, India killed three thousand people and injured another thousand, leaving them disabled. In 1996, near Kyoto, Japan, a bullet train accidentally switched tracks and derailed, killing a hundred and fifty people. The Alliance was also responsible for that disaster. In 2001, the Alliance caused a transport plane in Germany to suffer mechanical failures outside Munich, killing twelve people. The disasters were falsely believed to have been accidents. In truth, some were acts of revenge, others were personal favors to those who helped fund the Alliance. Some were distractions so that local resources were occupied so that SD-4 or SD-7 could infiltrate a building somewhere and retrieve sensitive data. =SD-6= SD-6, headed by Arvin Sloane and based in Los Angeles, is the focus of the first two seasons of Alias. SD-6 pretends to be part of the CIA and states its objective as \\"retrieval and study of intelligence both military and industrial throughout the world that is critical to the superiority and survival of the United States of America.\\" Even its own members, initially including agent Sydney Bristow, believe it is a black ops division of the CIA; and only a handful of senior staff know the truth and are complicit in the deception. The name \\"SD-6\\" derives from the French, Section Disparu, which, in character Sydney Bristow's words, means \\"The Section that doesn't exist.\\"Alias, Season One, Episode 17, \\"Q and A.\\" In the first episode of Alias, Sydney learns from her father, Jack, about the organization's true character as a part of The Alliance of Twelve. During the course of the first season, other heads of the SD cells are eventually shown meeting. Among them was Edward Poole, head of SD-9 (played by Roger Moore), who manages to convince Sloane to kill fellow SD head Jean Briault to influence an upcoming vote on whether to declare war on Alexander Khasinau, who has eliminated rival groups FTL and K-Directorate. Another SD leader is identified by the first name \\"Ramon,\\" but his last name and his SD cell number are unrevealed. =Paranoia and ruthlessness= Of SD-6  SD-6 branch was headquartered in the Credit Dauphine building in Los Angeles, with entry through a special elevator to the sixth sub-level of the building. Every person who entered would be biometrically scanned and visually confirmed. As a security measure, all three areas of the foundations of the building itself were rigged with C-4 explosives that would go off if the inner vault had been breached during a security lockdown or for other contingencies. Fail-safe or lockdown procedures could be carried out only by Arvin Sloane, using his right index fingerprint; presumably, other SD cells had similar contingency plans (such as for deterring a CIA raid, which happens in Season 2) that would make it difficult to shut down. In addition, SD-6 employed an internal security group responsible for investigating and terminating individuals who even know of SD-6's existence, those believed to know about the true nature of SD-6, or those suspected to be Double agents or traitors to SD-6. Sydney's fianc√©e, Danny, was murdered by SD-6's internal security division in Season 1 after Sydney revealed to him that she works for SD-6, believing it to be a part of the CIA.  Of The Alliance  In addition to the cell-like nature of Section Disparu, which presumably allows the termination of entire SD cells in the event that it is wholly compromised, the Alliance of Twelve is an utterly ruthless organization that constantly suspects and conduct surveillance of even its head members. When Arvin Sloane's wife, Emily, admits to knowing of the existence of SD-6, Arvin is told to have his wife killed as a test of loyalty. Arvin was able to win a temporary reprieve because of his wife's cancer which would kill her soon; when her cancer is found to be in remission, he is again told that in order to become a \\"full partner\\" in The Alliance, he would have to kill his wife. He then faked his wife's death by drugging her wine and putting her in suspended animation. Having proven his loyalty to the members of The Alliance, he is welcomed as a full partner and injected in the neck with a tracking device and mini-microphone to have his movements and conversations recorded 24/7. Although Sloane was clearly privy to matters that only a handful of men and women knew about, he was clearly not yet part of an 'inner circle' within The Alliance board, suggesting that there is some sense of competition and suspicion among the SD cells and their leaders. =The end of The Alliance= The Alliance came to an end in the middle of Season 2 (Episode 13, \\"Phase One\\") of Alias when Sydney stumbles upon information, with Sark's aid, that leads her and Vaughn to believe there is one master server, server 47 (in keeping with the Rambaldi sub-plot of the show, where 47 is a key number in Rambaldi's works), which could potentially have all the information the CIA would need to shut down all of the SD cells simultaneously, thus acting as a sort of 'silver bullet' to the cell-like nature of the Alliance. Although the server was located on a Boeing 747 plane that was constantly airborne as a security measure, Sydney was able to pose as an escort for the computer technicians on board during one of its landings and copy all the information from the server. When Jack attempted to go back to SD-6 headquarters to get confirmation that the information was genuine (as the CIA would only have one chance), he was apprehended by the acting head Geiger (Sloane had taken off and was declared MIA by the Alliance) who accused him of being a CIA spy. Knowing she could not go back herself, Sydney called her SD-6 partner Marcus Dixon to get the confirmation and tells Dixon the true nature of SD-6. With this information, the CIA was able to successfully raid all the offices of various SD cells around the world; Sydney was a part of the CIA team that infiltrated SD-6 headquarters in Los Angeles and rescued her father moments before he would be electrocuted by Geiger. It is then revealed that Sloane had planned the destruction of the Alliance, having a technician bypass the surveillance devices in his neck, and he and Sark had supplied Sydney with the information the CIA needed to remove The Alliance ‚Äì after he had cleared out (apparently) all Rambaldi artifacts to his own location outside of SD-6. However, one artifact escaped Sloane's attention. This artifact, the Horizon, had been sought by Prophet Five for thirty years, and was eventually retrieved (after coercing Sydney) by Irina Derevko, who then betrayed Prophet Five, almost four years after the fall of the Alliance. The Covenant The Covenant is a large, powerful, and secretive intelligence/terrorist organization. The Covenant was a \\"loose affiliation of Russian nationalists\\" composed of retired KGB and former Central Committee members, all dedicated to the new world envisioned by Milo Rambaldi. It functioned much like an organized crime family. At one point, it had six cell leaders, until Julian Sark and Lauren Reed (a double agent in the United States National Security Council who was Michael Vaughn's wife) assassinated them in a bid for power. The Covenant had secured Sark's release to gain access to his wealth as a Romanov descendant. McKenas Cole had somehow managed to secure his own release and was now the second most powerful individual in the Covenant. During season 3, it was based in St. Petersburg. Two of its front companies were the Dryden Bank and Chantre Telecom. Following the end of season 2 and prior to the beginning of season 3, The Covenant kidnapped Sydney Bristow and attempted to brainwash her into believing she was a Covenant agent. Sydney operated as a double agent for the CIA using the alias Julia Thorne for almost two years. Eventually, Sydney left the Covenant and had her memory of the missing years erased in an effort to prevent the Covenant from gaining a crucial Rambaldi artifact, later revealed to be the Sphere of Life. FBI Assistant Director Kendall later told Sydney about those missing years and how she was able to escape the Covenant with his help. At the end of season 3 Lauren Reed was killed and Sark was captured. In season 4 the Covenant has disappeared as a threat, and Sark later referred to the \\"implosion of the Covenant.\\" However, the \\"implosion\\" was a ruse perpetrated by Elena Derevko, who was revealed to be the leader of the Covenant, and that Irina Derevko had actually been trying to prevent Elena's endgame. Elena's new headquarters is in Prague and was eventually raided; however, she managed to escape. Elena's endgame, based on her interpretation of one of Rambaldi's prophecies, was an apocalypse called Il Diluvio, The Flood. Covenant operatives primed the world's water with Rambaldi substances and Elena activated an enormous Mueller device in Sovogda, Russia. The device broadcast a frequency which caused those who had consumed the tainted water to go into a mindless rage. Elena's intent was that, after the entire world's population had been affected, the Earth would be \\"cleansed\\" with very few survivors. With the help of Irina, the APO team managed to prevent The Flood, and Irina killed Elena. However, Nadia Santos had been captured and injected with the tainted water and sent out to fight her sister Sydney, as foreseen by Rambaldi. Sydney only managed to survive with the intervention of Arvin Sloane, who shot Nadia and put her in a coma. =Known Covenant members= *Elena Derevko (leader) *Roger Barris (leader) *Ned Bolger (aka \\"Arvin Clone;\\" believed himself to be Arvin Sloane and not associated with The Covenant) *Kazari Bomani *Sydney Bristow (alias Julia Thorne; double agent) *\\"Coke Bottle Glasses\\" (real name unknown; Elena's underling) *McKenas Cole (Elena's second in command and chief of operations) *\\"Irina Derevko\\" (real name unknown; volunteered to be doubled and killed by Jack Bristow) *Katya Derevko (allied, possibly as a ruse to help bring down Elena; exact status unknown) *Allison Doren *Johannes Gathird (one of the cell leaders assassinated by Lauren Reed) *Gerhard Kronish (a cell leader assassinated by Sark or Reed) *Leonid Lisenker (defected in North Korea) *Oleg Madrczyk (tried to turn Sydney into Julia Thorne; later killed by Sydney) *Calvin McCullough (former head of SD-6 Psychological Warfare Division, responsible for creating \\"Arvin Clone\\") *Lucien Nisard (led a raid on the Department of Special Research to obtain Rambaldi artifacts) *Lauren Reed (co-leader of North American cell) *Olivia Reed *Uschek San'ko (Sark's main Covenant contact.

It was formed at the beginning of Season 4 and is headquartered beneath the Los Angeles Subway system. =History and background= Its first director was Arvin Sloane, who also gave the organization its name as an inside joke since the main entrance to APO's headquarters was behind a maintenance door in the Los Angeles subway system marked \\"Authorized Personnel Only\\". Concerned that increased public scrutiny of the CIA and resulting red tape has impeded their ability to do their job, the CIA asked Sloane to set up the covert unit as one that is still governed by U.S. laws, but unhampered by bureaucratic chain of command with no accountability except to themselves. Sloane was chosen because of his experience running SD-6, which successfully posed as a CIA black ops division for several years. All of its initial members were hand-picked by Sloane, and in order to maintain APO's cover as a unit that officially doesn't exist, all members from previous seasons officially resign from the CIA under varying circumstances to work for APO. Although headed by Sloane, APO ultimately answered to CIA Director Hayden Chase, and at the end of Season 4, Sloane was removed from his post and replaced by Jack Bristow, who remained in charge of APO into Season 5. Sloane ultimately returned to APO as assistant director, although unknown to his colleagues he was now a mole for Prophet Five, a criminal organization that also pretended to be the CIA in order to recruit. Sloane was allowed back into APO in order to use its resources to find a cure for Nadia Santos, his daughter, after the events of the season 4 finale. =Personnel= The first agents recruited and their new call signs are: *Jack Bristow ‚Äì Raptor *Sydney Bristow ‚Äì Phoenix *Michael Vaughn ‚Äì Shotgun *Marcus Dixon ‚Äì Outrigger Nadia Santos (Evergreen) later joined APO at her request. Marshall Flinkman (Merlin) was recruited to serve as tech support. Eric Weiss also became a member after crossing paths with Sydney and Vaughn during an APO mission. In the fifth season, APO gained two new members following the apparent death of Michael Vaughn, Eric Weiss's transfer to Washington D.C. and Nadia's hospitalization for her illness. Thomas Grace (Sidewinder) was recruited from another division of the CIA, while Rachel Gibson (Oracle) was a former, unwitting agent of The Shed who thought she was working for the CIA while under Gordon Dean; Rachel essentially took over Sydney's former role as the double agent in the enemy organization while Sydney acted as Rachel's handler just as Vaughn was once hers, particularly since Sydney's current pregnancy limited her abilities as a field agent. As the series approached its finale, numerous changes occurred in APO. Arvin Sloane was removed as director and replaced by Jack Bristow. As Sloane's endgame began to come to fruition, involving moles within the CIA itself, Bristow began to hide information from CIA oversight. In the series finale, APO headquarters was destroyed by a large bomb planted in the subway by Julian Sark, who was working with Sloane. APO and the subway were evacuated, but agent Thomas Grace died in the blast. (The episode revealed that APO headquarters was within a few blocks of Los Angeles City Hall, meaning that APO must be in the Civic Center Station). The series ends with a \\"flash-forward\\" to several years into the future (roughly 2014). Marcus Dixon is referred to as \\"deputy director\\" but it is not indicated whether APO still exists in this future time. Prophet Five Screengrab from Series Finale The Shed is a fictional criminal operation in the television series Alias. The leader of the Shed was initially Gordon Dean, and later temporarily, Kelly Peyton, though her superiors warned her that any more betrayals would lead to severe consequences and they both ultimately answered to a larger group: Prophet Five. Prophet Five served as an Illuminati-like conspiracy group in the fifth season of Alias. The headquarters of Prophet Five was in Barcelona, Spain, with known Shed satellite offices in Prague, Cleveland, Seattle, Chicago and St. Louis. =History and objectives= Prophet Five was started in the 1970s by Oskar Mueller as a project funded by a private foundation. Parts of the project were compartmentalized, but it is known that the \\"best and the brightest\\" mathematicians, linguists, scientists, and cryptologists, including James Lehman and the father of Andr√© Michaux, were recruited to decrypt a section of a 15th-century manuscript known as the Profeta Cinque (Fifth Prophet) which was written in apparently unbreakable code. They succeeded, and discovered that the manuscript referenced proteins, nucleotides and amino acids ‚Äì advanced genetics apparently ahead of its time. Lehman and Michaux assumed they were being tested, and presented their findings to a committee. The project was shut down and they were sent back to their everyday lives. Meanwhile, Ren√©e Rienne's father, Luc Goursaud, was involved in another part of the project, as a test subject for clinical trials administered by Doctor Aldo Desantis. He was paid an impressive amount of money. It is unknown what he was tested for, but it is known that thirty years later, Desantis emerged from a cryogenic chamber looking identical to Ren√©e's father. It is likely that Prophet Five experimented on Ren√©e's father to develop experimental genetic doubling techniques, possibly based on Lehman and Michaux's findings from the manuscript. Ren√©e's father somehow discovered something about the experiments that disturbed him, and he fled with his daughter across Europe, only to be taken away by Desantis. Ren√©e witnessed this and swore revenge. A few weeks after Lehman and Michaux shut down the project, Michaux contacted Lehman. He had begun to notice that those who they were told had worked on the project were starting to die in mysterious accidents. He would then change his name and go into hiding (as Bill Vaughn) and urge Lehman to do the same. According to Irina Derevko most assumed Prophet Five to be a myth and discounted its existence, but around the time of the events occurring in Sovogda rumors arose that Prophet Five was real and had gone active once again. The group pursued the Horizon. The key to finding this Rambaldi device lay with old SD-6 files. Prophet Five kidnapped and hypnotized Sydney Bristow, believing she had the knowledge from SD-6 that would aid in recovering the device. Sydney gave them fake coordinates, but her mother Irina tricked her into taking them to the real location of the Horizon, a safety deposit box in Vancouver. Irina betrayed Prophet Five and disappeared with the Horizon. Prophet Five's endgame also revolved around 15th century prophet Milo Rambaldi, specifically his interest in Sydney, whom Rambaldi refers to as his \\"Chosen One.\\" Ultimately, Prophet Five's endgame remains a mystery, as the Twelve were on Sloane's orders. Since Irina and Sloane were apparently after immortality, it may be assumed the Twelve were after the secret as well. =Structure and organization= Prophet Five was led by a group of twelve, remarkably similar to the Alliance. In addition, the Shed operated similarly to SD-6, with most agents believing they were part of a black ops division of the CIA. Members have ties to British MI6, Russian SVR, French Intelligence, the Centers for Disease Control, pharmaceutical companies, and even the CIA. Prophet Five also had some connection with the government of North Korea, as Doctor Desantis was transported to a North Korean military facility after escaping Ren√©e Rienne. Members of the Twelve controlled entire sectors of technology, finance, and defense. When Arvin Sloane is summoned to meet the twelve in Minsk, the twelve consist of 11 men and one woman. =Personnel=Known aliases of the Twelve *Y. Olnocvhev *S. Danforth *M. Aidarov *D. Chivers *G.

In a series of underwater campaigns numerous items were recovered and placed on display at the Mus√©e National du Bardo, Tunis. The greater part of the sculptures were salvaged between 1907 and 1913 by French archaeologist Alfred Merlin, at that time Director of Antiquities in the Protectorate of Tunisia.http://www.tunisiaproduction.com/ Further, survey work on the site was done by a team led by Mensun Bound, but unfortunately no further excavations have been possible. Cargo The ship was presumably driven by a storm onto the north African coast en route from Piraeus, the port of Athens, to Italy, as it was carrying Greek works of art intended for Roman purchasers, marble and bronze sculptures, high-quality furniture fittings, decorative items and architectural elements. These were later restored by researchers from the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn in Germany. There were also several dozen heavy marble columns and parts of catapults. It has been generally thought that the marble columns were removed and shipped by order of Lucius Cornelius Sulla after his sacking of Athens in 86 BC. None of the epic-scaled Homeric figures that gained popularity in the 1st century BC were to be found, nor any copies of Classical works of the 5th century, as Nikolaus Himmelmann pointed out, contrasting the Mahdia cargo with the similar cargo of the somewhat later Antikythera ship.Himmelmann 1995, noted in Ridgway 2002.

Scholars believe that the name refers to Goguryeo and translates to \\"Goguryeo zither\\" or that it refers to the colour and translates to \\"black crane zither\\" (hyeonhakgeum, ÌòÑÌïôÍ∏à / ÁéÑÈ∂¥Áê¥). The geomungo's place in Korean culture is traditionally that of a scholars instrument for self-cultivation, much like ancient Chinese had done with the guqin in China. History An 11-stringed modern geomungo The instrument originated circa the 4th century (see Anak Tomb No.3 infra) through the 7th century from the kingdom of Goguryeo, the northernmost of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, although the instrument can be traced back to the 4th century. According to the Samguk Sagi (Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms), written in 1145, the geomungo was invented by prime minister Wang San-ak by using the form of the ancient Chinese instrument guqin (gogeum, also called chilhyeongeum, literally \\"seven-string zither\\"). After his death, the instrument was passed down to Ok Bogo, Son Myeong-deuk, Gwi Geum, An Jang, Cheong Jang, and Geuk Jong, while being widely spread over the kingdom. Archetype of the instrument is painted in Goguryeo tombs. They are found in the tomb of Muyongchong and Anak Tomb No.3. Construction The geomungo is approximately 162 cm long and 23 cm wide (63.75 inches long, 9 inches wide), and has movable bridges called Anjok and 16 convex frets. It has a hollow body where the front plate of the instrument is made of paulownia wood and the back plate is made of hard chestnut wood. Its six strings, which are made of twisted silk passed through its back plate. The pick is made from bamboo sticks in the size of regular household pencil. Three strings are directly over the frets which can be stopped whilst the other three are open strings. Modernized geomungo increases the strings to 11, which are made of nylon. As with the traditional version, three strings are over the frets and the others are all open. But the traditional version of the geomungo has 6 strings, with three over the frets. Recently, the 6-string Geomungo has been improved quite a lot, with the appearance of electronic geomungo (Ï†ÑÏûê Í±∞Î¨∏Í≥†). Geomungo playing with Hwaldae bow (ÌôúÎåÄ Í±∞Î¨∏Í≥†) (same as playing ajaeng), or the type of geomungo having more strings, collected; attracted the attention of young artists. In the development of culture, besides the conservation artists, inheriting the cultural tradition of the nation, there are artists who change and modernize the traditional culture of the nation. Playing method The geomungo is generally played while seated on the floor. The strings are plucked with a short bamboo stick called suldae, which is held between the index and middle fingers of the right hand, while the left-hand presses on the strings by either pulling or pushing to produce various pitches. The most typical tuning of the open strings for the traditional Korean music is D#/Eb, G#/Ab, C, A#/Bb, A#/Bb, and A#/Bb an octave lower than the central tone. The instrument is played in traditional Korean court music and the folk styles of sanjo and sinawi. Due to its characteristically percussive sound and vigorous playing technique it is thought of as a more \\"masculine\\" instrument than the 12-string or 24 string gayageum (another Korean zither); both instruments, however, are played by both male and female performers. The geomungo has a large range of playable songs and also has a large range of tunes. The Korean-born, U.S. resident geomungo performer and composer Jin Hi Kim plays a custom-made electric geomungo in addition to the regular instrument.photo See also *Korean music *List of Korea-related topics *Traditional Korean musical instruments  References External links *Korea Society Podcast: Reinventing Traditional Korean Music - Geomungo Performance Goguryeo Korean musical instruments Zithers Important Intangible Cultural Properties of South Korea Asian musical instruments ","title":"Geomungo"},{"id":"626813","text":"Location Exterior view Interior view Balvenie Castle is a ruined castle 1 km north of Dufftown in the Moray region of Scotland. History Originally known as Mortlach, it was built in the 12th century by a branch of the powerful Comyn family (the Black Comyns) and was extended and altered in the 15th and 16th centuries. The castle fell out of use following an attack by Robert the Bruce in 1308, which left the property uninhabitable. At some point in the 14th century the castle and estates of Balvenie passed to the Earl of Douglas. Nothing is documented as to how the Black Douglases first acquired the castle but the most likely account is that it came with the marriage of the heiress Joanna Murray to Archibald 'the Grim' , 3rd Earl of Douglas in 1362. His son and successor Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas granted his younger brother James Douglas, 7th Earl of Douglas, latterly known as James 'the Gross' , the lordship of Balvenie in 1408. James's main residence was at Abercorn Castle, a coastal fortress to the west of Edinburgh and Balvenie Castle's use was as temporary accommodation when the need arose. In 1440, William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas was killed by James the Gross, probably in a conspiracy with William Crichton and Alexander Livingston of Callendar, the guardians of the then child-king James II. James 'the Gross then became the 7th earl. James immediately provided the lordship of Balvenie with its castle to his youngest son, John Douglas, Lord of Balvenie. Earl James's death in 1443 signaled a resumption of the hostility between the royal Stewarts and the Black Douglases. The Battle of Arkinholm in May 1455 saw the defeat of this, the main Douglas line by an army loyal to James II. All of their lands and titles were forfeited to the Crown, including Balvenie Castle. King James divided up the estates among his supporters, which included the Douglas Earl of Angus and provided Balvenie Castle to Sir John Stewart, who later became the first Earl of Atholl. William Duff committed suicide in the castle in 1718 and it was effectively abandoned at that point. It was used by Hanoverian forces as an encampment in 1746 during the second Jacobite rebellion.The Castles of Scotland, Martin Coventry Today, the remains of the castle are managed by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument. However, ownership continues in private hands; the current owner is Jeremy Duncan Nicholson, Baron of Balvenie, who resides in Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. The castle is open to the public from the beginning of April to the end of September. Balvenie whisky is produced by William Grant & Sons at the Balvenie distillery down the hill from the castle.

The card contains a tuner and an analog-to- digital converter (collectively known as the analog front end) along with demodulation and interface logic. Some lower-end cards lack an onboard processor and, like a Winmodem, rely on the system's CPU for demodulation. Types There are many types of tuner cards. =Analog tuners= Analog television cards output a raw video stream, suitable for real-time viewing but ideally requiring some sort of video compression if it is to be recorded. Some cards also have analog input (composite video or S-Video) and many also provide a radio tuner. An early example was the Aapps Corp. MicroTV for Apple Macintosh II, which debuted in 1989.InfoWorld - Aug 7, 1989 More-advanced TV tuners encode the signal to Motion JPEG or MPEG, relieving the main CPU of this load. =Digital tunersHybrid tuners= A hybrid tuner has one tuner that can be configured to act as an analog tuner or a digital tuner. Switching between the systems is fairly easy, but cannot be done immediately. The card operates as a digital tuner or an analog tuner until reconfigured. =Combo tuners= This is similar to a hybrid tuner, except there are two separate tuners on the card. One can watch analog while recording digital, or vice versa. The card operates as an analog tuner and a digital tuner simultaneously. The advantages over two separate cards are cost and utilization of expansion slots in the computer. As many regions around the world convert from analog to digital broadcasts, these tuners are gaining popularity. Like the analog cards, the Hybrid and Combo tuners can have specialized chips on the tuner card to perform the encoding, or leave this task to the CPU. The tuner cards with this 'hardware encoding' are generally thought of as being higher quality. Small USB tuner sticks have become more popular in 2006 and 2007 and are expected to increase in popularity. These small tuners generally do not have hardware encoding due to size and heat constraints. While most TV tuners are limited to the radio frequencies and video formats used in the country of sale, many TV tuners used in computers use DSP, so a firmware upgrade is often all that's necessary to change the supported video format. Many newer TV tuners have flash memory big enough to hold the firmware sets for decoding several different video formats, making it possible to use the tuner in many countries without having to flash the firmware. However, while it is generally possible to flash a card from one analog format to another due to the similarities, it is generally not possible to flash a card from one digital format to another due to differences in decode logic necessary. Radio tuners Many TV tuners can function as FM radios; this is because there are similarities between broadcast television and FM radio. The FM radio spectrum is close to (or even inside) that used by VHF terrestrial TV broadcasts. And many broadcast television systems around the world use FM audio. So listening to an FM radio station is simply a case of configuring existing hardware. Mobile TV adapter External TV tuner card attachments are available for mobile phone handsets like the iPhone, for watching mobile TV, via TV stations on 1seg in Japan (SoftBank), and for soon for the proprietary subscription-based MediaFLO in the U.S. (Qualcomm). There is also a \\"converter\\" for watching DVB-H in Europe and elsewhere via WiFi streaming video (PacketVideo).  Video capture  Video capture cards are a class of video capture devices designed to plug directly into expansion slots in personal computers and servers. Models from many manufacturers are available; all comply with one of the popular host bus standards including PCI, newer PCI Express (PCIe) or AGP bus interfaces. These cards typically include one or more software drivers to expose the cards' features, via various operating systems, to software applications that further process the video for specific purposes. As a class, the cards are used to capture baseband analog composite video, S-Video, and, in models equipped with tuners, RF modulated video. Some specialized cards support digital video via digital video delivery standards including Serial Digital Interface (SDI) and, more recently, the emerging HDMI standard. These models often support both standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) variants. While most PCI and PCI- Express capture devices are dedicated to that purpose, AGP capture devices are usually included with the graphics adapted on the board as an all-in-one package. Unlike video editing cards, these cards tend to not have dedicated hardware for processing video beyond the analog-to-digital conversion. Most, but not all, video capture cards also support one or more channels of audio. New technologies allow PCI-Express and HD-SDI to be implemented on video capture cards at lower costs than before. An early example is the Mass Microsystems Colorspace FX card from 1989.InfoWorld - Jan 30, 1989 =Applications= There are many applications for video capture cards like EasyCap including converting a live analog source into some type of analog or digital media, (such as a VHS tape to a DVD), archiving, video editing, scheduled recording (such as a DVR), television tuning, or video surveillance. The cards may have significantly different designs to optimally support each of these functions. Capture cards can be used for recording a video game longplay (LP) so gamers can make walkthrough gameplay videos. One of the most popular applications for video capture cards is to capture video and audio for live Internet video streaming. The live stream can also be simultaneously archived and formatted for video on demand. The capture cards used for this purpose are typically purchased, installed, and configured in host PC systems by hobbyists or systems integrators. Some care is required to select suitable host systems for video encoding, particularly HD applications which are more affected by CPU performance, number of CPU cores, and certain motherboard characteristics that heavily influence capture performance.

Though ruined, it is one of the most extensive castles dating from the 13th century to survive in eastern Scotland, and was the seat of the Earls of Mar. It is owned today by Historic Environment Scotland and is open to the public as a scheduled ancient monument with gardens that are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. History The castle was probably built in the mid-13th century under Gilbert de Moravia. It has been posited that siting of Kildrummy Castle was influenced by the location of the Grampian Mounth trackway crossings, particularly the Elsick Mounth and Cryne Corse Mounth.C. Michael Hogan, Elsick Mounth, Megalithic Portal, ed A. Burnham Kildrummy Castle underwent siege numerous times in its history, first in defence of the family of Robert the Bruce in August‚ÄìSeptember 1306 (leading to the executions of Nigel Bruce and many other Scots), and again in 1335 by David of Strathbogie. On this occasion Christina Bruce held off the attackers until her husband Sir Andrew Murray came to her rescue. In the reign of David II, Walter Maule of Panmure was warden of Kildrummy Castle. In 1374 the castle's heiress Isobel was seized and married by Alexander Stewart, who then laid claim to Kildrummy and the title of Earl of Mar. In 1435 it was taken over by James I, becoming a royal castle until being granted to Lord Elphinstone in 1507. The castle passed from the Clan Elphinstone to the Clan Erskine before being abandoned in 1716 following the failure of the Jacobite Rising of 1715. In May 1585 Margaret Haldane, the wife of David Erskine, Commendator of Dryburgh, was held at Kildrummy in the custody of the Master of Elphinstone.Joseph Bain, Hamilton Papers, vol. 2 (London, 1896), p. 643. In 1645 Robert Farquharson of Invercauld was the keeper of Kildrummy Castle for the Earl of Mar and his son Lord Erskine. The laird of Glenkindie also helped to keep the castle, fearing the depredations that a garrison of outsider or \\"stranger\\" soldiers would make on his lands.HMC Mar & Kellie (London, 1904), pp. 201-2, 205. Architecture Kildrummy Castle is \\"shield-shaped\\" in plan with a number of independent towers. The flat side of the castle overlooks a steep ravine; moreover, on the opposite side of the castle the walls come to a point, which was once defended by a massive twin- towered gatehouse. The castle also had a keep, called the Snow Tower, taller than the other towers, built in the French style, as at Bothwell Castle. Extensive earthworks protected the castle, including a dry moat and the ravine. Most of the castle foundations are now visible, along with most of its lower-storey walls. Archaeological excavations in 1925 uncovered decorative stone flooring and evidence of battles. Today The castle was given into the care of the Ministry of Works in 1951, and is now owned by its successor organisation, Historic Environment Scotland. Kildrummy Castle gardens, in the quarry used to excavate stone for the castle, are both open to the public. A hotel (the Kildrummy Castle Hotel) has been built on the old estate, overlooking the ruins. Kildrummy Castle was the venue for the Scottish Sculpture Open, sometimes known as the Kildrummy Open, organised by the Scottish Sculpture Workshop from 1981 to 1997.

Below district (amphoe) and province (changwat), they form the third administrative subdivision level. there were 7,255 tambons, not including the 180 khwaeng of Bangkok, which are set at the same administrative level, thus every district contains eight to ten tambon. Tambon is usually translated as \\"township\\" or \\"subdistrict\\" in English  the latter is the recommended translation, though also often used for king amphoe, the designation for a subdistrict acting as a branch (Thai: king) of the parent district. Tambon are further subdivided into 69,307 villages (muban), about ten per tambon. Tambon within cities or towns are not subdivided into villages, but may have less formal communities called chumchon (‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏ô) that may be formed into community associations. Office of TAO Bang Bai Mai, Surat Thani History The tambon as a subdivision has a long history. It was the second-level subdivision of the area administered by a provincial town in the 19th century. The governor of the province was supposed to appoint a communal elder, kamnan or phan. In the administrative reforms started in 1892 under Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, the first Thai Minister of the Interior, the three levels of subdivision of provinces were continued, i.e., starting from district to tambon to the lowest level called muban. = Muban = The subdistricts are subdivided into administrative villages (muban, ) as the lowest administrative subdivision. Usually these are referred to much more often by the village number than the actual name, especially as an administrative village may contain more than one settlement, or a large settlement may be split into more than one administrative village. One of the elected village headmen is elected as the subdistrict headman (Kamnan). = Subdistrict administrative organization (TAO)= With the Tambon Council and Tambon Administrative Authority Act BE 2537 (1994) and later by the constitution of 1997, tambon were decentralized into local government units with an elected tambon council. Depending on its size and tax income a tambon may either be administered by a Subdistrict (Tambon) Administrative Organization (SAO or TAO, ) or a Tambon Council (TC, ). However, since 2001 all of the Tambon Councils have been upgraded to Tambon Administrative Organizations. The TAO council consist of two representatives from each administrative village in the subdistrict, and one directly elected president. The subdistrict area which belongs to a municipality (thesaban) is administered by the municipal council. In the event only part of the subdistrict is within a municipality, the remaining part is administrated by a TAO. Adjoining subdistricts of a single district can also have a joint TAO. = One Tambon One Product = In 2001, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra started a project in which every tambon would select a typical, distinctive local product. The project then aids in promoting the product, as well as assisting in modernizing production. Shops selling OTOP products are located in each provincial capital.

Morel was as a commander of concentration camps run by the NKVD and Polish communist authorities until 1956. In 1944 Morel became warden of the Soviet NKVD prison at Lublin Castle. During most of 1945 he was commander of the Zgoda labour camp in ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice, Poland. In 1949 he was made commander of Jaworzno concentration camp and remained a commandant of numerous concentration camps until they were all closed down in 1956 following the Polish October. He then worked as head of a prison in Katowice and was promoted to the rank colonel in the political police, the MBP. He was dismissed during the 1968 Polish political crisis which saw the purging of ex-Stalinists. Beginning in the early 1990s Morel was investigated by authorities for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the murder of more than 1,500 prisoners from Upper Silesia, most of from the local population. In 1996, he was indicted by Poland on charges of torture, war crimes, crimes against humanity and communist crimes. After his case was publicized by the Polish, German, British, and American media, Morel fled to Israel and was granted citizenship under the Law of Return. Poland twice requested his extradition, once in 1998 and once in 2004, but Israel refused to comply and rejected the more serious charges as being false and again rejected extradition on the grounds that the statute of limitations against Morel had run out and that Morel was in poor health. Polish authorities responded by accusing Israel of applying a double standard, and the controversy over Morel's extradition continued until his death. Background and youth Salomon Morel was born on November 15, 1919 in the village of Garb√≥w near Lublin, Poland, the son of a Jewish baker. During the Great Depression, the family business began to falter. Therefore, Morel moved to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ where he worked as a sales clerk, but returned to Garb√≥w following the outbreak of war in September 1939. World War II and early NKVD service Morel's family went into hiding during World War II in order to avoid being placed in the ghetto. Morel's mother, father and one brother were killed by the Blue Police during Christmas of 1942. Solomon Morel and his brother Izaak survived the Holocaust hidden by J√≥zef Tkaczyk, a Polish Catholic. In 1983, J√≥zef Tkaczyk was designated as one of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem for saving the Morel brothers. Morrel's two brothers died during the war, one in 1943, another in 1945. According to the IPN, as the Eastern Front advanced, Morel and other communist partisans came out of hiding. In the summer of 1944, Morel joined the Milicja Obywatelska in Lublin. Later, he became a warden at the Lublin Castle, where many soldiers of the anti- communist Armia Krajowa (Home Army) were imprisoned and tortured. http://polska1918-89.pl/pdf/23-lata,-6-miesiecy-i-22-dni-salomona- morela,5751.pdf The Israeli mass media and government presented yet a different version of his life. The Israeli letter rejecting extradition states that Morel joined the partisans of the Red Army in 1942, and was in the forests when his parents, sister-in-law, and one brother were allegedly killed by Blue Police. According to a number of media sources, Morel claimed that he was at one point an inmate in Auschwitz and over thirty of his relatives were killed in the Holocaust. Commander of Zgoda labour camp Memorial to the victims of \\"totalitarian violence inflicted by the Nazi and the Communist regimes\\" in front of the former main gate of Zgoda camp, with text in Polish, German and English On March 15, 1945, Morel became commander of the infamous Zgoda camp in ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice. The Zgoda camp was set up by the Soviet political police, or NKVD, after the Soviet Army entered southern Poland. In February 1945 the camp was handed over to the Polish Ministry of Public Security. Most prisoners in the camp were Silesians and German citizens, while a small number were from \\"central Poland\\", and about 38 foreigners. Sometimes children were sent to the camp along with parents. Prisoners were not accused of any crime, but were sent by decision of Security Authorities. Authorities tried to convince society that prisoners were only ethnic Germans and former Nazi war criminals and collaborators. Keith Lowe notes that \\"in reality almost anyone could end up there\\" and the memorial in front of the camp's main gate describes the prisoners as mainly local population. It is estimated that close to 2,000 inmates died in the camp where torture and abuse of prisoners were chronic and rampant and resulted in an average 100 inmate deaths a day. Solomon Morel's preferred method of torture was the ice water tank where prisoners would be put in with freezing water up to their necks until they died. The camp was closed in November 1945. The survivor Dorota Boriczek described Morel as \\"a barbaric and cruel man\\" who often personally tortured and killed prisoners. Gerhard Gruschka, a local Upper Silesian of Polish descent, was imprisoned in Zgoda when he was 14 years old and wrote a book about his experiences, detailing the endemic torture and abuse in the camp. Morel was also accused of an extensive pattern of sadistic torture in John Sack's book An Eye for an Eye: The Untold Story of Jewish Revenge Against Germans in 1945, which contributed to publicizing his case in the Anglophone world in the 1990s. Historians Nicholas A. Robins and Adam Jones note that Morel \\"presided over a murderous regime founded on ubiquitous assaults and atrocities against German captives.\\" Keith Lowe notes that \\"when millions of bruised and destitute refugees began flooding into Germany in the autumn of 1945, they brought with them some disturbing stories of places they called 'hell camps', 'death camps' and 'extermination camps'\\". Zgoda camp was among the most notorious of these camps, and is discussed in detail by Lowe. Lowe notes that survivors' stories of Zgoda and other camps had a profound impact on West German society and that their stories were taken extremely seriously by the German government and the general population as examples of Stalinist brutality. Commander of Jaworzno concentration camp Memorial plate at the Stalinist-era Jaworzno concentration camp (1945‚Äì1956) From February 1949 to November 1951 Morel was commander of Jaworzno concentration camp, a Stalinist- era concentration camp for political prisoners (designated \\"enemies of the nation\\") in Poland. By that time he already had a reputation in Poland as an \\"exceptional sadist.\\"Wzorowy polski ≈Çagier, Polityka During Morel's time as the commandant the prisoners were primarily Poles who were arrested for their opposition to Stalinism, and included soldiers of the Polish Home Army and members of other Polish underground resistance organisations such as Freedom and Independence that was active from 1945 to 1952. Prisoners were often tortured and subjected to forced labor. Morel left the camp when it was turned into a camp for adolescent political prisoners.Stalinowskie obozy pracy w Polsce (Polskie Radio)Kazimierz Miroszewski, Zygmunt Wo≈∫niczka, Ob√≥z dw√≥ch totalitaryzm√≥w. Jaworzno 1943-1956, Jaworzno 2007 Later career Morel continued working as commandant of Stalinist-era concentration camps until 1956. When the Polish October weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland, the Stalinist concentration camps were closed down.Kemp-Welch, Tony. \\"Dethroning Stalin: Poland 1956 and its Legacy\\". Europe-Asia Studies 58(2006): 1261‚Äì84. After 1956, Morel worked in various prisons in Silesia and was promoted to the rank of colonel in the political police, the MBP. In the 1960s he was head of a prison in Katowice. In 1964 he defended his master's degree with a thesis on the economic value of forced labor at Wroc≈Çaw University's Law School. During the 1950s, the Polish communist government awarded him the Cavalry Cross of the Polonia Restituta and the Golden Cross of Merit. =Dismissal= Morel was dismissed from his position in May 1968 in the wake of the 1968 Polish political crisis, which saw the purging of both Jewish officials and ex-Stalinists.Dariusz Stola, Kampania antysyjonistyczna w Polsce 1967‚Äì1968, pp. 79‚Äì114 As Morel was both Jewish and had a background as head of Stalinist-era concentration camps, he became an obvious target for the 1968 campaign. Unlike most other Polish Jews, and although the Polish communist government pressured Jews to emigrate, Morel nevertheless chose to remain in Poland, and lived there as a retiree from the age of 49. Criminal prosecution In 1990, after the fall of communism, the General Commission for the Investigation of Crimes against the Polish Nation, precursor to the Institute of National Remembrance, started investigating the abuses carried out at the Zgoda camp.Poles Review Postwar Treatment of Germans, The New York Times, 1994 Fearing prosecution, Morel immigrated to Israel in 1992. =Indictment= In 1996 Salomon Morel was formally indicted of genocide by the Polish public prosecutor's office.Arkadiusz Morawiec, \\"Jaworzno. Invisibility\\", Acta Universitatis Lodziensis, Folia Litteraria Polonica 8(46) 2017 The indictment was later amended to include war crimes, crimes against humanity and communist crimes. The latter charge was added in 2004 and constitutes a specific crime under Polish criminal law. =Extradition controversy= In 1998, Poland requested that Morel be extradited for trial, but Israel refused. A reply sent to the Polish Justice Ministry from the Israeli government said that Israel would not extradite Mr. Morel as the statute of limitations had expired on war crimes. In April 2004, Poland filed another extradition request against Morel, this time with fresh evidence, upgrading the case to \\"communist crimes against the population.\\" The main charge against Salomon Morel was that, as commandant of the Zgoda camp at ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice, he created for the prisoners in this camp, out of ethnic and political considerations, conditions that jeopardised their lives, including starvation and torture. The charges against Morel were based primarily on the evidence of over 100 witnesses, including 58 former inmates of the Zgoda camp. In July 2005 this request was again formally refused by the Israeli government. The response rejected the more serious charges as being false, potentially part of an antisemitic conspiracy, and again rejected extradition on the grounds that the statute of limitations against Morel had run out, and that Morel was in poor health. Ewa Koj, a prosecutor with the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, criticized the decision. ‚ÄúThere should be one measure for judging war criminals, whether they are German, Israeli or of any other nationality,‚Äù Koj said. Morel died in Tel Aviv on February 14, 2007, seventeen years after the investigation and prosecution of him started. =Legacy= Anne Applebaum describes Morel as > a Holocaust victim, a communist criminal, a man who lost his entire family > to the Nazis, a man consumed by a sadistic fury against Germans and Poles ‚Äì > a fury which may or may not have originated from his victimhood, and may or > may not have been connected to his communism. He was deeply vengeful, and > profoundly violent. He was awarded medals by the communist Polish state, was > prosecuted by the post-communist Polish state, and was defended by the > Israeli state, though he had expressed no interest in moving to Israel until > half a century after the war, and even then only after he started to fear > prosecution.

An early activist during the Second Polish Republic, in post-war communist Poland he was a member of the Politburo of the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) and then of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR). Alongside President Boles≈Çaw Bierut, Berman was responsible for party oversight of the Stalinist Ministry of Public Security, commonly known as the \\"UB\\". From 1948, he was considered the second most powerful politician in Poland after Bierut, until removed from power in 1956, following Bierut's death. Early career Jakub Berman was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Warsaw on 23 December 1901. His younger brother was Adolf Berman. Jakub became a member of the Communist Youth Union and in 1928 joined the Communist Party of Poland (KPP). He was arrested a few times, but unlike many other activists, had not been imprisoned for a prolonged period.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], p. 27.

Berman's academic adviser, Marxist sociologist Prof. Ludwik Krzywicki, wanted to hire Berman at the university as his assistant, but it was not allowed because of Berman's Jewish origin. Krzywicki's efforts to find Berman a mainstream non-university job also failed and Berman ended up working for a Jewish agency, in a poorly paid position.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 28‚Äì29. The family was supported largely by Berman's wife, Gustawa n√©e Grynberg, who was a well-regarded physician and dentist.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], p. 21. Berman's social contacts in Warsaw included many communism-sympathizing members of Polish intelligentsia; Janina and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Broniewski, as well as Wanda Wasilewska, were among his associates.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 45‚Äì51. In 1935‚Äì36, he worked with Aleksander Wat (as his tutor on behalf of the KPP) in an attempt to establish a leftist periodical, intended to result from cooperation of the communists with other leftist forces in Poland (mostly the Polish Socialist Party (PPS)) within the Popular Front.Marci Shore, Caviar and Ashes, pp. 108‚Äì109. Yale University Press, New Haven, 2006. . World War II On 6 September 1939, after the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, Berman followed government directions for \\"able-bodied men\\" and took a train going in the eastern direction.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], p. 38. He went to Bia≈Çystok, by that time occupied by the Soviet Union. With his friend Alfred Lampe, Berman was active in Polish-communist circles there and became a Soviet citizen. In March 1941 he moved to Minsk, where he worked as an editor at Sztandar Wolno≈õci ('The Banner of Freedom'), a Polish-language bulletin published by the Communist Party of Byelorussia. Berman's doctoral dissertation, written under the direction of Krzywicki and entitled O strukturze miast polskich na podstawie spisu ludno≈õci w 1791 r. ('On the structure of Polish cities based on the population census of 1791'), was brought to Bia≈Çystok by his friend and colleague Irena Sawicka, but burned in Minsk when a dormitory where Berman and other journalists were housed was bombed by the Germans.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 51‚Äì55. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Berman escaped to Moscow. Later he became an instructor at the Comintern school in Kushnarenkovo near Ufa, where he trained displaced Polish communists, activists for the new Soviet-sponsored Polish Workers' Party (PPR).Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 57‚Äì63. With the help from Georgi Dimitrov and Jerzy Borejsza, Berman was able to bring there his wife and daughter Lucyna. In December 1943, Berman met Joseph Stalin at a Kremlin reception for activists of the Union of Polish Patriots (ZPP). He gained Stalin's trust and became a prominent figure among the Polish communists in the Soviet Union (according to Berman, Stalin hated him).Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 74‚Äì79. Political career in communist-ruled Poland In the summer of 1944, Berman joined the Politburo of the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) and returned to Poland. In Lublin, at the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), Berman practically led the foreign affairs department; it was concerned primarily with securing international recognition for the new communist-led governing entity.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 101‚Äì102. In January 1945, as soon as Warsaw was liberated, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland (formerly the PKWN) moved from Lublin to Praga district of Warsaw. Berman, as a member of the Politburo of the PPR, was charged with oversight of the state security apparatus (the Ministry of Public Security).Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 104‚Äì111.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 119‚Äì120. In post-war Poland Berman organized state censorship, supervised the development of and permissions for political parties and organizations, and was the main liaison between the PPR and the PKWN. Berman's decisions had to be consulted with and could be vetoed by two resident Soviet advisers, who remained in Poland until 1953 and 1954. From 1948, together with Boles≈Çaw Bierut, general secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), a successor of the PPR, and economist Hilary Minc, Berman formed a triumvirate of Stalinist leaders of Poland. According to Lucyna Tych, Berman's daughter, all three \\"Stalinist\\" leaders sought to implement communism in Poland in ways different from the manner in which it was done earlier in the Soviet Union (while remaining entirely loyal to the Soviet leadership). Berman and Minc were close friends and partners. They successfully cooperated in protecting Poland's economic interests. For example, after their repeated interventions with the Soviets, the practice of dismantling industrial equipment in Poland and taking it to the Soviet Union was discontinued. They were somehow able to fend off Soviet attempts to introduce broader (Soviet-like) railroad tracks in Poland, which would cut-off Poland's transportation links with Germany and the West.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 114‚Äì115. In late 1949, Stalin attempted to remove Berman from his position of power, accusing him of participation in an international anti-communist conspiracy and illicit foreign contacts, but the effort somehow did not succeed.Jerzy Eisler, Siedmiu wspania≈Çych. Poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR [The Magnificent Seven: first secretaries of the PZPR], pp. 36‚Äì37. Wydawnictwo Czerwone i Czarne, Warszawa 2014, . In August 1951, Gomu≈Çka was arrested, probably on Stalin's and Lavrentiy Beria's orders; they demanded his quick trial. Berman and Bierut, however, were able to keep delaying the proceedings, to the point that the trial never took place. Berman became a member of the Politburo of the PZPR and remained in that capacity until 1956. He was responsible for science, literature and cultural affairs, propaganda and ideology. From 1949 to 1953, he was officially and personally involved in the fight for the dominant position of socialist realism in art and literature, but in the post-war years he also helped and cultivated contacts with many Polish artistic personalities and his influence was essential to the establishment and continuous existence of such Polish mainstream institutions as the Czytelnik publishing house or Cepelia chain of craft stores. The canon of classical Polish literature was published and the production of memorable films commenced.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 130‚Äì136. Berman helped Tadeusz Sygiety≈Ñski organize the folk ensemble Mazowsze.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 140‚Äì141. Following Berman's repeated interventions with Vyacheslav Molotov and other Soviet authorities, the Ossolineum collections were transferred from Lviv to Wroc≈Çaw in 1946 and 1947.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], p. 150. In the spring of 1955, Berman authorized the creation of the Crooked Circle Club, a free discussion forum in Warsaw, which marked the gradual departure from Stalinism.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 158‚Äì164. While Berman was one of the officials responsible for party oversight of the security apparatus, at least 200,000 people were imprisoned and some 6,000 executed on political charges. Hundreds of former members of the Polish resistance movement in World War II were persecuted, especially from the Home Army and the National Armed Forces. Fall from power In 1952, Anna Duracz, Berman's secretary, was arrested. In 1954, he was attacked during a party plenum by Aleksander Zawadzki, who claimed that as originating from a bourgeois Jewish family, Berman lacked the proper understanding of the Polish workers' movement. After the death of First Secretary Bierut, Berman resigned from the PZPR Politburo (and from the position of first deputy prime minister) in May 1956.Jerzy Eisler, Siedmiu wspania≈Çych. Poczet pierwszych sekretarzy KC PZPR [The Magnificent Seven: first secretaries of the PZPR], p. 120. He was earlier incriminated by J√≥zef ≈öwiat≈Ço, a former official in the Ministry of Public Security, who defected to the West. Berman was relieved from the Central Committee of the PZPR in the fall of 1956 and in May 1957, in the aftermath of the Polish October, dismissed from the party altogether. He attempted to get his membership reinstated, wrote appeals in 1960 and 1964, but was rejected on both occasions.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], p. 167. He was considered responsible for the \\"Stalinist-era errors and distortions\\" by which they meant dogmatic and sectarian party attitudes and breaking the rule of law.Andrzej Werblan, Szkice i polemiki [Sketches and polemics], p. 172, published in 1970 by KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, Warsaw Retirement For two years he remained without steady employment and supported himself by accepting various assignments, such as translations of works by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In September 1958, Berman was placed by the party in the state-run KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza ('Book and Knowledge') publishing house, where he worked until he was retired by the authorities in 1968. His wife was removed from her position at the Rheumatology Institute.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], p. 202. For the first time, according to his daughter Lucyna Tychowa, Berman could enjoy normal life with his family and friends. He engaged in activities, such as reading or attending films and theatrical productions. In the fall of 1981, he was hit by a car and permanently injured while he attempted to cross a street. He died in Warsaw in April 1984 and was buried at PowƒÖzki Cemetery.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 208‚Äì212.  Notes  a. Berman told a story to Teresa Tora≈Ñska, by whom he was interviewed in the early 1980s. Afterwards, he requested that Tora≈Ñska refrains from printing it, because he was concerned that his revelations may reflect badly on Bierut, \\"a noble man\\". Tora≈Ñska published the account anyway. In November 1949, at Belweder Palace, Bierut wanted to give Berman investigation files concerning cases of officers accused of political crimes, because he wanted Berman's opinion on the matter. Berman declined to take the files, because he considered them contrived and worthless. He asked Bierut to make sure that no death sentences are issued based on such evidence. Berman soon regretted not having taken the files and cooperated with Bierut's procedure. Bierut, who normally followed his advice, this time did not and twenty death sentences were eventually carried out. \\"Unfortunately\\", lamented Berman, \\"he believed in those papers too much\\".Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 115‚Äì116. b. The degree and nature of Berman's involvement with the state security apparatus are matters of controversy. It is not known whether his was kept currently informed by Minister Stanis≈Çaw Radkiewicz and his people, or whether they saw him, an idealistic communist, as an impediment to their operation. According to the testimony of people familiar with Berman in this role, he often alleviated the cruelties of the system. He had no formal decision-making capacity, which rested with Gomu≈Çka and Bierut, or with Radkiewicz at the operational level. On the other hand, as the communist regime struggled to contain the armed underground in the mid-1040s, Berman lobbied for an expansion of state security. Berman is also believed to be responsible for the lessening of political repression, which began in the later 1940s.Lucyna Tychowa and Andrzej Romanowski, Tak, jestem c√≥rkƒÖ Jakuba Bermana [Yes, I'm the Daughter of Jakub Berman], pp. 117‚Äì121. Berman, responsible for culture, was despised by the literary circles and others, on whom he had imposed harsh censorship and other restrictions. After the death of Bierut, Berman's adversaries produced highly negative written evaluations of him in printed media and he quickly became a scapegoat for all the misdeeds of the Stalinist period. A \\"good Bierut and bad Berman\\" stereotype was created.

It was the ancestral home of the chief of Clan Gordon, Earl of Huntly. History Architecturally the L plan castle consists of a well-preserved five-storey tower with an adjoining great hall and supporting buildings. Areas of the original ornate facade and interior stonework remain. A mound in the grounds of the castle is all that remains of an earlier 12th century motte. Originally named Strathbogie, the castle was granted to Sir Adam Gordon of Huntly in the 14th century. King Robert the Bruce was a guest of the castle in 1307 prior to his defeat of the Earl of Buchan. It was fired in 1452 by a force under the command of Archibald Douglas, Earl of Moray. In 1449 the king was at war with the powerful Black Douglases, the Gordons stood on the king's side and, with their men involved in the south of the country, the Earl of Moray, a brother of the Earl of Douglas, took the opportunity to sack the Gordon lands, setting Huntly Castle ablaze. The Gordons returned and quickly destroyed their enemies. Although the castle was burned to the ground, a grander castle was built in its place. In 1496, the pretender to the English throne, Perkin Warbeck, was married to Lady Catherine Gordon the daughter of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, witnessed by King James IV of Scotland at Edinburgh. James IV came to Huntly in October 1501 and gave gifts of money to the stonemasons working on the castle. In October 1503, James IV came again and played in a shooting contest at a \\"prop\\", and he came back again in the following October. These visits were part of his annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Duthac at Tain.Accounts Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.2 (1900), p.xlix-l, 124, 401, 464: for \\"prop\\" see Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue William MacKintosh was executed on 23August 1550 at Castle Strathbogie. Carved inscriptions feature on the facade Wings were added to the castle in the 16th and 17th centuries. The English diplomat Thomas Randolph stayed two nights in September 1562, and wrote that the castle was \\"fayer, beste furnishede of anye howse that I have seen in thys countrie.\\"CSP.

George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly died after the Battle of Corrichie, and the castle was garrisoned for Mary, Queen of Scots by Charles Crawfurd and twenty soldiers.

The Earl suffered a stroke, or a collapse caused by food-poisoning, while playing football outside the Castle on the Green. He was taken through the outer-gate to his bedchamber in the round tower of the palace block, which was then called the \\"New Warke of Strathbogie.\\" The Earl's bedchamber was adjacent to his \\"Grit Chalmer\\", the Great Chamber. After the Earl died, his body was laid out in the \\"Chamber of Dais\\", another name for the Great Chamber, and his valuables were secured in the bedchamber. After the Earl's steward left the Castle a number of alleged supernatural events occurred beginning with the sudden collapse of one of the servants in the \\"Laich Chalmer\\", Low Chamber. This \\"Laich Chalmer\\" was in another part of the castle, under a stair opposite the \\"Auld Hall.\\" On the following day a servant went up to the Gallery at the top of the \\"New Warke\\" where spices (which were precious) were stored. This servant and two companions also collapsed and when revived complained of feeling cold. After the Earl's body was embalmed and taken to the chapel, his brother sat on a bench in the Hall by the Great Chamber door, and heard unexplained sounds from the chamber. It was said that \\"there is not a live thing bigger than a mouse may enter in that chamber with the door locked.\\"Pitcairn, Robert ed., Bannatyne's Memorials of the Transactions in Scotland (1834), 334-5: McKean, Charles, The Scottish Chateau (Sutton, 2001), 109.

In 1640 the Castle was occupied by the Scottish Covenantor army under Major-General Robert Monro (d. 1680). James Gordon Parson of Rothiemay tells us how the house \\"was preserved from being rifled or defaced, except some emblems and imagery, which looked somewhat popish and superstitious lycke; and therefore, by the industry of one captain James Wallace (one of Munro's foote captaines) were hewd and brocke doune off the frontispiece of the house; but all the rest of the frontispiece containing Huntly's scutcheon, etc, was left untouched, as it stands to this daye.\\" Captured in October 1644, the castle was briefly held by James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose against the Duke of Argyll. In 1647 it was gallantly defended against General David Leslie by Lord Charles Gordon, but its 'Irish' garrison was starved into surrender. Savage treatment was meted out, for the men were hanged and their officers beheaded. In December of the same year the Marquess of Huntly himself was captured and on his way to execution at Edinburgh was detained, by a refinement of cruelty, in his own mansion. His escort were shot against its walls. An inventory made by the garrison shows the state rooms were still fully furnished including the earl's 'chapel bed'.Michael Pearce, '\\"Beds of 'Chapel\\" form in sixteenth-century Scottish inventories: the worst sort of beds', Regional Furniture, vol. 27 (2013), pp. 84-5: Michael Pearce, Whispers from An Age Gone By', Historic Scotland Magazine, (Winter 2016), pp. 16-18: Maria Hayward, Stuart Style (Yale, 2020), p.p. 244-5. In 1650 Charles II visited briefly on his way to the Battle of Worcester, defeat and exile. The Civil War brought an end to the Gordon of Huntly family's long occupation of the castle. In 1689, during the first Jacobite rising, the castle was briefly the headquarters for Viscount Dundee and his Jacobite army, at the end of April, just after the start of the revolt. However, by the early eighteenth century the castle was already in decay and providing material for predatory house builders in the village. In 1746, during a later Jacobite rising, it was occupied by British government troops. Thereafter, it became a common quarry until a groundswell of antiquarian sentiment in the 19th century came to the rescue of the noble pile. Huntly Castle remained under the ownership of the Clan Gordon until 1923. Today, the remains of the castle are cared for by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument. Pure Strength I, a major international strongman competition, was held on the grounds of Huntly Castle in 1987. The winner of the contest was J√≥n P√°ll Sigmarsson of Iceland.

The name \\"Herdwick\\" is derived from the Old Norse herdvyck, meaning sheep pasture. Though low in lambing capacity and perceived wool quality when compared to more common commercial breeds, Herdwicks are prized for their robust health, their ability to live solely on forage, and their tendency to be territorial and not to stray over the difficult upland terrain of the Lake District. It is considered that up to 99% of all Herdwick sheep are commercially farmed in the central and western Lake District. The wool of a Herdwick has unique qualities relating to durability. Thick bristle type fibres will often protrude from garments made from the wool, forming a protective layer in blizzards - most likely the same qualities that protect the sheep in similar conditions. Herdwicks have been known to survive under a blanket of snow for three days while eating their own wool.Davies, Hunter. A Walk Around the Lakes, Frances Lincoln Limited, 2009 (revised edition), p. 94 Severely threatened by the 2001 outbreak of foot-and- mouth disease in England and Wales, the breed has survived due to the intent to preserve this unique animal as a crucial part of traditional Lakeland agriculture. Still far fewer in number than most commercial breeds, Herdwicks survive largely due to farming subsidies. History=Early history= Herdwick tups (rams) are often kept together in bachelor flocks when not let out to cover the ewes. The root word of the breed's name, herdvyck, \\"sheep pasture\\", is recorded in documents dating back to the 12th century. The origin of the breed itself is unknown, but the most common theory is that the ancestors of Herdwick sheep were introduced by early Norse settlers. According to this, it was brought to the region somewhere between the 10th and 11th centuries during the Viking invasions of western England. Although a piece of local folklore once suggested that it came from a wrecked Spanish Armada ship, it appears that the Herdwick was an important breed in the Lake District by the end of the 12th century. For centuries, the husbandry of Herdwick sheep has been a large factor in shaping the culture and terrain of the Lake District. Topographically, grazing by sheep continues to keep the hillsides of fells largely treeless, and the ubiquitous dry stone walls of the valleys were built to protect grazing land and to confine livestock. Linguistically, many words of Lakeland speech relate to sheep husbandry. The ancient Yan Tan Tethera counting system for sheep is a survival of Brittonic counting systems. Beatrix Potter In the later years of her life (over 50), the children's author Beatrix Potter was involved with keeping and breeding Herdwicks, even acting as president of the breed association for a time. Between 1930 and 1938 she won a number of prizes for Herdwick ewes at shows across Cumbria. p. 124 Upon her death in 1943, she bequeathed fifteen farms - a total of approximately 4,000 acres (16 km¬≤) to the National Trust and, as per her instruction, all continue to graze Herdwick flocks. =Modern history= Herdwick lambs are born mostly black and lighten with age. In the modern era, the main industry of the Lake District has shifted from agriculture to tourism. The subsequent influx of tourists to the District has at times conflicted with traditional life, including the raising of Herdwicks. One Lake District farmer summed the problem up as, \\"We get 100,000 visitors across our land every year... If just one in a thousand forgets to shut a gate or can't be bothered, that's a hundred times we have to go out and round up our sheep.\\" In the late 20th century, the keeping of Herdwicks became economically unviable without outside support; open market prices for Herdwick fleeces sometimes drop as low as a penny a kilogram (which is about the weight of wool from a single sheep). Without direct monetary guarantees for wool prices from the National Trust, it actually costs farmers a considerably larger amount of money to shear their Herdwicks than they would receive in compensation; the majority of farmers once burned their fleeces as waste products. The Trust now acts as a wool merchant itself, thus being able to bargain for better prices directly with the British Wool Marketing Board and operate a Herdwick wool trademark. Most farmers survive through the sale of lambs, as well as both National Trust and European Union farm subsidies. Lake District farmers in particular receive subsidies for operating in a designated Less Favoured Area from the England Rural Development Programme. Those who agree to maintain their land in accordance with sustainable farming practices also receive additional subsidies. Herdwicks grazing in Cumbria Ninety-five percent of all 50,000 or so Herdwicks live within 14 miles of Coniston, Cumbria, and this makes them particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001 led to the destruction of many flocks, and to fears for the survival both of the breed and of the typical Lakeland sheep farming industry. Of the estimated 100,000 Herdwick sheep present before the outbreak, a full 25% were lost. They were not easily replaceable because long-standing herds are hefted so the introduction of new stock to the fells would have required extensive fencing. The call for vaccination rather than culling to preserve what is considered a part of the traditional identity of the fells and moors was led by parties such as the Duke of Westminster, Earl Peel, Lord Barnard and Lord Lonsdale, who wished to save the hill sheep on their lands. Many Lake District residents saw the breed as an indispensable icon of the region. Longtime resident and writer for The Guardian A.

The destruction of entire flocks meant that the shepherds were forced to undergo the process of again heafing (the local term for hefting) their new sheep to the hills. Normally, ewes teach this behaviour to their lambs, but with no more ewes left acquainted with a particular heaf the behaviour had to be taught all over again to new ewes, inevitably involving much rounding up of flocks that had strayed over the often inaccessible fells. Unheafed sheep might also cause overgrazing by wandering if they replaced the original Herdwicks. The Cumbria Hill Sheep Initiative was set up to \\"reassess the position and circumstances\\" in the aftermath of the disease; tough government restrictions in order to prevent another outbreak are still in place. In 2008, an Oregon sheep farmer began importing semen from Herdwick rams into the United States to begin a breeding programme using artificial insemination and designed to bring the breed to the country for the first time. In 2013, Lakeland Herdwick meat received a Protected Designation of Origin from the European Union. Characteristics Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, producing strongly flavoured lamb and mutton and a coarse, grey wool. The slowly maturing breed is one of the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her heaf (the local term for heft), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%. This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds. A Herdwick's grey fleece is not easily dyed and is coarse, so it is best suited to use as carpet wool. The wool is also an excellent natural insulator; it is possible to buy sheets of fireproofed wool to fit as loft insulation. Herdwick lamb and mutton has a very distinct taste, and was eaten at Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation banquet. Herdwick ewes also commonly produce desirable market lambs and mules by cross-breeding with Suffolk, Cheviot, Charollais and Texel sheep. Herdwick lambs are born black and, after a year, they lighten to a dark brown colour (the sheep are called hoggs or hoggets at this stage). After the first shearing, their fleece lightens further to grey. Rams are horned and ewes polled. For shows and auctions, Herdwicks traditionally have their wool ruddied up (the local term for raddled) with dye. Rams are also ruddied when put out with the ewes to show which have been mated and the dye is also one method (called a smit) of marking sheep for ownership. Before chemical dyes became available, this dye was made from either iron ore or graphite mixed with grease. For many years the legal method of identifying a particular shepherd's sheep were notches cut out of a sheep's ear, called lug marks - now replaced by ear tags.

A webcast may either be distributed live or on demand. Essentially, webcasting is \\"broadcasting\\" over the Internet. The largest \\"webcasters\\" include existing radio and TV stations, who \\"simulcast\\" their output through online TV or online radio streaming, as well as a multitude of Internet only \\"stations\\". Webcasting usually consists of providing non-interactive linear streams or events. Rights and licensing bodies offer specific \\"webcasting licenses\\" to those wishing to carry out Internet broadcasting using copyrighted material. Overview Webcasting is used extensively in the commercial sector for investor relations presentations (such as annual general meetings), in e-learning (to transmit seminars), and for related communications activities. However, webcasting does not bear much, if any, relationship to web conferencing, which is designed for many-to-many interaction. The ability to webcast using cheap/accessible technology has allowed independent media to flourish. There are many notable independent shows that broadcast regularly online. Often produced by average citizens in their homes they cover many interests and topics. Webcasts relating to computers, technology, and news are particularly popular and many new shows are added regularly. Webcasting differs from podcasting in that webcasting refers to live streaming while podcasting simply refers to media files placed on the Internet. History The earliest graphically-oriented web broadcasts were not streaming video, but were in fact still frames which were photographed with a web camera every few minutes while they were being broadcast live over the Internet. One of the earliest instances of sequential live image broadcasting was in 1991 when a camera was set up next to the Trojan Room in the computer laboratory of the University of Cambridge. It provided a live picture every few minutes of the office coffee pot to all desktop computers on that office's network. A couple of years later its broadcasts went to the Internet, became known as the Trojan Room Coffee Pot webcam, and gained international notoriety as a feature of the fledgling World Wide Web. Later in 1996 an American college student and conceptual artist, Jenny Ringley, set up a web camera similar to the Trojan Room Coffee Pot's webcam in her dorm room. That webcam photographed her every few minutes while it broadcast those images live over the Internet upon a site called JenniCam. Ringley wanted to portray all aspects of her lifestyle and the camera captured her doing almost everything ‚Äì brushing her teeth, doing her laundry, and even having sex with her boyfriend. Her website generated millions of hits upon the Internet, became a pay site in 1998, and spawned hundreds of female imitators who would then use streaming video to create a new billion dollar industry called camming, and brand themselves as camgirls or webcam models. One of the earliest webcast equivalent of an online concert and one of the earliest examples of webcasting itself was by Apple Computer's Webcasting Group in partnership with the entrepreneurs Michael Dorf and Andrew Rasiej. Together with David B. Pakman from Apple, they launched the Macintosh New York Music Festival from July 17‚Äì22, 1995. This event audio webcast concerts from more than 15 clubs in New York City. Apple later webcast a concert by Metallica on June 10, 1996 live from Slim's in San Francisco. In 1995, Benford E. Standley produced one of the first audio/video webcasts in history. On October 31, 1996, UK rock band Caduseus broadcast their one-hour concert from 11pm to 12midnight (UT) at Celtica in Machynlleth, Wales, UK ‚Äì the first live streamed audio and simultaneous live streamed video multicast ‚Äì around the globe to more than twenty direct \\"mirrors\\" in more than twenty countries. In September 1997, Nebraska Public Television started webcasting Big Red Wrap Up from Lincoln, Nebraska which combined highlights from every Cornhusker football game, coverage of the coaches' weekly press conferences, analysis with Nebraska sportswriters, appearances by special guests and questions and answers with viewers. On August 13, 1998, it is generally believed the first webcast wedding took place, between Alan K'necht and Carrie Silverman in Toronto Canada. On October 22, 1998, the first Billy Graham Crusade was broadcast live to a worldwide audience from the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida courtesy of Dale Ficken and the WebcastCenter in Pennsylvania. The live signal was broadcast via satellite to PA, then encoded and streamed via the BGEA website. The first teleconferenced/webcast wedding to date is believed to have occurred on December 31, 1998. Dale Ficken and Lorrie Scarangella wed on this date as they stood in a church in Pennsylvania, and were married by Jerry Falwell while he sat in his office in Lynchburg, Virginia. Virtually all major broadcasters now have a webcast of their output, from the BBC to CNN to Al Jazeera to UNTV in television to Radio China, Vatican Radio,. United Nations Radio and the World Service in radio. On November 4, 1994, Stef van der Ziel distributed the first live video images over the web from the Simplon venue in Groningen. On November 7, 1994, WXYC, the college radio station of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet. Translated versions including Subtitling are now possible using SMIL Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language. Wedcast A webcast of a wedding may be called a wedcast; it allows family and friends of the couple to watch the wedding in real time on the Internet. It is sometimes used for weddings in exotic locations, where it would be expensive or difficult for people to travel to see the wedding in person. Webcasting a funeral is also a service provided by some funeral homes. Although it has been around since at least 2005, cheaper broadband access, the financial strain of travel, and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have all led to increased use of the technology..

It has been the family home of Macpherson- Grants since 1546.https://www.ballindallochcastle.co.uk History The first tower of the Z plan castle was built in 1546. In 1590 the widow of the Grant of Ballindalloch married John Gordon, son Thomas Gordon of Cluny. John Grant, former Tutor of Ballindaloch, the administrator of the estate, killed one of John Grant's servants. This started a feud between the Earl of Huntly and the Earl of Moray. The Earl of Huntly went to Ballindalloch in November 1590 to arrest the Tutor. The Chief of Grant, John Grant of Freuchie promised to deliver the Tutor and his accomplices, accused of murder and other crimes, to Huntly Castle. However, Freuchie joined with the Tutor's men and the Earl of Moray, and came to Darnaway Castle, and there shot pistols at Huntly's officers and cannon from the castle, and killed John Gordon, brother of the Laird of Cluny.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 569-71. After it was plundered and burned by James Graham, the first Marquess of Montrose, it was restored in 1645. Extensions were added in 1770 by General James Grant of the American Wars of Independence (whose ghost is said to haunt the castle) and in 1850 by the architect Thomas MacKenzie. Further extensions carried out in 1878 were mostly demolished during modernisations enacted in 1965. It has been continuously occupied by the Russell and Macpherson-Grant families throughout its existence. The castle houses an important collection of 17th century Spanish paintings. The dining room of Ballindalloch is said to be haunted by a ghost known as The Green Lady. The castle grounds contain a 20th-century rock garden and a 17th-century dovecote. The rivers Spey and Avon flow through the grounds, offering excellent fishing. The famous Aberdeen Angus cattle herd resides in the castle estate. Today, the castle is still occupied by the Macpherson-Grant family. It is open to tourists during the summer months and a number of workshops on its grounds are in active use. Traditions It is said that the original intention was to build at a better site defensively, but when building commenced whatever was built in the day was thrown down at night. Eventually the laird, annoyed by the problem, heard a mysterious voice saying \\"Build in the cow-haughs, and you will meet with no interruptions.\\" He did so, and there was no further problem with the building.Tranter, Nigel (1993)Tales and Traditions of Scottish Castles.

The normal arrangement of internal organs is known as situs solitus. Although cardiac problems are more common, many people with situs inversus have no medical symptoms or complications resulting from the condition, and until the advent of modern medicine, it was usually undiagnosed. Situs inversus is found in about 0.01%http://www.healthline.com/health/situs-inversus of the population, or about 1 person in 10,000. In the most common situation, situs inversus totalis, it involves complete transposition (right to left reversal) of all of the viscera. The heart is not in its usual position in the left chest, but is on the right, a condition known as dextrocardia (literally, \\"right-hearted\\"). Because the relationship between the organs is not changed, most people with situs inversus have no medical symptoms or complications. An uncommon form of situs inversus is isolated levocardia, in which the position of the heart is not mirrored alongside the other organs. Isolated levocardia carries a risk of heart defects, and so patients with the condition may require surgery to correct them. In rarer cases such as situs ambiguus or heterotaxy, situs cannot be determined. In these patients, the liver may be midline, the spleen absent or multiple, and the bowel malrotated. Often, structures are duplicated or absent altogether. This is more likely to cause medical problems than situs inversus totalis. Signs and symptoms In the absence of congenital heart defects, individuals with situs inversus are homeostatically normal, and can live standard healthy lives, without any complications related to their medical condition. There is a 5‚Äì10% prevalence of congenital heart disease in individuals with situs inversus totalis, most commonly transposition of the great vessels. The incidence of congenital heart disease is 95% in situs inversus with levocardia. Many people with situs inversus totalis are unaware of their unusual anatomy until they seek medical attention for an unrelated condition, such as a rib fracture or a bout of appendicitis. The condition may also be discovered during the administration of certain medicines or during tests such as a barium meal or enema.Situs inversus of the large intestine discovered after administering a barium enema, eMedicine The reversal of the organs may then lead to some confusion, as many signs and symptoms will be on the atypical side. For example, if an individual with situs inversus develops appendicitis, they will present to the physician with lower left abdominal pain, since that is where their appendix lies.Intestinal malrotation can also cause the appendix to be on the left side. Thus, in the event of a medical problem, the knowledge that the individual has situs inversus can expedite diagnosis. People with this rare condition should inform their doctors before an examination, so the doctor can redirect their search for heart sounds and other signs. Wearing a medical identification tag can help inform health care providers in the event the person is unable to communicate. Situs inversus also complicates organ transplantation operations as donor organs will more likely come from situs solitus (normal) donors. As hearts and livers are chiral, geometric problems arise placing an organ into a cavity shaped in the mirror image. For example, a person with situs inversus who requires a heart transplant needs all their great vessels reattached to the donor heart. However, the orientation of these vessels in a person with situs inversus is reversed, necessitating steps so that the blood vessels join properly.

Axial CT image showing situs inversus (liver and IVC on the left, spleen and aorta on the right) in a patient with Kartagener syndrome.autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Situs inversus is generally an autosomal recessive genetic condition, although it can be X-linked or found in identical \\"mirror image\\" twins. About 25% of individuals with situs inversus have an underlying condition known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a dysfunction of the cilia that occurs during early embryonic development. Normally functioning cilia determine the position of the internal organs during early development, and so embryos with PCD have a 50% chance of developing situs inversus. If they do, they are said to have Kartagener syndrome, characterized by the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Cilia are also responsible for clearing mucus from the lung, and the dysfunction causes increased susceptibility to lung infections. Kartagener syndrome can also manifest with male infertility as functional cilia are required for proper sperm flagella function. Effect on anatomy The condition affects all major structures within the thorax and abdomen. Generally, the organs are simply transposed through the sagittal plane. The heart is located on the right side of the thorax, the stomach and spleen on the right side of the abdomen and the liver and gall bladder on the left side. The heart's normal right atrium occurs on the left, and the left atrium is on the right. The lung anatomy is reversed and the left lung has three lobes while the right lung has two lobes. The intestines and other internal structures are also reversed from the normal, and the blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics are also transposed. If the heart is swapped to the right side of the thorax, it is known as \\"situs inversus with dextrocardia\\" or \\"situs inversus totalis\\". If the heart remains on the normal left side of the thorax, a much rarer condition (1 in 2,000,000 of the general population), it is known as \\"situs inversus with levocardia\\" or \\"situs inversus incompletus\\". Situs inversus of the optic disc may occur unilaterally or bilaterally, associated with reduced binocularity and stereoacuity resembling monofixation syndrome. It is characterized by emergence of the retinal vessels in an anomalous direction (from the nasal rather than the temporal aspect) with dysversion (tilt) of the optic disc.Mihir Kothari and Debapriya N Chatterjee. \\"Unilateral situs inversus of optic disc associated with reduced binocularity and stereoacuity resembling monofixation syndrome\\" Indian J Ophthalmol. 2010 May-Jun; 58(3): 241‚Äì242. Diagnosis Diagnosis of situs inversus can be made using imaging techniques such as x-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Fulcher, Ann S.; Turner, Mary Ann. Abdominal Manifestations of Situs Abnormalities in Adults. RadioGraphics, 2002. 22(6). p. 1440. http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/pdf/10.1148/rg.226025016 Treatment No treatment is needed if the subject is healthy. History Dextrocardia (the heart being located on the right side of the thorax) was seen and drawn by Leonardo da Vinci in 1452‚Äì1519,https://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2012/07/17/leonardo-da- vinci-anatomist/ and then recognised by Marco Aurelio Severino in 1643. Situs inversus was first described more than a century later by Matthew Baillie. =Etymology= The term situs inversus is a short form of the Latin phrase situs inversus viscerum, meaning \\"inverted position of the internal organs\\". Notable cases Notable individuals with documented cases of situs inversus include: * Enrique Iglesias, a Spanish singer, songwriter, actor and record producer. * Catherine O'Hara, Canadian-American actress, writer and comedian. * Donny Osmond, American singer, actor and former teen idol. He supposedly had his appendicitis originally misdiagnosed due to his reversed organs. However, he told Penn Jillette that he does not have this condition, and that the story originated from an out of place appendix. * Randy Foye, an American basketball player in the NBA. He has suffered no discernible complications, and the condition is not expected to affect his career as a professional athlete, as all his organs are in reverse.http://wcco.com/sports/Minnesota.Timberwolves.Randy.2.371610.html Rookie T-Wolf's Organs Reversed * Ginggaew Lorsoongnern, a Thai convict executed by firing squad. Her condition was discovered after she was shot in the left side of her chest and survived.

Xalam (in Serer, or khalam in Wolof) is a traditional stringed musical instrument from West Africa. The xalam is thought to have originated from modern-day Mali, but some believe that, in antiquity, the instrument may have originated from Ancient Egypt. Many believe that it is an ancestor to the African American banjo. The xalam is commonly played in Mali, Gambia, Senegal, Niger, Northern Nigeria, Northern Ghana, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Western Sahara; it, and its variants, are also known in other languages as bappe, diassare, hoddu (Pulaar), koliko (Gurunsi), kologo (Frafra), komsa, kontigi, gurmi, garaya (Hausa), koni, konting (Mandinka), molo (Songhay/Zarma), ndere, ngoni (Bambara), and tidinit (Hassaniyya and Berber). In Wolof, who plays the xalam is called a xalamkat (a word composed of the verbal form of xalam, meaning \\"to play the xalam\\", and the agentive suffix -kat, thus meaning \\"one who xalams\\"). In Mande, this is ngonifola or konting fola. In Hausa, this is mai gurmi or mai kontigi. Construction and tuning The xalam, in its standard form, is a simple lute chordophone with one to five strings. The wooden body (soundbox) membranophone of the instrument is oval-shaped and covered with the hide of cattle. The strings of the xalam are typically made of two or three tightly wound strands of low- gauge nylon fishing line; these strings are fixed to the instrument's wooden neck by long and narrow leather strips and to its wooden bridge by cotton strings. By moving these strips, the instrument's tune can be adjusted. The xalam usually has two main melody strings that are fingered by the left hand (like the strings of a guitar or banjo) and two to three supplementary strings of fixed pitch. Most xalam players construct their own xalams, although they usually call on woodworkers (lawbe) to carve the body, neck, and bridge for them. In most Wolof-speaking parts of Senegal, the xalam has three principal tunings, all of which involve tuning the two main strings a perfect fourth apart. In the first tuning (ci suuf or low), the main strings are tuned 1 and 4 ( 1 being the fundamental of a major scale), with three supplementary strings being tuned an octave higher to 1¬¥, 2¬¥, and 3¬¥. The second tuning (ci kow or high) uses the same string intervals but the fundamental is placed a minor second above the higher melody string, meaning that the open main strings now play the role of 3 and 6, with the supplementary strings acting as 3¬¥ and 4#, the highest supplementary string usually being ignored. In the third tuning (ardin), the fundamental is a minor third above the lowest main string and the main strings are tuned 6 and 2, with supplementary strings tuned to 5 and 1¬¥. The third supplementary string is either ignored or is tuned to 6 or 2¬¥. If playing in an ensemble, the ardin xalam's main strings are tuned a minor third below the cu suuf xalam, and the ci kow xalam is tuned a major third above the ci suuf xalam to ensure that the fundamentals of each xalam coincide. (Thus, if the ci suuf xalam's lowest note were C, the ardins lowest note would be a low A and the ci kow xalam's lowest note would be E.) Players In most areas the xalam is played by male griots, or praise singers who are born into the profession. It most often acts as a solo or duo instrument to accompany praise songs and historical recitations, and in some areas it may form part of a larger group including kora, drums, and calebashes. It is traditionally heard at weddings, infant naming ceremonies, and (always with amplification) is now a common member of folklore ensembles, popular mbalax groups, and ndaga variety shows. Important past and present Senegalese xalam masters include S√†mba Jabare S√†mb, Ama Njaay S√†mb, Abdulaay Naar S√†mb (all from the Jolof), Abdulaay Soose (from the Saalum), and Bokunta Njaay (from the Bawol). From the Gambia, its best include the late Doudou Nying Kuli Yande and Alhaji Sait Camara. The best known Malian ngoni players are Banzumana Sissoko, Bassekou Kouyate, Mama Sissoko, Moriba Ko√Øta, Sayan Sissoko, and Fuseini Kouyate. Among the Hausa people, the best known kontigi, komsa, and gurmi players are Dan Maraya Jos, Musa Gumel, Babangida Mai Gurmi, and Salamatu Mai Gurmi.

Flying Qualities and Flight Testing of the Airplane. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 1996, p. 265 In the 1950s, test pilots were being killed at the rate of about one a week, but the risks have shrunk to a fraction of that because of the maturation of aircraft technology, better ground-testing and simulation of aircraft performance, fly-by-wire technology and, lately, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to test experimental aircraft features. Still, piloting experimental aircraft remains more dangerous than most other types of flying. Qualifications *Understand a test plan *Stick to a test plan by flying a plane in a highly specific way *Carefully document the results of each test *Have an excellent feel for the aircraft and sense exactly how it is behaving oddly if it is doing so *Solve problems quickly if anything goes wrong with the aircraft during a test *Cope with many different things going wrong at once *Effectively communicate flight test observations to engineers and relate engineering results to the pilot community, thus bridging the gap between those who design and build aircraft with those who employ the aircraft to accomplish a mission *Have an excellent knowledge of aeronautical engineering to understand how and why planes are tested. *Be above-average pilots with excellent analytical skills and the ability to fly accurately while they follow a flight plan. Test pilots can be experimental and engineering test pilots (investigating the characteristics of new types of aircraft during development) or production test pilots (the more mundane role of confirming the characteristics of new aircraft as they come off the production line). Many test pilots would perform both roles during their careers. Modern test pilots often receive formal training from highly-selective military test pilot schools, but other test pilots receive training and experience from civilian institutions and/or manufacturers' test pilot development programs. History Test flying as a systematic activity started during the First World War, at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in the United Kingdom. An \\"Experimental Flight\\" was formed at the Central Flying School. During the 1920s, test flying was further developed by the RAE in the UK, and by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in the United States. In the 1950s, NACA was transformed into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA. During these years, as work was done into aircraft stability and handling qualities, test flying evolved towards a more qualitative scientific profession. At the insistence of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the first American astronauts, the Mercury Seven, were all military test pilots, as were some of the later astronauts. The world's oldest test pilot school is what is now called the Empire Test Pilots' School (motto \\"Learn to Test - Test to Learn\\"), at RAF Boscombe Down in the UK. There are a number of similar establishments over the world. In America, the United States Air Force Test Pilot School is located at Edwards Air Force Base, the United States Naval Test Pilot School is located at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland and EPNER (Ecole du Personnel Navigant d'Essai et de Reception - \\"School for flight test and acceptance personnel\\"), the French test pilot school, is located in Istres, France. There are only two civilian schools; the International Test Pilots School in London, Ontario and the National Test Pilot School, a not-for-profit educational institute is in Mojave, California.

Delgatie Castle is a castle near Turriff, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. A castle has stood on the site of Delgatie Castle since the year 1030 AD, although the earliest parts of the castle standing today were built between 1570 and 1579. Additional wings and a chapel were added in 1743. The castle was stripped from the disgraced Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, after the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and given to Clan Hay (later to become the Earls of Erroll). Mary, Queen of Scots, was a guest at the castle in 1562 after the Battle of Corrichie. Delgatie Castle in 2017 Like many castles, Delgatie is rumoured to be haunted. A number of reports of a ghostly red-haired figure, supposedly one Alexander Hay, were made by soldiers posted there during the Second World War. The castle's information boards, mostly written by Captain Hay who restored the house in the 1950s, recount that the ghost was first seen when a body was found bricked up in a priest hole. Architecturally, the castle consists of a keep, adjoining house and two later wings. Notable features include a very wide turnpike stair and painted ceilings dating from the 16th century in some rooms.Michael Bath, Renaissance Decorative Painting in Scotland, NMS (2003), 221-22 In many places may be seen the Hay family arms including the three cattle yokes which recall a farmer and his two sons who were instrumental in the defeat of a Danish raiding party at Cruden Bay. (See Clan Hay for more detail.) Painted ceiling in Delgatie Castle, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Today, the castle and its gardens are owned by the Delgatie Castle Trust. The castle, grounds, and caf√© are open to the public throughout the summer months and suites within the castle itself and a number of cottages the estate are available to rent.

S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia, written as a prequel to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Charn, and the world of which it is the capital city, are the birthplace of Jadis, also known as the White Witch, who later seizes control of Narnia. When visited briefly by Digory and Polly, the protagonists of the novel, the city is totally deserted, lifeless and crumbling, under a dying sun. Rivers have dried up, and neither weeds nor insects live. All life on the world of Charn had been destroyed by Jadis through an evil magic spell. In the novel, the city stands as an example of the dead end that can result if a civilization succumbs to evil. During their visit, Digory accidentally wakes Jadis from suspended animation, and she is able to leave the world with them.  Etymology  The name Charn may be derived from the Latin root carnƒÅlis, meaning \\"fleshly\\" or \\"related to the flesh.\\" The words carnal, carnivore, carnival, and charnel house (from the French charnel) also derive from this root. This would emphasize the hedonism and indulgence in worldly pleasures‚Äîthe pleasures of the flesh as opposed to more spiritual delights‚Äîthat eventually led to the fall of Charn. History According to Jadis, Charn was once the greatest city of her unnamed world, \\"the wonder of the world, perhaps of all worlds.\\" It was a magnificent civilization ruled by a line of magically-adept emperors and empresses of whom Jadis was the last. However, by the time the protagonists enter, the world is now a cold and desolate wasteland with no life to be seen anywhere, and the city on the brink of collapse. Magic may have been widely used in Charn; Jadis referred to the common use of magic carpets for transportation. Their use was apparently limited to the nobility, who inherited inborn magical powers. Jadis disdained Andrew Ketterley, Digory's magician uncle as a petty conjurer without a drop of real magic blood in his veins, saying, \\"Your kind was made an end of in my world a thousand years ago.\\" Apparently dragons were also once abundant in Charn and in the service of the royal and noble families. The Hall of Images in the royal palace exhibits lifelike images of the past rulers of Charn, all remarkably tall and beautiful, and all crowned and seated upon thrones. The sequence of these images, through the expressions on their faces, tells a story of a civilization that was once benevolent but degenerated into a cruel, tyrannical empire. The early Emperors and Empresses of Charn were kind and decent, but through the passage of the centuries, their lineage devolved into one of malevolence, corruption, evil, and despair, seeing their subjects only as a means to an end. Evidently their hunger for power was insatiable and they conquered several other realms, as Jadis gloats that \\"many great kings\\" attempted to stand against Charn, but were defeated and their names lost to history. Slavery was once common in Charn, as was human sacrifice. The last queen of Charn was Jadis, although the numerous empty thrones after hers suggest a premature end to the dynasty. As Jadis leads the children through the decaying palace, she describes the cruelty of Charn and its leaders. She points out dungeons and torture chambers to them and recounts that her great-grandfather once invited seven hundred nobles to a banquet and slaughtered them all, \\"before they had drunk their fill,\\" for \\"they had rebellious thoughts.\\" When the children finally see the full extent of the city from the balcony of the royal palace, it extends as far as the eye can see in any direction, as if covering the entire world. It is described as being full of pyramids, bridges, palaces and towers with a great river having once run through it that has since turned to dust. Jadis recalls viewing the city while it was full of life, quoting: \\"It is silent now. But I have stood here when the whole air was full of the noises of Charn; the trampling of feet, the creaking of wheels, the cracking of the whips and the groaning of slaves, the thunder of chariots, and the sacrificial drums beating in the temples. I have stood here (but that was near the end) when the roar of battle went up from every street and the river of Charn ran red.\\" The destruction of Charn Jadis is responsible for the eradication of all life on Charn but blamed the destruction on her sister. Jadis and her sister fought a civil war for the throne, which Jadis eventually lost. She claimed she had offered to spare her sister's life if she surrendered, so the resulting destruction was the unnamed sister's fault. Jadis obliterated her kingdom and all its people rather than relinquish her power over them. According to Jadis's own account, her sister had started a long and murderous civil war. There was a solemn oath between her and the unidentified sister that neither side would use magic; a pact broken by the sister, who gained the advantage as a result. Jadis recounts that during the civil war, she \\"poured out the blood of her armies like water,\\" but was eventually defeated. In the final battle, which was fought in the city itself over three days, the sister defeated the last of Jadis' forces. Within the ruling family of Charn, there was knowledge of an evil spell, the Deplorable Word, which would destroy all life except the one who spoke it, though the word itself was a mystery. Although her ancestors had bound themselves and their descendants with oaths never to seek knowledge of this spell, Jadis had sought it out and learned it \\"in a secret place and paid a terrible price to learn it.\\" Her sister knew Jadis had discovered the Deplorable Word but did not think Jadis would use it. Facing defeat, Jadis spoke the Deplorable Word which annihilated all life under the sun apart from herself. After this, she put herself into an enchanted sleep in the Hall of Images. During her suspended animation, all water in Charn dried up and the once-magnificent city crumbled into ruin. The waking of Jadis The spell that bound Jadis was broken when Digory Kirke, arriving in Charn with Polly Plummer, succumbed to temptation and rang a bell in the royal palace where Jadis slumbered, along with images of her royal ancestors, after reading a verse: > Make your choice, adventurous Stranger; > Strike the bell and bide the danger, > Or wonder, till it drives you mad, > What would have followed if you had. Charn's Sun is described as red, large, and cold. When Digory asks Jadis about the sun's appearance, she asks him about his world's Sun. When informed that our sun is yellow, brighter, smaller, and \\"gives off a good deal more heat,\\" she remarks with sudden interest, \\"Ah, so yours is a younger world.\\" Charn and the realm in which it resided ceased to exist entirely after Jadis and the children left. Later, when Aslan and the children are in the Wood between the Worlds, Aslan shows them that the puddle leading to Charn is dried up, as the empty world has been destroyed. Jadis entered Narnia with the humans from Earth, and 900 years later appears as the White Witch in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, ruling that land for 100 years until Aslan returned and defeated her with the aid of the four Pevensie children. Commentary The name \\"Charn\\" suggests \\"charnel house,\\" a repository for human skeletal remains. The hall of the figures of the rulers of Charn, inspired by the underground grotto of mummies in King Solomon's Mines, shows a progression illustrating the decline and fall of the city and its world, reflecting a view of history described by G. K. Chesterton. The \\"deplorable word\\" is most likely a metaphor for weapons of mass destruction, which many feared would bring about the destruction of the world at the time when the novel was written. In the last chapter of the book, Polly asks Aslan if humanity has yet grown as corrupt as Charn, to which he replies: References \\\\+ Fictional lost cities and towns Fictional empires pl:Miejsca w cyklu Opowie≈õci z Narnii#C ","title":"Charn"},{"id":"626878","text":"The Redneck Manifesto may refer to: * The Redneck Manifesto (band), instrumental rock band based in Dublin, Ireland, formed in 1998 * The Redneck Manifesto, a 1997 book by American author Jim Goad ","title":"The Redneck Manifesto"},{"id":"626889","text":"The Control of Communicable Diseases Manual (CCDM) is one of the most widely recognized reference volumes on the topic of infectious diseases. It is useful for physicians, epidemiologists, global travelers, emergency volunteers and all who have dealt with or might have to deal with public health issues. The title of the book, as registered in the Library of Congress, is Control of Communicable Diseases Manual 20th edition, An Official Report of the American Public Health Association. The editor of CCDM is David L. Heymann, MD. First edition (1917). History The first edition, published in 1917 by the US Public Health Service, titled Control of Communicable Diseases. The first edition was a 30-page booklet with 38 diseases (Public Health Reports 32:41:1706-1733), adopted from a pamphlet written by Dr. Francis Curtis, health officer for Newton, Massachusetts, and sold for 5¬¢. Changes over the years reflect the new discoveries of infectious agents over the past century. The second edition in 1926 included 42 diseases, but only two arthropod (usually mosquito) - borne diseases, yellow and dengue fever and one protozoan disease, malaria. The causative organism of smallpox, dengue and chickenpox was listed as 'unknown.' The third edition in 1932 included two new arthropod infestations and a new disease, coccidioidal granuloma, with a note that it was 100% fatal. Eight diseases were listed as \\"reportable\\": diphtheria, epidemic influenza, measles, meningococcal meningitis, polio, scarlet fever, smallpox, and typhoid fever. The fourth edition in 1935 included 13 new infections. The fifth edition erroneously listed pemphigus as being infectious. In the sixth edition the rickettsioses were reorganized. In the seventh edition (1950) leprosy became Hansen's disease and cat-scratch disease was added as a probable viral disease (now known to be caused by the bacterium, Bartonella henselae. The eight edition (1955) erroneously listed actinomycosis as a fungal disease. In the ninth edition, arthropod-borne viral diseases were reclassified, with 49 additional diseases, resulting in substantially more viral entries. By the twelfth edition (1975) there were 118 arboviral illnesses. The 16th edition included \\"neoplastic, malignant viral- associated diseases\\" for the first time. In 2004 (18th edition) there were six \\"tick-borne\\" diseases, which was later corrected to include a \\"mite-borne\\" disease, rickettsialpox. The title was changed to \\"Control of Communicable Disease Manual\\" in 1995 (16th edition) to remove any perception of gender bias. Poster of past and present CCDM covers at APHA convention 2016 For a long time the paperback edition was a handy pocket book, the 17th edition still fitting in one hand or a pocket . Now, the softcover version can only fit in the largest pocket of a spacious winter coat. However, the entire contents are now available as an app for iOS and Android and in PDF format. The paperback is 729 pages with dimensions of 1.5 x 4.2 x 7 inches. The ISBN is 978-0-87553-018-5. =Latest edition= The American Public Health Association published the 20th edition of the CCDM in 2014 under the editorship of David L. Heymann, MD. International infectious disease and public health experts, at both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, have updated this version. The 20th edition includes two new chapters on noma and animal/human communicable diseases. New arboviral agents were added (Banna, Cache Valley, Iquitos, and the Me Tri virus, but the number of arboviruses and other pathogens also contracted, apparently to make the manual less encyclopedic. The previous edition had eleven new chapters on topics fundamental to a global public health landscape. Chapter topics include: risk management, public health security in a globalized world, international health regulations, reporting of communicable diseases, outbreak response in bioterrorism, communicable disease control in humanitarian emergencies and handling of infectious materials. Other new chapters offer guidance on disease control at mass gatherings, after natural disasters or in emergency situations. Content The Control of Communicable Diseases Manual (CCDM) compiles comprehensive scientific data about communicable diseases, which significantly contribute to mortality and morbidity around the world. The CCDM emphasizes the epidemiological aspects of communicable diseases and provides information about their identification, reporting, control and prevention. =Disease Descriptions= The CCDM lists diseases in alphabetical order and includes information on each disease using the following 12 sections: # Clinical Features # Causative agent(s) # Diagnosis # Occurrence # Reservoir(s) # Incubation period # Transmission # Risk groups # Prevention # Management of patient # Management of contacts and the immediate environment # Special considerations The size of each section varies considerably. For instance, the occurrence section for smallpox is less than a line long, since this disease is officially present only in the freezers of laboratories at the CDC in the United States and the Vector Institute in Russia. Availability The book has been published in a number of languages, including Arabic, Catalan, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, and Thai, a testament to its global audience. The CCDM is available as an online PDF version and as apps for iOS and Android for $50.

The official English title used by Nippon Animation is Conan, The Boy in Future. It is an adaptation of Alexander Key's novel The Incredible Tide. A spin-off series, , aired for 24 episodes on TBS from October 16, 1999 through April 1, 2000. None of the original main staff worked on this series. It has no relation in terms of story to the original whatsoever. Story=Future Boy Conan= The story begins in July 2008, during a time when humankind is faced with the threat of extinction. A devastating war fought between two major nations, the United States and Russia, with ultra-magnetic weapons far greater than anything seen earlier brings about total chaos and destruction throughout the world, resulting in several earthquakes and tsunamis. The earth is thrown off its axis, its crust rocked by massive movements, and the five continents are torn completely apart and sink deep below the sea. An attempt by a group of people to flee to outer space failed, with their spaceships being forced back to earth and vanishing, thus shattering their hopes. But one of the spaceships narrowly escaped destruction and crash landed on a small island which had miraculously survived the devastation. The crew members of the spaceship settled there, as if they were seeds sown on the island. Amidst these survivors, a boy named Conan is born in October 2010, bringing a new ray of hope to the survivors. After several years, during which most of the other survivors had died and the only people left on the island were Conan and his grandfather, Conan meets a young girl named Lana, and their adventure begins. Between the different islands left in the world, including Industria, High Harbor, Remnant, and others, the young group of adventurers travel and conflict rises between good and evil people. Throughout the series a pure love story develops between Conan and Lana. =Taiga Adventure= The spin-off series centers around a boy named Taiga and his adventure in the world of magical artifacts known as OOPArts. The central OOPArt, known as , is a giant living statue, and it is on its path to bring forth doom to the world as it collects other OOPArts and becomes more powerful. Characters=Future Boy Conan= ; : The main protagonist of the series, Conan is an adventurous 11-year-old boy who was born on Remnant Island and raised by his grandfather after the Great Disaster. Conan is very attuned to his rural, secluded lifestyle. For his size and age, he is very clever, immensely strong, an exceptional athlete and swimmer, and can hold his breath for more than three minutes. He is also proficient with his spear, particularly at throwing it. Despite his lack of social exposure, he is gentle and kind. Deciding to rescue Lana in a self-constructed sailboat after his Grandfather's killing and Lana's subsequent capture, Conan meets new friends and acquaintances while becoming caught up in Lepka's plots for Industria and High Harbor. ; : Lana is a quiet, soft-spoken girl from High Harbor and the granddaughter of Dr. Lao, to whom she is devoted. Lana, who is also 11, is discovered by Conan, unconsciously washed up on the shore, as the first person other than his grandfather whom Conan meets. After a period of being held captive by Dyce, she follows Conan's group through Industria in an attempt to find her grandfather. Pursued by Industria, Lepka intends to capture her as hostage in order to obtain the secret of solar power from Dr. Lao. Lana is referred to as possessing telepathy, allowing her to communicate with a tern named Tikki, as well as sense the presence of her grandfather. With her affection for Conan, she begins to form a close telepathic rapport with him as well. ; : A wild boy living alone on the first island Conan arrives at, Jimsy quickly becomes Conan's first friend, helping him rescue Lana. Jimsy is a master hunter (with a particular preference for grilled frogs), proficient with his bow and able to draw with Conan in a race, although his constant desire of filling his stomach tends to get him into trouble. Jimsy ends up spending most of his time with Dyce after Conan and Lana are separated from the party. Initially, Jimsy has a negative view on women, but he gradually forms a relationship with Tera at the end of the series. ; : The head of administration of Industria, Lepka technically serves under the Industria High Committee, a group of benevolent but naive scientists. However, over the course of the series he becomes the sole dictator of Industria, and the primary antagonist. Cruel and power-hungry, Lepka desires to extract the secret of solar power from Dr. Lao to power his weapons, which would allow him to rule over what remains of the world. ; : The grandfather of Lana, and the scientist responsible for the development of solar power for both civil and wartime usage. Originally a member of Industria's High Council, he defected after he learned of Lepka's power-driven ambitions, and hid under the cover identity of a hard-handed salvaging crew captain named Patch. He believes that the people of Industria must be taught to discard their weapons and begin new lives in peace. For this reason he escaped, bringing with him the secret of how to access an orbiting solar power station left over from pre-war times. ; : The young assistant director of Industria's Administration forces. As a young girl, she was her family's only survivor when the final war broke out and the Earth was devastated; and as a result of that tragedy, she became a harsh, uncaring enforcer. She is tasked by Lepka to capture Lana, and eventually leads the invasion of Industria against High Harbor. However, as she encounters Conan, she is gradually swayed by his unwavering courage and sincerity, and eventually joins him and his friends in taking down Lepka. ; : Dyce is a citizen of Industria, and the captain of the plastic-salvaging ship Barracuda. He was originally ordered to track down Dr. Briac Lao, Lana's grandfather, and convey the girl to Industria, but ended up developing an affection for Lana, enabling her to escape to Remnant Island. Fed up with Lepka's cruelty towards Lana, he eventually becomes one of Conan's allies, helping to overthrow Industria's regime in their exploits. He is a comically inept character, and often makes it out alive only by pure luck in his fights with Industria's forces. ; : The leader of an underground cell composed of Industria's lower-class/slave citizenry. He is an old ally of Dr. Lao in the latter's attempts to improve the lives of the city's downtrodden people, and was repeatedly arrested and charged for rebellion. During one stint in prison, he and his compatriots are freed by Conan and in turn aid him and his friends in navigating the underground city beneath Industria's Triangle Tower, which is riddled with secret passages only the resistance knows about. ; : Orlo is the leader of a rogue gang based in the mountains of High Harbor, who tax whoever the gang catches crossing their territory. He originates from a village of herders on the other side of High Harbor island, but turned into a bullying outlaw after he found honest work to be unsatisfactory for living an easy life. He plots to become the leader of High Harbor, and thus cooperates with the Industrians when they invade the island, bringing down the villager's defenses. However, when a tidal wave hits the island and the Industrians subsequently surrender, his plans are permanently dashed. In the end, he finds his place back among his fellow islanders. ; : Orlo's younger sister, about the same age as Conan and Jimsy, and the deputy leader of Orlo's men. She and Jimsy quickly take a liking to each other, but their radically diverging views of life prevent them from reaching a common ground at first. During the Industrian invasion of High Harbor, she is rescued by Jimsy and Conan, which breaks down the barrier between them, and they become a couple. ; : Conan's adopted elderly grandfather, who raised him on Remnant Island. Originally part of a crew of people escaping from the largely destroyed Earth, their spaceship crashed back down, miraculously landing on Remnant Island, with all the members surviving, including Conan's grandfather. With every other crew member dying soon after Conan's birth, he was left to raise Conan alone for 11 years, taking him as his adopted Grandson. However, after being attacked by Industrian soldiers during Lana's abduction, he dies from his injuries. In the later course of his adventures, however, Conan encounters an Industrian low- class citizen who bears a striking resemblance to Grandfather. ; : Umasou (\\"looks delicious\\" in Japanese) is Jimsy's pet piglet which he acquired after becoming a pig herder on High Harbor Island. =Taiga Adventure= ; : A robust young boy who travels with his archaeologist father to ruins around the world. Conflicts arise once they accidentally awake the magical artifact Obats. Taiga then has to chase it and try to acquire key OOPArts before Obats can get them. ; : A beautiful young girl who likes riding her motorcycle. Her father is also an archaeologist. She is chosen to be the host of the energy harvested from Obats. ; : A \\"tribalesque\\" jungle boy who believes everything his TV says, including how to talk to girls. He becomes Taiga's best friend. ; : The apocalyptic giant living OOPArt. It originally takes the form of a giant bird, but after being awakened, it begins to head for places where other key magical OOPArts are kept, at the same time takes various forms, such a giant mole, a giant fish monster, a giant bat, a giant sphinx, etc. Production Spanning a total of 26 episodes, the series was produced by Nippon Animation and featured the directorial debut of Hayao Miyazaki, who also contributed to character designs and storyboards. Other future prominent anime creators like Isao Takahata (storyboards, directing) and Yoshiyuki Tomino (storyboards) also worked on the series. Nippon Animation originally presented NHK with several proposals. At first a different story was favored, but eventually, The Incredible Tide novel was chosen. There was a preparation time of three months for the layout. Six months passed between the start of the key animation work and the airing of the first episode. Although a stock of eight episodes was already produced by that time, the show still went behind schedule. According to Miyazaki it \\"took [them] from ten days to two weeks to produce a single episode\\" and that if \\"NHK hadn't inserted a special program in there as a padding, it probably would have turned into a real wreck of a series. If we hadn't been working for NHK, we never could have pulled Conan off.\\" The staff was happy to work on a more upbeat story after 3000 Leagues in Search of Mother. In a 1983 interview with Y≈çk≈ç Tomizawa from Animage, Miyazaki stated that he only worked on the show under the condition that he was allowed to change the story. He disliked the pessimistic world view of the original story, feeling it was a reflection of Alexander Key's own fears and insecurities. He wanted a story aimed at children to be more optimistic, stating \\"[e]ven if someone's lost all hope for the future, I think it is incredibly stupid to go around stressing this to children. Emphasize it to adults if you have to, but there's no need to do so to children. It would be better to simply not say anything at all.\\" Miyazaki further made an effort to distance himself from the notion of High Harbor representing North America and Industria representing the Soviet Union. In order to do this, he even considered making the setting more Japanese. For example, in his version of the story, the people of High Harbor would grow rice instead of wheat and eat using chopsticks. But this \\"would have led to all sorts of other problems\\", so he eventually dropped the idea. One scene of Jimsy smoking cigarettes was removed by NHK before the airing of the episode. Miyazaki admitted that he put \\"way too much of [his] own feelings into episode eight\\", specifically the underwater \\"kiss\\" scene. He had grown fonder of Lana by episode 5 and 6 and \\"realized that [the show] incorporated the exact same story line of a manga [he] had created back in [his] student days\\" to the point where even the shots were arranged in the same way. Anime Future Boy Conan first aired across Japan on the NHK TV network between April 4 and October 31, 1978, during the Tuesday, 7:30pm timeslot. It has been regularly broadcast across Japan on the anime satellite television network Animax, who have also later translated and dubbed the series into English for broadcast across its respective English- language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia, under the title Conan, The Boy in Future. The series was also translated into numerous other languages, including Chinese (both Cantonese and Mandarin), French, Spanish, Italian, Catalan, Basque, Portuguese, Korean, Turkish, Kurdish and Arabic. It has been broadcast across Europe, Latin America, the Arab world and numerous other regions. In 1978, A video tape from NHK with early animation of the in- production film, which had been sent to the Alexander Key family as a courtesy, Alexander Key hated how Hayao Miyazaki changed his story and told his estate to never allow the anime to come over to the North America. 14 year Later in 1992, Streamline Pictures License the anime along with Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water from NHK, Streamline Pictures dubbed all 26 episodes of Future Boy Conan for Japan Airlines, The company was planning to release the show in North America on VHS, But the estate of Alexander Key became aware of the anime coming to the US and sent a cease and desist letter to Streamline Pictures threating a lawsuit it Future Boy Conan ever get a US release, this results it in Streamline Pictures geting the right back to NHK and tell the company of what happens and told them to never allow North America licensing company to have the right to Future Boy Conan, The show didn't came to the US as of 2020.

In 1995, another game titled Conan: The Boy In Future, was exclusively released on the 3DO, and was developed by Bandai Visual and published by Emotion Digital Software. The game also is exclusive in Japan, and is extremely rare. In January 2011, NewGin announced a pachinko game titled based on the anime television series. Another video game adaptation of the series was released for the PlayStation 2 home console in August 25, 2005, only in Japan. Influences and reception In a 1983 interview with Y≈çko Yomizawa, Hayao Miyazaki acknowledged that ratings for the show had not been very good, noting that episode twenty-five had received the highest rating at 14 percent. In her 1999 book Hayao Miyazaki: Master of Japanese Animation, Helen McCarthy identifies Conan as a \\"seminal\\" work and recognizes themes and story elements in this production which Miyazaki would continue to explore throughout his career. McCarthy also notes continuity in the development of the characters and their plight throughout Miyazaki's work. She sees Lana and Conan as precedents for his later heroines and characters, and mentions, among others, Sheeta's rescue by Pazu, from Miyazaki's 1986 animated feature film Castle in the Sky, as an example. =Popularity in the Arab world= The show was very popular in the Arab world and still is today. The dubbing was performed by Arab Audio and Video Center, which was based in Kuwait. The cast included a number of Kuwaiti TV stars such as Jassim Al- Nabhan, Ali Al-Mufidi and others. Conan's name was changed to Adnan, Lana's was changed to Leena, and Jimsy's was changed to Abbisy so that they could have names similar to Arabic names. Unlike most Arabic dubs of anime, Future Boy Conan has retained most of its plot details without any altering.

He died young and left behind a single collection of organ music, and an Ouverture for harpsichord. Life Notre- Dame de Reims, painted c.1800 by Domenico Quaglio the Younger. This is the church where de Grigny worked during the last years of his life. Nicolas de Grigny was born in 1672 in Reims in the parish of Saint-Pierre-Le- Vieil.Halbreich. The exact date of his birth is unknown; he was baptized on 8 September. He was born into a family of musicians: his father, his grandfather, and his uncle, Robert, were organists at the Reims Cathedral, the Basilica of St. Pierre and St. Hilaire, respectively.Howell, Sabatier, Grove.Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers, p. 211. Few details about his life are known, nothing at all about his formative years. Between 1693 and 1695 he served as organist of the abbey church of Saint Denis, in Paris (where his brother Andr√© de Grigny was sub-prior). It was also during that period that Grigny studied with Nicolas Leb√®gue, who was by then one of the most famous French keyboard composers.Higginbottom, Grove. In 1695 Grigny married Marie-Magdeleine de France, daughter of a Parisian merchant. Apparently he returned to his hometown soon afterwards: the record of the birth of his first son indicates that de Grigny was already in Reims in 1696. The couple went on to produce six more children. By late 1697 Grigny was appointed titular organist of Notre-Dame de Reims (the exact date of the appointment is not known), the city's famous cathedral in which French kings were crowned. In 1699 the composer published his Premier livre d'orgue [contenant une messe et les hymnes des principalles festes de l'ann√©e] in Paris. Grigny died prematurely in 1703, aged 31, shortly after accepting a job offer from Saint Symphorien, a parish church in Reims. His Livre d'orgue was reissued in 1711 through the efforts of his widow. The collection became known abroad: it was copied in 1713 by Johann Sebastian Bach, and later by Johann Gottfried Walther. Work Nicolas de Grigny's only surviving music is a large volume of organ works, Premier livre d'orgue (Paris, 1699; second edition 1711). The second edition was the only one known until 1949, when the earlier print was discovered‚Äîa single surviving copy at Biblioth√®que nationale de France. This was published by Christophe Ballard using the original plates prepared by Claude Roussel, its engraver, in 1699. The first modern edition, by Alexandre Guilmant, 1904, was based on the 1711 version. Unlike many other French livres d'orgue of the time, Grigny's publication contains no preface. The collection is in two parts: the first is a mass setting, the second comprises settings of five hymns for the principal feasts of the church year: Veni Creator (5 versets), Pange lingua (3 versets), Verbum supernum (4 versets), Ave maris stella (4 versets) and A solis ortus (three versets). There are 42 pieces overall. The plan of the mass is as follows: * 5 Kyrie versets, * 9 Gloria versets, * an Offertory, * 2 Sanctus versets, * 1 Benedictus verset, * an El√©vation, * 2 Agnus Dei versets, * a Communion, and * an Ite Missa Est verset. As specified by the Caeremoniale Parisiensis (1662), Grigny states the chant melodies in the first and last Kyrie, Gloria, and the first Sanctus and Agnus Dei. His publication is based on Cunctipotens genitor Deus. The collection also includes a Point d'orgue, a piece based on a long pedal point.

Portrayed by George Hertzberg, he is a monster created from a man and the collected parts of demons, vampires, and technology: the product of a perverse experiment carried out by military scientists. The series' main character, Buffy Summers, encounters and ultimately defeats him in the fourth season. Adam is the creation of Dr. Maggie Walsh (Lindsay Crouse), the head of a military-like organization called The Initiative that studies how to alter the harmful behavior inherent to demons. Adam and the Initiative are the fourth season's primary antagonists, or Big Bad. The premise of the series is that Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a Slayer, endowed with superhuman strength to fight vampires and evil creatures in the fictional town of Sunnydale. In the fourth season, Buffy begins attending college, where she discovers that her psychology professor, Walsh, is a scientist for the Initiative. Adam is Dr. Walsh's horrible masterpiece, an allusion to Frankenstein's monster, whose first conscious act is killing his creator. Adam's search for understanding himself and his true nature, combined for his penchant for chaos, leads him to orchestrate a massacre between demons and humans, after which he will be able use body parts left over from the melee to create an army of monsters to set loose on Sunnydale. Buffy's effectiveness as a Slayer is increased because her close friends and family, called the Scooby Gang, assist her in her battles. By the end of season four the members of the group have become estranged and must come back together in order to defeat the apparently invincible Adam. Buffy studies scholars have critically examined the character of Adam, noting that he is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster. Throughout the action of the novel, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created, much like Adam. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to \\"find the stillness\\" in the character. The presence of Adam also serves to question tradition and authority, specifically institutional authority, which is a repeated theme on the show. Adam has a \\"design flaw\\": Adam finds Dr. Walsh unnecessary (his existence supplemented with technology), and as such kills hera clear example of rejecting authority. Critical reception to Adam has largely ranged from mixed to negative. Some commentators felt his subplot was confusing and unconvincing. Others enjoyed the concept and praised the make-up and special effects used to create the character. Character arc=Television appearances= Adam makes his first appearance on the thirteenth episode of season four, \\"The I in Team\\". The first twelve episodes of the season establish the overarching themes, with increasing focus on the mysterious activities of the Initiative. Buffy and Willow begin attending college, an experience which overwhelms Buffy immediately as she finds herself far outside her comfort zone.Holder, et al., pp. 196‚Äì208Stafford, pp. 215‚Äì220 In the season premiere, Buffy and Willow begin attending a challenging psychology class taught by Dr. Maggie Walsh (Lindsay Crouse). She also meets Dr. Walsh's teaching assistant Riley Finn (Marc Blucas) and they become attracted to each other. Riley is in charge of a military commando organization that hunts vampires and demons, and captures them for research. It is not revealed to audiences that Dr. Walsh is the head of the research branch of Riley's military organization, called the Initiative, until the seventh episode.Holder, et al., pp. 196‚Äì212Stafford, pp. 215‚Äì231 The Initiative's goals are gradually made clearer. A recurring character since the second season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them.Holder, et al., pp. 212‚Äì214Stafford, pp. 222‚Äì225 Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, spending more time with Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative's true motives and there are questions about their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during \\"The I in Team\\". After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh‚Äîwho answers to no one‚Äîthen cement Dr. Walsh's decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314 and speaking to her pet project, Adam who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm‚Äîthe one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is \\"Mommy\\", which he says as Dr. Walsh falls to the floor, dead.Holder, et al., pp. 227‚Äì230Stafford, pp. 231‚Äì232 Riley, meanwhile, learns of Dr. Walsh's death and his comrades Forrest (Leonard Roberts) and Graham (Bailey Chase) suspect Buffy to be her murderer. Extremely agitated and showing signs of drug withdrawal, he follows Buffy and demands to know the truth in \\"Goodbye Iowa\\". None of them are aware of Adam until he re-emerges in the underground laboratories of the Initiative, killing Dr. Walsh's assistant and another soldier. He tells Riley that he knows Dr. Walsh created them both, that she gave Riley chemicals to strengthen him, which makes them brothers. When Riley refuses to acknowledge their bond, Adam skewers Riley, and knocks Buffy across the room while Forrest and Graham are trying to enter the locked door. Adam leaves and the Initiative are tasked with hunting him down and killing him.Holder, et al., pp. 231‚Äì232Richardson and Rabb, p. 67 When one of Sunnydale's residents, Jonathan Levinson (Danny Strong), casts a spell making him the center of everyone's attention in \\"Superstar\\", Adam is the only character in town who realizes it is an illusion. He explains his insight by saying he is \\"aware\\". His uniqueness has set him apart.Stevenson, pp. 27‚Äì28 Adam is interested in how the illusion will play out, however, and watches it unfold. During the illusion, Jonathan‚Äîtemporarily a part of the Inititative‚Äîdiscovers Adam's only weakness: a uranium power core source which, effectively, will never allow him to die.Holder, et al., pp. 237‚Äì238 Spike simultaneously discovers Adam to be communicating with the town's demon underworld, asking for favors through a charisma he has over them. Adam promises if Spike can drive apart Buffy and Riley and their friends, he will remove Spike's microchip.Holder, et al., pp. 239‚Äì244Stafford, pp. 239‚Äì242 The plan to drive Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles apart works for a while; at their lowest, the four refuse to speak to each other, but each of them realizes in \\"Primeval\\" that they were manipulated by Spike and return, apologetic. They realize that Adam has been orchestrating the capture of the town's vampires and demons so he can release them in the Initiative; the Initiative's holding cells are becoming overcrowded and the soldiers spread very thin and overworked. The soldiers and demons will then proceed to kill each other. Adam then intends to use the resulting carnage to create an army of monsters much like himself.Holder, et al., pp. 246‚Äì247Stafford, pp. 242‚Äì244 Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles realize they must work as one unit to defeat Adam. They are captured sneaking into the Initiative, but Adam trips the power, releasing all the demons and a fight breaks out all over the facility. Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles get themselves into a room adjacent to 314 as Willow starts to cast the spell to join them all temporarily. Riley distracts Adam's demonoid minions while Buffy confronts Adam. However, Adam, after modulating his arm to dispense a minigun, is able to overpower her. Suddenly, the spell begins to work: to function as one unit, Willow becomes the spirit, Giles the mind, Xander the heart, and Buffy the hand, or strength of their ensemble. They work through Buffy to neutralize Adam, telling him \\"You could never hope to grasp the source of our power\\". Adam, alone but intrigued, shoots at them to no avail. Adam then shoots a missile, which is changed into doves, and his gun is reverted into his arm. They are able, through Buffy, to punch inside Adam's chest, remove his uranium core, destroying him.Richardson and Rabb, pp. 73‚Äì74Stevenson, pp. 146‚Äì147 Adam's most significant influence following his death is in the next episode \\"Restless\\", where the cost of defeating Adam is made apparent. Buffy's fourth season was a first in the series in that the Scoobies' defeat of the Big Bad did not occur in a two-part grand season finale. \\"Primeval\\" is not the last episode of the season. Joss Whedon felt so strongly about the importance of the four core characters that he dedicated the finale to exploring their development. \\"Restless\\" opens with Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles arriving at Buffy's mother's house still brimming with the energy of the spell that bound them together in \\"Primeval\\". Each of them falls asleep quickly, however, and their dreams are a pastiche of enigmatic episodes that both reveal much about each character, but also foreshadow what will occur in seasons to come. Their dreams also mirror their roles in the spell they performed to kill Adam. The magic they used to defeat the influence of science creates an inverse crisis, violating the series' set of laws. Both Riley and Adam, now only in human form, appear in Buffy's dream. They are wearing business suits, sitting together at a glass conference table as Buffy walks into the room, telling her they are naming things‚Äîas Adam did in the Garden of Eden‚Äîand making plans to take over the world. Buffy asks Adam what his name was before he was a monster, but he cannot tell her. Adam appears once more in the series as one of the faces of the First Evil, the seventh season's Big Bad, in \\"Lessons\\".Ruditis, pp. 167‚Äì170 =Graphic novel appearance= According to the comic book series Haunted, Adam was once a human member of the Initiative tasked with protecting Professor Walsh. The ghost of Mayor Richard Wilkins, however, took over the body of a vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project.Espenson, passim However, due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse, this chain of events may not, in fact, be canonical. Development=Creation and casting= Series writer David Fury cited graphic novel author Alan Moore's Promethea‚Äîa story combining science fiction, mysticism, and a female superhero‚Äîas inspiration for the storyline, and another nod to Frankenstein as its original title was Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus. In addition, series creator, Joss Whedon has long been interested in science fiction. He wrote the script for the film Alien Resurrection (1997), where an extraterrestrial creature is bred from a human and an alien in a laboratory, and went on to develop the space western television series Firefly. Buffy uses both science and magic as narrative devices. According to author Andrew Aberdein, the series employs science in three ways: to demonstrate what contemporary science explains, to posit what science may be able to accomplish, and the dominance of supernatural forces over science. According to Aberdein, Adam, a \\"kinematically redundant, bio-mechanical demonoid\\", is the series' deepest exploration of scientific potential.South, pp. 79‚Äì90 Series writer Doug Petrie states that Adam is the embodiment of the invasion of science in a world where magic is the most powerful force. The series relied on its own form of magic to explain Buffy's superpowers and other supernatural occurrences up to the fourth season. Adam is \\"what happens when people who believe in science use demons for military gain\\", according to Petrie. The result is that science \\"gets its ass kicked\\" by magic. Buffy the Vampire Slayer had been very successful in its first three seasons on television, but some of the characters left the series and storylines ended, creating a need for an entire shift in location and mission. Buffy and the core group of friends who fight with her graduate from high school, while the school itself was blown up in the third-season finale. The fourth season, therefore, presents viewers with Buffy, her best friends Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Xander (Nicholas Brendon), and mentor Giles (Anthony Head) at a crossroads. Series creator Joss Whedon called it a \\"strange, sort of schizophrenic season\\" with a \\"weird incoherence\\", but also stated that the episodes in the fourth season were among the series' best. The writers set out to explore the characters' trials as they discover more about themselves following the defining years of high school. Although they had been a cohesive group of friends in the first three seasons, situations arise in the fourth to separate them. The writers focused on each of the four core characters individually throughout the season to increase the impact of their finally coming back together in the penultimate episode, \\"Primeval\\", when they merge their essences to form a super-Buffy in order to defeat Adam. Actor George Hertzberg portrayed Adam in the series. George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California graduate with experience in sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being in the right place at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on Buffy start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season.Holder, et al., pp. 305‚Äì307 Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, \\"this is a guy we're going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can't just see him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [and] should scare us with his actions; but there's also innocence. Like the Frankenstein monster, you realize that they're only doing what they know. Or what they've been programmed to do. These aren't born creatures, these are creations.\\"Holder, et al., p. 347 =Make-up= When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no idea what Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the materials to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks.Holder, et al., pp. 380‚Äì384 Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.Hertzberg, George. \\"Interviews with George Hertzberg\\", BBC Cult Buffy News (2005). Retrieved on 26 November 2011. Themes Adam serves as an allusion to Frankenstein's monster. Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney states that estrangement from the self and others is the primary theme of the fourth season. To illustrate the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else.Kaveney, pp. 23‚Äì27 He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam was not the first re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. \\"Some Assembly Required\\" in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and \\"Beauty and the Beasts\\" in the third includes references to Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science.Golden and Holder, pp. 83‚Äì85Holder, et al., pp. 147‚Äì149 Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein's monster, who in the novel Frankenstein (1818) tells his creator that he is the \\"Adam of your labours\\". Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity.Stevenson, p. 133 Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein's monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam is a curious character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to \\"find the stillness\\" in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg's \\"flawed but impressive performance\\" includes Adam's interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying.Kaveney, pp. 77‚Äì78 Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam's need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein's monster: Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her.Stafford, pp. 232‚Äì233 One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein, both of whom build monsters out of body parts \\"to compensate for human vulnerability\\".South, pp. 91‚Äì93 The moral of Shelley's novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.Wilcox and Lavery, pp. 133‚Äì142Dial-Driver, pp. 67‚Äì69Wilcox, pp. 47‚Äì48 Questioning tradition and authority, specifically institutional authority, is a repeated theme on the show. Buffy was created to subvert the media trope of a young, petite girl who easily falls prey to a male monster. Resisting patriarchy is exhibited in Buffy's opposing the first season's Master (Mark Metcalf), the leader of a cult determined to cause the apocalypse, and again in the third season where exploring the issues of power and its abuse is a primary theme. Buffy opposes Sunnydale's secretly evil Mayor (Harry Groener), who is planning to transform into a giant demon and feed on the graduating class of Sunnydale High School. The military-industrial complex is at the heart of the authority question in season four, again drawing comparisons to Frankenstein. Where Frankenstein's monster had no parental love, Adam has a \\"design flaw\\". Unlike Frankenstein's monster, who needs his creator to make him a mate, Adam supplants Dr. Walsh's existence with technology, finding her unnecessary and thus he kills her. Adam is the embodiment of the lack of moral guidance in pursuing scientific and technological advancement. He represents the cannibalistic nature of relentless and unchecked power: what that power wreaks comes back to devour its source.Stevenson, pp. 130‚Äì134 Buffy, however, subverts Shelley's novel in the way Adam is defeated. Both Frankenstein and the monster must suffer alone. Frankenstein itself is an inversion of the Romantic era ideal of a solitary hero who must endure struggles, by portraying the monster and its creator as isolated and miserable. Buffy, as the embodiment of the postfeminist Romantic hero, further subverts this because the source of her success, according to Anita Rose, is that she fights with friends. Only then is she able to defeat Adam. Reception Critical reception to Adam was largely mixed, with critics' opinions ranging from negative to positive. Nikki Stafford, in her book Bite Me!: The 10th Buffyversary Guide to the World of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was critical of Adam as well as the series doing several Frankenstein-inspired episodes so close together, noting that \\"Some Assembly Required\\" was aired \\"just two seasons\\" prior. Stafford called the entire ending sequence of \\"Primeval\\", which featured the reanimated corpses of several minor characters as well as the death of Adam, \\"stupid and disgusting\\" and wrote that the scene was a main reason she was \\"happily bidding adieu\\" to the plot involving Adam and the Initiative. Jenna Busch, in her book Joss Whedon: The Complete Companion, called Adam \\"one of Buffy's least interesting Big Bads\\" and argued that his story-arc involving the Initiative was \\"rather unconvincing and somewhat off- putting\\". Other reviews were more accepting of the character. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club was slightly more positive towards the concept of Adam. He wrote that he \\"love[d] the idea of Adam\\" but was having a hard time understanding the coherence of his application to the main plot. He cited inconsistencies in Adam's existence, noting, \\"Adam killed Professor Walsh weeks ago, and yet The Initiative is still fully operational, and no one seems overly bothered by the fact that one of their leaders was building a monster.\\" Murray, however, did conclude that the show's writers and producers \\"did a decent job of bringing [the plot involving Adam] to a conclusion\\". Despite critiquing the larger plot, Murray was \\"always impressed with [Adam's] costume/make-up\\". Furthermore, he was positively surprised that it \\"took [him] a minute to recognize\\" Adam's appearance in \\"Restless\\" sans makeup.

Kellogg (April 7, 1860 ‚Äì October 6, 1951), was an American industrialist in food manufacturing, best known as the founder of the Kellogg Company, which to this day produces a wide variety of popular breakfast cereals. He was a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and practiced vegetarianism as a dietary principle taught by his church.Kellogg's Corn Flakes Newsfinder Later, he founded the Kellogg Arabian Ranch and made it into a renowned establishment for the breeding of Arabian horses. Kellogg started the Kellogg Foundation in 1934 with $66 million in Kellogg company stock and investments, a donation that would be worth over a billion dollars in today's economy. Kellogg continued to be a major philanthropist throughout his life.Kelloggs history, William Keith (W. K.) Kellogg legacy Early career As a young businessman, Kellogg started out selling brooms, before moving to Battle Creek, Michigan, to help his brother John Harvey Kellogg run the Battle Creek Sanitarium. The Sanitarium, originally the Western Health Reform Institute, was part of a pioneering effort based on the health principles advocated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. John Kellogg described the Sanitarium system as \\"a composite physiologic method comprising hydrotherapy, phototherapy, thermotherapy, electrotherapy, mechanotherapy, dietetics, physical culture, cold-air cure, eugenics, and health training\\". Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org) The Kelloggs pioneered the process of making flaked cereal. Because of the commercial potential of the discovery, Will wanted it kept a secret. However, John allowed anyone in the sanitarium to observe the flaking process and one sanitarium guest, C. W. Post, copied the process to start his own company. That company became Post Cereals and later General Foods, the source of Post's first million dollars. This upset Will to the extent that he left the sanitarium to create his own company. Kellogg cereals With the help of his brother John, Will Kellogg promoted cereals, especially corn flakes (maize), as a healthy breakfast food. They started the Sanitas Food Company around 1897, focusing on the production of their whole-grain cereals. At the time, the standard breakfast for the well-off was eggs and meat, while the poor ate porridge, farina, gruel and other boiled grains. The brothers eventually argued over the addition of sugar to their product. In 1906, Will founded the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, which later became the Kellogg Company. In 1930, he established the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, ultimately donating $66 million to it. His company was one of the first to put nutrition labels on foods. He also offered the first inside-the-box prize for children.Kellogg Company Encyclopedia of Business, 2nd Ed. Kellogg said, \\"I will invest my money in people.\\" During the Great Depression, Kellogg directed his cereal plant to work four shifts, each lasting six hours. This gave more people in Battle Creek the opportunity to work during that time. Arabian horse breeder Cal Poly Pomona). Kellogg had a longtime interest in Arabian horses. In 1925, he purchased for $250,000 in Pomona, California, to establish an Arabian horse ranch. Starting with breeding stock descended from the imports of Homer Davenport and W.R. Brown, Kellogg then looked to England, where he purchased a significant number of horses from the Crabbet Arabian Stud, making multiple importations during the 1920s. The Kellogg ranch became well known in southern California not only for its horse breeding program but also for its entertaining, weekly horse exhibitions, open to the public and frequently visited by assorted Hollywood celebrities. Among many other connections to Hollywood, the actor Rudolph Valentino borrowed the Kellogg stallion \\"Jadaan\\" for his 1926 movie Son of the Sheik, along with a Kellogg employee, Carl Raswan, who rode in certain scenes as Valentino's stunt double.Dudley, Aaron. \\"JADAAN: The Horse That Valentino Rode\\", The Western Horseman, Mar 1952 reprinted at Windt im Walt Farm, web site accessed April 5, 2010 In 1932, Kellogg donated the ranch, which had grown to , to the University of California. In 1933, the ranch obtained some of the horses sold in the dispersal of Brown's Maynesboro stud. During World War II, the ranch was taken over by the U.S. War Department and was known as the Pomona Quartermaster Depot (Remount). In 1948, the ranch was transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture; and in 1949, the land was deeded to the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. Later in 1949, title to the then ranch and horses was passed to the State of California, with the provision that the herd of Arabian horses must be maintained. The ranch became part of the Voorhis unit of what was then known as the California Polytechnic State College in San Luis Obispo. This became known as the Kellogg Campus, and in 1966, it was separated to form California State Polytechnic College, Kellogg-Voorhis.History of Cal Poly Pomona W. K. Kellogg Arabian Horse Library The ranch was also the location of the W.K. Kellogg Airport (not to be confused with the airport of the same name in Battle Creek, Michigan). It operated from 1928 to 1932, and was then the largest privately owned airport in the country. Some of Kellogg's property near Battle Creek was donated to Michigan State College and is now the Kellogg Biological Station. Death Will Keith Kellogg died at the age of 91 in Battle Creek, Michigan, on October 6, 1951, of heart failure. Kellogg outlived most of his children but was survived by two of them, Karl Hugh (d. 1955) and Elizabeth Ann (d. 1966), as well as grandson Norman Williamson, Jr. (d. 2001) and Will Keith Kellogg II (d. 2005).

Following the success of his 1946 version of Great Expectations, Lean re-assembled much of the same team for his adaptation of Dickens' 1838 novel, including producers Ronald Neame and Anthony Havelock-Allan, cinematographer Guy Green, designer John Bryan and editor Jack Harris. Lean's then-wife, Kay Walsh, who had collaborated on the screenplay for Great Expectations, played the role of Nancy. John Howard Davies was cast as Oliver, while Alec Guinness portrayed Fagin and Robert Newton played Bill Sykes (Bill Sikes in the novel). In 1999, the British Film Institute placed it at 46th in its list of the top 100 British films. In 2005 it was named in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.  Plot  A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist (John Howard Davies) by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: beadle Mr. Bumble (Francis L. Sullivan) and matron Mrs. Corney (Mary Clare). At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\\"Please sir, I want some more\\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry (Gibb McLaughlin), from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger (Anthony Newley), a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin (Alec Guinness), an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow (Henry Stephenson), a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. A witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin (Amy Veness). Meanwhile, Fagin is visited by the mysterious Monks (Ralph Truman), who has a strong interest in Oliver. He sends Monks to Bumble and Mrs. Corney (now Bumble's domineering wife); Monks buys from them the only thing that can identify Oliver's parentage, a locket containing his mother's portrait. By chance, Fagin's associate, the vicious Bill Sykes (Robert Newton), and Sykes' kind-hearted prostitute girlfriend (and former Fagin pupil) Nancy (Kay Walsh) run into Oliver on the street and forcibly take him back to Fagin. Nancy feels pangs of guilt and, seeing a poster in which Mr. Brownlow offers a reward for Oliver's return, contacts the gentleman and promises to deliver Oliver the next day. The suspicious Fagin, however, has had the Dodger follow her. When Fagin informs Sykes, the latter becomes enraged and murders her, mistakenly believing that she has betrayed him. The killing brings down the wrath of the public on the gang ‚Äî particularly Sykes who attempts to make his escape by taking Oliver hostage. Clambering over the rooftops, and with climbing rope hung around his neck, Sykes is shot by one of the mob and is accidentally hanged as he loses his footing. Mr. Brownlow and the authorities rescue Oliver. Fagin and his other associates are rounded up. Monks' part in the proceedings is discovered, and he is arrested. He was trying to ensure his inheritance; Oliver, it turns out, is Mr. Brownlow's grandson. For their involvement in Monks' scheme, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble lose their jobs at the workhouse. Oliver is happily reunited with his newly found grandfather and Mrs. Bedwin, his search for love ending in fulfillment.

Guinness wore heavy make-up, including a large prosthetic nose, to make him look like the character as he appeared in George Cruikshank's illustrations in the first edition of the novel. At the start of production, the Production Code Administration had advised David Lean to \\"bear in mind the advisability of omitting from the portrayal of Fagin any elements or inference that would be offensive to any specific racial group or religion.\\" Lean commissioned the make-up artist Stuart Freeborn to create Fagin's features; Freeborn (himself part-Jewish) had suggested to David Lean that Fagin's exaggerated profile should be toned down for fear of causing offence, but Lean rejected this idea. In a screen test featuring Guinness in toned-down make-up, Fagin was said to resemble Jesus Christ. On this basis, Lean decided to continue filming with a faithful reproduction of Cruikshank's Fagin, pointing out that Fagin was not explicitly identified as Jewish in the screenplay. The March 1949 release of the film in Germany was met with protests outside the Kurbel Cinema by Jewish objectors. The Mayor of Berlin, Ernst Reuter, was a signatory to their petition which called for the withdrawal of the film. The depiction of Fagin was considered especially problematic in the recent aftermath of the Holocaust. As a result of objections by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the New York Board of Rabbis, the film was not released in the United States until 1951, with seven minutes of profile shots and other parts of Guinness's performance cut. It received great acclaim from critics, but, unlike Lean's Great Expectations, another Dickens adaptation, no Oscar nominations. The film was banned in Israel for anti-semitism. It was banned in Egypt for portraying Fagin too sympathetically. Beginning in the 1970s, the full-length version of Lean's film began to be shown in the United States. It is that version which is now available on DVD.  Reception  The film was the fifth most popular film at the British box office in 1949. According to Kinematograph Weekly the 'biggest winner' at the box office in 1948 Britain was The Best Years of Our Lives\\" with Spring in Park Lane being the best British film and \\"runners up\\" being It Always Rains on Sunday, My Brother Jonathan, Road to Rio, Miranda, An Ideal Husband, Naked City, The Red Shoes, Green Dolphin Street, Forever Amber, Life with Father, The Weaker Sex, Oliver Twist, The Fallen Idol and The Winslow Boy. After the belated release of the film in the United States, Bosley Crowther praised it in The New York Times, writing \\"it is safe to proclaim that it is merely a superb piece of motion picture art and, beyond doubt, one of the finest screen translations of a literary classic ever made.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on reviews from 23 critics, with an average rating of 8.55/10 . The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"David Lean brings the grimy beauty of Charles Dickens' Victorian England to vivid cinematic life in Oliver Twist, a marvelous adaptation that benefits from Guy Green's haunting cinematography and Alec Guinness' off-kilter performance.\\"  Legacy  Author Marc Napolitano noted that Lean's version of Oliver Twist had an impact on almost every subsequent adaptation of Dickens's novel. The film had two major additions that were not in the original novel. Napolitano wrote, \\"The opening scene, which depicts the beleaguered and pregnant Agnes limping her way to the parish workhouse in the midst of a thunderstorm, presents a haunting image that would resonate with subsequent adaptors. Even more significantly, the finale to the Lean adaptation has eclipsed Dickens‚Äôs own finale in the popular memory of the story; the climax atop the roof of Fagin‚Äôs lair is breathtaking.\\" Songwriter Lionel Bart acknowledged that Lean's film \\"played a role in his conception\\" of the musical Oliver! Lean biographer Stephen Silverman referred to the 1968 film version of Oliver! as ‚Äúmore of an uncredited adaptation of the Lean film in story line and look than of either the Dickens novel or the Bart stage show.‚Äù Katharyn Crabbe wrote, \\"One common complaint about the form of Dickens' Oliver Twist has been that the author fell so in love with his young hero that he could not bear to make him suffer falling into Fagin's hands a third time and so made him an idle spectator in the final half of the book.\\" Author Edward LeComte credited Lean for resolving the issue in his film version, where Oliver remains \\"at the center of the action\\" and has a \\"far more heroic\\" role.Crabbe, p. 47  References = Bibliography = * Vermilye, Jerry.

The park was established in 1873 on lands formerly belonging to the temple of Kan'ei-ji. Amongst the country's first public parks, it was founded following the western example as part of the borrowing and assimilation of international practices that characterizes the early Meiji period. The home of a number of major museums, Ueno Park is also celebrated in spring for its cherry blossoms and hanami. In recent times the park and its attractions have drawn over ten million visitors a year, making it Japan's most popular city park. History Ueno Park occupies land once belonging to Kan'ei-ji, founded in 1625 in the \\"demon gate\\", the unlucky direction to the northeast of Edo Castle. Most of the temple buildings were destroyed in the Battle of Ueno in 1868 during the Boshin War, when the forces of the Tokugawa shogunate were defeated by those aiming at the restoration of imperial rule. In December of that year Ueno Hill became the property of the city of Tokyo, other than for the surviving temple buildings which include the five-storey pagoda of 1639, the Kiyomizu Kannond≈ç (or Shimizud≈ç) of 1631, and approximately coeval main gate (all designated as Important Cultural Properties of Japan). Various proposals were put forward for the use of the site as a medical school or hospital, but Dutch doctor Bauduin urged instead that the area be turned into a park. In January 1873 the Daj≈ç-kan issued a notice providing for the establishment of public parks, noting that \\"in prefectures including Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, there are places of historic interest, scenic beauty, and recreation and relaxation where people can visit and enjoy themselves, for example Sens≈ç-ji and Kan'ei- ji...\\" This was the year after the foundation of Yellowstone, the world's first national park. Later that year Ueno Park was established, alongside Shiba, Asakusa, Asukayama, and Fukugawa Parks. It was administered first by the Home Ministry's Museum Bureau, then by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, before passing to the Ministry of the Imperial Household. In 1924, in honour of the marriage of Hirohito, Ueno Park was presented to the city by Emperor Taish≈ç, receiving the official name that lasts to this day of , lit. \\"Ueno Imperial Gift Park\\". Natural features The park has some 8,800 trees, including Ginkgo biloba, Cinnamomum camphora, Zelkova serrata, Formosan cherry, Somei-Yoshino cherry, and Japanese cherry. There is a further 24,800 m2 of shrubs. Shinobazu Pond is a small lake with an area of 16 ha, extensive lotus beds, and marshland. It provides an important wintering ground for birds. Species commonly found include the tufted duck, Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, common pochard, little grebe, great egret, and great cormorant. The Baer's pochard, ring-necked duck, and American wigeon have also been recorded. The central island houses a shrine to Benzaiten, goddess of fortune, modelled on Chikubu Island in Lake Biwa. The area was once full of \\"rendezvous teahouses\\", equivalent of the modern love hotel. After the Pacific War the pond was drained and used for the cultivation of cereals and subsequently there were plans to turn the site into a baseball stadium or multi-storey carpark. The lotus pond was restored in 1949, although much of it was again accidentally drained in 1968 during work on a new subway line. In all there are some eight hundred cherry trees in the park, although with the inclusion of those belonging to the Ueno T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ shrine, temple buildings, and other neighbouring points the total reaches some twelve hundred. Inspired, Matsuo Bash≈ç wrote \\"cloud of blossoms - is the temple bell from Ueno or Asakusa\\". Cultural facilities Seiy≈çken was founded in 1872, one of the first western-style restaurants in Japan; the first coffee house followed nearby in 1888 Ueno Park is home to a number of museums. The very words in Japanese for museum as well as for art were coined in the Meiji period (from 1868) to capture Western concepts after the Iwakura Mission and other early visits to North America and Europe. The Tokyo National Museum was founded in 1872 after the first exhibition by the Museum Department of the new Ministry of Education. In the same year the Ministry of Education Museum opened, now the National Museum of Nature and Science. The National Museum of Western Art was founded in 1959 based on the collection of the industrialist (Kawasaki group) Matsukata K≈çjir≈ç; the collection was left in storage in France by Matsukata and it was returned by the French government in 1959 after the Treaty of San Francisco. The building is by Le Corbusier who used it to express his concept of the Museum of Unlimited Growth, based on an expanding spiral. It has been nominated for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Other museums include the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, dating back to 1926, and Shitamachi Museum of 1980, which is dedicated to the culture of the \\"Low City\\". The park was also chosen as home for the Japan Academy (1879), Tokyo School of Fine Arts (1889), and Tokyo School of Music (1890). The first western-style concert hall in the country, the S≈çgakud≈ç Concert Hall of 1890 (ICP) was donated to the ward in 1983 and reconstructed on another site in the park, where it is used for concerts. The Tokyo Bunka Kaikan opened in 1961 as a venue for opera and ballet, in celebration of the five hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the city of Edo. The Imperial Library was established as the national library in 1872 and opened in Ueno Park in 1906; the National Diet Library opened in Chiyoda in 1948 and the building now houses the International Library of Children's Literature. Other points of note Tokugawa Ieyasu is enshrined at Ueno T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´, dating to 1651. Flame of Hiroshima and Nagasaki' Memorial: On the right of the alley leading North to Tokugawa Ieyasu T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ shrine is a grey stone memorial with a permanently burning flame in memory of the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki of August 1945 at the end of World War II. This ‚ÄòFlame of Hiroshima and Nagasaki‚Äô memorial was initiated in Hiroshima shortly after the nuclear bombings by Mr. Tatsuo Yamamoto (1916 ‚Äì 2004), from the town of Hoshino. This flame was later merged with a flame started in Nagasaki. In 1968 members of the Tokyo's ‚ÄòShitamachi People Association‚Äô put forward the idea of lighting the flame at the precinct of Tosho-gu shrine in Tokyo's Ueno Park. In April 1989, an ‚ÄúAssociation for the Flame of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Lit at Ueno Toshogu‚Äù was founded and tens of thousands of people took part in the fundraising for over one year. The construction of the monument was completed on July 21, 1990. The dedication carved into the memorial stone states that ‚ÄúWe, hereby pledge to keep burning the A-bomb flame, convinced that this monument will contribute to strengthening the worldwide people's movement to abolish nuclear weapons and achieve peace, which is the most urgent task for the people across the borders‚Äù. Goj≈çten Jinja is dedicated to scholar Sugawara no Michizane, while neighbouring Hanazono Inari Jinja has red-bibbed Inari fox statues in an atmospheric grotto. There is a Yayoi-period burial mound on a small hill near the park's centre. For a decade until 1894 there was horse racing near Shinobazu Pond. Nowadays there is a baseball field, named in honour of poet Masaoka Shiki, fan of the sport. As well as the first art museum in Japan, the park had the first zoo, first tram, first May Day celebrations (in 1920), and staged a number of industrial expositions. Ueno Station opened nearby in 1883. After the Great Kant≈ç earthquake in 1923, notices of missing persons were attached to the statue of Saig≈ç Takamori. Ueno Park and its surroundings figure prominently in Japanese fiction, including The Wild Geese by Mori ≈ågai. =Homeless= Many homeless people squat in Ueno Park. Found among the park's treelines and wooded areas, homeless camps border on the size of small villages, with an internal structure, culture, and support system. The long- term shelters are typically constructed of cardboard covered with blue tarps. The police occasionally tear down the camps and drive out or arrest the homeless, who return as soon as they can. While squatting is illegal in Japan, homelessness is seen as an endemic problem in Tokyo and other cities, and the presence of squatters is accepted as an inevitability.

Based in Alice Springs, the organisation is particularly focused on the involvement of the local Indigenous community in its production. CAAMA is involved in radio, television and recorded music. History=Origins and Imparja= In 1980, CAAMA originally established itself as a public radio station by two Aboriginal people and one ‚Äòwhitefella‚Äô, Freda Glynn, Phillip Batty and John Macumba. The success of the station quickly grew, leading its content to extend into music (country-western and Aboriginal rock), call-ins, discussion, and news and current affairs. Broadcasts were made in six different languages, alongside English, and operated about fifteen hours every day. Later expansions saw the station move into AM and shortwave broadcasts with educational programmes, live recordings of Aboriginal bands, and commercials for local Aboriginal products and services. In 1984, CAAMA started to produce a video newsletter to circulate to those communities without easy access to radio facilities. CAAMA obtained its Regional Commercial Television Services license in 1986 after concern was raised that Australia‚Äôs first satellite (AUSSAT), which was set to bring commercial television to regional and remote sections of Australia, would have a detrimental impact on Aboriginal languages and cultures in Central Australia. CAAMA made a bid to obtain the licence being offered in 1985 via the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal Central Zone RCTS licence hearings process. CAAMA's bid was a symbolic act that was then taken seriously, as ‚Äúthe tribunal provided the arena for the articulation of national media policies at least nominally in support of the concerns of remote-living Aboriginal people.‚ÄùGinsburg, Faye (1993) Embedded Aesthetics: Creating A Discursive Space for Indigenous Media,\\" Cultural Anthropology 9(2) In January, 1988 the private commercial television station CAAMA owned, Imparja, began broadcasting, servicing at least 100,000 viewers in Central Australia.Batty, Philip (1992). \\"Singing the Electric: Aboriginal Television in Australia.\\" Unpublished Manuscript Imparja had contributed to a visible increase of Aboriginal identity in the Australian media landscape. The station was crucial in developing content which attempted to maintain and sustain Aboriginal culture. One example included Nganampa- Anwernekenbe [Ours], the first entirely indigenous language television programme sub-titled in English produced in Australia, which reflected Aboriginal culture through story telling and unique performing and visual arts content. Another were the \\"Bath Time Good Time\\" cleanliness and \\"Cus Congress\\" anti alcohol community service advertisements which aimed to promote better life style and health in a culturally appropriate and effective manner. 1991 saw a turn to independently created films about, or created by, Aboriginal people. The series of films lasted several months and aired every Saturday during its production season. During the first few years of Imparja, CAAMA faced growing concerns from media activists that commercial programming would consume local content (Michaels 1984). Other concerns were raised of the lack of Aboriginal presence in Imparja‚Äôs programming (Batty 1992) that, although Imparja was the largest television enterprise owned by Aboriginal people in Australia, only 10% its staff were Aboriginal (Ginsburg 1993); that some broadcasts reflected a lack of sufficient Aboriginal programming content; and others raised issues of broadcast quality.Molnar, Helen (1989). \\"Aboriginal Broadcasting in Australia: Challenges and Promises.\\" Paper presented at the International Communication Association Conference, March 1989 In saying this, the importance of CAAMA‚Äôs multi-media based approached has ensured that Aboriginal media is an important part to the Australian media landscape and to the social, cultural, and economic development of Aboriginal people in remote parts of Australia, as seen by CAAMA‚Äôs recent employment policies. American anthropologist Faye Ginsburg who has written extensively on Indigenous/Aboriginal media in Australia writes: \\"Aboriginal media products are as various as Aboriginal life itself, ranging from low-budget videos made by community-based media associations for both traditional people in remote settlements and groups throughout Central Australia by organisations such as the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA); to legal or instructional videos (often quite creative) made by land councils as well as health and other service groups; to documentaries and current affairs for national broadcasting; to independent features directed by cosmopolitan Aboriginal artists such as Tracey Moffatt whose first feature film, Bedevil, premiered at Cannes in 1993.\\" (1994:366)Ginsburg, Faye (1991). \\"Indigenous Media: Faustian Contract or Global Village?\\" Cultural Anthropology, 6(1): 92‚Äì112. [1994] reprinted in Rereading Cultural Anthropology. G. Marcus, ed. CAAMA works in a broader landscape of Aboriginal/Indigenous media organisations based in Australia. Some other organisations include Gadigal Information Service, Goolarri Media Enterprise/Broome Aboriginal Media Association, Top End Aboriginal Bush Broadcasting Association, and the National Indigenous Times. =Recent History and Employment Initiatives= In 2005 CAAMA submitted a report to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs‚Äô inquiry into Indigenous employment. The report outlined several ways government leaders could access future policy in regards to Indigenous employment, using CAAMA as a case study. Some key issues CAAMA raised included: skills training; funding; recruitment; increase in Indigenous population; youth employment; strengthening links between education and training; establish and sustain networks between the private and public sectors, alongside the community; and collaborate with pre-existing organisations in training Aboriginal people. The second section of the report outlined how CAAMA has contributed to the training and employment of Aboriginal people in Central Australia. In their twenty-five years of operations CAAMA has an active ‚Äòaboriginalisation policy,‚Äô which means 65% of employees are Aboriginal. CAAMA has also assisted in the education of over 100 Indigenous people, of whom a majority of their trainees were part of the Major Indigenous Employment Strategy (1988‚Äì1993). CAAMA suggest that their success has been afforded by the commitment of government; implementation of the Major Indigenous Employment Strategy; an understanding of social, cultural, and economic issues impacting Aboriginal people; and their flexible learning environment. Since 2009 CAAMA has development a business plan to identity ways to enhance their viability and sustainability with less reliance on government funding, and to increase new opportunities in New Media products and other related services and products. Services=CAAMA Radio= CAAMA Radio provides twenty-four hours Indigenous radio programming to over 600,000 people in Australia. It is the largest Aboriginal media organisation in the country since 1981, with the second largest audience reach in Australia. CAAMA broadcast through 12 Remote Aboriginal Communities Services (RIBS) and a mobile outside broadcasting truck, providing radio to several remote Aboriginal communities in over 30 different languages, including Papunya, Ntaria (Hermansbug), Ltyentye Apurte (Santa Teresa), and Areyonga. =Film and Television Production= CAAMA Productions Pty Ltd is the largest Indigenous owned production house in Australia, with programming based on Indigenous cultures, lifestyle, and issues. Some of CAAMA's award-winning productions include: * My Colour Your Kind (1998): Written and Directed by Danielle Maclean. My Colour Your Kind is a short film which explores the journey of a young Aboriginal albino girl. * Cold Turkey (2003): Written and directed by Steven McGregor, Cold Turkey is a film which portrays the lives of brothers Shane and Robby and explores the changing nature of their relationship. * Green Bush (2005): Written and directed by Warwick Thornton. Green Bush is the story of local radio DJ Kenny and his audience - the local prison inmates. * Double Trouble (Australian TV series) (2007): The first Aboriginal produced for children. Double Trouble aired on Australia's National Nine Network and the Disney Channel. * Samson and Delilah (Co-production with Scarlett Pictures): The Australian drama film directed by Warwick Thornton and starring Rowan McNamara and Marissa Gibson, both young first time actors. The film competed at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, winning the Cam√©ra d'Or ('Gold Camera Award' for best first feature film) at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The film also won the Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Film in 2009. =Music= CAAMA Music is a record label which produces 90% of its recordings in Indigenous languages. Performances organised by CAAMA have been popular with audiences, with people travelling from across the area to attend. One recent event, the Yeperenye Festival, drew a crowd of 30,000. Musicians like Gawurra and Alice Skye, who are recorded by CAAMA are also seen on the Imparja, SBS and ABC television networks. In conjunction with CAAMA Radio, CAAMA Music transmits outside broadcasts of performances by Aboriginal musicians. =Technical Services= CAAMA Technical Services works with CAAMA and local communities to ensure technical equipment in Aboriginal communities is in working order, alongside providing information and technological services to these communities. =Imparja= Imparja Television Pty Ltd is a commercial television station operative from Alice Springs. =Shops= CAAMA Shops Pty Ltd is a retail and wholesale outlet and distributes products (videos, music, literature, craft, etc.) created by Aboriginal people in the local area. Former trainees from CAAMA Successful CAAMA Indigenous trainees include Rachel Perkins (AFI award-winning Writer/Director), Beck Cole (Writer/Director, official Sundance selection), Allan Collins (Director/Cinematographer, AFI awarding winning Cinematographer), Daniele McLean (AFI awarding winning Writer/Director), Warwick Thornton (Director/Cinematographer, winner of Berlin Film Festival), Erica Glynn (Writer/Director, AFI nominee), Priscilla Collins (Executive Producer, AFI nominee), Peter Clarke (Online Editor, Imparja Television), and Angela Bates (Journalist, SBS Television).  Effects on society  It has been argued that the establishment of CAAMA and the spread of communications technology could threaten the relationship between generations and the respect for traditional knowledge.Ginsburg, F: \\"Aboriginal media and the Australian imaginary\\",page 96.

A coach may also be a teacher. History The original sense of the word coach is that of a horse-drawn carriage, deriving ultimately from the Hungarian city of Kocs where such vehicles were first made. Students at the University of Oxford in the early nineteenth century used the slang word to refer to a private tutor who would drive a less able student through his examinations just like horse driving. Britain took the lead in upgrading the status of sports in the 19th century. For sports to become professionalized, \\"coacher\\" had to become established. It gradually professionalized in the Victorian era and the role was well established by 1914. In the First World War, military units sought out the coaches to supervise physical conditioning and develop morale-building teams.Dave Day, Professionals, Amateurs and Performance: Sports Coaching in England, 1789‚Äì1914(2012) Support staff A coach, particularly in a professional league, is usually supported by one or more assistant coaches and specialist support staff. The staff may include coordinators, strength and fitness specialists, and trainers. In elite sport, the role of nutritionists, biomechanists and physiotherapists will all become critical to the overall long-term success of a coach and athlete. They work on the over all responsibility of their athletes. Association football The coaching team of the Liverpool Football Club monitoring players during a training session In association football, the duties of a coach can vary depending on the level they are coaching at and the country they are coaching in, amongst others. In youth football, the primary objective of a coach is to aid players in the development of their technical skills, with emphasis on the enjoyment and fair play of the game rather than physical or tactical development. In recent decades, efforts have been made by governing bodies in various countries to overhaul their coaching structures at youth level with the aim of encouraging coaches to put player development and enjoyment ahead of winning matches. In professional football, the role of the coach or trainer is limited to the training and development of a club's \\"first team\\" in most countries. The coach is aided by a number of assistant coaches, one of which carries the responsibility for the training and preparation of the goalkeepers. The coach is also assisted by medical staff and athletic trainers. The medium to long- term strategy of a football club, with regard to transfer policies, youth development and other sporting matters, is not the business of a coach in most football countries. The presence of a sporting director is designed to give the medium term development of a club the full attention of one professional, allowing the coach to focus on improving and producing performances from the players under their charge. The system also provides a certain level of protection against overspending on players in search of instant success. In football, the director of a professional football team is more commonly awarded the position of manager, a role that combines the duties of coach and sporting director. The responsibilities of a European football manager tend to be divided up in North American professional sports, where the teams usually have a separate general manager and head coach, although occasionally a person may fill both roles of general manager and head coach. While the first team coach in football is usually an assistant to the manager who actually holds the real power, the American style general manager and head coach have clearly distinct areas of responsibilities. For example, a typical European football manager would have the final say on player lineups and contract negotiations, while in American sports these duties would be handled separately by the head coach and general manager, respectively. Baseball In baseball, at least at the professional level in North America, the individual who heads the coaching staff does not use the title of \\"head coach\\", but is instead called the field manager. Baseball \\"coaches\\" at that level are members of the coaching staff under the overall supervision of the manager, with each coach having a specialized role. The baseball field manager is essentially equivalent a head coach in other American professional sports leagues; player transactions are handled by the general manager. The term manager used without qualification almost always refers to the field manager, while the general manager is often called the GM. At amateur levels, the terminology is more similar to that of other sports. The person known as the \\"manager\\" in professional leagues is generally called the \\"head coach\\" in amateur leagues; this terminology is standard in U.S. college baseball. American football In American football, like many other sports, there are many coaches and assistant coaches. American football includes a head coach, an assistant head coach, an offensive coordinator, a defensive coordinator, a special teams coordinator, offensive and defensive line coaches, coaches for every position, and a strength and conditioning coach, among other positions. United Kingdom Sports coaching in the UK follows a highly structured pattern in principle, but is delivered by a workforce which is largely volunteer-based. Recognising the pivotal role played by coaches in increasing participation and performance in sport, each of the UK's Home Country Sports Councils has a coaching strategy aligned to their overall strategy. In June 2008, the Sports Councils together with the national governing bodies of sport (NGBs) formally adopted the UK Coaching Framework at the UK Coaching Summit in Coventry. More than thirty sports have their coach education programmes endorsed as meeting the standards of the UK Coaching Certificate (UKCC) as an indication of quality assurance. Typically, such programmes classify coaches within Levels 1‚Äì4, with Level 2 being the minimum standard for someone to coach unaccompanied. Coach education programmes are usually organised centrally by the NGBs but delivered locally to meet the needs of volunteer coaches. For anyone wanting to become a coach in a particular sport, the NGB website provides the first point of contact for further information. Each of the counties in England has a County Sports Partnership (CSP) funded by Sport England which supports local coaching networks to bring coaches from different sports together to share best practice and gain further continuing professional development (CPD). Similar arrangements exist across Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The safeguarding and protection of children in sport has been a major focus for sports coach UK and the NSPCC for many years. Short workshops on safeguarding are the most popular of all CPD sessions organised by sports coach UK and delivered across the CSP network. The UK government, through DCMS, highlighted the need for detailed research into sports coaching patterns. As a result, major tracking studies have been completed. These confirm that three in every four coaches are volunteers, typically giving up three hours a week to coach their sport. Fewer than 5% of coaches in the UK are full-time professionals, in stark contrast to the USA. United States All major U.S. collegiate sports have associations for their coaches to engage in professional development activities, but some sports' professional coaches have less formal associations, without developing into a group resembling a union in the way that athletic players in many leagues have. U.S. collegiate coaching contracts require termination without the payment of a settlement if the coach is found to be in serious violation of named rules, usually with regard to the recruiting or retention of players in violation of amateur status. The NFL head coaches have an association, called NFL Coaches Association (NFLCA), which includes all the coaches in the NFL, except New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Many coaching contracts allow the termination of the coach with little notice and without specific cause, usually in the case of high-profile coaches with the payment of a financial settlement. Coaching is a very fickle profession, and a reversal of the team's fortune often finds last year's \\"Coach of the Year\\" to be seeking employment in the next. Many coaches are former players of the sport themselves, and coaches of professional sports teams are sometimes retired players. On some teams, the principal coach (usually referred to as the head coach) has little to do with the development of details such as techniques of play or placement of players on the playing surface, leaving this to assistants while concentrating on larger issues such as recruitment and organizational development. Successful coaches often become as well or even better-known than the athletes they coach, and in recent years have come to command high salaries and have agents of their own to negotiate their contracts with the teams. Often the head coach of a well-known team has his or her own radio and television programs and becomes the primary \\"face\\" associated with the team. Both the collegiate and professional-level coaches may have contracts for millions of dollars a year. The head coach at the professional level has more time to devote to tactics and playbooks, which are combed over by staff that are usually paid more than at the college level. The pro level head coaching, due to the extensive time on the road and long hours, is a very stressful job. Since the money is good at high levels, many coaches retire in their early fifties. Also, professional staffs are not limited in the number of assistants which can be hired, NCAA Division I FBS teams are limited to nine full-time assistant coaches. Many factors are part of NFL coaches' contracts. These involve the NFL's $11 billion as the highest-revenue sport in North America, topping Major League Baseball's (MLB) $7 billion, while holding a non-taxpaying exemption that the MLB does not. The unusual distinction of being a tax-exempt multibillion-dollar corporation and a tax- exempt monopoly that can move teams from one city to another, is combined with stadiums sometimes built through tax-free borrowing by the cities, which every American taxpayer pays for in public subsidies. The NFL's coaches are the highest-paid professional coaches with professional football topping the list in Forbes' highest-paid sports coaches. Bill Belichick was in the top spot for the second year in a row with no MLB or National Hockey League coaches making the list. Another major element of NFL coaches' contracts, negotiated between individual coaches and NFL \\"teams\\" and owners, are NFL-demanded provisions in the coaches' employment contracts, that authorize the employing NFL teams to withhold part of a coach's salary when league operations are suspended, such as during lockouts or television contract negotiations. Preparation Coaching courses and training seminars are increasingly available. Some colleges offer degrees in coaching. While many coaching jobs also require certifications before they can be put in charge of a team. One important role of coaches, especially youth coaches, is establishing safety for school-age athletes. This requires knowledge of CPR, prevention of dehydration, and following current concussion management guidelines. Game plan Coaches also often create game plans, or instructions for what their players will do during the game. For every sport, there are different game plans. For example, in association football, the coach may choose to have a goalkeeper, four defenders, four midfielders, and two forwards. However, a coach may also choose to have a goalkeeper, four defenders, three midfielders, and three forwards. It is up to the coaches to decide how many players will play a certain position at a time, as long as they do not surpass the maximum number of players allowed on the playing field at one time. It is also up to the coaches to decide where and when a certain player is going to play.

It is the main and largest of the islands in the Maraj√≥ Archipelago. The island is bordered by the mouth of the Amazon River to the west and northwest, the Atlantic Ocean to the northeast and by the Par√° River, a distributary of the Amazon to the east. From approximately 400 BC to 1600 AD, Maraj√≥ was the site of an advanced Pre-Columbian society called the Marajoara culture, which may have numbered more than 100,000 people at its peak. Today, the island is known for its large water buffalo population, as well as the pororoca tidal bore periodically exhibited by high tides overcoming the usual complex hydrodynamic interactions in the surrounding reaches of Amazon delta. It is the second-largest island in South America, and the 35th largest island in the world. With a land area of Maraj√≥ is comparable in size to Switzerland.

The outflow from the Amazon between January and July is so great that the sea at the mouth is made up of freshwater for some distance from shore. The city of Bel√©m lies to the south across the southern fork (also called the Par√° River) of the river's mouth. The island sits almost directly on the equator. Together with smaller neighboring islands that are separated from Maraj√≥ by rivers, they form the Maraj√≥ Archipelago, with an aggregate area of .

Large parts of the islands are flooded during the rainy season because of higher water levels of the Amazon River along the coast and heavy rainfall in the interior. Maraj√≥ is almost entirely flat. During the rainy season, much of the island becomes flooded as a large lake. There are 20 large rivers on the island. Because of the changing water levels and regular seasonal flooding, many settlements are built on stilts (Palafitas). The island is known for the pororoca, a tidal bore phenomenon in the river that creates large waves reaching in height. It is a tourist destination, especially for surfing of the bore. = Ecology = Water buffalo on Maraj√≥ The eastern side of the island is dominated by savanna vegetation. There are large fazendas with animal husbandry. This is also the location of Lake Arari, which has an area of , but shrinks by 80% during the dry season. There are large herds of domesticated water buffalo, which are technically invasive to the island; they now number about 450,000, higher than the island's human population. The western side of the island is characterized by V√°rzea forests and small farms. Lumber and a√ßa√≠ are produced there. The island is in the Maraj√≥ v√°rzea ecoregion, an area of seasonally and tidally flooded v√°rzea forest. To the north of the large savanna area are palm swamps, mainly with Buriti Palm (Mauritia flexuosa) and Euterpe oleracea. During the rainy season, the swamps are flooded one meter high. Little is known about the ecology of these swamps. =Municipalities= The most important towns are in the southeastern portion of the island: Soure, Salvaterra, and the largest city, Breves. They feature a basic touristic infrastructure and are popular because of the generous, lightly populated beaches. The city of Soure, on the island's Atlantic coast, serves as an entry point to the island via its ferry link to Bel√©m. The island is shared by 16 municipalities of three microregions: * Microregion of Arari:  Cachoeira do Arari  Chaves  Muan√°  Ponta de Pedras  Salvaterra  Santa Cruz do Arari  Soure * Microregion of Furos de Breves:  Afu√°  Anaj√°s  Breves  Curralinho  S√£o Sebasti√£o da Boa Vista * Microregion of Portel:  Bagre  Gurup√°  Melga√ßo  Portel  History  The island was the site of an advanced pre-Columbian society, the Marajoara culture, which existed from approximately 400 BC to 1600 AD. The island has been a center of archaeological exploration and scholarship since the nineteenth century. Scholars from the 1980s forward have divided the pre-Columbian period into the Ananatuba phase (c. 1100‚Äìc. 200 BC), the Mangueiras phase (c. 1000 BC‚Äìc. 100 AD), the Formiga phase (c. 100-400 AD), the Marajoar√° phase (c. 400-1200 AD), and the Aru√£ phase (1200-1500 AD). Since the 1990s, there has been debate over the origins and sophistication of Maraj√≥'s pre-Columbian society. Based on fieldwork in the 1940s and 1950s, the archaeologist Betty Meggers initially argued that the Marajoara culture had been founded by emigrants from the Andes and that the society steadily declined until its final collapse at approximately 1400 AD, due to the Maraj√≥'s poor soil fertility and other environmental factors. Megger's hypotheses subsequently became associated with environmental determinism. Her theory has since been rejected, however, by the archaeologist Anna Curtenius Roosevelt, who re-excavated Maraj√≥ in the 1980s. According to Roosevelt, the Marajoara culture developed independently within the Amazon and featured both intensive subsistence agriculture and major public works. Roosevelt estimated that Maraj√≥ may have had a population of more than 100,000 people at its peak. The population lived in homes with tamped earth floors, organized themselves into matrilineal clans, and divided tasks by sex, age, and skill level. The arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century was catastrophic to the indigenous population of the island; 90% died due to high mortality from Eurasian infectious diseases; they lacked immunity against these diseases that had become endemic in European and Asian cities. In contrast, however, during the 1918‚Äì1919 pandemic worldwide of the Spanish influenza, Maraj√≥ was the only major populated area not to have any documented cases of the illness. The island is also the location of the Roman Catholic Territorial Prelature of Maraj√≥.

It was discovered on 6 February 1981, by American astronomer Norman Thomas at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, United States. Originally, this asteroid was the target of the 1998 Deep Space 1 mission, but that mission was eventually rerouted to 9969 Braille. It was named in memory of Challenger crew member Christa McAuliffe.  Orbit  McAuliffe orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.2‚Äì2.6 AU once every 2 years and 7 months (941 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.37 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of , which translates into 79.5 lunar distances. Due to its eccentric orbit, McAuliffe is also a Mars-crosser. As no precoveries were taken, and no prior identifications were made, the body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa in 1981.  Physical characteristics = Spectral type = In the SMASS taxonomy, McAuliffe is a rare A-type asteroid, meaning that it is rich in olivine. In addition, the large-scale survey conducted by PanSTARRS also classified as a SQ-type, a transitional type between the common stony and Q-type asteroids, indicating the presence of pyroxene minerals. = Diameter and albedo = The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.18 and derives a diameter of 1.99 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 16.068, a figure previously obtained by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, and later revised by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec. = Rotation period = Between 1998 and 2016, a several rotational lightcurves of McAuliffe have been obtained from photometric observations taken by astronomers Petr Pravec at Ond≈ôejov Observatory, Czech Republic, by Andreas Howell at Willowcroft Observatory, Florida, as well as by Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory, Colorado, and at the Center for Solar System Studies, California. The best- rated lightcurve gave a rotation period of 2.206 to 2.212 hours with a brightness variation between 0.08 and 0.12 magnitude (). = Suspected moon = During the photometric observations in March 2012, Brian Warner found evidence of the existence of a minor-planet moon orbiting McAuliffe every 20.86 hours. However, it is only a \\"possible\\" synchronous binary system, as no mutual eclipsing/occultation events were observed. Follow-up observations in September and October 2016, did not confirm the binary nature of McAuliffe.  DS 1 mission  McAuliffe together with comet 76P/West‚ÄìKohoutek‚ÄìIkemura had been the original fly-by targets for the Deep Space 1 (DS1) mission. Launched was scheduled for 1 July 1998. A delay in the delivery of the spacecraft's power electronics system as well as insufficient time to test the flight software, caused the launch to be postponed to 24 October 1998. Due to this delay, new targets had to be selected. In July 1999, DS1 passed the alternative target 9969 Braille a distance of 15 kilometers, in January 2001, comet 107P/Wilson‚ÄìHarrington was encountered, and in September 2001, short- period comet 19P/Borrelly was passed at distance of only 2,200 kilometers.  Naming  This minor planet was named in memory of Christa McAuliffe (1948‚Äì1986), teacher, civilian astronaut and one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on 28 January 1986. The minor planets , , , , , and were named for the other crew members of the ill-fated STS-51-L mission. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 26 March 1986 ().

The majority of scholars believe that the Prayer of Manasseh was written in Greek in the first or second century BC. Another work by the same title, written in Hebrew and containing distinctly different content, was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Manasseh is recorded in the Bible as one of the most idolatrous kings of Judah (; ). The second Book of Chronicles, but not the second Book of Kings, records that Manasseh was taken captive by the Assyrians (). While a prisoner, Manasseh prayed for mercy, and upon being freed and restored to the throne turned from his idolatrous ways (). A reference to the prayer, but not the prayer itself, is made in , which says that the prayer is written in \\"the annals of the kings of Israel\\". The prayer is considered apocryphal by Jews, Catholics and Protestants. It was placed at the end of 2 Chronicles in the late 4th-century Vulgate. Over a millennium later, Martin Luther included the prayer in his 74-book translation of the Bible into German. It was part of the 1537 Matthew Bible, and the 1599 Geneva Bible. It also appears in the Apocrypha of the King James Bible and of the original 1609/1610 Douai-Rheims Bible. Pope Clement VIII included the prayer in an appendix to the Vulgate. The prayer is included in some editions of the Greek Septuagint. For example, the 5th century Codex Alexandrinus includes the prayer among fourteen Odes appearing just after the Psalms.NET Bible It is accepted as a deuterocanonical book by Orthodox Christians. The prayer is chanted during the Orthodox Christian and Byzantine Catholic service of Great Compline. It is used in the Roman Rite as part of the Responsory after the first reading in the Office of Readings on the 14th Sunday in Ordinary Time (along with Psalm 51). In the Extraordinary Form, in the Roman Rite Breviary; in the corpus of responsories sung with the readings from the books of Kings between Trinity Sunday and August, the seventh cites the Prayer of Manasseh, together with verses of Psalm 50, the penitential Psalm par excellence.Gregory Dipipo (2017). \\"Actual Apocrypha in the Liturgy\\" New Liturgical Movement (blog). It is used also as a canticle in the Daily Office of the 1979 U.S. Book of Common Prayer used by the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, and as Canticle 52 in Common Worship: Daily Prayer of the Church of England. The prayer appears in ancient Syriac,Ariel Gutman and Wido van Peursen. The Two Syriac Versions of the Prayer of Manasseh. Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press.
