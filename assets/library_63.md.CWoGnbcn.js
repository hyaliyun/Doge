They may be standing organizations with a regional responsibility, or may be established for a particular operational purpose. While EAC most commonly refer to ground combat forces, they may refer to joint commands. They may also be administrative headquarters with responsibility for preparing combat forces. While there were a significant number of EAC in World War II, with increasing power of smaller organizations, it may not be required to have a ground force of the size of: :*Field army, made up of two or more corps plus units under the direct control of the army commander :*Army group, composed of two or more field armies plus units subordinated to the army group commander :*Theater, composed of all land, sea, and air forces in a geographic area Even in World War II, while the Western Allies used these terms, they were not universal. A Soviet army was roughly equivalent to a US or Commonwealth corps, with a front roughly equivalent to an army group. Japanese armies were also equivalent to US or Commonwealth corps, an area army to a western field army, and a general army to a theater. Current US concepts of EAC The US Army divides types of troops into combat arms (infantry, armor, artillery, aviation, special forces), combat support (intelligence, communications, engineer, military police) and combat service support (supply, maintenance, medical, transportation, chaplain, finance and administration). =Combat support= Military police, in the current environment, often are in a combat role. Doctrine is catching up with reality, as in Panama, and most recently in Iraq, with the Raven 42 patrol led by Staff Sergeant Timothy Nein and Sergeant Leigh Ann Hester, where a woman, for the first time, received the Silver Star medal, and qualified for the Combat Action Badge. Raven 42, a unit of the 617th Military Police Company of the Kentucky National Guard, was on a convoy escort mission where combat was reasonable to expect, as opposed to the rear area MP units guarding prisons and POWs. = Combat service support = Thomas J. Newman, a Quartermaster Corps major in 1993, analyzes the roles of combat service support at EAC. It must be remembered that US Army doctrine was in flux as his monograph was being developed, analyzing the lessons learned from Operation Desert Storm, but the Army not yet gone to the major restructuring into units of action/brigade combat teams and units of employment. [from the abstract] > Army concepts for supporting operations involving multiple corps were called > into question by actions taken during Operations Desert Shield and Desert > Storm. Non-doctrinal organizations provided support to U.S. forces deployed > on these operations, despite the fact that doctrinally correct organizations > existed.

The monograph concludes that existing > doctrine for support at echelons above corps requires revision, that- > emerging doctrine is on the right track, and that a key requirement will be > for the Army to identify a way to test new doctrine in a realistic manner. Existence of EAC's between US corps and unified commands Still in use in US forces are Unified Combatant Commands, roughly equivalent to a theater. Multinational Force Iraq (MNF-I) is a level of command comparable to a reinforced field army.

Lee Thompson and starring Robert Mitchum, Ellen Burstyn and Rock Hudson. It was the last theatrical release starring Rock Hudson before his death in October 1985. Plot U.S. Ambassador to Israel Peter Hacker (Robert Mitchum) and head of security Frank Stevenson (Rock Hudson) are en route to a secret location in the Judean desert to meet with representatives of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). It is part of Hacker’s secret plan to have young Jews and Muslims begin a peaceful dialogue. An armed Israeli helicopter locates and disrupts the meeting by firing on it, causing several deaths. Hacker and Stevenson survive and are apprehended by the Israeli military. Alex Hacker (Ellen Burstyn), the ambassador’s troubled and lonely wife is in Jerusalem where she is secretly meeting her lover. However, she is followed and their tryst is caught on videotape by an unknown entity. Hacker and Stevenson are taken to the office of Israeli Defense Minister Eretz (Donald Pleasence) who confronts them for not informing him on the meeting and reiterates his opposition to Hacker’s peace efforts. Upon returning to the American embassy, Stevenson makes contact to a secret superior where he also voices his concerns and wishes to see an end to Hacker’s assignment as ambassador. At a diplomatic function later that night, Alex is drunk and making a scene. She leaves early by taxi to meet with her lover once again. While Alex calls her husband from a phone booth in front of his apartment an explosion goes off injuring her and killing several others. Hacker and Stevenson head back to the ambassador’s residence, not knowing Alex’s whereabouts. Hacker is telephoned by an unknown man telling him to make contact at a movie theater, alone. After his arrival he enters the damaged building where the film of his wife’s infidelity plays on a movie screen. Stevenson, who is not far behind, shares in the discovery. Hacker is informed that his wife is safe and making a full recovery in a hospital. Hacker and Stevenson visit her, where she tells him that she wants to get out of Israel. Back in his office Hacker is again contacted by the unknown man. Conditions are made that if one million dollars in hush money is not paid the film will be released and a private copy will be made available for the President of the United States. Hacker refuses. They also mention the name of Alex’s lover, prompting him to have Stevenson investigate further. Hacker later confronts his wife that night, and tells her about the scheme to blackmail him. Alex again visits her lover to find his true identity. He turns out to be Mustapha Hashimi (Fabio Testi), a wealthy business man and PLO member. Minister Eretz is informed of the situation and finds the film was made by Mossad agents to keep tabs on the Hackers, although some prints of the film have since been stolen. Stevenson makes headway finding the location where the film was developed and visits the print shop looking for answers. After being duped and knocked out, he catches a woman from the shop and offers her protection. She then reveals the identity of the blackmailers. Hashimi is also blackmailed, for $500,000, and decides to pay. After learning of this, Hacker sets up a meeting with Hashimi and sees an opportunity to use Hashimi's influence within the PLO to have a peaceful meeting between Jewish and Muslim students. Having learned the identity of the blackmailers from the print shop woman, Stevenson interrogates the blackmailers, who reveal that Hacker is being pursued by a KGB assassin named Stone. Hacker conducts the meeting with Israeli and Palestinian students at an ancient Roman ruin outside of Tel Aviv and it ends on a positive note with real progress being made between the two groups. However, Palestinian terrorists ambush the students, causing a bloodbath and Hashimi’s assassination. Israeli authorities, Alex and Stevenson arrive to find Hacker alive and head back to the residence where the KGB assassin (Stone) is waiting for Hacker. Just as Stone is about to make a clean shot from his car, Stevenson shoots Stone in the back of the head, leaving the ambassador unscathed. While sitting with his wife, Hacker tells her that he is thinking of resigning, but she disagrees and favors him staying on. He later walks outside onto his front porch only to see a group of young Israeli students holding a peace rally, bringing him to tears.

Leonard is not credited on the final credits and says on his official site, \\"Monahem (sic) Golan hired me to adapt my novel, Fifty Two Pickup, and set it in Tel Aviv.

It has none of my characters, none of my situations, nothing. But he still owed me for the screen rights and had to pay up before he could release the picture.\\" The Ambassador is the first film adaptation of Leonard's novel; Cannon Films remade it in 1986 under its original title, 52 Pick-Up, this time directed by John Frankenheimer.

The site is now insolvent and not processing player withdrawals. Cereus is owned by a private company, Blanca Games. Blanca Games bought all Network assets in August 2010 from Tokwiro Enterprises. The Cereus network was one of the world's ten largest online poker cardrooms prior to losing the majority of its player base in the wake of the April 15, 2011 online poker indictments. Absolute Poker Absolute Poker was established in 2003. It was licensed by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission. =2007 cheating incident= In September 2007, Absolute Poker began defending itself following accusations made by members of several Internet forums that the online poker room has a \\"superuser\\" account which allows one player to read the hole cards of another during a game. By October, widespread Internet allegations of cheating led to the Kahnawake Gaming Commission beginning an investigation.Associated Press: Kahnawake Gaming Commission Starts Probe into AbsolutePoker.com eGaming Review: Absolute engulfed in cheating scandal Although allegations had been made about several accounts, one of the most remarkable pieces of evidence was a complete history of a tournament which was won by a player called \\"POTRIPPER\\". This history was far more complete than normal; it included all hidden hole cards for all of the players at the table, and the IP addresses of players and third-party observers who were watching the game via the Internet. It was sent out, perhaps by accident, when a player complained about suspicious play. Reviewing the data, mathematician and gaming expert Michael Shackleford said: > Hand after hand POTRIPPER’s play is consistent with that of a player who had > knowledge of every player’s hole cards. The majority of hands show POTRIPPER > bluffing at just the right times when his opponents were weak. Yet, when he > was hopelessly outmatched, even with good cards, he laid them down. Shackleford subsequently blacklisted Absolute Poker on his gaming-related website. On October 19, an unofficial source within Absolute Poker claimed that an employee had hacked the system to \\"prove a point\\". On October 21, Absolute released an official statement: > ...it appears that the integrity of our poker system was compromised by a > high-ranking trusted consultant employed by AP whose position gave him > extraordinary access to certain security systems. As has been speculated in > several online forums, this consultant devised a sophisticated scheme to > manipulate internal systems to access third-party computers and accounts to > view hole cards of other customers during play without their knowledge. > [...] We will pay for all losses suffered by the affected players as soon as > our audit is finished and the amounts are determined. In November 2007, Absolute issued an interim statement claiming the employee cheating had taken place over a period of forty days and that the cardroom was refunding $1.6 million to affected players.AllIn Magazine: Absolute Poker Issues Interim Statement On Security Breach The Kahnawake Gaming Commission issued its report on the incident in January 2008. Among other consequences, Absolute Poker was fined $500,000.Kahnawake Gambling Commission: In the Matter of Absolute Poker PDF file The Quebec provincial police opened an investigation into the ongoing matter. UltimateBet Founded in 2001, UltimateBet was licensed by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission. UltimateBet offered Texas hold 'em, Omaha high and high low, seven card stud high and high low. Mixed game tables were also offered (HO, HOSE, HORSE). Like other online poker rooms, UltimateBet also offered a .net play-money-only cardroom. UltimateBet hosted an annual live tournament, the Aruba Poker Classic, which was a World Poker Tour event for the first four seasons of the show. In 2005, Freddy Deeb won the event, claiming the $1,000,000 prize. Prior winners were Eric Brenes in 2004, Erick Lindgren in 2003, and Juha Helppi in 2002. The tournament in 2008 was a $5,000 buy-in event with a guaranteed $1 million top prize. The company sponsored the poker television series Poker2Nite, hosted by professional poker player Joe Sebok and radio host Scott Huff. Spokespeople for UltimateBet have included professional poker players Phil Hellmuth and Annie Duke, as well as actress-turned-poker player Tiffany Michelle.Ultimatebet.com: UltimateBet's Star Players Team Turns to Hollywood for Newest Recruit Prior to the passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, the software parent company of the cardroom, Excapsa Software was traded on the London Stock Exchange as XCP.L.

In May 2008, the company released a statement about the scandal, claiming that cheating had taken place from March 2006 to December 2007. However, in a later statement they confirmed that the cheating had begun at the start of 2005: > We have also confirmed that the cheating dates back further than we > initially believed. We can now confirm that the cheating began in January > 2005, long before Tokwiro Enterprises ENRG acquired UltimateBet from the > previous ownership.Status Update on NioNio Investigation The company claimed the cheating was perpetrated by employees of the former owners, Excapsa Software.ULTIMATEBET ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING UNFAIR PLAY According to the company, the fraudulent activity was traced to unauthorized software code that transferred hole-card information of other players to the perpetrators during play. UltimateBet stated it had removed the cheating software as of February 2008 and began issuing refunds to affected players. On September 29, 2008, the Kahnawake Gaming Commission stated it had found clear and convincing evidence to support a conclusion that between the approximate dates of May 2004 to January 2008, Russ Hamilton was the main person responsible for, and benefiting from, multiple cheating incidents at Ultimate Bet.Kahnawake Gaming Commission: Kahnawake Gaming Commission Imposes Sanctions on Ultimate Bet with Regard to Cheating Incidents 2011 indictments On April 15, the Department of Justice seized the .com internet addresses of the three online gambling sites, PokerStars, Full Tilt, and Absolute Poker. The Cereus Poker Network continued operating until May 12, 2012 when players reported being unable to connect to game servers using the poker client software. At the time of its closure, it owed players an estimated $50 million, mostly to residents of the United States. =Absolute Poker Claims Process= On April 10, 2017, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York issued a press release explaining that former players at Absolute Poker would be eligible to file claims to regain the funds in their balances at the defunct poker site. Money held in Ultimate Bet accounts is also eligible for reimbursement. The Garden City Group was retained as claims administrator. This is the same company that handled claims relating to Full Tilt Poker, which was also targeted in the 2011 indictments against online poker firms. After the Full Tilt Poker remissions process was completed, having returned more than $118 million to affected players, some of the money that had been set aside for it yet remained unclaimed. It is this leftover amount that will be distributed in compensation to the former customers of the Cereus Poker Network. The petition for remission deadline is set at Sept. 7, 2017 with payments to be processed shortly thereafter.

Biography = Early life = Szaky's parents are medical doctors, and Szaky himself is an only child. At age four, Szaky left his home in Hungary after the Chernobyl disaster. In 1987, Szaky immigrated to Canada, where he grew up in Toronto. Szaky attended high school at Upper Canada College. Szaky notes that growing up in Canada and around the strong conservationist movement there is what sparked his interest in environmentalism. According to Szaky, he became fascinated with the concept of recycling after seeing the “astounding” things people threw in the trash, adding that the first television set he ever saw was being thrown in the garbage. This experience proved formative as he credits it with helping him understand that waste was a “modern idea.” He attended college at Princeton University, majoring in psychology and economics. He dropped out during his sophomore year to focus on TerraCycle. Career Early on in his career, Tom started three small 'dot.com' companies.Tom Szaky: Chief Executive Officer, TerraCycle. Accessed September 14, 2012 (via Wayback Machine) These were Werehome.com, piority.com, and studentmarks.com. Building on his early success, he attended Princeton University where he studied economics and merged his interest in environmentalism and social good with his entrepreneurial studies. Following an inspirational road trip to Montreal, Szaky discovered vermicompost and developed a business plan for the Entrepreneurship Club's annual Business Plan Competition that centered around the business model of converting garbage into worm poop fertilizer. Even though he placed fourth in the competition, the seed that would become TerraCycle was planted along with the company’s first product in mind. = TerraCycle = Armed with initial capital funding generated through family, friends and monetary awards earned via additional business plan contests, Szaky purchased a $20,000 continuous flow composting system that converted organic waste from the dining halls of Princeton University into fertilizer through the use of worms. It was at that time TerraCycle’s corporate breakthrough came, when Szaky realized that by utilizing discarded plastic bottles as the packaging for the fertilizer, which he engaged schools and local organizations to collect, he could reduce production costs and allow the fertilizer to be marketed as “an entire product made of garbage.” In 2004, the company secured their first high-profile clients with Home Depot Canada and Wal-Mart Canada agreeing to carry TerraCycle products, thereby solidifying the company as a viable business. In 2006, Tom was named the \\"#1 CEO under thirty\\" by Inc. magazine in its July 2006 issue for his work in TerraCycle.Burlingham, Bo. \\"The Coolest Little Start-Up in America\\", Inc. (magazine), July 2006. Accessed October 25, 2007. In 2007, TerraCycle pivoted away from organic fertilizer manufacturing and began moving toward developing recycling solutions and collection systems designed to recycle products and packaging that is traditionally not recyclable through standard municipal waste facilities. Once collected, the packaging is cleaned and melted into hard plastic that can be remolded to make new recycled products. Since the company’s conception, Szaky and TerraCycle designed the world’s first recycling processes for cigarette butts, soiled diapers and chewing gum. = Loop = At the 2019 World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Szaky announced Loop, a global circular shopping platform that utilizes durable containers that can be reused and/or recycled. In May of the same year, Szaky launched the first trial of Loop in Paris, France. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer and owner of one of the largest hypermarket chains in the world, was announced as Loop’s founding retail partner for the Paris trial with plans to make the Loop service available in its brick-and- mortar stores at a future date. The U.S. pilot program launched in late May in the Mid-Atlantic region of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Washington D.C, with Kroger Co., the country’s largest grocery retailer, and Walgreens, one of the nation’s largest pharmacy chains, as Loop’s founding retailers in the United States. Due to consumer demand, additional East Coast markets were added just a couple months later. Loop will launch in Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the western U.S. in 2020. Publications Szaky regularly acts as a guest contributor within the sustainable business sector with published pieces in TreeHugger, mindbodygreen, Entrepreneur Magazine and World Economic Forum. Tom created, produced and starred in TerraCycle’s reality show, “Human Resources” which aired 3 ten-episode seasons on Pivot from 2014-2016 and is syndicated in +20 foreign markets and is also available to stream on Amazon and iTunes. He has published four books since 2009 with the most recent release, The Future of Packaging: From Linear to Circular, debuting in February 2019. They include: *Revolution in a Bottle (2009, 2013) Szaky’s first book chronicles the young CEO’s entrepreneurial beginnings featuring the establishment of TerraCycle. *Outsmart Waste (2014) Szaky’s second book focuses on the environmental degradation associated with the prevailing societal response to waste management. *Make Garbage Great (2014) The CEO’s third published work functions as a how-to-guide for an environmentally conscious lifestyle. *The Future of Packaging: From Linear to Circular (2019) Szaky’s fourth book offers a road map out of the modern waste crisis through packaging design with perspective from 15 innovators in sustainability and was named the book “Most Likely to Save the Planet” by the Independent Publisher Book Awards.

Compositions and arrangements Amongst Agoult’s compositions for band are Bulgarian Bugle Boy (which was recorded by The Scottish C.W.S. Band on Pye GSGL 10430). Agoult also composed two additional compositions for band, Culloden and Caramba!. His Caramba! is likely the work heard on the LP What We Want is Watney's Silver Band issued on MFP 1303. Other compositions for light orchestra include Bessie Larkin, La Canniebiere, Honouring the Haggis, Madame Guillotine,Bulgarian Bugle BoyBack to Baroque and Betty Dear, the latter composition being dedicated to his wife. Agoult also made an arrangement of When Johnny Comes Marching Home which can be heard on a recording with the Band of the Grenadier Guards on Entertainment Sales ESI-106. Other arrangements for band by Agoult include the Coronation March from Le prophète by Giacomo Meyerbeer and the Grand March from Aida\\" by Giuseppe Verdi.

It has a small body size and glossy brown fur. It is similar in appearance to several other mouse-eared bats, including the Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, and Arizona myotis, to which it is closely related. Despite its name, the little brown bat is not closely related to the big brown bat, which belongs to a different genus. Its mating system is polygynandrous, or promiscuous, and females give birth to one offspring annually. The offspring, called pups, are quickly weaned and reach adult size in some dimensions by three weeks old. The little brown bat has a mean lifespan of 6.5 years, though one individual in the wild reached 34 years old. It is nocturnal, foraging for its insect prey at night and roosting in hollow trees or buildings during the day, among less common roost types. It navigates and locates prey with echolocation. It has few natural predators, but may be killed by raptors such as owls, as well as terrestrial predators such as raccoons. Other sources of mortality include diseases such as rabies and white-nose syndrome. White-nose syndrome has been a significant cause of mortality since 2006, killing over one million little brown bats by 2011. In the Northeastern United States, population loss has been extreme, with surveyed hibernacula (caves used for hibernation) averaging a population loss of 90%. Humans frequently encounter the little brown bat due to its habit of roosting in buildings. Colonies in buildings are often considered pests because of the production of waste or the concern of rabies transmission. Little brown bats rarely test positive for rabies, however. Some people attempt to attract little brown bats to their property, but not their houses, by installing bat houses. Taxonomy The little brown bat was described as a new species in 1831 by American naturalist John Eatton Le Conte. It was initially in the genus Vespertilio, with a binomial of Vespertilio lucifugus. \\"Lucifugus\\" is from Latin \\"lux\\" meaning \\"light\\" and \\"fugere\\" meaning \\"flee.\\" The holotype had possibly been collected in Georgia near the Le Conte Plantation near Riceboro, but this has been disputed because the initial record lacked detail on where the specimen was collected. Within its family, the Vespertilionidae (vesper bats), the little brown bat is a member of the subfamily Myotinae, which contains only the mouse-eared bats of genus Myotis. Based on a 2007 study using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, it is part of a Nearctic clade of mouse-eared bats. Its sister taxon is the Arizona myotis, M. occultus. As of 2005, five subspecies of the little brown bat are recognized: M. l. lucifugus, M. l. alascensis, M. l. carissima, M. l. pernox, and M. l. relictus. Formerly, the Arizona myotis and southeastern myotis (M. austroriparius) were also considered subspecies (M. l. occultus and M. l. austroriparius), but both are now recognized as full species. In a 2018 study by Morales and Carstens, they concluded that the five subspecies are independent, paraphyletic lineages, meaning that grouping them together excludes other lineages with the same common ancestor, and therefore each warrant specific status. Results of one study suggested that the little brown bat can hybridize with Yuma myotis, M. yumanensis. The two species occur in the same area in much of the Western United States, as well as southern British Columbia. The two species are morphologically different throughout most of the range, but in some regions, individuals have been documented that are intermediate in appearance between the two. However, a 1983 study by Herd and Fenton found no morphological, genetic, or ecological evidence to support the notion that the two species hybridize.  Anatomy and physiology  = External characteristics = Illustration of the little brown bat The little brown bat is a small species, with individuals weighing with a total body length of . Individuals have the lowest weight in the spring as they emerge from hibernation. It has a forearm length of and a wingspan of . It as a sexually dimorphic species, with females larger than males on average. A variety of fur colors is possible, with pelage ranging from pale tan or reddish to dark brown. Its belly fur is a lighter color than its back fur. Its fur is glossy in appearance, though less so on its belly. A variety of pigmentation disorders have been documented in this species, including albinism (total lack of pigment), leucism (partial lack of pigment), and melanism (over-pigmentation). =Head and teeth= Face of the little brown bat It is a diphyodont mammal, meaning that it has two sets of teeth during its lifetimemilk teeth and adult teeth. The dental formula of the milk teeth is for a total of 22 teeth, while that of the adult teeth is for a total of 38 teeth. Newborns (\\"pups\\") are born with 20 milk teeth which becomes 22 when the final upper premolars emerge. Pups begin losing milk teeth once they have reached a body length of ; total loss of milk teeth and emergence of adult teeth is usually complete by the time a juvenile is long. It has a relatively short snout and a gently sloped forehead. It lacks a sagittal crest, which can be used to distinguish it from the Arizona myotis. Its skull length is . The braincase appears nearly circular though somewhat flattened when viewed from the back. Its ears are long, while the tragi, or cartilaginous flaps that project in front of the ear openings, are long. The tragi are blunt at the tips and considered of medium length for a mouse-eared bat. =Senses= The little brown bat is dichromatic and its eyesight is likely sensitive to ultraviolet and red light, based on a genetic analysis that discovered that the genes SWS1 and M/LWS were present and functional. Its ability to see ultraviolet light may be useful in capturing insects, as 80% of nocturnal moths' wings reflect UV light. It is unclear if or how seeing red light is advantageous for this species. It is adapted to see best in low-light conditions. It lacks eyeshine. The little brown bat lacks a vomeronasal organ. Relative to frugivorous bat species such as the Jamaican fruit bat, it has small eyes and a reduced olfactory epithelium. Instead, it has a more sophisticated system of echolocation, suggesting that reliance on echolocation decreases the need for orientation via sight or smell. =Physiology= Little brown bat during winter hibernation In spring through fall, the little brown bat enters torpor, a state of decreased physiological activity, daily. Torpor saves energy for the bat when ambient temperatures are below throughout the year and in the winter; instead of expending energy to maintain a constant body temperature, it allows its body to cool and physiological activity to slow. While in torpor, its heart rate drops from up to 210 beats per minute to as few as 8 beats per minute. The exception to this rule is females at the end of pregnancy, which no longer have the ability to thermoregulate, and therefore must roost in warm places. During daily roosting, it can cope with high levels of water loss of up to 25%. In the winter time, it enters a prolonged state of torpor known as hibernation. To conserve energy, it limits how frequently it arouses from torpor, with individuals existing in uninterrupted torpor for up to 90 days. Arousal is the most energetically costly phase of torpor, which is why individuals do so infrequently. Despite the energy-saving mechanism of hibernation, individuals lose a quarter of their pre-hibernation body mass during the winter. =Similar species= The little brown bat can be confused with the Indiana bat (M. sodalis) in appearance. The two can be differentiated by the little brown bat's lack of a keeled calcarthe cartilaginous spur on its uropatagium (the flight membrane between its hind legs). While it does have a calcar, that of the little brown bat is not nearly as pronounced. Additionally, the little brown bat can be distinguished by the presence of hairs on its toes and feet that extend beyond the length of the digits. The northern long-eared bat (M. septentrionalis), another similar species, can be distinguished by its much longer ears, and tragi that are long and sharply pointed. Biology and ecology =Reproduction and life cycle= Recently born little brown myotis in maternity colony within Yellowstone National Park The little brown bat has a promiscuous mating structure, meaning that individual bats of both sexes mate with multiple partners. It is a seasonal breeder, with mating taking place in the fall before the annual hibernation. As a seasonal breeder, males do not produce sperm year-round; instead, spermatogenesis occurs May through August each year. Throughout the spring and summer, males and females roost separately. In the fall, however, individuals of both sexes will congregate in the same roost in a behavior known as \\"swarming.\\" Like several other bat species, males of this species exhibit homosexual behaviors, with male bats mating indiscriminately with torpid, roosting bats, regardless of sex. Although copulation occurs in the fall, fertilization does not occur until the spring due to sperm storage. Gestation proceeds for 50–60 days following fertilization. The litter size is one individual. At birth, pups weigh approximately and have a forearm length less than . While they have a small absolute mass, they are enormous relative to their mothers, weighing up to 30% of her postpartum body weight at birth. Pups' eyes and ears are closed at first, but open within a few hours of birth. They exhibit rapid growth; at around three weeks old, the young start flying, begin the weaning process, and are of a similar size to adults in forearm length but not weight. The young are totally weaned by 26 days old. Females may become sexually mature in the first year of life. Males become sexually mature in their second year. It is a very long-lived species relative to its body size. In the wild, individuals have been documented living up to 34 years. The average lifespan, however, is around 6.5 years. Males and females have high annual survival rates (probability of surviving another year), though survival rates vary by sex and region. One colony documented in Ontario had a male survival rate of 81.6% and a female survival rate of 70.8%; a colony in southern Indiana had survival rates of 77.1% and 85.7% for males and females, respectively. =Social behavior= Indiana bats in Ohio The little brown bat is a colonial species, with hibernating colonies consisting of up to 183,500 individuals, though the average colony size is little more than 9,000. Historically, individuals within these colonies were highly aggregated and densely clustered together, though the disease white-nose syndrome is making solitary hibernation more common. During the spring and summer, maternity colonies of almost all female individuals form. These colonies usually consist of several hundred bats. Outside of these maternity colonies, adult males and non-reproductive females will roost by themselves or in small aggregations. Maternity colonies begin to break apart in late summer. =Diet and foraging= The little brown bat is nocturnal, resting during the day and foraging at night. Individuals typically emerge from their roosts at dusk, foraging for 1.5–3 hours before stopping to roost. A second foraging bout usually occurs later in the night, ending at dawn. Little brown bat take off and flight Based on documenting one individual flying in a wind tunnel, it flies at approximately ; this increased to when flying over the surface of water. Home range size is variable; in one study of 22 females in Canada, pregnant females had an average home range of and lactating females had an average of . It produces calls that are high intensity frequency modulated (FM) and that last from less than one millisecond (ms) to about 5 ms and have a sweep rate of 80–40 kHz, with most of their energy at 45 kHz. Individuals emit approximately 20 calls per second when in flight. It consumes a variety of arthropod species, including insects and spiders. Prey species include beetles, flies, mayflies, true bugs, ants, moths, lacewings, stoneflies, and caddisflies. It also consumes mosquitoes, with one study documenting that, across twelve colonies in Wisconsin, 71.9% of all little brown bat guano (feces) samples contained mosquito DNA. During late pregnancy, when energetic demands are high, females consume around of insects nightly, or of insects per hour of foraging. With an average body mass of , that means that pregnant females consume 61% of their body weight nightly. Energetic demands during lactation are even higher, though, with females consuming of insects nightly, or of insects per hour of foraging. Because lactating females have an average mass of , this means that they consume nearly 85% of their body weight nightly. As the pup grows, lactation requires more and more energy; at the predicted lactation peak of 18 days old, a female would have to consume of insects per night, or 125% of her own weight. An often-mentioned statement is that \\"bats can eat 1000 mosquitoes per hour.\\" While the little brown bat does consume mosquitoes and has high energetic needs, the study that is the basis for this claim was an experiment in which individuals were put into rooms full of either mosquitoes or fruit flies. For a duration up to 31 minutes, they captured an average of 1.5–5.7 mosquitoes per minute. The individual most efficient at catching fruit flies caught an average of 14.8 per minute for 15 minutes. Extrapolating these numbers results in conclusions that it can eat approximately 340 mosquitoes per hour, or 890 fruit flies. However, there is no assurance that individuals forage with such high efficiencies for long periods of time, or that prey is dense enough in natural settings to allow capture rates observed in enclosed areas. =Predation and disease= An example of a Spinturnix bat mite, which specialize on bat wings The little brown bat likely has few predators. Known predators include owls such as the eastern screech owl, northern saw-whet owl, and the great horned owl. Raccoons are also opportunistic predators of the little brown bat, picking individuals off the cave walls of their hibernacula (caves used for hibernation) or eating individuals that have fallen to the cave floor. The presence of helminth parasites in the gastrointestinal tract of the little brown bat is most common in the spring and fall and least common in the summer. Digenetic trematodes are the most common of these parasites, with the more common of these species including Ototrema schildti and Plagiorchis vespertilionis. The little brown bat is also affected by ectoparasites (external parasites), including bat fleas such as Myodopsylla insignis, chiggers like Leptotrombidium myotis, and the bat mites Spinturnix americanus. When parasitizing a female bat, bat mites synchronize their reproductive cycle with that of their host, with their own reproduction tied to the host's pregnancy hormones. Lactating females have a higher intensity of parasitization by mites, which may promote vertical transmissionthe transfer of mites to the bat's offspring. The little brown bat is affected by the rabies virusspecifically, the strain associated with this species is known as MlV1. However, it is susceptible to other strains of the virus, including those of the big brown bat and the silver-haired bat, which is most lethal to humans. The rabies virus can be present in an individual's saliva, meaning that it can be spread through bites, 12–18 days before the individual begins showing symptoms. Individuals do not always develop rabies after exposure, though. In one study, no little brown bats developed rabies after subcutaneous exposure to the MlV1 strain. Some individuals in the wild have antibodies for the rabies virus. Scanning electron microscope image (false-color) of P. destructans on the muzzle of a little brown bat The little brown bat is also susceptible to the disease white-nose syndrome, which is caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. The disease affects individuals when they are hibernating, which is when their body temperatures are within the ideal growth range of P. destructans, . Pseudogymnoascus destructans is the first known pathogen that kills a mammal host during its torpor. Mortality from white-nose syndrome begins to manifest 120 days after hibernation begins, and mortality peaks 180 days after bats enter hibernacula. The growth of P. destructans on bats erodes the skin of their wing and tail membranes, muzzles, and ears. White-nose syndrome causes affected bats to burn through their energy reserves twice as fast as uninfected individuals. In addition to visible fungus growth on the nose, ears, and wings, white-nose syndrome results in higher carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing acidosis, and hyperkalemia (elevated blood potassium). Arousal from torpor becomes more frequent, and water loss increases due increased respiration rate in an attempt to remove excess carbon dioxide from the blood. The premature loss of fat reserves during hibernation results in starvation. Survivors of white-nose syndrome have longer bouts of torpor and lower bodies temperatures during torpor than individuals that die. Some individuals are more likely to survive based on their genetics, which predisposes them to remain in torpor longer and have larger fat reserves. Little brown bats are most affected by white-nose syndrome when they exhibit social, grouping behavior when hibernating, as P. destructans is transmitted by direct contact. In hibernacula where bats exhibit more solitary behavior, colonies are more prone to avoid infections of white-nose syndrome. In some colonies where grouping behavior was common before exposure to white-nose syndrome, bats now hibernate in a more solitary fashion. Before white-nose syndrome, only 1.16% of little brown bats hibernated singly; after white-nose syndrome, the percentage grew to 44.5%. Range and habitat A barn in Massachusetts that is the site of a little brown bat maternity colony The little brown bat lives throughout much of North America. In the north, its range extends as far west as Alaska and across much of Canada to Labrador. In the south, its range extends to Southern California and across the northern parts of Arizona and New Mexico. Historically, the largest known aggregations of this species occurred in the karstic regions of the Eastern United States. =Roosting habitat= The little brown bat roosts in sheltered places during the day. These roosts can include human structures or natural structures such as tree hollows, wood piles, rocky outcrops, or, occasionally, caves. Species of trees used for roosting include quaking aspen, balsam poplar, oak, and maple. It prefers roosts that are warm and dark. For maternity colonies, females prefer roosts that are . =Hibernation habitat= The little brown bat hibernates in caves or old mines. Females migrate up to hundreds of kilometers from their summer ranges to reach these hibernacula. It prefers hibernacula in which the relative humidity is greater than 90% and ambient temperatures are above the freezing point. Preferred hibernacula also maintain a constant temperature throughout the winter. =Foraging habitat= The little brown bat forages along the edges of vegetated habitat. It also forages along the edges bodies of water or streams. In one study in the Canadian province of Alberta, its foraging activity was significantly higher in old- growth forest than would be expected based on its relative availability. Conservation Little brown bat with white-nose syndrome As of 2018, the little brown bat is evaluated as an endangered species by the IUCN, a dramatic change from 2008 when it was designated as the lowest conservation priority, least concern. Until recently, the species was regarded as one of the most common bats in North America. However, a serious threat to the species has emerged in the form of a fungus-caused disease known as white-nose syndrome. It was one of the first bat species documented with the disease, which now affects at least seven hibernating bat species in the United States and Canada. From 2006 to 2011, over one million little brown bats died from the disease in the Northeastern United States, with winter hibernacula populations declining up to 99%. As of 2017, hibernacula counts for little brown bats in the Northeast had declined by an average of 90%. White-nose syndrome first appeared in New York in 2006; it has steadily diffused from eastern New York, though, until recently, remaining east of the Rocky Mountains. In March 2016, white-nose syndrome was detected on a little brown bat in King County, Washington, representing a jump from the previous westernmost extent of the disease in any bat species. P. destructans growing on the wing of a little brown bat In 2010, Frick et al. predicted a 99% chance of local extinction of little brown bats by the year 2026. They also predicted that the pre-white- nose syndrome population of 6.5 million individuals could be reduced to as few as 65,000 (1%) via the disease outbreak. Despite heavy declines, the species has avoided extinction in the Northeast through the persistence of small, localized populations. While the mortality rate of the disease is very high, some individuals that are exposed do survive. In 2010, Kunz and Reichard published a report arguing that the precipitous decline of the little brown bat justified its emergency listing as a federally endangered species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. However, it is not federally listed as threatened or endangered as of 2018, though several U.S. states list it as endangered (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia), threatened (Tennessee, Wisconsin), or of Special Concern (Michigan, Ohio). The little brown bat was listed as an endangered species by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada in February 2012 after an emergency assessment. The emergency designation as endangered was confirmed in November 2013. Relationship to people Bat guano in an attic Little brown bats commonly occupy human structures. Females will situate maternity colonies within buildings. This small body size of this species can make it challenging to prevent individuals from entering a structure, as they can take advantage of gaps or holes as small as × . Once inside a building, a colony of little brown bats can disturb human inhabitants with their vocalizations and production of guano and urine. Large accumulations of guano can provide a growth medium for fungi, including the species that causes histoplasmosis. Concerns about humans becoming affected by bat ectoparasites such as ticks, fleas, or bat bugs are generally unfounded, as parasites that feed on bats are often specific to bats and die without them. A bat house in New Hampshire Because they are often found in proximity to humans, the little brown bat and the not-closely related big brown bat are the two bat species most frequently submitted for rabies testing in the United States. Little brown bats infrequently test positive for the rabies virus; of the 586 individuals submitted for testing across the United States in 2015, the most recent data available as of 2018, 16 (2.7%) tested positive for the virus. Little brown bats are a species that will use bat houses for their roosts. Landowners will purchase or construct bat houses and install them, hoping to attract bats for various reasons. Some install bat houses in an attempt to negate the effects of removing a colony from a human structure (\\"rehoming\\" them into a more acceptable space). While this can be effective for other species, there is not evidence to suggest that this is effective for little brown bats, though it has been shown that little brown bats will choose to occupy artificial bat boxes installed at the sites of destroyed buildings that once housed colonies. Others are attempting to help bats out of concern for them due to the effects of white-nose syndrome. Bat houses are also installed in an attempt to control the bats' insect prey such as mosquitoes or taxa that harm crops. Little brown bats are vulnerable near moving vehicles on roads, either foraging or crossing. Bats can easily be pulled into the slipstreams of faster moving vehicles. When little brown bats cross roads, they approach the road using canopy tree cover and avoid crossing where there is no cover. When the cover is lower, bats cross roads lower.

Martyn started in business in 1649, in partnership with John Ridley; their shop was at the sign of the Castle in Fleet Street, near Ram Alley. In 1651, Martyn began an independent establishment at the sign of the Bell in St. Paul's Churchyard, \\"without Temple bar.\\" He continued there for the remainder of his career. He often worked in partnership with other London stationers; he was joined at the Bell by James Allestry, who was his partner there from 1652 until 1664, when Allestry opened his own shop at the sign of the Rose and Crown. They were joined by Thomas Dicas, from 1660 to Dicas's death in 1669. In 1663 Allestry and Martyn became the monopoly publishers for the Royal Society; Martyn continued in this role after Allestry's death in November 1670.Plomer, pp. 2–3, 63, 123. Allestry and Martyn, and then Martyn alone, served as the Royal Society's publishers through the crucial first two decades of the organization's existence. They issued all of its printed documents, including the Philosophical Transactions; they published Thomas Sprat's History of the Royal Society (1667), and Robert Hooke's Micrographia (1665). On his own, Martyn was an accomplished publisher of law books and of texts in Latin and Greek; his edition of Thomas Blount's legal dictionary Νομο-λεχικον (\\"Novo- lexicon,\\" 1671) is a noteworthy example.Johns, pp. 216, 314–315. Martyn was responsible for a wide range of books, including the religious works that were so characteristic of his century, like Edward Wetenhall's Enter Into Thy Closet, or A Method and Order for Private Devotion (1666). He issued Francis North's A Philosophical Essay of Music and John Milton's The History of Britain, both in 1677; and he published medical works, like the London Pharmacopoeia of the Royal College of Physicians (also 1677).Furdell, p. 69. He also published two important works of English literature. He and Allestry issued Samuel Butler's Hudibras, Part 2, in 1664; with Henry Herringman, Martyn published Parts 1 and 2 of Hudibras together in 1674; and he and Herringman issued the complete 3-part work in 1678. Martyn also partnered with Herringman and Richard Marriot for the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679. In 1681, Martyn's widow donated a silver bowl to the Stationers Company in her husband's memory. Notes References * Furdell, Elizabeth Lane. Publishing and Medicine in Early Modern England.

The film is based on Ellis's 1994 collection of short stories of the same name. The film, which is set amidst the decadence of the early 1980s, depicts an assortment of socially alienated, mainly well-off characters who numb their sense of emptiness with casual sex, alcohol, and drugs. Filming took place in Los Angeles, Uruguay, and Buenos Aires in 2007. It was the last feature film for actor Brad Renfro before his death on January 15, 2008, at the age of 25. The film was dedicated to his memory. An article published by Reuters described the story as \\"seven stories taking course during a week in the life of movie executives, rock stars, a vampire and other morally challenged characters\\", set in 1980s Los Angeles. The supernatural content was not to be included in the final film, however. Plot In 1983, at an elegant Los Angeles party at a mansion, Bruce (Fernando Consagra) wanders away from the party and is killed by a speeding car. After the funeral, his friends Graham, Martin and Tim sit drinking with Raymond on a fancy hotel patio. Only Raymond is truly devastated and cries bitterly. The friends dismiss Raymond's tears. When Raymond leaves, Graham follows him. Graham Sloan is the son of a rich, estranged couple and drives a Porsche, stays in glamorous hotel rooms, and is a drug dealer.

Graham is aware that his girlfriend Christie is cheating on him with a number of men, including his best friend Martin, a bisexual rock video producer. Since Graham and Martin are also sleeping together, Graham appears to be trying to accept the open relationship. A new wave rock singer named Bryan Metro flies into L.A. He stumbles through his fancy hotel room and has sex with young groupies. Getting out of the bath, he slips on the wet floor and slashes open his hand. He answers the phone, and he is berated by his manager for sleeping with underage groupies, and he mumbles that he needs a doctor. Later, he is taken to meet a movie producer who hopes to make a profitable B-movie starring the singer. The singer appears to be barely coherent, and his attention is only caught when he sees a young girl wearing braces watching TV in an adjoining room. Bryan staggers towards her and takes her into a bedroom. Later, he stumbles into a hotel room and finds a groupie in his bed. Slurring his words, he asks her to come closer, and he kisses her, and then punches her in the face. Jack, a hotel doorman in Christie's place, has come to seek his fortune in L.A. as an actor. He is making a humble living working as a doorman and lives in a small, run-down house. He is alarmed when he gets a phone call from his grizzled uncle Peter, a drifter ex-con who claims he needs a place to stay. Jack angrily refuses the request, because he wants to leave the immoral, criminal side of his family background behind him. However, when Jack returns home, his uncle is waiting for him in a beaten-up van. To Jack's horror, his uncle is involved in a gangland kidnapping-for-hire plot, and the uncle has brought a kidnapped child to Jack's house. When a cleanly dressed, yet menacing gangster calls on Jack when the uncle is out, and asks to collect the \\"package\\", Jack feigns ignorance. When the uncle returns he tells Jack that the boy has to be killed, on the grounds that it will be more humane than what the gangsters will do to him, Jack offers to kill the boy. Instead of slitting the boy's throat, Jack pretends to kill the boy but actually releases him. Jack hides his failure to kill the boy by cutting open his hand and smearing blood on his hands and face, and he joins his uncle in the van and flees the scene. Tim Price is pressured to go with his father, Les, on a trip to Hawaii, ostensibly for the two to share father-son bonding time. They go to a bar, where Les starts a chat with two young women, who may be willing to have sex with them. However, Tim is not interested, and he is disgusted by his father's drunken, leering passes at the women. Tim does later find a girl he likes at the beach, but when the three of them have dinner together, Les begins to make passes at her and then both the father and the young woman make fun of Tim by suggesting that gay men were making passes at him on the beach. Tim leaves the dinner and goes out to be alone. When his father finds him, Tim refuses to talk, saying he has nothing to say. Graham confronts Martin about Christie and asks Martin if he has been sleeping with her, apart from group sex. Martin denies betraying Graham and is shocked to realize that his friend has developed feelings for her; in their social scene, most interactions are fleeting couplings based on desire, not relationships based on caring. Graham then tells Martin that he feels adrift in his life, as if he does not have anyone who can tell him what is right or wrong. His whole life has become a series of casual encounters and light banter, which is covered over by a pharmaceutical haze. Graham seems to be making the first steps to moving away from his alienated, narcissistic lifestyle. When one of Martin's lovers calls Graham to tell him that Christie has become ill and is lying out on the sand, he drives over to the house to see her. Even though he sees that she has developed lesions, presumably AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma, all over her dying body, he seems unable to take care of her and take her to a hospital. Instead, he kisses her once, and leaves her lying on a towel on the beach dying, alone on an empty stretch of sand.

Production Filming began on October 12, 2007, in Los Angeles, and later moved to Uruguay and Buenos Aires before wrapping on December 6, 2007. According to Fox News, Ellis and Jarecki had spent three years working on a script and prepping the film for release, and Jarecki was set to direct. The film was supposed to be \\"an absurdist, lighthearted, and expansive satire.\\" When producers replaced Jarecki with Australian director Gregor Jordan, the tone of the film strayed away from Ellis and Jarecki's original premise to become something that the cast and writers were embarrassed by. Amid concerns about the budget and about sex and violence (much like that of Ellis' earlier adaptation, American Psycho), the vampire subplot was excised from the movie entirely along with actor Brandon Routh, who played a vampire. Jordan's final version, which has received negative reviews from some critics, became \\"some terrible, dark meditation\\" under his interpretation of the script, according to an insider involved with the production. Jordan also reportedly cut the script down from Ellis' original 150 pages to only 94. Reception =Box office= The film premiered at Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2009. It received a limited release on April 24, 2009 in 482 movie theatres in the US, where it made approximately US$300,000 on its opening weekend. The film was only in release for 3 days and the final gross for the film was $382,174, well below its $18 million budget. The film was then released on DVD & Blu-ray on August 25, 2009. It was granted a 15 certificate by the BBFC and was released under four different versions. =Critical response= The Informers was panned by film critics and has a \\"rotten\\" score of 12% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 106 reviews with an average rating of 3.5 out of 10. The critical consensus states \\"As miserable and insipid as its protagonists, The Informers fails to provide anything to think about after the sheen of fake blond is gone.\\" The film also has a score of 20 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 25 critics indicating \\"Generally unfavorable reviews.\\" Sonny Bunch from the Washington Times stated that to understand the film, a viewer should \\"Imagine American Psycho with less violence but more nudity, transplanted from New York City to California and stripped of all self-awareness\\". John Anderson from the Washington Post called it a \\"... nihilistic, narcissistic, knuckleheaded movie about nihilistic, narcissistic knuckleheads\\"; he states that it \\"...might have been an interesting exercise in satire, if it only had a sense of humor. Which it doesn't\\". Paul Chambers from CNNRadio referred to the movie as \\"bleak, boring and bloated\\". Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly stated that the film is \\"...by far the most slack, ho-hum movie ever made from Ellis' material\\". Cosmo Landesman from the Sunday Times (UK) acknowledged that \\"It has a good cast and a terrific 1980s soundtrack (Devo, Simple Minds)\\". At the same time, Landesman stated that the film \\"...also has the superficiality of a TV soap\\", which means that while the film \\"...is not so bad that you can’t sit back and enjoy it, but nor is it good enough to go and see. Several critics attacked the film for its prurient elements. James Berardinelli from ReelViews called it \\"... the kind of movie that, upon leaving the theater, provokes the urge to take a shower\\". In a similar vein, Lou Lumenick from the New York Post quipped that the film is \\"... so seamy it makes you want to take a bath afterward\\", and he stated that \\"[r]arely has so much sin seemed so boring\\". Several critics pinned the blame for the problems on the director. Critic Nigel Andrews from the Financial Times acknowledges that \\"Bret Easton Ellis pens a mean tale, in all adjectival senses. His prose is artfully maleficent; he is a laid-back Severus Snape of the sex-and-drugs generation.\\" However, he argues that \\"[y]ou need a smarter directing hand, though, than Gregor Jordan’s\\" to make the film work. Reviewer Anthony Quinn from The Independent argues that Jordan \\"...seems to have gone into reverse since his 2001 Buffalo Soldiers, aiming for the LA rondeau of Altman's Short Cuts but missing all the vital ingredients – wit, humanity, charm, nuance and meaning.\\" Some of the rare positive reviewers interpreted the aimless, emptiness of the film as an intentional way of bringing out the themes of Ellis' short stories. Rob Nelson from Variety stated that \\"[r]ating less than zero on the sophistication scale, The Informers is thus a totally faithful adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel  and an accurate look at early '80s-era Los Angeles\\". Another positive review came from Derek Malcolm from This is London, who stated that \\"Jordan gives all this an entirely appropriate sheen and the cast play well through glazed eyes.\\" Malcolm claims that the \\"...film will fascinate those who love to see the tormented lives of those who seem luckier than the rest of us\\". Erica Abeel from Film Journal International stated that \\"Gregor Jordan and Bret Easton Ellis take no prisoners in this uncompromising, expertly crafted shocker about hedonism in early-'80s L.A.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars, concluding that the film is \\"repulsively fascinating and has been directed by Gregor Jordan as a soap opera from hell, with good sets and costumes.\\" Bret Easton Ellis has said, \\"That movie doesn't work for a lot of reasons but I don't think any of those reasons are my fault.\\" References External links   * Bret Easton Ellis talks film adaptations at SCAD Category:2008 films Category:2008 crime drama films Category:2008 LGBT-related films Category:Adultery in films Category:American crime drama films Category:American films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:Male bisexuality in film Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Christopher Young Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films directed by Gregor Jordan Category:Films set in 1983 Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Argentina Category:Films shot in Uruguay Category:Films shot in Buenos Aires Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films based on works by Bret Easton Ellis Category:2008 drama films ","title":"The Informers (2008 film)"},{"id":"13902864","text":"In enzymology, a 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin 2'-reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :6-lactoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin + NADP+ \\\\rightleftharpoons 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin + NADPH + H+ Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-lactoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin, NADPH, and H+.

The Ewe are located in Togo and Ghana. In the wild, the adze takes the form of a firefly, though it will transform into human shape upon capture. When in human form, the adze has the power to possess humans. People, male or female, possessed by an adze are viewed as witches (\\"abasom\\" in the Ewe language). The adze's influence would negatively affect the people who lived around their host. A person is suspected of being possessed in a variety of situations, including: women with brothers (especially if their brother's children fared better than their own), old people (if the young suddenly started dying and the old stayed alive) and the poor (if they envied the rich). The adze's effects are generally felt by the possessed victim's family or those of whom the victim is jealous. In firefly form, the adze would pass through closed doors at night and suck blood from people as they slept. The victim would fall sick and die. Tales of the creature and its effects were probably an attempt to describe the potentially deadly effects of mosquitoes and malaria. There is no defense against an adze.

Purchased in Ohio in 1864  Carrabasset, a side-wheel steamer, was purchased at Cincinnati, Ohio, 23 January 1864; commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, 12 May 1864, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant E.

Civil War operations  = Assigned to the West Gulf Blockade = With the Squadron, Carrabasset operated as transport, picket boat, and tugboat at the mouth of the Mississippi River, in Berwick Bay and the Atchafalaya River, and in the neighboring lakes and bayous. = Sending ashore raiding parties = On several occasions she landed Union Army forces or her own landing party to engage Confederate forces ashore, capturing men, horses, and bales of cotton. One such incident occurred 21 March 1865, when she landed 40 infantrymen, then was attacked herself by a party of Confederates. Putting a party of her own men ashore, Carrabasset succeeded in capturing the equipment of a Confederate picket and several pirogues. = Recovering equipment for three lighthouses = On 17 June 1865, one of her landing party expeditions penetrated to St. Martinville, Louisiana, where the equipment of three lighthouses, stored there since the taking of the lighthouses by the Confederates early in the war, was recaptured.

November 17, 2011.) was an American songwriter who wrote many well-known popular songs and several scores for films and Broadway shows, mainly during the 1960s and 70s. Early life and career Born in Brooklyn and graduating from Erasmus Hall High School, Pockriss's education at Brooklyn College was interrupted by World War II, where he served as a cryptographer for the US Army Air Force. Upon his return he studied English and music at Brooklyn College, and later attended graduate school in musicology at New York University. With Paul Vance he co-wrote Perry Como's Grammy-nominated \\"Catch a Falling Star\\", recorded in 1957; Brian Hyland's \\"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini\\", recorded in 1960; and The Cuff Links' \\"Tracy\\", recorded in 1969. In 1959, Pockriss and Vance released a single for Columbia records as \\"Lee and Paul,\\" a novelty tune called \\"The Chick.\\" With Hal Hackady he co-wrote Billy Thornhill's \\"The Key,\\" recorded in 1968 on Wand Records. Again with Hal Hackady, he co-wrote the ballad \\"Kites\\"', first recorded by the Rooftop Singers though a subsequent recording by Simon Dupree and the Big Sound charted at number 8 in Britain. He also wrote Anita Bryant's \\"My Little Corner of the World\\", recorded in 1960; Shelley Fabares' \\"Johnny Angel\\", recorded in 1962; and Clint Holmes' \\"Playground in My Mind\\", recorded in 1972. Broadway and film With lyricist Anne Croswell he wrote the songs for the Broadway musical Tovarich starring Vivien Leigh, which received a Grammy nomination for Original Cast Album.

A name that scans well in songs,\\" adding: \\"A lot of people are like, 'Okay, who's Jenny?'

In his career, Oden rushed for eight touchdowns, caught four more in the air, passed for two, and scored five on kickoff and punt returns, a league record at the time. From 1926 to 1928, Oden played summer baseball for Falmouth in the Cape Cod Baseball League. An all-league shortstop who also managed the team in 1927 and 1928, Oden was known for his \\"timely hitting and accurate throwing,\\" and was \\"the king of the base stealers in the league,\\" having \\"thrilled the crowds on several occasions by stealing home.\\" References Category:1899 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Stockholm Category:Swedish emigrants to the United States Category:Swedish players of American football Category:American football running backs Category:Brown Bears football players Category:Boston Braves (NFL) players Category:Providence Steam Roller players Category:Cape Cod Baseball League players (pre-modern era) Category:Cape Cod Baseball League coaches Category:Falmouth Commodores players ","title":"Curly Oden"},{"id":"13903163","text":"The Workplace Health & Safety, formerly AAOHN Journal is a monthly peer- reviewed nursing journal and the official of the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses.

After several failed attempts to attain conscientious objector status, he deserted his unit in Germany in September 2006 to avoid redeployment to Iraq. He was convicted of desertion by a court martial March 6, 2007 and served six months in prison. His trial led Amnesty International to declare him a prisoner of conscience, and made him a hero to the American and European anti-war movements.  Background  Agustín Aguayo is a U.S. citizen who was born in Guadalajara, Mexico. He enlisted in the United States Army in 2002 to earn money for his education. The following year, Operation Iraqi Freedom began. Aguayo was trained by the Army as a combat infantryman. After his advanced individual training he was stationed in Germany, and was soon deployed to the Middle East. Though Aguayo was not anti-war at the time of his enlistment, he stated that he became anti-war as a result of his experiences in the Army. In February 2004, he applied for conscientious objector status, but was denied, reportedly by a vote of two to one by the three-person panel. He was deployed to Tikrit, where he served a year as a combat medic. In 2005, he sued in federal court to force the Army to recognize him as a conscientious objector, but his suit was denied.  Imprisonment  Agustín Aguayo was notified his unit would be returned to Iraq and instead missed his unit's movement to that theater of operations. When military police came to his home in Schweinfurt, Germany on September 2, 2006, he climbed out of the bathroom window, going AWOL for 24 days. On September 27, he turned himself in at Fort Irwin in California, stating that \\"It is the right thing to do... I'm not a deserter or a coward.\\" On March 6, 2007, Aguayo was convicted of desertion by a court- martial in Würzburg, Germany. He was given a sentence of only eight months' imprisonment, rather than the possible maximum of seven years. Aguayo told the court that \\"I tried my best, but I couldn’t bear weapons and I could never point weapons at someone.\\" An army prosecutor dismissed Aguyao's reasoning, stating, \\"His service was going to be important as a medic regardless of whether he was carrying a weapon or not.\\" He was given a bad conduct discharge and his rank reduced to the lowest grade. Following his conviction, Amnesty International named Aguayo a prisoner of conscience, arguing that he had taken \\"reasonable steps to secure release from the army\\" and that he was \\"imprisoned solely for his conscientious objection to participating in war\\".  Release and activism  As Aguayo had already served 161 days in prison, he was released on April 18. He then returned to his family in Los Angeles. On his return, he spoke of his experiences before an audience of antiwar activists, who gave him what the Los Angeles Times described as \\"a hero's welcome\\". Der Spiegel also described him as a \\"hero\\" to the US and European anti-war movements as a result of his trial. Aguayo began a speaking campaign at U.S. schools, describing his activities by saying, \\"I want to bring young people awareness. We ask them to sacrifice so much yet we don't educate them about the realities of war.\\" He was awarded the Stuttgart peace prize in December 2007.  Family  Aguayo has a wife, Helga Aguayo, and two daughters.

Biography A native of South Boston, Massachusetts, Plansky attended Georgetown University, where he was a star fullback and decathlete. He was the AAU national decathlon champion in 1924, and won the decathlon event at the prestigious Penn Relays in 1925 and 1926. On the gridiron, he was a member of the 1925 College Football All-America Team and the 1925 All-Eastern football team. Plansky narrowly missed competing in the decathlon at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. In April of 1928, he again won the decathlon event at the Penn Relays, which was widely thought to be the Olympic qualifying event, but was later determined not to be. Plansky played professional football for the NFL's Giants in 1928 and 1929. In his second season, he scored nine touchdowns, two field goals, and two extra points, and was named to the 1929 All-Pro Team. He also played in one game for the 1932 Boston Braves, his final NFL appearance. In 1928 and 1929, he played summer baseball for the Hyannis town team in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), and was part of a \\"parade of sluggers\\" that powered the Hyannis lineup. He went on to play professional baseball with the Erie Sailors of the Central League, batting .337 in 126 games in 1930. In 1931 and 1932, he played for the Scranton Miners of the New York–Penn League. He returned to the CCBL and was a league all-star for Bourne from 1933 to 1939, serving as player-manager in 1935, and leading Bourne to its first league championship in 1936. Plansky became an assistant coach at Williams College in 1931, and in 1936 became head track and cross country coach, a position he held until 1978. One of Plansky's athletes at Williams was future New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, a hurdler who graduated in 1952. Plansky died in 1979 in North Adams, Massachusetts at the age of 78. In 1987, thanks in large part to the efforts of Steinbrenner, a new track was installed at Williams, and named in memory of Plansky. In 1999, Plansky was ranked by Sports Illustrated as the #25 all-time greatest sports figure from Massachusetts, and in 2001 he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.

It was produced by Joe Pernice and Michael Deming, recorded with the band Olabelle and also features tracks with Tucker Martine and Laura Veirs, local Georgia legend Don Chambers and Goat, bluegrass duo Jeff & Vida and percussionist Mauro Refosco. In a 2007 interview Jim White interview, Americana UK website White said the album title was a term he had invented to describe \\"a strange new feeling I've been experiencing after years of feeling lost and alone and cursed.\\" He explained: \\"Now, when everything around me begins to shine, when I find myself dancing around in my back yard for no particular reason other than it feels good to be alive, when I get this deep sense of gratitude that I don't need drugs or God or doomed romance to fuel myself through the gauntlet of a normal day, I call that feeling 'Transnormal Skiperoo'.\\" White said the album marked a change of mood, both personally and musically: \\"I could keep writing songs about being sad and miserable, that’s my stock in trade, but it’s not a true reflection of how I am now. I vividly recall being sad and lost, but now I feel a true sense of purpose. I have a one year old daughter, a wife I love and a place in the world as a musician. \\"This record is, in part, a sigh of relief I'm not stuck in the quagmire anymore, There’s still some old songs, like 'Jailbird', that I've only just got around to releasing, but there's lots of different kinds of songs too. I have a feeling people like me better sad, but I hope they are in my corner now I can feel and try to express happiness and a sense of fulfillment. \\"It’s still new for me, I've built up a vocabulary over 45 years of sadness and maybe five years of joy, I'm still finding my way. On my last album I tried to write a song of love about my daughter but it wound up being about junkies and sleaze.

The character is a little elf with spiky black hair, who wears a red dress with black dots and prefers walking barefoot. Between 1968 and 1971 the comic was adapted for a series of animated shorts, when Hanne Hastrup wrote the scripts and Jannik Hastrup animated and produced 18 short films for the Danish public TV station Danmarks Radio. The last of the short films, Flugten Fra Amerika (Escape from America) has an anti-American message that prevented it from being broadcast. No new Cirkeline films were released until 1998. The first Cirkeline book was published in 1969, and in 1998 she took the leap to the big cinema screen in the first of 3 feature films. Cirkeline became a brand, which has grown stronger and stronger ever since and today there are 9 books, music CDs and a range of products from underwear to cups and plates. Several of the film's songs, written by Hans-Henrik Ley, have become classics - e.g. \\"Bim, Bam, Busse\\" (\\"Mile, Male, Mole\\"), \\"Snemusen Knud\\" (\\"Knut the Snowmouse\\") and \\"Cirkeline har fødselsdag\\" (\\"Circleen's birthday\\").

The following is a list of characters from the anime series SoltyRei. Main characters ; :* : A Genuine Resemble (gynoid) with green hair and green eyes. She does not remember anything from before her first meeting with Roy. After indirectly saving Roy's life (and then directly once again), she takes up residence with and is later adopted by him, causing her to take the surname Revant. Possessing a cheerful, helpful personality, she generally spends time cooking or performing housework for Roy, and later, Rose. She is naïve and takes every opportunity that presents itself. Her construction allows for a number of superhuman abilities, including high resistance to injury, greatly enhanced strength and speed, and the ability to resonate her fists to disintegrate objects. Her first name comes from one of Roy's old records, \\"Solty Rock\\". : It is later revealed that her real name is , one of the three core computers who oversee the planet, originally brought by the first human settlers. Originally, Joeseph described her as coldhearted whom instilled fear into people, but mentioned that Roy was responsible for making her smile. In the final three episodes, she also gained the ability to levitate. In Episode:24, Solty was sent into space to stop Eirene, another one of the three core computers, from intentionally colliding into the newly terra-formed planet (new Earth), which would destroy the city and its people. Solty was to destroy Eirene and the colonization ship before it could crash into the city. She fights her other \\"sister\\" in space and finally manages to get to her core. After Roy acknowledges Solty as his \\"daughter\\", she gains the strength to fight, screaming \\"I AM SOLTY REVANT!!!\\" at Eirene, who refers to her as Dike claiming she cannot be a human; thus throwing her identity away as a machine. In the end, she successfully destroys Eirene and the colonization ship by destroying her core and in the process, disrupting the Aurora Shell. : Several years later, Roy and Yuto are shown in space searching through the debris. They detect a strange melodic, humming sound, which soon can be recognized as the song Solty learned from Rose. A bright light catches Roy's attention, and as he approaches it, he discovers Solty, who is still salvageable but has a heavily damaged left arm and right leg and has shut down. As Roy embraces her, she awakens and states that she wishes to go home. ; :* : Roy is a middle-aged bounty hunter described as grumpy and gruff. His wife, Sarah Revant, died due to cancer and his daughter went missing after the Blast Fall event. His top priority is to find his missing daughter, whom he believes is still alive. The only possession left from his daughter is her shoe. He works for a small agency under Miranda Maverick. : At the beginning of the series, he saves a Resemble girl whom he names Solty and adopts her as his daughter. Later on, another girl Rose Anderson, lives with him. He does not realize Rose is actually his missing daughter until he discovers that Solty learned a song from her that his daughter loved as a little child which came from an old record of his that was very rare. Even after reuniting with his daughter, Roy also proudly acknowledges Solty as his other daughter despite her being a machine, and realizes Solty must carry the burden of humanity alone. ; :* : A vain, attention-seeking bandit who calls herself \\"The Blue Comet\\". She is honest, yet unyielding, proud, and selfish. Although she and her brothers donate their spoils to the Unregistered Citizens clustered in the city's underground and outskirts, they often cause large amounts of public damage in the process. She is armed with a laser-based hand pistol, and she rides a large motorcycle with three spherical wheels in front, driving wheels behind, and a cannon hidden in the frame. She occasionally hums the song \\"Return to love (Jazz version)\\" to calm herself. : It is later revealed that she is actually Roy's daughter . Her hair and eye colour had changed due to exposure to nanomachines from the Blast Fall. Having been adopted by Larry and Andy's father with no memory of who she was, she initially resisted the idea that she was Roy's daughter until later. She was supposedly killed in the collapse of a clock tower, but later, she was shown to be alive and working for Ashley Lynx, in order to follow their common dream of equality among residents. She was given a red and black Proceed suit. It also includes a jet pack, which allows her to fly. Solty eventually wore the suit in the final episode when she went into space. Eventually, she overcame Ashley's brainwashing to see the limitations and problems of her attitudes and dream. During the \\"Five Years Later\\" epilogue, she is referred to as \\"Representative Rita Revant\\" by a radio broadcast, indicating she attains a position of political power. ; :* : Roy's employer and Kasha's foster mother. She runs the \\"Maverick Hunters\\", an independent bounty hunting agency. She is normally a very kind and laid-back person, but can be aggressive when necessary. Her husband was killed in the Blast Fall. ; :* : Miranda's adopted daughter. She is pragmatic and slightly distrustful of others, but latches onto Solty and (eventually) Rose. Kasha forms an awkward friendship with Sylvia when they both stalk Rose and Ashley on their date. It is later revealed in the Extra Episode (OVA) that Celica's foster parents are her uncle and aunt. In the epilogue, Kasha is working as Rose's secretary. ; :* : A Resemble specialist in the city hospital. It is through his analysis that Solty's gynoid nature is first revealed. After being fired due to an accident during the diagnosis, he is hired by Miranda and moves into Roy and Solty's building. He is a stereotypical geek whose fascination with Solty annoys Roy and Kasha to no end. However, it is seen as being perverted, thus, he is comically beaten up by Kasha, Roy, and once by Miranda. R.U.C. Personnel ; :* : A white haired, high-ranking member of the R.U.C. His original name is Locke. The left side of his face and torso, his left arm, and possibly more of his body are Resemble. He is one of the few surviving first-generation immigrants, and once supervised the construction of the underground city. While he is charming superficially, he holds ulterior motives for those who work for him, and ultimately has little regard for his subordinates. In the final two episodes, he was shown to have had a romantic relationship with a human named Illumina Kisch, who stored her final words in Solty to be conveyed to him. Due to injury from accidents on two separate occasions, he was repaired via resemblization by Eunomia, but was later killed by Eunomia after losing control of her. ; :* : The dark-haired leader of R.U.C. Special Security Division (PROCEED Team). Integra is responsible and level-headed. Her PROCEED suit is pink and can increase her speed to superhuman levels, but it taxes her to do this more than three times successively. After the death of her teammates, Sylvia and Celica, she confronts Ashley for revenge and challenges him to a fight, but he defeats her even though she was still fighting after she exceeds her expected limit of three accelerations. However, she doesn't die and later appears in a hospital with Accela. Her name is based on the Honda/Acura Integra. ; :* : A hot-tempered blonde who has romantic feelings for Ashley. When Rose took over Integra's job as the leader of the PROCEED Team, Sylvia challenges Rose to a duel in their armour. Her PROCEED suit is blue and increases her strength. Later in the story, she confronts Ashley after she hears that Celica has been fired. Ashley consoles her before thrusting his resemble arm into her, killing her instantly. Her name is based on the Nissan Silvia. ; :* : A tanned, carefree sniper who works as long range support for the PROCEED Team. She is quite a laid back person who is very close to Sylvia and often teases Accela. Despite working for the R.U.C., she was an Unregistered Citizen in her youth until she was adopted by Kasha's uncle and aunt and raised as their own. Her PROCEED suit is orange, and contains multiple laser ports on the shoulders and arms. It also aids her sight, which is good in her position as a sniper. She has a penchant for slacking off and playing video games, but she does her job well as long as she gets paid. Later in the series, she rebels against the R.U.C. to avenge Sylvia's death but is killed by a sniper while confronting Rose.\\"Welcome Back\\" Her name is based on the Toyota Celica. ; :* : A redheaded, shy, information specialist of the PROCEED Team. Accela is a good cook. She takes care of Solty temporarily after Roy yells at her. Her PROCEED suit only appears in the last 4 episodes. It is white and allows her greater computer network access.\\"The Time of Truth\\" After her friends were killed at the hands of the R.U.C., she went on a maddened rampage by piloting the gargantuan floating vessel Hilga, docked inside R.U.C. itself. During the rampage, she destroyed large parts of the city with Hilga's powerful hyper beam cannon. After hearing the conversation between Solty and Rose, she self-destructed the vessel in order to stop the hyper beam cannon from firing.\\"Mine, Hers and the Girl's Feelings\\" She managed to survive, and later recovered in a hospital with Integra. Her name is based on the Mazda Axela. Supporting ; :* : The older of the two Anderson Brothers and Rose's elder foster brother. He has noticeably dark pink hair. He is the leader of the bandit group. While initially presented as an antagonist, he later acts as Roy's contact and informant in the series as compensation for taking Rose in as a roommate. He is injured while fighting off against a swarm of Resemble infected humans to allow Roy and Andy to continue on their way to deactivate Eunomia. He survives and later appears in the same hospital Integra and Accela were under treatment. ; :* : The younger, hot-tempered Anderson Brother. He has spiky brown hair. He is an expert in computer network and computer hacking. He is also very close to Yuto due to going missions with him and working together in the last episodes. It is later mentioned that he is in love with Rose (though with the knowledge that she wasn't his real sister). ; :* : A young female researcher and friend of Yuto's. Jeremy was performing an experiment in search of new forms of energy, in defiance of the R.U.C. monopoly. Her experiment attempted to harness it from the Aurora Shell, but her experiment failed, causing the clock tower where she was conducting the experiment to collapse. She ended up injured in the hospital with guilt. ; :*Age: old man in appearance (has lived at least as long as Ashley) :* : A first-generation immigrant and former senior member of the R.U.C. who knows Solty's workings well. He had a dispute with Ashley Lynx in the past and become a passive observer of the world. After Solty is damaged by Ashley Lynx, he repairs her using equipment inside one of the original colonization landing craft, which was buried under the city. ; : The central main computer of R.U.C. and one of the three core computers brought by the first colonists. Eunomia controls and regulates the water and energy supply in the city through its tentacle-like wirings. She is located in the lower levels of R.U.C. headquarters and serves as the heart of the city. She is also responsible for developing the registration system that separates humans in the city into \\"Registered Citizens\\" and \\"Unregistered Citizens\\". In later episodes, Ashley planned to take control of Eunomia by using Rose's PROCEED abilities to hack into Eunomia's main system. In response, Eunomia used the Resembles, who were linked to her by their implants, to go on a rampage and cause mass hysteria in the city. To end her havoc and to disrupt R.U.C. operations so they could infiltrate the headquarters, Roy put her into a standby mode by using the 'key' given to him by Joseph. Later, she was reactivated again and summarily killed Ashley for manipulating her. Eunomia was deactivated by Solty, who later reactivated some of her systems to keep the city running. ; :* : The third core computer brought by the original colonists, along with Eunomia and Dike (Solty). Eirene controls the migration ship, and has orbited the planet and supervised the city through Eunomia for more than 200 years. In the final story arc, she sets the colonization ship on a collision course to the newly terra-formed planet to correct human mistakes and to prove that she is still in control. She was therefore destroyed by Solty to avert the catastrophe. It's also revealed that she was responsible for the explosive nature of the Aurora Shell, to prevent humans from returning to the ship, and was thus responsible for the Blast Fall that happened 12 years previous. Her reason for doing so was because the remaining colonists on the ship had all died from a virus and she could not risk someone returning to the ship then returning to the planet carrying the infection. ; :* : A young orphan and Blast Fall survivor who is living with Joseph beyond the outskirts of the city. He found Solty lying in the wilderness after she ran away from Roy, and befriended her. But due to severe injuries caused by the Blast Fall and poor treatment, he dies soon after their meeting. ; :* : A Registered Citizen who runs a fruit stand. He later befriends Mii after she stole from him. Since his wife and daughter died in the Blast Fall, he adopts Mii after Solty defeats Eirene. ; :* : A young girl who steals fruits from Votre's food stall. She is an Unregistered Citizen and her parents died in the Blast Fall. Her hair is done to resemble Nekomimi. ; :* : Roy's wife, Rita's mother, and Miranda's best friend. She died of an illness before the series began. In flashbacks, she usually hums a lullaby to Rita from one of her husband's records. ; :* : A friend and co-worker of Locke (later known as Ashley) aboard the colonization ship. She was the overseer of the construction of the underground city and the terra-formation on the planet from the ship. She and the rest of the crew of the ship died from a mysterious illness. Her final act was giving Solty a mission of relaying a message to Ashley. Her features are exactly like Solty except a bit older and different hair color and style. Others ; :* : A bounty hunter mark who appeared on Episode:01. After the bounty was placed on his head, he was apprehended by Roy Revant. Later, he escaped from his prison with the help from Gray Walker, and the pair stole an R.U.C. security vehicle to take revenge against Roy. He is killed by Solty. ; :* : Dale Boyd's partner in crime. Both of his arms are Resemble that can extend at great lengths. He and his partner were both killed by lightning after Solty tossed them and the four-legged vehicle they were using into the Aurora Shell. ; :* : Solty's first friend, whom she met while shopping. Later, after seeing Solty's powers, she shuns her out of fear. Meryl appears in Episode:04. ; :* : Condemned Prisoner no. 11467, Test Subject no. 4385. He was a 78% Resemble, which was achieved with the most state-of-the-art technology. McLean escaped from the research facility and was being hunted by the PROCEED Team. Although cornered by Sylvia and Celica, he managed to escape into the sewers. Later, he kidnapped Meryl, causing a confrontation between him and Solty which resulted in his death. ; :* ; :* ; :* : A psychotic genius of explosive technology. He holds a grudge against Roy for intentionally destroying his right arm more than a decade ago, when Roy was still a police officer and mentally unstable due to his daughter Rita's disappearance. He set up several puzzles for Roy and Larry which include strapping fake bombs to a man, trying to detonate Roy's flat, and kidnapping Rose. He is eventually killed by several shots from Larry. ; :* : An Unregistered Citizen who becomes one of Roy's bounty targets. Vincent stole P-1O crystals to sell on the black market in order to earn money for his daughter's Resemble operation. Vincent told his daughter, Rita, that he is her uncle, for fear that his status would take away her rights as a Registered Citizen. ; :* : A New Rights Child who's living with Vincent Greco in the outskirts of the city. She's blind and crippled from the waist-down, disabilities she acquired from the Blast Fall. Vincent told her that he was her uncle, but he is actually her real father. Roy mistakenly thought that she was his missing daughter because of her name. ; :* : ; :* : A murderer who killed Rose's best friend's family when she was a child. Rose eventually finds him and confronts him, but he proves to be more than she can handle, largely due to the laser deflector blades in his arms. Solty then rescues Rose and defeats Kimberley, severing one of his arms. Later, Rose tries to kill him with her motorcycle, but decides to let him live. After Rose leaves in Roy's car, Larry shoots Kimberley in the head, killing him.

Improv Festival (commonly known as Fracas!) is a three-day (formerly a two-day) annual improvisational theatre festival held at The University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. The festival is hosted by Second Nature Improv, one of USC's improv troupes. In addition to performances, the festival hosts discussion panels with professional improvisers currently working in television, film, and/or theatre, as well as improv workshops. While the performances and panels are open to the public, workshops are available only to registered festival participants. History Fracas! I (2004) The first Fracas! Improv Festival was held on April 16 and 17, 2004, about a year and a half after Second Nature was formed. Noting the lack of attention given to college-aged improvisers at larger national festivals, founder and director of Second Nature, Nick Dazé, started Fracas! as a way to connect with other collegiate improv troupes. Eight troupes attended the inaugural festival, but with the exception of Recess (a troupe from George Washington University in Washington, D.C.), all the troupes were from California. Two troupes (including Second Nature) Each troupe was given a forty-minute performance slot, with four troupes performing each night. At the end of each performance, the audience voted on a favorite member of each troupe and those favorite performers played in an \\"All Star Show\\" which closed the festival on Saturday night. The festival was held adjacent to USC's campus at the Village Gate Theatre, which only sat 75 people at maximum capacity. Fracas! II (2005) The second annual festival took place April 15 and 16, 2005, also at the Village Gate Theatre. Ten troupes performed at the festival including Occam's Razor from The University of Chicago. Of the remaining nine troupes, four were from the University of Southern California. Unlike the previous year's festival, troupes at Fracas! II were given only 30 minute performance slots in order to accommodate the larger number of participating groups. Five troupes performed each evening, culminating with the \\"All Star Show\\" which ended the festival on Saturday night. Fracas! III (2006) The third annual Fracas! occurred on April 21 and 22, 2006, and was attended by six troupes. Because so few troupes participated, each was given a 45-minute time slot. As in past years, the favorite performers from each team played together in an \\"All Star Show\\" which ended the festival. New to the festival this year was the addition of professional workshops. Some of Los Angeles' top improvisers including James Thomas Bailey, Andrew Daly, Owen Burke and Eric Hunicutt taught workshops. Fracas! IV (2007) The fourth annual Fracas! in 2007 was a huge year of growth for the festival. An unprecedented 15 college troupes participated from nearly a dozen colleges nationwide. Additionally, with the Village Gate Theatre now too small a venue, Fracas! was moved to USC's Ground Zero Performance Cafe, which could fit double the audience of the Village Gate. The festival was expanded to three nights, and took place on April 12–14, 2007. The 2007 festival was attended by more than 1000 people, and had more than 150 registered participants. Fracas! IV consisted of 5 performances each evening, with each troupe performing for 40 minutes. A decision was made to replace the \\"All Star Show\\" which Second Nature believed encouraged showboating and was against the festival's spirit of collaboration. In place of the \\"All Star Show\\" an open improv jam was held at the end of each night of performances. Any audience members, including members from all troupes, were permitted to perform. For the first time in the festival's history, no admission was charged to audience members, with the bulk of the festival's cost being covered by donations. Nearly a dozen workshops were held over the course of the three-day festival, allowing participants to study with top performers from The Upright Citizen's Brigade Theatre, iO West, The Groundlings, and ComedySportz. Additionally, Fracas! IV saw the addition of discussion panels held with improvisers who were currently working in television, film, and/or theatre. Panel members included Angela Kinsey and Melora Hardin from The Office, Frank Caeti and Keegan-Michael Key of MADtv and The Second City, and Michael Bunin of My Boys. Panels were held on three topics, \\"Improv and Sketch Comedy\\", \\"Improv in the Entertainment Industry\\", and \\"Short Form and Long Form\\". The latter had representatives from all four of Los Angeles' major improv training centers. The Onion was the headlining sponsor of the 2007 Fracas! Improv Festival, with additional support from campus radio station KSCR as well as USC's Undergraduate Student Government. Fracas! V (2008) The fifth annual Fracas! Improv Festival showed the festival's continued ability to grow. The festival hosted 18 troupes, expanding to welcome three more schools. Additionally, Fracas! became an international festival for the first time ever, expanding its horizons and hosting a troupe from the United Kingdom. The opening night of the festival was moved from the Village Gate Theatre to USC's McCarthy Quad, another first. Fracas! V took place on April 17–19, 2008. Each night offered 6 hours of free improv, showcasing 6 troupes per night and concluding with an improv jam open to the public. The amount of participating troupes led to more professional workshops, offering students 14 different workshops with a dozen professional improvisers from The Upright Citizen's Brigade Theatre, iO West, The Groundlings, and ComedySportz. The festival also added a fourth discussion panel. The discussion panels once again offered an hour of candid conversation with the country's top improvisers from film and television. Panelists included Ed Helms from The Office, Stephnie Weir from MADtv, Saturday Night Live's Jerry Minor, Todd Stashwick of The Riches, and members the popular improv troupes Convoy and The S.W.A.R.M.. Discussion panel topics included: \\"Women in Improv\\", Improv in the Entertainment Industry\\", \\"Forming and Sustaining a Cohesive Group\\", and \\"Creating an Original Improvised Show\\". For the first time ever, collegiate troupes, panelists, and workshop instructors were able to record short messages in the KSCR Fracas! Green Room using the Fracas! Web Cam. The videos were updated regularly so that participants could follow them on the Fracas! Flickr Page. Participating Troupes by year =Fracas!

While the discussion panels were aimed at college improvisers, they were open to the general public at no charge. The festival planners intended for the panels to provide a starting point for the young improvisers that attended Fracas! to begin considering how the art of improv can continue after college. Though it was the first time discussion panels were held, a number of high-profile improvisers volunteered their time to be panel members, including cast members from The Office, MADtv, and each of the major improv training centers in Los Angeles. A member of Second Nature Improv moderated each panel. Video footage of all three Fracas! IV panels are available at the festival website, as well as being the preliminary episodes of the Fracas! Improv Podcast. =2008 Discussion Panels= The following discussion panels took place at the 5th Annual Fracas! Improv Festival.

Workshops With the entire festival aimed at fostering the experience of the college improviser, workshops make up a major part of the Fracas! Improv Festival. For many college improvisers who live outside of the improvisational epicenters (Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago), the festival is an opportunity to receive professional instruction that is not available to them outside of the three main cities for improvisation. Each year, instructors from Los Angeles' top improv training centers offer workshops at the Fracas! Improv Festival. In order to take a workshop at Fracas!, one must be a registered festival participant, and thus they must also be a current college student. =2008 Workshops= *Improvised Plays, with Billy Merritt, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre *Adding Information and Heightening, with Jim Woods, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre *Finding the Game, with Sean Conroy, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre *Introduction to Game, with Drew Difonzo Marks, artistic director, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, Los Angeles *Shakespearean Improv, with Matt Gourley, ComedySportz *Improv for Film, TV, and Commercials, with Brian Palermo, The Groundlings *Theatre and TV Genres, with Andy Goldblatt, ComedySportz *Playing it Real/Playing it with Integrity, with Will McGlaughlin, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre *Group Support and Ensemble Building, with Drew Difonzo Marks, artistic director, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, Los Angeles *Pacing and Rhythm, with Lloyd Ahlquist (Stars in Epic Rap Battles of History with Nicepeter)., artistic director, The Westside Eclectic *Scenes from Monologues, with Chad Carter, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre *Character, with Drew Droege, The Groundlings *Let the Scene Find You, with Aaron Krebs, iO West =2007 Workshops= *Harold Intensive, with Owen Burke, artistic director, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, New York *Character, with Amy Rhodes, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, Funny Or Die *Finding the Game, with Sean Conroy, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, Crossballs, The Untitled Onion Sketch Movie *Shakespearean Improv, with Matt Gourley, ComedySportz *Second Beats, with Sean Conroy *Television Genres, with Andy Goldblatt, ComedySportz, Channel 101 *Relationship, with Brian Palermo, The Groundlings, Thank God You're Here, Curb Your Enthusiasm *Theatre Genres, with Andy Goldblatt *Sound and Movement, with Seth Morris, artistic director, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre Los Angeles, Curb Your Enthusiasm *Using Your 'Where', with Eric Hunicutt, training director, iO West, The Reckoning *Musical Improv, with James Thomas Bailey, artistic director, ComedySportz =2006 Workshops= *Andrew Daly, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, The Swarm, MADtv *Owen Burke, artistic director, The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, New York *Eric Hunicutt *Matt Gourley, ComedySportz *James Thomas Bailey, artistic director, ComedySportz Sponsors The 2007 Fracas!

Her elder sister, Donna Simpson, also plays guitar and sings in the group. Vikki has released eight studio albums with the Waifs, and wrote the band's singles, \\"Bridal Train\\" (2004) and \\"Sun Dirt Water\\" (2007).  Early life and education  Thorn and her elder sister, Donna, grew up in Albany, Western Australia. Their father, Jimmy Simpson, fished salmon in season. In an interview with Andrew Denton on Enough Rope, Thorn described the lifestyle of a fisherman's daughter:  Career  Thorn received her a harmonica when she was a teenager, and started playing Bob Dylan songs. She harmonised Everly Brothers songs with her sister who played guitar. They formed a blues covers duo, Colours, in Albany. On Thorn's last day of high school, aged 16, she was picked up by Donna, in a yellow Kombi, who asked her to travel with her: Thorn and Donna met Josh Cunningham in August 1992 in Broome, the sisters had been travelling across greater Western Australia, playing the blues in rural bars based on what a town's tourist bureau described as the music scene for that area. After less than an hour conversation with Cunningham, Donna asked him to join them in Colours as a trio. Upon return to Albany their \\"grandmother said 'Oh here come the waifs'\\" and they decided to rename their trio as the Waifs. The Waifs toured Western Australia from 1993 to 1996. In 1996 they moved to the east coast and made the group a serious music career. In May 1996, their self-titled debut was released, three months after it was recorded. It featured three songs from Thorn: \\"Circles\\", \\"I Believe\\", and \\"Company\\". After touring more throughout the mid-nineties, the band released Shelter Me in 1998, and Sink or Swim in 2000. Sink or Swim was released, and more touring commenced. The Waifs were now becoming an international concern, and popularity increased when Up All Night was released. Shortly after its release, the album was certified 2x platinum in Australia and two successful singles followed: \\"London Still\\" and \\"Lighthouse\\", written by Thorn's sister Donna and Josh Cunningham, respectively. At the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami relief concert, WaveAid, in January 2005 the Waifs performed with Thorn providing harmonica. Thorn's song \\"Bridal Train\\" was released as a single, by the group in 2004, and the song won the USA Songwriting Competition in 2006. The Waifs' fifth studio album, Sun, Dirt, Water (September 2007), provided a title single, which was written by Thorn. During 2014 Thorn and Donna undertook a side project, Stray Sisters, with Ben Franz on pedal steel and lap steel guitars (also an auxiliary bass guitarist of the Waifs). Thorn recalled \\"That was a real different experience for me because usually I play a minimum amount of guitar in the Waifs but when I was in the Stray Sisters I had to play more rhythm, supporting rhythm parts to what Donna was doing. So that was the good thing about it. That challenged me a little bit and I got to play electric guitar.\\" The group's eighth studio album, Ironbark (February 2017), led Thorn to reflect on their being together for 25 years, \\"I just sent an email the other day saying 'When the tour's over, when do we celebrate?' We need to have a party, we need to have something where we sit down and celebrate, just have a toast.\\" Personal life Vikki Thorn and bandmate, Josh Cunningham, had a romantic relationship for 12 years, which according to Thorn \\"broke down\\". She also said that \\"Through all those years of touring, there was that dynamic going on.\\" Thorn wrote the Waifs song, \\"Sun Dirt Water\\" (August 2007), for her husband, Matt Thorn, \\"I wrote the song as a letter to him, just letting him know the things that were important to me and describing the road we were going to travel... It's the last song I wrote, and I wrote it four years ago.\\" The couple have three children and since 2008 reside in Utah.

Arun Prasad. It stars Nandamuri Balakrishna, Anjala Zhaveri, Shilpa Shetty in the lead roles and music composed by Mani Sharma. The movie created a lot of hype since it followed the stupendous hit of Narasimha Naidu and was intended to be an image make-over for Nandamuri Balakrishna from Action Hero to Family Hero. Plot Sagar (Nandamuri Balakrishna) is a forest ranger. Swetha (Shilpa Shetty) is Sagar's boss. Nemali (Anjala Zhaveri) is a tribal woman. The first half of the film revolves around how Nemali and Swetha try to impress Sagar, but a mysterious woman appears and reveals that the forest ranger's name is not Sagar and he is an impostor. The second half of the film starts with the impostor relating in the flashback that his real name is Prabhu and he is a petty thief who gets to know a person called Sagar, an intelligent unemployed graduate. Sagar has a mother and sister, who made sacrifices to enable him to graduate. Sagar, now a forest ranger becomes close to Prabhu. When Sagar's mother falls ill and she needs one lakh as medical fee, Prabhu arranges to get the money by giving a false testimony in court, but this misfires and ends in him being imprisoned for life. But he escapes from the police and enters the forest where he sees Sagar severely injured in a car accident. Sagar asks Prabhu to take care of his mother and sister. Since nobody knows the identity of the real Sagar, Prabhu impersonates him as forest ranger where he tries to improve the life of tribal people and ensures that poachers and animal killers are kept at bay. At the same time, pretending to be Sagar he keeps in touch with the Sagar's family. The rest of the story revolves around how the false Sagar arranges the marriage of Sagar's sister before fighting in a routine climax.

In so doing, the latent heat is released by the substance and transferred to the surrounding environment. Condensers are used for efficient heat rejection in many industrial systems. Condensers can be made according to numerous designs, and come in many sizes ranging from rather small (hand-held) to very large (industrial-scale units used in plant processes). For example, a refrigerator uses a condenser to get rid of heat extracted from the interior of the unit to the outside air. Condensers are used in air conditioning, industrial chemical processes such as distillation, steam power plants and other heat-exchange systems. Use of cooling water or surrounding air as the coolant is common in many condensers. History The earliest laboratory condenser, a \\"Gegenstromkühler\\" (counter-flow condenser), was invented in 1771 by the Swedish-German chemist Christian Weigel. By the mid-19th century, German chemist Justus von Liebig would provide his own improvements on the preceding designs of Weigel and Johann Friedrich August Göttling, with the device becoming known as the Liebig condenser.Liebig, Justus von; Poggendorff, J.C.; Wöhler, Fr. (eds.) (1842), Handwörterbuch der reinen und angewandten Chemie [Dictionary of pure and applied chemistry], vol. 2 (in German). Braunschweig, Germany: Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn. Article: \\"Destillation,\\" pp. 526–554. Principle of operation A condenser is designed to transfer heat from a working fluid (e.g. water in a steam power plant) to a secondary fluid or the surrounding air. The condenser relies on the efficient heat transfer that occurs during phase changes, in this case during the condensation of a vapor into a liquid. The vapor typically enters the condenser at a temperature above that of the secondary fluid. As the vapor cools, it reaches the saturation temperature, condenses into liquid and releases large quantities of latent heat. As this process occurs along the condenser, the quantity of vapor decreases and the quantity of liquid increases; at the outlet of the condenser, only liquid remains. Some condenser designs contain an additional length to subcool this condensed liquid below the saturation temperature. Countless variations exist in condenser design, with design variables including the working fluid, the secondary fluid, the geometry and the material. Common secondary fluids include water, air, refrigerants, or phase-change materials. Condensers have two significant design advantages over other cooling technologies: *Heat transfer by latent heat is much more efficient than heat transfer by sensible heat only *The temperature of the working fluid stays relatively constant during condensation, which maximizes the temperature difference between the working and secondary fluid. Examples of condensers *A surface condenser is one in which condensing medium and vapors are physically separated and used when direct contact is not desired. It is a shell and tube heat exchanger installed at the outlet of every steam turbine in thermal power stations. Commonly, the cooling water flows through the tube side and the steam enters the shell side where the condensation occurs on the outside of the heat transfer tubes. The condensate drips down and collects at the bottom, often in a built-in pan called a hotwell. The shell side often operates at a vacuum or partial vacuum, produced by the difference in specific volume between the steam and condensate. Conversely, the vapor can be fed through the tubes with the coolant water or air flowing around the outside. *In chemistry, a condenser is the apparatus which cools hot vapors, causing them to condense into a liquid. See \\"Condenser (laboratory)\\" for laboratory-scale condensers, as opposed to industrial-scale condensers. Examples include the Liebig condenser, Graham condenser, and Allihn condenser. This is not to be confused with a condensation reaction which links two fragments into a single molecule by an addition reaction and an elimination reaction. :In laboratory distillation, reflux, and rotary evaporators, several types of condensers are commonly used. The Liebig condenser is simply a straight tube within a cooling water jacket, and is the simplest (and relatively least expensive) form of condenser. The Graham condenser is a spiral tube within a water jacket, and the Allihn condenser has a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube, each increasing the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense. Being more complex shapes to manufacture, these latter types are also more expensive to purchase. These three types of condensers are laboratory glassware items since they are typically made of glass. Commercially available condensers usually are fitted with ground glass joints and come in standard lengths of 100, 200, and 400 mm. Air-cooled condensers are unjacketed, while water-cooled condensers contain a jacket for the water. *Larger condensers are also used in industrial-scale distillation processes to cool distilled vapor into liquid distillate. Commonly, the coolant flows through the tube side and distilled vapor through the shell side with distillate collecting at or flowing out the bottom. Condenser unit for central air conditioning for a typical house *A condenser unit used in central air conditioning systems typically has a heat exchanger section to cool down and condense incoming refrigerant vapor into liquid, a compressor to raise the pressure of the refrigerant and move it along, and a fan for blowing outside air through the heat exchanger section to cool the refrigerant inside. A typical configuration of such a condenser unit is as follows: The heat exchanger section wraps around the sides of the unit with the compressor inside. In this heat exchanger section, the refrigerant goes through multiple tube passes, which are surrounded by heat transfer fins through which cooling air can circulate from outside to inside the unit. There is a motorized fan inside the condenser unit near the top, which is covered by some grating to keep any objects from accidentally falling inside on the fan. The fan is used to pull outside cooling air in through the heat exchanger section at the sides and blow it out the top through the grating. These condenser units are located on the outside of the building they are trying to cool, with tubing between the unit and building, one for vapor refrigerant entering and another for liquid refrigerant leaving the unit. Of course, an electric power supply is needed for the compressor and fan inside the unit. *In a direct-contact condenser, hot vapor and cool liquid are introduced into a vessel and allowed to mix directly, rather than being separated by a barrier such as the wall of a heat exchanger tube. The vapor gives up its latent heat and condenses to a liquid, while the liquid absorbs this heat and undergoes a temperature rise. The entering vapor and liquid typically contain a single condensable substance, such as a water spray being used to cool air and adjust its humidity. Other Types of Condensers There are three other condensers used in HVAC systems: *Water-cooled *Air-cooled *Evaporative Applications: *Air cooled – If the condenser is located on the outside of the unit, the air cooled condenser can provide the easiest arrangement. These types of condensers eject heat to the outdoors and are simple to install. Most common uses for this condenser are domestic refrigerators, upright freezers and in residential packaged air conditioning units. A great feature of the air cooled condenser is they are very easy to clean. Since dirt can cause serious issues with the condensers performance, it is highly recommended that these be kept clear of dirt. *Water cooled – Although a little pricier to install, these condensers are the more efficient type. Commonly used for swimming pools and condensers piped for city water flow, these condensers require regular service and maintenance. They also require a cooling tower to conserve water. To prevent corrosion and the forming of algae, water cooled condensers require a constant supply of makeup water along with water treatment. Depending on the application you can choose from tube in tube, shell and coil or shell and tube condensers. All are essentially made to produce the same outcome, but each in a different way. *Evaporative – While these remain the least popular choice, they are used when either water supply is inadequate to operate water cooled condenser or condensation temperature is lower that can achieved by air cooled condenser. Evaporative condensers can be used inside or outside of a building and under typical conditions, operate at a low condensing temperature.

Biography McFee was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1886. From 1902 to 1905, he attended Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri. In 1907, he inherited a large sum of money, allowing him to enroll in the Stevenson Art School and pursue painting full-time. He was heavily influenced by the two summers he spent attending classes at the Art Students League in Woodstock, New York, studying under L. Birge Harrison. In November 1913, McFee exhibited six works at the MacDowell Club. In 1919, McFee was one of the founders of the Woodstock Artists’ Association, along with Andrew Dasburg, Carl Eric Lindin, John Carlson, and Frank Swift Chase. In 1920, his work was shown at the Gallerie Georges Petit's International Art Exhibition in Paris. McFee's first one-man show was in 1927 at the Rehn Galler. In 1939 McFee was appointed Director at the Witte Museum School of Art, which was sponsored by the San Antonio Art League. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1940, and in 1940-1941 he held positions at Claremont Graduate School and the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, California. He works closely with fellow Los Angeles artist and teacher Bentley Schaad. McFee was married to Aileen Fletcher Jones from 1916 to 1936, when he eloped with her niece, Eleanor Brown Gutsell. McFee's synchromist and cubist influenced works were exhibited at many notable venues throughout his career, including the Carnegie Institute, the Pennsylvania Academy, the Corcoran Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum. McFee died in 1953 of pneumonia at St. Luke Hospital in Pasadena, California. References Further reading * Henry Lee McFee and Formalist Realism in American Still Life. 1923-1936. By John Baker.

The film is the winner of two Golden Raspberry Awards and has a 6% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Plot Mary Horowitz, a crossword puzzle writer for the Sacramento Herald, is socially awkward and considers her pet hamster her only true friend. Her parents decide to set her up on a blind date. Mary's expectations are low, as she tells her hamster. Mary is pleasantly surprised when her date turns out to be handsome and charming Steve Miller, a cameraman for the television news network CCN. Steve does not reciprocate her feelings. After an attempt at an intimate moment fails, in part because of her awkwardness and inability to stop talking about vocabulary, Steve fakes a phone call about covering the news out of town. Trying to get Mary out of his truck, he tells her he wishes she could be there. Mary believes him and decides to pursue him. Mary's obsession gets her fired when she creates a crossword titled \\"All About Steve\\". Following her termination, Mary decides to track Steve around the country in the hopes of winning his affection. She is encouraged by CCN news reporter Hartman Hughes, who hopes to use Mary's encyclopedic knowledge in his reports to help himself get a promotion to become a news anchor. On the road, Mary annoys some bus passengers so much, the driver abandons her. She hitchhikes with a trucker named Norm, then meets and travels with a pair of protesters: Elizabeth, a ditzy but sweet and likeable girl, and Howard, who sells apples he carves into celebrities. She gradually grows close to the two. Steve and crew end up covering a breaking news story: an old mine collapsed with numerous deaf children stuck inside. Initially, it appears that the children are rescued. Mary, who arrives on the scene, accidentally falls into the mine shaft as well while making a beeline for Steve. It turns out that not all the children have been rescued, and Mary is trapped with one left behind. Steve begins to realize that Mary, in her own unique way, is a beautiful person. Just as Mary figures a way out, the two are joined by Hartman, who is made to feel guilty by Elizabeth and Howard for getting Mary into this predicament. Mary's rescue plan works, but she lets Hartman take the credit. Mary finally realizes she does not need Steve to be happy. She states, \\"If you love someone, set him free; if you have to stalk him, he probably wasn't yours in the first place.\\" After the end credits, a competitive TV reporter, in despair that Hartman got popularity by falling into the mine while trying to save Mary, also jumps into the mine.

The plant has golden yellow flowers which bloom from April to May. Description Lithospermum canescens grows to in height, growing from a thick, red, woody taproot with one to several stems that are usually not branched. Its leaves are alternate and oblong, and lack a petiole. The leaves range around in length and have any width under . Both the leaves and stems are grey-green and pubescent, meaning they are covering with many short, silky, erect trichomes, or hairs. Its flowers are tubular and cluster at the terminal racemes, or at the end of stems. They are commonly yellow to orange in hue and are about in diameter. The fruit of the plant is a hard, smooth, yellowish-white seedlike nutlet. Taxonomy The genus name lithospermum comes from the Greek lethos, meaning \\"stone\\", and sperma, meaning \\"seed\\", referencing the stone-like seeds of the plant. The species name canscens means \\"white with age\\", referencing the short, white hairs that cover the plant. The common name \\"hoary puccoon\\" also references the short, white trichomes on the plant, as hoary also means \\"white or grey with age, and the word \\"puccoon\\" comes from a Native American word meaning \\"a plant that yields a pigment\\". Habitat and distribution The plant commonly grows in dry to moderately moist soils, in prairies, woodlands, and the edges of roads. It seldom grows in sandy soils. It grows throughout the eastern United States, from eastern Nebraska to Georgia. Uses Native American children chew the plant with their gum to dye it red, as referenced in the common name \\"hoary puccoon\\". The taproot produces the reddish-purple juice that is commonly used as a pigment. Native Americans also use the roots of the plant to treat asthma or any lung complaints, and as a sedative. The Menomini peoples used the ripened, white seed of the plant as a type of ceremonial bead.

He was described by one critic as \\"the greatest living painter of the Western Desert\\". page 56 Early life Tommy Yannima Pikarli Watson was a senior Pitjantjatara elder and law man of the Karima skin group. He was born around 1935 in Anumarapiti, 75 kilometers west of Irrunytju, also known as Wingellina, in Western Australia, near the junction of its border with the Northern Territory and South Australia. His given names of Yannima and Pikarli relate to specific sites near Anumarapiti. Watson's mother died during his infancy, and his father when he was about eight years old. He subsequently went to live with his father's brother, who himself died two years later. Tommy was then adopted by Nicodemus Watson, his father's first cousin. It was at this point that he went to live at Ernabella Mission, and adopted the surname Watson in addition to his Aboriginal birth name, thus becoming Tommy Yannima Pikarli Watson. Nicodemus Watson became a strong father figure. Together they traveled widely, and Watson learned the traditional skills required to lead a nomadic existence in the desert, including the fashioning of tools and weapons from trees using burning coals, how and what to hunt, and how and where to find water. Under Nicodemus Watson's guidance, Watson learned about nature and his people's ancestral stories, collectively known to the Aboriginal peoples of Australia as Tjukurrpa. Watson's first contact with white Australians was at the Ernabella Mission, which opened in 1940. After a short time at Ernabella, he returned to his community to be initiated. Tommy Watson's upbringing is similar to that of many Indigenous people born around the same time, from that point forward living a traditional nomadic existence until his early teens and then working as a stockman and labourer. During his time working at Papunya he met the school teacher Geoffrey Bardon who was pivotal in supporting the developing Aboriginal Art movement. Art career Tommy Watson began painting in 2001, and was one of a handful of painters establishing the Irrunytju community art centre in 2001. Watson's work has received critical acclaim, both within Australia and internationally, with art critics drawing parallels between Watson and Western Abstract painters such as Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Kasimir Malevich, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman.Maurcice Tuchman 'Hidden Meaning in Abstract Art ' in Edward Weisberger The Spiritual in Abstract Art , Los Angeles County Museum California and Abbeville Press inc New York 1987 pp34-35 John MacDonald wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald that Watson \\"is a master of invention and arguably the outstanding painter of the Western Desert\\", going on to compare his use of colour to Henri Matisse. In 2003 Watson was one of eight Indigenous artists, alongside Paddy Bedford, John Mawurndjul, Ningura Napurrula, Lena Nyadbi, Michael Riley, Judy Watson and Gulumbu Yunupingu, who collaborated on a commission to provide works that decorate one of the Musée du quai Branly's four buildings completed in 2006. In early 2013, Watson moved to live with family in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. Following an improvement in his health he resumed painting, producing large works up to five meters long. Until the end of his life he was represented commercially by Yanda Aboriginal Art and Piermarq,http://www.piermarq.com.au/tommy-Watson-register/ with large canvases produced at Yanda Aboriginal Art in 2013 selling over $800,000 each. One work, entitled Ngayuku Ngura - Anumara Piti, sold for around $500,000 through Sydney's Piermarq gallery to prominent Sydney businessman Andrew Wise.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/visual-arts/three-way-battle-over- western-desert-artist-tommy-watson-not-a-pretty-picture/story- fn9d3avm-1226762144842# In 2014, a major work of 160 x 485 cm by Tommy Watson was exhibited at The European Fine Art Fair (TEFAF), one of the world's most prestigious art fairs. Watson's work was also on display as part of a group exhibition of First Contact Western Desert Masters also featuring Naata Nungurrayi, Esther Giles Nampitjinpa, and George Hairbrush Tjungurrayi at the Piermarq gallery in Sydney in June–July 2014. In 2014 the Art Series Hotel Group named Watson as the first Indigenous artist to feature in the collection. Located in Adelaide, his namesake hotel The Watson features a collection of high-quality reproduction prints.http://www.artserieshotels.com.au/watson/ Style Tommy Watson was known for his use of strong vibrant colours, that symbolically represented the ancestral stories of his country. Judith Ryan, Senior Curator of Indigenous Art at the National Gallery of Victoria, has described Watson's colour as \\"incandescent\\". Watson's understanding of Australia's physical environment and its relationship with the ancestral stories came to form the central element of his paintings. Watson created his works on premium Belgian linen and favoured Ara Acrylic paint, created by the Gerrit Rietveld Academie. Tommy has been associated with the 'Colour Power' movement that developed within the Indigenous art scene between 1984 and 2004.Judith Ryan Colour Power:Aboriginal Art Post 1984, in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Victoria Melbourne Vic 2005 p 112 Watson himself stated that his art is an exploration of traditional Aboriginal culture, in which the land and spirituality are intertwined and communicated through stories passed on from generation to generation. He said, \\"I want to paint these stories so that others can learn and understand about our culture and country.\\" Collections * Art Gallery of New South Wales * National Gallery of Australia * National Gallery of Victoria * Musee du Quai Branly, Paris * Art Gallery of Western Australia * South Australian Art Gallery * Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory * Bega Valley Regional Gallery * Colin Laverty, Collection * Patrick Corrigan, CollectionPatrick Corrigan (businessman) * Auscorp Collection * Kerry Stokes Collection Artwork File:Tommy Painting.jpgTommy Watson, painting at Yanda 2013 File:Tommy-Watson The-Australian-300x168.jpgTommy Watson, Major Work in Country 2013.

The Crofoot is a busy concert venue for popular music acts, and other larger private events or festivals. All-age shows as well as adult-only concerts are held. History Pontiac is the first inland city of Michigan. The Pontiac Company plotted it in 1818 where the Saginaw Indian Trail (Woodward Avenue) crossed the Schiawassee Indian Trail (Orchard Lake Road). The Clinton River created double peninsula where it snaked through what would become downtown Pontiac. The Pontiac Commercial Historic District is located just north of where the Saginaw Trail crossed the Clinton River. Historically, the business district of Pontiac was centered at the intersection of Pike and Saginaw. On April 30, 1840, the entire commercial district on both sides of Saginaw from Pike to Lawrence was leveled in a fire. In response to this event, all new buildings were subsequently built with masonry construction. Between 1840 and the end of the Civil War, many of the buildings along Saginaw were rebuilt. In the early 1960s the entire area on the South West quadrant of Pike and Saginaw, and much of the historic property to the south of the Clinton River (Water Street), were demolished for urban renewal. The Crofoot Project survived both the fire and the widespread demolition. The building on the southeast corner of Pike and Saginaw was not burned down, and it was spared demolition in the 1970s. In 1882, it was rebuilt, re-using the existing foundations, floors and some walls. Michael E. Crofoot, who named the subject property the “Crofoot Block”, was a vigorous and active man whose life epitomized the development of Pontiac after its 1818 founding, in the Civil War era, prior to the rapid growth from the expansion of the automobile industry. Michael E. Crofoot was a prominent businessman, attorney, Judge of Oakland County Probate Court from 1849 to 1856, and a man involved in Oakland County, Michigan and national affairs. He was a delegate to the 1856 Democratic National Convention. After the Civil War, he was selected in 1865 to represent Oakland County in raising subscriptions for the Michigan Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in downtown Detroit. He lived three blocks up the hill on Williams Street, where his home was one of nine Pontiac landmarks featured on an 1867 “Birds Eye View of Pontiac” by Albert Ruger. He was on the State Building Commission for the State Asylum in 1874, which was completed in Pontiac in 1878. He represented a defendant in 1882 before the United States Supreme Court. He rebuilt the 1830 era building at Pontiac’s first corner in 1882 and named it the “Crofoot Block”. He practiced law on the 3rd floor, overlooking from his 10-foot by north-facing window the rapid growth of Pontiac’s Downtown Commercial District. Pontiac’s Crofoot School was named after this prominent family, and is still in use. The Crofoot Project, consisting of three adjacent buildings—the Crofoot Building, the Vernor's Building, and the New Crofoot Block—is a unique contributor to the local Pontiac Commercial Historic District. The Crofoot Building, located at the crossroads of Pontiac's original 1818 plot, has anchored the Southeast quadrant of Pontiac since 1882. The building's central tower once displayed, in raised masonry letters, the name of its builders, the locally prominent Crofoot family. The Crofoot Building's three bays and two stories of street- level store and second-floor office uses originally formed and still retain the urban pattern of 19th century Pontiac. Facade remodelings and occupant turnovers have little changed this pattern of uses. The Crofoot Building's street level has housed barbers, meat markets, an American Express office, saloons, lunch rooms, shoe stores and millinery shops; while the second floor has housed photographers, land developers, tailors, insurance agencies, and attorneys. The third floor (no longer extant) once housed Judge Michael E. Crofoot's legal offices. The Crofoot Building is arguably the largest physical survivor of Pontiac's original plat and of its brick nineteenth century architecture. The building has outlasted both of the 1920s expansive remodeling boom and the 1970s demolitions in the name of urban renewal. The Vernor's Building illustrates another thread in downtown Pontiac's urban formation: the single Victorian facade completely remodeled in the 1920s boom. The Vernor's Building originally shared a similar Victorian facade with the Crofoot Building: open storefronts at street level, a brick second floor pierced by windows, and a third-floor, full-height mansard roof (Photo 3). In 1926, the building was remodeled to house a Vernor's Ginger Ale Soda Fountain; and its distinct brick second-floor was obliterated in a quickening of urban intensity, to form a two-level open storefront (Photo 2 ). Its mansard roof was extant until at least 1935; it was lost sometime after, perhaps when the Crofoot Building lost its third-floor mansard roof and tower. The Vernor's Soda Fountain remained at this address for at least twenty years. The New Crofoot Block dates not from Victorian downtown Pontiac, but from the expansive automobile-manufacturing Pontiac of the early twentieth century. The New Crofoot Block occupies the rear of Lot 59, the original rear yard of the Crofoot Building, which was earlier occupied by a service barn. By c. 1912, this rear yard had become too valuable for such a use, and a new two-story and basement structure was built, filling the lot. The building's street level had four storefronts facing Pike Street, and the second floor had office space accessible through the original Crofoot Building. The Pontiac City Directory referred to these second-floor offices as \\"The New Crofoot Block\\". The architecture of the new building was a business-like and contemporary, rather than an attempt to emulate its Victorian namesake. The new facade emphasized its large window openings on both floors, surrounding them with a dark cider- colored brick frame, trimmed with limestone, and iced on the top with a pressed-metal entablature. These three adjacent buildings, despite their different origins, were joined together sometime after World War II. Their heights were equalized, their second-floor windows were ruthlessly reset, and their combined street facades were wrapped in a skin of porcelain-metal panels (Photos 6,7), exemplifying another stage in the development of downtown Pontiac. The Crofoot Project is a unique contributor to the local Pontiac Commercial Historic District because: 1) it is an assemblage of three distinct adjoining buildings that exemplify three threads in the development of the District; 2) the Crofoot Building is unique in its crossroads location, its size, footprint, and date in the District; 3) the three buildings have survived with their footprints intact; 4) the three buildings have retained their historic and urban layering of street-level retail and second-floor office uses; and 5) all three buildings have retained large portions of their historic exterior integrity. The Crofoot Today and The Masonic Temple As recently as 2005, the City of Pontiac had condemned this property, and scheduled it for demolition. In 2006 a local developer began the renovation of this important Pontiac landmark. On Sept 7, 2007 the doors to The Crofoot reopened as a new home for music & art in Metro Detroit. The building features a state-of-the-art sound system, and much of the original historical integrity remains. September 24, 2013 The Crofoot presents announced they will be the main promoter for the Detroit Masonic Temple. The Crofoot has played host to countless live events and gatherings, including appearances by Michelle Obama, Bill Cosby, John Waters (filmmaker), and shows from Attila (deathcore band), Lupe Fiasco, Twenty One Pilots, Chvrches, Upon A Burning Body, Jimmy Eat World, Deadmau5, The National (band), Girl Talk, The New Pornographers, Owl City, Sufjan Stevens, Will Oldham, Above and Beyond, Craig Owens (musician), Stars, Paul Van Dyk, Band of Horses, Vampire Weekend, 3OH!3, Bon Iver, King Crimson, Trevor Dunn, St. Vincent, The Avett Brothers, Public Image Ltd., Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, EELS (band), Flyleaf, Lindsey Stirling, Of Mice & Men (band), Sammy Adams, Black Veil Brides, Rodriguez, Cody Simpson, Machine Gun Kelly, Sick Puppies, Motionless in White, Bad Books, We the Kings, Enter Shikari, We Came as Romans, Miss May I, The Wombats, Morning Parade, LCD Soundsystem, The Front Bottoms, Caravan Palace, and Killswitch Engage.

The Gisborne Botanical Gardens nowadays occupy between Aberdeen Road and the Taruheru River. There are still many trees remaining from the early period. There is also a Gisborne botanic garden in the town of Gisborne, Australia. History The Botanical Gardens is Gisborne's oldest reserve. It was set aside in 1874 as a public garden. In that year a recreational reserve of was created, just outside the city boundary beside Taruheru River. The site developed into Gisborne's first recreation reserve, where cricket was played, until 1901, when Victoria Domain became the home for cricket. Between 1915 and 1920 an area of native bush was planted. By the 1960s the poplars which were planted in the early days of the gardens were mature. The row of trees along the river front was known as Poplar Avenue. The Botanical Gardens was developed as formal Botanical Gardens by this time, with ornate grand entrance gates and wide pathways and rows of flower beds. During the late 1960s the park was managed more as a park. In 1972 a “free flying” aviary was constructed. During the 1970s the Gardens were shifting to a 'Botanic Garden' again, rather than a park as Council had decided in the 1960s. In 1978 Mr and Mrs J.B. Greig bequeathed their Cacti collection to Council. A glass house was built in the Botanical Gardens to provide space for this collection. In 1994 the Gisborne District Council adopted the concept of developing three sister gardens, in relation to the sister cities of Gisborne around the Pacific Rim. Nowadays the Gisborne District Council, the Friends of the Botanical Gardens and the Gisborne Sister Cities Committee are working to improve and develop the Botanical Gardens. Plant collections There are three so called sister city gardens: * Australian garden – the first “sister city garden”, commenced in 1997, to honour the relation with Gisborne, Victoria. * Japanese garden – the garden that is inspired by the relation with Nonoichi, Ishikawa. * Palm Desert garden – for the third sister city, Palm Desert, California. This garden also holds the Cacti Collection (partly in the Glasshouse). This presentation is part of a collection bequeathed to the city by the late Mr & Mrs J. B. Greig in 1978. Other gardens include: * New Zealand Native Bush garden * Riverside garden Works of art There are some art works, for instance 'Desert Haiku' - a gift from the people of Palm Desert. It was created by Michael Watling in 2001. The andesite boulders from Te Puke represent the mountains around Palm Desert. The composition reflects Gisborne's connection to Japan. The stones take the classic haiku form of five, seven, five. Trees Some important trees in the Gardens are: * Quercus palustris - the pin oak from south east Canada and eastern USA. * Quercus robur - the common oak from Europe. * Platanus acerifolia - the London plane from Europe. * Ginkgo biloba - the maidenhair tree from China. * Ulmus carpinifolia var. variegata or Ulmus minor subsp. minor - the smooth-leaved elm * Cedrus atlantica var. glauca - the blue Atlas cedar * Liriodendron tulipifera - the tulip tree * Araucaria bidwillii - the bunya bunya from Queensland * Araucaria cookii or Araucaria columnaris- Captain Cook's pine from New Caledonia * Tilia x europaea - the Common, or European lime Literature * an. - Gisborne Botanical Gardens, Draft Management Plan.

Unlike most of the rest of the state, its economy has been based on agriculture and livestock, rather than mining, and it is noted for its production of agave and mezcal. The town has been named a Pueblo Mágico to promote a tourism industry. Geography and environment The municipality extends over 886km2, and borders the municipalities of Tepechitlán, Mezquital del Oro, Garcia de la Cadena and Florencia de Benito Juárez with the state of Jalisco to the south and the state of Nayarit to the west. Outside the seat, other important communities include Ignacio Allende with 1,800 residents, Huitzila with 800 and www.milpillas.com with 500. In addition there are sixteen other communities with representation in the municipal government. The municipality has mountains, small mesas, plain and rolling hills with an average altitude of 1940 meters above sea level. The Cerro de Teul is marked by a large cross. The area is part of the Lerma River basin. The municipal seat is at the juncture of two small rivers called the Rio Grande and La Aticuata. Together they form the Tlaltenango River. After joining other rivers to the Lerma, the area drains into the Pacific. Another important river in the area is the Patitos. The municipality contains one dam called the Manuel Caloca with a capacity of 5,000,000 m3 and another called the Ignacio Allende with a capacity of 1,000,000m3. The rest of the municipality has an abundance of fresh water springs which provide most of the potable water. The climate is between semi warm and temperate with an average annual precipitation of between 750 and 800 mm with most rain falling in the summer, especially July. The north is drier than the south. The coldest months are December and January with lows down to 11C with occasional freezing. The warmest months are May and June with highs up to 40C. Much of the area is forested with species such as oak, holm oak, royal pine and “palo colorado”. Fauna includes coyotes, wildcats, white-tailed deer, squirrels, rabbits, various spiders and scorpions, rattlesnakes, coral snakes, and other snakes, eagles, quail, owls, storks, ducks and various other birds. History The name Teúl comes from the Chichimeca phrase teulinchan, which means “dwellings of the gods.” After the Conquest, its name became San Juan Bautista de Teúl, prepending the name of its patron saint. In 1935, the suffix of “de Gonzaléz Ortega” was added. Jesús González Ortega, a governor of Zacatecas and ally of Benito Juárez, lived in the town as a boy, then returned later in life to marry. Little is known of the early inhabitants of the area, but settlements probably go back as far as the first century of the Common Era, according to archeological evidence such as tombs. The Caxcans arrived here around the middle of the 7th century, taking control of the valley from the Nahuas and the Techueshes. They remained the dominant group until the arrival of the Spanish. In 1536 Nuño de Guzmán sent Pedro Almíndez Chirino to the area then followed himself shortly after. Within months the indigenous of the area were conquered and Captain Juan Delgado along with Frair Juan Pacheco founded the modern town. At that pre-Hispanic ceremonial center the friar held a mass in honor of John the Baptist, who became the town’s patron saint. One probable reason for the selection of this saint by the Spanish was the area’s abundance of fresh water springs. At this mass, they baptized the area chieftain and a sister, giving them the names of Juan and Catalina. In 1574, a monastery was founded here. Unlike other small towns in Zacatecas, it was never a mining town, with its economy based on livestock and the making of mezcal from agave. During the colonial period into the 19th century, much of the agriculture was organized into haciendas, but these were dismantled with the Mexican Revolution and the Cristero War, when the town itself was nearly burnt to the ground. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Guadalupe was the original parish church constructed in the late 17th century. The town was formally recognized in 1714 by the Real Audiencia de la Nueva Galicia. At the time of Independence, Teul was a dependency of Tlaltenango, but was separated into its own municipality in 1844. This status was reaffirmed in 1935. In 1986, the municipality adopted a seal on the occasion of the 450th anniversary of the town’s founding. Socioeconomics and culture The economy of the municipality is based on agriculture and livestock. Eighty eight percent of the farmland is worked only during the rainy season, with the rest irrigated. The main crop is corn, followed by beans then sorghum and fava beans. Livestock is mostly cattle followed by pigs. Another important crop is agave, which is used to make mezcal. This liquor is still made by hand, using wood barrels and pits to roast the agave hearts. The municipality has seven registered distilleries making mezcal including El Caxcán, Don Aurelio Lamas and Zacatecano. In addition to the straight mezcal, cream variations in flavors such as strawberry, piña colada, coconut, nut and coffee are produced. The area remains relatively poor, with many families having one or more members living in the United States to work. The state and municipality have worked to develop a tourism industry for Teúl as well, including its naming as a Pueblo Mágico. This rural area maintains many of its traditional religious and secular celebrations, mostly related to local saints. Unlike many places in Mexico, the streets are clear of street vendors, so street food is generally available only during festivals. Local specialties include gordita de horno, a sweet case baked on an oak leaf, and gorditas de arriero, a savory dish filled with refried beans flavored with chile de arbol. Other popular dishes include pipian rojo, tamales with meat and nopal, tortitas de guachal (made with nopales and eggs), and chuales, a kind of baked tamale with beans and piloncillo and birria. Handcrafts include wooden masks, most often used for a traditional dance called Los Morenos in honor of the Holy Cross. Another craft is ceramics, which include pots, plates, storage jars and ladles. They are made with a sand colored clay and glazed.

Structure denotes the components and relations that actually constitute a particular unity [or thing]…” While Maturana and Varela (1987:28) do not pursue a specific discussion about process, they set out to understand the role of cognition as “… the universal nature of doing”. Maturana and Varela are seeking to understand what they term autopoiesis, how living things self–produce. Maturana and Varela (1987:47) claim: “… by realizing what characterizes living beings in their autopoietic organization, we can unify a whole lot of empirical data about their biochemistry and cellular functioning”. In this description we find that structure refers to the component parts that comprise something and organizations refers to the way these parts are assembled (organized). In this way all real things can be described as having an organized structure. The term system can also be used for an organized structure. This idea forms the basis of Maturana and Varela’s idea of autopoiesis (self-production). Capra In The Web of Life, Fritjof Capra (1996:156) synthesized the systems theory literature and, in particular, Maturana and Varela’s contribution, by setting out three criteria for a living system — the pattern of organization, the structure and the life process: * Pattern of organization is the configuration of relationships that determines the systems essential characteristics (Autopoiesis as defined by Maturana and Varela, 1987). * Structure is the physical embodiment of the system’s pattern of organization (Dissipative structures as defined by Prigogine and Stengers, 1987). * Life process is the activity involved in the continual embodiment of the system’s pattern of organization. (Cognition as defined by Gregory Bateson, 1979). While Capra concentrates his discussion on living things, the idea behind the concept of structure–organization–process is one in which a process [self] organizes [its own] structure (autopoieses as defined by Maturana and Varela, 1987). As we can see, the definitions for these three elements are a little confusing. This is why the idea of structure–organization–process (SOP) has been applied more generally by Linda Glassop (2007). Levels At the level of a real thing, SOP describes: * Structure refers to the attributes distinguishing something (trait, value, shape and efficacy). * Organization refers to parts that comprise something: the properties (evident by valued traits), and their relationship (evident by their shape and efficacy). * Process refers to the constitution of parts (the bundle of related properties) that produces a whole thing. In the ontological literature, SOP describes: * Structure refers closed systems (or the attributes of the universe that are independent). * Organization refers to open systems (or the parts of the universe that depend on closed systems). * Process refers to social systems (or the wholes that are inter–dependent on closed and open systems that make up eco–systems, e.g., the universe). In the metaphysics literature, SOP describes: * Structure refers to individual things. * Organization refers to categories of things (clusters of individuals, where a part is a category). * Process refers to universal things (all things, e.g., parts as the set). SOP model The SOP model described by Glassop (2007) opens up a way of looking at anything by considering: # what the thing is composed of (the structures that distinguish it), # how the thing is composed (the organization of the parts), and # that a whole thing is an organized structure (the process of comprising the parts). What we see in this description is that real things are multi–faceted and that each level needs to be considered separate and together. Glassop has utilized this framework to provide a theoretical description for the Periodic Table of Elements and the key features of DNA.

He later became a dancer in the Balinese dance opera group during high school. He finished high school in Denpasar in 1968 and attended Teacher College in Madiun city, East Java. He returned to Bali in 1970 as an apprentice math teacher in a Junior High School. He was married in 1973, and has two sons and two daughters.  Art conservation work President Soeharto presents Upakarti Award to Nyoman Rudana, Dec 1994 Nyoman Rudana, wife, and daughter Friska with The Tree of Humanity Award from the Italian government In 1974, Rudana developed The Rudana Painter Community at the Sanur beach area to help local artists in selling their products. In 1978, he established the Rudana Fine Art Gallery in Ubud aiming to promote Balinese arts to visitors on the island. It was also intended to encourage local artists to develop their individual styles and grow the local art industry. For his work promoting Indonesian arts, The Artists Association of Indonesia presented him with the Lempad Prize in 1985. Concerned that Balinese and Indonesian artistic heritage was being taken overseas, Rudana established Museum Rudana in Peliatan, Gianyar Regency. Its cornerstone was laid on 22 December 1990 with a serial of Balinese ceremony. The museum officially opened in 1995 with the goal of preserving Indonesian arts. On December 14, 1994, Rudana received the Upakarti Award from President Suharto in appreciation for his action in preserving Indonesian arts and his contribution to the development of small-scale industries in Bali. In 1995, Rudana also founded The Rudana Art Foundation to help develop and promote art in Indonesia by sponsoring gifted children in studying art, performance and music. He has also developed other galleries to display Balinese arts, and established the Ksatria Seni Award in 2000, which is presented every four years to individuals or organizations for their dedication to working in arts and culture. In November, 2000, Rudana received L’albero dell’umanita Award (The Tree of Humanity Award) from the Government of Italy as an appreciation for his promoting arts and brotherhood to the world.

It was the first martial arts association to be registered in the country, and is now the biggest and most internationally known Malaysian silat discipline. Gayong is overseen by the Pertubuhan Silat Seni Gayong Malaysia (PSSGM) or the Malaysian Silat Seni Gayong Organisation. This organisation is currently led by Dato' Ismail Jantan.Shamsuddin, S. (2005): The Malay art of self-defense: Silat Seni Gayong (p. 29). Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic. () While it is most popular in Malaysia and Singapore, there are also branches in Vietnam, Australia, France, Kuwait, Tunisia, Britain, and the United States. History Seni Gayong originated among the Bugis people of Sulawesi in Indonesia and was called Silat Sendi Harimau. Literally meaning \\"tiger joint silat\\", the system utilised the tiger claw technique to lock opponents' joints. The Bugis prince Daeng Kuning, descended from a long line of warriors, brought the style to the Malay Peninsula in the 1800s. It was eventually passed down to his great-grandson Meor Abdul Rahman. The teaching of Seni Gayong, as with most styles of silat, was once restricted to relatively few students under each master. In 1942 during the Japanese occupation, Meor Abdul Rahman taught Seni Gayong publicly in Sudong island, Singapore when the locals feared an attack by the Japanese. Having inherited the art from his grandfather; Syed Zainal Abidin Al-Attas, Dato Meor Abdul Rahman eventually founded Malaysia's first martial arts association, Pertubuhan Silat Seni Gayong Malaysia. It was and still remains the method of unarmed combat taught to the Royal Malaysia Police force Training Seni Gayong incorporates strikes, grabs, joint manipulation, and weaponry. Acrobatics are also included but are comparatively less than other styles of silat. The curriculum is divided into the following stages: ;Tapak Gayong The student begins by learning foundation stances and footwork patterns or tapak along with basic punches, kicks, blocks, counterattacks and reversals. ;Seni Tapak Gayong After learning the basic forms of attacking and defending, the student is next taught seizing techniques, takedowns and how to manipulate, lock or strike the opponent's joints. ;Seni Keris Having becoming proficient in unarmed techniques, the student is ready for training with weapons. The first weapons taught include the kris (dagger), pisau (knife), kerambit (claw-like knife), kapak (axe), tekpi (three-pronged truncheon) and sundang (sword). ;Seni Simbat More weapons are introduced, namely the tongkat (staff), simbat (short stick), tembong (long stick), parang (machete), tombak (spear) and lembing (javelin). ;Seni Cindai Flexible weapons are taught. These are traditionally taught last because they require their flexible nature requires the wielder to have great control to use them skillfully. Moreover, many of these weapons would be near useless in the hands of an inexperienced fighter when compared to a more lethal sword or knife. The weapons taught in this component are the tali (rope), cindai (silk scarf or cloth), rantai (chain), and bengkong (cloth belt). ;Seni Yoi Having learned to fight armed and unarmed, the student is now taught fast and nimble movements to dodge or confuse the opponent. This may also include various athletic moves. In the past, this stage was comparable to Chinese qinggong, but today it consists mostly of deceptive attacking techniques. ;Seni Belian Belian is an old Javanese word for a dukun who has died and taken the form of a tiger spirit. This stage focuses on spiritual and internal training. With the rise of Islamic conservatism in Southeast Asia today, esoteric aspects of silat are either downplayed or re-interpreted to fit into modern religious thought. However, the traditional seni belian is based more strongly on indigenous Indonesian kejawen rather than the Muslim faith. Weapons Seni Gayong makes use of a variety of weapons, some of which may not be included in the mandatory syllabus. Trainees begin weapons-training by learning the use of the kris. Other small easily learned weapons follow, before progressing to long weapons and finally the more difficult flexible weapons. Cloth weapons like the chindai and bengkong are considered the most advanced of all weapons. Seni Gayong as taught to the police and special forces may replace some traditional weapons with modern knives, brass knuckles (buku lima) or even firearms for reasons of practicality. The traditional tonfa is retained, however, as its techniques can be applied to the T-baton used in law enforcement. Progression Seni Gayong adopts the modern Japanese coloured belt system to indicate students' progress. The bengkong or waist sash is used for this purpose, and the passing of a test is required before a student can progress to the next stage. Trainees under the age of 12 go through separate stages than older students. These are as follows: ;Adult (above 12 years old) 01\\\\. Hitam Mulus (black) 02\\\\. Awan Putih (white) 03\\\\. Pelangi Hijau (green) 04\\\\. Pelangi Merah (red) 05\\\\. Pelangi Merah Cula I (red with 1 yellow stripe) 06\\\\. Pelangi Merah Cula II (red with 2 yellow stripes) 07\\\\.

He has been British jump racing Champion Trainer six times. Background His father was Johnny Henderson who was one of the founders of the Racecourse Holdings Trust as well as earlier in life being Aide-de-camp to Field Marshal Montgomery. In 2005 two years after Johnny Henderson's death Cheltenham renamed one of the races at the Cheltenham Festival in his honour as the Johnny Henderson Grand Annual Chase. In 2006 Nicky Henderson won this race with a horse called Greenhope. Henderson, educated at Eton College, has been a trainer since 1978, based at Seven Barrows near Lambourn, Berkshire. Previously he was an amateur jockey, and assistant trainer to Fred Winter between 1974 and 1978. Achievements His most notable successes have come with See You Then, winner of the Champion Hurdle in 1985, 1986 and 1987; Remittance Man, winner of the Queen Mother Champion Chase in 1992; Punjabi, winner of the Smurfit Kappa Champion Hurdle in 2009 at the Cheltenham Festival, Binocular, winner of the 2010 Champion Hurdle, Long Run, winner of the 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup and Bobs Worth, winner of the 2013 Cheltenham Gold Cup. Binocular's Champion Hurdle gave Henderson a fifth win in the race, equalling the record held by Peter Easterby. Zaynar, another horse he trained, also won at the 2009 Cheltenham Festival in the Triumph Hurdle. He was Champion Trainer in the 1985/86 and 1986/87 seasons. His record at the Cheltenham Festival is particularly good and amongst currently active trainer only Willie Mullins has won more races at the Festival than Henderson. His main stable jockey was Mick Fitzgerald until Fitzgerald was forced to retire by an injury sustained in the 2008 Grand National; from the 2008–09 season until the 2014–15 season Barry Geraghty was Henderson's principal jockey in Britain. At the start of the 2015–16 season Nico de Boinville became Henderson's principal jockey after Geraghty replaced Tony McCoy as the principal jockey of J P McManus. One of Henderson's most popular horses in recent years, Caracciola, won the Cesarewitch Handicap flat race at Newmarket in 2008 at odds of 50/1 as an 11-year-old, despite mainly being a National Hunt horse. Caracciola followed up this success by winning the Queen Alexandra Stakes at Royal Ascot in 2009 as a 12-year-old with Eddie Ahern riding on both occasions. Henderson claimed his second winner at the famous Royal Ascot meeting when Veiled won the 2011 Ascot Stakes at 11/2. In 2013 Henderson had another important win with his horse Bob's Worth (Bought for only £20,000) continuing his unbeaten streak at Cheltenham with a win in the Gold Cup. This was despite Henderson raising concerns about the suitablily of the soft ground before the race started. Henderson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to horse racing. Controversy In June 2009, Henderson was found guilty by a British Horseracing Authority panel of breaching the rules of racing, after Moonlit Path, a mare he trains for the Queen, failed a drugs test. Henderson admitted to three of the four charges he faced in relation to the case, in which a prohibited anti-bleeding drug was found in the horse's bloodstream. Henderson accepted that the drug should not have been administered, but argued that it had been done so for the horse's welfare, and that he had not been attempting to enhance performance. A further hearing was held in July 2009 to determine the sanction to be applied, and Henderson was fined £40,000 (a record penalty for the sport in the UK) and banned from running horses for three months (11 July to 10 October 2009). However, as Henderson is primarily a jumps trainer and this ban was during the flat season it caused him little inconvenience. He was allowed to continue training during the \\"ban\\" (which could more accurately be described as a suspension rather than a ban) but was not allowed to enter horses for the period of his ban. The majority of his flat horses were sent to his friend and fellow Lambourn trainer Barry Hills, highest profile of these horses being Caracciola. He caused a little controversy when he attended Royal Ascot when the horse ran but was not breaking any rules as he had not been \\"warned off\\" and he was a guest of Barry Hills.

They were characterised by a pressed steel frame and alloy overhead cam, twin-cylinder engine, and were very well equipped, with 12 volt electrics, electric starter, indicators, dual seats and other advanced features not common to most motorcycles of the period. History These bikes started out as the Honda C70 Dream. Soichiro Honda had dubbed many of his earlier bikes 'Dream' after his dream of building complete motorcycles. =1950s= The C70 was a 250cc pressed-frame motorcycle, with a very similar frame to later machines, released in 1956. It was usually seen with a single seat and rack, with clip-on pillion pad. The C75 was the 305cc version of the C70. It had a square head-light and shock absorbers, leading link forks, pressed-steel handlebars and were somewhat unusual in appearance. The engine was dry sumped, and had six-volt electrics. The design of both the frame and engine was heavily influenced by bikes built by NSU Motorenwerke AG, which Soichiro Honda had seen on his visit to Europe in 1955, including the Isle of Man TT races. The C71 and C76 were later developments, from 1957 or 1958 onwards. The C71 was the 250cc bike, while the C76 was 305cc. Not much had changed visually, but they were fitted with electric starters. Dual seats were common on export bikes, but the single seat/rack combination was available. They were exported to Europe and the US, and other markets. A C71 was shown in the Netherlands in 1958, and shown at the Earls Court show in either 1958 or 1959, while the C76 became the flagship bike for the Honda range released into the US in 1959. There was a version specifically built for the US market called the CA76, which came equipped with conventional tubular handlebars, although the standard pressed-steel bar C71 and C76 were also sold in the US. In the end, only a small handful were exported around the world. These were the first of the Honda 'Dreams' sold outside Japan. Also available was the 'Dream Sport' bikes with high exhaust pipes, the CS71/CS76 and CSA71/CSA76. All sold well in their home market, and have attained cult-status amongst Japanese collectors. The CE71 Dream Sport is a closely related version, and very rare. The dry-sumped engine, in the same pressed frame, with tubular handlebars, low sports exhaust pipes and dual seat, with an angular fuel tank similar to the CB92. They were exported to the US and Europe. Just over 400 were made and they were all recalled, with most scrapped. Another rare version was the CB71 – another sports version of the dry sump bikes. It was only available in Japan, and it only in limited numbers. It was very reminiscent of the CB92 – pressed frame, flat 'ace' handlebars, fly screen, low megaphone exhaustpipes, cut down rear mudguard, cycle-style front guard, angular fueltank with the 'wrap-over' rubber kneepad of the CB92. =1960s= The final development of these bikes, the C72/C77, was available from 1960. A 1960 C72/C77 would be a very rare bike; most came out in 1961. The American market CA72/CA77 was available in 1961. These bikes were made until 1967, although it seems that because of the way US bikes are dated, many are referred to in the US as 1968 or even 1969 models. These bikes saw a completely redesigned engine: a wet-sump design with many internal differences, essentially a new motor, with electric start and 12v system. The C72 and C77 had pressed steel handlebars, while the CA72 and CA77 had high tubular bars. Beyond that there were only minor differences, different indicators were fitted to the non-US bikes to suit the countries laws. Bikes built up to 1963 had a different fuel tank shape to later bikes, and the pressed steel bars were discontinued at about the same time (all models using conventional tubular bars) but otherwise the bike stayed much the same for the rest of its run. There was also a version of the bike called the C78/CA78, but visually there were no substantial differences to the C77/CA77. Pre-1963 CA77s were considered as well-equipped touring/commuter bikes — not particularly sporting, but reliable and comfortable, with a turn of speed much better than many larger-capacity bikes. Like the earlier dry-sump bikes, there were high- exhaust sports version, the CS72 and CS77, and the corresponding American market CSA72 and CSA77. The C72/C77 was exported to Europe, Britain, Australia and other markets, and sold in some numbers, although as it was comparatively expensive, not as well as hoped. Post-WW2 anti-Japanese sentiment was still rife, and in the UK, manufacturers like BSA and Triumph attempted to convince dealers not to sell Japanese bikes. Also, the style was considered to be somewhat unusual to European eyes, and by the mid-1960s quite old-fashioned. Legacy and influence A re-development of the engine was used in the seminal CB72 and its 305cc cousin, the CB77, both of which were ground- breaking sports motorcycles of their day. The CL72 and CL77 Scramblers also used the same engines. In addition, the engine was studied, and developed and enlarged by the Laverda factory as the basis of their 650cc and 750cc twin cylinder engines. These days, these Honda models are considered collectibles, and have a strong following in the Vintage Japanese Motorcycle Club.

At the site, the ruins of stone walls, a stone-lined well, and a historical signboard can be found. The castle was named after Kannonsho-ji, a Buddhist temple near the peak of the mountain. History Old map of the castle During the Sengoku period, the Sasaki (佐々木) family (or Rokkaku clan) was appointed constabulary authority over Ōmi and other nearby provinces by the Ashikaga shogunate in Kyoto. A castle was needed as an administrative center and military rallying point. The ridged peak of Kinugasa Mountain, where Kannonsho-ji was already, was selected as the new site. A castle from that lofty position would command a view of the plains below and would serve as a symbol of power in the region. Construction was completed in 1468; it was originally named Sasaki Castle. Sasaki (now Kannonji) Castle was intended to defend Ōmi Province and was the base-castle of the Rokkaku clan. It was attacked and taken not long after construction during the Ōnin War (1467–77). Renovations were done during the Kōji Era (1555–1558), and the stone ramparts were enlarged to accommodate small cannons. In 1568, Oda Nobunaga was escorting Ashikaga Yoshiaki to Kyoto to install him as shōgun. As the expedition crossed through the area, Rokkaku forces, loyal to the Ashikaga shōgun, left their stronghold to disrupt or arrest their advance. Nobunaga forces led by Niwa Nagahide defeated the Rokkaku on the battlefield and entered Kannonji Castle unopposed and in triumph, before resuming his march to Kyoto. The Rokkaku clan continued to use Kannonji Castle as a base castle until their worst defeat in 1570 by Shibata Katsuie. It is thought that the castle was abandoned sometime afterward. In 1582 Kannonji Castle was attacked and burned, along with Azuchi Castle, possibly at the hands of looters from among the local peasantry. In 1969 and 1970, artifacts were discovered during archaeological excavations in the main courtyard (hon-maru). Significance Kannonji Castle is regarded as among Japan's Five Greatest Mountain Castles, along with Kasugayama Castle, Nanao Castle, Odani Castle and Gassantoda Castle. Access If hiking, the trail head that leads up the west side of Kinugasa Mountain (433m) is about a 25-minute walk from Azuchi Station, or about 10 minutes from the nearby Azuchi Castle Archaeology Museum and the Nobunaga Hall. The trail leads up the west side of the mountain, first to the ancient temple Kuwanomi-dera (), then through a forest of Japanese cedars, and up to Kannonji Castle site. From the main courtyard, there is a trail leading on to Kannonsho-ji, a temple with an impressive panoramic view. If driving, there are two roads that lead up the mountain. One follows a spur on the southwest slope and is accessed near the Nakasendō Highway (Japan National Route 8) in Azuchi. The other leads up the eastern slope, and can be found near Route 202 off the Nakasendō Highway in the neighboring town of Gokashō. Both roads lead to Kannonsho-ji, a few minutes' walk from Kannonji Castle ruins.

He is chiefly remembered for helping edit for publication Austin Tappan Wright’s Utopian novel Islandia, and for his own three sequels to Wright's work. Life Saxton was born November 28, 1914 in Mineola, Long Island, New York, the son of Eugene F. Saxton, vice president, secretary and head of the editorial department of Harper & Brothers, and Martha (Plaisted) Saxton, an editor and school teacher. He had one brother, Alexander Saxton, also a novelist and notable historian. Mark grew up in New York City, where his father worked, and later attended Harvard College, from which he graduated in 1936. As an adult he lived in both New York and Mill River, Massachusetts. He married Josephine Stocking; the couple had two children, Russell Steele Saxton and Martha Porter Saxton. Mark Saxton died at his home in New York City from an apparent heart attack at the age of 73 on Thursday, January 7, 1988. He was survived by his children Russell and Martha, his wife having predeceased him by many years. Career From the late 1930s to the early 1940s Saxton was a book editor and advertising manager in New York City for Farrar & Rinehart, which also published his first three novels. During this time he worked with Sylvia Wright to prepare her late father's novel Islandia for publication. The firm published the book in 1942, but Saxton's fascination with the work would be lifelong. Meanwhile, his editorial career was interrupted by service in the Navy during World War II. After his discharge in 1946 he worked as an editor at William Sloane Associates, McGraw-Hill’s Whittlesey House division, and the Harvard University Press, which he left in 1969. Afterwards he was one of the founders of the Gambit, Inc. publishing firm in Boston. From 1980 onward he was a freelance editor in New York. Works Saxton’s first novel was Danger Road (1939); it and the two that followed were written during his employment with Farrar & Rinehart, and were published by that firm. A fourth, Prepared for Rage (1947), was also issued by the publisher he worked for at the time, in this instance William Sloane Associates. A long interval passed before Saxton’s next book, Paper Chase (1964), which has the distinction of not being the work that served as the basis for the later movie and television series (that honor goes to John Jay Osborn, Jr.’s similarly titled The Paper Chase (1970). In his later years Saxton returned to Wright’s Islandia for his inspiration, and with the permission of the estate set his last three novels in that fictional Utopian realm. It is for these that he is chiefly remembered. The first, The Islar (1969), is a modern-day sequel to the original novel. The others, The Two Kingdoms (1979) and Havoc in Islandia (1982), take place much earlier in the kingdom’s history. All three draw on Wright’s extensive background notes. Houghton Mifflin was the publisher of Saxton’s Islandian novels.

It was established in 1996 to: * develop strategies for the prevention and remediation of reading disabilities * search for strategies that will lead to the improvement of remedial processes * provide educators and parents with current and appropriate knowledge regarding reading/learning disabilities * provide interdisciplinary evaluations of readers of all ages * promote the concerns relevant to reading disabilities * educate the general public regarding issues pertaining to reading/learning disabilities  Programs offered at the Center for READing  =Identification and Intervention Program= The Identification and Intervention Program (IIP) is based on two decades worth of research and is the oldest of the programs offered at the CARRD. The purpose of the IIP is to identify children who are at-risk of developing a reading disability, also referred to as dyslexia, as soon as possible and then to provide those children with an appropriate remediation that will help them gain the fundamental skills needed to become competent readers. The IIP is used in school systems. It identifies students in the beginning of first grade who are at-risk of developing reading difficulties and then provides them with a research-based reading tutoring program. =After School and Summer Program= The After School and Summer Program (ASSP) provides individuals with one-on-one remedial phonological and reading instruction. The ASSP serves individuals from four years of age through adult. The first step of the ASSP is assessment. The individual is assessed in order to determine specific strengths and weaknesses in regards to basic phonological processing skills. Attentional abilities are also assessed in order to determine if attentional difficulties may be compounding the issue. Once the assessment is complete and the results are analyzed by the CARRD, a training program is constructed to aid the individual in improving deficient skills. The training program typically involves twice weekly tutoring sessions. For school-aged children, utilizing the ASSP during the summer can be a great opportunity for the student to enhance phonological processing and reading skills during a time that students typically make minimal academic gains. One of the main goals of the ASSP is to help individuals gain phonological awareness. The program aims to close the gap between students who are weak in phonological processing and reading skills and those who are excellent readers. In addition to one-on-one tutoring through the ASSP, parents are encouraged to assist their children at home by practicing skill-building exercises together. =On-line Reading Screening= The Reading Screening is a web-based evaluation used to identify children between the ages of 5 and 12 years who are at-risk for developing or are currently experiencing reading difficulties. The Reading Screening has been used in school systems for the past 15 years and is now available online to parents, teachers, and other professionals. With 15-20% of our nation's children experiencing reading problems or dyslexia, the best way to help is to begin to understand the nature of the individual’s reading difficulties. The Reading Screening provides understanding by identifying the child’s strengths and weaknesses with regard to reading. Once the assessment has been completed, the website generates a Summary of Assessment, which outlines the areas of reading that are creating the most difficulties for the child. The Summary of Assessment report can be shared with school personnel to plan an appropriate intervention, if intervention is necessary. Problem, Impact and Philosophy =Problem= Estimates show that approximately 15 to 20% of our nation's children have reading difficulties. These children have the ability to learn to read, but have a specific skill deficit that prevents them from accomplishing this important task. Research indicates that most reading disabled children have a deficiency in phonological processing skills. The IIP was designed to identify and remediate this deficit before it handicaps the child's ability to learn to read. =Impact= The IIP is geared toward children who have the intellectual ability to learn to read, but find the process very difficult or impossible. Children with reading difficulties are at-risk for dropping out of school, parental abuse, poor self-esteem, and are more likely to find their way into the welfare and criminal justice systems. The future of a child with reading difficulties seems to be fairly bleak in our service-oriented society. To be successful in our society, one must not only know how to read, but also do it fairly well. The vast majority of children with learning disabilities have reading disabilities as their major deficiency. In fact, many children who are considered learning disabled because of other obstacles also have reading difficulties. In addition, as a member of our ever increasingly complex society, a society in which employment requires literacy, a student who does not graduate from high school, and who has poor reading skills, is likely to be doomed to extremely poor economic realities. The eventual cost to society for what might be a preventable difficulty is high. It is imperative that we begin using scientifically generated programs to remediate educational problems. Through the Center for READing, beginning first graders in the Pittsburg, Kansas area are assessed with the 'IIP' and are then provided with the intervention designed to eliminate the barriers that are preventing them from becoming good readers. The impact of the 'IIP' on improving the phonological processing skills of children at-risk for reading disabilities is far reaching. It may be possible to prevent thousands of children from ever experiencing learning and reading disabilities. Although the prevention of learning and reading disabilities is important in its own right, several social problems mentioned above may also be prevented in the process. =Philosophy= As mentioned above, individuals who use the ASSP are initially provided with an assessment. This assessment includes the Reading Screening, an assessment of intelligence (IQ test), an attentional assessment (including both a parent check-list and the TOVA test), an auditory screening, and information concerning the individual's medical, developmental, and educational history. When assessing reading difficulties, it is imperative that the individual receive evaluation in not only reading skills, but also attentional abilities. An individual who is experiencing reading difficulties may be hampered by an attentional difficulty such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is also true that an individual who displays behaviors consistent with ADHD might actually be experiencing reading difficulties. As an example, a student learning to read must use considerable cognitive resources and effort to decode print. If that child has poor phonological processing skills and is deficient in decoding, their behavior might look like ADHD when they in fact have reading difficulties. On the other hand, a student with ADHD might not be able to use cognitive resources to decode print due to ADHD. As a result, their behavior might resemble reading difficulties when the true deficiency is ADHD. An individual being assessed at the CARRD is assessed on several dimensions to gain complete understanding of the individual's strengths and weaknesses. Further reading Fehrenbach, L. A., Hurford, D.

The film is directed by A. Razak Mohaideen and produced by KRU Films (now known as KRU Studios) in association with Grand Brilliance Sdn Bhd and Line Clear Motion Pictures. It stars Saiful Apek as a kind-hearted man who encounters a mermaid, portrayed by Maya Karin. Synopsis Tells a young man named Jimmy who has a habit since childhood where he likes to keep the environment clean. Jimmy also had a strange attitude that all villagers did not like the odd attitude. Jimmy loves being friends with Orix's \\"big foot\\" species. As a man who has feelings, Jimmy puts his mind on Aspalela's son to Tok Mudim village, as well as Aspalela. One day, Jimmy went to Tok Mudim's house to host Aspalela but opposed to Tok Mudim's macro Jimmy to have his own land if he wanted to marry his son. Finally jimmy with a bizarre idea and waste, he can make his own land but it is strange to him every time he wakes up all the trees become big and eventually the land becomes wide. It may have been Aspalela who helped him for his support. But after Jimmy had his own land Wak Pagek did not even accept it and was humiliated. The most successful young man in the corps was also a great way to marry Aspalela. The cord also hates Jimmy for always stopping him from catching fish. Jimmy's jugging cord cut Jimmy and married a mermaid alone and eventually fought so much that some of it was crashing. Jimmy then repaired the island so much that the mermaids were caught in the rope. Finally, Jimmy and mermaids are good friends so Jimmy becomes a rich man from the gold award rather than a mermaid. Kordi feels bent and tries to investigate and eventually he can catch a mermaid.  Plot  The story is set on the east coast of Sabah. Jimmy (Saiful Apek) is a young man who spends his days cleaning the rubbish in the sea village that he lives. He refuses to do any work other than caring for the environment, which makes him an outcast and laughing stock among the villagers. His only friend is Orix (Yassin Yahya). Jimmy wants to marry his childhood sweetheart, Aspalela (Yasmin Hani), who returns his feelings. He asks Aspalela's father, Wan Pagek, for Aspalela's hand in marriage, but Wan Pagek declares that he has to have land of his own before he can marry her. Jimmy builds a floating island out of discarded rubbish, on which he builds a small hut. This amuses Wan Pagek and displeases Kordi (Awie), another man who wants to marry Aspalela. One night, Jimmy is woken up by a mermaid named Puteri (Maya Karin). She explains that she has been watching Jimmy for some time, and to show her appreciation for Jimmy's efforts in cleaning the village, she has been helping fortify his floating island. Jimmy boasts to the entire village that he has met a mermaid, but when Puteri refuses to surface when called, Jimmy is declared a crazy liar and disowned by his father. When Puteri returns to visit Jimmy, she reminds him that their friendship is supposed to be a secret. She takes him to her home in an underwater cave, which is filled with pirate's treasure. Puteri explains that she is lonely, and has developed feelings for Jimmy. However, Jimmy explains that he is in love with Aspalela, but he cannot marry her because he has no money. Puteri offers to give her treasure to him, but he turns it down. After Jimmy returns to his floating island, he wakes up the next morning and finds that Puteri has left two boxes of treasure for him. Jimmy flaunts his newfound wealth and gains the favour of all the villagers and Aspalela's father. Kordi is suspicious of Jimmy's good fortune and goes to his island, where he captures Puteri. He places her in a cage and charges the villagers money to see her. Jimmy's father sees the mermaid and realises that his son isn't crazy. Jimmy, Orix, Aspalela, Jimmy's parents and Aspalela's parents work together to free Puteri. After getting away from Kordi, Puteri wishes Jimmy happiness with Aspalela, and swims off into the ocean. In an epilogue set three years later, Jimmy and Aspalela are married, Kordi is working for them, the village is prosperous, and the villagers work for Jimmy in monitoring the environment. Jimmy explains in voice-over that he has not seen Puteri since their goodbye and doesn't expect to see her ever again. Puteri is briefly shown secretly visiting the village with a merman by her side.

Nearly 40 percent of the seasons involve the seafloor and the rest still do not run out of the sea. [6] Shooting takes 25 days in Sipadan Island, Sabah. Maya Karin did all the rounds in the sea without the help of multiple stunt techniques. [7] The publishing company, Grand Brilliance Sdn Bhd targets a collection of RM10 million with a screening of 59 theaters across Malaysia, the largest number in the history of Malay movie. [8] However, other filmmakers described the target as impossible as Saiful Apek's comedic habits and CGI's not so attractive. Promotion The movie sponsor, DiGi, spent RM1.5 million for promotional purposes. Various contests for free Duyung tickets are also held. 1 minute trailers in Malay and English are distributed alongside 30 and 10 promotional clips while also in Malay and English have been aired on television Reception Despite being screened during the election day, fearing to dump the visit to the cinema, however, during the first week of the show, Duyung filed RM2.7 million, ranked second on the weekly best-selling movie charts in Malaysian cinemas that week, only trailing 10,000 B.C Criticism Although the director of the film, A. Razak Mohaideen wants to get out of the habit of his earlier films that have got great criticism, the movie Duyung is said to be still not running away from the typical film director. The construction of the character is said to be very synonymous with non films and easy storyline and light comedy still used.

A member of the Progressive Conservative party and former cabinet minister (holding the positions of Minister without Portfolio in charge of Children's Services, Associate Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, and Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development). Calahasen was the first Métis woman elected to public office in Alberta, and after the 2012 Alberta election, she was Alberta's longest currently-serving MLA. Early life Calahasen was born in 1952 and raised in Grouard, Alberta. She attended the University of Alberta, from which she received a Bachelor of Education, and the University of Oregon, from which she received a master's degree. Political career =Electoral record= Calahasen first sought election in the 1989 Alberta election, when she ran as the Progressive Conservative candidates in the riding of Lesser Slave Lake. She won a plurality of votes, capturing 47.6% and defeating her nearest rival, Liberal Denise Wahlstrom, by nearly one thousand votes. This was the closest election of her political career to date; in subsequent elections, she won shares of the votes ranging from 55.5% (in the 1993 election) to 74.2% (in the 2001 election). At the time of her election in 1989, Calahasen was the first Métis woman elected to public office in Alberta. =Cabinet roles= Calahasen served as a backbencher in Ralph Klein's government until 1996, when Klein appointed her Minister without Portfolio responsible for Children's Services. She served in this capacity until 1999, when she was shuffled to the position of Associate Minister of Aboriginal Affairs. In 2001 she was promoted to full minister, of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. Calahasen initially supported Lyle Oberg in the 2006 P.C. leadership election, but switched her endorsement to Ed Stelmach after Oberg dropped off the ballot; despite this support, she was not included in Stelmach's cabinet once he became premier in 2006. =Legislative initiatives= Calahasen has sponsored a number of bills over her career in the legislature. As a backbencher Despite not being a member of cabinet, in 1990, Calahasen sponsored the Metis Settlements Act, a government bill which incorporated Métis settlements as a new class of municipality. It passed with the support of the opposition, although New Democrat Bob Hawkesworth expressed concern that the settlements were not given sufficient autonomy from government. The same year, she sponsored the Nechi Community College Act, a private bill that would have established the Nechi Community College but did not reach second reading. In 1995, Calahasen sponsored the Colin Chor Wee Chew Legal Articles Act, another private bill which didn't progress to second reading. She also sponsored the Public Health Amendment Act, designed to allow nurse practitioners to fulfill some of the functions of doctors in communities in which doctors were in short supply. The bill passed with the support of the opposition Liberals, but some members, including Terry Kirkland, Colleen Soetaert, Percy Wickman, Gary Dickson, Lance White, and Howard Sapers, argued that the bill left out too many details and left the details in the realm of legislation, inappropriately empowering bureaucrats at the expense of the legislature. As a minister As Associate Minister of Aboriginal Affairs, Calahasen sponsored the First Nations Sacred Ceremonial Objects Repatriation Act, a 2000 government bill that allowed for the repatriation of first nations artifacts. It passed with full opposition support.

At one point, the mountain was topped with the original Komakiyama Castle, built by Oda Nobunaga. Its base stretches for nearly from east to west, and from north to south, covering an area of approximately . The mountain is now a historical park, containing various castle ruins, including water wells and stone walls, in addition to artifacts dating further back. Though known for the sakura trees, the northern part of the mountain is home to many machilus thunbergii trees. This is the only spot in the surrounding area where these trees occur naturally. The reproduction of Komakiyama Castle was built in 1967 and houses the Komaki City Historical Museum. Mount Komakiyama Castle ' was a Sengoku period yamashiro-style Japanese castle located in what is now part of the city of Komaki, Aichi prefecture. It was built by the warlord Oda Nobunaga to facilitate his conquest of Mino Province, later reused by Tokugawa Ieyasu is his struggle for hegemony over Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1927. =Background= Komakiyama Castle is located on Mount Komaki, an isolated high hill in the center of the Nōbi Plain in central Owari Province. The isolation of the location meant that the castle had a good view in all directions. The castle consisted of many terrances on a steep hillside, protected by stone walls and dry moats, with the inner bailey on the summit, crowned by a donjon. = History = After Oda Nobunaga defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto at the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, securing his eastern borders, he turned his attention to the conquest of Mino Province to the north. He built a castle on Mount Komaki in 1563 as his base of operations due to its proximity to the middle and eastern areas of Mino. Nobunaga succeeded in securing Mino by 1567 and transferred his seat to Inabayama Castle (the future Gifu Castle) in 1567 and then turned his attention to the conquest of the Kansai region to the west, abandoning Komakiyama Castle. After Nobunaga's assassination in 1582, conflict arose between his son Oda Nobukatsu and his leading general Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Nobukatsu allied with Tokugawa Ieyasu and seized Owari province, while Hideyoshi held on to Mino Province. Hideyoshi's general Ikeda Tsuneoki crossed the Kiso River and occupied Inuyama Castle. To counter this move, Tokugawa Ieyasu occupied and expanded the vacant Komakiyama Castle. Both sides clashed in a series of largely inconclusive battles known collectively as the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute. The stalemate ended when Ieyasu decided to submit to Hideyoshi, which resulted in his withdrawal to Mikawa Province, and Komakiyama Castle was once again abandoned. In the Edo period, Owari Province came back under the control of the Tokugawa clan, and Komakiyama Castle was retained by Owari Domain as a secondary fortification for use in emergencies, as it retained the shape of its original fortifications. After the Meiji restoration, these fortifications were largely in ruins. The site was donated by the Tokugawa family to the local government in 1930 and became a park. A faux donjon was recreated on the summit in 1967 and renovated in 2006. The building was modeled after the Hiunkaku Pavilion of the temple of Nishi Hongan-ji in Kyoto and is thus not a historically accurate reconstruction. It houses the Komaki City Historical Museum with examples of samurai armor, Japanese swords and early firearms, roof tiles, and other artifacts uncovered during excavations in the castle grounds. The site is a 20 minutes walk from Meitetsu Komaki Line Komaki Station.

It was the first railroad station in the world to have electrified passenger trains when it opened on September 1, 1896, serving the B&O;'s famed Royal Blue line. Following its closure as a railroad station in 1961, it became part of the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) in an acclaimed adaptation preserving the building's original architectural features. The building is now used for MICA art studios. B&O; history =Construction= Mount Royal Station, March 1960 Designed by Baltimore architect E. Francis Baldwin in a blend of modified Romanesque and Renaissance styling, the station was constructed in 1896 by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) as part of its massive Baltimore Belt Line improvement project for its New York passenger service. Located at the north end of the B&O;'s Howard Street tunnel, the station was built of Maryland granite trimmed with Indiana limestone, with a red tile roof and landmark clocktower. The station's interior featured marble mosaic flooring, a fireplace, and rocking chairs. It opened to the public on September 1, 1896. \\"It was considered,\\" said the Baltimore Sun, \\"the most splendid station in the country built and used by only one railroad.\\" That evaluation was shared by railroad historian Lucius Beebe, who proclaimed Mount Royal \\"one of the celebrated railroad stations of the world, ranking in renown with Euston Station, London, scene of so many of Sherlock Holmes' departures, the Gare du Nord in Paris, and the feudal fortress of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Broad Street, Philadelphia.\\" =Train operations= The station's interior in 1958 The B&O; pioneered the first U.S. mainline railway electrification system at Mount Royal Station when it opened in 1896, installing an overhead third rail system in the station's trainshed and its tunnel approaches. The most famous train associated with the Mount Royal Station was the Royal Blue, which ran between Washington, D.C. and New York City. Luminaries using the B&O;'s station over the years include U.S. Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, along with Western showman \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody, singer Enrico Caruso, and celebrated conductor Arturo Toscanini, whose private Pullman car was parked on a siding during his appearances at the nearby Lyric Theatre. After the B&O; ended all passenger service north of Baltimore on April 26, 1958, Mount Royal Station became the eastern terminus of B&O;'s passenger trains. It was one of thirteen Baltimore buildings selected in 1959 for the Historic American Buildings Survey. On June 30, 1961, the B&O; consolidated its Baltimore passenger train service at Camden Station, permanently ending its use of Mount Royal Station after 65 years of operation. Art studio conversion The vacant railroad station building, train shed, and the surrounding 3¼ acres were subsequently acquired by the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) in 1964 for $250,000. The sale amount was far below market value and represented \\"a substantial donation on the part of the B&O;\\", said MICA officials. After $1 million was raised by MICA for the project, the station was converted for use by art students in 1967 at a final cost of $18 per square foot of building space, which was considerably less than the estimated cost for a new building of $25 per square foot. The former B&O; baggage room and platform areas were enclosed for use as studios and the station's exterior and clock tower were retained. The original long iron trainshed remains over CSX Transportation's active mainline tracks. This adaptive reuse preserved the Mount Royal Station as an example of late 19th century industrial architecture, using it for a purpose different from its original one. Design work for the conversion was performed by Richard Donkervoet of Cochran, Stephenson and Donkervoet. Donkervoet retained as much of the building's exterior appearance as possible, and also preserved much of the interior character, including the vaulted ceilings, columns, and mosaic floor. Architectural Forum recognized the station renovation for \\"sensitivity by later architects to the initial conception by the original,\\" and Margaret Mead, in a lecture given at the station, commented that the renovation \\"is perhaps the most magnificent example in the Western World of something being made into something else\\". A CSX Transportation train under the trainshed in 2009 On December 8, 1976, the station was added to the register of National Historic Landmarks, granting it full protection as an historic site. The Mount Royal Station's train shed, one of the country's last remaining such structures, was renovated in 1985 due to advanced deterioration of the shed's materials. In 1992, the AIA's Baltimore chapter honored the Maryland Institute and architects Cochran, Stevenson & Donkervoet with a 25 Year Award for Excellence in Design of Enduring Significance for their adaptive reuse of the former train depot. Between 2005–2007, MICA accomplished a two-phased, $6.3 million renovation of the building by the architectural firm of Grieves, Worrall, Wright & O’Hatnick, Inc. The first phase, renovation of the interior, was completed in Fall, 2005: interior finishes, such as the mosaic tile flooring, marble columns, tin ceilings, wood wainscot, and trim were cleaned and restored. Classroom space was also increased, as well as the quality and quantity of studio space. The second phase, restoration of the building's exterior and train shed, was completed in Spring, 2007: stonework and wood were cleaned, repaired, and repainted, the slate canopy restored, and the drainage system fixed; clerestory and structural timbers in the train shed were replaced and the steel roof framing was reinforced. In keeping with the pedestrian landscaping and streetscape that MICA has created along Mount Royal Avenue, a new plaza with benches, bike racks, shrubs, and ornamental grasses and ground cover was added. The Station Building, as it is now called by MICA, houses the undergraduate departments of fiber and interdisciplinary sculpture, 3-D classrooms, and the Rinehart School of Sculpture, as well as senior studios.

Sacred to local Māori, it has the clearest natural fresh water in the world. Description The Blue Lake is drained by the west branch of the Sabine River, which is part of the Buller River system. It is fed by a short upper segment of the Sabine, which in turn is fed by underground seepage through the landslide debris impounding the much larger Lake Constance. Blue Lake is roughly boomerang shaped, running north then northwest, with each arm of the lake stretching some . Its waters are cold, ranging from . =Clarity= The lake has extremely clear water, and is the clearest natural body of fresh water yet reported. A 2011 study found its visibility ranged from , clearer than the measured for Te Waikoropupu Springs, a previous record holder. For comparison, laboratory measurements show distilled water has a visibility of approximately . Scientists attribute the lake water's clarity to its passage underground from Lake Constance, which filters out nearly all the particles suspended in the water. Its clarity reveals water's natural blue-violet colour. Facilities and access Blue Lake is most often reached as a side trip from the Travers-Sabine Circuit, although a marked route to the south, over the Waiau Pass and another to the West, via Moss Pass continues beyond the lake. The nearby Blue Lake Hut, with 16 bunks, provides accommodation for more than 700 trampers each year. Māori history The algae and plant life in the lake make it look blue and green Blue Lake lies within the rohe (tribal area) of Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō. As part of the iwi's 2010 treaty settlement, the lake passed into tribal ownership and was then given back to the Crown. The lake was traditionally used in ceremonies to cleanse the bones and release the spirits of the dead, so they could begin their journey to Hawaiki, and the iwi regard its waters as tapu (sacred). (Blue Lake was used only for males; Lake Constance was used for females.) Its Māori name, Rotomairewhenua, means \\"the lake of peaceful lands\\". In August 2014, the official name for Blue Lake was altered to Rotomairewhenua / Blue Lake, following the Ngāti Apa ki te Rā Tō treaty settlement with the Crown.

It was formerly located in a building shared with the Sahara West Library branch of the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District in Las Vegas, NV. The Las Vegas Art Museum was \\"dedicated to engaging visitors in the international culture of contemporary art.\\" The museum provided the public with publications, lectures, educational and outreach programs. It also developed a significant permanent collection of contemporary art.  History  LVAM was the first fine-arts museum in southern Nevada. Like most 58-year-old organizations in Southern Nevada, what is now the Las Vegas Art Museum came from humble beginnings. In 1950, a group of visionaries created the Las Vegas Art League with the intention of bringing fine art to the city. The Art League moved into a portion of a ranch house at Lorenzi Park which was purchased by the City of Las Vegas in 1949. In 1974, the Las Vegas Art League changed its name to Las Vegas Art Museum (LVAM) which made it the first fine arts museum in Nevada. The museum was orphaned in the mid 1990s, when the City of Las Vegas announced it needed LVAM's space to make way for an expanded senior center to service the neighborhood surrounding the park. It was invited to share the yet-to-be-built Sahara Library and Fine Art Museum in the new Peccole Ranch subdivision, but it had to reside in a temporary space provided by the Earnest Becker Family until the building was finished in 1997. When it first opened, it scheduled a variety of exhibitions from Dale Chihuly and Marc Chagall to Auguste Rodin while it was briefly affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution. In 2006, the museum rededicated itself to exhibiting and collecting contemporary fine art and design under its Director Dr. Libby Lumpkin and its board of trustees. Under Dr. Lumpkin, LVAM exhibited a survey of paintings by Michael Reafsnyder and work by important Southern California-based minimalists including Robert Irwin, Larry Bell and James Turrell. Cindy Wright and Martin Mull have also exhibited at LVAM along with architectural models by Frank Gehry and sculpture by Kaz Oshiro. LVAM celebrated Las Vegas Diaspora: The Emergence of Contemporary Art from the Neon Homeland curated by Dave Hickey from Sept. 30 to Dec. 30, 2007. The exhibit featured a selection of works by 26 artists who studied with Dave Hickey from 1990 to 2001 when he taught art theory and criticism in the Department of Art at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Participating artists include: Rev. Ethan Acres, Robert Acuna, Philip Argent, Aaron Baker, Tim Bavington, Thomas Burke, Jane Callister, Bradley Corman, Jacqueline Ehlis, Curtis Fairman, Gajin Fujita, Sush Machida Gaikotsu, James Gobel, Sherin Guirguis, Jack Hallberg, James Hough, Shawn Hummel, Carrie Jenkins, Angela Kallus, Wayne Littlejohn, Victoria Reynolds, David Ryan, Jason Tomme, Sean Slattery, Yek and Almond Zigmund. Lumpkin also created the 702 Series that features solo exhibition by artists who were born and raised in Las Vegas, who initiated careers in Las Vegas, or who presently live and work in our city who represent Las Vegas in the broader national and international communities. The 702 Series has featured exhibits by Sush Machida Gaikotsu and Stephen Hendee. The museum had started as an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. This affiliation was ended in 2007. The museum closed its doors to the public on February 28, 2009, citing falling donations.Peterson, Kristen. Las Vegas Sun. Strapped Las Vegas Art Museum plans to shutter. Written 2009-2-21.

The author's name is only listed as a pseudonym, Chimo. It was adapted into a film. Plot summary Lila Says is a narrative of the protagonist's — Chimo, an Arab boy living in France — interactions with a girl named Lila. Lila is 16 and lives with her catholic aunt; Chimo is 19 and lives with his mother, who works as a cleaner, and sister. Both live in an low income housing estate of tower blocks called Oak Tree estate. Lila is very beautiful and does – according to Chimo – not really fit in, because she is special in all regards. He is, like anyone else who knows her, fascinated and attracted by her. She teases him with her body and her sexuality and her intimate and provocative stories. He did not have much perspective in life, but she has what it takes to change his attitude and she gives him perspective. He likes writing but has to hide for doing that as he would be ridiculed if others would find out. Lila inspires him and he focusses on writing about her, her life and their encounters. He tells the story of how he makes intimate experiences with her - such as on a slide and on a bike - and about his life at the bottom of society. The process of writing the novel is part of its story and he describes his thoughts whilst writing it. Notes The author's real name is not revealed. The publisher's note in the book states that a manuscript was dropped off by a lawyer and they never had a chance to interact with the author.

In accordance with 33 CFR 117.5, the bridge opens on signal for the passage of vessels.Government Printing Office, \\"Drawbridge Operating Regulations; Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, Grand Lake, LA\\", March 24, 2003 Boone's Corner, located at 605 Highway 384, has long been a reference point for visitors passing through Grand Lake. History In June 1896, 45 students are enrolled in school with Martin Hebert, teacher. Considerable cotton is being raised, rice acreage is double that of the previous year, and sweet potatoes are being raised. From 1905 until 1930 the steamer \\"Borealis Rex,\\" ran excursions three times a week from Lake Charles to Leesburg (Cameron) for 75 cents, round trip. Grand Lake was a stopping point between the two cities until 1930, when the first road was built through Grand Lake, connecting Calcasieu to Cameron.W. T. Block Education Grand Lake School is a primary and secondary public school run by the Cameron Parish School Board with grades Pre-Kindergarten through 12. It is located on Louisiana Highway 384. Sports include Boys Jr. High Football, Basketball, Baseball, Softball, Rodeo, and Track. The mascot is a Hornet. When Hurricane Rita exited Cameron Parish on September 24, 2005, only three of Cameron Parish's six schools - Grand Lake School, Hackberry High School and Johnson Bayou School were still standing. Students from the totally destroyed coastal schools of South Cameron High School, Cameron Elementary School and South Cameron Elementary School relocated and shared space at the Grand Lake School site. 2009 - 2010 school year; Students: 749 Teachers 62K12Guides In 2009 the school joined the advisory committee of National FFA Organization's National Quality Program Standards.Future Farmers of America In November 2010, the state of Louisiana approved disaster recovery funds for infrastructure improvement projects with $9,054,344 going to Grand Lake High School for an addition to the Career and Technology Center, installation of two new emergency generators, renovations to the gym and cafeteria, construction of a pre-K playground, the addition of a new track facility and enhancements to the softball field.\\"Division of Administration\\" By 2011 Grand Lake evolved from a rural setting to a more suburban setting. In a 2011 - 2012 Gap Statement: African American students' ELA (English and Language Arts) performance consistently decreased from 2008-2011 (88.9% - 72.7% — 60% ~ 36.4%). Students with Disabilities ELA performance decreased from 52.5% to 33.4% Cause for Gap: In 2005 and 2008, Grand Lake High School and the community were adversely impacted by Hurricane Rita and Hurricane lke respectively. In both years, students missed extended periods of instructional time and many students were living in temporary housing.\\"Grand Lake High School Improvement Plan\\" Page 6-7 Community partners Louisiana Cooperative Extension Services 10086 Gulf Hwy.

The portage took 31 days. Two portions of the route, which have largely escaped development, are part of a National Historic Landmark District, designated in 1966 to commemorate this achievement. and In May 2008 the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed the site on their list of America's Most Endangered Places.Threats to history seen in budget cuts, bulldozers - Yahoo! News History The 1804-06 Lewis and Clark Expedition was the first major incursion of English-speaking white men into the northwestern American plains. Ascending the Missouri River, the party reached the Great Falls area on July 13, 1805. Having been forewarned of the falls' existence by the Hidatsa with whom they had overwintered, an advance team led by Meriwether Lewis scouted the extent of the falls, which then consisted of a series of cascades extending beyond what is now the city of Great Falls. Many of these have since been dammed to produce hydroelectric power, and some are hemmed in by the city. The route selected by Clark began with an ascent of over up what is now called Belt Creek, about 1 mile below present-day Morony Dam. From there, the expedition boats were carried overland on crude wagons constructed by the team overland to a site near the White Bear Islands, south of the modern city. The expedition's largest boat, a pirogue, was left at Belt Creek. The team celebrated Independence Day at the upper camp, and departed upstream on July 15, having constructed two additional canoes to compensate for the loss of the boat. Landmarked areas White Bear Islands area Two separate portions of the expedition portage route form part of the National Historic Landmark District designated in 1966. At the lower end of the portage, the area on the east bank of the river where the party made camp (approximately ) is included, as is the portage route up Belt Creek, continuing for about across what are now mainly agricultural fields. Also included in this section is Sulphur Spring, located above the west bank of the river opposite the mouth of Belt Creek. Water from this source, reputed to have curative powers, was used to treat Sacagawea, who had fallen seriously ill at the camp. This entire area is privately owned, and is difficult to access by land. The other element of the portage that is landmarked is the last of the route, extending from Mount Olivet Cemetery to the White Bear Islands area (approximately ). At the time of the expedition there were three White Bear Islands; one has since become attached to the western shore by silting action, and the actual camp site was probably some way east of the current eastern bank. The land in this area is also privately owned but is crossed by public roads.

The site, excavated in the 1930s, is theorized to represent a rare instance of a settlement from early in the period in which the Crow and Hidatsa Native American tribes separated from one another. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. Site description The Hagen Site is located on a terrace on the north bank of the Yellowstone River north of Glendive. It is bounded on the east and north by a generally dry arroyo. The site's human- built features include a pit that has been interpreted as an earth lodge site, cache pits, and hearths. During excavation of a portion of the site in the 1930s, more than 20,000 artifacts were recovered from the site, including large numbers of ceramic fragments, stone tools, animal bones, and fragmentary human remains. The site was discovered in 1936 by Oscar Lewis, an area resident and amateur archaeologist, and is named for the landowner. It was examined that year by a team funded by the federal National Youth Administration program. It underwent more substantive excavations in the following two years, by teams organized by the state and funded by the Works Progress Administration. These excavations recorded the locations of artifacts in a horizontal but not vertical orientation, a deficiency that has caused later difficulties in using the collection for analysis and comparison. Finds at the site give some indication of a sedentary horticultural use, consistent with Hidatsa practice, but the site is not anywhere near other known Hidatsa sites, which are primarily on the Missouri River watershed further east in North Dakota. The ceramics at the site bear some resemblance to Crow artifacts, but there is ongoing debate about exactly what constitutes Crow pottery, and the lack of stratigraphic information from the Hagen collection complicates resolution of the question. Despite this problem, the site has been recognized as of unquestioned importance in the region since early analyses were published.

Glastic, located in South Euclid, Ohio, was one of the first makers of fiberglass insulators for the electrical industry, and now makes fiber optic cable. Roger's work was part of Cleveland's post-war boom that swelled the city to 7th largest in the nation in the 1950s—just behind Detroit. It also diversified the manufacturing base of the Northeast Ohio area, so that when Ohio's Steel Belt turned into the Rust Belt in the late 70s and early 80s, companies that Roger had founded and worked with cushioned the crunch and contributed to the area's reinvention as a diversified manufacturing area. Roger was born in 1911 in Boundbrook, NJ to Joseph and Minnie White. He had two older sisters, Margaret Bourke-White and Ruth. Margaret Bourke-White is generally considered one of the great photojournalists of the 20th century. Roger graduated from MIT in 1934. After graduation he worked first for Union Carbide in New York City. Union Carbide asked him to move to Cleveland Ohio to sell welding and cutting products to the steel industry there. It was in Cleveland that he met and became a business partner with James T. Lewis at Lewis Welding. During his early years in Cleveland he became part of the Gold Coasters, a small men's group. While there, he and his friend Dick Newpher built a sailing kayak from a kit. They didn't like it. It was flimsy, so they worked it over, redesigned it. They took their new design to the Mentor Harbor Yachting Club, Mentor, Ohio and there sailed rings around the regular sailboats. Roger also loved camping and flying airplanes. He would take days-long trips into the wild woodlands around the Great Lakes. He flew planes as small as Piper Cubs and as large as twin- engined Piper Apaches. In 1944 he worked on the Manhattan Project which produced the first atomic bomb, and in 1945 he married Anne \\"Mike\\" White, and they had two sons, Roger Bourke White Jr. and Jonathan Bourke \\"Toby\\" White, and six grandchildren. In 1946, as part of America's transition from a wartime to a post-war economy, Roger moved from the steel industry to start a brand new industry: the high-tech fiberglass electrical insulator industry. He started Glastic Corporation with Dick Newpher. He became a leader in this field, producing numerous technical conference papers, trade journal articles and a text book on reinforced plastics. Roger's work produced smaller insulators, which reduced the size of electric motors, leading to the proliferation of small motors that now help us every day. Roger was a member of the Cleveland Skating Club. He was a tenacious tennis player and clever curler. He skied and snorkeled, so vacation time took the family north and south. In the Bahamas he found a new sport in addition to snorkeling: he would perch on the front of a small outboard board boat and chase sharks across sandy shallows. If they let him get close, he would shoot them with a bow and arrow. Like his sister Margaret, Roger enjoyed photography. He also loved making home movies. He sold out of Glastic in 1968. After that he became Chairman of Lauren Manufacturing Company, New Philadelphia, Ohio, which made extruded rubber products for the auto industry, window sealers for skyscrapers, and other sealers for the Alaskan Pipeline. He founded another major manufacturing business, Pultrusions Corp., Aurora, Ohio which made pultruded fiberglass products. Their products were used for overhead racks on buses, sewage treatment paddles, tent poles and flag poles for bicycles. He married Bonnie Crislip in 1976. He retired from business in 1980, but stayed active helping people in other ways. He linked up with the American Go Association to promote the playing of Go in the United States, serving as Membership Secretary and touring the country to visit local clubs. He also founded The American Go Foundation, which supports the development of American Go by providing schools and libraries with playing materials, offering children scholarships to study the game, subsidizing Go teachers and in many other ways. Go (in Korean paduk or baduk) is a chess-like game which is widely played in the Far East.

Chabahar free trade–industrial zone was established in 1992 along with the two other free trade zones Qeshm and Kish Island to use global expertise (mostly from South East Asia) as a tool for the development of the country, accelerating the accomplishment of infrastructure, creation of employment, and representation in global markets.Article 1 of law on the establishment and administration of free trade-industrial zone The Chabahar free trade–industrial zone achieved its importance mainly from its geographical location as the shortest and the most secure route connecting the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as well as Afghanistan to warm waters and its proximity to one of the largest oil, gas and mineral resources of the world and as the only ocean port of the country. Main activities Chabahar free trade-industrial zone started its activities in 1995 focusing on five major areas: transit of merchandized goods, investment attraction and related services, tourism, construction & urban development and education under the administration of public controlled Chabahar free trade-industrial zone organization. May 2016 agreements between Iran and India After overseeing a series of agreements intending to develop the Port of Chabahar, India's Highways and Shipping Minister, Nitin Gadkari suggested that the Chabahar Free Trade-Industrial Zone had the potential to attract upwards of $15 billion worth of investment in the future, although he stated that such investments are predicated upon Iran offering India natural gas at a rate of $1.50 per million British Thermal Units, which is substantially lower than the rate of $2.95 per million British Thermal Units offered by Iran. The two countries also signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the possibility of setting up an aluminum smelter at a cost of $2 billion, as well as establishing a urea processing facility in Chahbahar, although these investments are also contingent upon Iran supplying low-cost natural gas for operation of those facilities.

The entrance station straddles U.S. Route 212 (US 212) west of Cooke City-Silver Gate. A combined ranger station and residence is located nearby. All buildings were constructed by George Larkin of Gardiner, Montana. Description January 2014 The Northeast Entrance Station spans the center of the road into the park from Cooke City. A central block housing the office and two checking windows is flanked by smaller blocks, each housing a checking window and joined to the main block by a long gabled roof that spans the ensemble. Each block is marked by a cross gable proportional to the block's size. The walls are lodgepole pine logs cut within the park with saddle- jointed corner, randomly beveled. Log poles support the shingled roof. The entrance station rests on a local stone foundation. A stone chimney for the heating stove projects above the central block. Earth floors have been replaced with concrete slabs. and The ranger residence is a matching log building, rectangular in plan with a small extension housing an office. The residence is one story with seven rooms. Unusually for its time it was insulated during construction to try to prevent ice from building up on the roof. Influence The Northeast Entrance Station was featured in a planbook published by the National Park Service as an example of appropriate design for national and state park structures. Park and Recreational Structures was greatly influential in the design of park facilities in North America in the late 1930s, when many parks were being developed as job-creation projects. The design of the entrance station may itself have been influenced by the 1932 decision of the small community of Silver Gate, just beyond the entrance station, to build entirely in log construction. Historic designation As a pristine example of its type, and being an ambitious one for its time, it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places at the same time.

Life and work  Ciamician was born in Trieste, Italy (then part of Austrian Empire) from Armenian parents. Ciamician was an early researcher in the area of photochemistry, where from 1900 to 1914 he published 40 notes, and nine memoirs. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Giessen. His first photochemistry experiment was published in 1886 and was titled \\"On the conversion of quinone into quinol. In 1910 he became the first man born in Trieste to be nominated Senator, in the XXIII Legislation of the Kingdom of Italy. In 1912 he presented a paper before the 8th International Congress on Applied Chemistry later also published in Science in which he described the world's need for an energy transition to renewable energy. Ciamician saw the possibility to use photochemical devices that utilize solar energy to produce fuels to power the human civilization and called for their development. They would not only make humanity independent from coal, but could also rebalance the economic gap between rich and poor countries. His vision makes him one early proponents of artificial photosynthesis.:Nicola Armaroli, Vincenzo Balzani, (2007). The Future of Energy Supply: Challenges and Opportunities.

Wheeler House is a historic house at 1232 East 2nd Street in Butte, Montana, United States. Built about 1923, this modest working-class house was for many years the home of politician Burton K. Wheeler (1882-1975), a radical Democrat who in 1924 ran for United States Vice President on the Progressive Party ticket with Robert La Follette Sr. In the 1930s he opposed the New Deal and what he viewed as efforts to bring the United States into World War II. His house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and Description and history The Burton K. Wheeler House stands in a densely built residential area east of downtown Butte that was traditionally a working-class neighborhood populated by mine workers. The house is separated from its neighbors by concrete paths, and is set back a short way from the sidewalk on the street. The house is 1-1/2 stories in height, with the first story built out of brick, and the upper half-story elements framed in wood and covered in wooden shingles. The front has a three-part window, with a larger central sash flanked by smaller sashes. To its left a recessed porch, its corner supported by a sloping square post with shingled exterior. The gable above the main window group has a deep eave supported by Craftsman brackets, and shows a band of three equal-sized sash windows. The house was apparently built not long before its purchase in 1908 by Burton K. Wheeler. Wheeler lived here until 1923, when his rise in national politics brought him to Washington, DC as a United States Senator. Although Wheeler's law practice had quickly made it possible for him to move to a more affluent area, he categorically refused, claiming that he enjoyed living among the working classes in the neighborhood, and that it was \\"worth extra votes every time I ran for office\\". Wheeler became nationally prominent by investigating prosecutors who refused to go after individuals implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal. He bolted the Democratic Party to run with La Follette on the Progressive Party's presidential ticket; this ticket gained more votes than any other third-party campaign until 1968. In the 1930s he opposed Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal domestic policies, and what he viewed were Roosevelt's foreign policies that would draw the country into what became World War II. His opposition to entry into the war cost him reelection in 1946.

He was Chairman of the Academy of Fine Arts, Paris for 2013. Clergue in January 2013 (Photo: François Besch)  Biography  Lucien Clergue was born in Arles, France. At the age of 7 he began learning to play the violin, and after several years of study his teacher admitted that he had nothing more to teach him. Clergue was from a family of shopkeepers and could not afford to pursue further studies in a college or university school of music, such as a conservatory. In 1949, he learned the basics of photography. Four years later, at a corrida in Arles, he showed his photographs to Spanish painter Pablo Picasso who, though subdued, asked to see more of his work. Within a year and a half, young Clergue worked on his photography with the goal of sending more images to Picasso. During this period, he worked on a series of photographs of travelling entertainers, acrobats and harlequins, the « Saltimbanques ». He also worked on a series whose subject was carrion.  Friendship with Picasso  On November 4, 1955, Lucien Clergue visited Picasso in Cannes, France. Their friendship lasted nearly 30 years until Picasso's death. Clergue's autobiographical book, Picasso My Friend, looks back on important moments of their relationship. Rencontres d'Arles, 1975 Founding the Rencontres d’Arles photography festival In 1968, and with his friend Michel Tournier, Clergue founded the Rencontres d’Arles photography festival which is held annually in July in Arles. He exhibited his work at the festival during the years 1971–1973, 1975, 1979, 1982–1986, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1994, 2000, 2003 and 2007. Clergue also illustrated books, among them a book by writer Yves Navarre. Clergue took many photographs of the gypsies of southern France, and was instrumental in propelling the guitarist Manitas de Plata to fame. Clergue's photographs are in the collections of numerous well-known museums and private collectors. His photographs have been exhibited in over 100 solo exhibitions worldwide, with noted exhibitions such as in 1961, at the Museum of Modern Art New York, the last exhibition organized by Edward Steichen with Lucien Clergue, Bill Brandt and Yasuhiro Ishimoto. Museums with large collections of his work include The Fogg Museum at Harvard University and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. His work, Fontaines du Grand Palais (Fountains of the Grand Palais), is in of Lugano.Museo cantonale d'arte of Lugano: Lucien Clergue His photographs of Jean Cocteau are on permanent display at the Jean Cocteau Museum in Menton, France. In the U.S., an exhibition of the Cocteau photographs was premiered at Westwood Gallery, New York City. In 2007, the city of Arles honored Lucien Clergue and dedicated a retrospective collection of 360 of his photographs dating from 1953 to 2007. He also received the 2007 Lucie Award.http://lucieawards.org/LuciePhotoGallery/Arles06.html Election as Member of the Academy of Fine Arts He was named Knight of the Légion d'honneur in 2003 and elected member of the Academy of Fine Arts of the Institute of France on May 31, 2006, at the same time as a new section dedicated to photography was created. Clergue was the first photographer to enter the Academy to a position devoted specifically to photography. He was Chairman of the Academy of Fine Arts for 2013. Personal life Lucien Clergue was married to the art curator Yolande Clergue, founder of The Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles. He was the father of two daughters: Anne Clergue, a curator of contemporary art who has worked at Leo Castelli Gallery, and Olivia Clergue, a handbag fashion designer whose godfather was Pablo Picasso.

In 2005, the Ministry of Transport revisited the project and carried out a feasibility study. In 2007, the Asian Development Bank provided to conduct a study on the project. The initial plan called for an rail network with 60 stations to be constructed in four separate phases. The first phase involved the construction of a rail line between Gajju Matta and Shahdara Bagh, with an section underground. Construction was expected to start in 2008 and be completed by 2010. However, in 2008, the project was shelved again as priorities shifted to other projects. In June 2010, Malaysia based Scomi International proposed a US $1.15 billion monorail–based alternative, however the project was not approved. In May 2014, an agreement was signed so that the construction of the Orange Line could begin.

Features In case of a serious disability, such as caused by a severe spinal injury or brain damage, the patient and their families' abilities, life style, and projects, are suddenly shattered. In order to cope with this situation, the person and their family must establish and negotiate a \\"new way of living\\", both with their changed body and as a changed individual within their wider community. Thus, neurorehabilitation works with the skills and attitudes of the disabled person and their family and friends. It promotes their skills to work at the highest level of independence possible for them. It also encourages them to rebuild self-esteem and a positive mood. Thus, they can adapt to the new situation and become empowered for successful and committed community reintegration. Neurorehabilitation should be: :* Holistic It should cater for the physical, cognitive, psychological, social and cultural dimensions of the personality, stage of progress and lifestyle of both the patient and their family. :* Patient-focused Customized health care strategies should be developed, focused on the patient (and family). :* Inclusive Care-plans should be designed and implemented by multidisciplinary teams made up of highly qualified and motivated practitioners experienced in multidisciplinary teamwork. :* Participatory The patient and their family's active cooperation is essential. The patient and family must be well-informed, and a trusting relationship with the multidisciplinary team must be built. :* Sparing Treatment must aim at empowering the patient to maximise independence, and to reduce physical impairment and reliance on mobility aids. :* Lifelong The patient's various needs throughout their life must be catered for, by ensuring continuity of care all the way through from injury onset to the highest possible level of recovery of function. This may include addressing medical complications of the injury or illness later in life. :* Resolving Treatment has to include adequate human and material resources for efficiently resolving each patient's problems as they arise. :* Community-focused. It is necessary to look for the solutions best adapted to the specific characteristics of the community and to further the creation of community resources favouring the best possible community reintegration of the disabled person.  Commonly treated conditions  * Stroke * Spinal Cord Injury * Cerebral palsy * Parkinson's disease * Brain injury  Anoxic brain injury  Traumatic brain injury * Multiple sclerosis * Post-polio syndrome * Guillain–Barré syndrome How it works By focusing on all aspects of a person's functional independence and well being, neurorehabilitation offers a series of therapies from the Medications, Physiotherapy, speech and swallow therapy, psychological therapies, occupational therapies, teaching or re-training patients on mobility skills, communication processes, and other aspects of that person's daily routine. Neurorehabilitation also provides focuses on nutrition, psychological, and creative parts of a person's recovery. Many neurorehabilitation programs, whether offered by hospitals or at private, specialized clinics, have a wide variety of specialists in many different fields to provide the most well rounded treatment of patients. These treatments, over a period of time, and often over the lifetime of a person, allow that individual and that person's family to live the most normal, independent life possible. While the field of neurorehabilitation is relatively new, many therapies are controversial, and while some are considered cutting edge technology, there may be little research to support whether or not helpful progress is the result. Neurorehabilitation is the culmination of many different fields to provide the best care and education for patients with injuries or diseases affecting their nervous system. Types The most important therapies are those that help people live their everyday lives. These include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, rehabilitation psychology, speech and swallow therapy, vision therapy, and language therapy, and therapies focused on daily function and community re-integration. A particular focus is given to improving mobility and strength, as this is key to a person's independence. Neurorehabilitation is a team work. The specialists who participate are with specific skill sets, includes Physiatrist or Rehabilitation medicine specialist, Neurologist, Neurosurgeon, other medical specialists, Physiotherapists, Occupational therapists, Respiratory therapists, Prothetist and Orthotist, Rehabilitation nurse, Psychologists, Vocational counselor, and many more. Physiotherapy includes helping patients recover the ability of physical actions which includes: balance retraining, gait analysis and transfer training, neuromuscular retraining, orthotics consultations, and aqua therapy. Occupational therapy helps patients in activities of daily living. Some of these include: home modifications and safety training (Fall prevention strategies), cognitive rehabilitation - retraining for memory, attention, processing, and executive functions. It may also include neuro-muscular strengthening and training, and visual perceptual skill development. Rehabilitation psychologists and Speech-Language Pathologists and have begun to provide cognitive rehabilitation as well with goals that emphasize instruction in life-changes that facilitate increased independence. Speech and language therapy includes assisting patients with swallowing and communication issues. Rehabilitation psychology includes helping patients deal with their changed, often dramatically so, circumstances especially coping to a changed identity of self as a result of adaptions and changes necessitated by brain injury. Technological developments Over the last decade with the aid of science and technology, we are more familiar with the human brain and its function than ever before. Development in neuroimaging techniques has greatly enhanced the scope and outcome of neurorehabilitation. Now, scientists are using technology with neurorehabilitation to provide cutting edge improvements to therapies for patients with nervous system issues. In particular, the use of robotics in neurorehabilitation is becoming more and more common. Virtual reality simulations and video games provide patients with an interactive way to explore and re-learn different aspects of their lives and environments while being observed within the safety of their treating therapists and physicians. These devices and simulations, along with other robotic technology, offer patients who have just had strokes, other brain or spinal cord injuries the option of training and physical therapy much sooner than might otherwise be possible, thus shortening the recovery period.

It became a model for other landfills around the country, and one of the longest-lived. The landfill was operated by the City of Fresno until it closed in 1989. At that time, the landfill had reached the size of . It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001. Description The former Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill is located about from downtown Fresno, on of land at the southwest corner of South West Avenue and West Jensen Avenue. The landfill is a basically rectangular mound, about long and wide. It rises to a height about above the surrounding grade, its sides at a varying but typically steep pitch. It is covered with grass. The landfill has no lining. History Fresno, like other growing cities, sought a suitable long-term solution to the disposal of municipal solid waste in the 1930s. The city conducted an experiment in the operation of a \\"sanitary\\" landfill near its water treatment plant, in which a trench was dug, filled with waste, and then covered with fill dug from an adjacent trench, which would be the next area filled. The demonstration site opened in 1934, and was judged a success. The present site was acquired by the city in 1937 and opened the same year. During its years of operation, the city filled an average of per year with about 24,000 tons of waste. Superfund site In 1983, the California Department of Health Services conducted tests which found that the site contained methane and vinyl chloride gases that were penetrating into the areas around the landfill. These tests also concluded that contaminants were being found in private ground-water wells around the landfill. On June 24, 1988, the site was proposed as a superfund site and was finalized on the NPL list on October 10, 1989.

Ringve Farm was the childhood home of the Danish-Norwegian nobleman, Peter Tordenskjold. It is situated in a park on the Lade peninsula just outside Trondheim with a view over the Trondheimsfjord, the park forming botanical gardens run by NTNU (the Norwegian University of Science and Technology). The first house on the site was built in 1521, but the current group of buildings dates from the 1740s onwards. When the estate was auctioned in 1878, it was purchased by the Bachke family and one of the sons, Christian Anker Bachke (1873-1946) acquired the estate in 1919. In late 1919, he married Russian émigré Victoria Rostin Bachke, an artist who fled from the Russian Revolution. The couple had no children but put their considerable energies into their love of music and assembling a collection of historical musical instruments, which now numbers around 1,500 instruments, alongside other artifacts associated with music – pictures, recordings.Victoria Bachke (Ringve Museum. U. Peter Svensson, Mats Krouthén) The museum is based on the private collection of founder Victoria Bachke and was opened to the public in 1952. Jon Voigt (1928-1997) succeeded Victoria Bachke as director in 1963 and continued until 1997. Over the years many famous musicians visited Ringve, including Artur Schnabel, Lilly Krauss, Ignaz Friedman, Percy Grainger and Kirsten Flagstad, as well as the artist, Edvard Munch. Exhibition Ringve Museum manor house The public exhibitions are divided in two parts: the Manor House and the Barn. =The Manor House= The period interiors of the Ringve Manor House provide the setting for themed rooms of working – mainly keyboard – instruments. In this section, open by guided tour only, the guides (often graduate music students) play an appropriate piece of music (or extract) as the tour proceeds. The first room is called the Mozart room and contains a spinet, clavichord and a domestic or house organ, from the 18th century. A Murano glass chandelier hangs from the ceiling. The next room is called the ‘Beethoven’ and contains a harp piano of 1870 by Dietz, and a piano of type favoured by Beethoven. A room dedicated to Chopin comes next, with examples of the composer's preferred pianos, as well as a death mask and casts of his hands. There are also watercolours by George Sand and memorabilia about Chopin and Liszt. A card table and sofa that came from Chopin's Paris home, and which were inherited by his Norwegian pupil Thomas Tellefsen are on display. Park in the English style Upstairs there is a room based around singers Elisabeth Wiborg and Adelina Patti and includes a piano which Patti insisted on being accompanied. This is followed by a display of Hardanger fiddles, a ‘Grieg’ room, a room of instruments associated with church and worship, and finally a room of curiosities, including a Cecilium, a Norwegian-made barrel-organ, musical toys and a Janko piano. =Fire= The Ringve Museum on fire The manor was badly hit by a fire in the attic and second floor on 3 August 2015.\\"Nightmare Fire Hits Music Museum\\" - News In English =The Barn (Museet på Låven)= The collections on display in the Barn are divided in two parts: *Instruments mainly associated with western classical and popular music over four centuries.

The company operates Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant, which consists of two BWRs (boiling water reactors), an EPR (European Pressurized Reactor) which is still under construction, and one half of a coal-fired power plant along with a wind farm. The third reactor at Olkiluoto was expected to be ready in 2009, but last estimate is 2021. TVO has filed compensation claim for delays, and Areva- Siemens have counter-claimed against TVO. Arbitrators at the International Chamber of Commerce are considering the claims. On 21 April 2010, the Government of Finland decided to grant a permit for construction of fourth reactor at Olkiluoto. The decision was approved by the Parliament on 1 July 2010. In 2014 this permit expired, and was not renewed by the government. In January 2015 TVO announced plans to save around $17.7 million per year through 'efficiency-related structural changes' which are expected to cause up to 110 job cuts. The CEO of TVO, Jarmo Tanhua, explained the reasons as: An October 2016 story in the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports that TVO is calling on Siemens to take financial responsibility for the completion of unit3 of the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant, because its project partner, the French Areva Group, is being broken up by the French government.

Its primary functions allow users to manage contacts, appointments, projects and to-do lists. EGroupware is based on PHP. The projects spreads its software under the terms of GNU General Public License (GPL). It is used either via its native web-interface, making access platform- independent, or by using different supported groupware clients, such as Kontact, Novell Evolution, or Microsoft Outlook. It can also be used by mobile phone or PDA via SyncML. It currently has translations for more than 25 languages, including right-to-left language support. It depends on a standard X-AMP System and as such requires no specific operating system. Most popular internet browsers are supported for use as web based clients. History EGroupware is the most current manifestation of a chain of projects. The original project was called webdistro. In 2000 development on the project phpgroupware began, which was based on webdistro; and in 2003 the EGroupware fork was born. EGroupware has a very pronounced community character compared with its predecessors. There is an EGroupware constitution, adopted in 2005, which guarantees freedom and security to the community and establishes admin elections.http://www.egroupware.org/ For a short time Tine 2.0 was an official subproject of EGroupware. The goal of the subproject was the development of future technologies for the EGroupware project. Due to internal disagreements, the projects EGroupware and Tine 2.0 had separated from each other in February 2008.Final admin decision about Tine 2.0 Since July 2009 the first professional Version of EGroupware is available. It is being sold as a software subscription. This product line, called „EGroupware Premium Line“ (EPL) includes a maintenance agreement for the source code and corresponding RPMs, that enables automatic updates. Version 14.2 ist is available since December 2014. E-Share-Option: Since version 14.2 EGroupware Filemanager offers a filesharing option for an easy data exchange. It includes, for example, the option to send links to read or edit files to persons that do not use EGroupware. Beside that, files can be moved via drag and drop. Filemanager is used as an alternative to the filehosting service Dropbox. Home Screen: The Home Screen is a virtual pinboard, that makes important contacts, projects or tasks always available for the user. Mobile Template: The third update in 14.2 is the mobile template, that has been optimized for small screens and touch handling. It enables the usage of EGroupware on tablets and supports swipe gestures and an adaptation of the format while turning the device. For 2016 the Release of version 16.1 is scheduled.

He is well known for capturing revealing moments of celebrities - including President Barack Obama, Meredith Vieira, Steve Jobs, Lil' Kim, Quentin Tarantino, Foxy Brown, and Christopher Hitchens \\\\- as well as for his extensive campaigns for Gap Inc., Vanity Fair, and People. His work is described as \\"iconic, beautiful portraiture defined by a refined yet approachable point of view.\\"  Career  Born to a Dutch mother and an American father in Manchester, Witkin was raised in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. During his childhood he was exposed to a wide range of art and culture by his painter father which inspired him to become a photographer. He relocated to New York in 1984 to study photography at Syracuse University, after which he moved to New York City, where he began working with Peter Lindbergh, Bruce Weber, and Annie Leibovitz. In 1993, Witkin was introduced to George Pitts \\\\- a photo editor at the then new Vibe Magazine - which launched his professional career. During his time at Vibe, Witkin would score critical success and recognition for his work which included capturing Quincy Jones, 50 Cent, Nas, Eve, Rakim, and numerous other stars in a style that combined intimate portraiture with blazing glamour. Concurrent with this work, a series of street portraits commissioned by New York Magazine would also attract major plaudits leading to a long association with the organization and entry to working with the most exclusive magazines in the world. In 1996, New York Times Magazine would honour him in its list of the world's leading photographers, 100 Years of Pictures; WHO'S WHO. Cultivating a working relationship with Gary Koepke led Witkin to pitching Gap Inc. his concept for a new marketing campaign featuring rising and iconic stars. This concept was embraced and implemented at Witkin's studio in Manhattan's Meat Packing District, photographing under a large skylight into a three walled \\"room\\" with old planked floors. Met with great popular acclaim, this approach would define Gap's marketing slant for the next eight years. Participating stars in this campaign included Danny Glover, Nathan Lane, Sarah Jessica Parker, Scarlett Johansson, Anjelica Huston, Don Cheadle, Rosanna Arquette with Patricia Arquette, and Tatum O'Neal with Ryan O'Neal. In addition to his work with Hollywood celebrities, Witkin has worked extensively with dancers and dance companies including, Stephen Petronio, Merce Cunningham Dance Company, Paul Taylor Dance Company, American Ballet Theatre, The Royal Ballet, and New York City Ballet. His work has appeared in most major magazines including: Vogue (American, British, German, Spanish and Japanese editions), Elle Magazine, O, The Oprah Magazine, W, Harper's Bazaar, Slate, Vanity Fair, The New York Times, The New York Times Magazine, Interview Magazine, Wall Street Journal, NY Magazine, People Magazine, Women's Health, The London Sunday Times, Arena, and i-D. His advertising clients include Gucci, Gap, Nike, IBM, American Express, Microsoft, Philips, Calvin Klein, and Shinola. His portrait commission list is a versatile constellation of stars including: Snoop Dog, Diane von Fürstenberg, Bruce Willis, Martha Stewart, Chaka Khan, Javier Bardem, Padma Lakshmi, Matt Damon, Gabourey Sidibe, Christian Bale, Beverly Johnson, LL Cool J, Michael Douglas with Kirk Douglas, The Olsen Twins, Lenny Kravitz, Julia Stiles, Ashton Kutcher, Chloë Sevigny, Marilyn Manson, and Gloria Steinem. Much of Witkin's distinctive style has been developed during his travels throughout the world - specifically India, Thailand, and Ethiopia - and his willingness to \\"take himself outside of his comfort zone.\\" For his commercial work, Witkin shoots digitally, while preferring film of different formats - 8x10, 4x5, and Rolleiflex; 6x6 - for studio work. His oeuvre has been shown in numerous exhibits and museums internationally and - in addition to being collected in numerous catalogs - has been published in a number of books. Witkin is preparing several bodies of work into monographs, notably \\"Ordinary Beauty\\" a book dedicated to female beauty in the form of nudes, portraits and fragments.  Personal life  Witkin is the son of the award- winning American figurative painter and art professor Jerome Witkin and the nephew of the American photographer Joel-Peter Witkin. His father and uncle are identical twins. Witkin has a daughter, India Witkin (b.1996). A longtime resident of New York, Witkin relocated to Los Angeles, CA in March 2018.

Built by slaves in 1853, it is a remarkably well-preserved example of Carpenter Gothic architecture, its design apparently taken from a book by Richard Upjohn. St. Andrew's was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1973, and was declared a National Historic Landmark on the same day. and Public access is allowed to this National Historic Landmark. Description and history St. Andrew's Episcopal Church stands on of land on the south side of County Highway 12 in the village of Prairieville. It is a single-story frame structure, basically rectangular in plan with two extensions, with a steeply pitched gabled roof. Its exterior is finished in vertical board siding, and most of its windows have pointed-arch tops, both characteristic elements of the Carpenter Gothic. The exterior is embellished by the regular placement of buttress-like projections. The main block of the church houses the nave, with an entry vestibule projecting from one side, and the vestry chamber extending from one of the ends. The entry door has large double doors, fastened by hand- wrought iron strap hinges. The interior of the church is finished in wood, to which a tobacco stain has been applied. The church was built in 1853 by the slaves of church members, under the direction of enslaved master carpenters from Henry Augustine Tayloe's nearby Gallion plantation. Tayloe served as Secretary of the Alabama Diocesan Episcopal Convention, and had been appointed to canvass the state to build up a Bishop's Fund. The church appears to have been built from a design in the book Rural Architecture by architect Richard Upjohn. The church congregation was founded in 1834, and this was its first church. It was formally consecrated in 1858, and drew parishioners, both free and slave, from surrounding counties. The congregation declined after the American Civil War led to a decline in population. The building continues to be maintained by the Episcopal Diocese of Alabama, with occasional services.

He was also a wealthy businessman, and a self-proclaimed leader of the Chinese democracy movement. He died in a motor vehicle accident in Arizona in July 2006. After his death, no significant activity by Zhong Gong has been reported. Biography =Early life= Zhang was born in 1954 in Harbin, where his family trade was coal-mining. Zhang spent ten years during the Cultural Revolution in a state farm in Heilongjiang, during which time he started practising Qigong. In 1977, he was admitted to the Harbin School of Metallurgy. On leaving, he joined the Communist Party and became a physics teacher in a mining region. Zhang gained entrance into the Beijing University of Science and Technology in 1985 where he studied Economic management. Palmer, citing Ji Yi, said Zhang obtained only mediocre grades as a student, but he was interested in a diverse range of modules from Law to Chinese and Western Medicine. He also signed on at the Chinese Qigong Further Education Academy. During this time he developed a style of Qigong which was based on automation, physics, relativity, bionics, and with distinctive use of mechanical engineering jargon. After graduation, he became a paid qigong researcher at a university, where he was to give his first public demonstration of the \\"Extraordinary Powers\\" he had acquired. =Zhong Gong= In 1987, he founded Zhong Gong,Mike Chinoy, Chinese sect leader waits for word on asylum in U.S. , CNN, 25 August 2000 launching it on the auspicious date of 8 August. Palmer, citing Ji Yi's 10-million-selling hagiography The Great Qigong Master Comes Down From the Mountains (1990), says that Zhang gave two-week-long Qigong workshops which received national coverage in the People's Daily. Among the over a thousand people who participated were prominent academics such as the President of Beijing University, who were reportedly able to capture and emit Qi. Having won over the academic community, Zhang also gained acceptance within the China Academy of Science, and other sections of the scientific community. Furthermore, he became a media celebrity after one workshop was featured in a three-minute news segment on CCTV. He also gained credibility within the media and political elites. The movement claimed 34 million followers, 120,000 employees, 30 life cultivation bases, and 100,000 \\"branches\\" at its peak.World of Shadows, China Matters, 26 July 2006. Retrieved 25 October 2007 According to Perry, in the early 1990s, Zhang and his followers withdrew to Qingchengshan, deep in Sichuan, where Zhang would reorganise his activities into commercial enterprises, the flagship of which was the Qilin Group, based in Qilin City. Cunningham states the group was made up of some 60 companies headquartered in Tianjin. The group reportedly employed 100,000 workers, mostly in qigong-related education, publication and health-product ventures.Philip Cunningham, Falling victim to U.S.-Chinese diplomacy, The Japan Times, 30 December 2000 =Criminal allegations and exile = Unlike Li Hongzhi, founder of Falun Gong, who disavowed political ambition, Zhang Hongbao positively embraced it.John Kusumi, Zhang Hongbao, qi gong master, Chinese dissident, and lightning rod for controversy dies at age 52, China Support Network, 10 September 2006 A close disciple defected from the group and wrote a scathing exposé alleging that Zhang was a fraud and had illicit sex with followers. Independent Chinese sceptic Sima Nan alleged that Zhang was a rapist and may even have been responsible for the murders of some former followers.Craig S. Smith, Asylum Plea by Chinese Sect's Leader Perplexes the U.S., The New York Times, 31 July 2000 The Chinese Government issued a warrant for his arrest on 7 June 2000, and a statement calling for his return to face four counts of rape between 1990 and 1991, and two counts of using forged travel documents between 1993 and 1994. The 10-year-old rape charge is difficult to verify, and one observer notes that over 40 Chinese dissidents were charged with sexual crimes in 1999/2000, a way China neutralises opponents of the regime without raising human-rights concerns. The Chinese authorities allege Zhang was in possession of a bogus identity card in the name of Wang Xingxiang, a Han male born on 8 August 1953. =Life in the United States= Zhang disappeared from public view in 1995 in light of increased criticism of Zhong Gong. Zhang together with his associate and companion, Yan Qingxin, arrived in the American protectorate of Guam in February 2000 without a visa, and applied for political asylum in the United States. While awaiting transfer to the US, Zhang went on hunger strike to press for his release from detention in Guam; several overseas Chinese dissident organizations—including the Free China Movement, the Chinese Democracy Party and the Joint Conference of Chinese Overseas Democracy Movement—organizing a press conference to support his cause. Zhang was denied asylum by the United States, but was granted wrongful withholding, which prevented repatriation to China. After 13 months in detention in Guam, he secured the services of Robert Shapiro, who defended O.J. Simpson. Shapiro claims credit for gaining the support of Trent Lott and Jesse Helms for Zhang's application. Zhang was granted protection residence by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeal in June 2001, reversing a previous ruling.Reuters, U.S. Grants Asylum to Banned China Sect Leader, Apologetics Index, 15 June 2001 In April, the China Federation Foundation (CFF) was founded with money from Zhang, and led by a dissident named Peng Ming. This group wanted to form an alternative government for China through the violent overthrow of the Communist government.Lev Navrozov, Zhang Hongbao’s ‘accident’ in U.S. after publishing Beijing’s secrets, Chinaview, 29 September 2006 Zhang claimed that he planned this for many years, not for creating conditions for formal Political Asylum to avoid being expelled if convicted. In what may have been a power struggle within the democratic China movement, Zhang subsequently fell out with other dissidents, including Yan Qingxin, his domestic partner for 12 years. Until September 2001, Yan was Zhong Gong's first lieutenant and \\"helped build the organization into a powerful entity that made billions of dollars\\". Yan filed a lawsuit on 26 June in Pasadena Superior Court accusing Zhang of assault, battery and false imprisonment,Experts say suits may hinder democracy, Pasadena Star-News, 1 August 2003 and asked for damages of US$23 million. Yan's sister, Qi Zhang, also a Chinese dissident, filed a suit in Pasadena in July 2003, accusing Zhang of crimes including racketeering and slander. In total, from 2003 to 2005, Zhang was hit by an avalanche of 20–40 civil lawsuits with accusations from other plaintiffs. The arrest of Zhang led to division in the democracy movement. Zhang was arrested in March 2003 at his Pasadena mansion in connection with allegations made by his housekeeper, He Nanfang. Zhang was charged with four felonies, including kidnapping assault and false imprisonment with a deadly weapon.AP, Exiled leader of Chinese spiritual movement charged in beating, Religion News Blog, 5 May 2003 If convicted, Zhang would have lost his protection status and been expelled from the United States. In the end, the felony charges in the He Nanfang case were reduced to one charge of battery, a misdemeanor, to which Zhang pleaded no contest on 22 April 2005. On 28 February 2006, Zhang won a criminal case, and soon other lawsuits against him were lost or were successively withdrawn. Only one civil case and a labor compensation case remained.Wen Hua, Possibly Murdered Qigong Master Disclosed CCP Military Secrets, Epoch Times, 8 September 2006 =Death= He had become a non-person to the mainstream Western media.

Lord Alexander George Boteville Thynne (17 February 1873 – 14 September 1918) was a British Army officer and Conservative politician. Thynne was the third and youngest son of John Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, and his wife Frances Isabella Catherine (née Vesey). He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry in April 1897. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, Thynne volunteered for active service and was commissioned a lieutenant in the Imperial Yeomanry on 7 February 1900, leaving Liverpool on the SS Cymric in March 1900 to serve in South Africa with the 1st (Wiltshire) company of the 1st Battalion. He resigned his active commission with the Imperial Yeomanry on 28 July 1902. During the war, he had been promoted a lieutenant in the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry on 13 June 1900, while still in South Africa. He was later a temporary Lieutenant-Colonel in the Service Battalion of the Wiltshire Regiment and served in the Somaliland campaign of 1903 to 1904. In the January 1910 general election he was elected to the House of Commons as one of two representatives for Bath. During the First World War Thynne was twice wounded in the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Croix de Guerre. He was killed in action in France on 14 September 1918, aged 45, whilst commanding 6th (Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry) Bn. Wiltshire Regiment and was buried at Béthune Town Cemetery. He never married.

It became part of the Roman province of Armenia Prima. Today, the city of Koyulhisar in northeastern Turkey occupies the site. History The city was founded by Pompey after his decisive victory over Mithridates VI of Pontus. It was situated in a well- watered plain lying at the base of a thickly-wooded mountain and settled by veterans of his army, as well as by the local peasantry. All the Roman highways intersecting that portion of the country and leading to Comana, Polemonium, Neocæsarea, Sebasteia, etc., radiated from Nicopolis which, even in the time of Strabo,Geographica, XII, iii, 28. boasted quite a large population. Given to Polemon by Mark Antony in 36 BC, Nicopolis was governed from 54 AD by Aristobulus of Chalcis and definitively annexed to the Roman Empire by Nero, in the year 64 AD. It then became the metropolis of Lesser Armenia and the seat of the provincial diet which elected the Armeniarch. Besides the altar of the Augusti, it raised temples to Zeus Nicephorus and to Victory. Christianity reached Nicopolis at an early date and, under Licinius, about 319, forty-five of the city's inhabitants were martyred; the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church venerate them on 10 July, St. BasilPatrologia Graeca, XXXII, 896. calls the priests of Nicopolis the sons of confessors and martyrs, and their churchP. G., XXXII, 834. the mother of that of Koloneia. In ca. 472, St. John the Silent, who had sold his worldly goods, erected a church there to the Blessed Virgin. SS Januarius and Pelagia were said to have been martyred in the town.Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"Pelagia\\". In 499 Nicopolis was destroyed by the 499 Nicopolis earthquake, with none save the bishop and his two secretaries escaping death.Bull. Acad. de Belgique, 1905, 557. This disaster was irreparable, and although Justinian I rebuilt the walls and erected a monastery in memory of the Forty-Five Martyrs,Procopius, \\"De Ædificiis\\", III, 4. Nicopolis never regained its former splendour and was superseded by Koloneia. Under Heraclius it was captured by the forces of Chosroes IISebeos, Histoire d'Heraclius, tr. Macler, p. 62. and thenceforth was only a mediocre city, a simple see and a suffragan of Sebasteia in Lesser Armenia, remaining such at least until the 11th century, as may be seen from the various Notitiae episcopatuum. In the 9th–11th centuries, it belonged to the theme of Koloneia. Under the Ottomans, the site of ancient Nicopolis was occupied by the Armenian village of Purkh, near the city of Enderes, in the sanjak of Kara-Hissar and the vilayet of Sivas. Bishops Notable among the eight bishops mentioned by Le Quien is St. Gregory who, in the 11th century, resigned his bishopric and retired to Pithiviers in France. The Catholic Church venerates him on 14 March.

Summary Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy consists of two combinations of drugs (courses A and B) given in an alternating fashion. The term 'hyper' refers to the hyperfractionated nature of the chemotherapy, which is given in smaller doses, more frequently, to minimize side effects. 'CVAD' is the acronym of the drugs used in course A: cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin (also known by its trade name, Adriamycin), and dexamethasone. Course B consists of methotrexate and cytarabine. The protocol was originally developed to treat leukemia in young, fit patients, due to its intensity, but has since begun to be used more widely. Indications Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy is generally reserved for use in the treatment of serious and aggressive forms of hematological malignancy. There are serious side effects and complications arising from the administration of the various agents, which require careful management in an appropriate health-care setting. Patients who receive hyper- CVAD receive a careful work-up to assess their overall wellness prior to the commencement of the regimen, in order to minimise undesirable outcomes. Patients considered for the protocol will generally be under 65. Administration Each course is given up to 4 times, with up to 8 cycles in total. Each cycle is approximately three weeks apart. The aim is to administer as many cycles as possible or necessary in as short a time as possible. Timing of cycles will be somewhat dependent on the patient's recovery from the last cycle. The regimen is usually administered on an in-patient basis, using a continuous venous access device such as a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), a Hickman line, or a port-a-cath. The following is only a general guide; the exact combination of drugs, doses, and protocols used for administration is generally determined on a facility-by-facility basis. Dosage is individualized, based on factors such as body weight, body surface area, and the overall health of the patient.  Course A  *Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), an alkylating agent, Days 1, 2, and 3 *Vincristine (Oncovin), a mitotic inhibitor, Days 4 and 11 *Doxorubicin (Adriamycin or Rubex), an antibiotic with anti-tumour effects, Day 4 *Dexamethasone (Decadron), an immunosuppressant, Days 1-4 and 11-14 *Cytarabine or Ara-C (Cytosar), an antimetabolite, Day 7 *Mesna (Uromitexan), a compound used to reduce the incidence of haemorrhagic cystitis, a common side effect of the administration of cyclophosphamide. It is generally given via intravenous infusion or orally at the same time as cyclophosphamide. *Methotrexate, an antimetabolite, may be given via the intrathecal route when it is necessary to get chemotherapy past the blood–brain barrier.  Course B  *Methotrexate, Day 1 *Leucovorin is used as a 'rescue' agent to prevent excessive cellular damage by methotrexate. *Sodium bicarbonate is used, beginning the day before methotrexate, to produce a mild metabolic alkalosis, desirable when administering large quantities of methotrexate. Urine pH values will be checked to ensure alkalosis prior to the commencement of methotrexate. *Cytarabine, Days 2 and 3 Side effects The side effects of the administration of the chemotherapeutic agents used in hyper-CVAD are complex, and are often dependent on the overall health of the patient. ;Hematologic and immune system The majority of patients will experience a degree of pancytopenia, including anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, due to the myelosuppressive effect of chemotherapy. Anaemia and thrombocytopenia can cause clinical problems, and transfusion of red blood cells and platelets may be necessary supportive therapies. Leukopenia, particularly neutropenia may lead to profound compromise of the immune system until the number of neutrophils recovers. Patients must therefore be vigilant to ensure that they report any fevers to their clinician. Anti-infective drugs are commonly given as a prophylaxis during and between cycles, to prevent against community-acquired infections. Patients are also at risk of hospital- acquired infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). It is not uncommon for patients to require hospitalisation to treat infections. ;Other side effects Temporary hair loss is a common side effect. Nausea and vomiting are commonly experienced both during and following administration. A variety of antiemetic drugs may be used, including granisetron, ondansetron, metoclopramide, and cyclizine. Vincristine sometimes causes chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and persistent condition involving tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs.

IS.40:2–1889 Linnaeus Tripe was born in Plymouth Dock (now Devonport), Devon, to Mary (1786–1842) and Cornelius (1785–1860). He was the ninth of twelve children. He joined the East India Company army in 1838, and in 1840, became a lieutenant based in the south of India. He returned to England in 1850, on a leave that was extended due to ill health until 1854. During this time he began to experiment with photography, and joined the Photographic Society of London in 1853. He returned to Bangalore, India, as a captain in June 1854. In December of that year he made his first photographs of India. In February of the following year he took part in the Madras Exhibition of Raw Products, Arts, and Manufactures of Southern India, displaying 68 photographs of previously unphotographed temples. The jury declared these photographs the \\"Best series of photographic views on paper.\\" He won a gold medal for his series of Calotypes, illustrating Burmese architecture and ornament. Further comment in the jury report, noted the artistic qualities in Tripe's works: > \\"...it would be supposed from the nature of Photography that all pictures > executed by its means must possess a similarity of style ; it is however a > curious fact, that this is not the case, the works by one operator being > perfectly distinct in character from those by another, even when the same > description of apparatus and the same process has been used ; this may be > observed, when two pictures have been taken by different exhibitors from the > same view — the best Indian Photographs in the Exhibition, those by Capt. > Tripe and Capt.

The mission was lead by Major Arthur Phayre, with Henry Yule as the secretary. Photography was becoming the preferred medium for creating a visual record for reasons of economy and accuracy. Tripe - already known as a photographer from his time in India, was chosen by Lord Dalhousie to accompany an official expedition to Ava, Burma to obtain representations of scenes and buildings. This visit resulted in the publication of Views of Burma. The Indian government requested that 50 sets of prints be produced and 20 were requisitioned by the Court of Directors of the East India Company. Of these, 7 complete sets are held in galleries, libraries and museums. Tripe returned to India and spent nearly 2 years printing the photographs, including painstaking retouching of clouds and skies, introducing an aesthetic into the documentary purpose.

In 1858, he took photographs of subjects of architectural or antiquarian interest, and pictures useful from a practical, engineering perspective. He exhibited 50 photographs from this tour in the annual exhibition of the Photographic Society of Madras in 1859. In March 1862 a series of his photographs were exhibited by Professor Archer at a meeting of the Photographic Society showing Poodoocotah, Madura, Ruakotta, Seringham, the Elliot Marbles, &c.;, &c.; Journal of the Photographic Society, 15 March 1862, p. 12 These photographs are now in the British Library, while the marbles are in the British Museum.Photos of the Elliot Marbles, Linnaeus Tripe, British Library, retrieved 19 December 2013 Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, control of India went to the British Crown, and in June 1859 Tripe was ordered not to undertake any new work. At the end of that year he was told to close the business and sell off the equipment. One of his assistants, C. Iyahswamy, also became a talented photographer. Return to the army In 1863 Tripe returned to the army and was continually promoted, becoming colonel in August 1873. Whilst in Lower Burma in February 1869 he made his two final series of photographs. Here he took photographs of landscapes made on glass negatives.

Personal life He was the son of Samuel and Mary White and was baptised at the Church of St. John in Bedwardine, Worcester, on 17 April 1775. At the age of 8, he was admitted to Christ's Hospital on the Presentation of Thomas Coventry on 19 September 1783. He left the school on 30 April 1790 in order to become a clerk in the treasurer's office at the school. While at the school, White formed a close and long-lasting friendship with Charles Lamb, who was the same age as he. Charles Lamb refers to James White in many of his letters and the Essays of Elia (in particular the essay entitled The Praise of Chimney-Sweepers). White developed a fascination with the character of Falstaff and was even known to dress up and go about \\"in character\\". This led to him writing and publishing in 1796 his only known book: Original Letters, etc, of Sir John Falstaff and his friends, a collection of letters supposed to have been written by Falstaff and his friends, found in an archive kept by Mistress Quickly's heirs. White died at his house in Burton Crescent (since renamed Cartwright Gardens in London on 13 March 1820. He was survived by his wife Margaret (daughter of Robert Faulder the bookseller) and three children. After his death, his business seems to have been initially managed by his wife, and was later taken over by his son Robert Faulder White. James White is a great-great-grandfather of the author T. H. White (1906-1964) and Roger Bushell. Publishing In 1800 he founded an advertising company in Warwick Square, which subsequently moved in 1808 to 33 Fleet Street, London and became R. F.

He first appears in the records in 1344 holding a church in East Lothian, and in 1351 attains national prominence as the new Bishop of Brechin. Bishop Patrick, who would be a core supporter of King David II of Scotland, became Royal Chancellor in the same decade. He held the chancellorship until around 1370, and the bishopric of Brechin until 1383, when he resigned it on account of his old age. Biography =Early career= It is likely that Leuchars came from Fife, primarily because his name connects him with the settlement at Leuchars, located in that province.Duncan, \\"Leuchars, Patrick\\". He does not seem to have been university educated, a surprising fact given both the abundance of graduates in Scotland at the time and given Leuchars career as a senior royal administrator, a testament perhaps to the quality of non-university education that was available in Scotland at the time, perhaps in Patrick's case at St Andrews Cathedral Priory.He is never styled \\"Master\\" or like; he was omitted from Professor D. E. R. Watt's A Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Graduates to A. D. 1410, (Oxford, 1977). In 1344, he became parson of the important parish church of Tyninghame, East Lothian, a parsonage within the patronage of St Andrews Cathedral Priory, of which Leuchars was a canon.Dowden, Bishops, p. 182; Duncan, \\"Leuchars, Patrick\\". At some time in the following seven years, Leuchars took over the parish of Tannadice, a settlement to the north of Forfar in Angus; he probably obtained Tannadice on exchange for Tyninghame, though there is no record of this. He seems to have been a close protégé of Adam de Moravia, the Bishop of Brechin in the 1330s and most of the 1340s.Penman, David II, p. 176; Adam, like Leuchars later, was Chancellor of Scotland in addition to being Bishop of Brechin. =Bishop of Brechin and Chancellor of Scotland= On 17 November 1351, Leuchars himself received papal provision to the bishopric of Brechin.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 54. This followed an election earlier in the year which Pope Clement VI had quashed because the bishopric had been reserved for direct papal appointment during the brief episcopate of Leuchars' predecessor Philip Wilde - there was obviously no practical implication regarding the result.Dowden, Bishops, p. 182. Patrick had received consecration - probably at Avignon - from Bertrand de Déaulx, Cardinal Bishop of Sabina, by 11 December.Dowden, Bishops, p. 182; Duncan, \\"Leuchars, Patrick\\"; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 54. Leuchars appears in the records as Chancellor of Scotland in the months between March and December 1353, perhaps having been appointed during the visit to Scotland of the king, David II of Scotland, who was briefly released from English captivity for some months in 1351/2; Leuchars was definitely not exercising his office of Chancellor by 12 February 1354, perhaps because of his lack of favour with the Regent, Robert Stewart, who held power from 1354 until David's return in 1357. Leuchars was back in office after the king's return, regaining the Chancellorship by 26 September 1357. Thereafter, Leuchars retained the Chancellorship until sometime after, not more than a few months after, 4 March 1370; he was succeeded in this position later in the year by John de Carrick.Duncan, \\"Leuchars, Patrick\\"; MacQueen, \\"Carrick, John (d. 1380/81)\\"; Penman, David II, p. 399. Leuchars is usually characterised as a steadfast supporter of the king, and he can be found throughout his period as Chancellor attending to royal administration and close to the king.Duncan, \\"Leuchars, Patrick\\"; Penman, David II, passim. He witnessed dozens of royal charters, attended parliaments and councils, and sat on the exchequer until 1369.Dowden, Bishops,p. 183; Duncan, \\"Leuchars, Patrick\\"; Penman, David II, passim. He also engaged on occasional diplomatic activity. On 13 December 1356, he and a number of other bishops were granted safe conducts to travel to London, in order to participate on a deal over the king's proposed ransom.Penman, David II, pp. 186-7. Along with four other dignitaries he participated in an embassy to the French, for which these men were issued a safe-conduct in July 1360.Penman, David II, p .250, n. 23. =Resignation & death= On 31 May 1383, Pope Clement VII (of Avignon) provided Stephen de Cellario to the bishopric of Brechin; the mandate of provision noted that Stephen was already bishop-elect and present at the papal curia, and that Patrick had freely resigned the bishopric.Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 89; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 40, gives 12 June, in which he was followed by Duncan, \\"Leuchars, Patrick\\"; the date given is 2 Kal Jun., anno 5. On 20 June, two indults and a grant of a pension were made to Patrick, and the grant notes that he had resigned the see because of \\"his advanced age and infirmity\\".Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 94; Dowden, Bishops, p. 183. Contrary to what was stated by Duncan, he was not present at the papal see, as the grant of the pension explicitly states that it was resigned \\"to Pierre d'Ameil, cardinal priest of S. Marco, at the papal court by the bishop's special proxy\\".Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 94; c/f Duncan, \\"Leuchars, Patrick\\". The pension was an annual one of 100 marks, and was to be taken from Brechin episcopal revenues; one indult allowed Patrick to continue wearing episcopal vesture, while the other was an indult for plenary remission of sins, indicating that Patrick expected death.Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 94. Patrick was never heard of again after that date.

He held these board memberships in addition to his day job in the Public Service. On completing his apprenticeship he was appointed Costs Officer in the Government Printing Office. On 6 April 1935 he married Cecilie Marion Cripps at St. Georges Church, Battery Point; they had one daughter and one son. In 1946 Thwaites accepted the position of Administrative Officer of the Photographic Branch of the Lands and Surveys Department. In 1958 he took up a full-time appointment as Inspector of Scenic Reserves for the Scenery Preservation Board (forerunner to the National Parks and Wildlife Service). He held the joint positions of Secretary and Superintendent of Scenic Reserves for the Scenery Preservation Board at the time of his retirement in 1967. By nature a man of peace, Jack chose to avoid confrontation wherever possible. Nevertheless, he fought tirelessly for the preservation of Tasmania's wilderness regions throughout his life. An amiable personality and courteous, self-effacing manner endeared him to people from all walks of life. A great raconteur, Jack drew on an inexhaustible fund of bush experiences and personalities as he dispensed billy tea round the campfire. An untiring belief in young people and his work with them stands today as one of his most valued gifts to the community. In 1977 he was awarded the Order of Australia medal for his conservation work. Jack was an active member of many organizations throughout his life – Tasmanian Field Naturalists Club, Royal Society of Tasmania, Tasmanian Historical Research Association (THRA) and the Royal Geographical Society. His greatest contributions, however, were made to Youth Hostels of Australia (YHA) and to the Hobart Walking Club. At the latter he held every position in the club from its foundation in 1929 until his death in 1986. He was made third Honorary Life Member of the Hobart Walking Club in 1948. In later life his charismatic personality and courteous demeanour led many walkers to address him, endearingly, as 'Gentleman Jack'. He remained an active bushwalker and conservationist until his death in 1986.

Tradition records that Cináed was born half-blind to his mother Muirenn (died 748), after Saint Adomnán cursed his father Írgalach's descendants for the killing of Niall mac Cernaig Sotal (died 701) of the rival Uí Chernaig sept of South Brega.

His birth name was Percival Davis, and he was also known as Clifford Gray. Grey contributed prolifically to West End and Broadway shows, as librettist and lyricist for composers including Ivor Novello, Jerome Kern, Howard Talbot, Ivan Caryll and George Gershwin. Among his best-remembered songs are two from early in his career, in 1916: \\"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\\" and \\"Another Little Drink Wouldn't Do Us Any Harm\\". His later hits include \\"Got a Date with an Angel\\" and \\"Spread a Little Happiness\\". For 35 years after 1979 it was widely believed that Grey secretly competed as an American bobsleigher, under the name Clifford \\"Tippy\\" Gray, in two Winter Olympics, in 1928 and 1932, winning gold medals, but it was finally shown that the sportsman was a different person. Life and career =Early years= Grey was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, the son of George Davis, a whip manufacturer, and his wife Emma, née Lowe. He was educated at the Camp Hill Boys School and the King Edward VI School.Moore, James Ross, Clifford (1887–1941)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; accessed 28 August 2010. Bull, Andy. \\"It's just not cricket: The Mystery of Clifford Grey, Olympic Champion Who Never Was\\", The Guardian, 5 May 2015 On leaving school in 1903 he had a variety of office jobs, in none of which he had any success. He became a pierrot with a local concert party, and adopted the stage name Clifford Grey, performing in pubs, piers and music halls. By the time he married in 1912 he had reduced his stage performing in favour of writing lyrics for West End shows. His wife was Dorothy Maud Mary Gould (1890 or 1891–1940), a fellow member of the concert party. They had two daughters, June and Dorothy; Grey also adopted Gould's daughter. Their marriage lasted until Dorothy's death. In 1916 Grey had his big breakthrough as a writer, collaborating with the American composer Nat Ayer on The Bing Boys Are Here, a long-running revue that opened in London in April, and contained two of Grey's early successes, \\"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\\" and \\"Another Little Drink Wouldn't Do Us Any Harm\\". He collaborated with Ayer on Pell-Mell, The Bing Girls Are There, The Other Bing Boys, The Bing Brothers on Broadway, and Yes, Uncle! and with Herman Finck in Hallo, America!, Ivor Novello and Jerome Kern in Theodore & Co, Howard Talbot and Novello in Who's Hooper?, Novello in Arlette (1917) and Ivan Caryll in Kissing Time.\\"Grey, Clifford\\", Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Oxford University Press, 11 July 2006, Oxford Music Online, accessed 28 August 2010. On the last show he collaborated with P.G. Wodehouse,Jason, p, 82 who was privately lukewarm about Grey's talent, regarding him as a specialist in adapting other people's work rather than as an original talent. At the same time, he acted in a dozen silent films, including The Crucible (1914), The Weakness of Strength (1916), Madame Cubist (1916), The Best Man (1917), Carnival (1921) and The Man from Home (1922).\\"Clifford Grey\\", British Film Institute, accessed 2 November 2015 =1920s – Broadway and Hollywood= In 1920 Grey was invited to New York by Kern to renew their collaboration, writing Florenz Ziegfeld's Sally. Grey remained in the US for most of the decade, with occasional sorties back to London for Phi-Phi with Henri Christiné (1922), The Smith Family with Ayer (1922), and The Rainbow with George Gershwin (1923). For Broadway, he provided a regular stream of lyrics – and some libretti – for musical comedies and revues. His collaborators included Sigmund Romberg and Melville Gideon on some of the less-remembered shows, Ivan Caryll and Guy Bolton on The Hotel Mouse (1922),The New York Times, March 14, 1922, p. 20 Vincent Youmans on Hit the Deck (1927), and Rudolph Friml and Wodehouse on The Three Musketeers (1928) and Ups-A-Daisy with Robert A. Simon for the Shubert Theatre (1928). The introduction of talking pictures attracted Grey to Hollywood. He collaborated with Victor Schertzinger on the 1929 Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald film, The Love Parade, and with Oscar Straus on The Smiling Lieutenant (1931), and contributed to films with a range of stars from Ramon Novarro to Lawrence Tibbett to Marion Davies. His songs and lyrics from shows were used in many films, and he wrote screenplays and lyrics for fourteen new Hollywood films between 1929 and 1931, including The Vagabond Lover (1929), In Gay Madrid (1930) and The Smiling Lieutenant (1931). After his death Grey's songs continued to be used in films and television productions. His best known song, \\"If You Were the Only Girl (in the World)\\", appeared in such films as Lilacs in the Spring (1954), The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and The Cat's Meow (2001), and some films, such as Hit the Deck (1955), were adaptations of his shows. In 1929, he returned temporarily to London, where he collaborated with Vivian Ellis on the musical Mr Cinders, which had a long West End run and featured one of Grey's best-remembered songs, \\"Spread a Little Happiness\\". =Olympian bobsleigher myth= Inscription on the stone laid on Grey's grave in 2005 including the erroneously attributed Olympic gold medals After an article written in 1979 by an American journalist, Tim Clark, in Yankee Magazine, it was believed for more than three decades that Grey had competed, secretly, for the US Olympic bobsleigh team in 1928 and 1932 under the name Clifford \\"Tippy\\" (or \\"Tippi\\") Gray. Many news sources and biographers accepted this idea, based on circumstantial evidence that Clark had found. The evidence also persuaded Grey's daughters that their late father was not only the peripatetic writer that they remembered, but also a secret world-class sportsman who had been too modest to boast of his Olympic success. The press thereafter widely reported that Grey the librettist had also won a gold medal in the five-man bobsleigh race at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, another at the following Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, this time in the four-man event, and a bronze medal in the four-man race at the 1937 FIBT World Championships in St. Moritz.Stewart, Graham. \\"With a song – and a bobsleigh – in his heart\\", The Times, 11 February 2006 In the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography the historian James Ross Moore concluded that during Grey's New York years: There were a few who did not accept that \\"Tippi\\" Gray was the same person as Clifford Grey the writer. The Olympic historian David Wallechinsky was one, and John Cross, a researcher from Bowdoin College, was another.\\"Clifford Barton 'Cliff' Gray\\", SR/Olympics, Sports Reference LLC, accessed 2 November 2012 Finally, around 2013, Andy Bull, a sportswriter for The Guardian, was writing a book about the 1932 gold medal-winning bobsleigh team that was published in 2015 under the title Speed Kings.Bull, Andy. Speed Kings, Bantam Press (2015) Although Bull had earlier accepted the story, as he looked closer, he became suspicious. He found an interview with \\"Tippy\\" Gray from 1948 in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, seven years after Grey's death.Sarasota Herald-Tribune, 9 March 1948, p. 11 \\"Tippy\\" Gray, the Olympic champion, died in April 1968 in San Diego, California. Bull wrote: =West End, films and last years= Returning to England in 1932, although apparently spending time in California, Grey concentrated thereafter on the West End stage and British films. His screenplay for Rome Express (1932), a spy story, was \\"extremely popular in its day and virtually created a subgenre\\". He wrote more than twenty screenplays for British films, usually for the popular comedians of the day, but also including My Song Goes Round the World (1934), Mimi (1935), an adaptation of La Bohème, for Gertrude Lawrence and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Yes, Madam? (1940). Throughout the decade Grey had shows running in the West End, written in collaboration with previous collaborators and new ones including Oscar Levant, Johnny Green and Noel Gay. Grey wrote more than 3,000 songs.Daniels, Robert L. (31 July 2006). \\"Jazz in July – Twelve Hands, Two Pianos, One Night\\", Daily Variety (New York, N.Y., Reed Business Information) 31 July 2006, pp. 7–8 When the Second World War began, Grey joined the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), which took shows round the country and overseas to provide relief for serving members of the armed forces. In 1941 he was presenting a concert party in Ipswich, Suffolk, when the town was heavily bombed. Grey died two days later, aged 54, as a result of a heart attack, brought on by the bombing, and exacerbated by asthma.

Batanaea or Batanea (the Hellenized/Latinised form of Bashan) was an area of the Biblical Holy Land, north-east of the Jordan River, to the west of Trachonitis. It was one of the four post-Exile divisions of the area of Bashan. Today, Batanaea is more commonly called Nuqrah,F.E. Peters (1977).

It is, on average, 12 miles wide, and for 30 miles along it extends the Gebel Hauran, a range of hills, whose central plateau is 2670 ft. above sea level and whose highest point is 6400 ft. Its highest peak may be the \\"Hill of Basan\\" referred to in . In the 1st century BCE the land was acquired by Herod the Great, and on his death in 4 BCE passed to his son Philip as part of his inheritance. In some sources Philip is referred to as \\"Tetrarch of Batanea\\" with the capital at Caesarea Philippi, though his lands were more extensive than this. On his death in 34 CE Batanea became briefly part of the Roman province of Syria, but in 37 CE was established as a kingdom and passed to king Herod Agrippa I, and in 53 CE to his son, king Herod Agrippa II. Following his death, however, it was once again annexed to the Roman province of Syria. New Testament D. A. Carson, in his commentary on the Gospel of John, says that the \\"Bethany across the Jordan\\" of , is actually \\"Batanaea\\", transliterated across Aramaic to Greek. Thus it is distinct from the other, more prominent Bethany in the gospels. This contradicts the general consensus, which is that Bethany across the Jordan is situated on the Jordan River near Jericho, on either the east or west bank of the river.

STOA The Parliament's Science and Technology Options Assessment unit, whose work is carried out in partnership with external experts. Tindemans report A report written in 1975 by the former Belgian Prime Minister Leo Tindemans. Notably, the report contained proposals for direct elections to the European Parliament, the Monetary Union and the Common Foreign and Security policy. =Council of the European Union= The Council of Ministers comprises the representatives of each of the 28 member states at Ministerial level, chaired by the President. The work of the Council is prepared by the two Corepers – the Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper II), and the Committee of Deputy Permanent Representatives (Coreper I). Their work is in turn prepared by various working groups, working parties and committees. A Points Also known as 'A Items', these are items of business and decisions which the Council of Ministers adopts without discussion because they have already been prepared by working groups, Coreper, and in some cases another configuration of the Council. They may cover issues unrelated to the Council itself e.g. Health and Safety 'A' points can be passed by the Fisheries Council. This is because the Council is indivisible. Accession Treaty The Treaty of Accession 1972 was the agreement between the European Communities and four countries (Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom) concerning their accession to the EC.

During such negotiations, the Commission consults the Trade Policy Committee.  Article 36 Committee (CATS)  This committee was set up by Article 36 of the EU Treaty, and co-ordinates police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Additionally, it submits opinions to the Council and contributes to the preparation of Council work. It is now officially known as the Coordinating Committee in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. B Points These are the agenda items which the Council will discuss. 'Starred B points' are ones where a vote may be taken. 'False B points' are agenda items which would otherwise be 'A points' except that one or more delegations wish to make a statement in the meeting. CARDS The Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development, and Stabilisation (CARDS) programme is the EU's main instrument of financial assistance to the Western Balkans, and was created in 2000 by Council Regulation 2666/2000.

The criteria require that a state have the institutions to preserve democratic governance and human rights, a functioning market economy, and that the state accept the obligations and intent of the EU. Dublin Convention An inter-governmental agreement between EU member states on asylum, obliging the country in which an asylum seeker arrives to handle the application for asylum on behalf of all other member states. The objective was to prevent asylum seekers from launching multiple asylum requests. The agreement was reached in 1990 but became binding only in 1997. EFC The Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) was introduced with the Maastricht Treaty as part of the EMU (Economic and Monetary Union), and is a committee of senior representatives of member states' finance ministries and central banks, plus representatives of the ECB and the Commission. The EFC prepares the work of the Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) Council, in particular regarding excessive deficit procedures and issues related to the euro. The EFC meets in different compositions according to subjects, and select issues are prepared for the EFC by the alternate members. EPC The Economic Policy Committee (EPC) was set up in 1974 and is made up of representatives of the Member States, the ECB and the Commission. The EPC contributes to the work of the Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) Council as regards the coordination of Member State and Community economic policies. The EPC also provides the Commission and the Council with advice in this area, focusing particularly on structural reforms. The EPC features a number of sub-working groups on issues such as the economic consequences of ageing etc. ECOFIN The Economic and Financial Affairs (ECOFIN) Council is composed of the Economics and Finance Ministers of the 28 European Union member states, as well as Budget Ministers when budgetary issues are discussed. European Conference The European Conference was the name of the meeting that brought together 10 countries aspiring to join the EU. It met for the first time in London on 12 March 1998, then in Luxembourg on 6 October 1998 and then finally in Brussels on 19 July 1999. Fouchet Plan The Fouchet Plan was drawn up by Christian Fouchet as Charles De Gaulle's unofficial spokesman for European affairs. The Fouchet Plan aimed at restructuring the European Community into a voluntary union of member states with a new headquarters in Paris, and by subjecting EU law to national law. The rejection of the Fouchet Plan by the other 5 member states had far-reaching consequences, such as the vetoing of the UK's entry into the EU, the \\"empty chair\\" crisis, and the \\"Luxembourg Compromise\\". Gymnich meeting Helsinki six The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 authorised accession negotiations with six candidate countries: Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia. These countries are therefore known as the \\"Helsinki six\\". Ioannina Compromise An informal meeting of foreign ministers held in Ioannina, Greece, on 29 March 1994, which discussed Council decision making and the national veto. The Treaty of Nice has since put an end to what was agreed in the Ioannina compromise. ISPA The Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA) was created by the Berlin European Council of March 1999 for increasing pre-accession aid in the field of transport and environment to European Union accession candidate countries. Luxembourg compromise The Luxembourg compromise was a compromise (not recognised by the European Commission nor the European Court of Justice) that extended the lifespan of the national veto beyond what was foreseen in the Treaty of Rome. It originated from the \\"empty chair crisis\\" instigated by President De Gaulle, and its effect was that Qualified Majority Voting was used far less often and Unanimity became the norm. Luxembourg six The Luxembourg European Council in December 1997 authorised accession negotiations with six candidate countries: Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia. These countries are therefore known as the \\"Luxembourg six\\". Merger Treaty The Merger Treaty, signed in Brussels on 8 April 1965 and in force from 1 July 1967, provided for a single Commission and a single Council of the then three European Communities (European Coal and Steel Community, European Economic Community and Euratom). Mertens Group The Mertens Group fulfils the same role as Antici for Coreper I (Deputies). It was established in 1993. PHARE The Poland and Hungary: Assistance for Restructuring their Economies (PHARE) programme was created in 1989 to assist Poland and Hungary in their preparations for joining the European Union. Population Filter For a decision taken by a qualified majority, any country can ask the Council to check that the countries in favour represent at least 62% of the total EU population. SAPARD The Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD) was established by the Berlin European Council in March 1999 to aid the countries of central and eastern Europe in the areas of agricultural and rural development. It supplemented the PHARE program. Schengen Agreement The Schengen Agreement, dealing with cross-border legal arrangements and the abolition of systematic border controls among the participating countries, was created independently of the European Union. However, the Treaty of Amsterdam incorporated the developments brought about by the agreement into the European Union framework, effectively making the agreement part of the EU. Subsidiarity The principle of subsidiarity in the European Union is that decisions are retained by Member States if the intervention of the European Union is not necessary. The European Union takes action collectively only when Member States’ power is insufficient. The principle of subsidiarity applied to the European Union can be summarised as \\"Europe where necessary, national where possible\\". =European Commission= The European Commission is independent of national governments and its job is to represent and uphold the interests of the European Union as a whole. It drafts proposals for new European laws, which it presents to the European Parliament and the Council. It is also the EU's executive arm, responsible for implementing the decisions of Parliament and the Council, implementing its policies, running its programmes and spending its funds. Like the Parliament and Council, the European Commission was set up in the 1950s under the EU's founding treaties. ACP African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP), beneficiaries of the European Development Fund (EDF).

Acquis Communautaire The body of Community law, as well as all acts adopted under the second and third pillars of the European Union and the common objectives laid down in the Treaties. CFCU The Central Financing and Contracting Unit (CFCU) is a body setup in all enlargement candidate countries for the administration of budgets, tendering, contracts, payments, accounting and financial reporting of all procurement contracts for EU funded programmes. It is a body of the government of the candidate country, and not of the European Commission. However, the EC representation in the candidate country receives regular reports on its activities. Checchini Report In 1988, a study called \\"The Costs of Non-Europe\\" was commissioned to evaluate the gains achieved from creating the European Single Market, and since known as the \\"Checchini Report\\". Although its growth projections were too optimistic, it nevertheless predicted that the single market would be a great success. Competence See Subsidiarity (European Union)#EU competences ECSC The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was founded by the Treaty of Paris (1951). Its members were France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands who pooled their steel and coal resources and create a common market for those products. It was the predecessor of the European Communities. The ECSC was abolished in 2002. Élysée Treaty The Élysée Treaty also known as the Treaty of Friendship, was concluded by Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer in 1963, and established a process of reconciliation for ending the rivalry between France and Germany. EDF The European Development Fund is the main instrument for European Community aid for development cooperation in the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, as well as the Oversees Countries and Territories (OCT). Europe Agreement Europe Agreement is the common name of the Accession Agreement that implies prospects for EU membership. de Larosière report The de Larosière report, issued by a panel led by the former French central banker Jacques de Larosière, calls for an overhaul of Europes financial-regulation system. It proposes the creation of a regional supervisor, the European Systemic Risk Council, which would be led by the president of the European Central Bank and include central bankers from across Europe and some national regulators. The report was ordered by the European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and was issued in February 2009. Messina Conference The Messina Conference was held in Messina, Italy, in 1955 and discussed the subject of a customs union.

Single European Act The Single European Act (SEA) was the first major revision of the Treaty of Rome establishing ECC, and aimed at creating the Single European Market by 31 December 1992. Stuttgart Declaration The Stuttgart Declaration was the solemn declaration calling for the creation of the European Union and signed by the then 10 heads of state and governments on 19 June 1983. =ECJ= The Court of Justice ensures that EU law is interpreted and applied in the same way in all EU countries, and that the law is equal for everyone. For example, it provides a check on that national courts do not give different rulings on the same issue. The Court also ensures that EU member states and institutions do what the law requires them to do. The Court is located in Luxembourg and has one judge from each member country. Bosmans case In the Bosmans case (Case C-415/93, 15 December 1995), the Court ruled against the application of transfer rules between football clubs (in Eu member states) after the contract for the player has expired. The Court also ruled against quotas for non-nationals within football teams in EU member states. Casagrande case In the Casagrande case (Case 9/74, 3 July 1974), the Court ruled that discrimination against persons in the educational system was illegal. Prior to this ruling, education was not considered covered by the European Treaties. Homestate regulation Homestate regulation is a term used in EU law for cross-border selling or marketing of goods and services. The ruling states that even if a company sells goods or services into the market of another European country, the company is bound only by the laws of the country where it is based, and will thus not have to be aware of the national laws in all the EU member states. Kupferberg case In the Kupferberg case (Case 104/81, 26 October 1982), the Court ruled that free trade agreements are directly applicable in all EU member states, and therefore automatically have primacy over national law. Marleasing case In the Marleasing case (Case C-106/89, 13 November 1990, and C-91/92, 14 July 1994) the Court ruled that EU member states must interpret national legislation according to EU directives, even if the directives have not yet been incorporated into the legal code of the country. Preliminary ruling This is the procedure by which a national court, when in doubt about the interpretation or validity of an EU law, should (or must) ask the Court of Justice for advice. =European Court of Auditors= The European Court of Auditors is a body (rather than a true court) established somewhat belatedly after the realisation that, given the huge size of funds circulating within the EU, some oversight was needed to avoid corruption and misuse of money. In particular, the Great Sicilian Olive Scandal (where satellite photos revealed that there were far fewer Sicilian olive trees than the number of olive tree subsidy claims) spurred the setting up of this body. =Ombudsman= The European Ombudsman investigates complaints about maladministration in the institutions and bodies of the European Union. The Ombudsman is completely independent and impartial. The current Ombudsman is Mr P. Nikiforos Diamandouros was elected by the European Parliament and has held office since 1 April 2003.

Werner Plan At the European Summit in The Hague in 1969, the Heads of State and Government of the EC agreed to prepare a plan for the creation of an economic and monetary union. In October 1970 the Werner Report was presented, drawn up by a working group chaired by Luxembourg's president and Minister for the Treasury, Pierre Werner. However, for several reasons, the monetary union failed at this stage, mainly due to 1973 oil crisis. =European Investment Bank (and European Investment Fund)= The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the European Union's nonprofit long-term lending institution established in 1958 under the Treaty of Rome. As a \\"policy-driven bank\\" whose shareholders are the member states of the EU, the EIB uses its financing operations to bring about European integration and social cohesion. It should not be confused with the European Central Bank. The EIB is a publicly owned international financial institution and its shareholders are the EU member states. Thus the member states set the bank's broad policy goals and oversee the two independent decision-making bodies—the board of governors and the board of directors. Advisory bodies =EESC= The European Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body of the European Union (EU) established in 1958. It is an advisory assembly composed of \\"social partners\\", namely: employers (employers' organisations), employees (trade unions) and representatives of various other interests. Its seat, which it shares with the Committee of the Regions, is the Jacques Delors building on 99 Rue Belliard in Brussels. Once known by the acronym \\"EcoSoc\\", the body is now referred to as the \\"EESC\\", to avoid confusions with the United Nations ECOSOC. While the it has undoubtedly performed good works in its time, the EESC has arguably outlived its usefulness and should be dismantled. =CoR= The European Committee of the Regions is the EU assembly of local and regional representatives that provides sub-national authorities (i.e. regions, counties, provinces, municipalities and cities) with a direct voice within the EU's institutional framework. Established in 1994, the CoR was set up to acknowledge the significance of the regions, some of which, such as Andalusia, are larger than some Member States, e.g., Malta or Luxembourg. Interinstitutional bodies =Office for Official Publications of the European Communities= The Office for Official Publications of the European Communities (Publications Office) is the publishing house of the European Union (EU). OJ The Official Journal (OJ) of the European Union is published daily in more than 21 languages.

It was created on 26 July 2002, beginning work in 2003, to organise open competitions for highly skilled positions within EU institutions such as the European Commission, Parliament, Council. =European Administrative School= The European Administrative School (EAS) came into existence on 10 February 2005. Its aim is to promote cooperation between European Union institutions in the area of training, to support the spread of common values and harmonised professional practices, and to create synergies in the use of human and financial resources. Decentralised bodies of the European Union (agencies) =Community agencies= A Community agency is a body governed by European public law; it is distinct from the Community Institutions (Council, Parliament, Commission, etc.) and has its own legal personality. It is set up by an act of secondary legislation to accomplish a very specific technical, scientific or managerial task, in the framework of the European Union's \\"first pillar\\". At present, the European Community agencies are: * Community Fisheries Control Agency (CFCA) * Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) * European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (EU- OSHA) * European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (FRONTEX) * European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) * European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) * European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop) * European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) * European Environment Agency (EEA) * European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) * European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND) * European GNSS Supervisory Authority (GSA) * European Institute for Gender Equality (under preparation) * European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) * European Medicines Agency (EMA) – previously EMEA * European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) * European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) * European Railway Agency (ERA) * European Training Foundation (ETF) * Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) – previously EUMC * Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) (OHIM) * Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union (CdT) Common Foreign and Security Policy =Common Position= The legal instruments used by the Council for the CFSP are different from the legislative acts. Under the CFSP they consist of \\"common positions\\", \\"joint actions\\" and \\"common strategies\\". =Common Strategies= The legal instruments used by the Council for the CFSP are different from the legislative acts.

The CSDP is the successor of the ESDI under NATO, but differs in that it falls under the jurisdiction of the European Union itself, including countries with no ties to NATO. =EDC= The European Defence Community (EDC) was a plan proposed in 1950 by René Pleven, the French Prime Minister, in response to the American call for the rearmament of West Germany. The intention was to form a pan-European defence force as an alternative to Germany's proposed accession to NATO, meant to harness its military potential in case of conflict with the Soviet bloc. The EDC was to include West Germany, France, Italy, and the Benelux countries. A treaty was signed on 27 May 1952, but the plan never went into effect. =ESDP= See CSDP =EUISS= The European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) was created by a Council Joint Action on 20 July 2001. It has the status of an autonomous agency that comes under the EU's second \\"pillar\\" – the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Having an autonomous status and intellectual freedom, the EUISS does not represent or defend any particular national interest. Its aim is to help create a common European security culture, to enrich the strategic debate, and systematically to promote the interests of the Union. =EUMC= The European Union Military Committee (EUMC) is a department of military officials under the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Political and Security Committee (PSC) of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy. The EUMC gives military advice to the PSC and the high representative. It also oversees the European Union Military Staff. (Not to be confused with the former racism monitoring centre, also EUMC, now subsumed into the Fundamental Rights Agency.) =EUMS= The European Union Military Staff (EUMS) is a department of the European Union, responsible for supervising operations within the realm of the Common Security and Defence Policy. It is directly attached to the private office of the High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, currently Javier Solana, and is formally part of the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union. =EUSC= The European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC) was founded in 1992 and incorporated as an agency into the European Union on 1 January 2002. The Centre supports the decision–making of the European Union in the field of the CFSP, in particular of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) by providing analysis of satellite imagery and collateral data, aerial imagery, and other related services. The European Union Satellite Centre is located in Torrejón de Ardoz, near Madrid, Spain. =FAC= The Foreign Affairs Council is a formation of the Council of the European Union which discusses foreign affairs matters. It also meets in different sub-formations, such as Defence, Development, or Trade, when discussing specific issues. =GAERC= The General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) used to be a formation of the Council of the European Union. It has now been split into two formations: the General Affairs Council (GAC) and the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) =Joint Action= The legal instruments used by the Council for the CFSP are different from the legislative acts. Under the CFSP they consist of \\"common positions\\", \\"joint actions\\" and \\"common strategies\\". =Pleven Plan= The Pleven Plan was a plan proposed in 1950 by the French premier at the time, René Pleven, to create a supranational European Army as part of a European Defence Community. =PSC= A Political and Security Committee (PSC) monitors the international situation in the areas covered by the Common Foreign and Security Policy and contributes by delivering opinions to the Council of Ministers, either at its request or its own initiative, and also monitors the implementation of agreed policies.

This is especially used in enlargement matters, to help the candidate member state to acquire the structures, human resources and management skills needed to implement the 'acquis communautaire'. Yaoundé Convention The Yaoundé Convention, and Association Agreement valid for 5 years, was signed in Yaoundé, Cameroon in 1963, between the European Community and 17 African States and Madagascar. See also =Organisations that are not part of the European Union institutions, bodies or agencies= Council of Europe The Council of Europe (CoE) is not related to the European Union (EU). For the two EU institutions that go by similar names, see the Council of the European Union (known as \\"the Council\\") and the European Council. The Council of Europe (French: Conseil de l'Europe) is the oldest international organisation working towards European integration, being founded in 1949. It has a particular emphasis on legal standards, human rights, democratic development, the rule of law and cultural co-operation. EFTA The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) is a European trade bloc which was established on 3 May 1960 as an alternative for European states who were either unable to, or chose not to, join the then-European Economic Community (now the European Union). Today only Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein remain members of EFTA (of which only Norway and Switzerland are founding members). Three of the EFTA countries are part of the European Union Internal Market through the Agreement on a European Economic Area (EEA), which took effect in 1994; the fourth, Switzerland, opted to conclude bilateral agreements with the EU. OSCE The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OCSE) is the world's largest security-oriented intergovernmental organisation. Its mandate includes issues such as arms control, human rights, freedom of the press, and fair elections. The OSCE is an ad hoc organisation under the United Nations Charter (Chap. VIII). The EU is not strictly speaking a member of the OCSE, although the Commission president Jacques Delors signed the Charter of Paris for a New Europe (1990), which is the origin of the OCSE. The Nordic Council The Nordic Council is an advisory body to the Nordic parliaments and governments, established in 1953, dealing with economic, legislative, social, cultural, environmental and communication policies. =Related articles= * Agencies of the European Union * Bodies of the European Union * Institutions of the European Union References Category:European Union Category:Glossaries of politics ","title":"Glossary of European Union concepts, acronyms, and jargon"},{"id":"13906009","text":"Tomi Milardovic (born 6 August 1982 in Melbourne, Victoria) is an Australian footballer who plays for Pascoe Vale.

The school holds specialist academy status, and was awarded a Grade 1 (Outstanding) in the 2011 Ofsted report. The school caters for students studying for Key Stage 3, GCSE, AS and A-level examinations. The chosen patron saint is Catholic martyr Saint Nicholas Owen, and the school is divided into houses named after saints: Anselm, Bede, Chad, Gregory, Kenelm, and Wulstan. In 2007, the school agreed to work in correspondence with Haybridge High School, located over the road, to share teaching in the less commonly chosen subjects by students. The schools have shared common ground for sporting events for some time. Hagley Catholic High School obtains impressive examination results for its pupils. According to BBC league tables, the school has the 6th highest performance rate of the 20 or so state schools in the county, based on GCSE results, with 73% of students in 2010 gaining 5+ GCSEs A* to C including Maths and English. History The Catholic community in Worcestershire first began collecting funds to build a secondary school in 1942. Hagley Roman Catholic Secondary School was opened in 1959 (the current name was adopted when the school became comprehensive in 1974). Originally the school was to be built in Stourport-on-Severn, but land was donated in Hagley. In 1969, in the building which would later become Lab 5, a full-scale replica of a Bristol Scout aeroplane was built by five pupils and their history teacher. The aeroplane could only be removed when the window frames were removed. Though A-Levels had been taught in the school since the 1960s, they became an important part of the curriculum in the 1970s. A sixth form common room and adjacent teaching rooms were built in 1976, and pupils began regularly to go on to university.Hagley RC High School web site Retrieved 15 June 2009 An extensive collection of catalogued records relating to the history of the school can be found in the library.

Several memorials were put in place, including a stained glass window in the entrance foyer, and several charities were also formed. One of the consequences of the crash was the launch of a national campaign to improve safety and driving standards for Passenger Carrying Vehicles (PCV). The huge number of letters which were sent to the school in the weeks after this event were placed for safekeeping in the care of Worcestershire County Archives in 2012.

He is mostly known for his work on the Z3, one of the first computers. Helmut Schreyer was the son of the minister Paul Schreyer and Martha. When his father started to work in a parish in Mosbach, the young Schreyer went to a school there. He earned his Abitur in 1933. He then worked as an intern at AEG. Schreyer started to study electronic and telecommunications engineering at the Technical University of Berlin in 1934. He got to know Konrad Zuse in the fraternity AV Motiv in 1935 and then helped him to construct the computer Z1. In 1938 he earned his diploma and then worked as a graduate assistant at Prof. Wilhelm Stäblein's institute. Schreyer belonged, together with Herbert Raabe (1909–2004), to the first assistants of Wilhelm Stäblein, who had worked at AEG's research division until 1936. During WWII Schreyer was not drafted because his work was considered essential to the war effort. Schreyer e.g. worked on detection technology for unexploded ordnance. He then worked on the accelerometer for the V-2-rocket. Schreyer also worked on technology to convert the radar signal into an audio signal which the pilot of a fighter aircraft might recognize. Helmut Schreyer advised Konrad Zuse to use electrical circuit technology to implement computers, but he first considered it practically infeasible and then could not get the necessary funding. Up to 1942 Schreyer himself built an experimental model of a computer using 100 vacuum tubes, which was lost at the end of the war. Schreyer planned to build a computer memory for 1000 words in 1943, that was to contain several thousand electron tubes, but the course the war took put an end to all larger plans.Hans Dieter Hellige (ed.): Geschichten der Informatik. Visionen, Paradigmen, Leitmotive. Berlin, Springer 2004, . p. 116. In 1944 he built an electrical circuit to convert decimal to binary numbers.

Completed in 1903-1904 and first performed in 1906, it is a setting for baritone, chorus and orchestra of words by Walt Whitman.  The poem adaptation  Sea Drift takes its name from a section of Walt Whitman's poetical compilation Leaves of Grass, Sea-Drift, which contains several poems about the sea or the shore.W. Whitman, Leaves of Grass “Deathbed edition” 1891-92 (J. M. Dent Ltd., London 1993). First published 1855. The text is drawn from the poem Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking, though it does not use the full text. In the poem, the speaker describes how, as a boy, he watched a pair of mocking-birds nesting,Described thus in the opening lines, these were probably northern mockingbirds, which have bluish-green eggs with brown spots ('four light-green eggs spotted with brown'). Certain musical lines suggest the call of this bird. Its summer range does extend to Long Island (whose native name is Paumanok), where the events of the poem are set. until one day the she-bird flew away and never returned. In a long section usually printed in italics, the he-bird, unable to leave in case his mate should return and find him gone, waits forever and calls his sorrowful song to the moon, the stars and the sea, which are heavy and drooping with his lost love. The text employed by Delius closes with the bird's apostrophe, 'translated' by the boy, who seems to understand it, or projects it from his own awakening feelings. The poem however continues to explain how the boy's feelings suddenly burst out tumultuously, and he ran weeping down to the sea in the moonlight as the bird's call unlocked the questions in his own heart. Knowing that he will never escape the unknown want aroused in him, 'the sweet hell within', he begs for some word more of understanding. The unhurrying sea > Lisp'd to me the low and delicious word death, > And again death, death, death, death > Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd child's heart, > But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet, > Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over, > Death, death, death, death, death.  The setting  Throughout the work, which lasts about 25 minutes, the motion of the waves is suggested by the orchestra. The chorus opens (the beginning of the poem, 'Out of the cradle...' is omitted) at 'Once Paumanok, when the lilac-scent was in the air...', two sections weaving the words to suggest the two birds. Then the baritone is the narrator, and tells ('And every day...') how the boy went and watched, and the chorus responds with the birds singing together ('Shine! shine! shine!'). The baritone interrupts ('Till of a sudden...') to tell how the she-bird disappeared, and the he-bird was left. The chorus gives the bird's cry, and the baritone responds with the lyrical passage describing how the boy listened to the song, 'Yes my brother, I know: The rest might not, but I have treasured every note...' The remainder of the setting is from the text of the bird's song (somewhat edited), (beginning 'Soothe! soothe! soothe!') overlapping as the baritone sings 'Following you, my brother...': from this point on the baritone takes important sections of the bird's song ('You must know who I am, my love!'), with the chorus singing other parts of the text at the same time, interweaving, reinforcing, echoing and punctuating the singer's narrative. Love becomes the power which drives the effects of nature ('O madly the sea pushes upon the land,/With love, with love'). The choral phrases 'O rising stars! Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you' pivots between two passages where despair alternates with the delusional hope for a glimpse or an echo of the beloved. This culminates in the fortissimo 'O in vain!', repeated by the chorus as the climax, and then the long coda, mainly sung by the baritone ('O I am very sick and sorrowful'), lamenting the loss of their life together ('We two together no more'), and the words 'no more' echoed like the murmuring sea and wind by the choir, bring the work to a close. By this blending of the narrator with the choir in the words of the bird's song, Delius has achieved the union of the boy's spirit with what he witnesses, in the way that is explained in the later part of Whitman's poem, and Delius does not have to tell us about the 'low and delicious word death.'  Premier performances  Sea Drift was completed by Delius between 1903 and 1904, not long before his A Mass of Life. It was dedicated to the composer and conductor Max von Schillings (then plain \\"Max Schillings\\"), and (at a time when Delius found it very difficult to obtain performances of his works in Britain) the first performance was given on 24 May 1906 at the Essen Tonkünstler Verein (Composers' Society) in Germany, with Joseph Loritz as soloist and Georg Witte conducting.T. Beecham, Delius (Hutchinson, London 1959), 135. Carl Schuricht was present, was immediately won over by the work, and wrote frequently to the composer about it.Lionel Carley, 'Hans Haym: Delius's Prophet and Pioneer' (in Music and Letters, January 1973), C. Redwood (Ed.), A Delius Companion (John Calder, London 1976), pp. 187-215, at p. 199. Over the next years the bass Felix von Kraus distinguished himself in the work in Germany.Carley, Hans Haym, at pp. 202-209. The first performance in England was given by the baritone Frederic Austin, conducted by Henry Wood, in autumn 1908 at the Sheffield Festival. It was repeated, with the same soloist and with the New Symphony Orchestra and the North Staffordshire Choral Society, under Sir Thomas Beecham, at Hanley, Staffordshire on 3 December 1908 and at Manchester on 4 December.Beecham 1959, 154. Of this Manchester performance it was written, \\"People had come from Paris, London, Birmingham and Liverpool to hear it; yet, as a matter of actual fact, there were more people taking part in the concert on the platform than listeners in the audience. Nevertheless, Delius's Sea Drift aroused tremendous enthusiasm, the audience making up in applause what they lacked in numbers.\\"Gerald Cumberland, 'Pen Portraits of Musicians - Frederick Delius' (in Musical Opinion, July 1909), C. Redwood (Ed.), A Delius Companion (John Calder, London 1976), pp. 19-23, at p. 22. The New York premiere, in 1928, featured the English baritone Herbert Heyner. = Recordings = The first commercial recording of Sea Drift was issued in 1929 by Decca Records. The set of three 78rpm discs featured baritone Roy Henderson with the New English Symphony Orchestra and Chorus; however, the recording was pulled by Decca after a limited time (before 1936R. D. Darrell, The Gramophone Shop Encyclopedia of Recorded Music (New York, 1936).) because it fitted poorly across six record sides, and on account of contract issues related to the conductor (who went unnamed on the recording).The identity of the conductor is also disputed, between Julian Clifford (Decca listings, Decca Classical, 1929-2009 Discography by Philip Stuart (July 2009 Edition), pdf page 35 for 29 May in Chelsea, issued July 1929): Anthony Bernard (according to Jelka Delius: see Lionel Carley, Jelka Rosen Delius: Artist, Admirer and Friend of Rodin.

Upton and M. Walker 1969 Delius discography). An earlier recording was made in 1928 for HMV of baritone Dennis Noble, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Manchester Beecham Opera Chorus under Sir Thomas Beecham; however, HMV never issued the recording owing to flawed acoustics.T. Beecham, Delius (Revised Edition, Severn House 1975), Malcolm Walker Discography. The failure of the recording is mentioned by Joe Batten, recording engineer, who was excluded from involvement in the project. J. Batten, Joe Batten's Book (Rockliff, London 1956), 134.

Browne was descended from a family which could trace its descent to the time of the Conqueror, and had settled in Ireland at a very early period. His immediate ancestors were the Brownes of Camas, Limerick, where he was born 15 June 1698. He was educated at Limerick diocesan school. A Catholic and a Jacobite, he, like several of his other relations, sought scope for his ambition in a foreign military career (Flight of the Wild Geese). In his twenty-seventh year he entered the service of the Electoral Palatinate, from which he passed in 1730 to that of Russian Empire. He distinguished himself in the Polish, French, and Turkish wars, and had risen to the rank of general, with the command of 30,000 men, when he was taken prisoner by the Turks. After being three times sold as a slave to an Albanian, he obtained his freedom through the intervention of the French ambassador Villeneuve, at the instance of the Russian court, and, remaining for some time at Constantinople in his slave's costume, succeeded in discovering important state secrets which he carried to Saint Petersburg. In recognition of this special service he was raised by Anna to the rank of major-general, and in this capacity accompanied General Lacy on his first expedition to Finland. On the outbreak of the Swedish war his tactical skill was displayed to great advantage in checking Swedish attacks on Livonia. In the Seven Years' War he rendered important assistance as lieutenant-general under his cousin Maximilian Ulysses, Reichsgraf von Browne. His fortunate diversion of the enemy's attacks at Kolin, 18 June 1757, contributed materially to the allied victory, and in token of her appreciation of his conduct on the occasion Maria Theresa presented him with a snuff-box set with brilliants and adorned with her portrait. At Zorndorf, 25 August 1758, he again distinguished himself in a similar manner, his opportune assistance of the right wing at the most critical moment of the battle changing almost inevitable defeat into victory. By Peter III he was named general-in-chief, and appointed to the chief command in the Danish war. On his addressing a remonstrance to the czar against the war as impolitic, he was deprived of his honours and commanded to leave the country, but the czar repenting of his hasty decision recalled him three days afterwards and appointed him Governor of Livonia. He was confirmed in the office under Catherine II who granted him Smiltene Manor, and for thirty years to the close of his life administered its affairs with remarkable practical sagacity, and with great advantage both to the supreme government and to the varied interests of the inhabitants. He died 18 February 1792 in Riga. His son Johann Georg von Browne, also an officer in the Russian army, was a patron of Ludwig van Beethoven.

It is owned by the City of Spencer. The airport is used by charter airlines including Plane Master Services and Nova Air. It has been served by Great Lakes Airlines. The airline was named after the nearby Iowa Great Lakes. The airline has since relocated to Cheyenne, Wyoming. History Activated in March 1942 as Northwest Iowa Regional Airport, the facility provided contract glider training to the United States Army Air Forces between 1942 and 1944. Training was provided by Hunter Flying Service. The airport was an all-way turf airfield with a 4,000' x 4,000' landing/takeoff area. The facility was used primarily to train C-47 Skytrain and Waco CG-4 unpowered glider crews in various types of towed and soaring flight, both day and night, and for servicing gliders in the field. Northwest Iowa Regional was deactivated during 1944 with the drawdown of AAFTC's pilot training program. The property was declared surplus, turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers on 30 September 1945 and was eventually discharged to the War Assets Administration (WAA) to become a civil airport, eventually renamed Spencer Municipal.  Facilities and aircraft  Spencer Municipal Airport covers an area of which contains two concrete paved runways: 12/30 measuring 6,001 x 100 ft (1,829 x 30 m) and 18/36 measuring 5,100 x 75 ft (1,554 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2016, the airport had 15,090 aircraft operations, an average of 41 per day: 76% general aviation, 24% air taxi and less than 1% military. In November 2018, there were 37 aircraft based at this airport: 27 single-engine, 6 multi-engine, 2 jet and 2 ultralight.

Life and work The photographs of Howard Schatz are exhibited in museums and photography galleries internationally and are included in innumerable private collections. He has received international acclaim for his work which has been published in twenty-two monographs. KINK, Schatz 22nd monograph, will be published in April 2018. The Folsom Street Fair is held every year in San Francisco on the last Sunday in September, celebrating the world of kink and bondage, discipline and sadomasochism (BDSM). For over a quarter century Schatz has made a serious photographic exploration of the people and personalities who visit the fair. May 2015 marked the publication of a monumental 2-volume 25-year retrospective of the work of Howard Schatz: Schatz Images: 25 Years. Schatz's 20th book, Caught in the Act: Actors Acting was published in October, 2013. In it he gives us a unique window into the world of stage and screen as he explores the magical transformation that happens when an actor takes hold of words on a page and becomes another person. Schatz directed and photographed 85 actors to explore an enormous range of scenarios in one-on-one improvisation, capturing the dynamic energy of the actors in full creative flight. The book includes powerful and compelling portraits of each actor along with an extensive interview, focusing on the creative process. In 2012, his 19th book, AT THE FIGHTS: Inside the World of Professional BOXING was published. Born out of a six-year study and exploration,it is a magnificent collection of fantastic and award-winning photographs and revealing interviews of boxing's current champions and key movers and shakers including promoters, managers, announcers, referees, judges and trainers. At The Fights: Inside the World of Professional Boxing is published by Sports Illustrated Books is Schatz's nineteenth book. Published in 2011, WITH child, is the result of a 20-year long exploration of the landscape of the human body in the last two weeks of pregnancy. It is his eighteenth book. In 2007, Bulfinch Press published the third in Schatz's series of explorations of imagery made on, over and underwater. It is a breathtaking feat of underwater photography and a visionary celebration of movement and form. Working with uncommonly graceful and aquatically gifted dancers, models, and performers, photographer Howard Schatz has found joyous inspiration underwater. The images in H2O take advantage of water's unique properties- light, clarity, buoyancy, and reflectivity-to create a delightfully serene and otherworldly aesthetic. At once uncanny, lithe, athletic, and mysterious, the figures in Schatz's photographs transform the pool into studio and stage. Howard Schatz first established a following in the 1990s with two collections of underwater photography, Water Dance and Pool Light. With H2O, Schatz takes the magic of weightlessness and the beauty of dance to new heights. Whether in single portraits or as part of a larger, spectacular ballet, his dancers are as utterly elegant as they are phantasmagorical. They appear before the camera as though borrowed from a dream. In Character: Actors Acting Schatz's sixteenth book of photographs, was published in April 2006 by Bulfinch Press. Schatz photographed 100 actors of stage, screen and television, directing them in one-on-one improvisation. Botanica (Bulfinch 2005) and Athlete, (HarperCollins, 2002) were Schatz's two other most recently published books of photographs. Schatz's books are known worldwide; other titles include: Nude Body Nude; Body Knots, Passion & Line, Pool Light. Schatz's editorial work has been published in magazines around the world, including Time, Sports Illustrated, Vogue, Vogue Italia, GQ Italia, The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, Stern, Life, Black/White, American Photo, Photo France, and Photo Italia. His work has been featured on the Today Show, Good Morning America, NPR, Fox Sports Network, the Discovery Channel and widely in Europe. He has made extraordinary images for such advertising clients as Ralph Lauren RLX, Escada, Sergio Tacchini, Nike, Reebok, Wolford, Etienne Aigner, Sony, Adidas, Finlandia Vodka, MGM Grand Hotel, Virgin Records, and Mercedes-Benz.

King of Ireland. He belonged to the Uí Chernaig sept of the Síl nÁedo Sláine branch of the southern Uí Néill. He was King of Brega and was the son of Niall mac Cernaig Sotal (died 701) and great- grandson of the high king Diarmait mac Áedo Sláine (died 665).T.M. Charles- Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, Appendix III King of Brega Fogartach may be identified with the \\"Focortoch\\" who signed as a guarantor of the Cáin Adomnáin at Birr in 697.Charles-Edwards, pg.603 The earliest report of him in the Irish annals is his flight from the battlefield at the Battle of Claenath (Clane, Co. Kildare) in 704 following the defeat of a number of southern Uí Néill kings by Cellach Cualann (died 715), King of Leinster.Annals of Ulster AU 704.4 In 714, Fogartach was deposed as king of Brega and exiled in Britain.Annals of Ulster AU 714.4 It has been suggested that it was the High King, Fergal mac Máele Dúin (died 722), who deposed him, but it appears more likely that this was a dispute within the fractious Síl nÁedo Sláine, and that Fogartach was removed by his uncle Conall Grant (died 718), assisted by Murchad Midi (died 715) of Clann Cholmáin. Conall killed Murchad the following year and Fogartach returned in 716.Annals of Tigernach AT 715.3; 716.2 He caused some manner of disturbance in 717 at the Oenach Tailtiuan annual Uí Néill gathering held at Teltownwhere \\"Ruba's son and Dub Sléibe's son\\" were killed, but the annalistic record lacks sufficient context to explain what happened there and why.Annals of Ulster AU 717.6 The following year Conall Grant won a battle against a coalition of southern Uí Néill kings at Kells, but was killed by Fergal mac Máele Dúin later that year.Annals of Ulster AU 718.3 In the early 720s, Fogartach's lands were under attack by the kings of Leinster and Cathal mac Finguine, king of Munster.Annals of Ulster AU 721.6 Fergal mac Máele Dúin undertook campaigns against Leinster in revenge, but was killed by the Leinstermen on one of these, at the battle of Allen, on 11 December 722.Annals of Ulster AU 722.8; Annals of Tigernach AT 722.7;722.8 His brother Áed Laigin was slain in this battle.Annals of Ulster claim this was Aed Laigen son of Fithchellach, king of Uí Maine; Annals of Tigernach claim Aedh Laigen h-ua Cernaigh High King Fogartach replaced Fergal as High King, but himself fell victim to the war within the Síl nÁedo Sláine, being killed in the battle of Cenn Deilgden by his distant kinsman and successor Cináed mac Írgalaig of the Uí Chonaing sept of North Brega.Annals of Ulster AU 724.3 This was an old feud, Cináed's father having assassinated Fogartach's father in 701.Annals of Ulster AU 701.11 The report of his death in the Annals of Ulster does not refer to him as High King.

It was developed in the 1950s during research into analogues of pethidine and was assessed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime but was not included on the list of drugs under international control, probably because it was not used in medicine or widely available. Methylketobemidone is so named because it is the methyl ketone analogue of bemidone (hydroxypethidine). The more commonly used ethyl ketone (\\"ethylketobemidone\\") is simply called ketobemidone, as it is the only drug of this family to have been marketed. Presumably methylketobemidone produces similar effects to ketobemidone and other opioids, such as analgesia and sedation, along with side effects such as nausea, itching, vomiting and respiratory depression which may be harmful or fatal.

It is a political allegory of Korea's transition from dictatorship to democracy, with themes of how totalitarianism can crush intellectual opposition, either by intimidation or assimilation. It was first published by World Literature () in June 1987. Yi Munyol was awarded the 1987 Yi Sang Literary Award for the novel.우리들의 일그러진 영웅 (1987) This book was a big hit in South Korea and was later made into the 1992 film adaptation, Our Twisted Hero, directed by Park Jong-won. It was translated into English by Kevin O'Rourke, and published by Hyperion East in 2001. Characters * Han Pyongtae - protagonist * Om Sokdae - class monitor of the 5th grade * 5th grade teacher * 6th grade teacher * 8th grade teacher * Pyongtae's Wife Plot This story is told by a man named Han Byeong-tae (or Pyŏngt'ae), recalling his memories when he was in 5th grade and part of 6th grade. Due to Byeong-tae's father failing in business, they move to a low town and go to Y Elementary School. There, he meets Eom Seokdae (or Ŏm Sŏkdae), a president of the 5th grade and one who holds everything in his grade, more than his teacher. However, Eom Seokdae forces students with threats and violence to follow him. Byeong-tae fights Soekdae's reign and tries everything in his power to overthrow the bully. However, every single student in their class supports Soekdae. Therefore, everything goes wrong for him; his parents misunderstand him, his grades go down and his power ranking also goes down. Hence he loses, gives up, and gives up under Seokdae's power. After, Seokdae treats him specially, granting him more power and allowing him to gain popularity. First, he restores Byeong-tae's fighting rank to even higher than before. Second, he makes everyone hang out with Byeong-tae so he is not alone. Byeong-tae also gets his grades back up. At this point, the narrator begins to have mixed feelings for Seokdae, ranging from gratitude to fear. \\"I was thankful to Seokdae. But when I think it back, those things were the things I had lost to Seokdae. He had just given it back.\\" But when Byeong- tae goes to 6th grade, Seokdae's power breaks, because the new teacher takes action against the strange distribution of power among the classmates. After Seokdae's cheating and bullying have been outed by the teacher, he leaves school and is never heard from again. The story turns back to the present. Byeong-tae, now grown up, ends up seeing a familiar man getting dragged down by the police in a station. As the man turns his face, Byeong-tae recognizes the distinctive features as Seokdae. Seokdae seems unchanged, still controlling people or at least trying to. Analysis Han Byeong-tae fights against Eom Seokdae until he is left with nothing. At this point he breaks and gives up his principles, in a scene reminiscent of a parallel one in Orwell’s 1984, turning instead to fight to gain Eom's respect. He is rewarded for this turn by being made Eom's second-in-command, a privileged position. When the new teacher breaks Seokdae's power in the school, while all the other students turn on Seokdae, only Byeong-tae refuses to admit to Seokdae's wrongdoings. This is seemingly because he cannot give up the power that cost him all of his original beliefs of freedom. Seokdae’s orderly rule is an allegory of Korea under its corrupt dictatorial regimes of the 1950s to 1980s, where freedom and human rights were sacrificed for social stability and economic growth.

The Instrument for Stability was proposed by the Commission in September 2004 and created by the Council and Parliament on 15 November 2006 through Regulation No 1717/2006. It replaces the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM), which was considered unwieldy as it could only finance projects of up to six months.DG RELEX \\"Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM)\\", December 2005, http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/cfsp/cpcm/rrm/index.htm. In 2011 negotiations began for the next EU Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020 including the legal basis for the Instrument for Stability for the period. The independent foundation the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) suggested that while the IfS was a useful instrument for conflict prevention and peacebuilding that it was not appropriate for it to be the only EU financial instrument that should include them as a key consideration for the period 2014 - 2020.Görtz, S. and A. Sherriff. 2012. 1st Among Equals? The Instrument for Stability and Conflict Prevention and Peacebuilding in the EU’s new financial perspective. (ECDPM Briefing Note 39), http://www.ecdpm.org/bn39 Purpose The purpose of the Instrument for Stability is to support measures aimed at safeguarding or re-establishing the conditions under which the partner countries of the European Union can pursue their long term development goals. The main added value of the IfS is its ability to provide support to the political strategy of the European Union in a third country. The IfS may be deployed for crisis response and crisis preparedness (such a limited window of opportunity to prevent or resolve conflict, situations threatening to escalate into armed conflict or severe destabilisation, or the urgent need to secure the conditions for the delivery of aid by the European Union), including in the case of major natural disaster. Besides tackling immediate crises or catastrophes in third countries, the IfS also addresses trans-regional risks and threats that are either natural or criminal in nature and may jeopardize the health, environment, economic development and safety conditions of people in the region. This trans-regional approach provided by the Instrument for Stability complements national measures provided by EU geographical instruments and contributes to strengthen the rule of law, good governance, safety and security at regional level. Regional centers of excellence (so called CBRN Centers of Excellence) are being established in five key regions of the world (the Middle East, South East Asia, Caucasus, Central Asia and Africa) to operate this transregional approach. These regional centers (CoEs) will be a platform of coordination and cooperation between donors and recipients in the field of safety and security. The IfS can only finance operations where other financial instruments cannot respond within the timeframe necessary. In specific, the IfS cannot finance humanitarian assistance (which is the responsibility of ECHO) or finance projects that are longer than 18 months (which the Commission should be able to finance through the regular financial instruments). In addition, specialised short-term financing instruments already exist for specific crises. These include regulations on food aid, human rights and democratisation, mine action and rehabilitation. Deployment For the deployment of the IfS, a simplified decision-making process is used. The Commission may adopt measures which apply immediately. The Commission is assisted by a committee (composed of the representatives of the Member States and chaired by the representative of the Commission, who does not vote in the committee), which is kept informed of all IfS measures taken by the Commission. If the Commission's actions are not in accordance with the opinion of the committee, the Council will immediately be informed, which may then overrule the Commission within 30 days, voting by qualified majority. The European Parliament, meanwhile, is informed by the Commission of committee proceedings on a regular basis. Budget The total budget for the period 2007-2013 is €2 billion, of which a maximum of 27% (ca. €550 million) will be spent on longer-term EC responses to global and trans-regional threats. The remaining 73% are earmarked for rapid initial responses to situations of political crisis and natural disasters.

The Pennine chain of Hills in the west is of Carboniferous origin. The central vale is Permo-Triassic. The North York Moors in the north-east of the county are Jurassic in age while the Yorkshire Wolds to the south east are Cretaceous chalk uplands. The plain of Holderness and the Humberhead levels both owe their present form to the Quaternary ice ages. Much of Yorkshire presents heavily glaciated scenery as few places escaped the great ice sheets as they advanced during the last ice age.  Drainage  The main Rivers of Yorkshire Western and central Yorkshire are largely drained by rivers which empty their waters into the River Ouse which reaches the North Sea via the Humber Estuary. The most northerly of the rivers in the Ouse system is the Swale, which drains Swaledale before passing through Richmond and meandering across the Vale of Mowbray. Next, draining Wensleydale, is the River Ure, which joins the Swale east of Boroughbridge. The River Nidd rises on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and flows along Nidderdale before reaching the Vale of York. The Ouse is the name given to the river after its confluence with the Ure at Ouse Gill Beck. The River Wharfe, which drains Wharfedale, joins the Ouse upstream of Cawood. The Rivers Aire and Calder are more southerly contributors to the River Ouse and the most southerly Yorkshire tributary is the River Don, which flows northwards to join the main river at Goole. In the far north of the county the River Tees flows eastwards through Teesdale and empties its waters into the North Sea downstream of Middlesbrough. The smaller River Esk flows from west to east at the northern foot of the North York Moors to reach the sea at Whitby. The River Derwent rises on the North York Moors, flows south then westwards through the Vale of Pickering then turns south again to drain the eastern part of the Vale of York. It empties into the River Ouse at Barmby on the Marsh. To the east of the Yorkshire Wolds the River Hull flows southwards to join the Humber Estuary at Kingston upon Hull.

The Abrahamic religions, also referred to collectively as Abrahamism, are a group of Semitic-originated religions that claim descent from the Judaism of the ancient Israelites and the worship of the God of Abraham. The Abrahamic religions are monotheistic, with the term deriving from the patriarch Abraham (a major figure described both in the Tanakh and the Quran, recognized by Jews, Christians, Muslims, and others). The three Abrahamic religions trace their origins to both sons of Abraham. For Jews and Christians it is his youngest son Isaac and for Muslims, his eldest son Ishmael. Abrahamic religions spread globally through Christianity being adopted by the Roman Empire in the 4th century and Islam by the Islamic empires from the 7th century. Today the Abrahamic religions are one of the major divisions in comparative religion (along with Indian, Iranian, and East Asian religions).C.J. Adams Classification of religions: Geographical. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2007 . Retrieved 15 May 2013 The major Abrahamic religions in chronological order of founding are Judaism (the base of the other two religions) in the 7th century BCE, Israelite religion has its origins in Canaanite religions of the Bronze Age, it became distinct from other Canaanite religions in Iron Age I due to a focus on the monolatristic worship of Yahweh. Judaism likely became fully monotheistic in the 6th century BCE (Iron Age II). Christianity in the 1st century CE, and Islam in the 7th century CE. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are the Abrahamic religions with the greatest numbers of adherents. Abrahamic religions with fewer adherents include the Druze faith (sometimes considered a part of Islam), the Baháʼí Faith, and Rastafari. * , estimates classified 55.5% (3.8 billion people) of the world's population as adherents of an Abrahamic religion, which makes the other 46% (2.8 billion people) of the world's population adherents of a non- Abrahamic religion (32%) or irreligious (16%) as adherents of no organized religion. Christianity claims 31.2% of the world's population, Islam has 24.1%, Judaism has 0.2%The numbers, based on upper bounds, do not add to 100%. and the Baháʼí Faith represents around 0.1%.  Etymology  Major religious groups as a percentage of world population The Catholic scholar of Islam Louis Massignon stated that the phrase \\"Abrahamic religion\\" means that all these religions come from one spiritual source. The modern term comes from the plural form of a Quranic reference to dīn Ibrāhīm, 'religion of Ibrahim', the Arabic form of Abraham's name.Guy G.Stroumsa, The Making of the Abrahamic Religions in Late Antiquity, Oxford University Press 2015 p.7 God's promise at Genesis 15:4-8 regarding Abraham's heirs became paradigmatic for Jews, who speak of him as \\"our father Abraham\\" (Avraham Avinu). With the emergence of Christianity, Paul the Apostle, in Romans 4:11-12, likewise referred to him as \\"father of all\\" those who have faith, circumcised or uncircumcised. Islam likewise conceived itself as the religion of Abraham.Jon D. Levenson, Inheriting Abraham: The Legacy of the Patriarch in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, Princeton University Press, 2014 ch.1 & pp.3, 6, 178-179 All the major Abrahamic religions claim a direct lineage to Abraham, although in Christianity this is understood in spiritual terms: * Abraham is recorded in the Torah as the ancestor of the Israelites through his son Isaac, born to Sarah through a promise made in Genesis.Scherman, pp. 34–35. * Christians affirm the ancestral origin of the Jews in Abraham, but, as gentiles, faith is what determines the issue for being Christian, not lineal descent. * It is the Islamic tradition that Muhammad, as an Arab, is descended from Abraham's son Ishmael. Jewish tradition also equates the descendants of Ishmael, Ishmaelites, with Arabs, while the descendants of Isaac by Jacob, who was also later known as Israel, are the Israelites.Saheeh al-Bukharee, Book 55, hadith no. 584; Book 56, hadith no. 710 Adam Dodds argues that the term \\"Abrahamic faiths\\", while helpful, can be misleading, as it conveys an unspecified historical and theological commonality that is problematic on closer examination. While there is commonality among the religions, in large measure their shared ancestry is peripheral to their respective foundational beliefs and thus conceals crucial differences. For example, the common Christian beliefs of Incarnation, Trinity, and the resurrection of Jesus are not accepted by Judaism or Islam (see for example Islamic view of Jesus' death). There are key beliefs in both Islam and Judaism that are not shared by most of Christianity (such as strict monotheism and adherence to Divine Law), and key beliefs of Islam, Christianity, and the Baháʼí Faith not shared by Judaism (such as the prophetic and Messianic position of Jesus, respectively).Greenstreet, p. 95.  Challenges to the term  The appropriateness of grouping Judaism, Christianity, and Islam by the terms \\"Abrahamic religions\\" or \\"Abrahamic traditions\\" has been challenged. In 2012, Alan L. Berger, Professor of Judaic Studies at Florida Atlantic University, in his Preface to Trialogue and Terror: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam after 9/11 wrote that there are \\"commonalities\\", but \\"there are essential differences between the Abrahamic traditions\\" both \\"historical and theological\\". Although \\"Judaism birthed both Christianity and Islam\\", the \\"three monotheistic faiths went their separate ways\\". The three faiths \\"understand the role of Abraham\\" in \\"differing ways\\", and the relationships between Judaism and Christianity and between Judaism and Islam are \\"uneven\\". Also, the three traditions are \\"demographically unbalanced and ideologically diverse\\".Alan L. Berger, ed., Trialogue and Terror: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam after 9/11 (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2012), xiii. Also in 2012, Aaron W. Hughes published a book about the category Abrahamic religions as an example of \\"abuses of history.\\" He said that only recently the category \\"Abrahamic religions\\" has come into use and that it is a \\"vague referent.\\" It is \\"largely a theological neologism\\" and \\"an artificial and imprecise\\" term. Combining the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions into this one category might serve the purpose of encouraging \\"interfaith trialogue\\", but it is not true to the \\"historical record\\". Abrahamic religions is \\"an ahistorical category\\". There are \\"certain family resemblances\\" among these three religions, but the \\"amorphous\\" term \\"Abrahamic religions\\" prevents an understanding of the \\"complex nature\\" of the interactions among them. Furthermore, the three religions do not share the same story of Abraham. For these and other reasons, Hughes argued that the term should not be used, at least in academic circles.Aaron W. Hughes, Abrahamic Religions: On the Uses and Abuses of History (Oxford University Press, 2012), 3–4, 7–8, 17, 32.  Religions  = Judaism = A Jewish Rebbe holds a Torah One of Judaism's primary texts is the Tanakh, an account of the Israelites' relationship with God from their earliest history until the building of the Second Temple (c. 535 BCE). Abraham is hailed as the first Hebrew and the father of the Jewish people. One of his great-grandsons was Judah, from whom the religion ultimately gets its name. The Israelites were initially a number of tribes who lived in the Kingdom of Israel and Kingdom of Judah. After being conquered and exiled, some members of the Kingdom of Judah eventually returned to Israel. They later formed an independent state under the Hasmonean dynasty in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, before becoming a client kingdom of the Roman Empire, which also conquered the state and dispersed its inhabitants. From the 2nd to the 6th centuries Jews wrote the Talmud, a lengthy work of legal rulings and Biblical exegesis which, along with the Tanakh, is a key text of Judaism. = Christianity = Christianity is based on the teachings of the Bible Christianity began in the 1st century as a sect within Judaism initially led by Jesus. His followers viewed him as the Messiah, as in the Confession of Peter; after his crucifixion and death they came to view him as God incarnate,Pavlac, Brian A (2010). A Concise Survey of Western Civilization: Supremacies and Diversities. Chapter 6. who was resurrected and will return at the end of time to judge the living and the dead and create an eternal Kingdom of God. Within a few decades the new movement split from Judaism. Christian teaching is based on the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. After several periods of alternating persecution and relative peace vis a vis the Roman authorities under different administrations, Christianity became the state church of the Roman Empire in 380, but has been split into various churches from its beginning. An attempt was made by the Byzantine Empire to unify Christendom, but this formally failed with the East–West Schism of 1054. In the 16th century, the birth and growth of Protestantism during the Reformation further split Christianity into many denominations. = Islam = The tomb of Abraham, a cenotaph above the Cave of the Patriarchs traditionally considered to be the burial place of Abraham. Islam is based on the teachings of the Quran. Although it considers Muhammad to be the Seal of the prophets, Islam teaches that every prophet preached Islam, as the word Islam literally means submission to God, the main concept preached by all Abrahamic prophets. The teachings of the Quran are believed by Muslims to be the direct and final revelation and words of Allah (i.e. God in Arabic). Islam like Christianity is a universal religion (i.e.membership is open to anyone). Like Judaism, it has a strictly unitary conception of God, called tawhid, or \\"strict\\" monotheism.Religions » Islam » Islam at a glance , BBC, 5 August 2009. = Other Abrahamic religions = Historically, the Abrahamic religions have been considered to be Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Some of this is due to the age and larger size of these three. The other, similar religions were seen as either too new to judge as being truly in the same class, or too small to be of significance to the category. However, some of the restriction of Abrahamic to these three is due only to tradition in historical classification. Therefore, restricting the category to these three religions has come under criticism.  The religions listed below here claim Abrahamic classification, either by the religions themselves, or by scholars who study them.  Bábism  Bábism (, Babiyye), also known as the Bayání FaithThis has been the standard term which the modern followers of Bábism have adopted in order to identify themselves, however it has not been popular within scholarship, modern and contemporary to the religion's founders, the majority of scholars—such as Browne for instance—choosing to refer to the religion as Bábism or the Bábí FaithVarnava, Andrekos, Nicholas Coureas, and Marina Elia, eds. The Minorities of Cyprus: Development patterns and the identity of the internal-exclusion. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009. p. 362 (Arabic: , Bayání), is a monotheistic religion which professes that there is one incorporeal, unknown, and incomprehensible GodBáb, The (1848). Persian Bayán , Exordium.Browne, E.G. Kitab-i-Nuqtatu'l-Kaf , p. 15 who manifests his will in an unending series of theophanies, called Manifestations of God (Arabic: ). It is an extremely small religion, with no more than a few thousand adherents according to current estimates, most of which are concentrated in Iran.Barret (2001), p. 246 It was founded by 'Ali Muhammad Shirazi who first assumed the title of Báb ( \\"Gate\\") from which the religion gets its name, out of the belief that he was the gate to the Twelfth Imam. However throughout his ministry his titles and claims underwent much evolution as the Báb progressively outlined his teachings.Lambden, Stephen. The Evolving Clains and Titles of Mirza \`Ali Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab (1819–1850 CE) Founded in 1844, Bábism flourished in Persia until 1852, then lingered on in exile in the Ottoman Empire, especially Cyprus, as well as underground. An anomaly amongst Islamic messianic movements, the Bábí movement signaled a break with Islam, beginning a new religious system with its own unique laws, teachings, and practices. While Bábism was violently opposed by both clerical and government establishments, it led to the founding of the Baháʼí Faith, whose followers consider the religion founded by the Báb as a predecessor to their own.  Baháʼí Faith  Nine-point star of Baháʼí Faith The Baháʼí Faith, which dates to the late 19th century, is a new religious movement that has sometimes been listed as Abrahamic by scholarly sources in various fields. Bahá'u'lláh (1817–1892), the founder, affirms the highest religious station of a Manifestation of God for Abraham and generally for prophets mentioned among the other Abrahamic religions, and has claimed a lineage of descent from Abraham through Keturah and Sarah. Additionally, Baháʼís cite that Bahá'u'lláh lost a son, Mírzá Mihdí. Bahá'u'lláh, then in prison, eulogized his son and connected the subsequent easing of restrictions to his son's dying prayer and compared it to the intended sacrifice of Abraham's son. The religion also shares many of the same commonalities of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The religion emphasizes monotheism and believes in one eternal transcendent God, the station of the founders of the major religions as Manifestations of God come with revelation as a series of interventions by God in human history that has been progressive, and each preparing the way for the next. There is no definitive list of Manifestations of God, but Bahá'u'lláh and 'Abdu'l-Bahá referred to several personages as Manifestations; they include individuals generally not recognized by other Abrahamic religions—Krishna, Zoroaster, and Buddha—and general statements go further to other cultures.See for example the affirmations granted Baháʼí Faith and Native Americans such as in and in the indigenous culture in Papua New Guinea see  Druze faith  Druze dignitaries celebrating the Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb festival at the tomb of the prophet in Hittin. The Druze faith or Druzism is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of high Islamic figures like Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad and Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, and Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad is considered the founder of the Druze and the primary author of the Druze manuscripts. Jethro of Midian is considered an ancestor of Druze, who revere him as their spiritual founder and chief prophet. The Epistles of Wisdom is the foundational text of the Druze faith. The Druze faith incorporates elements of Islam's Ismailism, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, Pythagoreanism, Christianity, HinduismThe Israelis: Ordinary People in an Extraordinary Land , Donna Rosenthal, Simon and Schuster, 2003, p. 296 and other philosophies and beliefs, creating a distinct and secretive theology known to interpret esoterically religious scriptures, and to highlight the role of the mind and truthfulness. The Druze follow theophany, and believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of the soul. At the end of the cycle of rebirth, which is achieved through successive reincarnations, the soul is united with the Cosmic Mind (Al Aaqal Al Kulli). In the Druze faith, Jesus is considered one of God's important prophets. The Druze Faith is often classified as a branch of Isma'ili Shia Islam. Even though the faith originally developed out of Ismaili Islam, Druze are not generally considered Muslims.  Mandaeism  Mandaeans in prayer Mandaeism or Mandaeanism ( ') is a monotheistic Gnostic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview. Its adherents, the Mandaeans, revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah, Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist. Occasionally, Mandaeans are called \\"Christians of Saint John\\" by Jews and Christians. The Mandaeans do not worship the God of Abraham and they hate Abraham,Lupieri writes, \\"they hate Abraham\\" (p. 66) and quotes Ricoldo who wrote, \\"They detest Abraham because of circumcision\\" (p. 65) considering him, along with Moses, Jesus and Mohammed, to be a false prophet. They regard the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam as hostile or enemy religions. Abraham, or Braham, was a priest of the Mandai,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/03/16/pictures- day-16-march-2019/iraqis-sabeans-followers-pre-christian-religion-considers- prophet/Smith, Andrew Phillip.

It was through Yurba's power of Darkness that Abraham and his people became strong. The Mandaeans are Gnostics and worship a supreme God far removed from the malevolent creator god of the material world, who in Mandaean writings, is identified as the Lord of the Old Testament and is associated with the Holy Spirit. Both the Lord and the Holy Spirit are regarded as malevolent figures.Dr. James F.

Wasserstrom, London & New York: Bloomsbury Academic 2019 p. 135  Rastafari Rastafari, sometimes termed Rastafarianism, is also sometimes listed as an Abrahamic religion. Classified as both a new religious movement and social movement, it developed in Jamaica during the 1930s. It lacks any centralised authority and there is much heterogeneity among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas. Rastafari refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the Bible, as \\"Rastalogy\\". Central is a monotheistic belief in a single God—referred to as Jah—who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the Second Coming of Christ. Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognised the inner divinity within every individual. Rastafari is Afrocentric and focuses its attention on the African diaspora, which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \\"Babylon\\". Many Rastas call for the resettlement of the African diaspora in either Ethiopia or Africa more widely, referring to this continent as the Promised Land of \\"Zion\\". Other interpretations shift focus on to the adoption of an Afrocentric attitude while living outside of Africa. Rastas refer to their practices as \\"livity\\". Communal meetings are known as \\"groundations\\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the smoking of cannabis, the latter being regarded as a sacrament with beneficial properties. Rastas place emphasis on what they regard as living 'naturally', adhering to ital dietary requirements, allowing their hair to form into dreadlocks, and following patriarchal gender roles. Rastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised Afro-Jamaican communities. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant British colonial culture. It was influenced by both Ethiopianism and the Back-to- Africa movement promoted by black nationalist figures like Marcus Garvey. The movement developed after several Christian clergymen, most notably Leonard Howell, proclaimed that the crowning of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's counter- cultural stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired reggae musicians like Bob Marley. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley. The Rasta movement is organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \\"Mansions of Rastafari\\", the most prominent of which are the Nyahbinghi, Bobo Ashanti, Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, each of which offers different interpretations of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world; the largest population is in Jamaica although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres.  Samaritanism  Samaritanism is based on some of the same books used as the basis of Judaism but differs from the latter. Samaritan religious works include the Samaritan version of the Torah, the Memar Markah, the Samaritan liturgy, and Samaritan law codes and biblical commentaries. Many claim the Samaritans appear to have a text of the Torah as old as the Masoretic Text; scholars have various theories concerning the actual relationships between these three texts.  Shabakism  Shabakism is the name given to the beliefs and practices of the Shabak people of Kurdistan region and around Mosul in Iraq. A majority of Shabaks regard themselves as Shia, and a minority identify as Sunnis. Despite this, their actual faith and rituals differ from Islam, and have characteristics that make them distinct from neighboring Muslim populations. These include features from Christianity including confession, and the consumption of alcohol, and the fact that Shabaks often go on pilgrimage to Yazidi shrines. Nevertheless, the Shabak people also go on pilgrimages to Shia holy cities such as Najaf and Karbala, and follow many Shiite teachings. The organization of Shabakism appears to be much like that of a Sufi order: adult laymen (Murids) are bound to spiritual guides (pîrs or Murshids) who are knowledgeable in matters of religious doctrine and ritual. There are several ranks of such pîrs; at the top stands the Baba, or supreme head of the order. Theoretically individuals can choose their own pîr, but in practice the pir families often become associated with lay families over several generations. Shabakism combines elements of Sufism with the uniquely Shabak interpretation of \\"divine reality.\\" According to Shabaks, this divine reality supersedes the literal, or Shar'ia, interpretation of the Quran. Shabaks comprehend divine reality through the mediation of the \\"Pir\\" or spiritual guide, who also performs Shabak rituals. The structure of these mediatory relationships closely resembles that of the Yarsan. The primary Shabak religious text is the Buyruk or Kitab al-Managib (Book of Exemplary Acts) and is written in Turkoman. Shabaks also consider the poetry of Ismail I to be revealed by God, and they recite Ismail's poetry during religious meetings.  Yazdânism (the Yezidi, Yarsani and Chinarism faiths)  Pilgrims celebrating the Yazidi new year festival at the ancient holy temple of Lalish, Iraq Yazdânism, or the Cult of Angels, is a proposed pre-Islamic, native religion of the Kurds. The term was introduced by Kurdish scholar Mehrdad Izady to represent what he considers the \\"original\\" religion of the Kurds as the primary inhabitants of the Zagros Mountains, until their increasing Islamization in the course of the 10th century. According to Izady, Yazdânism is now continued in the denominations of Yazidism, Yarsanism, and Chinarism.Izady, 1992. pp. 170 passim The three traditions subsumed under the term Yazdânism are primarily practiced in relatively isolated communities, from Khurasan to Anatolia and parts of western Iran. The concept of Yazdânism has found a wide perception both within and beyond Kurdish nationalist discourses, but has been disputed by other recognized scholars of Iranian religions. Well established, however, are the \\"striking\\" and \\"unmistakable\\" similarities between the Yazidis and the Yaresan or Ahl-e Haqq, some of which can be traced back to elements of an ancient faith that was probably dominant among Western Iranians and likened to practices of pre-Zoroastrian Mithraic religion. Mehrdad Izady defines the Yazdanism as an ancient Hurrian religion and states that Mitannis could have introduced some of the Vedic tradition that appears to be manifest in Yazdanism.  Abrahamic ethno-religious groups  Some small religions, such as Samaritanism, Druze, Rastafari movement, and the Bábí Faith, are Abrahamic. These religions are regional, with Samaritans largely in Israel and the West Bank, Druze largely in Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Jordan, and Rastafari largely in Jamaica.  Origins and history  The civilizations that developed in Mesopotamia influenced some religious texts, particularly the Hebrew Bible and the Book of Genesis. Abraham is said to have originated in Mesopotamia. Judaism regards itself as the religion of the descendants of Jacob,Jacob is also called Israel, a name the Bible states he was given by God. a grandson of Abraham. It has a strictly unitary view of God, and the central holy book for almost all branches is the Masoretic Text as elucidated in the Oral Torah. In the 19th century and 20th centuries Judaism developed a small number of branches, of which the most significant are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform. Christianity began as a sect of Judaismcf. Judaizer, Messianic Judaism in the Mediterranean BasinWith several centers, such as Rome, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Thessaloniki and Corinth, Antioch, and later spread outwards, eventually having two main centers in the empire, one for the Western Church and one for the Eastern Church in Rome and Constantinople respectively by the 5th century CE of the first century CE and evolved into a separate religion—Christianity—with distinctive beliefs and practices. Jesus is the central figure of Christianity, considered by almost all denominations to be God the Son, one person of the Trinity. (See God in Christianity.Triune God is also called the \\"Holy Trinity\\") The Christian biblical canons are usually held to be the ultimate authority, alongside sacred tradition in some denominations (such as the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church). Over many centuries, Christianity divided into three main branches (Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant), dozens of significant denominations, and hundreds of smaller ones. Islam arose in the Arabian PeninsulaIslam arose specifically in Tihamah city of Mecca and Hejaz city of Medina of Arabia in the 7th century CE with a strictly unitary view of God.The monotheistic view of God in Islam is called tawhid which is essentially the same as the conception of God in Judaism Muslims hold the Quran to be the ultimate authority, as revealed and elucidated through the teachings and practicesTeachings and practices of Muhammad are collectively known as the sunnah, similar to the Judaic concepts of oral law and exegesis, or talmud and midrash of a central, but not divine, prophet, Muhammad. The Islamic faith considers all prophets and messengers from Adam through the final messenger (Muhammad) to carry the same Islamic monotheistic principles. Soon after its founding, Islam split into two main branches (Sunni and Shia Islam), each of which now has a number of denominations. The Baháʼí Faith began within the context of Shia Islam in 19th-century Persia, after a merchant named Siyyid 'Alí Muḥammad Shírází claimed divine revelation and took on the title of the Báb, or \\"the Gate\\". The Bab's ministry proclaimed the imminent advent of \\"He whom God shall make manifest\\", who Baháʼís accept as Bahá'u'lláh. Baháʼís revere the Torah, Gospels and the Quran, and the writings of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, and 'Abdu’l-Bahá' are considered the central texts of the faith. A vast majority of adherents are unified under a single denomination. Lesser- known Abrahamic religions, originally offshoots of Shia Islam, include BábismHistorically, the Baháʼí Faith arose in 19th-century Persia, in the context of Shia Islam, and thus may be classed on this basis as a divergent strand of Islam, placing it in the Abrahamic tradition. However, the Baháʼí Faith considers itself an independent religious tradition, which arose from a Muslim context but also recognizes other traditions. The Baháʼí Faith may also be classed as a new religious movement, due to its comparatively recent origin, or may be considered sufficiently old and established for such classification to not be applicable. and the Druze faith.     Common aspects  All Abrahamic religions accept the tradition that God revealed himself to the patriarch Abraham. All are monotheistic, and conceive God to be a transcendent creator and the source of moral law. Their religious texts feature many of the same figures, histories, and places, although they often present them with different roles, perspectives, and meanings. Believers who agree on these similarities and the common Abrahamic origin tend to also be more positive towards other Abrahamic groups. In the three main Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), the individual, God, and the universe are highly separate from each other. The Abrahamic religions believe in a judging, paternal, fully external god to which the individual and nature are subordinate. One seeks salvation or transcendence not by contemplating the natural world or via philosophical speculation, but by seeking to please God (such as obedience with God's wishes or his law) and see divine revelation as outside of self, nature, and custom. = Monotheism = The Trinity is the belief in Christianity that God is one God in three persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. All Abrahamic religions claim to be monotheistic, worshiping an exclusive God, although one known by different names. Each of these religions preaches that God creates, is one, rules, reveals, loves, judges, punishes, and forgives. However, although Christianity does not profess to believe in three gods—but rather in three persons, or hypostases, united in one essence—the Trinitarian doctrine, a fundamental of faith for the vast majority of Christian denominations, conflicts with Jewish and Muslim concepts of monotheism. Since the conception of a divine Trinity is not amenable to tawhid, the Islamic doctrine of monotheism, Islam regards Christianity as variously polytheistic. Christianity and Islam both revere Jesus (Arabic: Isa or Yasu among Muslims and Arab Christians respectively) but with vastly differing conceptions: * Christians view Jesus as the saviour (and most Christians also regard him as God incarnate). * Muslims see Isa as a Prophet of IslamUri Rubin, Prophets and Prophethood, Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an and Messiah. However, the worship of Jesus, or the ascribing of partners to God (known as shirk in Islam and as shituf in Judaism), is typically viewed as the heresy of idolatry by Islam and Judaism. Judaism and Islam see the incarnation of God into human form as a heresy. = Theological continuity = All the Abrahamic religions affirm one eternal God who created the universe, who rules history, who sends prophetic and angelic messengers and who reveals the divine will through inspired revelation. They also affirm that obedience to this creator deity is to be lived out historically and that one day God will unilaterally intervene in human history at the Last Judgment. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism have a teleological view on history, unlike the static or cyclic view on it found in other culturesSamuel P. Huntington: Der Kampf der Kulturen. Die Neugestaltung der Weltpolitik im 21. Jahrhundert, Frankfurt 1997, p. 337. (the latter being common in Indian religions). = Scripture = All Abrahamic religions believe that God guides humanity through revelation to prophets, and each religion recognizes that God revealed teachings up to and including those in their own scripture. = Ethical orientation = An ethical orientation: all these religions speak of a choice between good and evil, which is associated with obedience or disobedience to a single God and to Divine Law. = Eschatological world view = An eschatological world view of history and destiny, beginning with the creation of the world and the concept that God works through history, and ending with a resurrection of the dead and final judgment and world to come.Wiener, Philip P. Dictionary of the History of Ideas. Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973–74. The Electronic Text Center at the University of Virginia Library. Retrieved 4 August 2009. = Importance of Jerusalem = Jerusalem is considered Judaism's holiest city. Its origins can be dated to 1004 BCE when according to Biblical tradition David established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel, and his son Solomon built the First Temple on Mount Moriah. Since the Hebrew Bible relates that Isaac's sacrifice took place there, Mount Moriah's importance for Jews predates even these prominent events. Jews thrice daily pray in its direction, including in their prayers pleas for the restoration and the rebuilding of the Holy Temple (the Third Temple) on mount Moriah, close the Passover service with the wistful statement \\"Next year in built Jerusalem,\\" and recall the city in the blessing at the end of each meal. Jerusalem has served as the only capital for the five Jewish states that have existed in Israel since 1400 BCE (the United Kingdom of Israel, the Kingdom of Judah, Yehud Medinata, the Hasmonean Kingdom, and modern Israel). It has been majority Jewish since about 1852 and continues through today. Jerusalem was an early center of Christianity. There has been a continuous Christian presence there since.Wilken, Robert L. \\"From Time Immemorial? Dwellers in the Holy Land.\\" Christian Century, 30 July – 6 August 1986, p. 678. William R. Kenan, Jr., professor of the history of Christianity at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, writes that from the middle of the 4th century to the Islamic conquest in the middle of the 7th century, the Roman province of Palestine was a Christian nation with Jerusalem its principal city. According to the New Testament, Jerusalem was the city Jesus was brought to as a child to be presented at the temple and for the feast of the Passover. He preached and healed in Jerusalem, unceremoniously drove the money changers in disarray from the temple there, held the Last Supper in an \\"upper room\\" (traditionally the Cenacle) there the night before he was crucified on the cross and was arrested in Gethsemane. The six parts to Jesus' trial—three stages in a religious court and three stages before a Roman court—were all held in Jerusalem. His crucifixion at Golgotha, his burial nearby (traditionally the Church of the Holy Sepulchre), and his resurrection and ascension and prophecy to return all are said to have occurred or will occur there. Jerusalem became holy to Muslims, third after Mecca and Medina. The Al-Aqsa Mosque, which translates to \\"farthest mosque\\" in sura Al-Isra in the Quran and its surroundings are addressed in the Quran as \\"the holy land\\". Muslim tradition as recorded in the ahadith identifies al-Aqsa with a mosque in Jerusalem. The first Muslims did not pray toward Kaaba, but toward Jerusalem (this was the qibla for 13 years): the qibla was switched to Kaaba later on to fulfill the order of Allah of praying in the direction of Kaaba (Quran, Al-Baqarah 2:144–150). Another reason for its significance is its connection with the Miʿrāj, where, according to traditional Muslim, Muhammad ascended through the Seven heavens on a winged mule named Buraq, guided by the Archangel Gabriel, beginning from the Foundation Stone on the Temple Mount, in modern times under the Dome of the Rock.\\"Jerusalem (Britannica)\\" , Jerusalem(Britannica) = Significance of Abraham = An interpretation of the borders (in red) of the Promised Land, based on God's promise to Abraham (Genesis 15:18). Even though members of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not all claim Abraham as an ancestor, some members of these religions have tried to claim him as exclusively theirs. For Jews, Abraham is the founding patriarch of the children of Israel. God promised Abraham: \\"I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you.\\" With Abraham, God entered into \\"an everlasting covenant throughout the ages to be God to you and to your offspring to come\\". It is this covenant that makes Abraham and his descendants children of the covenant. Similarly, converts, who join the covenant, are all identified as sons and daughters of Abraham. Abraham is primarily a revered ancestor or patriarch (referred to as Avraham Avinu (אברהם אבינו in Hebrew) \\"Abraham our father\\") to whom God made several promises: chiefly, that he would have numberless descendants, who would receive the land of Canaan (the \\"Promised Land\\"). According to Jewish tradition, Abraham was the first post-Flood prophet to reject idolatry through rational analysis, although Shem and Eber carried on the tradition from Noah.Shultz, Joseph P. \\"Two Views of the Patriarchs\\", in Nahum Norbert Glatzer, Michael A. Fishbane, Paul R. Mendes-Flohr (eds.) (1975). Texts and Responses: Studies presented to Nahum N. Glatzer on the occasion of his 70th birthday by his students. Brill Publishers. pp. 51–52. Kaplan, Aryeh (1973). \\"The Jew\\". The Aryeh Kaplan Reader. Mesorah Publications. p. 161\\\\. Christians view Abraham as an important exemplar of faith, and a spiritual, as well as physical, ancestor of Jesus. For Christians, Abraham is a spiritual forebear as well as/rather than a direct ancestor depending on the individual's interpretation of Paul the Apostle, with the Abrahamic covenant \\"reinterpreted so as to be defined by faith in Christ rather than biological descent\\" or both by faith as well as a direct ancestor; in any case, the emphasis is placed on faith being the only requirement for the Abrahamic Covenant to applyBlasi, Turcotte, Duhaime, p. 592. (see also New Covenant and supersessionism). In Christian belief, Abraham is a role model of faith, and his obedience to God by offering Isaac is seen as a foreshadowing of God's offering of his son Jesus. Christian commentators have a tendency to interpret God's promises to Abraham as applying to Christianity subsequent to, and sometimes rather than (as in supersessionism), being applied to Judaism, whose adherents rejected Jesus. They argue this on the basis that just as Abraham as a Gentile (before he was circumcised) \\"believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness\\" (cf. Rom. 4:3, James 2:23), \\"those who have faith are children of Abraham\\" (see also John 8:39). This is most fully developed in Paul's theology where all who believe in God are spiritual descendants of Abraham. \\"So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.\\" \\"In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring.\\" (Rom. 9:8) However, with regards to and , in both cases he refers to these spiritual descendants as the \\"sons of God\\" rather than \\"children of Abraham\\".Bickerman, p. 188cf. For Muslims, Abraham is a prophet, the \\"messenger of God\\" who stands in the line from Adam to Muhammad, to whom God gave revelations,, who \\"raised the foundations of the House\\" (i.e., the Kaaba) with his first son, Isma'il, a symbol of which is every mosque. Ibrahim (Abraham) is the first in a genealogy for Muhammad. Islam considers Abraham to be \\"one of the first Muslims\\" (Surah 3)—the first monotheist in a world where monotheism was lost, and the community of those faithful to God, thus being referred to as ابونا ابراهيم or \\"Our Father Abraham\\", as well as Ibrahim al-Hanif or \\"Abraham the Monotheist\\". Also, the same as Judaism, Islam believes that Abraham rejected idolatry through logical reasoning. Abraham is also recalled in certain details of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.  Differences  = God = The Abrahamic God is conceived of as eternal, omnipotent, omniscient and as the creator of the universe. God is further held to have the properties of holiness, justice, omnibenevolence and omnipresence. Proponents of Abrahamic faiths believe that God is also transcendent, but at the same time personal and involved, listening to prayer and reacting to the actions of his creatures. The Star of David (or Magen David), is a generally recognized symbol of modern Jewish identity and Judaism. In Jewish theology, God is strictly monotheistic. God is an absolute one, indivisible and incomparable being who is the ultimate cause of all existence. Jewish tradition teaches that the true aspect of God is incomprehensible and unknowable and that it is only God's revealed aspect that brought the universe into existence, and interacts with mankind and the world. In Judaism, the one God of Israel is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who is the guide of the world, delivered Israel from slavery in Egypt, and gave them the 613 Mitzvot at Mount Sinai as described in the Torah. The national god of the Israelites has a proper name, written YHWH () in the Hebrew Bible. The name YHWH is a combination of the future, present, and past tense of the verb \\"howa\\" () meaning \\"to be\\" and translated literally means \\"The self- existent One\\". A further explanation of the name was given to Moses when YHWH stated Eheye Asher Eheye () \\"I will be that I will be\\", the name relates to God as God truly is, God's revealed essence, which transcends the universe. It also represents God's compassion towards the world. In Jewish tradition another name of God is Elohim, relating to the interaction between God and the universe, God as manifest in the physical world, it designates the justice of God, and means \\"the One who is the totality of powers, forces and causes in the universe\\". The Christian cross (or crux) is the best-known religious symbol of Christianity; this version is known as a Latin Cross. In Christian theology, God is the eternal being who created and preserves the world. Christians believe God to be both transcendent and immanent (involved in the world).Basic Christian Doctrine by John H. Leith (1 January 1992) pages 55–56Introducing Christian Doctrine (2nd Edition) by Millard J. Erickson (1 April 2001) pages 87–88 Early Christian views of God were expressed in the Pauline Epistles and the early creeds, which proclaimed one God and the divinity of Jesus. Around the year 200, Tertullian formulated a version of the doctrine of the Trinity which clearly affirmed the divinity of Jesus and came close to the later definitive form produced by the Ecumenical Council of 381.Prestige G.L.

Dyrness, Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen, Juan F. Martinez and Simon Chan (10 October 2008) pages 352–353 As time passed, theologians developed systematic lists of these attributes, some based on statements in the Bible (e.g., the Lord's Prayer, stating that the Father is in Heaven), others based on theological reasoning.Christian Doctrine by Shirley C.

E. Peters, Islam, p. 4, Princeton University Press, 2003 Islamic tradition also describes the 99 names of God. These 99 names describe attributes of God, including Most Merciful, The Just, The Peace and Blessing, and the Guardian. Islamic belief in God is distinct from Christianity in that God has no progeny. This belief is summed up in chapter 112 of the Quran titled Al-Ikhlas, which states \\"Say, he is Allah (who is) one, Allah is the Eternal, the Absolute. He does not beget nor was he begotten. Nor is there to Him any equivalent\\". = Scriptures = All these religions rely on a body of scriptures, some of which are considered to be the word of God—hence sacred and unquestionable—and some the work of religious men, revered mainly by tradition and to the extent that they are considered to have been divinely inspired, if not dictated, by the divine being. The sacred scriptures of Judaism are the Tanakh, a Hebrew acronym standing for Torah (Law or Teachings), Nevi'im (Prophets) and Ketuvim (Writings). These are complemented by and supplemented with various (originally oral) traditions: Midrash, the Mishnah, the Talmud and collected rabbinical writings. The Tanakh (or Hebrew Bible) was composed between 1,400 BCE, and 400 BCE by Jewish prophets, kings, and priests. The Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular is considered holy, down to the last letter: transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error in a single letter, ornamentation or symbol of the 300,000+ stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use; hence the skills of a Torah scribe are specialist skills, and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check. A Bible handwritten in Latin, on display in Malmesbury Abbey, Wiltshire, England. This Bible was transcribed in Belgium in 1407 for reading aloud in a monastery. The sacred scriptures of most Christian groups are the Old Testament and the New Testament. Latin Bibles originally contained 73 books; however, 7 books, collectively called the Apocrypha or Deuterocanon depending on one's opinion of them, were removed by Martin Luther due to a lack of original Hebrew sources, and now vary on their inclusion between denominations. Greek Bibles contain additional materials. The New Testament comprises four accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus (the Four Gospels), as well as several other writings (the epistles) and the Book of Revelation. They are usually considered to be divinely inspired, and together comprise the Christian Bible. The vast majority of Christian faiths (including Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity, and most forms of Protestantism) recognize that the Gospels were passed on by oral tradition, and were not set to paper until decades after the resurrection of Jesus and that the extant versions are copies of those originals. The version of the Bible considered to be most valid (in the sense of best conveying the true meaning of the word of God) has varied considerably: the Greek Septuagint, the Syriac Peshitta, the Latin Vulgate, the English King James Version and the Russian Synodal Bible have been authoritative to different communities at different times. The sacred scriptures of the Christian Bible are complemented by a large body of writings by individual Christians and councils of Christian leaders (see canon law). Some Christian churches and denominations consider certain additional writings to be binding; other Christian groups consider only the Bible to be binding (sola scriptura). 9th-century Quran in Reza Abbasi Museum Islam's holiest book is the Quran, comprising 114 Suras (\\"chapters of the Qur'an\\"). However, Muslims also believe in the religious texts of Judaism and Christianity in their original forms, albeit not the current versions. According to the Quran (and mainstream Muslim belief), the verses of the Quran were revealed by God through the Archangel Jibrail to Muhammad on separate occasions. These revelations were written down and also memorized by hundreds of companions of Muhammad. These multiple sources were collected into one official copy. After the death of Mohammed, Quran was copied on several copies and Caliph Uthman provided these copies to different cities of Islamic Empire. The Quran mentions and reveres several of the Israelite prophets, including Moses and Jesus, among others (see also: Prophets of Islam). The stories of these prophets are very similar to those in the Bible. However, the detailed precepts of the Tanakh and the New Testament are not adopted outright; they are replaced by the new commandments accepted as revealed directly by God (through Gabriel) to Muhammad and codified in the Quran. Like the Jews with the Torah, Muslims consider the original Arabic text of the Quran as uncorrupted and holy to the last letter, and any translations are considered to be interpretations of the meaning of the Quran, as only the original Arabic text is considered to be the divine scripture. Like the Rabbinic Oral Law to the Hebrew Bible, the Quran is complemented by the Hadith, a set of books by later authors recording the sayings of the prophet Muhammad. The Hadith interpret and elaborate Qur'anic precepts. Islamic scholars have categorized each Hadith at one of the following levels of authenticity or isnad: genuine (sahih), fair (hasan) or weak (da'if). By the 9th century, six major Hadith collections were accepted as reliable to Sunni Muslims. * Sahih al-Bukhari * Sahih Muslim * Sunan ibn Majah * Sunan Abu Dawud * Jami al-Tirmidhi * Sunan an-Nasa'ii Shia Muslims, however, refer to other authenticated hadiths instead. They are known collectively as The Four Books. The Hadith and the life story of Muhammad (sira) form the Sunnah, an authoritative supplement to the Quran. The legal opinions of Islamic jurists (Faqīh) provide another source for the daily practice and interpretation of Islamic tradition (see Fiqh.) The Quran contains repeated references to the \\"religion of Abraham\\" (see Suras 2:130,135; 3:95; 6:123,161; 12:38; 16:123; 22:78). In the Quran, this expression refers specifically to Islam; sometimes in contrast to Christianity and Judaism, as in Sura 2:135, for example: 'They say: \\"Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (to salvation).\\" Say thou (O Muslims): \\"Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with God.\\" ' In the Quran, Abraham is declared to have been a Muslim (a hanif, more accurately a \\"primordial monotheist\\"), not a Jew nor a Christian (Sura 3:67). = Eschatology = In the major Abrahamic religions, there exists the expectation of an individual who will herald the time of the end or bring about the Kingdom of God on Earth; in other words, the Messianic prophecy. Judaism awaits the coming of the Jewish Messiah; the Jewish concept of Messiah differs from the Christian concept in several significant ways, despite the same term being applied to both. The Jewish Messiah is not seen as a \\"god\\", but as a mortal man who by his holiness is worthy of that description. His appearance is not the end of history, rather it signals the coming of the world to come. Christianity awaits the Second Coming of Christ, though Full Preterists believe this has already happened. Islam awaits both the second coming of Jesus (to complete his life and die) and the coming of Mahdi (Sunnis in his first incarnation, Twelver Shia as the return of Muhammad al-Mahdi). Most Abrahamic religions agree that a human being comprises the body, which dies, and the soul, which is capable of remaining alive beyond human death and carries the person's essence, and that God will judge each person's life accordingly on the Day of Judgement. The importance of this and the focus on it, as well as the precise criteria and end result, differ between religions. Judaism's views on the afterlife (\\"the Next World\\") are quite diverse. This can be attributed to the fact that although there clearly are traditions in the Hebrew Bible of an afterlife (see Naboth and the Witch of Endor), Judaism focuses on this life and how to lead a holy life to please God, rather than future reward. Christians have more diverse and definite teachings on the end times and what constitutes afterlife. Most Christian approaches either include different abodes for the dead (Heaven, Hell, Limbo, Purgatory) or universal reconciliation because all souls are made in the image of God. A small minority teach annihilationism, the doctrine that those persons who are not reconciled to God simply cease to exist. In Islam, God is said to be \\"Most Compassionate and Most Merciful\\" (Quran 1:2, as well as the start of all Suras but one). However, God is also \\"Most Just\\"; Islam prescribes a literal Hell for those who disobey God and commit gross sin. Those who obey God and submit to God will be rewarded with their own place in Paradise. While sinners are punished with fire, there are also many other forms of punishment described, depending on the sin committed; Hell is divided into numerous levels. Those who worship and remember God are promised eternal abode in a physical and spiritual Paradise. Heaven is divided into eight levels, with the highest level of Paradise being the reward of those who have been most virtuous, the prophets, and those killed while fighting for Allah (martyrs). Upon repentance to God, many sins can be forgiven, on the condition they are not repeated, as God is supremely merciful. Additionally, those who believe in God, but have led sinful lives, may be punished for a time, and then eventually released into Paradise. If anyone dies in a state of Shirk (i.e. associating God in any way, such as claiming that He is equal with anything or denying Him), this is not pardonable—he or she will stay forever in Hell. Once a person is admitted to Paradise, this person will abide there for eternity. = Worship and religious rites = Worship, ceremonies and religion-related customs differ substantially among the Abrahamic religions. Among the few similarities are a seven-day cycle in which one day is nominally reserved for worship, prayer or other religious activities—Shabbat, Sabbath, or jumu'ah; this custom is related to the biblical story of Genesis, where God created the universe in six days and rested in the seventh. Orthodox Judaism practice is guided by the interpretation of the Torah and the Talmud. Before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, Jewish priests offered sacrifices there two times daily; since then, the practice has been replaced, until the Temple is rebuilt, by Jewish men being required to pray three times daily, including the chanting of the Torah, and facing in the direction of Jerusalem's Temple Mount. Other practices include circumcision, dietary laws, Shabbat, Passover, Torah study, Tefillin, purity and others. Conservative Judaism, Reform Judaism and the Reconstructionist movement all move away, in different degrees, from the strict tradition of the law. Jewish women's prayer obligations vary by denomination; in contemporary Orthodox practice, women do not read from the Torah and are only required to say certain parts of these daily services. All versions of Judaism share a common, specialized calendar, containing many festivals. The calendar is lunisolar, with lunar months and a solar year (an extra month is added every second or third year to allow the shorter lunar year to \\"catch up\\" to the solar year). All streams observe the same festivals, but some emphasize them differently. As is usual with its extensive law system, the Orthodox have the most complex manner of observing the festivals, while the Reform pay more attention to the simple symbolism of each one. Christian worship varies from denomination to denomination. Individual prayer is usually not ritualised, while group prayer may be ritual or non-ritual according to the occasion. During church services, some form of liturgy is frequently followed. Rituals are performed during sacraments, which also vary from denomination to denomination and usually include Baptism and Communion, and may also include Confirmation, Confession, Last Rites and Holy Orders. Catholic worship practice is governed by the Roman Missal and other documents. Individuals, churches and denominations place different emphasis on ritual—some denominations consider most ritual activity optional, see Adiaphora, particularly since the Protestant Reformation. The followers of Islam (Muslims) are to observe the Five Pillars of Islam. The first pillar is the belief in the oneness of Allah, and in Muhammad as his final and most perfect prophet. The second is to pray five times daily (salat) towards the direction (qibla) of the Kaaba in Mecca. The third pillar is almsgiving (Zakah), a portion of one's wealth given to the poor or to other specified causes, which means the giving of a specific share of one's wealth and savings to persons or causes, as is commanded in the Quran and elucidated as to specific percentages for different kinds of income and wealth in the hadith. The normal share to be paid is two and a half percent of one's earnings: this increases if labour was not required, and increases further if only capital or possessions alone were required (i.e. proceeds from renting space), and increases to 50% on \\"unearned wealth\\" such as treasure-finding, and to 100% on wealth that is considered haram, as part of attempting to make atonement for the sin, such as that gained through financial interest (riba). Fasting (sawm) during the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar, Ramadan, is the fourth pillar of Islam, to which all Muslims after the age of puberty in good health (as judged by a Muslim doctor to be able fast without incurring grave danger to health: even in seemingly obvious situations, a \\"competent and upright Muslim physician\\" is required to agree), that are not menstruating are bound to observe—missed days of the fast for any reason must be made up, unless there be a permanent illness, such as diabetes, that prevents a person from ever fasting. In such a case, restitution must be made by feeding one poor person for each day missed. Finally, Muslims are also required, if physically able, to undertake a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in one's life: it is strongly recommended to do it as often as possible, preferably once a year. Only individuals whose financial position and health are severely insufficient are exempt from making Hajj (e.g. if making Hajj would put stress on one's financial situation, but would not end up in homelessness or starvation, it is still required). During this pilgrimage, the Muslims spend three to seven days in worship, performing several strictly defined rituals, most notably circumambulating the Kaaba among millions of other Muslims and the \\"stoning of the devil\\" at Mina. At the end of the Hajj, the heads of men are shaved, sheep and other halal animals, notably camels, are slaughtered as a ritual sacrifice by bleeding out at the neck according to a strictly prescribed ritual slaughter method similar to the Jewish kashrut, to commemorate the moment when, according to Islamic tradition, Allah replaced Abraham's son Ishmael (contrasted with the Judaeo-Christian tradition that Isaac was the intended sacrifice) with a sheep, thereby preventing human sacrifice. The meat from these animals is then distributed locally to needy Muslims, neighbours and relatives. Finally, the hajji puts off ihram and the hajj is complete. = Circumcision = Judaism commands that males be circumcised when they are 8 days old, as does the Sunnah in Islam. Western Christianity replaced the custom of male circumcision with the ritual of baptismJewish Encyclopedia: Baptism : \\"According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a proselyte to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab. Zarah 57a; Shab. 135a; Yer. Kid. iii. 14, 64d). Circumcision, however, was much more important, and, like baptism, was called a \\"seal\\" (Schlatter, \\"Die Kirche Jerusalems\\", 1898, p. 70). But as circumcision was discarded by Christianity, and the sacrifices had ceased, Baptism remained the sole condition for initiation into religious life. The next ceremony, adopted shortly after the others, was the imposition of hands, which, it is known, was the usage of the Jews at the ordination of a rabbi. Anointing with oil, which at first also accompanied the act of Baptism, and was analogous to the anointment of priests among the Jews, was not a necessary condition\\". a ceremony which varies according to the doctrine of the denomination, but it generally includes immersion, aspersion, or anointment with water. The Early Church (Acts 15, the Council of Jerusalem) decided that Gentile Christians are not required to undergo circumcision. The Council of Florence in the 15th century\\"Ecumenical Council of Florence (1438–1445)\\" . The Circumcision Reference Library. Retrieved 10 July 2007. prohibited it. Paragraph #2297 of the Catholic Catechism calls non-medical amputation or mutilation immoral.Catechism of the Catholic Church: Article 5—The Fifth commandment . Christus Rex et Redemptor Mundi. Retrieved 10 July 2007.Dietzen, John. \\"The Morality of Circumcision\\" , The Circumcision Reference Library. Retrieved 10 July 2007. By the 21st century, the Catholic Church had adopted a neutral position on the practice, as long as it is not practised as an initiation ritual. Catholic scholars make various arguments in support of the idea that this policy is not in contradiction with the previous edicts. The New Testament chapter Acts 15 records that Christianity did not require circumcision. The Catholic Church currently maintains a neutral position on the practice of non-religious circumcision, and in 1442 it banned the practice of religious circumcision in the 11th Council of Florence. Coptic Christians practice circumcision as a rite of passage. The Eritrean Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church calls for circumcision, with near-universal prevalence among Orthodox men in Ethiopia. Many countries with majorities of Christian adherents have low circumcision rates, while both religious and non- religious circumcision is common in many predominantly Christian countries such as the United States,Ray, Mary G. \\"82% of the World's Men are Intact\\", Mothers Against Circumcision, 1997. and the Philippines, Australia, and Canada, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya, and many other African Christian countries, Circumcision is near universal in the Christian countries of Oceania. Coptic Christianity and Ethiopian Orthodoxy and Eritrean Orthodoxy still observe male circumcision and practice circumcision as a rite of passage. Male circumcision is also widely practiced among Christians from South Korea, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and North Africa. (See also aposthia.) Male circumcision is among the rites of Islam and is part of the fitrah, or the innate disposition and natural character and instinct of the human creation. = Dietary restrictions = Judaism and Islam have strict dietary laws, with permitted food known as kosher in Judaism, and halal in Islam. These two religions prohibit the consumption of pork; Islam prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverages of any kind. Halal restrictions can be seen as a modification of the kashrut dietary laws, so many kosher foods are considered halal; especially in the case of meat, which Islam prescribes must be slaughtered in the name of God. Hence, in many places, Muslims used to consume kosher food. However, some foods not considered kosher are considered halal in Islam.\\"Halal & Healthy: Is Kosher Halal\\" , SoundVision.com—Islamic information & products. 5 August 2009. With rare exceptions, Christians do not consider the Old Testament's strict food laws as relevant for today's church; see also Biblical law in Christianity. Most Protestants have no set food laws, but there are minority exceptions.Schuchmann, Jennifer. \\"Does God Care What We Eat?\\", Today's Christian, January/February 2006. Retrieved 6 August 2009. The Roman Catholic Church believes in observing abstinence and penance. For example, all Fridays through the year and the time of Lent are penitential days.Canon 1250, 1983. The 1983 Code of Canon Law specifies the obligations of Latin Rite Catholic. The law of abstinence requires a Catholic from 14 years of age until death to abstain from eating meat on Fridays in honor of the Passion of Jesus on Good Friday. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops obtained the permission of the Holy See for Catholics in the U.S. to substitute a penitential, or even a charitable, practice of their own choosing.\\"Fasting and Abstinence\\" , Catholic Online. 6 August 2009. Eastern Rite Catholics have their own penitential practices as specified by the Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches. The Seventh-day Adventist Church (SDA) embraces numerous Old Testament rules and regulations such as tithing, Sabbath observance, and Jewish food laws. Therefore, they do not eat pork, shellfish, or other foods considered unclean under the Old Covenant. The \\"Fundamental Beliefs\\" of the SDA state that their members \\"are to adopt the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures\\". among others\\"Fundamental Beliefs\\" , No. 22. Christian Behavior. Seventh-Day Adventist Church website. 6 August 2009. In the Christian Bible, the consumption of strangled animals and of blood was forbidden by Apostolic Decree and are still forbidden in the Greek Orthodox Church, according to German theologian Karl Josef von Hefele, who, in his Commentary on Canon II of the Second Ecumenical Council held in the 4th century at Gangra, notes: \\"We further see that, at the time of the Synod of Gangra, the rule of the Apostolic Synod [the Council of Jerusalem of Acts 15] with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show.\\" He also writes that \\"as late as the eighth century, Pope Gregory the Third, in 731, forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days.\\"Schaff, Philip. \\"Canon II of The Council of Gangra\\". The Seven Ecumenical Councils. 6 August 2009. Commentary on Canon II of Gangra . Jehovah's Witnesses abstain from eating blood and from blood transfusions based on . The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints prohibits the consumption of alcohol, coffee, and non-herbal tea. While there is not a set of prohibited food, the church encourages members to refrain from eating excessive amounts of red meat. = Sabbath observance = Sabbath in the Bible is a weekly day of rest and time of worship. It is observed differently in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and informs a similar occasion in several other Abrahamic faiths. Though many viewpoints and definitions have arisen over the millennia, most originate in the same textual tradition. = Proselytism = Judaism accepts converts, but has had no explicit missionaries since the end of the Second Temple era. Judaism states that non-Jews can achieve righteousness by following Noahide Laws, a set of moral imperatives that, according to the Talmud, were given by GodAccording to Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, Entry Ben Noah, page 349), most medieval authorities consider that all seven commandments were given to Adam, although Maimonides (Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 9:1) considers the dietary law to have been given to Noah. as a binding set of laws for the \\"children of Noah\\"—that is, all of humanity.Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry Ben Noah, introduction) states that after the giving of the Torah, the Jewish people were no longer in the category of the sons of Noah; however, Maimonides (Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 9:1) indicates that the seven laws are also part of the Torah, and the Talmud (Bavli, Sanhedrin 59a, see also Tosafot ad. loc.) states that Jews are obligated in all things that Gentiles are obligated in, albeit with some differences in the details.Compare . It is believed that as much as ten percent of the Roman Empire followed the Judaism either as fully ritually obligated Jews or the simpler rituals required of non-Jewish members of that faith. Moses Maimonides, one of the major Jewish teachers, commented: \\"Quoting from our sages, the righteous people from other nations have a place in the world to come if they have acquired what they should learn about the Creator\\". Because the commandments applicable to the Jews are much more detailed and onerous than Noahide laws, Jewish scholars have traditionally maintained that it is better to be a good non-Jew than a bad Jew, thus discouraging conversion. In the U.S., as of 2003 28% of married Jews were married to non-Jews.Kornbluth, Doron. Why marry Jewish?. Southfield, MI: Targum Press, 2003. See also Conversion to Judaism. The Sermon on the Mount by Carl Heinrich Bloch (1877) Christianity encourages evangelism. Many Christian organizations, especially Protestant churches, send missionaries to non-Christian communities throughout the world. See also Great Commission. Forced conversions to Catholicism have been alleged at various points throughout history. The most prominently cited allegations are the conversions of the pagans after Constantine; of Muslims, Jews and Eastern Orthodox during the Crusades; of Jews and Muslims during the time of the Spanish Inquisition, where they were offered the choice of exile, conversion or death; and of the Aztecs by Hernán Cortés. Forced conversions to Protestantism may have occurred as well, notably during the Reformation, especially in England and Ireland (see recusancy and Popish plot). Forced conversions are condemned as sinful by major denominations such as the Roman Catholic Church, which officially states that forced conversions pollute the Christian religion and offend human dignity, so that past or present offences are regarded as a scandal (a cause of unbelief). According to Pope Paul VI, \\"It is one of the major tenets of Catholic doctrine that man's response to God in faith must be free: no one, therefore, is to be forced to embrace the Christian faith against his own will.\\"Pope Paul VI. \\"Declaration on Religious Freedom\\" , 7 December 1965. The Roman Catholic Church has declared that Catholics should fight anti-Semitism. Dawah is an important Islamic concept which denotes the preaching of Islam. Da‘wah literally means \\"issuing a summons\\" or \\"making an invitation\\". A Muslim who practices da‘wah, either as a religious worker or in a volunteer community effort, is called a dā‘ī, plural du‘āt. A dā‘ī is thus a person who invites people to understand Islam through a dialogical process and may be categorized in some cases as the Islamic equivalent of a missionary, as one who invites people to the faith, to the prayer, or to Islamic life. Da'wah activities can take many forms. Some pursue Islamic studies specifically to perform Da'wah. Mosques and other Islamic centers sometimes spread Da'wah actively, similar to evangelical churches. Others consider being open to the public and answering questions to be Da'wah. Recalling Muslims to the faith and expanding their knowledge can also be considered Da'wah. In Islamic theology, the purpose of Da‘wah is to invite people, both Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the commandments of God as expressed in the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet, as well as to inform them about Muhammad. Da‘wah produces converts to Islam, which in turn grows the size of the Muslim Ummah, or community of Muslims.  Dialogue between Abrahamic religions  This section reports on writings and talks which describe or advocate dialogue between the Abrahamic religions. Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi In 1997, Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi claims to have met Jesus in New Mexico. Since then he has exalted God's love above all religious differences. He describes the situation in this way: \\"A Muslim says, 'I am superior to all.' A Jew declares, 'I am even better than the Muslim.' And a Christian says, 'I am greater than both the Muslim and the Jew, and the rest of the religions, because I am the nation of God's Son.'\\" However, Gohar Shahi himself \\"declares that superior and best of all is the one who possesses God's love in his heart, in spite of his indifference to any religion\\". Amir Hussain In 2003, a book called Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism contains a chapter by Amir Hussain on \\"Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue\\" which he shows how interfaith dialogue has been an integral part of Islam from its beginning. From his \\"first revelation\\" for the rest of his life, Muhammad was \\"engaged in interfaith dialogue.\\" Islam would not have spread without \\"interfaith dialogue.\\"Amir Hussain, \\"Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue,\\" in Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism, ed. Omid Safi, 252–253 (Oneworld Publications, 2003). Hussain gives an early example of \\"the importance of pluralism and interfaith dialogue\\" to Islam. When some of Muhammad's followers suffered \\"physical persecution\\" in Mecca, he sent them to Abyssinia, a Christian nation, where they were \\"welcomed and accepted\\" by the Christian king. Another example is Córdoba, Andalusia in Muslim Spain, in the ninth and tenth centuries. Córdoba was \\"one of the most important cities in the history of the world\\". In \\"Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city.\\" Thus, there is \\"a history of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and other religious traditions living together in a pluralistic society.\\"Amir Hussain, \\"Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue,\\" in Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism, ed. Omid Safi, 253–254 (Oneworld Publications, 2003). Turning to the present, Hussain says that one of the challenges faced by Muslims now is the conflicting passages in the Qur̀an some of which support interfaith \\"bridge-building,\\" but others can be used \\"justify mutual exclusion.\\" Amir Hussain, \\"Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue,\\" in Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism, ed. Omid Safi, 254 (Oneworld Publications, 2003). Trialogue The 2007 book Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue puts the importance of interfaith dialogue starkly: \\"We human beings today face a stark choice: dialogue or death!\\"Leonard Swidler, Khalid Duran, Reuven Firestone, Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue (Twenty-Third Publications, 2007), 1, 7. The Trialogue book gives four reasons why the three Abrahamic religions should engage in dialogue:Leonard Swidler, Khalid Duran, Reuven Firestone, Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue (Twenty-Third Publications, 2007), 38. :1. They \\"come from the same Hebraic roots and claim Abraham as their originating ancestor.\\" :2. \\"All three traditions are religions of ethical monotheism.\\" :3. They \\"are all historical religions.\\" :4. All three are \\"religions of revelation.\\" Pope Benedict XVI In 2010, Pope Benedict XVI spoke about \\"Interreligious dialogue.\\" He said that \\"the Church's universal nature and vocation require that she engage in dialogue with the members of other religions.\\" For the Abrahamic religions, this \\"dialogue is based on the spiritual and historical bonds uniting Christians to Jews and Muslims.\\" It is dialogue \\"grounded in the sacred Scriptures\\" and \\"defined in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen Gentium and in the Declaration on the Church's Relation to Non-Christian Religions Nostra Aetate. The Pope concluded with a prayer: \\"May Jews, Christians and Muslims . . . give the beautiful witness of serenity and concord between the children of Abraham.\\" Learned Ignorance In the 2011 book Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims, the three editors address the question of \\"why engage in interreligious dialogue; its purpose?\\": *James L. Heft, a Roman Catholic priest, suggests \\"that the purpose of interreligious dialogue is, not only better mutual understanding . . . but also trying . . . to embody the truths that we affirm.\\"James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 301–302. *Omid Safi, a Muslim, answers the question of \\"why engage in interreligious dialogue?\\" He writes, \\"because for me, as a Muslim, God is greater than any one path leading to God.\\" Therefore, \\"neither I nor my traditions has a monopoly on truth, because in reality, we belong to the Truth (God), Truth to us.\\"James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, editors, Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 305. *Reuven Firestone, a Jewish Rabbi writes about the \\"tension\\" between the \\"particularity\\" of one's \\"own religious experience\\" and the \\"universality of the divine reality\\" that as expressed in history has led to verbal and violent conflict. So, although this tension may never be \\"fully resolved,\\" Firestone says that \\"it is of utmost consequence for leaders in religion to engage in the process of dialogue.\\"James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, editors, Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 308. The Interfaith Amigos In 2011, TED broadcast a 10-minute program about \\"Breaking the Taboos of Interfaith Dialogue\\" with Rabbi Ted Falcon (Jewish), Pastor Don Mackenzie (Christian), and Imam Jamal Rahman (Muslim) collectively known as The Interfaith Amigos See their TED program by clicking here. Divisive matters should be addressed In 2012, a PhD thesis Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims argues that \\"the paramount need is for barriers against non-defensive dialogue conversations between Christians, Jews, and Muslims to be dismantled to facilitate the development of common understandings on matters that are deeply divisive.\\" As of 2012, the thesis says that this has not been done. Cardinal Koch In 2015, Cardinal Kurt Koch, the President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and who is \\"responsible for the Church's dialogue with the Jewish people,\\" was interviewed in 2015. He noted that the Church is already engaged in \\"bilateral talks with Jewish and Muslim religious leaders.\\" However, he said that it is too early for \\"trialogue\\" talks among the three Abrahamic religions. Yet, Koch added, \\"we hope that we can go in this [direction] in future.\\" Omid Safi In 2016, a 26-minute interview with Professor Omid Safi, a Muslim and Director of the Duke Islamic Studies Center, was posted on YouTube.com. In it, Safi said that his life had been trying to combine \\"love and tenderness\\" which are the \\"essence of being human\\" with \\"social justice.\\"  See also  * Abrahamites * Abraham's family tree * Ancient Semitic religion * Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement * Chrislam (Yoruba) * Christianity and Islam * Christianity and Judaism * Dharmic religions * Islam and Judaism * Messianism * People of the Book *Table of Abrahamic Prophets * Zoroastrianism  Notes   References  = Citations = = Sources =     *  Further reading     * Freedman H.

The main output of the group is guidelines, standards, case studies and best practice documents. These documents are produced by RTIG on behalf of its members, usually with the assistance of specialist working groups.  History  In 2000, when real-time information (RTI) systems were beginning to be considered by UK local authorities to provide travellers with up-to-the-minute bus arrival and departure passenger information, it was realised that cross- boundary bus services made it imperative to coordinate projects around the UK. Technical and operational standards would therefore be required. A group of local authorities and bus operators began to meet regularly to discuss how to achieve this; and so RTIG was born. Substantial government funding for projects around the UK, in particular from 2002 to 2004, provided an enormous boost to the development of RTI systems. The expanding and maturing market caused RTIG to reflect on its role, and in 2003 it determined to recreate itself as a subscription group - with the important step that the systems industry was to be a full and equal partner in its work. Equally importantly, it has maintained excellent links with central UK Government, from whom the Group continues to receive project funding for work of national scope and importance. The National RTI Strategy, ratified in March 2007, establishes a framework for how industry stakeholders and government need to work together to deliver benefit to passengers. RTIG's role has, as a consequence, been expanded to cover all aspects of technology in public transport, from systems to support disabled travellers through to safety and security systems.  Annual survey  In 2002 the group produced the first UK Annual RTI Survey, which surveyed the use of RTI technology by local authorities and passenger transport executives across England, as well as plans for the following two years. In 2004 the survey was extended to include Wales and in 2005 Scotland. In order to reflect the widening deployment of bus-related technologies, the 2006 annual survey was re-branded as the ‘RTIG Passenger Transport Technology Survey’ and included questions on services for disabled travellers – partly in response to new obligations on bus operators under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005. The 2007 survey continues to focus broadly on public transport and traffic management technology and has been expanded to include questions on bus CCTV and other security technologies. The annual survey provides details on: *Number of RTI equipped buses in Great Britain *Number of RTI signs in GB *Use of audio equipment on and off buses in GB *Costs of implementing and maintaining RTI in GB *Trends in integration of RTI with UTMC technology *The provision of information for disabled travellers in GB *Passenger and driver security systems (on and off bus) The annual survey has been discontinued with the last being carried out in 2012.  Working Groups  The majority of the documents, standards and guidelines produced by RTIG is done with the assistance of voluntary working groups. These working groups are made up of industry experts who lend their knowledge to particular projects. Examples of RTIG working groups include: *Data Suppliers Working Group *Shelter Implementation Working Group *Disability Working Group *On-bus architecture Working Group *GPRS Interface Working Group Working groups involve non-members where relevant; so, the Disability WG includes representatives from charities such a RNIB and Guide Dogs.  The RTIG library  The RTIG library houses all of the documents produced by the group to date. These documents are held by RTIG electronically and distributed to members on request, or via the ‘members area’ of the RTIG website. The library catalogue is publicly available from the RTIG website . Publicly available documents in the Library include: *The RTIG National Strategy *RTI and disabled travellers *Managing Disruptions Series *Business Case Study Report Members have access to a wider range of standards and guidelines, and to the outputs of RTIG workshops (see below). The group also publishes a monthly newsletter which provides both members and non-members with news on RTIG projects and events.  RTIG workshops  RTIG runs regular workshops, which are held at a different UK venue each time. Each workshop has a central theme and attract presentations from a wide variety of stakeholders. Workshops will include an update on ITS news, an update on RTIG projects and working group activities, and a set of presentations based around the workshop theme. Previous workshop venues (and their respective themes) include : *Leeds (January 2006) – Marketing RTI *Cardiff(April 2006) – Demand Responsive Transport and On-Bus Security *London (July 2006) – The Financial Aspects of RTI *Manchester (November 2006) – The Future of Technology in Public Transport *Bristol (February 2007) – Standards and Specifications *Sheffield (April 2007) – On and off bus security *Lincoln (July 2007) – Bus operators' perspectives of RTI *York (November 2007) - Integrating RTI  RTIG involvement in international standards  RTIG have assisted in the development of a number of standards, including the Service Interface for Real Time Information (SIRI). RTIG have also developed a number of best practice guidelines.

They are excellent index fossils, and it is often possible to link the rock layer in which they are found to specific geological time periods. The shells of Ammonitina are typically planospiral; coiled in a plane, symmetrical side to side. Shells vary in form, including those that are evolute, such that all whorls are exposed, and those that are strongly involute with only the outer whorl showing. They may be strongly ribbed, some bearing nodes and spines; others are entirely smooth. Some have broad rounded venters (the outer rim); in others the venter is sharp and keel-like. Sutures are generally ammonitic, with intricately patterned saddle and lobes. However, in some derived forms the suture becomes simplified, ceratitic, even goniatitic. The Ammonitina are derived from the Phylloceratina, another ammonitid suborder which has its origin in the Ceratitida of the Triassic. As with the subclass, the closest living relatives of the Ammonitina are the Coleoidea (octopus, squid, and cuttlefish) and not the superficially similar modern Nautilus. Lower Jurassic superfamlies include the Psiloceratoidea, Eoceroceratoidea, and Hildoceratoidea, which is in part Middle Jurassic. Superfamilies from the Middle and Upper Jurassic include the Stephanoceratoidea, Perisphinctoidea, and Haploceratoidea; the Perisphinctoidea and Haploceratoidea continued well into the Cretaceous. Exclusively Cretaceous superfamilies include the Desmoceratacea, Hoplitoidea, and the Acanthoceratoidea. The Eoderoceratoidea of the Lower Jurassic gave rise in the middle of the epoch to the Hilderceratidae, which in turn gave rise early in the Middle Jurassic to the Stephanoceratoidea, Perisphinctoidea, and Haploceratoidea. The Psiloceratoidea from the Lower Jurassic stands alone. The Cretaceous Desmoceratoidea are derived from the Phylloceratina separately from Jurassic forms and give rise to the Hoplitoidea and to the Acanthoceratoidea.

It is based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, an inventory of the conservation status of species on a global scale. Regional Red Lists assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit and therefore may feed directly into national and regional planning. This project is coordinated by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and partners in national governments, universities and organizations throughout the world. Regional Red Lists may assist countries or regions in: * Determining the conservation status and trends of species * Identifying species or ecosystems under greatest threat * Informing conservation planning and priority setting * Raising awareness of threatened species Assessing Extinction Risk on a Regional Scale The IUCN Categories and Criteria were initially designed to assess the conservation status of species globally, however there was a demand for guidelines to apply the system at the regional level. In 2003, IUCN developed a set of transparent, quantitative criteria to assess the conservation status of species at the regional and national level. This approach is now being applied in many countries throughout the world. Recently, Regional Red Lists have been completed for Mongolian Mammals and Fishes. These have also been accompanied by Summary Conservation Action Plans, detailing recommended conservation measures for each threatened species. The Process of Creating A Regional Red List A Regional Red List may be created by any country or organisation by following the clear, repeatable protocol. The process is as follows: # All information relevant to a species conservation status is collected, including species distribution, population trend information, habitat, ecology and life history information, threats to the species and conservation measures currently in place. # A conservation assessment is made, using the IUCN Regional Categories and Criteria. # A regional workshop is held in which experts review the assessments, make any corrections necessary and add additional information. # The assessments are then collated into a Regional Red List document. # A Summary Conservation Action Plan may also be created. Towards 2010 Targets Summary of 2006 IUCN Red List categories. In April 2002 at the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), 188 nations committed themselves to actions to “…achieve, by 2010, a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national levels…”. When a Regional Red List is compiled at regular intervals, it can provide information about how the status of the region’s biodiversity is changing over time. This information may be useful to policy makers, conservationists, and the general public, as it may assist countries in meeting their obligation to the CBD. Building the Regional Red List Network Currently, a global network of countries and individuals working on Regional Red Lists is being developed. This will include a centralised online database where Regional Red List assessments and Action Plans can be stored, managed, and made accessible. With this regional network there will be opportunities to learn from each other’s experiences in applying the IUCN Categories and Criteria and in using this information for conservation planning and priority setting. British reviews of conservation status Two public bodies in Britain, Natural England and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), have produced British Red Data Books and other reviews of different plants and animals assigning their conservation status according to IUCN Red Data Book criteria. In 2016 the JNCC produced a spreadsheet which incorporated these reviews and lists of threatened species based on other crieteria such as Biodiversity Action Plan Priority Lists and Schedules of the Wildlife & Countryside Act. Natural England uses the following definitions for uncommon species not rare enough to be included in the Red Data Book: :Nationally important site for a species is one which has more than 1% of the British population. :Internationally important site for a species is one which has more than 1% of the north-west European population. :Nationally scarce species are those which occur in 16–100 10 km squares in Great Britain :Nationally rare species are those which occur in 1–15 10 km squares in Great Britain.

According to the Annals of Ulster, Oengus was killed in 621.Annals of Ulster AU 621.2 According to entries in the Irish annals reporting Óengus's death in 621, which incorrectly call him a son of Colmán Már, he was regis Nepotum Neill or ríg h-Úa Neill, that is king of the Uí Néill. This appears to be synonymous with the alternative titles of High King, King of Ireland, or that King of Tara. It is suggested that the explanation for this is that when Suibne Menn killed Máel Coba mac Áedo in 615, he supported Óengus's claims rather than taking power himself, or perhaps that Óengus was a deputy king in the south.Charles- Edwards, pg.492-493 The king list in the Baile Chuind, created in late 7th century during the reign of the southern Uí Néill king Fínsnechta Fledach, apparently lists an ÓengusGlorious Óengusas king following Suibne Menn.

Nelson was served by the Dun Mountain Railway, a mineral tramway that was also used by a horse tram between the city and its port, and by the Nelson Section, an isolated part of the government-owned railway between Nelson and Glenhope, which served several existing and developing communities in between.  Proposals  Proposals to connect Nelson to the South Island network have involved extensions and different routes for the isolated Nelson Section, and proposals for completely new lines that did not connect with the Nelson Section. The original intention was to build a line that could tap the West Coast coalfields and link with Christchurch, either by way of the Midland Line and the Buller District, or by way of Tophouse and the Lewis Pass. Only after the line was closed was the Blenheim connection seriously advocated and that only until the defeat of the Second Labour Government of 1957 - 1960. = Belgrove – Tophouse route = On 26 July 1880 a government-appointed commission made recommendations on the future of several lines under construction or consideration, including those to serve Nelson. It reported that the then- under-construction Foxhill to Belgrove extension of the Nelson Section should be completed immediately, but the Belgrove – Roundell section was on the postponed list. Despite this, work on the survey for the route continued and was completed as far as Blue Glen by March 1881. Rumours persisted that work on the next of the route would soon commence, and were enough of an incentive for many unemployed people to seek work at Belgrove. In 1883, a contract was let for work to begin on the next 4 km of the formation, a job that was completed by early 1885, at which point the work stopped. By the time work on the Nelson Section resumed in 1890, the route had changed with the new objective being the Spooner’s Range tunnel, and the 4 km of formation already built beyond Belgrove was abandoned, costing the taxpayer £10,700. It is now partly a forestry access road. There were various other proposals for connections from Tophouse to the isolated Picton section and the Waiau Branch line. There was also a proposal to connect to the West Coast via Kawatiri and Inangahua, but this was rejected in favour of the line passing through existing rural communities to the south-west of Nelson. = Inangahua extension = After an abortive attempt to start work on a Belgrove to Tophouse route in the 1880s, the Midland Railway Company, having been selected to continue construction of the line beyond Belgrove, chose a route that passed through the Spooner Range by a summit tunnel. The intention was that the line would continue westwards via Murchison and the Buller River gorge to the nearest railhead, at Inangahua Junction. The Railways Authorization Act 1924 (No 36) authorised several lines; No 9 was an extension of the Midland Line. The Schedule specified: * Name of Railway: Midland * Extent Authorized: \\"An extension of the authorized line from near the confluence of the Owen and Buller Rivers to Murchison. Length about 12 miles.\\" (19.3 km) Though the terminus of the Nelson Line for most of its existence was at Glenhope, the Glenhope to Kawatiri section was opened on 21 June 1926 and by 1930 trains could be run beyond Kawatiri to Gowanbridge. Formation work continued beyond Gowanbridge to the Mangles River, some beyond Gowanbridge and just from Murchison. In January 1931 the government ordered an immediate halt to all work on the line, ostensibly due to economic conditions. It was estimated that at the time the work stopped it would have required only a further six months to finish all the formation work to the peg and ballasting and plate laying work could have started within months and been completed without interruption all the way to Murchison. The goal of a connection at Inangahua fell short by , a failure that eventually contributed to the demise of the section. Despite a trial line survey done in 1939 and promises made during the 1949 election campaign by both major political parties to restore the section of line between Glenhope and Gowanbridge and to continue it on to Murchison, no further work was undertaken beyond Glenhope. = Seddonville extension = In 1926 the engineer in charge of the survey party planning the route of the Nelson Section through the Buller Gorge had doubts about the viability of the route for a railway. As a theoretical exercise, he investigated a route to connect the Nelson Section to the Seddonville Branch. Such a route would have departed from the planned route for the Nelson Section at Owen Junction and joined the railhead at Seddonville. This option was discarded as it would have required a tunnel at least as long as the Otira Tunnel, which could not have been contemplated at the time. = Larry’s Creek extension = Similar to the Inangahua extension, and also because of concerns about the feasibility of a railway through the Buller Gorge, the engineer in charge of the survey party also considered a route up the Maruia River valley, which would have joined the Stillwater – Westport line between Reefton and Inangahua Junction, at or near Larry’s Creek. = Nelson–Blenheim Line = When it became clear that the threat to the future of the Nelson Section was serious, a Nelson – Blenheim link was suggested as an extension of the Nelson Section and an alternate route by which it could be connected to the South Island network to hopefully improve its fortunes. An election promise of the 1957–1960 Labour Government was to look into the possibility of constructing a line between Nelson and Blenheim. This proposal was based on an idea from 1874 for a rail connection between the two towns. On 19 March 1958, a report was released by the Minister of Railways that examined two possible routes, and on 8 April 1959 the Minister of Works proposed a third route. The routes were: * Nelson–Wakapuaka–Havelock–Grovetown/Blenheim: 91½ km via the Tinline and Pelorus valleys, including 9½ km of tunnelling and 2.6 km of bridging. * Nelson–Brightwater–Blenheim: 120 km via the Wairoa River, Goulter River and Wairau River valleys, including 5.6 km of tunnelling. * Nelson–Pelorus Bridge–Havelock–Blenheim: 101.8 km via the Whangamoa and Rai valleys, a more favourable route that required only 4.8 km of tunnelling and 2.3 km of bridging. This route was reported in the news media as being the most likely. In April 1960, the acting Prime Minister announced that the government had selected the cheapest option, with prices ranging from £10,300,000 to £16,500,000. Prime Minister Walter Nash officially opened the project on 1 March 1960 at a ceremony attended by 3,000 people, at which a plaque to commemorate the occasion was unveiled. Work was halted when the Auditor- General declared the project to be illegal under the Public Works Act 1928 until an authorising act was passed. Accordingly, on 29 July 1960, the Nelson Railway Authorisation No 3 Act 1960 was passed, with the government having a majority of one for each vote. The Schedule (Railway Authorised) of the Act provided that: * Name of Railway: Nelson - South Island Main Trunk * Extent Authorised: \\"A line from Nelson via Pelorus Bridge and Havelock to a junction with the South Island Main Trunk Railway in the vicinity of Grovetown. Length about .\\" Work had included reclamation for the new Nelson railway station and yards, and an embankment across mudflats to the main road was under construction. The Railways Department had already determined that the line would initially be uneconomic, but later the operating costs would be covered by revenue from timber traffic alone, without counting all the other industrial freight that could also be expected. In the 1960 general election campaign, the National Party had a policy of stopping the line. When they won the election, Keith Holyoake, the new Prime Minister, announced on 14 December 1960 that all work was to stop forthwith and that the authorisation legislation would be repealed in the first session of parliament. The Act was repealed in 1961. The plaque remained for many years in an open field outside the city but is now located at the Grove railway station in Founders Park. See the Nelson - Blenheim notional railway for details of the subsidy scheme that existed for passengers and freight between Nelson and Blenheim for 22 years between 1957 and 1979.  Today  The Nelson line is still remarkably visible and can be traced for almost every kilometre of its length. The only sign of rail activity in Nelson is a short heritage operation run by the Nelson Railway Society from Founders Historical Park using their own line between Wakefield Quay Station and Grove Station. The society has proposed future extensions of their line, possibly into or near the city centre. The old Nelson station yards are now completely developed over. In 2014 the New Zealand First political party included a proposal to investigate a Nelson- Blenheim line as part of its transport policy. Nelson remains as one of three major urban areas in New Zealand without a rail connection - the others being Queenstown and Taupo.

Synopsis  The book encourages young people to question societal norms and instructs them on how to do this. Out of 200 pages, it includes 20 pages on sex and 30 on drugs, including alcohol and tobacco. Other topics included adults as \\"paper tigers\\", the duties of teachers, discipline, examinations, intelligence, and different schools.  Reception  As a result of its subject matter and its targeted audience of schoolchildren, politicians in many countries criticised the book, fearing it would erode the moral fabric of society and be an invitation for anarchy in schools.2005/214/1 Book, Australian Edition 'The little red schoolbook', Powerhouse Museum, Ultimo, New South Wales, Australia The LRSB was banned in France and Italy. In Switzerland, the Bernese cantonal politician Hans Martin Sutermeister led a campaign against the book. He was initially successful in temporarily blocking the introduction of the book into the country. The subsequent controversy, however, ended his political career, costing him his job as director of the schools of the Swiss capital and contributed to a split in his party, the Ring of Independents, which led to its mid-term decline.Klaus H.

She was quoted in a Daily Telegraph article published on 29 March 1971 asserting the book \\"had caused 'incalculable harm' to children\\" in Denmark\\"; it \\"normalises the most licentious behaviour\\", she believed. Ross McWhirter, in a letter to The Guardian, thought \\"the real issue\\" about the book was its seditious nature.Tracey & Morrison Whitehouse, p. 137. McWhirter: \\"The real issue is, in my submission, that the book is not only obscene, but also seditious\\". The offices of the book's British publisher, Richard Handyside, were raided by the police and the eventual prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act was successful. Headmistress Elizabeth Manners, a witness for the prosecution at the trial, said: \\"It is not true to say that masturbation for girls is harmless, since a girl who has become accustomed to the shallow satisfactions of masturbation may find it very difficult to adjust to complete intercourse. This should be checked, but I believe it to be a fact\\". The court's decision was upheld on appeal on the basis that Handyside had not shown the public interest was served by issuing the book.Tracey & Morrison Whitehouse, p. 140 It reached the European Court of Human Rights in the case known as Handyside v United Kingdom. The government however allowed a second, censored edition to be published, in which some of the passages criticised in court were amended or cut.

Life Biddlecombe, born at Portsea, Portsmouth, was the son of Thomas Biddlecombe of Sheerness Dockyard, who died on 12 September 1844. He was educated at a school kept by Dr. Neave at Portsea, and joined the ship Ocean of Whitby as a midshipman in 1823. After some years, he left the mercantile marine, and, passing as a second master in the royal navy in May 1828, was soon after employed in surveying in the Ætna and the Blonde until 1833. He was in active service on various ships until 1854, being specially noted for the great skill which he displayed in conducting naval surveys in many parts of the world. While in the Actæon, in 1836, he surveyed a group of islands discovered by her in the Pacific. When attached to the Talbot, 1838–42, he surveyed numerous anchorages on the Ionian station, in the Archipelago, and up the Dardanelles and Bosphorus; examined the south shore of the Black Sea as far as Trabzon, as well as the port of Varna, and prepared a survey, published by the admiralty, of the bays and banks of Akko. He also displayed much skill and perseverance in surveying the Sherki shoals, where he discovered many unknown patches. A plan which he proposed for a ‘hauling-up slip’ was approved of by the authorities, and money was voted for its construction. For his survey of Port Royal and Kingston he received the thanks of the common council of Kingston, and on 20 August 1843, on the occurrence of a destructive fire in that town, the services rendered by Biddlecombe at imminent risk to himself obtained for him a letter of acknowledgement from the merchants and other inhabitants. Few officers saw more active service at the time. As master of the Baltic fleet, 14 March 1854, he reconnoitred the southern parts of Åland, Hanko Bay, Baro Sund, and the anchorage of Suomenlinna, preparatory to taking the fleet to those places. He conducted the allied fleets to Kronstadt, and taking charge in Led Sund of the Prince steamer, with upwards of 2,000 French troops on board, he carried that ship to the Battle of Bomarsund, and was afterwards present at the fall of that fortress. He was employed as assistant master attendant at Keyham Yard, Devonport, 1855–64, and from the latter date to January 1868 as master attendant of Woolwich Dockyard. He was made a C.B. 13 March 1867, but the highest rank he obtained in the navy was that of staff captain, 1 July 1867. He was knighted by the queen at Windsor Castle on 26 June 1873, and received a Greenwich Hospital pension soon afterwards. He died at Lewisham. Family He married twice, first, in 1842 to Emma Louisa (d. 13 August 1865), third daughter of Thomas Kent, and secondly, in 1866, to Emma Sarah (d. 6 May 1878, age 49), daughter of William Middleton.  Works  Sir George Biddlecombe published the following works: # A Treatise on the Art of Rigging 1848 # Remarks on the English Channel 1850; sixth edition, 1863 # Naval Tactics and Trials of Sailing 1850 # Steam Fleet Tactics 1857 This list does not include the accounts of the surveys made by him in various parts of the world, and which were published by order of the admiralty.

He was born at Isleworth, Surrey and educated at King's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1796, MA in 1799 and DD in 1817; obtained a fellowship and was second member's prizeman in 1797.

The Duke of Wellington transferred him to the more lucrative see of Exeter on 8 April 1830 and again, on 28 October in the same year, to the still more lucrative see of Bangor, which he held up to the time of his death. Bethell was during the whole of his life identified with the High Church party. He was the author of several theological works, the principal of which is A General View of the Doctrine of Regeneration in Baptism (1821). His other works are chiefly charges and sermons.

Life Berry, well known from his various works on family history, was in the earlier part of his life, 1793–1809, employed as a writing clerk to the registrar of the College of Arms. On his retirement from that post, he for some time resided in Guernsey, where he published a very able work called The History of the Island of Guernsey, compiled from the collections of Henry Budd, 1815, 4to. Previously to this, in 1810, he had brought out a work entitled Introduction to Heraldry. Returning to England, he resided at Doddington Place, Kennington, Surrey, and in 1832 commenced A Genealogical Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland. It was a carefully compiled family history, with very beautifully engraved coats of arms, but it did not receive much support, and after the issue of the fourth number, which terminated with an account of the dukes of Rutland, no further parts were printed. His Genealogia Antiqua, or Mythological and Classical Tables, published in 1816, met with more success, and a second and improved edition appeared in 1840. This work was dedicated to Lord Grenville. His next undertaking was entitled Encyclopedia Heraldica, or Complete Dictionary of Heraldry. It was brought out in numbers between 1828 and 1840, and forms four quarto volumes. This is a valuable heraldic work, as it embraces the greater part of the contents of Edmondson and other writers, with much original matter. Perhaps, however, the writings by which Berry is best known are his county genealogies published in small folio volumes, at five or six guineas per volume. These were Kent, 1830; Sussex, 1830; Hampshire, 1833; Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Surrey, 1837; Essex, 1839; and Hertfordshire, 1842. The three latter volumes were printed by means of lithography from the handwriting of the author. The first portion of The County Genealogies, Kent, being severely reviewed in The Gentleman's Magazine, and objections taken to Berry calling himself on the title-page of that work registering clerk in the College of Arms, he brought an action for libel against Messrs. J. B. Nichols & Son, the publishers of the magazine. The trial took place in the Court of King's Bench before Lord Tenterden on 1 November 1830, when, although the plaintiff was represented by Henry Brougham, afterwards the Lord Chancellor, the jury, without hearing any rebutting evidence, almost immediately gave a verdict in favour of the defendants. Berry died at his son's residence, Spencer Place, Brixton, 2 July 1851, aged 77, having survived his wife two months.

A major broadcast network will ask a program producer to share in the financial risk when considering adopting a new program to its schedule; at least for the first season of the series. Deficit financing is often the norm for scripted television, this came during the Post Network Era. Deficit financing however, does not cover the cost of product, which leads to a deficit for the studio. Television deficit financing also helps to minimize the substantial risks and costs of developing programs for the networks and gives studios initial benefits as well. The studio bears the difference between production costs and licensing fees, but recoups significantly more money if the show is sold in syndication. The main benefit of deficit financing comes from syndication, this offers different windows for the program, i.e. first run syndication, second run, cable, etc. There is both good and bad to deficit financing, it gives the studios the opportunity to gain major rewards, but they are also taking most of the risk. For networks, they are minimizing most of their risk, but they risk losing out on most profit. If the network orders enough episodes of a show, the studio can then sell the series to other markets. Deficit financing minimizes risks and costs of developing programs for networks.Lotz, Amanda D. (2007) “The Television Will Be Revolutionized”. New York, NY: New York City University Press. p. 83 Television deficit financing is said to be a risk for both sides because they lead deficit financing became the norm for scripted television. The network pays a license fee to the studio for the right to air the show. The key is license fee does not cover the production cost. It leads to a \\"deficit\\" for the show. The studio then keeps ownership of the show and can resell it to other markets. The difference between studios and networks are then collaborated into deficit financing. Studios actually make the program which equals production. Studios can be network studios such as ABC Studios. An example of a film studio is Warner Brothers. On the other hand, networks organize and distribute shows. Some have been said to be creative. The other aspect of deficit financing is broadcast syndication. Syndication is where the huge money is produced. There are different windows in syndication. The different windows first run syndication, second run, and cable.

John Blackall was the sixth son of the Reverend Theophilus Blackall, a prebendary of Exeter Cathedral, by his wife Elizabeth Ley, and grandson of Bishop Ofspring Blackall, was born in St. Paul's Street, Exeter on 24 December 1771. He was educated at Exeter grammar school, and then studied at Balliol College, Oxford, as a member of which he graduated B.A. in 1793, M.A. in 1796, M.B. in 1797, and M.D. on 2 March 1801. Immediately after taking his first degree he applied himself to the study of medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and it was in its wards, while working as the clinical clerk of Dr. John Latham, that he made the observations on albuminuria which were afterwards stated and enlarged in his treatise on dropsies. In 1797 he settled in his native city, and on 1 June in that year was chosen physician to the Devon and Exeter Hospital. At this period, however, the medical practice of Exeter was engrossed by Dr. Hugh Downman, Dr. Bartholomew Parr, and Dr. George Daniell, and in 1801 Dr. Blackall resigned his appointment at Exeter, and settled at Totnes, where he became the physician of the district. His reputation increased, and in 1807 he returned to Exeter, where he was a second time elected physician to the Devon and Exeter Hospital, and in 1812 was appointed physician to St. Thomas's Lunatic Asylum. In 1813 he published his well-known Observations on the Nature and Cure of Dropsies, London, 8vo, of which there are four editions, and which entitles its author to a position among medical discoverers. Dropsy is the morbid effusion of the serum of the blood into the cavities of the body and into the meshes of its tissues. It had been observed from the beginning of medicine, but up to the time of Richard Lower nothing was known of its morbid anatomy. He made the first step, which was the demonstration that dropsy of a limb always follows direct obstruction of its veins. Blackall's discovery came next, and was that dropsy is often associated with the presence of albumen in the urine. His treatise states clearly the relation between albuminuria and dropsy, and shows that he suspected that the kidneys were diseased in these cases. The further discovery of Richard Bright in 1836 of the constant relation between renal disease and albuminuria is based upon the observations first made by Blackall. Blackall also published in 1813 some observations on angina pectoris, a disease then much discussed, owing to William Heberden's writings upon it. Blackall was admitted candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1814, and a fellow on 22 December 1815. His progress from this period was rapid and uninterrupted, and for a long series of years he had a great practice in the west of England. He was famed for his skill in diagnosis, and it was based upon a thorough method of clinical examination. He used no complicated remedies, was patient in waiting for results, and was justly confident in the conclusions to which he had attained with so much care. Dr. Blackall retained his strength and faculties to an advanced age, and he did not relinquish private practice till he was eighty. He died at Southernhay, Exeter, on 10 January 1860, and was followed to the grave in the burial-ground of Holy Trinity Church by a large body of relations and friends and the whole of the medical profession resident within the city.

He undertook garrison duty in Nova Scotia later that year.Heathcote, p. 47 Peninsular War Blakeney joined Sir Arthur Wellesley in Spain in June 1810 and commanded the 2nd Battalion of his regiment during the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810 and the Battle of Albuera (where he was severely wounded in the thigh) in May 1811. He commanded both battalions of his regiment at the Combat of Aldea da Ponte in September 1811, at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812 and at the Siege of Badajoz (where he was severely wounded through the arm in the assault) in April 1812. He also commanded at the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813, at the Combat of Pampelona in June 1813 and at the Battle of the Pyrenees in July 1813 as well as the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813. Promoted to colonel on 4 June 1814 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 2 January 1815, he fought at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 during the War of 1812. Although he did not take part in the Hundred Days, he joined the Duke of Wellington as he marched into Paris in 1815 and served with the Army of Occupation in France until 1819. Later years Promoted to major general on 27 May 1825, Blakeney commanded a brigade in the army under General Henry Clinton sent on a mission to Portugal to support the constitutional government against the absolutist forces of Dom Miguel in 1826. Blakeney went on to become Commander-in-Chief, Ireland in Spring 1836 at a time when the deaths and starvation in Ireland caused by the Great Famine were giving rise to civil unrest and the need to use coercion to maintain order.Saville, p. 156 He was appointed a Lord Justice of Ireland on 7 May 1836 and promoted to the local rank of lieutenant-general on 26 August 1836 and to the substantive rank of lieutenant-general on 28 June 1838. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Bath on 7 May 1849 and, having been promoted to full general on 20 June 1854, retired from active service in 1855. Blakeney also served as honorary colonel of the 7th Regiment of Foot, then as honorary colonel of the 1st Regiment of Foot and later as colonel-in-chief of the Rifle Brigade as well as honorary colonel of the St. George's Rifle Volunteer Corps. He became lieutenant-governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea on 6 February 1855 and then succeeded as Governor of that establishment on 25 September 1856.

Blenkiron was born in Marrick, Richmond, Yorkshire, about 1807. He was originally brought up as a farmer, but he abandoned that pursuit, and moved to London in 1834, and began business as a general agent in Cheapside. In 1845, he added to his establishment a manufactory of stocks and collars, and three years later retired in favour of his son. Blenkiron always desired to be the owner of a racehorse, and in 1847, while residing at Dalston, he purchased a mare named Glance. She was by Venison out of Eyebrow, by Whisker, one of Lord George Bentinck's breeding. In course of time she bore a colt, Young Beverlac, which ran at race meetings with moderate success. The colt was afterwards exchanged for three mares, and these formed the commencement of a stud destined to become the most celebrated of any establishment of horses in Europe. About 1852, Blenkiron, wanting more room, moved from Dalston to Middle Park, Kent. He brought with him seven or eight brood mares, and Neasham, the head of the list of Eltham sires. The establishment now rapidly increased, until it was augmented to upwards of two hundred of the highest class and best mares that money and experience could produce. Kingston, Touchstone, Birdcatcher, and Newminster were the four cornerstones of his extensive stud, and it was to the first of these that he, to a great extent, owed his success as a breeder; for that horse was the sire of Caractacus, who was perhaps the most sensational Derby winner on record. As a breeder of stock he had few equals in the matter of judgement, and no superior in the extent of his dealings. Whenever he desired to buy either brood mares or stallions, it was not of the least use to oppose him at an auction sale. Amongst his very numerous purchases he gave 3,000 guineas for Kingston, 5,000 guineas for Blink Bonny, 5,800 guineas for Gladiateur, 2,000 guineas for Rosa Bonheur, and 5,000 guineas for Blair Athol. The horses were pastured and stabled at his three establishments at Middle Park, Waltham Cross, and Esher. He was never satisfied unless he was constantly weeding and improving his stock. The annual sales of stock at Middle Park drew together all connected with the turf, not only in England, but from France and other countries. Middle Park was then the largest breeding stud that any country ever saw, and considered one of the sights of England. After 1866 it was found necessary to hold two annual sales to dispose of the increase in the stock. Blenkiron bred Hermit, the Derby winner in 1867, and Gamos, which won the Oaks in 1870. These stud farms paid their proprietor a handsome return on his outlay during his lifetime, and his liberality was shown in many ways, conspicuously, however, in his founding the great two-year-old race at Newmarket, to which he contributed for some time 1,000l. a year. He died at Middle Park 25 September 1871, in his sixty-fourth year, and was buried in Eltham churchyard 30 September.

Operated by Horizon Health Network, it is a modern 50-bed tertiary care facility. History Centracare's history can be traced to 1835 when the Provincial Lunatic Asylum was constructed at the corner of Wentworth and Leinster streets in \\"uptown\\" Saint John, making it the first mental health facility constructed in British North America. Its first director was Dr. George Peters who served from 1835–1848. Ground was broken in 1846 on a new facility to be constructed of stone to replace the aging wooden structure at Wentworth and Leinster. This new building was to occupy a commanding location in the neighbouring city of Lancaster, on a high bluff on the west bank of the Saint John River overlooking the Reversing Falls gorge which was immediately upstream. An infamous nearby road intersection at the west end of the Reversing Falls Bridge called \\"Simms Corner\\" (after the T.S. Simms & Co. Ltd. paint brush factory) was located on the north side of the property. The first 90 patients moved into the building on December 12, 1848. Dr. John Waddell served as director from 1849–1875, living for 26 years with his family in an apartment on the third floor of the building above the main entrance. Dr. James T. Steeves took over the position as director and served from 1875–1895. The late 1870s saw tremendous growth in the number of patients being admitted, leading to overcrowding and turning away patients. The Great Fire of 1877 would have been easily viewed from the institution's location overlooking the city, however it was noted that this disaster did not have a significant effect upon the patients. The building was modernized and living conditions improved during capital expenditures during the late 1870s that saw rooms painted and decorated, as well as the installation of dumbwaiters and elevators, hot water throughout the building, improved ventilation, water closets, and a central laundry service operating steam-heated washers and dryers. An 1878 addition (the first of five) was constructed to the building for housing male patients and a workshop was opened for them in 1880. In 1881 an addition was constructed for female patients which helped to relieve overcrowding concerns. The hospital contained 15 wards which separated men from women, as well as paying patients from non-paying patients and by varying degrees of severity of illness. Able-bodied patients were expected to work in the building's laundry or clean various parts of the facility in order to pay for their stay. The Annex Farm opened on the Sand Cove Road in southern Lancaster, overlooking the Bay of Fundy in 1885 and many residents worked there as well. Dr. George A Hetherington served as director from 1896–1903 and oversaw improvements to the property's exterior, including various walkways, pathways and gardens of the Asylum as part of a project to encourage patients to do more outdoor activities. He was also an advocate of hydrotherapy and led the Asylum through various implementations of this form of treatment. Dr. James Vickers Anglin was the longest serving director of the Asylum from 1904–1934 and lived in the director's third floor apartment with his wife and five children. In his first year as director, the institution changed its name to the Provincial Hospital of Nervous Diseases. He oversaw numerous capital improvements including repainting of rooms, a new heating system, hardwood floors throughout the building's living and common areas, as well as the installation of electricity and lighting. Patient overcrowding during the 1920s, possibly as a result of New Brunswick veterans returning from World War I, led to another addition constructed in 1927–1929 which saw two new wards, a kitchen and storeroom built. A 1934 report indicated that from the institution's opening in 1849, it had treated 11,796 patients, of which 4,708 were discharged and \\"fully recovered\\". Dr. E.C. Menzies served as director from 1934–1956 and oversaw ongoing capital improvements to the wards and treatment facilities, including the construction and installation of an operating room, X-ray department and sterilizing equipment in 1936; prior to this, patients had to be transferred to the General Hospital. World War II saw a shortage of staff in trained doctors, nurses and ward attendants. An electroencephalogram was installed in 1951. The facility also purchased various residential properties along nearby Lancaster Avenue to serve as housing for the institution's staff. The hospital experienced severe overcrowding during the late 1940s and early 1950s as the number of patients increased dramatically following the war when soldiers were repatriated to New Brunswick. Consequently, the provincial government decided to fund the province's second psychiatric hospital, the Restigouche Hospital which opened its doors in 1954 in Campbellton. In 1955, the provincial government studied replacing the Saint John facility with a new building on the property occupied by the Annex Farm; the farm property had been expanded by in 1945. The proposed facility replacement project was cancelled in 1958 with a change in government. In December 1956, the hospital recorded the highest number of patients in its history with 1,697 having been admitted. Dr. Robert A. Gregory served as director from 1956–1969, followed by Dr. Ishan Kapkin from 1969–1971. In 1970 the Provincial Hospital Annex (also known as the Provincial Hospital Farm) was sold to the private sector. Dr. Allan Robertson was the director of the institution from 1973–1977 and led efforts to convince the provincial government to replace the facility with more modern infrastructure. This period also saw considerable debate in the government led by Premier Richard Hatfield over what to do about modernizing community care for the mentally ill. Dr. H. Leonard Sussman served as director from 1977–1978, followed by Dr. John A. Finley from 1978–1981, Dr. J. C. Theriault from 1981–1983, Dr. Pierre Deom from 1985–1986 and Dr. James Millar from 1986–1995. In 1985 the New Brunswick Mental Health Commission was established as the first of several steps in modernizing and de-centralizing institutional care in the province. At this time the institution was renamed Centracare. In 1992, Centracare came under the administration of the Region 2 Hospital Corporation, later renamed the Atlantic Health Sciences Corporation which was the health authority charged with administering hospitals and health care facilities across southwestern New Brunswick. In January 1996, it was decided by AHSC to change the focus of Centracare from a facility-oriented view to a program- oriented view. Linda Nice was appointed director and funding was secured from the provincial government for a replacement residential care facility while plans were made to demolish the original institution in Lancaster (now part of the city of Saint John). In April 1997 a $4.4 million (CAD) tender was issued to construct the new 50-bed psychiatric hospital in suburban South Bay. The new facility opened in the spring of 1998 and provides tertiary level psychogeriatric and psychosocial rehabilitation services and is the focal point of AHSC's mental health care that also includes psychiatric services at the Saint John Regional Hospital and through various Community Mental Health Clinics. The massive 150-year-old original Centracare property in Lancaster, which was first called the Provincial Lunatic Asylum, had been purchased from the provincial government by industrial conglomerate J.D. Irving Limited for $1 million (CAD) in 1998. The building was vacated after the last 48 patients were moved from the building in the spring of 1998 to Centracare's new psychiatric hospital at South Bay. J.D. Irving began the massive demolition of the vacant psychiatric hospital in Lancaster on March 9, 1999 and the entire structure was levelled within days. Some of the rubble was used to fill the basement while the rest was hauled away to a nearby construction and demolition landfill. The site was then hydroseeded and the property has been turned into a privately owned but publicly accessed urban park named Wolastoq Park administered by J.D. Irving Ltd. The park has views of the Reversing Falls gorge and the Saint John skyline.

It is located on the southern slopes of the Troodos Mountains and is one of the wine villages (, krasochoria). Platres is the largest Troodos resort, situated about 5km from Troodos Square, north-west of Limassol and south-west of the capital Nicosia. Platres is a very old village and is mentioned among the 119 villages of the Limassol district that existed during the Lusignan Era (1192-1489 AD) and the Venetian Era (1489-1571 AD). Platres is the principal hill resort of Cyprus. The town has a resident population of fewer than 300, but this can swell to 10,000 during tourist seasons. The village is often called Pano Platres after the village of Tornarides, which is a smaller residential settlement situated some 3km to the south-west, was renamed Kato Platres (; English: Lower Platres). Locals still continue to refer to Pano Platres as just Platres. History In the past the villagers were mainly shepherds and vine growers. Later most vine fields were converted to orchards, producing cherries, apples, pears, peaches and more. However, since the early 20th Century many people have dedicated themselves to the booming tourism sector. Platres has been a popular hill resort since the British took control of the island of Cyprus in 1878. In the arid hills of the Troödos range, Platres is relatively unusual in straddling a perennial stream, providing a reliable source of drinking water and allowing a profusion of foliage not commonly seen on the island. Importing their taste for cool retreats, away from the heat of the coast, the colonial settlers rapidly established a network of hotels, bars and shady walks around the small village that previously existed on the site. Over the years, Platres gained a reputation as the destination for notable people, including King Farouk of Egypt and the Nobel Prize-winning poet Giorgos Seferis. The Brandy Sour cocktail, a drink intimately associated with Cypriot cuisine, was developed for King Farouk during the late 1930s, at the Forest Park Hotel which is situated in Platres. The same hotel is also known as the location at which British writer Daphne du Maurier composed the majority of her novel Rebecca. These are some of the reasons that Platres have been recently called \\"The Village of Kings and Poets\\". Tourism and amenities The resort retains many hotels and bars, and operates as both a cooler alternative to the major coastal resorts during the summer, and as a skiing base during winter months for the nearby ski slopes of Mount Olympus. Fountain of Roxanne Koudounaris in the Winter Platres are the starting point for several nature trails as well as the Troodos Cycling Routes. Through the path of the Troodos Cycling routes, as well as some of other hiking trails is the area of Ayia Irini (located in the northeast of the village on the road leading from Psilodentro Area to Mesa Potamos). From the rock of Ayia Irini visitors can see Platres village. It is said that in the area during the Middle Ages (Frank Rule) a Frank monastery with a small settlement existed at the area. Nature trails include the Kalidonia Nature Trail which passes from the Caledonia Waterfalls (, ) as well as the Millomeris Nature Trail that leads to the Millomeris Waterfall (). The village Old Municipal Market was renovated in the last years and transformed into a Cultural Center. The main area was renamed at Giorgos Seferis Hall and it can host exhibitions, conferences, seminars, concerts, plays and audio- visual projections. Platres Athletic Sports Center () is located at an altitude of 1050m in the Troodos Mountains. This sports center has a football pitch, mini football, basketball, tennis, volleyball, handball, bicycle center as well as fitness and Spa facilities. It has locker rooms and a coffee shop. The center hosts the yearly 'Cyprus Junior Tennis Tournament', 'Cyprus Downhill Race' as well as other tournaments. Its football pitch is the main practice location for most of the Cyprus 1st division football teams during the hot months of Cyprus. A bicycle center, in combination with the nearby Milia Bridge Trail (used by MTB Cyprus Downhill community in addition to hikers), the Troodos Cycling Routes and all the year round events have made the Platres Athletic Sports Center one of the landmarks on all year round sports. Milia Bridge () is one of the old surviving landmarks that still stand intact. It's situated just below the village inside the forest. It provided a crossing point over Krios Potamos. Krios Potamos () (Krios River) starts at Mount Olympus peak and is the life giving river of Platres, since it is one of the very few rivers in Cyprus that flow all year round.

Bookseller After an education at Winchester, James was sent to Göttingen to perfect himself in German and French. He helped his father for some years, but in February 1834 started bookselling on his own account at 12 King William Street, Strand. Here his great knowledge of books soon attracted many customers, and his shop became a meeting-place for some of the most learned men of the day. In 1840 he published a 792-page catalogue: its contents included nearly complete lists of the works of Gilbert Burnet, Daniel Defoe, Thomas Hearne, and Joseph Ritson. Family Herald Bohn was not successful at that location and, in 1845, had to start again at 66 St. James's Street. Here he republished William Dugdale's Monasticon in eight heavy folio volumes. His business again proved unsuccessful, he gave up his shop in 1847, and turned his attention to literature. For many years he contributed to the Family Herald, and also acted as assistant editor on the Reader. Final work In 1857 he prepared for David Nutt a 704-page catalogue of theological books in foreign languages, enriched by many original notes. For several years before his death he was employed by his friend Nicholas Trübner, of Ludgate Hill. Here he compiled several catalogues of Brazilian, Mexican, Spanish, Portuguese, Latin, German, and French books.

Its core is being built by Masdar, a subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company, with the majority of seed capital provided by the Government of Abu Dhabi. Designed by the British architectural firm Foster and Partners, the city relies on solar energy and other renewable energy sources. Masdar City is being constructed east-south-east of the city of Abu Dhabi, beside Abu Dhabi International Airport. Masdar City hosts the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The city is designed to be a hub for cleantech companies. Its first tenant was the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, which has been operating in the city since it moved into its campus in September 2010.  Design and intent  The project is led by Masdar, a subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company. Initiated in 2006, the city was envisioned to cover and estimated to cost . It would take approximately eight years to build, with the first phase scheduled to be completed and habitable in 2009. Construction began on Masdar City in February 2008 and the first six buildings of the city were completed and occupied in October 2010. However, due to the impact of the global financial crisis, the initial was estimated for completion in 2015; final completion was pushed back to between 2020 and 2025. By 2016, less than had been developed and final completion was estimated to be 2030. As designed, the city would be home to 45,000 to 50,000 people and 1,500 businesses, primarily commercial and manufacturing facilities specialising in environmentally friendly products. In turn, more than 60,000 workers are expected to commute to the city daily. , fewer than 2,000 people are employed in Masdar, and only the 300 students of the Masdar Institute live on site. Masdar City will be the latest of a small number of highly planned, specialised, research and technology-intensive municipalities that incorporate a living environment, similar to KAUST, Saudi Arabia or Tsukuba Science City, Japan. Partners in the project through its Clean Tech Fund are Consensus Business Group, Credit Suisse and Siemens Venture Capital. Construction of the first phase of the project is being managed by CH2M Hill. Infrastructure construction for the city will be handled by the Al Jaber Group and design of the central Masdar headquarters building has been awarded to Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture. The city's wayfinding system was developed by Endpoint and City ID. = Architecture = Masdar is a sustainable mixed-use development designed to be very friendly to pedestrians and cyclists. Masdar City has terracotta walls decorated with arabesque patterns. From a distance, the city looks like a cube. The temperature in the streets is generally cooler than the surrounding desert. The temperature difference is due to Masdar's unique construction. A wind tower modelled on traditional Arab designs sucks air from above and pushes a cooling breeze through Masdar's streets. The site is raised above the surrounding land to create a slight cooling effect. Buildings are clustered close together to create streets and walkways shielded from the sun. Masdar City was designed by Foster and Partners. Foster's design team started its work by touring ancient cities such as Cairo and Muscat to see how they kept cool. Foster found that these cities coped with hot desert temperatures through shorter, narrower streets usually no longer than . The buildings at the end of these streets create just enough wind turbulence to push air upwards, creating a flushing effect that cools the street. = Transport system = Podcar at a personal rapid transit (PRT) station The initial design banned automobiles, as travel will be accomplished via public mass transit and personal rapid transit (PRT) systems, with existing road and railways connecting to other locations outside the city. The absence of motor vehicles coupled with Masdar's perimeter wall, designed to keep out the hot desert winds, allows for narrow and shaded streets that help funnel cooler breezes across the city. In October 2010 it was announced the PRT would not expand beyond the pilot scheme due to the cost of creating the undercroft to segregate the system from pedestrian traffic. Subsequently, a test fleet of 10 Mitsubishi i-MiEV electric cars was deployed in 2011 as part of a one-year pilot to test a point-to-point transportation solution for the city as a complement to the PRT and the freight rapid transit (FRT), both of which consist of automated electric-powered vehicles. Under a revised design, public transport within the city will rely on methods other than the PRTs. Masdar will instead use a mix of electric vehicles and other clean-energy vehicles for mass transit inside the city. The majority of private vehicles will be restricted to parking lots along the city's perimeter. Abu Dhabi's planned and delayed light rail and metro line will connect Masdar City's centre with the greater metropolitan area.  Commercial tenants and population  = Masdar Institute = The Masdar Institute of Science and Technology is a graduate- level research university focused on alternative energy, environmental sustainability, and clean technology. Its campus is located in Masdar City. The Masdar Institute was Masdar City's first occupant. The design of the campus emphasises flexibility, the use of traditional architectural elements, and modern materials to provide for an optimised combination of natural lighting and cooling that minimise energy needs. By 2013, 336 students were enrolled at the institute. These students were selected from more than 2,000 applicants. 42% of enrolled students are from the UAE and 35% are female. The Masdar Institute plans to eventually enroll about 800 students. Admitted students from all countries are offered a full-tuition scholarships, monthly stipends, travel expenses, laptop computers, textbooks, and accommodation in order to facilitate their studies. Masdar students and faculty are engaged in over 300 joint projects with academia, private enterprise, and government agencies. Their research tends to focus on renewable energy, smart grids and smart buildings, energy policy and planning, water consumption, environmental engineering, and electronics. The Masdar Institute has been behind the engineering plans of Masdar City and is at the center of research and development activities. The institute's building, developed in co-operation with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, uses 51% less electricity and 54% less potable water than traditional buildings in the UAE, and is fitted with a metering system that constantly observes power consumption. = International Renewable Energy Agency = Masdar City will host the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency, commonly known as IRENA. , construction of IRENA's headquarters was underway. Masdar was selected to host IRENA's headquarters after a high-profile campaign by the UAE. In its bid, the UAE offered rent-free offices in Masdar City, 20 IRENA scholarships to the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, and up to US$350 million in loans for renewable energy projects in developing countries. = Siemens = A regional headquarters for Siemens has been built in Masdar City. This building is the most energy efficient in all of Abu Dhabi. In 2014, more than 800 staff will start work there. The LEED Platinum building makes use of sustainable and energy efficient materials and building techniques. It was designed to use 45 percent less energy and 50 percent less water than typical office buildings. The Siemens headquarters won an award for best office building at the Mpim Architectural Review Future Projects Awards in 2012. The Middle East Architect Awards named it both the best and most sustainable office building the same year. The building is built around the idea of a \\"box within a box\\". The structure includes a highly insulated airtight inner façade that insulates from the sun and a lightweight aluminium shading system on the exterior. The plaza beneath the building is funnel- shaped. This shape works to suck prevailing winds underneath the building. Due to the Venturi effect, a breeze flows up to the roof of the building through atria in the buildings structure, cooling public spaces without energy costs. These atria also allow daylight into the centre of the building in order to reduce the need for artificial lighting, further reducing energy consumption. The buildings automation systems are all from Siemens. Siemens signed an initial ten-year lease. = Incubator Building = The Incubator Building includes retail and office space to house start-ups, small-and-medium-sized enterprises, and regional offices for multinationals. The Incubator Building is designed to accommodate roughly fifty companies. Some of the most notable tenants include General Electric, Mitsubishi, Schneider Electric, and the Global Green Growth Institute. The Incubator Building is also home to the first LEED CI-certified office in Abu Dhabi, Alpin Limited. The Incubator Building houses the General Electric Ecomagination Center. The center offers training and exhibitions on energy and water efficiency.  Renewable resources  The original master plan envisioned a city functioning on its own grid with full carbon neutrality. However, the development was later hooked into the public system, and by 2016 its managers determined that the city would never reach net-zero carbon levels. Masdar is powered by a field of 87,777 solar panels with additional panels on roofs. There are no light switches or water taps in the city; movement sensors control lighting and water to cut electricity and water consumption by 51 and 55 percent respectively. Gerard Evenden, the lead architect, says that the original plan for Masdar called for powering the entire city through on-site methods such as rooftop solar panels. He said, > \\"When we started this project, nobody had really looked at doing projects of > this scale. Then you realise it's much more efficient to build your solar > field on the ground in the middle of the desert. You can send a man to brush > them off every day, rather than having to access everyone's buildings > individually, and you can make sure that they are running at their absolute > peak. It's much better than putting them on every building in the city.\\" Blowing sand has been a problem for its solar panels, so Masdar has been working with other companies to engineer surfaces with pores smaller than sand particles to stop them from sticking on the panels. Scientists at the Masdar Institute are also working on coatings that repel sand and bacteria for use on solar panels and in other applications. Besides photovoltaics, concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are being explored. For example, so-called \\"beam down\\" CSP plants have been constructed to test the viability of use in the city. Water management has been planned in an environmentally sound manner as well. Approximately 80 percent of the water used will be recycled and waste water will be reused \\"as many times as possible\\", with this greywater being used for crop irrigation and other purposes. Palmwood screens used in Masdar City The exterior wood used throughout the city is palmwood, a sustainable hardwood-substitute developed by Pacific Green using plantation coconut palms that no longer bear fruit. Palmwood features include the entrance gates, screens and doors.  Reaction  The project is supported by the global conservation charity World Wide Fund for Nature and the sustainability group Bioregional. In 2008, in response to the project's commitment to zero carbon, zero waste and other environmentally friendly goals, WWF and Bioregional endorsed Masdar City as an official One Planet Living Community. The project is also supported by Greenpeace; however, they stress that there should be more focus on retrofitting existing cities to make them more sustainable rather than constructing new zero-carbon cities from scratch. The US Government has supported the project. The US Department of Energy has signed a partnership agreement with the Masdar Group in a deal that will see the two organisations share expertise to support plans on zero-carbon cities. The Alliance to Save Energy honoured Masdar City with a 2012 EE Visionary Award in recognition of the city's contributions to the advancement of energy efficiency. Some skeptics are concerned that the city will be only symbolic for Abu Dhabi. In an interview in 2011, Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School in New York City and an expert in environmental economics, called Masdar \\"a gimmick, a way of attracting publicity and attention.\\" Its use of solar energy is not a practical model for others to follow, Heal further noted, given that few places in the world enjoy as much year-round sunlight as the Persian Gulf. Others have expressed concern that it may become just a luxury development for the wealthy. Nicolai Ouroussoff opined in The New York Times that Masdar is the culmination of the gated community concept: \\"the crystallization of another global phenomenon: the growing division of the world into refined, high-end enclaves and vast formless ghettos where issues like sustainability have little immediate relevance\\".

Timeline =Prologue= Prior to the summer protests, there had been growing unease in the population regarding the economic distress of the country which has stagnant economic growth and is ranked among the 20 poorest countries in the world according to the United Nations.Michael Casey, Monks Put Myanmar Junta in Tight Spot, Associated Press, September 21, 2007. Many, including the United Nations have blamed the economic problems on the inept leadership of the military junta that spends large amount of money maintaining one of the world's largest armies (said to total more than half the country's annual budget).The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest BBC, 02/10/07 In late 2006, the cost of basic commodities began rising sharply in Burma with rice, eggs, and cooking oil increasing by 30-40%. According to the UN, one in three children is chronically malnourished, government spending on health and education is among the lowest anywhere in the world, and the average income is below $300 a year. Living a privileged, parallel existence, Burma's military forces appear virtually a \\"state within a state\\", subject to none of the severe economic insecurity that afflicts the rest of the country. Many of the high ranking army generals have become immensely rich; as witnessed in the video of the wedding of senior general Than Shwe's daughter, who is shown wearing diamonds worth many millions of dollars.The hardship that sparked Burma's unrest BBC News October 2, 2007Burma leader's lavish lifestyle aired BBC, 02/11/2006 According to the BBC, on February 22, 2007, a small group of individuals protested the current state of consumer prices in the country. While the protest was small and careful not to be seen as directed at the military junta, officials jailed nine of the protesters. it was the first street protest seen in Rangoon for at least a decade. =August 15 - Removal of fuel subsidies= On August 15, 2007 the government removed subsidies on fuel causing a rapid and unannounced increase in prices. The government, which has a monopoly on fuel sales, raised prices of fuel from about $1.40 to $2.80 a gallon, and boosted the price of natural gas by about 500%. This increase in fuel prices led to an increase in food prices. Soon afterwards, protesters took to the streets to protest the current conditions. While the International Monetary Fund and World Bank had been recommending the lifting of subsidies for some time to allow for a free market to determine fuel prices,Fuel price policy explodes in MyanmarThe Economic Factors Behind the Myanmar Protests these organizations did not recommend removing all of the subsidies unannounced. The fuel is sold by Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise, a state-owned fuel company. =Initial demonstrations= In response to the increase in fuel prices, citizens protested in demonstrations beginning on August 15. In response to the protests, the government began arresting and beating demonstrators. The government arrested 13 prominent Burmese dissidents including Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, Min Zeya, Ko Jimmy, Pyone Cho, Arnt Bwe Kyaw and Ko Mya Aye.Glenn Kessler, U.S. Condemns Burmese Arrests Of 13 Dissidents: Sharp Increases in Prices Spur Protests Washington Post, August 23, 2007 The government newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported that these individuals' actions caused civil unrest that \\"was aimed at undermining peace and security of the State and disrupting the ongoing National Convention. The United States condemned the arrest of these dissidents on August 22 with the State Department's acting spokesman stating \\"The United States calls for the immediate release of these activists and for an end of the regime's blatant attempt to intimidate and silence those who are engaged in peaceful promotion of democracy and human rights in Burma...We call on the regime to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the leaders of Burma's democracy movement and ethnic minority groups and to make tangible steps toward a transition to civilian democratic rule.\\" On September 5, 2007, Burmese troops forcibly broke up a peaceful demonstration in Pakokku and injured three monks. The next day, other monks later took government officials as hostages in retaliation.Q&A;: Protests in Burma BBC, September 24, 2007 They demanded an apology by the deadline of September 17, but the military refused to apologize. This sparked protests involving increasing numbers of monks in conjunction with the withdrawal of religious services for the military. Their role in the protests has been significant due to the reverence paid to them by the civilian population and the military. After these events, protests began spreading across Myanmar, including Yangon (also known as Rangoon), Sittwe, Pakokku and Mandalay.Monks lead largest Burma protest BBC, September 24, 2007. =Escalation= On September 22, around two thousand monks marched through Yangon and ten thousand through Mandalay, with other demonstrations in five townships across Myanmar. Those marching through the capital were allowed to pass the house of Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.20,000 march in Myanmar protest . Although still under house arrest, Suu Kyi made a brief public appearance at the gate of her residence to accept the blessings of the Buddhist monks. On September 23, 150 nuns joined the protests in Yangon. On that day, some 15,000 Buddhist monks and laymen marched through the streets of Yangon in the sixth day of escalating peaceful protests against the Burmese military regime.Monks' protest swells The Bangkok Post, September 23, 2007. The Alliance of All Burmese Buddhist Monks have vowed to continue the protests until the Burmese military junta is deposed.  September 24  Monks protesting in Yangon, carrying the Buddhist flag On September 24, eyewitnesses reported between 30,000 and 100,000 people demonstrating in Yangon, making the event the largest Burmese anti-government protest in twenty years.100,000 protest Myanmar junta CNN, September 24, 2007. BBC reported that two locally well-known actors, comedian Zargana and film star Kyaw Thu, went to Yangon's golden Shwedagon Pagoda early on Monday to offer food and water to the monks before they started their march. The marches occurred simultaneously in at least 25 cities across Myanmar, with columns of monks stretching up to .US to impose new Burma sanctions BBC, September 24, 2007. At the end of the march, approximately 1,000 monks arrived to greet Aung San Suu Kyi's home but were denied access by police. They chanted prayers before peacefully moving off.

In a lifelong partnership with John Vaughan, Bolckow set up and ran an ironmaking business which became the company Bolckow Vaughan. It came to operate coal mines, limestone quarries and a major ironworks which stimulated the growth of Middlesbrough. Bolckow became the town's Mayor and its first Member of Parliament. Biography =Early life= Heinrich Bölckow, the son of Heinrich Bölckow of Varchow, in the region of Western Pomerania, and his wife, Caroline Duscher, was born at Sülten in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. When he was fifteen his parents placed him in a merchant's office in nearby Rostock, to learn about commerce, and there he made the acquaintance of Christian Allhusen, who in 1827 invited him to move to Newcastle upon Tyne to become his business partner in the corn trade. =Career in England= After several years in business in the north of England, Bölckow became a naturalised British subject in 1841 by act of Parliament and anglicised his name as \\"Henry Bolckow\\". He was persuaded by the ironmaster of the Walkergate works in Newcastle, John Vaughan, to invest in the burgeoning iron trade. At the suggestion of Joseph Pease they set up their first iron foundry and rolling mill at Vulcan Street, Middlesbrough, where they processed pig iron imported from Scotland. In 1846 the pair opened Witton Park Ironworks, to the west of the town, where ironstone from Grosmont, could be smelted in blast furnaces to produce the pig iron for the Vulcan Street works. The high transport costs generated by this operation led the partners to look closer to home for their raw materials, and in the end they found what they were looking for on their own doorstep. In 1850, Vaughan and his geologist John Marley discovered large seams of iron ore at Eston, in the nearby Cleveland Hills. A year later they began mining there, and soon a branch railway line was built to transport the ore to Middlesbrough.North East England History The rapid success of their business enabled them to expand their operations, acquiring coal mines, limestone quarries, brickworks, gasworks and a machine works. =Founding Bolckow, Vaughan= In 1864, the firm of Bolckow, Vaughan was formed into a limited liability company with a capital of £2,500,000, and with Bolckow as its first chairman.Durham Mining Museum: Bolckow, Vaughan & Co. Ltd. This shows that the date in the Dictionary of National Biography (Bölckow, Henry William Ferdinand) used in earlier versions of this article is inaccurate., alternative link via www.edwards.usask.ca By 1868, Middlesbrough was producing four million tons of iron per year, and the town's population had risen to 40,000. It became a centre of such importance that, in 1853, the town received a charter of incorporation, Bolckow becoming the first Mayor of the new municipal corporation, with Vaughan following him two years later. The introduction of the Bessemer process in the 1850s and the subsequent mass-production of both mild steel and hardened tooling steel impacted greatly on the iron manufacturers, as the new process could produce metals far more cheaply. The firm of Bolckow & Vaughan were slow to adapt, mainly because the local iron ore had a high phosphorus content and the original 'acid' Bessemer process required pig-iron low in phosphorus to produce usable steel; thus by the late 1870s the town was suffering a major economic downtown with unemployment running very high. In 1875 a rival firm, Dorman Long, was set up in the Middlesbrough area, producing steel from imported iron. Bolckow was aware that the townsfolk worked long hours and lived in cramped conditions. He spent £20,000 purchasing and landscaping of land near the town centre to create a free public park for them. Albert Park was opened on 11 August 1868 and named in memory of Albert, Prince Consort, who like Bolckow came from Germany. The following year he spent £7,000 of his own money to build a school in the St Hilda's district of the town. =Later life= When the town was granted parliamentary representation under the Representation of the People Act 1867, Bolckow stood as a Liberal Party candidate. Bolckow was elected unopposed as its first Member of Parliament (MP) on 16 November 1868, and he held that position for 10 years until his death. Statue of Bolckow, Middlesbrough by David Watson Stevenson, 1881 In 1877 Bolckow became ill, suffering from kidney disease. In May 1878 he was taken to Ramsgate, where it was thought the sea air would do him good. He made a temporary recovery but had a relapse and died on 18 June at the Granville Hotel, Ramsgate. He was 71. He was buried at St Cuthbert's Church, Marton, near to where his friend and partner Vaughan had been buried ten years before (9 September 1868). Their gravestones, which were neglected and fell into disrepair during the twentieth century, were restored in early 2009. Henry was twice married. In 1841, he married a widow Miriam Hay, whose sister was married to Vaughan (indeed it's thought the men met while they were courting the sisters). Miriam died the following year and Henry remarried in 1851, when he wed Harriet, only daughter of James Farrar, of Halifax. In his lifetime, Bolckow collected paintings, nearly all of them by living French and English artists.(Athenæum, 22 November 1873, pp. 664–6) A statue (pictured) commemorating Henry Bolckow stands in Middlesbrough's Exchange Square, diagonally opposite the railway station. During his spell as Mayor, Bolckow erected a granite urn dedicated to Captain James Cook in the grounds of his residence, Marton Hall, near to the reputed site of the cottage in which Cook was born. The Hall burnt down in 1960, but the urn remains in what is now Stewart Park, which also contains the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum.

Booth was owner and farmer of the estate of Killerby near Catterick, Yorkshire, where, in 1790, he turned his particular attention to the breeding of shorthorns, selecting his cows from Mr. Broader of Fairholme, and the bulls from the stock of his contemporaries, Messrs. Robert and Charles Colling. His great aim was to raise a useful class of animals, that, besides possessing beauty of form, would milk copiously, fatten readily, and when slaughtered turn out satisfactorily to the butcher. With these views he sought to reduce the bone of the animal, especially the length and coarseness of the legs, the prominency of the hips, the heavy bones of the shoulders, and those unsightly projections called shoulder points, which previously were great defects in the unimproved shorthorns. In these efforts he was most successful, and his cows and bulls for many years carried away the highest prizes at the chief exhibitions of stock. About the period of 1814 he was considered to be the most enterprising and skilful improver of cattle in his district, if not of his day. He removed to Warlaby in 1819, and gave up the Killerby estate and part of the shorthorn herd to his eldest son, John Booth, taking the remainder with him to Warlaby, where he died in 1835. By his wife, Miss Bower, he had two sons, equally celebrated with their father as cattle breeders. John Booth, the eldest, had his own ideas about breeding stock. With infinite judgment he found among the pastures round Richmond fresh crosses for his cattle, and the public had such confidence in his judgment that they felt sure of his success in whatever he did. He found time to run horses at Catterick, and his dog Nips won the Wensleydale Cup in a coursing contest at Leyburn. For three seasons he was master of the Bedale hunt, and a constant attendant at the meets. Much of his time was also occupied in acting as a judge at exhibitions of stock. All his stock were sold off on 21 September 1852, when forty-four lots averaged 48l. 12s. 8d. He died at Killerby on 7 July 1857, aged 68, and was buried at Ainderby. Shortly afterwards a window to his memory was erected in Catterick church. In 1819 he married Miss Wright, by whom he left several sons, well known in the county. Richard Booth, the second son of Thomas Booth, inherited with his father's name his full share of his father's skill as a breeder, with an equal fondness for the pursuit. He removed to Studley farm in 1814, which was speedily stocked with shorthorns. He was a great believer in in-breeding, and when he sold off in 1834 the best cows were fine animals in direct descent from Twin Brother to Ben, a bull bred by his father as far back as 1790. He gave up Studley farm in 1834, and sold off the whole of his herd except Isabella by Pilot, and retired to Sharrow, near Ripon. On the death of his father in the following year he succeeded to the estate and shorthorn herd at Warlaby, and again turned his attention to breeding. The judges of those days had not yet learned to distinguish between flesh and fat, and although the Booth cattle did not always carry away the prizes, the butchers well knew their worth, as they made the best carcass meat. When the royal cattle shows began in 1844, although not approving of such exhibitions, he felt obliged to exhibit; and although at first the quality of his cattle was not understood, it was not very long before his name was often found in the lists of those receiving medals and other rewards. He died at Warlaby on 31 October 1864, aged 76.

He is a social and cultural historian whose research has three main strands: * Political communication * The German Occupation of France, and its Legacy * LGBT activism (including perceptions and portrayals of homosexuality, and the 'gay marriage' debate) Now Honorary Vice Secretary of the Association for the Study of Modern and Contemporary France or ASMCF, he previously served twice as both Hon Treasurer and Hon Secretary. He represents both ASMCF and The University of Bath on the University Council of Modern Languages. After primary school education at Wimborne St Giles followed by Cranborne Middle School and Queen Eizabeth's School, Wimborne Minster, Wharton read French and German at Aston University before remaining there for his PhD. First appointed to a lectureship in French Studies at the University of Manchester, Wharton moved in 1990 to Bath where he has remained since. Between 2000 and 2008 he served on the National Executive of both the Association of University Teachers (AUT) and the University and College Union (UCU) which was formed through the AUT's merger with Natfhe in 2006; he was the last AUT President (2005/06) and first joint President of UCU (2006/07). He led the union when it successfully took industrial action to raise salaries for the sector in March–June 2006, resulting in the highest uplift in scales for almost 20 years, in part through the application of his tenet of matching the aspirations of activists to the pragmatics of circumstances. Between September 2016 and August 2020 he served as a Director of the Trustee Company of USS, the Universities Superannuation Scheme, appointed by UCU. He was a member of its Governance and Nominations Committee from July 2017, of Policy Committee and Remuneration Committee from May 2018, and was a member of the Rules Group, which reports to the Board through the Policy Committee, from September 2017. He also served as the UCU- nominated Director for Internal Dispute Resolution cases determined by the Scheme’s Advisory Committee following the untimely death of Dave Guppy, another UCU-nominated Director, in December 2019. In February 2012 the French Government appointed him Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Palmes Académiques for services to French Culture. A Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts since 2006 and a Senior Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, he served as Chair of Directors of the trustee company of Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution (BRLSI) from February 2013 to 14 March 2019, and was Vice-Chair of its Management Committee from shortly after his election as Director in October 2011 to 31 January 2018.

Black Into White Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought, Oxford University Press. NY, 1974. However, racial whitening specific to Brazil also encompasses the perception of individuals as being white in relation to their position in the class system.NOGUEIRA, Oracy. \\"Tanto preto quanto branco: estudo de relações raciais no Brasil.\\" São Paulo: TA Queiróz, Série 1 (1985). Supporters of the Whitening ideology believed that the Negro race would advance culturally and genetically, or even disappear totally, within several generations of mixed breeding between white people and black people. This ideology gained its support from two scientific racism beliefs that were prominent during this time. One being social Darwinism, which applied Darwin's theory of natural selection to a society or race, and the other being Aryanism, the belief that the \\"white\\" \\"Aryan\\" race was superior to all other cultures. By combining these two ideas, the white elites of the time believed that because \\"white\\" blood was superior it would inevitably \\"whiten\\" the inferior races' blood. Use of the whitening ideology The actual use of the Whitening ideology seems to be peculiar to Brazil, and was not seen in Europe or the United States. Many Europeans believed that the mixing of races would produce degenerate offspring and they feared mixing could become a threat to the white race. In the United States, a barrier between black people and white people was formed by segregation, which forbade the mixing of the two races. In the 1910s and 1920s, many states in the Southern United States passed the \\"one drop rule\\", which classified a person with any African ancestry, no matter how small or remote, as black. Brazil on the other hand did not have the barrier of segregation, and the Portuguese were more accepting of miscegenation. Brazil was also already a multicultural society that already had a mixed- class. When scientific racist beliefs and ideas became more prominent in the 1850s, Brazil's society felt they needed to find their place in the social order and to do this they needed to solve their problem with the supposedly inferior races. Because they already were a multicultural society, the Whitening ideology was a perfect solution. Most Brazilians thought this approach was a far better one than what the United States had done. A Brazilian statesman compared the United States and Brazil by saying, Result of Brazil's whitening A Redenção de Cam (Ham's Redemption), Modesto Brocos, 1895, Museu Nacional de Belas Artes. The painting depicts a black grandmother, mulatta mother, white father and their quadroon child, hence three generations of racial hypergamy though whitening. Around the late 1920s, scientific racism gave way to environmentalist theories. Gilberto Freyre, a student of anthropologist Franz Boas, was a prominent figure of the conversion. Gilberto Freyre praised interracial partnerships and mating that occurred among the Brazilian population, because they popularized the notion that Brazil was a racial democracy. Rather than seeing interracial mating as an attempt to whiten blood, he saw it as the foundation of Brazilian culture, interpreting it as evidence that Brazil lacked racial relations conflict.  Perception of whiteness in Brazil  Whitening in Brazil is a sociological term to explain the change in perception of one's race as a black or mixed race person rises in the class structure of Brazil. Racial whitening in Brazil is a social concept that is deeply rooted in the history of the nation. Similar to that of the United States, Brazil experienced massive colonization by Europeans and importation of Africans in the 18th and 19th century. This type of political and social climate inherently represses a group of people while one group dominated the other. In the case of Brazil, the white man rose to the top of the social ladder, which left the African slaves and the future Afro- Brazilians repressed for generations to come. Whiteness in Brazil is often defined at the intersection between race and class. In Brazil, one's racial classification is not only dependent on skin color, but is also influenced by the perception of self and the perception from others. Compared to the United States, race in Brazil is not often defined based on the biological make-up of a person. As described by Omni and Winant, racial formation is \\"the process by which social, economic and political forces determine the content and importance of racial categories, and by which they are in turn shaped by racial meanings\\".Omi, M. and H. Winant. 1994. Racial Formations in the United States. New York: Routledge. This suggests that race is defined by social forces and the individual. In Brazil it has been said that race exists on a spectrum and can change based on a number of factors such as social class and educational attainment.Harris, Marvin D. (1964-01-01). \\"Racial Identity in Brazil\\". Luso-Brazilian Review 1 (2): 21–28. Class and education have an influence on the perceived whiteness of an individual. The Brazilian class system is heavily influenced from the history of slavery and colonization. This puts people who identify as white at the top of class system and those who identify as black at the bottom of the class system. Upward mobility is possible in Brazil, but very rare. An aspect that influences the upward mobility of individuals is education. According to Telles, greater education leads to greater whitening. This suggests that one who achieves higher education can be perceived as whiter. Nonetheless, North American anthropologist John F. Collins has suggested that ideologies of whitening have declined markedly, at least in the northeastern state of Bahia. According to Collins, one novel aspect of this shift is not simply a supposedly novel, recent, emphasis on blackness over whitening among many Bahians, but the invocation and generalization by the end of the 20th C. of specific forms of explicitly genealogical imagination that support racial or ethnic identity. A study was done by Chinyere K Osuji on racial boundary policing of Black-White couples in Brazil. Her study shows how race and class are intertwined in order to produce inequality among Brazilians in interracial marriages. Though the idea that interracial marriages in Brazil are used for racial whitening has disappeared since the early 1900s, many interracial couples still feel as though their partnerships are being stigmatized by outsiders. Ethnoracial boundaries continue to divide people of different racial phenotypes as a way of creating distinctions and keeping order in multi-racial societies such as Brazil. Black women are often hypersexualized, and black men are looked down upon for having married a white woman. Whiter Brazilians engage in oppressive othering by speaking or looking at others in ways that make them feel inferior. It is important to note that the particular deployment of the concept of racial whitening may be unique to Brazil. Brazil's apparent flexibility in racial classification system and Brazilians' ostensibly unique interpretation of racial belonging girds this idea. Future research ought to be done elsewhere to see where else this idea of racial whitening exists. People who have made reference to whitening in Brazil *João Batista de Lacerda: Director of the Museu Nacional, wrote a paper named \\"Half-Breeds of Brazil\\". In it he describes the differences in the different races. He also predicted that by the third generation of mixed breeding there are predominantly white characteristics. *Theodore Roosevelt: After visiting Brazil in 1913 he wrote an article in Outlook magazine. In his article he talks about how the Brazilian Negro is disappearing. *Thomas Skidmore: Wrote the book Black into White which covers many of the aspects dealing with Whitening.

This species is of minor importance to commercial fisheries and is also popular as a game fish. Description The head of the giant goby from Italy The giant goby, which grows to in length, is greyish to olive brown with 'pepper and salt' markings. These are especially notable in smaller specimens. in the breeding season the male is darker than the female. The body is covered in small scales, and the tail stalk is short. The eyes are small. Habitat The giant goby inhabits rock pools high up in the intertidal zone of sheltered shores. Occupied pools typically contain boulders under which the giant goby can take shelter, and have inputs of freshwater, so the water in the pools is usually brackish. Diet This species has been recorded to feed upon polychaete worms, green algae of the genus Ulva, amphipods, crabs and insects. Range In the UK, the giant goby is known only from the coasts of south-west England between Wembury and the Isles of Scilly. Outside of the UK it is found from the western English Channel to Morocco, in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and the Gulf of Suez, more than likely a Lessepsian migrant via the Suez Canal. Threats In 1992, giant gobies were absent from one site in south Devon and one from south Cornwall, which are parts of the historic range. It was assumed that the species was in decline, but the species was recorded again in the south Cornwall site in 1998. Although there is no evidence that the species is endangered in the UK, it seems likely that it is vulnerable to human disturbance due to the recreational pressures on the shore habitat. Conservation In Great Britain in 1998 the species was added to Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Under this Act it is an offence to kill, injure, take or sell giant gobies, or to damage or destroy any structure or place used by a giant goby for shelter or protection. Furthermore, it is included in English Nature's Species Recovery Programme.

(21 November 1815 – 2 June 1859) was an Anglican bishop in Sierra Leone. Bowen, son of Thomas Bowen, captain in the 85th regiment, by his third wife, Mary, daughter of the Rev. John Evans, chaplain to the garrison at Placentia, Newfoundland, was born at Court, near Fishguard, Pembrokeshire. At twelve years of age he was sent to school at Merlin's Vale, near Haverfordwest, and in 1830 continued his studies at the same place under the care of the Rev. David Adams. He emigrated to Canada in April 1835, and took a farm at Dunnville, Ontario, on the shores of Lake Erie, where, during the rebellion of 1837–8, he served in the militia. On Sunday, 6 March 1842, he heard a sermon in the church at Lakeshore, Ontario, which made a great impression on his mind, and ultimately led to a desire to prepare himself for the ministerial office. A favourable opportunity having occurred for disposing of his farm advantageously, he returned to England, and in January 1843 entered himself at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated B.A. in 1847, and became LL.B. and LL.D. ten years later. Ecclesiastic career His first appointment was to the assistant-curacy of Knaresborough, Yorkshire, in 1848. While residing here he asked the Church Missionary Society to allow him to visit their numerous foreign stations. The society suggested that he should proceed to Jerusalem, there to confer with Bishop Gobat, and then to visit the missionary stations at Syra, Smyrna, and Cairo; afterwards to journey to Mount Lebanon, Nablous, and other places in Syria, and thence to proceed to Mosul by Constantinople and Trebizond, returning by Bagdad and Damascus to Jerusalem. All this he accomplished, going through many hardships and dangers, and returning to England in December 1851. In 1853 he was named, by the Marquis of Huntly, rector of Orton-Longueville with Botolph Bridge in Huntingdonshire. Having obtained permission from his bishop, he again left England in September 1854, and was absent in the East until July 1856.

On 24 November 1857, he married Catharine Butler, second daughter of Dr. George Butler, dean of Peterborough. They sailed for Sierra leone two days later. However their stay there was brief. His wife died at Freetown, after giving birth to a stillborn son, on 4 August 1858. The bishop died the following year. He had recovered from several attacks of yellow fever. However a malignant fever broke out in the colony, of which he died. He had occupied the see two years and five months.

It has been applied to microfossils of Devonian age with fungal affinities, though these taxa have since been recognized as an early growth form of Tortotubus.  Background  The form genus Ornatifilum was erected by Burgess and Edwards in 1991 to describe tubular fossils retrieved by acid maceration from the late Silurian. It was originally intended as a form genus, to facilitate stratigraphy and environmental reconstruction; the fossils do not display enough features to classify them confidently, even at a kingdom level. The organisms comprise tubes of around 10 μm diameter, with an ornamented, granular surface texture. These fossils were compared to late Silurian (Ludlow epoch) fossils retrieved from the Burgsvik beds by Sherwood- Pike and Gray, and the genus was used when similar fossils were recovered from the Scottish island of Kerrera by Charles Wellman ten years later. Similar, unornamented filaments are known from the USA. However, these latter fossils have now been assigned to Tortotubus.  Ornatifilum granulatum  The type species of the genus consists of flattened filaments – perhaps an artefact resulting from post-burial pressure. Their branching is typically at obtuse angles; the irregularly sized grana, which ornament their surfaces, are concentrated at branching points. They are often found as individuals, but sometimes group together into \\"wefts\\", as Wellman has termed them. The filaments are septate, with the septa looking like \\"pinch points\\" where the tube is slightly constricted – like a twisted balloon. No sign of perforation was visible in the septa; perforate spores are only found in red algae and fungi, but their absence does not preclude their presence in one of these groups: indeed the perforations are difficult to see or image. There are no other diagnostic features of this species that allow classification in any group. Surface ornamentation is a common convergent feature, found for example in liverwort rhizoids and some fungi, so does not help in classification. The specimens recovered are most common in near-shore environments; however, they are never abundant.  Ornatifilum lornensis  Ornatifilum lornensis is a junior synonym of Tortotubus protuberans. It has a more complex appearance than O. granatum. For a start, its surface ornament – which covers most of the surface uniformly – takes an array of forms, with \\"grana, coni, spinae verrucae and occasionally plia\\" 1. * grana: small grains * coni: small cones * spinae verrucae: Spiny warts * plia: small streaky knobs. present. Further, side-branches and the flask-shaped protuberances occasionally protrude from the tubes, on which the ornament is larger (2.5 μm rather than ~1 μm). Such branching typically occurs in pairs across the main thread.

Biography Bowly, son of Sarah (born Crotch) and Samuel Bowly, miller at Bibury, Gloucestershire, was born in Cirencester on 23 March 1802. He had a sound business training under his father. In 1829 he moved from Bibury to Gloucester, and commenced business dealing in cheeses. He was on the board of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway.Samuel Bowly old.quaker.org.uk, Retrieved 3 September 2015 He became chairman of local banking, gas, railway, and other companies, and for the last twenty years of his life he was a leader in commercial circles and affairs. In the agitation against the Corn Laws he took a prominent part, and supported Cobden and Bright. He wanted to give the people cheap and universal education. He was a founders of the British and ragged schools in Gloucester and an advocate of a national system. Bowly belonged to the Society of Friends; he was also a supporter of disestablishment. Bowly took an active part in the anti-slavery agitation, and by his powerful appeals completely beat Peter Borthwick, the pro-slavery lecturer, off the ground. He was one of the deputation, 14 November 1837, which went to Downing Street to have an interview with Lord Melbourne about the cruelties exercised towards the slaves under the seven years' apprenticeship system, and in the following year took an active part in the formation of the Central Negro Emancipation Committee, which was ultimately instrumental in causing the abolition of the objectionable regulations. He is pictured above at the 1840 International Anti-Slavery conference in London. Samuel Bowly On 17 April 1840, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society was formed to campaign for worldwide abolition of slavery. A short time later, the first World Anti-Slavery Convention was held in London, attracting an international participation. Bowly attended the convention and is depicted in a painting The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840 by Benjamin Haydon(1841). However it was his advocacy of temperance that made him best known. It was on 30 December 1835 that he signed the pledge of total abstinence, and formed a teetotal society in his own city. One of his earliest missions was to the members of his own religious society, undertaken in company with Edward Smith of Sheffield, throughout Great Britain and Ireland. During his later years he held frequent drawing-room meetings. As president of the National Temperance League, as president of the Temperance Hospital from its foundation, and as a director of the United Kingdom Temperance and General Provident Institution, he was able to draw the attention of scientific men to the injurious effects of alcohol on the human system. On behalf of the National Temperance League he attended and addressed 107 meetings during the last year of his life, travelling many hundreds of miles. The eightieth anniversary of his birth was celebrated in Gloucester in 1882, and he died in that city on Sunday, 23 March 1884, the eighty-second anniversary of his birthday. He was buried in the cemetery on 27 March, when an immense concourse of people, both rich and poor, attended the funeral. He married, first, Miss Jane Shipley, daughter of Mr. John Shipley of Shaftesbury. His second wife, Louisa Cotterell, was the widow of Jacob Henry Cottrell of Bath, especially known for his connection with the Rechabite Friendly Society. His third child, (of nine) by his first marriage, Martha (1836-1901) married Frederick Goodall Cash (1829-1909), the sixth child of William Cash (1792-1849)of the well-known Coventry weaving family and makers of Cash's name tapes and Elizabeth Petipher Cash née Lucas (1796-1894). Fred and Martha Cash had seven children, of which the youngest Mabel (1868-1956) married the eminent Quaker John Henry Barlow. They had four children (Deborah Phyllis died aged 2 1909) including F Ralph Barlow (1910-1980), a leading member of the Friends' Ambulance Unit in WW2 and who succeeded his father as Director of the Bournville Village Trust. Ralph married Joan Barber (1914-2007) and they had 4 children of whom David Barlow (b.1937), became Secretary of the BBC and Controller of Regional Broadcasting, Antony Barlow (b.1941), an arts administrator and publicist, Stephen Barlow (b.1945) a Birmingham Hotelier and later a freelance distributor, Rosemary Barlow (b.1947), a primary school teacher and Nicholas Barlow (b.1958) an Estate Manager for Lord Aylesbury amongst others.

Note the difference between this protocol, and an earlier (technologically unrelated) protocol named Microsoft ActiveSync. Z-Push enables any PHP-based groupware package to become fully syncable with any ActiveSync-compliant device. Currently, Z-Push includes four backends: the IMAP and the Maildir backend for e-mail synchronization, the vCard backend for contact synchronization and one for the Zarafa package which is sold by allowing full synchronization of E-mail, Calendar, Contacts and Tasks. There is also a 3rd party project that implements a Zimbra Backend allowing Z-push to be used with a ZCS server (Including opensource edition). Since 2.3.0, released in July 2016, significant performance improvements have been achieved, as well as significantly lower memory usage. Connecting to Outlook 2013 and 2016 via EAS is also officially supported. With the optional Kopano Outlook Extension (available only for paid subscribers of Zarafa/Kopano), additional Outlook features are enabled such as Out of Office replies, Notes synchronisation, opening of shared and public folders and synchronisation of the Global Address Book. Z-Push is under active development with new releases approximately every month including bug fixes, improvements and new features. Technical background & Architecture The Z-Push protocol is HTTP based, and uses WBXML (WAP Binary XML) as a communication layer, which is used for bi-directional communication between the PDA/cellular phone and the Server. Inside the protocol there is everything you expect from a synchronization protocol: the process of sending items from one side to the other, while keeping track of what has already been sent. The Z-Push hides the complexity of handling these protocol requests to the backend developer, who only needs to implement various standard functions, like getting a list of items, and getting the data for a specific item. All that is needed is a good understanding of the WBXML object definitions and fields, and a developer can quite easily get the items of any groupware solutions onto the PDA/cellular phone. The Z-Push has various performance and usability-related features; for example, the entire architecture of the project is based on the idea that only one message should ever have to be in memory at one time, even when the server is sending hundreds of messages to a PDA. This may sound easy, but in most XML-based applications, the XML result data is built in-memory before being serialized to the network - exactly the opposite to what Z-Push does, as data is streamed to the client while it is read from the backend. This not only improves already restricted memory usage in PHP, it also makes the progress bar on the client more user-friendly, as data starts arriving as soon as the synchronization request is made. Z-Push has provided a streaming WBXML encoder and decoder to make this happen. When a backend supports it, Z-Push can also make use of advanced features which bring server load down even lower, for example reading message changes directly from a 'diff' source, instead of comparing all the messages with whatever was in there last time. So if the groupware backend can provide a list of changes on-the-fly, then Z-Push can use this information almost instantaneously. Zarafa provides an incremental synchronization backend for its own MAPI-based solution here through their PHP-MAPI extension, enabling extremely low-load synchronizations.

History Originally formed as \\"Greenwood High School\\" in an area where the closest existing schools were boys-only technical colleges, the school first took students in 1971, with an approximately 2:1 ratio of female:male students. The school was built on swampy state government land between the Greenwood Primary School and the Larundel Psychiatric Hospital. After protests by the primary school children, a remaining River Red Gum was preserved by shifting the planned building approximately 3m. As the first buildings had not been completed, classes started at the adjacent Greenwood Primary School (now Bundoora Primary School). The home-economics and the library wing (also used by School Administration at that time) were the first, and only, buildings to be built at that time, on the current site. They were then surrounded by portable classrooms. Once these buildings were ready it was time, for the school to move onto its own site. This occurred during 1971 and the school was officially opened. Greenwood High School was officially opened by the Principal Adrian Callinan in 1971. In 2011 the college celebrated its 40-year anniversary. At the time of its official opening, the school had 4 staff and about 100 students who were all in year 7. Adrian Callinan remained Principal from 1971 to 1975. During this period the population of the school grew to over 600 students. At the time the school was unusual in having an entirely open student-selected curricula at year 10 level, with all subjects offered as options and large time blocks available as untaught study periods. It was also marked by informality at both the student and organizational level, with all staff contributing to management and educational policy decisions at the large weekly staff meeting. Amongst other things, as the school grew, there was no enforced 'school uniform' policy for older students. The informality and student-lead educational policy was treated with some suspicion by parents and the local community, and when Adrian Callinan left, the school moved to a more structured educational and organizational policy. In 1976 Jean Crewther became Principal, holding the position until 1982. It was Jean who had the vision for developing and building the ECA Centre (the gym and drama studio) and it was during this time that the band Pseudo Echo was formed at the school and Mandy Walker, award-winning Australian Cinematographer, was becoming interested in film media. Jason Stacey was playing hockey for Victoria and went on to the Olympic games. It took until 1984 for the ECA Centre building to be completed and to be officially opened. By this time Ray Gillette was the Principal of the school. Ray was Principal of Greenwood High School from 1983 until 1987. During the years from 1971 to 1988 the school uniform was in the Australian colours of green and gold and enrolments at the school grew to over 1200 students. In 1988 Allan Phipps became Principal and it was during his time of leadership that the uniform changed to pale blue and burgundy. The school also changed its name to Bundoora Secondary College. In 1992 Mill Park SC was opened and this had a significant effect on the student numbers at Bundoora Secondary College and enrolment numbers began to decline. Allan continued in the role of Principal until the end of 1996. With 8 years as Principal, Allan Phipps is to date, the longest serving Principal of Bundoora Secondary College. In 1997 Hans Linssen became Principal and remained at the helm until 2001. It was under Hans' leadership that the school underwent its million dollar upgrade. Most notably changes were made to the Administration building. Australian cricketer, Clinton McKay, was a student at the school during these years. Hans was succeeded by Tony Simpson in 2001. Tony was principal until 2004 and under his leadership significant structural changes occurred at the school. Team offices were built to reflect the team structures of Omega and Phoenix and computer pods were developed to assist in rolling out computer technology across the school. In 2005 Stephen Smith became Principal and he continued and embedded Tony's work. Steve also implemented the senior navy blue and white uniform to give an identity to the senior (years 10–12) students. In 2009, Susan Muscat stepped into the role of Principal in an acting capacity and was consequently appointed to the principal role in July 2010. Under Sue's leadership many new programs were implemented at the school. The most significant of these programs being the adoption of the \\"Take Control\\" (TC) model of education, first implemented at Templestowe College. The TC model was implemented at the end of 2016. As a result of this new program, for the first time in a long time, the enrolments increased for 2017. In 2018 the year 7 enrolments doubled and the same is tabled to occur for 2019. Sue retired at the end of 2018. In July 2018 Anesti Anestis was appointed as the new Principal of Bundoora Secondary College. Anesti has made a public commitment to the strength of the educational program at the school and his excitement at being able to extend the implementation of the TC program. Curriculum Bundoora's curriculum provides preparation for all students to gain the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) or the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL). Bundoora's curriculum is comprehensive and tailored to maximise the opportunity for each student to undertake tertiary level study or further training. The curriculum is delivered to three cohorts – Entry (typically year 7), PACE21 (passion, achievement, choice, empowerment, 21st century skills) (typically year 8 – 11) and Graduation (typically year 12). Students at BSC are not bound by the traditional year level classes. The Entry cohort experience a common curriculum. At the conclusion of the student's Entry year they move into the PACE21 cohort where they will experience a vertical offering of subjects which creates student's choice and provides flexibility in the learning program to ensure that all students are engaged in their learning at their point of interest and challenged at their point of need. For example, students in the PACE21 cohort may undertake subjects from the traditional suite of subjects as well as from the College's Pre VCE, VCE or VCAL programs. Graduation students will have the opportunity to be enrolled in university units. In particular Graduation students have access to two university subjects. One is in the Exercise Science stream, the other in Nursing. Both of these subjects contribute to the ATAR score, are HECs free and will provide credits towards a university degree in each of the two identified pathways. This opportunity is available only at Bundoora Secondary College. Partnerships Bundoora Secondary College is Victoria's first government school specialising in partnerships and pathways in the Health and Community Services training and employment sector. Bundoora Secondary College has chosen to focus on the Community Services and Health Industry which is the largest local employer within the City of Banyule. After extensive consultations with Mercy Health Hospital Trainers, ACU and La Trobe Universities, Bundoora Secondary College agreed to participate in a partnership program. This means that Bundoora Secondary is able to offer their senior students entry into the health industry via the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector while the student is still at school and completing either the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) or the Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL). The VET certificate available is at level III in Allied Health, Aged Care or Childcare, all of which will assist in a smooth transition to further study post year 12 at either University or TAFE or to employment. • Opportunities exist to expand this program into other skill shortage areas in health such as dental health and audiology. The school has used locally raised funds to develop a dedicated facility to deliver some of the health programs on the school site. These include Allied Health Services and Community Services – Childcare.

After being educated at the diocesan college in that city, proceeded to Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated B.A. 1823, proceeding to Master of Arts M.A. 1834, and B.D. and D.D. long after, in 1868. He officiated as curate and preacher in the cathedral in Derry from 1827 to 1842, and here he first distinguished himself as an able and powerful preacher, as a controversialist, and as an author. At that time the controversy between the presbyterians and the Church of Ireland in the north of Ireland was at its height. Boyd came to the defence of the church and preached a series of discourses in reply to attacks. These discourses attracted great attention, and were afterwards printed. In 1842, he was appointed perpetual curate of Christ Church Cheltenham. With Francis Close, his fellow-worker here, he joined in a scheme for establishing additional Sunday schools, infant schools, and bible classes. For eight years after 1859, he was entrusted with the care of Paddington. =Dean of Exeter= Cathedral Church of Saint Peter at Exeter where Boyd served as Dean. On 11 November 1867 he accepted the deanery of Exeter, and resigned, with his vicarage, an honorary canonry in Gloucester Cathedral, which he had held since 1857. He was a preaching and a working dean. He was a firm but moderate evangelical, and was a voluminous writer on the ecclesiastical questions of the day. His name is connected with the—at the time well-known—Exeter reredos case. The dean and chapter erected in the cathedral, 1872–3, a stone reredos, on which were sculptured representations in bas-relief of the Ascension, the Transfiguration, and the Descent of the Holy Ghost, with some figures of angels. In accordance with a petition presented by William John Phillpotts, chancellor of the diocese, the bishop (Frederick Temple) on 7 January 1874 declared the reredos to be contrary to law and ordered its removal. After much litigation touching the bishop's jurisdiction in the matter, the structure was declared not illegal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on 25 February 1875Law Reports, BULWER'S Admiralty and Ecclesiastical Reports, iv. 297–379 (1875); COWELL'S Privy Council Appeals, vi. 435–67 (1875) Death and legacy On the continent during the autumn of 1882, Boyd met with an accident at Vienna, from the effects of which he never fully recovered. He died at the deanery, Exeter, on 11 July 1883, bequeathing nearly £40,000 to various societies and institutions in the diocese of Exeter. He left behind his wife, Frances, the daughter of Thomas Waller of Ospringe, and widow of the Rev. Robert Day Denny. She herself died on 6 January 1877. =Works= His works include: * Sermons on the Church, or the Episcopacy, Liturgy, and Ceremonies of the Church of England 1838 * Episcopacy, Ordination, Lay-eldership, and Liturgies 1839 * Episcopacy and Presbytery 1841 * England, Rome, and Oxford compared as to certain Doctrines 1846 * The History of the Book of Common Prayer 1850 * Turkey and the Turks 1853 * Baptism and Baptismal Regeneration 1865 * Confession, Absolution, and the Real Presence 1867 * The Book of Common Prayer 1869 He also printed many single sermons and minor publications.

Kolozov is remembered as a whitehaired man with a white beard who almost resembled Santa Claus in appearance and facial description. He appeared in a variety of roles, but mostly in that of a king, a peasant or God.

Biography Charles McKiernan earned the sobriquet \\"Joe Beef\\" from his time as a Quartermaster with the British Army during the Crimean War. Whenever his regiment was running low on food, McKiernan had a knack of somehow finding meat and provisions, hence the name \\"Joe Beef\\" . The man, who would become famous in Montreal as a gruff philanthropist, came to the city around 1864 as a part of his artillery regiment. He was put in charge of the main military canteen on Saint Helen's Island. Discharged in 1868, he opened \\"Joe Beef's Tavern,\\" an inn and tavern soon known throughout North America, located at 201–207 rue de la Commune in what is now Old Montreal. Beef refused service to no one, telling a reporter, \\"no matter who he is, whether English, French, Irish, Negro, Indian, or what religion he belongs to\\". Every day at noontime, hundreds of longshoremen, beggars, odd-job men and outcasts from Montréal society showed up at his door. The clientele of the tavern was mostly working class. Canal labourers, longshoremen, sailors, and ex-army men like McKiernan himself were mainstays of the business. For working class Montreal, McKiernan's tavern functioned as the centre of social life in Griffintown. At the time, the neighbourhood had no public parks, and gatherings and public celebrations were only occasionally held by national societies and church groups.Brown, James D. & Hannis, David. (2008). Community Development in Canada. Toronto: Pearson Education Canada. Thus, daily recreational activities were centered around Joe Beef's Canteen. An atheist, Beef had the following manifesto printed on handbills and advertisements: The New York Times was not impressed, however, calling Joe Beef's Canteen \\"a den of filth\\" and writing that: Beef was known for keeping a menagerie of animals in his tavern, including four black bears, ten monkeys, three wild cats, a porcupine and an alligator. The bears were usually kept in the tavern's cellar and viewed by customers through a trap door in the barroom floor. He sometimes brought a bear up from the basement to restore order in his tavern, to fight with his dogs or play a game of billiards with the proprietor. One of his bears, Tom, had a daily consumption of twenty pints of beer and would sit on his hindquarters and hold a glass between his paws without spilling a drop. On one occasion, McKiernan was mauled by a buffalo on exhibit and was sent to hospital for a number of days.DeLottinville, Peter. (2006). Joe Beef of Montreal: Working-Class Culture, Community, and the Tavern, 1869–1889. In R. Douglas Francis & Donald B. Smith (Eds.), Readings in Canadian History: Post-Confederation (pp. 370–390). Toronto: Thomson. Another time, a Deputy Clerk of the Peace was inspecting the tavern in order to renew the license and was bitten by one of McKiernan's dogs. He ran his tavern from 1870 until his death from a heart attack in 1889, at the age of 54. Funeral At his funeral, every office in the business district closed. Fifty labour organizations walked off the job while Joe Beef's casket was drawn through the city by an ornate four-horse hearse, in a procession several blocks long. The newspaper La Minerve reported: He is buried in the Mount- Royal Cemetery and his funeral monument, on plot B 991e, bears a long epitaph which testifies to the gratitude of his family and friends, Legacy Despite a lack of formal education, McKiernan considered himself an intellectual and was an avid reader. He engaged in heated debates on the topics of the day and was a champion for the rights of the common man. He entertained the crowds with poetry and humorous stories which lampooned the figures of authority in the workingman's life, such as the employer, the landlord, or the local church minister. He acted as an advocate for the working class population of Griffintown and played an important role in the Lachine Canal workers strike of 1877. He provided them with 3,000 loaves of bread and 500 gallons of stew, and paying the travel expenses of their delegation to Ottawa. As they set off, he addressed a crowd of 2,000 in front of his tavern with a rousing speech \\"delivered in rhymed endings which was heartily applauded.\\" He also assisted strikers at the east-end Hudon textile factory in 1882. As the focal point of social life in Griffintown at the time, Joe Beef's Canteen provided early social services such as housing, food, and casual employment for the poor and downtrodden. He was a central character in a play by David Fennario, entitled Joe Beef. McKiernan was the inspiration behind Joe Beef Restaurant, which opened in 2005 on Notre Dame Street West in the neighbourhood of Little Burgundy and was selected as the 81st best restaurant in the world in 2016 by 50 World's Best Restaurants, the first Canadian restaurant to make the list in six years .

Established on September 1, 2015, it is the largest freshwater marine protected area in the world. Although national marine parks and a reserve had been created previously, and managed as NMCAs, this was the first area in Canada to be designated a \\"National Marine Conservation Area\\" as defined by the Marine Conservation Areas Act. Plans to create it were first announced by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on October 25, 2007, in Nipigon, Ontario. The area is a unit of Canada's national park system administered by Parks Canada. The conservation area extends eastward from Thunder Bay, from Thunder Cape in the west, at the tip of Sleeping Giant Provincial Park, to Bottle Point in the east, and stretches southward to the Canada-US border, linking with Isle Royale National Park. The Nipigon River and Lake Nipigon lie to the north. Designation process Proposals to protect the area were first suggested in the mid-1990s, and formal plans were first announced in 2002. The marine conservation area was proposed after discussion with provincial and First Nations representatives. The First Nations in the area, represented by Wilfred King, the regional grand chief of the northern Superior region, endorsed the proposal once they were satisfied that it respected the Robinson Superior Treaty of 1850. Parks Canada distributed questionnaires to local residents as a public consultation. 67% of respondents supported the \\"largest possible designation area,\\" with 13% opposing any NMCA designation, and the remaining supporting some form of NMCA. In June 2015, the federal government introduced a bill to create the NMCA, which received royal assent on June 24. The law specified that the NMCA would come into force on either the day of approval or on September 1, 2015—whichever came latest. With approval given in June, the park was legally created on September 1. Ecology Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area covers roughly of lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on of islands and mainland. The area is home to numerous species including herons, peregrine falcons, and bald eagles. The spawning and schooling waters of deep coldwater fish, such as whitefish, lake herring, walleye, and lake trout will be protected by this zone. Caribou foraging and calving areas are located on shore. Lake Superior is home to about 70 fish species. The official designation prevents resource extraction or other operations which may damage the aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems in the conservation area. However, per the agreement with the First Nations, it does not exclude all commercial marine activity, such as shipping, and commercial and sport fishing. Acquisition of Wilson Islands In 2009 the Wilson Islands were purchased from private owners. These eight almost untouched islands lie off Rossport in Ontario waters. The acquisition was made by the governments of Canada and Ontario, and the Nature Conservancy of both Canada and the United States, with donated funds, much of which were contributed by U.S. donors. The acquisition had substantial support from the Pays Plat First Nation, which will cooperate in stewardship of the islands. The islands include cliffs, both rocky and sandy shorelines, coastal wetlands, and deep forests. Flora include the rare mountain fir moss and northern woodsia fern; fauna include peregrine falcons, bald eagles, and shorebirds. Their habitat will now be protected from mining and other development. By this acquisition, the marine conservation area, already the largest freshwater protected area in the world, acquires and preserves over 4,700 acres (1,900 hectares) of land in the heart of the preserve.  Relics of human history  Historic shipwrecks lie on the seabed of the Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area, including the Gunilda at Rossport. The shores have two areas of First Nation pictographs and Sibley Peninsula has archaeological sites from Paleoindian, archaic, and woodland settlements.

He is a member of the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame. Career Carlyle learned to skate at his local ice rink in Falkirk, where he also learned to play ice hockey with the Falkirk Lions reserve team, the Falkirk Cubs. He went on to make his senior debut with the Lions when he was 17 years old. Following his National Service, Carlyle helped the Lions to win three Scottish National League playoff series before the club folded in 1955. Whilst with Falkirk, Carlyle had the first of his international call ups to the GB team when he played in the Ice Hockey World Championships in 1950 and 1951 as a forward and defender respectively. Carlyle joined the Harringay Racers in the British National League for the 1955-56 season. He became the team captain the following season and was named to the All-star B-Team. When the Racers ceased playing in 1958, Carlyle returned to Scotland to the Edinburgh Royals. However, they too failed to see out the season and Carlyle finished the 1958–59 season playing with the Nottingham Panthers. The following season was the last of the British National League, and Carlyle spent the time playing with the Brighton Tigers. In 1960 Carlyle took up coaching with the Edinburgh Royals and the team went on to beat all comers during the 1960-61 season. Carlyle received his first call up to the GB team as coach in 1961 when he was player-coach of the team which remained unbeaten in the Pool B tournament  although the team finished runners-up to Norway on goal difference. In the 1961–62 season, Carlyle returned to club playing as the player-coach of the Brighton Tigers. Following two successful seasons with the Tigers, Carlyle again returned to Scotland, this time to the Murrayfield Racers. Carlyle spent ten successful years with Murrayfield and was named as the coach for the All-star A-Team on four occasions between 1967 and 1972. Carlyle again coached the GB team in the 1971 and 1973 Pool C tournaments. Carlyle eventually retired from the game in 1973. Death Johnny Carlyle died on 15 April 2017 in Larbert, Scotland.

His first significant collaboration was in 1980, along with brothers Simon and Tim Knuckey as The Wet Taxis; a band specializing in heavily treated guitar and drum machine and various tape manipulations. The sound was uncompromisingly psychedelic yet fiercely industrial. Next, in 1981, Bradbury teamed up with 2 other (synonymously; Tokyo Rose and Montgomery Smythe) to form Hiroshima Chair an even more brutal electronic outfit featuring a vast arsenal of analogue synthesizers. In 1981, they released half a split album \\"Reset\\", with the legendary Texan band Culturecide. They also released a live C60 cassette through Terse tapes. From October 1981, Bradbury teamed up with Tom Ellard's pioneering post punk / industrial band Severed Heads . This collaboration continued sporadically from 1981 to 1985. This resulted in several albums/eps on vinyl and cassette, most notably; Blubberknife (1982) https://severedheads.bandcamp.com/album/blubberknife, Since the Accident (1983-5) https://severedheads.bandcamp.com/album/since-the-accident, City Slab Horror (1985) https://severedheads.bandcamp.com/album/city-slab-horror , Goodbye Tonsils (1985) and a compilation/retrospective Clifford Darling, Please Don't live in the Past (1986) https://severedheads.bandcamp.com/album/clifford-darling-please-dont-live-in- the-past Bradbury also directed and designed, with assistance and collaborative input from numerous others, several of the early infamous Severed Heads' independently produced videos; Goodbye Tonsils , Canine https://vimeo.com/channels/severedheads/39524529 and Bigcar https://vimeo.com/channels/severedheads/39524529 . Generally speaking, Bradbury's work has always been typified by an extremely intense, often tortured, electronically generated sound; a sound that could be simultaneously beguilingly sweet and confrontingly intense. Though richly melodic his music is typified by crunchy, brutal rhythmic components and arrangements, found sound manipulation, utilizing both analogue tape and digital technologies. Eventually, he was to experiment with customized pianola scrolls. In 1988 he completed his first solo album, Drug Induced Sex Rituals. https://bradbury.bandcamp.com/album/drug-induced-sex-rituals Its release was planned, abandoned, delayed repeatedly, for several years, until it saw an eventual CDr release through Sevcom in the 1990s. During the 1997 a cd entitled Actual Size, the bulk of which consisted of Bradbury's solo material, was eventually issued first as a double CDr thru Sevcom and then as a single cd through Zonar Recordings. https://bradbury.bandcamp.com/album/actual-size Much of this material resurfaced on the later compilation PANSPERMIA. https://bradbury.bandcamp.com/album/panspermia-plus Throughpout the early 2000s Bradbury was commissioned by the Sydney Theatre Company on scores for King Lear, The Tempest and Macbeth.http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/05/21/1021882052290.html Around that time he co-ordinated and curated the Static Museum series of performance evenings at Artspace , Woolloomooloo, Sydney. In the 2000s he released two CDs Ruffini Corpuscle in 2003 https://bradbury.bandcamp.com/album/ruffini- corpuscle and Instant Oblivion in 2005 https://bradbury.bandcamp.com/album/instant-oblivion-or-beat-me-in-st-louis, on the Dual Plover label.

Life Boyd was born on in Paisley on 24 December 1795, the son of a glover. After receiving his early education partly in Paisley and partly in Glasgow, he attended the University of Glasgow where he gained honours in humanities, Greek, and philosophy classes. After completing his BA and MA degrees, he went on to study medicine for two years; however, he abandoned his medical studies to study divinity at the Divinity Hall of the university. He was licensed to preach the gospel by the presbytery of Dumbarton in May 1822. Towards the close of that year he moved to Edinburgh, where for three years he was a private tuition. In 1825 he was unanimously chosen house governor in George Heriot's Hospital, Edinburgh. The University of Glasgow awarded him the honorary degree, Doctor of law. Boyd became classical master in the High School of Edinburgh on 19 August 1829. The largely attended classes which he always had decisively proved the public estimate of his merits. In 1833 he is listed as living at 11 Castle Street, just off Princes Street. For many years before his death, he held the office of secretary to the Edinburgh Society of Teachers. He died at his house in George Square, Edinburgh, on 18 August 1856, having nearly completed an incumbency of 27 years in the High School. He was interred at New Calton Burial Ground on 21 August 1856. On 24 December 1829 he married Jane Reid, eldest daughter of John Easton, an Edinburgh merchant. Together they had nine children. Recognition and remembrance The affectionate respect which all his pupils entertained towards Boyd is evinced by the number of clubs formed in his honour by his classes. In the Crimea, during the Russian war, two ‘Boyd clubs’ were formed by British officers in acknowledgment of their common relation to him as their preceptor. Within two months after his death a medal, to be named the Boyd medal, and to be annually presented to the ‘dux’ of the class in the high school taught by Boyd's successor, was subscribed for at a meeting held in Edinburgh by his friends and pupils.  Works  Boyd's literary talents were confined to the editing of classical and other school books. They include: # Roman Antiquities by A. Adams, 1834, which was reprinted fifteen times during the editor's lifetime # Q. Horatii Flacci Poemata by C. Anthon, 1835, which passed through three editions # Archæologia Græca by J. Potter, Bishop of Oxford, 1837 # Sallustii Opera by C. Anthon, 1839 # Select Orations of Cicero by C. Anthon, 1842 # A Greek Reader by C.

It affected an estimated 1.6 million people. History The transfer (which took place in 194446) became part of a mass movement of people expelled from their homes in the process of ethnic consolidation throughout nations of Central and Eastern Europe. The new border between postwar Poland and the Soviet Union along the Curzon Line (requested by Premier Josef Stalin at the Yalta Conference with his western Allies) had been ratified. There was an ensuing population exchange that affected close to half a million ethnic Ukrainians as well as about 1.1 million Poles and Polish Jews. While the east-central territories of the Soviet republics remained unchanged, the westernmost regions of Ukrainian and Belarusian SSR underwent dramatic expansion at the expense of the Second Polish Republic. The so-called repatriation pertained to rural populations as much as the inhabitants of provincial capitals stripped of their prewar economic catchment areas (Grodno, Brest, Lviv, Przemyśl). About 480,000 people from Zakerzonia (west of the Curzon Line), were moved eastward to the territory which became part of Soviet Ukraine and Belarus. With the signing of the agreement in September 1944, people who were required to register for resettlement were identified only by ethnicity – not by the country of birth. Ukrainians residing west of the border were required to register with the Polish authorities, while the Poles living east of the border registered with the Soviet NKVD. To guarantee efficiency and prevent haulage of empty wagons, refugees were loaded onto the same returning trains on both sides of the new border. According to statistics, the Poles removed before spring 1945 from the villages in Ukraine amounted to 453,766 individuals (58% of the Polish total), while the city dwellers constituted 41.7% of the total, or 328,908 Poles. The number of Ukrainians registered between October 1944 and September 1946 was 492,682. Of this total, 482,880 individuals were eventually relocated to the Ukrainian SSR, settling primarily in the Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv Oblasts (provinces), in the southern and south-western oblasts of Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk, and to a lesser extent the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine. The largest resettlement of Ukrainians from Poland took place in the border counties of Hrubieszów, Przemyśl and Sanok followed secondarily by Lubaczów, Tomaszów, Lesko, Jarosław and Chełm. Logistics During the resettlement campaign, all eligible individuals were required to register with local Polish district commissions set up in the key cities of Jarosław, Gorlice, Krasnystaw, Chełm, Lublin, Biłgoraj, Jasło, Zamość and Nowy Sącz. The function of the commissions, which were staffed with both Polish communists and Soviet personnel, was not only to register, co-ordinate and facilitate the transportation of individuals, but also to conduct propaganda work among the target population. Because of the propaganda, which falsely promised Ukrainians better living conditions in Soviet Ukraine, there was some initial success. But the number of applications for resettlement tapered off by mid-1945, as word spread concerning the true conditions of the agreement, as well as the fact that the Ukrainians were not permitted to leave Soviet Ukraine. In August 1945, the campaign to resettle entered a new phase. In order to achieve the political objective of relocating the Ukrainian ethnic population from Poland, the Polish government abandoned the relatively benign character of the policy in favor of a more aggressive approach. There was significant resistance as most Ukrainians did not want to abandon their ancestral lands and resettle to Soviet Ukraine. In this regard, Polish and Soviet security forces were deployed (KBW, and MVD respectively) to force people to relocate. With time, the pretence of \\"voluntary resettlement\\" was dropped. Groups and entire villages were forced out of their homes and directed to embark on transports bound for the Soviet Union. Within the course of a single year, July 1945 - July 1946, some 400,000 Ukrainians and Rusyns were uprooted and deported in this manner. The resettlement operation concluded in September 1946. The campaign to resettle Ukrainians was in a large part intended to remove any base for the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which had conducted the massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia since 1943. UPA was somewhat successful in disrupting the 1944-1946 transfers. Difficulties in suppressing the UPA insurgency, however, prompted the Polish and Soviet communist governments to pursue Operation Vistula in 1947, which entailed the resettlement of the Ukrainians remaining in southeastern Poland into the Recovered Territories. Orest Subtelny, a Canadian historian of Ukrainian descent, concluded, \\"that the separation of the two people was a necessary precondition for the development of a mutually beneficial relationship between them. Apparently the old adage that 'good fences make for good neighbors' has been proven once more,\\" he wrote.

Brackenbury was born in Raithby by Spilsby, Lincolnshire,1861 England Census the second son of Richard Brackenbury of Aswardby, by his wife, Janetta, daughter of George Gunn of Edinburgh. He was a direct descendant from Sir Robert Brackenbury, lieutenant of the Tower of London in the time of Richard III. Having entered the army as an Ensign in the 61st Foot in 1803, and become a Lieutenant on 8 December in the same year. He served in Sicily, in Calabria, at Scylla Castle and at Gibraltar, 1807–8, and in the Peninsula from 1809 to the end of the war in 1814. At the battle of Salamanca he took a piece of artillery from the enemy, guarded by four soldiers, close to their retiring column, without any near or immediate support, and in many other important engagements conducted himself with distinguished valour. As a reward for his numerous services he received the war medal with nine clasps. On 22 July 1812, he was promoted to a Captaincy, and after the conclusion of the war was attached to the Portuguese and Spanish army from 25 October 1814 to 25 December 1816, when he was placed on half-pay.

Early years  Bardeen was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1871, but grew up in Syracuse, New York. His father, Charles William Bardeen, was an educator and publisher. He attended the Teichmann School in Leipzig, Germany, and then completed his B.A. at Harvard University in 1893. By virtue of being in the first medical school class at Johns Hopkins University, and having a last name at the beginning of the alphabet, Bardeen was the first person ever to receive an M.D. from that institution, in 1897. First graduating class of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 1897. Bardeen is in the back row, third from left. Dr. William H. Welch, the first dean of the medical school, is in the middle of the group.  Career  Bardeen taught at Johns Hopkins University from 1897 to 1904. He then left Johns Hopkins and accepted the post of professor of anatomy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Bardeen came to Wisconsin at a time when the university was expanding under President Charles R. Van Hise. Van Hise and Bardeen shared the view that the one element the university was missing was a medical school. Bardeen was asked to create a two-year program fully integrated into the university. In 1907, he became the first dean of the University of Wisconsin Medical School. Bardeen wanted the new medical school to evolve into a four- year program. However, he had to battle local physicians, who believed that such an institution would rob them of their livelihood. Later, the First World War and the 1918 influenza epidemic convinced them, and the public, that more physicians were needed in Wisconsin. Finally, in 1924, Wisconsin General Hospital opened its doors, and a year later the Medical School invited students to participate in a four-year curriculum. However, the medical school had difficulty meeting the clinical needs of the extended curriculum. Bardeen had a solution. He wanted a co-opting of state physicians into the medical school's educational activities. Beginning in 1926, fourth-year medical students would spend eight weeks working in one of the many private practices scattered across the state of Wisconsin. The preceptorship rapidly grew into one of the most popular aspects of medical education at the university. Later, the preceptor concept introduced by Bardeen became an important national innovation. Bardeen contributed articles on embryology, morphology, anatomy, and other subjects to scientific journals.  Personal life  Bardeen was married to Althea Bardeen (née Harmer). She had taught at the Dewey Laboratory School and managed an interior decorating business before marrying, and was an active figure in the art world. After her death from cancer in 1921, Charles married Ruth Hames. His son, Dr. John Bardeen, became the only person to win the Nobel Prize in Physics twice, in 1956 and 1972. Bardeen died in Madison, Wisconsin in 1935, from pancreatic cancer. He was succeeded as Dean of the University of Wisconsin Medical School by Dr. William Shainline Middleton.

Little is known of Fabrizi's life, perhaps because of his many journeys to various parts of Italy and Europe. He was born in Naples in 1764 and studied under the guidance of Giacomo Tritto. The Neapolitan Carnival of 1783 saw his first premiere: the intermezzo I tre gobbi rivali. In 1786 he was appointed maestro di cappella at the University of Rome and later, in the same city, became director of the Teatro Capranica. Some three years later Fabrizi began to travel further afield to put on his works, spending time in Dresden, Lisbon, London and Madrid. Of his works about fifteen opera buffe are known, largely composed during the years 1783–1788. Like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Giuseppe Gazzaniga and Francesco Gardi he composed a version of Don Giovanni. It premiered in Rome in 1787 under the title Il convitato di pietra.

Whilst still under age he published in 1825 Waterloo, or the British Minstrel, a poem. He was bred to the art of surgery, and on 26 April 1826 left England in the schooner Unicorn in Lord Cochrane's expedition to Greece, during which he was present in several engagements by land and sea. After his return he published The Athenaid, or Modern Grecians, a poem, 1830; Tales of the Cyclades, poems, 1830; and in 1839 edited a work entitled A Russian's Reply to the Marquis de Custine's “Russia.” On 1 September 1832 he received from the King of the Belgians a commission as sous- lieutenant in the Bataillon Etranger of Belgium, and was appointed to the 1st regiment of lancers. At one time he held a commission in the Royal West Middlesex Militia. He was appointed on 31 December 1835 stipendiary magistrate in Tobago, from which he was removed to Trinidad on 13 May 1836. He was reappointed to the southern or Cedros district on 13 April 1839, but soon returned to England, having been superseded in consequence of a quarrel with some other colonial officer. In 1841 he again went to the West Indies in the capacity of private secretary to Colonel Macdonald, lieutenant-governor of Dominica, and in 1842 he acted for some time as colonial secretary in Barbados. The charges which had occasioned his previous return were, however, renewed, and the government cancelled his appointment. From that period he lived very precariously. He turned his moderate literary talents to account, and among some communications he made to the Gentleman's Magazine were articles on \\"The Last of the Paleologi\\" in January 1843, and a \\"Memoir of Major-general Thomas Dundas and the Expedition to Gaudaloupe\\" in August, September, and October in the same year.

Coat of arms of the Bishopric  Catholic diocese  Situation of the Bishopric (abbrev. P.) within the Prussian Deutschordensland of 1410 It was founded as one of four Roman Catholic dioceses in Prussia in 1243 by the papal legate William of Modena. The bishops, whose seat was Riesenburg (Prabuty), ruled one third of diocesan territory as his temporality. The diocesan cathedral chapter met in the fortified cathedral of Marienwerder (Kwidzyn). In the 1280s the Teutonic Order succeeded to impose the simultaneous membership of all capitular canons in the Order thus winning influence in the diocese and in the capitular elections of the bishops. So the temporality of Pomesania's bishop did not develop the status of a prince-bishopric and was ruled as part of Teutonic Prussia. Beginning in 1523 during the Protestant Reformation, the diocese was effectively administered by Lutheran bishops until 1587, when the diocese was secularized by the regent of Ducal Prussia, George Frederick. However the Catholic diocese was only formally suppressed in 1763, having remained vacant since 1524 except for 'temporary' Apostolic administrators since 1601.

Each disc has a raised edge. Notebook sheets have perforations along the binding edge that match the profile and spacing of the binding discs. Notebook sheets are removed by peeling the perforations away from the binding discs. Sheets are added by affixing the perforations to the discs. Sheets can be transferred between disc-bound notebooks of different functions and sizes, provided the discs have the same profile and spacing. In addition to using paper specifically manufactured for a particular disc-binding system, ordinary paper can be inserted by using a specially designed hole punch to perforate the pages to conform to the discs. Several companies have manufactured or distributed disc-binding systems. These include the Belgian firm Atoma, the now-defunct Israeli brand Flic, Levenger Company (under the brand name Circa) in the US, Clairefontaine (under the brand 'Clairing') in France, Rollabind in the US, Office Depot (TUL), Staples (Arc), and William Hannah in the UK. Invention and patents Andre Tomas and Andre Martin (from whom the Atoma brand name was derived) invented and patented the first disc-binding system. In 1948, they sold their patent to Georges Mottart, who founded Papeteries G. Mottart n.v., the exclusive producer of disc-binding systems in Europe until the mid-1990s, when the patent expired. Atoma sells 1–1.5 million disc-bound notebooks yearly.This information is the transcript of a radio interview with Pierre-Michel Van Canneyt, grandson of Georges Mottart, first broadcast on national Belgian radio (VRT, Radio 1). The audio (in Flemish) is available at http://www.radio1.be/programmas/och1/735511 . In June 1995, Jack and Shirley Feldman filed a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office claiming improvements they made to the Flic disk-binding notebook system. The Feldmans had an agreement with Israeli company Mapal, owner of the Flic brand but lost their distribution rights sometime in late 1995, early 1996. In April 1996, Mitch Greenberg met Jack Feldman and along with Ed Finkelstein, founded Rollabind, Inc. The new company, led by Greenberg, proceeded to build its brand and infrastructure to supply product to the expanding marketplace growing from a few thousand dollars in sales to over $8 million in sales by 2001. The patent office issued United States patents to the Feldmans numbered 5,553,959 (1996) and 5,749,667 (1998). For a time, Levenger Company bought notebooks and supplies for the disk-binding system from Rollabind, Inc which at the time was controlled by Mitch Greenberg and Ed Finkelstein with Feldman being a 1/3 partner. Levenger sold the notebooks and supplies under its own Circa brand name. In 2002, Greenberg and Finkelstein sold their interest in the company to a group led by Michael Olsher with Feldman still involved and formed a new company, Rollabind, LLC. After about 2 years, the Olsher group sold out to another individual who invested an undisclosed sum but was out in just over 1 year after losing their investment. In 2004, the Feldmans licensed Levenger under their patents to manufacture the notebooks and supplies. In early 2006, Levenger learned that Staples and Target marketed notebooks similar to Levenger's Circa line. In November 2006, Levenger filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida that sought a declaratory judgment that the Feldmans' patents were invalid and for various other relief and stopped paying royalties under the patent license. The defendants filed a counterclaim alleging that Levenger infringed the patents and misappropriated trade secrets. After a trial, in September 2007 the court declared the patents invalid and unenforceable, denied most of the other relief that Levenger sought (including refund of royalties Levenger paid under the patent license and reimbursement of its legal fees), and denied defendants' counterclaim.All facts stated about this case are taken from the court's opinion.

During this time upstanding university members like Carl Linnaeus, Olof Celsius and Jonas Alströmer donated collections of material to the museum. In the 20th century, notable paleontologists Otto Zdansky and professor Carl Wiman contributed to the growth of the collections. Several expeditions to China yielded many unique vertebrate fossils. From 1917 and onwards the zoological collections of the museum were stored and displayed in a building designed by the architects Ture Stenberg and Victor Holmgren. Before the 1930s, the paleontological collections of the museum were disorganized and spread out in a number of buildings across the city.

The paleontological section of the museum holds many mesozoic fossils of marine reptiles, such as the ichthyosaur Ophthalmosaurus and the mosasaur Platecarpus. There are several original fossils of pterosaurs and dinosaurs. These include a unique specimen of the chinese sauropod Euhelopus zdanskyi and a cast of the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx lithographica, as well as the ceratopsid dinosaur Pentaceratops sternbergi and a skull of the hadrosaurid Parasaurolophus tubicen, the two latter genera both named by Wiman. The section contains a large collection of fossil mammalian specimens, as well as mounted skeletons of contemporary cetaceans and the fossilised mandible of an Eocene mysticete. There are also numerous fossils of invertebrates, such as trilobites, cephalopods, bivalve molluscs and corals.

While sound reinforcement systems are usually used to increase the sound level of the sound source (like a person speaking into a microphone, or musical instruments in a pop ensemble), acoustic enhancement systems are typically used to increase the acoustic energy in the venue in a manner that is not noticed by the audience. The correctly installed systems replicate the desired acoustics of early reflections and reverberation from a room that is properly designed for Acoustic Music. An additional benefit of these systems is that the room acoustics can be changed or adjusted to be matched to the type of performance. The use of Acoustic Enhancement as Electronic Architecture offers a good solution for multi-use performance halls that need to be \\"dead\\" for amplified music , and are used occasionally for acoustic performances. These systems are often associated with acoustic sound sources like a chamber orchestra, symphony orchestra, or opera, but have also found acceptance in a variety of applications and venues that include rehearsal rooms, recording facilities conference rooms, sound stages, sports arenas, and outdoor venues. Design and application Acoustic enhancement systems use microphones, amplifiers, and loudspeakers interconnected with some form of processing. The number, type, and placement of microphones and loudspeakers varies according to both the application, as well as the physics limitations that are imposed by the inherent operating principles associated with each manufacturer's equipment. In most instances, however, these systems employ at least one array of loudspeakers that are distributed throughout the venue. As concertgoers have become aware of the use of these systems, debates have arisen, because \\"...purists maintain that the natural acoustic sound of [Classical] voices [or] instruments in a given hall should not be altered.\\"Sound Systems- Why?! When employed properly, however, acoustic enhancement can improve listening quality in ways that would be impossible for architectural treatments to accomplish, and deliver sound quality that the concertgoer desires to experience. At the Vienna Festival in May, 1995, a LARES system was used outdoors to augment the Vienna Philharmonic's performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 conducted by Zubin Mehta. \\"This was the first time on this location with classical music that we were not criticised for spoiling the music by amplifying it. \\"Alfred Toegel, Sound Department, Vienna Festival. Commenting on a performance by the Grant Park Orchestra at the Jay Pritzker Pavilion at Millennium Park Chicago IL, Senior V.P. of WFMT Radio Steve Robinson stated \\"I have never in my life heard sound projected so faithfully and beautifully over such a great distance; it was an ethereal experience\\" Kai Harada's article Opera's Dirty Little SecretEntertainment Design, Mar 1, 2001 states that opera houses have begun using electronic acoustic enhancement systems \\"...to compensate for flaws in a venue's acoustical architecture.\\" Despite the uproar that has arisen amongst operagoers, Harada points out that none of the major opera houses using acoustic enhancement systems \\"...use traditional, Broadway-style sound reinforcement, in which most if not all singers are equipped with radio microphones mixed to a series of unsightly loudspeakers scattered throughout the theatre.\\" Instead, most opera houses use the sound reinforcement system for subtle boosting of offstage voices, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in Tosca or thunder in Wagnerian operas). Acoustic Enhancement systems are most often employed in traditional opera houses to improve the sound of the orchestra, and have little if any effect on the sound of the voices. In a review of the State Opera of South Australia's performance of Wagners' Ring cycle at the Adelaide Festival Center Theatre, Michael Kennedy of The Sunday Telegraph, London, wrote: “The balance between the orchestra and the voices has been ideal.” The live recording of \\"Wagner: Die Walküre\\", the world's first 6 channel SACD \\"blitzed the 2005 Helpmann Awards, winning ten of its eleven nominations and earning critical accolades.\\" - and the recording of \\"Wagner: Götterdämmerung\\" was nominated for a 2008 Grammy award. \\" Types There exist different types of acoustic enhancement systems: In-line and feedback systems with or without electronic reverberators. In-line systems are also called non-regenerative (i.e. no feedback). Feedback systems are also called regenerative. Electronic reverberators can be added in addition using various methods such as convolution and FIR filtering. In-line systems with electronic reverberators: In-line acoustic enhancement systems include E-coustic LARES (Lexicon Acoustic Reinforcement and Enhancement System), SIAP, the System for Improved Acoustic Performance and ACS, Acoustic Control Systems. These systems use microphones, digital signal processing \\"with delay, phase, and frequency-response changes,\\" and then send the signal \\"... to a large number of loudspeakers placed in extremities of the performance venue.\\" The Deutsche Staatsoper in Berlin and the Hummingbird Centre in Toronto use a LARES system. The Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, the Royal National Theatre in London, and the Vivian Beaumont Theater in New York City use the SIAP system. http://www.acs.eu Feedback systems with electronic reverberators: Feedback acoustic enhancement systems include Meyer Constellation (formerly VRAS) (Variable Room Acoustics System) which uses \\"...different algorithms based on microphones placed around the room.\\" Yamaha's AFC3 Active Field Control system which \\"enhances the architectural acoustic characteristics of a room and optimizes reverberation time performance.\\" Also XLNT's MCR system (Multiple Channel Reverberation).

Brady was born at Deptford on 10 November 1811, being the eldest son of Anthony Brady of the Deptford victualling yard, then storekeeper at the Royal William victualling yard, Plymouth, by his marriage, on 20 December 1810, with Marianne, daughter of Francis Perigal and Mary Ogier. He was educated at Colfe's School, Lewisham, and then entered the civil service as a junior clerk in the Victoria victualling yard, Deptford, on 29 November 1828, and, having served there and at Plymouth and Portsmouth, was, through the recommendation of Sir James Graham, promoted to headquarters at Somerset House as a second-class clerk in the accountant-general's office on 26 June 1844. He was gradually promoted until in 1864 he became registrar of contracts, and having subsequently assisted very materially in reorganising the office, he was made the first superintendent of the admiralty new contract department on 13 April 1869, when an improved salary of £1,000 a year was allotted to him. He held this appointment until 31 March 1870, when he retired on a special pension. He was knighted by The Queen at Windsor on 23 June 1870. After his retirement Sir Antonio devoted himself to social, educational, and religious reform. Having taken a great interest in the preservation of Epping Forest for the people, he was appointed a judge in the Verderer's court for the forest of Epping. He was associated with church work of all kinds. He published in 1869 The Church's Works and its Hindrances, with suggestions for Church Reform. The establishment of the Plaistow and Victoria Dock Mission, the East London Museum at Bethnal Green, and the West Ham and Stratford Dispensary was in a great measure due to him. Brady was a member of the Ray, the Palæontographical, and Geological Societies. So long ago as 1844 his attention had been attracted to the wonderful deposits of brickearth which occupy the valley of the Roding at Ilford, within a mile of his residence. Encouraged by Professor Owen he commenced collecting the rich series of mammalian remains in the brickearths of the Thames valley, comprising amongst others the skeletons of the tiger, wolf, bear, elephant, rhinoceros, horse, elk, stag, bison, ox, hippopotamus, &c.; This valuable collection of pleistocene mammalia is now in the Natural History Museum. Most notable in the collection is the \\"Ilford mammoth skull\\" which is the most complete mammoth skull ever found in Britain. The skull is on display in the Hintze Hall of the Natural History Museum. A resin cast of the skull is on display in Redbridge Central Library in Ilford. In his Catalogue of Pleistocene Mammalia from Ilford, Essex, 1874, printed for private circulation only, Brady acknowledges his indebtedness to Mr. William Davies, F.G.S., his instructor in the art of preserving fossil bones. He died suddenly at his residence, Maryland Point, Forest Lane, Stratford, on 12 December 1881. He was buried in the churchyard of St John's, Stratford, on 16 December. His marriage with Maria, eldest daughter of George Kilner of Ipswich, took place on 18 May 1837, and by her, who survived him, he left a son, the Rev. Nicholas Brady, rector of Wennington, Essex, and two daughters.

He also co-designed the first locomotive to cover a mile in less than a minute. Early life Braithwaite was third son of John Braithwhaite the elder. He was born at 1 Bath Place, New Road, London, on 19 March 1797, and, after being educated at Mr. Lord's school at Tooting in Surrey, attended in his father's manufactory, where he made himself master of practical engineering, and became a skilled draughtsman. In June 1818 his father died, leaving the business to his sons Francis and John. Francis died in 1823, and John Braithwaite carried on the business alone. He added to the business the making of high-pressure steam- engines. In 1817 he reported before the House of Commons upon the Norwich steamboat explosion, and in 1820 he ventilated the House of Lords by means of air-pumps. In 1822 he made the donkey engine, and in 1823 cast the statue of the Duke of Kent by sculptor Sebastian Gahagan that was erected in Portland Place, London. Novelty, with a descendant of Braithwaite aboard William IV He was introduced to George and Robert Stephenson in 1827, and about the same time became acquainted with Captain John Ericsson, who then had many schemes in view. In 1829 Braithwaite and Ericsson constructed for the Rainhill experiments the locomotive engine, The Novelty. This engine was the first that ever ran a mile within a minute (fifty-six seconds). Fire-engines 1906 horse-drawn steam fire engine in England. The water is pumped onto the fire by a double-acting onboard steam engine. At this time Braithwaite manufactured the first practical steam fire-engine, which was ultimately destroyed by a London mob. It had, however, previously done good service at the burning of the English Opera House in 1830, at the destruction of the Argyle Rooms 1830, and at the conflagration of the Houses of Parliament in 1834. It threw two tons of water per minute, burnt coke, and got up steam in about twenty minutes; but it was looked upon with so much jealousy by the fire brigade of the day that the inventor had to give it up. He, however, soon constructed four others of larger dimensions, two of which, in Berlin and Liverpool respectively, gave great satisfaction. In 1833 he built the caloric engine in conjunction with Captain Ericsson. Civil engineer In 1834, Braithwaite stopped playing an active role in the management of the engine works at New Road, and began to practise as a civil engineer for public works. He largely consulted on projects , both at home and abroad, particularly related to the capabilities of, and improvements to, locomotives. 1834 also saw Braithwaite plan and lay out the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) in conjunction with Charles Blacker Vignoles. The railway was formally incorporated in 1836, and Braithwaite was soon after appointed engineer-in-chief of its construction. At Braithwaite's recommendation, the ECR's gauge was set at , and the line was constructed as far as Colchester to this gauge. The trackbed, however, being made wide enough for the track to be widened to gauge. On the recommendation of Robert Stephenson the railways was re-gauged to the emerging \\"standard gauge\\" of ; in later years Braithwaite was an advocate of still narrower gauges. Whilst engineer to the ECR he introduced an American excavating machine and an American steam pile-driving machine. He left the ECR on 28 May 1843. Braithwaite was joint founder of the Railway Times, which he started with Joseph Clinton Robertson as editor in 1837, and he continued sole proprietor till 1845. He undertook the preparation of plans for the direct Exeter railway, but the railway mania of the period, and his connection with some commercial speculations, necessitated the winding up of his affairs in 1845. Consulting engineer Braithwaite had, in 1844, a share in a patent for extracting oil from bituminous shale, and works were erected near Weymouth which, but for his difficulties, might have been successful. Some years before, 1836–8, Captain Ericsson and he had fitted up an ordinary canal boat with a screw propeller, which started from London along the canals to Manchester on 28 June 1838, returning by the way of Oxford and the Thames to London, being the first and last steamboat that has navigated the whole distance on those waters. The experiment was abandoned on account of the deficiency of water in the canals and the completion of the railway system, which diverted the paying traffic. In 1844, and again in 1846, he was much on the continent surveying lines of railway in France, and on his return he was employed to survey Langstone Harbour in 1850, and to build the Brentford brewery in 1851. From that year he was principally engaged in chamber practice, and acted as consulting engineer, advising on most of the important mechanical questions of the day for patents and other purposes. Honours Braithwaite was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1819, a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 13 February 1838, and at the time of his death he was one of the oldest members of the Society of Arts, having been elected into that body in the year 1819; he was also a life governor of seventeen charitable institutions. Family John Braithwaite married Caroline or possibly Caroline Amelia (1803 - 1878) and together they had at least 10 children (6 sons and 4 daughters): Eliza Emma (b. 1824); John (b. 1825); George (b.1826); Clara Ellen Sophia (b. 1828) Frank (b. 1829); Harriet Frances (b. 1831); Richard Charles (b. 1832); Frederick John (b. 1835); Caroline Anne (b. 1836) and Edward Henry (b. 1838). John died suddenly at 8 Clifton Gardens, Paddington, on 25 September 1870, and his remains were interred in Kensal Green cemetery. His wife died in 1878.

It is a carving of a bird made in sepentine stone. Some Māori of Tainui allegiance believe that it was brought to the country from Hawaiki in their ancestral waka. History The statue was discovered among the roots of a manuka tree blown over in a storm in 1878. The location was near Aotea Harbour, traditional landing place of the Tainui waka (c.1350). This was the story of its finding given at the time by Mr Albert Walker, who claimed it was found by a local Māori, although there are other versions. He offered it for sale to a local Cambridge antique and ethnographic dealer, Major Drummond-Hay. It was then purchased by Major John Wilson, as a present to his Māori wife, Te Aorere, for 50 pounds. It is claimed that the carving was referred to in a number of poems or laments about its loss, and that several chiefs were extremely moved by its rediscovery. The Maori Tainui tribe claim it came from the 'Homeland' on a migration canoe, but it is carved with metal tools which the Polynesians did not have. It has no similarity to any other manufactured piece in Oceania. Its origin is a mystery. The Wilson family later deposited the carving with Dominion Museum. By 1995 it was kept at its successor, Te Papa, from where it was returned to Tainui by Prime Minister Jim Bolger as part of the government's settlement of their claims under the treaty of Waitangi. The Wilson family apparently disputes the government's authority to done so.cf. The Korotangi, by Christine McKay, Dominion Museum monograph, New Zealand, 1978.

Physical description The stone is a non- specific serpentine, weighs 2097 grams, is 26 cm long and appears to be carved with metal tools. It depicts a bird which seems to be a fusion of a petrel (possibly a Broad-billed Prion), a duck, and a dove or pigeon.

On 7 November 2013, he became the emir of the Tehrik- i-Taliban, and presided over the descent of the group into factions who are often at war with each other. Fazlullah was added to the U.S. State Department's Rewards for Justice wanted list on 7 March 2018. Fazlullah was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Afghanistan on 14 June 2018. Personal life Fazlullah was born Fazal Hayat in 1974 to Biladar Khan, a Pashtun of Babukarkhel clan of the Yusufzai tribe of the Swat District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.Roggio, Bill (7 July 2007) \\"Swat joins Talibanistan\\" The Long War Journal Public Multimedia Inc. He married the daughter of Sufi Muhammad, the founder of Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi. It is rumoured that Fazullah kidnapped Sufi Muhammmad's daughter as a student in Sufi Muhammad Madrassa. MSNBC, a news channel in the United States, obtained a photo of Fazlullah in January 2008. Militant activity =Operations in Pakistan= TNSM in Swat On 12 January 2002, Fazlullah became the leader of Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM) due to the enforcement of a ban by Pervez Musharraf, former President of Pakistan. The ban led to the arrest and capture of Sufi Muhammad, which placed Fazlullah into the leadership role. Sufi Muhammad was freed in 2008 after he renounced violence. Fazlullah managed to restore the organization, bootstrapping on the relief efforts by Islamist extremist groups following the 8 October 2005-earthquake. New cadres then began moving into the Swat Valley. Alliance with Tehrik-e- Taliban In the aftermath of the 2007 siege of Lal Masjid, Fazlullah's forces and Baitullah Mehsud's Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) formed an alliance. Fazlullah and his army henceforth reportedly received orders from Mehsud. A temporary cease-fire from May to September 2007 allowed Fazlullah to consolidate his political forces in Swat. Parallel government With the support of more than 4,500 militants, by late October 2007 Fazlullah had established a \\"parallel government\\" in 59 villages in Swat Valley by starting Islamic courts to enforce sharia law. Reports of wounding On 10 July 2009, BBC reported that Fazlullah was near death after being critically wounded, corroborating statements made by senior government and security officials in Pakistan. This was a day after the army announced it had wounded the Taliban chief in the Swat valley. The Taliban have denied that Fazlullah was critically injured. The Pakistan army, however, refuted this claim and insisted that a man impersonated Fazlullah when he allegedly denied that he was critically injured. =Madrassa= Fazlullah's madrasa at Imam Dherai, Swat. Pakistani security forces bombed and destroyed the compound in early June 2009.Security forces blow up Fazlullah's HQ: officials Fazlullah developed a $US2.5 million madrassa with assistance from the Taliban which was used as his base of operations. It was funded by the JEI faction led by Maulana Sami-ul-haq. = Operations from Afghanistan = On 29 November 2007, Pakistani security forces captured Fazlullah's headquarters and arrested his brother. Fazlullah himself had already fled to another village. Security Forces have now retaken most of the Swat region. In 2007, Fazullah was allegedly hiding in the Konar province in Afghanistan. On 26 January 2008, it was reported that Maulvi Abdul Raziq, a close aide of Fazlullah, was arrested in the Kot area of Charbagh. In November 2009, Fazlullah told the BBC's Urdu Service that he had escaped from Pakistan to Afghanistan and warned that he would continue to attack Pakistani forces in Swat. In October 2011, Maj Gen Athar Abbas complained to Reuters that Pakistan had urged Afghanistan and the US to take action against Fazlullah in response to cross-border raids in Dir, Bajaur and Mohmand from April 2011 to August 2011 but that no efforts had been made. Abbas elaborated, \\"Fazlullah and his group are trying to re-enter Swat through Dir.\\" In June 2012, a TTP spokesman claimed that Fazlullah was leading attacks on Pakistan from Afghanistan's border provinces. Reuters indicated that he controlled a 20-km stretch of area in Nuristan province along the Pakistani border. On 3 December 2013, it was revealed to the media by TTP spokesperson that Fazullah has crossed the Pak-Afghan border into Pakistan's tribal areas, he was expected to end the squabbling among the Taliban leadership relating to his appointment as new TTP Chief. =Tehrik-e-Taliban leadership= After the death of Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone attack, Fazlullah was appointed as the new \\"Emir\\" (Chief) of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan on 7 November 2013. According to Ehsanullah Ehsan, the former spokesperson for TTP, Mullah Fazlullah became the leader via lucky draw. =Army Public School attack in Peshawar= On 16 December 2014, six militants reportedly dressed as Pakistani Army soldiers entered the school through the graveyard situated on the backside of school and killed around 141 people including 132 students and the principal. In reaction to this massacre, Pakistan intensified its ongoing operation Zarb-e-Azab against the militants. Some Pakistani officials claim that Fazlullah masterminded the attack and subsequently hid on the Afghan side of the Durand Line. He narrowly escaped a U.S. drone strike on 25 November 2014. Interpretation of Sharia =Radio broadcasts= Fazlullah started an illegal local FM channel in Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa's Swat Valley in 2006. He preached forcing vice and virtue and had an anti-Western Jihadi stance. He was considered pro-Taliban and was a very powerful figure in the area. He considered most communication-based electronics as \\"major sources of spreading Jihad\\" and transmitted broadcasts of his sermons on an illegal local FM radio channel, hence the nickname \\"Radio Mullah\\" or \\"Maulana Radio\\". FM signals were relayed from mobile transmitters mounted on motorcycles and trucks. During nightly broadcasts, prohibited activities were routinely declared and violators' names announced for assassination, which often included beheading. =Introduction of Sharia courts= With Swat under Fazlullah's control he and his followers quickly moved to set up the Sharia Courts as primary judicial courts instead of when he was running them parallel to the Pakistani National Judicial Courts. =Eradication of sins and the attacks on music shops= He led a drive of eradicating vices such as music, dancing, and of what he calls \\"major sources of sin\\" such as TVs, CDs, computers and other video equipment by burning the electronics or the shops in which they are housed. Fazlullah threatened barbers who shaved their customers' beards and warned against girls attending schools. =Anti-polio vaccination stance= He opposed a polio vaccination drive in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa claiming that aid workers were seeking to proselytise in the region, as well as spy for foreign forces. In some sermons he had also considered it against Islamic norms. He considered Hepatitis C as a more important health issue than polio and questioned the West's intentions. The propaganda had hindered the drive immensely as the local people saw volunteers and workers for the World Health Organization vaccination program as a threat and in some cases the immunization teams were physically beaten. =Opposition to women voting= In 2001, many seats reserved for women in northern Pakistan went unfilled due in large part to the actions of the TNSM.Hussain, Zahid (29 July 2005) \\"Frontier women to defy Islamists' men-only ballot\\" The Times In 2005, Fazlullah was quoted as saying: We have our tradition that bans women from taking part in the elections and violators will be punished. =Opposition to female education= A 21 January 2009 issue of the Pakistan daily newspaper The News, reported Taliban enforcement of a complete ban on female education in the Swat District. Some 400 private schools enrolling 40,000 girls were shut down. At least 10 girls' schools that tried to open after the 15 January 2009 deadline by the Fazlullah-led Taliban were blown up by the militants in the town of Mingora, the headquarters of the Swat District.The News, Pakistan, 21 January 2009. \\"More than 170 schools have been bombed or torched, along with other government-owned buildings.\\" On 9 October 2012, an assassin instructed by Fazlullah shot Malala Yousafzai. Although the attack was meant to kill Malala Yousafzai it made her a very respected and prominent leader. Death On 23 March 2015, Pakistani military forces and the Pakistani media reported that Fazlullah was killed on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. This claim was denied by the Tehrik- i-Taliban. On 14 June 2018, Fazlullah was killed in an American drone strike in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. The TTP confirmed his death and announced Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud alias Abu Mansoor Asim as their new leader.

Initially Culm was a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Riga and had its seat in Chełmża (Culmsee). * From 1257 to 1773 its seat was the castle in Lubawa. * Since 1466 Chełmno diocese was part of Polish Royal Prussia. * After 1525 Chełmno incorporated southern parts of the Pomesanian diocesan area (with Łasin and Nowe Miasto), which happened to be in the Chełmno Voivodeship. Whereas western Pomesanian diocesan area in the Malbork Voivodeship was administered by Chełmno, but officially maintaining its naming. * After Riga's dissolution in 1566 the bishops of Chełmno attended the councils of the Ecclesiastical province of the metropolitan of Gniezno. This practice was recognised by the Holy See by the Bull De salute animarum in 1821, when Chełmno became de jure a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Gniezno. Chełmno diocese was enlarged on that occasion (Górzno, Krajna and Działdowo). * Since 1772 Culm diocese was part of the Kingdom of Prussia and became a part of Germany in 1871. In 1824 the see had moved to Pelplin. * In 1920 Chełmno became part of the Second Polish Republic. * On 1 May 1923 the Holy See disentangled the deaneries in Bütow (Bytów) and Lauenburg in Pomerania (Lębork) from Chełmno and transferred them to the new Apostolic Administration of Tütz.Cf. . * As part of the reorganisation of the Catholic Church in the Third Polish Republic Chełmno was disbanded in 1992 by Pope John Paul II and replaced by the Diocese of Pelplin.

Brandt was eldest son of the Rev. Francis Brandt, rector of Aldford, Cheshire, 1843–50, who died in 1870, and Ellinor, second daughter of Nicholas Grimshaw of Preston, Lancashire. He was educated at Macclesfield grammar school, entered at the Inner Temple in 1839, and practised for some years as a special pleader. Called to the bar at the Inner Temple on 30 April 1847, he took the North Wales and Chester circuit. He was a successful and popular leader of the Chester and Knutsford sessions, had a fair business in London, especially as an arbitrator or referee, was one of the revising barristers on his circuit, and was employed for many years as a reporter for the Times in the common pleas. About 1864 he was offered and declined an Indian judgeship. In his earlier days he was a writer in magazines and in Bell's Life. The first of his books appeared in 1857, and was entitled Habet! a Short Treatise on the Law of the Land as it affects Pugilism, in which he attempted to show that prize- fighting was not of itself illegal. His next work was a novel called Frank Morland's Manuscripts, or Memoirs of a Modern Templar, 1859, which was followed by Fur and Feathers, the Law of the Land relating to Game, &c.;, 1859, Suggestions for the Amendment of the Game Laws, 1862, and Games, Gaming, and Gamesters' Law, 1871, a book of considerable legal and antiquarian research, which reached a second edition. He died at his chambers, having suffered much from a neuralgic complaint, and was buried at Christ Church, Todmorden. He was a zealous and efficient member of the Inns of Court Rifle Corps.

In most instances, radio jamming targets foreign broadcasters, including Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Asia, the BBC World Service, the NHK World (Radio Japan) and stations based in Taiwan. Methods Radio jamming is achieved by transmitting radio signals on the same frequency as the intended target. The government of the People's Republic of China disrupts shortwave radio communications through this method, typically by broadcasting music, drumming, or other noise.Doug Mellgren, 'Tibet exile radio says China jamming it', Associated Press, 2 April 2008. On shortwave, the jamming sound is composed of Chinese folk music, specifically a composition known as The Firedrake, running about one hour in duration. The one hour audio clip is broadcast at high power on the same frequencies used by target stations. It is being streamed through the \\"Sat 6B\\" satellite that was launched in 2007.

Background and education Brewster was born at Ballinulta, the son of William Bagenal Brewster, of Ballinulta, County Wicklow, by his wife Mary, daughter of Thomas Bates. He received his earlier education at Kilkenny College, then proceeding to the University of Dublin in 1812, took his B.A. degree in 1817, and long after, in 1847, his M.A. degree. Legal and judicial career Brewster was called to the Irish bar in 1819, and, having chosen Leinster for his circuit, soon acquired the reputation of a sound lawyer and a powerful speaker. Lord Plunket honoured him with a silk gown on 13 July 1835. Notwithstanding the opposition of Daniel O'Connell, who disliked him, he was appointed Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on 10 October 1841, and was Solicitor-General for Ireland from 2 February 1846 until 16 July. By the influence of his friend Sir James Graham, First Lord of the Admiralty, he was Attorney-General for Ireland from 10 January 1853 until the fall of the Aberdeen ministry on 10 February 1855. Brewster was very active in almost all branches of his profession after his resignation, and his reputation as an advocate may be gathered from the pages of the Irish Law and Equity Reports, and in the later series of the Irish Common Law Reports, the Irish Chancery Reports, and the Irish Jurist, in all of which his name very frequently appears. Among the most important cases in which he took part were the Mountgarrett case in 1854, involving a peerage and an estate of £10,000 a year; the Carden abduction case in July of the same year; the Yelverton case, 1861; the Egmont will case, 1863; the Marquess of Donegall's ejectment action; and lastly, the great will cause of Fitzgerald v. Fitzgerald, in which Brewster's statement for the plaintiff is said to have been one of his most successful efforts. On Lord Derby becoming prime minister, Brewster succeeded Francis Blackburne as Lord Justice of Appeal in Ireland in July 1866, and Lord Chancellor of Ireland in the month of March following. As Lord Chancellor he sat in his court for the last time on 17 December 1868, when Benjamin Disraeli's government resigned. He then retired from public life. There are in print only three or four judgments delivered by him, either in the Court of Appeal or the Court of Chancery (Ireland). As far back as January 1853 he had been made a Privy Counsellor in Ireland. His judicial manner was quiet, but with what was called \\"a touch of serviceable fierceness\\" which kept order in Court. He was highly regarded by his colleagues; even the bitter-tongued Jonathan Christian, who despised most of his fellow judges, deferred to Brewster. Family Brewster died at his residence, 26 Merrion Square South, Dublin, on 26 July 1874, and was buried at Tullow, County Carlow, on 30 July. By his marriage in 1819 with Mary Ann, daughter of Robert Gray of Upton House, County Carlow, who died in Dublin on 24 November 1862, he had issue one son, Colonel William Bagenal Brewster, and one daughter, Elizabeth Mary, wife of Mr. Henry French, both of whom died in the lifetime of their father. A nephew, Edward Brewster, studied under Abraham Brewster and became a lawyer and politician in New South Wales.

Originally from Penrose Street, in the shadow of Shelbourne Park, the stadium named after Shelbourne F.C. (\\"the Shels\\", or \\"the Reds\\"), their then home ground, Arthur signed with 'the Shels' from the famous schoolboy nursery club, Johnville F.C. Already well known for his talent at junior level, the scouts were anxious to see how he would perform at this higher level. So well did he perform with 'the Reds', that it is almost forgotten he played for them only one season, 194849, before being transferred over the water. But it's no coincidence that that season was one of the best in the club's history, being in contention until the last match in all four available competitions, finally winning two of them, and finishing runner-up in the others. At the end of the season, he was part of a two-player deal when transferred (with Peter Desmond) to Middlesbrough F.C. in the English First Division. He went on to play in 223 games, scoring 49 goals. His teammates included Brian Clough and Wilf Mannion. In the 1960s, his coaching career took him to Libya, where he spent five and a half years in Tripoli until Colonel Gaddafi came to power, when he was advised to leave. In August 1967, he signed for Drogheda as player-coach, a position he shared with Theo Dunne. In April 1969, his contract was terminated. In June 1969, he was appointed manager of Shamrock Rovers, taking over from Liam Tuohy. Despite beating FC Schalke 04 in a 1969-70 European Cup Winners' Cup first leg tie, he was fired two months later. He also played 26 times for the Republic of Ireland national football team, scoring 7 goals. In 2009, Fitzsimons was inducted into the Football Association of Ireland Hall of Fame.

Passengers By 1961 it had five intermediate stations but local passenger traffic failed to develop. The area is sparsely populated, being in the flood plain of the river Colne and with the large Staines and Wraysbury reservoirs on both sides of the line.

Between Colnbrook and Staines Moor the track has been lifted and the formation built over in several places. Part of the viaduct at Staines Moor is used as a footpath. A fuel oil terminal was built in 1964 on the site of the former goods yard at Staines West. Simultaneously with the closure of the line south of Colnbrook in 1981 a new connecting line was built for it to the Staines to Windsor & Eton Line and this was used until closure in 1991.

Classic World Productions et al., New Jersey District Court, Judgment of February 16, 2006 at p. 2; www.websupp.org. C/F International's rights to later Tom Jones material were also subject to dispute. In March, 2007, Tom Jones and Tom Jones Enterprises sued C/F International to stop the company from licensing sound recordings made from Jones' 1981 series of variety shows, eponymously titled Tom Jones, which was syndicated in first-run by Rosen's prior company, EPI Limited.Per the closing credits for Tom Jones, from YouTube: \\"Tom Jones - Twist And Shout (1981) #Credits\\" It was contended that any rights that C/F International had to license the Tom Jones show did not include the right to make and license separate recordings of the performances on the show. In addition, it was contended that any rights that C/F International had in the Tom Jones show no longer existed, due to numerous breaches of contract.See Tom Jones seeks injunction over recordings, Music Week, March 2, 2007; www.musicweek.com. Examples of contentious CDs include Live on The Tom Jones Show (released 2006) and Greatest Hits Live (originally issued by C/F International in 1981; later license to and CD issue by Prism Leisure Corporation as 30 Greatest Hits - Live in Concert). The 1969-1971 This Is Tom Jones television shows are currently sold by Time-Life, rather than by Classic World Productions or C/F International.See This Is Tom Jones - 3 DVDs; www.timelife.com, accessed 09-01-21. In 2008, Burt Rosen died, and the company has subsequently folded. The extent of resolution of the previously referenced litigation is uncertain.

It was built on the site of the former Kew Bridge Studios. The theatre, seating 490 in 25 rows with a central aisle,Who's Who in the Theatre, 12th edition, Plans of Principal London Theatres was opened in 1924 by Jack and Beatie de Leon, and was one of a number of small, committed, independent theatre companies which included the Hampstead Everyman, the Arts Theatre Club and the Gate Theatre Studio. These theatres took risks by producing new and experimental plays which, although often at first thought to be commercially unviable on the West-End stage, later went on to transfer successfully. Actors including Dirk Bogarde,Bogarde, Dirk, A Postillion Struck by Lightning (autobiography) (1977) Chatto & Windus Joan Collins, Vivien Leigh, Margaret Lockwood, Barry Morse, and Anthony Quayle started their theatrical careers here. Peter Brook, Tony Richardson, Charles Hawtrey and William Gaskell directed plays here and the theatre staged the first plays of Terence Rattigan and William Douglas-Home.  Opening night  The new enterprise was originally advertised as \\"A Bright, Cosy Theatre for the presentation of successful WEST END PLAYS\\". The opening night was scheduled for September 1924, but the doors finally opened to the public on Boxing Day, 26 December 1924 with a production of Gertrude Jenning's The Young Person in Pink. But the occasion was marred by the over-selling of tickets, resulting in a number of disappointed and angry ticket-holders.
