Their son, Milton Arteles Elliott, was a 13-year-old private in the Confederate States of America Army. Mathew Brady photographed their younger son, William Sells Elliott, on the front porch of the house. Later, the Elliott House was an archaeological study of the relics of the time that the house was used as a Union hospital. This was during the time prior to the Battle of Poison Springs.

It is off exit 75 in Stonecrest, Georgia, which became a city in 2017, and opened in 2001 on the growing I-20 corridor.Urban Land, Volume 61, Issues 1-6, p. 45 The mall's anchors are Dillard's, JCPenney, and Macy's; there were previously a Kohl's (now offices for Atlanta Sports City) and Sears (soon to become the Stonecrest public safety center). Attached to the mall on the second floor is a movie theater located in the outdoor plaza near the pavilion food court. Across from the theater on the opposite side of the plaza is Round One Entertainment. Other stores and restaurants surround the mall. new restaurants are opening in the plaza as old ones close. Apartments and condos are also slowly increasing in the area, making Stonecrest a mixed-use community.\\"STONECREST: 4 YEARS OLD AND GROWING: Offices, houses join mix at mall\\", October 20, 2005, Atlanta Journal-Constitution The mall serves a diverse clientele including blacks and Hispanics, and provides both black and white Santas in the period running up to Christmas.\\"DIVERSITY CLAUSE: Mall at Stonecrest offers black and white Santas (beards are both white)\\", December 23, 2002, Atlanta Journal-Constitution History The mall was envisioned and planned in the last quarter of the 20th century, with the Atlanta Journal- Constitution reporting projected opening dates in the late 1980s (after the dedications of Gwinnett Place and Town Center at Cobb) and early 1990s (when North Point Mall opened). Originally proposed names included Turner Hill Mall, Interstate East Mall, and Metro East. Several times the project stalled because of developer issues. One land developer had problems getting retailers to commit (at the time, South DeKalb Mall was still thriving). The land was cleared several times, and local residents often questioned whether the mall would be built. DeKalb County planners at various times envisioned other things for the area, including a convention center, an outdoor theatre, mid- rise to high-rise apartment units, a MARTA rail station (proposed terminus for the east line), and a satellite college campus. While the county did construct a library (Stonecrest Library), in the mid-first decade of the 21st century MARTA was still reviewing plans for the east line rail extension to the mall with a proposed new sales tax, and economic development officials were still studying the viability of a convention center in the area is still viable. The goal would be to attract private investment with incentives rather than use public dollars to build. The mall finally opened on October 24, 2001, featuring Dillard's, JCPenney, Parisian, Rich's, and Sears, just like North Point Mall. In 2014, the Mayor of Lithonia, Deborah Jackson, proposed three successive plans to annex parts of what are now the City of Stonecrest. The earliest proposal included much of Lithonia Industrial Park, north of I-20. The final, and largest, proposal would have included much of what is now the City of Stonecrest, including Stonecrest Mall; much of the Stonecrest Regional Activity Center; and Lithonia Industrial Park. Numerous business owners in the Industrial Park banded together to fight the proposals. The City Council of Lithonia created a task force of stakeholders to study annexation. Members of the task force demanded that the mayor, at a minimum, obtain a feasibility study for annexation, as well as demonstrate to owners' satisfaction that annexation would not increase their property taxes. Mayor Jackson could not overcome the stakeholders' objections, and plans for annexation were dropped, thereby making possible creation of the new City of Stonecrest. The cityhood bill went through various legislative hurdles at the Georgia General Assembly and in November 2016 was approved by 59% of voters in a public referendum, with elections and official municipal incorporation in spring 2017. The mall and business corridor were previously served by the South Dekalb Business Association. In 2011, the Stonecrest Business Alliance Incorporated was formed to focus on the Stonecrest Overlay District. With the advent of the new City of Stonecrest, the Business Alliance has extended its membership to all businesses in the city. The sprawling East Metro DeKalb Community Improvement District was created by the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners in 2014. That CID is chronically underfunded, and has undertaken no projects within the City of Stonecrest other than limited off-duty police patrols in the western fringe of the city. It is proposed to be replaced within the City of Stonecrest by the future Stonecrest CID. In 2006 much of what is now the City of Stonecrest was included in the designation of the Arabia Mountain National Heritage Area by Act of Congress. The mall is accessible via the Arabia Mountain PATH, which runs throughout the area. Stonecrest Mall is one example of how businesses and residences can be included in a national heritage area unlike a national park. In May 2009, in response to sometimes violent disruption, the management instituted its Parental Involvement Program (derisively known in the community as the \\"anti-teenager policy\\"), whereby anyone under age 18 must be accompanied by an adult after a 4pm \\"curfew\\" on weekends, or be forced to leave by mall security.Jennifer Ffrench Parker, \\"Stonecrest placing limits on unaccompanied youth\\", Cross Roads News, April 2009, archived on November 23, 2010. In April 2010, an argument over a parking space led to a stabbing and a shooting.\\"Dispute over parking space leads to violence\\" The Augusta Chronicle, April 24, 2010. In December 2011, police had to quell a disturbance at the mall on the day of the release of a new Air Jordan limited edition shoe. The mall was to open at 8 AM but at about 7 AM already 200 people were waiting outside. The mall door was pried open and the crowd rushed inside to the door of the store selling the shoes.\\"Ugly scene at Stonecrest Mall as people stampede for Air Jordan sneakers\\", WXIA-TV - 11 Alive news (Atlanta), December 23, 2011.

On November 2, 2017, Sears announced that their location at The Mall at Stonecrest would also be closing as part of a plan to close 63 stores nationwide. The store closed in January 2018, while the former Parisian and Kohl's building that closed on November 1, 2016 became offices for Atlanta Sports City on October 5, 2017. On March 4, 2017, the mall opened Round One Entertainment, a bowling and amusement center featuring the latest Japanese arcade games, billiards, karaoke, ping pong, darts, and a restaurant with a full-service bar.

Waldie was then elected to the 89th Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Representative John F. Baldwin. He was re-elected four times, serving from June 7, 1966 to January 3, 1975. As a Congressman, he was an early critic of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, and also advocated health care reforms. During the Watergate scandal, Waldie was a vocal critic of President Richard Nixon. Three days after Nixon fired Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox (in what became known as the \\"Saturday Night Massacre\\"), Waldie introduced a resolution calling for the impeachment of the President, one of the first members of the House Judiciary Committee to do so. He later voted to impeach Nixon in July 1974 during the impeachment process against Richard Nixon. Waldie did not run for re-election to the Congress that year. Instead, he campaigned for the Democratic nomination for Governor of California in the June primary election but was defeated by then-Secretary of State Jerry Brown, who went on to win in November. Post-Congressional life As an ex- Congressman, Waldie served as a public advocate. He was chairman of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission from 1978 to 1979 and the executive director of the White House Conference on Aging (1980). He also served as member of the California Agricultural Relations Board from 1981 to 1985. He eventually retired to Placerville, California where he resided until his death in April 2009.

He is most notable for his service as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Montana. A native of Butte, Montana, he graduated from Carroll College in Helena, and attended Columbus School of Law at Catholic University of America and Georgetown University. Elected to the Montana House of Representatives in 1930 at age 21, he served from 1931 to 1934, and was one of the youngest state legislators in Montana's history. He served on the state Public Service Commission from 1934 to 1936. In 1936, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, and he served one term. O'Connell was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1938, and for election to Congress in 1940. O'Connell became involved in left wing politics beginning in the mid 1930s. In the 1940s, he was active in the state of Washington as a leader of the Democratic and Progressive parties, and was a backer of Henry A. Wallace in the 1948 presidential election. In 1950, O'Connell returned to Montana from Washington state. He was admitted to the bar and established a practice in Great Falls, Montana. He built a reputation as a capable criminal defense attorney, and practiced until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1956. O'Connell was buried in Great Falls. Background Born in Butte, Montana on June 14, 1909, O'Connell attended the parochial schools of Butte, including St. Patrick's School and Butte Central Catholic High School. He graduated from Carroll College (formerly Mount St. Charles College) in Helena, Montana in 1931, and attended Columbus School of Law at Catholic University of America and Georgetown University while working on the staff of the Democratic National Committee. Career Montana: O'Connell served in the Montana House of Representatives from 1931 to 1934. He served as member of the Montana Public Service Commission from 1934 to 1936. He served as a delegate to the all the Democratic State conventions between 1930 and 1940. In 1937, he spoke at a fundraiser for the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy. In 1937 and 1938, he published articles in the New Masses magazine. In May 1938, he spoke at an event for the International Labor Defense. By 1939, he was a member of the National Lawyers Guild. O'Connell's friend Robert Marshall was the chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management for the United States Forest Service from 1937 to 1939. Marshall died in 1939, and O'Connell was appointed head trustee of one of the foundations created by Marshall's will, the pro-conservation Robert Marshall Wilderness Fund, which worked to improve political coordination between organized labor, farm advocacy organizations, and advocates for the unemployed. Washington, DC: O'Connell was elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-fifth Congress (January 3, 1937 ‚Äì January 3, 1939). During his House service, he traveled to Spain with his friend, Congressman John Bernard of Minnesota. Bernard was a communist sympathizer, and O'Connell and Bernard were in Spain to demonstrate support for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, one of the International Brigades organized by the Communist International to oppose the fascists led by Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War. O'Connell ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1938 to the Seventy-sixth Congress, and for election to the Seventy-seventh Congress in 1940. Washington State: O'Connell moved to Seattle, Washington, in June 1944. He served as executive secretary of the Washington State Democratic Central Committee from December 1944 to January 1947, for the Roosevelt Democrats in 1947, and for the Washington State Progressive Party in 1948 and 1949. He was also an instructor at the Seattle Labor School from 1946 to 1949. These affiliations later became the subject of questioning by Congressional investigators. Washington, DC: In June 1948, O'Connell served as chairman of the \\"National Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill\\"; the Mundt-Nixon Bill had passed the U.S. House of Representatives but was stalled in the U.S. Senate. The bill would have required all members of the Communist Party of the United States to register with the U.S. Attorney General, but opponents were successful at preventing its passage. In June 1949, he signed a letter in support of the defendants in the Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders. Montana: O'Connell completed his legal studies by reading law, and was admitted to the Montana bar in 1950. He practiced law in Great Falls until his death. In 1951, he defended Frank Dryman for the murder of Clarence Chester Pellett. O'Connell succeeded in each appeal, so that from 1952 to 1954 the Montana courts overturned two death sentences. In February 1955, Dryman received a life sentence. HUAC testimony In 1950, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) singled out O'Connell as an alleged communist sympathizer in his role as chairman of the National Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill (NCDMB), the sponsors of which, Representatives Karl E. Mundt and Richard M. Nixon, had both been HUAC members. Their report focused on supposed ties between O'Connell, the Communist Party and the National Lawyers Guild, both of which supported the Progressive Party; O'Connell had been an important Progressive Party member in the state of Washington. In 1955, he appeared before HUAC, which questioned him widely about possible communist ties, including his support of Henry A. Wallace's bid for president as a Progressive in 1948. O'Connell denied any affiliation with communists or communism, making use of his debating skills and training as an attorney to effectively counter the evidence presented against him. O'Connell was intentionally vague when answering questions about his role in the NCDMB. For instance, when asked whether he held any position in the organization, O'Connell at first said, \\"No,\\" but then agreed that he had joined NCDMB in June 1948 and specified \\"probably September 13,\\" 1950, as the end date for this affiliation. As a result of O'Connell's efforts during the hearing, the Committee gained no new evidence, which reduced its reputation for effectiveness. Death and burial O'Connell died of a heart attack in Great Falls on January 16, 1956. He was buried at Hillcrest Lawn Memorial Mausoleum in Great Falls. Family In 1931, O'Connell married Alvena Lois Smith of Townsend, Montana. After their divorce, in 1937 O'Connell married Mazie Elizabeth Richardson (1914-2005) of Great Falls. They were the parents of sons, Jerry D. (1949-2002) and Marshall (b. 1956). (Marshall O'Connell was born five months after his father's death.) Mazie O'Connell had pursued a show business career before her marriage. After the death of her husband, she worked in retail sales and management, and later owned and operated several Great Falls businesses, including bridal and formal wear stores. In 1984, Mrs. O'Connell married John D. Ross (d. 1990), a friend from high school. References Sources =Books=  * =Newspapers=     =Internet=    External sources * govtrack.us: Rep.

Early life Don H·ªì, whose real name is H·ªì M·∫°nh D≈©ng, was born on February 22, 1962 in Saigon, Vietnam. His family originally came from northern Vietnam, but they left in 1954 through Operation Passage to Freedom, fleeing the encroachment of communist rule over North Vietnam. He came to the United States in 1980 and attended Santa Ana Valley High School. During his senior year, he participated in a choral group called Chamber Singers. As a young man, Don H·ªì has proved to be skillful in painting. He received a scholarship from an art school in New York, but his love for singing turned him from his path to becoming a painter. Career =Th√∫y Nga (1990‚Äì2004, 2009‚Äìpresent)= In 1990, Don H·ªì appeared in two medleys in Paris By Night 12. After the release of the VHS, fans praised the singer and requested more from him. He performed for Paris by Night 15 in 1992, singing Paul Anka's song, Diana and starting a decade-long career with Th√∫y Nga. They had many notable hits, such as \\"Tinh Nhat Phai (Caravan of Life)\\", \\"Vuc Sau Hanh Phuc\\", \\"I (Who Have Nothing)\\", & \\"Mot Thuo Yeu Nguoi\\". In 2000, to celebrate H·ªì's 10th year with the production, Thuy Nga released \\"Nhip Buoc Hoang Vu,\\" a video collection featuring new music videos, an interview with Don H·ªì, and singers congratulating him on his success. But soon after, Don's career took a step back as younger singers came in to match a new generation. 2004 brought Paris By Night 73 with Don H·ªì performing with Loan Ch√¢u in a Chinese-inspired performance. At this time, Don decided to not renew his contract with Th√∫y Nga, to pursue other ventures with other music companies. In 2008, Th√∫y Nga celebrated Paris By Night's 25th Anniversary. Don H·ªì decided to return to Thuy Nga at this point, a few years after his contract ended and after venturing with other productions. He performed Diem Xua by Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n in a sea-inspired production which was highly praised for his return. As of 2013, Don has performed in each Paris by Night production, except Paris By Night 97, as he wasn't a participant of the competition. In these performances, Don is well known to have created animations to go with the song, seen in \\"LK Tinh Em Ngon Nen\\", \\"Con Tim Mu Loa\\", and \\"Tai Sao La Khong?\\". He is also well known for performing duets with the likes of Thanh Ha, Chau Ngoc, and Nhu Loan. Coming out from Th√∫y Nga Productions, Don H·ªì has become one of the most innovative, visually, conceptually Vietnamese American artists on stage up to today. =Other ventures= As Don left Th√∫y Nga after his contract expires, he would sign with Asia Productions, which he had relations with in the 1990s. He first appear with the production in their first video, taking place in Las Vegas. The song that Don H·ªì would be best known for, is \\"Trai Tim Mua Dong\\" which appeared in Asia's Christmas Special in 1995. During this time, Don would not appear on Asia's stage as his Th√∫y Nga contract and other obligations prevented him from appearing, so he would appear in music videos made for the program. In 2005, Don's contract with Th√∫y Nga had ended, so Don went on to appear in numerous Asia videos. Asia's fans had lauded the return of Don H·ªì as he brought creativity to his appearances and in these performances, Don would perform by himself and in duets with Lam Thuy Van, Lam Nhat Tien, and Dieu Huong, who writes many of the songs Don has performed. During this time, he appeared in many other videos including Tinh Music and Van Son Entertainment. Many of them included Don H·ªì's graphics and artwork, which has amazed fans everywhere. Don has ended pursuing other ventures, as he returned to Th√∫y Nga, where he is more globally recognized. Personal life Don H·ªì loves to eat chicken noodle soup and B√∫n thang, a Northern Vietnamese dish. Don also enjoys traveling. He attended Chu Van An School in Saigon, Katella High School, Los Amigos High School and later Orange Coast College, Golden West College, and Cal State Fullerton.

A Unitarian minister, he played a leading role in the early history of Harvard Divinity School, and he later became involved in politics as a State Representative and U.S. Congressman. Early life and education He was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Mary Sturgis Gorham and John Palfrey, a son of the merchant and Patriot William Palfrey. In 1803, his mother died soon after giving birth, and in 1804 his father moved to Baltimore. Palfrey began school at the Berry Street Academy in Boston and studied Greek and Latin with William Ellery Channing. He completed preparatory studies as a \\"charity student\\" at Phillips Exeter Academy, Exeter, New Hampshire, and graduated from Harvard University in 1815. He studied theology at Harvard Divinity School, graduating in its second class. Theologian Palfrey was ordained minister of Boston's Brattle Square Unitarian Church on June 17, 1818. He held the usual duties of preaching two sermons every Sunday (with a substitute every fourth Sunday), calling on all his parishioners at least once a year, teaching Sunday school, and visiting the sick and poor. He was a member of the American Unitarian Association. A bas-relief by William Wetmore Story at Harvard When the Society for the Promotion of Theological Education, which controlled Harvard Divinity School at the time, appealed to alumni for funds to build Divinity Hall, Palfrey preached two sermons to raise $2,000. He became the society's secretary in 1827 and a Harvard Overseer in 1828, when he also began teaching part-time. In 1831, after Andrews Norton retired in 1830, he became a Professor of Biblical Literature and Dean of Faculty at the Divinity School and removed to Cambridge. In this position, in addition to teaching the Bible, Hebrew, and other semitic languages, he was in charge of the building, organized faculty meetings, and was the chief disciplinarian. He made changes, including instituting a new set of rules for the school, reorganizing the curriculum, and dealing with complaints from faculty members about their salaries. As a professor, he taught Unitarian ministers such as Andrew Peabody, William Henry Channing, James Freeman Clarke, Chandler Robbins, William Greenleaf Eliot, Cyrus A. Bartol, Charles Timothy Brooks, George Edward Ellis, Abiel Abbot Livermore, Theodore Parker, Henry Whitney Bellows, Edmund Hamilton Sears, Rufus Phineas Stebbins, the philosopher William Dexter Wilson, the artist Christopher Pearse Cranch, the music critic John Sullivan Dwight, and the Swedenborgian Benjamin Fiske Barrett. After living in Divinity Hall with his students for several months, Palfrey built a house north of the college on he bought, which was the Palfrey home until 1916, when it was bought by Harvard. It still stands today as Palfrey House, part of the Department of Physics. For a picture, see: https://web.archive.org/web/20100708105701/http://www.hepl.harvard.edu/intro.html Editor and author To add to his income, Palfrey was at various times in his life editor of several publications. First, in 1824 and 1825 he was editor of the Christian Disciple, which he renamed the Christian Examiner. He was editor of the North American Review from 1835 to 1843, having become a financial partner in that publication in 1817 and having bought the Review in 1835. Difficulty managing both teaching and editing led him to resign from the Divinity School in 1839 when the Corporation would not allow him to teach part-time. He sold the Review in 1842 after it had become a financial liability, partly due to the Panic of 1837. As a writer he is best known by his History of New England to the Revolutionary War, in five volumes, of which the first appeared in 1859 and the last posthumously in 1890. The writing of this consumed much of his later life, and he worked with early state sources and made a research trip to England in 1856. He also wrote various works on theology earlier in his career. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1856.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Politician Not having been politically involved or written in newspapers, he was nevertheless elected as a Whig to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1842 and 1843. He was chairman of the House Standing Committee on Education, working closely with Horace Mann. During his second term, however, the Whigs were in the minority, leading to several legislative disappointments, so he sought state office instead of re-election to the House. He became Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, a post he held from 1844 to 1848. As secretary, a largely ceremonial position, he introduced statistical tables which set a new standard for the state, organized the Revolutionary War records to better answer pension claims, and organized the state's 14,000 volumes and 40,000 pamphlets of written records. Palfrey was elected as a Whig to the Thirtieth Congress (March 4, 1847 ‚Äì March 3, 1849). He was a \\"Conscience Whig\\" who opposed slavery, having freed sixteen slaves inherited from his father, who, like his two brothers, was a successful Louisiana plantation owner. In Washington, he was a member of a small group of anti-slavery congressmen, including Joshua Giddings, who met regularly. His anti-slavery views alienated him from more conservative members of his district, such as the \\"Cotton Whigs,\\" and in 1848 he was unsuccessful in his campaign for re-election on the Free-Soil ticket. (The seat remained vacant for the 31st Congress despite multiple elections, in which no candidate achieved the needed 51% majority.) He was also the Free-Soil candidate for Governor of Massachusetts in 1851. In addition to opposing slavery, Congressman Palfrey advocated for the rights of free blacks traveling in the South and attempted unsuccessfully to remove provisions that limited suffrage to whites in Oregon's Territorial Constitution.Eric Foner, Politics and Prejudice: The Free Soil Party and the Negro, 1849-1852 As the anti-slavery movement grew in Massachusetts and the Republican Party emerged, Palfrey's political fortunes improved again. After Abraham Lincoln's election in 1861, Senator Charles Sumner secured him appointment as Postmaster of Boston, a post he held from 1861 to 1867. He suffered a stroke in the mid-1870s and died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on April 26, 1881. He was interred in Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge. Family The interior of Mary Ann Hammond's residence at 72 Beacon Street shows her seated with Charles Hammond Gibso and her cat, Topsy, in a richly decorated room In March 1823, Palfrey married one of his parishioners, Mary Ann Hammond (1800‚Äì1897). Their children were Sarah Hammond (1823‚Äì1914), a novelist and poet; Hannah (1825); Francis Winthrop Palfrey (1831), historian of the Civil War; and John Carver Palfrey (1833‚Äì1906), a military engineer in the Civil War and a textile manufacturer. Mary Ann Hammond was the cousin of Charles Hammond Gibson, Sr., whose son, Charles Hammond Gibson Jr opened the Gibson House Museum.

It is located on the west side of the Ngozumpa glacier, which is the largest glacier in Nepal and reputed to be the largest in the whole Himalayas. Gokyo (4,750 m, 15,583 ft above sea level), at the base of Gokyo Ri, is a small hamlet of a few stone houses and one of the highest settlements in the world. From the summit of Gokyo Ri it is possible to see four 8,000-metre peaks: Mount Everest, Lhotse, Makalu and Cho Oyu.https://www.google.com/earth/ The Gokyo Lakes are in the area. The Gokyo trek is a fairly popular trekking route. The route itself ends at Gokyo Ri, and trekkers typically turn around at this point and retrace their steps back to the trailhead. There is an alternative mountaineering route that begins near the southern tip of Ngozumpa Glacier and just south of Taujun Lake. This alternative route leads east over the Cho La, a pass at 5,420 m (17,782 ft), where it meets with the main Everest Base Camp trek. It is usually visited during the circuit trek of Everest Base Camp with 3 Passes trek. It is slightly off route while visiting Everest base camps (Nepal side) but thousands of backpackers still visit it for the Gokyo Lakes beauty. There is another higher summit just north of where the main Gokyo trek route ends. It stands at an altitude of above sea level.

(Although the territory he represented was generally the same, in eastern Los Angeles County, the district was renumbered several times during his congressional career.) Born in 1927 in Los Angeles, California, Rousselot attended the public schools of San Marino and South Pasadena. He received a B.A. from Principia College, Elsah, Illinois, in 1949, and went to work as an insurance agent. During the 1950s he also was an author and public relations consultant. From 1954 to 1955, Rousselot served as assistant to the public relations director of Pacific Finance Corp., Los Angeles, California. He served as deputy to the chairman of the California Board of Equalization in 1956, and was director of public information for the Federal Housing Administration in Washington, D.C., from 1958 to 1960. Rousselot resigned his position at the FHA to return to southern California to run for Congress. His first notable political activity had been as a delegate to the 1956 Republican National Convention, and he had served as a member of the executive committee of the California Republican State Central Committee in 1956‚Äì57. Rousselot was elected as a Republican to the Eighty-seventh Congress (January 3, 1961 - January 3, 1963) from California's 25th congressional district, defeating Democratic incumbent George A. Kasem. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the Eighty-eighth Congress in 1962, losing to Democrat Ronald B. Cameron. During the next few years, Rousselot worked as a management consultant and as Western regional director for the ultraconservative John Birch Society. His longtime association with this group had stimulated controversy during his career as a Congressman. Two of his allies during this time were the ultraconservative, resigned General Edwin Walker, and the segregationist Reverend Billy James Hargis.http://thislandpress.com/11/02/2012/the-strange-love-of-dr-billy-james- hargis/ All three were longtime members of the John Birch Society. Rousselot was elected to the Ninety-first Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Representative Glenard P. Lipscomb in California's 24th congressional district, and reelected to the six succeeding Congresses (June 30, 1970 - January 3, 1983). In the Republican primary for the 1970 special election, he narrowly edged out former congressman Patrick Hillings and former football star and doctor Bill McColl. In the special general election he handily defeated Democrat Myrlie Evers, the widow of assassinated civil rights activist Medgar Evers. The district still was numbered the 24th when he won full terms in 1970 and 1972, but a 1973 redistricting ordered by the California Supreme Court renumbered it the 26th. Rousselot was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1982 after a partisan redistricting divided his old congressional district, leading him to run in the 30th District represented by Democrat Matthew Martinez, who won the general election by 54% to 46%. Rousselot served as special assistant to President Ronald Reagan in 1983, and as president of the National Council of Savings Institutions, a lobbying group, from 1985 to 1988. He was an unsuccessful candidate for nomination to the One Hundred Third Congress in 1992 in the newly redrawn 25th Congressional District, which ultimately was won by Republican Howard McKeon.

The New Forest Tour is an open-top bus service in the New Forest, running three circular routes around Lyndhurst, Brockenhurst, Lymington, Beaulieu and Exbury Gardens, Ringwood, Fordingbridge, Cadnam and Ashurst and New Milton, Milford on sea, and Burley . It is run by Bluestar and Wilts & Dorset in partnership with Hampshire County Council, New Forest District Council and the New Forest National Park Authority. History East Lancs Myllennium Vyking bodied Volvo B7TL in the current New Forest Tour livery in May 2009 The tour was set up in 2004 by Solent Blue Line and City Sightseeing. The aim was to get traffic off the roads in and around the New Forest. When started, Solent Blue Line used a Bristol VR on a circular tour around the forest with a bike trailer. In 2005, the tour continued in a similar form, except the route was reversed to today's anti-clockwise version. In 2006 Solent Blue Line operated the tour with two nearly-new open-top buses from Wilts & Dorset. This was possible due to a ¬£100,000 payment from Hampshire County Council. With an additional combined ¬£30,000 funding every year for three years from the New Forest District Council and National Park Authority, the tour could run hourly instead of two hourly. The buses were Volvo B7TL/East Lancs Myllenniums, low floor and accessible to wheelchair users. They operated in full Wilts & Dorset livery and fleetnames, with New Forest Tour lettering. The Bike trailer was continued on the updated service, and buses served Exbury Gardens. In 2007, the association with City Sightseeing was dropped, the 2006 review concluding that marketing should be developed with core funding partners, in a way \\"appropriate for the New Forest destination\\". The same buses as used in 2006 were used on the tour this year, which by now Solent Blue Line had acquired from Wilts & Dorset, both being part of Go South Coast. As part of the new marketing, the vehicles were painted in a new green livery with ponies on the side, essentially a green version of Southern Vectis' Island Breezers livery. The Tour's website was launched, and 60,000 leaflets were distributed to over 300 places. An official guide was also launched, given to passengers as they boarded the tour. The buses no longer towed trailers, carrying bicycles on the lower deck instead. Prior to the 2008 service starting, Solent Blue Line renamed all of its services to run under the Bluestar name. The New Forest Tour remained a separate brand, but details now appear on the Bluestar website. The tour ran from 24 May to 31 August, and the connections to the tour were withdrawn. A professionally recorded commentary was added to the service. Continued operations 2008 was the final year of the three year funding commitment. In the 2008 review, Bluestar stated that revenue from ticket sales alone do not cover the cost of the current operation. To continue the tour in the same format into 2009 would require a subsidy. Therefore, a tender exercise is currently being worked on by Hampshire County Council to determine the level of subsidy required. This will allow for any operator to bid for the tender. A number of options are being considered, such as continuing as in 2008, only operating between Wednesdays and Sundays, only operating on the weekend and only using one bus. The tour did return in 2009, between Saturday 20 June and Sunday 13 September 2009, running a similar service to 2008. For the 2012 season new GPS commentary was added to the two tours (the red tour was introduced). For 2013 the tours ran between 29 June and 15 September that year. A new blue tour was introduced because of the popularity of the other two tours the previous year. This tour originally ran hourly, but Wilts & Dorset later figured out that they couldn't run it on time on an hourly basis, so they changed the frequency to every hour and 15 mins, still using two buses. The other two routes remained hourly.

Based on a true story, the film stars Alyssa Milano and Cameron Bancroft as a young couple who attempt to survive in the rough Alaskan wilderness. Plot Set in 1979, the film focuses on a Seattleite couple, police officer and former park ranger Roger Lewis (Bancroft), and 22-year-old waitress Denise Harris (Milano). They are invited by businessman Wylie Bennett (Fraser) to Alaska to head out to the fictional wilderness of Surprise Bay and find a goldmine. If they are successful in retrieving gold, they are awarded 10% of the profit. Denise is hesitant to travel into the wilderness, though blindly follows her boyfriend, who regards the exploring as a great adventure. They are flown to the location, roughly 75 miles away from the nearest 'civilization', with just a dog and a radio with bad reception. There, they are set up in a cabin, where they spend their first couple of weeks. When they realize that their food supply is running out and that nobody is coming to help them, they become afraid. Roger considers shooting a deer, but Denise opposes such due to her vegetarianism. Even though sometime later they find their first gold, they realize that it will not buy them dinner in the wilderness. With winter coming, they decide that they must head back to civilization. They gather supplies and their gold and take the canoe, considering it is their only form of transportation. By day three, a storm throws Denise in the water and swamps the canoe. By day five, Bill DeCreeft (Rekert), the aviator who flew them to their Surprise Bay destination, finds out that nobody flew out to the couple for a food supply, and starts a search for them. Roger and Denise, meanwhile, have set out a camp near the river in hope of a boat sailing by. When they realize that they are all alone, they know that they have to travel inland, despite the dangers, and they are forced to turn their weaknesses into strengths in order to survive. While Bill starts a major search, Roger and Denise have to face several obstacles. Denise loses their food supply when she struggles to cross a river; Roger gets mad at her for not having tied the food supply to the rope that she used. She tries to apologize, but he does not listen until he almost falls to his death shortly after. The temperature grows colder rapidly, and they not only have to worry dying from starvation, but also from hypothermia. Furthermore, Denise almost dies when she breaks through ice and falls in freezing water. Somehow she makes it out, and, regarding it as a miracle, she grows determined to make it to civilization, despite the fact that Roger is now losing hope. As days pass by without food, Denise suggests eating the dog. Roger refuses to kill Newman, explaining that he loves the dog too much. By day fourteen, Roger has contracted frostbite and is unable to talk. Roger wants to accept that they are dying and proposes to end their lives with their remaining bullets, but Denise refuses to give up. By day seventeen, they spot a helicopter led by DeCreeft that is looking for them, but the helicopter flyer fails to notice them. Realizing that there is a search out for them, Denise convinces Roger to travel to open land and create a signal. By day nineteen, they are spotted and rescued by DeCreeft.

It is one of the most recently derived parts of the human brain. It undergoes a prolonged period of maturation which lasts until adulthood. The DLPFC is not an anatomical structure, but rather a functional one. It lies in the middle frontal gyrus of humans (i.e., lateral part of Brodmann's area (BA) 9 and 46Brodmann, 1909). In macaque monkeys, it is around the principal sulcus (i.e., in Brodmann's area 46Walker, 1940). Other sources consider that DLPFC is attributed anatomically to BA 9 and 46 and BA 8, 9 and 10. The DLPFC has connections with the orbitofrontal cortex, as well as the thalamus, parts of the basal ganglia (specifically, the dorsal caudate nucleus), the hippocampus, and primary and secondary association areas of neocortex (including posterior temporal, parietal, and occipital areas). The DLPFC is also the end point for the dorsal pathway (stream), which is concerned with how to interact with stimuli. An important function of the DLPFC is the executive functions, such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstract reasoning. However, the DLPFC is not exclusively responsible for the executive functions. All complex mental activity requires the additional cortical and subcortical circuits with which the DLPFC is connected. The DLPFC is also the highest cortical area that is involved in motor planning, organization and regulation. Structure As the DLPFC is composed of spatial selective neurons, it has a neural circuitry that encompasses the entire range of sub- functions necessary to carry out an integrated response, such as: sensory input, retention in short-term memory, and motor signaling. Historically, the DLPFC was defined by its connection to: the superior temporal cortex, the posterior parietal cortex, the anterior and posterior cingulate, the premotor cortex, the retrosplenial cortex, and the neocerebellum. These connections allow the DLPFC to regulate the activity of those regions, as well as to receive information from and be regulated by those regions. Function =Primary functions= The DLPFC is known for its involvement in the executive functions, which is an umbrella term for the management of cognitive processes,Elliott R (2003). Executive functions and their disorders. British Medical Bulletin. (65); 49‚Äì59 including working memory, cognitive flexibility, and planning. A couple of tasks have been very prominent in the research on the DLPFC, such as the A-not-B task, the delayed response task and object retrieval tasks. The behavioral task that is most strongly linked to DLPFC is the combined A-not-B/delayed response task, in which the subject has to find a hidden object after a certain delay. This task requires holding information in mind (working memory), which is believed to be one of the functions of DLPFC. The importance of DLPFC for working memory was strengthened by studies with adult macaques. Lesions that destroyed DLPFC disrupted the macaques‚Äô performance of the A-not-B/delayed response task, whereas lesions to other brain parts did not impair their performance on this task. DLPFC is not required for the memory of a single item. Thus, damage to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex does not impair recognition memory. Nevertheless, if two items must be compared from memory, the involvement of DLPFC is required. People with damaged DLPFC are not able to identify a picture they had seen, after some time, when given the opportunity to choose from two pictures. Moreover, these subjects also failed in Wisconsin Card-Sorting Test as they lose track of the currently correct rule and persistently organize their cards in the previously correct rule. In addition, as DLPFC deals with waking thought and reality testing, it is not active when one is asleep. Likewise, DLPFC is most frequently related to the dysfunction of drive, attention and motivation. Patients with minor DLPFC damage display disinterest in their surroundings and are deprived of spontaneity in language as well as behavior. Patients may also be less alert than normal to people and events they know. Damage to this region in a person also leads to the lack of motivation to do things for themselves and/or for others. Decision making The DLPFC is involved in both risky and moral decision making; when individuals have to make moral decisions like how to distribute limited resources, the DLPFC is activated. This region is also active when costs and benefits of alternative choices are of interest. Similarly, when options for choosing alternatives are present, the DLPFC evokes a preference towards the most equitable option and suppresses the temptation to maximize personal gain. Working memory Working memory is the system that actively holds multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind, where they can be manipulated. The DLPFC is important for working memory; reduced activity in this area correlates to poor performance on working memory tasks. However, other areas of the brain are involved in working memory as well. There is an ongoing discussion if the DLPFC is specialized in a certain type of working memory, namely computational mechanisms for monitoring and manipulating items, or if it has a certain content, namely visuospatial information, which makes it possible to mentally represent coordinates within the spatial domain. There have also been some suggestions that the function of the DLPFC in verbal and spatial working memory is lateralised into the left and right hemisphere, respectively. Smith, Jonides and Koeppe (1996) observed a lateralisation of DLPFC activations during verbal and visual working memory. Verbal working memory tasks mainly activated the left DLPFC and visual working memory tasks mainly activated the right DLPFC. Murphy et al. (1998)Murphy, D. G. M., Daly, E. M., Van Amelsvoort, T., Robertson, D., Simmons, A., & Critchley, H. D. (1998). Functional neuroanatomical dissociation of verbal, visual and spatial working memory. Schizophrenia Research. http://doi.org/10.1016/S0920-9964(97)88566-0 also found that verbal working memory tasks activated the right and left DLPFC, whereas spatial working memory tasks predominantly activated the left DLPFC. Reuter-Lorenz et al. (2000) found that activations of the DLPFC showed prominent lateralisation of verbal and spatial working memory in young adults, whereas in older adults this lateralisation was less noticeable. It was proposed that this reduction in lateralisation could be due to recruitment of neurons from the opposite hemisphere to compensate for neuronal decline with ageing. =Secondary functions= The DLPFC may also be involved in the act of deception and lying, which is thought to inhibit normal tendency to truth telling. Research also suggests that using TMS on the DLPFC can impede a person's ability to lie or to tell the truth. Additionally, supporting evidence suggests that the DLPFC may also play a role in conflict-induced behavioral adjustment, for instance when an individual decides what to do when faced with conflicting rules. One way in which this has been tested is through the Stroop test, in which subjects are shown a name of a color printed in colored ink and then are asked to name the color of the ink as fast as possible. Conflict arises when the color of the ink does not match the name of the printed color. During this experiment, tracking of the subjects‚Äô brain activity showed a noticeable activity within the DLPFC. The activation of the DLPFC correlated with the behavioral performance, which suggests that this region maintains the high demands of the task to resolve conflict, and thus in theory plays a role in taking control. DLPFC may also be associated with human intelligence. However, even when correlations are found between the DLPFC and human intelligence, that does not mean that all human intelligence is a function of the DLPFC. In other words, this region may be attributed to general intelligence on a broader scale as well as very specific roles, but not all roles. For example, using imaging studies like PET and fMRI indicate DLPFC involvement in deductive, syllogistic reasoning. Specifically, when involved in activities that require syllogistic reasoning, left DLPFC areas are especially and consistently active. The DLPFC may also be involved in threat-induced anxiety. In one experiment, participants were asked to rate themselves as behaviorally inhibited or not. Those who rated themselves as behaviorally inhibited, moreover, showed greater tonic (resting) activity in the right-posterior DLPFC. Such activity is able to be seen through Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Individuals who are behaviorally inhibited are more likely to experience feelings of stress and anxiety when faced with a particularly threatening situation. In one theory, anxiety susceptibility may increase as a result of present vigilance. Evidence for this theory includes neuroimaging studies that demonstrate DLPFC activity when an individual experiences vigilance. More specifically, it is theorized that threat-induced anxiety may also be connected to deficits in resolving problems, which leads to uncertainty. When an individual experiences uncertainty, there is increased activity in the DLPFC. In other words, such activity can be traced back to threat-induced anxiety. Social cognition Among the prefrontal lobes, the DLPFC seems to be the one that has the least direct influence on social behavior, yet it does seem to give clarity and organization to social cognition. The DLPFC seems to contribute to social functions through the operation of its main speciality the executive functions, for instance when handling complex social situations. Social areas in which the role of the DLPFC is investigated are, amongst others, social perspective taking and inferring the intentions of other people, or theory of mind; the suppression of selfish behavior, and commitment in a relationship. Relation to neurotransmitters As the DLPFC undergoes long maturational changes, one change that has been attributed to the DLPFC for making early cognitive advances is the increasing level of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the DLPFC. In studies where adult macaques' dopamine receptors were blocked, it was seen that the adult macaques had deficits in the A-not-B task, as if the DFPLC was taken out altogether. A similar situation was seen when the macaques were injected with MPTP, which reduces the level of dopamine in the DLPFC. Even though there have been no physiological studies about involvement of cholinergic actions in sub-cortical areas, behavioral studies indicate that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is essential for working memory function of the DLPFC. Clinical significance =Schizophrenia= Schizophrenia may be partially attributed to a lack in activity in the frontal lobe. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is especially underactive when a person suffers from chronic schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is also related to lack of dopamine neurotransmitter in the frontal lobe. The DLPFC dysfunctions are unique among the schizophrenia patients as those that are diagnosed with depression do not tend to have the same abnormal activation in the DLPFC during working memory- related tasks. Working memory is dependent upon the DLPFC‚Äôs stability and functionality, thus reduced activation of the DLPFC causes schizophrenic patients to perform poorly on tasks involving working memory. The poor performance contributes to the added capacity limitations in working memory that is greater than the limits on normal patients. The cognitive processes that deal heavily with the DLPFC, such as memory, attention, and higher order processing, are the functions that once distorted contribute to the illness. =Depression= Along with regions of the brains such as the limbic system, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex deals heavily with major depressive disorder (MDD). The DLPFC may contribute to depression due to being involved with the disorder on an emotional level during the suppression stage. While working memory tasks seem to activate the DLPFC normally,Cite error: The named reference Functional_Genomics was invoked but never defined its decreased grey matter volume correlates to its decreased activity. The DLPFC may also have ties to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in their functions with depression. This can be attributed to how the DLPFC‚Äôs cognitive functions can also involve emotions, and the VMPFC‚Äôs emotional effects can also involve self-awareness or self-reflection. Damage or lesion to the DLPFC can also lead to increased expression of depression symptoms. =Stress= Exposure to severe stress may also be linked to damage in the DLPFC. More specifically, acute stress has a negative impact on the higher cognitive function known as working memory (WM), which is also traced to be a function of the DLPFC. In an experiment, researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record the neural activity in healthy individuals who participated in tasks while in a stressful environment. When stress successfully impacted the subjects, their neural activity showed reduced working memory related activity in the DLPFC. These findings not only demonstrate the importance of the DLPFC region in relation to stress, but they also suggest that the DLPFC may play a role in other psychiatric disorders. In patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), for example, daily sessions of right dorsolateral prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at a frequency of 10 Hz resulted in more effective therapeutic stimulation. =Substance abuse= Substance abuse of drugs, or substance use disorder (SUD), may correlate with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction. Those who abuse drugs have been shown to engage in increased risky behavior, possibly correlating with a dysfunction of the DLPFC. The executive controlling functions of the DLPFC in individuals who display drug abuse may have a connection that is lessen from risk factoring areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. This weakened connection is even shown in healthy subjects, such as a patient who continued to make risky decisions with a disconnect between their DLPFC and insula. Lesions of the DLPFC may result in irresponsibility and freedom from inhibitions, and the abuse of drugs can invoke the same response of willingness or inspiration to engage in daring activity. Alcohol Alcohol creates deficits on the function of the prefrontal cortex. As the ACC works to inhibit any inappropriate behaviors through processing information to the executive network of the DLPFC, as noted before this disruption in communication can lead to these actions being made. In a task known as Cambridge risk task, SUD participants have been shown to have a lower activation of their DLPFC. Specifically in a test related to alcoholism, a task called the Wheel of Fortune (WOF) had adolescents with a family history of alcoholism present lower DLPFC activation. Adolescents that have had no family members with a history of alcoholism did not exhibit the same decrease of activity.

The compliant Vichy government seeks to appease the Germans by locating the perpetrators and agreeing to the execution of six people, and a special section is set up for this purpose. The section consists of judges who are too ambitious, cowardly or inhuman to refuse such work.

Located on the summit of the \\"Holy Hill\\" area of Berkeley, California, its collections comprise one of the largest collections of theological works in the United States, with over 500,000 volumes http://www.ats.edu/uploads/resources/institutional-data/annual-data- tables/2013-2014-annual-data-tables.pdf as of 2014. The library's collections are open to the public. Borrower privileges are accessible not only to students and faculty of the GTU's consortial seminaries and affiliated centers, but also to the faculty and students of the University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, and American Theological Library Association institutions participating in Reciprocal Borrowing. The Hewlett Library also maintains a branch on the campus of San Francisco Theological Seminary at San Anselmo. It also has storage facilities on the campus of the American Baptist Seminary of the West and at Santa Clara University. History Prior to the construction of the Hewlett Library and the founding of the GTU, seminaries throughout the Bay Area had cooperative lending programs. As many of the seminaries moved to Berkeley in the wake of the founding of the University of California, Berkeley, projects were initiated that included united cataloging and periodical lists. In 1963, a year after the incorporation of the GTU, John Dillenberger established a GTU Library Committee to find ways to collaborate with regards to research materials between seminaries. In 1969, the GTU Common Library was established and had its first home at the Church Divinity School of the Pacific. In 1972, the process for designing and constructing the Common Library's building began. The building's distinctive, terraced design was based on preliminary sketches by famed architect Louis I. Kahn. After Kahn's unexpected death in 1974, the GTU selected the San Francisco, California-based architectural firm of Peters, Clayberg, and Caulfield, in association with Esherick Homsey Dodge & Davis, to design the building. Thomas J. Caulfield was appointed lead architect. Built in phases, construction on the building's first phase began in 1979, and it opened in 1981. The final phase of the building was completed in 1987. The library was named for Flora Lamson Hewlett, wife of Hewlett-Packard founder William Hewlett, thanks to support for the project from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Events To kick off Theological Libraries Month the Hewlett Library holds a booksale on the feastday of Saint Jerome (September 30), the patron saint of libraries. The sale is held in the plaza leading to the entrance of the library. In 2015 the sale was moved indoors for the first time in history on account of rain. The event the date falls on a weekend, the sale is held on the prior Friday. Since 1993 the library has organized and held an annual Reading of the Sacred Text event. Each year the library invites scholars to read and reflect on various oral and written stories to draw parallels between religion and the everyday world. Scholars have spoke on both Eastern and Western religions and focused on topics including: feminism, sciences, arts, slavery, and history. The Library houses regular art exhibits on its upper and lower levels. Displays have range from modern paintings to ancient artifacts. Exhibitions are generally on display for 4‚Äì6 months.

It is located on Io's trailing hemisphere at A large, tall volcanic plume has been observed at Pele by various spacecraft starting with Voyager 1 in 1979, though it has not been persistent. The discovery of the Pele plume on March 8, 1979 confirmed the existence of active volcanism on Io. The plume is associated with a lava lake at the northern end of the mountain Danube Planum. Pele is also notable for a persistent, large red ring circling the volcano resulting from sulfurous fallout from the volcanic plume. Observations =Voyager= Mosaic of images taken by Voyager 1 of Pele (above right of center) and its filamentary volcanic plume As Voyager 1 approached the Jupiter system in March 1979, it acquired numerous images of the planet and its four largest satellites, including Io. One of the most distinctive features of these distant images of Io was a large, elliptical, footprint-shaped ring on the satellite's trailing hemisphere (the side facing away from the direction of motion in a synchronously-rotating satellite like Io). During the encounter itself on March 5, 1979, Voyager 1 acquired high-resolution images of the footprint-shaped region. At the center of bow tie-shaped dark region in the middle of the ring was a depression partially filled with dark material, by in size. This depression, later found to be the source of the Pele volcano, is at the northern base of a rifted mountain later named Danube Planum. With the other dramatic evidence for volcanic activity on the surface of Io from this encounter, researchers hypothesized that Pele was likely a caldera. On March 8, 1979, three days after passing Jupiter, Voyager 1 took images of Jupiter's moons to help mission controllers determine the spacecraft's exact location, a process called optical navigation. While processing images of Io to enhance the visibility of background stars, navigation engineer Linda Morabito found a tall cloud along the moon's limb. At first, she suspected the cloud to be a moon behind Io, but no suitably sized body would have been in that location. The feature was determined to be a volcanic plume tall and wide, generated by active volcanism at Pele. Based on the size of the plume observed at Pele, the ring of reddish (or dark as it appeared to Voyager's cameras, which were insensitive to red-wavelengths) material was determined to be a deposit of plume material. Following this discovery, seven other plumes were located in earlier Voyager images of Io. Thermal emission from Pele detected by the Voyager 1 Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) detected a thermal hotspot at Pele, indicative of cooling lava, further indicating that volcanic activity at the surface was linked to the plumes observed by Voyager 1. When Voyager 2 flew through the Jupiter system in July 1979, its imaging campaign was modified to observe Io's plumes in action and to look for surface changes. Pele's plume, designated Plume 1 at the time as it was the first of Io's volcanic plumes to be discovered, was not seen by Voyager 2 four months later. Surface monitoring observations revealed changes with the red ring surrounding Pele. While it was heart- or hoofprint-shaped during the Voyager 1 encounter, it was now more elliptical with the notch in the southern part of the plume deposit now filled in, possibly due to changes in the distribution of plume sources within the Pele patera. Following the Voyager encounters, the International Astronomical Union officially named the volcano after the Hawaiian volcano goddess, Pele, in 1979. =Galileo and beyond= Infrared image showing night-time thermal emission from the lava lake Pele Galileo arrived at the Jupiter system in 1995 and, from 1996 to 2001, regularly monitored volcanic activity on Io through observations of Io's thermal emission at near-infrared wavelengths, imaging Io while it was in the Jupiter's shadow in order to look for thermal hotspots at visible and near- infrared wavelengths, and imaging Io during most orbit in order to detect changes in the appearance of diffuse material and lava flows on the surface. Thermal emission from Pele was detected in nearly every occasion Io's trailing hemisphere was imaged while the moon was in the shadow of Jupiter. The volcanic plume at Pele was found to be intermittent or primarily composed of gas with occasional bursts of increased dust content. It was detected only twice by Galileo in December 1996 and December 2000. In these two detections, the plume height varied from to . The plume was also detected by the Hubble Space Telescope in October 1999 while Galileo was conducting a flyby of the moon. The Hubble observations allowed for the detection of diatomic sulfur (S2) for the first time on Io in Pele's plume. Subtle changes in the shape and intensity of the large red-ring plume deposit surrounding Pele were observed in daylight images of the volcano, with the most notable change seen in September 1997 when dark pyroclastic material from an eruption of Pillan Patera covered up a portion of Pele's plume deposit. During Galileo's encounters with Io between October 1999 and October 2001, the spacecraft observed Pele on three occasions using its camera and infrared spectrometers while the volcano was on Io's night-side. The cameras revealed a curved line of bright spots along the margin of the Pele patera (a term used for volcanic depressions on Io, akin to calderas). Within the east-west dark band along the southeastern portion of the patera, a large amount of thermal emission was observed, with temperatures and distribution consistent with a large, basaltic lava lake. Thermal emission at Pele was also seen in December 2000 by the Cassini spacecraft, in December 2001 from the Keck Telescope in Hawaii, and by the New Horizons spacecraft in February 2007. Physical characteristics =Lava lake= Highest resolution image of Pele taken by Voyager 1 in March 1979 Pele has a volcanic crater, also known a patera, by in size, which lies at the base of the northern tip of the mountain Danube Planum. The patera has multiple floor levels, with a higher north-eastern section and a lower section that consists of an east-west-trending graben. Volcanic activity at Pele, as seen in images taken by Galileo in October 2001 while Pele was on Io's night side, appears to be limited to small thermal \\"hot-spots\\" along the margins of the patera and a more intense thermal emission source within a dark area in the southeast portion of the patera floor. This distribution of activity, combined with Pele's stability as a hotspot in terms of temperature and power emitted, suggests that Pele is a large, active lava lake, a combination of eruption style and intensity of activity not seen elsewhere on Io. The small hotspots seen in the Galileo data represent areas where the crust of the lava lake breaks up along the margins of the patera, allowing fresh lava to become exposed at the surface. The southeastern portion of the patera, an area of dark terrain in Voyager 1 imagery, is the most active region of the Pele volcano, with the most extensive region of hot lava at Pele. This area is thought to be a vigorously overturning lava lake, suggestive of a combination of a large mass flux of lava to the lake from a magma reservoir below the surface and a large mass fraction of dissolved volatiles like sulfur dioxide and diatomic sulfur. Given Pele's brightness at near-infrared wavelengths, activity at this portion of the lava lake may also result in lava fountaining. Lava temperatures measured using the near-infrared emission spectrum of thermal hotspots observed at Pele are consistent with silicate basaltic lava erupting at the lava lake. The measurements from Galileo and Cassini images of Pele suggest peak temperatures of at least 1250‚Äì1350 ¬∞C, while the near- infrared spectrometer on Galileo found peak temperatures of 1250‚Äì1280 ¬∞C. While Pele's energy output and temperature remained consistent on the timescale of months to years throughout much of the Galileo missions, measurements of Pele's brightness using Cassini data taken during an eclipse of Io by Jupiter found considerable variations on the timescale of minutes. This is consistent with variations in the distribution and size of lava fountains at Pele over that timeframe. =Plume= Pele's plume is the archetypal Pele-type plume: tall, producing a large reddish deposit that is concentric around the source vent. The plume is created from the degassing of sulfur (S2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from erupting lava in the Pele lava lake. The persistence of degassed sulfurous compounds to Pele's plume is likely from a stable and consistent magma supply to its lava lake, which could be the largest magma chamber of Io's volcanoes. Images of the plume taken by Voyager 1 revealed a large structure without a central column like the smaller, Prometheus-type plumes, but instead having a filamentary structure. This morphology is consistent with a plume that is formed by sulfurous gases erupted skyward from the Pele lava lake, which then condense into solid S2 and SO2 when they reach the shock canopy along the outer edge of the umbrella- shaped plume. These condensed materials then are deposited onto the surface, forming a large, red, oval-shaped ring around the Pele volcano. The oval shape of the deposits, elongated in roughly the north-south direction, may be the result of an east-west, linear source region, consistent with the shape and orientation of the graben that forms the southern and more active portion of the Pele patera. Variable activity in different portions of the Pele lava lake may also result in the changes in brightness and shape of the plume deposit over time observed by various spacecraft.

It was the first Greek success against Ibrahim and saved the city of Nafplion, seat of the government, from capture. Before the conflict After the Greek army (led by Theodoros Kolokotronis) fled to Karitena, Ibrahim's forces captured Tripolitsa, which was completely abandoned. Immediately afterwards, Ibrahim sent 5,000 soldiers to the plains of Argos in order to seize Nafplion. When Ibrahim's forces reached the Mills of Lerna on June 24, Captain Makrygiannis and Minister of War Metaxas organized a resistance force containing 350 Greek soldiers.Paparigopoulos, K, History of the Greek Nation (Greek edition), vol. 6, p. 62 General Demetrios Ypsilantis, Konstantinos Mavromichalis, Panagiotis Rodios and several philhellenes (such as Fran√ßois Graillard and Heinrich Treiber) volunteered in the defense of the garrison.Finlay, p. 78-79 The position was weak and they were very few compared to Ibrahim's army. Thus many were eager to leave using their horses or by fish boats but Makriyannis made sure all horses and fish boats were gone in secret. This made everybody more resolute in defending the position and they started digging trenches. Admiral De Rigny watched from aboard the helplessness of the Greeks and advised Makriyannis against defending the position but Makriyannis ignored him by saying: \\"They are many indeed but we few have decided to die and have God on our side... And when the few decide to die, most times win... And if we die today we will die for our country and our religion and this death is a good one\\". \\"Tres bien\\" replied De Rigny.According to Makriyannis' Memoirs Battle The battle began at June 24th 1825. Protecting Lerna was vital since the mills contained large quantities of grain that supplied food to Nafplion. The mills of Lerna were surrounded by a stone wall that was flanked by a deep pond and a marsh. Moreover, the garrison was supported by two gunboats that were anchored a short distance (or \\"musket-shot distance\\") from the shore. Unfortunately, the Greeks did not repair a small break in the stone wall. As a result, a small contingent of Arabs exploited this weakness in the defensive structure and attempted to create an entrance by increasing the size of the break. When the Arabs forced themselves through the break, they were prevented from regrouping once they entered the courtyard. Thirteen Arabs were killed by a charge of Greeks and philhellenes led by Makrygiannis. Ultimately, the remaining Arabs in the overall contingent were forced to flee. The Greeks, afterwards, attempted to fill in the gap in the stone wall. Same time, 50 warriors under the command of Mitros Liakopoulos arrived at the battle to help the defenders.According to Makriyannis Despite the constant reinforcements he received, Ibrahim was aware of the fact that the Greeks were prepared to staunchly defend the Lerna Mills and he eventually retreated to the plains of Argos. From there, Ibrahim took his army to Tripolitsa on June 29, 1825. The Egyptian casualties, according to Sp. Trikoupis, reached 50 dead men. As long as the Egyptian forces were repelled successfully, some French naval officers came ashore and congratulate Makriyannis. He was indeed that day the heart of the defenders in Myloi and he was eager to help wherever there was need. Thus he was shot in the right hand from musket fire but kept it secret until the end of the battle. He claims he was recognized by some of Ibrahim's shooters that remembered him from Neokastro.According to Makriyannis He was taken to the French frigate of Admiral De Rigny to be treated afterwards.According to Makriyannis See also *List of battles References Sources *Finlay, George.

An indicator is that in 2014, 65.6% of the population aged 15 years and above were employed.Asian Development Bank. (n.d.). Poverty in Malaysia. Retrieved 21 November 2016 from https://www.adb.org/countries/malaysia/poverty History After Malaysian independence, significant chunks of the Malaysian economy were controlled by British colonial firms. Second economically to these monopolies were small- scale retail enterprises run by the Malaysian Chinese and small-scale moneylending businesses run by a few Malaysian Indians. After the 13 May Incident in 1969, where racial rioting broke out in the federal capital of Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP) was initiated. Its purpose was to narrow the disparities in wealth between the Malay and non- Malay communities in the country through aggressive affirmative action and state intervention in the economy.Musa, pp. 122‚Äì123. It has been suggested that although the NEP was initially successful in achieving its goal of reducing the economic gap between different communities in the country, its politicisation in the 1990s and 2000s (decade) hampered its implementation; during this period, intraethnic economic inequity amongst the Malays reportedly increased. Anecdotal evidence has been used to suggest that rural Malay communities have not been significantly uplifted economically by the NEP.Musa, p. 123. As the country modernised, new forms of poverty appeared; one such problem was that of urban poverty. Economic development has been named as the cause of poverty amongst \\"single female headed households, the rural elderly, unskilled workers and migrant workers\\" by a local economist. The United Nations Development Programme has praised Malaysia for its reportedly successful poverty reduction programmes. Officially: However, in 2019, UN disputed the poverty figures released by Malaysia. Malaysia stated that its poverty figures was down to 0.4% in 2016 when compared to 49% in 1970. This is because Malaysia defined poverty as household income per month less than RM 980. However, UN officials argued that Malaysia has set the poverty line too low and household income more than RM 980 but less than RM 2000 are in fact under the poverty category also. The UN also stated that realistic poverty rate in Malaysia is from 16% to 20%. However, Malaysia stand firm of its claim while pointing that the UN assertions are incorrect.

It stars Alyssa Milano and had its world premiere at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival in 2007. Additionally, the film was selected by Nanni Moretti to screen at the 2007 Torino Film Festival, in Turin, Italy. The Blue Hour takes place in Los Angeles and follows four strangers whose lives cross paths, unaware of the ties that bind them together. Plot Several strangers in Los Angeles weave their stories of loss and hope, not knowing that their lives have brushed up against each other's in small but sometimes profound ways. A multi-ethnic ensemble drama, the film explores the connections between a Mexican graffiti muralist, an Armenian camera repairman, an African-American blues guitarist and an English pensioner living near the Los Angeles River. Happy is a talented teenage graffiti muralist with a passion for spray paint and hip hop. Her playground is the concrete banks of the Los Angeles River. While painting a mural of her trademark Payasa, a sad-faced Lady Clown, she encounters Sal, a mentally challenged homeless man who attempts to make contact with her. Unable to communicate with Happy, Sal then crosses paths with Avo, a vintage camera repairman living with his wife Allegra on the East Bank of the river. Their apartment overlooks Happy‚Äôs Payasa mural near the area where their four-year- old daughter Heidi recently drowned. Since Heidi‚Äôs death, Avo and Allegra have not spoken. As Happy toils on the Payasa, Avo attempts to reconcile with his wife in the wake of the family tragedy. A block away from Avo‚Äôs apartment, Ridley is a struggling blues guitarist staying in an old hotel by the river. He has returned temporarily to Los Angeles to care for his mother. One night, Ridley hears an enigmatic voice coming from somewhere inside the hotel. Haunted by its mysterious presence, Ridley sets out to discover the source of the voice, running into Sal in the wake of a hit-and-run accident. Humphrey is an aging pensioner living in an apartment overlooking the ‚Äòislands‚Äô in the river. One morning he wakes up to the sound of Sal screaming on the sidewalk. Having recently lost his wife Ethel, Humphrey spends his days eating lunch by her grave, a few feet from Heidi‚Äôs resting place where he sees Allegra. Unsure when his time will come, Humphrey readjusts to everyday life, crossing paths with Happy as he wanders the riverside neighborhood. Connecting each character peripherally through the Los Angeles River, The Blue Hour explores the delicate ties and common humanity among strangers in a seemingly disconnected landscape.

While he may be a fighting genius, he lacks common sense and any inhibitions whatsoever. He spends most of his time getting into trouble with school officials, and trying to steal girls' panties; especially Mayumi's. He is very protective of three things: his long hair, his panty collection, and Mayumi. * - Captain of the 7th Discipline Squad, Mayumi is K≈çtar≈ç's childhood friend and chief romantic interest. She's the only one who seems to be able to keep Koutarou in check. While she is nowhere near K≈çtar≈ç's level of strength, she is not a damsel in distress. She has got a good grip on the basics of both karate and judo. Mayumi also happens to be a member of the school's Decency League, much to K≈çtar≈ç's annoyance. * - A bald samurai who patrols the school as the enforcer of the Decency League. Early on, he appears to be an enemy of K≈çtar≈ç's, but as the series progresses the audience learns that he gradually changes into K≈çtar≈ç's main rival and best friend. He comes from a high class traditional family and has an iinazuke (fianc√© that his parents picked for him) named Sayoko. Being called \\"baldie\\" or \\"bald\\" drives him insane, since he insists that his head is not bald, but merely shaved. Very powerful, his fighting ability is on par with K≈çtar≈ç, arguably the one character in the series who is a true match for him. Though his chief ambition is fighting and defeating K≈çtar≈ç in a fair duel, they have never really fought each other on even terms, and it is implied that both of them actually do not want that fated duel to ever happen, because that would mean the end of their current friendship and relationship. After defeating a berserk and addled Tenkoji who was hypnotized by the mind-altering Kugutsu dance in the Japan Dome, K≈çtar≈ç himself stated sadly that \\"I don't want to lose to Tenkoji, but I don't want to win, either.\\" Recurring characters * - The current head Sensei of the Shind≈ç Karate Dojo. He is an extreme pervert that can perform many different tricks with his penis. He is one of the few people that has defeated K≈çtar≈ç. Ky≈çshir≈ç takes care of K≈çtar≈ç as if K≈çtar≈ç was his own brother, and possibly that K≈çtar≈ç looks him up the same. Ky≈çshir≈ç is currently in love with Tenzen Shikato's granddaughter, Yurie. * - A kung-fu expert and master of the nine- section staff. While he is very strong (possibly Kotaro's equal), he has a weakness around women (high pressure nosebleeds). He develops somewhat of a crush on Mayumi after saving her from some punks. His real name is . * - The vice head of the cheerleader squad who serve with an extreme loyalty to his leader, stand on almost the same level as Kenji and Tenk≈çji and one of the few who has fought one on one with kotaro. * - The old man who is the head of the Cheerleader Squad and the oldest (and at the size of a large cat, the smallest) student in the School, Tenzen is one of the top martial artist in the world, and the strongest character in the series, far stronger than even K≈çtar≈ç and Tenkoji. He is K≈çtar≈ç's sensei during the National Tournament, but dismissed him after he saw a better successor of his fighting technique. When Yurie, his granddaughter, asked why he no longer want to train K≈çtar≈ç, Tenzen's answer was that K≈çtar≈ç will be the one to surpass him, one day. Tenzen is also a pervert that perhaps surpasses even Kotaro. But even if he's distracted by some pervertial acts, he still could make rational decisions. Tenzen is also one of the richest men in Japan, owning from a TV station to a giant mansion with 1,000 bunny-ear wearing girls. He is also the founder of the infamous Snakebone Syndicate/Jakotsukai. * Jakotsukai Arc * - The student body president who will stop at nothing to see K≈çtar≈ç defeated and humiliated. He initially offers one million yen to the person who could cut K≈çtar≈ç's long hair. * and - The duo that frequently appears with Tenk≈çji. They are mainly there for comic relief. * - The leader of the powerful Judo Club and an enforcer of the Jakotsukai (Snake Bones Gang). He is sent by Beni Bara to test Kotaro's strength. *Beni Bara - The leader of the Jakotsukai and an extremely skilled fighter. She generally operates from behind the scenes, preferring to have others do her dirty work for her. She hides a great number of secrets, including one that K≈çtar≈ç manages to discover to his own horror. * - Captain of the First Discipline Squad. He is a sadist who likes wearing paramilitary uniforms and hitting people with his whip. His twin brother gouged out his eye when he was younger and he now hides a spring-loaded gag eyeball in its place. He is contracted by Tarako along with Tenk≈çji to defeat/maim/kill K≈çtar≈ç through whatever means possible. Princess Clara's Visit Princess Clara Anthony (The giant) Chris (The fake bodyguard) King Renaldo Fred (Prime Minister) War in D Block *Tatsuya Yoshioka - The newly appointed leader of the Decency League. Despite his bishounen looks and genius IQ he's a capable fighter. Tatsuya is the one who sends Kotaro into D Block to locate the Legacy of the Jakotsukai. He seems to have some hidden agenda. * - Tatsuya's younger sister who is first seen running from some punks in D Block. She decides to help Kotaro on his mission in D Block. She's rather headstrong, but a pretty good fighter as well. * - A worthless thug who attempts to pass himself off as K≈çtar≈ç in order to rule D Block. After it backfires horribly he decides to become Kotaro's underling instead. His real name is never mentioned, and K≈çtar≈ç simply calls him 'Nisemono'(lit.

When Kotaro rescues him from starvation he decides to become his underling as well. * - The ruthless leader of the Cyclops gang and Shunpei Sadoya's twin brother. Where Shunpei's left eye is missing, Ry≈´hei has a severely disfigured right eye. He is far more skilled than his brother; using two whips simultaneously with far greater effect. He is incredibly sadistic and is prone to vomiting when hearing people talk about things like love and friendship.

World War I The Tenth Army, first called d√©tachement d'arm√©e Maud'huy, was formed on 1 October 1914 during the Race to the Sea. It gained a victory in the Battle of Arras (1914). Later, it took part in the Second Battle of Artois (May 1915), the Third Battle of Artois (September 1915), the Battle of the Somme (July 1916), and the Second Battle of the Aisne (April 1917). In October 1917, at the request of the Italian Supreme Commander, General Luigi Cadorna, the Tenth Army moved onto the Italian Front alongside British Expeditionary Force units, together forming the Italian Expeditionary Force. For this operation the army included the 12th Army Corps and the 31st Army Corps, for a total of six infantry divisions of French troops. The Italians had been pushed back at the Battle of Caporetto by German Army reinforced Austro-Hungarian divisions. French forces were settled mostly west of the city of Verona, supposedly to counter a rumoured offensive by Austro-Hungarian forces that would purportedly come from the County of Tyrol via the Adige river valley.La Grande Guerra: The Allies Post-Caporetto Support of Italy On 26 March 1918, the Tenth Army returned to France, where it fought in the Third Battle of the Aisne, Second Battle of the Marne and the Hundred Days Offensive. The two divisions of 12th Army Corps under command of Jean C√©sar Graziani remained in Italy until the end of the war. Interwar Period After the Armistice it was part of the occupation of the Rhineland. On 21 October 1919 it was combined with the Eighth Army to form the French Army of the Rhine. World War II It was reformed in the Second World War. A first Tenth Army is disbanded between 7 and 8 June 1940, with on the one hand the encirclement of the 9th Army Corps at Saint-Val√©ry-en-Caux and on the other hand the attachment of the 10th and 25th Army Corps to the Arm√©e de Paris. After the rupture of the Somme front, on 5 et 6 June 1940, the last phase of the Battle of France begins. For the Allies it is essential to regroup on the Seine river to prevent the Germans from crossing. This is why a new 10th Army is formed to hold the front at the Lower Seine and is placed under command of General Robert Altmayer (1875 - 1959). His troops were not yet in place when the Germans appeared at the Seine on 9 June and immediately crossed it in the Portejoie, Saint-Pierre-du-Vauvray and Venables sector. The Weygand Line had been broken.

History The Fresh Film Fest is a successor of the CILECT festival that took place in Karlovy Vary during the 1980s, initially as an independent festival and subsequently as part of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (KVIFF). Over the years the CILECT festival was attended by filmmakers including Jan Svƒõr√°k and Emir Kusturica. Fresh Film Festival was founded in 2004 by three students from the Film and TV School of The Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU), as a competitive showcase of student films in the Czech Republic. The organizing team, consisting mostly of students from FAMU, presents public screenings of over 250 mainly student films each year, from various countries and genres. Format Fresh Film Fest is the largest international student film competition in the so-called Visegrad region (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland). It is held over five days at the end of August and beginning of September, during which time around 300 works of student cinematography from around the world are shown across six cinema halls, as well as feature- length film screenings and music concerts. The festival screens an array of Central and Eastern European student films focused on the Visegrad Group countries. This section has been broadened to present work from across the whole Eastern European region. The festival also maintains contact with high- profile film schools including the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow, La F√©mis in Paris, FAMU in Prague, the National Film and Television School in England, and Columbia University in New York, as well as showing student films from areas less well-known for film, such as Ecuador, Hong Kong, and Cuba. Fresh Film Fest usually opens its call for entries at the beginning of January and ends on April 30. Each year since 2006, the festival has honoured one figure in international film by screening a retrospective program of all their films. One of those honoured in this way was Corneliu Porumboiu, a participant in the first Fresh Film Fest competition and winner of the Camera d'Or (Golden Camera) at the Cannes Film Festival. The festival is accompanied by a program of other activities and events, including professional workshops and seminars, school presentations and evening parties. The festivals juries are made up of film industry figures who award prizes for the best work. Fresh Film Fest is a partner event of the KVIFF, with overlapping organizing teams, and originates from the expansion of its Student Films section. As a result, Fresh Film Fest can take advantage of many facilities used during KVIFF, including a 1000-capacity cinema hall, and five other cinemas, as well as the festival club scene and several lounge rooms.  Staff  The members of the juries are mostly younger film-makers. The members of the pre-selection committees are program directors of various international film festivals such as Anifest, Prague's Febiofest, or the program managers of KVIFF and the Institute of Documentary Film. The festival organisers have received awards for the festival itself, including two FAMU awards. The director of the second Fresh Film Fest trailer, Jakub Koh√°k, was awarded third prize for Best Trailer at the Czech advertising awards, \\"Lousk√°ƒçek\\". The second Fresh Film Fest visual concept created by art director Ad√©la Svobodov√° was awarded at the International Biennale of Graphic Design in Brno. The third Fresh Film Fest visual concept, created by the same author along with graphic designer Pauline Kerleroux, was awarded an Ogilvy CID Prize for Best Corporate Design in 2006, chosen by a jury of Czech graphics professionals and critics.

They were two-bay biplanes of conventional configuration with greatly uneven span. Two single-seat examples, powered by a single 150 hp (110 kW) Sunbeam water-cooled engine, were ordered by the RNAS in early 1916. This was soon followed by orders for two modified aircraft for the Royal Flying Corps. These were fitted with seats for a crew of two and had more powerful (225 hp/168 kW) Sunbeam engines The first of the two-seaters was designated 519A to reflect its modifications. The second two- seater, however, was so different that it received a completely new number from Avro - 522 - and featured new wings with both upper and lower wings of equal but greater span, in the hope that this would rectify the type's poor climbing performance. Never used operationally, all four were used for flight testing with the last still in service in April 1917. There are some indications that the Avro 522A formed part of the equipment of 2 Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force in the 1920s.

Club career =Early years= Nsaliwa was born in Lilongwe, Malawi. He moved to Edmonton some years after he played for local youth side Edmonton Southwest United. Apparently this was the first boys team in club history to advance to the Under-15 National Championships, finishing fourth in the competition. He then played for Edmonton North West United and represented the Alberta Soccer Association in all its subsequent youth select teams before moving to Germany at the age of 16. =Germany= He moved to Germany where he played for the Energie Cottbus youth program for one season, returned to Canada for one year and then back again to Germany to sign with Second Division outfit N√ºrnberg. While he only played a minor part, he won the league title to clinch promotion to the Bundesliga. However, unhappy in N√ºrnberg, he moved on to Saarbr√ºcken and carried on to play on the second level for five more years, including one season at SSV Jahn Regensburg. He would go on to relinquish his Canadian citizenship to become a citizen of Germany (where he spent seven years) in 2007 to avoid local rules limiting the number of non-EU internationals permitted in a team. =Greece= In 2006, he was lured to Greek Super League side Panionios by their new German manager Ewald Lienen and enjoyed his first season of top league football. In his first and only season at the club, as co-captain, he would go on to help them place fifth in the league ranking and thus securing a UEFA Cup position for the following year for only the second time in the club's history. He did this with his second goal of the season on the final day of the season against local giants AEK Athens. Prior to the match it had been publicly speculated that he had already signed for AEK in that mid season, although he was also being publicly courted but the two other Greek Football giants Olympiacos F.C. and Panathinaikos FC. Some days after that game he went on to announce that he would join AEK on a three-year contract. =AEK Athens= In his first season at AEK FC, Nsaliwa would quickly win the affections of AEK supporters with his performance against Sevilla F√∫tbol Club in the 2007‚Äì08 UEFA Champions League Qualifying stage playing alongside Champions League Runner up Akis Zikos and World Cup Champion Rivaldo. Although AEK did not advance he was singled out as a shining player for the team in the series and expectations had been placed on him based on it. That season the club would be crowned \\"The Unofficial Champions of Greece\\" after a disputed Championship won by Olympiacos FC. The championship was handed to Olympiacos after the Greek Football Federation found an Austrian player(Vagner) from Apollon Kalamarias had played a game against the club illegally and thus awarded Olympiacos the three points that would subsequently take them two points above AEK FC and elude the club of yet another championship after 13 years. In his first UEFA cup season with AEK, Nsaliwa went on to score the lone goal against FK Mlad√° Boleslav that subsequently saw AEK advance to the knock-out stage. Despite losing the following game to Villarreal Club de F√∫tbol at home, the goal proved to be the difference in AEK moving on to the next round. He would also go on to receive MVP of the last game of the season against Panathinaikos FC with a long range goal that tied the game at 1‚Äì1. The following season, after a personally very bad start, again Nsaliwa would play a major role in AEK's third-place finish to the season as well as be a part of the \\"Game of the Century\\" in the Greek cup final against Olympiacos FC. The match would go on to end 3‚Äì3, lasted more than three hours with two extra times and 19 penalty shots, with Nsaliwa scoring both of his, but AEK FC losing the game. Nsaliwa's third season at AEK started and ended questionably. Struggling with playing time and injuries, it was discovered at mid-season that he had a falling out with the head coach of the club Dusan Bajevic and he would go on to state in Greek news \\"I played a major role in the last four games before the Christmas break and then when I returned I never trained with the team again.\\" No insight has been given as to exactly what happened, but after an unsuccessful transfer period in which he refused to join several other Greek teams, Romanian club Rapid Bucure≈üti and was speculated to have interest from a Premier League club, Nsaliwa signed a loan contract with the Norwegian top flight club Lillestr√∏m SK, a month after the end of the 2009‚Äì10 winter transfer period, which was to last until June 2010. Before leaving, there was speculation in Greek news that the president of AEK tried to stop the loan transfer and have Nsaliwa stay, but it was later made clear that there was no relationship left between the player and coach. AEK would go on to write on its website \\"AEk FC would like to thank Tamandani Nsaliwa for his services to the club and wish him the best of luck in his future career.\\" =Spain= After a rather mediocre loan spell in Norway, Nsaliwa was said to have signed for Spanish football side Real Betis Balompi√©. With the public backing of current Vice President of RCD Mallorca, former Betis coach and a former coach of Nsaliwa at AEK, Lorenzo Serra Ferrer. Although it is not well known what happened in the time Nsaliwa was in Seville to finish the agreement, according to the official website of Real Betis, it was stated that \\"Nsaliwa will not play in the club because there was no economic agreement between both parties.\\" After this, the player decided to sue the club for the amount he claimed was the agreed contractual sum of 900,000 Euros. After six months of being without a club, in January 2011 he went on to sign for SD Ponferradina in the Spanish Second Division. =Denmark= On 16 April 2012, it was announced that Nsaliwa had signed with Esbjerg fB of the Danish 1st Division until 30 June 2012. International career Nsaliwa played at the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship in Argentina, alongside Julian De Guzman and Mike Klukowski among others. He made his senior debut for Canada in an April 2001 LG Cup match against Egypt and earned a total of 13 caps, scoring no goals. He has not yet represented Canada in FIFA World Cup qualification matches but did play a game at the 2001 Confederations Cup and three at the 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup. His last full international game for Canada was played against the Brazil national football team at Qwest Field in Seattle on 31 May 2008. Personal life Although he represented the Canada men's national soccer team at full international level, he renounced his Canadian citizenship to become a citizen of Germany in 2007 to avoid local rules limiting the number of non-EU internationals permitted in a team. On June 14, 2020 he released the song \\"Sklira\\", in honor of the new stadium of his former club AEK Athens. The song got over 90,000 views on YouTube within 3 days.

At right, the West Kong Yick Building is undergoing renovation, hence the scaffolding. The East Kong Yick Building () is one of two buildings erected in Seattle, Washington's Chinatown-International District (ID) by the Kong Yick Investment Company (the other being the West Kong Yick Building). A four-story hotel in the core of the ID, with retail stores at ground level, the East Kong Yick was created by the pooled resources of 170 Chinese American pioneers. In, 2008, the building reopened as the home of the expanded Wing Luke Asian Museum. Kong Yick Investment Company Looking up the main staircase of the museum into a space that was originally an unroofed \\"light well\\" between upper sections of the building. In 1910 Goon Dip, a prominent businessman in Seattle's Chinese American community, led a group of Chinese American pioneers to form the Kong Yick Investment Company. [The name of the company, Kong Yick (ÂÖ¨Áõä)See Kong Yick business records loosely means \\"mutual benefit.\\"] With no financial backing from a bank, the investment company pooled money from approximately 170 Chinese American community members to fund the construction of two twin buildings that would serve as the anchor of a \\"new\\" Chinatown. Members of the investment company lived not only in Seattle but throughout the Pacific Northwest, making the Kong Yick Buildings a landmark for the Chinese community. Notable businesses Chin Chun Hock, who arrived in Seattle in 1860, established the Wa Chong Company (ËèØÊòå, \\"Chinese Prosperity\\") in 1868 with partner Woo Gen. The company recruited labor and imported goods from East Asia. When Chinatown relocated to its current location, Wa Chong reopened at 717 King St., now (2010) the Welcome Hall in the new Wing Luke Asian Museum. Next door, Chin Gee Hee operated the Quong Tuck Company, another of the multi-purpose mercantiles selling wholesale and retail import goods, as well as supplying contract labor to canneries, mills and other industrial concerns. Since 2008 the former location of Quong Tuck houses the reconstructed Yick Fung Mercantile exhibit. The Yick Fung Company (ÁõäË±êËôü) formerly operated at 705 King St in the West Kong Yick Building from 1910 to 2008. Freeman Hotel In addition to the blooming Chinese population, Japanese and Filipino laborers migrated to Seattle in search of work. They found the most affordable and convenient places to stay in Chinatown single room occupancy hotels. The top two floors of the East Kong Yick Building comprised the Freeman Hotel, home to many of these itinerant workers from the canneries, lumber mills, construction sites, farms, restaurants and hand laundries. Family associations Bricked-over windows on the south fa√ßade of the building. Distinct balconies with elaborate decorations adorned with Chinese characters may be found on the north side of the East Kong Yick. While some of the balconies in the ID mark business fraternities, others signify family associations. These are community organizations based on family surnames that are derived from one's family's \\"home\\" village in China. The Kong Yick as well as other buildings in the area housed a number of family associations. Family associations were the first social \\"community centers\\" in Chinatown/ID. The associations were not just social organizations but also provided social services, helping new immigrants adjust to their new lives in America. Many would turn to these family associations to find work, health care and a place to live. The East Kong Yick Building housed the Gee How Oak Tin family association, the Lee Family Association and others. Since 2008, the former Gee How Oak Tin family association meeting hall is open to the public as an exhibit in the Wing Luke Asian Museum. Additionally, the Luke Family Association maintains meeting space in the museum. Family apartments Former storefronts converted to apartments along Canton Alley (between the Kong Yick Buildings) served as home to many families in Chinatown. While outsiders often stigmatized Chinatown alleyways as mysterious and dangerous places, many current and former Chinatown residents recall childhood memories of playing in the alleyways. Some of the apartment units remained occupied until 2005. Since 2008, Canton Alley Apartment #6, restored to its 1950s appearance, serves as an exhibit in the Wing Luke Asian Museum. Preserving the immigrant experience In May 2008 the East Kong Yick Building reopened as the new, expanded Wing Luke Asian Museum. Historic apartments, stores and social clubs are preserved as lasting testament to the courage and pioneering spirit of the immigrants. Spaces in the new museum document and share the experience of the thousands of Asians and Pacific Islanders who worked and lived in the United States. Seattle's Chinatown-International District is the only place in the continental United States where Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Vietnamese and other settled together and built one neighborhood. By settling in the East Kong Yick, the Wing Luke Asian Museum hopes to help spur the preservation of other historic buildings in the International District and bring thousands of visitors to support the many neighboring shops and restaurants.

At its northern (Alton) end, it joined with the Mid-Hants Railway to Winchester, the Alton Line to Brookwood and the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway. At Fareham it linked with the Eastleigh to Fareham Line, the West Coastway Line and the line to Gosport. The railway was authorised in 1896 and opened in 1903, making it one of the last railways of any size to be built to main-line standards in the United Kingdom. Passenger services were withdrawn after 5 February 1955, and the line was closed completely on 13 August 1968. Background A large brick over-bridge south of West Meon. Note the underside of the arch is faced with stone, and that the bridge is wide enough to accommodate double track- all evidence of the impressive mainline standards to which the MVR was built. There were several plans for railways in the Meon Valley in the middle and late 19th century. The Meon Valley formed one of the most direct routes from London to Portsmouth, but the original South Western Main Line went via Basingstoke because of a planned connection with another line heading towards Bristol. * 1851 ‚Äì The Alton & Petersfield Railway was proposed. It would have run from Alton to Petersfield, with another line from Petersfield to Havant and a third from Petersfield to Fareham. * 1864 ‚Äì The LSWR was actually granted an Act of Parliament to build a line from Ropley on the Mid-Hants Railway through West Meon and Warnford, before joining with the still-proposed Petersfield-Bishop's Waltham Line. * 1881 ‚Äì The Windsor, Aldershot & Portsmouth Railway was proposed, which would run from Farnham westward to East Tisted, then down the Meon Valley to West Meon, where it would turn east over the South Downs through Hambledon before reaching the lines into Portsmouth at Cosham. This main-line railway would have required several gradients of around 1 in 80 and three long tunnels. The proposal had the support of the Army and the Royal Navy but failed to find financial backers and never progressed. * 1895 ‚Äì A proposal was put forward to build a line connecting the Basingstoke to Portsmouth at a cost of ¬£2,000,000. This was opposed by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) and the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. Had the line been built, it would have given the Great Western Railway access to Portsmouth. The bill was rejected in the House of Lords on grounds that it was too costly. The LSWR responded by promising to connect Alton with Basingstoke and Fareham. The Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway was built under the Light Railways Act 1896. It opened on 1 June 1901. The Meon Valley Railway was mentioned in 1895 when a farm at Soberton was advertised for sale. In 1896, a petition was put to the directors of the LSWR asking that a line be provided through the Meon Valley. A line from West Meon to Petersfield was included in the proposal. The necessary Act of Parliament for the construction of the Meon Valley Railway was quickly obtained, with the South Western (Meon Valley) Act receiving Royal Assent on 3 June 1897. The line had to be completed within five years, otherwise the Act would lapse. A contractor was hired to carry out the work: Relf & Son of Plymouth. The LSWR's chief engineer in charge of the works was W.R. Galbraith. Henry Byer was the resident engineer and T. P. Figgis was the line's architect for stations and other non-permanent way structures. Design When planning the construction of the railway, provision was made for upgrading the line to main-line standards, with a ruling gradient of 1-in-100 (1%), and only gentle curves. Stations would be constructed with long platforms capable of taking 10-coach trains. The earthworks were to be built to take a single track, but all bridges and tunnels were to be built to dual- track standards. If the line proved successful, it would be upgraded to full- length dual track. As constructed, only the stations had dual tracks, so they were the only places trains could pass each other on the line. The design of the MVR also made much use of grade separation to minimise the use of level crossings, which were coming to be seen as both dangerous and undesirable, especially on lines intended for faster services. Instead all public roads that crossed the route of the line were accommodated by road bridges over the railway or vice versa, even where this required extensive earthworks and realignment of roads (such as at Hedge Corner near Privett, and the site of Droxford station). There were still 19 level crossings on the line, but the majority of these were crossing points for footpaths, and the rest were for lightly used farm tracks, connecting tracts of land that had been cut in two by the construction of the railway. The LSWR's promotional material for the line showed the line as a direct London-Gosport route for express services. The trackbed of the railway south of Wickham, looking towards Knowle Junction. Due to the conflict between the requirement for gentle gradients and the hilly terrain of the Meon Valley, the line required some impressive engineering works, including two tunnels and a high viaduct at West Meon. The summit of the line was at Privett, some above sea level. As was not unusual, due to the constraints of the landscape, a few of the stations were some distance from the settlements they claimed to serve (especially Privett and East Tisted). At the time, several commentators pointed out that these stations were in fact much better placed to serve the large country houses in the area (Basing Park and Rotherfield Park respectively). This point was further emphasised by the naming of the stations. Stations were usually named after the parish they were built in, but the owner of Basing Park insisted the LSWR name the station Privett (instead of the intended name of 'West Tisted') after the much smaller village in the area, next to which his estate was sited. As befitting a railway built to full standards, the stations were impressive. With leanings towards the Arts and Crafts movement, the stations were built out of brick in a mock-Tudor style, with Portland Stone mullions and gables. The architecture included stained-glass door windows and tiled interiors. The lavatories were in outbuildings styled like Chinese pagodas. Goods yards were planned for Mislingford (mainly to serve a local pumping station) and Farringdon, and all the stations had goods sidings, an ornate corrugated iron goods shed and hand- operated cranes to allow parcels and goods to be picked up and dropped off as needed. East Tisted station, now used as a private home. All the stations on the Meon Valley Railway used identical buildings in a Tudor style. Access to the southern entrance of the West Meon tunnel is still possible,though obstructed by a large mound of earth. This is reached using a short walk from the small car park at the northern end of the former viaduct. 1970 south portal 1970 north portal Construction Construction began in 1898, with the first soil being cut just south-east of Farringdon. The first task was the laying out and excavating the cuttings to provide material for building up the embankments. The embankments, tunnels, rails, stations, bridges and other structures were then built, with the construction teams starting at the Alton end of the line and moving south. Initially the terrain was easy, with only minimal earth-moving required (considering that the majority of work was done by manual labour). The main problem was obtaining a water supply for both the men and the small steam locomotives used for hauling supplies, since the railway was passing along chalk soil. The further south the railway came, the more undulating the terrain became and greater works of civil engineering were required to maintain the strict gradient requirements of the railway. The line from Alton to Winchester Junction had been opened on 2 October 1865 and taken over by the LSWR in 1876. A wooden bridge had been provided over the Alton- Winchester road at the Butts. With the construction of the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway, and the MVR then being under construction, a double track girder bridge replaced the original wooden bridge in 1900. After the construction of Privett station, the contractors came to their biggest engineering work ‚Äì the Privett Tunnel. At in length, the tunnel was curved, so the centre of the tunnel was in total darkness. Steam shovels and horses were used to remove the spoil (the latter were lowered into the works down shafts). The ground the tunnel was being driven through was found to be solid enough but nevertheless the tunnel was lined, partially in brick, partially in concrete render.Board of Trade inspection by Major J W Pringle, Royal Engineers, 1903 A collapse in the tunnel trapped two navvies, James Owen and George Brown, the latter dying of suffocation. Owen managed to dig himself free with his pocket knife and was rescued after being trapped for over 53 hours. A second man, Richard Allen was killed after being run over by a wagon in the tunnel. These deaths caused some men to leave the works. Enough men left to make the contractors bring in two steam shovels and a traction engine, G. Harris and Son's Burrell 'Endurance', to speed up progress. The tunnel was built by two teams working from opposite ends, and when the two met they were less than an inch from their planned course. While in similar locations elsewhere viaducts have been constructed, large quantities of chalk spoil from the tunnels favoured an alternative solution between Privett and West Meon: consequently the railway was built on an embankment some high. This earthwork crossed the A272 road to Petersfield, which was accommodated by a short brick- lined tunnel through the embankment some long. A second tunnel was built on the approach to West Meon, but before the railway could reach the site of West Meon Station, it had to cross the River Meon itself, which at this point ran through a narrow but deep valley. An 8-arch concrete viaduct was planned, but the ground was not as strong as initial tests showed, and very soon after construction the foundations of the viaduct began to subside. A 4-arch iron design was used instead, with large chalk embankments on the approaches over the unstable ground. The viaduct dwarfed the surrounding village, standing over high. Despite being much lighter than the concrete design, the whole structure weighed over and cost ¬£10,000 to build (¬£692,000 today). It is rumoured that 2 partially complete arches of the original viaduct are buried within the northern embankment. The West Meon viaduct shortly after construction. The large embankments leading to the viaduct are obvious having not had time to grass over. Only the concrete pedestals for the pillars remain now. West Meon station was the only point on the line where trains could take on water. A deep artesian well was sunk into the hills east of the station and piped to a tank in the station's goods yard to supply a water column on each platform. West Meon was also chosen as the site of the temporary 'village' of wooden huts to provide accommodation for the navvies and their families. A smaller collection of huts had been built at Privett. Having crossed the Meon Valley, the railway then passed through easier country, gradually descending through means of a series of embankments and cuttings. The chalk soil supported many streams and rivulets, so at several key points the builders provided culverts or narrow bridges to provide drainage. The builders of the railway provided this skewed tunnel to allow the railway on its embankment to cross the River Meon north of Wickham. South of Droxford, the workers encountered the Reading Beds ‚Äì an area of clay and gravel that, as part of the larger Fareham Clay Beds, made the area a centre for brickmaking. However, the soil was highly unstable ‚Äì when wet it was almost liquid, whilst in the summer it was as difficult to work as concrete. Huge amounts of chalk soil excavated from the two tunnels were brought in to stabilise the trackbed and to build embankments, but throughout the life of the railway subsidence was a problem along this stretch. The clay soil also led to standing water and flooding during heavy rain, and a number large grilled drains were provided along the line between Mislingford and Knowle. The problem was so severe in a cutting just north of Wickham that a concrete retaining wall was needed to support the side of the cutting and to prevent flooding the cutting was deepened to allow the construction of foundations of large concrete blocks for trackbed, on top of which were piled bricks to allow drainage before the topsoil and ballast could be laid. To improve the stability of the track itself the section between Wickham and Droxford used concrete sleepers- an early adoption of these on a British railway. This iron bridge carried the railway over the River Meon at Wickham. The line then passed through the Forest of Bere before heading across the water-meadows at Wickham on an embankment. The embankment crossed the River Meon itself, requiring the river to be taken through a long brick skew tunnel. The embankment also effectively divided the village of Wickham in two, with two new bridges providing the only means of crossing under the railway. This remains the case today. Just south of Wickham, the Meon was crossed again on a steel bridge supported on 6 tubular steel pillars ‚Äì this was the second biggest bridge on the line after the West Meon Viaduct. The meandering course of the Meon, the constraints of the landscape and the railway's ruling gradient meant that the railway required 5 under-bridges within half a mile (1 kilometre), 3 to cross the Meon (including the steel bridge near Wickham station) and the 2 to cross roads in Wickham. Finally, the railway gradually dropped to the natural ground level to the south of Wickham, joining the Eastleigh to Fareham Line just north of the Knowle Hatches Viaduct. Trains from the Meon Valley then passed down this line and into a newly built platform at Fareham station. The construction of the MVR also included the building of a deviation line between Fareham and Knowle Junction to by-pass the Fareham Tunnel, which had suffered serious subsidence problems due to being built through the local clay beds. The tunnel frequently had to be closed for maintenance and shoring-up, so an alternative route was urgently required, especially given the anticipated increase in traffic caused by the new line. The double-track deviation line ran through the north of Fareham and to the west of the village of Funtley, re-joining the main line just south of Knowle Hospital. Construction of this line took place once the Meon Valley Railway was completed, starting in October 1904 and being completed in 1906. One of the brick and iron bridges needed to cross roads in the middle of Wickham. Notice how the brick uprights of the bridge extend outwards from the iron section of the bridge. This was to enable the truss of the bridge to be widened to accommodate double track. The total cost of the Meon Valley Railway, including the Fareham deviation line, was ¬£399,500, 2 shillings and 3 pence. This equates to about ¬£27.7 million at today's prices. In all, the navvies (only minimally assisted by mechanical equipment) moved of earth in the course of the works. Early history The various delays during construction (such as the need to re-design the West Meon Viaduct and the ongoing problems with stabilising the track through the clay beds) caused the LSWR to delay opening of the MVR by a year. There were further delays in installing the signalling equipment. The line finally opened on 1 June 1903. There were between 8 and 11 services a day, running 4- and 6-coach trains. London-Gosport services were hauled by Adams 'Jubilee' engines. The lighter Alton-Fareham trains were worked by Adams 'Radial' and Adams O2 Class tank engines (a 'Radial' hauled the first public train on the line). Twice a day the line was used by a London-Gosport fast express service, usually hauled by a Drummond T9 'Greyhound'. As was expected in such an agricultural region, the bulk of traffic came from shipping agricultural produce. On the MVR this included watercress, wheat, fruit (especially strawberries and apples), milk and cattle. The LSWR put on special market-day trains, with both passenger carriages and livestock cars, allowing farmers to accompany their livestock. There were local 'pick-up/set-down' goods services along the line, which called at every station to deliver and pick up any waiting goods. No shunting engines were stationed on the MVR, so the locomotive working the train had to uncouple at each station and marshal wagons into and out of the train as required- standard practice for a rural line. Heavier freight services were often powered by locomotives such as the Drummond 700 Class. West Meon Station shortly after the railway opened in 1903 looking south. The intricate wooden footbridge was removed in the 1920s. Local residents and businesses had high hopes for the railway. The 'Railway Inn' was built next to Droxford railway station in the hope of accommodating tourists and travellers. A public house was built next to Privett railway station named 'The Privett Bush'. Coal merchants did good business ‚Äì West Meon station employed no fewer than three different merchants, and one business supplied coal to 2 of the stations. Many local newspapers were impressed by the line's speed, the scale of its engineering works, the high standards of the stations and other structures and the beauty of the scenery it passed through. Then, as now, the link between the Meon Valley and the famous figures of Gilbert White and Jane Austen was made several times. Some papers wrote articles describing the route and its scenery in great detail, pointing out places of interest along the line, such as the hill fort at Old Winchester Hill. The Fareham Tunnel deviation line was opened, first as a single line from 2 October 1904 and onto which all 'up' traffic was diverted with the corresponding 'up' line through the tunnel (really tunnels plural) being taken out of use; then from September 1906 the second line was brought into use for all 'down' traffic, enabling the original route through the tunnel to be closed to allow major repairs that ultimately led to the existing tunnel being stripped out and new linings being built. The tunnel had already been subjected to an additional brick lining by the 1870s, causing special working instructions to be issued due to trains being significantly closer to the tunnel wall, and each other. With the tunnel alterations completed the track was relaid as a single bi-directional line, thus the eliminating the limited clearance problem, and reopened on 2 June 1907. Knowle Junction ceased to be a true junction as the original connection between the MVR and the Eastleigh to Fareham Line was removed, although it would appear that the signal box was still required as a block post on the new, diverted main line. The MVR now had a totally separate but parallel single-track line across Knowle Hatches Viaduct (which was widened to triple- track width) and through the tunnel to Fareham East signal box, where double track was regained on the approach to Fareham Station, although a third bi- directional line was laid on the 'down' side to bring MV passenger traffic into a bay platform on the eastern side of the station. Should the need have ever arisen to double the MVR it must be assumed that most, if not all traffic would have needed to use the deviation line. Fareham Station may even have needed to be expanded to cope with the extra traffic. As part of these works in 1907 a halt was built at Knowle Hospital to serve both it and the village of Funtley. This small station - little more than a platform and a shelter - became one of the first rural stations in Hampshire to be lit by electricity, since it took its power from the hospital's generators. Given the track layout as configured at the time, the halt was served only Meon Valley trains only but, following the reinstatement of Knowle Junction in 1921 (see below), certain trains on both routes used the stop. Unfortunately, the expected London through-traffic never materialised, and after only a few years the London to Gosport services were cut back. Similarly, the tourist traffic to Stokes Bay also failed to grow, with steamers preferring the more established ports at Portsmouth and Southampton. Even during the First World War, traffic was light compared to other lines, despite the line partly being built for military traffic. In fact, in 1915 the regular London traffic was suspended totally, and the services were never reinstated. From then on the MVR only handled regular traffic between Fareham and Alton. The only major troop movements were from local regiments. Droxford station had a brief moment in the public eye when Admiral Doveton Sturdee arrived at the station on his way to his nearby home after his victory in the Battle of the Falkland Islands in 1914. Occasionally special trains from other parts of the network used the line, and the MVR did see infrequent use as a 'spare' mainline during periods of high traffic such as the summer holiday season or Christmas. The most obvious signs of the railway not developing as expected were the series of changes made to the signalling arrangements in 1921. Privett signal box was effectively closed and the line was changed from being worked as a single- track main line to operating as a single-track branch line, with longer signal blocks and fewer passing loops (the 'down' platform at Privett was closed, the second line through the station now being only used for shunting). At the southern end the rail connections at Knowle Junction were relaid. This allowed trains from Fareham heading to Eastleigh to use both the original and the deviation lines but the layout of the junctions meant that MVR trains could still only use the original single-track route. The LSWR's concerns about holding up express traffic no longer applied as such trains were not regular users of the MVR anymore. Southern Railway The LSWR was merged into the Southern Railway in 1923. By then services had been reduced even further. There were now 6 or 8 services a day, mainly formed of 2- or 3-coach trains hauled by Drummond M7 tank engines, with T9s remaining for faster services. Goods services remained vital to the line, with a twice-daily service ‚Äì one trip south-bound and one north-bound. Wagons and trucks would be shunted into the train at the three goods yards by the locomotive. Winter of 1927 brought storms and heavy snowfall to the Meon Valley region. A special Waterloo- Gosport train running down the line at 5:40am on 27 December became stuck in a huge snowdrift near Tisted. Workmen took nearly a day to free the train and clear the line. Since the railway opened, there had been calls for a station at Farringdon, just south of Alton. A goods yard for loading agricultural produce was already sited there, and in 1930 a short wooden platform of one coach-length was built to serve the village. Requests for a similar platform and yard at Meonstoke were not acted on, although the planners of the line had allowed for the future construction of a yard at that location. A single section of rail, dug vertically into the ground, marked the possible site for such a yard until after the railway closed- it was finally removed in the 1960s. In 1931 a further down-grading of the MVR took place when the track at Butts Junction (the approach to Alton station) was re-laid. The signal box was removed and the MVR's direct connection with the Alton Line to London was removed, meaning that MVR trains now ran direct to a bay platform at Alton station. It also meant that trains could not run direct from the Alton Line to the Meon Valley as they had been able to- if this was required trains had to shunt from one line to the other. This change spelt the end of the MVR as an integrated part of the railway network- it was now simply handling stopping local traffic with none of the fast inter-city express traffic that the line was built to handle and that used the line in its early days. The Alton Line was converted to electric operation in 1937. It was decided that it was not viable to electrify the MVR, and with that decision went any realistic hope of the line being upgraded to the dual-track standards to which it was built (indeed, the railway would remain single-line for its whole existence). This period saw changes to the stock used on the MVR. The M7 tank engines remained the main type used, but goods services on the line was now being worked by types deemed redundant for main-line passenger working, such as a small number of Drummond L12s, which had been the LSWR's cutting-edge express locomotives when the line was built. T9s also began to be used for freight services and shunting. Some newly built types were used during the summer for heavy agricultural trains or tourist services to the coast, such as the Maunsell U-Class. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, rural lines such as the MVR were all coming under threat from rural bus services, and even goods services were being threatened by local lorry services. The bulk of passenger services were now being run by M7 tank engines with a 2-car 'push-pull' train (carriage sets where the locomotive can be controlled from the rearmost carriage, negating the need to turn the train). These trains looked decidedly lost against the long platforms designed to take up to 11-car expresses. The huge platforms were, in fact, deemed so unnecessary that at West Meon new access slopes were cut halfway along and a walkway constructed across the tracks- the remaining half of each platform was effectively abandoned and allowed to grass over. Wartime During the Second World War the line was yet again used lightly compared to other railways in the region (such as the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway). The only real change was an increase in goods traffic supplying the naval dockyard at Portsmouth. This saw new locomotive types running over the line, such as Drummond 700s and the distinctive Bulleid Q1s. Standard passenger services had a box van added to cope with the near-constant stream of parcels and luggage to and from Portsmouth. A few troop trains used the line late at night. In 1941 a special military freight train, hauled by a Drummond 700, was stabled for the night at Tisted, with the crew receiving instructions to stay with the engine and be ready to depart instantly in an emergency. Although unknown to both the locomotive crew and station staff, the train was carrying 48 mines. Despite this relatively light military traffic, the Meon Valley Railway did come under attack during the war. A Junkers Ju 88 dropped bombs at Droxford station during 1940. These missed the station building and tracks but destroyed two railway worker's cottages. The aircraft then dropped further bombs at Soberton, but these also missed the railway. The bomber then turned around and headed up the line to the West Meon Tunnel, and a single bomb was dropped at the northern portal. A direct hit was not achieved, but a short section of line, including several sleepers, was destroyed and a crater was left in the ballast. All trains were quickly halted and the line was repaired in a few days. A terrace of cottages near Wickham, built for railway workers. Despite what was, on the whole, a fairly quiet wartime career the MVR had a brief spell of intensive use during the build-up to D-Day when huge numbers of men and equipment had to be moved to the south of England, kept in readiness and finally transported to ports. Large numbers of Tanks were moved by rail to Mislingford goods yard where they were dispersed to numerous concrete hard- standings built in local lanes and fields for temporary storage. Mislingford was also the site of a temporary wooden platform to serve the large number of Canadian troops who were encamped in the Forest of Bere. The MVR had one crucial role to play in the D-Day operations. On 2 June 1944, Winston Churchill, the Prime Ministers of Canada and South Africa, William Lyon Mackenzie King and Jan Smuts, and other Allied leaders arrived in a special train at Droxford Station (the train was actually part of the Royal Train from the London, Midland & Scottish Railway) for a crucial meeting at the nearby HQ of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower the Supreme Allied Commander at Southwick House. The station possessed the longest siding in southern England (outside the railway works at Eastleigh) and was close to a deep cutting. If threatened by an air raid, the train could be pushed into the relative safety of the cutting. During this meeting, final decisions regarding the planning of Operation Overlord were made. A photograph of several of the 'World Leaders' (including Eisenhower) was used to spuriously claim that the meeting had taken place at Droxford itself. The picture has since been identified as Ascot railway station. In 1944 ‚Äì Around the time of the Allied leaders' meeting at Droxford, a proposal was made for the USATC to build a branch from Droxford to Southwick House. The success of the Allied invasion of Europe in 1944 meant that this plan was never carried out. Post-War and British Railways The Southern Railway was nationalised into British Railways in 1948. No immediate changes were made, with the standard 2-car 'push-pull' sets running around five services a day. However, the rise of private car ownership and a major shift of local goods traffic from rail to road saw the MVR become increasingly uneconomical to operate. Services were gradually run down. This led to even lower passenger numbers as the service became less and less frequent, and more people switched to using cars or buses. During the early 1950s, British Railways drew up its 'Modernisation Plan'. This mainly concerned itself with the planned withdrawal of steam locomotives and the electrification of its main trunk routes. However, the plan also listed several lines that could be closed either because they were redundant in a nationalised, competition-free network or because they were unsustainable to operate. The Meon Valley Railway fell into both these categories. Closure to Passengers The site of West Meon station today. The long platforms and large brick under-bridge over the station are still intact and clearly visible. After the last timetabled service on Saturday 5 February 1955 the Meon Valley Railway closed to passenger traffic. As is often the case, passenger numbers rocketed in the final weeks of operation, as people took a final ride on the railway. The closure was long before the 'Beeching Axe' of the 1960s, where many well-used but uneconomic railways were closed. There is little doubt that in 1955 the Meon Valley was unsustainable as a passenger railway. On the following day, Sunday, a special train called 'The Hampshireman', organised by a rail enthusiasts' group, ran along the full length of the line - the last train to do so. It was hauled by two T9s 'double-heading'. From Monday 7 February 1955 goods services were to continue with a once-a-day service from Fareham to Droxford only, and a similar service from the northern end only from Alton to Farringdon.  Severance of the route  The first of the new goods workings on the southern end of the line passed without comment; the next day was different: on Tuesday 8 February 1955 the train ventured beyond Droxford to West Meon, presumably to collect the last wagon(s) from the yard there, possibly to collect some reusable items from the station itself.Author and West Meon resident Ray Stone photographed a steel open wagon with, written in chalk on one end, the words \\"The last truck at West Meon Station\\". Sadly the photograph is undated so it cannot be confirmed if it was before or after 6 February 1955. On Saturday 12 February 1955 the train crew became even more adventurous and travelled over West Meon viaduct, through both tunnels, and past Privett station to East Tisted, again presumably for the same reason as Tuesday's escapade. There appeared to be no official sanction for these two excursions and soon afterwards stop blocks were erected just north of Droxford and south of Farringdon. However this was not the last time the rules would be bent. On 26 March 1955 the stop block at Farringdon was dismantled and a special train visited both Privett and East Tisted stations to recover, amongst other things, two concrete permanent way huts. Following this special working's retreat, the stop block was re-erected. These demi-official traffic movements had not escaped the attention of BR management, especially considering that all signal boxes north of Droxford had been closed, which suggests that someone had to have authorised the 'one-engine-in-steam' movements without the necessary Special Traffic Notices having been published in advance. It would appear that someone in actual authority decided to put a stop to this: at some point in 1955, the southernmost turnout at West Meon was deliberately damaged, not just dismantled, the toe of the pointwork with its interlocking appearing to have been lifted up, bent out of shape and dropped back onto the formation at an angle, well and truly scuppering any movements from the south and preventing any incursions from the north from being able to run round its train before heading back. Thus the Meon Valley Railway ceased to be a continuous route, not just officially, but in actuality.  Closure to Freight  By 1956 dismantling of the disused section of line had begun in earnest and this included the demolition of West Meon Viaduct. The huge iron bridge had a high scrap value and thus was one of the first structures to be taken down. It is fair to assume that if it had been built from concrete as originally planned it would probably still be standing. During the viaduct's demolition, it was found to be suffering from corrosion in several places which would have needed extensive and costly repairs in the near future if the railway were to remain open. This was seen as a further justification of the closure by some at BR. One of the concrete pedestals that supported the West Meon Viaduct, now heavily overgrown. The pressure on British Railways to cut costs was relentless throughout the 1960s and the southern section to Droxford was closed to all traffic on Sunday 30 April 1962. The last BR-scheduled passenger service on any part of the MVR had been the 'Solent Limited' railtour on 30 April 1961, a year to the day before closure of the southern section. A goods service to Farringdon was maintained until 5 August 1968, when the final part of Meon Valley Railway was closed to all traffic. Post- closure After the 1962 closure of the southern portion of the line, a Mr. Charles Ashby purchased Droxford station and the right to run trains over the railway. He used it for testing a design of railbus that he had developed called the Sadler Rail Coach or 'Pacerailer'. Like the similarly named British Rail 'Pacer' of later years, this was essentially a bus-style vehicle. Unlike the later BR types, the Sadler Rail Coach used road-vehicle style pneumatic tyres on its drive wheels and flanged steel wheels at each end to guide it along the track. As well as the MVR itself, a special steep-gradient section of track was built for testing at Droxford. A company called Sadler Vectrail Ltd was established in 1966 to re-open the Ryde to Cowes railway on the Isle of Wight using Sadler Rail Coaches and the prototype vehicle appeared briefly at an Island Industries Fair but the scheme was unsuccessful. Mr Ashby also purchased an LBSCR 'Terrier' tank engine no. 32646 for ¬£750, which he brought to Droxford in 1964, but in May 1966 this was sold to Brickwoods, the Portsmouth-based brewer, for display outside a public house on Hayling Island and it was moved, by road, for this purpose on 16 May 1966. The northern section of line to Farringdon was not lifted immediately after closure and it was used one last time in September 1968, for the filming of a television advertisement for Cadbury's Milk Tray in which a stunt man is seen jumping from Woodside Lane bridge onto the roof of a moving train of BR Mk1 passenger stock pulled by a class 20 diesel-electric locomotive.1969 Cadbury's Milk Tray television advertisement on YouTube uploaded by 'advertarchive'. The track was lifted between November 1969 and May 1970 after which the formation near Butts Junction was obliterated by road improvements to the A31, although the northernmost extremity of the Meon Valley line may yet see trains again as the Mid-Hants Railway Company has long-term plans to build a stock shed immediately west of the former Butts Junction on the MVR formation. The two tunnels at West Meon and Privett were sold to private users. West Meon Tunnel was used by a scrapdealer for breaking up ex-military vehicles and aircraft until the 1980s, whilst Privett Tunnel was used, at one point, for growing mushrooms. The southern portion of the line also became home to the Southern Locomotive Preservation Company Limited (SLP) which came to an agreement with Mr Ashby to store some of their stock at Droxford. To this end, they moved several locomotives, including 'USA' tank engine no. 30064, as well as rolling stock, to Droxford. 30064 arrived at Knowle Junction, from the scrap sidings at Salisbury, on 7 January 1968. However, a fire at the site, and the fact that BR planned to sever the connection with the Eastleigh to Fareham line, meant that tentative plans for a preserved railway came to nothing. After the closure of Knowle Junction in 1970 (see below) the southern section of the line was cut back at far as bridge 12 which carried (and still carries) the A32 road over the line north of Wickham. Mr Ashby therefore had use of the line between Mislingford goods sidings, just a few hundred yards north of bridge 12, and Droxford station and this is evidenced by Ordnance Survey quarter-inch map 17 (South East England) dated 1972. With the mainline connection gone, Mr Ashby used two small Ruston-Hornsby diesel shunters and two ex-BR carriages to operate private-charter trains for a short time. The last remaining section between Mislingford and Droxford was lifted in 1975, the last standard gauge vehicle to run on any part the Meon Valley Railway being an Austin Mini-based railcar owned by Charles Ashby.  The Deviation Line  The double track deviation line lived a largely unremarkable existence, having no stations or sidings and having one underbridge (at Highlands Road) and one overbridge (at Funtley Road). It was also crossed by a public footbridge in the vicinity of what is now the M27 motorway. Having been opened on 2 October 1904 as a single line it was immediately pressed into service for all northbound traffic between Fareham and Knowle Junction, the tunnel line then being singled. In September 1906 the second line of rails was brought into use and, in order to close Fareham Tunnel (really Tunnels) to facilitate stabilising the formation, all traffic used the deviation line until 2 June 1907. After these works were completed Fareham Tunnel reopened for Meon Valley traffic only, there being no physical connection with the Fareham-Botley line at Knowle until 24 June 1921. The deviation line's southbound gradient of 1 in 100 was steeper than the tunnel's 1 in 132 and some southbound trains were diverted to the latter route via the connection laid in at Knowle Junction, using the single line otherwise reserved for the exclusive use of Meon Valley trains. The deviation line suffered the same problems first encountered by the Bishopstoke (Eastleigh) - Gosport line's engineers a century earlier and one large landslip in 1962 caused the up (northbound) line to be taken out of use altogether, the down (southbound) line being slewed at both ends to make the now single deviation line for the exclusive use of northbound traffic only. By return, southbound traffic used the tunnel line exclusively although the crossover at Knowle Junction remained extant, as did the now disused Meon Valley branch. Knowle Junction signal box had to be retained, not so much to guard the points, but because the tunnel line was still signalled for bi-directional running: a single line tablet had, therefore, to be issued to each southbound train and it can only be assumed that an accumulation of tablets at Fareham East signal box meant that someone was dispatched on a fairly regular basis to return the surfeit to Knowle 'box. The first nail in the coffin of this wasteful signalling practice was hammered when the Meon Valley points were taken out of use at the end of January 1970. As mentioned above, the SLP was given enough notice and they arranged for their entire stock to be brought off of the Meon Valley line, some of it being stored out of site in Fareham goods yard until it was towed in one movement to the Longmoor Military Railway at Liss on 30 May 1970 by Crompton class '33' D6543 (later 33025). Knowle signal box continued to issue single line tablets until it closed on 6 May 1973. This date coincided with the closure of the remaining track on the deviation line and the entire original route via Fareham tunnel was realigned and singled as far as Botley. Although tablets are no longer issued (and Botley signal box closed in the 1980s) the line is still single between Fareham and Botley, possibly due to there being insufficient traffic to warrant its re-doubling, but probably due to there no longer being sufficient clearance through the relined tunnels for two-way traffic. The 1841 route continues to cause problems for Network Rail, thanks to the clay upon which it was built. The deviation line south of Highlands Road was sold for housing but the route north has been turned into the 'Deviation Line' trail and can be walked or cycled all the way to Mayles Lane. This was not first mooted when the line closed and the existence of a subway under the M27 only came about due to the legal requirement to accommodate the aforementioned pre-existing footpaths in the vicinity. This also explains why the subway only measures 2 metres by 2 metres in cross section and is subsequently barely fit for use by cyclists as well as walkers (with dogs), and horse riders have to dismount and lead their steeds by the reins. A meeting of all three types of users simultaneously must be an interesting experience. =Trail= Map of the Meon Valley Railway Line The section between Knowle Junction and the West Meon Viaduct is now an bridleway (rail trail), the Meon Valley Trail.Accessible countryside On this section, all bridges, embankments and cuttings are intact and serviceable, except for two minor bridges north of Droxford which were removed in the 1960s to allow farm traffic to use the lanes they crossed. Along this part of the line, there are still occasional remains of trackside huts, signal posts and telegraph lines. At Mislingford Goods Yard, sleepers are still in the ground, a concrete loading gauge remains in place and the cast iron base of the loading crane still stands next to the remains of a what appears to be a wagon. The trail is now open again following extensive vegetation clearance and resurfacing.Hampshire County Council: Meon Valley Trail It is a level route with picturesque views over the nearby towns, villages and countryside. The section from West Meon south to the Eastleigh to Fareham line is open to walkers, cyclists and horse riders and uses existing public bridleways and some newly created permissive bridleways. There are free car parks at West Meon (off Station Road) and at Wickham (also off Station Road). There are also pay car parks in West Walk (part of the Forest of Bere). The northern section emerges from the cutting south of West Meon onto an embankment which gives views of Old Winchester Hill to the east and Beacon Hill to the west. A few former bridges on the route have been dismantled, necessitating descent to cross minor roads. There is access at several points along the route including Meonstoke which has a pub and shop. The current temporary South Downs Way route crosses the trail to the east of Exton with an access point. The Monarch's Way crosses the trail east of Warnford by a high bridge, but the trail can be joined by a path which descends the side of the cutting north of the bridge. The route from West Meon to Wickham is ; the further 3 kilometre section south-west of Wickham is a dead end, terminating at a fence in the vicinity of the erstwhile Knowle Junction. Various circular routes are possible, for example using the trail from West Meon to Meonstoke, taking the South Downs Way via Corhampton and Beacon Hill, and Monarch's way to Warnford, returning by local footpaths. The A32 main road follows a similar route to the trail.

The site of a brick under-bridge near Farringdon. The bridge was dug out of the railway embankment in the 1970s and the site used for agriculture. The only remains of the West Meon Viaduct are the two huge embankments approaching either end, the abutments and the concrete pedestals that formed the foundations for the cast iron pillars. West Meon Tunnel is currently used to store caravans and other building supplies together with a large amount of Cold War era scrap left behind from the aircraft storage and breaking during the 1980s, whilst part of Privett Tunnel is used as a storage site by a local builders merchant. Both tunnels are home to large colonies of bats, and are thus protected from disturbance and are regularly surveyed. North of the tunnels, the line is less well-preserved. The majority of the bridges have been removed, and on the section closed in 1955, much of the earthworks have been levelled and turned back into agricultural land. A cutting directly north of the West Meon Tunnel has been completely filled in, returning it to the natural ground level. This has had the effect of burying a brick over-bridge carrying a lane, which is now visible only as two walls flanking the road seemingly in the middle of a field. Between Farringdon and Chawton most of the trackbed survives and is used as a public footpath. At the very northern end approaching Alton, there is little obvious evidence of the line's existence on the ground. The A31 Alton bypass cuts through the course of the line and a large roundabout occupies its route west of Chawton. The Mid-Hants Railway has reinstated track on the formation of the Meon Valley line between Alton and Butts Junction, partly as a running line and partly as a siding. Three of the stations have survived (Droxford, East Tisted and Privett), and are used as private houses. Wickham and West Meon stations stood empty for many years and were eventually demolished in the 1970s, although at West Meon the long platforms are still very much in evidence, despite being overgrown, as is the site of the station buildings and the goods yard. There is almost no evidence of Wickham station, although one platform and the remains of some cattle pens remain in the undergrowth. At Droxford station, a plaque commemorates the crucial meeting of the Allied leaders in 1944. The MVR closely followed the A32 road between Gosport and Alton, and the line crossed the road frequently. Today the road still crosses over and under many of the former bridges of the line. At Hedge Corner, north of Privett, the road was re-routed during the building of the railway to take a chicane-like course under a bridge that carried the railway across the road at a diagonal angle. When the bridge and its embankments were levelled, the road was straightened. The two loops of the chicane now form redundant lay- bys. Small terraces of cottages built for railway workers still stand near Wickham, West Meon and Privett. The A272 road still passes through the tunnel under the embankment near West Meon, and the tunnel is a prominent local landmark. During March 2014, the former railway line was cleared of all trees and shrubs as the former track bed is to be turned into an express cycle way and bridleway between Wickham and West Meon as part of a ¬£5 million investment in a network of core cycling routes in and around the South Downs National Park. Possibility of re-opening The Act of Parliament that authorised the Meon Valley Railway had a 'perpetual service' clause imposing a legally binding requirement on the owner of the railway to run services to West Meon ‚Äì this was a condition imposed on the L&SWR; by the owners of the Warnford Park estate in return for the sale of much of the estate's land to provide a route for the railway. Such a clause would make the closure of the MVR illegal, through the withdrawal of trains to West Meon. Clauses like these were often put in Railway Acts in the 19th century. Such a clause was invoked to delay the closure of the Bluebell Railway in West Sussex. However, since there was no protest at the time of the line's closure, any such clause exists today only as a technicality, as with similar cases of now-closed railways. It is probable that it would see significantly more use today if it were open than it did in its final years, due to the greater population of all the villages and towns that it served, especially the greater volume of traffic between Fareham and Alton (as heavy traffic on the A32 and A31 roads show). It is, however, unlikely that the whole length of the former line could be re-used. The northern end of the line has been completely levelled, and the majority of the bridges have been demolished. Also, parts of the former track-bed have been built on at Farringdon and East Tisted. The surviving stations are now private homes. From an engineering point of view, it would be relatively simple to reinstate the line from Fareham as far as West Meon, and if the viaduct were rebuilt, as far as Privett. However, such a line, that did not connect to Alton, would be highly unlikely to be viable as a mainline route, and could only function effectively as a small commuter line or heritage railway. =Narrow Gauge Re-opening Attempt= A local society were exploring the possibility of constructing a or narrow gauge railway from West Meon to Wickham and perhaps as far as Knowle. However the website has not been updated for sometime and no further news has been seen or heard of. =Standard Gauge Re-opening Attempt= A group called the Meon Valley Railway Preservation Society, which was not associated with the narrow gauge group that formed in January 2013, was planning on reopening the line as a standard gauge railway from Knowle to West Meon. Its plan was to reopen the line in sections, the first phase being Knowle to Soberton Heath, then the second phase would see them lay track to Droxford by 2025 and then West Meon shortly after that. However, there were no plans to extend to Alton due to the missing viaduct and structures having been built on the track bed. It was to be a shared double track formation with the current footpath/bridleway, as it would have been a single line, like it was back in the days pre-1968. The Meon Valley Railway Preservation Society disbanded at the start of June 2013. Another group called the Meon Valley Railway Heritage Society, later changing to the Meon Valley Railway Restoration Society, which formed in June 2013 were looking at reopening it as a standard gauge heritage line with similar plans as the previous group. Planning to start at Mislingford Goods yard with a new station, working northwards towards Droxford with a station just south of the former Droxford station and a halt at Soberton was also planned. The group did not rule out going to Alton, but were focused on the line from Knowle to West Meon. The group disbanded in December 2013 due to \\"commitment issues\\" from within the group. =Mainline Re-opening Proposal= An independent report published by Walter Menteth Architects in April 2016 has suggested that the Meon Valley Railway should be investigated for reopening as a dual mainline adding an additional service from the Solent region to London, with a chord at Knowle to allow north and south bound trains on the Eastleigh to Fareham line to use the Meon Valley line to reach Alton and London Waterloo. =Campaign for Better Transport Report= In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments). p.42 In popular culture The poem 'Autumn Journal' by Louis MacNeice, published in 1938, includes a description of a pre-First World War journey from Hampshire to London on a cross-country train via the Meon Valley. West Meon and Tisted are mentioned as two of the stations that the poet passes through on his journey. Shortly after the final closure of the MVR in 1968, the section of line between Alton and Farringdon was used for the filming of the first of the long-running 'Milk Tray Man' series of adverts for Cadbury Milk Tray. The eponymous 'action man' character jumps onto the roof of a moving train that consisted of a British Railways diesel locomotive and two carriages.

History Begun by Governor General Jean-Baptiste Chaudi√© of the French colonial government at Saint- Louis, Senegal on 24 November 1903, the school was moved to the Island of Gor√©e in 1913. In 1915 it was named in honour of the recently deceased William Merlaud-Ponty, Governor General of French West Africa. From 1913 to 1938 the school occupied a building on Gor√©e originally built before 1800 for the pirate slave traders Jean and Pierre Lafitte. After 1938 the school occupied a former military garrison in S√©bikotane, about 40 kilometres from Dakar, and a village called S√©bi-Ponty sprang up to house the school's indigenous African personnel. In 1965 the school moved to Thi√®s, 70 kilometres east of Dakar, and a portion of the Sebikotane building was turned into a prison. During the government of Senegalese Prime Minister L√©opold Senghor, repairs to the building at S√©bikotane were neglected, and its occupation by squatters was tolerated. In 1984 the school moved to Kolda. The school has a two-year common core curriculum followed by students intending to become teachers or administrative clerks. Those who intend to study medicine, pharmacy or midwifery study a further year of introductory science at William Ponty School before transferring to the National School of Medicine and Pharmacy.

Extra murals department The extra murals department of the university of Ibadan was established in 1949 to focus on adult education in the nation. A reason given for its creation was to expand knowledge to non- Ibadan graduates so as not to create a dominant network of graduate elites. However, the prospect of independence led to increased enthusiasm for knowledge in various towns and cities. The department soon devoted resources and research into the issue of self-government. A number of nationalistic politicians attended courses or seminars offered by the department in the 1950s. Ayo Ogunsheye, as director was a vital element in the department which included noted scholar Ulli Beier. =Self government seminar= As an academic, Ayo Ogunsheye wrote often on the need to tilt education towards improving national consciousness and bringing the informal education sector into public consciousness. In 1959, when the clamor for independence was at it loudest, a conference was held at Ibadan to hash out impending independent issues.

Using the adage, a nation divided against itself cannot stand, he stressed the extradition of internal chaos by the use of an appropriate constitution, which would become a necessary factor for strengthening the country,Jones p 89-90 However, like his views on education, a lot them dealt with nationalism and how to ensure dynamic progress for black Africa. He also emphasized major complementary cases for unity in West Africa and Nigeria. That Nigeria as a large and diverse nation will provide instances where regions can benefit from fair exchange of food and resources. The need to attract foreign capital will become closer to reality with the existence of a large country suitable for foreign investors.

He competed in several North American and International promotions including National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), American Wrestling Association (AWA), Maple Leaf Wrestling, National Wrestling Federation, International Wrestling Association and the World Wide Wrestling Federation feuding with then WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino during the early 1960s NWA's Lou Thesz, Gene Kiniski and AWA's Verne Gagne. As a sports event promoter and television producer since 1967, he has presented over 3,500 live wrestling and sports events from Singapore to New York City to Trinidad. He co-founded the National Wrestling Federation (NWF), which he sold to Japanese interests in 1973. Powers was the first major international syndicator of television wrestling with programs in over 27 countries. Professional wrestling career Dennis Waters was born in Hamilton, Ontario. At 15, he started training under the tutelage of Canadian light heavyweight wrestling champion Jack Wentworth. Powers had his first professional match in 1960 in Detroit at age 17 while attending McMaster University in Hamilton. He left university and became a professional wrestler, formally turning professional at age 20 in Detroit as Lord Anthony Lansdowne. Johnny Powers, 1964 He wrestled Larry Chene many times, who then mentored Powers. Powers dyed his hair blond and wrestled as Johnny Powers, the Golden Adonis, in North East United States and Canada in 1964. Powers wrestled six times for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship against Bruno Sammartino in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Powers turned heel and was managed by Bobby Davis. He fought Whipper Billy Watson many times across Canada and was main event for two years in Canada's Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto. Powers fought NWA World Champions Lou Thesz outdoors in Hamilton ballpark and St Louis Kiel Auditorium and Gene Kiniski in Toronto ballpark and The Hamilton Forum. Powers dominated Cleveland Ohio with great battles against Johnny Valentine, The Sheik, Ernie Ladd and Abdullah the Butcher. In 1973, Powers wrestled Ladd in a match, during which wrestler Ox Baker turned on Ladd to side with Powers. As a result, angry fans stormed the ring‚Äîan incident known as \\"The Cleveland Riot\\" and one of the most dangerous riots in professional wrestling history. Lord Anthony Lansdowne, 1963 Powers was tutored as a wrestling promoter and television producer by international old school wrestler, booker and classic promoter Pedro Mart√≠nez. Martinez coached and mentored Powers for 20 years from the age of 22 in the art of creative event marketing of pro wrestling. Mart√≠nez and Powers founded National Sports TV on an existing \\"Wrestling from Buffalo Auditorium\\" library of black and white films. This library had been funded by one of pro wrestling first big money sponsors, Dow beer. Johnny Powers, North American Champion, 1973 Powers co-founded the National Wrestling Federation and sold it three years later in 1973 to New Japan Pro Wrestling. He was the NWF World Heavyweight Champion and was the star of \\"Championship Wrestling with Johnny Powers\\". He was the only wrestler then and since to have a television show named after him (aside from \\"Championship Wrestling with Antonino Rocca\\" on Ch.9 in New York City in 1963/64? Or Hulk Hogan's Rock-N-Wrestling in the mid-80s?) . He was NWF North American Champion seven times and NWF world champion three times (same title). Powers sold television wrestling shows and films to Japan, Mexico, the Armed Forces Network and eventually to 27 countries creating the first and largest international professional wrestling television distribution network. Martinez and Powers owned the largest professional wrestling library in the world at that time with acquisition of most of the other key US wrestling territories television libraries. Powers also, as executive producer and on air commentator, promoted and produced over 300 new hours of televised wrestling. Johnny Powers, USA, 1979 Powers held the first barbed wire top rope wrapped match and paid a record athletic commission fine.

There were three types: Arz 1, Arz 2, and Arz 3. During the 21st century the Arz4 missile was developed. The missile was stopped from production because it had close destruction abilities of French army missiles at that time (1960s). However, international worries towards the development in the abilities of Lebanese missiles began to surface, so Lebanon was put under pressure to stop producing these rockets by Western countries. Single-stage Rockets In November 1960, Professor Manoug Manougian and a group of students formed Haigazian College Rocket Society (HCRS). They started research into single and multistage solid fuel rockets with a budget of 750 LBP donated by MP Emile Bustani. Due to lack of proper equipment, the group was obliged to resort to flight testing without any fuel tests in the laboratories. In April 1961, after several failures, a single-stage rocket was launched to an altitude of about one kilometer. Improvements on the solid fuel system increased the altitude to two kilometers. Multi-stage Rockets As a result of these experiments, the Lebanese President Fuad Chehab granted financial assistance of ten and fifteen thousand LBP to HCRS for 1961 and 1962 respectively. During the academic year 1961-1962, HCRS worked on two-stage rockets, and improved the design. On May 25, 1962, HCRS-7 (Arz 1) was launched to a height of 11500 m, and the Lebanese Army was responsible for security. That summer, two more rockets were launched to a height of 20 km. Due to the successes of the HCRS, new members joined, and the Lebanese Rocket Society (LRS) was formed in 1962. * On November 21, 1962, Arz 3, a three-stage solid propellant rocket, was launched. It had a length of 6.80 m and a mass of 1250 kg. * In the summer of 1964, an accident occurred during launch, which hospitalized two students and caused all launches to end. * It has been revealed, after several years, from a report addressed to President Fouad Chehab, the personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle of France sent a message to the Lebanese President informing him that Lebanon has proved its abilities in the scientific field, and the missile has the potential of putting Lebanon at risk. President Shehab took that advice, and stopped on the impact of practical experience to launch rocket.

World War I Created on 4 April 1915 to defend the front between the Swiss border and Lorraine, the Seventh Army was the successor of the independent Army Detachment of the Vosges under General Putz. This Detachment had been created on 8 December 1914, with the stabilisation of the Western Front as successor of the Army of Alsace, Groupement des Vosges and 34th Army Corps. The Seventh Army held the same position until the end of the War. Its major involvements were the Battle of Hartmannswillerkopf and the Battle of Le Linge in 1915. World War II The Seventh Army was re-formed on 3 September 1939 as a strategic reserve force. On 11 November, under General Henri Giraud, it became part of the 1st Army Group and was deployed to northern Belgium, under the Allied Dyle Plan. Following the German offensives in Western Europe from 10 May 1940, the Seventh Army advanced into the Netherlands and northern Belgium. After heavy fighting in Belgium and German breakthroughs further south (the Ardennes and Flanders), the general staff ordered the withdrawal of the Seventh Army headquarters (to central France). However, Giraud remained in Belgium to command the French 9th Army, which had assumed control of the surviving 7th Army units. Giraud was captured soon afterward at Wassigny (19 May). On 17 May, a new Seventh Army had been formed on the Somme, under the 2nd Army Group, with reserve units and surviving units of the Second Army (which had been destroyed in Flanders). The new Seventh Army took an active part in the Battle of France until 25 June, 1940.

Like rollcages and rollbars in cars and trucks, a ROPS involves bars attached to the frame that maintain a space for the operator's body in the event of rollover. Unimog fire engine with roll over protection structures Fordson tractor. MF 135. Photo: K.A. Gallis. Commonly found on heavy equipment (i.e. tractors), earth-moving machinery and UTVs used in construction, agriculture and mining, ROPS structures are defined by various regulatory agencies, including the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).See OSHA Roll-Over Protective Structures, Direct Final Rule. The regulations include both a strength requirement as well as an energy absorption requirement of the structure. Some dump trucks add a protrusion to their boxes that cover the operator's compartment for ROPS purposes. ROPS are commonly fitted to 4x4's, pickup trucks, earth moving equipment, soil compactors and utes used in the mining industry. Products such as this were developed out of necessity so employees travelling around or within mine sites were provided with extra protection in the event of a fleet vehicle roll over. In the US, ROPS designs have to be certified by a professional engineer, who will normally require a destructive test. The structure will be tested at a reduced temperature (where the metal is more brittle), or fabricated from materials that have satisfactory low temperature performance. The International Organization for Standardization has guidelines for destructively testing ROPS structures on earthmoving machinery, excavators, forestry equipment and tractors. Theoretical performance analysis of major new design ROPS is not permitted as an alternative to physical testing.  Variants  Some tractor operators have raised concerns about using ROPS in low-clearance environments, such as in orchards and buildings. In response, NIOSH developed an Automatically Deploying Rollover Protective Structure (AutoROPS) which stays in a lowered position until a rollover condition is determined, at which time it deploys to a fully extended and locked position. It is currently working with manufacturers to streamline the commercialization of this technology.See National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (US) NIOSH Program Portfolio: Traumatic Injury: Selected Research-to-Practice Efforts Addressing Traumatic Injury Problems: Automatically deployed roll-over-protection structure (ROPS). The Division of Safety Research branch of NIOSH has developed cost-effective rollover protection structures (CROPS) for four tractor models (Ford 8N, Ford 3000, Ford 4000, Massey Ferguson 135), in an effort to provide safety for older model tractors. Some automobile models have begun to adopt the phrase, substituting system for structure in the ROPS acronym, notably the Volvo C70 convertible models, and Jaguar XK. Their ROPS structures consist of two pyrotechnically charged roll hoops hidden behind the rear seats that will pop up in the case of a roll-over to protect the occupants. If the roof is up, the system will still work, shattering the rear window at the same time. History = Rollover injury and fatality = Tractor rollover has become one of the leading causes of occupational death in the agricultural industry. In the United States from 1992 to 2005, 1,412 workers were killed from tractor rollover, with roughly 10,000 suffering an injury. These rollover fatalities represented about 20% of all agricultural fatalities. During 2003 to 2010, 933 workers in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting industries were killed as a result of tractor rollover, accounting for over 63% of all tractor-related deaths. The National Safety Council estimates that between 150 and 200 tractor operators are killed due to rollover in the U.S. each year. Researchers have also attempted to estimate the chances that a tractor rollover will result in a fatality of the operator. An adjusted probability of about 8 deaths per 100 tractor overturns (8%) was extrapolated using data from the Kentucky Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) Program. Furthermore, youth are particularly at risk of being crushed or pinned by a machine (all-terrain vehicle, tractor, etc.) that is not equipped with a rollover bar. All-terrain vehicles and tractors continue to be leading causes of fatal injury among youth in agricultural settings. The installation of Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) on older tractors that lack these protective devices has been identified as a viable solution for reducing overturn fatality rates among U.S. farmers. When worn with a seat belt, these engineering controls are 99% effective in preventing operator death if an overturn occurs.NIOSH Center Directors. National Agricultural Tractor Safety Initiative. E. Swenson, ed. Seattle: University of Washington, 2004. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (USA) estimates that fatality rates from tractor overturns in the U.S. could be reduced by a minimum of 71% if all tractors were equipped with ROPS. When paired with proper seat belt use on tractors, NIOSH estimates that ROPS could eliminate nearly all fatalities caused by tractor and lawn mower overturns. Without a seat belt, the ROPS is still 70% effective in preventing operator death, though there is a possibility that the rider may be thrown from the tractor during the overturn, and thus left unprotected by the ROPS. = Usage rates = Research from Sweden shows that the fatality rate from tractor rollover remains stable when ROPS prevalence rates range from 40% to 75%; only until the rate of ROPS adoption reaches 75% to 80% does the fatality rate from rollover fall significantly, to near-zero. The latest estimates of tractors equipped with ROPS in the United States show that 59% of tractors were ROPS- equipped in 2006, an increase from the 38% in 1993. With steady increases in the installation of ROPS, it is projected that the rollover fatality rate will decline steadily, until reaching a rate near zero by 2028. ROPS usage has also appeared to be linked to a number of factors. There is regional variation in ROPS usage within the United States, as estimates from 2006 showed that tractor operators in the South had the highest prevalence of ROPS usage at 65%, while the Northeast had the lowest prevalence of ROPS usage at 51%. The West and Midwest reported rates of 60% and 56% respectively. Age of tractor operator is a large risk factor, as increasing age is associated with decreasing rates of ROPS usage. The oldest group of tractor operators, those ages 65 and above, have the lowest rate of overall ROPS usage at 42%. Additionally, older tractor operators are more likely to suffer fatality and severe injury outcomes following tractor rollover than younger operators. Along with the age of the tractor operator, the age of the tractor itself is a risk factor. Older tractor models are less likely to be equipped with ROPS, possibly owing to impracticality in installation or to mandated installations in newer models. Further, older tractors are more dangerous than newer tractors, possessing narrow front ends and a higher center of gravity, as well as being more prone to operational failure. Economics also appears to be a major factor in rates of ROPS adoption. Farms with low value of sales, part- time operations, and smaller acreage are less likely to employ ROPS-equipped tractors than farms with high value of sales, full-time operations, and larger acreage. Additionally, farms that use more hired labor over non-hired labor (family) are found to have fewer fatal tractor overturns. Overall, farms that are more economically viable are more likely to install ROPS on tractors than smaller, lower-income farms. = ROPS adoption = Tractor rollover deaths have been identified as a public health problem since the 1920s. Research efforts from several countries towards the development of engineering controls to reduce injury from rollover persisted for several decades before any legislation took place. In 1959, Sweden became the first country to enact ROPS legislation, requiring all newly manufactured tractors in the country to have ROPS installed. This requirement was expanded in 1965, requiring all tractors in Sweden, regardless of manufacture date, to have ROPS installed if it was operated by an employee and not the actual owner.The Swedish Work Environment Authority's regulation AFS 2004:06, page 10 (in Swedish) Similar legislation requiring ROPS installation has been enacted in Australia, Germany, and Denmark. In the United States, standards for ROPS design and utilization for tractors were first developed in 1967 by the American Society for Agricultural and Biological Engineers. ROPS legislation was passed in 1975, with OSHA requiring that all tractors manufactured from 25 October 1976 onwards be equipped with ROPS. In 1985, the development of a new voluntary safety standard by the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (S318.10) encouraged an initiative by American tractor manufacturers to equip new tractors over 20 horsepower with ROPS. Agricultural health and safety researchers have observed that increases in ROPS protected tractors in the United States can largely be tied to attrition (older tractors without ROPS being replaced with newer tractors with ROPS) vs. installation of ROPS. Additional studies have indicated the need to promote and facilitate ROPS installation on older tractors, as many farmers are unwilling to replace their older tractors. Overall, these studies demonstrate that relying on the eventual replacement of ROPS is not an expeditious solution to tractor overturn deaths and will result in the death of many U.S. tractor operators over the next few decades.  Barriers to ROPS installation in the United States  Over the past few decades, quantitative and qualitative research studies have attempted to identify farmers' potential barriers to ROPS adoption. Cost, time to find and install ROPS parts, and dismissal of personal risk have all been prominently identified barriers to ROPS adoption. Research also shows that knowledge of tractor overturn risks and the benefits of ROPS installation do not appear to stimulate farmer interest in installing ROPS. Equipment dealers have also cited a number of barriers, such as a perceived lack of farmer interest, injury liability, difficulty recovering expenses and a lack of understanding amongst dealers regarding the magnitude of the overturn fatality problem, which negatively impacts dealers' interest in ROPS installation.  Programs to increase ROPS installation in the U.S.  Several strategies have been employed to address these barriers and motivate farmers to install ROPS. In 1985, equipment manufacturers launched a promotional campaign to encourage ROPS installation activities, although industry representatives state the campaign did not stimulate considerable interest in ROPS installation in the farm community [1]. Education has also been largely employed by extension agents and agricultural health and safety educators as a means for increasing ROPS installations [1], although evaluations of educational interventions indicate they do not markedly decrease agricultural worker injury rates or increase ROPS installation activity. However, in Kentucky, a community awareness campaign did appear to increase interest in ROPS installation. Various state farm bureaus (VA, NC, and IL) have also offered financial incentives for members to install ROPS [1] [5], while an online ROPS Inventory Site called the KY ROPS Guide, was developed to assist farmers searching for ROPS. In 2006, the New York ROPS Rebate Program was launched in an effort to increase access to ROPS among New York tractor operators; this addressed the Northeastern United States' consistently lower rates of ROPS usage than other regions of the United States. The program has since expanded to seven states including NY, PA, VT, NH, WI, MA, and MN. These programs incorporate a number of components that build on prior ROPS research. These include targeted promotions, rebates for 70% of the cost to install ROPS (with varying caps on farmers out of pocket expense) and toll-free ROPS hotline assistance with the ROPS purchase and ordering process. Rebate funding is provided via state funding resources or private industry / fundraising campaigns. Programs have increased farmer interest in ROPS installation with an average of 1,200 calls annually to the ROPS hotline and farmers are generally satisfied with these services (99% of program participants would recommend the program to other farmers).Rebecca Russell. ROPS Hotline Coordinator. Personal Communication. 2 November 2016. Programs have also documented the prevention of injury and death for farmers who have participated in these installation programs.  Current efforts to increase ROPS adoption in the United States  = National Tractor Safety Coalition (NTSC) = In an effort to build on the momentum of prior ROPS interventional efforts to create a national ROPS installation solution, a number of research, government and industry groups organized a two-day 'Whole- System-in-the-Room' workshop in Chicago, IL on May 2014. The purpose of the meeting was to outline a national strategy for ROPS installation that all stakeholders could agree on and to engage multiple industry groups in strategy implementation efforts. Close to 50 organizations were represented at the meeting and included representatives from the following industry groups: manufacturers and dealers, agricultural organizations, health and safety organizations, financial and insurance groups, government organizations, researchers, private corporations, media, farmers/farm safety advocates. By the end of the meeting, the National Tractor Safety Coalition was officially organized with the mission \\"to prevent tractor-related injuries and deaths in U.S. agriculture by developing and implementing collaborative, stakeholder- driven, evidence-based solutions.\\" A detailed list of common goals are featured in the NIOSH Science Blog \\"The National Tractor Safety Coalition: Taking a new systems-approach to a well-known problem.\\"Sorensen J and Tinc P. The National Tractor Safety Coalition: Taking a new systems-approach to a well-known problem. 12 August 2014. Accessed 2 November 2016. Currently the Coalition includes 87 members from a number of agricultural or health related organizations. These organizations include: NIOSH, American Farm Bureau Federation, Farm Foundation, and several Universities, Extension agencies, NIOSH Agricultural Safety and Health Centers, State Departments of Health, and insurance companies, among others [32]. Some members serve on the NTSC Steering Committee, which meets on a monthly basis and provide guidance on the overarching initiative to expand ROPS installation programs nationally while others provide assistance on various aspects of national ROPS implementation efforts, such as promotions, testimonials, congressional outreach or networking. A manufacturing and technology task force has also been assembled, and provides guidance to the group on technical issues [30]. = National ROPS Rebate Program = The NTSC launched the National ROPS Rebate Program in 2017 which helps to facilitate individual state based programs as well as trying to obtain national-level funding. Additional information on the NRRP can be found at www.ROPSR4U.org. Given the NTSC's broad mission to address tractor-related deaths, the group seeks to tackle issues such as run-overs or implement entanglements once a National ROPS Rebate Program has been sustainably established.

The plan was carried out between 1947 and 1949. It succeeded in its primary aim of largely rebuilding Poland from the devastation of the war, as well as in increasing output of Polish industry and agriculture. Development and goals Poland suffered heavy losses during World War II. In addition to significant population losses,US Department of State, Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. Background Note: Poland (March 2007). Retrieved on 2007-04-07 it suffered catastrophic damage to its infrastructure during the war; the losses in national resources and infrastructure amounted to over 30% percent of pre-war potential. Rebuilding of the economy was also made more difficult by the major territorial changes of Poland after World War II. See also other copy online The Three-Year Plan was developed and monitored by the Central Planning Office (Centralny UrzƒÖd Planowania), a body of the government tasked with creation of economic policy, and in the early years dominated by a more liberal Polish Socialist Party (PPS) faction. Among the economists involved in its development was the then CUP director, Czes≈Çaw Bobrowski. CUP centralized planning for the entire Polish economy was previously broken into separate bodies working on planning for separate branches. The plan, significantly influenced by the PPS, was designed to create a balance between the private sector, the public sector and the cooperatives. Instead of ideology, commonly stressed by later communist plans, it concentrated on the realistic problems and ways to address them. On 21 September 1946 the State National Council (KRN), a Polish communist- dominated unelected Polish parliament accepted the plan for the Polish economy up to 1949. On 2 July 1947 the newly elected Sejm declared that: \\"The primary goal of the national economy in the years 1947-1949 is to raise the living conditions of working classes to above the pre-war levels.\\" The plan as described by the above bodies was designed to develop industry and service sectors, foreign trade and ensure the supply of basic consumer items. The plan specified the size of industrial and agricultural production to be achieved in the following years. In 1949 both the industrial and agricultural productions were to be above the pre-war levels. The industrial output was also to be higher than agricultural output. The plan did not involve creation of new industrial centers, only the rebuilding of the old ones (unless they were over 50% destroyed). Results and assessment Due to the dedication of substantial resources to industrial rebuilding, and the successful adoption of the Stakhanovite movement (the communist propaganda of that time created a new \\"hero of the working class\\", Wincenty Pstrowski), where workers were encouraged to work above their quota, the expected increase in industrial output was reached ahead of schedule. However, the agricultural output did not increase as much as predicted, partially due to bad weather in 1947, partially due to inefficiencies involved in collectivization of farming and finally, partially due to side-effects of the battle for trade, which damaged traditional supply chains. In 1948 industrial production was 30% higher compared to 1939, but agricultural production was 30% lower (compared to the 1934-38 period). The battle for trade, pushed for by Stalinist hardliners like Hilary Minc, suggested that both the cooperative and private sectors should be eliminated and the public sector should be dominant, assumptions contrary to the foundations of the three-year plan which stated that all three sectors are equal. The battle for trade also resulted in a decrease of the craftmanship sector. Polska. Gospodarka. Przemys≈Ç.. Encyklopedia PWN Already in 1949 the stress was moved from consumer goods to producer goods, and light industry development was slowed. The next plan in the Polish communist economy was the Six-Year Plan (1950‚Äì1956), much more critically assessed by modern historians and economists, as by 1950 the CUP and Polish government were dominated by Stalinist hardliners, and PPS economists responsible for creation of the Three-Year Plan were no longer influencing government policy. The Six-Year Plan, designed to bring the economy of Poland in line with the Soviet economy, concentrated on heavy industrialization, with projects such as Nowa Huta. Rebuilding of the Polish economy was also slowed in 1947, as Soviet influence caused the Polish government to reject the American-sponsored Marshall Plan, designed to aid European economies in post-war rebuilding.Schain, Martin A. The Marshall Plan: fifty years after, Palgrave, 2001, , Google Print, p.132 With the simultaneous rebuilding of the cities, substantial migration from rural areas to urban centers occurred, increasing urbanization.

Retrieved on 28 March 2007. In 1939, 60% of Poles worked in agriculture and 13% in industry; in 1949, the figures were 47% and 21%, respectively. The three-year plan is widely considered a success and the only efficient economic plan in the history of People's Republic of Poland. It succeeded in its primary aim: mostly rebuilding Poland from the devastation of the war, as well as in increasing output of Polish industry and agriculture.

This was confirmed later when animal testing found it to cause benign and malignant tumors in the mammary glands, stomachs, esophagi, and lungs of rodents of both sexes, although insufficient evidence exists in human exposure. This successful use of bacterial mutagenicity as a screen for carcinogenicity confirmed the use of this methodology as a rapid and efficient test, in comparison to animal testing alone, and led to its further development. The availability of such simpler tests in turn gave rise to greater government oversight and testing of compounds to which the public would be exposed.

She has worked extensively in the theory of truth and philosophy of logic. Sher is a leading advocate of foundational holism, a holistic theory of epistemology. Career In 1989, Sher earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia University,CV where she studied the works of Willard Quine and Alfred Tarski. Her dissertation was directed by Charles Parsons. Her early work focused on Tarski's definition of truth. Her reformulation of this definition has been influential in modern truth theory. Her dissertation was expanded into the book The Bounds of Logic (1991),Sher, Gila. (1991), The Bounds of Logic, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. in which Sher also formalized definitions for unique second-order quantifiers such as 'most'. Sher has pursued research into logical positivism and logical foundationalism. She has argued that strict-ordering Foundationalism, in the vein of Rudolf Carnap, is untenable, supporting Quine's argument from Two Dogmas of Empiricism. She has, however, resisted the mainstream move toward all-or-nothing and semantic holism. The former view she considers unexplanatory, and the latter she considers untenable (see: Jerry Fodor).Sher, Gila. (2004), In Search of a Substantive Theory of Truth, The Journal of Philosophy Sher has also written more generally on the metaphysics of truth. She put forward an influential criticism of John Etchemendy in the article \\"Did Tarski Commit Tarski's Fallacy?\\"Sher, Gila. (1996), Did Tarski Commit Tarski's Fallacy?, The Journal of Symbolic Logic 61, 653-86. This article was influential in defending Tarskian truth theory from the radical attack posed by Etchemendy. She is also a leading Quine scholar, writing about the place of philosophy in his theory of naturalized epistemology.Sher, Gila. (1999), Is There a Place for Philosophy in Quine's Theory?, The Journal of Philosophy 96, 491-524. Since 2017, Sher has been an editor of the Journal of Philosophy, and from 2012‚Äì2017, she was an editor-in-chief of the journal Synthese.

It was the first time an American had won the World Junior since William Lombardy in 1957. Other achievements included being Louisiana State Champion in 1986, 1987 and 1988. His father, Carl Diesen, was a tournament chess player as early as the mid-1940s, which resulted in strong family support for Mark's chess career. He grew up in Potomac, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., which afforded him numerous opportunities to play. It also allowed Mark to become a student of Grandmaster Lubosh Kavalek, who was one of the strongest players in the world. While Kavalek was noted as a tactician, Diesen was a player with a positional style that made him a difficult opponent to face for even the most experienced IMs and GMs. Among the top players he defeated in his short career were Larry Evans, Borislav Ivkov, John Nunn, and Eugenio Torre.

It was launched in June 2004 and was formerly called B4 TV, a previous pre-launch music channel from CSC Media Group. Flava broadcast for 24 hours a day and played Hip Hop, Urban and R&B; music from the late 1970s to the 2010s. It also occasionally showed films and original programming (#PLAY). The channel advertised itself as 100% Old Skool Hip- Hop/R&B; 24/7. History =B4= Flava launched on 12 July 2004 and started off as a test channel which focused on Pop and Dance under the name of \\"B4\\". The channel used to play the latest pre release music videos from the notable artists and groups. It also had hours dedicated to playing requested music. The channel had advertised itself as both 'B4 It's A Hit' and 'B4 Everyone Else'. The B4 logo was on screen in the bottom left-hand corner during music videos and the song information was shown in a white coloured bar at the start and near the end of each music video. The channels' identity was also seen before and after advert breaks when the B4 logo forms on screen in a white box shape on an orange background. B4 was available 24 hours a day on Sky channel 357 and was part of several music channels owned by CSC Media Group. B4 also produced an early morning music video programme broadcast from 2004 on weekdays on Channel 4 at 7am. It was normally broadcast as part of Channel 4's breakfast programming following children's programme The Hoobs and preceding a number of comedy programmes normally imported from America. Produced by the firm behind ITV's The Chart Show, the show featured around seven new upfront videos each day that were going to be released in the United Kingdom in the near future, normally within the next month. =Rebrand to Flava= The B4 rebrand to Flava first came to light when the Ofcom licence for B4 was removed and replaced by one under the name of Flava, this also reflected the EPG references of the term \\"Flava\\" being used to describe the programmes being shown, in late February/early March 2008. On 26 March 2008, B4 launched officially as an all-urban music channel named Flava. On 29 September 2009, Flava launched on Freesat channel 502, replacing Scuzz on the platform. On 26 November 2012, Flava changed its logo. On 5 June 2013, Flava swapped positions with Scuzz on Sky. The channel moved from channel 367 to 374, while Scuzz moved from 374 to 367 (to sit next to Kerrang!, as both are rock music channels). On 21 July 2014, Flava, along with Bliss were removed from Freesat. On 23 April 2017, Flava introduced a brand new logo, changed their programme graphics from blue to black (red in some programmes and yellow in \\"Remember The Year\\"), as well as later rebranding themselves to be a 100% Old Skool Hip Hop and RnB channel on 2 May 2017. Closure Flava ceased broadcasting at 11:15 on 1 November 2017 without warning, with \\"Juicy\\" by The Notorious B.I.G. the final music video to be played on the channel, Flava abruptly crashed and went blank in the middle of the video. The channel was then closed down and removed from the EPG abruptly and shortly after. The last video played in full was \\"In Da Club\\" by 50 Cent.

Highest tides in the world Burntcoat Head had a public wharf that has been the location of a tide gauge since the 19th century. The tide gauge at Burntcoat Head was operated by the Canadian Hydrographic Service and has recorded the highest tidal range in the world. Currently, the tidal gauge is no longer in operation. Tides at Burntcoat Head average , with the highest being set during the 1869 Saxby Gale at . The Guinness Book of World Records (1975) declared that Burntcoat had the highest tides in the world: > ‚ÄúThe Natural World, Greatest Tides: The greatest tides in the world occur in > the Bay of Fundy.... Burntcoat Head in the Minas Basin, Nova Scotia, has the > greatest mean spring range with 14.5 metres (47.5 feet) and an extreme range > of 16.3 metres (53.5 feet).‚Äù The National Geographic magazine (August 1957) also made a similar assertion: ‚ÄúThe famous tides of the Bay of Fundy move with deceptive quiet. Sheltered from the open sea, they ebb and flood to a recorded range unequal in the rest of the world.‚Äù Like pretty much every place along the ocean around the world, Burntcoat Head experiences two high tides and two low tides each day. The Bay of Fundy fills and empties with approximately 160 billion tonnes of water twice a day. On average it takes 6 hours and 13 minutes between high and low tide. As soon as the tide has reached it lowest or highest point it will change directions and either begin to come to shore or flow back out. Each day the tides times will change approximately by one hour. The reason why the tides fills and empties the Bay of Fundy each day is due to gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on the earth, as well as earths rotation. = Spring tides and neap tides = Spring tides happen twice a month when the sun, moon, and earth are aligned. During this alignment the tides rise higher than average. Neap tides occur during the first and third quarter moon. During this time the high tides heights are lower than average.  Shorelife  At low tide the ocean floor becomes exposed allowing different species and ecosystems to be found along the shoreline and within tidal pools. Barnacles, periwinkles, slipper limpets, moon snails, horse mussels, leafy bryozoans, and whelks can be found along the ocean floor. False angel wing and Atlantic mud- piddock can be found burrowed into the sandstone. Dead man's fingers and mermaid's glove which are sponges can be found washed up on shore. The five main crab species that can be found within the tidal pools are green crab, hermit crab, lady crab, toad crab, and rock crab. The popular fish species that can be found in tidal pools are tommy cod, Atlantic mackerel, smallmouth bass, eels, monkfish, and flounder. Burntcoat Head is a popular location for migrating shorebirds, which include sandpipers, whimbrels, yellowlegs, willets, and plovers. During low tide when mud flats are exposed the birds will consume mud shrimps before heading south for the winter months. From mid- May to mid-October a tidal reveal is offered by knowledgeable guides who provide a shoreline exploration. The tour is offered at low tide and allows visitors a guided tour of the ocean floor. Visitors are able to be hands-on when exploring and learning about shorelife ecosystems that live within the tidal pools and mudflats. Visitors will also learn about the tides and history of the shorelines of Burntcoat and surrounding areas.  Geology  Burntcoat is a part of the Triassic Lowlands Region. The Minas Basin and Cobequid Bay was formed from rivers that eroded from the Bay of Fundy. Burntcoat Head shoreline and ocean floor is made from Triassic red sandstones and conglomerates. The sedimentary rocks along the ocean floor and along the shoreline are formed from sand, pebbles, and mud. = Fossils = Fossils and bones of animals that travelled the Triassic Lowland Region can be found within the rocks of Burntcoat Head. Over the years skulls from an archosaur known as Teraterpetion and backbones of a dicynodont have been found within the rocks along the shoreline. = Erosion = Due to sea level rising and the strength of the tides, the shoreline‚Äôs sandstones erode. Erosion causes sediment of sand, pebbles, and mud to be washed up and down the Cobequid Bay with the incoming and outgoing tides. The sediment forms sand bars along the shorelines, as well as in the Shubenacadie River.  Lighthouse  =The Only Son= The Burntcoat lighthouse guided wooden sailing ships since the Golden Age of Sail in Nova Scotia. Built in 1858, the lighthouse was built on land which eventually became an island. A narrow neck of land, just wide enough for a team of horses and wagon, connected it with the mainland. After the strip of land was eroded, the inhabitants went to and from the lighthouse by climbing up and down the bank by means of a ladder. There were five kerosene lamps that were cleaned and lit every evening. The lighthouse keeper of the first lighthouse saw the crashing of the schooner the Only Son (1898). This vessel belonged to the Mariner of Minasville, Captain William Scott. The vessel was being sailed by his sons in a storm and was dashed to pieces off the rocks of Burntcoat. The sons survived and the only part of the vessel that remains is the vessel's guiding light. The first lighthouse was eventually lost to erosion of the coast. =The airplane pilots= Thomas Faulkner and the Lighthouse, The Hants Journal 7 October 1931 The lighthouse was re-built in its present site (1913). The lighthouse was kept by William Faulkner and his family, on whose land the lighthouse was built. The gas light in this house was raised every evening on a 76 ft. tower. During the Great Depression, a German mail plane crashed off the coast at 3:30 am on 6 October 1931. Many local residents, including the lighthouse keeper Thomas Faulkner, heard the loud roar of the plane over their homes and then an explosion in the bay and then silence.The Hants Journal, Oct 7, 1931 Fifteen minutes after the crash the lighthouse keeper Faulkner heard screams from the water. The lighthouse keeper made his way to the Noel wharf to see if a rescue boat was available. There was a schooner, however, Faulkner had to wait for an hour before the tide was high enough to push it off. While he waited, the pilots continued to scream. After an hour, as the schooner began to float, the pilots fell silent. After a twelve-hour search, the bodies of the pilots were not found. The only remnant of the plane that was found was the gas tank. A week later, a pilot's body was found by a passing tugboat. Immediately after the event, Thomas Faulkner reported that he thought he could have saved the men had he had a boat ready. The local newspaper reported that the crew were trying to set a record for mail delivery from Europe to New York. = Lighthouse keepers = *Nathan Smith 1859-1873 *William Faulkner 1874-1883 *Fred H.

To commemorate the history of the lighthouse and the site where the highest tides in the world have been recorded, the community rebuilt the lighthouse (1995). Buntcoat Head Park is currently operated by the Municipality of East Hants and operates seasonally during the months May‚ÄìOctober. Burntcoat Head park contains a replica lighthouse and walking trails and displays that interpret the natural and human history of the Minas Basin. The replica lighthouse contains an interpretive centre that provides information about the tides, past lighthouses, and history about the surrounding area. Burntcoat has one of the only two lighthouses remaining in all of Hants county. The other lighthouse is in Walton, Nova Scotia. History =Acadians= Noel Doiron and his family built a chapel in Burntcoat on the west side of the Noel Bay. At this time, Burntcoat was known as \\"Steeple Point\\". The Acadians in the Noel Bay vacated the community in 1750, a year after the founding of Halifax by the British.Shawn Scott and Tod Scott (2008). Noel Doiron and the East Hants Acadians. Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society: The Journal. =Ulster Scots= The first settlers in Burntcoat after the Acadians were three Faulkner brothers, Thomas, William and Robert (Buried in Burntcoat), who were Ulster Scots people. Their paternal grandfather, Edward Faulkner (m.Martha Steward) immigrated from Ireland to Massachusetts, Edward eventually dying in the Battle of Fort Oswego (1756), New York in the Seven Years' War. One of Edward's sons, Robert Faulkner Sr. (m. Hannah Faulkner - parents of Thomas, William and Robert) moved away from Massachusetts and settled with their children across the Cobequid Bay (Glenholme) in the Londonderry Township, Nova Scotia.John Duncanson. Rawdon and Douglas: Two Loyalist Townships in Nova Scotia. 1989, p. 184 =Wooden ships= During the nineteenth century there were a number of shipyards in Burntcoat. The builder of the ship Milton of Kate McArthur fame lived here. Origins of name The origin of the name \\"Burntcoat\\" or \\"Burncoat\\", as the community is sometimes named, is unknown. The derivation of the spelling of the name is also unclear. Today the village on the west side of the Noel Bay is named Burntcoat, however, the Acadians named the village on the east side of the Noel Bay \\"Pointe Brull\\" (i.e., Burnt Point or Burnt Coast). Perhaps the Protestant settlers who came after the exodus of the Acadians from the community confused the names for the east and west side of the Noel Bay and thought the west side of the Bay was \\"Pointe Brull\\". The Acadian name for west side of the Noel Bay (i.e., present day Burntcoat) was \\"Pointe Cloche\\", indicating a chapel was likely located on the west side of the bay at Noel, Nova Scotia.Shawn Scott and Tod Scott (2008).

It was intended to provide the Royal Naval Air Service with an anti-Zeppelin fighter that was also capable of long-range reconnaissance and bombing. Design and development The Avro Pike was a large, three-bay biplane of conventional layout driven by two pusher propellers. Three open cockpits were provided, the centre one for the pilot, with gunners fore and aft of him. The Admiralty evaluated the type, but rejected it. Avro then built a second prototype, substituting the original's Sunbeam engines for Green E.6 engines instead and designated it the 523A. Operational history The Admiralty evaluated this in November 1916, but found that the type was by then obsolete and did not place an order. The two prototypes flew as testbeds with Avro for the remainder of the war. Specifications (523) References =Notes= =Citations= =Bibliography= * Jackson, A.J. Avro Aircraft since 1908.

On the north side, the mountain can be accessed by hikers and bikers through Discovery Lake Park, but this trailhead is closed to motorized vehicles. On the south side, the mountain can be accessed by vehicles through Double Peak Drive, extending from the neighborhood of San Elijo Hills. Both the North and the South access trails offer wide, partially paved surfaces. There is also a less-accessible rock and dirt trail which allows summiting the mountain from the East side. The Eastern trail has a steep incline, with rugged, staircase-like rock extrusions and at some points, loosely packed shale. The Eastern trail can only be accessed by following other trails along either the north or south face of the mountain, around to the eastern face of the mountain. Accessing the mountain from the north side, at Discovery Lake Park, a City of San Marcos information sign states that the length of the trail is from the park to the summit.

General information and history  The original parish church was founded in 1930 as the Russian Orthodox Church of Saint Nicholas. In 1949 the Synod of Bishops authorized the parish to be the church's National War Memorial Shrine and a national campaign to build a monumental Orthodox church in the capital of the United States was begun. The property upon which the cathedral is built was purchased in 1951. The substructure (basement) was completed in 1954 and was used for church services until the superstructure was completed in late 1962. A bell tower commemorating the millennium of Christianity in Russia was dedicated in 1988.  Architecture and iconography  Central dome of St Nicholas Cathedral - Washington, DC The cathedral architecture is based on the 12th century St. Demetrius Cathedral of Vladimir, Russia. Beginning in 1991, dedicated iconographers from Moscow led by Alexander Maskalionov painted icons throughout the nave in the traditional style. This work was completed in 1994.  Location  The cathedral is at 3500 Massachusetts Ave NW at the corner of Edmund Street, in the District of Columbia. The 31,32,and 36 buses stop nearby, whereas the 37, N2, N3,N4,and N6 buses stop directly outside the cathedral at the Massachusetts Avenue-Edmunds St. intersection.

The play was originally commissioned by the Eureka Theater Company, but premiered at Arena Stage on May 10, 1985. In the play, the trial itself is on trial in the court of theater, and is found guilty of a miscarriage of justice. In the actual trial, White was convicted only of a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, rather than two counts of first-degree murder; he was sentenced to less than eight years in prison. The dialogue mentions the urban legend that White's defense strategy was primarily the so-called \\"Twinkie defense\\"‚Äîpainting his junk food consumption as a significant factor in his capacity for murder. The play's Broadway premiere was on March 13, 1986. John Spencer played the role of Dan White. Also among the cast were Wesley Snipes, Stanley Tucci, Mary McDonnell, and Earle Hyman. The set was designed by Ming Cho Lee, costumes by Jennifer von Mayrhauser, lighting by Pat Collins. Execution of Justice won the HBO New Plays USA award, the Helen Hayes Award, the Bay Area Critics Circle Award. It was nominated for a Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle Award. In 1999, Showtime Networks aired a film adaptation of the play, directed by Leon Ichaso and adapted by screenwriter Michael Butler. In 2000, the film won the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding TV Movie or Limited Series. Summary The play is set in the US city of San Francisco in the year 1978. The set is a bare stage with at least one white screen overhead. To the live performance on- stage, it adds video, prerecorded voices, and music. Throughout the performance, the feed from a video camera pointed at the stage is projected onto large screens. The drag nun, an AIDS activist called Sister Boom Boom, is the voice of conscience who represents human rights for all marginalized groups. The dialogue is based on trial transcripts, reportage, and interviews. =Act I: Murder= This act is beginning the trial of Daniel James White, who has assassinated Harvey Milk, the Supervisor of the City and County of San Francisco, California, and George R. Moscone, the Mayor of the City and County of San Francisco, California. The Prosecution and Defense choose a jury, and then present the facts of what has occurred, such as White resigning from his position as the Supervisor of District 8 of San Francisco, and the discussion of his intent to possibly withdraw that resignation. They discuss White's background, where he grew up in San Francisco, served in Vietnam, and was a police officer and fireman in San Francisco. They then discuss the wounds of the victims, and question the witnesses to the shooting of Milk and Moscone. White explains his side of the story, and the end of the act is Dan White, his wife Mary Ann, and the Jurors sobbing. Court then takes a recess. =Act II: In Defense of Murder= This begins with the Prosecution questioning Falzon and his relationship to Dan White. Then the Defense brings in Freitas, Sherrant, and Frediani, to discuss his character and their relationships with him in the past. Then there is a psychiatric defense, and then questioning of his wife, Mary Ann, and her perspective. After all final statements and deliberation of the jury, the court announces Mr. White is sentenced to seven years and eight months, the maximum sentence for two counts of voluntary manslaughter. In the last line of the play, Dan White says: \\"I was always just a lonely vote on the board. I was just trying to do a good job for the city\\".

It is north of Ixworth and from Bury St Edmunds Etymology Coney Weston has a different meaning to other towns with the name Weston: it is not a true Weston (where the origin is from Old English west-tun \\"western farm, village or estate\\") but is a hybrid name, from Old Norse konungr \\"king\\" (cognate with Old English cyning \\"king\\") and Old English tun \\"farm\\". The name was recorded as Cunungestuna in the Domesday Book in 1086. History Coney Weston was recorded in the Domesday book as \\"Cunegestuna\\" in 1086 with a population of 16 households; 12 freemen, 3 smallholders, & 1 slave. RAF Knettishall was built close to Coney Weston from late 1942 by W&G; French and occupied by the USAF 388th Bomb Group from June 1943 until April 1945. Flying Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft they completed 306 missions, losing almost 180 aircraft to enemy action and other causes. Perhaps their most famous aircraft was called Thomas Paine (named after a son of nearby Thetford). Named at a civic ceremony in honour of Paine‚Äôs subsequent contribution to the young American colony‚Äôs quest for independence. This aircraft survived many missions until it overshot the runway and ended up in a field. Despite repairs it was subsequently retired from active service. Current Day Coney Weston is stretched along two roads, Thetford Road (going from the north west to south-east) and The Street (heading east). In 1988 the population of the village was doubled by a boundary change which officially incorporated the Swan end of Barningham into Coney Weston. At present there are 323 people on the electoral roll living in around 150 houses. The small church of St Mary (OS grid TL9778) is of the English Decorated style of the mid-14th century. Its nave roof is thatch on the original scissor truss roof. The tower fell in 1690 and was not rebuilt. It is not known for certain why the church stands a mile to the east away from the village. The church has regular services and is part of the United Benefice of Stanton, Hopton, Market Weston, Barningham & Coney Weston. There are no shops but there is a pub (Swan IP31 1DN), three farms, two builders yards, hairdressers, a cattery, a sawmill and timber yard, a wood sculpture yard, a nursery, a game farm and a telephone exchange. The Swan, on the Thetford Rd has hosted Frogstock in 2009 and may return sometime in the future and a bowls club. For recreation there is a playing field with children‚Äôs playing area, a well-used village hall. There are five public footpaths. The village school was closed in the 1950s but there are primary schools at Barningham and Hopton and secondary schools at Blackbourne Middle School at Stanton and Thurston Upper School.

USFE was originally Eurex US who bought BrokerTec, but applied and received its own futures exchange license from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In October 2006, Man Group bought a majority share of Eurex US and rebranded the exchange U.S. Futures Exchange. It has been working to release a set of new products under a strategy of bringing innovation to the more than century-old derivatives business. The chief executive officer was John Spiegel.  Products  On September 3, 2008, USFE announced an exclusive licensing agreement with Deutsche B√∂rse to launch a mini-sized U.S. dollar-denominated DAX(R) futures contract to be launched October 1, 2008. The new contract carried a $10 multiplier, enabling U.S. futures traders access to a leading German stock market index without currency exposure. On April 18, 2007, USFE launched its first contracts since its rebranding. The first was a Binary Event Future on whether the Chicago Mercantile Exchange would successfully purchase the Chicago Board of Trade. The second was similar except on whether the Intercontinental Exchange would purchase the Chicago Board of Trade. A binary event future settles to 100 if the event occurs and 0 if the event does not occur. The CME-CBOT contract settled on July 13, 2007, to 100 when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade completed a merger and became the CME Group. On March 14, 2007, USFE announced plans to launch futures based on ISE indexes, including the Homebuilders, Gold, SINdex, Revere Natural Gas, and Water Indexes. USFE also announced an exclusive deal with Morningstar to list futures based on their 16 capitalization and style-based indexes on May 23, 2007. On June 28, 2007, USFE announced it would launch a series of renewable energy futures starting with on NORDIX Financial Wind Index futures in seven distinct U.S. regions. All of these futures were due to be released in Q4 of 2007. On September 21, 2007, USFE announced that it would begin trading Spot Equivalent foreign exchange futures on a 23-hour basis. Spot Equivalent Futures are futures which pay out basis nightly so that the futures contract will price the same as a spot contract in the foreign exchange market. However, at the same time, it would trade on a transparent, regulated exchange. The first contracts included Euro (EUR/USD), British pound (GBP/USD), Japanese yen (USD/JPY), Australian Dollar (AUD/USD), Swiss Franc (USD/CHF), and Canadian Dollar (USD/CAD).  Trading platform  USFE was a fully electronic exchange. Its last platform release, USFE 1.0, was based on Eurex 8.0 developed by Deutsche B√∂rse Systems with an additional market allocation algorithm to incentivize liquidity providers.

At the age of sixteen, Munn lied about his age to the Canadian Armed Forces and joined the Black Watch regiment in 1955. Eleven years passed with this regiment, during which Munn served two tours in Germany beginning in March 1962 and ending in June 1965. After serving with the Black Watch he successfully remastered to third field squadron in 1966 to 1968 where he served as one of the first combat divers. In 1968 Munn took his release to study physiology at the University of British Columbia. He rejoined with six Field Squadron RCE and was commissioned from the ranks in January 1970, serving as a Troop Commander and as Squadron Training Officer among other duties. Munn (a Captain at the time) moved to Calgary in 1971 to study medicine at the University of Calgary and received his MD in 1974. During this time he joined the staff of Headquarters South Alberta District. In 1974 Munn was promoted to the rank of Major and posted to the Kings Own Calgary Regiment where he served as a squadron training commander and deputy commander until 1977. In 1977 he was again transferred and posted to 14 Service Battalion where he served as deputy commander until 1980 when he was made commanding officer and given the freedom of the City of Calgary. In 1979 Munn received his Fellowship in the Royal College of Physicians of Canada in the field of anesthesia. This was quickly followed by his multi-engine pilots license and flight surgeon status. He added to this interest by becoming qualified in hyperbaric medicine. Munn was appointed aide-de-camp to the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Alberta in April 1980. Munn made the choice to retire from the Militia in June 1982 and subsequently served as Vice President of the Army Cadet League of Alberta from 1982‚Äì1984 and President of the Alberta Branch of the Defense Medical Association of Canada from 1984- 1986. In 1991 Munn was appointed Honorary Colonel of 15 Field Ambulance and in 1994 became the first reserve anesthesiologist to be posted on a UN relief mission in Bosnia. Munn was elected President of the Defense Medical Association in 1996 and, that same year, was admitted to the Venerable Order of Saint John. He joined the staff of the University of Alberta Hospitals in Edmonton in 1998 where he was an Assistant Clinical Professor in the Faculty of Medicine. Munn was a Knight Commander in the Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, past Grand Prior of the Priory of Canada, Honorary Physician to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. and Grand Counselor to the Sovereign Counsel and recipient of the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal. =Degrees, diplomas, and certificates= FRCPC, Anesthesia, 1979 LMCC,1976 MD, University of Calgary, 1974 Flight Surgeon, Defense and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine, 1993 Neonatal Resuscitation - Provider, UAH, 1995 ATLS Qualification, RAH 1987 ACLS Re- qualification, GMCC, 1987 Shallow Water Diving Land Forces, Medical Officers' Course, Defense and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine, 1976 Mast.

Originating in the southern Greek port city of Kalamata, its most recognizable feature is its asymmetrical time signature of time, meaning that there are seven beats per measure, generally subdivided into two groups of 3 and 4 beats respectively. Although this rhythmic structure is unfamiliar to westerners, it is thoroughly at home in Greece, Cyprus and the surrounding countries. The kalamatiano is a traditional line dance admitting of varying speeds. Probably the best known folk song in this genre is Mandili Kalamatiano (ŒúŒ±ŒΩœÑŒÆŒªŒπ ŒöŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ±ŒΩœå).

It did not proceed past the prototype stage. Design and development The Spider was a sesquiplane with a largely conventional configuration, but it used Warren truss-type interplane struts, hence the appellation \\"Spider\\". In tests, the aircraft demonstrated exceptional performance, handling, and pilot visibility. By the time it flew, the War Office had already selected the Sopwith Snipe for mass production. A second, refined version, the Avro 531A, apparently never was completed, but some of its components seem to have been used to build a derivative design, the Avro 538. This had standard interplane struts and was intended as a racing aircraft. It was never used for this purpose, however, because it was discovered that it had a faulty wing spar, so the Avro firm used it as a hack instead from May 1919 to September 1920.Donald, p. 77.

The Attorney General serves as the state‚Äôs top law enforcement officer and consumer advocate. Since January 13, 2015, the Attorney General of Arkansas has been Leslie Rutledge. History The Attorney General was not originally a state constitutional officer but rather was created by Act 1 of 1843, which designated the Arkansas Attorney for the Fifth Judicial District as the attorney general. The first Attorney General of Arkansas was Robert W. Johnson. The Arkansas Constitution of 1868 made the post elective, though it required only that the attorney general ‚Äúperform such duties as are now, or may hereafter, be prescribed by law.‚Äù This was reaffirmed in the constitution of 1874. Act 131 of 1911 laid out four general responsibilities of the attorney general‚Äôs office: 1) to give opinions to state officers and agencies ‚Äúupon any constitutional or other legal question that may concern the official action of said officers‚Äù; 2) to defend the interest of the state in federal court and representing all state officers, boards, and commissions in litigation involving the interests of the state; 3) to furnish any board or commission an opinion as to the validity of the title on any land they seek to purchase; and 4) to make a biennial report to the governor and the Arkansas General Assembly on all transactions of the attorney general‚Äôs office. Role and duties The Attorney General represents state agencies and commissions in courts of law, giving opinions on issues presented by legislators and prosecutors, handling criminal matters and habeas corpus matters in the state, and advocating for citizens on issues pertaining to the environment, antitrust, and consumer protection.

Acquisition by the U.S. Navy She was acquired by the United States Navy from her owner, Philadelphia & Norfolk Steamship Co., at Boston, Massachusetts on 5 May 1941; renamed Miantonomah on 14 May 1941; converted for U.S. Navy use as a coastal minelayer by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., East Boston, Massachusetts; and commissioned at Boston on 13 November 1941, Lieutenant Commander Raymond D. Edwards in command. East Coast operations After completing conversion and following shakedown, Miantonomah steamed to the Virginia Capes where on 11 January 1942 she began laying her first minefield with . Operating out of Yorktown, Virginia, she joined in the effort to reduce the German submarine menace along the east coast, and during the next several months sowed mines off Cape Hatteras and Key West, Florida. In addition, defensive mining operations sent her to the southern reaches of the Caribbean off Trinidad. Reclassified CM-10 on 15 May 1942, she continued duty with Mine Division 50 and in October completed preparations for oversea combat duty. Invasion of North Africa Loaded with a full cargo of mines, Miantonomah departed Yorktown on 23 October and the next day joined the Center Attack Group (TG 34.9) of the Western Naval Task Force. Heavy seas forced the minelayer out of the convoy south of the Azores on 4 November; escorted by , she rejoined the task force on 7 November as ships approached to launch a three-pronged invasion of French Morocco. Miantonomah arrived off Fedala late on the 7th and ‚Äî because of her cargo ‚Äî remained clear of the transport area. Following the pre-dawn amphibious landings, and the subsequent neutralization of shore batteries by intense accurate naval gunfire, she laid down a defensive minefield north and east of the transport area about noon on 8 November, thence anchored in Fedala Harbor. She remained at Fedala during the next few days and escaped damage from two German submarine attacks on 11‚Äì12 November, although three torpedoes on the 11th passed within of her. These attacks by and sank four U.S. ships and damaged two others. From 12‚Äì15 November, she steamed in convoy to Casablanca. After loading mines from , she joined Monadnock and Terror and on the 16th extended the Fedala minefield along the Moroccan coast to Casablanca. The next morning she departed Casablanca and sailed with other ships of TG 34.9 for the United States. Heavy seas pounded her badly but she arrived at Yorktown on 30 November. Return to Stateside Miantonomah underwent repairs at Norfolk from 8 December 1942 ‚Äì 19 January 1943, then resumed duty out of Yorktown in Chesapeake Bay and along the Virginia coast. She operated out of Boston, Massachusetts from 9 April to 25 May and returned to Yorktown on 29 May to prepare for minelaying operations in the Caribbean. She departed on 14 June, reached Trinidad on the 20th, and later in the month sowed mines to protect the approaches to that important American base. She returned to the Chesapeake Bay on 28 July and operated out of Yorktown during the next nine months. On 29 April, she sailed to Bayonne, New Jersey; thence, as a unit of TG 27.1, she departed Gravesend Bay, New Jersey on 5 May to support the Allied invasion of Europe. Invasion of Europe operations Miantonomah arrived Bristol, England on 16 May and began duty with the 12th Fleet. She operated out of Bristol until D-Day, 6 June, when she steamed via Cardiff to Plymouth, England. She continued dispatch and escort duties in British waters until arriving off Grandcamp, France on 25 June. There she embarked Rear Admiral John E. Wilkes and became flagship for CTF 125. She steamed to Cherbourg on 9 July, and on the 18th Admiral Wilkes hauled down his flag prior to Miantonomahs departure to England. Arriving Plymouth, later that day, Miantonomah returned to Cherbourg on the 20th carrying supplies for port clearance operations. For more than two months, she made runs between English and liberated French ports and provided valuable support for salvage and clearing operations. On 21 September, she carried port clearance supplies from Cherbourg to Le Havre, which was liberated by sea and land less than two weeks before. Sunk by a mine off the French coast Miantonomah sailed early in the afternoon of the 25th. Because of the danger of enemy mines, her skipper ‚Äî Cdr. Austin E. Rowe ‚Äî ordered \\"the highest state of watertight integrity to be set and all personnel not actually on watch below to be on topside and wear lifejackets\\" ‚Äî measures which undoubtedly saved many lives. With a French harbor pilot at the conn, she skillfully navigated the inner and outer harbors and cleared the blockships, thence made course for the entrance to the marked channel. As she steamed about out from the blockships, she was rocked at 14:15 by a tremendous underwater explosion under the engine room. This blast ‚Äî possibly followed by a second one ‚Äî dazed or injured practically the entire crew. Immediately, the stricken ship began to sink rapidly by the stern and to starboard. Damage control efforts proved useless, and as Coast Guard vessels, British motor launches, and a French fishing craft stood by to rescue survivors, her injured skipper ordered Miantonomah to be abandoned. She sank about 20 minutes after the explosion with a loss of some 58 officers and men at position . Awards Miantonomah received two battle stars for her World War II service.

His teachings have inspired riders and trainers all over the world to adopt the 'baroque' or 'classical' style of working with the horse; an art which goes back hundreds of years and encompasses the fundamentals which most 'modern' disciplines can be traced back to. Nuno was born in Lisbon on 23 June 1925. He studied riding under Joaquim Goncalves de Miranda, in the style of the riding academy of Versailles. A great teacher, he possessed a near-encyclopedic knowledge of equestrian theory that crossed many styles and countries. His principal influences were Fran√ßois Robichon de La Gu√©rini√®re, Gustav Steinbrecht and Fran√ßois Baucher. Oliveira was offered, but declined, the post of director of the Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre. On 2 February 1989 he was discovered dead in his bed in a hotel in Perth, Western Australia. He enjoyed opera music when riding especially Verdi.

Early life She was born Nobuko Uenishi in Kobe, Japan, the daughter of parents Keiji and Sodako. She attended Waseda University and later New York University from 1961 to 1963 where she received her Masters in drama. International flavour Through her theatre work she helped to bring several adaptations of Western plays to Japan, beginning in 1963 with Gone with the Wind. Other plays include: Fiddler on the Roof (1964), Les Mis√©rables (1987), Oscar (1994), as well translator into Japanese of Oliver! (1968) and Miss Saigon (1992). Despite being a native of Japan, she has lived abroad most of her life and considers herself an outsider to Japan. This enabled her to bring a different perspective to theatre in Japan by challenging how plays are produced there and what Japanese audiences will respond to. Personal life Her first husband was author Ivan Morris (son of author Ira Victor Morris, grandson of diplomat Ira Nelson Morris, and great-grandson of meat-packer Nelson Morris). She later married Sir Donald Albery.

It prefers dense woodland and forest of either indigenous or exotic trees. Description The male is blackish-brown above with a grey mantle and chest with a blackish crest, the underparts are white marked with broad chestnut bars. The tail is black with three grey bars and grey and white tip. The females are browner with paler chestnut bars on the underparts. Distinctive in flight as a small raptor with a small head with broad, narrowly rounded wings and a medium length tail. Wingspan is just over double the body length, females are slightly larger than males. In flight Distribution and subspecies The African cuckoo-Hawk is found across much of sub-Saharan Africa, and the following subspecies are recognised: *A. c. subsp. cuculoides ‚Äì Senegal to southwestern Ethiopia and northern DRC *A. c. subsp. batesi ‚Äì Sierra Leone to Uganda and northern Angola *A. c. subsp. verreauxii ‚Äì Kenya to Namibia and eastern South Africa Habitat The African cuckoo-hawk is a shy species which occurs in the interior and edges of evergreen forest and deciduous woodlands, including suburban gardens and more open savannas, up to . When migrating through east Africa it also occurs in drier woodland and bush. Biology The African cuckoo-hawk is largely sedentary but during April‚ÄìNovember some migrate northwards to East Africa, in particular to coastal Kenya and outside the breeding season some migrate to southern Africa, especially to the Transvaal Highveld. The breeding season varies by geography; in southern Africa breeding happens during September to March; in west Africa the season is June to August; while in Kenya there are two breeding periods per year, the first in March to June and the second from November to February, timed to follow the two rainy seasons. The African cuckoo-hawk's general behaviour is little known, as this species occurs at low densities and has secretive habits, although they are slightly more conspicuous during migration and so may appear more numerous. The African cuckoo-hawk mainly eats reptiles and insects, it hunts within the canopy by flying from tree to tree, searching from a perch before flying to pluck the prey item from the canopy or ground. The following food items have been recorded in its diet: flap-necked chameleon Chamaeleo dilepsis, the southern dwarf chameleon Brachypodion ventrale, lizards, snakes, frogs, fish, fruit bats, mice, birds, grasshoppers and locusts, stick insects, silverfish larvae, caterpillars, mantids and freshwater crabs. The African cuckoo-hawk is a monogamous, solitary nester, belying its secretive reputation by performing spectacular aerial displays as the breeding season approaches. The nest is constructed by both sexes in 11 days and consists of an untidy platform of twigs, vines and leaves which is lined with leaves, grass and small sticks. It is normally placed in the highest branches of a tree, usually between above the ground. Normally only one or two eggs are laid, occasionally three, the chicks are fed and brooded by both parents, before they leave the nest after 28 days and take their first flight a few days after that. The juveniles remain dependent on their parents for about a week after their first flight. Wahlberg's eagle Hieraaetus wahlbergi has been recorded preying on the chicks of the African cuckoo-hawk.

Anand. The film stars Amitabh Bachchan and Sridevi in the lead roles. Akkineni Nagarjuna, Shilpa Shirodkar, and Danny Denzongpa are featured in supporting roles. The original score was composed by Laxmikant‚ÄìPyarelal. The film marked Sridevi and Bachchan's third collaboration. In the film; Badshah Khan travels from Afghanistan to India to find the killer of Benazir's father so that he can impress her. He succeeds but soon finds himself framed for a murder and trapped in an Indian prison. Khuda Gawah was released theatrically on May 7, 1992. The film was praised for its direction, screenplay, performances, music and production. It was a major commercial success, grossing 17.05 crore worldwide, becoming the second highest grossing Indian film of 1992.http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/topgrossersbyyear.asp?year=1992 It entered Limca Book of Records as the first Indian film to use surround sound technique. The film was dubbed in Telugu and was later adapted into a Pakistani television series, by the same name. It is one of the most watched Indian films in Afghanistan's history. The film received nine nominations at the 38th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film and won three: Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Denzongpa) and Best Sound. Both Sridevi and Bachchan were honored by the Afghan government. Plot During a Buzkashi competition with a neighbouring tribe in Afghanistan, Badshah Khan (Amitabh Bachchan) falls in love with Benazir (Sridevi) and wants to marry her. Benazir agrees to marry him, on the condition that he must bring her the head of Habibullah, who killed her father. Badshah Khan goes to India to search for Habibullah. He finds Habibullah in a prison and breaks him out to take him back. He has the jailor Ranveer Singh (Vikram Gokhale) on his trail. He chops off Habibullah's head. When confronted by Ranveer, he tells him that he would be back in a month to receive punishment for taking Habibullah. Badshah goes back to Afghanistan and marries Benazir; after the time limit, he comes back to India and surrenders himself to Ranveer Singh, who he addresses as \\"Rajput Khan\\" and is jailed for five years. While Badshah Khan is away, his childhood friend Khuda Baksh (Danny Denzongpa) assumes the role of a guardian for Benazir. To avenge Habibullah's death, his brother Pasha (Kiran Kumar) kidnaps Heena, the daughter of jailor Ranveer, ransoming her in return for Badshah. Badshah finds out about this and escapes from jail; he confronts Pasha, only to have Inspector Aziz Mirza (Bharat Kapoor) kill Ranveer Singh. With Ranveer Singh's daughter as a pawn in Pasha's hands, Badshah admits to killing Ranveer Singh and is sentenced to 15 years. When Aziz's wife (who thinks of Badshah as her brother) visits him, she ends up killing her husband to protect Badshah, but Badshah takes the blame for that murder as well, since he believes that her son Raja needs her. At that time, Benazir sends Khuda Baksh to check on Badshah. Due to his very long stay in prison, Badshah makes Khuda Baksh promise to take care of his daughter Mehndi and tell his wife Benazir that he is now dead so that she can move on rather than wait for him. Benazir goes mad when she hears the news that her husband is dead. On coming out of prison, Badshah meets with his now grown daughter, Mehndi (also Sridevi), who has found out that her father is still alive and has come to India to look for her father; the daughter of Ranveer Singh, Heena (Shilpa Shirodkar), who is also in the police force and knows all about Badshah's past and respects him as her uncle; and the son of Inspector Aziz Mirza, Inspector Raja Mirza (Nagarjuna), who has found out that it was Badshah who had killed his father and is out for vengeance. In a twist of fate, Raja is in love with Mehndi, even though he wants to kill her father. Pasha, now a major crime lord, gets involved. Benazir and Khuda Baksh are kidnapped by him. The truth is eventually revealed to Raja about his father, and he joins of hands with Badshah and Heena to kill their mutual enemy. Badshah and Benazir grab one arm each of Pasha as they ride on separate horses like the beginning of the film and throw him into a huge rock, killing him. They ride off into the sunset, finally together.

He was a professor of psychology at Harvard University and a fellow of both the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was known for applying experimental psychology to the topics of mental control (for example ironic process theory) and conscious will,\\"More than good intentions: Holding fast to faith in free will\\", The New York Times 31 December 2002. and for originating the study of transactive memory and action identification. In The Illusion of Conscious Will and other works, he argued that the human sense of free will is an illusion. Early life and education Wegner was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. When Wegner was 11 years old he developed an understanding of two types of scientists: \\"bumblers, who plod along, only once in a while accomplishing something but enjoying the process even if they often end up being wrong, and the pointers, who do only one thing: point out that the bumblers are bumbling.\\"Wegner DM. The premature demise of the solo experiment. Pers Soc Psychol Bull. 1992;18:504-508 in: Lisa Rosenbaum. The March of Science ‚Äî The True Story. NEJM, May 17, 2017,DOI: 10.1056/NEJMms1706087 He enrolled in a physics degree at Michigan State University but changed to psychology, going on to an M.A. and then a PhD. Career After gaining his doctorate in 1974, he spent sixteen years teaching at Trinity University, becoming a full Professor in 1985. From 1990 to 2000, he researched and taught at the University of Virginia, after which he joined the faculty at Harvard University.Profile of Dan Wegner , Institute of Psychology, University of Freiburg =Awards= In 2011, Wegner was awarded the William James Fellow Award by the Association for Psychological Science, the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award by the American Psychological Association, and the Distinguished Scientist Award by the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. In 2012, he was awarded the Donald T. Campbell Award by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP). Furthermore, shortly after Wegner's death in 2013, SPSP announced that its annually awarded Theoretical Innovation Prize would henceforth be known as the Daniel M. Wegner Theoretical Innovation Prize to honor Wegner's memory and his innovative work. Research =Ironic process theory= Wegner and colleagues performed a series of experiments in which people tried to suppress thoughts, for example by attempting not to think of a white bear. That work revealed that attempting not to think of a topic often backfires, resulting in high rates of intrusive thoughts about the topic. Wegner coined the term \\"ironic mental processes\\" for this effect, which is also known more commonly as the \\"white bear phenomenon\\".Wegner DM, Schneider DJ, Carter SR III, White TL. Paradoxical effects of thought suppression. J Pers Soc Psychol. 1987;53:5-13 The effect contributes to various psychological challenges and disorders. Smokers who try not to think about cigarettes find it harder to give up. People who suppress thoughts that may cause an anxiety reaction often make those thoughts more intrusive. Wegner found that the ironic effect is stronger when people are stressed or depressed. =The illusion of conscious will= Wegner conducted a series of experiments in which people experience an illusion of control, feeling that their will shapes events which are actually determined by someone else. He argued controversially that the ease with which this illusion can be created shows that the everyday feeling of conscious will is an illusion or a \\"construction\\" and that this illusion of mental causation is \\"the mind's best trick\\". Wegner defined conscious will as a function of priority (the thought must come before the action), consistency (the thought must be consistent with the action), and exclusivity (the thought cannot be accompanied with other causes). He argued that, although people may feel that conscious intentions drive much of their behavior, in reality both behavior and intentions are the product of other, unconscious mental processes. Wegner's research agreed with previous findings by Benjamin Libet regarding brain readiness potential and concluded that his own findings were \\"compatible with the idea that brain events cause intention and action, whereas conscious intention itself may not cause action.\\" =Apparent mental causation= Wegner argued that the feeling of intention is something attributed \\"after the fact\\" according to three principles: consistency, exclusivity, and priority. The principle of consistency states that if the content of one's thoughts is relevant to one's action, then a feeling of control will occur. The exclusivity principle holds that one must not believe there to be an outside influence or cause to feel as though an action was intended. Finally, the priority principle requires the thought to occur right before the action to produce the illusion of free will. He did not claim that conscious thought cannot in principle cause action, merely that any connection between conscious thought and action should be determined by scientific enquiry, and not by unreliable introspection and feelings. =Transactive memory= In 1985, Wegner proposed the concept of transactive memory. A transactive memory system is a system through which groups collectively encode, store, and retrieve knowledge.Wegner, D. M., Giuliano, T., & Hertel, P. (1985). Cognitive interdependence in close relationships. In W. J. Ickes (Ed.), Compatible and incompatible relationships (pp. 253‚Äì276). New York: Springer-Verlag. Transactive memory suggests an analysis not only of how couples and families in close relationships coordinate memory and tasks at home, but how teams, larger groups and organizations come to develop a \\"group mind\\", a memory system that is more complex and potentially more effective than that of any of the individuals that comprise it. According to Wegner, a transactive memory system consists of the knowledge stored in each individual's memory combined with metamemory containing information regarding the different teammate's domains of expertise. Just as the individual's metamemory allows him to be aware of what information is available for retrieval, so does the transactive memory system provide teammates with information regarding the knowledge they have access to within the team.Wegner, D. M. (1986). Transactive memory: A contemporary analysis of the group mind. In B.Mullen & G. R. Goethals (Eds.), Theories of group behavior (pp. 185‚Äì205). New York: Springer-Verlag Group members learn who knowledge experts are and how to access expertise through communicative processes. In this way, a transactive memory system can provide the group members with more and better knowledge than any individual could access on his or her own. Death Trinity University announced Wegner's death on Friday, July 5, 2013, at his home in Massachusetts, of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.

OIMB is a member of the National Association of Marine Laboratories (NAML). In addition to graduate research, undergraduate classes are offered year round, including marine birds and mammals, estuarine biology, marine ecology, invertebrate zoology, molecular biology, biology of fishes, biological oceanography, and embryology. The Loyd and Dorothy Rippey Library, one of eight branches of the UO Libraries, was added to the campus in 1999. The Rippey Library is open to the public by appointment, and the Oregon Card Program allows Oregon residents 16 years old and over to borrow from the collection. The Charleston Marine Life Center (or CMLC), currently under construction, will be a public museum and aquarium on the edge of the harbor in Charleston, OR, across the street from the OIMB campus. Displays aimed at visitors of all ages will emphasize the diversity of animal and plant life in local marine ecosystems. Visitors will learn where to interact with marine organisms in their natural environments and how local scientists study the life histories, evolution and ecology of underwater plants and animals.  History  Photograph of Oregon Coast near OIMB Marine Lab The University of Oregon first established OIMB as a summer research and education program in 1924, operating out of tents along the beach of Sunset Bay. OIMB settled into its current location in 1931, when 100 acres of the Coos Head Military Reserve, including several buildings from the Army Corps of Engineers, was deeded to the University of Oregon. In 1937, OIMB was transferred to Oregon State College (now Oregon State University), and remained theirs until the federal government required the property during World War II. Following the war, OIMB was initially returned to Oregon State University, but the University of Oregon reclaimed it in 1955 as a summer research facility. Since 1966, OIMB has been expanding its educational programs and its campus, constructing more teaching and research facilities and developing year-round educational programs. Notably, the Loyd and Dorothy Rippey Library was built in 1999, and construction of the Charleston Marine Life Center began in 2012.

The last two seasons aired under the title The Geraldo Rivera Show. The series was a production of Investigative News Group and distributed by Tribune Entertainment. For its first three seasons, Paramount Domestic Television served as co-distributor. For its final two seasons, King World Productions assisted Tribune as co-distributor. Controversy In November 3, 1988, an episode involving white supremacists, anti-racist skinheads, black activists, and Jewish activists was aired. A confrontation between John Metzger (the son of Tom Metzger) and Roy Innis (in which Metzger goaded Innis by referring to him as \\"Uncle Tom\\") led to Innis walking over to Metzger and forcefully grabbing him by the neck after Metzger stood up in Innis‚Äô face, and subsequently, a full-scale brawl broke out. Audience members, several stage hands, and Rivera himself got involved. In the process, Rivera was struck in the face by a chair and wound up with a broken nose. He did not press charges, saying he did not wish to be \\"tied up with the roaches\\", and also claiming \\"if there ever was a case of deserved violence, this was it\\". The ratings for this show increased as news of the fight attracted attention to the episode even before it aired. In August 1992, Rivera would scuffle with KKK members again at a Klan rally in Janesville, Wisconsin. Rivera suffered cuts and a bite to one of his thumbs.When Geraldo comes to town: KKK fight put Janesville in national spotlight Charges against Geraldo Rivera dropped Parodies/In popular culture *The 1989 film UHF, starring \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, parodies Geraldo, including the infamous 1988 brawl. *\\"What Comes Around\\", a song by the Beastie Boys from their 1989 album Paul's Boutique, features the lyric, \\"You're all mixed up like pasta primavera/Yo why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera?\\" *The season 2 opener of Saved by the Bell features Kelly's dream sequence in which Screech Powers (Dustin Diamond) is now Geraldo Screech at Bayside, which takes place at The Max. *The Family Guy episode \\"Fifteen Minutes of Shame\\", which featured the Griffins appearing on a talk show, parodied the infamous 1988 brawl by having Peter shout \\"Who are you calling 'Uncle Tom'?!\\" and throwing a chair. *In a season five episode of Empty Nest titled \\"Dirty Harry\\", Rivera appears as himself and mocks the brawl.

The Selection Panel is composed of a Bishop, a Priest, two members of the laity, and a representative of the Church of Ireland Theological College. Candidates can be men or women from any of the dioceses in the Church of Ireland, seeking either to enter stipendiary ministry or non-stipendary ministry (NSM). Prospective candidates generally must be a member of their diocese's Fellowship of Vocation for at least one year before their Bishop will consider putting them forward for the Selection Conference, who does so on the recommendation of their Diocesan Director of Ordinands (DDO) and after satisfactory performance at psychological and academic testing at a Pre- Selection Conference, usually held in January. Interview questions are tailored for each candidate but follow general themes: spirituality, understanding of vocation, vision and leadership, etc. After interviewing each candidate, the Selection Panel can make one of four recommendations to his or her Bishop: # Recommended for training # Conditional recommendation for training #Not recommended for training # Defer the decision until the following year The Bishops are not bound by the recommendations of the Selection Conference. Candidates recommended for training may commence theological study within three years of their acceptance. Candidates not recommended for training generally must wait for two years before re-applying (in which case the new Selection Panel is not informed of their previous application).

He performed experiments on cadavers and discovered that stress to the anterior inferior tibiofibular ligament could lead to this type of avulsion fracture. This fracture is unique because it occurs during a certain period of adolescence, when there is a differential rate of growth of the epiphysis. In honor of his discovery, a fracture of the anteriolateral tibial epiphysis is now called a Tillaux fracture  often misdiagnosed as a simple sprain.

Samuel Jay Crumbine (September 17, 1862 ‚Äì July 12, 1954) was a pioneer in public health who campaigned against the common drinking cup, the common towel, and spitting in public in order to prevent the spread of tuberculosis and other germs. Crumbine was born at Emlenton, Pennsylvania on Sept. 17, 1862, the son of Samuel D. Crumbine and Sarah (Mull) Crumbine, both natives of Pennsylvania. His mother was of German and English descent; his father, who was of German descent and a mechanic, served in the Union Army during the American Civil War as a member of the One Hundred and Third Pennsylvania infantry, being first sergeant of Company H. He was captured by the Confederates and confined in Libby prison, where he died of sickness, his death occurring prior to the birth of his son, Samuel. The mother of Crumbine died in Pennsylvania, in 1902, aged sixty-two years. At the age of twenty-one, Crumbine entered the Cincinnati College of Medicine and Surgery, where he worked his way through and graduated in 1888. Upon receiving his diploma, he moved to Kansas and engaged in the practice of his profession at Dodge City. While there, he was appointed to the State Board of Health by Gov. W. E. Stanley. Then on Sept. 1, 1911, he assumed the duties of Dean of the School of Medicine of the University of Kansas. Dr. Crumbine was married Sept. 17, 1890, his twenty- eighth birthday, to Miss Catharine Zuercher, of Cincinnati, Ohio. They had two children: Warren, born Jan. 29, 1892, and Violet, born March 5, 1896. Image:nmhm-brick.jpgBrick - \\"Don't Spit on the Sidewalk\\" in the collection of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, AFIP in Washington, DC Life in Dodge City Dr. Crumbine began his medical practice ‚Äúin rip-roaring, untamed Dodge City during its heyday,‚Äù the late 1880s and early 1890s. Fresh from medical school in 1885, he was taken on a tour of the saloons in the unsavory South Side. ‚ÄúI heard peals of laughter,‚Äù he related in later days, ‚Äústaccato calls of the floor manager, occasional whoops of cowboys, and constant shuffling of heavy boots. At one end of the hall was a bar, doing a rushing business. At the other, on a small platform, was an orchestra‚Äîfiddle, guitar and banjo. The women were house entertainers, servants or demimondes.‚Äù Dr. Crumbine was the model for \\"Doc Adams\\" on the long running TV show \\"Gunsmoke\\". The legendary lawmen of Dodge City‚ÄîWyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Luke Short and Bill Tilghman‚Äîwere his contemporaries. On one occasion, he saw Tilghman through a severe siege of pneumonia. The lawman became one of the few to live to a ripe old age. Life after Dodge City He moved to Topeka to become secretary of the Kansas Board of Health and eventually became nationally known for his work with the U.S. Public Health Service. He is the inventor of the flyswatter, an improvement on the earlier \\"flybat\\" produced by Frank H. Rose. In 1905, he titled one of his fly bulletins, which warned of flyborne diseases, ‚ÄúSwat the Fly,‚Äù after a chant he heard at a ballgame. Crumbine took an invention known as the Fly Bat ‚Äî a screen attached to a yardstick ‚Äî and renamed it the Fly Swatter, which became the generic term we use today. He died in New York City in 1954. Family Dr. Crumbine had two children: Violet (March 5, 1896 ‚Äì May 13, 1973) and Warren (January 29, 1892 ‚Äì February 16, 1916), both of whom were born in Dodge City, Kansas.

It is located just a few kilometres west of the town of Bonnyville.Note there is a second body of water named Moose Lake 65 km NW of Fort Mackay. Name Moose Lake was known to early French-Canadian fur traders as Lac d'Orignal, meaning Moose Lake. This in turn may have been a direct translation of the local Cree name of the same meaning, M≈çswa sƒÅkahikan. History Around 1768 William Pink passed the mouth of the Mooselake River. In 1789 Angus Shaw of the North West Company built a post on the northwest shore of the lake called Fort Lac L'Orignal or Shaw House. It was close to where the Mooslake river enters Franchere Bay. The river was so shallow that canoes were taken up the river empty and goods portaged overland. It was in good beaver country and within easy reach of Fort George 35 miles to the south on the North Saskatchewan. Buffalo pemmican was carried north to the lake and then via the Beaver River to Lac √éle-√†-la-Crosse to feed the voyageurs on their long journey to Lake Athabasca. In the 1792-93 season Moose Lake produced 64 of the 392 total packs of beaver produced by the Churchill River Department. In 1798 David Thompson reached the lake from Fort George. Geography The major inflow is the Thinlake River, which enters the westernmost point of the lake in Franchere Bay, and the major outflow is the Mooselake River which exits the lake through the northern shore of Franchere Bay. Moose Lake Provincial Park straddles the point separating Franchere Bay and Vezeau Bay and its western edge is the Mooselake River.Alberta Tourism. Moose Lake Provincial Park Most of the shoreline development is on the eastern shores of Vezeau Bay and Bonnyville Beach, comprising several unincorporated communities including Pelican Narrows. There are several Christian summer camps on Franchere Bay, including a Baptist, Pentecostal, and a Roman Catholic camp on the North shore and a Ukrainian Orthodox camp on the South shore. Fishing The lake supports some commercial fishing and recreational fishing is also popular. Sport fish in Moose Lake include Northern Pike, Lake Whitefish, Walleye, and Perch. There is a yearly Walleye tournament in the lake that speaks to the abundance of recreational fishing.

After being used by Lindbergh in Europe it was impressed into service with Royal Air Force as a communications aircraft in 1941. Design and development In 1936, after Lindbergh had moved to England, he asked George Miles to build a fast, long-range machine for use between the various capitals. As a result of close co-operation between the pilot and designer, a first-class design was produced.Berg 1998, p. 362. The M.12 Mohawk followed earlier Miles Nighthawk and Miles Hawcon designs and practice in having a low wing cantilever monoplane design of spruce structure covered in plywood. The centre section had no dihedral and of constant section, with outer sections having dihedral and taper towards the tip. The fuselage was similarly a spruce structure with plywood covering. The M.12 was a conventional taildragger with fixed main wheels, each encased in an aerodynamic fairing beneath the wing and featuring a tail wheel. As a purpose- built aircraft to Lindbergh's specifications and in incorporating an American 200 hp Menasco Buccaneer B6S engine to the classic Miles low-wing configuration,Lukins and Russell 1945, pp. 40‚Äì41. the M.12 was distinctly an Anglo-American machine.\\"Miles M 12 Mohawk performance and specifications.\\" Certified Aircraft Database. Retrieved: 30 May 2013. A second set of Miles M.12 wings were used in the M.7A hybrid.Mosley 1976, p. 213. Operational history The Miles Mohawk at the Royal Air Force Museum, London. The M.12 was registered G-AEKW on 17 July 1936 but it first flew on 22 August 1936, wearing the test serial U8.Amos 2009, pp. 243‚Äì254. The Mohawk received its certificate of airworthiness on 28 January 1937 and started a series of test flights, including flights by Lindbergh. On 1 February 1937, the aircraft was officially handed over to Lindbergh at a ceremony at Woodley. As soon as the aircraft was handed over, Lindbergh and his wife departed in it on a trip to India. In the following few years, the Lindberghs flew the aircraft all over Europe until Charles Lindbergh flew it in to Woodley on 4 April 1939, placing the aircraft in storage as Lindbergh returned to the United States. In August 1939, the aircraft was inspected by the Air Ministry for possible impressment into military service. On 31 October 1941, it was impressed into service with the Royal Air Force and given the military serial number HM503. The aircraft was delivered to RAF Turnhouse in Scotland on 8 November 1941. Following the installation of a Fairey-Reed propeller in May 1943, it was delivered to RAF Andover for use by the Maintenance Command Communications Squadron. The M.12 was little used because of difficulties with the Menasco Buccaneer engine, and when the squadron moved to Babdown Farm, they left the Mohawk at Andover. In February 1944, the aircraft was delivered to No. 5 Maintenance Unit at RAF Kemble for storage and was not flown by the RAF again. In May 1946, the Mohawk was bought by Southern Aircraft (Gatwick) Limited and following refurbishment was advertised for sale in July 1947. In August 1947, the Mohawk was flown into second place at the Folkstone Trophy Air Race at a speed of 138.5 mph. By October 1949, the aircraft was owned by Bruno Pini who along with Neville Browning flew it to North Africa to participate in the Oran International Rally. On 1 January 1950, on the journey home, they were forced to land the aircraft in Spain. Although the aircraft had little damage, it was abandoned, with the pair returning to England. The Miles Mohawk was not to fly again. In 1973, the Miles Mohawk was discovered in a junkyard near Seville and was rescued by Lew Casey, a curator at the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum, and taken to the United States for restoration. After many moves and a slow restoration effort, Casey decided to donate the Mohawk to the Royal Air Force Museum. In October 2002, the aircraft was shipped to the United Kingdom and the museum began restoring the aircraft for static display. In August 2008, the restored aircraft was put on display at the \\"Milestones of Flight\\" exhibition at the RAF Museum Hendon.

A critical success but commercial failure at the time, no further episodes were commissioned beyond the initial eight but following the success of Ocelot's Kirikou and the Sorceress six were edited into the 2000 compilation movie Princes et princesses (Princes and Princesses), in which form they finally saw wide exposure and acclaim both in France and internationally; a further episode was included in a home release of short works in 2008 but one remains unavailable for public consumption. It is the first of Ocelot's projects to be filmed entirely in silhouette, an aesthetic he has since become particularly associated with, continuing in it and the \\"actor\\" conceit with 1992's Tales of the Night and conceiving Kirikou and the Sorceress as such, returning to it fully with the continuation of Cin√© si he had always planned for in the form of Dragons et princesses.

But in order to free the princess from the curse placed upon her, one would have to find all one-hundred and eleven of the diamonds which make up her broken necklace. Many princes have attempted to break the spell, but all have disappeared without a trace. An original story by Michel Ocelot; nominated for the C√©sar Award for best short animated film in 1989. =Le Gar√ßon des figues= In the age of the Pharaohs, an honest young man is gifted a magical fig tree which sprouts fruit in the middle of winter. In honour of this miracle, he endeavours to present the figs to the queen of Egypt. However, a malicious royal steward would rather have it otherwise. Based on an ancient Egyptian tale. =La Sorci√®re= In northern Europe during the middle ages, a medieval king promises his daughter's hand in marriage to any man that can infiltrate the fortress of an evil sorceress, guarded by all manner of mechanical monsters. Is it possible that a simple unarmed boy can succeed where knights and princes have failed? An original story by Michel Ocelot. =Le Manteau de la vieille dame= In Japan during the time of Hokusai (the early 19th century to be exact) an adorable old poet-woman is travelling home when a devious bandit catches sight of her beautiful, expensive coat, and devises a plan to take it from her before the night is up. But unknown to him, she has a few of her own tricks up the sleeves of that beautiful coat.

Won the Ottawa International Animation Festival award for best TV series episode in 1990. =Icare= A retelling of the familiar mythological story of Icarus and Daedalus. =On ne saurait penser √† tout= The title translates as \\"One Could Not Think of All\\". Production The series was produced across two years starting in 1987, with animation done at La Fabrique in Saint-Laurent-le-Minier during the summer and post-production done in Paris during the intervening winters. It premiered at animation festivals in 1989, receiving critical acclaim and awards for best anthology series at Annecy and best children's series at Ottawa but no commission to create further episodes. Themes Cin√© si takes the format of an anthology series of fairy tales in which the male and female leads are always portrayed by the same animated \\"actors,\\" the supporting cast being supposedly played by humanoid robots programmed by them. Each story is preceded by a prologue set in a disused movie theater, in which these actor- animators and an old man who is both the projectionist and theater organist think up the story, costumes and music for the play which they then perform. These short plays stretch the definition of fairy tales, some being set in specified countries, most having post-modern, trick endings and one set not at an unspecified point in the past but, instead, in the future, with a retro- futurist aesthetic in the style of Yakov Protazanov's Aelita. All have an obvious ‚Äì though never explicitly stated ‚Äì moral, in the style of traditional stories. Ocelot had many more ideas for stories in this format, but the series was not as successful as he had expected and no further episodes than the initial eight were commissioned. A few years later, three of these stories were made into the TV special Tales of the Night (Les Contes de la nuit in French); in 2008 he returned to direct another ten of them as another television series, Berg√®res et dragons (Shepherdesses and Dragons), this time using computer animation to imitate the silhouette animation of Cin√© si and Les Contes de la nuit.

Career Daley was born in Purley, England on January 25, 1943, but moved with his parents to Canada at an early age. He studied at the University of British Columbia as an undergraduate and completed PhD studies at McGill University in 1971 where he was the student of Phil Merilees (Superintendent of NRL Marine Meteorology Division, 1997‚Äì2002). He died at his home in Carmel Valley, California on August 29, 2001. After 2 years as a postdoc in Denmark, Daley took a position at the numerical weather prediction research center in Montreal where he was instrumental in the development of the first operational weather model (implemented in 1976) based on the spectral transform method for the globe. This method is now the standard in most operational centers around the world Naval Research Lab including the Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorological and Oceanographic Center (FNMOC) in Monterey. In 1977, Daley accepted a position at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, where he carried out research on non-linear normal mode initialization and other outstanding problems in the dynamics of large-scale atmospheric flow particularly as they related to global numerical weather prediction. He also became much more interested in the science of data assimilation. During this period, Daley was author or co-author on many publications in the refereed literature and was honored by receiving the NCAR outstanding publication award. Nevertheless, he did not neglect his interest in operational applications. He was involved in implementation of non-linear normal mode initialization for baroclinic models at the Canadian Meteorological Centre in Canada and at Meteo-France in Paris; and he implemented an innovative error covariance formulation at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in the United Kingdom.Science.ca From 1985 until 1995, Daley held a position of Senior Scientist with the Meteorological Service of Canada in Toronto. His personal scientific work concentrated on the writing of a book entitled Atmospheric Data Assimilation, which was published in 1991. By the time he left Canada in 1995, he was firmly established as a world leader in data assimilation not only through his comprehensive book but also in terms of creative new developments in the theory and practice of data assimilation.Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation Daley was largely responsible for elevating data assimilation to be a prestigious field of scientific enquiry.Environment Canada Memorial Symposium Roger Daley Throughout his career, Daley was in demand as a consultant, as a scientific visitor and adjunct professor. He held visiting appointments at ECMWF; Meteo- France; Florida State University and The Meteorological Institute of Stockholm University. He was an adjunct professor at McGill University, Colorado State University and the Naval Postgraduate School and a Scientist Emeritus with the Meteorological Service of Canada. He also lectured extensively throughout the world including a series of lectures in Beijing, China; as a principal lecturer at the 1990 Summer Colloquium at NCAR and at the University of Toulon in France. He served on many important international scientific committees, carrying out scientific reviews and serving as member of journal editorial boards of the AMS and the Swedish Geophysical Society. He was Chief Editor for the CMOS journal Atmosphere-Ocean from 1989-1992. Daley received many honors during his career. From the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (CMOS) he received the Prize in Applied Meteorology in 1975 and the President's Prize in 1982. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1993 and a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) in 1997. In 1995, Daley accepted a position as a UCAR Distinguished Scientific Visitor at the Marine Meteorology Division, Naval Research Laboratory, in Monterey, California, and moved his family to the Carmel Valley. Daley took on a project, in close partnership with Ed Barker, to design and construct a three-dimensional variational data assimilation system specifically meant to serve the needs of the US Navy. Over a period of 5 years, he and Ed have carefully built and tested this system. It is known as the NRL Atmospheric Variational Data Assimilation System, or NAVDAS, and went operational at FNMOC and at Navy regional METOC centers in 2003.Navel Research Lab, Monterey NAVDAS is designed to meet data assimilation needs of both global models and regional nested models and holds great promise to provide a substantial increase in Navy model prediction accuracy. In January 2001, the American Meteorological Society recognized Daley's achievements by awarding him the prestigious Jule Charney Medal for a lifetime of outstanding scientific achievement.American Meteorological Society Awards NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center also recognized Daley's achievements by naming their new SGI Origin 3800 supercomputer after him. This 512-processor computer went into service at Goddard's Data Assimilation Office in 2001 to create significantly improved models of how the Earth's climate works.Goddard News  References  * Official obituary at NRL, accessed 2007-06-17 Category:1943 births Category:2001 deaths Category:McGill University alumni Category:British meteorologists Category:People from Purley, London Category:People from Carmel Valley Village, California Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:Fellows of the American Meteorological Society ","title":"Roger Daley"},{"id":"11545750","text":"Laurie J.

They are large-bodied and rather nondescript Ennominae, overall showing many similarities to the closely related Azelinini and Nacophorini.Young (2008) Most have a beige to brown color, and they rarely possess the disruptive cryptic patterns seen in many other geometer moths. A typical ennomiine wing pattern consists of two or three costal to dorsal sections, one of which is often darker in color. There is rarely more than one conspicuous dark or light spot on each side of each wing, and many do not have any particularly prominent markings at all. Systematics Phaeoura, which includes Phaeoura quernariaPitkin & Jenkins (2007) - the type species of the Nacophorini - nowadays, appears to be closer to the Ennomini than to the bulk of genera currently placed in the Nacophorini. It might be moved into the present tribe, making Nacophorini a junior synonym of Ennomini. The Lithinini and perhaps the Campaeini too, on the other hand, seem to warrant merging with the bulk of the Nacophorini, and in that case the resulting group would probably be named Lithinini. On the other hand, a more radical approach to achieve monophyly would be to merge all three tribes into the Ennomini. The enigmatic genus Hoplosauris, of rather uncertain placement in the Ennominae, is in some respects intermediate between the Nacophorini and the Ennomini. =Selected genera and species= As numerous ennomine genera have not yet been assigned to a tribe,See references in Savela (2008) the genus list is preliminary. * Acrodontis - might belong in Boarmiini * Apeira * Artiora * Crocallis  Scalloped oak, Crocallis elinguaria * Devenilia * Ectephrina * Eilicrinia * Ennomos  Canary-shouldered thorn, Ennomos alniaria  Large thorn, Ennomos autumnaria  September thorn, Ennomos erosaria  August thorn, Ennomos quercinaria * Exangerona * Hoplosauris (tentatively placed here) * Lignyoptera * Ocoelophora * Odontopera  Scalloped hazel, Odontopera bidentata * Pachycnemia * Proteostrenia * Scionomia * Selenia  Purple thorn, Selenia tetralunaria * Seleniopsis * Scodiomima * Xerodes - might belong in Boarmiini Footnotes References * (2008): Family group names in Geometridae.

Biography  Steinbrecht was born in 1808 in Ampfurth, a village near Oschersleben in the B√∂rde district of Saxony, which at that time was a province of Prussia. He studied veterinary medicine in Berlin before spending eight years at the man√®ge at Moabit under the celebrated dressage trainer Louis Seeger. It was there that he met his wife, Seeger's niece. From 1834 to 1842 he directed a private man√®ge in Magdeburg, and then returned to Berlin to work again with Seeger. In 1849 Steinbrecht took over as director of Seeger's man√®ge and began work on a book on horsemanship. In 1859 he acquired his own man√®ge in Dessau, but returned once again to Berlin in 1865, where he continued to train horses almost until his death. His book was expanded and edited by Paul Plinzner and published posthumously as Das Gymnasium des Pferdes, \\"The Gymnasium of the Horse\\" in 1886.

Mel Bonis at about age 50, photo ca. 1908. M√©lanie H√©l√®ne Bonis, known as Mel Bonis (21 January 1858 ‚Äì 18 March 1937), was a prolific French late-Romantic composer. She wrote more than 300 pieces, including works for piano solo and four hands, organ pieces, chamber music, m√©lodies, choral music, a mass, and works for orchestra. She attended the Paris Conservatoire, where her teachers included Cesar Franck, Ernest Guiraud, and Auguste Bazille. Life Bonis was born to a Parisian lower-middle-class family and was educated according to the strict norms of the Catholic morality of the time. Of great talent and musical sensitivity, she taught herself the piano. Initially her parents did not encourage her music, but when she was twelve, they were persuaded by a professor at the Conservatoire to allow her to receive formal music lessons.http://www.mel-bonis.com/melboanglais.htm At the age of sixteen, she began her studies at the Conservatoire, and attended classes in accompaniment, harmony and composition, where she shared the benches with Claude Debussy, Gabriel Piern√©, and others.Geliot, Christine: Mel Bonis. Femme et compositeur (1858‚Äì1937), second edition (Paris: L'Harmattan, 2009), . and received tuition from C√©sar Franck. Due to the difficulties encountered by women who wished to compose, she adopted the more androgynous form of her first name, \\"Mel\\".http://www.mel-bonis.com/melboanglais.htm At the Conservatoire she met and fell in love with Am√©d√©e Land√©ly Hettich, a student, poet and singer, setting some of his poems to music. Unfortunately, her parents disapproved of the match, and in 1883 arranged for her to marry the businessman Albert Domange, 25 years her senior (and a widower with five children from his two previous marriages), after which for a period she disappeared into domesticity and had three children. For Bonis it was not an ideal marriage as Domange did not like music.http://www.mel-bonis.com/melboanglais.htm In the 1890s, she met Hettich again, who encouraged her to return to composition, after which her career took off. However, she also began an affair with Hettich, which led to the birth of an illegitimate child, Madeleine. The child was put into the care of a former chambermaid, whilst Bonis devoted all her energies to composition, becoming a member of the Soci√©t√© des compositeurs de musique and a published composer with √âditions Alphonse Leduc.http://www.mel- bonis.com/melboanglais.htm She died in Sarcelles (Val-d'Oise).

The bold priest possessed no military quality but courage. He posted his troops in an ill-selected position and awaited the attack of Ibrahim, who advances in person to carry the position at the head of six thousand men on 1 June. Many of the archimandrite's troops, seeing the superior force of the Egyptians, deserted during the night, and only about fifteen hundred men remained. The pasha's regulars were led on to storm the Greek intrenchments in gallant style, and a short and desperate struggle ensued. The Greeks were forced from their position before they fled. The affair was the best contested during the war, for a thousand Greeks perished by the Arab bayonets, and four hundred Arabs lay dead on the field. In spite of the defeat and the severe loss sustained by the Greeks, they gained honour and courage by the battle of Maniaki.\\" The battle ended in an Egyptian victory, during which both Greek commanders, Papaflessas and Pieros Voidis, were killed in action. Battle Papaflessas, after his death, became a great exemplar of heroism to the Greeks. After the Greek defeat in Sphacteria and the fall of Neokastro, Papaflessas decided to repulse the Egyptians himself. With a force of 3,000 Greek soldiers, Papaflessas marched south to offense Ibrahim and chose to position his troops near Mount Malia in order to acquire a decent view of the plain near Navarino. From that entrenched position, Papaflessas awaited Ibrahim's forces, even though he had not military quality. During the night of 19 - 20 May, many Greeks from within Papaflessas's ranks deserted after seeing Ibrahim's enormous armies.Phillips, pp. 177-178. \\"With a body of 3,000 troops, Dikaios marched southward, and at Maniaki, on a spur of Mount Malia, took up a position commanding a view of the plain towards Navarino, and there awaited the arrival of the Egyptians. Presently the plain below them seemed to be covered with marching battalions; and, when the Greeks saw an apparently innumerable host advancing upon them with a steadiness and fateful deliberation as disconcerting as it was strange to their experience, many of them lost courage and fled.\\" Only half of the Greek forces remained in their positions with Papaflessas and Pieros Voidis. Ibrahim, in person, advanced towards the Greek position leading a force of over 6,000 soldiers. (Phillips calls the Egyptian force 'innumerable').Phillips, pp. 177-178. Papaflessas provided an eloquent speech that enhanced the morale of the remaining Greeks that decided to stay and fight.Phillips, p. 178. \\"About a thousand, however, held their ground and Dikaios stimulated their courage with the eloquence which made him so great a power in the revolt. Victory was always possible, he cried, but if they fell, many Turks would also bite the dust, and this battle would be as famous among posterity as the immortal stand of Leonidas and his three hundred Spartans. For once, courageous words were followed by courageous deeds.\\" As the Egyptians in Ibrahim's army attacked, the Greeks held their positions staunchly but were eventually overwhelmed. Ultimately, a large part of the remaining Greeks, of 800 or 1,000 men, including Papaflessas and four hundred egyptians perished in the aftermath of the battle.Phillips, p. 178. \\"The egyptians advanced to the attack; but the Greeks held their ill-constructed entrenchments with obstinate valour. At last, however, the discipline and numbers of the enemy prevailed; but not before 800 of the Greeks and over 400 egyptians had fallen. Dikaios himself fought like a lion; and the headless trunk of the burly priest was discovered surrounded by piles of slain egyptians.\\" The head and body of Papaflessas were recovered and placed upright on a post; not in dishonour, but as a mark of respect for a valiant foe. Legends say that Ibrahim even kissed his head and said \\"If all Greeks were like him, I would not take charge of this campaign\\".Phillips, p. 178-179. \\"Ibrahim caused the head to be sought; and, when it was found, had it set upon the trunk, and the figure of the dead leader placed upright against a post.\\" Ibrahim kissed the head of the dead Papaflessas and said \\"If all Greeks were like him, I would not take charge of this campaign\\". Aftermath Despite the defeat of Papaflessas, the battle itself helped to change and strengthen the declining morale of other Greeks who contributed to the independence movement.Phillips, p. 179. \\"The exploit of Dikaios revived the drooping courage of the Greeks; and when Kolokotrones, raised from his prison to the supreme command, took the field, he made his dispositions with a certain confidence.\\" See also *List of battles References Sources *Finlay, George.

The Shrine of Santa Maria della Steccata is a Greek-cross design Renaissance church in central Parma, Italy. The name derives from the fence or steccato used to corral the numerous devotees who visited a venerated image of the Madonna. A Nursing Madonna is enshrined within, crowned on 27 May 1601 by a Marian devotee, Fray Giacomo di Forli of the Capuchin order. History The Nursing Madonna enshrined and crowned by Jeronimo (Girolamo) Paolucci di Calboldi di Forli on 27 May 1601. By 1492, the Knights of Malta built an small oratory here to house a putatively miraculous icon depicting St John the Baptist. It became associated with a religious confraternity in a neighboring house that had the image of the virgin and child, mentioned above, on the facade. Rumors of miracles performed by this image led to masses flocking to the site. This required the erection of a picket fence or stockade (steccato) around the icon, hence giving the image its name. A bull dated 1 March 1493 by Pope Alexander VI mentions the image by this name.La patria; geografia dell' Italia, Provincie di Parma e Piacenza, edited by Gustavo Chiesi, Luigi Borsari, Giuseppe Isidoro Arneudo, Turin (1902), page 30. The popularity of the icons led the frescoed icon to be detached from a wall and moved to the oratory, and when that proved too small to accommodate the crowds, the commune of Parma patronized the construction of the church (1521-1539).Emilia Romagna, by Touring Club Italiano (1991): page 498. Architecture The architects were Bernardino Zaccagni and his son, Giovanni Francisco, with modifications by Gian Francesco d'Agrate, who also worked on the statuary gracing the roof-line. The dome (1526-1527) is attributed to Agrate, although with the help by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger.Emilia Romagna, by Touring Club Italiano (1991): page 498. The church was finally consecrated in 1539. The sacristy was rebuilt over the following centuries.Story of construction The layout is that mainly of a centralized Greek Cross church with four arms, although the entrance elongates through an arch to form the Coro dei Cavallieri. In the crossing is the majestic dome. Each arm has a half-dome, while between the arms are four corner chapels. Interior decoration Bernardino Gatti, Assumption of Mary. The interior was decorated by prominent artists, both local and foreign to Parma over the following centuries after completion of the builting. The tribune has a Baroque altar in the choir was begun by Mauro Oddi and completed in 1758-1765 by Andrea and Domenico della Meschina. The main altarpiece displays the famous icon inside a gilded frame replete with cherubs and putti and a gilded crown; the ensemble flanked by two solomonic columns flanked by two pillars. At the base are two statues, Saint Joseph and King David, sculpted by Francesco and Giovanni Baratta. In the hemicycle above the altar, is a large fresco depicting a Coronation of the Virgin with Saints (1541), painted by Michelangelo Anselmi.Anselmi fresco He also painted the adjacent ceiling fresco depicting the Adoration of the Magi. Behind the altar is a semicircle of wooden choir stalls. In the sacristy and sanctuary, many of the fresco figures and decorations were painted or planned by a young Parmigianino,Parmigianino frescoes whilst the church also houses c.1523 two oil on canvas paintings by him of Saint Cecilia and King David, both originally intended as organ doors. Other artists include Bernardino Gatti, who frescoed parts of the ceiling. The Dutch painter Jan Soens painted a Holy Family. Giambettino Cignaroli painted a Trinity with Saints Niccol√≤, Basilius, and Gregory. A somewhat retrograde mannerist Madonna and Bambino, with Saints Joseph & George was painted by Marcantonio Franceschini in 1718. A mannerist Redeemer with St. Anthony of Padua and the Magdalen was painted by Girolamo Mazzola Bedoli, based on a commission from 1605 for the price of 60 ducats and 76 soldi.Mazzola Bedoli painting The Parmesan painter Aurelio Barili painted frescoes in 1588. The church contains funeral monuments of Bertrando Rossi, Ottavio Farnese, Sforzino Sforza, and Adam Albert von Neipperg (by Lorenzo Bartolini). Dukes of Parma In the crypt are the tombs of twenty-six members of the Farnese family including Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma and his wife Infanta Maria of Portugal.

The park has two ponds and varied tree cover, and was designed and laid out between 1870 and 1872 by the celebrated Victorian gardener Edward Milner. The arboretum is a park of grade II importance. History Following the national trend of providing public parks, and with the closure of the nearby Temple Gardens, which had operated on a semi-public basis, the Lincoln Commons Act (1870) was passed. Monks Leys Common, located to the east of the city, was purchased by the Corporation through Act of Parliament. Authorisation was also given to sell of the land for residential building purposes to help fund the layout and construction of the Arboretum, which would become Lincoln's first truly public park. The Arboretum has a lodge at its west entrance on Monks Road, and has three terraces of housing adjoining it to its western edge: Arboretum View, Monks Leys Terrace, and Woodland View. Renovation of the Arboretum in 2002‚Äì2003 The hedge maze The Arboretum reopened on 19 September 2003, following ¬£3 million worth of restoration work to bring it back to its original state. Works have included: overhauling and improving the facilities at Abbey Lodge to provide a community access centre and visitor tea rooms, restoration of the Victorian bandstand, new period railings, restoration of a cast iron folly, new asphalt footpaths, refurbished gardens and extensive replanting, the introduction of a new children's maze, resurfacing of the major terrace feature, refurbishment of the ponds and bridges, underpinning and replacement of the stone steps, new lighting columns, installation of closed-circuit television (CCTV), refurbishment of the children play area, restoration of the lion statue and restoration of the two fountain features.

The database lists books by individual editions, recording standard bibliographic details for each edition as well as giving a brief census of known copies, organised by location. It currently holds records of over 30,000 editions.  History  Previous efforts to comprehensively catalog 15th century printing include Georg Wolfgang Panzer's Annales Typographici ab Artis Inventae Origine ad Annum MD (1793‚Äì97) and Ludwig Hain's Repertorium Bibliographicum (1822). Hain's work was later supplemented by Copinger's Supplement and Reichling's Appendices, which would pave the way for the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke (1925). The Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke (GW) was the most comprehensive catalog of incunables to date (and still offers more in-depth information than ISTC),Needham, Paul (1993), \\"Incunable catalogs,\\" Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 87:1, p. 371-372. but in recent decades work on the catalog has slowed to such a degree that the goal of cataloging all extant incunables under the GW's system is indefinitely far-off.Needham, Paul (1998), \\"Counting incunables: The IISTC CD-ROM,\\" Huntington Library Quarterly 61:3/4, p. 456-529. The ISTC was created to establish a system of incunable cataloging that was simple enough to be expanded quickly, bringing the goal of a complete incunable catalog back into focus. Furthermore, the ISTC would use standardized entries that could be entered into a machine- searchable database. Work on the ISTC began in 1980 under the leadership of the British Library's Lotte Hellinga. Frederick R. Goff's Incunabula in American Libraries (1973) was the first pre-existing catalog to be keyed into ISTC's database. Besides providing the catalog's first 12,900 entries, Goff's system for classifying information about incunables formed the basis for the structure of ISTC's records. Entries for all of the incunables in British Library and the Italian union catalog (IGI) were added next, followed by other national incunable catalogs.Hellinga, Lotte, and Goldfinch, John (eds) (1987), Bibliography and the study of 15th-century civilisation: Papers presented at a colloquium at the British Library 26‚Äì28 September 1984 (London: British Library).  Records  ISTC records retain many characteristics of the records from Goff's census. Each record represents one edition of a work. Information such as author, title, printer, place of printing, year of printing, language, and format is entered into discrete fields to make the records searchable by a computer. Catalogue entries are reduced to a standard form, for ease of indexing and access, which includes the use of standard names for authors and printers‚Äîa major issue in an era where the use of Latinised names and vernacular ones interchangeably was common‚Äîand contemporary English names for places. Dates are reduced to conventional years where possible.

Documenting these last few hundred editions is a tremendous undertaking, as the works are scattered in unknown locations in many countries, leaving bibliographers with no organized way to search for them except to \\"look everywhere\\". While the ISTC is unsurpassed in coverage, it does not offer the same level of detail as the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke or the numerous collection catalogs that are available. Rather, the ISTC complements these resources by providing a searchable index of editions, referring to other catalogs and bibliographies for further detail. ISTC does not include information about individual copies of a work as standard, though a brief census of confirmed locations is provided, and may contain brief notes. In general, the ISTC only covers extant editions, although records exist for some works that were sufficiently well-documented before being lost to fire or other calamities. An illustrated edition of the ISTC was made available on CD- ROM in 1998. The addition of illustrations offers important information about a book's layout, format, and printing type.

Terence was arrested with three others on suspicion of stealing a car and taken to Store St Garda station. Two hours later he was found unconscious in his cell. On 13 May 2007, a jury at the coroner's court returned a verdict of death by suicide.Breaking News  Circumstances leading up to his death  Garda Tadhg O‚ÄôLeary, from Fitzgibbon Street Garda station, said Garda√≠ received a phone call from a woman on that day to report a car being brought into a back yard at Sean O‚ÄôCasey Avenue and being covered with a sheet. Garda O‚ÄôLeary had a check run on the black Toyota Yaris, and the owner in Donnybrook confirmed it had been stolen. He later spotted four young men in the car. ‚ÄúTerrence Wheelock, who was known to me, jumped from the passenger seat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll four youths ran from the car into the back door of the house.‚Äù Garda√≠ confirmed all four were surrounded in the square at the front of the house by officers and gave themselves up shortly after midday. The inquest heard Wheelock and another man were brought to Store Street Garda station. At that point, Garda O‚ÄôLeary said he discovered two bench warrants were in existence for Wheelock and he would have to be held to appear before the District Court. ‚ÄúAt the time of the arrest of the youths they were caught red-handed‚Äù, he said.Man found dead in garda cell 'caught in stolen car'  Ireland  BreakingNews.ie Terence Wheelock died in hospital on 16 December 2005 after he was found unconscious in a cell in Store Street Garda Station two weeks earlier. An inquiry by the Garda Ombudsman into Wheelock's death found he was not mistreated in any way in Store Street Garda Station. The Ombudsman's Report also found that an allegation that he was sexually assaulted was wholly without foundation and that there was insufficient evidence to support an allegation of assault. While no individual garda was found to be culpable in relation to Wheelock's death, the report identified a number of system failures including the failure to remove the cord from his tracksuit and to properly record details in custody.  Death  = Garda View = The Garda S√≠och√°na stated that Terence committed suicide while in his cell, hanging himself with a ligature which \\"was secured to a fixture which is countersunk into the wall\\". Kieran Bisset, a member of Dublin Fire Brigade who provide ambulance cover in the Dublin area, said a number of Garda√≠ were performing CPR on the unconscious man when the Fire Brigade were called after 2.30pm. ‚ÄúThere was an obvious ligature mark around the front of his neck,‚Äù he said, adding it was deep and previous experience would indicate it was from a cord or a shoelace. The Garda√≠ stated that on observing Terrence in the cell they took him into the open cell area where CPR was performed = Family View = Wheelock's family contested the idea that Terence had hanged himself. According to his brother Larry, \\"Terence was a healthy, happy-go-lucky young man with no history of self-harm and for him to have committed suicide would have been entirely out of character.\\" His family believe that Wheelock died as a result of injuries received from the garda√≠ while in custody. According to Larry Wheelock, Terrances' brother, Terrence was in fact a victim of police brutality and high-ranking members of the force have actively attempted to cover up what really happened.Garda  Inconsistencies and Matters Arising  *The Dublin City Coroner's Court earlier heard that bruising on Mr Wheelock were consistent with medical intervention.RT√â News: Wheelock family rejects inquest verdict *Dr Maureen Smith from the Forensic Science Laboratory told the court she was unable to generate a DNA profile from the tissue sample she was given from the post mortem. Using blood samples, she determined that blood found on Mr Wheelock's T-shirt was not his blood, but most likely that of a close relative, a matter she said that merited further investigation. *As per normal procedure Terence should have been checked in his cell on a regular basis. According to the station records ten minutes before he was found unconscious he was inspected and it was believed that he was asleep. Ten minutes later Garda√≠ state they found him hanging from a light fixture. The ambulance was called approximately 5 minutes after Terence was found in his cell. The delay was blamed on Garda√≠ trying to perform CPR and first aid prior to contacting Dublin Fire Brigade. Garda√≠ admitted that this was an error on their part. *The Wheelock family claim that Garda√≠ called to the Wheelock house, informed Terence‚Äôs mother Esther that her son had hanged himself, and told her that he was in St. James‚Äôs Hospital on the south side of Dublin. These Garda√≠ then drove her to St. James‚Äôs. They claimed not to know the way to get there and Esther says she had to direct them. Terence had in fact been brought to the Mater Hospital on the north side of Dublin and much nearer to the Wheelock family home and Store Street Garda station. By the time his family became aware of this and went to the Mater Hospital his clothing had been taken away by Garda√≠. Terence was in a coma. Garda√≠ from Store Street Garda station had no input into what hospital be used nor would their work include detailed knowledge of the southside. *The Garda press statement mentioned that there was no evidence of any bruising on Terence‚Äôs body. This was contradicted by his family who saw him in the hospital, and also by photographs taken in hospital. These photographs were all later explained as medical intervention which took place in hospital and after he was removed from Garda custody. *When the family managed to get hold of the custody records the names of the arresting Garda√≠ had been altered to show another name which Garda√≠ explained was due to an error in recording the incorrect name. Garda√≠ also stated that this amendment was made at the time of arrival and not later. The Wheelock family had to make many attempts to recover Terence‚Äôs clothes for independent forensic examination. These attempts were continually rebuffed by the Dept of Justice. When the family finally received the clothes worn by Terence, they claim they clothing was found to be heavily bloodstained.http://www.independent.ie/national-news/prisoner-hanged-himself- in-garda-cell-inquest-decides-1037478.html However, medical evidence shows that the blood was not Terrences and therefore could not have been present at the time of Terrence being taken to hospital. How blood from a family relative came to be on the clothes after they were released has never been explained by the family. *The Garda Commissioner appointed Detective Superintendent Oliver Hanley from Dun Laoghaire Garda Station to look into the events around Terence‚Äôs death. Hanley served in Store Street station for over fifteen years. Therefore, it has been questioned whether he could be said to be truly independent.WSM  Alleged Garda intimidation  According to the family, they were also subject to intimidation and even attacks from the Garda√≠ because of their campaign for an investigation. * On the May 17, 2006, Larry, Terence's brother was distributing leaflets about their family's campaign. According to him, \\"he was approached by a guard who tore up the leaflets and then tried to arrest him. The Wheelock family also claim harassment however Garda sources state that the reason for extra Garda√≠ in the area was to combat ongoing anti- social behaviour in the area.\\" * On July 3, 2006, The Wheelock family moved from their home in Summerhill where they had lived for over twenty years. Larry Junior said \\"we couldn't stick it anymore, the Garda harassing us, it was getting worse and worse. Day after day they were using horses and dogs, and shining lights into the house, laughing and joking at all hours. They looked a sad lot. It was very upsetting for my mother and father. So that is why we decided to move. Hopefully they won't have another excuse at our new home.\\"Indy Media No evidence was brought forward supporting these allegations nor were any complaints made to the Garda Ombudsman.  Demonstrations  There were protests in favour of an independent inquiry on the death of Terence Wheelock. They took place in many locations including Store Street Garda Station, D√°il √âireann, The Minister for Justice's office and Bertie Ahern's constituency office. Justice for Terence Demo, June 2006  Investigation  * In July 2007, the Garda S√≠och√°na Ombudsman Commission announced that it would carry out an investigation into the case. Terence's brother, Larry Wheelock told journalists that an official from the Ombudsman's office had contacted the family to inform them it was to launch an inquiry for various reasons. Among these, he said, were that it is in the public interest to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death; the close nature of the verdict (a four-to-three majority), and the injuries on Terence's body.http://www.independent.ie/national-news/ombudsman-to-begin-probe-into- wheelock-prison-death-1046840.html The GSOC report, which was published in March 2010, found that there was no credible evidence that Mr Wheelock had been mistreated.http://www.herald.ie/news/melee-breaks-out-in-station-on- tragic-death-anniversary-30594978.html  References  Category:1985 births Category:2005 deaths Category:People from Dublin (city) ","title":"Terence Wheelock"},{"id":"11545891","text":"SYSPRO is a software development company, providing integrated business software including accounting, manufacturing and distribution operations across a wide variety of industries.

In 1959, WIIC began broadcasting professional wrestling from their studio located in Fineview. The show was hosted by Bill Cardille through most of its run, although he was not the original host. The primary directors were Chuck Moyer and Jack Bleriot. Popularity At one time, this show was considered one of the top wrestling shows in the United States. Even though the show started on Saturdays at 6 p.m., the lines started to form around the TV station at noon. The show was so popular that it revived the dying Pittsburgh wrestling market. Promoter Joseph \\"Toots\\" Mondt went from promoting shows at a tiny North Side venue called \\"The Islam Grotto\\" to packing in tens of thousands of fans to outdoor shows at Forbes Field. In 1961, Mondt began using the newly built Pittsburgh Civic Arena to run indoor shows on a monthly basis. Even the referees such as Paddy Grimes, Izzy Moidel (who claimed to have once beat Rocky Marciano in an amateur boxing match), and Andy DePaul became local celebrities because of the show's huge audience. An elderly lady named Anna Buckalew, popularly known as Ringside Rosie, who always sat in the front row every Saturday, became well known. Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Famer Pie Traynor later became part of the show as a commercial spokesman for the American Heating Company. His tag line was, \\"Who can? Ameri-CAN!!!\\" Cancellation The show lasted until 1972. WIIC-TV's new GM David Chase did not think pro wrestling helped the station's image as a news source. He decided to cancel the show, which had once been the station's top rated show. The ratings had declined because wrestling had lost popularity in Pittsburgh, with some Civic Arena shows drawing fewer than 3,000 fans. The fact that Bruno Sammartino was no longer champion and was wrestling on a more limited schedule had a lot to do with this decline. A time change to a 4:30 start also caused some audience erosion. Around this time the Pittsburgh promotional office, sold by Newton Tattrie (Geeto Mongol) to a Buffalo-based promotion, struggled to remain an independent promotion. Studio Wrestling switched to WPGH-TV channel 53 with the shows being taped in Erie, Pennsylvania. In 1974, the show went off the air and was replaced by the WWWF's syndicated program. The WWWF (today the WWE) was able to claim Pittsburgh as part of its own since it was part of the National Wrestling Alliance at the time and Studio Wrestling was independent of the NWA. Because of budget and storage concerns, weekly \\"reference\\" tapes from the live show were not saved. WIIC-TV re-used all tapes containing its original programming such as Studio Wrestling and Chiller Theatre. Videos of these programs are now very rare. The Studio Wrestling theme song was \\"El Capitan\\" by John Philip Sousa. Local wrestlers (appearing on Studio Wrestling) The list of wrestlers who appeared on the show reads like a who's who of American Pro Wrestling. Bruno Sammartino was undoubtedly the most popular and was able to help the WWWF to claim Pittsburgh as part of its territory as far as the NWA was concerned. Giant Baba wrestled on the show.

It was founded in 1984. History The school began its life as Tableland Christian College. It started with 13 students and one teacher in the building that now houses the Tableland-Johnston District Education Office of Education Queensland. In 1990, the school commenced secondary education for students in Year 8 and 9. In 1992 Tableland Christian College became one of only a handful of non-state schools in Australia registered to provide Distance Education. Towards the end of 1997, it was recognised that the school‚Äôs future would be benefited by making the school ‚Äònon-denominational‚Äô ‚Äì that is not controlled, or seen to be controlled, by any one particular church denomination. To that end, the parents and the staff of the school banded together to form a new company, Jubilee Christian College Ltd, with the vision to take over the operation of the school. During the next few months the directors of Jubilee Christian College Ltd completed documentation that would see the new company be approved by both the State and Commonwealth Governments as the Approved Authority of the existing school, Tableland Christian College. On May 1, 1998, the directors of Jubilee Christian College Ltd officially took control of the school known as Tableland Christian College. In order to demonstrate that the school was now separate from the Assembly of God church, the directors changed the name of the School to Jubilee Christian College. The College currently enrols students from Prep to Year 12, for both on campus and distance education.

Career Henri- Montan Berton was born the son of Pierre Montan Berton.Charlton 2001.\\"Henri- Montan Berton\\" in Sadie 1992, vol. 1, pp. 453‚Äì455. He is principally remembered as a composer of operas, most of which were first performed at the Op√©ra-Comique. Riding a wave of anti-clericalism which arose at the time of the French Revolution, his first real success was with Les rigueurs du clo√Ætre (23 August 1790), \\"in which a young nun is saved from entombment at the hands of a corrupt mother superior.\\" The work has been described as the first rescue opera.Smith 1970, p. 182.The Music Review, 1981 Later more notable operas include Montano et St√©phanie (15 April 1799), Le d√©lire (7 December 1799), and La Romance (26 January 1804). One of his greatest early successes was Aline, reine de Golconde (3 September 1803), which was performed internationally. Later in his career he tried tragedy with Virginie, which was premiered by the Paris Opera at the Salle Le Peletier on 11 June 1823, and received a total of 39 performances.

Nine members of the royal family were killed in a mass shooting during a party or monthly reunion dinner of the royal family in the house. The dead included King Birendra of Nepal and Queen Aishwarya. A government-appointed inquiry team named Crown Prince Dipendra as perpetrator of the massacre. Dipendra slipped into a coma after shooting himself. Later, upon his father's death, Dipendra was declared King of Nepal while in a coma. He died in hospital three days after the massacre without regaining consciousness. Birendra's brother, Gyanendra, became king after the death of his nephew King Dipendra. Events According to eyewitness reports and an official investigation carried by a two-man committee made up of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Keshav Prasad Upadhaya and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Taranath Ranabhat: On 1 June 2001, Crown Prince Dipendra opened fire at a house on the grounds of the Narayanhity Royal Palace, the residence of the Nepalese monarchy, where a party was being held. He shot and killed his father, King Birendra, his mother, Queen Aishwarya, and seven other members of the royal family ‚Äî including his younger brother and sister‚Äî before shooting himself in the head. Due to his wiping out of most of the line of succession, he became king while in a comatose state from the head wound. His motive for the murders is unknown, but there are various theories. Dipendra desired to marry Devyani Rana, whom he had met in the United Kingdom. Some allege that, due to her mother's family being lower-class royals of India and her father's political alliances, Dipendra's parents objected. In fact, Devyani Rana's Gwalior family is one of the wealthiest former royal families of India, and allegedly far wealthier than the Shahs of Nepal. The prospective bride's mother, a Nepali by birth, warned her daughter that marrying the Nepali crown prince might mean a drop in her standard of living. Dipendra's prospective bride descended, through her mother, from a competing sub-branch of the Nepali Rana clan (the Juddha Shamsher line) to that of Queen Aishwarya. Another theory states that there was a higher possibility of Indian influence if he would be married to her, to which the palace objected. Other theories allege that Dipendra was unhappy with the country's shift from an absolute to a constitutional monarchy, and that too much power had been given away following the 1990 People's Movement. This is, in fact, unlikely. The crown prince responded to the 1990 uprising, and return to an elected government, with enthusiasm while a student at Eton College, where he was finishing his studies. He later became frustrated by his father's refusal to intervene while the Nepali politicians bickered and competed among themselves while failing to make an effective response to the rising Maoist threat. Much controversy surrounds the circumstances of the massacre, and even today, with the monarchy abolished, many questions remain within Nepal about its cause. Sources of the yet unanswered questions include details such as the apparent lack of security at the event; the absence from the party of Prince Gyanendra, Dipendra's uncle who succeeded him; the fact that, despite being right-handed, Dipendra's self- inflicted head-wound was located at his left temple, and that two bullets were found to be lodged in the temple instead of one; and finally that the subsequent investigation lasted for only two weeks and did not involve any major forensic analysis. This investigation was done after Scotland Yard had actually offered to carry out a forensic investigation. Victims =Killed= *King Birendra *Queen Aishwarya *Crown Prince (later HM King) Dipendra, elder son of Birendra and Aishwarya *Prince Nirajan, younger son of Birendra and Aishwarya *Princess Shruti, daughter of Birendra and Aishwarya *Prince Dhirendra, King Birendra's brother who had renounced his title *Princess Shanti, King Birendra's eldest sister, also Rani of Bajhang *Princess Sharada, King Birendra's middle sister *Kumar Khadga, Princess Sharada's husband *Princess Jayanti, King Birendra's first cousin and sister of Mrs. Ketaki Chester =Wounded= *Princess Shova, King Birendra's sister *Kumar Gorakh, Princess Shruti's husband *Princess Komal, Prince Gyanendra's wife and future and the last Queen of Nepal *Ketaki Chester, King Birendra's first cousin who had renounced her title (and middle sister of Princess Jayanti) Aftermath Dipendra was proclaimed king while in a coma, but he died on 4 June 2001, after a three-day reign. Gyanendra was appointed regent for the three days, then ascended the throne himself after Dipendra died. While Dipendra lived, Gyanendra maintained that the deaths were the result of an \\"accidental discharge of an automatic weapon\\" within the royal palace. However, he later said that he made this claim due to \\"legal and constitutional hurdles,\\" since under the constitution, and by tradition, Dipendra could not have been charged with murder had he survived. A full investigation took place, and Dipendra was found to be responsible for the killing. A two-man committee comprising Keshav Prasad Upadhaya, the Supreme Court Chief Justice, and Taranath Ranabhat, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, carried out the week-long investigation into the massacre. The investigation concluded, after interviewing more than a hundred people including eyewitnesses and palace officials, guards and staff, that Dipendra had carried out the massacre. A large number of critics and Nepalese, both inside Nepal and abroad, disputed the official report because many facts and evidence reported by the investigation team seemed contradictory in many aspects. A close aide of Dipendra when he was prince said of Dipendra, \\"He can give up the throne for the sake of his love, but he can never do this kind of thing.\\" Rumoured cause The widely circulated rumour is that Prince Dipendra was angry over a marriage dispute. Dipendra's choice of bride was Devyani Rana, daughter of Pashupati Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana, a member of the Rana clan, against which the Shah dynasty have a historic animosity. The Rana clan had served as the hereditary prime ministers of Nepal, with the title Maharaja, until 1951, and the two clans have a long history of inter- marriages. It is also speculated that the reason for the marriage dispute over Dipendra's choice of wife was that the royal family had a position that the crown prince should not marry someone having relatives in India, as Devyani did. Also, that Devyani Rana's mother, Usharaje Scindia was of Gwalior royal lineage, was not considered impressive by the Nepal royal family. Prince Dipendra also courted Supriya Shah, who was the granddaughter of Queen Mother Ratna's own sister. Queen Aishwarya, though initially opposed the relationship due to family ties and the view that Supriya would be incompetent as a queen, as to which expressions by the Queen were heard by an aide, nevertheless favored Supriya over Devyani Rana, since if Supriya became queen, the Shah dynasty would not have to share its power with the Ranas, entailing formation of an unwanted political alliance. Ceremonial response On 12 June 2001, a Hindu katto ceremony was held to exorcise or banish the spirit of the dead king from Nepal. A brahmin Durga Prasad Sapkota, dressed as Birendra to symbolise the late king, rode an elephant out of Kathmandu and into symbolic exile, taking many of the monarch's belongings with him. Dipendra's residence was also eventually razed to the ground. Conspiracy theories King Birendra and his son Dipendra were very popular and well-respected by the Nepalese population. Subsequently, Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), the chairman of the Nepalese Maoist Party, in a public gathering claimed that the massacre was planned by the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) or the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Promoters of these ideas allege Gyanendra had a hand in the massacre so that he could assume the throne himself. His ascent to the throne would have been possible only if both of his nephews, Dipendra and Nirajan, were eliminated. Moreover, Gyanendra and especially his son Prince Paras were very unpopular with the public. On the day of the massacre, he was in Pokhara whilst other royals were attending a dinner function. His wife Komal, Paras and daughter Prerana were in the room at the royal palace during the massacre. While the entire families of Birendra and Dipendra were killed, nobody in Gyanendra's family died: his son escaped with slight injuries, and his wife sustained a life-threatening bullet wound but survived.

He posthumously received the Medal of Honor for sacrificing his life on February 24, 1967, while supporting a unit of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) at Di Linh, near Da Lat, South Vietnam. Career Wilbanks joined the Air Force in August 1950, and was an air policeman with the Strategic Air Command during his first four years of service. He was then accepted into the aviation cadet program, and became a commissioned officer in June 1955. After serving as an instructor for a few years, he qualified as a fighter pilot in the early 1960s. He arrived in Vietnam in April 1966 as a forward air controller (FAC) with the 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron piloting a Cessna O-1E Bird Dog, with a top speed of about 105 mph. FACs were the key link in providing close air support to ground troops fighting in the Vietnam jungle. By February 24, 1967 he had flown 487 combat missions and had earned the Distinguished Flying Cross and 17 Air Medals. He was within two months of returning home to his wife and four small children. Late in the afternoon of the 24 February, Wilbanks was in the air above the Central Highlands, flying reconnaissance for an ARVN Ranger Battalion. He discovered Viet Cong units concealed on two hilltops. The Rangers were on foot, making their way through a tea plantation that gave them little or no cover. They were walking into a trap. As Wilbanks flew his O-1E on a low-level sweep of the area, he radioed a warning to the Rangers. The enemy troops, seeing his plane, knew their ambush was being compromised, so they reacted with a barrage from mortars, machine guns and automatic weapons. Wilbanks flew through the heavy fire as he marked the area with white phosphorus rockets. The Viet Cong, knowing that fighters would soon be coming, charged down the slopes toward the outnumbered Rangers. Wilbanks watched the drama from above and realized the fighters would not arrive in time to save Ranger lives. The enemy force needed to be delayed a little longer. Diving toward the advancing troops, Wilbanks fired his remaining phosphorus rockets. The line momentarily stopped, but the Viet Cong were old hands at this and knew he had no more rockets. They began their advance again. The fighters had still not arrived. Wilbanks had one more weapon, an M16 rifle. Grabbing his rifle, he began a series of strafing runs at about 100 feet, firing it through the side window and reloading between passes. He managed to distract the enemy troops and momentarily slowed their advance. The Viet Cong diverted their fire against the low-flying O-1E. On his third pass, Wilbanks was severely wounded and crashed in the battle area. An Army Ranger ran to his plane and pulled the unconscious Wilbanks from the wreckage. A flight of F-4s roared in to strafe the enemy while a helicopter picked up the wounded Wilbanks. He died while being evacuated to a hospital. Legacy Plaque of Wilbanks at the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame Wilbanks, aged 33 at his death, was buried in Fayette Methodist Cemetery in Fayette, Mississippi. On January 24, 1968, United States Secretary of the Air Force Harold Brown presented the Medal of Honor to Wilbanks' widow at The Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. Wilbanks is a member of the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame. A six-foot tall, two-sided black granite memorial was erected in Cornelia, Georgia, about 400 yards from where he was born. Hilliard A.

Delgado. It stars Laura Morante, Miguel √Ångel Garc√≠a and Jos√© Coronado. The film is an erotic psychodrama, an exploration of female sexual desire. It premiered at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival in 1998 where it was nominated for the Golden Bear. Aranda objects to labeling of his film as an \\"erotic film\\", instead he defines it as \\"psycho-erotic\\": \\"[The heroine,] Bego√±a's ambition is transparency. (...) She wants to enjoy life in its widest expression, and looks for clarity through sex.\\" Plot Bego√±a is a thirty something consultant who has rebelled against her upper-middle-class background and has overdone it with sex ever since her youth. On recommendation of her psychoanalyst, she keeps a video diary of her encounters using a palm-sized video gadget called \\"The Owl\\". On Christmas Eve, reluctantly, Bego√±a goes to have dinner with her dysfunctional family: her stern mother, her married brother and her younger sister. Soon, Bego√±a, the family‚Äôs black sheep, clashes with her relatives. She leaves abruptly in disharmony, only her sister seems sympathetic towards her. The same night in a bar, Bego√±a is befriended by Daniel, a solitary handsome man in his late teens. The attractive and self assure Bego√±a draws his attention, but when her on and off ex-boyfriend Elio, and adventurous biker, shows up at the bar, an argument ensures between Elio and Daniel. The next morning Bego√±a wakes up in her bed with Daniel next to her. Drunk as she was, she does not remember what had happened. They had sex, he tells her, and it was wild. Young, rich and without any real occupation, Daniel starts to pursue Bego√±a relentlessly, but, although she is flattered, she ignores him. He is far from her only love interest. Besides Daniel and Elio, there is Ram√≥n, Bego√±a‚Äôs coworker and sometimes lover. She is tired of him and rebuffs his advances coldly. Only Ignacio, an older painter, seems to hold her interest. Old enough to be her father, Bego√±a has been Ignacio‚Äôs lover for many years. Although Daniel has followed her to Ignacio‚Äôs house, he is not deterred in his interest for Bego√±a. When New Year ‚Äôs Day comes, Bego√±a goes to a party and gets reunited with her friends of younger days. The host is Santiago, Bego√±a‚Äòs high School boyfriend. He is now married with twins and Bego√±a wonders how her life could have been that of a traditional wife and mother. At the party, there is also Marian, Bego√±a's friend, who is married to a much younger man, but is having trouble getting pregnant. On her request, Bego√±a helps Marian to collect from her husband the sperm she needs for an artificial insemination. Bego√±a's spirit of adventure makes her accept the challenge of Elio, her friend and sometimes lover, to go into a rough section of Madrid pretending to be a prostitute. However, once there she is brutally raped by the local pimp, a beefy tall man in drag. After that terrible experience, Bego√±a looks for a more respectable life. Once again causing a commotion with her family, Bego√±a marries Daniel and has a child with him. Nevertheless, unsatisfied, one day, she decides to return to the seedy neighborhood where she was raped, looking for more.

The role of GHS-R is thought to be in regulating energy homeostasis and body weight. In the brain, they are most highly expressed in the hypothalamus, specifically the ventromedial nucleus and arcuate nucleus. GSH-Rs are also expressed in other areas of the brain, including the ventral tegmental area, hippocampus, and substantia nigra. Outside the central nervous system, too, GSH-Rs are also found in the liver, in skeletal muscle, and even in the heart. Structure Two identified transcript variants are expressed in several tissues and are evolutionary conserved in fish and swine. One transcript, 1a, excises an intron and encodes the functional protein; this protein is the receptor for the ghrelin ligand and defines a neuroendocrine pathway for growth hormone release. The second transcript (1b) retains the intron and does not function as a receptor for ghrelin; however, it may function to attenuate activity of isoform 1a. GHS-R1a falls into G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Previous studies have shown that GPCRs can form heterodimers, or functional receptor pairs with other types of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Various studies suggest that GHS-R1a specifically forms dimers with the following hormone and neurotransmitter receptors: somatostatin receptor 5, dopamine receptor type 2 (DRD2), melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R), and serotonin receptor type 2C (5-HT2c receptor). See \\"Function\\" section below for details on the purported functions of these heterodimers.  Function  = Growth hormone release = The binding of ghrelin to GHS-R1a in pituitary cells stimulates the secretion of growth hormone (GH) by the pituitary gland. = Constitutive activity = One important feature of GHS-R1a is that there is still some activity in the receptor even when it is not actively being stimulated. This is called constitutive activity, and it means that the receptor is always \\"on,\\" unless acted on by an inverse agonist. This constitutive activity seems to provide a tonic signal required for the development of normal height, probably through an effect on the GH axis. In fact, some genetic variations, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in growth hormone secretagogue receptor, have been found to be associated with hereditary obesity and others with hereditary short stature. It was also found that, when GHS-R1A constitutive activity, was diminished, there were decreased levels of hunger-inducing hormone neuropeptide Y (NPY) as well as in food intake and body weight. = Intracellular signaling mechanisms = When growth hormone secretagogue receptor is activated, a variety of different intracellular signaling cascades can result, depending on the cell type in which the receptor is expressed. These intracellular signaling cascades include mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)), protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase B (PKB), also known as AKT), and AMP Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) cascades. = Behavioral reinforcement of food intake = It is well-characterized that activating the growth hormone secretagogue receptor with ghrelin induces an orexigenic state, or general feeling of hunger. However, ghrelin may also play a role in behavioral reinforcement. Studies in animal models, found that food intake increased when ghrelin was specifically administered to just the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a brain area that uses dopamine signaling to reinforce behavior. In fact, the more ghrelin administered, the more food the rodent consumed. This is called a dose-dependent effect. Building on this, it was found that there are growth hormone secretagogue receptors in the VTA and that ghrelin acts on the VTA through these receptors. Current studies, furthermore, suggest that the VTA may contain dimers of GHS-R1a and dopamine receptor type 2 (DRD2). If these two receptors do indeed form dimers, this would somehow link ghrelin signaling to dopaminergic signaling. = Enhancement of learning and memory = The growth hormone secretagogue receptor may also be linked to learning and memory. First of all, the receptor is found in the hippocampus, the brain region responsible for long-term memory. Second, it was found that specifically activating the receptor in just the hippocampus increased both long-term potentiation (LTP) and dendritic spine density, two cellular phenomena thought to be involved in learning. Third, short-term calorie restriction, defined as a 30% reduction in caloric intake for two weeks, which naturally increases ghrelin levels and thus activates the receptor, was found to increase both performance on spatial learning tasks as well as neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus.  Selective ligands  A range of selective ligands for the GHS-R receptor are now available and are being developed for several clinical applications. GHS-R agonists have appetite-stimulating and growth hormone-releasing effects, and are likely to be useful for the treatment of muscle wasting and frailty associated with old-age and degenerative diseases. On the other hand, GHS-R antagonists have anorectic effects and are likely to be useful for the treatment of obesity. = Agonists = * Adenosine * Alexamorelin * Anamorelin * Capromorelin * CP-464709 * Cortistatin-14 * Examorelin (hexarelin) * Ghrelin (lenomorelin) * GHRP-1 * GHRP-3 * GHRP-4 * GHRP-5 * GHRP-6 * Ibutamoren (MK-677) * Ipamorelin * L-692,585 * LY-426410 * LY-444711 * Macimorelin * Pralmorelin (GHRP-2) * Relamorelin * SM-130,686 * Tabimorelin * Ulimorelin =Antagonists= * A-778,193 * PF-5190457  References   Further reading  *  External links   * Ghrelin at Colorado State University Category:G protein-coupled receptors ","title":"Growth hormone secretagogue receptor"},{"id":"11546163","text":"Frederick Martin Davis (born January 15, 1986) is a former American football tight end.

He was on the USA Today All-USA second team. According to Scout.com, Davis was rated the second best wide receiver in his recruiting class coming out of high school.USC 2004 Football Recruiting Class Davis played in the 2004 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. As a high school junior, Davis considered attending Ohio State University because it was the first program to offer him an athletic scholarship. His senior season resulted in many other offers, with USC winning out with a combination of weather, location, coaches, quality players and a style of offense that suited Davis; he conversed the matter over with fellow recruit Dwayne Jarrett before they both decided to join the Trojans.LQ Singian, Exit Interview: Fred Davis , WeAreSC.com, August 21, 2008, Accessed August 24, 2008.

Rogers High School in Toledo, OH, a semester early to start spring training with the Trojans.Gary Klein, It takes a while, but Davis catches on, Los Angeles Times, September 26, 2007, Accessed August 24, 2008. Tired of the recruiting process that accompanies top prospects, Davis secretly left Ohio to enroll at USC. Recruited as a wide receiver, he showed solid speed and raw athletic ability but lacked the route- running skills and ball-catching ability of other receivers. After consulting with then-offensive coordinator Norm Chow, Davis decided to try converting to tight end. His freshman year, Davis contributed as a reserve to the eventual- national champion 2004 USC Trojans football team, playing in nine games and catching four passes behind fellow tight ends Dominique Byrd and Alex Holmes. However, because of repeated incidences of tardiness, reporting late after trips back to Ohio, Davis was not allowed to travel with the Trojans to the BCS National Championship Game in 2005 Orange Bowl. Davis reapplied himself the next season, catching 13 passes in 13 games during the 2005 season, including two in the 2006 Rose Bowl. During the 2006 season, Davis started ten games and caught 38 passes for 352 yards and three touchdowns. Notre Dame Fighting Irish Davis was a preseason team All-Pacific-10 Conference player prior to 2007 and was considered a likely high draft choice for the 2008 NFL Draft.

When asked his favorite game as a USC player, Davis noted the 2006 Rose Bowl. Professional career =Washington Redskins= 2008 season Davis was drafted in the second round of the 2008 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. On May 4, the last day of the Redskins mini-camp, Davis overslept and missed the morning practice. Head Coach Jim Zorn said that he's young, and he understands that Davis just messed up. On July 19, Davis received a four-year contract from the Redskins worth $3.5 million, including $1.8 million in bonus money. Davis was not much of a factor during the 2008 season, partially due to the lack of playing time, for the Washington Redskins. He caught three passes for 27 yards. 2009 season Davis in the 2009 preseason wearing his original jersey #86. During the 2009 season, in a Week 7 game vs. the Philadelphia Eagles, Davis caught his first touchdown and recorded a career-high 7 catches for 78 yards. Davis was playing first-string tight end for most of this game due to an injury to starter Chris Cooley. He finished the season with 48 receptions for 509 yards and 6 touchdowns. 2010 season In the 2010 season, Davis had 21 receptions for 316 receiving yards. He played in all 16 games of the season and started 9 of them. 2011 season During the 2011 preseason, Davis switched from his original jersey number of 86 to 83. In the 2011 season, Davis would eventually become the starting tight end after starter, Chris Cooley, was placed on injured reserve. In Week 14, Davis and teammate, Trent Williams, were suspended for four games after repeatedly failing league drug tests. Starting in 12 games, he finished the season recording career highs of 59 receptions and 796 yards, as well as having three touchdowns. Despite his suspension, he was named the Redskins' 2011 Offensive Player of Year. 2012 season On March 2, 2012, the Washington Redskins placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Davis. On March 16, 2012, he signed his one-year, franchise- player tender contract worth $5.446 million. After the release of Chris Cooley, he was officially named the Redskins' starting tight end. In the Week 7 game against the New York Giants, Davis tore his Achilles tendon in the first half, ending his 2012 season. Cooley was eventually brought back to replace Davis. He finished the season with 325 yards on 24 receptions and no touchdowns. 2013 season On February 26, 2013, Davis was officially cleared by medical personnel to play. Set to become an unrestricted agent, he re-signed with the Redskins on March 29 to a one-year contract. Before Davis could test the upcoming free agent market for the 2014 season, he was suspended indefinitely by the NFL for violating their substance-abuse policy. =New England Patriots= 2015 season On May 1, 2015, Davis was reinstated by the league after being suspended for roughly a year..

Overview The hospital configuration is a T-shaped fifteen-floor building currently housing 200 beds with a modern outlook. It is affiliated with The Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse and the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers. In 2005, a new state-of-the-art building was inaugurated. The rehabilitation and reconstruction of the 1968 building is underway (Phase II)- this new extension will house an additional 200 beds by the end of 2015, thus bringing the total number of beds to 400. History Saint George Hospital was founded in 1878 as a non-profit community hospital by Panoyot Fakhoury. A member of the Orthodox community, he donated two rooms in his Gemayze home to be used as a clinic and in-patient facility. A new 90-bed hospital was built in 1913, followed by another 275-bed facility in 1966. The current facility is a 200-bed hospital built in June 2004. By 2020, the hospital had 330 beds. On 4 August 2020, a series of explosions occurred about away from the hospital, at the Port of Beirut, damaging every floor of the hospital, depriving it of power, and forcing it to shut down. Doctors and nurses were treating patients in a nearby parking lot. Within hours, it discharged all its patients, some to other hospitals, and closed. The building was severely damaged The Hospital's Director of Intensive Care, Dr. Joseph Haddad, was quoted as saying, \\"There is no St. George Hospital any more. It's fallen, it's on the floor ... It's all destroyed. All of it.\\" The damage to the hospital was a severe blow to Beirut's healthcare facilities; a COVID-19 pandemic and over 6,000 injuries, as a direct result of the explosions, put great pressure on healthcare facilities. Although the hospital was forced to temporarily close after the explosion, enough restoration work was completed by the end of August to allow one floor to become operational again.https://archive.is/6b1U1https://www.the961.com/french-firefighters- beirut-high-rise-buildings/ Chief Medical Officer Alexandre Nehme estimated that it would take more than 40 million USD and about a year to bring the whole hospital back up to operational status.https://www.stgeorgehospital.org/stgeorge-donation References  External links  * Category:Teaching hospitals in Lebanon Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1913 Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1966 Category:Hospital buildings completed in 2005 Category:Buildings and structures in Beirut Category:Eastern Orthodoxy in Lebanon Category:1878 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:Hospitals established in 1878 Category:2020 Beirut explosion ","title":"Saint George Hospital University Medical Center"},{"id":"11546226","text":"Mary Burrus Williams (born September 5, 1941) is the co-author with her sister, Dixie Burrus Browning, of historical novels under the pen name Bronwyn Williams.

A church is recorded on the site as early as the 7th century, although the present structure is a Gothic Revival one, dating from the mid-19th century. It is dedicated to Saint Peter and was the Parish Church of Leeds before becoming a Minster in 2012. It has been designated a grade I listed building by English Heritage. History =The building= A church at Ledes is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 although it is likely that there had been a church on the same site for much longer, as evidenced by the fragments of Anglo-Scandinavian stone crosses (known as the Leeds Cross) found on the site during the construction of the current church. The church was rebuilt twice, after a fire in the 14th century, and again in the 19th century. Walter Farquhar Hook, Vicar of Leeds from 1837 until preferment as Dean of Chichester in 1859 was responsible for the construction of the present building, and of the revitalisation of the Anglican church throughout Leeds as a whole. The architect was Robert Dennis Chantrell. It was originally intended only to remodel the church in order to provide space for a larger congregation. In November 1837 a scheme was approved under which the tower would have been moved from the crossing to the north side, the chancel widened to the same breadth as the nave, and the north aisle roof raised. When work began, however, it was discovered that much of the structure was in a perilous condition, and it was decided to replace the church completely. The new building was the largest new church in England built since Sir Christopher Wren's St Paul's Cathedral erected after the Great Fire of London and consecrated in 1707. The new parish church was rebuilt by voluntary contributions from the townspeople at a cost of over ¬£29,000 and consecrated on 2 September 1841. Florence Nightingale and Dr Edward Bouverie Pusey were among the congregation and Dr Samuel Sebastian Wesley played the organ. The east end was altered between 1870 and 1880. The parish church became Leeds Minster in a ceremony on Sunday 2 September 2012, on the 171st anniversary of the consecration of the building. =The parish= The rambling parish of Leeds covered an area of 21,000 acres. It included in it the out-townships of Allerton, Armley, Beeston, Bramley, Farnley, Gipton, Headingley, Holbeck, Hunslet and Wortley; Adel and Whitkirk were separate parishes. On founding the Benedictine Priory of the Holy Trinity, York in 1089 Ralph Paynel granted it the right to appoint the priest and collect the tithes from the parish of Leeds. Over years, many out-townships established local chapels of ease to save parishioners the trek to the parish church: Bramley's, founded by monks at Kirkstall Abbey, may have been first, followed by Farnley's from about 1240, Beeston's from 1597, Headingley's from 1616, and Armley and Wortley's from 1649. In the town itself, the parish church was supplemented by St John's Church on New Briggate in 1634 and Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane in 1727 (both of which remained in the Parish of Leeds). The nineteenth century saw a large number of new Commissioners' Churches build throughout the parish.David Thornton, Leeds: A Historical Dictionary of People, Places and Events (Huddersfield: Northern Heritage Publications, 2013), s.v. PARISH(ES). Following the English Reformation, the right to appoint the parish's priest passed between different owners until 1588, when a group of parishioners bought it, putting it in the hands of Leeds's people. A proposal in 1650 to divide the parish came to nothing, but in 1826 St. Mark's Church in Woodhouse gained its own parish district and in 1829 St Stephen's Church in Kirkstall followed suit. However, in the 1840s two parliamentary acts provided for the creation of a wave of parishes: the Spiritual Care of Populous Parishes Act of 1843 and Walter Hook's the Leeds Vicarage Act of 1844. Under the former act were created the parishes of St. Andrew's (1845); St. Philip's (1847); Holy Trinity, Meanwood (1849); All Saints (1850); St. John's, Little Holbeck (1850); St. Matthew's, Little London (1851); St. Jude's, Hunslet (1853); St. John's, Wortley; St. Michael's, Buslingthorpe; St. Matthias's, Burley; St Barnabas, Little Holbeck (1854). Under the latter act were created the parishes of St John's Church, Briggate (1845); St. Saviour's (1846); St. Mary's, Hunslet (1847); and St. Michael's, Farnley (1851).David Thornton, Leeds: A Historical Dictionary of People, Places and Events (Huddersfield: Northern Heritage Publications, 2013), p. 333. Architecture Cruciform in plan, the minster is built in ashlar stone with slate roofs, in an imitation of the English Gothic style of the late 14th century, a period of transition from the Decorated to the Perpendicular. The church is long and wide, its tower rising to . The chancel and nave each have four bays of equal length with clerestories and tall aisles. The tower is situated at the centre of north aisle. Below the tower on the north side is the main entrance. The tower has four unequal stages with panelled sides and corner buttresses terminating in crocketed turrets with openwork battlements and crocketted pinnacles. The clock was made by Potts of Leeds. Furnishings, fittings, glass and treasures The north face of the church The windows exhibit Perpendicular tracery and there is a five-light east window from 1846 containing glass collected on the continent. At the east end the sanctuary has a marble arcade with mosaics by Salviati of Venice, and the reredos is made of coloured marble and alabaster by George Edmund Street. A peal of 13 bells was cast by Mears in 1842. These bells were then recast into the current peal by John Taylor of Loughborough in 1932. The tenor bell weighs . The organ, parts of which date from 1841 and earlier, is essentially a Harrison and Harrison of 1914 vintage, but incorporating significant amounts of pipework by Edmund Schulze. It was restored in 1927 and 1949 by Harrison and Harrison; in 1965 by Wood, Wordsworth and in 1997 by Andrew Carter. The restoration of the blowing plant and refurbishment of the blower house were undertaken in 1997 by Allfab Engineering of Methley. Among many artefacts and memorials in the Minster are the Anglo-Saxon Leeds Cross (an Anglian cross to the south of the marble pavement known as the altar flat) the pieces of which were discovered in 1838 when the medieval church was demolished. There is also a brass commemorating Captain Oates of Scott's Antarctic expedition, who had Leeds connections. Flemish stained glass enhances the apse of Chantrell's interior ‚Äì he designed the windows to fit the glass ‚Äì and of more recent date (1997) is Sally Scott's Angel Screen at the north tower porch entrance, an example of contemporary glass engraving and a gift from the family of Lord Marshall of Leeds. The Christopher Beckett memorial and most of the architectural sculpture is by Robert Mawer.Leeds Times, Saturday 18 November 1854 p5: The late Mr Mawer\\", and p.8: \\"Deaths\\". Outside in the churchyard, facing out onto Kirkgate, is the Leeds Rifles War Memorial, which was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and unveiled on 13 November 1921. It is separately a grade II listed building. Minster Interior of the Parish Church. The Minster and Parish Church of Saint Peter-at-Leeds is in the Diocese of Leeds (which has its cathedrals at Ripon, Wakefield and Bradford), in the Parish of Leeds City along with the Georgian Church of Holy Trinity, Boar Lane and the congregation of St Mary's Lincoln Green worshipping weekly in the Hall of St Peter's Church of England Primary School, Cromwell Street, Burmantofts. The minster is at the easternmost extremity of the city centre, within a precinct bordering two of the city's oldest thoroughfares - Kirkgate (now part of the Inner City Loop Road) to the north, and The Calls to the south. Another ancient pathway, High Court Ings, connects the western precinct with High Court. The Reverend Canon Sam Corley is the Priest-in-Charge and Rector-Designate of Leeds Minster, he was licensed at Leeds Minster on 6 October 2015 Work with young people undertaken by the parish includes The Market Place drop-in centre. During choir terms there are at least three choral services each week sung by an adult chamber choir of skilled volunteers and choral scholars drawn from Leeds and York Universities as well as Leeds College of Music. There is a weekly organ recital from September to July inclusive on Fridays at 12.30pm, featuring the resident organists and guest recitalists. Leeds Minster is a member of the Greater Churches Group. Its mission and vision for future service to the city, the diocese and the Church of England are a constant care and concern of those who seek to serve the church and parish. Sir John Betjeman in a BBC Broadcast remarked that: \\"There's High Church, Low Church and Leeds Parish Church\\". The church is illuminated at night by floodlights donated by Tetley's brewery. The building is open to visitors for at least seven hours each day. Parishioner volunteers serve refreshments and light meals in the refectory in the City of Leeds Room constructed in the north-west aisle in 1975. The minster archives are held at the Leeds office of West Yorkshire Archive Service. The church has memorials to families who were prominent in the parish, including the Kitchingman, Fenton, Lodge, Milner, Cookson, and Ibbetsons. Present On 2 September 2012 Leeds Parish Church became a minster; it may be designated the pro-cathedral of the new Diocese of Leeds if the diocesan bishop so decides.

They lack opioid activity but are potent stimulators of growth hormone (GH) release. These secretagogues are distinct from growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) in that they share no sequence relation and derive their function through activation of a completely different receptor. This receptor was originally called the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), but due to subsequent discoveries, the hormone ghrelin is now considered the receptor's natural endogenous ligand, and it has been renamed as the ghrelin receptor. Therefore, these GHSR agonists act as synthetic ghrelin mimetics. It has been discovered that when GHRP-6 and insulin are administered simultaneously, GH response to GHRP-6 is increased (1). However, the consumption of carbohydrates and/or dietary fats, around the administration window of GH secretagogues significantly blunts the GH release. A recent study in normal mice showed significant differences in body composition, muscle growth, glucose metabolism, memory and cardiac function in the mice being administered the GHRP-6 (2).

Larrabee is the codename for a cancelled GPGPU chip that Intel was developing separately from its current line of integrated graphics accelerators. It is named after Larrabee State Park in Whatcom County, Washington, near the town of Bellingham. The chip was to be released in 2010 as the core of a consumer 3D graphics card, but these plans were cancelled due to delays and disappointing early performance figures. The project to produce a GPU retail product directly from the Larrabee research project was terminated in May 2010 and its technology was passed on to the Xeon Phi. The Intel MIC multiprocessor architecture announced in 2010 inherited many design elements from the Larrabee project, but does not function as a graphics processing unit; the product is intended as a co-processor for high performance computing. Almost a decade later, on June 12, 2018; the idea of an Intel dedicated GPU was revived again (as the Intel Xe) with Intel's desire to create a discrete GPU, set to launch by 2020. Whether this new development is connected to the developments of Larabee remain uncertain, however. Project status On December 4, 2009, Intel officially announced that the first- generation Larrabee would not be released as a consumer GPU product. Instead, it was to be released as a development platform for graphics and high- performance computing. The official reason for the strategic reset was attributed to delays in hardware and software development. On May 25, 2010, the Technology@Intel blog announced that Larrabee would not be released as a GPU, but instead would be released as a product for high-performance computing competing with the Nvidia Tesla. The project to produce a GPU retail product directly from the Larrabee research project was terminated in May 2010. The Intel MIC multiprocessor architecture announced in 2010 inherited many design elements from the Larrabee project, but does not function as a graphics processing unit; the product is intended as a co-processor for high performance computing. The prototype card was named Knights Ferry, a production card built at a 22 nm process named Knights Corner was planned for production in 2012 or later. Comparison with competing products According to Intel, Larrabee has a fully programmable pipeline, in contrast to current generation graphics cards which are only partially programmable. Larrabee can be considered a hybrid between a multi-core CPU and a GPU, and has similarities to both. Its coherent cache hierarchy and x86 architecture compatibility are CPU-like, while its wide SIMD vector units and texture sampling hardware are GPU-like. As a GPU, Larrabee would have supported traditional rasterized 3D graphics (Direct3D & OpenGL) for games. However, its hybridization of CPU and GPU features should also have been suitable for general purpose GPU (GPGPU) or stream processing tasks. For example, it might have performed ray tracing or physics processing, in real time for games or offline for scientific research as a component of a supercomputer. Larrabee's early presentation drew some criticism from GPU competitors. At NVISION 08, an Nvidia employee called Intel's SIGGRAPH paper about Larrabee \\"marketing puff\\" and quoted an industry analyst (Peter Glaskowsky) who speculated that the Larrabee architecture was \\"like a GPU from 2006\\". By June 2009, Intel claimed that prototypes of Larrabee were on par with the Nvidia GeForce GTX 285. Justin Rattner, Intel CTO, delivered a keynote at the Supercomputing 2009 conference on November 17, 2009. During his talk he demonstrated an overclocked Larrabee processor topping one teraFLOPS in performance. He claimed this was the first public demonstration of a single-chip system exceeding one teraFLOPS. He pointed out this was early silicon, thereby leaving open the question on eventual performance for the architecture. Because this was only one fifth that of available competing graphics boards, Larrabee was cancelled \\"as a standalone discrete graphics product\\" on December 4, 2009. =Differences with contemporary GPUs= Larrabee was intended to differ from older discrete GPUs such as the GeForce 200 Series and the Radeon 4000 series in three major ways: * It was to use the x86 instruction set with Larrabee-specific extensions. * It was to feature cache coherency across all its cores. * It was to include very little specialized graphics hardware, instead performing tasks like z-buffering, clipping, and blending in software, using a tile-based rendering approach. This had been expected to make Larrabee more flexible than current GPUs, allowing more differentiation in appearance between games or other 3D applications. Intel's SIGGRAPH 2008 paper mentioned several rendering features that were difficult to achieve on current GPUs: render target read, order-independent transparency, irregular shadow mapping, and real-time raytracing. More recent GPUs such as ATI's Radeon HD 5xxx and Nvidia's GeForce 400 Series feature increasingly broad general-purpose computing capabilities via DirectX11 DirectCompute and OpenCL, as well as Nvidia's proprietary CUDA technology, giving them many of the capabilities of Larrabee. =Differences with CPUs= The x86 processor cores in Larrabee differed in several ways from the cores in current Intel CPUs such as the Core 2 Duo or Core i7: * Its x86 cores were based on the much simpler P54C Pentium design which is still being maintained for use in embedded applications. The P54C-derived core is superscalar but does not include out-of-order execution, though it has been updated with modern features such as x86-64 support, similar to the Bonnell microarchitecture used in Atom. In-order execution means lower performance for individual cores, but since they are smaller, more can fit on a single chip, increasing overall throughput. Execution is also more deterministic so instruction and task scheduling can be done by the compiler. * Each core contained a 512-bit vector processing unit, able to process 16 single precision floating point numbers at a time. This is similar to, but four times larger than, the SSE units on most x86 processors, with additional features like scatter/gather instructions and a mask register designed to make using the vector unit easier and more efficient. Larrabee was to derive most of its number-crunching power from these vector units. * It included one major fixed-function graphics hardware feature: texture sampling units. These perform trilinear and anisotropic filtering and texture decompression. * It had a 1024-bit (512-bit each way) ring bus for communication between cores and to memory. This bus can be configured in two modes to support Larrabee products with 16 cores or more, or fewer than 16 cores. * It included explicit cache control instructions to reduce cache thrashing during streaming operations which only read/write data once. Explicit prefetching into L2 or L1 cache is also supported. * Each core supported four-way interleaved multithreading, with four copies of each processor register. Theoretically Larrabee's x86 processor cores would have been able to run existing PC software, or even operating systems. A different version of the processor might sit in motherboard CPU sockets using QuickPath, but Intel never announced any plans for this. Though Larrabee's native C/C++ compiler included auto-vectorization and many applications were able to execute correctly after having been recompiled, maximum efficiency was expected to have required code optimization using C++ vector intrinsics or inline Larrabee assembly code. However, as in all GPGPUs, not all software would have benefited from utilization of a vector processing unit. One tech journalism site claims that Larrabee's graphics capabilities were planned to be integrated in CPUs based on the Haswell microarchitecture. =Comparison with the Cell broadband engine= Larrabee's philosophy of using many small, simple cores was similar to the ideas behind the Cell processor. There are some further commonalities, such as the use of a high-bandwidth ring bus to communicate between cores. However, there were many significant differences in implementation which were expected to make programming Larrabee simpler. * The Cell processor includes one main processor which controls many smaller processors. Additionally, the main processor can run an operating system. In contrast, all of Larrabee's cores are the same, and the Larrabee was not expected to run an OS. * Each computer core in the Cell (SPE) has a local store, for which explicit (DMA) operations are used for all accesses to DRAM. Ordinary reads and writes to DRAM are not allowed. In Larrabee, all on-chip and off-chip memories are under automatically managed coherent cache hierarchy, so that its cores virtually shared a uniform memory space through standard copy (MOV) instructions. Larrabee cores each had 256 KB of local L2 cache, and an access which hits another L2 segment takes longer to access. * Because of the cache coherency noted above, each program running in Larrabee had virtually a large linear memory just as in traditional general-purpose CPU; whereas an application for Cell should be programmed taking into consideration limited memory footprint of the local store associated with each SPE (for details see this article) but with theoretically higher bandwidth. However, since local L2 is faster to access, an advantage can still be gained from using Cell-style programming methods. * Cell uses DMA for data transfer to and from on-chip local memories, which enables explicit maintenance of overlays stored in local memory to bring memory closer to the core and reduce access latencies, but requiring additional effort to maintain coherency with main memory; whereas Larrabee used a coherent cache with special instructions for cache manipulation (notably cache eviction hints and pre-fetch instructions), which mitigated miss and eviction penalties and reduce cache pollution (e.g. for rendering pipelines and other stream-like computation) at the cost of additional traffic and overhead to maintain cache coherency. * Each compute core in the Cell runs only one thread at a time, in-order. A core in Larrabee ran up to four threads, but only one at a time. Larrabee's hyperthreading helped hide the latencies inherent to in-order execution. =Comparison with Intel GMA= Intel began integrating a line of GPUs onto motherboards under the Intel GMA brand in 2004. Being integrated onto motherboards (newer versions, such as those released with Sandy Bridge, are incorporated onto the same die as the CPU) these chips were not sold separately. Though the low cost and power consumption of Intel GMA chips made them suitable for small laptops and less demanding tasks, they lack the 3D graphics processing power to compete with contemporary Nvidia and AMD/ATI GPUs for a share of the high-end gaming computer market, the HPC market, or a place in popular video game consoles. In contrast, Larrabee was to be sold as a discrete GPU, separate from motherboards, and was expected to perform well enough for consideration in the next generation of video game consoles. The team working on Larrabee was separate from the Intel GMA team. The hardware was designed by a newly formed team at Intel's Hillsboro, Oregon, site, separate from those that designed the Nehalem. The software and drivers were written by a newly formed team. The 3D stack specifically was written by developers at RAD Game Tools (including Michael Abrash). The Intel Visual Computing Institute will research basic and applied technologies that could be applied to Larrabee-based products. Projected performance data Benchmarking results from the SIGGRAPH paper, showing predicted performance as an approximate linear function of the number of processing cores Intel's SIGGRAPH 2008 paper describes cycle-accurate simulations (limitations of memory, caches and texture units was included) of Larrabee's projected performance. Graphs show how many 1 GHz Larrabee cores are required to maintain 60 frame/s at 1600√ó1200 resolution in several popular games. Roughly 25 cores are required for Gears of War with no antialiasing, 25 cores for F.E.A.R with 4√ó antialiasing, and 10 cores for Half-Life 2: Episode 2 with 4√ó antialiasing. Intel claimed that Larrabee would likely run faster than 1 GHz, so these numbers do not represent actual cores, rather virtual timeslices of such. Another graph shows that performance on these games scales nearly linearly with the number of cores up to 32 cores. At 48 cores the performance drops to 90% of what would be expected if the linear relationship continued. A June 2007 PC Watch article suggested that the first Larrabee chips would feature 32 x86 processor cores and come out in late 2009, fabricated on a 45 nanometer process. Chips with a few defective cores due to yield issues would be sold as a 24-core version. Later in 2010, Larrabee would be shrunk for a 32 nanometer fabrication process to enable a 48-core version.translation The last statement of performance can be calculated (theoretically this is maximum possible performance) as follows: 32 cores √ó 16 single-precision float SIMD/core √ó 2 FLOP (fused multiply-add) √ó 2 GHz = 2 TFLOPS theoretically. Public demonstrations A public demonstration of the Larrabee architecture took place at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on September 22, 2009. An early port of the former CPU-based research project Quake Wars: Ray Traced was shown in real-time. The scene contained a ray traced water surface that reflected the surrounding objects, like a ship and several flying vehicles, accurately. A second demo was given at the SC09 conference in Portland at November 17, 2009 during a keynote by Intel CTO Justin Rattner. A Larrabee card was able to achieve 1006 GFLops in the SGEMM 4Kx4K calculation. An engineering sample of a Larrabee card was procured and reviewed by Linus Sebastian in a video published May 14, 2018. He was unable to make the card give video output however, with the motherboard displaying POST code D6.

Four of these segments focus upon alleged events in the private lives of the film actresses Alida Valli, Ingrid Bergman, Isa Miranda, and Anna Magnani. The fifth segment, which is shown as the prologue and titled \\"Concorso: 4 Attrici; 1 Speranza\\", is about a casting for the film. It was shot at the Titanus Studios in Rome. The sets were designed by the art director Gianni Polidori. Plots =\\"Concorso: 4 Attrici; 1 Speranza\\" (\\"Contest: 4 Actresses; 1 Hope\\") a.k.a. \\"Four stars and a starlet\\"= Anna Amendola decides to leave her home to become an actress, even though her mother says that she can not come back if she does. She goes to Titanus film studios, where a casting is taking place to find a girl to be included in a segment of Siamo donne. The contest begins with the girls walking through a line, where they are checked for certain requirements, especially age. The ones who pass this stage are given a meal by the studio, while a spotlight scans through the tables, finding girls for the screen test stage. Amendola passes through these stages. Then, there are a series of screen tests, where several girls are asked questions about their dreams and ambitions. The results of the screen tests are not decided until the next day; therefore, Amendola sleeps at a neighbor's house, since she does not want to go home and forfeit her chances of winning the contest. The next day, she is called up as a finalist, along with Emma Danieli. The story ends with the two finalists about to give interviews. =\\"Alida Valli\\"= Alida Valli is invited by her masseuse, Anna, to an engagement party that night. Valli starts her evening by going to a dance, where she dances with a producer and gives a radio interview. However, the dance bores her, which causes her to go to the engagement party. At the engagement party, the guests treat her like a star, which makes her feel like a \\"freak in a sideshow\\". Then, she is asked to dance with Anna's fianc√©, a railroad engineer. A mutual attraction springs up between the two, which Anna notices. In order to restore Anna's confidence, Alida Valli decides to leave the party immediately. The story ends with Alida Valli being driven away, while little kids are chasing after the car, asking for her autograph. =\\"Ingrid Bergman\\" a.k.a. \\"The Chicken\\"= Ingrid Bergman notices that her roses have been destroyed. At first she suspects it is her dogs or her children, but later on notices a chicken walking around the area of her roses. The chicken belongs to the proprietress. Ingrid Bergman asks the proprietress to restrain the chicken, but the proprietress refuses to take effective measures. Therefore, the chicken finds its way back to the roses. In order to resolve the dilemma, Ingrid Bergman comes up with a plan of her own. She kidnaps the chicken and tries to have her dog scare it. However, when guests arrive, she hides the chicken in a pantry closet. The story ends when the proprietress comes and takes back the chicken, after hearing its clucking. =\\"Isa Miranda\\"= Isa Miranda has portraits of herself, awards, film memorabilia, and even an Oscar. However, she does not have any children. When driving home from the studio one day, she sees an explosion. She stops the car and sees a boy holding his arm. A man helps put the boy into her car, and she drives to the hospital. At the hospital, the boy is treated for his injuries. Miranda then takes the boy home, where she notices several other children unattended. Since the mother is away, she decides to put the boy to bed and to take care of the other children until the mother comes home. During this experience, she regrets never having children. The story ends with her reentering her empty apartment and answering a ringing telephone. =\\"Anna Magnani\\"= On the way to a singing engagement, Anna Magnani and a taxi driver have an argument over whether her dog is a lap dog, since it costs one lira more to carry a non-lap dog in a taxi. In order to dispute this charge, she first presents the case to a policeman on the street, who charges her 14.50 lira because her dog does not have a license. She then takes it to police station, where both the sergeant and the captain decide that it is a lap dog. Upon hearing this, the taxi driver states that he was ignorant and was acting in good faith. The taxi driver then takes her to her singing engagement, where he charges her 14.50 lira for cab fare. In addition, he charges her one lira for the dog, even though he was just informed that it was a lap dog. She ends up paying the extra lira. The story ends with Magnani singing a song.

He has also written a novel entitled The Broederbond Conspiracy, fondly called the \\"Black James Bond\\". The author is sad that Black actors continue to clamor to play the role of James Bond without success, hence he decided to write \\"The Broederbond Conspiracy\\" to fulfill the aspirations of Blacks to play the James Bond role. Overview =Synopsis= Capitalist Nigger asserts that the Black Race is a consumer race and not a productive one. Says the author, Chika Onyeani, \\"We are a conquered race and it is utterly foolish for us to believe that we are independent. The Black Race depends on other communities for its culture, its language, its feeding, and its clothing.\\" \\"Despite enormous natural resources,\\" according to author, \\"Blacks are economic slaves because they lack the \\"killer-instinct\\" and \\"devil-may-care\\" attitude of the Caucasian, as well as the \\"spider web economic mentality\\" of the Asian.\\" The author is not afraid to use the word 'nigger' in both pejorative or stereotypic senses. He says, \\"It is not what you call me, but what I answer to, that matters most.\\" = Status of Blacks = The book asserts that \\"Blacks are economic slaves. We are owned lock stock and barrel by people of European-origin ... I am tired of hearing Blacks always blaming others for their lack of progress in this world; I am tired of the whining and victim-mentality. I am tired of listening to the same complaint, day in day out - racism this, racism that. It's getting us nowhere.\\" \\"Africans have a stance, 'live for today, let tomorrow take care of itself and be damned' attitude,\\" the author says. \\"We've become a sheep-like consumer race that depends on other communities for our culture, language, feeding, and clothing. We've become economic slaves in Western society.\\" The argument that Blacks must become economically self-reliant and foster collective partnering relationships is not new. It has been voiced by such notable figures as Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, Frantz Fanon, Marcus Garvey, Steve Biko, Ezekiel Mphahlele, Thabo Mbeki, and Malcolm X. =\\"Spider web doctrine\\"= The basis of Onyeani's argument is that Blacks must mimic Asian people and adopt what he calls a \\"spider-web doctrine\\". According to Onyeani, by adopting this economic concept Blacks will be able to attract wealth to their communities, and trap it there as a spider traps flies. This is the basis for the book's assertions; that Blacks must only purchase Black-manufactured goods, patronize Black stores, or eat in Black establishments, etc. Response =Criticism= The book has received a large amount of criticism in a number of areas. It relies heavily on up to date racial stereotypes of Black, Caucasian, Jewish, Chinese, Japanese and Indian peoples. Specifically, author Onyeani's argument relies on dubious stereotypes, that blacks are \\"lazy\\" and that Indians are successful and entrepreneurial. Onyeani ignores the wealth divide in China and India, nations he deems successful because of their accomplishments in the manufacture of goods. In an article in the South African weekly Mail & Guardian, he commented that the success of Indian society can be shown because \\"In India, the larger part of the population is still poor. So what? India is leading in a lot of ways. If you make a call to [a] credit card company, chances are it would be answered in India. Just because of the way they have been able to do the (sic) things.\\" =Accusations of inaccuracies and hypocrisy= A few of his most inaccurate comments and racial stereotypes include: \\"In Africa there are more Mercedes Benz, BMW (sic) and Jaguars than there are people.\\" \\"There is nothing in Africa that is owned by the people.\\" One notable contradiction is when he calls for adoption of the spider web doctrine, but then cautions successful 'capitalist niggers' (like himself) to keep other Blacks at arm's length. =Stereotypes and racism= Stereotypes include the exceptional intelligence and capability of the Jews, the industrious nature of Asians, and the \\"killer instinct\\" and \\"devil-may-care\\" tenacity of Caucasians. Blacks are described as whiners, passive, economically illiterate, intellectually bankrupt and materialistic. On the final page of the book, Onyeani gives his reason for writing the book (which he claims changed his life); that it would be a success and he would \\"make a lot of money.\\" =Reviews= Pan-Africanist director Owen 'Alik Shahadah praises the core thesis of the book by stating in his article on African agency that the inferiority complex is an overlooked phenomenon, which washes all aspects of African life. He continues by stating that Capitalist Nigger is a daring expose of a deep problem of \\"Africans being products not producers\\", Shahadah goes on to state the \\"naturally these kinds of agendas which destroy White economic privilege in Africa will not be welcomed by all those that continue to profit from an economically weak African nation.\\" A review article in the Financial Mail by Dr Stella M Nkomo (Professor of Management at the University of South Africa's Graduate School of Business Leadership) levied heavy criticism at Onyeani. The article noted that \\"Onyeani has no qualms about degrading not just an entire group of people but himself as well.\\" She further commented, \\" The notion that Black people should aspire to be 'White' is both insulting and degrading.\\" commented that \\"Onyeani is entitled to his opinions about black people. He is, however, not entitled to his gratuitous insults.\\" Onyeani was asked in an interview the question of what is stopping blacks from doing what they need to do? He replied simply \\"inferiority complex\\". Further writing =Why Blacks Can't Run= Why Blacks Can't Run is the title of an upcoming book by Chika Onyeani that also deals with the economic status of both blacks in Africa and around the world. It is considered a sequel to Capitalist Nigger. =The Broederbond Conspiracy= The Broederbond Conspiracy is a fiction book also written by Dr. Onyeani. The book is about a fictional Nigerian Secret Service agent named Chima Amadi. In the book, he fights against a conspiracy organized by the Apartheid-era white supremacist organization the Broederbond.

These can take the position of either centre-left, left-wing or far-left. The largest political party associated with the British Left is the Labour Party, which is also the biggest political party in the UK by membership levels, with over 580,000 members. Labour has 202 seats in the House of Commons, and has been the Official Opposition since May 2010. The current Leader of the Labour Party is Keir Starmer, who was first elected on 4 April 2020. The second largest party on the British Left, by membership, is the centre-left Scottish National Party (SNP), which has over 125,000 members despite only being active in Scotland. The third largest party on the British Left is the Green Party of England and Wales, whose membership reached 50,000 in September 2019. The party has one Member of Parliament, Caroline Lucas, who was first elected as the MP for Brighton Pavilion at the 2010 general election. She was also Leader of the party from 2008‚Äì2012 and then co-leader with Jonathan Bartley from 2016‚Äì2018. The other three political parties on the left and with representation in parliament are the centre-left Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) of Northern Ireland; the left-wing Plaid Cymru, who are only active in Wales and Sinn F√©in, also from Northern Ireland. The SNP has 48 MPs, Plaid has four MPs and Sinn F√©in has seven MPs, but Sinn F√©in does not sit in Westminster as it refuses to take the parliamentary Oath of Allegiance. In total the British Left therefore have 255 out of 650 MPs. History Active in Britain =Labour Party= Labour Party individual membership, excluding affiliated members and supporters (1928‚Äì2019) The biggest party on the left in the UK in terms of members and representation is the Labour Party, which was founded as the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) in 1900. With the party's rebranding as \\"New Labour\\" in the 1990s under the leadership of Tony Blair, the party accepted a number of economic policies associated with the right causing it to be identified as centrist rather than socialist, and was no longer considered as being a party of the Left; Blair himself described New Labour's ideology as \\"Third Way\\", like Bill Clinton's Democratic Party in the United States. The Labour Party under Blair's leadership accepted many of the neoliberal economic policies enforced by the previous Conservative governments. When Ed Miliband was elected as Leader of the Labour Party in 2010, he announced the abandonment of the New Labour agenda, and promised to return to socialism,\\"Ed Miliband: I'm bringing socialism back to Britain\\", The Telegraph, September 2013. clamp down on tax avoidance, introduce a wealth tax in the form of a Mansion Tax, raise income tax for high earners and break up the banks.\\"Labour will restore 50p top rate of income tax, says Ed Balls\\", The Guardian, January 2014 The party was subsequently criticised by some, including Tony Blair himself; as straying leftwards from the \\"centre ground\\" of British politics, and that Miliband was a \\"traditional left-wing\\" politician. However, others disputed this view, and put Labour's loss at the 2015 general election down to the party being too right-wing. The unexpected landslide victory of Jeremy Corbyn at the subsequent Labour Party leadership election in September 2015 represented a revival of the Labour left-wing and led to a huge increase in membership; in the Cabinet reshuffle that followed, John McDonnell (chairman of the Labour Representation Committee) and Diane Abbott (member of the Socialist Campaign Group) were both appointed to the Shadow Cabinet. While not winning, Labour made modest improvements at the 2017 general election which was taken as a vindication by some of the left turn. The party fell in the 2019 general election to its lowest share of seats since 1935, although many believe this was due to a complicated manifesto and Brexit policy, a poor approach to campaigning and the unpopularity of Corbyn. Labour's status as a socialist party has been disputed by those who do not see the party as being part of the Left, although the general consensus is that Labour are a left-wing political party.

Several factors contributed, including the collapse of the Lib Dem vote, the influence of social media and greater awareness among younger people about the rise of other left-wing parties in Europe such as: Podemos in Spain and Syriza in Greece, as well as a rise in anti-austerity movements across the UK and Europe.See: list of political parties in the United Kingdom opposed to austerity. Other factors included the Scottish independence referendum, which proved to be an inspiration for a new kind of politics. Other key factors had been the contrast in conferences of the Green Party and Labour in September 2014, and the media exclusion of the Greens during and following their successes at the European elections; a petition against the media blackout of the Green Party reached 260,000 signatures. The party also received a significant spike in membership during January 2015 following David Cameron's demand that the Greens be included in the leaders' debates for the 2015 general election. The Green Party has been included in a seven-way television debate. The Greens' 2015 spring conference had a record 1,300 members attend; the party became the second-largest of the European Greens in this period, as well as increasing significantly in national polls from an average 1% to 7%. It beat the Liberal Democrats to fourth place at the 2014 European Elections with 8%, under a proportional voting system, having a third MEP elected. However the Greens achieved only a 1.6% vote share at the 2017 general election, following a rejection by Labour of an election pact and an increase in vote share by the two major parties. The status of the Greens as a party of the Left has, along with Labour; been disputed. Internal groups *Green Left =Other organisations= The now defunct Respect Party (formed in 2004), which at one point had the support of other Left groups (such as the Socialist Workers Party and Socialist Resistance) and some electoral success, lost its last local councillors in 2014Helen Pidd \\"Labour gains control of Bradford as Respect fail\\" theguardian.com (The Northerner Blog), 23 May 2014 and its sole MP George Galloway - who was also the party leader.

As of 2016, TUSC had a small number of affiliated local councillors. Following the 2015 election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, TUSC floated plans for a future electoral pact with any Labour councillors standing on an anti-austerity platform; subsequently TUSC stood fewer candidates in the 2016 and 2017 local elections, based on a case by case reckoning of the political stance of local Labour candidates.http://www.tusc.org.uk/txt/400.pdf In May 2017, TUSC confirmed that it would stand no candidates at the forthcoming general election, and give full support to Labour. In 2018, TUSC suspended electoral activity until further notice. A new party, Left Unity, was formed in November 2013 and backed by a number of existing left-wing parties. Left Unity had an electoral pact with TUSC for the 2015 elections but has since renounced independent electoral activity in favour of Labour. The Communist Party of Britain (CPB), is a split from (and effectively the political successor to) the historical Communist Party of Great Britain, once the largest British far- left organisation. In 2017, the CPB announced that it would field no candidates at that year's general election, and give support to Labour instead. Some small left and far-left parties continue to contest elections independently, such as the Socialist Party of Great Britain (the oldest extant left-wing political party, having formed in 1904). Other parties and groups are electorally inactive, renounce participation in elections, or work unofficially in support of, or advocate a vote for, the Labour Party.

He added to his honors when he was selected as the tournament MVP in 1974. In addition, he was an NAIA second team All American in 1974 and an Honorable Mention in 1975. In 1982, the NAIA inducted Pollihan into its soccer Hall of Fame. He has also been inducted into the Quincy University Hall of Fame. =Professional= On January 14, 1976, the Rochester Lancers of the North American Soccer League (NASL) drafted Pollihan in the first round of the NASL College Draft. The Los Angeles Skyhawks of the American Soccer League also drafted Pollihan, but he signed with the Lancers. Pollihan spent five seasons with the Lancers until the team folded at the end of the 1980 season. In 1978, the New York Arrows of Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) began to prepare for both the team's and the league's first season. Rather than building a roster from scratch, the team decided to sign the Rochester Lancers players as its team. On December 22, 1978, the Arrows played the Cincinnati Kids in the league's first game. Pollihan, despite being a defender, scored the game's, the team's, and the league's first goal.MISL: The Early Years Pollihan won the league championship with the Arrows that season, then went on to spend another five seasons in the MISL. He played from 1979 to 1980 with the Houston Summit and from 1980 to 1984 with the Baltimore Blast. =National team= Pollihan earned fifteen caps with the U.S. national team between 1976 and 1979. His first game came when he started a September 24, 1976 tie with Canada. He played one more game a month later, then did not appear for the U.S. again for another year. He played in about half the U.S. games through 1977 and 1979. His last cap came in a crushing 6-0 loss to France on May 2, 1979. Coaching Pollihan was an assistant coach with the Baltimore Blast as early was the fall of 1986. He resigned from the Blast on August 16, 1991 in order to become the head coach of the Harrisburg Heat. In 1991, the Harrisburg Heat an expansion franchise with the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) hired Pollihan as the club's first coach.\\"Adding Attack toughens Wave's division in NPSL\\" Milwaukee Sentinel Wednesday, September 18, 1991 He took the Heat into the playoffs each of his seven seasons as head coach. In 1995, the Heat went to the championship series only to fall to the St. Louis Ambush. Pollihan was also the 1991‚Äì1992 NPSL Coach of the Year. After handing over the coaching reins to Richard Chinapoo in 1999, Pollihan moved into the team's front office as the Vice President of Soccer Operations, a position he held until January 2003.

The shoulder-in is a lateral movement in dressage used to supple and balance the horse and encourage use of its hindquarters. It is performed on three tracks, where the horse is bent around the rider's inside leg so that the horse's inside hind leg and outside foreleg travel on the same line. For some authors it is a \\"key lesson\\" of dressage, performed on a daily basis.Cf. Loriston-Clarke, p. 84. - Also: \\"The shoulder-in is a key lesson of advanced dressage training because many features of the correctly ridden horse are represented in this movement.\\", translated from the German Richtlinien, p. 50.  History  In the seventeenth century, Antoine de Pluvinel used the basic shoulder-in exercise to increase the horse's suppleness and to get the animal used to the aids, especially the leg aids. He felt the exercise helped to make the horse obedient. Independently, the Duke of Newcastle developed the exercise. In the eighteenth century, the French riding master Francois Robichon de la Gueriniere adapted the movement for use on straight lines.  Performance  In the shoulder-in, the shoulder of the horse is brought to the inside, creating a 30-degree-angle with the rail, with the neck bent only the slightest amount, only softening in the jaw so that the corner of the eye is visible to the rider. The horse's hind legs track straight forward along the line of travel while the front legs move laterally, with the inside foreleg crossing in front of the outside foreleg and the inside hind hoof tracking into or beyond the hoofprint made by the outside foreleg. Because the horse is bending away from the direction of travel, the movement requires a certain amount of collection. The shoulder-in can be performed at any forward gait, but in dressage competition it is usually ridden only at the trot. A young horse is first introduced to the movement when coming out of a corner or a circle on which the horse is already correctly bent, from nose to tail, along the arc of the corner or circle, as it is usually easier to maintain bend than to establish it from a straight line in the young or green (untrained) horse. The rider is positioned on the horse in a manner similar to riding a circle or corner, with the shoulders aligned to mirror the angle of the horse's shoulders, while the rider's hips and legs mirror the position of the horse's hind legs. Thus, as the circle becomes the shoulder-in, the rider's shoulders are turned to the inside, while his/her hips remain \\"straight\\" on the track. The rider uses the inside leg at the girth to maintain the bend and encourage the horse to step under its body with its inside hind leg, while the rider's outside leg prevents the horse's haunches from swinging out. The outside rein steadies the horse and helps maintain the correct bend, while the inside rein is used with a giving hand. The rider's back and position in the saddle shift toward the horse's outside shoulder in order to restrain the horse from moving off the track, maintaining movement along the track. Common errors include use of the inside rein to create the bend for the shoulder-in. Doing so creates too much bend in the horse's neck compared to its body,\\"Too much neck bend and no angle\\" is one of the \\"common faults\\". Davison, p. 54. and may also pull the horse off the track. The inside rein only asks for flexion, and if the horse is correctly on the aids, the inside rein can be loose. Variants of the Shoulder-In include the Shoulder-fore, where less angle is asked, and a four- track movement is created. This is a useful exercise for the younger horse, and can be used in canter work to negate a horse's natural tendency toward crookedness.

As of the 2011 Canadian Census, the population was 4,070. History Danville is on a stretch of the Chemin Craig, a road built in the 19th century connecting Quebec to New England. The town is about north of the Vermont border. American loyalists from New England began arriving in 1783 and gave the town its name in memory of their hometown in Vermont of the same name: Danville, Vermont. The founder of Danville was Simeon Flint, who was a resident from Danville, Vermont. Until about 1971, the population of Danville was majority Anglo-Protestant. However, in the mid-1970s, many of the younger generation migrated to English Canada, Greater Montreal, or New England. There are many heritage buildings, including three Protestant churches (Christian Adventist, Presbyterian, and United Church of Canada), two Anglican churches, an Evangelical Baptist church and a Roman Catholic church. The Presbyterian church has been retrofitted into a four-star restaurant, and the Christian Advent church has been a private residence since 2007, following its closing in 2006. The Catholic church was erected in 2003, following the 2001 loss by fire of the earlier church erected in 1891. The current United church was completed in 1875 for a Congregational parish and is the oldest church in the town. One of the two Anglican Church of England churches is located on a historic site on the countryside, near the border of the Shipton Township, Denison Mills. Danville has two primary schools: a French language school, √âcole Masson, and an English-speaking school, known as ADS (Asbestos-Shipton- Danville). At the centre of the city is a square formed by the enlargement of an intersection. A memorial for soldiers killed in the First World War, the Second World War, and the Korea War is in the centre of the square. Another memorial, to Private Timothy O'Hea, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is erected in front of the former City Hall. Once a busy town inhabited by workers of the nearby Johns Manville asbestos mine, the town has quieted down considerably since the mine's closing. A magnesium smelter named Magnola, part of Noranda, using mine tailings from local asbestos mine, was set up in the town for a short time, but it ended up closing due to increasing foreign competition. The bucolic rolling fields in the area are good for farming, with many farms having been around for over a century. Both dairy and beef cattle are raised in the area although other livestock are also common. Each year, the town has an art symposium in which artists from the area gather in the town's many churches and display their artwork.

SS Yale then began conversion to a coastal minelayer at the New York Navy Yard. Classified CMc-3 on 30 December 1940 and renamed USS Wassuc on 10 January 1941, the ship was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 15 May 1941.  East Coast operations After commissioning, USS Wassuc proceeded south; touched at Norfolk, Virginia; and then sailed back northward to the Washington Navy Yard where she arrived on 4 June. She subsequently moved to the Mine Warfare School at Yorktown, Virginia, on 23 June, where she relieved , freeing that minesweeper to begin an overhaul. During her service at Yorktown, Wassuc participated in experimental mine work under the aegis of the Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd). Completing that tour in mid-August, Wassuc moved to the Marine Basin at Brooklyn, New York, for extensive alterations that were not completed until after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had plunged the United States into World War II. Two days after Christmas of 1941, Wassuc departed Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, bound for Yorktown, Virginia, to receive mine warfare instruction duties and further work under the auspices of BuOrd. Wassuc spent the next two years operating in the 5th Naval District, primarily plying the waters of the Chesapeake Bay region and occasionally ranging as far north as the Washington Navy Yard and as far south as Cape Hatteras. She operated principally in BuOrd testing programs at the Naval Mine Warfare Proving Grounds at Solomons Island, Maryland, and at Yorktown, Virginia. She also served two tours of duty as a training ship, providing instruction for officers in the compensation of magnetic compasses. Although her duties appear to have been largely experimental and test-oriented, records indicate that the ship laid a small minefield off Cape Hatteras on 22 May 1942. By 1944, Wassuc was the only coastal minelayer on the U.S. Navy inventory. The U.S. Army held primary responsibility for defensive coastal minelaying, and submarines and aircraft were proving superbly capable of carrying mine warfare to enemy shores. Nevertheless, Wassuc continued her undramatic but vital experimental and test work, far from the limelight of the far-flung battlefronts. She continued her coastwise routine, ranging from Provincetown, Massachusetts, and Cape May, New Jersey, to New York and Norfolk, Virginia, as well as Solomons Island, through the end of World War II.  Decommissioning  Decommissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 8 November 1945 and struck from the Navy list on 28 November 1945, the U.S. Navy's last coastal minelayer was sold to the Patapsco Scrap Corp. on 3 August 1948 for scrapping.

Akari Ichijou is a 14-year-old girl in The Last Blade. Born and raised in Tokyo, she was constantly battling diseases on her own until she finally understood her true calling: teleportation. When her older sister Hikari succumbed to disease, Akari became very agitated. At that time, their father called for her. She restlessly sat before her grim-faced father, who was about to give her a lecture about Hell‚Äôs Gate. Akari found out that Hell‚Äôs Gate was causing trouble again, and flew out of the room, bent on finding the perfect cure for her sister‚Äôs disease on her own: sealing Hell‚Äôs Gate. Her father accused her of not listening to what he said, but she was already gone. Akari has had the most appearances as a playable character out of all of the cast in the Last Blade games, appearing in NeoGeo Battle Coliseum, SNK Gals' Fighters and SNK vs. Capcom for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. Musashi Akatsuki is a legendary swordsman who once traveled the countryside, honing his skills and challenging worthy opponents along the way. During one of his battles he was killed by another swordsman. When Shinnosuke Kagami begins his plan to open Hell's Gate and bring about a new world order, he resurrects Musashi to further his plans and kill innocent people. To both their chagrins, while on one of his travels, Musashi was defeated. Honorable just like he was during his life, he bids farewell to his opponent, before dissolving in a beam of light. Although a playable character in the first game (unlocked via a code), he is not allowed in matches. He has a crouching animation (which is uncommon for some bosses in SNK fighters). He is also selectable in the Dreamcast port of The Last Blade 2. His character is based on the historical Miyamoto Musashi. Genbu no Okina is a guardian of the demonic portal known as ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gate‚Äù. For years, he and the other three guardians stood watch over its seal. For many years it was peaceful and Okina resigned himself to fishing and the complacent life of a hermit. Five years into his life of leisure, he was found by Kaede, who wished to train with him to improve his own sword skills. Okina taught the young man all he knew and Kaede left after he had improved his skills. Sensing the boy‚Äôs departure and inquiry for training as a sign of trouble, Okina followed him at a distance. Despite Kaede preventing the opening of the Gate, it had still not been sealed properly. As the oldest guardian, Okina was aware of that and knew that to properly seal the portal, the legendary ‚ÄúSealing Maiden‚Äù was required to perform the ritual. He also discovered that an assassin called the ‚ÄúMessenger From Afar‚Äù was rumored to pursue the maiden. Determined to fulfill his role as a guardian, Okina set out on a journey. Hibiki Takane is the 17-year-old daughter of , a renowned swordsmith known throughout Japan during the Bakumatsu era. He had retired to an isolated area in the countryside with his daughter but continued his work with various swordsmen around the country. One fateful day, Setsuna approaches Genz≈ç and requests that he forge a new sword. Though the man radiated an aura of pure, unfathomable evil, the master swordsmith finds himself unable to refuse the request. He spends a time of almost 3 months forging this sword, which he dubs the , detailing the amount of time he invested in the weapon. The labor renders him ill, however, and he is soon permanently bedridden. He tells his daughter that the silver-haired man was the reason for his condition, and that she should pursue him and the sword that he had forged. With a concerned Hibiki by his side, he utters his last words: ‚ÄúThe thing that I saw... that I felt, even you must understand.‚Äù Though she was confused by her father‚Äôs cryptic request, Hibiki gathers her belongings and leaves in search of the silver-haired man. Several days later, a man named Hyo Amano stops by, hoping that Genz≈ç would repair his weapon, the ‚ÄúOtokomae‚Äù, when he learns of the swordsmith's death, he sets out to find his daughter. Hibiki has 2 endings in the game; one of them involve her deciding to improve her swordsmanship which can be gained if the player defeats the opponents they face in Arcade mode with her super moves in every round. She is a playable character in Capcom vs. SNK 2, with her Speed Mode 'Custom Combos' from Last Blade 2 given to her as super moves. In addition she has some different animations to her supers in Capcom vs. SNK 2. Hyo Amano is characterized by his outlandish mannerisms and flamboyant personality. He uses the element of fire in some of his attacks as well as special techniques involving sakura petals. His role in The Last Blade is somewhat ambiguous. As a carefree and fun-loving individual, Hyo has a strong love for sake, women, and the thrill of the fight. When he discovers the petals of the beautiful cherry trees falling from their branches, he panics and decides he must go defeat opponents to solve the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù. In the end, he discovers it was only the changing of the seasons that resulted in the petals falling from the trees. After learning of the cause for the various Sakura trees petals falling, Hyo is devastated to learn that the sky is turning a dreadful gray color due to the re-opening of ‚ÄúHell's Gate‚Äù. He draws his sword, but finds it oddly dull and fragile. In order to fix it, he decides to ask his friend Takane Genz≈ç, a master swordsmith, to fix it. However, his friend has died. Amano discovers that he had a daughter (Hibiki Takane) who had recently departed the household. Concerned for his sword and for Hibiki, he sets off to locate her. Hyo's ending in both games is interesting in that the player must choose one of two (or three in the first game) choices, each of which causes Hyo to behave differently. Juzoh Kanzaki is characterized as a power-type character in gameplay. He is the adopted brother of Akari Ichijou (he was orphaned earlier in his childhood). Despite this, he and his adoptive family are very close. At home, he is generally free-spirited and somewhat lazy. Sometime during this, he learned how to use a club with his brute strength (apparently to pass the time). While in the course of his usual lying around the house with little to keep him preoccupied, he was knocked out and kidnapped by Akari, who ‚Äúpersuaded‚Äù him to accompany her on a journey to discover the landmark known as the ‚ÄúGate of Hell‚Äù. After their adventure, their sister Hikari falls ill and the two become extremely concerned about her health. One day as Juzoh is visiting Hikari, she discloses that their sister Akari had run away to ‚ÄúHell's Gate‚Äù again to find a cure for her curse. To lay both their fears to rest, Juzoh pursues her on her quest. Juzo's move list underwent a drastic change in Last Blade 2 where some of his moves from the first game were either removed or revamped. Kaede is considered the main protagonist of the series. His name means ‚Äúmaple‚Äù in Japanese, and the series features many maple decorations as his motif, including a golden stylized maple leaf on the back of his vest. He was the son of a warrior named Gaisei. Gaisei was a master swordsman who trained him with two other orphans, Moriya Minakata and Yuki. As he grew, he became an avid swordsman and powerful warrior. One day, when he was twelve, he and Yuki returned from an errand to discover their master slain and Moriya standing over his corpse. Enraged, Kaede physically attacked him for the (presumed) killing of their master. Moriya withstood the attack and left in silence. Shortly thereafter, Kaede and Yuki depart their foster home to avenge the death of their master and confront the killer. Five years on their quest, he still searches for Moriya. He eventually discovers that the real killer of his master was one of the four guardians of hell, Shinnosuke Kagami. He engages him, but the guardian's superior skill quickly overpowers him. However, it is revealed that Kaede possesses the power of the legendary dragon Seiry≈´, transforming various physical aspects and giving him additional power. With his transformation into , he defeats Kagami. After honing his skills and learning to control the power of the Seiry≈´ to a greater extent, Kaede and Yuki set off to the Okina in order to find more information. When they arrive, they discover that the ‚ÄúSealing Rite‚Äù needs to be performed, for a great evil threatens the world. This rite is to be performed by a special maiden, but a warrior named the ‚ÄúMessenger From Afar‚Äù seeks to assassinate her and prevent her from performing it. Kaede sets out to protect the maiden and to allow her to accomplish her mission. Kaede also appears in King of Fighters 2000 as a special striker. In addition, Moriya, Akari & Washizuka are playable characters in NeoGeo Battle Coliseum. For some unknown reason, Garou: Mark of the Wolves character Rock Howard shares a similar trait with Kaede's awakened form: aside from the blond hair, both also have red eyes. Possibly due to this, one of Rock's alternate outfits in The King of Fighters 2006 is that of Kaede's. Keiichiro Washizuka is a unit leader of the fictional Shinsengumi, a police-like group during the Bakumatsu era. He is a firm believer in restoring order to Japan, and in the old ways of Samurai sword fighting. As such, he carries a very serious persona. He is extremely loyal to his Shinsengumi unit, and is a friend of Kojiroh Sanada. He is the only one in the unit who is aware that ‚ÄúKojiroh‚Äù is actually Kojiroh's sister Kaori. Kojiroh Sanada was the captain of the fictional Shinsengumi Unit Zero, which investigated demonic forces in Japan, following the concept of Bushid≈ç. After Kojiroh dies investigating ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gate‚Äù, his sister Kaori disguises herself as him, using his identity in order to investigate the evils within, as well as to restore the faith in the Shinsengumi. She also travels to finish off the former Shinsengumi, Shikyoh. Washizuka is the only known person to know her true identity. Kaori shares similar moves with Washizuka, but does not perform them via the \\"charge\\" mechanism. Kouryu (or rather, in his new form) is the legendary warrior that trained Kaede, Yuki and Moriya Minakata. After Shinnosuke Kagami‚Äôs aborted plan to remove the seal on ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gate‚Äù and bring about a new world order, Gaisei presumably stood up against the guardian in an attempt to stop him. Unfortunately, Shinnosuke is too powerful, and he dies in the battle. He is later discovered by his three students, who all vow to take revenge on his killer. Kaede accomplishes this, activating his power of the Seiry≈´ and defeating Shinnosuke. This also clears Moriya‚Äôs reputation, as he was originally blamed for killing Gaisei. In The Last Blade 2, Gaisei is still deceased. However, an unknown force of evil resurrects him and drives the now- undead warrior insane. Additionally, he manages to combine the legendary powers of Suzaku, Seiryuu, Byakko and Genbu into his being, making him much more powerful than before. The now godlike warrior roams the lands and is called ‚ÄúKouryu‚Äù, the Yellow Dragon. Lee Rekka hails from Qing Dynasty China, where he learned a martial art that allows the user to control fire and involves the use of fans and powerful kicks. One day, he witnessed a ‚Äúred star‚Äù (the opening of ‚ÄúHell's Gate‚Äù). Knowing it to be a sign of great evil, he travels from his homeland of China to stop the evil before it spreads across the world. After the closing of the Gate, he remained in Japan. He continued to study and improve his skills in the martial arts while earning a modest living at a nearby farm. When he senses the re-opening of Hell‚Äôs Gate, he stops his training to investigate once more. His ending in The Last Blade 2 seems to indicate that he took the wrong ship and ended in America instead of returning China. He is based on the historical Chinese martial arts master from Foshan, Wong Fei-hung. Moriya Minakata is a young swordsman in training under a legendary teacher named Gaisei. Under his tutelage, along with Kaede and Yuki, he became great swordsman. For many years, they lived happily together while learning bushid≈ç. One day he discovered his master dead, and the killer was nowhere to be found. Kaede sees him over the body, and seeks to slay him under the belief he slew Gaisei. With this, he sets out on the run. Not only does he wish to avoid this confrontation, but he also seeks the man named Shinnosuke Kagami (who was the real killer) in order clear his name. However, after over five years of searching, Moriya has yet to find Kagami, who is defeated by Kaede instead. After failing to take revenge upon Kagami, Moriya recluses himself to the wilderness to improve his skills and techniques. During this time, he finds within himself an urge to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù to the portal known as ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gate‚Äù. Ceasing his training, he travels in order to seek the truth. Setsuna is a powerful spirit that was released after Kagami was defeated by Kaede. Finding a deceased baby on a field of battle, he possesses it. After maturing his human form into an adult, he walks the path of destruction, killing and filled with hate for the human race. He uses a black katana-like blade, which leaves a trail of dark energy in its wake. He is directly responsible for the death of Hibiki's father, forcing him by sheer charisma to forge his sword and work on it to the utter limit. Shigen Naoe is a guardian of a portal called the ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gate‚Äù. Before the events of the first game, he is magically sealed in a massive stone for ten years by a friend who perceived him to be a threat. He eventually escaped, but clouded by his rage and anger, he could only think of getting back at his captor. He set out to exact revenge. By the events of The Last Blade 2, Shigen had regained his senses and remembered that he had a daughter. To atone for his ten-year absence, he traveled to the mountains to spend time with her while training. During this timeframe, he noticed the evil aura that emanated from the opened ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gate‚Äù. As one of its guardians, he set out to close it, leaving his sleeping daughter in the darkness of night. However, he was initially unaware that his daughter knew of his departure and that she was following him at a distance. There is a code that the player can enter at the character select screen so that when playing as Shigen, his daughter will appear instead of him as his intro before a match. Shigen, along with Yuki, Gaisei & Zantetsu are the only known characters to die after the events of Last Blade 2. Shikyoh is a previous member of the Shinsengumi, an organization that was to protect the weak. However, Shikyoh merely joined to kill innocents. When his superiors and comrades discovered this, they resolved to punish him, but he escaped before they could take action. When he discovered the opening of the ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gate‚Äù, he thought it a perfect opportunity to continue his killing spree and set out in search of more prey. After his death, Shikyoh was re-animated in the form of a zombie named . With his love of killing still fresh in his mind along with his few memories and fighting style, Mukuro wanders the land in his undead form, continuing to kill innocents. Shinnosuke Kagami is featured as a boss character in The Last Blade and was toned down to be regular playable character in the sequel. Shinnosuke is one of the guardians of ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gate‚Äù, a portal that allows demons and evil energy to seep through to the mortal plane humans call Earth. After residing over his position and finding (or so he thought) that the humans he protected were weak and inferior to himself, he decides to release the seal on the portal. Along with this, he goes on a horrific killing spree, murdering various warriors including Gaisei. After five years of preparatory action to unseal the gate, including imprisoning his fellow guardian, Shigen Naoe, Shinnosuke is eventually found by Kaede, who has the latent power of the Seiry≈´. Kaede defeats him; humiliated by his defeat, Shinnosuke is thrown into the depths of Hell‚Äôs Gate as eternal punishment. However, he is soon reincarnated in a new form to fulfill his role as a guardian, as the portal is being opened by another force. Shinnosuke sets out to fulfill his destiny, and to seek atonement. Yuki is the daughter of a foreign family that managed ship trades; unfortunately, her family died in a ship accident. She is later adopted by a warrior named Gaisei, who trains her along with two other students: Moriya Minakata and Kaede. Unlike her fellow companions, she picks up the naginata instead of the katana. She also secretly harbors feelings for Moriya over the course of her training. The year she turns 13, she returns with Kaede to find their teacher dead and Moriya standing over the body. Mortified, she watched as Kaede attacked Moriya. Moriya silently took his leave shortly thereafter. She and Kaede then embarked on a five-year journey, eventually discovering the truth: a powerful swordsman named Shinnosuke Kagami was the one who had murdered their master. She assists Kaede in defeating Kagami, both avenging their master‚Äôs death and clearing Moriya‚Äôs name. In The Last Blade 2, Yuki and Kaede discover that she is the maiden that is to perform the sealing of evil, as evidenced by her necklace and its recent glowing. After this, she and Kaede part ways and she is left to make her decision about her destiny, which she eventually took part of, and sacrifices her life in the process. Zantetsu is one of the last of numerous ninja clans that roam ancient Japan. Due to the decline of the ninja population, the Japanese common folk begin to consider the title ‚Äúninja‚Äù a thing to scoff at. Determined to prove the superiority of his people, he challenges warriors time and time again to prove his strength. When he hears of the opening of a portal called ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gate‚Äù, he sets out to defeat the enemies within to prove his strength. At the outset of The Last Blade 2, Zantetsu resides in his village, and teaches his grandson the way of the ninja in order to continue their legacy. However, he is aware that he will pass away in the near future and wishes to prove his strength once more before his eventual death. He once again travels to ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gate‚Äù to experience a great battle. It is heavily implied that he is Eiji Kisaragi's ancestor.

If built, the tower would have been tall, making it the tallest building in the United States and 5th tallest in the world. After two major redesigns, the project was cancelled in March 2008. Crown Las Vegas, as originally planned, would have consisted of a casino, a hotel and an observation deck. The tower would have been built on Las Vegas Boulevard on the former site of the Wet 'n Wild Water Park. The building's architect was Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. The cost of the project was estimated to be $5 billion, and its original completion date was set for 2014. History Originally proposed as the \\"Las Vegas Tower\\", the name of the building changed when Publishing and Broadcasting Limited reached an agreement on May 31, 2007, with the tower's developers to invest money in the project and run its casino.Australian magnate to invest in LV casino. Las Vegas Review-Journal. As part of the agreement, the project was renamed Crown Las Vegas. Crown Las Vegas was originally proposed to rise by Christopher Milam, a building developer from Texas. According to KLAS-TV in Las Vegas,I-Team: New Plan Could See Tallest Building in U.S. Built in Las Vegas the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was concerned with the proposed height, due to the tower's proximity to McCarran International Airport and Nellis Air Force Base. In November 2006, the FAA issued a \\"notice of presumed hazard\\" because the tower's location is north of McCarran Airport's runways. The FAA stated that anything over on the site chosen for the tower would constitute an air hazard. On October 24, 2007, the FAA denied the project, deeming that the tower was a \\"hazard to aviation\\". As a result of the decision, Clark County code prohibited its construction at the proposed height. There were plans to resubmit the project, with a new height of . However, on November 20, 2007, the FAA reached a final decision that no structure taller than 1,064 feet (324 m) would be approved in the site. Milam then resubmitted the project to the Clark County Planning Commission at the maximum height allowed by the FAA, and the tower was officially approved for construction on December 6, 2007, with a height of 1,064 feet (324 m). There had been some speculation that Milam wanted to submit plans for the construction of a second, twin tower to also rise 1,064 ft (324 m). If constructed, the two Crown Las Vegas towers would have become the tallest twin towers in the Western Hemisphere. However, no official plans were ever released. In March 2008, Crown chairman James Packer announced the project was cancelled and the site put up for sale. Milam's two- year option expired in June 2008. Milam and his partners paid $67.1 million in nonrefundable deposits and fees to Archon between June 2006 and June 2008. In December 2008, Milam resubmitted another bid for the site which had now risen to $618 million, compared to $475 million for the last agreement. The arrangement called for him to submit a non-refundable $60 million deposit. He had a little over two years to complete the purchase and did not do so.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1965 to 1974 for the Washington Senators and Atlanta Braves. Minor league career Paul Casanova began his professional baseball career on January 1, when he was signed as a free agent by the Cleveland Indians. After playing ten minor league games, he was released by the Indians. Casanova was picked back up by the Indians in December, only to be released again in April 1961. During the 1961 season, he played for the Indianapolis Clowns, a former Negro league team which was now competing as an independent. His third short minor league stint was with the Chicago Cubs, who signed him on September 21, and released him on April 26, after he had played two minor league games. On October 5 of that year, Casanova was signed by the Washington Senators, and his professional baseball career would truly begin the following season. He played 94 games in the minors during the 1963 season. He continued to play in the New York‚ÄìPenn League during the 1964 season and played 120 games, finishing with 19 home runs and a .325 batting average. He spent the 1965 season playing for the Burlington Senators, and was called up to the major league roster in September, starting his major league career. Major league career Casanova began his major league career on September 18, , stepping up to bat twice in a losing effort to the Minnesota Twins ‚Äì the team which had relocated from Washington less than five years earlier, paving the way for the expansion Senators. He played four more games that season. Casanova's first full season came in 1966, when he had career highs of 13 home runs and 5 triples. The 1967 season was Casanova's best, as he earned his only All-Star bid, though he did not play in the game. He played 141 games, had a fielding percentage of .984, and was tied for 21st in the American League's MVP voting. Casanova was also the starting catcher for a night game against the Chicago White Sox on June 12, . He caught the whole night, and although he only got one hit in nine at bats, it came in the bottom of the 22nd inning, driving in the winning run. The game, which went 6 hours and 38 minutes, remains the longest night game in MLB history. The following season was a disappointment, as Casanova played in only 96 games and had a batting average of only .196. Casanova continued to earn fielding percentages of over .985, but after three more seasons of struggling at the plate, he was traded at the end of the 1971 season, as the Senators were becoming the Texas Rangers. Casanova was traded on December 2, to the Atlanta Braves for Hal King. He played for three seasons on the Braves, serving primarily as a backup. He played behind Earl Williams for the 1972 season, then split time with Johnny Oates in 1973. After playing in only 42 games during the 1974 season, Casanova was released on March 28, .

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the Washington Senators and the St. Louis Browns. Early was a left-hand-hitting batter and was known for his skill at catching the knuckleball. Baseball career Born in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, Early began his professional baseball career in at the age of 21 with the Jacksonville Tars of the South Atlantic League. By , he had moved up to the Charlotte Hornetts of the Piedmont League where he posted a .316 batting average in 97 games. Early made his major league debut with the Washington Senators on May 4, 1939 at the age of 24. He served as a reserve catcher, backing up future Baseball Hall of Fame member, Rick Ferrell. Former catcher and Senators coach Benny Bengough helped Early develop his catching skills. The Senators traded Ferrell to the St. Louis Browns in May 1941, leaving Early to share catching duties with Al Evans. Early out-hit Evans and ended the season having caught the majority of the team's games with a career-high batting average of .284 along with 54 runs batted in and a team-high 10 home runs. His hitting performance earned him the starting catcher's job in 1942. Although his batting average dropped to .204, he led American League catchers in assists and in baserunners caught stealing, and finished second in putouts. Early developed a reputation as a talkative player on the field, using several methods to distract the hitter. These methods of distraction included his imitation of a radio announcer's play-by- play commentary, an auctioneer's sales pitch and even singing. By 1943, Early was being recognized as one of the best defensive catchers in baseball. He had the arduous task of catching for a Senators' starting pitching staff that included four knuckleball pitchers. Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Roger Wolff and Mickey Haefner all threw the notoriously difficult to catch knuckleball. Further recognition came when he was selected to be the starting catcher for the American League in the 1943 All-Star Game. The difficulty in catching the knuckleball was evident as Early led the league in passed balls allowed. In December 1943, Early was called into military service and was inducted into the United States Army. He was assigned to an artillery unit attached to the 87th Infantry Division and fought in the Battle of the Bulge. He lost two years of his baseball career while he served in the Army. After being discharged from military service, Early returned to play for the Senators in 1946 but, his two years absence from the game showed as he only managed to post a .201 average while sharing catching duties with Evans. In December, the Senators traded Early to the St. Louis Browns for Frank Mancuso. In 1947, he platooned alongside catcher Les Moss, hitting for a .224 average along with a career-high on-base percentage of .381 in 87 games. Early was traded back to the Senators in March 1948 where, he once again shared catching duties with Evans. He led the league in baserunners caught stealing and in caught stealing percentage, throwing out an impressive 63.8% of baserunners who attempted to steal a base, the eighth highest single-season percentage in baseball history. In 1949, he split his playing time between the minor league Chattanooga Lookouts and the Washington Senators. After being released by the Senators in February , he played five more seasons in minor league baseball, including four seasons with the Minneapolis Millers before retiring in at the age of 39. Career statistics In a nine-year major league career, Early played in 747 games, accumulating 532 hits in 2,208 at bats for a .241 career batting average along with 32 home runs, 264 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .330. He ended his career with a .976 fielding percentage. Early led American League catchers twice in baserunners caught stealing, once in caught stealing percentage and once in assists. His 48.79% career caught stealing percentage ranks 27th all-time among major league catchers. Later life Early went on to become a player-manager in the minor leagues, leading the Rock Hill Chiefs in and then managed the Statesville Owls in . He retired from baseball in and returned to Kings Mountain where he worked as a police officer and recreation director. He retired to Florida in 1970 and died in Melbourne on May 31, , at the age of 70.

It was launched in 2007 in several cities in the United States, and has since expanded to include cities and rural areas worldwide. Streets with Street View imagery available are shown as blue lines on Google Maps. Google Street View displays panoramas of stitched images. Most photography is done by car, but some is done by tricycle, boat, snowmobile, and underwater apparatus, as well as on foot.  History and features  Google Street View car in Germany Street View had its inception in 2001 with the Stanford CityBlock Project, a Google-sponsored Stanford University research project. The project ended in June 2006, and its technology was folded into StreetView. * 2007: Launched on May 25 in the United States using Immersive Media technology. * 2008: In May Google announces that it was testing face-blurring technology on its photos of the busy streets of Manhattan. The technology uses a computer algorithm to search Google's image database for faces and blurs them. Street View was integrated into Google Earth 4.3, the Maps application on the Apple iPhone, and the Maps application for S60 3rd Edition. In November, the drag and drop Pegman icon is introduced as the primary user interface element for connecting from Maps' 2D view into Street View's 3D view. When Pegman is dropped onto a particular set of coordinates in Google Maps for which Street View data is available, Street View opens and takes over the whole map window. * 2009: Introduction of a full-screen option. Smart Navigation was introduced allowing users to navigate around the panoramas by double-clicking with their cursor on any place or object they want to see. * May 2011: Indoor views of businesses (Google Business Photos) were announced. After the pilot phase of several months, the project was rolled out in earnest in autumn. *November 2012: With the release of Android 4.2, Google invites users to contribute panoramas of their own using supported devices. Google highlights user- contributed panoramas with blue circle icons on Maps. The company also created a website to highlight places in the world where one can find them. * 2013: Business interior views are shown as small orange circles. Businesses such as shops, caf√©s and other premises can pay a photographer to take panoramic images of the interior of their premises which are then included in Street View. Google sets up a program to let third parties borrow the Street View Trekker (a backpack-mounted camera) and contribute imagery to Google Maps. * 2014: Street-level imagery from the past can now be seen, if available for a given street view. * 2015: A partnership was announced between Street View and the environmental monitoring company Aclima. Cars began carrying sensors to detect pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulates. In October, support for Google Cardboard was announced, allowing users to utilize Street View in 360-degree virtual reality. * 2017: Imagery inside the International Space Station is added to Street View. * 2017: Starting in August, Google allows users to create their own Street View-like blue paths, for the connected photospheres that are sufficiently close to one another. * 2017: On September 5, Google announced that they are improving the quality of the street view panoramic photo, revamping its mapping vehicles with all-new high-resolution camera systems and artificial intelligence to capture even better imagery. The new Google cars have been seen in various American cities since March 2017, as well as in Japan since August. The first images taken with the new generation of cameras were available online on September 13. * October 2017: The makers of the Insta360 Pro announce the certification of the first \\"Street View auto ready\\" camera for US$3500; it uses six lenses for a 360¬∫ view and comes with Stitcher software. In addition to purchase, the camera rig is also available to qualified entities as part of the Google loaner program, with 50 cameras available to loan, making possible Google Street View imagery coverage of more places that Google might not visit, and to entities for whom a purchase is impractical or impossible. * 2018: Google Japan now offers the street view from a dog's perspective. *August 2018: Street View covers two offshore gas-extraction platforms in the North Sea. Implementation Street View is available as a component of Google Maps, as a web application, and as a mobile application for Android and iOS. Originally, Google Maps used Adobe Flash for Street View. Google overhauled Google Maps in 2013. The newer version uses JavaScript extensively and provides a JavaScript application programming interface. At the time of their release, the new Google Maps and Street View are measured slower than the old version in various setups.The new Street View on Google Maps is very slow (Google Maps Help Forum, 26 February 2014)Tired of new, slow Google Maps? This is how you can switch to the old version! (Geoawesomeness, June 12, 2014) A user can switch to the old version of Google Maps, which is especially useful when Google Maps is more sluggish than usual.Switching Back to the Old Google Maps (Netvantage Marketing, 2 January 2014) The drag-and-drop Pegman icon is the primary user interface element used by Google to connect Maps to Street View. Its name comes from its resemblance to a clothespeg. When not in use, Pegman sits atop the Google Maps zoom controls. Occasionally Pegman \\"dresses up\\" for special events or is joined by peg friends in Google Maps. When dragged into Street View near Area 51, he becomes a flying saucer. When viewing older views, the Pegman in the minimap changes to Doc Brown from Back to the Future.Tan, Alicia Marie (October 22, 2015) Hop into the Google Maps time machine with Doc Brown Mashable, Retrieved June 2016  Coverage  Google announced in May 2017 that it had captured more than of Street View imagery across 83 countries. Maps also include panoramic views taken underwater such as in West Nusa Tenggara underwater coral, in the Grand Canyon, inside museums, and Liwa Desert in United Arab Emirates which are viewed from camelback. In a ten-day trek with Apa Sherpa, Google documented Khumbu, Nepal with its Mount Everest, Sherpa communities, monasteries and schools. Google also added landmarks in Egypt, including the Pyramids of Giza, Cairo Citadel, Saqqara, Monastery of Saint Mina, and the Citadel of Qaitbay in the 9 September 2014 release. Many places still have limited or no coverage, including: * The Caribbean ‚Äì except Barbados, Puerto Rico, partial coverage in the United States Virgin Islands, Dominican Republic and Martinique *Central America ‚Äì except Guatemala and some landmarks in Costa Rica *French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Suriname and Venezuela in South America *Africa ‚Äì except Botswana, Eswatini (Swaziland), Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Nigeria, R√©union, Senegal, South Africa, Tunisia, Uganda and some city views in Madagascar *Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Moldova and much of Germany and Austria in Europe *Asia ‚Äì except Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, much of Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mongolia and Russia * The Middle East ‚Äì except Israel, Jordan, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates * The South Pacific ‚Äì except American Samoa, Australia, Cook Islands (Rarotonga), Fiji (Suva) and (Nadi), French Polynesia (Tahiti), New Zealand, Pitcairn Islands (Pitcairn and Henderson Island) and Kingdom of Tonga (Tongatapu).  Data capturing equipment  Street View camera A Google Street View trike * Cameras: Street View imagery has come from several generations of camera systems from Immersive Media , Point Grey Research (now FLIR Systems) and developed in-house. The cameras contain no mechanical parts, including the shutter, instead using CMOS sensors and an electronic rolling shutter. Widely deployed versions are:  R2: the earliest after Immersive Media, photos were captured with a ring of eight 11-megapixel CCD sensors with commercial photographic wide-angle lenses, cameras with the same specifications as those used for the Google Books project.  Ladybug2 cameras (resolution 1024 x 768 pixels) by Point Grey Research.  R5: uses a ring of eight 5-megapixel CMOS cameras by Elphel with custom low-flare lenses, plus a camera with fisheye lens on top to capture upper levels of buildings.  R7: is the first completely in-house built camera, it uses 15 of the same sensors and lenses as R5, but no fisheye effect.  2017: uses 8 20MP cameras. Includes two facing left and right to read street signs and business names. * Positioning: recorded photographs must be associated with accurate positioning. This is done via a Global Positioning System, wheel speed sensor, and inertial navigation sensor data. * Laser range scanners from Sick AG for the measuring of up to 50 meters 180¬∞ in the front of the vehicle. These are used for recording the actual dimensions of the space being photographed. * LIDAR scanners from Velodyne were added in the 2017 update. Mounted at 45¬∞ to capture 3D depth information, and used for additional positional information. *Air quality: In September 2018, Google announced it would integrate air quality sensors from Aclima into its global fleet of Street View vehicles. A Street View Trekker backpack-mounted camera * Vehicles: data recording equipment is usually mounted on the roof of a car. A Trike (tricycle) was developed to record pedestrian routes including Stonehenge, and other UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2010 a snowmobile-based system captured the 2010 Winter Olympics sites. Trolleys have been used to shoot the insides of museums, and in Venice the narrow roads were photographed with backpack- mounted cameras, and canals were photographed from boats. * A portable backpack-mounted Google Trekker is used in outdoor terrain. For instance, the six main paths up Snowdon were mapped by the Google Trekker in 2015.  Privacy concerns  A Google Street View car showcased on the Google campus in Mountain View, California in October 2010 Google Street View will blur houses for any user who makes a request, in addition to the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates. Privacy advocates have objected to the Google Street View, pointing to views found to show men leaving strip clubs, protesters at an abortion clinic, sunbathers in bikinis, and people engaging in activities visible from public property in which they do not wish to be seen publicly. Another concern is the height of the cameras, and in at least two countries, Japan and Switzerland, Google has had to lower the height of its cameras so as to not peer over fences and hedges. The service also allows users to flag inappropriate or sensitive imagery for Google to review and remove. Police Scotland received an apology for wasting police time in 2014 from a local business owner in Edinburgh who in 2012 had staged a fake murder for the Google camera car by lying in the road \\"while his colleague stood over him with a pickaxe handle\\". In May 2010, it was revealed that Google had collected and stored payload data from unencrypted Wi-Fi connections as part of Street View. The concerns have led to Google not providing or suspending the service in countries around the world. * Austria: Google Street View was banned in Austria, because Google was found to collect Wi-Fi data without authorization in 2010. After the ban was lifted, rules were set up for how Street View can operate legally in Austria. Google resumed collecting imagery in 2017. As of 2018 Google Street View is available in select areas of Austria. * Australia: In 2010, Google Street View ceased operations in Australia, following months of investigations from Australian authorities. However, this cessation has since ended, with Google announcing plans to continue production on May 4, 2011 and subsequently releasing updated Street View imagery for Australian towns and cities on July 27, 2011. * Germany: In 2011, after having put online the pictures of the 20 largest cities, Google stopped taking Street View images in Germany. However, as of mid-2020, Google's website shows numerous areas of Germany as being scheduled for coverage by Street View vehicles over the ensuing months. * India: In 2011, Google stopped taking street images in India, after receiving a letter from police authorities in Bangalore. * Canada: Street View cars were spotted as early as September 2007 in Montreal. However, service for Canada was delayed while they attempted to settle with the Canadian government over its privacy laws. Privacy and town beauty concerns were dealt with and Street View is available in Montreal and other Canadian cities (as of 2016). Third-party use of images Fine-art photographers have selected images for use in their own work. Although the images may be pixelated, the colours muddy, and the perspective warped, the photographs have been published in book form and exhibited in art galleries, such as the work of Jon Rafman at the Saatchi Gallery, London. In his personal appreciation of Street View material, Rafman sees images which evoke the \\"gritty urban life\\" depicted in American street photography and the images commissioned by the Farm Security Administration. He also invokes the \\"decisive moment\\" esthetic of Henri Cartier-Bresson \\"as if I were a photojournalist responding instantaneously to an emerging event\\".Jon Rafman, The Nine Eyes of Google Street View, Introduction, Jean Bo√Æte Editions, 2011. . Michael Wolf won an honourable mention in Daily Life in the 2011 World Press Photo competition for some of his work using Google Street View. Mishka Henner was short-listed for the 2013 Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize in November 2012 for his series 'No Man's Land', which depicts sex workers at rural roadside locations.\\"Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Prize\\" . Accessed 15 March 2013 Swedish programmer Anton Wall√©n developed a game called GeoGuessr, which places players into a Google Street View and has them guess its location. Canadian artist, Sylvia Grace Borda, worked in conjunction with John M. Lynch between 2013-14 to insert the first staged tableaux into the Google Street View engine. Their efforts won them the Lumen Prize in 2016. Borda has continued independently to author in the Google Street View engine and in 2017 created the tableaux series, the Kissing Project.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball between and . He had an eleven-year career for seven different teams in Major League Baseball. He was notable for being the first player in major league history to use contact lenses. Early life Born in Richmond, Virginia, Foiles' family moved to Norfolk, Virginia where he attended Granby High School, played football and baseball, and ran track. In 1946, he was named All-Southern in football and starred in the inaugural Oyster Bowl held in Foreman Field in Norfolk. He attended the College of William & Mary and the University of Virginia. Baseball career In November 1947, Foiles was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent. He spent four years playing in the minor leagues before being selected by the Cincinnati Reds in the 1951 Rule 5 draft. He made his major league debut on April 21, 1953 at the age of 24, starting at catcher for the Redlegs (as the Reds were known from 1953‚Äì58) in a 4‚Äì3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. After playing only five games with Cincinnati, his contract was purchased by the Cleveland Indians on May 13, 1953. He appeared in seven games with the Indians before the team sent him back to the minor leagues. In 1954, Foiles posted a .332 batting average along with 17 home runs and 59 runs batted in while playing for the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association. His performance earned him a promotion back to the major leagues in 1955 where he posted a .261 batting average in 62 games while playing as a backup to the Indians All-Star catcher, Jim Hegan. He also demonstrated his strong throwing arm with a 59% caught stealing percentage, above the 47% league average for catchers. The Indians entered the final week of the 1955 season in first place, but then faltered to lose four of their last five games to finish the season in second place, three games behind the New York Yankees. On May 15, 1956, Foiles was traded by the Cleveland Indians to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Preston Ward. He had his most productive seasons as a player for the Pirates, appearing in over 100 games in 1957 and 1958. He posted career-highs in 1957 with 76 hits, a .270 batting average with 9 home runs and 36 runs batted in. He was recognized as one of the top catchers in the National League when he was selected as a reserve in the 1957 All-Star Game. In the All-Star game, Foiles appeared in the ninth inning as a pinch hitter, hitting a single off Billy Pierce and then scoring a run to help the National League team rally‚Äîonly to fall short in a 6‚Äì5 defeat.Retrosheet box score, 1957 MLB All-Star Game When his hitting performance declined in 1959, Foiles was replaced by Smoky Burgess as Pittsburgh's regular catcher. From 1960 to 1964 Foiles was traded several times, as his defensive skills made him valuable as a backup catcher. In 1960, he appeared in 6 games for the Kansas City Athletics then, was traded back to the Cleveland Indians where he played in 24 games before ending the season as a member of the Detroit Tigers. On November 28, 1960, he was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles from the Tigers in the 1960 Rule 5 draft. After one season with the Orioles, he returned to play for the Cincinnati Reds in 1962. He was signed as a free agent by the Los Angeles Angels and played for two more seasons before playing in his final major league game on September 24, 1964 at the age of 35.

He ended his career with a .986 fielding percentage. In , Foiles led National League catchers with a 50% caught stealing percentage.. Foiles may have been the only major league catcher to have thrown out Jackie Robinson two times in one game. Later life Foiles filed a $7 million class action lawsuit against the Baltimore Orioles for using his likeness in a set of promotional baseball cards. In 1987, Foiles was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.

Shelfari users built virtual bookshelves of the titles they owned or had read, and could rate, review, tag, and discuss their books. Users could also create groups that other members could join, create discussions, and talk about books, or other topics. Recommendations could be sent to friends on the site for what books to read. Shelfari was launched on October 11, 2006. In February 2007, Amazon invested $1 million in Shelfari, and moved to acquire it a year later in August 2008. In January 2016, it was announced that Shelfari was being merged into Goodreads. As of June 2016, the site was decommissioned (all links redirect to Goodreads' website). There were user complaints that not all features were moved. History =Founding and marketing= Shelfari was founded by RealNetworks alumni Josh Hug and Kevin Beukelman (both software developers), and Mark Williamson (who never joined the company full-time) under the name Tastemakers, Inc., along with designer Ian Patterson. Tastemakers sought to create a social networking service that met the needs of avid readers. This strategy may have mirrored a trend during this time period of creating niche social networks such as social movie site Flixster. Shelfari launched in October 2006. It allowed books to be searched by title, author, ISBN, or subject. It was free, unlike LibraryThing, regardless of how many books had been collected in lists. Shelfari also allowed for the creation of user groups by users, which each group given a \\"common shelf\\" where users could contribute titles, with an attached forum for discussion and an introductory page. The website first went live on October 10, 2006. At the time, it planned on earning money by passing leads on to online booksellers and taking a 5 to 10 percent cut of resultant sales. There were plans to allow cataloging for CDs and DVDs. Once Shelfari received its first equity fund raise in early 2007 the company grew to five employees, including software developer Kevin Durdle, designer Timothy Gray, and VP of marketing Dave Hanley. New features were introduced to Shelfari in December 2007, with books in bookshelves given realistic book covers. =Amazon and shutdown= In August 2008, the company was acquired by Amazon.com. After it was acquired, Josh Hug remained CEO of the company. The team was integrated into the book technology group. After the purchase by Amazon, an Amazon account was required in 2012 to log into Shelfari. Shelfari continued to function as an independent book social network within the Amazon.com family of sites until January 2016, when Amazon announced on Shelfari.com that it would be merging Shelfari with Goodreads and closing down Shelfari. To prepare Shelfari members for the move, Amazon posted on Shelfari.com a prominent announcement stating, \\"IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: Shelfari is merging with Goodreads. Learn More\\", as well as links to a page titled \\"Read the FAQ\\", instructions to \\"Download your data in a CSV file\\" (whose linked page is titled \\"Export Everything\\",), and instructions to \\"Move to Goodreads\\" (whose linked page is titled \\"Export Invitation\\"), along with two months to migrate their Shelfari content to Goodreads. Although Shelfari discussion threads will not be migrated (as Amazon would need permission from all conversants in order to do so), users were advised: \\"you may save your own data for your own records\\". Features Shelfari promoted its \\"virtual bookshelf\\" as one of its main features. The virtual bookshelf displayed covers of books which the user has entered, with popups to show the user's book information (review, rating, and tags). Sorting by author, title, date, rating, or review was available to the viewer of the shelf. Users could organize books into different shelves, including already read, currently reading, planning to read, wish list, currently owned, and favorites. The Shelfari catalog could be edited by users, though some changes had to be approved by Shelfari \\"librarians\\". Using wiki functionality users could edit each book's authors, title, publication data, table of contents, first sentence, and series. Users could also combine redundant books into a single entry or add new titles not found in the catalog. Similar to books, author pages could be edited or created. In addition to general catalog maintenance, users were encouraged to contribute reviews, descriptions, lists of characters and settings, author biographies, categories, and descriptive tags. Most books in the Shelfari catalog came from the large Amazon catalog, including Amazon Marketplace listings added by independent resellers. These books linked back to Amazon and displayed pricing and links to AbeBooks for used book sales. Shelfari had a group creator, which allows members to create group threads within which to talk, play, or discuss books.  Criticism  Shelfari received bad press for its \\"Invite Friends\\" page. Jesse Wegman, writing in The New York Observer in October 2007, complained that because he had \\"accidentally failed to uncheck the approximately 1,500 names in my Gmail address book that Shelfari had helpfully pre-checked\\", the system caused invitations to be sent, contrary to his intentions but \\"ostensibly\\" from his own address, to his entire network of contacts. In November 2007, Shelfari was accused of astroturfing by Tim Spalding, the creator of LibraryThing, a competing social networking book site. In a comment on another blog critical of Shelfari (primarily criticizing the \\"invitations\\" system), Josh Hug, the CEO, blamed the astroturfing on an intern not knowing better, and said that it had stopped.

A left-handed pitcher, Grissom played in Major League Baseball from 1934 to 1941 for the Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees, Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. Career Grissom originally played baseball in the local Farm Bureau League when a local scout spotted him and signed him to a professional contract. He pitched for the Mission Reds in the Pacific Coast League in 1933, where he was then discovered by Charles E. Chapman, a college scouter for the Reds, and was signed before the 1934 season to a contract by Cincinnati general manager Larry MacPhail to play for the Reds. Born in Sherman, Texas, Grissom made his debut with the Reds on September 2, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He pitched four games in 1934, and in 1935 he started three games, winning and losing one each. During the 1935 season, he was recognized by The Sporting News as a \\"Minor Worth Watching\\". He continued to move between the majors and minors during these two seasons and in 1936. He played six games, starting four and pitching nearly 25 innings. In 1937 Grissom had his best season, and became a regular on the pitching staff. Before the season started, however, he became well known as a result of a flood. In late January, Cincinnati had the worst flood in its history, with Crosley Field being covered by as much as 21 feet of water. Grissom and Gene Schott rowed a boat out from the center field wall, and the resulting photo appeared across the country. During the season, he was selected to the All-Star Game in his only appearance, pitching an inning for the National League. He pitched in the bottom of the fifth inning, striking out Lou Gehrig and Earl Averill, yet surrendered doubles to Joe Cronin and Bill Dickey, with Cronin scoring a run on Dickey's hit, before ending the inning by making Sam West fly out. He finished the 1937 Cincinnati Reds season with a record of 12-17, an earned run average of 3.26 and 149 strikeouts, and finished tied for 19th in the NL's MVP voting. During the 1938 season, Grissom pitched 51 innings in 14 games. A blurb in the \\"Odds 'n Ends\\" section on the inside back cover of Action Comics #1, from 1938, mentions that Grissom is anxious to pitch both games of a doubleheader one day. However, his season ended abruptly when he broke his ankle trying to steal a base. In 1939, his final season as a Red, Grissom finished the season for the pennant-winning Reds with a 9-7 record, a 4.10 ERA, and over 150 innings pitched. He also pitched 1‚Öì innings during the 1939 World Series loss to the New York Yankees. After the 1939 season, he was traded to the Yankees for Joe Beggs, but went on to play only five games for New York. On May 15, , Grissom was selected off waivers by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He started 10 games for them and finished the season with an ERA of 2.81. In 1941, Grissom played four games before he was traded by the Dodgers to the Philadelphia Phillies for Vito Tamulis. He played in 29 games for Philadelphia, and while he had an ERA of 2.97, he only earned a 2-13 record. Later life After playing his last game on September 24, , Grissom joined the military on June 6, 1942, and was originally assigned to the infantry and later to the United States Army Air Forces. He pitched for a base team under Burgess Whitehead and played for a semi-pro team in Colorado before being discharged in September 1945. He went on to work at his family's farm and pitch for local teams. In 1952 he was tried and acquitted of manslaughter for the death of a man during a barfight in which he participated. He died in Corning, California at age 90. Personal His brother, Marv Grissom, was also a professional baseball player.

They are generally considered a subfamily of the geometer moth family (Geometridae) and are divided into a few large or good-sized tribes, and numerous very small or even monotypic ones which might not always be valid. Well-known members are the \\"pug moths\\" of the Eupitheciini and the \\"carpets\\", mainly of the Cidariini and Xanthorhoini. The subfamily was described by Philog√®ne Auguste Joseph Duponchel in 1845.  Systematics and description  Morphological and DNA sequence data indicate that they are a very ancient lineage of geometer moths; they might even be distinct enough to warrant elevation to full family status in the superfamily Geometroidea. They share numerous plesiomorphic traits - for example at least one areola in the forewing, a hammer-shaped ansa of the tympanal organ and the lack of a gnathos - with the Sterrhinae which are either somewhat less distant from other geometer moths or are part of the same distinct lineage; the Lythriini were until recently placed in the Larentiinae but are apparently Sterrhinae.√ïunap et al. (2008), Young (2008) But the Larentiinae characteristically tend to have much longer foreleg tarsi and hindleg tibiae than their relatives, and also have hairy or toothed extensions on the upperside sections of the transtilla; their caterpillars often have the abdominal prolegs reduced already (as is typical for the more advanced geometer moths), and the Larentiinae's tympanal organs have a unique and characteristic structure.

Professional career =Texas Rangers (1974‚Äì1977)= Howell was selected in the first round, fourth overall by the Texas Rangers in the 1972 MLB Draft. He made his major-league debut with the Rangers during the first game of a doubleheader against the California Angels on September 9, 1974. Howell earned his first career hit in the game, a single against the Angels Chuck Dobson in a 3-1 loss. In the second game of the doubleheader, Howell hit his first career home run against Ed Figueroa, as the Rangers defeated California 5-3. Howell appeared in 13 games with the Rangers, hitting .250 with 1 home run and 3 RBI. Howell became the Rangers starting third baseman in 1975, as in 125 games, he hit .251 with 10 home runs and 51 RBI. In 1976, Howell played in 140 games, batting .253 with 8 home runs and 53 RBI, while recording a league high 28 errors at third base. In 1977, Howell lost his starting job to Toby Harrah, and in 17 at-bats with the Rangers over seven games, Howell did not record a hit. On May 9, the Rangers traded Howell to the Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Hargan, Jim Mason, and $200,000. =Toronto Blue Jays (1977‚Äì1980)= Howell became the everyday third baseman for the Toronto Blue Jays to finish the 1977 season, and in 96 games with Toronto, he hit .316 with 10 home runs and 44 RBI. On September 10, 1977, Howell hit 2 home runs, 2 doubles, a single, and collected 9 RBI in a 19-3 win against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Howell's franchise record remained unequalled until August 29, 2015, when Edwin Encarnaci√≥n tied his mark in a 15‚Äì1 win over the Detroit Tigers. In 1978, Howell was selected as a reserve player for the 1978 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In the fourth inning of the game, Howell entered as a pinch hitter against Steve Rogers of the Montreal Expos, but grounded out to first base to end the inning. He played in 140 games for the Blue Jays that season, hitting .270 with 8 home runs and 61 RBI. Howell saw his power numbers increase during the 1979 season, as in 138 games, Howell hit 15 home runs and 72 RBI, both the second highest totals on the team, along with a .247 batting average. In 1980, Howell played in a career high 142 games, hitting .269 with 10 home runs and 57 RBI. On October 23, Howell became a free agent. =Milwaukee Brewers (1981‚Äì1984)= On December 20, 1980, Howell signed as a free agent with the Milwaukee Brewers. He suffered through an injury plagued 1981 season, as Howell appeared in 76 games, batting .238 with 6 home runs and 33 RBI, helping the Brewers reach the playoffs. In the 1981 ALDS against the New York Yankees, Howell played in four games, batting .400 in five at-bats, but Milwaukee lost the series. In 1982, the Brewers used Howell mostly as a designated hitter, and in 98 games, Howell hit .260 with 4 home runs and 38 RBI, helping the team reach the playoffs for the second straight season. In the 1982 ALCS, Howell played in one game, going 0 for 3, as the Brewers defeated the California Angels. In the 1982 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Howell played in four games, going 0 for 11, as Milwaukee lost the series. Howell played in 69 games with the Brewers in 1983, hitting .278 with 4 home runs and 25 RBI. Howell continued to see limited playing time in 1984, as in 68 games, he hit .232 with 4 home runs and 17 RBI. On October 1, the Brewers released Howell. He signed with the San Francisco Giants before the 1985 season, however he would be released by the Giants during spring training. He spent the 1985 season with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League, the Philadelphia Phillies Triple-A affiliate. After the season, Howell retired from baseball. =Career Statistics= In 1112 games over 11 seasons, Howell compiled a .261 batting average (991-for-3791) with 422 runs, 183 doubles, 31 triples, 80 home runs, 454 RBI, 318 walks, 675 strikeouts, .321 on-base percentage and .389 slugging percentage.

The League promoted the closer union of the British Empire and advocated the establishment of \\"representative government\\" for the UK, Canada and the self-governing colonies of 'Australasia' (Australia and New Zealand) and Cape Colony (the future Union of South Africa) within a single state. Formation It was founded in London in 1884, as an initiative of W. E. Forster who would be its first Chairman. Branches were established in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Barbados and British Guiana. After his death Lord Rosebery became President of the League; he was in turn succeeded by Edward Stanhope. Francis Labilliere, William Westgarth and John Dennistoun Wood served on a committee of six to draft the prospectus of the Imperial Federation League. It aimed to promote the Imperial Federation, to be formed in a similar way to the confederation of a majority of British North America into the Dominion of Canada in the mid-19th century. The United States and Canada were concrete examples of how vast territories could be effectively managed while maintaining a central representative authority. The League was cross-party and sought to avoid party politics. The Imperial Federation League combined politicians, journalists, and intellectuals, like Sir John Robert Seeley, James Bryce, Alfred Milner, Froude and Lord Tennyson. =Ontario/Canada= Whilst branches of the Imperial Federation League spread throughout the Empire, a large branch formed in Toronto in 1887. It was spurred on by a United States initiative for a commercial union between the US and Canada.Parkin Dalton McCarthy MP was a founder of the IFL. A Conservative MP initially, he ran a slate of McCarthyite candidates in the 1896 federal election on an anti-Catholic platform but was the only one elected. Prominent Canadian members included Sir Charles Tupper, and both G.T. Denison and his brother Frederick Charles Denison. George Robert Parkin would extensively tour the empire speaking on behalf of the cause. The annexation crises of the late 1880s and early 1890s was a particular concern of the League. =Victoria/Australia= A branch of the League was established in Victoria in 1885. Alfred Deakin was a supporter of the League and in 1905 became the President of the Victorian branch.Papers of Alfred Deakin Partly through the efforts of Henry D'Esterre Taylor the Victorian branch survived the dissolution of the London branch. The Victorian Branch was a supporter of the notion that Imperial Federation could be encouraged best by not enunciating a clear plan. > \\"Most of the supporters of Imperial Federation have hitherto indulged in > very vague generalities. The Victorian branch of the league weds itself to > no scheme, and will have nothing to do with ways and means to effect its > object. ‚Ä¶ This promised land seems just a little indefinite.\\"Morris, p.4 Many in the Victorian branch regarded the Federation of Australia as the first step towards Imperial Federation.Morris p.10 Programme Supporters of Imperial Federation presented the argument that the two choices for Britain were federation or disintegration. In their view, the future importance of Britain depended on it federating what is now called the \\"Old Commonwealth\\".Morris p. 10 The League promoted the closer union of the British Empire under an \\"Imperial Federal Government\\" however it did not settle on any particular scheme of what this would comprise, whether a Federal Parliament, a Council, or Conferences, other than that it would include representation from the parts of the empire to consider matters of foreign policy, defence, and trade. It was generally taken to mean some sort of Imperial Parliament. The Imperial Parliament (Westminster, stripped of its local responsibilities) would handle foreign affairs, the army, the navy, and those colonies (including India) which had a population the bulk of which was \\"alien\\". The center would also have a final court of appeal. Local Parliaments would exercise control over Home Affairs, the police and education.Morris p. 17ff The League was Unionist in outlook. The League was divided between those who wanted to establish a clear pathway for Imperial Federation and those whose view was that the program could best be advanced by general discussion, aiming to move opinion in favor of federation with specifics to be worked out later (Parkin, in Canada, argued that that was the method used to bring about Canadian Confederation).Review of Parkin Another point of division within the League was the question of free trade or tariff protection. The League while refraining from adopting a view point did not prevent advocates from either side commenting on the matter. A prominent activist in the League was the protectionist Howard Vincent MP. A \\"want of homogeneity\\" in the League and recognition that it was composed of \\"three or four sections\\" would be given as the reason for the eventual dissolution of the League in 1893 Imperial Federation, Volume 8, No 96, December 1893 The League's most notable opponents were Edward Augustus Freeman, Goldwin Smith, and Andrew Carnegie. In his Triumphant Democracy Carnegie would refer to the League as Rosebery's \\"amusing Imperial Federation fad (which, happily, is impossible)\\"Carnegie, Andrew, Triumphant Democracy (1886) p112 Successes and Failures The League brought the issue of imperial federation to the attention of the public throughout the empire. It had a concrete accomplishment in the calling of the First Colonial Conference in 1887 at the time of Queen Victoria's golden jubilee. The League sent deputations to two successive Prime Minister, Salisbury and Gladstone. While Salisbury agreed to the calling of the Colonial Conference he would later dismiss federation as nothing more than \\"a word spelt with ten letters\\". Gladstone, as a Little Englander, was predicatably unresponsive and he \\"dismissed summarily the plan submitted for consideration by the IFL in April 1893\\"Bell, Duncan The Idea of Greater Britain Princeton University Press (2007) p16 Post-Dissolution The League was effectively revived by some members in 1894 as the British Empire LeagueBrown, Benjamin H., The Tariff Reform Movement in Great Britain 1881-1895 (1943) p120. Milner would go on to unite South Africa and form the Round Table movement.

This field of research combines text analytics and Semantic Web technologies like RDF. Semantic analytics measures the relatedness of different ontological concepts. Some academic research groups that have active project in this area include Kno.e.sis Center at Wright State University among others. History An important milestone in the beginning of semantic analytics occurred in 1996, although the historical progression of these algorithms is largely subjective. In his seminal study publication, Philip Resnik established that computers have the capacity to emulate human judgement. Spanning the publications of multiple journals, improvements to the accuracy of general semantic analytic computations all claimed to revolutionize the field. However, the lack of a standard terminology throughout the late 1990s was the cause of much miscommunication. This prompted Budanitsky & Hirst to standardize the subject in 2006 with a summary that also set a framework for modern spelling and grammar analysis.Budanitsky, Alexander, and Graeme Hirst. \\"Evaluating WordNet-Based Measures of Lexical Semantic Relatedness.\\" Comput. Linguist. 32, no. 1 (March 2006): 13‚Äì47. In the early days of semantic analytics, obtaining a large enough reliable knowledge bases was difficult. In 2006, Strube & Ponzetto demonstrated that Wikipedia could be used in semantic analytic calculations.Strube, Michael, and Simone Paolo Ponzetto. \\"WikiRelate! Computing Semantic Relatedness Using Wikipedia. In Proceedings of the 21st National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Volume 2, 1419‚Äì1424. AAAI'06. Boston, Massachusetts: AAAI Press, 2006. The usage of a large knowledge base like Wikipedia allows for an increase in both the accuracy and applicability of semantic analytics. Methods Given the subjective nature of the field, different methods used in semantic analytics depend on the domain of application. No singular methods is considered correct, however one of the most generally effective and applicable method is explicit semantic analysis (ESA).Z. Zhang, A. L. Gentile, and F. Ciravegna, \\"Recent advances in methods of lexical semantic relatedness ‚Äì a survey\\", Natural Language Engineering, vol. 19, no. 04, pp. 411‚Äì479, Oct. 2013.

The fragments are sorted by how related they are to the surrounding text. Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is another common method that does not use ontologies, only considering the text in the input space. Applications * Entity linking * Ontology building / knowledge base population * Search and query tasks * Natural language processing  Spoken dialog systems (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana) * Artificial intelligence * Knowledge management The application of semantic analysis methods generally streamlines organizational processes of any knowledge management system.

Galvez who pitched part of one season for the Los Angeles Dodgers and numerous minor league affiliates then traveled to East Asia for five seasons for the Yomiuri Giants in the Nippon Professional Baseball League of Japanese baseball. He also played briefly for teams in South Korea and Taiwan. Professional career G√°lvez was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League in , and made his Major League (MLB) debut in with the Dodgers. He played in 10 major league games that year, but was demoted to the minors at the start of the 1987 season and never appeared in another MLB game. Over the next several years, Galvez also suited up for minor league affiliates teams of the Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins, New York Yankees of the American League, along with National League teams Montreal Expos and the Chicago Cubs in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1994, Galvez signed with the Brother Elephants of the national capital of Taipei in the Chinese Professional Baseball League on the island nation of Taiwan (with the Nationalist government of the Republic of China since 1949 after the Chinese Civil War). In two full seasons with the Elephants, he had a 26‚Äì16 record with an ERA of 2.53 and 203 strikeouts in 370 innings pitched. He traveled to Japan in where baseball had a fevered fan base of followers since the early 20th century shared with the Americans who introduced the sport. Galvez was signed during spring training by the Yomiuri Giants, the most famous Japanese baseball team in the Nippon Professional Baseball League. He ended up with 16 wins, tying teammate Masaki Saito for the most wins in the Central League of the NPBL. The Giants won the Central League pennant that year, playing in the Japan Series of the championship tournament. G√°lvez displayed a distinct pitching form in Japan, often releasing the ball while sticking out his tongue. He had a mid-90 mph fastball and surprisingly good control. However, he was not comfortable when there were runners on base, and had trouble pitching from the set position. He also showed frequent dissatisfaction with ball and strike calls; a trait which would lead him into clashes with opposing teams and umpires. On July 31, , the Giants played against the Hanshin Tigers at Koshien Stadium, and G√°lvez faced Tomochika Tsuboi, a heavy hitter in the bottom of the 6th inning. Galvez had a borderline pitch called a ball by the umpire, Atsushi Kittaka, and he subsequently lost his composure, giving up a home run to Tsuboi on the next pitch. Giants manager Shigeo Nagashima emerged from the dugout to change pitchers, but G√°lvez refused to leave the mound, instead shouting insults at Kittaka. G√°lvez allowed his teammates to drag him back towards the dugout, but then he turned back to throw the baseball at Kittaka (the ball narrowly missed him). The game was a huge mess afterwards, with both teams involved in arguments and physical confrontations. The next game between the Tigers and Giants also erupted into a brawl, and both teams were warned for throwing dangerous pitches during the August 2nd contest. Galvez was given a season-ending suspension for throwing at the umpire. The Giants could have released G√°lvez for causing such an incident, but they chose to re-sign him for because the team's main starters, (Masaki Saito, Hiromi Makihara and Masumi Kuwata) were showing signs of aging. G√°lvez actually ended up being the team's Opening Day starter, becoming the first non-Japanese player to pitch Opening Day for the Giants. He pitched decently throughout the season, but was given very little run support, resulting in a 9‚Äì12 record in 1999. He still figured as an important part of the Giants' starting rotation, though, and was kept for the following season. G√°lvez had stiff competition in 2000 for his spot on the top team roster during spring training, as the Giants had signed three other non-Japanese pitchers during the offseason. He earned his slot in the starting rotation, but lost all 6 of the games he started in , despite giving up 3 runs or less each start. This made 10 consecutive losses, counting his four losses at the end of the previous year. He was demoted to the Giants' farm team in the Japanese minors after his sixth loss and was released by the club at the end of the season. Although his temperamental ways, particularly the 1998 incident, tarnished his reputation in Japan, he still compiled a 46-43 record in his five seasons there. He was signed by the Samsung Lions (Korea Baseball Organization) in Samsung, South Korea in , and picked up a win in his first start. However, it was discovered that he had traveled to Korea without a working visa, and he was sued by the opposing team (Hanwha Eagles). However, after the visa situation was resolved, Galvez was a standout pitcher for the Samsung team, compiling a 10-4 record. Before going to Korea to play with Samsung in 2001, Galvez had signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League back in the U.S.A. and pitched well enough in spring training to be in contention for the team's #5 starting pitcher spot. But a dispute with the Pirates' pitching coach on April 1 led to another temperamental outburst from Galvez and he quit the team.

Built as W. M. Irish the ship was a commercial tanker until taken by the War Shipping Administration (WSA) during World War II. WSA first allocated the ship to the Army and then as lend lease to the Soviet Union where the ship was renamed Moskva. On return the ship was renamed Nausett and allocated to the Navy which first accepted the vessel and then found it too expensive to make suitable. The ship was returned to WSA, placed in reserve and sold for scrap the next year. Pre-Navy history The ship was built as W. M. Irish, completed in April 1918, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., Alameda, California. The tanker, assigned official number 216249, was operated by the Atlantic Refining Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania until acquired 20 January 1942 by the War Shipping Administration (WSA) at New Haven, Connecticut and allocated to the Army the same day for operation under a Transportation Corps agreement. On 23 May 1943 at Loa Angeles the ship was conveyed to the Soviet Union under lend lease which operated the vessel as Moskva until the ship was returned and placed under a WSA general agreement with Deconhil Shipping Company.  Acquired by the U.S. Navy  Renamed Nausett on 29 October 1944, she was accepted by the Navy on a bareboat charter and commissioned at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1945. On further inspection, necessary alterations were deemed too expensive to warrant the expenditure. In June, Nausett was placed in reduced commission pending her return to WSA on the West Coast. On 23 September 1945, she arrived at San Francisco, California, where she decommissioned and was delivered to WSA, on 12 October 1945. Twelve days later she was struck from the Navy Register. Fate The ship was placed in the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet on 12 October 1945 with a note that the ship had a breakdown on the way and had to be towed to the mooring. The vessel was purchased for scrap by American Iron & Metal Company on 27 November 1946 for $7,217.

The hill is located east of Fulda, near the villages of Kleinsassen and Danzwiesen. It is a popular destination for hikers and bikers. Scientifically, Milseburg is most notable for the remains of a large Celtic oppidum. It also features several other structures on the peak, including a chapel dedicated to St Gangulphus. Geography The Milseburg is located in the municipality of Hofbieber, east of Fulda in the Rh√∂n hills of Hesse, Germany. It is made up of volcanic basalt. The headwaters of the creek Bieber, a contributor to the Haune are located immediately to the south of the Milseburg. It flows around Milseburg to the west. Milseburg is the highest elevation in the Western K√ºppenrh√∂n and the second highest in the Hessian part of the hill range. It rises around over the surrounding landscape. It has quite steep slopes on all sides except to the northwest, which offers the only easy access to the top. A nature reserve of around 26 hectares (created in the 1970s) covers most of the hill. Oppidum The Milseburg is most notable, aside from being a landmark, for having been the site of an important Celtic oppidum. It was likely occupied from around 1200 to 800 BC and again from 450 BC to around the turn of the eras. The Ringwall (circular rampart) was one of the largest and most elevated in eastern Hesse. It originally had three gates, only one of which ‚Äî the Tor am K√§lberhutstein ‚Äî was passable by wagons. The main fortification was a long stone wall that surrounded the north, east and south sides of the hill at its base. It was discovered as ancient in origin by R. Virchow (1821-1902). However, for a long time it was locally thought to be a modern field border. As a result, when the nearby railway line was built in 1896 most of the wall to the north and northeast was removed and used to make gravel. The wall begins at the scree slope of the K√§lberhutstein to the north, slopes in an arch to the southeast and encompasses the whole eastern side of the hill at a distance of to from its base. The three gates were located to the northeast, east and south. Ch. L. Thomas identified the wall as a pfostenschlitzmauer in 1906. An inner wall surrounded the long by wide plateau. Natural formations (the K√§lberhutstein to the north, cliffs up to high to the west, scree slopes to the south and the rock formation known as Kleine Milseburg to the east) limited the need for artificial fortifications to a few stretches. Several springs are located on the plateau and would have supplied drinking water for the residents. Research on the Milseburg included excavations by J. Vondreau (1863-1951) and the Landesmuseum Kassel (J. Bohleau, G. Eisentraut, W. Lange) in the years between 1900 and 1906. Many traces of settlements were found on the hill top, especially near the springs. One of them, near the Kleine Milseburg consisted of around 30 circular living \\"pods\\" of roughly to diameter, delimited by stones and protected by additional walls. This \\"village\\" yielded various findings from the La T√®ne period, but no information on the possible type of house erected on the circular plans was discovered. Although only very limited in scale, the excavations yielded several hundred pounds worth of pottery shards. These indicate intensive use as a settlement during the late Hallstatt to the late La T√®ne periods (6th/5th century to 1st century BC). The oppidum likely served as a nexus for the region where Celtic and Germanic cultures met. It was the largest circular rampart in the Rh√∂n region. Other findings show that the hill was inhabited or at least visited during earlier periods: a bronze spearhead from the Urnfield culture (1200 to 800 BC) and a shard from the Corded Ware culture (roughly 2500 to 1800 BC). Later history and name One of several different versions of a Christian legend claims that the giant \\"Mils\\" who had allied himself to the devil used to live here. Saint Gangulphus vanquished the giant, who died. The devil then built a cairn for him with stones that outlined the giant's shape, feet to the north, head to the south. That supposedly created the trapezoid hill of Milseburg. The origin of the name Mils is not known for certain. In a document by Emperor Otto II from 980, the hill is already called Milsiburg. There was a small medieval castle on the western slope beneath the peak. Although it is only mentioned in a written document in 1119, it could have been built significantly earlier and given rise to the hill's name. Today The hill was the property of Johann von und zu Guttenberg until 2005. That year, he sold it to the town of Hofbieber for ‚Ç¨200,000. The State of Hesse contributed ‚Ç¨52,000, the Fulda district another ‚Ç¨10,000 to the purchase. The balance was made up by local businesses and individual donors. The Rh√∂nklub has maintained a mountain cabin on the peak for over 100 years. Nearby is the Gangolfskapelle a chapel dedicated to Saint Gangulphus. It is close to the location where the holy site of the Celts was likely situated. Since that area has not yet been excavated, no evidence of its existence has yet been found. Some small remains of the medieval castle are also still visible. At the highest point, there is a group of statues, showing a Crucifixion scene. The Milseburg also features Germany's longest cycling tunnel, a former part of the ' railway. Milseburg is a popular destination for bikers and hikers.

She was noted for her ambition and several accomplishments as a young woman, and became the highest-paid woman in public service in America in her mid- twenties. Hobbs made international news when Governor West sent her to implement martial law in the small Eastern Oregon town of Copperfield. The event was considered a strategic coup for West, establishing the State's authority over a remote rural community and cementing his reputation as a proponent of prohibition. Hobbs later worked for the American Red Cross in Europe and at The Oregon Journal newspaper. She died in Portland in 1964. Early life and career in public service Hobbs was born on May 8, 1883, in Bloomington, Nebraska, to John Alden Hobbs and Cora Bush Hobbs.Kirby, Jo Ann. Hillsboro lady pursues career in politics, law. Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. Her family moved to Salt Lake City, Utah when she was six years old; she lived there for 12 years, finishing high school. Her father then met with financial difficulties, and she moved to Oregon, settling in Hillsboro. There, she put her younger brother and sister through school, while studying stenography and working for a living, initially as a governess in a Portland home. She soon became a private secretary to the president of the Title Guarantee and Trust Company. The bank, which held many assets of the Oregon Common School Fund, failed during Hobbs' time there. Ben Olcott, was appointed by Governor Chamberlain to represent the state in investigating the bank over the state's assets. He took note of Hobbs' strong loyalty to her employer. Fern Hobbs, prior to her trip to Copperfield, Oregon After the bank's failure, Hobbs worked as a governess for J. Wesley Ladd (brother of William S. Ladd) in Portland. She also continued to help raise her younger brother and sister, studied stenography and the law, and worked as a secretary. In 1913, Hobbs graduated from Willamette University College of Law with a Bachelor of Laws degree, and was admitted to the Oregon State Bar.Terry, John. Oregon‚Äôs Trails: Spotlight was not intoxicating for envoy who downed saloons. The Oregonian, January 9, 2005. Olcott, who managed Oswald West's successful 1910 campaign to become Governor of Oregon, recommended that West hire Hobbs as his private stenographer. She was hired, and impressed West to the point that he hired her as his private secretary two years later, making her the first Oregon woman appointed to an important political office following the passage of the Oregon Equal Suffrage Amendment. This also made her, at age 27, the highest-paid woman in public service in the United States, earning $3,000 per year. Although West was a prominent supporter of woman suffrage, Hobbs opposed it. West soon dispatched her to Washington, D.C. to represent the state in various land matters; she was the first woman to represent a governor's interests in Washington, and local coverage in the nation's capital expressed some surprise that a woman would be given an assignment of such gravity. She negotiated successfully with congressional committees and the U.S. Department of the Interior to untangle ownership issues around various parcels of land. Martial law in Copperfield, Oregon West ordered Hobbs to Copperfield, Oregon to restore law and order on January 2, 1914, along with a group of six militia that included Oregon State Penitentiary warden B.K. Lawson. Copperfield, located on the Snake River in Baker County, had grown up around construction projects for a railroad tunnel and power plant. Fifteen-hundred jobs in the area came from the railway project of E. H. Harriman or the power generation facility. The town had descended into lawlessness with a number of saloons, brothels, dancing halls, and widespread gambling. The town had no law enforcement officers, and the local government officials had become bar keepers. Governor West had extended prohibition laws, but they were widely ignored in Copperfield. Some local residents had appealed to the state government for assistance. Over half the residents of the town had signed a petition, addressed to West, alleging that saloons owned by the mayor and City Council members were selling liquor to minors and staying open later than their posted hours. Governor West responded by ordering county officials to restore order, close the saloons, and force the resignations of the corrupt city leaders by December 25, 1913. County officials did not take care of the problem, so West sent Hobbs, hoping the presence of a woman would prevent any outbreak of violence. She was dispatched with orders to restore order and to implement martial law if necessary. While Hobbs was traveling to Eastern Oregon, both she and Governor West were coy with reporters about the presence of the militia, suggesting that Hobbs might be acting alone. The saloon keepers, who received word that Hobbs was accompanied by law enforcement officers only shortly before her arrival, greeted her by dressing up the town with bunting, blue and pink ribbons, and flowers. A town meeting was arranged at 2:30 p.m. on January 3. Hobbs presented resignation letters prepared on behalf of city officials, but the officials refused to sign. Hobbs then ordered Lawson to declare martial law. It was the first time in Oregon since the Civil War that martial law was put into effect. Soon the town was disarmed and order restored, with the gambling equipment and weapons confiscated, and the saloons closed down. Hobbs then left Lawson in charge and caught the 4:00 p.m. train out of town that same day. The residents did not openly resist Hobbs or the militia, although nearly all were armed and had been prepared to offer non-violent resistance. She stopped at the county seat in Baker City to officially remove the town's officials in front of a judge before returning to the state capitol in Salem. The Baker County Circuit Court quickly enjoined the militia from holding the town under martial law; Sheriff Rand began assembling a posse to carry out the court order. Governor West requested a hearing, seeking Rand's temporary removal from office, and appointed Hobbs to represent the State as special counsel. Newspaper ad for a theatrical reenactment of the Copperfield affair from the Oregon Journal, January 28, 2014. The actions of the governor were later challenged in court, with Hobbs and West among the defendants. The saloon keepers sought remuneration for liquor they claimed was confiscated during the period of martial law. The Baker County circuit court determined the governor's actions were within his powers, and the Oregon Supreme Court ultimately concurred.Governor's Actions Challenged in Oregon Supreme Court. Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on July 4, 2008.Wiegand v. West, in These events made Hobbs the most famous woman in Oregon at that time. Hobbs also made national and international news for these events.Holbrook, Stewart. \\"The Affair at Copperfield\\", reprinted in Wildmen, Wobblies and Whistle Punks (Corvallis: Oregon State University Press, 1992), p. 80. Writer Stewart Holbrook reported: Later life After the Copperfield affair, Hobbs continued as Governor West's secretary. She visited the Union County town of Cove in February 1914, also to investigate complaints about a saloon. A local election had declared the town \\"dry,\\" but a county election had declared the entire county \\"wet.\\" On advice of a judge, the mayor of Cove stated that he was unable to determine whether the saloon was legal or not, but expressed deference to the governor's wishes. Hobbs did not order the saloon closed down. Despite speculation around the country that Hobbs would run for governor of Oregon, she did not seek the office. In early 1915, West appointed Hobbs to the Oregon Industrial Accident Commission in January 1915, just prior to the end of his one term as governor. Hobbs' departure from that post later in the year was not without controversy; she offered her resignation to the Oregon State Senate as a bargaining maneuver, in exchange for its support of a contentious workmen's compensation bill. Senators speculated that her letter was presented in coordination with the ex-governor, in an effort to embarrass the Senate. Subsequently, the legislature passed a law permitting appointive heads (such as the governor) to recall officials from appointed positions. Then-governor James Withycombe accepted Hobbs' resignation. At the time, she expressed regret for not completing her term, and announced her intention to return to Portland. Gravemarker at Hillsboro Pioneer Cemetery Upon returning to Portland, Hobbs practiced law. Women's rights groups promoted Hobbs as a candidate to run for governor, but she never ran for office. Within a few years Hobbs became the commissioner of Oregon State Industrial Accident Commission, working on getting taxes due on the Oregon & California Lands. In 1917, with the United States entering World War I, she began a long association with the Red Cross. From 1917 to 1922 she worked in Europe, including time spent as the chief of the casualty division in Paris, France. In that position Hobbs was responsible for notifying dead soldiers' next of kin. She returned to Europe in the 1930s, working in the Rhine Valley when it was occupied by France. Upon returning to Oregon, Hobbs worked as a secretary for business manager of the Oregon Journal newspaper, retiring in 1948. The Oregon writer Stewart Holbrook interviewed her in the early 1950s, a few years after her retirement, observing that she \\"still weighs 104 pounds. Her eyes are clear and blue behind her glasses. There is not a gray hair on her head. She lives as quietly as she has always lived, except for those dreadful few days so long ago [concerning Copperfield].\\"Holbrook, p. 82 Holbrook noted during his interview that \\"the subject of Copperfield bores her\\" and concluded his account of her as follows: Fern Hobbs died on April 10, 1964, at the age of 80, and was buried at the Hillsboro Pioneer Cemetery in Hillsboro, Oregon.Fern Hobbs.

After being Soviet invasion of Poland arrested by the NKVD, then freed after the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement, he joined the London-based Polish government-in-exile as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, Trade and Shipping, later Minister of Treasury. Early political career An official publication of the Polish government- in-exile, March 1944, provides the following information, likely from the subject himself (brackets added showing his ages in the narrative):\\"The Polish Government and the Polish Underground State\\" (10 March 1944) \\"Jan Kwapinski (correct pronunciation: Kv-a-pin-ski), Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, Commerce and Shipping, son of a worker and a metal worker himself, has long been one of the most prominent figures in Poland's labor and political movement. Born in Warsaw in 1885, his life reflects the turbulent history of the Polish patriotic revolutionary movement. From his early youth he took an active part in the underground organization. He joined the Polish Socialist Party in 1902 [17] and played an active role in the anti-Czarist uprising of 1905 [20]. When the revolt failed, Kwapinski made his escape to Cracow (then in Austrian Poland), where he continued his political activities. After his return to Russian Poland in 1906 [21] he took part in underground revolutionary organization. The following year he was arrested by the Czarist police and sentenced to 15 years hard labor. Having organized the prisoners' rebellion in the Lomza Prison, he managed to escape, but was caught and removed to Orel Prison, where he remained until 1917 [32], when the Russian Revolution set him free. Back in Poland in 1918 [33], he was elected to the Central Committee of the Polish Socialist Party, of which he later became Vice-Chairman. His concern for the fate of the Polish workers and peasants led to his appointment, during the twenty years of Polish independence, as President of the Farm Workers Union and Polish Trade Union Congress. When the Soviets entered Poland, Kwapinski, who remained in Poland during both invasions, was deported to Siberia. Released after the signing of the Polish- Russian treaty in July 1941 [56], he proceeded to London where he was appointed to the Polish Cabinet and was made chairman of the Committee of the Polish Socialist Party.

On 14 July 1943 Prime Minister Mikolajczyk formed a coalition cabinet from the four main Polish political groups, and including, besides Jews, some without party affiliation. He named Jan Kwapi≈Ñski of the Polish Socialist Party as Vice Prime Minister as well as Minister of Industry, Commerce and Shipping. On 29 October 1943, Kwapi≈Ñski flew, with other diplomats aboard the Pan American Airways Boeing 314A 'Capetown Clipper', from Foynes, √âire to New York City, as \\"Deputy Premier\\" of Poland, arriving 5 November 1943, to attend the Atlantic City, New Jersey UNRRA conference. He was Polish signatory to the agreement at the White House on 9 November 1943.

She ranks among the most accomplished and globally renowned artists ever to have lived and worked in Hawai ªi. A child prodigy, Tennent spent her formative teenage years in Paris, where she honed technical mastery under the tutelage of William-Adolphe Bouguereau at the Acad√©mie Julian; simultaneous exposure to the city's leading avant-garde artists, including Paul C√©zanne, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Pablo Picasso, stoked her pioneering vision. Having served as an art educator in South Africa, New Zealand, and British Samoa, she settled in Honolulu with her husband and children in 1923. Tennent's prolific output spanned paintings, drawings, and sculpture. Her reverent fascination with Hawaiian women inspired the sweeping aesthetic quest that would culminate in an iconic signature style: enormous paintings of voluptuous female figures that synthesized brilliant, swirling hues into graceful, harmonious compositions. A prominent figure on the international circuit, Tennent exhibited to critical and popular acclaim around the world. At the time of her death, many critics considered her the most important individual contributor to Hawaiian art in the 20th century. Biography =Early life= Madge Tennent was born Madeline Grace Cook in Dulwich, England, the first of two daughters born to Arthur and Agnes Cook. Her father was an architect, seascape painter, and fine craftsman in woodcarving, while her mother owned, edited, and wrote for a weekly magazine titled South African Women in Council. Having settled in Cape Town by 1894, the Cooks took a lively interest in comparative creeds that embraced many religions, as well as in matters of psychic and astrological trend. Madge and her sister Violet were nurtured in this stimulating, creative environment, learning to read and write at an early age. Agnes was an accomplished pianist who taught Madge, in particular, to play. Her parents‚Äô efforts to promote tolerance among various races and creeds left a lasting impression on her. =Paris (1902-1906)= Although Madge attended an English boarding school and, later, a French Convent school in Paris, she otherwise had little formal schooling. Her talent for drawing prompted her parents to enroll her at age twelve in the Cape Town School of Art, where classes were limited to drawing from casts, still life, and portraiture; within a year, she had mastered and surpassed the curriculum. Her parents thus decided to relocate the family to Paris, where Madge could pursue more advanced training in the disciplines of art. At the Acad√©mie Julian, Madge was quickly identified as a child prodigy and invited to study under William-Adolphe Bouguereau, a prominent artist- educator closely identified with Academic art. In competition with older students from five academies, a 13-year-old Madge placed fifth with her full length charcoal drawing of a nude model. Her drive to draw and paint well was sustained without pause as she worked long hours each day. With her family she often visited the Louvre, where she could check her own progress in the realm of the masters. =Return to Cape Town and Marriage (1907-1915)= Tennent in her Cape Town studio, ca. 1914 The Cooks were steeped in the cultural life of Paris, but due to financial reverses, they returned to Cape Town in 1907. Madge was soon appointed the headmistress in art for several girls' schools in different cities of South Africa and the director of a government art school in Cape Town. At age 18, she began exhibiting her work widely. In response to one such exhibition, a critic observed, \\"One must be a mystic to recognize the meaning with which the pictures are invested.\\" By 1913, Madge had established her own art school and resumed her piano recitals. Attending one was Hugh Cowper Tennent, a chartered accountant from New Zealand who was stationed in Cape Town with the Natal Light Horse regiment. One of 11 children born to Robert and Emily Tennent, Hugh courted the 26-year-old Madge for three months following their introduction on 25 July 1915. The two were married and, shortly thereafter, embarked to New Zealand. = New Zealand and British Samoa (1915-1923) = Again Madge directed an art school, having been appointed head instructor at the Government School of Art in Woodville, the village where Madge and Hugh lived while he awaited further military orders. On 11 June 1916, she gave birth to Arthur Hugh Cowper Tennent, the first of two sons. When orders came, Hugh was posted to France in support of the allied effort in World War I. Madge relocated to her parents-in-law's home in Invercargill for the duration of Hugh's service abroad. Hugh returned from France in 1917 with a badly wounded arm. An accountant by trade, he was offered a position as treasurer to the government of British Samoa, which he chose to accept. The Tennents lived in Samoa for six years, during which time Madge was able to indulge a fascination with the native people of Polynesian descent. Madge was able to devote much of her time to drawing charcoal portraits of Samoans. =Honolulu (1923-1972)= In 1923, en route to England to enroll their sons in school, the Tennents stopped over in Honolulu. It was to have been a brief stop, but they soon were persuaded by members of the local cultural elite, including poet Don Blanding, to stay on. Madge was immediately taken with the Hawaiian people. Artistic Evolution & Style Olympia of Hawaii (with Apologies to Manet), c. 1927, Honolulu Museum of Art Three Hawaiian Women, 1941, Honolulu Museum of Art While her husband worked to build his accountancy firm, Madge Tennent supported her family as a portrait artist. With remarkable success, she drew countless child and adult portraits, mainly of Caucasian families. There was little challenge in this, however, and her imagination was already ablaze with the beauty she recognized in the Native Hawaiian and variously multiracial peoples she longed to portray. A book of Gauguin reproductions sparked her impetus to expand upon her study, research, drawing, and painting. With a strong insight into the Polynesian aesthetic, she envisioned Hawaiian kings and queens as \\"having descended from gods of heroic proportion, intelligent and brave, bearing a strong affinity to the Greeks in their legends and persons.\\" It was this reverent vision of the Hawaiians that she would endeavor to convey to the world. Influences of seminal European antecedents conspicuously permeated Tennent's transitional paintings of the late 1920s and early 1930s, such as Bathers (1926), Hawaiian Girl (1926), Girl with Apples (1926), Makuahine (1927), and Olympia of Hawaii (with Apologies to Manet) (1927). Olympia of Hawaii, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, exemplifies Tennent's enchantment with color and use of the bright, warm hues endemic to Hawai ªi. She adapted line and form to the appropriately vivid medium of oil. The majestic, explicitly Polynesian women that would figure in Madge Tennent's iconic imagery surfaced in works such as Reclining Girl (1929) and Three Filipino Ladies (1930), each a synthesis of European modernism's languid, architectonic femininity with Tennent's own racial fixation. Generously applying paint with a palette knife, she avoided sensuousness in the representation of skin texture, instead imbuing the trademark sense of strength and grandeur tinged with fragility apparent in Holoku Ball and Hawaiian Singer (early 1930s). Just as Tennent constructed her wahines layer by layer in paint, she built her canvases to equally monumental proportions; when standard issue could no longer satisfy her vision, she sewed pieces of canvas together to attain the desired size. Hawaiians Hanging Holoku, 1934, Isaacs Art Center By the mid-1930s, Tennent's works had evolved into the mammoth oils of majestic Hawaiian women that remain her signature to this day. She tapped a brilliant, decidedly tropical color palette to create Hawaiians Hanging Holoku, Lei Queen Fantasia, and Local Color (all 1934), depicting native women engaged in lei-making, dancing, and similarly island-specific activities. Hawaiian Bride (1935), one of the few paintings with which Tennent was \\"almost satisfied,\\" marked a turning point in the development of her distinctive style; there, as in the concurrent Girl in Red Dress (1935) and Two Lei Sellers (1936), she achieved an ethereal intensity with softer hues and blurred, iridescent forms. In these later works, whirling wisps of complementary oils fuse the figures to their floral surroundings, visualizing the resilient bonds Tennent perceived between the body and spirit of Hawaii. In the summer of 1935, all six canvases traveled from Honolulu to Europe for a series of major one-woman exhibitions that established Tennent's presence on the global art circuit. Her refusal to feel entirely satisfied with her output, even in the face of widespread acclaim, reflected her conviction that the artist ‚Äúevolves through conscious effort.‚Äù This conscious evolution became strikingly apparent in the early 1940s, whereupon Tennent's famously vibrant, swirling colors and thick, granular strokes gave way to a subdued monochrome, as in Three Musicians Subdued in Harmony (1940). Thereafter followed paintings in shades of ocean blues and earthy island sepias on linen, such as Hawaiian Three Graces (1941), Three Hawaiian Women (1941), and Three Hawaiians in a Library (1943). Three Hawaiian Women, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, demonstrates this stark contrast to the polychromatic blaze of her earlier works and evidences her lasting belief that ‚Äúevery true artist knows that his work must evolve or die [‚Ä¶] therefore, the moment he has perfected some type of style of expression peculiar to himself he must move on or he becomes academic.‚Äù Working on a smaller scale in the 1950s, for example, Tennent executed a series of portraits featuring Hawaiian alii in oils, prints, and watercolors; she treated Hawaiian royalty as descendants from the gods, possessed of heroic proportions and serene facial features that conveyed ‚Äúa gentleness that tends to make a predominance of convex lines, only seen in the great art of the world.‚Äù Until her death in 1972, Tennent would continuously diversify across media and scale, but never once did she stray from or grow tired of her beloved Hawaiian subjects. =Creed= * To make heavy forms lyric. * To discover fourth-dimensional interest and to make it animate, bringing it down from its imaginative dimensions to a three- dimensional technique in color, form, and rhythm. * To attempt something profound and universal in a usual and typical Hawaiian subject. * To organize and paint a big subject as one would conduct a symphony. The two in a last analysis being very much akin. * To make color perform, where possible, the work of tone. * To give vibration and chloral movement, as in nature. * To build up color shapes in a three-dimensional painting much as one builds with bricks in a three-dimensional world. * To make an aesthetic, not a static, expression in paint, and to keep a large organization in paint, lyric. * To paint each picture in its most suitable rhythm, these rhythms to be a personal expression, used to give a sense of perpetual vibration or motion. * To compose with light, apart from color, making light as important as color. * To achieve through a fundamental and traditional procedure and a personal technique, in an abstract way (so called), the story of the Hawaiian people. * To paint without thought of pleasing, to keep faith with my furthest discrimination in art, and to make no compromise aesthetically. International Recognition Local Color (1934) represented Hawaii at the 1939 New York World's Fair A renowned art educator as well as painter of modern figurative canvases of Hawaiian subjects, Madge Tennent had a distinguished career based primarily in Hawaii from where she sent paintings to the mainland United States for exhibitions in New York City and Chicago between 1930 and 1939. She was among the first artists to embrace native Hawaiians as a primary subject matter, whom she depicted as large and robust with audacious, swirling forms and colors. Two Sisters of Old Hawaii, in the collection of the Hawaii State Art Museum, is an early example of her large paintings of Hawaiian women. Her influence was increased by her association with the Honolulu Museum of Art in its early days, where she was a frequent lecturer, and where she was included in most of the Academy's early group shows. Mainland and international exhibitions include: * Ferargil Galleries, New York - 1930 * California Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco - 1932 * 12th International Watercolor Exhibition, Art Institute of Chicago - 1932 * Society of American Artists Annual, Rockefeller Center, New York - 1931, 1932, & 1936 * Northwest Annual Exhibition, Seattle Art Museum - 1933 * Bernheim-Jeune, Paris - 1935 * Wertheim Gallery, London - 1935 & 1937 * Painters & Sculptors of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Museum of Art - 1937 * Civic Center, San Francisco - 1938 * Oakland Museum of California Annual - 1938 * Drake Hotel, Chicago - 1939 * Contemporary Art of the United States, New York World's Fair - 1939-1940 = Critical reception = Writing for the London Evening Standard, Eric Newton praised Tennent's 1937 one-woman exhibition at the Wertheim Gallery: > One can see that it would be the easiest thing in the world for Mrs. Tennent > to draw and paint with literal accuracy, and leave it at that.

Legacy During the mid-1950s, Madge Tennent suffered the first of several heart attacks, prompting her to shift from large-scale undertakings on canvas to smaller works on paper. She was diagnosed with a permanent heart ailment in 1958, and by 1965 she had discontinued working and moved into the Maunalani Hospital near Manoa. After a decade of gradually declining health, Tennent died in Honolulu on 5 February 1972. Her funeral was held at St. Andrew's Cathedral in Honolulu. Three days after her death, the Hawai ªi State Senate commemorated the artist's vision, accomplishments, and influence: > IN HONOR OF THE LATE MADGE TENNENT > > WHEREAS, Madge Tennent, one of Hawaii's most important artists, died on > February 5, 1972 in the 82nd year of her long and eventful life; and > WHEREAS, better than any artist to date, Madge Tennent was able to capture > and honestly express in her many paintings and drawings the subtle charm and > quiet grace and dignity of the Hawaiian people; and WHEREAS, Madge Tennent > was also a warm and generous person, who gave often and generously of her > works to friends and to charity; and WHEREAS, Madge Tennent, having spent a > half century in Hawaii, leaves behind a rich legacy of art, which shall > forever belong to Hawaii; and therefore, BE IT RESOLVED by the Senate of the > Sixth Legislature of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1972, that this body > solemnly notes the passing of a great artist and person. \\"Even if the Hawaiians were to vanish as a race, they would live forever in the paintings of Madge Tennent,\\" remarked noted Native Hawaiian scholar and author John Dominis Holt. \\"No other artist in Hawaii has so consistently and eloquently painted, sketched, and drawn the Hawaiian Woman as has Tennent. In the physical form of a larger Hawaiian woman, she established the basis upon which to build a lasting, universal aesthetic statement. She gave her life effort and her great talent to the elaboration of this vision.\\" In 2005, Tennent was named one of the 100 most influential contributors to the city of Honolulu. Her large-scale oils on canvas and board have reportedly sold for over $1 million. The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Hawaii State Art Museum, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the National Museum of Women in the Arts (Washington, D. C.), and the Victoria and Albert Museum (London) are among the public collections holding works by Madge Tennent. The single largest intact collection of her works resides at the Isaacs Art Center, which in 2005 was named caretaker of the Tennent Art Foundation. Tennent's Hawaiian Pattern (1927) was featured in Encounters with Paradise, a seminal survey of Hawai‚Äòi art mounted at the Honolulu Museum of Art in 1992; from July 2014 until January 2015, this important early work appeared alongside two other Tennent canvasses in the museum's Art Deco Hawai‚Äòi exhibition. In September 2016, the Isaacs Art Center mounted a sweeping retrospective of Tennent's work that spanned over 40 works produced over five decades of her life. Titled Rhythm in the Round: The Modernism of Madge Tennent, the exhibition was the largest public show of the artist's work since 1976.

It provides a spectacular 360-degree panorama of the Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley for those hikers willing to climb the roadless peak. History Howard Hughes acquired the peak and surrounding acreage in the 1940s with plans to build a house for his love interest, actress Ginger Rogers. Rogers broke up their engagement, so the area was left undeveloped. In 2002, a group of Chicago-area investors named Fox River Financial Resources purchased the parcel along the ridge including Cahuenga Peak from the Hughes Estate for $1,675,000 according to Los Angeles County property records. The investors considered constructing five luxury estates on the property. Conservation Burbank Peak, Cahuenga Peak, and Mount Lee viewed across the Hollywood Reservoir Los Angeles city officials said City Hall had received hundreds of letters pleading for the peak's protection, which prompted a campaign by city leaders and conservationists to raise $6,000,000 which they thought would be sufficient to buy Cahuenga Peak and turn it into an extension of nearby Griffith Park. On February 13, 2008, Fox River Financial Resources released plans to sell the property for $22 million. left That same month, The Trust for Public Land launched the \\"Save Cahuenga Peak\\" campaign to purchase the land from the investment firm for $12.5 million. As part of the campaign they draped the Hollywood Sign so that it read \\"SAVE THE PEAK\\". On April 26 it was announced that the campaign was successful. Though funds came from many sources, including $1.7 million in public money, it was the final-hour donations of $500,000 from The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation and Aileen Getty and $900,000 from Hugh Hefner that enabled the purchase. In July 2010, more than around Cahuenga Peak was officially added to Griffith Park. The peak is home to the rare Plummer's mariposa lily, a population of coast horned lizards, and the echo blue butterfly.

Javery also started a league-leading 37 games, and finished the season with a 3.03 ERA and was 31st in MVP voting. In 1943, Javery arguably had his best season. He led the league in innings pitched with 303, led the league in batters faced with 1286, finished with a 17‚Äì16 record, the only winning record of his career, and finished 17th in MVP voting. He also pitched the final two innings of the 1943 All-Star Game, his first, strikings out three and not allowing a run en route to a 5‚Äì3 American League win. He was again named to the All-Star Game in 1944, but he did not pitch. Javery finished the 1944 season with 254 innings pitched, a 10‚Äì19 record, and a 3.54 ERA, and finished second in the National League in strikeouts per 9 innings.

The task is very similar to that of information extraction (IE), but IE additionally requires the removal of repeated relations (disambiguation) and generally refers to the extraction of many different relationships. Applications Application domains where relationship extraction is useful include gene-disease relationships, protein-protein interaction etc. Never-Ending Language Learning is a semantic machine learning system developed by a research team at Carnegie Mellon University that extracts relationships from the open web. Approaches One approach to this problem involves the use of domain ontologies. Another approach involves visual detection of meaningful relationships in parametric values of objects listed on a data table that shift positions as the table is permuted automatically as controlled by the software user. The poor coverage, rarity and development cost related to structured resources such as semantic lexicons (e.g. WordNet, UMLS) and domain ontologies (e.g. the Gene Ontology) has given rise to new approaches based on broad, dynamic background knowledge on the Web. For instance, the ARCHILES technique uses only Wikipedia and search engine page count for acquiring coarse-grained relations to construct lightweight ontologies. The relationships can be represented using a variety of formalisms/languages. One such representation language for data on the Web is RDF. More recently, end-to-end systems which jointly learn to extract entity mentions and their semantic relations have been proposed with strong potential to obtain high performance.

This route continues in a northeasterly direction through rural Fayette County and briefly overlaps SR 57 at the communities of La Grange and Grand Junction near the Hardeman county line. =Hardeman County= At Bolivar, SR 18 continues its northeasterly trek through the city as Tennessee Street and is also overlapped with US 64. SR 18 is a four-lane undivided highway while overlapped with US 64 and passes nearby the site of the Western State Mental Health Institute on the western outskirts of the city. At the Hardeman County Courthouse, SR 18 breaks away from US 64 and turns left on North Main Street. Also at this location, SR 125 begins a hidden overlap with SR 18 at the courthouse. Outside the Bolivar city limits, SR 18/SR 125 continue north through the Hatchie River bottoms before reaching the community of Shandy. At Shandy, the SR 18 & SR 125 overlap ends with SR 125 turning north on Silerton Road toward Chickasaw State Park. SR 18 in northern Hardeman County traverses sparsely populated farmland and swampland and intersects with SR 138 and SR 100. The junction of SR 18 & SR 100 is a grade-separated diamond interchange where SR 18 expands briefly to a four-lane divided highway. North of this intersection, SR 18 resumes its northbound routing towards Jackson as a rural two-lane highway. =Madison County= SR 18 continues as a two-lane route through rural southwestern Madison County and passes through the community of Medon and Malesus just south of the Jackson city limits. In Jackson, the route ends at an expansive signalized intersection with US 45 and hidden SR 5, known locally as South Highland Avenue. History Little has changed along SR 18 since its designation as a state route. Prior to 1981, SR 18 had one alternate route near Grand Junction which was originally signed as State Route 18A. This entire route was renamed to what is now known as Tennessee State Route 368. SR 18 roughly follows the original route of the Mississippi Central Railroad. Future In Hardeman County, an Environmental Impact Statement is currently underway to determine the feasibility of widening SR 18 from its current two-lane status to a divided four-lane highway.Tennessee Department of Transportation, SR 18 Improvement Website This work is part of a larger effort by TDOT to widen SR 18 from Bolivar north to Jackson as directed in House Joint Resolution 16 of the 98th Tennessee General Assembly.98th Tennessee General Assembly, House Joint Resolution No. 16, 1993 Major intersections References External links *Tennessee Department of Transportation 018 Category:Transportation in Fayette County, Tennessee Category:Transportation in Hardeman County, Tennessee Category:Transportation in Madison County, Tennessee Category:Jackson metropolitan area, Tennessee ","title":"Tennessee State Route 18"},{"id":"11547616","text":"\\"The Last Show\\" is the 168th episode and series finale of the television sitcom The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and it was written by Allan Burns, James L.

Surprisingly, Lou, Mary, Murray, and Sue Ann are fired, but the person widely perceived as the cause of the Six O'Clock News' low ratings, Ted, is retained. Mary, Rhoda, and Phyllis reunited at last Everyone takes the news pretty hard, except for Ted, who saunters back into the newsroom, but it is Mary who takes the news hardest. To cheer her up, Lou arranges for her old friends Rhoda Morgenstern and Phyllis Lindstrom to fly to Minneapolis for a surprise visit at Mary's apartment. Time had failed to tame their rivalry, however. Both agitate for Mary to move with them to New York and San Francisco, respectively, but they compromise that she stays in the Twin Cities. Rhoda gets to the heart of the matter and comforts Mary, then reluctantly allows Phyllis to do the same. At one point, Ted threatens to resign if they fire the rest of the staff. However, he caves in quickly when pushed. This causes Murray to quip, \\"When a donkey flies, you don't blame him for not staying up that long.\\" On their final broadcast together, Ted gives his colleagues a sincere on-air sendoff by obliviously quoting \\"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\\". Afterward, the Six O'Clock News' staff, along with Georgette, gather in the newsroom to say goodbye to each other. The memorable and oft-parodied scene culminates in an emotional huddle, during which nobody wants to let go, and, needing some tissues, the group shuffles en masse toward a box on Mary's desk. After final goodbyes, everyone exits the newsroom singing \\"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\\". Finally, a very emotional Mary looks back, then bucks up and smiles before turning off the lights and closing the door. The original broadcast included a curtain call behind the closing credits, during which Mary Tyler Moore introduced her co- stars to the live audience as \\"the best cast ever.\\" This was omitted from the final CBS repeat (on September 3, 1977) and syndicated airings, but is available on the season 7 DVD release.

It is an alternative retelling (and prequel during the final scene which seem to reboot the story in another universe) of the Genesis of Aquarion television series, divided into two parts, and . A film compilation with some added and deleted footage and also bonus episode of the original series was released, titled . Plot In the past the Angels lived free on Earth's surface. They hunted humans to feed on their vital energy, called Prana. This was true until mankind decided to rise against them with the aid of Apollonius; a powerful Angel who sided with humanity against his peers. Apollonius had fallen in love with a woman called Celiane. Together Apollonius, Celiane, and a human noble called Scorpius battled the Angels riding a giant humanoid machine; the Mechanical Angel Aquarion. Their valiant efforts lead to the Angels' defeat and their subsequent confinement in their icy prison. However Scorpius had a desire to become an angel himself and it caused him to betray and kill his comrade Apollonius. 12,000 years have passed and the Angels have reappeared to threaten mankind once more, kidnapping humans from entire cities around the globe in order to use their Prana to bring their people back to life. Deava, an international organization created to fight the Angels using replicas of the original Aquarion had little success so far. But when the reincarnations of Apollonius, Celiane and Scorpius finally meet together, the real Aquarion reappears on Earth, and the wheels of fate start to turn once more. Characters *Apollo: The main protagonist and reincarnation of the Angel Apollonius. He lived in a forest with his grandfather until his death two years ago. Since then he has lived by himself until meeting Reika and Silvia. His personality differs in this story, as the Apollo from the original series was loud and easily angered, this Apollo is calmer and has shown restraint when dealing with certain situations. He also has a great sense of empathy to plants and animals. At first he showed no consideration for the war between humans and Angels as the humans tend to fight without caring about their surroundings; damaging the wildlife in the process. But when his memories from his former life awakens and he ends up obliged to take action in the conflict, he discovers the world and its problems are bigger than the little forest where he was raised. *Silvia de Alisia: A noble from the Alisia family and reincarnation of Apollonius's human lover Celiane, she was tricked by Touma into thinking she was the reincarnation of Scorpius. Devastated with the death of her older brother Sirius in the war against the Angels, Silvia found new strength to fight after meeting Apollo and Aquarion. *Hong Lihua: Best known as Reika. Just like Apollo and Silvia, visions of her past life appear little by little before her. She thought she was the reincarnation of Celiane because she saw Celiane's face as Scorpious killed Apollonius, she is actually the reincarnation of Scorpius. *Touma: An Angel and the main antagonist. His objective is to harvest enough Prana from mankind to bring his fellow Angels back to life, with the aid of his loyal servant Otoha, who is also in love with him. But his plans change when the reincarnation of Apollonius finally is revealed, because of his love for him.

The school is composed of two campuses, one each in Middletown, Virginia, United States and Warrenton, Virginia, United States. Admission is determined via an application process.Prospective Students History Planning for Mountain Vista began in 2003; its participating counties were one of the last in the state not covered by an existing academic-year governor's school or similar program. The participating school systems surveyed parents and students within their respective counties to gauge interest. A plan for implementation was created and put into motion; A committee was formed, and approval was sought from the Virginia Department of Education.Mountain Vista Governor‚Äôs School officially opens A first review of the plan was presented to the Virginia Department of Education at their January 11, 2006 meeting.Board of Education Agenda January 11, 2006 The funding for MVGS (a total of $190,544) was first approved in the 2006-2008 Biennial Budget passed by the Virginia House of Delegates.Report from the House of Delegates On January 11, the estimated portion of the school budget that the participating counties had to pay was approximately $216,527; it was divided among each of the counties.Area's first governor's school on track for fall opening Each county's school board was responsible for approving both the funding and a 3-year commitment in order for the project to continue.Winchester Public School Board Highlights Fauquier County Finance Committee Meeting Each jurisdiction was made responsible for the funding for each slot at the governor's school allocated to them. In May 2006, Dr. Rosanne Williamson was named director of Mountain Vista, and she assumed the post on July 1. On January 15, 2011, students from both campuses travelled with their teachers to Richmond, where they participated in the 2011 Volvo Construction Challenge. The Middletown team of four students placed second in the Transportation Infrastructure challenge. Admission Each participating county has a local committee that decides who attends from that county. Students interested must complete an application and submit transcripts and two written essays.New Opportunities Beckoning Students in Fauquier The applications along with teacher recommendations are reviewed by the local committee and admission decisions are made. =Participating localities= The number of slots at the governor's school allocated to each jurisdiction, as of September 14, 2006: *Frederick & Fauquier (30) *Culpeper (15) *Winchester (13) *Warren (15) *Rappahannock (4) Facilities The Mountain Vista Governor's School program does not have a classroom facility of its own. Instead, students travel to Lord Fairfax Community College to take courses offered by the program, then the students return to their home schools and maintain eligibility for sports and extracurricular activities there. The area served by Mountain Vista is too large for a single location to which busing all students would be practical; LFCC was chosen because it has a campus on each end of the area covered by Mountain Vista.LFCC - Our Locations The two sites are connected via videoconferencing that allow them to interact with each other.LFCC - Distance Learning In addition, all Mountain Vista students are given laptops by their respective county for use year round. During the 06-07 and 07-08 school years, the school used the Blackboard Academic Suite of e-Education software designed to allow the students to submit and retrieve notes and assignments on snow days or other missed days of school, and to provide virtual office hours for instructors. Frederick County Public Schools provided the means of sharing their purchased BAS with MVGS. However, during the 2008-09 school year, Frederick County switched to the ANGEL Learning Management System, causing Mountain Vista to change to ANGEL along with it. MVGS also used a private discussion board for communication between staff and students. Then, in the 2011-2012 school year, MVGS decided to change from ANGEL to Google sites due to technical issues with ANGEL. Google groups were created as classes and Google mail sent out homework quickly and efficiently. Academics The Mountain Vista curriculum was designed to be a college level mathematics and science program providing a solid basis for doing research and making connections between disciplines.MVGS At A Glance 09-10 The classes are connected in a way that when a topic is being taught in physics, a similar concept is being taught in math and humanities is discussing social applications and ramifications of the subject. Most of the courses have homework assignments assigned during the summer and due on the first day of class making learning a year-round activity.MVGS Summer Assignments 2007 A number of MVGS classes are Dual Enrollment, AP, or both, giving the students the ability to earn college credits while still in high school.

He was a regular on the U.S. junior national teams and U.S. Olympic team in the mid-1990s. He also spent several years with D.C. United in Major League Soccer. Youth Peay grew up in Columbia, Maryland and attended Oakland Mills High School where he played on the boys' soccer team. After graduating from high school, he attended the University of Virginia where he was a defender on the men‚Äôs soccer team from 1991 to 1995. During Peay‚Äôs four seasons, the Cavaliers won the NCAA championship four consecutive years. Of note, Oakland Mills won the Maryland State Championship and was ranked #1 in the state at the end of Peay's senior year. In Peay's four years at the University of Virginia, his teams also won their respective championships, each time ending the year ranked #1. For his first two years with the DC United, his team won the MLS Championship. Finally in or about 2000, Peay's decade long run of season ending championships came to an end when the DC United did not successfully defend their MLS Championship. Junior National and Olympic Teams In 1993, Peay was the captain of the U.S. U-20 national team that competed at the U-20 World Cup. The U.S. went 1-1-1 in the first round, qualifying for the second round where the team fell to Brazil 3-0. 1995, Peay was a member of the U.S. team at the 1995 Pan American games. The U.S. went 0-3 and did not make the second round. That year Peay also was on the U.S. team at the World University Games. In 1996, Bruce Arena, who coached Peay at the University of Virginia, selected Peay for the U.S. soccer team at the 1996 Summer Olympics. The U.S. went 1-1-1, but failed to qualify for the second round. Peay played all three games as a central defender. Club career Arena continued to turn to Peay when D.C.

Peay‚Äôs playing dropped significantly as in 1997 as he started only eight games. In 1998, it fell further as he played only 394 minutes in six games before United waived Peay on June 30, 1998. When Peay became available, the Charleston Battery of the U.S. Second Division, signed him. He then played eight games with the Battery in 1998. At the end of the season, the Battery traded Peay to the Maryland Mania for first round 1999 draft pick. However, on May 13, 1999, D.C. United signed Peay, ironically as a discovery player. In 1999, Peay saw even fewer minutes than in 1998, a total of only 241 in five games. Then, during the 2000 pre-season, he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. While he attempted to work himself back into playing condition, he realized he could not and retired on November 8, 2000. Following his retirement from playing professionally, Peay became United‚Äôs broadcast announcer. Coaching On January 27, 2003, Georgetown University hired Peay as an assistant coach.

He played college football at Oregon State University. Early years Marsh was the starting running back at Wallowa High School, contributing to the team's Tu-Valley football co-championship in 1957. Which was a three way tie with Enterprise and Union, but only Wallowa advanced to the state playoffs after a vote by the league's school superintendents. As a sprinter and long jumper in track, Marsh helped Wallowa win the 1957 State Class \\"B\\" title. During those years, he developed a famous rivalry with Jim Puckett from Cove High School. The two raced in the 100 yard dash competition, with Puckett winning every contest, making Marsh the 100-yard dash state runner up three times (1956‚Äì1958). The 100-yard dash is no longer practiced and was run from 1927 to 1977. College years Marsh accepted an Oregon State University track and field scholarship, where he competed as a sprinter, hurdler and a broad jumper. In college, he repeatedly beat Puckett, who ran representing the University of Oregon. He also played football as a wingback, halfback, split end and kicker. He was part of the 14-0 upset to the No. 6 ranked University of Southern California at the Los Angeles Coliseum on September 16, 1960. The Trojans were ranked No. 1 in the preseason by Playboy magazine and it was the last time an OSU team experienced victory at USC. As a senior, he was moved to split end but did not have much success, catching only 10 passes. He was selected to be a part of the North-South Shrine Game. In 1960, he was the Northwest sprint champion in both the 100 and 220. Professional Football =Dallas Cowboys= Marsh was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1961 NFL Draft, because they were impressed by his speed. He also was a powerful player, earning the nicknames \\"Moose\\" and \\"Forward Marsh\\". He started his career as a wide receiver and special teams player. He was eventually moved to fullback to take advantage of his size and speed, while splitting time with J. W. Lockett. He led the team in kickoff and punt returns. He set franchise records with a 71-yard run from scrimmage and a 79-yard kickoff return. In 1962, he played fullback alongside Don Perkins, ranking seventh in the NFL with 802 yards and a 5.6-yard average per carry. That year, he set a franchise record with an 85-yard touchdown reception against the Los Angeles Rams and also broke his franchise record for the longest kickoff return with 101 yards, which was broken by Alexander Wright 29 years later in 1991. The play came against the Philadelphia Eagles, when the Cowboys became the first NFL team in history to produce two 100-yard plays in the same game: a 100-yard interception return for a touchdown by strong safety Mike Gaechter and the 101 yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Marsh. In 1964, he was moved to halfback, with Perkins taking over the fullback position. Marsh's production regressed during the following years, while alternating with Jim Stiger. On September 9, 1965, he was traded to the Detroit Lions, after the team acquired fullback J.D. Smith. The Cowboys selected Walt Garrison with the fifth round draft choice they obtained in the transaction. =Detroit Lions= Playing as a fullback in 1965, he led the Detroit Lions in rushing (405 yards) and touchdowns (8). On August 19, 1968, he was traded to the Atlanta Falcons in exchange for a conditional 1969 draft pick (not exercised). =Atlanta Falcons= On September 2, 1969, he was waived by the Atlanta Falcons before the start of the season. Personal life His brother Frank also went on to play professional football and then into professional basketball. Marsh died on November 2, 1992, after suffering a series of strokes, because of his diabetes condition.

On June 18, 1961, Leppert connected in the second inning of his MLB debut against Curt Simmons of the St. Louis Cardinals; the blow gave the Pirates a 2‚Äì1 lead in a game they would eventually win, 5‚Äì3. Almost two years later, on April 11, 1963, he hit three homers in his third game in the American League; a solo shot off Ike Delock in the fourth inning, followed by a three-run blast and another solo homer, both off relief pitcher Chet Nichols, as the Senators beat the Boston Red Sox, 8‚Äì0, at DC Stadium.

Lindell stood tall and weighed ; he threw and batted right-handed. Athletic career Born in Greeley, Colorado, Lindell attended Monrovia High School in Monrovia, California, where he starred in football and track as well as in baseball. At the 1935 Southern California Prep Championships, he won the 120 yard High Hurdles and placed third in the long jump. Lindell won a scholarship to attend the University of Southern California. Lindell began his professional baseball career in at the age of 19 when he was signed by the New York Yankees organization. He progressed through the Yankees' minor league system as a pitcher. While playing for the Kansas City Blues in , he led the American Association with 18 victories. Lindell made his major league debut at the age of 24 with the Yankees on April 18, 1941 before being returned to the minor leagues where, he won 23 games against 4 defeats to help the Newark Bears win the International League championship. In December , he was selected as the Minor League Player of the Year. Lindell returned to the major leagues in 1942 as a relief pitcher but, Yankees manager Joe McCarthy thought that his low strikeout totals indicated that his fast ball had lost its velocity. During spring training in 1943, McCarthy experimented with using Lindell as a first baseman and as an outfielder. He hit well enough to win the starting right fielder's position and, had a batting average above the .300 mark in early June to earn a place as a reserve player for the American League team in the 1943 All-Star Game. In the second half of the season, his hitting tapered off and he was replaced in the starting lineup by Bud Metheny. Lindell ended the season leading the league with 12 triples along with a .245 batting average in 122 games as the Yankees won the American League pennant by 13¬Ω games over the Washington Senators. Lindell played a pivotal role in Game 3 of the 1943 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. With the series tied at one game apiece and the Yankees trailing by a score of 2 to 1, Lindell hit a single to lead off the eighth inning and, reached second base when center fielder Harry Walker mishandled the ball. When Snuffy Stirnweiss hit a bunt to first baseman Ray Sanders, Lindell attempted to advance to third base. Sanders' throw reached third baseman Whitey Kurowski in time as Lindell made a head-first slide. His head bounced up into Kurowki's head forcing the third baseman to drop the ball. The Yankees then proceeded to score five runs to win the game 6 to 2. The play at third base was considered a turning point in the series as the Yankees went on to win the next two games and won the world championship. Lindell had his most productive season in 1944 when he led the league in triples, extra base hits, total bases, and had a .300 batting average with 18 home runs and 103 runs batted in. Also in 1944, Lindell tied a major league record by hitting four doubles in a game, and he recorded 468 putouts, the tenth best season total for an outfielder during the years he played. Lindell was drafted into the United States Army in June 1945 and only appeared in 44 games that season. He was discharged from the Army in March 1946. With outfielders Joe DiMaggio, Tommy Henrich and Charlie Keller returning to the Yankees from military service after the Second World War, Lindell slipped into the role of a utility player. An injury to Keller in 1947 gave him another chance to play regularly and in the 1947 World Series, Lindell had a .500 batting average, leading the team with 7 runs batted in, as the Yankees defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in a seven-game series. In 1948, he posted a .317 batting average with 13 home runs, 55 runs batted in and a career-high .387 on-base percentage while appearing in 88 games. During spring training in 1949, Lindell developed a knuckleball and new Yankees manager Casey Stengel experimented with using him as a relief pitcher. On October 1, , during a late-season pennant race, he hit an eighth-inning, game-winning, home run against the Boston Red Sox, putting the Yankees into a tie with their Boston arch-rivals with one game left to play. The Yankees went on to win the final game to clinch the American League pennant then defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1949 World Series. In May 1950, Lindell's contract was purchased by the St. Louis Cardinals from the Yankees. After posting just a .186 batting average in 36 games for the Cardinals, he was sold to the Cardinals' minor league affiliate, the Columbus Red Birds who then traded him to the Hollywood Stars of the Brooklyn Dodgers organization. The Stars' manager, Fred Haney, converted Lindell into a knuckleball pitcher and, in , he won 24 games against 9 losses to help the Stars win the Pacific Coast League pennant. He led the league in victories and strikeouts and, was voted the league's Most Valuable Player. His knuckleball proved to be unpredictable as he also led the league in bases on balls. Lindell returned to the major leagues in at the age of 36 as a knuckleball pitcher, playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates, before being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in August 1953. His knuckleball proved to be difficult to control in , as he led the league in bases on balls and wild pitches. Although listed as a pitcher with the Pirates, he batted .286 and was used 34 times as a pinch-hitter, once tying a game with a 3-run ninth-inning home run. Lindell played his last major league game on May 9, 1954 at age 37. The Phillies released him in May 1954. Career statistics In a twelve-year major league career, Lindell played in 854 games with 762 hits in 2,795 at bats for a .273 batting average along with 72 home runs, 404 runs batted in and a .344 on-base percentage. As a pitcher, he compiled an 8‚Äì18 record with a 4.47 earned run average. He led American League outfielders in 1943 with a .994 fielding percentage. Lindell died of lung cancer in Laguna Beach, California on August 27, , just three days before his 69th birthday.

It is an inter-American instrument with the central aim of strengthening and upholding democratic institutions in the nations of the Americas. The Charter, which is binding on all 34 of the currently active OAS member states, spells out what democracy entails and specifies how it should be defended when it is under threat.  Background  Beginning in the 1980s, and especially after the Cold War, as international interest in multilateral action in support of human rights and democracy resulted in several conventions and treaties at the United Nations and other regional organizations of states, the Organization of American States held a series of diplomatic conferences on the issue of democracy. Democracy is one of the foundational principles of the OAS, and it was enshrined in its charter from the beginning. In 1985, the Protocol of Cartagena de Indias strengthened the charter's original language on democracy by asserting that \\"representative democracy is an indispensable condition for the stability, peace and development of the region\\" and \\"[t]he solidarity of the American States and the high aims which are sought through it require the political organization of those States on the basis of the effective exercise of representative democracy\\". However, the charter also exhorts the organization to promote democracy \\"with due respect for the principle of nonintervention,\\" and lacks any mechanism for collective action among the states in defense of democracy. The Carter Center‚Äôs Americas Program advised the Organization of American States on the development of the document. The General Assembly special session in Lima at which the Democratic Charter was adopted was the reason why United States Secretary of State Colin Powell was absent from his country during the Al-Qaeda terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001; he cut short his participation at the meeting and departed Lima for Washington, D.C., shortly after midday.Press Briefing By Philip T. Reeker U.S. State Department, 11 September 2001; retrieved 2007-06-01. Provisions Article 1 frames the purpose and goal of the Charter: :\\"The peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it.\\" Title IV establishes how the Organization is to react following \\"an unconstitutional interruption of the democratic order or an unconstitutional alteration of the constitutional regime that seriously impairs the democratic order in a member state.\\" Article 19 states that such an interruption or alteration constitutes \\"an insurmountable obstacle to its government's participation in sessions of the General Assembly, the Meeting of Consultation, the Councils of the Organization, the specialized conferences, the commissions, working groups, and other bodies of the Organization.\\" Consequently, Article 20 provides that following such a breakdown in a member state's constitutional regime, any other member state or the Secretary General may request the immediate convocation of the Organization's Permanent Council to undertake a collective assessment of the situation and to take such decisions as it deems appropriate. Should the Permanent Council's diplomatic efforts prove fruitless in re-establishing the constitutional order, or if the situation is deemed particularly urgent, a special session of the General Assembly may be convened to address the matter. That special session may then resolve, by a two-thirds vote of the member states, to suspend the membership of the state in question. Once the situation that led to suspension has been resolved, the suspended member may be re-instated by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly. The Charter contains additional provisions dealing with actions to be adopted by member states to promote a culture of democracy within their countries, and it sets a framework for the conduction of the OAS's electoral observation missions in the member states.

He played for the Boston Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, and Cincinnati Reds. He was the first Major Leaguer to have an error-free season. That same season, 1942, he also became the first player to stitch together the fingers of his glove. Early career Before entering baseball, Litwhiler graduated from college, unlike most major leaguers at the time. He graduated from Bloomsburg State Teacher's College in 1938, earning a bachelor's degree in Science and Social Sciences. The baseball facility at Bloomsburg is named Danny Litwhiler Field. Major League career After finishing the 1941 season with a .305 batting average, he was selected to the All Star game in 1942, where he hit safely in his only at-bat. In 1942, he recorded 308 putouts and 9 assists without making an error for a 1.000 fielding percentage. He had an errorless streak of 187 games before making an error on May 20, 1943, the only error he made that season as he led all outfielders in fielding percentage for the second straight year with a .996 fielding percentage. Litwhiler was traded to the Cardinals in 1943 and was a key player for them in the 1944 World Series against the St. Louis Browns. He played left field in five of the six games and had four hits with one RBI and two runs scored. Coaching career Litwhiler (right) as Florida State coach with Jimmie Foxx (left), Miami coach. Litwhiler coached at Florida State University from 1955 to 1963, and led them to three College World Series appearances. He then coached at Michigan State University from 1964 to 1982, and holds the record for most wins by a coach in the school's history. Among his former players are Steve Garvey, Kirk Gibson and Rick Miller. During his coaching career, he invented a very effective method of drying baseball fields after rain using calcined clay which was marketed as Diamond Grit, enabling play to resume very quickly and in the process saving organized baseball millions of dollars over the decades. He also invented the use of the radar gun for timing pitches, which effectively revolutionized the assessment of pitchers. It first came on the market in collaboration with the Jugs company, known as the Jugs Gun. Death Litwhiler died on September 23, 2011 in Clearwater, Florida at age 95.

Art by autistic artists has long been shown in separate venues from artists without disabilities.AutismConnect - Museums thrust autistic artists into the mainstream The art of autistic people has often been considered part of outsider art. There might be relationships between autism and talent due to the sensory hypersensitivity and the tendency of autistic people to concentrate more deeply on details. The works of some autistic artists have featured in art publications and documentaries and been exhibited in mainstream galleries. Now there are many autistic art programs and projects founded by nonprofit organizations, autistic artists or other institutions to help autistic people to express themselves and promote autistic art.  Overview  Autistic people have various differences in brain regions involving emotional processing, social cognition, face recognition, and executive functioning. They may hyper- and hypo-sensitive to sensory stimuli, even to the extent that they can't participate in normal social activities. For example, a child with autism may not be able to attend a movie due to the crowded and noisy environment. On the other hand, this kind of sensory hyper sensitivity may make an autistic person much more perceptive than an ordinary person. The extreme attention to detail that is common in autistic people may result talent in mathematics, art or other fields. Autistic persons who have talent in art are often outsiders in the art community. Unlike with common art, there is seldom any tradition or academic criteria in their creations. Each has their own style of art which, which may present the inner world of an autistic person.  People  * Stephen Wiltshire (b. 1974)  typically depicts cityscapes in his work.

He was the chief executive of Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development, an Auckland Council organisation that came into being in November 2010, until his abrupt resignation in October 2011. He was chief executive of Hamilton City Council from May 2007 to October 2010. He was Mayor of Hamilton from 2004 to May 2007. When he resigned to become the chief executive of Hamilton City Council, he was replaced by deputy mayor and former Member of Parliament Bob Simcock. In 2006 Michael Redman was a named an Emerging Leader in the Sir Peter Blake Leadership Awards.  Career  Michael Redman attended school at St John's College in Hamilton and then spent 18 years in business. In 1986 he started his own advertising firm which he ran for 14 years. After the business was acquired in 2000 by Grey Group, he headed the New Zealand branch of the merged business for nearly three years. He was elected to the governing board of the Communication Agencies Association in 2002. Redman was also co-owner and director of a local clothing design, manufacturing and import business and a member of the Institute of Directors. He started the domestic basketball team New Zealand Breakers, a full-time professional club playing in the Australian National Basketball League, but sold his interest in the club after being elected mayor. He served seven years on the board of the Northern Districts Cricket Association, eventually becoming deputy chairman. He has served as Deputy Chairman of Parentline Trust and was a member of the Violence Intervention Pilot (VIP) Working Group. He was founding Chairman of Hamilton Combined Foodbanks Trust. Redman resigned as Hamilton City Council Chief Executive in October 2010 to be chief executive of Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED), an Auckland Council organisation.  Controversy  On 27 May 2007 Michael Redman had said \\"The opportunity to apply for the vacant position for CEO of Hamilton City Council was a rare and special prospect\\" and it was one that brought V8 Supercar racing to Hamilton. Controversy over costs erupted and Michael Redman resigned from ATEED on 28 October 2011 after a commercial review of the processes followed by Hamilton City Council in relation to the V8 Supercars Event, commissioned by Hamilton Council from Audit New Zealand in February 2011, raised compliance issues and claimed millions of dollars were spent on the Hamilton V8 Supercars stage without council's full knowledge. Michael Redman rejected outright the major findings of the Audit NZ report. On 1 May 2007 Hamilton City Council announced receipt of a report on compliance costs. Chair of the Finance and Audit Committee Roger Hennebry said that the report was an important step in increasing public awareness about how rates were spent - \\"Compliance costs are growing and growing and will be an area of expenditure that will go under particular scrutiny at a national level over the coming months.\\" \\"Whilst the report outlines costs incurred for new legislation it also highlights Council's lost revenue as a result of its inability to generate rates on Crown owned land. We estimate this missed revenue to be valued at $2.1m per year.\\" The report identified 60 new pieces of Government legislation enacted since 2000 and summarises the resulting cost to Council though their implementation. The report summary showed costs under four headings totalling over $3m. In a case study on the review of the Hamilton V8 Supercar race series Audit New Zealand advised \\"Audit New Zealand's report on the V8 event could be a good guide for local authorities for managing major events.\\" \\"In most cities in New Zealand, local government is big business. Many local authorities are aware that their major event will be controversial ‚Äì even before it starts. This could be because of its size, or its community impact, or the amount of funding involved.\\" \\"Local authorities should manage all major events on project principles especially around cost, completion times and value. This is particularly important if the event is likely to be costly, or controversial, or both. This, and the regular real-time review of actual performance against the initial business case for the event, is the main lesson from our report.\\" A briefing to a journalist led to publication of contested remarks said to quote from the full report. For example, the suggestion that costs soared from $7m to almost $39m may be compared with section 10.1.9 'Early information on costs' which states (in full): \\"We were advised by several current and former Councillors during interviews for this review that when the Council committed to the V8 event in 2006 the costs to HCC had been indicated as being $7 million. However, in reviewing this claim we found that the 2006-16 LTCCP referred to the race event as having an infrastructure cost of $7 million together with \\"the fee to be paid to promoters to run the event\\". Consequently, Council had clear information at the time it finalised the LTCCP (June 2006) that the total cost for the race event over seven years would be in excess of $20 million. We do not accept that the race event could ever have been understood to be only a $7 million financial commitment to HCC. The passage of time may have led to some misunderstanding about this.\\" In October 2011 the Hamilton City Council considered legal action against Michael Redman but following legal advice decided against it in private. In a press release on 26 October 2011 former Mayor Bob Simcock said \\"By placing an unjustified level of blame on staff, and on Michael Redman in particular, the review has achieved council's shameful goal. While I agree with a number of the recommendations the review has made around process, there is nothing in [it] that would have led to a different outcome for the event.\\" \\"For more than four years every significant decision relating to the event was supported by the unanimous vote of 13 councillors. At the time, and given the information that was available to council, councillors made reasonable decisions. If with the knowledge of hindsight, the community believes we got it wrong, we all share that responsibility. Councillors who blame their decisions on staff are gutless and unfit for public office.\\" References Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Hamilton, New Zealand Category:1966 births Category:English emigrants to New Zealand Category:People educated at St John's College, Hamilton ","title":"Michael Redman (politician)"},{"id":"11547912","text":"Acrophialophora fusispora is a poorly studied ascomycete fungus found in soil, air and various plants. A. fusispora is morphologically similar to the genera Paecilomyces and Masonia, but differ in the presence of pigmented conidiophores, verticillate phialides, and frequent sympodial proliferation. Moreover, A. fusispora is distinguished by its pigmented spindle-shaped conidia, covered with spiral bands. The fungus is naturally found in soils of tropical to temperate regions. The fungus has been identified as a plant and animal pathogen, and has recently been recognized as an emerging opportunistic human pathogen. A. fusispora infection in human is rare and has few documented clinical cases, but due to the rarity of the fungus and potential misidentification, the infections may be underdiagnosed. Clinical cases of A. fusispora include cases of keratitis, pulmonary colonization and infection, and cerebral infections. The fungus also has two documented cases of infection in dogs.  History  The genus Acrophialophora was created by Edward J. C. in the year 1959, with a single species, Acrophialophora nainiana. However, the genus was not accepted as a distinct genus until 1970 when Samson and Mahmood differentiated Acrophialophora from the morphologically similar genera Paecilomyces and Masonia, and described the species, Acrophialophora fusispora.  Taxonomy  The genus Acrophialophora consist of 3 species: A. fusispora, A. levis, and A. seudatica, while A. fusispora, A. nainiana, and M. indica were found to be of the same species, now labeled with a single name, A. fusispora. The 3 species are differentiated by consistent morphological differences, such as conidial size, shape, or color. Through genetic analysis, A. fusispora was found to belong to the family Chaetomiaceae, which includes mostly cellulose decomposers found in the soil, and thermotolerant opportunistic pathogens. Elements of the taxonomy of A. fusispora remain unresolved. Growth and morphology Acrophialophora fusispora (UAMH 11640) colony on CER incubated for 7 days at 30 C Acrophialophora fusispora is similar to Paecilomyces, but differ in the presence of pigmented, warted conidiophores, verticillate phialides in limited numbers with narrowing tip, and frequent sympodial proliferation. A. fusispora is distinguished by its pigmented fusiform conidia, which are covered by spiral bands, measuring 5-12 x 3-6Œºm. The conidia arises in long single-cell basipetal chains, ranging from colorless to pale-brown and broadly ellipsoidal to lemon-shaped. The conidiophores arise singly, terminally, and laterally from the hyphae, and are erect or ascending, straight or flexuous, smooth or rough, and septate. Moreover, the conidiophores are thick-walled with brown at the base and pale towards the apex. The conidiophores are up to 1.5Œºm long and 2-5Œºm wide, with whorls of phialides at the end. The phialides are flask-shaped and swollen near the base, with a long, narrow neck, and hyaline, smooth or spiny wall. The phialides are borne on conidiophores, or sometimes, on vegetative hyphae, with the broadest part measuring 9-15Œºm x 3-4.5Œºm. A. fusispora only reproduces asexually. The colonies of A. fusispora are dense, matted and felt- like at the base, with cottony aerial hyphae. The color of the colonies is initially dull white, but becoming grayish-brown, with black colony reverse. The colonies can reach 4‚Äì7 cm in diameter within 14 days at 25 ¬∞C on Malt Extract Agar. In vitro growth was found to be stimulated by exudates and extracts of Cassia tora. The fungus also grows well and sporulates freely on potato dextrose agar. Habitat and ecology Acrophialophora fusispora has been isolated from soil, air, and various plants, such as Cajanus, Cicer, maize, and Tephrosia. The fungus found in the soil of tropical to temperate regions, and is known from uncultivated soils, field soils, under leguminous plants or grasses, forest soils, and salt-marshes. With exception of records from Czechoslovakia, Singapore, Tuamotu Archipelago, Egypt, and Pakistan, A. fusispora is almost exclusively reported from India. The fungus has been found commonly on root surfaces and rhizospheres of grasses, cotton, Euphorbia species and Carica papaya, and on rhizoids of Funaria species. Additionally, A. fusispora has also been isolated from earthworm casts and woods exposed to seawater. Moreover, in the rhizosphere of Trigonella foenum-graecum, foliar spray with the antibiotic subamycin increases the potential for A. fusispora isolation. Acrophialophora fusispora exhibits a distinct preference for deeper (30‚Äì45 cm) soil horizon in India. The fungus is thermotolerant, with a minimum temperature of , optimum temperature at , and maximum temperature of . Pathogenicity Acrophialophora fusispora has been recognized as an emerging opportunistic human pathogen, responsible for cases of keretitis, pulmonary colonization and infection in patients with cystic fibrosis, and cerebral infections. However, as the fungus is very rare with high possibility of misidentification, there has been concerns of underdiagnosed A. fusispora infections. There exists only 6 cases of well-documented A. fusispora infection in human, and within which, only 1 case was confirmed as A. fusispora by sequencing. Antifungal susceptibility data for the fungus was limited and based on only a small number of clinical cases. An antifungal drug test demonstrated that voriconazole had the greatest in vitro activity, while other antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin B, itraconazole, posaconazole, terbinafine, anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, showed little in vitro activity against the fungus. However, variable antifungal results were shown in different clinical cases.

In northern Florida, there is a weak winter secondary maximum while statewide the driest months of the year are during the spring. During El Ni√±o, Florida sees greater rainfall between November and March.

Some places report in excess of 90 thunderstorm days per year, making Florida one of the most thundery regions outside of the tropics. Florida receives the highest density of lightning strikes within the United States. Several deaths per year are blamed on lightning, making lightning one of the deadliest weather-related phenomenon in the state. However, since 1992, the number of lightning deaths has been slowly dropping despite a rising population, suggesting that lightning awareness programs are effective. The most likely targets of lightning strikes are construction workers and others who work outside, though 12 percent of the cases occurred indoors to people using electronic devices. Severe thunderstorms can sometimes produce hail, very strong straight line winds and tornadoes. Very heavy rainfall from thunderstorms can result in flash flooding. Thunderstorms occur most often during the summer but can occur at any time of the year. = Tornadoes = There are more tornadoes per square mile in Florida than any other state.Average Annual Number of Tornadoes, 1991-2010.

From National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration However, these tornadoes tend to be much weaker and short-lived than in other states like the Midwest or Great Plains. Strong tornadoes do occasionally form in Florida, usually in conjunction with a cold frontal passage in the winter or spring. A total of 42 people died in February 1998 from the deadliest such tornado outbreak in Central Florida, which occurred during the nighttime hours. While tornadoes in the Midwest are more severe, a higher rate of deaths are experienced in Florida, and Brevard County, specifically, due to higher population density and quantity of manufactured homes.  Tropical cyclones  Hurricane Wilma (2005) The earliest in the year a tropical cyclone has struck the sunshine state was the Groundhog Day Tropical Storm in 1952. The latest impact was from a hurricane which struck near Tampa on December 1, 1925. The strongest hurricane to strike Florida was the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. Hurricane Easy in 1950 produced the wettest known point total from any tropical cyclone. The record number of hurricane strikes on the state in one season is four in 2004.National Hurricane Center. Atlantic Tracks File 1851-2006. Retrieved on June 2, 2007. Hurricanes typically spawn tornadoes within their northeast quadrant. Tropical cyclones have affected Florida in every month of the year but March. Nearly one-third of the cyclones affected the state in September, and nearly three-fourths of the storms affected the state between August and October, which coincides with the peak of the hurricane season. Portions of the coastline have the lowest return period, or the frequency at which a certain intensity or category of hurricane can be expected within of a given location, in the country. Monroe County was struck by 26 hurricanes since 1926, which is the greatest total for any county in the United States.  Effect of climate cycles  El Ni√±o has the following effects on Florida climate: above average rainfall in the spring. This is followed by wildfire threat when rain dries up. Northern Florida is more susceptible to severe weather; below normal temperatures, increased number of low pressure systems in the Gulf of Mexico during the winter, and \\"almost always\\" reduces the frequency of storms and hurricanes.Florida Disaster Management accessed March 9, 2008 La Ni√±a has the following effects: often dry conditions prevail in late fall, winter and early spring, increased risk of wildfires in spring and summer months, the temperatures average slightly above normal, and the chance of hurricane activity increases substantially. Long term forecasts are made based on these effects. However, they are easily overridden, in winter, by the Arctic oscillation and North Atlantic oscillations, which can only be predicted about two weeks in advance. These can drop the temperature noticeably from seasonal norms.  Climates of selected Florida cities  The climate regime for much of the state is humid subtropical (K√∂ppen Cfa), though portions of the Gold Coast of southeast Florida, as well as all of the Florida Keys, qualify as tropical wet-and-dry (K√∂ppen Aw). A narrow eastern part of the state including Orlando and Jacksonville receives between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of sunshine annually. The rest of the state, including Miami, receives between 2,800 and 3,200 hours annually.

Hosts and symptoms Mycocentrospora acerina has a wide host range effecting vegetables, ornamentals and weeds.Hermansen, Arne. \\"Weeds as Hosts of Mycocentrospora Acerina.\\" Norwegian Plant Protection Institute, Department of Plant Pathology, Fellesbygget, N-1432 Aas, Norway Accepted 15 August 1992.

Mycocentrospora acerina causes an important post-harvest disease named \\"liquorice rot\\" in carrots which have been the most studied host. During the growing stage of carrots, the pathogen can cause damping-off and death of seedlings, stunting, early senescence, and leaf lesions that are brown necrotic flecks. Once the carrots are in storage the liquorice rot occurs where root lesions appear that are black in color.Wall, Catherine J, and B.G. Lewis. \\"Infection of Carrot Plants by Mycocentrospora Acerina.\\" Transactions of the British Mycological Society, , Vol: 74, Issue: 3, Page: 587-593 Publication Year: 1980, Elsevier BV. Disease cycle Mycocentrospora acerina is a deuteromycete (no sexual stage) soil-bourne fungus that is a root inhabitant.Hermansen, Arne, et al. \\"Variations in Infection by Mycocentrospora Acerina in Carrot Monoculture Plots at Four Sites during 1985-1995.\\" Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica: Section B, Soil & Plant Science, vol. 49, no. 4, Dec. 1999, pp. 248‚Äì257. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1080/090647100750001622. The life cycle starts and ends with the chlamydospore. The chlamydospore is a thick walled, dark pigmented resting spore that overwinters in the soil or plant debris and can stay dormant for several years without losing viability. It will only germinate in the soil when it senses a host root nearby or when conditions are right when it is on the surface. In the soil it will produce germ tubes and mycelial growth that will infect the root through a wound and begin producing more chlamydospores. On the surface the chlamydospore will produce a short germ tube with terminal conidia attached that will disperse through water and infect a leaf. The leaf infection will create a lesion where conidiophores will produce conidia.Wall, Catherine J, and B.G. Lewis. \\"Survival of Mycocentrospora Acerina Conidia.\\" Transactions of the British Mycological Society, , Vol: 70, Issue: 1, Page: 157-160 Publication Year: 1978, Elsevier BV . The conidia will then be dispersed through rain splash and infect other leaves.Wall, Catherine J, and B.G. Lewis. \\"Infection of Carrot Leaves by Mycocentrospora Acerina.\\" Transactions of the British Mycological Society, , Vol: 75, Issue: 1, Page: 163-165 Publication Year: 1980, Elsevier BV. Some conidia that end up in the soil will convert into chlamydospores for survival. Environment Mycocentrospora acerina is found in temperate climates and grows best at 18 degrees Celsius (65 degrees Fahrenheit). The temperate climate leads to long refrigeration time for the carrots that induces the storage rot.Davies, W.P., and B.G. Lewis. \\"Behaviour of Mycocentrospora Acerina on Periderm and Wounded Tissues of Carrot Roots.\\" Transactions of the British Mycological Society, , Vol: 77, Issue: 2, Page: 369-374 Publication Year: 1981, Elsevier BV. Rainfall is needed to induce sporulation and dispersal of conidia. The pathogen has a greater impact in sandy soils and this is hypothesized to be that the host roots take more wounds in sandy soils and that there is less microflora to buffer the pathogen. Growing hosts plants in rotation allows for the buildup of chlamydospores in the soil from infected plant litter, allowing for greater disease rates over time.

In culture it produces 0.3‚Äì0.627 micrograms of helvolic acid and 0.9‚Äì4.8 micrograms of cerulenin per milliliter of culture medium. The level of helvolic acid correlated with a higher incidence of sheath rot disease. Rice grains from infected plants were found to contain 2.2 micrograms helvolic acid and 1.75 micrograms of cerulein per gram of infected seeds, which induce chlorosis and reduce the seed viability and seedling health. S. oryzae has also been known as Acrocylindrium oryzae (Sawada). For forty years prior to 2005, a common industrial fungal strain used to manufacture cerulenin was known under the invalidly published designation \\"Cephalosporium caerulens\\", but an isolate of the original C. caerulens strain KF-140 was subsequently shown to be conspecific with S. oryzae. The disease is found in rice plants usually injured by insects or other diseases. Hot (20-28¬∞C) and humid (wet) weather favour the growth of the disease. It is also associated with virus- infected plants.  Symptoms  Early symptoms are oblong to irregular spots, with gray centers and brown margins. Spots or rotting occur on the leaf sheath that encloses the young panicles. There is discoloration in the sheath. In severe infection, all or part of the young panicles do not emerge and remain within the sheath. Unemerged panicles will soon rot and produce powdery fungus growth inside the leaf sheath. Infection occurs on the uppermost leaf sheath at all stages, but is most damaging when it occurs at late booting stage.  Management  Partners of the CABI-led programme, Plantwise including the General Directorate of Agriculture in Cambodia have suggested reducing density of planted crops 25x25cm and removing infected stubbles and weeds from the field. They also recommend application of fertilisers including potassium, calcium sulphate and zinc sulphate during the tillering stage to strengthen the stem and leaf tissues. The Bureau of rice research and development in Thailand recommend using disease-free seeds and plant and avoid mono-rice variety and plant at least two varieties in the same field and regular monitoring of fields.

Tested in two different configurations, it provided the proof of concept that a fin-stabilised ballistic missile was technologically feasible, and led to the development of the Corporal ballistic missile. The Private was the second in a series of JPL rockets for the US Army whose names correspond to the progression in Army enlisted ranks, starting with Private and led to WAC Corporal, Corporal E, Corporal and finally Sergeant. History The Private program was begun in 1944 as an outgrowth of work by the California Institute of Technology's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory that had produced the first practical jet- assisted take-off (JATO) rockets. The ORDCIT (Ordinance Department California Institute of Technology) project was the Private A whcih initiated on May 24, 1944. The Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (GALCIT) was reorganized as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The objective was to progressivly the size and range of missiles A GALCIT JATO rocket motor was used for research into the development of ballistic missiles. The first flight of the Private A rocket, developed under the direction of Tsien Hsue-shen, took place in December 1944, conducted at Camp Irwin in California. Private A (XF10S1000) was an unguided, fin-stabilised ballistic rocket; it consisted of a JATO unit equipped with cruciform tail fins, and a set of four T22 booster rockets that were jettisoned after launch. This made Private A the first multistage rocket to be flown in the United States. The gross weight of PrivateA was 500 pounds. 24 launches of Private A were conducted at Leach Springs, Camp Irwin between December 1 and December 16, 1944. The tests were considered successful, Private A proving capable of flights of , and in January 1945 full funding for the ballistic missile program was provided, with GALCIT changing its name to Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A new version of Private, Private F, was developed; the rocket was similar to Private A, except an aircraft-like tail assembly was fitted instead of Private A's cruciform fins with forward canard surfaces.. The purpose of Private F was to determine the behavior of rockets with wings. Private F was flown from a launcher adjustable in elevation. There were a number of configurations tested though they all were of the same basic configuration. A test series of Private F launches was conducted at Hueco Range, Fort Bliss in Texas between April 1 and April 13 in 1945; These tests included two with dummy Private F bodies with only the boosters live. The Private F had the propellant charge reduced from 191 pounds to 175 pounds to allow a 20 pound slow burning charge to provide tracking after engine burnout. 17 launches were conducted, however none of them were successful, the rocket proving to have serious stability problems; Every one of them rolled within seconds of launch. It was determined that while fin stabilisation was workable, a winged missile would require an autopilot. Following the conclusion of the Private program, the lessons learned were applied to the development of the SSM-A-17 Corporal ballistic missile.

Plant Disease. 2009. 93:1202-1208 As the common name suggests, it is not a true smut (fungus), but an ascomycete. False smut does not replace all or part of the kernel with a mass of black spores, rather sori form erupting through the palea and lemma forming a ball of mycelia, the outermost layers are spore- producing.Webster, R. K. and Gunnell, P. S. 1992. Compendium of rice diseases. American Phytopathological Society, St. Paul, MN Infected rice kernels are always destroyed by the disease. Of particular concern are the production of alkaloids in the grain as with the Claviceps spp. causing ergot Disease Cycle U. virens has a peculiar life cycle. White hyphae are produced by the fungi after initial infection of the floral organs of the rice crop. As the infection matures with time, darker brownish green chlamydospores are produced on the rice spikelets. Additionally, sclerotia can be present towards the end of the fall season. During its life cycle, U. virens undergoes a sexual (ascospores) stage as well as an asexual (chlamydospores) stage. The chlamydospores are the main survival structure, and they can live in the soil for up to four months. The additional formation of sclerotia allows U. virens to survive even longer, almost up to a year. These sclerotia, which can be present either on or below the surface of the soil, mature to form an ascocarp (fruiting body). The ascospores from these fruiting bodies act as the primary source of infection to spread disease throughout the paddy field. Infection The rice false smut pathogen, Ustilaginoidea virens, invades through small gap at the apex of a rice spikelet before heading. The primary source of infection is the presence of chlamydospores in the soil (Ikegami, 1963). During the vegetative stage of the growth of the rice crop, the fungus colonizes the tissue on the growing points on the tillers (Ikegami, 1963). This happens when conidia get deposited on the spikelets of the rice crop, which later lead to the growth of hyphae. The mycelia from these hyphae invade the floral organs in the spikelets. Disease control The rice false smut pathogen causes mostly qualitative damage to the rice crop. Removal of the brown ‚Äúsmut balls‚Äù is important to maintain the visual integrity of the harvested crop. Additionally, certain steps can be taken to manage and/ or prevent the onset of disease. Most rice varieties are susceptible to the disease; however, some cultivars of rice provide a small amount of resistance against U. virens (Cartwright, 2002). Planting rice earlier in the season can also reduce the amount of disease caused by false smut. In some studies, rice planted in April showed much less presence of false smut than rice planted after the 15th of May. As is the case for most rice diseases, large amounts of fertilizer in the soil lead to increase in disease (Cartwright, 2002). Maintaining the nitrogen rate in the soil to a level below 160 pounds per acre has proven to be most efficient against stopping disease (Cartwright, 2002). Although there are no specific fungicide recommendations for the eradication of the false smut pathogen of rice, Cartwright reported that propiconazole was the most effective ingredient after studying it for over three years.

Summary  Sylvester does a wild musical number in Elmer's back yard inspired by Spike Jones. Elmer is ready for bedtime, but Sylvester has other plans as he starts singing in Elmer's back yard. A series of gags play out, as Elmer tries everything up his sleeve to get rid of that unwanted pest. Elmer eventually confronts Sylvester, but before Elmer can blast him with his shotgun, Sylvester sings a sweet, gentle lullaby to ease him into a deep sleep. However, this doesn't last, and the insanity continues. Elmer eventually dies from explosives from his attempts to get rid of Sylvester. His spirit ends up in Heaven, on a cloud ascending into space. Momentarily, he thinks he will finally get some peace and quiet.

Of the 62 passengers and 10 crew, only 8 passengers survived. An American Broadcasting Company news vice-president who had been touring the network's Asian bureau was among the 64 fatalities.  Course of events  The aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-8-43, registration c/n 45761/237, delivered to the airline on October 14, 1965. Flight 402 was a Hong Kong to Tokyo to Vancouver flight, which took off at 16:14 Japan Time from Kai Tak International Airport on the first leg of the journey. The flight was in a holding pattern for almost one hour, waiting for visibility at the destination to improve from landing minima. The tower controller cleared the flight for an instrument approach when visibility improved, but the crew had to abort the approach when visibility dropped again. At 20:05 local time, the pilot radioed the control tower that he was diverting to Taiwan, and was told the visibility at the airport had increased above minimums again to five-eighths of a mile. The pilot then decided to make another approach before diverting. The ground- controlled approach was normal until the aircraft was seen on the precision approach radar suddenly descending below the glide slope. At from the runway threshold, the aircraft's landing gear struck part of the approach lighting system. The pilot lost control of the aircraft as it hit several more obstructions, including the seawall at the runway threshold, leaving a half mile long trail of burning wreckage on the airfield.  Investigation  The Japanese government-appointed investigation team concluded in their report, issued two years later, that there was no fault in the airport's control tower. They stated the cause was pilot error, while acknowledging that poor visibility could have caused an optical illusion that confused the pilot. The probable cause statement was that the \\"Pilot misjudged landing approach under unusually difficult weather conditions.\\"  Crashes in Japan  This accident was one of five fatal aircraft disasters‚Äîfour commercial and one military‚Äîin Japan in 1966. Less than 24 hours later, BOAC Flight 911, a Boeing 707, taxied past the still smoldering wreckage of the DC-8, then broke up in flight shortly after departure when it encountered extreme clear-air turbulence in the lee of Mount Fuji while flying the opposite direction towards Hong Kong, killing all 124 passengers and crew. This brought the total death toll from both accidents in the Tokyo area to 188, then a record for a 24-hour period. Less than a month before, All Nippon Airways Flight 60, a Boeing 727, crashed into Tokyo Bay while on approach to land at the same airport, killing all 133 aboard. In addition, two other incidents occurred, on August 26 and November 13. The combined effect of these five accidents shook public confidence in commercial aviation in Japan, and both Japan Air Lines and All Nippon Airways were forced to cut back some domestic service due to reduced demand.

Mormon cosmology is the description of the history, evolution, and destiny of the physical and metaphysical universe according to Mormonism, which includes the doctrines taught by leaders and theologians of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Mormon fundamentalism, the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ, and other Brighamite denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement. Mormon cosmology draws from Biblical cosmology, but has many unique elements provided by movement founder Joseph Smith. These views are not generally shared by adherents of other Latter Day Saint movement denominations who do not self-identify as \\"Mormons\\", such as the Community of Christ. According to Mormon cosmology, there was a pre-existence, or a pre-mortal life, in which human spirits were literal children of heavenly parents. (\\"Each [human] is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents.\\"); (\\"Man, as a spirit, was begotten and born of heavenly parents, and reared to maturity in the eternal mansions of the Father.\\"). Although their spirits were created, the essential \\"intelligence\\" of these spirits is considered eternal, and without beginning. During this pre-mortal life, a Plan of Salvation was presented by God the Father (Elohim) with Jehovah (the premortal Jesus) championing moral agency but Lucifer (Satan) insisting on its exclusion. When Lucifer's plan was not accepted, he rebelled against God the Father and was cast out of heaven, taking \\"the third part\\" of the hosts of heaven with him to the earth, thus becoming the tempters. According to the Plan of Salvation, under the direction of God the Father, Jehovah created the earth as a place where humanity would be tested. After the resurrection, all men and women‚Äîexcept the spirits that followed Lucifer and the sons of perdition‚Äîwould be assigned one of three degrees of glory. Within the highest degree, the celestial kingdom, there are three further divisions, and those in the highest of these celestial divisions would become gods and goddesses through a process called \\"exaltation\\" or \\"eternal progression\\". The doctrine of eternal progression was succinctly summarized by LDS Church leader Lorenzo Snow: \\"As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.\\" According to Smith's King Follett discourse, God the Father once passed through mortality as Jesus did, but how, when, or where that took place is unclear. The prevailing view among Mormons is that God once lived on a planet with his own higher god.. According to Mormon scripture, the Earth's creation was not ex nihilo, but organized from existing matter. The Earth is just one of many inhabited worlds, and there are many governing heavenly bodies, including the planet or star Kolob, which is said to be nearest the throne of God. Divinity In Mormonism, the concept of divinity centers around an idea of \\"exaltation\\" and \\"eternal progression\\": mortals themselves may become gods and goddesses in the afterlife, be rulers of their own heavenly kingdoms, have spirit children, and increase in power and glory forever. Mormons understand that there is a Heavenly Mother.\\"Mother in Heaven\\", churchofjesuschrist.org, accessed 16 April 2016. However, the three persons of Godhead (God the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost) are to be the only objects of worship. =Exaltation and eternal progression= In LDS doctrine, the goal of each adherent is to receive \\"exaltation\\" through the atonement of Jesus. If a person receives exaltation, they inherit all the attributes of God the Father, including godhood. Mormons believe that these people will become gods and goddesses in the afterlife, and will have \\"all power, glory, dominion, and knowledge\\".. Mormons teach that exalted people will live with their earthly families and will also \\"have spirit children\\": their posterity will grow forever. According to the belief, exaltation is available only to those who have earned the highest \\"degree\\" of the celestial kingdom.; . As prerequisites for this \\"greatest gift of God\\",Doctrine and Covenants adherents believe that either in this life or the afterlife, they must become \\"perfect\\" and they must participate in all the required ordinances. Though not necessary, their exaltation can be \\"sealed upon them\\" by the Holy Ghost via the second anointing ordinance. One of the key qualifications for exaltation is being united in a celestial marriage to an opposite-sex partner via the ordinance of sealing,Doctrine and Covenants 131:1‚Äì3. either in person or by proxy after they have died. In the 19th century, some leaders of the LDS Church taught that participation in plural marriage was also a requirement of exaltation.See, e.g.: , at 268-269; , at pp. 28‚Äì31. The LDS Church abandoned the practice beginning in 1890 and now teaches that only a single celestial marriage is required for exaltation. (exaltation \\"is available to be received by a man and wife\\"). =Origin of Elohim (God the Father)= According to Mormon theology, God the Father is a physical being of \\"flesh and bones.\\"Doctrine and Covenants Mormons identify him as the biblical god Elohim. Latter-day Saint leaders have also taught that God the Father was once a mortal man who has completed the process of becoming an exalted being.. . . . . . According to Joseph Smith, God \\"once was a man like one of us and ‚Ä¶ once dwelled on an earth the same as Jesus Christ himself did in the flesh and like us.\\". =Origin of Jehovah (Jesus)= According to Mormon belief, Jesus is identified as the god Jehovah, the YHWH of the Old Testament. Jehovah received a body when he was born to the Virgin Mary and was named Jesus. Jesus was the Son of God‚Äîthe father of his physical body was God the Father.Ezra Taft Benson, \\"Five Marks of the Divinity of Jesus Christ,\\" New Era, December 1980, p. 44; reprinted in Ensign, December 2001, p. 8. Because Jesus was the Son of God, he had power to overcome physical death.John 10:17‚Äì18. Because he lived a perfect and sinless life, Jesus could offer himself as an \\"infinite and eternal\\" sacrifice that would be required to pay for the sins of all of the other children of God.Alma 34:10‚Äì12. =Adam/Michael, under the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine= According to Brigham Young and the endowment ceremony, Adam was identified as the biblical archangel Michael prior to his placement in the Garden of Eden. While the identity of Adam as Michael is accepted by the LDS Church, the pre-existent godhood of Adam/Michael is now repudiated by the LDS Church, but it is accepted by some adherents of Mormon fundamentalism. According to this interpretation of Young's teachings, Michael was a god who had received his exaltation. He took Eve, one of his wives, to the Garden,. where they became mortal by eating the fruit in the garden.. Although the LDS Church has repudiated the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine, the denomination's endowment ceremony portrays this Adam/Michael as a participant with Jehovah in the creation of the earth, under the direction of Elohim. =Heavenly Mother and the Holy Ghost= The official doctrine of the LDS Church includes the existence of \\"heavenly parents\\", which is generally understood to refer to the goddess Heavenly Mother, who exists alongside God the Father and is his wife.Wilcox, Linda P., \\"The Mormon Concept of a Mother in Heaven\\", Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective, edited by Maureen Ursenbach Beecher and Lavina Fielding Anderson (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1987), pp. 64‚Äì77. God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost are recognized as the three constituent entities of the Godhead.. The Holy Ghost has a spirit body, in contrast with the Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, who have physical celestial bodies.Doctrine and Covenants 130:22. Other worlds and extraterrestrial life Mormon cosmology teaches that the Earth is not unique, but that it is one of many inhabited planets, each planet created for the purpose of bringing about the \\"immortality and eternal life\\" (i.e., the exaltation) of humanity. (citing ). These worlds were, according to doctrine, created by Jehovah, the pre-mortal Jesus.Book of Moses 1:29‚Äì34. Because Mormonism holds that Jesus created the universe, yet his father, God the Father, once dwelt upon an earth as a mortal, it may be interpreted that Mormonism teaches the existence of a multiverse, and it is not clear if the other inhabited worlds mentioned in Mormon scripture and teachings refers to planets within this universe or not.Kirk D. Hagen, \\"Eternal Progression in a Multiverse: An Explorative Mormon Cosmology\\", Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought, vol. 39, no. 2 (Summer 2006) pp. 1‚Äì45. Mormon leaders and theologians have taught that these inhabitants are similar or identical to humans, and that they too are subject to the atonement of Jesus.D&C; 76:24. The earth that God the Father dwelt on as a mortal was not, however, created by Jehovah or subject to his atonement, but existed previously. The doctrine of other worlds is found in Mormon scripture, in the endowment ceremony, and in the teachings of Joseph Smith. In addition, many LDS Church leaders and theologians have elaborated on these principles through exegesis or speculation, and many of these ideas are widely accepted among Mormons. =Official sources= According to a revelation dictated by Joseph Smith, Jesus is the creator of many worlds, so \\"that by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.\\" Smith's translation of the Bible also refers to \\"many worlds\\", and states that the vision Moses had on biblical Mount Sinai was limited to \\"only account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, [but] there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power[, a]nd there are many that now stand.\\"Book of Moses 1:35. Another part of Smith's translation portrays the biblical character Enoch as stating that if there were \\"millions of earths like this [earth], it would not be a beginning to the number of [God's] creations; and [his] curtains are stretched out still.\\"Book of Moses 7:30. Finally, the portion of the LDS Church's endowment ceremony depicting the creation of the world refers repeatedly to \\"worlds heretofore created\\". In the portrayal of the Garden of Eden story during the endowment, after Lucifer has tempted Eve to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, God the Father asks Lucifer what he is doing, and Lucifer replies \\"that which has been done on other worlds\\". =Noncanonical statements by church leaders= Alleged statements of early church leaders Some individual Latter-day Saints have espoused opinions that demonstrate their personal beliefs on the subject of other life in the universe. According to Latter-day Saint Oliver B. Huntington, Joseph Smith said there was life on the Moon; Huntington also reported that he was promised in a patriarchal blessing given to him by Joseph Smith Sr. that he would preach the gospel to inhabitants of the Moon.O. B. Huntington, \\"Our Sunday Chapter: The Inhabitants of the Moon\\", Young Woman's Journal 3:263‚Äì64 (March 1892). LDS researchers John A. Tvedtnes and Van Hale have expressed doubt about the reliability of Huntington's claims. Regarding the first, it is likely that Huntington was repeating a description provided by another Latter-day Saint, Philo Dibble. (Huntington was still a child when Smith died.) It is unclear what Dibble's source for the statement is, because Dibble did not indicate whether the recollection was his own or something he had heard from another person. The alleged teaching was first recorded by Huntington in a journal entry after he heard it from Dibble about 40 years after Smith's death.John A. Tvedtnes, \\"Nature of Prophets and Prophecy\\", Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research. Regarding Huntington's second claim, the official LDS Church's record of the blessing indicates that it was given to Huntington by his father, William Huntington, not by Joseph Smith Sr. The extract from the blessing suggests a more plausible rationale, in that the events could occur at some time in the future or after mortality. Hence: \\"thou shalt have power with God even to translate thyself to Heaven, & preach to the inhabitants of the moon or planets, if it shall be expedient\\".Mormons and Moonmen, Van Hale, p. 14, Sunstone. There are no contemporary reports, records, or any other written support of Smith's alleged views or statements on extraterrestrials, nor are there any reports of statements other than the one claimed by Huntington, which is unverified and therefore possibly unreliable. Tvedtnes and James B. Allen have pointed out that, unlike many of Smith's statements, there is no indication that Smith claimed that any such alleged opinions on extraterrestrials was revealed to him by God nor that Smith was speaking under any prophetic authority. In a statement given on July 24, 1870, LDS Church president Brigham Young discussed the possibility that the Sun and the Moon were inhabited, but said these were his own personal thoughts.Journal of Discourses 13:271. In response to a claim of his being ignorant on the matter, Young agreed, asking, \\"Are not [we] all ignorant [about these matters]?\\" Various writings about Young's statement acknowledge that these were personal beliefs he held and that such beliefs were common in the 19th century and were even considered \\"scientific fact\\" by many at the time. For example, William Herschel, the discoverer of the planet Uranus, argued, \\"[w]ho can say that it is not extremely probable, nay beyond doubt, that there must be inhabitants on the Moon of some kind or another?\\" Historians have said that Herschel \\"thought it possible that there was a region below the Sun's fiery surface where men might live, and he regarded the existence of life on the Moon as 'an absolute certainty.'\\"Patrick Moore, New Guide to the Moon (W.W. Norton & Company, New York: 1976), cited by In any event, Young's personal beliefs on the subject of \\"inhabited worlds\\" are not considered LDS Church doctrine.  Modern leaders  Some modern LDS Church leaders have taught that people live on other earths. For instance, apostle Joseph Fielding Smith (1876‚Äì1972) wrote: > We are not the only people that the Lord has created. We have brothers and > sisters on other earths. They look like us because they, too, are the > children of God and were created in his image, for they are also his > offspring.Joseph Fielding Smith, Doctrines of Salvation 1:62, 1999, and > the great universe of stars has multiplied beyond the comprehension of men. > Evidently each of these great systems is governed by divine law; with divine > presiding Gods, for it would be unreasonable to assume that each was not so > governed.Joseph Fielding Smith, Answers to Gospel Questions 2:144, 1980, Apostle Neal A. Maxwell (1926‚Äì2004) wrote, \\"we do not know how many inhabited worlds there are, or where they are. But certainly we are not alone.\\" Mormon metaphysics Mormon scripture and the teachings of Joseph Smith include a number of details concerning the nature of light, elements, matter, \\"spirit matter\\", and intelligence. According to Mormon scripture, \\"the elements are eternal\\".Doctrine and Covenants 93:33. This means, according to Smith, that the elements are co-existent with God, and \\"they may be organized and reorganized, but not destroyed. They had not beginning, and can have no end.\\"The Contributor, vol. 4, p. 257 (Joseph Smith, April 1844 sermon). This principle was elaborated on by Brigham Young, who said, \\"God never made something out of nothing; it is not in the economy or law of which the worlds were, are, or will exist.\\"Journal of Discourses 14:116 Thus, Mormons deny ex nihilo creation and instead believe that God created or \\"organized\\" the universe out of pre-existing elements. Along with physical matter, Mormons believe that spirit \\"intelligences\\" have existed co-eternally with God.Joseph Smith (Joseph Fielding Smith ed.). Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) pp. 353‚Äì54.Bruce R. McConkie (1966). Mormon Doctrine (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) p. 387. Mormons believe in a universe and a God governed by physical law, in which all miracles, including acts of God, have a natural explanation, though science does not yet have the tools or means necessary to explain them.. Pre-mortality =Spirit intelligences and God's spirit children= It is believed there were pre- existing \\"spirit intelligences\\" that existed before the God the Father and Heavenly Mother created spiritual bodies for them: \\"self-existing intelligences were organized into individual spirit beings\\"Marion G. Romney, \\"The Worth of Souls,\\" Ensign, November 1978, p. 13. by the Heavenly Parents and they became the \\"begotten sons and daughters of God\\".Doctrine and Covenants 76:24. The procreative process whereby the intelligences became spirits has not been explained. While spirit bodies are composed of matter, they are described as being \\"more fine or pure\\" than regular matter.Doctrine and Covenants 131:7‚Äì8. The first-born spirit child of God the Father was Jehovah, whom Latter-day Saints identify as the premortal Jesus.Doctrine and Covenants 93:21.Joseph F. Smith. Gospel Doctrine (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 70.. Jehovah was a GodEzra Taft Benson, \\"Joy in Christ,\\" Ensign, March 1986, p. 3. and was like God the Father in attributes,John 14:6‚Äì9. but he did not have an immortal physical body like God the Father until his resurrection.Ether 3:14‚Äì17. =Council in Heaven= God the Father's plan for all his children was to provide a way for them to become more like him. Although they were happy living in heaven with God the Father, God's spirit children could not experience the \\"fulness of joy\\" enjoyed by him unless their spirit bodies were joined with a physical body.Doctrine and Covenants 93:33‚Äì34. God the Father convened a \\"Grand Council\\" of all his children to propose a plan of progression, known to Latter-day Saints as the plan of salvation.Joseph Smith (Joseph Fielding Smith ed.). Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 348‚Äì49, 365. According to the proposed plan, God would provide an earth where spirit children could receive a physical body. One of the purposes of this earthly existence is for each of God's children to demonstrate through free will the desire to choose righteousness rather than evil. To facilitate free will decision-making, God would cause each spirit child to have no memory of their pre-earth life. All would be given trials and would fall short of perfection, but a savior would be provided, the acceptance of whom would lead ultimately to redemption and a return to live with God the Father forever. Jehovah volunteered to be the saviorAbraham 3:27.. and said, \\"Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.\\"Moses 4:2. Jehovah was \\"the only person who could be [the] Savior\\". =War in Heaven= Lucifer, another of the spirit sons of God the Father, also sought to be the chosen savior; however, he proposed that the free will of humankind be abrogated so that \\"all mankind\\" would be redeemed through compelled obedience.Moses 4:1, 3‚Äì4. Additionally, Lucifer proposed that all glory and honor (and consequently power)D&C; 29:36‚Äì38. be transferred from God the Father to himself. Lucifer's plan was rejected by God the Father, which caused Lucifer to be enraged and to attempt to overthrow God. The War in Heaven ensued whereby Lucifer and his followers fought against Jehovah and his followers. One-third of the spirit children of God chose to follow Lucifer. Lucifer and his followers were cast out of heaven by God the Father. Because of their rebellion, Lucifer and the spirits who followed him would not receive a physical body as specified in the plan of salvation. Lucifer is also known as Satan or the Devil. Satan and his spirit followers tempt people to make evil choices. Temporal creation and fall Following the War in Heaven, Jesus created the earth under the direction of God the Father. Since all matter is co-eternal with God, creation of the earth was not performed ex nihilo. Rather, God performed creation by organizing pre- existing matter.Stephen E. Robinson. \\"LDS Differences in Doctrine\\". The earth and everything on it were created spiritually by God before they were created physically.Moses 3:5. Jehovah used the priesthood to create the physical earth and everything in it as well as the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets.. Jehovah had assistance from other children of God, including the archangel Michael. God the Father and Jehovah together created the physical bodies of Adam and Eve, which were patterned after the physical body possessed by God. Michael's spirit was placed in the male body (Adam), and a spirit daughter of God was placed in the female body (Eve). Adam and Eve were placed in the Garden of Eden. Although they had physical bodies, they were not yet mortal.. God the Father commanded them to have children. He also told them that they could eat of any tree in the garden except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and that they would \\"surely die\\" if they ate of that tree.Moses 3:16‚Äì17. Satan tempted Adam and Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit. Eve yielded to temptation and ate the fruit; when she told Adam that she had eaten the fruit, Adam chose to eat also. As a result of their decision to eat the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve underwent the \\"fall\\". As God had promised, the bodies of Adam and Eve became mortal and they became subject to physical death, as well as sickness and pain. They also underwent \\"spiritual death\\": they were cast out of the Garden of Eden and separated from the presence of God. Due to the fall, Adam and Eve also came to know the difference between good and evil and became capable of having children, as God had originally commanded. As a direct result of the fall of Adam and Eve, all children of God who would be born into the world suffer physical death and spiritual death.. While physical death is the separation of the spirit from the body, spiritual death is the separation of a person from God. Spiritual death results from making sinful decisions between good and evil. Were it not for the atonement of Jesus Christ, physical death and spiritual death would both prevent God's children from returning to him with a physical body. Unlike some Christians, Latter-day Saints generally do not see the fall as a serious sin or as an overwhelmingly negative event. Rather, the fall is viewed as \\"a necessary step in the plan of life and a great blessing to all of us. Because of the Fall, we are blessed with physical bodies, the right to choose between good and evil, and the opportunity to gain eternal life. None of these privileges would have been ours had Adam and Eve remained in the garden.\\" Latter-day scripture reports that Adam and Eve later rejoiced that they had chosen to partake of the fruit,Moses 5:11. and the Book of Mormon teaches that the fall was necessary for humankind to exist and for them to experience joy, which is the ultimate purpose of existence.2 Nephi 2:22‚Äì25. The afterlife =Spirit world= If a person physically dies without being given the chance to accept the atonement of Jesus Christ on the earth, he or she will be given that chance as a spirit after death.. Necessary ordinances, such as baptism, can be vicariously performed on behalf of the person in LDS Church temples. =Resurrection= Mormons believe that Jesus guaranteed the physical resurrection of all humanity. They teach that when Jesus physically died on the cross, Jesus' suffering ended and his spirit left his physical body.Mark 15:37. On the third day after his death, Jesus' spirit returned to his physical body and he became the first child of God to be resurrected with a perfect and immortal physical body of flesh and bone. Because Jesus was resurrected, all children of God who ever lived on the earth will one day be resurrected.1 Corinthians 15:21‚Äì22.Alma 11:44. Thus, the spirit children of God will all receive immortal physical bodies of flesh and bone, and their spirits and their bodies will never again be separated.Alma 11:45. =Final Judgment and the degrees of glory= After an individual is resurrected, he or she will be judged by Jesus as part of the Final Judgment. There are three degrees or kingdoms of glory which are the ultimate, eternal dwelling places for nearly all who lived on earth; a degree of glory is assigned to the person at the Final Judgment. Joseph Smith provided a description of the afterlife based primarily upon an 1832 vision he reportedly received with Sidney Rigdon and recorded as Doctrine and Covenants section 76. According to this section of the vision, there are three degrees of glory, called the celestial kingdom, the terrestrial kingdom, and the telestial kingdom. The few who do not inherit any degree of glory‚Äîthough they will be resurrected‚Äîreside in a state called outer darkness, which, though not a degree of glory, is often discussed in this context. The ones who will go there are known as \\"sons of perdition\\"; sons of perdition are to dwell with Satan and his spirit followers. =Exaltation= In consequence of the atonement of Jesus Christ, a son or daughter of God the Father may overcome physical and spiritual death and return to live with God forever. Those individuals who receive this‚Äîwhich is described as the \\"greatest gift of God\\"‚Äîare said to enter into a state of \\"exaltation\\" after they are resurrected.. Exaltation is also called \\"salvation\\" or \\"eternal life\\".Some sources state that \\"salvation\\" refers only to the process of souls being freed from the bonds of Hell (also called \\"Spirit Prison\\"), or released from Paradise (also called \\"Spirit Paradise\\"), and the subsequent resurrection of said souls; while \\"exaltation\\" and \\"eternal life\\" refer to the state of living with God the Father and Jesus Christ in the \\"highest degree\\" of heaven. Exaltation consists of \\"the kind of life God lives\\". In other words, exalted beings will live in great glory, be perfect, and possess all knowledge and wisdom. Exalted beings will live forever with God the Father and Jesus Christ, will become gods and goddesses, will live with their righteous earthly family members, and will receive the fulness of joy enjoyed by God and Christ. One of the key qualifications for exaltation is being united in a celestial marriage to an opposite-sex partner. Such a union can be created during mortality, or it can be created after death by proxy marriages performed in temples. Those who are exalted are said to inhabit the \\"highest degree\\" of the celestial kingdom.Doctrine and Covenants 131:1‚Äì4.

Biography Princess Georgina was born on 24 October 1921, in Graz, Austria. She was the daughter of Count Ferdinand von Wilczek and Countess Norbertine \\"Nora\\" Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau. In 1923, when Georgina was just two years old, her mother died after gave birth to a stillborn child. She received her formal education in the Sacre Coeur high school, a private Catholic school in Vienna. She then studied art history and applied arts and later studied languages at the University of Vienna and graduated as an interpreter in English, French and Italian. Georgina probably met her future husband, Prince Franz Joseph II, in early 1942. He was also her third cousin, and he had been the reigning Prince of Liechtenstein since 1938. They had an age difference of 15 years, and their friendship eventually turned to love. Their engagement was announced on 30 December 1942. They were married on 7 March 1943 at the Cathedral of St. Florin in Vaduz. It was the first time that the wedding of a ruling Prince had taken place in Liechtenstein. During the following weeks, the newlyweds visited all eleven communes of Liechtenstein. The couple had five children: * Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein (born 1945). Married Countess Marie Agla√´ von Wchinitz und Tettau and has issue. * Prince Philipp of Liechtenstein (born 1946). Married Isabelle de l'Arbre de Malander (b. 1949) and has issue. * Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein (born 1947). Married Princess Margaretha of Luxembourg (b. 1957), daughter of Grand Duke Jean, and has issue. * Princess Norberta of Liechtenstein (born 1950), popularly known as Princess Nora. Married Vicente Sartorius y Cabeza de Vaca, 3rd Marqu√©s de Mari√±o, and has issue. * Prince Franz Josef of Liechtenstein (Zurich, 19 November 1962 ‚Äì Vaduz, 28 February 1991), popularly known as Prince Wenzel. During World War II, Princess Georgina had concerns for prisoners of war and travelling by bicycle when the country suffered a gasoline shortage. When the war ended, Princess Georgina helping the refugees by making soup and bathe children on the national border at Schaanwald. On 22 June 1945, she founded the Liechtenstein Red Cross, and was president from 1945 to 1984, when she handed over the position over to her daughter-in-law Princess Marie. Beside from her numerous charitable and social activities, Princess Gina was also committed to a number of political issues including the introduction of women‚Äôs suffrage in Liechtenstein. In 1976, Princess Gina's father permitted the publication titled Russisches Tagebuch: 1916-1918 (English: Russian Diaries: 1916-1918) about his late wife's diaries written during her time in Siberia. Princess Gina contributed the foreword to the publication. Princess Georgina also assisted Gamander children's home and educational institution for mentally challenged children. She also served as President of the Society for Orthopedic Aid, and helped organize home care system for Liechtenstein's elderly residents. In her later years, Princess Gina organized delivery of food aid during the famine in Ethiopia. In 1987, the Princess was awarded the Henry Dunant Medal by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Her last public appearance was on 29 July 1989 at the wedding of Prince Gundakar of Liechtenstein to Princess Marie of Orl√©ans. Princess Georgina died on 18 October 1989, in a hospital in Grabs, Switzerland, six days before her 68th birthday shortly after receiving her last sacraments. She had been hospitalized for an undisclosed illness leading up to her death. Her husband, who was also in poor health, collapsed at her bed and died 26 days later. They are now buried together in the Cathedral of St. Florin in Vaduz. Princess Gina Trail was named in honour the Princess memory.

The works encompassed are from Giotto in the early 14th century to Michelangelo's Last Judgement of the 1530s. The themes that preoccupied painters of the Italian Renaissance were those of both subject matter and execution ‚Äì what was painted and the style in which it was painted. The artist had far more freedom of both subject and style than did a Medieval painter. Certain characteristic elements of Renaissance painting evolved a great deal during the period. These include perspective, both in terms of how it was achieved and the effect to which it was applied, and realism, particularly in the depiction of humanity, either as symbolic, portrait or narrative element. Themes The Flagellation of Christ by Piero della Francesca (above) demonstrates in a single small work many of the themes of Italian Renaissance painting, both in terms of compositional elements and subject matter. Immediately apparent is Piero's mastery of perspective and light. The architectural elements, including the tiled floor which becomes more complex around the central action, combine to create two spaces. The inner space is lit by an unseen light source to which Jesus looks. Its exact location can be pinpointed mathematically by an analysis of the diffusion and the angle of the shadows on the coffered ceiling. The three figures who are standing outside are lit from a different angle, from both daylight and light reflected from the pavement and buildings. The religious theme is tied to the present. The ruler is a portrait of the visiting Emperor of Byzantium.John VIII Palaeologus Flagellation is also called \\"scourging\\". The term \\"scourge\\" was applied to the plague. Outside stand three men representing those who buried the body of Christ. The two older, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea, are believed to be portraits of men who recently lost their sons, one of them to plague. The third man is the young disciple John, and is perhaps a portrait of one of the sons, or else represents both of them in a single idealised figure, coinciding with the manner in which Piero painted angels. Elements of Renaissance painting Renaissance painting differed from the painting of the Late Medieval period in its emphasis upon the close observation of nature, particularly with regards to human anatomy, and the application of scientific principles to the use of perspective and light. =Linear perspective= Primarily through architecture, Renaissance artists were able to practice the art of three-dimensional illusion using linear perspective, which gave their works a greater sense of depth. The pictures in the gallery below show the development of linear perspective in buildings and cityscapes. * In Giotto's fresco, the building is like a stage set with one side open to the viewer. * In Paolo Uccello's fresco, the townscape gives an impression of depth. * Masaccio's Holy Trinity was painted with carefully calculated mathematical proportions, in which he was probably assisted by the architect Brunelleschi. * Fra Angelico uses the simple motif of a small loggia accurately drafted to create an intimate space. * Gentile Bellini has painted a vast space, the Piazza San Marco in Venice, in which the receding figures add to the sense of perspective. * Leonardo da Vinci did detailed and measured drawings of the background Classical ruins preparatory to commencing the unfinished Adoration of the Magi. * Domenico Ghirlandaio created an exceptionally complex and expansive setting on three levels, including a steeply descending ramp and a jutting wall. Elements of the landscape, such as the church on the right, are viewed partly through other structures. * Raphael's design for Fire in the Borgo shows buildings around a small square in which the background events are highlighted by the perspective.

Also through this influence came an awareness of atmospheric perspective and the observation of the way distant things are affected by light. * Giotto uses a few rocks to give the impression of a mountain setting. * Paolo Uccello has created a detailed and surreal setting as a stage for many small scenes. * In Carpaccio's Deposition of the Body of Christ, the desolate rocky landscape echoes the tragedy of the scene. * Mantegna's landscape has a sculptural, three-dimensional quality that is suggestive of a real physical space. The details of the rocks, their strata and fractures, suggest that he studied the geological formations of the red limestone prevalent in areas of Northern Italy. * Antonello da Messina sets the grim scene of the Crucifixion in contrast to the placid countryside which rolls into the far distance, becoming paler and bluer as it recedes. * Giovanni Bellini has created a detailed landscape with a pastoral scene between the foreground and background mountains. There are numerous levels in this landscape, making it the equivalent of Ghirlandaio's complex cityscape (above). * Perugino has set the Adoration of the Magi against the familiar hilly landscape of Umbria. * Leonardo da Vinci, displays a theatrical use of atmospheric perspective in his view of the precipitous mountains around Lago di Garda at the foothills of the Alps in Northern Italy.

Tone is simply the lightness and darkness of areas of a picture, graded from white to black. Tonal arrangement is a very significant feature of some paintings. Chiaroscuro is the modelling of apparent surfaces within a picture by the suggestion of light and shadow. While tone was an important feature of paintings of the Medieval period, chiaroscuro was not. It became increasingly important to painters of the 15th century, transforming the depiction of three-dimensional space. * Taddeo Gaddi's Annunciation to the Shepherds is the first known large painting of a night scene. The internal light source of the picture is the angel. * In Fra Angelico's painting, daylight, which appears to come from the actual window of the friary cell which this fresco adorns, gently illuminates the figures and defines the architecture. * In his Emperor's Dream, Piero della Francesca takes up the theme of the night scene illuminated by an angel and applies his scientific knowledge of the diffusion of light. The tonal pattern thus created is a significant element in the composition of the painting. * In his Agony in the Garden, Giovanni Bellini uses the fading sunset on a cloudy evening to create an atmosphere of tension and impending tragedy. * In Domenico Veneziano's formal portrait, the use of chiaroscuro to model the form is slight. However, the painting relies strongly on the tonal contrasts of the pale face, mid-tone background and dark garment with patterned bodice for effect. * Botticelli uses chiaroscuro to model the face of the sitter and define the details of his simple garment. The light and shadow on the edge of the window define the angle of the light. * The suggested authorship of this early-16th-century portrait includes Ridolfo del Ghirlandaio, Mariotto Albertinelli and Giuliano Bugiardini. The painting combines many of the lighting effects of the other works in this gallery. The form is modelled by the light and shade, as if by a setting sun, which gives an element of drama, enhanced by the landscape. The tonal pattern created by the dark garment, the white linen and position of the hand is a compositional feature of the painting. * In Leonardo da Vinci's John the Baptist, elements of the painting, including the corners of the model's eyes and mouth, are disguised by shadow, creating an air of ambiguity and mystery.

Leonardo, among others, impressed upon students the necessity of the close observation of life and made the drawing of live models an essential part of a student's formal study of the art of painting. * Cimabue's Crucifixion, extensively destroyed by flood in 1966, shows the formal arrangement, with curving body and drooping head that was prevalent in late Medieval art. The anatomy is strongly stylised to conform with traditional iconic formula. * Giotto abandoned the traditional formula and painted from observation. * Massacio's figure of Christ is foreshortened as if viewed from below, and shows the upper torso strained as if with the effort of breathing. * In Giovanni Bellini's Deposition the artist, while not attempting to suggest the brutal realities of the crucifixion, has attempted to give the impression of death. * In Piero della Francesca's Baptism, the robust figure of Jesus is painted with a simplicity and lack of sharply defined muscularity that belies its naturalism. * The figure of Jesus in this painting, which is the combined work of Verrocchio and the young Leonardo, has in all probability been drafted by Verrocchio. The contours retain the somewhat contorted linearity of Gothic art. Much of the torso, however, is thought to have been painted by Leonardo and reveals a strong knowledge of anatomical form. * Leonardo's picture of St. Jerome shows the results of detailed study of the shoulder girdle, known from a page of drawings. * Michelangelo used human anatomy to great expressive effect. He was renowned for his ability in the creation of expressive poses and was imitated by many other painters and sculptors. File:Cimabue 025.jpgCimabue.

One of the children has Down syndrome. * Masaccio depicts the grief resulting from loss of innocence as Adam and Eve are expelled from the presence of God. * Antonello da Messina painted several versions of Ecce Homo, the tormented Christ as he was presented to the people by the Roman Governor. Such paintings usually show Christ in a tragic but heroic role, minimising the depiction of suffering. Antonello's depictions are starkly realistic. * In his Lamentation over the Dead christ, Mantegna has here depicted the dead body of Jesus with daring foreshortening, as if the viewer were standing at the end of the slab. * In this detail from a larger painting, Mantegna shows a little child, wearing a tummy-binder and holey slippers, turning away and chewing its fingers while the infant Christ is circumcised. * Giorgione paints a natural and unglamorised portrait of an old woman, unusual in its depiction of her illkempt hair and open mouth with crooked teeth.

Judas betrays Jesus to the soldiers by kissing him. The High Priest signals to a guard to seize him. Peter slices the ear off the high priest's servant as he steps forward to lay hands on Jesus. Five figures dominate the foreground, surrounding Jesus so that only his head is visible. Yet by skillful arrangement of color and the gestures of the men, Giotto makes the face of Jesus the focal point of the painting. * In The Death of Adam, Piero della Francesca has set the dying patriarch so that he is cast into relief against the black garment worn by one of his family. His importance to the story is further emphasised by the arch of figures formed around him and the diagonals of the arms which all lead to his head. p * The Resurrection of the Son of Theophilus is a remarkably cohesive whole, considering that it was begun by Masaccio, left unfinished, vandalised, and eventually completed by Filippino Lippi. Masaccio painted the central section. * Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo, in this highly systemised painting, have taken the cross-bow used by the archers in the foreground, as the compositional structure. Within this large triangular shape, divided vertically, the figures alternate between front and back views. * Botticelli's long, narrow painting of Mars and Venus is based on a W with the figures mirroring each other. The lovers, who shortly before were united, are now separated by sleep. The three small fawns who process across the painting hold the composition together. * Michelangelos mastery of complex figure composition, as in his The Entombment was to inspire many artists for centuries. In this panel painting the figure of Christ, though vertical, is slumped and a dead weight at the centre of the picture, while those who try to carry the body lean outwards to support it. * At first glance, Signorelli's Fall of the Damned is an appalling and violent jumble of bodies, but by the skilful placement of the figures so that the lines, rather than intersecting, flow in an undulating course through the picture, the composition is both unified and resolved into a large number of separate actions. The colours of the devils also serve to divide the picture into the tormentors and the tormented. * The Battle of Ostia was executed by Raphael's assistants, probably to his design. The foreground of the painting is organised into two overlapping arched shapes, the larger showing captives being subdued, while to the left and slightly behind, they are forced to kneel before the Pope. While the Pope rises above the second group and dominates it, the first group is dominated by a soldier whose colour and splendid headdress acts like a visual stepping stone to the Pope. At the edges of this group two stooping figures mirror each other, creating a tension in which one pushes away from the edge of the painting and the other pulls upward at its centre.

File:Raphael Ostia.jpgAssistants of Raphael, The Battle of Ostia, Raphael's Stanze Major works =Altarpieces= Through the Renaissance period, the large altarpiece had a unique status as a commission. An altarpiece was destined to become a focal point, not only visually in the religious building it occupied, but also in the devotions of the worshippers. Leonardo da Vinci's Madonna of the Rocks, now in the National Gallery, London but previously in a chapel in Milan, is one of many images that was used in the petitioning of the Blessed Virgin Mary against plague. The significance of these images to those who commissioned them, who worshipped in their location, and who created them is lost when they are viewed in an art gallery. * The two Enthroned Madonnas by Cimabue and Duccio di Buoninsegna demonstrate the variations on a theme that was formalised and constrained by tradition. Although the positions of the Madonna and Child are very similar, the artists have treated most of the features differently. Cimabue's throne is front-on and uses perspective to suggest its solidity. The angels, their faces, wings and haloes, are arranged to form a rich pattern. The gold leaf detailing of the Madonna's garment picks out the folds in a delicate network. The Child sits regally, with his feet set at the same angle as his mother's. * In Duccio's Rucellai Madonna, the largest of its kind at 4.5 metres high, the throne is set diagonally and the Child, much more of a baby despite his gesture, sits diagonally opposed to his mother. While the positioning of the kneeling angels is quite simplistic, they have a naturalism in their repeated postures and are varied by the beautiful colour combinations of their robes. On the Madonna's robe the gold border makes a meandering line, defining the form and contours, and enlivening the whole composition with a single decorative detail. * Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna is now housed in the same room of the Uffizi as Cimabue's and Duccio's, where the advances that he made in both drawing from the observation of nature, and in his use of perspective can be easily compared with the earlier masters. While the painting conforms to the model of an altarpiece, the figures within it do not follow the traditional formula. The Madonna and Child are solidly three-dimensional. This quality is enhanced by the canopied throne which contributes the main decorative element, while gold borders are minimised. The angels, which mirror each other, each have quite individual drapery. * A hundred years later, Masaccio, still within the constraints of the formal altarpiece, confidently creates a three-dimensional figure draped in heavy robes, her chubby Christ Child sucking on his fingers. The lutes played by the little angels are both steeply foreshortened. * In Fra Angelico's painting the figures lack the emphasis on mass of Masaccio's. Angelico was renowned for his delicacy in depicting the Madonna. The appeal of such paintings is demonstrated in the way the adoring angels are clustered around. As in Masaccio's painting, the Madonna's halo is decorated with pseudo-kufic script, probably to suggest her Middle Eastern origin. * In the hands of Piero della Francesca the formal gold frame is transformed into a classical niche, drawn in perfect linear perspective and defined by daylight. The assorted saints cluster round in a natural way, while the Madonna sits on a realistic throne on a small podium covered by an oriental carpet, while the donor Federico da Montefeltro kneels at her feet. A concession to tradition is that the Madonna is of a larger scale than the other figures. * In Bellini's painting, while on one hand, the figures and the setting give the effect of great realism, Bellini's interest in Byzantine icons is displayed in the hierarchical enthronement and demeanour of the Madonna. * The Milanese painter Bergognone has drawn on aspects of the work of Mantegna and Bellini to create this painting in which the red robe and golden hair of Catherine of Alexandria are effectively balanced by the contrasting black and white of Catherine of Siena, and framed by a rustic arch of broken bricks. * In Andrea Mantegna's Madonna della Vittoria, the Madonna may occupy the central position, framed in her garlanded gazebo, but the focus of attention is Francesco II Gonzaga whose achievements are acknowledged not only by the Madonna and Christ Child but by the heroic saints, Michael and George. * Leonardo da Vinci abandoned any sort of formal canopy and surrounded the Madonna and Child with the grandeur of nature into which he set the figures in a carefully balanced yet seemingly informal trapezoid composition. * The Sistine Madonna by Raphael uses the formula not of an altarpiece but the formal portrait, with a frame of green curtains through which a vision can be seen, witnessed by Pope Sixtus II for whom the work is named. The clouds around the Virgin are composed of cherubic faces, while the two iconic cherubs so beloved with the late 20th century fashion for angels, prop themselves on the sill. This work became the model for Murillo and many other painters. * Andrea del Sarto, while using figures to a very natural and lifelike effect, abandons in the Madonna of the Harpies practical reality by setting the Madonna on a Classical plinth as if she were a statue. Every figure is in a state of instability, marked by the forward thrust of the Madonna's knee against which she balances a book. This painting is showing the trends that were to be developed in Mannerist painting.

File:Andrea del Sarto 003.jpgAndrea del Sarto, The Madonna of the Harpies, 1517 =Fresco cycles= The largest, most time-consuming paid work that an artist could do was a scheme of frescoes for a church, private palace or commune building. Of these, the largest unified scheme in Italy which remains more-or-less intact is that created by a number of different artists at the end of the Medieval period at the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi. It was followed by Giotto's Proto-Renaissance scheme at Padua and many others ranging from Benozzo Gozzoli's Magi Chapel for the Medici to Michelangelo's supreme accomplishment for Pope Julius II at the Sistine Chapel. * Giotto painted the large, free-standing Scrovegni Chapel in Padua with the Life of the Virgin and the Life of Christ. Breaking from medieval tradition, it set a standard of naturalism. * The two large frescoes of Allegories of Good and Bad Government painted by Ambrogio Lorenzetti for the Commune of Siena are completely secular and show detailed views of a townscape with citizens, emphasising the importance of civic order. * By contrast, Andrea di Bonaiuto, painting for the Dominicans at the new church of Santa Maria Novella, completed a huge fresco of the Triumph of the Church, which shows the role of the church in the work of Salvation, and in particular, the role of the Dominicans, who also appear symbolically as the Hounds of Heaven, shepherding the people of God. The painting includes a view of Florence Cathedral. * Masaccio and Masolino collaborated on the Brancacci Chapel fresco cycle which is most famous for Masaccio's lifelike innovations, Masolino's more elegant style is seen in this townscape which skillfully combines two episodes of the Life of St. Peter. * Piero della Francesca's fresco cycle in the church of San Francesco, Arezzo, closely follows the Legend of the True Cross as written by Jacopo da Varagine in the Golden Legend. The pictures reveal his studies of light and perspective, and the figures have an almost monolithic solidity. * Benozzo Gozzoli's fresco cycle for the private chapel of the Medici Palace is a late work in the International Gothic style, a fanciful and richly ornamental depiction of the Medici with their entourage as the Three Wise Men. * The elaborate cycle for the House of Este's Palazzo Schifanoia at Ferrara, executed in part by Francesco del Cossa, was also fanciful in its depictions of Classical deities and Zodial signs which are combined with scenes of the life of the family. * Mantegna's paintings for the Gonzaga also show family life but have a preponderance of highly realistic elements and skillfully utilise the real architecture of the room they decorate, the mantelpiece forming a plinth for the figures and the real ceiling pendentives being apparently supported on painted pilasters. * While in the Brancacci Chapel, historians seek to identify the faces of Masaccio, Masolino and perhaps Donatello among the apostles, Domenico Ghirlandaio at the Sassetti Chapel makes no attempt to disguise his models. Each fresco in this religious cycle has two sets of figures: those who tell the story and those who are witness to it. In this scene of the Birth of the Virgin Mary, a number of the noble women of Florence have come in, as if to congratulate the new mother. * The Punishment of the Sons of Korah by Botticelli is one of episodes the Life of Moses series, which, together with The Life of Christ, was commissioned in the 1480s as decoration to the Sistine Chapel. The artists Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli all worked on the carefully designed and harmonious scheme. * Michelangelo's painting of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, which he executed alone over a period of five years, with narratives from Genesis, prophetic figures and the Ancestors of Christ, was destined to become one of the most famous artworks in the world. * Simultaneously, Raphael and a number of his assistants painted the papal chambers known as Raphael Rooms. In The School of Athens Raphael depicts famous people of his day, including Leonardo, Michelangelo, Bramante and himself, as philosophers of ancient Athens.

Scenes of the Life of Christ, the Life of the Virgin, or Lives of the Saints were also made in large numbers for churches, particularly scenes associated with the Nativity and the Passion of Jesus. The Last Supper was commonly depicted in religious refectories. During the Renaissance an increasing number of patrons had their likeness committed to posterity in paint. For this reason there exists a great number of Renaissance portraits for whom the name of the sitter is unknown. Wealthy private patrons commissioned artworks as decoration for their homes, of increasingly secular subject matter. =Devotional paintings= The Madonna These small intimate pictures, which are now nearly all in museums, were most often done for private ownership, but might occasionally grace a small altar in a chapel. * The Madonna adoring the Christ Child with two Angels has always been particularly popular on account of the expressive little boy angel supporting the Christ Child. Paintings of Filippo Lippi's such as this were to particularly influence Botticelli. * Verrocchio separates the Madonna and Christ Child from the viewer by a stone sill, also used in many portraits. The rose and the cherries represent spiritual love and sacrificial love. * Antonello da Messina's Madonna and Child is superficially very like that of Verrocchio, but it is much less formal and both the mother and the child appear to be moving rather than posing for the painter. The foreshortened elbow of the Child as he reaches for his mother's breast occurs in Raphael's work and can be seen in a different form in Michelangelo's Doni Tondo. * The figures placed at opposing diagonals seen in this early Madonna and Child by Leonardo da Vinci was a compositional theme that was to recur in many of his works and be imitated by his pupils and by Raphael. * Giovanni Bellini was influenced by Greek Orthodox icons. The gold cloth in this painting takes the place of the gold leaf background. The arrangement is formal, yet the gestures, and in particular the mother's adoring gaze, give a human warmth to this picture. * Vittore Carpaccio's Madonna and Child is very unusual in showing the Christ Child as a toddler fully dressed in contemporary clothing. The meticulous detail and domesticity are suggestive of Early Netherlandish painting. * Michelangelo's Doni Tondo is the largest of these works, but was a private commission. The highly unusual composition, the contorted form of the Madonna, the three heads all near the top of the painting and the radical foreshortening were all very challenging features, and Agnolo Doni was not sure that he wished to pay for it. * Raphael has skillfully set opposing forces into play, and united the Madonna and Child with a loving gaze.

File:Raffael 005.jpgRaphael, The Bridgewater Madonna, 1505. =Secular paintings= Portraits During the latter half of the 15th century, there was a proliferation of portraits. Although the subjects of some of them were later remembered for their achievements or their noble lineage, the identities of many have been lost and that of even the most famous portrait of all time, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, is open to speculation and controversy. * The advantage of a profile portrait such as Piero della Francesca's Portrait of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta is that it identifies the subject like a facial signature. The proportions of the face, the respective angles of the forehead, nose and brow, the position and shape of the eye and the set of the jaw remain recognisable through life. Moreover, once a profile likeness has been taken, it can be used to cast a medal or sculpt an image in relief. * Pollaiuolo has conformed to the formula, emphasising this young woman's profile with a fine line which also defines the delicate shape of her nostrils and the corners of her mouth. But he has added a three-dimensional quality by the subtle use of chiaroscuro and the treatment of the rich Florentine brocade of her sleeve. * Alesso Baldovinetti, on the other hand, has used the profile of this strong-featured girl to create a striking pattern of a highlighted contour against the darker background. The background is a lively shape adding to the compositional structure of the painting. The little black fillet on her forehead responds to the dynamic pattern of the embroidered sleeve. * Botticelli's portrait, although turned to three-quarter view with strong tonal modelling, has much to do with Baldovinetti's painting in its striking arrangement of shapes in the red garment, the hat and the dark hair and the pattern that they form against the background. * Antonello da Messina's portrait, some years earlier than Botticelli's, bears it a passing similarity. But this painting does not rely heavily on the skilful arrangement of clearly contoured shapes. Antonello has used the advantages of oil paint, as against Botticelli's tempera, to achieve a subtle and detailed likeness in which the bushy eyebrows, the imperfections of the skin and the shadow of the beard have been rendered with photographic precision. * Ghirlandaio's tempera portrait of an old man with his grandson combines the meticulous depiction of the old man's enlarged nose and parchment-like skin with a tenderness usually reserved for portrayals of The Madonna and Child. Ghirlandaio takes this analogy further by setting the scene against a window and landscape. * Pintoricchio's portrait of a boy sets him high in the picture frame, reducing his scale in proportion to the area in contrast to the usual way of showing adults. The painting is set against a landscape such as used by Leonardo and Bellini. Pinturicchio's main fame lay in his skillfully characterised portraits like this. * In the Mona Lisa Leonardo employed the technique of sfumato, delicately graded chiaroscuro that models the surface contours, while allowing details to disappear in the shadows. The technique gives an air of mystery to this painting which has brought it lasting fame. The beautiful hands become almost a decorative element. * Giovanni Bellini's portrait of the elected Duke of Venice has an official air and could hardly be more formal. Yet the face is characterised with what one might hope for in the Doge, wisdom, humour and decisiveness. Although a more elaborate painting, it has much in common with Baldovinetti's sense of design. * The subject of Titian's portrait is unknown, and its considerable fame rests solely on its beauty and unusual composition in which the face is supported and balanced by the large blue sleeve of quilted satin. The sleeve is almost the same colour as the background; its rich tonality gives it form. The white linen of the shirt enlivens the composition, while the man's eyes pick up the colour of the sleeve with penetrating luminosity. * Superficially, Andrea del Sarto's portrait has many of the same elements as Titian's. But it is handled very differently, being much broader in treatment, and less compelling in subject. The painting has achieved an immediacy, as if the sitter has paused for a moment and is about to return to what he is doing. * Raphael, in this much-copied portrait of Pope Julius II, set a standard for the painting of future popes. Unlike the contemporary portraits here by Bellini, Titian and del Sarto, Raphael has abandoned the placement of the figure behind a shelf or barrier and has shown the Pope as if seated in his own apartment. Against the green cloth decorated with the keys of St. Peter, the red velvet papal garments make a rich contrast, the white beard being offset by the pleated white linen. On the uprights of the chair, the acorn finials are the symbol of the Pope's family, the della Rovere.

The nude These four famous paintings demonstrate the advent and acceptance of the nude as a subject for the artist in its own right. * In Botticelli's Birth of Venus, the nude figure, although central to the painting, is not of itself the subject. The subject of the painting is a story from Classical mythology. The fact that the Goddess Venus rose naked from the sea provides justification for the nude study that dominates the centre of the work. * Painted thirty years later, the exact meaning of Giovanni Bellini's picture is unclear. Had the subject been painted by an Impressionist painter, it would be quite unnecessary to ascribe a meaning. But in this Renaissance work, there is the presence of a mirror, an object that is usually symbolic and which suggests an allegory. The young lady's nakedness is a sign not so much of seduction, as innocence and vulnerability. However, she decks herself out in an extremely rich headdress, stitched with pearls, and having not one, but two mirrors, sees only herself reflected endlessly. The mirror, often a symbol of prophecy, here becomes an object of vanity, with the young woman in the role of Narcissus. * Giorgione's painting possibly predates Bellini's by ten years. It has always been known as The Sleeping Venus but there is nothing in the painting to confirm that it is, indeed, Venus. The painting is remarkable for its lack of symbolism and the emphasis on the body simply as an object of beauty. It is believed to have been completed by Titian. * Titian's Venus of Urbino, on the other hand, was painted for the pleasure of the Duke of Urbino, and as in Botticelli's Birth of Venus, painted for a member of the Medici family, the model looks directly at the viewer. The model may very well have been the mistress of the client. Venus of Urbino is not simply a body beautiful in its own right. She is an individual and highly seductive young woman, who is not in the nude state indicative of heavenly perfection, but is simply naked, having taken off her clothes but left on some of her jewellery.

Classical mythology Paintings of classical mythology were invariably done for the important salons in the houses of private patrons. Botticelli's most famous works are for the Medici, Raphael painted Galatea for Agostino Chigi and Bellini's Feast of the Gods was, with several works by Titian, in the home of Alfonso I d'Este * Pollaiuolo's Hercules and the Hydra typifies many paintings of mythological subjects which lent themselves to interpretation that was both Humanist and Christian. In this work good overcomes evil, and courage is glorified. The figure of Hercules has resonances with the Biblical character of Samson who also was renowned for his strength and slew a lion. * In Botticelli's Pallas and the Centaur, Wisdom, personified by Athena, leads the cowering Centaur by the forelock, so learning and refinement are able to overcome brute instinct, which is the characteristic symbolised by the centaur. * Raphael's Galatea, though Classical in origin, has a specifically Christian resonance that would have been recognised by those who were familiar with the story. It is about the nature of love. While all around her aspire to earthly love and succumb to the arrows shot by the trio of cupids, Galatea has chosen spiritual love and turns her eyes to Heaven. * Three large works remain that were painted for a single room for the Este by Bellini and his successor Titian. Of these, Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne represents a moment in a narrative. The other two paintings are jolly drinking scenes with a number of narrative elements introduced in a minor way, in order that characters might be identifiable. This painting does not appear to have any higher allegorical sentiment attached to it. It appears to be simply a very naturalistic portrayal of a number of the ancient gods and their associates, eating, drinking and enjoying the party.

Clapp Hall at the University of Pittsburgh. Clapp Hall George Hubbard Clapp Hall is a contributing property to the Schenley Farms National Historic District. The six-story Gothic Revival structure, designed by Trautwein & Howard, was completed in 1956 and serves as the primary facility of the University of Pittsburgh Department of Biological Sciences. It contains laboratories, classrooms, a greenhouse, and an amphitheater-style lecture hall with 404 seats. Langley Hall Entrance to Langley Hall at the University of Pittsburgh. Langley Hall is the second unit of the natural science quadrangle (along with Clapp Hall and Crawford Hall). Langley Hall is named after Samuel Pierpont Langley, a former University of Pittsburgh professor who was a renowned astronomer, an aviation pioneer, and the director of Allegheny Observatory. Langley Hall's construction was begun in 1959 made possible by a $2.5 million grant ($ million today) from the General State Authority.http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi- bin/t/text/pageviewer- idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;q1=langley%20hall;rgn=full%20text;idno=00c50130m;didno=00c50130m;view=image;seq=0285 Completed in 1961 in the International Style, Langley Hall was originally the home of the Department of Geology, Department of Psychology, and the Department of Biology, (now part of the Department of Biological Sciences).. It was originally conceived as an annex to Clapp Hall, to which it is connected on the south side. For this reason, the room numbers in Langley Hall all begin with the letter 'A' to denote 'Annex.' The Department of Biological Sciences occupies the First, Second, Third, and Fifth floors of Langley Hall. Crawford Hall, home of the Department of Neuroscience, is connect to Langley Hall's north side, together forming the 3-building CLC complex that is devoted to the biological sciences, housing both biological sciences and neuroscience lectures and research laboratories. A research greenhouse composed of four bays is located on Langley Hall's sixth floor.Howard, Giles; Greenhouses aplenty at Pitt; The Pitt News, Aug 25, 2008; accessdate=2008-08-27 Samuel Langley Langley Hall also contains Langley Library that is the biology, neuroscience, psychology, and life sciences unit of the University Library System at Pitt. The library holds more than 77,000 bound volumes on site, and maintains over 650 current journal subscriptions. Several prominent journals are also available on the World Wide Web. The library holdings range from volumes, dissertations, monographs, and journals in every topic in the biological sciences, covering both basic and advanced topics. The library conducts courses on using computers for research/literature searches in the biological sciences and has 13 computers for this purpose. More than 130,000 patrons enter the library each year, checking out some 24,000 items. Langley Library has a capacity of 102, and is typically open 75.5 hours each week. On January 20, 1977, two women were killed and several people injured in a gas explosion that destroyed part of Langley Hall. Coroner Cyril Wecht, after a two-day inquest, ruled the explosion an accident. Langley Hall was rebuilt and then reopened in 1982. In 2011 a $2 million greenhouse was opened on the sixth-level roof Langley Hall where it connects to Clapp Hall. The greenhouse features two zones with mobile plant benches and a computerized environmental control system, including a fogging system, cooling units, motorized retractable shades and heat retention roof curtains, and motor controlled light fixtures of multiple types to facilitate the regulation of temperature, humidity, and light. In addition, renovation plans were announced that include the installation of a biosafety level-3 facility that incorporates what are perhaps first in the nation features, such an observation room and monitoring cameras, to facilitate undergraduate learning. Crawford Hall Crawford Hall, home of the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh. Crawford Hall along Bigelow Boulevard Crawford Hall is home to the Department of Neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh. Designed in the international style, it is last of the three main buildings to be constructed. Crawford Hall's construction was begun in 1966 and the $3.8 million ($ million today) building was completed and dedicated in 1969. It was originally the home of the Department of Chemistry, the Department of Psychology, and the Department of Biophysics and Microbiology (now part of the Department of Biological Sciences). Crawford Hall is named after Stanton C. Crawford, former Dean and 13th Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, whose scientific specialty was Biology.

Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates were developed by the Swedish company Lyckeby Starch in the 1960s. The HSH family of polyols is an approved food ingredient in Canada, Japan, and Australia. HSH sweeteners provide 40 to 90% sweetness relative to table sugar. Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are produced by the partial hydrolysis of starch ‚Äì most often corn starch, but also potato starch or wheat starch. This creates dextrins (glucose and short glucose chains). The hydrolyzed starch (dextrin) then undergoes hydrogenation to convert the dextrins to sugar alcohols. Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are similar to sorbitol: if the starch is completely hydrolyzed so that only single glucose molecules remain, then after hydrogenation the result is sorbitol. Because in HSHs the starch is not completely hydrolyzed, a mixture of sorbitol, maltitol, and longer chain hydrogenated saccharides (such as maltotriitol) is produced. When no single polyol is dominant in the mix, the generic name hydrogenated starch hydrolysates is used. However, if 50% or more of the polyols in the mixture are of one type, it can be labeled as \\"sorbitol syrup\\", or \\"maltitol syrup\\", etc.  Uses  Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are used commercially in the same way as other common sugar alcohols. They are often used as both a sweetener and as a humectant (moisture-retaining ingredient). As a crystallization modifier, they can prevent syrups from forming crystals of sugar. It is used to add bulk, body, texture, and viscosity to mixtures, and can protect against damage from freezing and drying. HSH products are generally blended with other sweeteners, both caloric and artificial.  Health and safety  Similar to xylitol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are not readily fermented by oral bacteria and are used to formulate sugarless products that do not promote dental caries. HSHs are also more slowly absorbed in the digestive tract, thus, have a reduced glycemic potential relative to glucose. However, they do have a laxative effect when consumed in large amounts.

Alongside is a display of weapons and cloaks. Photograph taken by Albert Percy Godber circa 1900 A grass skirt is a costume and garment made with layers of plant fibres such as grasses (Poaceae) and leaves that is fastened at the waistline. Pacific Grass skirts were introduced to Hawaii by immigrants from the Gilbert Islands around the 1870s to 1880s although their origins are attributed to Samoa as well. According to DeSoto Brown, a historian at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, it is likely Hawaiian dancers began wearing them during their performances on the vaudeville circuit of the United States mainland. Traditional Hawaiian skirts were often made with fresh ti leaves, which were not available in the United States. By the turn of the century, Hawaiian dancers in both Hawaii and the US were wearing grass skirts. Some Hawaiian-style hula dancers still wear them. The traditional costume of Hawaiian hula kahiko includes kapa cloth skirts and men in malo (loincloth) however, during the 1880s hula ‚Äòauana was developed from western influences. It is during this period that the grass skirt began to be seen everywhere although hula ‚Äòauana costumes usually included more western looking clothing with fabric-topped dresses for women and pants for men. The use of the grass skirt was present in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago where Hawaiian hula dancers played into American stereotypes by wearing the costume. From the late 19th-century to World War II, grass skirts in Polynesia became a \\"powerful symbol of South Sea sexuality\\". In the Pacific theater, grass skirts were sought after souvenirs by servicemen abroad. The end of the war saw many sailors returning from their duties in the Pacific. Polynesian culture had begun to take root in the US through such things as James A. Michener's Tales of the South Pacific and its subsequent musical and film adaption, as well as Don the Beachcomber opening in Hollywood. The war had helped to create a national interest in Polynesian food and d√©cor. The tiki culture continued, spurred on by Hawaii's statehood in 1959 and Disney's opening of the Enchanted Tiki Room in 1963 as well as popular film and television shows like \\"Hawaiian Eye\\" in 1959 and Elvis Presley's Blue Hawaii in 1961.

He was designed by Ron Milner, and manufactured by Axlon, a company formed by Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari and Chuck E. Cheese, through his Catalyst Technologies venture capital firm. The manufacturer's tag lists the bear's production date as 1985. The bear wears a durable collared blue shirt with its name embroidered in yellow letters on the front. The shirt has a velcro strap in the back and the bear has a zipper that secures the internal black voice box. Description The bear was a commercial success due to its interactive capabilities: AG Bear is equipped with a voice box which was originally intended to mimic the intonation of the human voice or other sounds in the environment, but expectations changed when children discovered that AG could respond with a spontaneous voice. AG Bear's voice is synth with some \\"growling\\". The company referred to this as \\"bear talk\\". When two AG bears are placed beside each other, they interact once one of them starts talking (sound is what makes AG bear react, so the sound of one AG Bear would set the other one talking, and so on). AG Bear was released in several different fur colors: the traditional bear is brown, while other bear colors include white and grey. AG's traditional clothing is a blue corduroy shirt with a gold AG Bear monogram, although a red corduroy version also exists. Several other versions of the bear were released over time, including GrandPaw AG, GrandMaw AG, Bearonica (AG's sister), and several Baby AG's. When Axlon was eventually sold to Hasbro, AG Bear production was halted. But in the late 1990s, a multi-year lobbying effort resulted in an agreement to resume production of the original AG in a limited run edition.  In popular culture  The basic concept of the AG Bear strongly resembles a fictitious toy seen in a 1984 episode of Knight Rider (S02E20, \\"A Good Knight's Work\\"). The fictional bear was called Mighty Mouth, and \\"responds to over 1,500 phrases\\" using voice activation (or by pressing his nose). Mighty Mouth speaks in a high-pitched voice, and argues with KITT in several scenes. The plot of the episode centers around a large toy company attempting to steal the blueprints for Mighty Mouth's circuitry from its inventor. It's unclear exactly what degree of AI Mighty Mouth possesses - it seems to be more advanced than simply a random selection of pre-recorded clips, although it is not a fully self-aware machine like KITT. It's unclear whether the episode had any connection to the real AG Bear or similar products, but aside from speaking in recorded phrases rather than synthesized sounds, the concept of the toy was almost identical.

Background Ward received a law degree in 1954 at the University of Tennessee College of Law in Knoxville. Rather than practicing law, he decided to go into radio and advertising. Ward's first broadcast of a university basketball game for the Vol Network came in 1958. (Under the leadership of football coach Robert Neyland, sports broadcasting rights had been taken in- house.) Shortly after, Ward joined the army. After returning to Knoxville, Ward went to work at the Lavitch and Davis advertising agency. In 1964 he began handling the duties as announcer-host-coordinator for University of Tennessee coaches' television shows in football and basketball. His broadcasting career blossomed when he became the Vols' radio play-by-play voice, first, for basketball in 1965 and three years later for football (1968). Career In addition to his duties with the Vol Network, Ward covered events for ABC-TV and ESPN.UT Sports Ward and Bill Anderson, his color commentator for 31 years, became the longest-running broadcasting partnership in college football.Tennessee Vols Traditions Ward's trademarks include: his introduction to each game, \\"It's football time in Tennessee!\\" his touchdown call, \\"Give ... him ... SIX! ... TOUCHDOWN, TENNESSEE!\\" asking, \\"Did he make it?\\" and answering, \\"HE MADE IT!\\" after a made field goal; made extra points were \\"GOOD-DAH!\\" counting runners down toward the goal line, \\"four...three...two....one...\\" and enthusiastically saying, \\"BOTTOM!\\" after a made basket in basketball. He was well known for wearing a light blue towel around his neck. After the 1998-99 football and basketball seasons, in which the Volunteers won the National Championship in football, Ward and Anderson retired, and were replaced by Bob Kesling and Tim Priest, respectively. In his final season as \\"Voice of the Vols,\\" UT named the fourth level of the East Skybox at Neyland Stadium \\"The John Ward Broadcast Center.\\" Ward's final football broadcast was the 1999 Fiesta Bowl, the first BCS national championship. Tennessee defeated Florida State to win its second undisputed national championship. His final basketball broadcast for the Vols came in the second round of the 1999 NCAA men's tournament, with Tennessee's loss to Southwest Missouri State University on March 21. In later years, Ward still did some commercial radio advertisements and public service announcements heard statewide.

Pelvic and lower extremity radiograph shows extensive calcification of the femoral arteries. B. Translumbar aortography shows near-total obstruction of the femoral arteries. M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis, or M√∂nckeberg's sclerosis, is a form of arteriosclerosis or vessel hardening, where calcium deposits are found in the muscular middle layer of the walls of arteries (the tunica media). It is an example of dystrophic calcification. This condition occurs as an age-related degenerative process. However, it can occur in pseudoxanthoma elasticum and idiopathic arterial calcification of infancy as a pathological condition, as well. Its clinical significance and cause are not well understood and its relationship to atherosclerosis and other forms of vascular calcification are the subject of disagreement. M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis is named after Johann Georg M√∂nckeberg,J. G. M√∂nckeberg. √úber die reine Mediaverkalkung der Extremit√§tenarterien und ihr Verhalten zur Arteriosklerose. Virchows Archiv f√ºr pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie, und f√ºr klinische Medicin, Berlin, 1903, 171: 141-167. who first described it in 1903. Signs and symptoms Typically, M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis is not associated with symptoms unless complicated by atherosclerosis, calciphylaxis, or accompanied by some other disease. However, the presence of M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis is associated with poorer prognosis. This is probably due to vascular calcification causing increased arterial stiffness, increased pulse pressure and resulting in exaggerated damage to the heart and kidneys. Cause Minor degrees of calcification of the cardiovascular system are common in elderly people, and the prevalence of vascular calcification is increased by some diseases (see Epidemiology section). Vascular calcification results from the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals (hydroxyapatite) as a consequence of disordered calcium phosphate regulation in the blood vessel. Hydroxyapatite is secreted in vesicles that bleb out from vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes in the arterial wall. The mechanism of vascular calcification is not fully understood, but probably involves a phenotypic change in the vascular smooth muscle cells in the wall with activation of bone-forming programs. Numerous regulators of calcification such as osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, matrix gla protein and fetuin-A, receptor activator of NF-kappa-B, receptor activator of NF-kappa-B ligand and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand protein have been implicated in this process. It is unclear whether M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis is a distinct entity or forms part of a spectrum of vascular calcification that includes atherosclerosis and calcification in the inner layer of the artery wall (tunica intima), calcification of the internal elastic lamina, calcification of cardiac valves and widespread soft tissue calcification. The existence of M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis has been disputed and it has been proposed that it is a part of a continuum of atherosclerotic disease: the majority of atherosclerotic plaques contain some calcium deposits and calcification of the internal elastic lamina is common in pathological specimens labelled as M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis. However studies in animals suggest that a predominantly medial pattern of vascular calcification reflects different underlying mechanisms of disease, and despite involvement of the internal elastic lamina, evidence of inflammation is rare in M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis. Diagnosis Often M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis is discovered as an incidental finding in an X-ray radiograph, on mammograms, in autopsy, or in association with investigation of some other disease, such as diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Typically calcification is observed in the arteries of the upper and lower limb although it has been seen in numerous other medium size arteries. In the radial or ulnar arteries it can cause \\"pipestem\\" arteries, which present as a bounding pulse at the end of the calcific zone. It may also result in \\"pulselessness.\\" Epidemiological studies have used the ratio of ankle to brachial blood pressure (ankle brachial pressure index, ABPI or ABI) as an indicator of arterial calcification with ABPI >1.3 to >1.5 being used as a diagnostic criterion depending on the study. Management Epidemiology The prevalence of M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis increases with age and is more frequent in diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic inflammatory conditions, hypervitaminosis D and rare genetic disorders, such as Keutel syndrome. The prevalence of M√∂nckeberg's arteriosclerosis in the general population has been estimated as <1% on the basis of an ankle brachial pressure index >1.5; however the validity of this criterion is questionable.

It is north of the city of Cairns. It is named after the palm trees that line the beach.  Geography  Palm Cove is located in Far North Queensland on the Australian coast. It has a long sandy beach along most of its seafront except for the rocky headland around Buchan Point in the north of the suburb. Arlington Reef is the closest section of The Great Barrier Reef to Palm Cove being around offshore. The reef shelters the inshore waters from the Coral Sea swells creating relatively calm waters between the reef and the beach. To the west of Palm Cove is the Macalister Range National Park which is part of the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. Since Palm Cove is located in a tropical climate, the average summer temperature is between 24 and 33 degrees Celsius; average winter temperature is between 14 and 26 degrees Celsius. The town of Buchan is within the Palm Cove locality, but the use of the name Buchan has fallen into disuse over the years.  History  Palm Cove is situated in the Djabugay (Tjapukai) traditional Aboriginal country. Shortly before World War I in 1918, the land that is today Palm Cove was bought by Albert Veivers from Archdeacon Campbell. Archdeacon Campbell had been known as a priest at Cairns church who experimented with bringing different agricultural crops to the Cairns region. Veivers was important in the advancement of Palm Cove by having the first road built. The creation of the road led property values in Palm Cove to increase dramatically, leading to more prosperity for the community. Shortly after World War II, in which Palm Cove was used as a training base for Australian soldiers, the number of people traveling to Palm Cove greatly increased. The opening of the Ramada Reef Resort in 1986 marked the first international hotel chain to be located in Palm Cove and the town has continued to increase in national and international recognition ever since. At the 2006 census, Palm Cove had a population of 1,215. Public services Due to the small size of Palm Cove, the community does not offer many public services of its own. The closest airport to Palm Cove is the Cairns International Airport. The only method of direct transportation to Palm Cove is along the Captain Cook Highway which stretches from Cairns in the south to Mossman in the north. Palm Cove has no schools and children typically go to public or private schools in the surrounding suburbs of Kewarra Beach, Trinity Beach, and Smithfield. Palm Cove does not offer many options for shopping. The closest shopping centre is at Clifton Beach. Tourism The major industry for Palm Cove is tourism. Palm Cove is also a tourist destination due to its proximity to the Great Barrier Reef and the Daintree Rainforest. Palm Cove is the location of many resorts and hotels. Recreation Jogger's track at William's Esplanade The pristine beaches and palm tree lined paths are used by joggers, walkers and cyclists and netted life guard patrol swimming enclosures offer safe access to the sea all year round. The Palm Cove jetty is one of the regions most popular fishing spots where anglers regularly catch species such as mackerel, Giant Trevally or \\"G.T's\\" and shark.

Brittain was born in Georgia and, aside from a brief stint at the University of Chicago for graduate school, spent most of his life serving the educational community there. After receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Emory College in 1886, Brittain worked his way up the ranks from principal of an Atlanta high school to superintendent of education for the entire state of Georgia. In 1922, Brittain accepted the position of president of the Georgia Institute of Technology, then called the Georgia School of Technology, an office he would hold until his retirement in 1944. During his 22-year tenure at Georgia Tech, Brittain was credited with doubling student enrollment, establishing what is now the second largest aerospace engineering faculty in the United States, and playing an influential role in securing Georgia Tech's position as a leading technical institute and research university. After his retirement, Brittain wrote The Story of Georgia Tech (1948), a history of the Institute published shortly before his death in 1953.  Early life  Marion L. Brittain was born in Wilkes County, Georgia in 1866 to Dr. J. M. Brittain, a Baptist minister, and Ida Callaway, granddaughter of Baptist minister Enoch Callaway. Brittain's childhood was spent in a variety of towns and cities throughout the state of Georgia due to his father's career as a minister. He attended Emory College for his undergraduate studies, graduating in 1886 with the commendation that he was the \\"best student in his department the college had had in ten years.\\" Brittain then spent ten years as an administrator of several high schools in the Atlanta, Georgia area. In 1897, he gained local fame for his erudition after winning a contest held by the Atlanta Constitution in which he was able to identify the missing word from a passage taken from an obscure book on English literature. Brittain left his work as a high school administrator in 1898 to pursue graduate studies at the University of Chicago. On December 5, 1899, Brittain and Lettie McDonald, daughter of Baptist minister Dr. Henry McDonald, were married. He returned to academic administration, first as superintendent of the Fulton County School System (1900‚Äì1910) and later, at the appointment of Joseph Mackey Brown, the education system for the entire state of Georgia (1910‚Äì1922). In this role, Brittain became well known for fighting corruption and generally improving the education system. Throughout this time, Brittain earned LL.D. degrees from Mercer University (1919), and, later, the University of Georgia (1927) and Emory University (1928). He was also president of the Georgia Education Association in 1906, of the Southern Education Association in 1913, and of the Council of State School Superintendents of the United States in 1917. He earned the wrath of Senator Tom Watson during these positions, who attempted to remove Brittain from his position as superintendent of education.  President of Georgia Tech  On August 1, 1922, Brittain was elected president of the Georgia School of Technology (Georgia Tech). During his tenure, Brittain was able to convince the state of Georgia to increase funding for the Institute. He had noted in the 1923 annual report that \\"there are more students in Georgia Tech than in any other two colleges in Georgia, and we have the smallest appropriation of them all.\\" Additionally, a $300,000 grant (equivalent to $ in ) from the Guggenheim Foundation allowed Brittain to establish the David Guggenheim School of Aeronautics at Georgia Tech. In 1930, Brittain's decision to use the money for a School of Aeronautics was controversial; today, the David Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering boasts the second largest faculty in the United States behind MIT. Other accomplishments during Brittain's administration included a doubling of Georgia Tech's enrollment, the first ROTC unit in the Southern United States, accreditation for the Institute by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, and the creation of a new ceramic engineering department, building, and major that attracted the American Ceramics Society's national convention to Atlanta. Perhaps most significantly, Brittain is attributed with providing the vision and securing the finances to move Georgia Tech away from its roots as a teaching-oriented trade school and towards a new focus on science and technology research. Brittain was known by reputation as a kind, gentle man and was well liked by students and faculty. He was especially remembered for his dedication to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team, attending nearly every game including those taking place out-of-state. Outside of Georgia Tech, Brittain taught Sunday school classes and maintained active membership in a number of service organizations. Brittain retired from his position as president of Georgia Tech in 1944, after which he penned a history of the Institute entitled The Story of Georgia Tech, completed in 1948. He died in 1953, survived by three children: McDonald, Marion Luther, Jr., and Ida, three grandsons, and a great-granddaughter. Flags at the university were flown at half-staff for a month in remembrance of Brittain, and classes were cancelled for the rest of the school week.  Legacy  Entrance to Dr. Marion Luther Brittain, Sr., House Long after his death, Brittain continues to be remembered through several prestigious awards named in his honor. The Marion L. Brittain Fellows Program, established in 1990, awards postdoctoral fellowships to teach in the Communications Program at Georgia Tech's School of Literature, Communication, and Culture for up to three years. At Emory University, the Marion Luther Brittain Award is presented annually at commencement to a graduate \\"who has demonstrated exemplary service to both the university and the greater community without expectation of recognition\\" and is considered the university's highest student honor. A pair of buildings bears the name of Brittain as well. The Dr. Marion Luther Brittain, Sr., House, built in the Neoclassical Revival style and located at 1109 West Peachtree Street in Atlanta, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 23, 1993. The building served as Brittain's home from its construction in 1911 until Brittain and his family moved to the Georgia Tech president's house in 1922. It was later converted into office space and is privately owned. By 2018, the house had been demolished to make way for 1105 West Peachtree. Additionally, the Marion L. Brittain Dining Hall, erected in 1928, is one of two dining facilities for students living in residence halls on the east side of Georgia Tech's campus.

The hallmark of Lefort fractures is traumatic pterygomaxillary separation, which signifies fractures between the pterygoid plates, horseshoe shaped bony protuberances which extend from the inferior margin of the maxilla, and the maxillary sinuses. Continuity of this structure is a keystone for stability of the midface, involvement of which impacts surgical management of trauma victims, as it requires fixation to a horizontal bar of the frontal bone. The pterygoid plates lie posterior to the upper dental row, or alveolar ridge, when viewing the face from an anterior view. The fractures are named after French surgeon Ren√© Le Fort (1869‚Äì1951), who discovered the fracture patterns by examining crush injuries in cadavers.  Signs and symptoms  Le Fort I ‚Äî Slight swelling of the upper lip, ecchymosis is present in the buccal sulcus beneath each zygomatic arch, malocclusion, mobility of teeth. Impacted type of fractures may be almost immobile and it is only by grasping the maxillary teeth and applying a little firm pressure that a characteristic grate can be felt which is diagnostic of the fracture. Percussion of upper teeth results in cracked pot sound. Gu√©rin's sign is present characterised by ecchymosis in the region of greater palatine vessels. Le Fort II and Le Fort III (common) ‚Äî Gross edema of soft tissue over the middle third of the face, bilateral circumorbital ecchymosis, bilateral subconjunctival hemorrhage, epistaxis, CSF rhinorrhoea, dish face deformity, diplopia, enophthalmos, cracked pot sound. Le Fort II ‚Äî Step deformity at infraorbital margin, mobile mid face, anesthesia or paresthesia of cheek. Le Fort III ‚Äî Tenderness and separation at frontozygomatic suture, lengthening of face, depression of ocular levels (enophthalmos), hooding of eyes, and tilting of occlusal plane, an imaginary curved plane between the edges of the incisors and the tips of the posterior teeth. As a result, there is gagging on the side of injury.  Diagnosis  A 3-D CT reconstruction showing a Le Fort type 1 fracture ( fracture line is marked by an arrow ) Diagnosis is suspected by physical exam and history, in which, classically, the hard and soft palate of the midface are mobile with respect to the remainder of facial structures. This finding can be inconsistent due to the midfacial bleeding and swelling that typically accompany such injuries, and so confirmation is usually needed by radiograph or CT. = Classification = There are three types of Le Fort fractures. As the classification increases, the anatomic level of the maxillary fracture ascends from inferior to superior with respect to the maxilla: *Le Fort I fracture (horizontal), otherwise known as a floating palate, may result from a force of injury directed low on the maxillary alveolar rim, or upper dental row, in a downward direction. The essential component of these fractures, in addition to pterygoid plate involvement, is involvement of the lateral bony margin of the nasal opening. They also involve the medial and lateral buttresses, or walls, of the maxillary sinus, traveling through the face just above the alveolar ridge of the upper dental row. At the midline, the inferior nasal septum is involved. Historically, it has also been referred to as a Gu√©rin fracture, although this name is less commonly used in practice. *Le Fort II fracture (pyramidal) may result from a blow to the lower or mid maxillary area. In addition to pterygoid plate disruption, their distinguishing component is involvement of inferior orbital rim. When viewed from the front, the fracture is classically shaped like a pyramid. It extends from the nasal bridge at or below the nasofrontal suture through the superior medial wall of the maxilla, inferolaterally through the lacrimal bones which contain the tear ducts, and inferior orbital floor through or near the infraorbital foramen. *Le Fort III fracture (transverse), otherwise known as craniofacial dissociation, may follow impact to the nasal bridge or upper maxilla. The salient feature of these fractures, beyond pterygoid plate involvement, is that they invariably involve the zygomatic arch, or cheek bone. These fractures begin at the nasofrontal and frontomaxillary sutures and extend posteriorly along the medial wall of the orbit, through the nasolacrimal groove and ethmoid air cells. The sphenoid is thickened posteriorly, limiting fracture extension into the optic canal. Instead, the fracture continues along the orbital floor and infraorbital fissure, continuing through the lateral orbital wall to the zygomaticofrontal junction and zygomatic arch. Within the nose, the fracture extends through the base of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid air cells, the vomer, which are both part of the nasal septum. As with the other fractures, it also involves the junction of the pterygoids with the maxillary sinuses. CSF rhinorrhea, or leakage of the nutrient laden fluid that bathes the brain, is more commonly seen with these injuries due to ethmoid air cell disruption, as the air cells are located immediately beneath the skull base. Treatment Treatment is surgical, and usually is able to be performed once life-threatening injuries are stabilized, to allow the patient to survive the general anesthesia needed for maxillofacial surgery. First a frontal bar is used, which refers to the thickened frontal bone above the frontonasal sutures and the superior orbital rim. The facial bones are suspended from the bar by open reduction and internal fixation with titanium plates and screws, and each fracture is fixed, first at its superior attachment to the bar, then at the inferior attachment to the displaced bone. For stability, the zygomaticofrontal suture is usually replaced first, and the palate and alveolar ridge are usually fixed last. Finally, after the horizontal and vertical maxillary buttresses are stabilized, the orbital fractures are fixed last.

As such, a local volatility model is a generalisation of the Black‚ÄìScholes model, where the volatility is a constant (i.e. a trivial function of S_t and t ). Formulation In mathematical finance, the asset St that underlies a financial derivative, is typically assumed to follow a stochastic differential equation of the form : dS_t = (r_t-d_t) S_t\\\\,dt + \\\\sigma_t S_t\\\\,dW_t , where r_t is the instantaneous risk free rate, giving an average local direction to the dynamics, and W_t is a Wiener process, representing the inflow of randomness into the dynamics. The amplitude of this randomness is measured by the instant volatility \\\\sigma_t. In the simplest model i.e. the Black‚ÄìScholes model, \\\\sigma_t is assumed to be constant; in reality, the realized volatility of an underlying actually varies with time. When such volatility has a randomness of its own‚Äîoften described by a different equation driven by a different W‚Äîthe model above is called a stochastic volatility model. And when such volatility is merely a function of the current asset level St and of time t, we have a local volatility model. The local volatility model is a useful simplification of the stochastic volatility model. \\"Local volatility\\" is thus a term used in quantitative finance to denote the set of diffusion coefficients, \\\\sigma_t = \\\\sigma(S_t,t), that are consistent with market prices for all options on a given underlying. This model is used to calculate exotic option valuations which are consistent with observed prices of vanilla options. Development The concept of a local volatility was developed when Bruno Dupire and Emanuel Derman and Iraj Kani noted that there is a unique diffusion process consistent with the risk neutral densities derived from the market prices of European options. Derman and Kani described and implemented a local volatility function to model instantaneous volatility. They used this function at each node in a binomial options pricing model. The tree successfully produced option valuations consistent with all market prices across strikes and expirations. The Derman- Kani model was thus formulated with discrete time and stock-price steps. (Derman and Kani produced what is called an \\"implied binomial tree\\"; with Neil Chriss they extended this to an implied trinomial tree.) The key continuous- time equations used in local volatility models were developed by Bruno Dupire in 1994. Dupire's equation states : \\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial T} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2(K,T; S_0)K^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2C}{\\\\partial K^2}-(r - d)K \\\\frac{\\\\partial C}{\\\\partial K} - dC There exist few known parametrisation of the volatility surface based on the Heston model (Sch√∂nbucher, SVI and gSVI) as well as their de-arbitraging methodologies.http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1002/wilm.10201?locale=en =Derivation= Given the price of the asset S_t governed by the risk neutral SDE : dS_t = (r-d)S_t dt + \\\\sigma(t,S_t)S_t dW_t The transition probability p(t,S_t) conditional to S_0 satisfies the forward Kolmogorov equation (also known as Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation) : p_t = -[(r-d)s\\\\,p]_s + \\\\frac{1}{2}[(\\\\sigma s)^2p]_{ss} Because of the Martingale pricing theorem, the price of a call option with maturity T and strike K is :\\\\begin{align} C &= e^{-rT} \\\\mathbb{E}^Q[(S_T-K)^+] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= e^{-rT} \\\\int_K^{\\\\infty} (s-K)\\\\, p\\\\, ds \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= e^{-rT} \\\\int_K^{\\\\infty} s \\\\,p \\\\,ds - K\\\\,e^{-rT} \\\\int_K^{\\\\infty} p\\\\, ds \\\\end{align} Differentiating the price of a call option with respect to K : C_K = -e^{-rT} \\\\int_K^{\\\\infty} p ds and replacing in the formula for the price of a call option and rearranging terms : e^{-rT} \\\\int_K^{\\\\infty} s\\\\, p\\\\, ds = C - K\\\\,C_K Differentiating the price of a call option with respect to K twice : C_{KK} = e^{-rT} p Differentiating the price of a call option with respect to T yields : C_T = -r\\\\,C + e^{-rT} \\\\int_K^{\\\\infty} (s-K) p_T ds using the Forward Kolmogorov equation : C_T = -r\\\\,C -e^{-rT} \\\\int_K^{\\\\infty} (s-K) [(r-d)s\\\\,p]_s \\\\,ds + \\\\frac{1}{2}e^{-rT}\\\\int_K^{\\\\infty} (s-K) [(\\\\sigma s)^2\\\\,p]_{ss}\\\\, ds integrating by parts the first integral once and the second integral twice : C_T = -r\\\\,C + (r-d) e^{-rT} \\\\int_K^{\\\\infty} s\\\\,p\\\\, ds + \\\\frac{1}{2} e^{-rT} (\\\\sigma K)^2\\\\,p using the formulas derived differentiating the price of a call option with respect to K :\\\\begin{align} C_T &= -r\\\\,C + (r-d) (C - K\\\\,C_K) + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2 K^2 C_{KK} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= - (r-d) K\\\\,C_K -d\\\\,C + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sigma^2 K^2 C_{KK} \\\\end{align} Use Local volatility models are useful in any options market in which the underlying's volatility is predominantly a function of the level of the underlying, interest-rate derivatives for example. Time-invariant local volatilities are supposedly inconsistent with the dynamics of the equity index implied volatility surface, but see , who claims that such models provide the best average hedge for equity index options. Local volatility models are nonetheless useful in the formulation of stochastic volatility models. Local volatility models have a number of attractive features. Because the only source of randomness is the stock price, local volatility models are easy to calibrate. Numerous calibration methods are developed to deal with the McKean- Vlasov processes including the most used particle and bin approach. Also, they lead to complete markets where hedging can be based only on the underlying asset. The general non-parametric approach by Dupire is however problematic, as one needs to arbitrarily pre-interpolate the input implied volatility surface before applying the method. Alternative parametric approaches have been proposed, notably the highly tractable mixture dynamical local volatility models by Damiano Brigo and Fabio Mercurio. Since in local volatility models the volatility is a deterministic function of the random stock price, local volatility models are not very well used to price cliquet options or forward start options, whose values depend specifically on the random nature of volatility itself.

Route description  State Route 266 in Norene, Tennessee =Rutherford County= SR 266 begins in Rutherford County in Smyrna at an interchange with I-24 (Exit 66). It goes east as a four-lane divided highway called Sam Ridley Parkway, a major thoroughfare featuring numerous strip malls, apartments, a high school, and a hospital. It has an interchange with US 41/US 70S/SR 1 (N Lowry Street) on the southern edge of Smyrna Airport. SR 266 then becomes undivided and continues east to an intersection with SR 102 (Nissan Drive), where Sam Ridley Parkway officially end and SR 266 continues east as Jefferson Pike. The highway then narrows to 2-lanes and crosses a bridge over the Stones River just south of Percy Priest Lake, where it leaves Smyrna. SR 266 then passes through rural areas to come to have an interchange with I-840 (Exit 61) before passing through Walterhill and having an intersection with US 231/SR 10. SR 266 then continues east through farmland to pass through Lascassas, where it has a short concurrency with SR 96 before turning northward and crossing into Wilson County. =Wilson County= SR 266 winds its way northward through farmland as Cainsville Road, where it passes through Norene and has an intersection with SR 265. The highway then enters Lebanon and passes through an industrial area and has an intersection with Maddox-Simpson Parkway before crossing an overpass over I-40. SR 266 continues north through industrial areas before entering downtown at an intersection with Tennessee Boulevard, where it becomes S College Street. It goes north to have an intersection with US 70 Bus./SR 24 (E Main Street), where it becomes N College Street, before coming to an end at an intersection with US 70/SR 26 (E High Street) in a business district.

For example, suppose a study is conducted to measure the impact of a drug on mortality rate. In such a study, it may be known that an individual's age at death is at least 75 years (but may be more). Such a situation could occur if the individual withdrew from the study at age 75, or if the individual is currently alive at the age of 75. Censoring also occurs when a value occurs outside the range of a measuring instrument. For example, a bathroom scale might only measure up to . If a individual is weighed using the scale, the observer would only know that the individual's weight is at least . The problem of censored data, in which the observed value of some variable is partially known, is related to the problem of missing data, where the observed value of some variable is unknown. Censoring should not be confused with the related idea truncation. With censoring, observations result either in knowing the exact value that applies, or in knowing that the value lies within an interval. With truncation, observations never result in values outside a given range: values in the population outside the range are never seen or never recorded if they are seen. Note that in statistics, truncation is not the same as rounding. Types  * Left censoring - a data point is below a certain value but it is unknown by how much. * Interval censoring - a data point is somewhere on an interval between two values. * Right censoring - a data point is above a certain value but it is unknown by how much. * Type I censoring occurs if an experiment has a set number of subjects or items and stops the experiment at a predetermined time, at which point any subjects remaining are right-censored. * Type II censoring occurs if an experiment has a set number of subjects or items and stops the experiment when a predetermined number are observed to have failed; the remaining subjects are then right-censored. * Random (or non-informative) censoring is when each subject has a censoring time that is statistically independent of their failure time. The observed value is the minimum of the censoring and failure times; subjects whose failure time is greater than their censoring time are right-censored. Interval censoring can occur when observing a value requires follow-ups or inspections. Left and right censoring are special cases of interval censoring, with the beginning of the interval at zero or the end at infinity, respectively. Estimation methods for using left-censored data vary, and not all methods of estimation may be applicable to, or the most reliable, for all data sets. A common misconception with time interval data is to class as left censored intervals where the start time is unknown. In these cases we have a lower bound on the time interval, thus the data is right censored (despite the fact that the missing start point is to the left of the known interval when viewed as a timeline!). Analysis Special techniques may be used to handle censored data. Tests with specific failure times are coded as actual failures; censored data are coded for the type of censoring and the known interval or limit. Special software programs (often reliability oriented) can conduct a maximum likelihood estimation for summary statistics, confidence intervals, etc. =Epidemiology= One of the earliest attempts to analyse a statistical problem involving censored data was Daniel Bernoulli's 1766 analysis of smallpox morbidity and mortality data to demonstrate the efficacy of vaccination. reprinted in Bradley (1971) 21 and Blower (2004) An early paper to use the Kaplan‚ÄìMeier estimator for estimating censored costs was Quesenberry et al. (1989), however this approach was found to be invalid by Lin et al. unless all patients accumulated costs with a common deterministic rate function over time, they proposed an alternative estimation technique known as the Lin estimator. =Operating life testing= replicate tests resulting in four failures and one suspended time. Reliability testing often consists of conducting a test on an item (under specified conditions) to determine the time it takes for a failure to occur. * Sometimes a failure is planned and expected but does not occur: operator error, equipment malfunction, test anomaly, etc. The test result was not the desired time-to- failure but can be (and should be) used as a time-to-termination. The use of censored data is unintentional but necessary. * Sometimes engineers plan a test program so that, after a certain time limit or number of failures, all other tests will be terminated. These suspended times are treated as right- censored data. The use of censored data is intentional. An analysis of the data from replicate tests includes both the times-to-failure for the items that failed and the time-of-test-termination for those that did not fail. =Censored regression= An earlier model for censored regression, the Tobit model, was proposed by James Tobin in 1958. = Likelihood = The likelihood is the probability or probability density of what was observed, viewed as a function of parameters in an assumed model. Suppose we are interested in survival times, T_1, T_2, ..., T_n, but we don't observe T_i for all i. Instead, we observe :(U_i, \\\\delta_i), with U_i = T_i and \\\\delta_i = 1 if T_i is actually observed, and :(U_i, \\\\delta_i), with U_i < T_i and \\\\delta_i = 0 if all we know is that T_i is longer than U_i. When T_i > U_i, U_i is called the censoring time.. If the censoring times are all known constants, then the likelihood is :L = \\\\prod_{i, \\\\delta_i = 1} f(u_i) \\\\prod_{i, \\\\delta_i=0} S(u_i) where f(u_i) = the probability density function evaluated at u_i, and S(u_i) = the probability that T_i is greater than u_i, called the survival function. This can be simplified by defining the hazard function, the instantaneous force of mortality, as :\\\\lambda(u) = f(u)/S(u) so :f(u) = \\\\lambda(u)S(u). Then :L = \\\\prod_i \\\\lambda(u_i)^{\\\\delta_i} S(u_i). For the exponential distribution, this becomes even simpler, because the hazard rate, \\\\lambda, is constant, and S(u) = \\\\exp(-\\\\lambda u). Then: :L(\\\\lambda) = \\\\lambda^k \\\\exp (-\\\\lambda \\\\sum{u_i}), where k = \\\\sum{\\\\delta_i}. From this we easily compute \\\\hat{\\\\lambda}, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of \\\\lambda, as follows: :l(\\\\lambda) = \\\\log(L(\\\\lambda)) = k \\\\log(\\\\lambda) - \\\\lambda \\\\sum{u_i}. Then :dl / d\\\\lambda = k/\\\\lambda - \\\\sum{u_i}. We set this to 0 and solve for \\\\lambda to get: :\\\\hat \\\\lambda = k / \\\\sum u_i. Equivalently, the mean time to failure is: :1 / \\\\hat\\\\lambda = \\\\sum u_i / k. This differs from the standard MLE for the exponential distribution in that the any censored observations are considered only in the numerator.

(The city has rapidly been annexing this land in recent years.) After an interchange with I-24, SR 102 becomes Lee Victory Parkway, named after a prominent local politician. There is a one-quadrant interchange with Old Nashville Highway. After an interchange with US 41/US 70S, SR 102 becomes Nissan Drive, named for the massive Nissan automobile manufacturing facility that faces the east side of the highway. The highway's northern terminus is at Jefferson Pike; northbound traffic on SR 102 continues westbound on Sam Ridley Parkway/SR 266 on its way back towards I-24. Thus, the combination of SR 102 and SR 266 forms a partial beltway around Smyrna.

Until 2011, it was the home field of the Arizona Wildcats of the Pac-10 Conference. Opened in 1967 and originally called \\"Wildcat Field,\\" the stadium was named after Frank Sancet (head coach from 1950‚Äì72) in 1986, and was renamed in 2004 to include former head coach Jerry Kindall. Beginning in the 2012 season, the Wildcat baseball team plays at Hi Corbett Field, a former spring training facility located about three miles southeast of campus; the Wildcat football program has been using Jerry Kindall Field as a football practice facility since the 2012 preseason, and the 2013 football spring game was held there, due to renovations at Arizona Stadium. The stadium was fully demolished in 2018 to clear space for a new indoor sports center.http://tucson.com/sports/greghansen/hansen-s-sunday-notebook-game-day- at-arizona-stadium-should/collection_d9365ba2-66dd-11e8-9d9e-c33aaa96fd38.html A monument to Jerry Kindall and Frank Sancet was erected on the site of the stadium.https://www.azdesertswarm.com/arizona- baseball/2018/4/21/17267238/jerry-kindall-frank-sancet-monument-site-new- indoor-sports-center-facility-football-design-pictues Stadium facts * Surface: The outfield was Bermuda, while the infield was a Tifgreen (said to be durable in hot weather, a factor during the baseball season in Tucson). The infield consisted of Stabilizer Red dirt, and Stabilizer Clay was used around home plate and on the mound. A new irrigation system was installed in 2007 for the infield grass and dirt. The grounds crews overseeded the field in November with a Perennial Rye, Arnold Palmer II, to prepare it for the season. The area in front of the dugouts was AstroTurf. * Field dimensions: 360 feet (110 m) down each foul line, 378 feet (115 m) to the power alleys and 400 feet (122 m) to center field. * Through 2008, Arizona posted a 32-year mark of 820-343-3 (.705) in more than 1,100 games at Sancet Stadium. UA had just three losing records at Sancet Stadium and nearly reached perfection in 1974 with a 37-1 home campaign. The stadium was the site of four NCAA Regionals (1979, '80, '89 and '92). * Ballpark traditions included the \\"Sixth Street Slam\\", when an Arizona player hit it over the right field fence and onto traffic on Tucson's 6th Street. * The visitors' section of the stands was often occupied by members of the Hot Corner, the baseball contingent of the Zona Zoo, Arizona's athletics student section. This tradition has continued at Hi Corbett Field. Changes to Sancet Stadium The field was first modernized in 1975. In 1988, a $160,000 scoreboard, complete with a computerized message center, was purchased through advertising contracts with Gatorade and The Arizona Daily Star. Larger dugouts were added in 1990, and the stadium got its own \\"Green Monster\\" in 1995 with the installation of a wall designed to block traffic lights from adjacent Sixth Street during night games. A new, expanded press box was completed in 1997. Changes made in time for the 2006 season included an 11 x 20 ft videoboard, new batting cages and a lawn seating area (similar to those featured in some minor league, and major league spring training, ballparks); the protective wall in right field was turned into the \\"College World Series\\" wall, commemorating the Wildcat baseball program's fifteen appearances (to that date) in the CWS in Omaha, including three national championship titles in 1976, 1980, and 1986, all coached by Jerry Kindall. The Wildcats also won in 2012, their first year not at Sancet Stadium.

Specifically, it is used to treat multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) along with other medications for tuberculosis. It is used by mouth. Common side effects include nausea, joint pains, headaches, and chest pain. Serious side effects include QT prolongation, liver dysfunction, and an increased risk of death. While harm during pregnancy has not been found, it has not been well studied in this population. It is in the diarylquinoline antimycobacterial class of medications. It works by blocking the ability of M. tuberculosis to make adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). Bedaquiline was approved for medical use in the United States in 2012. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The cost for six months is approximately US$900 in low-income countries, US$3,000 in middle-income countries, and US$30,000 in high-income countries. Medical uses Its use was approved in December 2012 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in tuberculosis (TB) treatment, as part of a Fast-Track accelerated approval, for use only in cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and the more resistant extensively drug resistant tuberculosis. both the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have recommended (provisionally) that bedaquiline be reserved for people with multidrug- resistant tuberculosis when an otherwise recommended regimen cannot be designed. =Clinical trials= Bedaquiline has been studied in phase IIb studies for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis while phase III studies are currently underway. It has been shown to improve cure rates of smear-positive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, though with some concern for increased rates of death (further detailed in the Adverse effects section). Small studies have also examined its use as salvage therapy for non- tuberculous mycobacterial infections. It is a component of the experimental BPaMZ combination treatment (bedaquiline + pretomanid + moxifloxacin + pyrazinamide).BPaMZ @ TB Alliance Two new drug therapies might cure every form of tuberculosis. Feb 2017 Side effects The most common side effects of bedaquiline in studies were nausea, joint and chest pain, and headache. The drug also has a black-box warning for increased risk of death and arrhythmias, as it may prolong the QT interval by blocking the hERG channel.Drugs.com: Sirturo Side Effects Everyone on bedaquiline should have monitoring with a baseline and repeated ECGs. If a person has a QTcF of > 500 ms or a significant ventricular arrythmia, bedaquiline and other QT prolonging drugs should be stopped. There is considerable controversy over the approval for the drug, as one of the largest studies to date had more deaths in the group receiving bedaquiline that those receiving placebo. Ten deaths occurred in the bedaquiline group out of 79, while two occurred in the placebo group, out of 81. Of the 10 deaths on bedaquiline, one was due to a motor vehicle accident, five were judged as due to progression of the underlying tuberculosis and three were well after the person had stopped receiving bedaquiline. However, there is still significant concern for the higher mortality in people treated with bedaquiline, leading to the recommendation to limit its use to situations where a four drug regimen cannot otherwise be constructed, limit use with other medications that prolong the QT interval, and the placement of a prominent black box warning. Drug interactions Bedaquiline should not be co-administered with other drugs that are strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4, the liver enzyme responsible for oxidative metabolism of the drug. Co- administration with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, results in a 52% decrease in the AUC of the drug. This reduces the exposure of the body to the drug and decreases the antibacterial effect. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, results in a 22% increase in the AUC, and potentially an increase in the rate of adverse effects experienced Since bedaquiline can also prolong the QT interval, use of other QT prolonging drugs should be avoided. Other medications for tuberculosis that can prolong the QT interval include fluoroquinolones and clofazimine. Mechanism of action Bedaquiline blocks the proton pump for ATP synthase of mycobacteria. It is the first member of a new class of drugs called the diarylquinolines. Bedaquiline is bactericidal. ATP production is required for cellular energy production and its loss leads inhibition of mycobacterial growth within hours of the addition of bedaquiline. The onset of bedaquiline-induced mycobacterial cell death does not occur until several days after treatment, but nonetheless kills consistently thereafter. = Resistance = The specific part of ATP synthase affected by bedaquiline is subunit c which is encoded by the gene atpE. Mutations in atpE can lead to resistance. Mutations in drug efflux pumps have also been linked to resistance. History Bedaquiline was described for the first time in 2004 at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) meeting, after the drug had been in development for over seven years. It was discovered by a team led by Koen Andries at Janssen Pharmaceutica. Bedaquiline was approved for medical use in the United States in 2012. It is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson (J&J;), who sought accelerated approval of the drug, a type of temporary approval for diseases lacking other viable treatment options. By gaining approval for a drug that treats a neglected disease, J&J; is now able to request expedited FDA review of a future drug. When it was approved by the FDA on 28 December 2012, it was the first new medicine for TB in more than forty years. In 2016, the WHO came under criticism for recommending it as an essential medicine. The WHO TB program director has pointed out that Janssen will donate $30 million worth (30,000 treatment courses) of bedaquiline over a 4-year period.

It is generally used together with bedaquiline and linezolid. It is taken by mouth. The most common side effects include nerve damage, acne, vomiting, headache, low blood sugar, diarrhea, and liver inflammation. It is in the nitroimidazole class of medications. Pretomanid was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2019, and in the European Union in July 2020. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. Pretomanid was developed by TB Alliance. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication.  Medical uses  Pretomanid is indicated in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, in adults, for the treatment of pulmonary extensively drug resistant (XDR), or treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB).  History  Pretomanid is the generic, nonproprietary name for the novel anti-bacterial drug compound formerly called PA-824. Pretomanid is referred to as \\"Pa\\" in regimen abbreviations, such as BPaL. The \\"preto\\" prefix of the compound's name honors Pretoria, South Africa, the home of a TB Alliance clinical development office where much of the drug's development took place. The \\"manid\\" suffix is used to group compounds with similar chemical structures. This class of drug is variously referred to as nitroimidazoles, nitroimidazooxazines or nitroimidazopyrans. Development of this compound was initiated because of the urgent need for new antibacterial drugs effective against resistant strains of tuberculosis. Also, current anti- TB drugs are mainly effective against replicating and metabolically active bacteria, creating a need for drugs effective against persisting or latent bacterial infections as often occur in patients with tuberculosis. =Discovery and pre-clinical development= Pretomanid was first identified in 2000, in a series of 100 nitroimidazopyran derivatives synthesized and tested for antitubercular activity, by PathoGenesis (now a subsidiary of Novartis). Importantly, pretomanid has activity against static M. tuberculosis isolates that survive under anaerobic conditions, with bactericidal activity comparable to that of the existing drug metronidazole. Pretomanid requires metabolic activation by Mycobacterium for antibacterial activity. Pretomanid was not the most potent compound in the series against cultures of M. tuberculosis, but it was the most active in infected mice after oral administration. Oral pretomanid was active against tuberculosis in mice and guinea pigs at safely tolerated dosages for up to 28 days. =Limited FDA approval= The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pretomanid only in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid for treatment of a limited and specific population of adults with extensively drug resistant, treatment- intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. Pretomanid was approved under the Limited Population Pathway (LPAD pathway) for antibacterial and antifungal drugs. The LPAD Pathway was established by Congress under the 21st Century Cures Act to expedite development and approval of antibacterial and antifungal drugs to treat serious or life-threatening infections in a limited population of patients with unmet need. Pretomanid is only the third tuberculosis drug to receive FDA approval in more than 40 years. The FDA granted Pretomanid priority review and orphan drug designation. The FDA granted The Global Alliance for TB Drug Development (TB Alliance) the approval of Pretomanid and a Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on August 7, 1954, and stars Tweety and Sylvester. A later short, Devil's Feud Cake (1963), was re-titled Satan's Waitin when it was featured as part of The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie. Plot Sylvester is in pursuit of Tweety, chasing him to the top of a building. Sylvester falls from the building (first he grabs some of Tweety's tail feathers to help him fly, but Tweety is able to take them back), crashes to the sidewalk and dies. The spirit of his first life approaches two escalators and takes the \\"down\\" (to Hell) one (since the one going \\"up\\" (to Heaven) is roped off) and ends up in Hell. He is greeted by a Satanic bulldog (Hector the Bulldog), who realizes he must goad Sylvester into giving up his remaining eight lives, so he asks life #1 to sit on a bench to wait for the others. Sylvester wakes up and Tweety tells him he is in trouble for breaking the sidewalk (which cracked upon impact of his earlier fall). Sylvester has had enough of Tweety and tells him to get lost. The bulldog's spirit reminds him that he has eight lives left, so Sylvester starts the chase up again. He chases Tweety around a moving steamroller but gets flattened, sending life #2 through the street and into Hell. The flat #2 gets up and sits beside #1. The chase then continues through an amusement park. They both run into a lion's mouth entranceway to the fun house, but Sylvester steps back out, takes one look at the lion and is literally \\"frightened to death\\". A scared-white-as-a- ghost life #3 takes his place on the waiting bench; the cat recovers and finds Tweety amongst the moving targets in a shooting gallery. He climbs into the targets to get at his prey but is shot several times in rapid succession. With each shot (except the first two), lives 4 through 7 pop up on the bench. Sylvester bursts out of the gallery (narrowly missing another shot) and sees Tweety heading towards the roller coaster. As Tweety sits in the front seat proclaiming \\"That puddy tat will never find me here\\", the cat takes the seat directly behind him. The train ascends the lift hill and proceeds to go through the drops and turns. Near the end of the ride on a straight track, Sylvester stands up. Just as he is about to pummel an unsuspecting Tweety with a club, he slams into the entranceway of a tunnel. Upon impact, the train carrying life #8 in the front seat runs through the tunnel and down Hell's twisted escalator conveyor belt route that took Sylvester's first life down earlier. Recovering, Sylvester realizes that he only has one life left. The bulldog again goads him to go after Tweety, but Sylvester screams \\"No, no, no! I don't want him! I do-o-o-on't want him!\\" and runs off. He decides to move into a bank vault with several cans of food, commenting that he will be safe in there and that nothing can happen to him.

They have traditionally focused on export markets outside Europe and won several awards in the late 19th century, including first place in the 1866 Neuchatel observatory timing accuracy competition. This was viewed by the company as an important marketing strategy for increasing the brand's value, since the Neuchatel observatory was famed at the time for its timekeeping accuracy.  History  In 1876 they were awarded the \\"Premium Award\\" in Philadelphia, USA, and, in 1878, won the only \\"Precious Premium Award\\" given to the Swiss watch and clock industry in Paris, France that year. The company was run by the eponymous Borel family until 1975 when, owing to the 'Quartz crisis' affecting the entire Swiss watchmaking industry, it was sold on and became a member of the Synchron Group which consisted also of Cyma and Doxa. In 1997, Ernest Borel was purchased by a group of investors from China.

Another picture of the monastery The Kirchberg convent (also the Monastery Kirchberg) is a monastery located in Sulz am Neckar in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. The monastery is considered to be one of the most historically important religious buildings in Baden-Wuerttemberg. It also ranks as one of the oldest, having been built in the early 13th century, and one of the first female church houses in central Europe.  History  The Kirchberg monastery was a convent built in 1237, on the site of a former castle. In 1245 the monastery was recognised by Pope Innocent IV. Over roughly the same period, the number of nuns entering the convent went from around ten to sixty. This rise in the population of the convent can be credited in part to the apparent surge of 'religious awareness', with more women (of every class) wanting to live the life of a nun or at least one of piety in order to ensure that they remained spiritually healthy. The convent continued its religious work for the next 500 years, despite the many changes that occurred in the area. However, after a secularisation that occurred in 1806, the monastery was virtually condemned to disuse: the nuns that were there were allowed to remain for the rest of their lives, but no more were allowed to join. The last nun left the monastery in 1865.  Today  Today, the monastery is used as any normal church house. It is the centre of the societies of the Berneuchen Movement. Every morning, at 7:45am, a service of praise is held. At noon, a prayer service is held. Another is held at 6pm, and then at 9pm. These sessions are respectively known as Lauds, Sext, Vespers and Compline. Celebration of Eucharist also takes place at the monastery every Sunday and Thursday. As of 2007, the minister of the Kirchberg monastery is pastor Peter Schwarz.

Unlike many of her class, which received only numbers and were disposed of after World War II, she survived long enough to be named. On 1 July 1955, all LSTs still in commission were named for US counties or parishes; LST-1080 was given the name Pender County, after a county in North Carolina. LST-1080 was laid down on 10 November 1944 at Hingham, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard, Inc.; launched on 2 May 1945; and commissioned on 29 May 1945. After shakedown, LST-1080 sailed for the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal. The landing ship performed logistics missions and service force lifts in the Pacific Ocean area throughout the remainder of World War II. After cessation of hostilities, she sailed for the west coast and upon arrival there reported to Columbia River Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, Astoria, Oregon for inactivation. She was placed out of commission in reserve 29 August 1946 and berthed in the Columbia River at Tongue Point. In June 1950 the outbreak of hostilities in Korea caused the reactivation of many vessels of the mothball fleet, including LST-1080. She recommissioned 3 October 1950 and after a short shakedown cruise sailed for the Far East in February 1951, arriving in time to participate in the UN counteroffensive which pushed North Korean and Chinese armies back beyond the 38th parallel to a point where they were held for the remainder of the Korean War. During this time LST-1080 participated in many logistics and personnel lifts and made numerous voyages to and from the combat zone in Korea and the support areas in Japan. The ship returned to the U.S. in early 1952. After overhaul, she again sailed for the Far East in August 1952 to support United Nations forces defending against intensive communist offensive operations. She continued this duty until she sailed for home shortly before the cessation of hostilities. Upon arrival in the U.S., she was assigned to various training missions on the west coast. In 1954, LST-1080 was again in the Far East, as a service force transport ferrying supplies and personnel to the United Nations units engaged in the task of reconstructing war-torn Korea. On 31 August 1954, she steamed out of Yokosuka, Japan, bound for Indo-China to participate in operation \\"Passage to Freedom\\" and made several trips from Haiphong to Tourane, Nha Trang and Saigon ferrying indigenous and French refugees and army personnel out of the area north of the 14th parallel. After leaving Indo-China 13 November 1954, LST-1080 visited Manila and Hong Kong before returning to the United States in February 1955. On 1 July 1955, LST-1080 was named Pender County (LST-1080). She operated out of San Diego sailing for the Far East in the fall of 1956. She arrived at Kobe, Japan, 2 October 1956 and thereafter made four training cruises to areas of Okinawa and Iwo Jima to participate in amphibious warfare landing and invasion maneuvers with elements of the United States Marine Corps and Army. On 23 January 1957, she departed Yokosuka for home, arriving San Diego 21 February 1957. On 18 July 1957, she sailed for training maneuvers in the Hawaiian area, returning to San Diego for local operations 31 August 1957. On 27 September 1957, Pender County arrived at Long Beach, California, for inactivation. On 2 October she was placed in commission in reserve, assigned to the Long Beach Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet and decommissioned 2 January 1958. She was struck from the Navy List 6 February 1959. Under provisions of the Military Assistance Program, she was transferred to the Republic of Korea January 1959, and served the ROK navy as Hwa San (LST-816). LST-1080 earned four battle stars for Korean War service.  ROKS Hwa San  The ship was transferred to the Republic of Korea in January 1959, and renamed ROKS Hwa San (LST-816). She was later redesignated LST-679. She was still in service in 1999.

Life \\"Belt\\" began playing with the Desperadoes Steel Orchestra in the early '60s and became one of that orchestra's top steelpan musicians. At the Champs of Champs Classical Steel Orchestra Music Festival, which was held at Queens Hall in 1967 at Trinidad, Mr. Botus' stick (mallet) fell, but like a gunfighter in the old West, he drew his spare and played his part almost to perfection. In 1969, Botus moved to New York and in 1975 co-founded \\"Despers USA\\". In the late 1970s, he moved to Boston where he formed \\"Real Steel\\". Real Steel toured North America and won the International Music Festival in 1983. Real Steel was not only the only steel band in New England to win a competition outside of New England, but the only steel band to win a music competition outside of steel band competitions. Botus also wrote and performed steel drum music on the soundtrack to The Brother from Another Planet. He moved back to Trinidad in 1985, but returned when he would achieve his biggest feat and the biggest feat in steel band in Brooklyn.

She was now back in Oakdale with Johnny, who has gotten sick again and needs a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible. The two girls teamed up to take blood tests from every person related to Johnny, in order to find a match for the transplant. They soon discovered Katie was the perfect match, and Lucy took off to tell Katie. When she got back, Dusty was in the hotel room, having heard about her return and demanding Johnny back. However, Johnny's temperature was rising again and the three went to the hospital.

Unfortunately, Katie told Craig about Lucy's return with Johnny, and Craig went to the hospital where Johnny had the procedure. While Craig, at first, had forgiven Lucy for taking off two years ago, he later overheard a conversation between his daughter and Dusty, discussing their plan to flee Oakdale. Craig called Margo with the request to arrest Lucy for kidnapping. After Craig called Margo to arrest Lucy for kidnapping Dusty asked Josie to listen for any news. When the police are after Lucy, Dusty asked Lucy to go to the warehouse and stay there. Together they plan for Lucy to escape and Josie gives Margo and Craig the place where they are but they were gone. Lucy quickly went to see Johnny before she left town promising him she would come back. Dusty arranges the plane and kissed briefly before Lucy left Oakdale.

Quality control is a process by which entities review the quality of all factors involved in production. Quality is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils a need or expectation that is stated, general implied or obligatory.Hoyle D. ISO 9000 quality systems handbook. Butterworth-Heineman 2001;p.654 Genetic algorithms are search algorithms, based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics.Goldberg DE. Genetic algorithms in search, optimization and machine learning. Addison-Wesley 1989; p.1. Quality control Alternative quality controlDuncan AJ. Quality control and industrial statistics. Irwin 1986;pp.1-1123. (QC) procedures can be applied on a process to test statistically the null hypothesis, that the process conforms to the quality requirements, therefore that the process is in control, against the alternative, that the process is out of control. When a true null hypothesis is rejected, a statistical type I error is committed. We have then a false rejection of a run of the process. The probability of a type I error is called probability of false rejection. When a false null hypothesis is accepted, a statistical type II error is committed. We fail then to detect a significant change in the process. The probability of rejection of a false null hypothesis equals the probability of detection of the nonconformity of the process to the quality requirements. The QC procedure to be designed or optimized can be formulated as: Q1(n1,X1)# Q2(n2,X2) #...# Qq(nq,Xq) (1) where Qi(ni,Xi) denotes a statistical decision rule, ni denotes the size of the sample Si, that is the number of the samples the rule is applied upon, and Xi denotes the vector of the rule specific parameters, including the decision limits. Each symbol # denotes either the Boolean operator AND or the operator OR. Obviously, for # denoting AND, and for n1 < n2 <...< nq, that is for S1 \\\\subset S2 \\\\subset ....\\\\subset Sq, the (1) denotes a q-sampling QC procedure. Each statistical decision rule is evaluated by calculating the respective statistic of a monitored variable of samples taken from the process. Then, if the statistic is out of the interval between the decision limits, the decision rule is considered to be true. Many statistics can be used, including the following: a single value of the variable of a sample, the range, the mean, and the standard deviation of the values of the variable of the samples, the cumulative sum, the smoothed mean, and the smoothed standard deviation. Finally, the QC procedure is evaluated as a Boolean proposition. If it is true, then the null hypothesis is considered to be false, the process is considered to be out of control, and the run is rejected. A quality control procedure is considered to be optimum when it minimizes (or maximizes) a context specific objective function. The objective function depends on the probabilities of detection of the nonconformity of the process and of false rejection. These probabilities depend on the parameters of the quality control procedure (1) and on the probability density functions (see probability density function) of the monitored variables of the process.

Genetic algorithms in search, optimization and machine learning. Addison- Wesley 1989; pp.1-412.Mitchell M. An Introduction to genetic algorithms. The MIT Press 1998;pp.1-221. are robust search algorithms, that do not require knowledge of the objective function to be optimized and search through large spaces quickly. Genetic algorithms have been derived from the processes of the molecular biology of the gene and the evolution of life. Their operators, cross-over, mutation, and reproduction, are isomorphic with the synonymous biological processes. Genetic algorithms have been used to solve a variety of complex optimization problems. Additionally the classifier systems and the genetic programming paradigm have shown us that genetic algorithms can be used for tasks as complex as the program induction. Quality control and genetic algorithms In general, we can not use algebraic methods to optimize the quality control procedures. Usage of enumerative methods would be very tedious, especially with multi-rule procedures, as the number of the points of the parameter space to be searched grows exponentially with the number of the parameters to be optimized. Optimization methods based on the genetic algorithms offer an appealing alternative. Furthermore, the complexity of the design process of novel quality control procedures is obviously greater than the complexity of the optimization of predefined ones. In fact, since 1993, genetic algorithms have been used successfully to optimize and to design novel quality control procedures. Hatjimihail AT.

It obtains licensed map data from the Survey and Mapping Office of the Hong Kong Government. History Centamap was developed by Centaline Property Agency at a cost of HK$6 million. The website was launched on 19 November 1999; within its first four days it had attracted 100,000-page views per day. At the time, it was one of two digital maps of Hong Kong that had been developed using map data from the government, the other being PCCW's YPmap. Centaline had intended to make money from the website using banner advertising, expecting revenue of $1‚Äì1.5 million a year. Features The website shows a single, seamless map of Hong Kong, the Community Map on Internet. The data for the Community Map is obtained from the Survey and Mapping Office of the Hong Kong Government's Lands Department, and it is jointly built by Cable & Wireless HKT's Telecom Directories Limited (TDL), Centaline Property Agency, and a Canadian software house. The website shows the locations of various landmarks, places of interest, and property listings. Standard digital map functions are provided, such as searching by address, building name, street intersection and geographic co-ordinates, as well as panning and zooming the map. The map can be zoomed to a scale as low as 1:500 or as high as 1:10,000. The search function utilised data from the Geographic Information System (GIS). The website also showed census data and photographs of scenic places. An April 2000 review of several digital maps of Hong Kong and Macau in The Asian Wall Street Journal complimented Centamap for having a search facility that allowed users to display, for example, a map showing a hotel by typing the hotel's name. The service was the only one that allowed maps to be easily copied and pasted into other documents. However, the reviewer lamented that the map lacked transport information and displayed only \\"the income and educational levels of the residents in [an] area\\", which was probably not useful to a visitor of Hong Kong. Another review in the South China Morning Post that month noted that Centamap's website had a \\"no-frills\\" design, worked better in Netscape Navigator than Internet Explorer, and had less features than TDL's HKCityMap, which used the same Community Map data. By July 2001, Centamap had added links to government air pollution indexes across the city, the meteorological department's weather predictions and the government department responsible for selling aerial photographs; a review in the International Herald Tribune commented that the site was a good example of how online maps can provide information that is impossible to present on printed maps. Statistics From the website's launch in 1999 to 2003, the average number of monthly page views for its maps increased from 0.1 to 4 million. In November 2003, Centamap was the first mapping service licensed by the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department to disseminate census data at the building group level in addition to other GIS functions. In March 2007, Centamap was the top website in Hong Kong's online travel market, capturing 16.5% of all website visits in the tourism industry.

SMN is found in the cytoplasm of all animal cells and also in the nuclear gems. It functions in transcriptional regulation, telomerase regeneration and cellular trafficking. SMN deficiency, primarily due to mutations in SMN1, results in widespread splicing defects, especially in spinal motor neurons, and is one cause of spinal muscular atrophy. Research also showed a possible role of SMN in neuronal migration and/or differentiation.  Function  The SMN protein contains GEMIN2-binding, Tudor and YG-Box domains. It localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the protein localizes to subnuclear bodies called gems which are found near coiled bodies containing high concentrations of small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). This protein forms heteromeric complexes with proteins such as GEMIN2 and GEMIN4, and also interacts with several proteins known to be involved in the biogenesis of snRNPs, such as hnRNP U protein and the small nucleolar RNA binding protein.  SMN complex  SMN complex refers to the entire multi-protein complex involved in the assembly of snRNPs, the essential components of spliceosomal machinery. The complex, apart from the \\"proper\\" survival of motor neuron protein, includes at least six other proteins (gem-associated protein 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

Live Oak High School is a part of the Livingston Parish School System, and was founded in 1895 as a community school for the residents of Watson, a largely rural area in Livingston Parish. In 2012, the school moved to its current location off of Louisiana Highway 16. The new location allowed the school to grow to accommodate the increase of students in the area. Live Oak High School is a public high school and has open enrollment. Despite its open enrollment, the school consistently produces high test scores and National Merit Semifinalists and Finalists. Live Oak was ranked 25 on the 2019 \\"Louisiana's Best High Schools\\" list by the U.S. News & World Report. Live Oak High School is a member of the Louisiana High School Athletic Association and offers a wide variety of sports and programs. Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs. History Image of faculty and students standing in front of Live Oak High School after the two story version of the school was built in the early 1900s Live Oak School was founded in 1895 when the Reverend Joel Ott donated a parcel of land for a community school. The citizens of Watson built a one-room schoolhouse that was only 500 square feet. The room was built from wood of cypress trees near the Amite River swamps. The small school boasted one front door and six open windows. The school was only open for June, July, and August so that the students could help their families around the house. Around 1900, the residents of Watson started to recognize the importance of higher education. This resulted in the community building a two-story building that had to be rebuilt shortly thereafter because of tornado damage. Nonetheless, the first graduate of Live Oak High School graduated in 1925. Livingston Parish Public Schools desegregated following the 1969 case Dunn v. Livingston Parish School Board.United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. Dunn v. Livingston Parish School Board. 14 Aug. 1970. Open Jurist. The effects of desegregation were larger for Denham Springs High School because Denham Springs was the largest city in the parish. Prior to desegregating, Livingston Parish only had one school for African Americans called West Livingston. As a result, black students were bussed from all over the parish to attend school. A former student later described the bus route as going \\"'as far north as Watson all the way to the St. Helena parish line.'\\"Colombo, Sarah, and Daniel Landry. ‚ÄúAfrican American Oral History Project.‚Äù Livingston Parish Public Library, 10 Dec. 2013, www.mylpl.info/download/Daniel Landry, oral history.pdf. Accessed 12 June 2019. Although a negative response was faced in other parts of the parish, no such response was experienced at Live Oak High School. As the student population continued to grow, another building was needed. By 1973, the school had multiple buildings, a home economics room, and a gym for the high school students and elementary school students who shared the same facilities. Live Oak High School suffered minimal impacts when Hurricane Katrina devastated the state in 2005. Following the collapse of many New Orleans area school systems, Live Oak saw a significant surge in the number of students. By May 2007, voters in the Watson district of Livingston Parish passed a half-cent sales tax to build a new high school. The former campus of Live Oak High School has been converted into Live Oak Junior High and also houses a FEMA shelter. The current high school opened on December 17, 2012, and is located north of the old location on Hwy 16. The school's current location cost $30 million, and faced weather delays from Hurricane Isaac along with delays resulting from copper theft. Despite the delays, the school's opening was only pushed back 4 months which allowed for a smooth transition over the semester break. The school's new campus was also significantly larger than the one at the other school which allows for more students to comfortably attend class. Live Oak High School also played a large role in the return to normalcy following the 2016 floods in Louisiana. Being one of the few high school campuses to not flood in Livingston Parish, Live Oak High School served as a platoon school for Denham Springs High School the fall semester of 2016 which was the most impacted by flooding. At the start of the spring semester, Denham Springs High School was able to return to their original campus despite ongoing renovations and rebuilding efforts.  Enrollment  Live Oak High School's crest that portrays the school's motto of \\"Have Pride, Show Character, and Build Tradition\\" Live Oak High School is a public high school with no admissions requirements. Enrollments is open to residents of Livingston Parish that make up the Watson community. Live Oak High School had 1321 students for the 2016‚Äì2017 school year. The demographics were 1220 (93%) Caucasian, 53 (4%) African American, 40 (3%) Hispanic, 5 (.4%) Asian/Pacific Islander, 1 (.1%) American Indian/Alaskan Native, and 1 (.1%) Two or More Races.

Benson. Rachel Nichols stars as a doctor who leads a group to find survivors of a worldwide pandemic. The film is shot in a first-person POV, similar to first-person shooter video games.  Plot  Lauren Chase, a doctor from New York, comes to Los Angeles to find survivors of a worldwide pandemic. She is assisted by her team, which includes Gunner, Denise, and Wheeler. The movie opens with Dr. Chase being given a tour of the facility that's being used to monitor, treat, and euthanize sufferers of the disease. She is taken through the multi-level patient holding cells, and added into a team of sweepers who search for survivors. Chase is promised a cure should she become infected, and is told not to inform her team if she becomes infected. They immediately set out toward a school rumored to have around 89 plague survivors. On the road to the school, they encounter an uninfected woman begging for help. They hop out of the bus to help, but are ambushed by a group of uninfected desperate to get out of the city. Gunner shoots several of them as the others hop in the bus and take off. Gunner chases after the bus, barely getting on board before it pulls away. After driving a ways, they come across a yellow school bus. Gunner realizes it was a bus from the facility. Gunner forces Wheeler to stop so he can inspect the school bus. Gunner finds his wife, who is dead. He asks Dr. Chase if the infected eat people. Finally arriving at the school the team is able to find supplies. Searching for the survivors, the team comes across a room barricaded from the inside. Once breaking through the doors, they see all of the survivors are dead. After a few seconds, some of the infected wake up and charge at the team. All, except Gunner, escape through a window. Wheeler separates himself from Dr. Chase and Denise, causing them to seek shelter elsewhere. They find shelter in an abandoned store, where Dr. Chase confesses she is really Rebecca Thomas who came to the facility to find her daughter Meghan. Both Denise and Rebecca are ambushed by a Level 5. After a long struggle, Wheeler impales the Level 5, killing it instantly. Wheeler claims he made contact with a Doctor from a previous excursion who has 8 survivors nearby, and they need to return to the facility. Rebecca realizes Wheeler has a bleeding wound on his side and is infected. She makes a deal; he hot wires the ambulance to save the survivors, takes Rebecca to her home to find her daughter, and she will return him to the facility to be treated as a Level 1. Before arriving at the hospital, Denise is hit by a car and kidnapped by Level 3s. With her helmet cam still recording, the infected are shown cutting her open and eating her. Rebecca shoots and kills the infected. Wheeler consoles her and they continue searching for the hospital. Once they reach the survivors and hot wire the ambulance, the Doctor with the survivors knocks out Rebecca, yelling that she isn't Dr. Chase. The survivors escape, causing Wheeler and Rebecca to hot wire a different ambulance. Rebecca and Wheeler finally reach her house. She finds Meghan, tests her blood, and realizes Meghan is infected. While waiting in the ambulance, Wheeler is ambushed by Level 5s. Rebecca, realizing they need to run, has Meghan change into her suit from the facility. Wheeler escapes the ambulance and rushes into the house, causing Rebecca and Meghan to run upstairs. All three escape through a window, but Wheeler is bitten multiple times and can no longer walk. Rebecca is forced to leave him. Rebecca and Meghan make it to the ambulance and rush to the facility. On the way to the facility, Rebecca sees the other ambulance on fire. Finally arriving at the facility, the guards are able to kill multiple infected, but do not recognize Rebecca without her suit from the facility. She pleads with the guards to not shoot her daughter. Rebecca, in turn, is shot multiple times. Meghan is taken into the facility for Level 1 treatment under the impression she is really Dr. Chase.  Cast  * Rachel Nichols as Lauren Chase/Rebecca Thomas * Alfie Allen as Wheeler * Paul Guilfoyle as Doctor Greer * Danielle Rose Russell as Meghan Thomas * Missi Pyle as Denise * Mekhi Phifer as Gunner  Production  Suits came upon the script, which was initially named Viral, at the Blood List, a repository of unproduced horror and thriller scripts. Suits does not consider the film to be found footage and instead says, \\"Rather than a found footage movie, I consider it more as a POV first-person movie.\\" The camera setups were designed to simulate this first-person POV rather than someone who is carrying a camera. Suits said that they did not have a successful formula to follow for such a film, though he watched Maniac and Enter the Void for inspiration. Two camera operators, one female and one male, shot the film. The camera operator of the appropriate sex would substitute for whichever character's POV was represented. Although he was a gamer in his youth, Suits said he could not find time to play many video games for research. Instead, he talked to gamer friends, watched YouTube videos, and discussed interesting kill scenes with the stunt coordinator.  Release  Pandemic premiered at FrightFest Glasgow on February 26, 2016. It replaced Cell at the last moment. XLrator Media gave the film a limited release on April 1, 2016. It was released via video on demand on April 4, 2016.  Reception  Despite some positive reviews the overall reception by critics was mostly negative. The aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes gives it a Tomatometer score of 44%, based on 16 reviews of which nine were classified as mostly negative (rotten) and seven as mostly positive (fresh). The average point score was 4.75 out of 10.[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pandemic_2016 (retrieved 2020-04-23) Jonathan Hatfull of SciFiNow described it as \\"an energetic POV zombie action movie with some impressive action and less than impressive characterisation\\". Anton Bitel of Twitch Film called it \\"a thoroughly bleak portrait of rapid societal breakdown\\" that is also \\"a collection of genre clich√©s\\". Howard Gorman of Shock Till You Drop wrote, \\"Relying that much more on the narrative and players involved than POV 'gimmickry', Pandemic succeeds in keeping its audience invested and entertained.\\" Dennis Harvey of Variety called it \\"a solid if not quite memorable entry in the ever-expanding canon of survivalist undead cinema\\". Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter, in comparing it to Night of the Living Dead and other zombie films, said it shares similar themes but lacks the realism and gravitas. Martin Tsai of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Pandemic proves serviceably frightening, if sporadically gory, maximizing tension derived from unknown dangers\\".

The school serves between 400 and 600 students. The school originally opened in 1956 as Marymount College, a girls' high school equivalent to the boys-only St. Charles College. Following St. Charles' conversion to a co-educational school in 1993, enrolment at Marymount began to decline, a process that accelerated following the opening of St. Benedict Catholic Secondary School in 1996. The school thus added Grade 7 and 8 education, and developed a special focus on enriched academic education for young women, changing its name to the current Marymount Academy. Marymount Academy's motto is 'Disce ut Vivas', which is the Latin version of 'Learn That You May Live'. The school's official colours are navy blue and burgundy. Students wear uniforms, generally a kilt and a top in school colours. The school is located at 165 D'Youville Avenue near the city's downtown core, a facility shared with the head office of the Sudbury Catholic District School Board.
