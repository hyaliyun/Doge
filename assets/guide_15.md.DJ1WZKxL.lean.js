He was the uncle of Pedro Benedit Horruytiner, who succeeded him as governor of Florida.  Biography  Luis de Horruytiner was born in Zaragoza, Spain, to Mos√©n Gilbert Benedit de Huessa and Mar√≠a de Horruytiner. He had a brother, Mos√©n Gilbert Benedit y Horruytiner. His family was prominent in Saint Augustine, the capital of La Florida, and operated several cattle ranches on their land along the Rio San Juan (St. Johns River). In 1630, Horruytiner was appointed alcaide, or commander,of the Castillo del Morro in Havana, Cuba. On July 29, 1633, Horruytiner began his term as governor of the province of La Florida. In autumn of 1633, Hurruytiner and Friar Lorenzo Martinez agreed to send to Florida two Franciscan friars who knew the Indian language and would work to convert the indigenous population of Apalachee to Catholicism. The Franciscans may have converted around 6,000 people. Governor Dami√°n de Vega Castro y Pardo (1639‚Äì1645) wrote to King Philip IV in 1639 that two friars had converted 1,000 Indians in Apalachee province, but in 1635, the Franciscan Custodio of Florida had claimed that about 5,000 of the more than 34,000 Indians in Apalachee had been baptized. In 1676, however, a Franciscan claimed to have found a listing (matr√≠cula) made in 1638 of 16,000 Christianized Indians living in Apalachee. The Spanish government probably counted only the men among the natives, with a ratio of Christians compared to the total population of the province of 1 in 5 people. The evidence indicates that the Franciscans inflated the numbers of Christianized Indians. According to historian Paul E. Hoffman, if in 1647 the population remained at 34,000 people and the caciques had the same number of subjects in Apalachee, the Christian population there would have been 6,800 people in that year. In 1635 there were over 30,000 converts among the 44 doctrinas, administered by 39 friars. The native village that preceded the mission settlement of San Luis as capital of the Apalachee was called Anhaica Apalache, a name mentioned in the chronicles of the Hernando de Soto expedition. Mission San Luis was likely named in honor of Luis Horruytiner. Hurruytiner sent ships from St. Augustine to find a port on the Gulf coast of Florida to replace the long and difficult land route supplying the mission; the expedition found a suitable port at the mouth of the St. Marks River. Hurruytiner dispatched sergeant major Antonio de Herrera L√≥pez y Mesa to the western mission provinces to negotiate a peace with the leaders of the warring parties: the unchristianized Chacato who lived to the west of Apalachee, the Apalachicola to the northwest, and the Amacano to the southeast. L√≥pez summoned the leaders of each of the warring parties and brokered a treaty between all the combatants. Luis de Horruytiner finished his term as governor of Florida on November 26, 1638, and was succeeded by Dami√°n de Vega Castro y Pardo. After leaving his political position in Florida, Hurruytiner was appointed Viceroy of Sardinia, at the time a Spanish possession.

When governor Benito Ru√≠z de Salazar Vallecilla was suspended from office in 1646, acting royal contador (accountant or comptroller) Horruytiner and Francisco Menendez Marquez served as co-governors until Salazar Vallecilla was returned to office in 1648.

He was a nephew of the former governor of Florida, Luis Benedit Horruitiner.Juan - Her√°ldica Aragonesa: Genealog√≠a de Arag√≥n y Pedro Benedit Horruytiner Pedro Horruytiner joined the Spanish Army as a youth on December 10, 1635. and gained the ranks of sergeant major (\\" sargento mayor\\") and lieutenant colonel, which he held when he was appointed interim governor of Florida. Horruytiner moved to Saint Augustine the capital of Spanish Florida, on 11 April 1646. Pedro Benedit Horruytiner was appointed acting co-governor of Florida on 11 April 1646. On September 5, 1647, Horruytiner and Francisco Menendez Marquez issued an ultimatum to the Chisca Indians, who had attacked the Christianized Timucuan settlements, forcing them to choose within two months between their annihilation in Florida, or settlement in the towns of the Christian Timucua. Consequently, the Chisca chieftains agreed to settle their people in the Timucua mission settlements. In January of the same year, Horruytiner ordered Ensign Pedro de Florencia to search for the Indians who had been living in the missions of San Francisco de Potano and Santa F√© de Teleco, fearing those places would be permanently depopulated. Although the expedition seems to have achieved its goal as the Spanish attempted to repopulate these settlements, their demographic decline continued. Horruytiner's term as interim governor of Florida ended on 8 January 1648; he was reappointed as governor on 19 October 1651. He retired on 18 June 1654, and was replaced by Diego de Rebolledo.

The duplication is frequently inherited from a normal parent, so it is clear that intellectual development can be normal. Genetics Duplications of 22q11 vary in size and thereby in gene content. They include the typical common 3-Mb microduplication, 1.5-Mb nested duplication, consistent with non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) using distinct low-copy repeats. These microduplications likely represent the predicted reciprocal rearrangements to the microdeletions characterized in the 22q11.2 region. Smaller microduplications may occur within this highly dynamic with frequent rearrangements using alternative low-copy repeats as recombination substrates within and distal to the DiGeorge syndrome region. =Origin of duplication= The majority of 22q11 duplications are inherited often from a parent with a normal or near-normal phenotype. This is in sharp distinction to 22q11 deletion syndrome where about 90% of cases are caused by mutations that occur de novo.

It is administered by the Gush Etzion Regional Council. Long known as a \\"congenial meeting spot for Israelis and Palestinians,\\" in the fall of 2015 the junction was the site of about ten Palestinian attacks against Israelis.  Geography  Gush Etzion Junction is located in the northern Judean Hills at about 950 m above sea level. The junction is a 25-meter (82 ft) diameter roundabout (traffic circle) at the intersection of Route 60 and Route 367. Nearby communities include Efrat, Elazar, Alon Shvut, Kfar Etzion, Migdal Oz and Beit Fajjar. It is a 15-minute drive to the southern Jerusalem neighborhood of Gilo and approximately 70 minutes' drive to Tel Aviv. Establishments Adjacent to the junction on the northwest are a plant nursery, a shop selling snacks, cigarettes and lottery tickets and The Gush Etzion Winery and its mehadrin dairy/fish restaurant, BaYekev. On the southwest are a gas station, an automotive repair shop, an electronics store, a Judaica center and a Rami Levy discount supermarket. Attached to the supermarket is a hamburger joint, a pizzeria and a discount clothing store, all part of the Rami Levi group. In 2015 a competing chain of supermarkets, Shufersal opened a store. As of 2007, Rami Levi had begun construction of a two-story shopping mall as an extension to the south side of the supermarket and above it. A visitors' center is located to the west in Kibbutz Kfar Etzion as is the mehadrin dairy/fish restaurant, Gavna. Terrorist attacks The hitchhiking post at the junction has frequently been the site of attacks by Palestinians against Israeli citizens, many of which were foiled by alert Israelis. =Foiled and failed attacks= *March 2006: A Palestinian man who arouses suspicion at the hitchhikers' post is found to be armed with a knife and arrested. *November 2010: A Palestinian man attempts to stab Israeli civilians at the junction and is arrested by the IDF. *January 2011: Shots are fired in the area; there are no injuries. *October 2015: A Palestinian man tried to ram into Israelis waiting at a bus stop but hit the concrete blocks placed there to stop such attacks.

Godeffroy & Sohn The Godeffroys were French Huguenots of La Rochelle. In 1737 they were forced to flee France to avoid religious persecution after events following the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685. The family sought asylum in Prussia and finally settled in the port city of Hamburg, founding a trading empire known as J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn. At first the trade was in Western Europe and the West Indies with textiles as export item; the goods returning to Hamburg included copper, coffee, wine, figs, and sugar from Cuba. Under Johann Cesar VI Godeffroy outposts were established in Havana and in Valparaiso. He built a fleet of trading ships that, at its peak, numbered 29 deep water sailing vessels and some 100 smaller ships.Washausen, Helmut. Hamburg und die Kolonialpolitik des Deutschen Reiches [Hamburg and Colonial Politics of the German Empire]. Hamburg: Hans Christians Verlag, 1968, p. 56 (Ver√∂ffentlichungen des Vereins f√ºr Hamburgische Geschichte, Band 23) Among these ships were the barques Johann Caesar, Peter Godeffroy, La Rochelle, Wandram, Suzanne, Iserbrook, Victoria, and until the economic crisis of 1857, the renowned American-built clipper Sovereign of the Seas.Hertz, Richard. Das Hamburger Seehandelshaus J.C. Godeffroy und Sohn 1766-1879. Hamburg: Paul Hartungs Verlag, 1922, p. 35 (Ver√∂ffentlichungen des Vereins f√ºr Hamburgische Geschichte, Band 4) In 1855, trade was expanded into the Pacific following negotiations by Godeffroy's agent in Valparaiso, August Unselm. He sailed out to the Navigator Islands, The Friendly Islands, Fiji, and finally Tahiti. Cesar & Helene The trading business in the Pacific was very profitable and new outposts and plantations were established on many Pacific Islands. The goods were copra, coconut oil and luxuries such as pearl, as well as slaves (see blackbirding). In 1857, a central outpost, directing Pacific operations was established at Apia. Johann Godeffroy was also able to take advantage of an immigration scheme to Southern Africa and between October 1859 and September 1883 no less than 36 ships sailed for southern Africa, bringing hundreds of German families to the Western Cape, the Eastern Cape, British Kaffraria and Natal. After the financial crash of the late 1850, the firm supplemented its revenue by taking on passengers to the Australian gold rush and the California gold rush. The German imperial government utilized the Godeffroy company as part of its colonial policy in the Pacific Islands. Nevertheless, in 1878, the company went bankrupt due to speculations with German mining stocks and then emerged as Deutsche Handels- und Plantagen Gesellschaft der S√ºdseeinseln zu Hamburg, or DHPG, with continuity and management by Godeffroy personnel.Washausen, p. 57 Johan Cesar VI. Godeffroy Old Wandrahm Strasse in 1880 Johan Godeffroy attended the town school of Katharineum of L√ºbeck from about 1821 to 1830, as did his younger brothers and his older brother Gustav Adolph. He then trained at Parish & Co.:de:John Parish (Kaufmann) whose owner Richard Parish was married to Susanne Godeffroy, a daughter of Peter Godeffroy, brother of his grandfather. An internship in England followed. Towards the end of 1835, he joined his father's company, \\"Johan Ces. Godeffroy & Sohn \\" and on 1 January 1837 he became a shareholder. After the death of his father Johan V. Cesar Godeffroy on 3 July 1845 he took over the company. In this year he was elected to the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce. From 1846 he negotiated partnerships and mergers with various companies notably \\"Elb- Kupferwerk\\" (copper ore processors) and \\"Reiherstieg Hermann V. Roos\\" (shipbuilders). In 1857 he took control of the newly established \\"L. R. Beit, Gold- und Silber-Affinerie\\" now Aurubis AG. Other business arrangements were made with \\"Tesdorf FJ & Son\\", \\"Elbh√ºtte Affinir- und Handelsgesellschaft\\" and \\"Elb-Zuckersiederei\\" (sugar refiners). In these years also co-founded the North German Bank and the North German Insurance Company. Due to lack of liquidity the company Johan Ces. Godeffroy & Sohn at the end of 1879 began legal process with its creditors. This took over 30 years but finally in 1913 the company name \\"John Ces. Godeffroy & Sohn\\" was erased from the Register. On 2 February 1837 Johan Cesar VI. Godeffroy married Emily Hanbury (1815‚Äì1894) whose family had close trading ties with Livorno. The couple had five children, with Johan Cesar Godeffroy VII, the eldest son. His brother Gustav Godeffroy was a Senator for the city of Hamburg in the Frankfurt National Assembly and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Norddeutsche Bank. His brother, Adolph Godeffroy in 1847 was co-founder of the passenger line \\"Hamburg-Amerikanischen Packetfahrt-AG‚Äú (HAPAG)\\" (HAPAG) and until 1880 the presiding director. During the winter months the family lived in the upper floors of a house in the Old Wandrahm inside Hamburg, office spaces occupied the lower floor. This house was built around 1760. The rest of the year they lived far outside the city Dockenhuden, today a part of BlankeneseBlankenese belonged to Altona, and till 1864 Altona belonged to the Kingdom of Danmark, since 1937 Altona belongs to Hamburg in a cottage built by the Danish architect Christian Frederik Hansen in 1789 :de:Landhaus J. C. Godeffroy. Nearby, in the area known as Iserbrook, he planted extensive woodlands where Hamburg bourgeoisie, notably Ernst Merck, William Henry O'Swald, Corad Hinrich Donner Johann Heinrich Schr√∂der and Robert Miles Sloman were entertained at a tennis club.This is now Hirschpark :de:Hirschpark. He also established a horse farm. In June 1836 with his younger brother, Adolph, Carl Merck, Charles Parish, Dr. Edward Sieveking, Dr. Johann Gustav Heckscher and five other enthusiasts he founded the Hamburg Rowing Club. It is the oldest rowing club on the European continent and still exists today. From 1859 to 1864 he sat as a member of the Hamburg Parliament. S√ºdseek√∂nig, South Sea King German Consulate Apia Starting Pacific trading in Cochin-China and supported by merged, partner companies, share-holders (including Otto von Bismarck) and bankers in Hamburg and under the close direction of Johan Caesar VI Godeffroy the company was soon throughout the South Seas, with centres of operation at Apia and Valparaiso, and a fleet of trading barques, brigs and schooners, which traded through the islands from China to the Pacific coast flying the company colours ‚Äì a white flag with a ribboned golden dove on a blue horizontal bar with golden stripes, below the bar is a blue inscription: \\"J.C.G. & S. In Apia the company supplied arms and ammunition from an armaments subsidiary at Liege. These were supplied to the warring factions on Apia in exchange for of the finest alluvial soil soon transformed into plantations of, mainly, copra or coconut oil, pearl-shell or sea-island cotton. These were worked by over 1,000 labourers imported from Melanesia. Another plantation of was later started at Yap in the Pelew Group and in 1873 trading posts were established in the Bismarck archipelago. In 1865 in the Ellice Group (now Tuvalu) the company obtained a 25-year lease to the eastern islet of Niuoku of Nukulaelae Atoll. For many years the islanders and the company argued over the lease, including its terms and the importation of labourers, however the company remained until the lease expired in 1890. At Apia they had a shipbuilding yard and repairing sheds. The ships never insured and their captains were paid commission of three per cent, on the net profit of each voyage. Ships always left Apia under sealed orders to disguise their intentions from competitors. More innovative was the introduction of debased South American currencies as the sole means of exchange so controlling the money. The Establishment of the Museum Godeffroy Fische der Sudsee Journal Museum Godeffroy Beginning as a personal collection of birds, shells, fish, and other animals, as well as cultural objects from all localities visited by the Godeffroy ships, Godeffroy's natural history cabinet grew in size until it occupied a cluttered warehouse. It was time to find a proper place to house, list, organize, and finally display them to a fascinated public, and in 1860 Godeffroy wrote to Dr. Eduard Heinrich Graeffe (1833‚Äì1919) in Switzerland to request his services in founding a museum. The 28-year-old Swiss zoologist accepted and boarded a train for Hamburg in 1861. After a short time the Museum Godeffroy was founded, and Graeffe was sent to the Pacific in October 1861 to supervise the acquisition of more material. Graeffe settled in Apia and directed the Godeffroy operations there for the next decade while also collecting in Tahiti, Fiji, Tonga, Australia, Samoa, and other South Pacific Islands. Other scientific collectors were hired by the company who, working in different areas of the Pacific Ocean, helped increase the holdings of the Museum with their successful collecting of birds, mammals, fishes, shells, butterflies, beetles and other insects, plants, and ethnographic objects. The museum also functioned as a natural history dealership. On the establishment of the museum, Godeffroy was made an honorary member of the Berliner Gesellschaft f√ºr Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte. Legacy Johan Cesar VI.

T. Rogers. Its subject is the struggle for control of Afghanistan during the 1980s, from the American, Soviet, British, Pakistani, and secular Afghan points of view. It premiered in September 2010 at the Lyttelton Theatre, starring Lloyd Owen. The play was originally shorter and in one act. That version, now withdrawn, was presented in 2009 as part of The Great Game: Afghanistan. Synopsis In 1981, Central Intelligence Agency operative Jim Warnock arrives in Peshawar as station chief, accidentally meeting his Soviet counterpart Gromov at the airport. He and his MI6 opposite number Simon Craig liaise with the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence to supply weapons to Afghan warlords fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The Pakistanis insist on retaining control of the weapons supply and on prioritising Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a right-wing Islamist warlord unpalatable to both Warnock and Craig, though they both acquiesce to the deal. Warnock and the CIA have been banned from setting foot in Afghanistan personally, so he goes to a refugee camp on the Pakistan side of the border to meet with a relatively secular, non-right-wing warlord Abdullah and his western-pop-music-loving right-hand-man Saeed. He agrees to supply them both with weapons in return for information on the situation in Afghanistan. Warnock is also troubled by his absence from his wife and what he sees as his betrayal of his contacts in Iran after the Islamic Revolution there. After four years, Warnock returns to the USA, where his wife miscarries a long-hoped-for daughter before giving birth to a son. Warnock also coordinates a US visit and speech by Abdullah which convinces a wealthy senator to donate to the cause. Against the wishes of Warnock's superior Walter Barnes, who believes such a move might backfire in the future and removes all trace of deniability, a US committee votes to supply the Afghan warlords with Stinger missiles. Warnock returns to Afghanistan where he refuses Gromov's plea to let the Soviets retreat with dignity and alienates Craig by continuing to support Pakistan's backing of Hekmatyar. He meets Gromov as he departs Peshawar and then has a final meeting with Abdullah (this time in Afghanistan) before going back to the USA. He learns from Abdullah that Saeed has been killed by the Soviets and that Saeed was in fact Abdullah's son, a fact he had not previously revealed to Warnock. Warnock asks to buy back the Stinger missiles but learns Abdullah has sold them to Iran and allied himself with Hekmatyar until the Soviets are finally defeated. Abdullah then closes the play with a warning that the Mujahadeen will defeat the Soviets then \\"cross oceans\\" to spread Islamism.

It is part of Helsing√∏r Municipality and is located 12 km north-west of Helsing√∏r, and is mainly known for its fashionable holiday homes and broad sandy beaches. As of 2020, Hornb√¶k proper has a population of 3,641 but since 2010 it has grown together with neighbouring Dronningm√∏lle in Gribskov Municipality, forming an urban area with a combined population of 5,334.BY1: Population 1. January, by urban areas \\"BEF44: Population 1st January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark History Hornb√¶k was originally a small fishing village around a natural harbour. In 1706, as the first of a number of Danish reforestation initiatives, the Hornb√¶k Plantage was planted east of the village to prevent entrainment of the sandy soils. In the late 18th century, it was common practice for people from Copenhagen to spend their summers in the countryside north of the city and a number of artists began lodging in Hornb√¶k, either in the local inns or privately. Among these were Peder Severin Kr√∏yer, Holger Drachmann and Carl Locher before they moved on to Skagen and formed the Skagen colony. Kristian Zahrtmann, another prominent Danish painter of the time, also spend time in Hornb√¶k. Gradually an industry of boarding houses and seaside hotels emerged and many summer residents bought land and built houses. August Strindberg and Harriet Bosse visited Hornb√¶k in 1901 on a dramatic trip, a substitute for their honeymoon which Strindberg called off at the last moment. She went to Hornb√¶k alone and he later followed but they left after he attacked a photographer who wanted to take a picture of Bosse in her bathing costume. When the Hornb√¶k Railway Line was inaugurated on 22 May 1906, the town was invaded by tourists. Bathing jetties and bathing huts were common along the coast. Landmarks Landmarks include Hornb√¶k Church, Hotel Bretagne and Hotel Hornb√¶khus. Transport Hornb√¶k is connected to Helsing√∏r and Gilleleje by Hornb√¶k Railway.

Both were members of the Stoney First Nation and worked in the Rocky Mountains of Canada. Job Beaver's contributions to exploration of the Rockies is recorded in Job Pass, Job Creek and other locales. As a boy of fourteen, Samson accompanied his father on a trip to the lake they called Chaba Imne (Beaver lake). Sixteen years later, in 1907, Samson met Mary Schaffer, who had just failed in an attempt to find the route to a reputed large lake high in the mountains between Lake Louise and Jasper. Samson sketched a map showing the route to Chaba Imne. The following year Schaffer returned with her friend Mary Adams, guides Sid Unwin and Billy Warren. Using the map provided by Beaver, they found the lake, and explored it by raft (which they named HMS Chaba). The lake is now known as Maligne Lake. Samson Peak, located in the Maligne Lake Valley and visible from Maligne lake, is named for Samson Beaver. Nearby Leah Peak is named for his wife. The peaks were named by Mary Schaffer, in honour of Samson & Leah's contribution to her survey work and Rocky mountain exploration. Samson, Leah and their daughter Frances Louise have been memorialized in a photograph by Mary Schaffer (1907). The photo has since become a highly popular post card image, and the subject of academic discourse. References *Coleman, Arthur Philemon.

Early life John H. Harmon was born in Portage County, Ohio on June 21, 1819. His father, John Harmon, was a printer and published a newspaper in Ravenna, Ohio. The younger Harmon joined his father and learned the printer's trade. In 1838, the younger Harmon travelled to Detroit as the aide-de-camp of \\"General\\" Lucius V. Bierce, a leader of the Hunter Patriots, a group dedicated to ridding North America of the British Empire. In December 1838, Harmon took part in the Battle of Windsor, personally burning the British barracks and the steamer Thames. After the Battle of Windsor, Harmon stayed in Detroit, obtaining a job at the Detroit Free Press. He became an editor and one-third owner of the paper in 1841, and in 1853 sole owner of the paper. Harmon sold the Free Press the next year. In 1841, Harmon married Sarah S. Rood. The couple had three children: John Harmon, Emma Harmon, and Mrs. S. H. Bell. Politics Harmon was a prominent Democrat, serving as an alderman of the city of Detroit in 1847 and two years as mayor, in 1852 and 1853, as well as representing Michigan on the 1848 Democratic National Committee. He was also a member of the state militia, being appointed a Colonel in 1850. Following his stint as mayor, he was appointed by President Franklin Pierce as Collector for the Port of Detroit, where he served until 1857. After he left the office of Collector, Harmon spent much of his time in Washington, DC, during congressional sessions. During this time Harmon, as one biographer put it, \\"became a victim to the bad habits created by the customs of hospitality then existing in Detroit.\\" Through generosity to his friends, his fortune declined, and Harmon spent some time again working for the Free Press. However, he later \\"conquered [his] habit\\" and became a total abstainer, a \\"silent but eloquent example of a permanently reformed man.\\" John H.

The village was formed in the 1950s by people who were forcefully removed from Erundu (as Oshakati was known by then) by the South African apartheid regime to pave way for the development of the town. The village has approximately 58 homestead and the population of 400 people, of which 45% of the population are elderly people over the age of 50. The village has a primary school known as Ehenye PS which was established in 1997, the school has 15 teachers, 470 students and covers grades 1-7. Since moving to Ehenye village, villagers has been living in peace and harmony until 1992, when the Oshakati town council approached them for the first time concerning their land. Relocation and compensation Throughout the years the Oshakati town council has been forcing the villagers to abandon their land, to pave way for the development of the town. Villagers has urged that they will not leave their land, unless the Oshakati town council compensate them well, look for them places were they can get land to plough and transport them to the new places. The town council managed to force some elderly members to sell their land at lower prices than it is worth, while the majority of the villagers are still demanding fair compensation from the town council. Villagers have appointed a committee of young educated members of their society to deal with the matter and to ensure that they receive proper compensation which is worth of their land. The committee consist of Mr. Charles Amunime, Mrs. Tshalongo tya Nuuyoma, Mr. Antonius Amugongo and many other members. In 2007 the Oshakati town Mayor, by then Mr. Egerbrecht Atshipara announced plans of building more than 2200 houses at Ehenye village, which means that all Ehenye village residents have to relocate. Under his Leadership the Oshakati town council failed to gain control of the village. According to residence of Ehenye village P. N. Iwete, A New Land Grab, (Windhoek: New Era Newspaper, 2008) they had a meeting with permanent secretary to the Ministry of Regional and Local Government, Housing and Rural Development, by then Mr. Erastus Negonga to inform him of the land issues they are facing and the compensation been offered by the town council. Under the former Mayor Katrina Shimbulu, the town council went as far as digging water pipe lines in the village without informing the residents. In 2009 the town council accused the Ehenye residents of attacking construction trucks which belong to the Oshakati-based construction company Nexus, the trucks were apparently driving through the village from Ongwediva to the site where the new Oshakati open market was being constructed. According to the committee leader Charles Amunime H. Tueumuna, Ehenye Villagers Attack Contractors, (Windhoek: New Era Newspaper, 2009) the residents had to stop the construction because the compensation terms presented by the council were not fair and that villagers have presented the issue to LAC, so that they can intervene and negotiate for fair compensation. He also stated that the compensation terms presented by the town council Oshakati are based on the cabinet decision of 1996. The Oshakati town council have failed to meet the villagers demands of N$100000 per hectare of land, instead they insist on offering the villagers N$5000, which the PS claim that it is an increase of N$4000 on the previous amount of N$1000 which was offered a few years ago by the town council, all this amount of money offered by the town council is seen by the villagers as peanuts and they think that they land is worth more than N$5000 per hectare. The villagers of Ehenye village have sent another written document with all their demands to the cabinet and the Oshakati town council, they hope that their needs and demands will be met. And that they receive a fair compensation for their land. The villagers have also stated that they can pave way for further development of the town, but only when they are fairly compensated.2013 Servicing of gravel roads Bitumen sewer as well as water reticulation as well as Construction of -+242 houses started under Oshakati based construction company Mavinga Construction cc and water engineering Africa.(Kapolo Petrus H, 2013) References * http://www.economist.com.na/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=15079:nhe- plans-new-houses-for-oshakati-&catid;=554:archives * https://archive.is/20130221052625/http://www.newera.com.na/article.php?articleid=1946 * https://archive.is/20130221095550/http://www.newera.com.na/article.php?articleid=1786&sid;=89b9c2c1e9b551dca5f09b83887752ae * http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=28&tx;_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=63313&no;_cache=1 * http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=28&tx;_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=50182&no;_cache=1 Kapolo Petrus Oshakati ","title":"Ehenye"},{"id":"28979895","title":"Maria Kirilenko career statistics"},{"id":"28979897","text":"Unton Croke (159328 January 1671) was an English judge and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1628 and 1640.

This historical map of California counties in 2011 suggests there is greater availability in large urban metro areas such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Broadband mapping in the United States are efforts to describe geographically how Internet access service from telephone and cable TV companies (commonly called \\"broadband\\") is available in terms of available speed and price. Mapping has been done on the national as well as the state level. The efforts are seen as preliminary steps towards broadband universal service. Background Internet access and bit rates (often called \\"speeds\\") vary considerably across the US. Generally, rural Internet users have fewer options and slower service. American consumers often spend more money for slower service than in other countries. Former Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and California Public Utilities Commission commissioner Rachelle Chong floated the idea of broadband mapping while working for the Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger Administration in California in 2006. The California Broadband Task Force had performed the first voluntary broadband mapping exercise in that state in 2006‚Äì2007, having learned about it when Commissioner Chong visited the ConnectKentucky broadband project in 2005. The broadband maps were then used by the CPUC to determine both \\"unserved areas\\" (defined as an area that is not served by any form of facilities-based broadband, or where Internet connectivity is available only through dial-up service or satellite) and \\"underserved\\" areas (defined as an area in which broadband is available but no facilities-based provider offers service at speeds of at least 3 megabytes per second (MB/s) download and 1 Mbit/s upload). A $100 million program called the California Advanced Services Fund (CASF) was established on December 20, 2007, under the leadership of Assigned Commissioner Chong at the CPUC to bring an \\"onramp to the Internet\\" to unserved areas and underserved areas of the state, with unserved areas having first priority using filing windows. In 2008, State Senator Alex Padilla (D-Pacoima)codified the CASF program with Senate Bill (SB) 1193, signed by Governor Schwarzenegger on September 29, 2008, to ensure it had the legislative authority it needed to operate. On September 25, 2010, Governor Schwarzenegger signed SB1040 which added CASF funds of $125 million, of which $100 million went to broadband infrastructure funding, and $25 million to broadband adoption programs. In 2008, the FCC approved a broadband mapping plan which would examine availability by speed and \\"provide a more granular look at where broadband is available,\\" according to a report in The Washington Post. The Broadband Data Improvement Act was introduced by Senator Daniel Inouye in 2007 and became law on October 10, 2008. The act's section 106 created a legal framework for the United States Department of Commerce's State Broadband Data and Development Grant Program, but did not fund it. The Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP) was funded as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (known as the \\"stimulus package\\") under the Obama administration. Funds were allocated by the Commerce department and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in February 2009. On April 2, 2009, California's Commissioner Chong testified before the House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet, about the California broadband program, and recommended that every state be required to perform broadband mapping in order to have an accurate understanding of its unserved and underserved areas, and not waste American Recovery and Reinvestment Act federal funding for broadband expansion. She further recommended that the broadband data be collected at the granular street address level annually in order to get the most accurate data. She testified that broadband mapping funds should be fairly allocated among the states, with an eye towards population, density, area, broadband penetration, and state's commitment to broadband. The NTIA was to create and release a National Broadband Inventory Map by February 17, 2011. In 2009, it was estimated that would be expended to build the nationwide inventory of broadband services map. The mapping project was part of a much larger project perhaps involving seven billion dollars for a National Broadband Plan that had, among other goals, bringing high speed Internet service to rural areas. State governments such as New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Minnesota attempted broadband maps, as did nations in Africa. In Massachusetts, an ARRA grant was supplemented with state funds in 2010 for the Massachusetts Broadband Institute. In service of the MassBroadband 123 project to provide universal access statewide, the Institute created the Massachusetts Broadband Map, as of 2011 updated every six months. Lack of mapping standards As with other thematic maps, there is no standard for mapping information. Rather, different studies have been done using different geographic and data rate parameters. Geometric units such as census tracts as well as zip codes have been used. Although the term broadband once had a technical meaning, it is used in marketing and policy to generally apply to relatively high data rate (and thus more expensive) Internet access, while technology changes over time. One 2007 estimate used five speed ranges, with the lowest being from 200 kbit/s to 768 kbit/s, and the highest was more than 6 Mbit/s. Politics and controversy Politics influences the allocation of funds. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration in 2009 said it would reassess the program to ensure the funds are used in a \\"fiscally prudent\\" manner, after private firms claimed they could make the map for much less. In addition, there is an effort by the FCC to do a separate mapping effort unconnected to the congressional effort. Internet providers, including telephone and cable firms, according to a report in The New York Times, are reluctant to disclose to government whether it offers service to some regions, how much it costs, and other parameters of availability. Lobbying firms and nonprofits geared up to battle for funding since there could be lucrative government contracts in the future. Connected Nation is a non-profit group which was involved in an effort to get the state of Kentucky mapped regarding its available Internet service. It is funded by AT&T;, Verizon, and other telecom firms. Art Brodsky, Communications Director at Public Knowledge, a public interest organization which focuses on telecoms, wrote several articles in the Huffington Post criticizing the efforts of Connected Nation which, in his view, represented the interests of the telephone and cable industries and not the interests of consumers or other Internet-using publics. According to Brodsky, the nonprofit has board members who work for leading telecom and cable firms, and the nonprofit is heading efforts to keep the broadband map information \\"confidential\\" by deeming it \\"proprietary\\". Brodsky used the term broadband bullies to describe telephone and cable efforts to impede the mapping project. Behavioral economics expert Sara Wedeman‚Äîwho has studied broadband mapping methodologies‚Äîcriticized the politics behind the mapping efforts and suggested that efforts by cable and telephone companies could undermine choices for consumers. Wedeman lauded the methodologies by states such as North Carolina and Massachusetts and noted that when studies were done properly, the reports found that broadband speed and availability were below those reported by similar efforts by affiliates of Connected Nations.

GBN ceased to be an active entity following the acquisition of the Monitor Group by Deloitte in January 2013. Scenario planning Unlike forecasting which extrapolates past and present trends to predict the future, scenario planning is an interactive process for exploring alternative, plausible futures and what those might mean for strategies, policies, and decisions. Scenario planning was first used by the military in World War II and then by Herman Kahn at RAND (‚ÄúThinking the Unthinkable‚Äù) during the Cold War, before being adapted to inform corporate strategy by Pierre Wack and other business strategists at Royal Dutch/Shell in the 1970s. The key principles of scenario planning include thinking from the outside in about the forces in the contextual environment that are driving change, engaging multiple perspectives to identify and interpret those forces, and adopting a long view.

Robin tells Ted that she has been promoting him to a make-up artist at work, but when she describes his selling points, Ted is worried that she oversold him. She sends a series of text messages to try to balance out this faux pas, which Ted becomes upset about since he believed that the things Robin had texted were too horrible. Robin receives a text from the woman which says she is still interested in meeting Ted. Ted then asks Robin why would the woman still want to meet him after all of the bad things that Robin had told her and realizes that Robin has possibly oversold the woman to him.  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A‚àí score. She said that while the episode had no real innovations aside from recurring characters and meeting relatives for the very first time, Barney's acceptance of the truth was not long in coming. She also took note of the way Barney joined in the duet between James and his father. James Poniewozik of Time.com noted Barney's attempts to feel like a black man with respect to Sam and James was akin to the behavior of Navin Johnson, Steve Martin's character in the film The Jerk. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a rating of 6.5 out of 10. DeAnn Welker of Television Without Pity gave the episode a C+ score, saying there was not much of a storyline for the other four main characters.

Imperial Cold Storage and Supply Company (ICS) was one of the largest meat processing, storage, distribution and marketing companies in South Africa, dominating the South African packaged food sector for almost a hundred years. The company was formally registered and listed as ICS in 1899, originally it grew out of Combrinck & CO. which was founded in 1830 in Cape Town. Combrinck & CO. was then merged into ICS. ICS was one of the largest meat processing and distribution companies in the world. The company originally concentrated on supplying ships, but would go on to develop the first cold-storage enterprise in South Africa in conjunction with the Union and Castle shipping lines. Sir David Graaff, 1st Baronet was a founder, chairman and major shareholder. Rhodesian operation In 1924, the then government of Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, granted a ten-year monopoly to the company. Enforced by act of government, it also guaranteed the companies operations in Rhodesia for the duration of its monopoly with an up to GB¬£15 000 per annum guaranteed against losses resulting from its operations. In return Imperial Cold Storage agreed to develop the country's chilled and frozen beef industry. In terms of the act's objective to establish a beef packing and processing industry in Rhodesia the government's partnership with Imperial Cold Storage was a success.MLAMBO, A. S.

(p.57) Tiger Brands buyout Due to the high costs of expansion in southern Africa along with a slump in the demand for meat following the great depression in 1934 the company was in serious financial trouble. More money was sought from investors to help shore up the companies finances. Anglo-American corporation was the largest investor and the total capital of the company increased to GB¬£2.2 million (equivalent to ¬£436,000,000 in 2010Measuring Worth, Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount - average earnings, retrieved on 27/09/2010). Anglo's share in the company would continue to grow as Imperial Cold Storage worked more and more with Tiger Oats, then a subsidiary of Anglo-American corporation. In March 1982 Barlow bought a considerable share of Tiger Oats and a controlling share in Imperial Cold Storage. In October 1998 Tiger Brands (then known as Tiger Oats Limited) bought out Imperial Cold Storage and the company was folded into its portfolio of brands and companies.

Herendeen's novels are notablehttp://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item5636084/?site_locale=en_GB for their queering of the traditional Romance novel.  Background  A native New Yorker and lifelong Brooklyn resident, Herendeen graduated with high honors in English from Princeton University. She also holds a Master of Library Science degree from Pratt Institute.  Phyllida and the Brotherhood of Philander  Herendeen's first novel Phyllida and the Brotherhood of Philander was initially issued by a subsidy publisher with the subtitle A Bisexual Regency Romance, in 2005. Harper Collins released a slightly altered version of the book in 2008 without that subtitle. Herendeen's atypical Regency Romance introduces a central same-sex love story into a Regency-set tale of a marriage of convenience which otherwise obeys many of the conventions of genre romance. The heroine Phyllida, an authoress, offers the hero a quid pro quo of \\"irregular\\" liberty in marriage - his sexual freedom for her literary and professional freedom. The novel delivers the generically required account of the development of the couple's erotic and tender bonds through trials to deep and permanent commitment, while Phyllida's authorship supplies Herendeen's text with a common metafictional feature of postmodern genre romance: a novel-within-the-novel, exploring forbidden sexuality in the fashionable manner of the era. Passages of Phyllida's fiction are rendered as pastiches of the great Gothic tradition (e.g. Charles Maturin, Ann Radcliffe, Matthew \\"Monk\\" Lewis, Clara Reeve, Mary Shelley) the language and conventions of which are at once mocked and relished. According to Herendeen: McDaniel College's Pamela Regis,http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/English/faculty/pregis/naturalhistory.htm author of A Natural History of the Romance Novel, brings forward Phyllida and the Brotherhood of Philander as evidence against what she contends is the myth of the genre's fundamentally socially reactionary nature.http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item5636084/?site_locale=en_GB In her article in the new edition of The Cambridge History of the American Novel, Regis argues:  Pride/Prejudice  Herendeen's second novel Pride/Prejudice is a slash fiction contribution to the immense catalogueThe Republic of Pemberley of mash-ups, sequels, fan fiction, retellings, updatings, spin-offs and homages to Jane Austen's celebrated novel. Pride/Prejudice narrates Austen's original story unearthing the \\"forbidden\\" intimacies between Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley and between Elizabeth Bennet and Charlotte Lucas. Salon's reviewer Laura Miller noted that Herendeen's language in Pride/Prejudice is the most successful of the Austen derivatives in \\"approximating Austen's style without aping it.\\"Laura Miller, \\"The battle for Jane Austen\\", Salon January 20, 2010 http://www.salon.com/books/laura_miller/2010/01/20/jane_austen The novel was 2010 Lambda Literary Award finalist in the category \\"bisexual fiction\\" category.http://www.lambdaliterary.org/awards/  ECLIPSIS: Lady Amalie's Memoirs  Herendeen is the author of a series of \\"sword-and-sorcery\\" fantasy novels. The first novel in the series, Recognition, was self-published as an ebook in 2011.  Critical and scholarly work  Ann Herendeen is one of a growing number of romance authors (e.g. Jennifer Crusie, Pam Rosenthal, Lauren Willig, Jayne Ann Krentz) and academicshttp://teachmetonight.blogspot.fr/ to take genre romance seriously as an object of study, and not only through the lens of sociology. Herendeen has delivered talks and participated in panels at conferences devoted to her genre.

It was first undertaken in the late 19th century by cooperating educational institutions, on a regional basis. The federal government began to play a limited role in higher education accreditation in 1952 with reauthorization of the G.I. Bill for Korean War veterans. The original GI Bill legislation had stimulated establishment of new colleges and universities to accommodate the influx of new students; but some of these new institutions were of dubious quality. The 1952 legislation designated the existing peer review process as the basis for measuring institutional quality; GI Bill eligibility was limited to students enrolled at accredited institutions included on a list of federally recognized accredited institutions published by the U.S. Commissioner of Education. The U.S. Department of Education (USDoED) and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) (a non-governmental organization) both recognize reputable accrediting bodies for institutions of higher education and provide guidelines as well as resources and relevant data regarding these accreditors. Neither the U.S. Department of Education nor CHEA accredit individual institutions.U.S. Department of Education, Accreditation in the United States With the creation of the U.S. Department of Education and under the terms of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the U.S. Secretary of Education is required by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies that the Secretary has determined to be reliable authorities on the quality of education or training provided by the institutions of higher education and the higher education programs they accredit.College Review Journal, Complete List of National Accrediting Agencies . There are regional and national accrediting agencies, both of which are accountable to the Department of Education. Regional bodies historically accredited institutions in a particular region of the country. National bodies were established to accredit institutions across the country, and sometimes beyond it. Within American higher education, regional bodies have historically been considered more prestigious. However, US Higher Education has seen significant changes in the last two decades. In February 2020 the USDoED detailed new policies to conform to the current status of regional and national accreditors stating: \\"Because the Department holds all accrediting agencies to the same standards, distinctions between regional and national accrediting agencies are unfounded ‚Ä¶ Instead of distinguishing between regional and national accrediting agencies, the Department will distinguish only between institutional and programmatic accrediting agencies. The Department will no longer use the terms \\"regional\\" or \\"national\\" to refer to an accrediting agency.\\" 2020 February USDoEd Final Accreditation and State Authorization Regulations This change is intended to encourage cooperation between accredited schools to improve student experiences, uphold quality standards and reduce the cost of higher education by encouraging transparent transfer of credits and mutual recognition of degrees between schools with common standards. It is also intended to allow students to able to access the best school for their needs no matter what region they reside in.Judith Eaton, CHEA President Expresses Pros and Cons for Regionals going National https://www.chea.org/will-regional- accreditation-go-national-0 Professional schools, which are often graduate schools, have separate organizations for accreditation.  Regional accreditors  Historically, educational accreditation activities in the United States have been overseen by six regional accrediting agencies established in the late 19th and early 20th century to foster articulation between secondary schools and higher education institutions, particularly evaluation of prospective students by colleges and universities.Fred F. Harcleroad and Judith S. Eaton (2005), \\"The Hidden Hand: External Constituencies and their Impact,\\" Chapter 9 in Philip G. Altbach, Robert Oliver Berdahl, and Patricia J. Gumport, editors, American higher education in the twenty-first century: social, political, and economic challenges. Page 263. JHU Press. , .History of the North Central Association These six regional accreditation agencies are membership organizations of educational institutions within their geographic regions. Initially, the main focus of the organizations was to accredit secondary schools and to establish uniform college entrance requirements. Accreditation of colleges and universities followed later. Both regional and national accreditation of higher education applies to the entire institution, specific programs, and distance education within an institution.U.S. Department of Education, Accreditation in the United States The higher education institutions holding regional accreditation are primarily non-profit institutions with significant exceptions, as the largest US for-profit Universities (University of Phoenix, Grand Canyon University, Strayer/Capella University) are regionally accredited.Judith S. Eaton, Accreditation and Recognition in the United States , CHEA, 2008. |title=Regional Accreditation vs National Accreditation for Online Colleges |url=https://www.geteducated.com/regional-vs-national-accreditation-which-is- better-for-online-colleges |author=Geteducated.com |access-date=March 20, 2018}}  National accreditors  National accrediting bodies are also recognized by the US Department of Education. These include: * Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC) * Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training (ACCET) * Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) * Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools, Accreditation Commission * Council on Occupational Education (COE) * Distance Education Accrediting Commission (DEAC) * Association of Institutions of Jewish Studies * Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools, Accreditation Commission * New York State Board of Regents, and the Commissioner of Education Regional accreditation compared with national accreditation Regionally accredited schools are usually academically oriented, and most are non-profit. Nationally accredited schools, a large number of which are for-profit, typically offer specific vocational, career, or technical programs. Regionally accredited institutions employ large numbers of full-time faculty, and the faculty set the academic policies. Regionally-accredited schools are required to have adequate library facilities. Except for some specific subject areas such as nursing, nationally-accredited schools do not hire many full-time faculty, usually hiring faculty by the course, without benefits and with no influence on the school's academic policies, which are determined by non-academic administrators, and ultimately investors. Their library facilities, if they exist at all, are far inferior to those of regionally-accredited schools. While there are some legitimate and well-intentioned nationally accredited schools, by and large they exist not to educate, but to make money for their investors. They live on federal student aid and very high tuitions, often leaving graduating students with credentials of little value and large student loans, often without job prospects by which to pay them off. Critics consider national accreditation to be disreputable. Schools accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges, a national accreditor, have occasionally been sued for leading prospective students to believe, incorrectly, that they would have no problem transferring their credits to a regionally accredited school. Specialized and professional accreditors Specialized and professional accreditors are recognized as reputable by the U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Best practices are shared and developed through affiliation with the Association of Professional and Specialized Accreditors. The more visible specialized and professional accreditors include: * Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN) * Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology ‚Äì for applied science, computing, engineering, and technology programs * Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) - for business schools * American Bar Association ‚Äì for law schools. Graduation from an ABA-accredited law school is a prerequisite to sitting for the bar exam in most states, a notable exception being California. * American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation ‚Äì for dentistry schools * American Veterinary Medical Association ‚Äì for veterinary schools * Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE), Commission on Accreditation * Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) * Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) ‚Äì for business schools * Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) * Commission on English Language Program Accreditation (CEA) * Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation ‚Äì for medical schools that grant a DO degree * Liaison Committee on Medical Education ‚Äì for medical schools that grant an MD degree * National Architectural Accrediting Board ‚Äì for architecture schools. Graduation from a NAAB-accredited architecture school is a prerequisite to sitting for the architectural licensing exams in most states * National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration ‚Äì for public policy schools =Other recognized accreditors= Several organizations exist that accredit institutions and which are not recognized by the U.S. Department of Education or CHEA. These include: * The State Bar of California Committee of Bar Examiners  Religious accreditors  Although many schools related to religious organizations hold regional accreditation or secular national accreditation, there are four different agencies that specialize in accreditation of religious schools: * Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools (AARTS) * Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) * Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE) * Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) These groups specialize in accrediting theological and religious schools including seminaries and graduate schools of theology, as well as broader-scope universities that teach from a religious viewpoint and may require students and/or faculty to subscribe to a statement of faith. Additionally, as of 2009, 20 U.S. states and Puerto Rico had some form of exemption provision under which religious institutions can grant religious degrees without accreditation or government oversight.Religious Exempt Schools , Oregon Student Assistance Commission Office of Degree Authorization website, accessed March 21, 2011EXEMPTIONS FROM THE HIGHER EDUCATION LICENSING PROCESS FOR RELIGIOUS COLLEGES , Connecticut General Assembly website, accessed March 21, 2018 Use of .edu top-level Internet domain Since 2001, the use of the top-level internet domain, .edu has been restricted to accredited institutions, but non- qualifying institutions can still use .edu domain names obtained before the current rules came into force. Criticism of accreditation Various commenters have written about the role and effectiveness of the American accreditation system. It has drawn particular interest since the rise of e-learning classes and institutions. A frequent point of discussion and criticism is that the traditional system is limited to measuring \\"input\\" factors, such as adequate facilities and properly credentialed faculty, rather than the quality of a school's educational output. In his 1996 book Crisis in the Academy, Christopher J. Lucas criticized the accreditation system as too expensive, onerously complicated, incestuous in its organization, and not properly tied to quality. Similarly, a 2002 report by George C. Leef and Roxana D. Burris of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA) argued that the system does not ensure or protect educational quality, while still imposing significant costs. In a 2006 \\"issue paper\\", Robert C. Dickeson wrote that a lack of transparency, low and lax standards, and outdated regionalization were among the problems with regional accreditation. Others, such as Edward M. Elmendorf of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, reject these claims, arguing that they are \\"picking around the edges\\" of a proven and necessary system for upholding standards. Critics note that many for-profit schools were created for profit motives, to provide an often misleading veneer of respectability for education that is sub-standard. At various times the U.S. government has investigated changes to the accreditation system. In 2002 the House of Representatives Subcommittee on 21st Century Competitiveness criticized the system. Accreditation was a major topic of the Spellings Commission, which released its report on September 26, 2006. The Council for Higher Education Accreditation recognizes that there are criticisms, but has opposed these calls for reform, with President Judith S. Eaton arguing that the system is successful and needs to remain flexible to accommodate differences between schools and disciplines. In 2013, President Barack Obama proposed changes in the accreditation system to hold \\"colleges accountable for cost, value, and quality\\". He requested Congress change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are considered in determining which institutions are accredited and allow students access to federal financial aid; his criticism was directed at for-profit institutions. An article published by \\"University World News\\" on 2 February 2018 stated that the higher education accreditation community, which confers the quality- assurance seal of approval that allows United States colleges and universities access to billions of dollars of federal student aid, must do a better job of explaining itself to the public if it wants to reverse waning public confidence in higher education. That was one of the tamer recommendations voiced at a conference for accreditors, who are feeling the brunt of growing scepticism about the value of a US college degree.

It won the Strega Prize in 1986. It is a fictional autobiography of Isabella d'Este, covering the major years of the Italian Renaissance from a private point of view within the court of the Duke of Mantua. Structure The book, like other works of Bellonci, is very well documented and accurately based on original documents that the author had the opportunity to study in detail. However, this is not a historical reconstruction, like her previous book about Lucrezia Borgia, although that may perhaps have generated the idea for Private Renaissance, but it is a true historical novel, with a few inventions by the author. These include the introduction of the fictional character of Robert de la Pole, an English clergyman who writes to Isabella over several years from various points around Europe, who while fictional nevertheless appears to have been inspired by the historical English Cardinal Reginald Pole. The inclusion of this figure in the novel makes it possible to introduce important historical figures and events in the context of the period, even if they did not come into direct contact with Isabella. It is also valuable in replacing the figure of the narrator ‚Äì irreconcilable feat with the book's autobiographical form ‚Äì and the figures of other speakers who may have historically existed as sources for Bellonci, but it can not be used directly without compromising the flow of the text itself. Working with a fictional character, the author avoids exaggerating one or more actual figures and respects historical accuracy. Alongside the memories of her protagonist, Isabella d'Este, Bellonci develops the relationship between her and the Englishman (called Anglicus) into an uncanny connection: on the one hand, there is an instant attraction towards this devoted and distant figure; on the other, there is a perplexity because of his unconventional ways. Isabella solves the difficult question of how to respond through her tacit consent to receiving his letters ‚Äì while she does not attempt to discourage him from writing to her, she also does not send him any replies. Plot The book is divided into seven parts, interspersed with twelve letters of Robert de la Pole. The narrative is constructed as a long flashback that takes place in 1533, when Isabella, aged almost sixty, is writing her memoirs in the so- called Clocks' Room of the Ducal Palace in Mantua. Apart from some references to the present and the distant past, the narrative takes place mostly in chronological order between the years 1500 and 1533, which is the date when Isabella tells her story, ending the main events of her life (she died in the year 1539).

Shortly after the train left Harmanli, Turks from the column set the railway bridge on the Maritsa river on fire and used carts from the column to block the road bridge. Russian forces cleared the road bridge and proceeded further on the road to Cisr-i Mustafapa≈üa (now Svilengrad). After the incident, the Russian field commander expressed his astonishment of the Turks' actions in a telegram to the commanding officer - General Mikhail Skobelev, given the central Ottoman authorities' efforts to conclude a truce (which was ultimately done on 19 January). On 19 January a Russian regiment received orders to clear the surroundings of Harmanli of the armed refugees and the remaining Ottoman forces in order to free up the road to Adrianople. Based on the Russian version of the events, upon approaching the column, the Russian forces were shot at by Turks hiding behind carts. During the Turks' flight, some of them encountered and burnt down the Christian village Devraliy. Based on the Turkish version of the events, the column was attacked by Russian troops. The column broke up and dispersed, the able-bodied portion of the caravan fled toward the mountains, the old, the sick and the very young who were left behind perished in the freezing weather. The old men who remaining in the carts were massacred by the Russians. A group of Muslims were overtaken at Sarambey (present day Septemvri) by Russian troops who seized all of their possessions and carried off the young women. The greater part of the caravan was also plundered by the Bulgarians of neighbouring villages, massacring the remaining refugees who were not strong enough to flee into the mountains. After the column's dispersing, the Russian commander General Mikhail Skobelev arrived at the scene, accompanied by Western military correspondents. The French journalist Dick de Lonlay described the aftermath of the battle. General Skobelev ordered a small Russian detachment to collect the remaining supplies and surviving refugees (including children) and bring them back to Harmanli.

She and Guido Alberti set up the Strega Prize in 1947. Biography Bellonci was born Maria Villavecchia in Rome on 30 November 1902. Her father, Gerolamo Vittorio Villavecchia, was a professor of chemistry, and came from an aristocratic Piedmontese family, while her mother, Felicita Bellucci, came from Umbria. She had three younger siblings, a brother Leo and a sister, Gianna. From 1913, she studied at the Liceo Umberto, graduating in 1921. She married the journalist Goffredo Bellonci in 1928. Following the Second World War, the Belloncis established a salon at their residence, the Amici della domenica (Friends of Sunday) inviting Italian literates to discuss the promotion of Italian culture. Bellonci's husband died in August 1964. Bellonci died on 13 May 1986 in Rome. Career =Literary= Aged 19, Bellonci wrote Clio e le amazzoni, a novel that remained unpublished, but which circulated in Italian literary circles and introduced her to her future husband Goffredo Bellonci. Bellonci's literary debut was in 1939 with the acclaimed biography of Lucrezia Borgia, published in Italian by Mondadori, and translated into twelve languages. This and her subsequent works on historical subjects, based on rich and detailed research of extant primary documents, were lauded for their vivid reconstructions and psychological motivations of their characters from which the public obtained a credible picture of history stripped of legends and accretions over the centuries. She concentrated on the great Renaissance families: Borgias, Estes, Gonzagas and Sforzas. Especially welcomed was her focus on women in the Renaissance and their interactions with power. Although these works were written in the genre of historical fiction, they were fully documented histories. By 1972, Bellonci was beginning to experiment with the form. For the first time, in the compendium Tu vipera gentile, she introduced fictional characters in order to propel the historical narrative. Similarly, her final novel Rinascimento Privato (Private Renaissance) which came out in 1985, was written in the first person by the protagonist Isabella d'Este; she added fictional characters to describe historical events, in essence creating a metahistorical novel. Furthermore, contrasting this depiction of Isabella with her previous appearances in Bellonci's works (e.g. in Lucrezia Borgia), Bellonci was able to show how subjective and ideologically malleable historical interpretation may be. =Culture, activism, journalism= Bellonci was actively involved in the promotion of Italian culture. Along with her husband and Guido Alberti, she established the literary Premio Strega in 1947. She recounted its history in her 1971 book Come un racconto. Gli anni del Premio Strega. She was a columnist in periodicals such as Il punto (1958‚Äì64), and Il Messaggero (1964-70). Many of these articles were compiled and republished in Pubblici segreti (two volumes, 1965 and 1989). Her collection of articles on Italian cities were republished posthumously in Segni sul muro (Signs on the wall, 1989). =Translation= Bellonci was inspired by Stendhal, and translated some of his work into Italian: Vanina Vanini e altre cronache italiane (1961), La duchessa di Paliano (1994). Among her other translations are Alexandre Dumas' I tre moschettieri (1977) and Emile Zola's Nana (1955). Awards Bellonci was awarded the Viareggio Prize in 1939 for Lucrezia Borgia. In 1979, she won the Premio San Gerolamo for her literary oeuvre. She was posthumously awarded the Strega prize in 1986 for Rinascimento privato.  Bibliography  *Lucrezia Borgia.

The location of Windhoek, which was deserted and completely destroyed at that time, was chosen because the Germans felt it would serve as a buffer zone between the Nama and Herero tribes. The fort was, however, never involved in any military action. The foundation was laid on 18 October 1890 by then Schutztruppe private Gustav T√ºnschel. The building was redesigned multiple times during the first years; its final layout was only completed in 1915. It consists of an inner courtyard with high walls and accommodation for the troops on the inside, as well as four towers. Alte Feste is the oldest surviving building in the city which subsequently developed around it.

It tells the story of a group of musicians who illegally perform music on objects in the various institutions of a city. The film is a follow-up to Music for One Apartment and Six Drummers, the 2001 short film made by the same directors with the same basic concept. The title comes from the Italian futurist Luigi Russolo's 1913 manifesto The Art of Noises. Plot A group of six anarchist drummers led by musician Sanna Persson and a conductor named Magnus set out to make music with objects that are generally considered non-musical. They plan out a concert with four humorously titled movements to be played across the city after carefully analyzing what objects can be used to make good music. All the while, the group is pursued by Amadeus Warnebring, a tone-deaf policeman born into a distinguished musical family who hates the sound of music. The group begins by playing in a surgery room using a notable TV reporter who has been admitted to the hospital for hemorrhoid surgery. Their next piece is set in a bank where they ostensibly hold up the staff and customers. They then feed banknotes into the shredding machine for a distorted bass sound. The next piece uses bulldozers thumping the ground at the fountain in front of an opera house. For the crescendo, they strike the fountain knocking it to the ground. The last piece involves them hanging from high tension power cables and playing the suspended cables like violins. Warnebring eventually comes to realize that the objects and people used by the anarchists as instruments are rendered silent to his ears after the fact, due to his tone-deafness. From this he forms a plan to force the drummers into using the entire city as an instrument by way of rhythmically controlling the power supply. The plan succeeds: Persson observes that the ambient sounds around her have become musical, while Warnebring can hear no such sounds. The film ends with the anarchists exiled from the city and performing as a lounge act as Warnebring enjoys a silent orchestral concert elsewhere.

Eric Kohn of IndieWire called Sound of Noise \\"Bonnie and Clyde on drums\\", writing, \\"Loaded with ingeniously devised beats, it hammers out a unique rhythm deserved of many repeat performances,\\" and \\"directors Ola Simonsson and Johannes Stj√§rne make the surrealist musical set pieces into the real stars\\". He also praised the film's \\"wildly original soundtrack\\". David DeWitt from The New York Times compared the film to the similarly percussive theatrical show Stomp, and called it \\"a character study mixed with outlandish crime procedural. Everyone‚Äôs quite serious about the joke, without a moment of Adam Sandler-style ‚Äúlook at how cute we are‚Äù that would only dilute the film‚Äôs appeal. Sound of Noise is a dry treat ‚Äî a solid, self-aware cult pleasure\\". In her review of the film, Alissa Simon from Variety called it \\"a delightful comic cocktail of modern city symphony, police procedural and love story ... With the most complex and wackily staged musical numbers since Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet‚Äôs Delicatessen, the pic was far more demanding to make than it is to watch\\". She noted that \\"critical praise and savvy marketing could transform sure-fire fest crowd-pleaser into a niche arthouse success in most markets\\". Peter Brunette of The Hollywood Reporter called the basic premise of the film \\"one of the most imaginative you'll ever see. It's all based on music‚Äîraw, elemental and percussive‚Äîout of which genuine laughs are wrung from beginning to end.\\" He noted the film's \\"understated but cute rom-com aspect\\", and described the sketches as \\"brilliantly conceptualized and faultlessly executed. The editing and sound mix are snappy, and delightful animations perk up the film visually. Sound of Noise may be small in scope, but, in terms of imagination, it's huge.\\" He similarly commented that \\"the right niche distributor might coax some modest profits\\" from the film. =Accolades= Sound of Noise received the Young Critics Award and the Grand Rail d'Or at the International Critics' Week. As the festival run continued, it won the prize for Best Fantastic Film at Fantastic Fest in Austin. It also won the Free Spirit Award and the Audience Award at the 2010 Warsaw International Film Festival. At the Molodist International Film Festival in Kiev, the film received both the award for Best Full-length Film and the Audience Prize. It won a Best Achievement Guldbagge Award for \\"a virtuous mergence of sound and music\\".

They are known for blending a trashy 1960s punk sound with raw folk and country melodies. The band is signed to In the Red Records. Biography The Demon's Claws emerged from Montreal's thriving punk underground, playing a gritty mixture of folk-rock, country, and blues. According to AllMusic writer Mark Deming, the band has been compared to the Rolling Stones and the Pretty Things, as well as punk-blues pioneers The Gun Club. The Demon's Claws was founded in 2003 by Jeff Clarke (aka Lester Del Ray and Rudy Stanko), a former member of The Cut Offs and The Normals. The band was named after a sharply turned piece of track that came with a toy racing car set Clarke owned as a child. Also featuring Pat Meteor on guitar, Ysael Pepin (aka Le Lutin) on bass, and Serge Gendron (aka Skip Jensen) on drums, the Demon's Claws released their first single in 2005 for the German P. Trash label, with a self-titled full-length album appearing on the same imprint later that year. The New Zealand-based Perpetrator Records issued the band's next single, and in 2006 Serge Gendron left the band, with Brian Hildebrand (B-Man Le Duke) taking over on drums; the same year they also added a keyboard player, Piero Ilov. The band toured Canada frequently and made occasional trips to the United States, where they formed a mutual appreciation society with manic Atlanta garage punks the Black Lips, who took the band on road as an opening act and shared the Norton Records Stones tribute 7\\" with them. Along with a single for Rob's House Records, the Demon's Claws released their second full-length album in 2007, Satan's Little Pet Pig, which was distributed by the noted garage punk outfit In the Red Records. In September 2010 the band offered a track for the compilation album Daddy Rockin' Strong: A Tribute to Nolan Strong & the Diablos - they recorded a cover of the '50s Detroit doo-wop \\"Try Me One More Time\\".

It is known from Kyushu island of Japan. The wingspan is 6‚Äì7 mm. Adults are on wing from the middle of April to the middle of May, from the end of June to the beginning of July, from the end of July to the beginning of August, at the end of August and at the middle of October. There are several generations per year. The larvae feed on Boehmeria spicata. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a blotch mine, usually extending from the apex of the leaf towards the base in an irregular blotch. The spring mine is deep brown, opaque and occupying the apical portion of the leaf, while the autumnal mine is pale green, semi-transparent and sometimes forming at the central portion of the leaf. The blackish grains of frass are scattered in the mine. The larva often migrates from one leaf to another. Full-grown larvae leave the mine and spin a hammock-like cocoon on the lower side of the leaf.

He was the eldest son of Barbu Dimitrie »òtirbei, Prince of Wallachia, and the nephew of his rival, Gheorghe Bibescu; his younger siblings included the landowner and industrialist Alexandru B. »òtirbei. Educated in France, he returned to Wallachia during his father's princely mandate, as a Beizadea and aspiring politician. Fleeing his country during the Crimean War, he served the French Empire before returning home to become Wallachian Minister of War and Spatharios. He is remembered for reforming the Wallachian militia during the remainder of Prince Barbu's term. »òtirbei remained a legislator of Wallachia and then of the United Principalities. He was however strongly opposed to the Principalities' first Domnitor, Alexandru Ioan Cuza, reemerging by 1860 as a charismatic leader of the conservative opposition. His involvement in political scandals and electoral intrigues led to his brief arrest that same year, but Cuza was ultimately toppled in 1866. Following this, »òtirbei abandoned his own bid for the throne to serve Domnitor Carol of Hohenzollern. As Foreign Minister, he helped secure recognition for the United Principalities, and made diplomatic overtures toward Austria-Hungary. Failing in his attempt to become Prime Minister of Romania, he was disappointed with the Domnitor, leaving politics altogether. »òtirbei divided the second half of his life between homes in Paris and B√©con-les-Bruy√®res, and was naturalized French. In this period, he was a collector and patron of the arts, noted as Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux's last-ever sponsor. He was also married to the actress and sculptor Val√©rie Simonin, adopting her daughters Consuelo and Georges Achille Fould‚Äîwhom he educated artistically. His parallel work was as a cultural journalist, and, late in his life, as the posthumous editor of Jean- Jacques Weiss and as a memoirist. His controversial dealings with Carpeaux, the status of his inheritance, and his paternity disputes remained at the center of public attention long after his death.

LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 240 His paternal origins were in the Bibescu family, which had its roots in the petty boyar nobility of Oltenia: a yeoman Bibul, living before 1700, was the family patriarch.Iorga (1910), pp. 9‚Äì10 The clan went through a rapid social climb after the fall of the Phanariotes and the foundation of a Regulamentul Organic regime. As a protege of Prince Grigore IV Ghica in the 1820s, George's grandfather Dumitrachi married Ecaterina, a member of the VƒÉcƒÉrescu family, and made friends with her tutor, Vornic Barbu C. »òtirbei. He was a godfather to Dumitrachi's first-born, Barbu Bibescu, whom he adopted, before dying in 1813; Barbu was therefore the only one known as »òtirbei among the three Bibescu brothers.Iorga (1910), pp. 9‚Äì13.

It resumed when he was imposed by Consul Peter I. Rikman into the cabinet of Prince Alexandru II Ghica.H√™rjeu, p. 88 The liberal-minded and Westernizing Pavel Kiselyov become governor of the two Danubian Principalities, also forcing »òtirbei's appointment to government offices.Iorga (1910), pp. 15‚Äì32 This service prompted the establishment to regard the Bibescu‚Äì»òtirbeis as intolerable upstarts‚Äîor \\"Oltenian horse-breeders\\", in the reported sayings of Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 137‚Äì138, 258 Other critics jokingly referred to the brothers as the \\"equine dynasty\\".ChiricƒÉ, p. 357 During those years, Barbu fathered six more children by Elisabeta: sons Alexandru and Dimitrie, daughters Fenereta, Alina, Elisabeta, and Elena.Mucenic, p. 74 When George turned 12 in 1840, his father dispatched him to the Kingdom of France, where he enlisted at the Bollin school, then at Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. During his time at Louis-le-Grand, young »òtirbei met and befriended the future writer-politician Jean-Jacques Weiss, becoming his admirer and, later, his biographer and editor.Badea-PƒÉun, pp. 107‚Äì108 Taking his Baccalaur√©at in August 1847, he studied in parallel at the Administrative School, Coll√®ge de France, and the Paris Law Faculty. His graduation from the latter came in August 1850, when he published with Firmin Didot his thesis De Condictione indebite ou Des obligations qui se forment sans contrat. He witnessed the French Revolution of 1848, and in later years emphasized its positive qualities in disputes with the more conservative politicians.Catargiu, pp. 268‚Äì269 This period of »òtirbei's life also overlapped with a Wallachian Revolution, which toppled his uncle Bibescu from the throne. Having conceded the 1842 election to his brother,H√™rjeu, pp. 99‚Äì100; Iorga, Istoria, pp. 38‚Äì39, 67; LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 141; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 169‚Äì170 Barbu »òtirbei accepted government office, but maintained his independence. He had been sidelined by the time of the revolt, keeping silent during its outbreak.Iorga (1910), pp. 31‚Äì32, 50; Papazoglu & Speteanu, p. 178 However, as noted by his son, he privately resented it as an experiment in socialism.Chiper, pp. 199, 205‚Äì206 Following interventions by Russia and the Ottoman Empire, Barbu »òtirbei was made Prince and George became the Beizadea. Returning to Bucharest, he was incorporated as a Major into the Wallachian military forces and joined the Prince on official duties, including on his 1851 visit to Telega; he was dispatched on official trips to Saint Petersburg, Hermannstadt, and Istanbul.Iorga (1910), pp. 95‚Äì96, 133‚Äì134, 149‚Äì150, 164, 175, 191. See also Filitti, p. 70 Noted as a \\"great lover of theater and invaluable supporter of the actors\\", \\"especially fond\\" of the comedian Costache Caragiale, he was present with his father for the inauguration of Caragiale's Bucharest Theater (late 1852).N. SƒÉvulescu, \\"Costache Caragiale\\", in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale, Nr. 2/1939, p. 378 In 1853 he joined his father's government as Logothete of the Justice Ministry. The cabinet also included Alexandru Plagino, who was brothers-in-law with the Beizadea; later, his brothers-in-law included Ion Emanuel Florescu.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 74, 215, 241, 282; Maciu, p. 62; Iorga (1910), pp. 36, 49‚Äì50, 53, 82, 158, 166‚Äì167; Mucenic, p. 74 Of his sisters, Elena married count Leo Larisch von M√∂nnich from Cieszyn Silesia;Filitti, pp. 70, 72‚Äì74; Iorga (1910), p. 158; Mucenic, p. 74 in 1855, she gave birth to his son Georg, later husband of the Baroness Wallersee.Veronika Matroszov√°, Rod Larisch-M√∂nnich≈Ø na Karvinsku, pp. 10‚Äì11. Karvin√°: St√°tn√≠ okresn√≠ archiv, 1999. =War Minister= A new Russian intervention came in summer 1853, during the escalation ahead of the Crimean War. At the time, Beizadea George was a Colonel attached to the General Staff.Lumini»õa Gavra, \\"Restituiri. Statul major princiar al o»ôtirii (1830‚Äì1865)\\", in Document. Buletinul Arhivelor Militare, Nr. 1/2010, pp. 27‚Äì28 Alongside his father, he paid homage to Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov, an effective surrender.Iorga (1910), p. 152 He was eventually chased out of the country by the unfolding events (as were his younger brothers),\\"On lit dans le Wanderer, de Vienne\\", in La Presse, December 3, 1853, p. 2 and returned to Paris, where he applied for service in the French Army. Attached as a foreigner,\\"N√©crologie\\" in Le Temps, August 15, 1925, p. 4 he was stationed with the Versailles cavalry, and became Pierre Chr√©tien Korte's aide de camp. He spent the war negotiating with the Second French Empire and the Ottomans on behalf of his father, carefully balancing the interests of both powers.Badea-PƒÉun, pp. 108‚Äì109 Russia's defeat restored his father to the throne, allowing »òtirbei to be decommissioned and to return home; Wallachia and Moldavia had by then been placed under international supervision, ending Regulamentul Organic. The new tutelage of the country involved not only the Ottomans and the Russians, but also France, the Austrian Empire, Great Britain, the Kingdom of Prussia, and Piedmont-Sardinia. From Bucharest, George »òtirbei left on new diplomatic tours, visiting Moldavia and approaching its Prince, Grigore Alexandru Ghica; he also had contacts with Austria through Count Coronini. He presented the latter with a paper, Resum√© de la situation administrative de Valachie, which became useful for the Western powers in evaluating the course of Wallachian affairs.Badea-PƒÉun, p. 109 Beizadea »òtirbei was eventually sent to France with orders to complete his military education there.Badea-PƒÉun, p. 109; Iorga (1910), p. 179 He is known to have taken courses at both the Prussian Military Academy and the Military School of Saint-Cyr, following which he became a Wallachian general and Minister of War (Spatharios). This position allowed him influence over the political and social life. His art collection probably dates back to this period, when painter Theodor Aman, whom the »òtirbeis elevated to the rank of Pitar, sent him one of his canvasses as thanks.Badea-PƒÉun, p. 112 Possibly pressed on by the Moldavian precedent, from December 1855 the Beizadea and fellow minister Plagino also recommended to Prince Barbu that he liberate Wallachia's Romani slaves.Gheorghe Sion, Suvenire contimporane, p. 53. Bucharest: Editura Minerva, 1915. As noted by his subordinate Dimitrie Papazoglu, his reformist stance \\"won him affection from the entire army.\\"LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, p. 240; Papazoglu & Speteanu, pp. 178‚Äì179 His work also included teaching history to cadets enlisted at Wallachia's Military School.LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 73‚Äì75 In 1855, he traveled to Czernowitz, where he paid homage to Emperor Franz Joseph.Filitti, p. 70 At the time, the Beizadea approached France's Minister of Foreign Affairs, √âdouard Drouyn de Lhuys, asking him to provide training for Wallachian militias in the event of war with the Ottomans; he also obtained the recall of a hostile consul, Eug√®ne Poujade.Iorga (1910), p. 183 Through his son, Prince Barbu also communicated his plans for establishing the \\"United Principalities\\" of Wallachia, Moldavia, and the Budjak, with perpetual neutrality and full independence, to guard the mouths of the Danube against Russian encroachment. These plans also provided for the election to the unified throne of a foreign prince, unconnected to the boyardom.Iorga (1910), pp. 179‚Äì181 Attending the Paris Peace Conference, the Beizadea resigned himself to the discovery that his father's mandate would not be renewed, and from that point on demanded that a foreign dynasty be placed on Wallachia's throne. The »òtirbeis also began lobbying for the construction of a railway from Kronstadt to Olteni»õa. If built, it would have been Wallachia's first.Filitti, p. 79 Appointed Caimacam in July 1856, Alexandru II Ghica immediately ordered State Secretary Plagino and Spatharios »òtirbei to be stripped of their offices, and announced a formal investigation of the deposed regime, which caused an uproar among the »òtirbeists.Maciu, p. 62 Unpopular with the boyars, and faced with their passive resistance, Ghica sought to reconcile with the moderate wing of the National Party, a loose group which advocated union.Maciu, p. 64 After this period of uncertainty, his father won a seat as deputy to the ad-hoc Divan in the September 1857 race. Both father and son took a reserved stance on the unionist issue, favoring good relations with the Ottoman Empire, which did not approve of the National Party.Iorga (1910), pp. 90‚Äì92 Following Ghica's demotion and the reshuffle of 1858, the »òtirbeis controlled one of the three new Caimacami, Ioan Manu.ChiricƒÉ, pp. 352‚Äì353, 357 =Conservative leadership= The »òtirbeist project was damaged by the election of January 1859, in which both Bibescu brothers stood as candidates in Dolj County.Gherghe, pp. 128‚Äì130, 161, 173‚Äì174; H√™rjeu, pp. 199‚Äì200; LƒÉcusteanu & Crutzescu, pp. 239‚Äì240 The Beizadea also ran at Dolj's landowners college, in what was reported as a dirty race, complete with \\"machinations and base intrigues.\\"Gherghe, pp. 173‚Äì174 As reported by Steoa DunƒÉrei, he also took a seat in Romana»õi County.ChiricƒÉ, p. 356 A set of circumstances, utilized to its advantage by the National Party, resulted in the election to the throne of a Moldavian, Alexandru Ioan Cuza, as Domnitor of both countries‚Äînow officially the \\"United Principalities\\". His father's ambition of reaching the same result from a more conservative basis was frustrated on January 23, when his own candidacy for the throne was rejected by the deputies.ChiricƒÉ, pp. 357‚Äì359; Iorga, Istoria, pp. 339‚Äì342 After his confirmation to the newly-formed Legislative Assembly, Beizadea »òtirbei stood on its hard right: he and Florescu proposed an illiberal press law, drawing protests from their fellow deputy, the journalist Cezar Bolliac.Vasile Novac, \\"Activitatea politicƒÉ a arge≈üenilor »ôi mu»ôcelenilor reflectatƒÉ √Æn paginile ziarului Rom√¢nul √Æn perioada august 1857 ‚Äì iunie 1859\\", in Argessis. Studii »ôi ComunicƒÉri, Seria Istorie, Vol. X, 2001, p. 247 A wider conflict soon erupted between the Cuzas and the »òtirbeis. Already in July 1859, while seemingly vacationing at Mont-Dore-les-Bains, Beizadea »òtirbei attacked Cuza in a protest paper addressed to the foreign powers, alleging that the new regime equated anarchy.Badea-PƒÉun, p. 109. See also Iorga (1910), p. 192 The consolidated opposition, headed by Barbu Catargiu and Constantin N. BrƒÉiloiu, wanted him to lead their Conservative Committee, but »òtirbei dropped out and Plagino was considered instead.Vlad, pp. 4‚Äì5 During that legislature, he and Catargiu, who served as the Minister of Finance, had extensive disagreements over budgetary matters and economic policies.Catargiu, pp. 93‚Äì95, 109‚Äì110, 155 However, according to a note in the Gazzetta Ufficiale, he was the \\"natural leader\\" of a \\"conservative party, comprising for the most supporters of the former princes Stirbey and Bibesco \\".\\"Parte non ufficiale. Principati Riuniti\\", in Gazzetta Ufficiale, No. 68/1860, p. 3 Similarly, historian Nicolae Iorga describes the conservative faction as a \\"party of the pretenders\\", uniting George Barbu with Bibescu's heirs.Iorga, Istoria, p. 371 Eventually, »òtirbei joined the Assembly in the 1860 election, taking the majority vote at Craiova. This race was also mired in controversy, after the authorities alleged that he had bribed the electorate.Catargiu, pp. 183‚Äì186 In March, he joined the committee which was to present Cuza with the Assembly's stances, but he resigned over disagreements with his colleagues.Catargiu, pp. 171‚Äì172 During the ramified scandal, his alleged direct threats against Cuza resulted in his arrest.\\"Correo estanjero\\", in La Discusi√≥n. Di√°rio Democr√°tico, April 4, 1860, p. 3Badea-PƒÉun, p. 109; Catargiu, pp. 183‚Äì186; Iorga (1910), p. 192 He was charged with high treason and, reportedly, \\"Romanians [felt] passionate about the prisoner, asking that he stand trial.\\" The breach of his parliamentary immunity degenerated into a national embarrassment, prompting the collective resignation of Ion Ghica's Wallachian cabinet.Iorga (1910), p. 192 He retook his seat in the 1861 race. This came shortly after violent riots in Craiova, which, »òtirbei argued, called for a parliamentary inquiry.Catargiu, pp. 212‚Äì215 Carried by an anti-Cuza majority opposed in particular to land reform, this legislature elected him Vice President, seconding Catargiu.Catargiu, pp. 213, 237; H√™rjeu, p. 205 According to various sources, he was also the President of that body. An Ottoman diplomat, Aristarchi Bey, recounted in June 1861 that \\"the prince Stirbey\\" and other \\"leading boyars\\" were fostering \\"agitation in favor of a foreign prince\\"; this move, he suspected, had Russian backing.Barbara Jelavich, \\"The Ottoman Empire, the Great Powers and the Legislative and Administrative Union of the Principalities\\", in Keith Hitchins (ed.), Romanian Studies. Vol. 2, 1971‚Äî1972, p. 69. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1973. Together, »òtirbei, Alexandru C. Moruzi and Manolache Costache Epureanu pushed the Assembly into a deadlock, filibustering over Cuza's attempt to introduce a copyhold (embatic), set aside for landless peasants and supplied from the monastery land reserve.L. Botezan, \\"Problema agrara √Æn dezbaterile parlamentare din Rom√Ænia √Æn anul 1862\\", in Studia Universitatis Babe»ô-Bolyai. Historia, Vol. IV, Issue 1, 1961, pp. 133‚Äì134 During those moths, he drew close to the conservative club formed by Apostol Arsache, maintaining only loose contacts with the Catargiu faction‚Äîthey differed on foreign policy issues, with »òtirbei favoring an anti-Ottoman stance that Catargiu thought excessive.Vlad, pp. 7‚Äì8, 13 In July, »òtirbei and Catargiu, who was by then the Prime Minister of Romania, reviewed with alarm a meeting of the left-wing liberals on Filaret Hill, which had demanded increased political representation.Catargiu, pp. 266‚Äì271; Chiper, p. 202 »òtirbei was described as a covert reactionary by the liberal doyen, C. A. Rosetti, but he protested against the label; a polemic ensued.C. A. Rosetti, \\"Domnuluƒ≠ Georgie »òtirbeƒ≠. Arhon SpƒÉtar\\", in Rom√¢nul≈≠, October 8, 1861, pp. 891‚Äì892 Nevertheless, over the following months, »òtirbei sponsored Rosetti's daily newspaper Rom√¢nul, which began advocating for Bibescu to replace Cuza.V. Mihordea, \\"Recenzii. Vasile Netea, C. A. Rosetti\\", in Studii. RevistƒÉ de Istorie, Nr. 5/1971, p. 1064 In June 1862, jointly with Rosetti and Ion BrƒÉtianu, he stepped down from the Assembly to protest Cuza's policies.\\"Donauf√ºrstenth√ºmer\\", in Laibacher Zeitung, No. 140/1862, p. 559 Over the autumn months, he toured European capitals to obtain support for the conservative projects.Iorga, Istoria, p. 375 In January of the following year, with conservatives recovering ground after Catargiu's assassination and other setbacks,H√™rjeu, pp. 210‚Äì221; Ungureanu, pp. 501‚Äì502 »òtirbei signed his name to a letter of protest against Cuza's authoritarianism.Badea-PƒÉun, p. 110 In April, he publicized his tax resistance and litigation with the authorities of Amzei suburb, Bucharest.\\"Revista politica.

Eventually, he was himself toppled by the \\"monstrous coalition\\" in early 1866‚Äîa secretive palace coup in which »òtirbei allegedly had a prominent role.LicƒÉ, \\"Diploma»õia d. ministru de esterne\\", in Ghimpele, Nr. 9/1866, pp. 34‚Äì35 Following the election of April 1866, »òtirbei was sent to the unified Assembly of Deputies, which was debating the new Constitution. In that context, he adopted a classical liberal stance, explaining that both his party and the liberals could agree on the restoration of \\"true freedom\\".Nicolae Filipescu, \\"Conservatism »ôi liberalism\\", in Epoca, March 15 (27), 1886, p. 1 Despite reintroducing such pluralism, the regime change had left uncertain the continuation of Moldo‚ÄìWallachian federalism. In that context, »òtirbei became one of the Romanian diplomats tasked with obtaining an international settlement recognizing continued union under a foreign Domnitor. However, as reported by his supervisor Ion BƒÉlƒÉceanu, »òtirbei also tried to promote his own bid for the throne, which was received with ridicule. Mihai Sorin RƒÉdulescu, \\"Ghislain de Diesbach despre anul 1866\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 45/2006 His father also entertained the notion that either George or one of his brothers would be selected.Iorga (1910), p. 193 Eventually, »òtirbei recognized the results of the April plebiscite and communicated to the Prussian prince Carol of Hohenzollern, that Romanians wanted him as their Domnitor. In September, his father, who was living his final years in Nice, made a show of his loyalty by visiting Carol in Bucharest, pledging his and his sons' \\"industrious and faithful\\" support.Badea-PƒÉun, p. 110.

He and the Domnitor went to Istanbul for the firman, which was granted to them by Abd√ºlaziz. Carol signaled his refusal of direct vassalage by making »òtirbei read the document, which signaled to Abd√ºlaziz that he considered himself an equal.Badea-PƒÉun, pp. 110‚Äì111. See also Iorga, Correspondance, p. viii »òtirbei also took some of the first steps in bringing Romania closer to Austria-Hungary, which remained a staple of the conservative approach to foreign politics. He began talks with the Count von Beust regarding the exchange of consuls, extradition procedures, and connecting Romania's railway grid with the StEG.Iorga, Correspondance, pp. ix‚Äìx; Lucia Tafta, \\"Rela»õiile economice rom√¢no-franceze: aranjamentul comercial din noiembrie 1876\\", in Muzeul Na»õional, Vol. XII, 2000, p. 124 The Beizadea joined the 60-man conservative caucus in the Assembly, and, after the election of November 1866, was recognized as a factional leader, alongside a fellow Beizadea, Dimitrie Ghica.Dan Moroianu, \\"Dezbateri parlamentare »ôi patimi politice √Æntre 1866‚Äì1867\\", in Buridava, Vol. VI, 2008, p. 135 The political realignment made him an adversary of the liberal camp. Its magazine, Ghimpele, claimed that »òtirbei was a comical man, \\"stuffed on princely might and pride\\", whose activity as minister amounted to \\"continuously advising the empires\\" on how to handle Romania. »òtirbei was reconfirmed as deputy for Dolj and Craiova in the December 1867 election, this time without controversy.\\"Romania\\", in Albina, Nr. 7/1868, p. 2 The Domnitor, who found him to be a competent diplomat, also considered him for his Prime Minister. The latter proposal, endorsed by the French, was vetoed by Karl Anton of Hohenzollern, who feared that »òtirbei had not renounced his bid for the throne.Badea-PƒÉun, p. 111 Reportedly, this greatly disappointed the candidate, contributing to his decision to quit politics and the country altogether‚Äîalthough, according to other accounts, he cited reasons of health.P. Boutet, \\"Nouvelles diplomatiques et internationales\\", in Le M√©morial Diplomatique, No. 18/1870, p. 205 As noted in 1880 by a friend, the art historian Ernest Chesneau, »òtirbei sensed a need for \\"independence\\".Chesneau, p. 212 »òtirbei was residing in Nice by February 1868, when he attended a gala for the European Squadron, alongside Alfred Le Roux, Ludwig II of Bavaria, and the Duke of Parma.\\"Epitome of News.

His own one-act comedy, La l√©gende de Saint D√©odat, came out at Firmin Didot in 1905, with illustrations by Maurice Leloir. In 1906, Prince George welcomed to Paris the Romanian student Eugen Lovinescu, directing his own research on J.-J. Weiss.

From this total, Consuelo assigned a special fund to the Institut de France, which grants an annual »òtirbei award. She and Georges Achille inherited most of the assets, including the pavilions. The sisters had conflicting visions: Consuelo, who died in 1927, bequeathed her pavilion to host a memorial museum for Roybet; twenty years later, the municipality of Courbevoie confiscated the land for its own city museum.Badea- PƒÉun, p. 115 The core buildings of the ch√¢teau were razed in conjunction with the extension of La D√©fense, although in the end nothing was built to replace them.

It was first published in 1948. In addition to explaining the economic theories of Keynes, Dillard also includes a chapter on Keynes‚Äôs philosophical development and the ‚Äúsocial philosophy toward which it leads.‚Äù Throughout the book, Dillard provides summaries and examines Keynes' concepts on employment, income, saving, marginal propensity to consume, the investment multiplier, fiscal policy, postwar inflation, interest, and wages.  History  Originally published in October 1948, Dillard's book received nine additional prints with the final 10th edition being printed in September 1961. All editions were facilitated by Prentice- Hall Inc. In the preface, Dillard asserts that the book will cover the \\"economics of Keynes rather than Keynesian economics (Dillard, vii).\\" This distinction is essential as this book was published when Keynes' theories were taking grasp within the Economics world and Dillard opted to discuss the ideas of a singular man as opposed to the swirling debates ongoing at the time.  Reception  Since its publishing, the book has been translated into over 10 languages.

His work was heavily influenced by a visit to Italy.  Biography  His father was a baker who died shortly after Jean-Claude was born. His mother remarried in 1797, to another baker who was an associate of her first husband. An elder brother died in military service. In 1808, at the age of twelve, he entered the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux-arts de Lyon, where he studied with Pierre Revoil and Alexis Grognard (1752-1840). In 1816, he was exempted from military service for being his family's only surviving son. The following year, he had his first exhibit at the Salon, where one of his paintings was purchased by Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry. At the age of 28, he and Victor Orsel went to Paris to work in the studios of Pierre-Narcisse Gu√©rin. Shortly after, Gu√©rin was named Director of the Villa Medici and Bonnefond accompanied him to Rome. While in Italy, he also visited Campania and Tuscany and made the acquaintance of several German painters of the Nazarene movement, including Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Joseph Anton Koch and Johann Friedrich Overbeck. In 1830, Victor Prunelle, the Mayor of Lyon, offered him the directorship of the √âcole des Beaux-arts. He accepted, replacing Revoil, and held that position for thirty years. He created a school of engraving, operated by Victor Vibert (1799-1860), and the √âcole produced seventeen laureates of the Prix de Rome between 1831 and 1860. In 1834, he was named a Knight in the Legion of Honor.Dossier @ the Base L√©onore.

Bevona was chosen by Richard Cordtz as his running mate in the 1996 election for SEIU president, but Cordtz withdrew after Andy Stern entered the race and Bevona ended his candidacy for secretary-treasurer shortly thereafter. A substantial drop in the 1990s in the size of the local and criticism of his generous pay package as president of the local led to Bevona's resignation in 1999.  Biography  Bevona was born on October 20, 1940, and grew up Manhattan, where his father was suspected of having ties to organized crime. Bevona was hired as a filing clerk by the SEIU local, which had been founded in 1934 after a strike by 25 workers at a Seventh Avenue office building and had grown over the years to become one of the largest in the country.Martin, Douglas. \\"Gus Bevona, Ex-Union Chief, Dies at 69\\", The New York Times, September 24, 2010.

SEIU president Andy Stern singled Bevona out for criticism, saying that none of the officials in the parent union were paid anywhere near what Bevona was earning and that the combination of salary, an apartment and a penthouse office was \\"excessive\\". A $100,000 jury verdict in a suit against the local that charged that the local had hired a private investigator to spy on a union dissident also weighed against Bevona. Upon leaving office in February 1999, Bevona received a $1.5 million package that included $850,000 in severance pay and compensation for accrued vacation time that added another $650,000, while Bevona's wife resigned from her position with the local as an administrative assistant and received a $50,000 severance package of her own.Greenhouse, Steven. \\"Chief of Building Workers' Union Leaves With $1.5 Million\\", The New York Times, February 3, 1999.

It is known from Japan (Honshu, Kyushu, Yakushima) and Taiwan. The wingspan is 5‚Äì8 mm. There are four generations per year in Japan. The larvae feed on Pyracantha angustifolia, Pyracantha crenurata, Rhapiolepis umbellata and Photinia taiwanensis. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine has the form of a linear-blotch mine. Young larvae mine in a linear and full-depth mine, reaching the leaf margin and extending towards the tip of the leaf along the margin.

Brooklyn Museum F√©r√©ol Bonnemaison (1766 - 1827) was a French portrait painter, lithographer, restorer, and art dealer. Life Born 8 February 1766 in Toulouse,L√©onore Database, ID LH/286/44. Bonnemaison was educated in Montpellier. Following the French Revolution he fled to England, but returned to France shortly afterwards, and exhibited portraits and other works at the Paris Salon from 1796. He restored five paintings by (or at least then believed to be by) Raphael, which Joseph Bonaparte had removed from the Spanish Royal collection and taken to Paris, and oversaw the transfer of four of them from panel to canvas. The transfer was carried out by Hacquin For this he was awarded the L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur by Louis XVIII. Johann David Passavant believed that Bonnemaison had mistreated the works, supporting his claim with an anecdote told to him by Jacques-Louis David: > On visiting Bonnemaison one day, at his studio, David found him,to his great > consternation, with a sponge full of spirits of turpentine in his hand, with > which he was most unmercifully rubbing the injured parts; and that to all > his remonstrances on the danger of such a proceeding he could elicit no > answer beyond, \\"That‚Äôs of no consequence,turpentine is good for them\\". As an art dealer he is recorded as having sold 150 pictures from the collection of Prince Vincenzo Giustiniani to Frederick William III of Prussia in 1815, and two years later he sold Talleyrand's collection of Dutch and Flemish works to a fellow dealer, William Buchanan. He acted as an agent for the 1st Duke of Wellington, buying pictures, including some notable Dutch genre paintings, on his behalf at auctions in Paris in 1817 and 1818. Wellington also commissioned him to make full-sized copies of four of the Raphaels seized from Spain before their return to Madrid in 1818. In 1818 he published a Suite d'√©tudes calqu√©es et dessin√©es d'apr√®s cinq tableaux de Raphael, and in 1822 a series of lithographs after recent French paintings in the gallery of the Duchess de Berry. He died in Paris in 1827.

All the person has to do is to press, before a time agreed with him or her, an 'I am okay' button on a special landline or mobile phone handset that can also be used normally to make calls. The button-press is transmitted to a monitoring centre and managed automatically. A follow-up system is initiated if a user fails to confirm that they are okay. If the button is not pressed by the agreed time it can be taken as a passive request for contact. By the application of 'lean' design, the process of Safety Confirmation is conceptually simple,Poplar HARCA housing provider especially for people who use it but, as it has to be highly dependable and work reliably over different providers' phone networks, the technology that runs it is complex. Safety confirmation was invented and brought to market by James Batchelor (May 28, 1977, Yorkshire, England), a British technology entrepreneur and inventor who created it when he spotted the shortcomings of the predominant paradigm of personal safety alarms (also known as: community alarms; pendant alarms; autodialer alarms; medical alerts or personal emergency response systems (PERS)) after his grandmother fell. Conventionally, people who may be prone to falling or medical emergencies are provided with a button to press if they need help, which raises a call to a monitoring centre (as in the famous US TV advertisement \\"Help, I've Fallen and I Can't Get up\\"). A study reported in 2010 found that only 8% of people with pendant alarms wore them at all times and that two-thirds had never used them.Telecare Aware By reversing the conventional paradigm safety confirmation provides reassurance for carers and avoids the situation where a person with a conventional alarm system is unable or unwilling to use it. The supplierAlertacall reports that sudden changes in a daily pattern of the 'I am OK' button presses can be indicative of changes in general well being and, as the system is so simple to use, it functions as a cognitive test with deteriorating performance indicating that the user is developing further needs.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. Both the village of Wroxeter and the church are in the southwest corner of the former Roman town of Viroconium. History The earliest parts of the church are Anglo-Saxon but the precise date of its foundation in uncertain. There is strong circumstantial evidence that a church was built in the area of the Roman bath in the 5th or 6th century. A preaching cross was erected in the churchyard in the 8th century. It is thought that the oldest existing fabric in the present church dates from the 8th or 9th century. This consists of large stones which came from the public buildings of the Roman town. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the church had a college of four priests. In 1155 William FitzAlan, Lord of Oswestry, who then held the advowson, gave the church to Haughmond Abbey. At that time it was a portionary church, i.e. a church served by a group of priests who took shares in the income but did not form a corporate entity, as would be the case in a collegiate church. FitzAlan declared his intention of increasing the number of canons to a \\"full convent\\", perhaps meaning 12, possibly in order to create a chantry for the FitzAlan family. Haughmond Abbey was to be the FitzAlan burial place for several centuries but the chapter of St Andrew's church was never expanded on the scale he envisaged. However, the building itself was extended and enhanced. In about 1190 a large chancel was built and in about 1210 a south aisle was added. A chantry chapel dedicated to Saint Mary was built and the nave was lengthened westwards. In about 1470 the lower part of the tower was built. After the English Reformation the interior of the church was damaged, the wall paintings were covered with whitewash and wooden statues and fittings were burnt. The upper part of the tower was added in 1555, incorporating material from Haughmond Abbey. By the middle of the 18th century the population of the village was declining, and the church was becoming unstable because of the inadequate medieval foundations. In 1763 the south aisle and chapel were demolished, and part of the chapel was converted into a vestry. The church was restored in about 1863, and in 1890 a porch was added and the tower was restored. By the end of the 19th century most of the local people had moved away. The church was declared redundant on 1 December 1980, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 18 May 1987. Architecture =Exterior= The church's tower with the gate piers in front re-using Roman materials. St Andrew's is built of sandstone with tiled roofs. It has a nave, south porch, chancel, south vestry, and west tower. The tower is divided by string courses into three stages. It has a plinth, diagonal buttresses, a battlemented parapet with gargoyles, and a pyramidal cap with a weathervane. On its northeast is an octagonal stair turret, also with a pyramidal cap. In the upper stages on the north, west and east fronts are carved fragments which are said to have come from Haughmond Abbey; these include canopied niches, some containing sculpted figures, and ceiling bosses. In the bottom stage is a three-light west window, there are rectangular openings in the middle stage, and the top stage contains two-light louvred bell openings. The north wall of the nave is Anglo-Saxon and contains blocks from former Roman buildings. These blocks have Lewis holes. This wall has a triple lancet window and a three- light arched window. In the south wall are two-three light windows and a porch containing a doorway. The porch has a parapeted gabled double lancet window, and a carved frieze. Set into the top of the south wall is a fragment of a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon cross-shaft. On each side of this is a carved block of similar date, one depicting a beast and the other a bird. The chancel also incorporates some re-used Roman masonry in its north wall, which contains two narrow round-headed windows and a triple lancet window. In the south wall is a blocked Norman priest's doorway. The east window has five lights, and around it are portions of blocked former windows. The vestry has two square windows, one on each side of a round-arched doorway. The sandstone churchyard gate piers were made in the 19th century re-using Roman masonry. The square bases came from farm buildings, the shafts of the columns from the Roman baths, and the capitals from an unknown source. They have a pair of cast iron gates, and are listed Grade II. =Interior= alt=a circular sandstone font standing on an octagonal base, bearing a floral decoration In the east wall of the chancel is an aumbry and an Easter Sepulchre with ballflower ornamentation. The sepulchre contains traces of a wall-painting depicting Christ in Glory. The church has a west gallery. On the walls of the church are painted benefactors' boards and Royal coats of arms. The nave contains box pews. The font is large and round, and was constructed from the base of a former Roman column. Behind the font is a 13th-century iron-bound oak chest. The carved wooden pulpit has five sides. A wooden pedimented reredos hangs on north wall of the nave and is painted with the Lord's prayer, the Ten Commandments and the Creed. The stained glass in the chancel was designed in 1860 by E. Baillie and depicts the twelve apostles and biblical scenes. In the north side of the nave are windows depicting saints, made in 1920 by Morris & Co.. The latter workshop also made the two-light window at the west end, depicting St Andrew and St George and the motto \\"AD.MAJOREM - DEI GLORIAM\\", as a First World War memorial; nearby are two brass plaques listing the parish dead of both World Wars. One of the First World War dead, Captain C W Wolseley-Jenkins, also has an individual memorial tablet on the east end's north wall. The largest memorial in the church is an alabaster tomb-chest carrying the effigies of Thomas Bromley, former Justice of the Queen's Bench, who died in 1555, and his wife. Another tomb-chest carrying effigies is that of Sir Richard Newport, who died in 1570, and his wife Margaret, the daughter of Thomas Bromley. John Barker (rendered as Berker) of Haughmond Abbey and his wife, Margaret Newport, both of whom died in 1618, have another tomb chest, inscribed with the detail: \\"the said John Barker being in good perfect health at the decease of the said Margaret, fell ill the day following and deceased, leaving no issue behind.\\" The Barker family were Shrewsbury merchants and several represented the town in Parliament. They were exceptionally wealthy, and able to marry into the upper strata of the landed gentry, partly because of a bequest from Rowland Hill, reputedly the first Protestant to become Lord Mayor of London. On the wall of the chancel is a marble memorial to Francis Newport, 1st Earl of Bradford, who died in 1708. This has been attributed to Grinling Gibbons. The tower has a ring of six bells. The oldest is dated 1598 and was cast by Henry Oldfield II of Nottingham. Three of the bells were cast in the Clibery foundry in Wellington in the 17th century. The newest bell is by John Warner and Sons of London and is dated 1877. The two-manual organ is in the west gallery and was made by Brindley of Sheffield in 1861.

It aired on October 4, 2010.  Plot  Future Ted states that during his early years as a professor, he had a simple goal: to give a lecture that would change someone's life. While giving a lecture on Antoni Gaud√≠'s unfinished magnum opus, the Sagrada Fam√≠lia, Ted takes an airplane out of his pocket. The story flashes back a couple days earlier, when Barney surprises Ted one day by telling him that Goliath National Bank is reconsidering Ted's design of the new GNB building that had been scrapped before. Ted is intrigued, but decides he does not want to work for GNB, with he and Marshall likening them to the Galactic Empire. Barney seems to accept this, but later is seen to be ignoring Ted. Ted realizes Barney is playing him like he would a hot girl, as Barney really does want Ted to design the building. Barney's attempts to \\"woo\\" Ted seem to be working, as Ted finds himself wanting to accept the job more and more. Finally, Barney tells Ted they have already accepted another offer, with Marshall backing up his claim. Ted goes to Barney and offers to do the job at half price, but Marshall reveals they had not accepted another offer, only pretending to do so to convince Ted even more. Shocked that Barney and Marshall had lied to him, Ted declines the offer again. The story returns to the lecture, where Ted changes his mind and rushes to Barney to accept the job; he however forces Barney to take him out to dinner first, as Barney had stated he never took a woman out before \\"closing the deal\\" first. Meanwhile, Robin reveals she may not have gotten over her relationship with Don as easily as everyone thought; having accidentally seen him on TV for a news show in Chicago, she ends up drunk dialing him and leaving angry messages. Lily tries to get her to delete Don's number, though at first she lies about it and leaves another message while drunk. Robin confronts Lily about some of her unfinished passions and asks her to delete the number of a karate dojo. Lily had accidentally walked into a group of kids training, where to her embarrassment she had been trounced by one of the kids. Marshall also deletes the number of a booker for the club where his band played once, and Marshall is forced to agree they would probably never get back together. When they delete the numbers, Robin also deletes Don's number, but ends up calling him anyway, this time somber and leaving another message as she had memorized his number. Robin admits that the reason why she is having such a hard time getting over Don is because their relationship ended so quickly, it feels unfinished. Some time later, Robin attempts to leave him another message, but finds she has forgotten his number; smiling, she realizes she finally got some of the closure she wanted. In the end, Lily and Marshall show they are still attached to their respective passions; Lily practices a kick, while Marshall sings like he had in his gig. In the tag scene, Lily returns to the karate dojo to confront the kid; now older and seemingly still in the same class, the boy replies, \\"I knew this day would come\\" and he and Lily rush towards each other to fight. Production In a July 2010 interview, show co-creator Craig Thomas said the GNB tower project is a result of the bank getting bailout money under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

The Volga Bulgars had an advanced mercantile state with trade contacts throughout Inner Eurasia, the Middle East and the Baltic, which maintained its independence despite pressure by such nations as the Khazars, the Kievan Rus and the Kipchaks. Islam was introduced by missionariesTatarstan Parliament Introduces New Islam Holiday from Baghdad around the time of Ibn Fadlan's journey in 922. Qolsharif and his students defend their mosque during the Siege of Kazan. In the 1430s, the region became independent as the base of the Khanate of Kazan, a capital having been established in Kazan, 170 km up the Volga from the ruined capital of the Bulgars. The Khanate of Kazan was conquered by the troops of Tsar Ivan IV the Terrible in the 1550s, with Kazan being taken in 1552. Some Tatars were forcibly converted to Christianity and cathedrals were built in Kazan; by 1593, mosques in the area were destroyed. The Russian government forbade the construction of mosques, a prohibition that was not lifted until the 18th century by Catherine II. The first mosque to be rebuilt under Catherine's auspices was constructed in 1766‚Äì1770. =Soviet rule= On May 27, 1920 the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of the RSFSR was declared. Under Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union began to place restrictions on the use of the Tatar language, which used a variant of Arabic script. The Tatar alphabet switched to Cyrillic. The development of national culture declined significantly and religion in Tatarstan was severely repressed. According to Ruslan Kurbanov, an expert on Islam in modern Russia, Tatars have demonstrated a very constructive and effective way of developing their religious and national identity and widening their political autonomy within Russia. In the most difficult years of post-Soviet Russian history ‚Äî years of deep economic crisis and two Chechen wars ‚Äî Tatars demonstrated phenomenal results in the economic development of their national republic.Tatarstan:Smooth Islamization Sprinkled with Blood 1921‚Äì22 famine in Tatarstan The 1921‚Äì1922 famine in Tatarstan was a period of mass starvation and drought that took place in the Tatar ASSR as a result of war communism policy, in which 500,000 to 2,000,000 peasants died. The event was part of the greater Russian famine of 1921‚Äì22 that affected other parts of the USSR, in which up 5,000,000 people died in total. In 2008, the All-Russian Tatar Social Center (VTOTs) asked the United Nations to condemn the 1921-22 Tatarstan famine as genocide of Muslim Tatars.

Held in San Diego, California, during the month of July, the mission of the EdUC is to support and promote the use of geographic information systems (GIS) in educational research, instruction, administration, and policy. EdUC 2008 Over the years, it has grown into a sizable and popular event for those involved in using and teaching GIS in the greater educational community. This includes school teachers, youth program leaders, college and university instructors, community leaders, librarians, museum professionals, and administrators of educational institutions. The conference includes user presentation sessions, hands-on training workshops, exhibits, special interest group meetings, and a plenary session including a keynote presentation. User presentations are organized into several tracks, including teaching with GIS, using GIS for administration and policy-making, community projects, using GIS in libraries and museums, and research on the impacts of GIS in educational settings. Presentation materials are compiled into proceedings which are published online, after the conference. Hands-on training workshops address both the pedagogical aspects of using GIS in a classroom setting and specific software skills. The exhibits provide access to businesses, government agencies, and other organizations with products and services for using GIS in education, including GPS hardware, curriculum and textbooks, software, and certificate/degree programs. Special Interest Group (SIG) meetings provide an opportunity for networking and in-depth discussion of specialized topics. Prior to the establishment of the EdUC, activities for educators were a regular part of the Esri UC. Today, these activities are designed to draw attendees from both the EdUC and the International UC, encouraging collaboration between academia, business, and government. For example, the Academic GIS Program Fair was launched at the Esri UC in the 1990s and has since become incorporated into the Esri EdUC. This event provides attendees with the opportunity to meet with representatives from colleges and universities about their academic GIS programs and educational offerings. In 2009, the GeoMentor program GeoMentor Program. was announced during opening ceremonies at the Esri UC. This program pairs GIS professionals that would like to share their expertise with teachers that want to engage their students with GIS technology. The GeoMentor program operates as a Web- based matchmaking service between the GIS expert and the classroom and provides a structure to help professionals who work in different spheres to successfully collaborate.  History  An ever-evolving event, Esri's Education User Conference has introduced various programs over the years including 4H Club participation in 2006 and the GeoMentor program in 2009. Annual keynote speakers are chosen for their interest and involvement in current issues related to geography or geographic thinking.

Officially announced in 2010, the game entered closed beta in 2011 and open beta in 2013. It was the first and only game to be developed by Red 5 Studios, combining elements from both the shooter genre and some role-playing aspects from the massive multiplayer online genre. Firefall was shut down in 2017. Gameplay Players wear power armor, called Battleframes, that grants health regeneration, jump jets, and a retractable pair of wings that allows players to glide. Each Battleframe has a unique main weapon, a standard secondary weapon, a set of three unique abilities, and a fourth special ability that charges while the player is in combat. There are five main types of Battleframes. The player begins with the standard issue version of each of the five types of Battleframes, and can change between them freely. Players level up by completing missions and collect equipment from downed enemies to further enhance their Battleframe's attributes or to add entirely new features to their weapons and abilities. Upon fully leveling their Battleframe, the player is awarded a token that allows them to unlock an Advanced Battleframe with additional specialized weapons and abilities. Much of the combat is influenced by Tribes, a game the lead designer worked on previously, and centers around the use of jump jets. This feature adds a third dimension to combat that allows the player remain in the air for long periods of time and to quickly travel to the tops of buildings. A retractable pair of wings further enhances the emphasis on the third-dimension as players are able to dive-bomb enemy positions or quickly escape hazardous situations. In PvE zones, the player can engage in: dynamically generated missions and events that spawn at fixed locations throughout the open world, procedurally generated encounters that spawn at the player's location, on-demand missions that the player choose when and where to spawn, and world events that bring players together either to fight off the game's antagonist or to participate in group activities. The core goal of these missions is to allow the player to level up and acquire resources and equipment. Friendly fire and PvP combat is disabled by default, but a player can declare a duel with another player and engage in PvP combat. Once the player has fully leveled their Battleframe, the player can then choose to engage in: an open world PvP zone to collect additional resources, or max-level zones and instanced missions where they bring the fight to the game's main antagonist in large scale battles. These missions also push the game's narrative forward as most of the story is told through instanced missions. At this point, the player's core goal changes from leveling up and acquiring resources and equipment to fighting to keep the player's playable zones from falling to the game's antagonist and acquiring notoriety in the game's competitive leader boards. The game servers automatically creates or shuts down the number of available shards in order to prevent overcrowding in the game world. The spawn rate of missions is likewise adjusted to scale with the number of players online to prevent the players from getting bored or overwhelmed. Firefall's servers use cloud computing through Amazon Web Services to scale the number of servers to fit demand, automatically acquiring more CPU and memory during peak hours and releasing them when they are no longer needed. The game server places players on shards where they are most likely to become a part of an online community by prioritizing shards with the player's friends and clanmates. If the player is not a part of a clan or does not have any friends available, the server tries to place the player on the same shard for each of their gameplay sessions in order build familiarity with the other players who happen to share the same play-space. Players can jump between shards by joining squads with friends or clanmates. The game has a player driven economy with features designed to deter gold farming. The game client directly interfaces with Twitch, which allow players to stream their play sessions without requiring a third-party application. Synopsis The Firefall is an event that takes place in 2178 after an asteroid predicted to be a near miss gets caught by the Moon's gravity and crashes into Earth. The catastrophe plummets mankind into a dark age known as the Nine Year Winter and many large governments, including that of the United States, collapse. During the dark age, scientists discover a new substance called Crystite from the asteroid fragments. Found to be a powerful energy source, Crystite fuels the reconstruction and a new golden age of mankind. Despite the seemingly unlimited potential of Crystite, mankind wanted more and followed the trajectory of the Asteroid to Alpha Prime, a star system in Alpha Centauri. With the first massive loads of Crystite arriving from Alpha Prime, the governments of Earth, unified under The Accord, began construction of the Arclight, a warship that achieves faster-than-light travel by folding space in a process known as Arcfolding. The purpose of the Arclight was to prevent a potential revolt on Alpha Prime that would cripple Earth's economy due to mankind's reliance on Crystite. As the Arclight began its first attempt at faster-than-light travel in 2233, its large engines rips a hole in space that allows the Melding, an extra-dimensional energy storm, to emerge. Unable to complete the Arcfold, the Arclight crashes outside of Fortaleza, Brazil. The Melding engulfs most of Earth with the exception of areas near and surrounding the wreckage of the Arclight, now used as a base by The Accord, with its engines being used to keep the Melding at bay. The playable story takes place four years after the Arclight's attempt to fold space, known as M-Day. The Melding has transformed Earth, mutating the wildlife and reshaping the landscape. The Melding is lethal to the player, which keeps the player constrained to the playable area. The player assumes the role of a mercenary working for The Accord. Crystite acts as an in-game currency that is rewarded to the player for completing missions. The main antagonist is the Chosen, who appear to be humans transformed by the Melding. Secondary antagonists include: Bandits, humans who refuse to join the Accord; Aranhas, an invasive spider- like insectoid accidentally brought over from Alpha Prime; and wildlife transformed by the Melding. The players' main objective is to aid in mankind's survival and to ultimately defeat the Chosen and repel the Melding. Development history Firefall promotion at gamescom 2012 Firefall used a custom server and graphics engine with its renderer based on Offset Engine by Offset Software that was sold to Intel in February 2008. Offset Engine was originally built for Offset Software's first person shooter Project Offset that was cancelled in 2010 by Intel due to the failure of Larrabee. Red 5 Studios relationship with Project Offset gave them full access to source code, which they heavily modified to suit their needs. Modifications to the Offset Engine include a custom texture streaming engine, a character and terrain system designed to handle hundreds of players in a large open world, a vegetation and prop system, custom lighting and FX, and integration of Havok Physics onto the server-side. The server code is built in-house. Firefall was under development for over five years with its title undergoing several internal name changes before it was officially announced on September 3, 2010 at the Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle where it received high praise. The game became available to the public for the first time at PAX East 2011 where Red 5 held a live multiplayer tournament. The game entered its first closed beta test on September 2, 2011, and began continuous 24/7 closed beta testing on April 2, 2012 with the NDA being dropped April 6 during PAX East 2012. The game began monetization on August 24, 2012 allowing players to purchase cosmetic items and time compression bonuses that allows players to level up more quickly. A founders pack that allowed players to purchase access to the closed beta was offered on August 28, 2012. During this time, the game announced $1 million in prize money for its PvP tournament throughout 2013 in order to stimulate its eSports program. The game entered open beta on July 9, 2013. After meeting limited success with its eSports Program, instanced PvP was removed from the game and none of the previously announced $1 million was paid out to the players. Firefall has made numerous changes to its core systems throughout its beta phase: iterating on different progression systems, trying different economic models, and testing different implementations of its mission types and back-end server technologies. The open beta ended on July 29, 2014 with the game being released on Steam or through an in house installer. The art style in Firefall is primarily inspired by Masamune Shirow's Appleseed, Hayao Miyazaki, and Udon Entertainment's Street Fighter. The Firefall Original Soundtrack was composed by Michael Bross and Boon Sim during beta with Chris Lord & JJ Lee composing additional soundtracks for the game's release. Developer Red 5 Studios was an American video game company that was known for its high ratio of former employees of Blizzard Entertainment. The founders previously worked on World of Warcraft.Interview with Mark Kern (Red 5 Studios), Game Tycoon Mark Kern was a team lead, William Petras was art director, and Taewon Yun was part of the company's Korean operation which oversaw the launch of World of Warcraft in Asia. The company's only game release was Firefall. =History= In early 2007, Red 5 Studios launched a campaign to increase the size of the organization by recruiting the top game developers in the industry. Citing a lack of success using conventional recruiting methods, Red 5 turned to San Francisco-based Pool and Orange County-based Airbag Industries, to help them send a personalized recruiting pitch to each of the 100 prospective hires. In early February, the project was completed, and each of the \\"dream hires\\" was delivered a package containing 5 nested art boxes, with an iPod Shuffle containing a personalized message in the center. As of June 2007, three of the candidates had joined Red 5, and a fourth was being interviewed.Covel, Simona, \\"Start-Up Lures Talent with Creative Pitch\\", Wall Street Journal, June 4, 2007. accessed September 20, 2007 On April 23, 2009, Red 5 Studios announced the closing of their Shanghai office.http://www.red5studios.com/en/news/2009/04/23/red-5-to-focus- growth-in-us-office/ The Tribe Grows In January 2010 Red 5 laid off about 30 people.http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/26960/Source_Red_5_Studios_Lays_Off_Workers.php Source: Red 5 Studios Lays Off Workers In March 2010, it was revealed that Chinese company The9 has acquired a majority stake in Red 5.The9 Limited Announces Acquisition of Majority Interest in Red 5 Studios, Red 5 Studios On September 8, 2010, Red 5 Studios revealed Firefall at PAX Prime in Seattle.

Red 5 announced it is to open a new 30-man office in Cork, Ireland, initially dedicated to European support and localization for the upcoming free-to-play shooter Firefall. On December 20, 2013, Red 5 Board of Directors voted out Mark Kern of CEO position, Kern was the last of Red 5‚Ä≤s four founders with the company, all of whom formerly worked at Blizzard Entertainment. On May 26, 2015, Chris Whiteside, the former lead producer of ArenaNet on Guild Wars, then the design director for Guild Wars 2, attended an interview as a member of Red 5 Studios, stated ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been through the fire, and we‚Äôve grown close. These guys (Red 5 Studios) have bonded into a truly collaborative business, and our overall plan is to become the best online world building studio in the business. We know what people remember from our checkered past, but we know we can prove we‚Äôve come through the fire and controversy ready and raring.‚Äù Red 5 Studios in November 2015 laid off 40 employees (including Chris Whiteside) and several more in December 2015.

As of July 7, 2017, the servers were officially shut down. Reception Firefall launched in 2014 to mixed reviews primarily criticizing the quest design as repetitive and lackluster group play mechanics, as well as slow world-travel between areas. Contrasting this, it has been praised for its friendly player community and visually pleasing panoramic areas.

After graduation in 1903 he began working for the Voice of the Negro, a monthly literary magazine founded in 1904 in Atlanta, eventually becoming its editor-in-chief.

By 1906 the Voice was the leading black magazine in the United States, with a circulation of 15,000.Blue, Christopher T., Barber, J. Max (1878-1949) at blackpast.org After the Atlanta Riots in 1906, Barber faced threats from white vigilantes and was forced to flee to Chicago. There he was unable to secure financial backing for his magazine, and Voice of the Negro folded in 1907. Barber's radicalism had made an enemy of Booker T. Washington, whose interventions caused Barber to lose jobs as a newspaper editor in Chicago and as a teacher in Philadelphia. To escape Washington's influence, in 1909 Barber retrained at the Philadelphia Dental School and on graduation in 1912 he set up a Philadelphia dental practice.Louis R. Harlan & Raymond W.

They differed from the 517s (apart from No. 1477 in rebuilt form) in that the outside frames were wider, constructed as a continuation of the valence under the running plate. They also differed in carrying larger U Class boilers with longer fireboxes than the R and S Class boilers carried by all but ten of the 517s. None of the 3571s was ever fitted for autotrain working. They spent most of their lives in the Chester and Birkenhead areas; all but two survived to the 1940s, and three into the British Railways era. The last was No. 3574, withdrawn in December 1949.

Along with all other places in the municipality, its population swelled as it hosted refugees from neighboring parts of Bosnia. When Serb forces overran the municipality in July 1995, they carried out the Srebrenica massacre, killing over 8,000 Bosniak (Muslim) men and boys. =Postwar= Annual commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre, 11 July 2007 In October 2000, Wolfgang Petritsch, the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, declared that the land in Potoƒçari would be turned into a memorial and cemetery for the victims of the genocide. In May 2001, a foundation was established to oversee and finance construction of the Srebrenica Genocide Memorial. Two months later, around the time of the sixth anniversary of the massacre, a foundation stone was laid for the memorial in front of a crowd of 15,000 people. The first memorial was held in July 2002, with about 20,000 attendees. The first 600 victims were buried in the new cemetery in March 2003. The main memorial and the cemetery are here. The biggest donation for the funding of the memorial and cemetery was made by the US government, and the memorial was dedicated by former president Bill Clinton in 2003; during the 10th anniversary commemoration another 619 of the victims were buried. Today there are more than 5,000 people buried here. As more of the 8,200 massacre victims are exhumed from mass graves and identified, it is likely they will be interred here.

After coming through the ranks of his local team VfB 07 Weidenau as a youth, Endrulat moved to FC Schalke 04 in 1973 and made his Bundesliga debut as a 20-year-old for the Gelsenkirchen-based team in a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on 10 December 1974. Having played three times for SpVgg Erkenschwick, he later moved to fellow North Rhine-Westphalian club Borussia Dortmund where he was the second choice goalkeeper to Horst Bertram. When Bertram was injured in 1978, Endrulat had the chance to prove himself between the posts, and played quite well towards the end of the season. However, on the final day of the 1977‚Äì78 Bundesliga campaign, having only been told the morning before the game that his contract would not be extended close-season, Borussia Dortmund travelled to the Rheinstadion in D√ºsseldorf for a match against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach. By half-time of his sixth game in Dortmund colours, Endrulat had already conceded six goals, and his coach Otto Rehhagel asked him if he would like to be substituted, but he said he had no problem with playing on. Endrulat later concluded however that this had been the wrong decision: After 90 minutes, Borussia M√∂nchengladbach had put 12 goals past Endrulat for the all-time record Bundesliga victory. This proved to be Endrulat's last game in Germany's top flight as his contract was not extended. He played out the rest of his career for Tennis Borussia Berlin in the 2. Bundesliga Nord, where he made a total of 60 appearances.

The congregation was founded in 1867. The church building at 18th and Central was constructed in 1890 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. History The Reverend W. W. Baldwin, a circuit rider from Colorado, led the first Methodist church services in Cheyenne on September 29, 1867 in City Hall. Three months later the Union Pacific railroad tracks reached the new town. The Methodist Society was soon formed with nine members and a local physician, Dr. D. W. Scott, acted as the first minister. The Reverend A. Gather arrived in 1868. Two years later the Society bought two lots at 18th and Central Avenues from the Union Pacific for $1.00 and lumber for a white frame church was ordered from Chicago. The church was dedicated by Bishop Ames on September 23, 1871. In 1874 Black members withdrew from the congregation and built an African Methodist Episcopal Church four blocks west. Construction on the current church, made out of red sandstone, began in 1890 and the church was dedicated on Easter Sunday, 1894. It had 55 members at the time. While the new church was being built on the original lots, the old frame church was moved into the middle of Central Avenue with services being held in the building for the next two-and-one-half years. On March 5, 1876, the Methodist minister Reverend Warren married Wild Bill Hickok and Agnes Thatcher Lake, a 50-year-old circus proprietor at a nearby residence. Five months later Wild Bill was shot dead in Deadwood, South Dakota. Architecture First United Methodist Church Architect J. P. Julien designed the new church which was built by Moses Patrick Keefe for $25,000. Furnishings cost an additional $5,000. The two-story semi-Gothic church is constructed of Wyoming red sandstone with a steeply-pitched roof and a three-story tower with a pyramidal roof and four small turrets. As originally built the church measured approximately 91 feet in length by 55 feet and held 750 worshipers. In 1928, an addition to the rear extended the length to 126 feet. The width was extended to the east in 1950 to a total width of 60.4 feet. Twenty-seven stained glass windows were added around 1900.

It has attracted local, national and international press coverage, including being listed by The Guardian in the Courvoisier Future 500, and in July 2010 the founders won the Bento Entrepreneur of the Year Award at the Macworld Awards. History Cad and the Dandy was founded in 2008. The founders met through a supplier as both pursued a similar business idea independently, and they agreed to work together to start the company, each contributing ¬£20,000 of initial capital. Both had family connections to the tailoring industry, giving them knowledge helpful in launching the new company. After initially conducting fittings in rented office space, they came to an arrangement with Chittleborough & Morgan to allow appointments in their shop on Savile Row. In October 2009, the company opened its first permanent store in the City of London. The company achieved a turnover of ¬£1.3M in 2010, and was listed by The Guardian in the Courvoisier Future 500. In July 2010 the founders won the Bento Entrepreneur of the Year Award at the Macworld Awards and in July 2013 they opened permanent premises on Savile Row.Cad & The Dandy, Savile Row Tailor ‚Äì The Perfect Number:13 In 2018, Cad and The Dandy expanded its international operations by opening a New York store at 5a 130 W 57th St Manhattan and also purchasing G√∂trich, Scandinavia's oldest tailoring house. Operations Based in London, the company employs more than 30 tailors in three workshops. All suits are made from British or Italian cloth, and are available either in \\"machine grade\\" or \\"hand stitched\\". Suit prices vary based on the cloth that is used as well as the amount of hand-stitching that is done on the suit. The fully hand-made suits require around 50 hours of stitching, include a basted fitting, and conform to all the specifications for a bespoke suit suggested by the Savile Row Bespoke Association. Prices are kept lower than the average for bespoke tailors by requiring payment up-front. This allows Cad and the Dandy to negotiate discounts of 30% to 40% with their suppliers. Cad & the Dandy launched a new flagship store at 13 Savile Row in June 2013. The store is the first on the tailoring street to hand-weave a cloth before making it up into a fully finished suit.Cad & The Dandy launches Savile Row flagship Believing that Britain's bespoke tailoring industry was facing a shortage of master tailors, the company established an apprenticeship programme in London, with young would-be tailors joining Cad & the Dandy's 22 staff members at its two London locations. One in Savile Row and the other in the City of London in Birchin Lane. Fittings are now conducted across the UK, Europe and the United States. Critical response Cad and the Dandy suits have received positive reviews from style commentators and bloggers, who note the high quality of cloth and tailoring, the strong customer service and the flexibility in customisation options. User reviews on sites such as Qype have been positive, with reviews praising the fit, the service, and the willingness to cater to unusual requests. Mainstream news sources such as the Daily Telegraph have focused on the company's growth and strong financial performance, and on the entrepreneurship of its founders, especially following the loss of their jobs.

But, as was often the case, these Dean engines were new, and had more in common with Armstrong's more recent, and larger, Queen Class, than with the original 157s. The latter had themselves been rebuilds of engines originally built by Sharp, Stewart & Co., which was probably the source of the enduring nickname Sharpies for the new engines. They were also known as Cobhams, after the name carried by No. 162 throughout its life. No. 158 later carried the name Worcester and No. 163 may have been named Beaufort, though this seems uncertain. The class was numbered 157-166 and constructed at Swindon Works as Lot 51, and in their original state they were among the most beautiful engines ever built for the GWR. Some were shedded at Wolverhampton, others at Westbourne Park near Paddington, and they worked on express trains alongside the Queen Class. Most were withdrawn in 1903-6, though No. 165 survived until December 1914.

Protection of State Secrets in the Russian Federation Legislation of the Russian Federation on State Secrets was based on the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Federal Law \\"On Security\\" and \\"On State Secrets\\". The list of information constituting state secrets shall be determined by federal law \\"On State Secrets\\" (Section II), under which inter- ministerial Commission for the Protection of State Secrets generates a list of information classified as state secrets. Public authorities, whose leaders have the authority to designate information as state secrets, develop, within their competence, detailed lists of information to be classified. Guided by these lists, originators determine the degree of secrecy of information, establish the secrecy of documents developed by them (carriers) and their restrictive measures. Under the law \\"On State Secrets\\" it is forbidden to designate as state secrets and classify information: * on emergencies and disasters that threaten the safety and health of citizens, and their consequences, as well as natural disasters, their official forecasts and consequences; * state environment, health, sanitation, demography, education, culture, agriculture, and the state of crime; * on privileges, compensations and social safeguards provided by the state to citizens, officials, enterprises, institutions and organizations; * about violations of human rights and freedoms of man and citizen; * on the amount of gold reserves and government foreign exchange reserves of the Russian Federation; * on the health status of senior officials of the Russian Federation; * on any violations of law by public authorities and their officials. For most of the 20th century, classification in Russia included topographic maps that are fully unclassified in most other countries. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, maps of scale 1:100,000 and less were declassified, but larger scale maps were still considered a state secret. This caused a number of problems for GIS and navigation software makers, and many foreign tourists relied on war time maps prepared by the Germans (e.g. Caucasus area). Around 2010, the declassification process for maps of larger scale (up to 1:50,000) was started. Levels of secrecy Levels of secrecy of documents in the USSR, and still in Russian Federation, from maximum to minimum are: *–û–í (–°–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω–æ/–æ—Å–æ–±–æ–π –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ or simply –û—Å–æ–±–æ–π –≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏) en.:Particularly Important, equivalent in US: TOP SECRET *–°–° (–°–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ —Å–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω–æ) en.:Completely Secret, equivalent in US: SECRET *–° (–°–µ–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω–æ) en.:Secret, equivalent in US: CONFIDENTIAL Limited access (potentially sensitive), but unclassified information *–î–°–ü (–î–ª—è —Å–ª—É–∂–µ–±–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è) en.: For Official Use Only, equivalent in US: FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) or RESTRICTED –î–°–ü do not belong to the state secret.

Using secrecy levels for classifying information that is not classified as state secrets is not allowed. Declassification of information The grounds for the declassification of information classified as state secrets (i.e. removal of restrictions on their distribution) are: * compliance with the Russian Federation's international obligations under the open exchange of information constituting a state secret of the Russian Federation; * change of objective circumstances, which result in further protection of information constituting a state secret being inappropriate. The term of classification of information constituting state secrets, shall not exceed 30 years. In exceptional cases this period may be extended at the conclusion of the interdepartmental commission on protecting state secrets. Limitations Persons admitted to the degree of information \\"Top Secret\\" or \\"special importance\\", may be limited in their constitutional rights. Such restrictions may be placed only on an individual basis by the security organs on the basis of conclusions about the awareness of individuals in the information constituting a state secret.

In December 2009, Tal was taken from her home by Syrian forces, which took issue with the contents of her blog (specifically some of the poems she wrote about Palestine, alongside other social commentary). Tal al-Mallohi was accused by the Syrian government of being a spy for the United States of America, and sentenced on February 15, 2011 to five years in prison. During her ordeal, she was called \\"the youngest prisoner of conscience in the Arab world\\". Detention of Tal al-Mallohi According to various reports issued by human rights organizations, al-Mallohi was arrested by the general security directorate in Damascus on December 27, 2009. The following day, authorities from the Syrian security forces invaded her home‚Äîseizing several items, which included her personal computer, along with various books and CDs. Tal's parents allege that Syrian forces wouldn't relay pertinent information about her alleged crimes, nor were they made aware of where she was being detained. In September 2010, almost a year after her arrest, Tal's mother, Ahed Mallohi (Ahed al-Mallohi), wrote a letter that appealed to the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad himself, asking him to intervene and order the release of her daughter. She emphasized that al- Mallohi had no links to \\"any organizations in Syria, opposition or otherwise.\\" She further reminded al-Assad that the girl's grandfather, Mohammad Dia al- Mallohi, worked under late president Hafez al-Assad‚Äîapparently serving as Minister of State for the People's Assembly. Ultimately, the mother alleges that she was promised by \\"one of the security authorities\\" that her daughter would be released before the month of Ramadan. However, the month ended without this promise being realized. Unfortunately, rumors began to surface‚Äîsuggesting that Tal was being tortured, which was refuted by Syrian activists at the time. On 20 September 2010, DP News‚Äîa website known for its close ties to the government‚Äîpublished a brief article, which alleged that Tal Mallohi was being held at a correctional facility 20 km northwest of Damascus. Referred to in the report as Duma Women's Prison, sources alleged that the 19-year-old was held on suspicions of espionage. On September 22, Ahed al- Mallohi, in a phone call with the Director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, objected to this story. She asserted that she had visited the prison many times, but personnel always told her that her daughter had not been transferred there. Protests Against the Detention of Tal al-Mallohi Free- Tal-Mallohi-Protest-Outside-Syrian-Embassy-Cairo The arrest prompted waves of criticism and condemnation by bloggers and Human Rights activists throughout the world. Arab bloggers published attacks on what is considered repressive random arrests in Syria. Since the Syrian government‚Äîa regime known for prohibiting political opposition and human rights activism ‚Äîenacted emergency laws when the Baath Party took power in 1963, they were not obligated to issue an official response to the inquiries into Tal's whereabouts. The Syrian government has made it its policy to not comment on political arrests. Egyptian human rights activists on September 12, 2010 issued an invitation to organize a protest held in front of the Syrian Embassy in Cairo on September 19, 2010. Protesters pleaded to know her whereabouts, whilst demanding her immediate release. The organization Reporters without Borders was also called upon to pressure the Syrian government to put an immediate end to her captivity. Similarly, Human Rights Watch demanded the release of Tal al- Mallohi.Syria: Release Student Blogger Held Incommunicado Human Rights Watch \\"Detaining a high school student for nine months without charge is typical of the cruel, arbitrary behavior of Syria's security services,\\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. Amnesty International said that the detention of al-Mallohi is a \\"mystery\\" for the organization, adding that \\"the case of this student raises many questions, there is no clear reason for her arrest, and isolation from the world in this way\\". She also said that Amnesty International believes that Al-Mallohi is a prisoner of conscience, and the Syrian government imprisoned her solely because she exercised her right to express her thoughts and aspirations in a peaceful manner. Also noting that Tal is exposed to risk of torture and other types of abuse. Protests have taken place around the world in: Cairo, Pakistan, Germany, France, Washington D.C. and others. In addition to these protests, the first Syrian Virtual Protest took place on October 2, 2010, for the Freedom of Tal al-Mallohi. Earlier Arrests of Syrian Bloggers The case of al-Mallohi is not the first of its kind. Hundreds, if not thousands, of Syrians have been arrested due to their blogging, political activism or expressing their views. Many of whom were sentenced to long prison terms. Reporters without borders reported that a number of at least four influential Syrian internet activists have been behind bars in the year of 2009, making Syria classified among more than 12 countries as \\"enemies of the Internet\\" by the report. Syrian authorities also banned an estimated two hundred website, including Facebook, YouTube and even Wikipedia, but the Syrians citizens and human rights activists, and most users have found ways to get around the bans. Blogs of Tal al-Mallohi  Tal al-Mallohi published her writings in three blogs, one of which is listed under the name \\"My Blog\\" and is most likely that she has been arrested due to an article or articles published on this blog specifically. Publications on \\"My blog\\" consisted of poems and articles in support of the Palestinian cause and critical of the Union for the Mediterranean, which is a diplomatic union pushed by France, between Arab and European states as well as Israel. A picture of Gandhi is published with \\"will always remain an example\\" written above it. Many pictures of Sheikh Raed Salah, and the sons of Mahmoud al-Zahar, \\"martyrs\\" and pictures of Tayseer Erdogan, with the words \\"Thank Venezuela\\", and an image of George W. Bush's face on the body of Adolf Hitler. The background image says \\"No to torture.\\" Tal's last post was on September 6 of 2009 which was a poem entitled \\"Jerusalem, Our Lady of the cities\\". The second is the blog titled \\"Letters\\" (written by Tal \\"English Latters\\") and the first \\"message\\" posted on this blog was entitled \\"The First message to man in this world\\" dated January 19, 2009 Tal's third blog is titled \\"The destroyed Palestinian villages\\" and the latest blog entries from the village of Deir Qaddis dated May 3, 2009.

Another source of opposition is the belief that the Torah, as given by Moshe Rabbeinu (exclusive of the New Testament), along with its interpretation by Chazal, is the supreme and exclusive indicator of Yahweh's instruction to Jews and mankind. Mishnaic sources =Tosefta= References to Christianity are rarely found in Tosefta. A brief mention‚Äîalbeit allegorically‚Äîis found in regards to a Jew who incises his skin on the Shabbat with the intent to engrave a tattoo. the Tanna Rabbi Eliezer is quoted as liableizing (for transgression of Shabbat) the offender for performing one of the activities prohibited on Shabbat, as this is a solid form of penmantry work. As proof, Rabbi Eliezer cites that the \\"Ben Sitdathis is a nick-name afforded to Yeshu -see Ein Yaakov to Sanhedrin 43a\\" stole his knowledge of sorcery from Egypt using this type penmantryas the Egyptians would not allow foreigners to copy their code of sorcery, hence Ben Sitda needed to \\"sneak\\" it out -see \\"minchas bikkurim\\" to above tosefta -hence proving its potency as a viable form of writing. Chazal did not accept Rabbi Eliezer's proof, with the counterclaim of \\"due to one shoteh (fool)foolish in the sense that an individual does an uncommon act thereby making himself a \\"Shoteh\\" (in Hebrew \\"◊©◊ï◊ò◊î\\"; one who \\"veerer\\" from the normal pattern of common behavior) we should make liable all the normal folk?\\"Tosefta to tractate shabbat 12:9 Following the debated assumption that ben sitida is indeed a reference to Yeshu,see Jesus in the Talmud it is inferable from this mentioning that Yeshu -as founder of Christianity- used sorcery as a method of achieving supernatural events -a method discounted by Chazal as illegitimate. Midrashic sources Midrashic literature contains a number of references to Christianity. Of note is the Midrash's insistence that the rise of Christianity‚Äîas well as its illegitimacy as being servicial to Yaweh‚Äîwas foretold to all nations of mankind by Bilaam the sorcerer: =Midrash HaGadol= As the featured Midrashic text of Yemenite Jewry, the Midrash ha- Gadol‚Äîin relation to Yeshu‚Äîcites the ideal state of Judaism as that where no students or members of the religion \\"step out\\" and publicly profess the Rabbinic interpretation of the Torah as invalid.Medrash HaGadol to Bereishit 25:1 =The Zohar= Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai‚Äîas the chief contributor to the Zohar and its associated works‚Äîis recorded as exclaiming dissatisfaction to those that forgo the Torah in favor of its antitheses: Talmudic sources The Talmud‚Äîrelative to other Rabbinic sources‚Äîtakes a unique approach to Christianity in the sense that in differentiates between Yeshu himself‚Äîwho is portrayed as a complete Jew wanting to remain under his Rabbi's tutelage‚Äîand the religion he ultimately established -which the Talmud frowns upon. In Sanhedrin 107b and Sotah 47a Yeshu is mentioned as a student of Yehoshua ben Perachya who was sent away for misinterpreting a word that in context should have been understood as referring to the Inn, he instead understood it to mean the innkeeper's wife. His teacher said \\"Here is a nice Inn\\", to which he replied \\"Her eyes are crooked\\", to which his teacher responded \\"Is this what your are occupied in?\\" (This happened during their period of refuge in Egypt during the persecutions of Pharisees 88-76 BCE ordered by Alexander Jann√¶us. The incident is also mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud in Chagigah 2:2 but there the person in question is not given any name.) After several returns for forgiveness he mistook Perachiah's signal to wait a moment as a signal of final rejection, and so he turned to idolatry; =Tzoah rotachat = =Ben Sitida and Ben Pandira= Rabbinic commentators to the Tanach Among Rabbinic commentarians to Tanach, the Even Ezra and Radak Miamonodes Rabbinic literary works In latter day Rabbinic articles See also * Judaism's view of Jesus * Jesus in the Talmud References Anti- Christian sentiment in Asia Christianity and Judaism related controversies Rabbinic literature ","title":"Opposition to Christianity in Chazalic literature"},{"id":"28981971","text":"Martin Tauamanu Tevaseu ( ; born October 7, 1987) is an American football nose tackle who is currently a free agent.

Biography Oliver Moulton Hyde was born in Sudbury, Vermont on March 10, 1804, the son of Pitt William Hyde. At age 23, Hyde married Julia Ann Sprague, and opened a dry goods store in Castleton, Vermont. In 1834, he sold the store and moved to Mount Hope, New York to manage two blast furnaces. In 1838, Hyde moved to Detroit and opened a hardware store on Woodward Avenue. He began a business manufacturing counter scales at the same location. Hyde branched out in business, opening a foundry and machine shop, and began manufacturing marine engines and other steamboat hardware. In 1852, he began a dry dock business, and also built a sawmill near Saginaw, Michigan. He had a reputation for extensive charity work, and gave or privately loaned a substantial portion of his fortune. Hyde joined the Whig Party and ran for multiple elected offices; later in life he joined the Republican Party. Hyde was elected to the city council numerous times, and served as mayor of Detroit in 1854, 1856, and 1857. He was also appointed Collector for the Port of Detroit under presidents Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore. In 1863, Hyde suffered a debilitating stroke, after which he was almost completely confined to his house. A second stroke followed four years later. Nevertheless, Hyde actively supported recruiting and public service during the Civil War. Oliver Moulton Hyde died on June 28, 1870. He had three living children: Henry S. Hyde, Hattie S. Hyde, and Louis C. Hyde.

Banks is a science fiction novel in his Culture series, first published in the UK on 7 October 2010 and the US on 28 October 2010. Synopsis The events of Surface Detail take place around 2970 AD, according to Banks.) The events occur six to eight hundred years after the \\"Chel Debacle\\", depicted in the earlier novel Look to Windward which is set seventy-eight years after the events in Use of Weapons. Each chapter of the book covers one or more of the six main protagonists‚ÄîLededje Y'breq, a chattel slave; Joiler Veppers, an industrialist and playboy; Gyorni Vatueil, a soldier; Prin and Chay, Pavulean academics; and Yime Nsokyi, a Quietus agent. Some of the plot occurs in simulated environments. As the book begins, a war game‚Äîthe \\"War in Heaven\\"‚Äîhas been running for several decades. The outcome of the simulated war will determine whether societies are allowed to run artificial Hells, virtual afterlives in which the mind-states of the dead are tortured. The Culture, fiercely anti-Hell, has opted to stay out of the war while accepting the outcome as binding. Vatueil is a soldier who has fought his way up the ranks of the war game to a position where he can determine policy. He is instrumental in the decision to cheat‚Äîfirst by attempting to hack into and subvert the war-game, and when this fails by moving the simulated war into the real world. Prin and Chay belong to a species that use the threat of Hell to control the behaviour of their population. While still alive, they enter the Pavulean Hell on a mission to reveal the existence and details of this Hell to the general population. Prin succeeds in getting out, but has to leave his partner Chay behind, where she is subsequently tortured, restored to some semblance of sanity, and finally given a role as an angel in Hell who is able to release one soul a day by killing them. Prin testifies to the Pavulean parliament of his experience in Hell and attempts to convince them that it should be abolished. Veppers is the richest individual in his society, the multi-planet Sichultian Enablement. Y'breq, a frequent victim of rape by Veppers, is murdered by him as she attempts to escape. She is unexpectedly reincarnated (\\"revented,\\" in Culture terms) aboard a Culture ship, having been secretly implanted with a neural lace some ten years before. She immediately wants to return to her homeworld, to find and kill Veppers. The book hinges on Veppers' involvement in the War in Heaven. He initially appears to be a bit-player, but his involvement is gradually revealed to be more and more critical. The final revelation is that he has made some of his fortune by providing the hardware to run the Hells of various species; over a century he has accumulated about 70% of all the Hells. The hardware is located on his country estate on the planet Sichult. He sets up a secret deal to have the Hells destroyed in an attack which is to be blamed upon the Culture. His motivation is that such an attack will release him from his contracts to run the Hells, which would have become worthless if the anti-Hell side won, but which he cannot wriggle out of in any other way. Y'breq travels back to Sichult on the Falling Outside The Normal Moral Constraints, an advanced and \\"very slightly psychotic\\" Culture warship. In hot pursuit is Yime Nsokyi, a Culture agent tasked with preventing Y'breq from killing Veppers. As they and their ships arrive, things come to a head. The Culture agents conspire to arrange that the attack on Veppers' estate successfully destroys the Hells, while simultaneously appearing to attempt to stop the attack. They also conspire to ensure that Veppers' secret deal is revealed. Veppers himself is at the estate's mansion during the attack, where Y'breq finds him for the final, personal, showdown. The epilogue reveals Vatueil's identity as Zakalwe, using an alias that is an anagram of Livueta, the character in Use of Weapons whose forgiveness Zakalwe sought. Critical reception Roz Kaveney of The Independent said that this was a poor book to introduce new readers to the Culture, but \\"far from the worst introduction to Banks's series.\\" Alastair Mabbott of The Herald describes the story as having \\"murder, revenge, pursuit and subterfuge taking place against a backdrop of escalating tension [that] stands up very well, and makes the prospect of further books in the Culture series somewhat less imposing.\\" UK book review site The Bookbag remarked that \\"... what sets this book apart is the quality of the writing and the depth of the author's imagination.\\"  See also  * Simulated reality * Simulated reality in fiction References 2010 British novels 2010 science fiction novels Anarchist fiction The Culture Heaven and hell novels Novels about the afterlife Novels about virtual reality Novels by Iain M.

The cyclist (or stayer in this case) follows as close as they can to benefit from the slipstream of their pacer. The first paced races were behind other cyclists, sometimes as many as five riders on the same tandem. Bordeaux-Paris and record attempts have been ridden behind cars. More usually races or training are behind motorcycles.  Origins of pacing  Cyclists started to use tandem bicycles as pacers in the late 19th century. There could be as many as five riders on the pacing machine.The Bicycle, UK, 21 October 1953, p15 Because of the long distances covered when following a pacer, these cyclists were called stayers, a term used in long-distance horse racing. Companies such as Dunlop sponsored pacing teams,The Bicycle, UK, 6 February 1952, p2 and \\"tens of thousands\\" turned out to watch. A south London rider, J. W. Stocks, set British record of in an hour behind a Dunlop quintuplet on 27 September 1897. The pacing tandems were ridden by professionals, of whom as many as 100 were under contract. Each competitor had six to eight pacing teams for races between . Speeds rose when engines were added to pacing tandems. Arthur Chase and the Frenchman, √âmile Bouhours set English records behind powered tandems in 1898 and 1899.Chase: 33 miles 712 yards on 22 August 1898. Bouhours . Both rode at The Crystal Palace. Chase used a motorcycle to pace him to in a private test at The Crystal Palace, south London, in July 1900 but riders in the USA and in Paris had already done better. Some races mixed pacing with solo bicycles, tandem and motorcycle, with the riders given different start points in compensation.The Bicycle, UK, 1 January 1947, p1  Pacing by car  Bordeaux-Paris, a race of nearly from south-west France to the capital, was paced part of the way by cars in 1897, 1898 and 1899.http://www.veloarchive.com/races/races.php?raceID=bordeauxparis So was Paris‚ÄìRoubaix. The historian Pierre Chany said: \\"Cars made only a brief appearance in Paris‚ÄìRoubaix. On the roads of the north, these noisy cars, high with wooden wheels with their tires nailed in place, raised huge clouds of dust. The drivers, wearing leathers, their eyes protected by huge goggles, were stepping into the unknown! The riders hidden in all this chaos could see absolutely nothing and risked their life at on the edge of a razor. The noise was infernal and the column advanced in the stink of exhaust pipes.\\"Chany, Pierre (1988), La fabuleuse histoire du cyclisme, vol 1,  Pacing by motorcycle  Florian Fernow (stayer) with pacer Peter B√§uerlein at the 2013 European Championhips The first races were limited more by the speed a motorcycle could achieve than the ability of the rider to follow, with being a good average, according to the historian H. M. Ellis.The Bicycle, UK, 1 January 1947, p8 The races became faster as the pacers became faster. Paced races kept audiences enthralled for many decades in Europe and, at one time, in North America. Tens of thousands watched, especially in Germany. The popularity of this form of pacing declined in the latter part of the 20th century. There were few rules. Pacing machines had small rollers set sideways behind the back wheel to avoid crashes caused by the rider touching the back of the motorcycle, but there were few other regulations. Race distances extended to six days, although one-hour and contests were more common. Windshields were briefly allowed but abandoned after the world championship in 1904. Speeds rose and accidents became commonplace. An American, Harry Elkes, died of his injuries from a crash in front of 10 000 spectators at Boston, Massachusetts, USA.Chany, Pierre (1988), La fabuleuse histoire du cyclisme, Nathan, France, , p141 His rear tire exploded at and he was thrown under another rider's pacing machine, which \\"crushed the prostrate man in a dreadful manner.\\"New York Times, USA, 31 May 1903, p1 George Leander, of Chicago, USA, said \\"Only the clumsy get themselves killed\\" before starting a race at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Leander was thrown into the air after , fell to the track, bounced into the seating and died 36 hours later.Chany, Pierre (1988), La fabuleuse histoire du cyclisme, Nathan, France, , p142 A crash in Berlin on 18 July 1909 killed nine when a motorcycle careered into the stands and exploded. The historian Peter Nye wrote: :Motorpace racing was glamorous but dangerous. Falls were common, largely because bicycle tires tended to burst at speed. The riders wore neither helmets nor gloves. They depended on fast reflexes, the rude health of youth, and luck. Despite having all three, Bobby Walthour collected an impressive (or dismaying) inventory of injuries over his career: 28 fractures of the right collarbone, 18 of the left, 32 broken ribs, and 60 stitches to his face and head. Once, according to family history, he was given up for dead in Paris and taken to a morgue, where he regained consciousness on the slab.Nye, Peter (1988), Hearts of Lions, W. W. Norton and Co, USA, , p72 The biggest machines were built by the pacers, using parts from other motorcycles, with engines as large as . The largest had two riders, one crouched over the handlebars to steer and the other sitting upright above the back wheel to protect the rider and to operate the engine.The Bicycle, UK, March 1990Pictured, Sporting Cyclist, UK, January 1967Pictured The Bicycle, UK, 1 January 1947, p8 The pacers wore leathers, goggles and helmets but many riders wore a flat cap. The world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale, set regulations for pacing motorcycles in 1920. Until then standards had been set by the police, particularly in Germany, or by the track promoters.The Bicycle, UK, 21 October 1953, p16 World championships were held annually, except during wars, for 100 years, often separately for amateurs and professionals. Carsten Podlesch, who won in 1994, is the last and reigning world champion. National championships continue in several European countries and European championships are conducted annually. Motorcycles now used include the Triumph Tiger or BMW machines. The motorcycle for motor-pacing has a roller on a frame at the rear to create a uniform distance to the cyclist. Some riders objected when the UCI insisted on them in 1920.The Bicycle, UK, 1 January 1947, p9 The pacer stands or sits upright to offer a maximum windbreak, and the handlebars are extended to facilitate the stance, in a standardized leather suit that allows for the same slipstream effect for any rider. Speeds of can be reached; the average is between . The bicycles are steel, sturdy and have a smaller front wheel to let the stayer bend forward into the slipstream.  Pacing by Derny  Derny publicity material Derny Taon 125, 1955/1956 A Derny is a light motorbike typically driven by a Zurcher two- stroke engine and by being pedaled through a fixed gear, typically of 70 teeth on the front chainring and 11 on the sprocket on the back wheel. The combination allows for smooth acceleration and slowing, important when the rider taking pace is centimetres from the pacer's shielded back wheel. A coupling between the motor and the back wheel ensures the machine will not stop dead if the motor seizes. The first Entraineur or Bordeaux‚ÄìParis models, with a petrol tank across the handlebars, were built by Roger Derny et Fils of the avenue de St Mand√©, Paris, France in 1938. That closed in 1957, though another company, Derny Service of rue de Picpus serviced and rebuilt machines into the 1970s. Derny also built a street adaptation called the Solo as well as tandems and mopeds. The name derny is now applied to all such vehicles, regardless of manufacturer. It is used by the Larousse dictionary as a generic term for a small pacing motorcycle used in cycle races. The machine has to be bump-started. It can then pace riders up to , although races rarely exceed . Riders behind Derny-pacers ride conventional track bicycles. Bordeaux‚ÄìParis was paced by Dernys for part of its route from 1946 to 1985.  Pacers  Cooperation between pacer and stayer includes the use of terms and signals understood internationally, because pacers and stayers may be of different nationalities. The stayer needs to be close to the roller to gain maximum profit from the slipstream; if he gets too close he may hit the roller and fall, if he falls too far behind it, he loses the slipstream effect and will quickly fall further back. The pacer then has to slow down so he can catch up and then accelerate without again losing his rider.  Races  Radrennbahn Bielefeld (2019) Races are in velodromes or on other oval and steeply banked tracks to allow high-speed racing. After a flying start the cyclists link up with their pacers. Riding counterclockwise, passing can only be done on the right, a blue line separating the longer passing lane from the inner. Typically four to six couples compete in a race, covering up to or racing over a set time. = Keirin = The keirin, a Japanese sprint with a paced start which has spread across the world, is a variation of motor-paced racing. A group of cyclists use a single pacer to get to speed and then sprint to the finish on their own.  Records  The first registered distance record behind pacers was by F. L. Dodds of Britain, who on a solid-tired bicycle rode close to in the grounds of Cambridge University in 1876.The Bicycle, UK, 30 January 1946, p14 He was paced by relays of individual cyclists. A south London rider, J. W. Stocks, set an unbeaten British record of in an hour behind pacers on 27 September 1897. From 1893 to 1895, H√©l√®ne Dutrieu set several women's paced hour records, ending with 39.190 km at V√©lodrome Roubaisien. In 1896, Am√©lie le Gall set a new women's paced hour record of 43.461 at V√©lodrome Buffalo.Revolutionary Times ‚Äì The Birth of the Women‚Äôs Hour Record - SB Nation's Podium Caf√©, Feargal McKay, 11 September 2018 The first hour record behind a motorcycle was set at by Harry Elkes of the USA in 1898. He rode behind a motor-powered tandem. The first record behind a pure motorcycle was , by Tom Linton of Britain, at the Parc des Princes track in northwest Paris in 1902. The speed increased but records become more hazy because some were made under restrictions imposed by the Union Cycliste Internationale and others with no rules at all. On 12 October 1950 Karl-Heinz Kramer set the world record for absolute speed behind a motorcycle with on the Grenzlandring. The Frenchman, Jos√© Meiffret, set a record behind a Mercedes-Benz 300 SL on the autobahn at Freiburg, Germany, on 16 July 1962.

Russian He was a founder and director of a school of physiology in Georgia; academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (1939), founding member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR (1944) and of the Academy of Sciences of the Georgian SSR (1941). In 1964 Beritashvili received Hero of Socialist Labor award.Beritashvili, Ivan Solomonovich from The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979) For more than a half-century of his activity, Beritashvili was considered a leader among neurophysiologists of Central and Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union. In the study of higher brain functions he tried to bridge the gap between physiology and psychology and did much to bring them closer together. In 1958‚Äì1960 together with Herbert Jasper and Henri Gastaut, he was one of the founders of the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO).  Life  Britashvili was born in Tiflis Governorate on December 19, 1884 into the family of a Georgian Orthodox priest in the small village of Vejini in Kakheti, in the Eastern region of Georgia (at that time part of the Russian Empire). Following in his fathers footsteps he studied for the priesthood at the theological seminary in Tiflis (Tbilisi). Because he came to dislike the prospect of becoming a priest, the young Ivane took examinations for the school-leaving certificate at the 2nd Tiflis gymnasium in 1906. In the same year he enrolled in the Natural Division of the Department of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of St. Petersburg University and soon attracted the attention of the professors of their abilities and hard work. Beritashvili began his experimental research early, as a third year student under the supervision of the eminent Russian physiologist Prof. Nikolay E. Wedensky (1852‚Äì1922). Beritashvili studied the problem of reciprocal innervation of skeletal musculature in frogs showing that local strychninization of the dorsal horn did not disrupt the coordination of the ‚Äúwiping‚Äù reflex. The results of his first work were published in 1911. In the preceding year he graduated from the university and was invited by Wedensky for the first 2.5 years and then for a further 2 years to work in the University Physiological Laboratory. At the recommendation of Wedensky, Beritashvili left for Kazan in autumn 1911 to work with Prof. A. P. Samoilov (1867‚Äì1930) to master the method of registering electric currents in nerves and muscles by the string galvanometer that, in turn, Samoilov had learned from Willem Einthoven (1860‚Äì1927) in Leiden in 1904. Later, in the spring of 1914, again with Wedensky's support, Beritashvili joined Rudolf Magnus (1873‚Äì1927) in Utrecht to study the techniques of mammalian neurosurgery (decebreration, sectioning the dorsal roots, etc.), the principles of body posture and tonic neck and labyrinthine reflexes in mammals (later the Magnus‚Äìde Kleijn reflexes). At the start of the World War I Beritashvili had to cease his research and return to St. Petersburg. In 1915 Beritashvili had to leave St. Petersburg and move to Odessa as a Senior Assistant to Prof. V. V. Zavyalov at the Chair of Physiology in the Physical and Mathematical Department of Novorossyisk University. This Chair was established by Ivan Sechenov (1829‚Äì1905) who had held the Chair for six years, from 1870 to 1876. One year later, after Beritashvili had been appointed a private docent, he began giving lectures in the course on the physiology of the nerve-muscle system. During that period he studied defensive reflexes in dogs by the method of Vladimir Bekhterev (1857‚Äì1927). After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia attained freedom and independence for the short period between 1918 and 1921. During it, in 1918, Ivane Javakhishvili established the first University of Tiflis and Beritashvili received an invitation to organize its physiological department and the course instruction in physiology. In 1919 he set up this Department and from that time onward Beritashvili succeeded in progressively developing intensive physiological teaching and research in Georgia. By 1920‚Äì1921 he had published in Tiflis the first Georgian-language textbook on physiology, in two volumes and with a practical guide, and in 1922 in the Russian language. At the same time, he founded a physiological research laboratory and started intensive work. Beritashvili thus realized what for Ivane R. Tarkhnishvili (Ivan Tarkhanov, Tarchanoff) (1846‚Äì1908), the Georgian- Russian physiologist discoverer of the psychogalvanic reflex, had been only a dream‚Äîto establish a laboratory in his native land. Later, in 1937, Beritashvili published a comprehensive handbook in Moscow in Russian entitled General Physiology of Nerve and Muscle Systems. For this book he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1941. Later revised and enlarged‚Äîin 1947 and 1959‚Äîthis book guided many generations of ‚ÄúSoviet‚Äù physiologists. A number of other fundamental handbooks, General Physiology of the Central Nervous System (1948), the third revised and enlarged edition of 1966, and Structure and Function of the Cerebral Cortex of 1969, were also published in Moscow in Russian. During this period Beritashvili was one of the organizers and founders of the Georgian Academy of Sciences. He was initially Head of the Biological Division of the Caucasian Branch of Academy of Sciences of the USSR (1933‚Äì1941), and after the foundation of the Georgian Academy of Sciences he was Head of its Department of Biomedical Sciences (1941‚Äì1974). In 1938 Beritashvili was awarded the Pavlov Prize for important contributions to the study of the peripheral and central nervous systems, and higher brain functions. In 1962 he was also awarded the Sechenov Prize for his book Neural Mechanisms of Higher Vertebrate Behavior, which, with the support of H. Jasper, was translated from Russian into English and published in Boston (1965). In 1939 Beritashvili established the Georgian Society for Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology (since 1957 the Georgian Physiological Society). In the same year he was elected an Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and in 1944 became a founding member and an Academician of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR. During his long life Beritashvili was the author of almost 400 research and review papers, many chapters in books, a dozen monographs, and the comprehensive three volume handbook and the two- volume textbook that were republished many times. He wrote his first book in 1916, at the age of 32, and his last, revised and expanded, was published in 1974, the year of his death when he was almost 90 years old. Ivane Beritashvili died of acute pneumonia on December 29, 1974 in Tbilisi, two weeks before his 90-year jubilee. He was buried in the square of Tbilisi State University, alongside the founder of the university, Ivane Javakhishvili.  Research  = Neurophysiology = On the basis of experiments with local strychninization of the spinal cord in frogs, Beritashvili determined in 1910 that the coordinating apparatus for flexure reflexes is located in the dorsal horn of the segment where the sensory fibers of the corresponding receptive field entered. It was his first work, 40 years later, with the same experimental design but using the oscilloscope and registration of electrical potentials of the sensory and motor roots, he confirmed the correctness of the principles he had formulated earlier. In particular, he showed in 1950 that even when poisoned with strychnine, intercalary or internuncial neurons (‚Äúinterneurones‚Äù) of one segment excited through the appropriate dorsal root fibers activated motor neurons in the given segment but without involving the existing interneurons. In Wedensky's laboratory, and at the same time as Charles S. Sherrington (1857-1952), Beritashvili used the string galvanometer to study the central coordination of spinal reflexes in the registration of action currents of antagonist muscles. In 1913‚Äì1914 he discovered the rhythmic nature of reciprocal inhibition. Ten years later, in 1924, E. D. Adrian, J. F. Fulton, and E. T. Liddell (1924) confirmed these findings. As early as 1912 his supervisor Alexei Alexeyevich Ukhtomsky (1875-1942) proposed that Beritashvili should study reciprocal excitation and inhibition in cats and two years later they resumed work on tonic reflexes and electric potentials of muscle in decerebrated cats. After returning from working with Magnus, Beritashvili renewed his experiments on cervical and labyrinthine tonic reflexes with even more success. He showed that during the rotation of the neck around the body in which the receptors of the neck muscles were stimulated, and during changes of head position, in which labyrinthine receptors were stimulated, the only effect was an increase of excitability of certain tonic centers. By 1915 he concluded that the tonic reflex appeared to be due to excitation of these tonic centers in response to additional peripheral stimulation. R. Magnus included these data in his famous book K√∂rperstellung of 1924. Beritashvili was greatly interested in the problems of general inhibition. Together with collaborators he showed that this phenomenon, first discovered by Ivan Sechenov in 1863, could be induced by the stimulation of the skin, the sensory and autonomic nerves, the visceral organs, and the surface of the brain. Beritashvili concluded that general inhibition was an indispensable component of the central nervous system (CNS) response to any stimulation, even subthreshold stimulation that evoked an outward reaction. The biological significance of general inhibition consists in the fact that: (1) in response to stimuli important for life, excitation is restricted to the nerve centers responsible for the appropriate outward reaction; (2) under weak stimulation, general inhibition protects the organism from the wasteful expenditure of energy. In 1936‚Äì1937 Beritashvili arrived at the very interesting conclusion that general inhibition was a function of what he called the ‚Äúneuropil‚Äù of the brainstem that not only exerted general inhibition but also general excitation on the CNS. What Beritashvili called the neuropil is the structure, which is now well known as the reticular formation. Sadly, his four papers on this problem were published only in Soviet journals and the world physiological community did not pay them proper attention. In 1949 Horace Winchell Magoun and Giuseppe Moruzzi rediscovered and described this phenomenon precisely. While studying single reflex contractions of muscles in cats in 1941, Beritashvili demonstrated, independently of B. Renshow, the antidromic inhibitory effect. Moreover, he showed that antidromic inhibition extends through several segments and even both sides of the spinal cord. Beritashvili was one of the first physiologists to appreciate fully the role of dendrites and in 1941 formulated the notion that dendrites generate local, non-conductive currents in response to impulses. Now this principle is well proven for apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. Before World War II, Beritashvili began an extraordinary line of experimentation that, figuratively, ultimately provided the giant's shoulders on which Roger Wolcott Sperry (1913‚Äì1994) stood to receive his 1981 Nobel award. From 1936 to 1940, interrupted by the war and never resumed, Beritashvili with his assistant Nina Chichinadze (1896-1972) performed a series of ingenious experiments, testing the ability of one cerebral hemisphere to search out memories initially laid down in the other. Although the puzzle posed by the ‚Äútwo brains‚Äù and the huge band of fibers connecting them, had been recognized for centuries, and desultorily explored, almost nothing was known concerning hemispheric interchange, if any. They showed that training the pigeon via one eye, to distinguish different colored patterns, conveyed no advantage to learning with the other, untrained eye. In other words, for these complex visual stimuli what had been learned with one hemisphere was inaccessible to the other. Then they showed that, with the same stimuli and procedure, switching eyes with cats or puppies did not disturb the memory for the discrimination; either the bilaterality of the optical input had allowed each hemisphere to learn simultaneously, or one hemisphere had behaviorally effective access to memories held in the other. Possibly consequent to the ensuing war, this paper seems often to have escaped attention, despite its being the foundation for the extensive investigation of interhemispheric mnemonic processes in the last half of the 20th century. = Behavior = Beritashvili began to investigate animal behavior while studying conditioned reflexes in Tbilisi in the 1920s. He introduced a new experimental approach allowing the free movement of animals. In contrast to Pavlov, he declined to use a stand for dogs and observed the behavior of animals (rabbits, cats, dogs, monkeys) during unrestricted locomotion within the experimental space. It was a good and bold decision, which provided more natural conditions for the study of acquired reflexes and behavior. Through this peculiar method, Beritashvili made an important contribution to the science of animal behavior.  \\"Free Behavior\\"  Early on in the Tbilisi period (1919‚Äì1941), Beritashvili grew dissatisfied with the unnatural restraints that the conditioning procedure imposes on the animal, and went on to develop a paradigm of ‚Äúfree behavior‚Äù in most of his subsequent work on goal-directed behavior. Among his most important decisions, he abandoned the Pavlov/Bekhterev paradigm for the study of conditional reflexes. He was highly critical of this approach, as well as of the behaviorism, prevalent in North America at that time. Instead, he was attracted by the common knowledge of the ability of dogs to find their way to food, and the brief experiments of Wolfgang K√∂hler (1887-1967) testing this ability in dogs as well as in chimpanzees. However, unsatisfied with K√∂hler's few observations, as well as with Pavlov's explanation of them as examples of conditional reflexes, Beritashvili committed himself to testing behavior in freely moving animals‚Äîa method that was inherently natural and versatile. The prototypical example of such learning is that of a hungry dog, brought for the first time into a particular room and fed there at a specific place. Following such a single exposure, the animal would run directly to that place of food immediately upon entering that same room, even if this occurred several months later.  Image-driven behavior  In the study of conditioned reflexes by the method of free movements, Beritashvili was confronted with actions that could not be explained by or described as conditioned reflexes. For instance, if the animal only once found food at a given place, on that and following days it ran to the same place. Beritashvili concluded that in higher vertebrates an image of the food and its location arose during the animal's perception of the food. This image was reproduced when the animal was in the same situation; moreover the animal later behaved in the same manner by sniffing, etc., if it returned to the place where it had first found the food. This orientating, or investigatory image-guided behavior, supposed the projection of the image of the object the animal recognized onto the outer environment where it had first perceived the food. Such image-regulated behavior was termed by Beritashvili psychoneural, or later image-driven behavior. He assumed this behavior to be a complex of voluntary movements peculiar to higher vertebrates and mammals as well as to little children. He supposed that whenever a feeding behavior is learned that is directed towards a particular food box, it originally conforms to the reproduced food image. The image of the food box's location is also reproduced and can play an accessory role. Thus, Beritashvili straightforwardly called the total feeding behavior of an animal ‚Äúimage- driven‚Äù, in case its movements during the task were unrestrained. While such descriptive terminology carries some prejudice from the days of behaviorism as being hopelessly anthropomorphic, denying the validity of the term is equally suspect. Given the manifold similarities not only in the anatomy, but also in the psychophysics of many lower primates and man, it is strange to deny that equivalent anatomy and physiology generate similar percepts. Human ‚Äúimage- driven‚Äù behavior is itself a sufficiently general experience so that a diminished form thereof seems defensibly lucid in describing the equivalent phenomenon among mammals.  Beritashvili - \\"Anti-Pavlovian\\"  In 1947, Beritashvili first summarized his theory in the book Basic Forms of Neural and Psychoneural Activity, and then extended it in his next monograph Neural Mechanisms of Higher Vertebrate Behavior (1961, translated into English in 1965). Meanwhile, he had studied problems of spatial orientation in mammals in a special book published in 1959. On the background of the country's difficult political situation, however, the new lines of research opened up in these works received negative reactions from the Pavlovian school‚Äîparticularly after the publication of his 1947 book. Beritashvili's conclusion that psychoneural activity differed in principle from conditioned reflexes led to a dispute among Russian physiologists, and provided the basis for classifying Beritashvili among the ‚Äúanti-Pavlovians.‚Äù Before the death of Stalin and the ensuing abatement of terror, Beritashvili and many of his leading fellow physiologists ‚Äî Leon Orbeli, Pyotr Anokhin, A.D. Speransky, Lina Stern, N.A. Rozhansky, and others‚Äîwere called before the 1950 joint scientific sessions (of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences) to confess to being ‚Äúenemies of the doctrine of Pavlov‚Äù.This atmosphere of terror and repression kept Beritashvili and most Soviet scientists crucially isolated and, in great many instances (e.g., Lysenkoism, Pavlov ‚Äúworship‚Äù), hobbled by political restraint. Bravely, Beritashvili followed his own path, and held to a course of highly original experimentation after the period of seclusion from 1950‚Äì1955. However, he had to remain sensibly cautious in his Western contacts, being especially vulnerable due to his previous ‚Äúforeign‚Äù publications.  Spatial Orientation  Between 1955 and 1959, after his rehabilitation, Beritashvili focused his research on problems of spatial orientation in higher vertebrates, infants, and man. Spatial orientation in the environment manifests in the ability to project or localize the position of a perceived object in the outer environment in relation to oneself and other external objects. Beritashvili established that various sensory receptors are involved in producing the image of spatial orientation, but that only the stimulation of visual, auditory and labyrinthine receptors can induce images of the spatial arrangement of external objects in the environment and their spatial relations to the animal's location. With subtle experiments he demonstrated that the stimulation of labyrinthine receptors during animal locomotion is highly important for spatial orientation in the environment, and that proprioceptive excitation is not involved in producing the image of the route the animal has traveled. However, upon repeated traversal of the route, the stimulation of proprioceptors turns into conditional signals for movements that then proceed automatically like chain-conditioned reflexes. Experiments extirpating various cortical regions in dogs and cats demonstrated that the front half of the suprasylvian fissure is responsible for spatial orientation under labyrinthine and auditory stimulation. Beritashvili concluded that spatial orientation in higher vertebrates is reflected in their ability to project an object into space and localize its position in relation to itself or to other objects, and this after a single perception of the respective object by the animal. Also, spatial orientation is required to approach the object or to move from one object to another when the animal neither sees them nor perceives the objects through any other senses. Moreover, all sensory information from receptors may play an important role in spatial orientation. However, the optic receptors and vestibular semicircular canals, utricle, and saccule play a most significant part, since their exclusion renders normal orientation in space impossible. In infant ontogenesis spatial images arise first via visual perception, then through vestibular, and finally through auditory perception. Special spatial orientation studies in the blind showed that the latter judged obstacles in the distance by sensations in the face area, based on cutaneous receptor stimulation resulting from conditional reflex constriction of facial muscles. All these investigations were included in Beritashvili's book Nervous Mechanisms of Spatial Orientation in Mammals, published in Russian (1959). In our view, Beritashvili, as the first to study spatial navigation in higher vertebrates, in parallel with Edward C. Tolman (1886-1959), deserve a mention in the Nobel background document for 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to John O'Keefe, and Edvard I. Moser and May- Britt Moser. His contribution warrant reappraisal, as do these of many other scientist who worked in the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern European countries, and who were often vilified and isolated from the international scientific community.  Vestibular System  Beritashvili was acutely aware that image-driven behavior referred not only to an object or event, but also a location. Thus, returning to his early experiments with Rudolf Magnus on the eve of World War I in Utrecht, he performed an extensive analysis of the role of the vestibular system, as opposed to muscular proprioception, in guiding orientation in space. The results were clear, both in cats and dogs, and in children. In the absence of vision, the labyrinthine system, and not muscular proprioception, provides the information necessary for orientation and path registration. Labyrinthectomized animals, even after several months of recovery and specific training, were unable to follow a newly given path when vision was absent (due to blindfolds). With sufficient repetition, they could be trained to pursue a particular path in an unchanging sequence. In other words, they could learn a sequence of turns, but lacking vision as well as the vestibular system, they were wholly disoriented. This has now been fully confirmed with rats. Recent work with human subjects passively translocated through space has suggested that cues other than those provided by the otoliths are important for perceiving features of lateral movement. However, Beritashvili's observations on deaf-mute children definitively demonstrate that in the absence of vision, the labyrinths are essential for orientation and for subsequent following of a path along which these children have been led, or even passively transported. The deaf-mutes lacking labyrinthine function were totally disoriented in this situation, whereas blind children performed significantly better than normal, blindfolded children.  Image-driven Memory  Beritashvili's work in the last decade of his life was devoted to memory research. Using multiple variations of this investigation, Beritashvili studied the mnemonic capabilities of various vertebrates from fish to microcephalic and normal children, the effect of restricted sensory input, and the removal of various portions of the CNS in animals. He distinguished three types of vertebrate memory: image-driven memory, emotional memory, and conditioned-reflex memory. In his experiments, image-driven memory was investigated by the method of delayed responses during free movement. Together with his collaborators, Beritashvili carried out fundamental research on the phylogeny of the image-driven memory and found that particularly in fish, amphibians and reptiles, only short-term memory images are formed, but in birds (hens, pigeons) long-term memory images also exist. In the phylogenetic development from fish to monkey, short-term memory extends from several seconds in fish to some dozens of minutes in higher vertebrates. Long-term memory extends from several minutes in birds to several months in dogs and monkeys. According to Beritashvili, image-driven memory in all vertebrates is a result of forebrain activity; with the development of the cortex, image-driven memory becomes its most important function. For instance, the associative areas of the proreal fissure and temporal lobe play a key role in the retention of the images of recognized objects. Beritashvili considered the substrate of image-driven memory to be located in the neural circuits between the proreal fissure, the visual cortex, the inferior temporal cortex, and the hippocampus. Beritashvili's book on memory, Vertebrate Memory, its Characteristic and Origin, was first published in Russian in Tbilisi (1968) and soon translated into English (1971). The second, revised and enlarged edition was published in Moscow (1974) not long before his death.  Selected publications  * Beritov, I.S.

He was a professor of chemical engineering, dean of the department of chemical engineering and the ninth rector magnificus of the Eindhoven University of Technology. Biography Martinus Tels was born on 16 August 1926 in Rotterdam. He was the son of Harry Hijman Tels (a lawyer) and Lucie Juliette Elias. The Tels family was a reasonably prominent Jewish family in The Netherlands (in addition to Harry Hijman being a lawyer, Harry's grandfather Hartog Hijman Tels was the first editor of the NRC Handelsblad), as was the Elias family (the Elias family owned a large textile factory); because of this the family was added to the Barneveld group during World War II. As part of this group, Martinus Tels was interned in Barneveld, then in the Westerbork transit camp and finally in the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Surviving the war, he returned to The Netherlands by way of Switzerland in 1945. Arriving back in The Netherlands he completed his secondary education and then attended the Delft University of Technology to study chemistry. He stayed on at Delft as an associate professor (then called a hoofdassistent in Dutch), doing research in mixing solid oils with sugars and the purification of surface water. During these years he also worked for zionist causes and was president of the (Dutch: Nederlandse Zionistenbond). In 1960 he moved to Caltex, to become head of the distillation lab. He was with Caltex until 1969 and in that time also headed the pilot plants division and finally the division for \\"applied mathematics and electronic data processing\\". In 1967 he was also appointed extraordinary professor of Physical Technology (now called Chemical Engineering) at the University of Amsterdam; here he researched drag-reduction, the mixing of liquids in packed beds and thermal stability of adiabatic stirred reactors. Professor Tels was appointed full professor of physical technology at the department of Chemical Engineering of the Eindhoven University of Technology in 1974. In this position he researched the uses of pyrolysis in physical technology and in the separation of solid waste materials. His expertise brought him into contact with the Van Gansewinkel waste management company, which he advised for years. He was one of the first researchers in The Netherlands working on waste management; for this reason he was jokingly called \\"the garbage professor\\". Eindhoven University of Technology archives. Aside from his research, Tels had a reputation for being a good teacher and employing (often self-deprecating) humor in order to engage his students. He was appointed vice dean of the department in 1977 and became dean in 1982. Tels was appointed rector magnificus of the university in 1988. In his period as rector he focused on strengthening ties with the city of Eindhoven and with local industry. He was asked to resign as rector by the university council in 1991, following the Buck-Goudsmit scandal. Although he was finally not forced out, he resigned as rector to prevent an administrative crisis at the university. Upon his resignation he was awarded the Honors Medal of the University by the TU/e, which he received from his successor as rector Professor Van Lint. The year after his retirement from the university he was made a Knight in the Order of the Dutch Lion, after being nominated jointly by the Minister of Education for his work as a professor and by the Minister of the Environment for his work in environmental technology. Professor Tels continued advising the Van Gansewinkel Group until 1996, through Swiwah B.V., a one-man company he founded (swiwah is Hebrew for \\"environment\\"). He died on January 2, 2008, after suffering a heart attack.

It has been a poor area since Aztec times, with many residents today living in large tenements called vecindades. The area, particularly the Tepito neighborhood, is known for crime, especially the sale of stolen merchandise and drugs. It is home to the very large Tepito tianguis or market, and also has two major places of worship dedicated to Santa Muerte. Description The boundaries of the colonia are defined by the following streets: Canal del Norte on the north, Paseo de la Reforma on the west, Eje 1 Norte Heroes de Granaditas on the south and Eje 1 Oriente Av. Del Trabajador on the east. The colonia, especially the Tepito neighborhood, is known as a high crime area in Mexico City. It is known for the handling and selling of stolen merchandise as well as drug dealing, mostly of marijuana. According to a city statistics, 14.45% of the city‚Äôs jail population indicates this colonia as its residence. Another major problem for the area‚Äôs infrastructure is the theft of electrical services by residents and businesses tapping directly into overhead wires and bypassing meters. In May 2010, the Comisi√≥n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), or federal electricity commission, announced steps to eliminate these practices, as well as the replacement of faulty transformers and other equipment. Schools, all public institutions, in the area include Bertha Dominguez Preschool Capep Cuauhtemoc 3 Special Needs School, Cedex Jorge Casahonda Castillo Technical High School, Cei Cuautemoc V Primary, Cendi Gdf Tepito 1 Ropa y Telas Primary, Cendi Gdf Tepito 2 Varios Primary, Cendi Gdf Tepito 3 Zona Primary, Dolores Correa Zapata Primary, Escuela de la Musica Mexicana Technical School, Escuela Secudaria Tecnica 3 Technical High School, Escuela Secundaria Tecnica 42 Technical High School, Estado de Durango Primary and Estado de Zacatecas Primary. There is a Houses of Hospitality for Immigrants and the Deported in Mexico and Guatemala located at the Albergue Ej√©rcito de Salvaci√≥n on Labradores Street. History This area north of the historic center in Aztec times covered by lake and a small, poor community with lived by fishing and other aquatic activities. It was subdued by the Aztecs quickly, but its original residents were barred from trading in the large nearby Tlatelolco market. It soon became a place to stay for those bringing goods into this market to sell, leading to the Aztec name Mecamalinco, roughly translating to ‚Äúfor carriers.‚Äù After the lake here dried, much of the land was occupied by the Carmen monastery. The city was steadily growing northward up to the monastery‚Äôs lands which prevented the building of road north out of town as late as 1864. However, the Reform Laws soon decommissioned the monastery and its lands broken up by new roadways. Colonia Morelos was planned and subdivided by Juan Violante in 1882 on part of these lands. The first housing lots were sold in 1886 and the original extension was diminished as sections broke off to form other colonias. From its beginning, the colonia has been inhabited by the lower-classes mostly laborers and craftsmen, which lived and continue to live in large ‚Äúvecindades‚Äù or tenements. In 2007, the city government expropriated two large blocks with the rationale of reducing crime in the colonia located on Tenochtitlan and Jes√∫s Carranza streets, an area locally known as ‚ÄúLa Fortaleza‚Äù or The Fortress. Tepito Colonia Morelos is best known for its Tepito neighborhood, whose name comes from a Nahuatl phrase Teocultepiton meaning ‚Äúsmall hermitage.‚Äù Over time, this name was shortened and made easier to pronounce for Spanish speakers. This hermitage was located on what is now a small plaza called ‚ÄúTepito‚Äù (officially Fray Bartolom√© de las Casas). Most of the neighborhood is taken up by the large tianguis or open-air market, which covers 25 streets. Tepito‚Äôs economy has been linked to tianguis or traditional open air markets since pre-Hispanic times. Estimates of the area‚Äôs population may vary from 38,000 to 120,000 residents, with an estimated 10,000 more who come in during the day to sell. It is famously known as the ‚ÄúBarrio Bravo‚Äù or fierce neighborhood. Most crimes here are piracy counterfeit goods but it is robbery that gives the area its reputation and can cause problems for sellers by scaring away their customers. Santa Muerte Raising Santa Muerte images during a service for Santa Muerte in Tepito The colonia is home to two major places of worship of Santa Muerte. The first and best known is the first public sanctuary to be dedicated to the image at the home of Enriqueta Romero Romero. She placed her human-sized image, which had been worshiped privately inside prior, outside her house at 12 Alfarer√≠a Street. They eventually led others to do the same. It also attracted visitors. On the first day of every month, Enriqueta leads prayers and the saying of the rosary, which lasts for about an hour. On the first of November the anniversary of the altar to Santa Muerte constructed by Enriqueta Romero is celebrated. The Santa Muerte of Tepito is dressed as a bride and wears hundreds of pieces of gold jewelry given by the faithful to show gratitude for favors received, or to ask for one. The celebration officially begins at the stroke of midnight of November 1. About 5,000 faithful turn out to pray the rosary. For purification, instead of incense, there is the smoke of marijuana. Flowers, pan de muerto, sweets and candy skulls among other things can be seen. Food such as cake, chicken with mole, hot chocolate, coffee and atole are served. Mariachis and marimba bands play. The other is the Santuario Nacional de la Santa Muerte, the headquarters of the Iglesia Cat√≥lica Tradicional M√©xico-Estados Unidos, Misioneros del Sagrado Coraz√≥n y San Felipe de Jes√∫s (\\"Mexican-US Traditional Catholic Church, Missionaries of the Sacred Heart and Saint Philip of Jesus\\"). It is based in a house that has been converted for worship purposes, located on Nicol√°s Bravo Street 35 in Colonia Morelos, close to Metro Candelaria. Worshipers here tend to be people from the neighborhood and include the very young and the very old. The sanctuary here contains a cross, an Archangel Michael and the Virgin of Guadalupe as well as Santa Muerte, on the main altar adorned with flowers. The church claims that it is still a traditional Catholic Church which also includes rituals, workshop and other activities dedicated to Santa Muerte This has caused controversy and disputes with the government over its legal status. At a cost of 38 million pesos (‚Ç¨2m, US$3m), the church will construct the first temple dedicated to Santa Muerte in Mexico City. The building will occupy on two floors with space to seat 500 people, with crypts, an open-air baptismal, offices and an audiovisual room. The altar will contain three images: a gold-covered Christ, a traditional image of Santa Muerte and an angel. The facility is scheduled to begin operations in September 2010, and includes plans to produce music and videos for the faithful to transmit over the Internet or a church TV station.

He was knighted by the Italian government. Career Born in Ferrara, Italy in 1888 to a wealthy family, Vittorio Rietti was the eleventh of the twelve children of Samuele and Lucia Rietti. At the age of 13 he was discovered by the tragedian actor Tommaso Salvini while partaking in a charity performance. Salvini encouraged the boy to make the stage his career and it was under Salvini that he studied acting. Rietti made his stage debut playing in Shakespeare at Bologna. At age 19 he had the distinction of being juvenile lead to Eleonora Duse in her company. But his parents, who wanted him to develop his musical talents, had him resume his studies and Vittorio studied violin at the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. Studying together with him in Brussels was his cousin Vittorio Rieti (later a Broadway composer). He formed his own band the Rietti String Players with considerable success. He served in the Italian Army during the First World War. After World War I, Rietti resumed his stage career. In 1921 he founded Drama Players Theater (Later called Teatro Italiano and still later International Theater) which he ran for 40 years, producing popular Italian plays of the time. He would personally translate and adapt these plays into English and play the lead. He often cast his young son Bobby Rietti (known as Robert Rietti as an adult) in these plays. As a sideline, he taught acting, among his pupils were Ida Lupino, June Duprez and his son Bobby. His other son, Ronald Rietti, later became a film director and producer. Vittorio's first motion picture was released in 1933, for which he was credited as Victor Rietti. He would appear in around 36 motion pictures, including a role as Beppo in Sinfonia Fatale (1946), the first American motion picture to be shot entirely in Italy. He made a cameo appearance in Come Fly with Me (1963) which would be his last film. He also broadcast in some 43 radio plays. Stardom Rietti had a major success in the live television production of To Live in Peace (1951), playing the lead role, the lovable priest Don Geronimo Bonaparte, uncle of Napoleon - a part he previously played on the stage in one of his own productions. He had personally translated the Italian play by Giovacchino Forzano and adapted it for television. The television play won critical acclaim being voted best play of 1951. Rietti himself was given the critics' Oscar for best television actor of 1951 for his performance. Due to popular demand, To Live in Peace was re- staged for television in early 1952 (BBC), 1956 (RAI), and again in 1957 (BBC), and was broadcast for radio as well in 1953 and 1956 with Rietti repeating his performance in all six productions, and his son Robert playing the part of Maso. In addition NBC's prestigious Kraft Theatre televised a special color broadcast of To Live in Peace in 1953 - the first of only two color broadcasts Kraft Theatre did in its eleven-year run. CBC Television televised it in 1957. Rietti's television success with To Live in Peace led to his touring internationally with the play for Ralph Reader. Samuel French bought the book rights to the play, and published it in 1952. Producer Sydney Box planned a motion picture of the play starring Rietti which never evolved. Eleven additional radio productions of the play were broadcast around the world. Rietti's overnight success led to his surprise appearance on the televised gala special Life Begins at Sixty and established him as a lead actor in television. His success in television continued, his most memorable performances being the title role in The Wanderer (1952) and Professor Toti in Against The Stream (1959), both lead roles of Italian plays he had translated and adapted for television. For American television he guest starred with his son Robert Rietty in The Jack Benny Program (1957) in which he played two roles, and Harry's Girls (1963), both directed by his friend Ralph Levy. Later life On 23 July 1959, Victor Rietti and his son Robert were knighted with the title of Cavaliere by the Italian Government for their contribution to Italian culture, in particular for translating and adapting a great many Italian plays into English. When Rietti was only 35 years old he was given six months to live by his doctors due to a heart condition. On 3 December 1963, some 40 years later, he suffered a fatal heart attack. His life story was dramatized in the BBC radio play Papa Rietti.

It was the sixteenth tropical cyclone and the fourteenth named storm of the season, as well as the last of a record eight tropical storms to form in September. Originating from a broad monsoonal low, Nicole became a tropical depression over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September 28. It maintained an unusual structure as it tracked northeastward, with a poorly defined wind circulation and few thunderstorms near its center. Nicole approached the coast of Cuba as a weak tropical storm, losing its status as a tropical cyclone over the territory on September 29. The remnants emerged over the Bahamas and eventually became absorbed by a separate extratropical system. Due to Nicole's atypical structure, the strongest thundershowers were well removed from the center; most of the weather activity occurred over the north-central Caribbean. In Jamaica, the storm triggered widespread power outages across more than 288,000 residences. Extreme precipitation of up to caused disastrous flooding in several parishes, severely damaging or destroying 528 houses. The devastation extended to the island's farmland and environment, which suffered from expansive water pollution. In all, Nicole wrought an estimated $245.4 million (2010 USD) in damage throughout Jamaica, and there were sixteen fatalities. Elsewhere, minor flooding occurred in Cuba, Florida, and the Cayman Islands. The remnants of the storm contributed to a large disturbance along the East Coast of the United States, causing additional damage and deaths.  Meteorological history  In late September 2010, a wide band of disturbed weather and low pressure, associated with the monsoon trough and remnant tropical moisture from Tropical Storm Matthew, meandered over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. With a broad upper ridge anchored along the Yucat√°n coast, diffluence aloft in the vicinity of the disturbance provided focus for the development of scattered convection. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted an environment supportive of tropical development, and by September 27, a broad surface low formed amid the convection. The next day, surface pressures steadily dropped as sustained winds around the low proximated tropical storm force. Throughout the development process, moderate westerly wind shear over the region caused the disturbance to exhibit a rather asymmetric structure; it developed an elongated low-pressure center by September 28, well to the northwest of its strongest wind field. Despite the asymmetry, the NHC initiated advisories on a tropical depression around 15:00 UTC that day, after surface and satellite observations revealed a sufficiently defined circulation center west of the deep convection. Post-season reassessments, however, indicated that a tropical storm had, in fact, formed three hours earlier, about 75 miles (120 km) south of Cuba's Isle of Youth, which operationally was not named Nicole until a day later. The center of Nicole near Cuba, with the greatest rain volumes to the southeast over Jamaica as depicted on water vapor imagery For most of its duration, Nicole maintained a generally northeastward motion, caught in the steering flow between a large mid- to upper-level trough and an anticyclone to the west. Within hours of the storm's formation, observations from a hurricane hunters flight confirmed a composition similar to the one initially discerned, with the strongest gusts and thunderstorms dislocated 250 mi (400 km) east from the ill-defined center. In comparison, the core consisted of light winds and sporadic convection‚Äîa structure rather characteristic of a North Indian Ocean monsoon depression. The system's ambiguous nature led to disagreement among weather specialists over its classification: while the NHC maintained its tropical cyclone status, Cuban meteorologist Jos√© Rubiera stated that \\"no tropical storm exists over [Cuba], or near it,\\" noting a lack of significant winds in the country's vicinity. Over the course of September 29, radar data showed the convection increasing over the northern half of the storm; bands of intense thunderstorms in the southeastern periphery also formed closer to the center, and weather buoys and ships in that region observed sustained tropical-storm-force winds. Around 12:00 UTC, Nicole attained an estimated peak intensity of winds and a minimum pressure of , just south of Cuba. Despite the increase in strength, Nicole's circulation soon became exceedingly elongated and untrackable over central Cuba, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone by 15:00 UTC. The remnant low began interacting with the neighboring trough that had steered Nicole in its tropical stages, resulting in significant precipitation along the southeastern coastlines of the United States. Accelerating toward the northeast, the system acquired frontal characteristics and became extratropical over the Bahamas by 0600 UTC, September 30, twelve hours before merging with a developing system over eastern North Carolina. Lingering low pressure and broad cyclonic flow over the north-central Caribbean in Nicole's wake contributed to the development of Hurricane Paula in the first weeks of October. Preparations =Caribbean= In anticipation of a tropical storm, warnings were issued for the Cayman Islands, the northwestern and central Bahamas, and the Cuban provinces of Matanzas, Cienfuegos, Villa Clara, Sancti Sp√≠ritus, and Ciego de √Åvila on September 28. However, the warnings were discontinued the following day after reports of the storm's prompt dissipation. After forecasters warned of severe weather across the Cayman Islands, schools and government offices closed in low-lying areas, and emergency teams cleaned out storm drains and readied shelters. Thunderstorms in Grand Cayman forced Cayman Airways to cancel all express flights to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman on October 29; weather-resistant jet service was provided to stranded passengers. A marine warning was required for all three islands due to rough sea conditions. In Jamaica, a flash flood warning remained in effect for flood-prone regions for four days, ultimately discontinued on October 3. Schools and several businesses, including the US Embassy in Kingston, closed on September 29‚Äì30 as the island braced for heavy rains. Public transit was suspended islandwide on the evening of September 29, and shipping interests were cautioned to secure their vessels. At the height of the storm, army and police officials patrolled the island in case of emergencies. =United States= The remnants of Nicole approaching South Carolina on September 30 Tropical storm warnings were issued for the Florida Keys, the Florida Bay, and from the Jupiter Inlet coast southward to Cape Sable on September 28. A tropical storm watch was in place for the mainland north from the Jupiter Inlet to the Sebastian Inlet and north of East Cape Sable to Chokoloskee. The warnings and watch were discontinued the next day, after a direct impact was no longer expected. At the time, a flood watch remained in effect for Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, Collier, and Monroe counties into September 30. An airport weather warning was issued for Orlando International Airport and Executive Airport on September 28; arriving flights were put on hold, and pilots rerouted to other airports if possible. Eight Southwest Airlines flights were diverted to the airports of Tampa and Jacksonville, and one JetBlue flight to West Palm Beach. Though airport officials later reported normal conditions, an additional 26 flights were canceled at Miami International Airport the next day. In Brunswick and New Hanover counties, North Carolina, officials readied shelters on September 29 to accommodate stranded residents unable to access their homes. Multiple schools in New Hanover and Pender County remained closed the next morning due to worsening storm conditions from the disturbance succeeding Nicole. At the threat of prolonged rainfall, a flood watch was issued for Kent County, Maryland, from September 30 to October 1. Also in the area, the National Weather Service declared both a coastal flood advisory and wind advisory for September 30. Impact =Jamaica= Nicole over Jamaica, Cuba and the Bahamas on September 29 Nicole and its precursor disturbance brought great rainfall to much of Jamaica over a period of several days. A maximum of was recorded in Belleisle, Westmoreland Parish, from September 26 to 30; most other parishes received more than during the same period. With a return period of 30 years, these quantities tripled the monthly rainfall average for September at several locations. Though the broad-scale wind regime over the island remained gentle, the storm's intense convective bands produced three microbursts‚Äîsmall downdrafts of intense winds. With dozens of river banks and waterways blocked, the worst effects were due to landslides and particularly severe flooding across numerous communities primarily in southern parishes. Saint Andrew Parish, killing the three construction workers inside The disaster affected 507,831 people on the island; it resulted in 16 deaths‚Äî14 of which confirmed‚Äîand 42 injuries. In Saint Andrew Parish's Sandy Park, a house next to a street gully succumbed to the effects of the storm; five bodies were recovered near the site, while the final missing inhabitant was presumed dead. Elsewhere in Saint Andrew, three construction workers were killed when the shed in which they were sleeping caved in. A girl was crushed to death under the weight of a collapsed board house in Saint Catherine Parish. Rushing waters swept away three people in different parts of the island, all of whom drowned. Amid a microburst, a waterspout tore roofs off buildings and hospitalized five residents in Westmoreland Parish's capital of Savanna-la- Mar, while to the northwest, strong gusts and rough surf impacted the resort town of Negril. In the wake of the storm, a body was recovered from debris along a road in Saint Catherine. Flooded streets, roads and bridges isolated communities across seven of the island's parishes and trapped hundreds of residents in their homes. Jamaica's infrastructure was devastated in the deluge, accounting for most of Nicole's damage to the island. More than 288,000 residences were without power at the height of the storm due to downed electricity lines and poles. About 40 percent of the island's water supply had been disrupted at some point. Dozens of bridges experienced total collapse under the force of swollen rivers and creeks. In Kingston, many underpasses became totally inundated as the prolonged rain overwhelmed storm drains; the flooding that followed left many of the city's roads impassable. Destruction to the infrastructure was especially extensive in Westmoreland, Saint Elizabeth, and Hanover parishes, though overall, 543 of the island's principle roads sustained at least some degree of damage. The total costs linked to the infrastructure neared J$20 billion (US$235.4 million). Nicole also wreaked widespread property damage: of the 2,169 homes affected, 474 sustained severe damage while 54 were beyond repair. The losses totaled J$274.3 million (US$3.2 million), J$75.6 million (US$890,000) hereof to replace destroyed housing units. With much of the island's crops and livestock washed away, including 40 percent of the season's banana produce, the agricultural sector suffered J$576.5 million (US$6.8 million) in losses. The storm had a discernible impact on the environment, which plays a crucial role in Jamaica's economy and tourism sectors. Surface runoff and spills along industrial zones and sewage systems infiltrated large stretches of land, leading to soil contamination, coastal erosion, and deteriorated ecosystems. In addition, there were traces of light damage to vegetation, such as uprooted trees. =Elsewhere= While Nicole was intensifying offshore, its outer bands produced heavy downpours over drought-stricken Cuba. Rain quantities were particularly high along the southeastern coast; a 48-hour total of fell at Cape Cruz, in the mountainous Granma Province. The region also briefly observed gale-force winds, with gusts to at Guant√°namo Bay. Throughout eastern Cuba, nearly 300 people sought refuge from the storm. As the rivers in Granma overflowed, eight houses collapsed and more than 300 others were inundated in the coastal town of Pil√≥n. The flooding obstructed several roads, with sections of the highway between Granma and Santiago de Cuba destroyed. The storm resulted in 5,000 lbs (2.5 tons) of lost crops and livestock. These effects were nevertheless considered to be minor when viewed against the rainfall's alleviation of a persistent dry spell. Rainfall from Tropical Storm Nicole in Florida In the Cayman Islands, gusts to stirred up rough seas with waves, which caused some light erosion along southern and western shores. Rainfall over the region was heavy and widespread, although the greatest quantities fell over Grand Cayman; the Owen Roberts International Airport recorded over a two-day period. Overall damage to the islands was limited: The blustery rains flooded low-lying areas, caused roof leaks, and knocked out the power in eastern Grand Cayman. Despite the initial threat of strong thunderstorms and gusts, Florida was spared a direct hit from Nicole. The storm skirted the state with only showers; of rain were recorded at North Key Largo, though the mainland received much smaller quantities. The storm flooded streets in Miami Beach and the northern Florida Keys, as well as one home. Similarly, inclement weather spread over the northwestern Bahamas without significant consequences. =Post-tropical system= The extratropical remnants of Nicole retained plenty of moisture and ultimately combined with a large low-pressure system slowly tracking up the U.S. East Coast. The resultant disturbance produced torrential thunderstorms over entire coastlines and inland as far north as Canada, causing widespread power outages and shattering numerous precipitation records throughout the region. The most extreme weather was concentrated over Eastern North Carolina; during the week of September 24‚ÄìOctober 1, most communities there recorded rainfall totals of at least . Wilmington measured of rain, the most it had received over a five-day period since 1871, while Kinston recorded during that time. Widespread flooding, exacerbated by overflowing creeks and rivers, engulfed blocks of homes. About 150 roads were closed off due to the hazardous conditions; seven people were nonetheless killed in traffic accidents across the state. Flooding from the post-tropical system in Vanceboro, North Carolina In the Mid-Atlantic, the weather event broke the 24-hour rainfall record for September 30 at several locations: the Norfolk, Baltimore‚ÄìWashington, and Ronald Reagan Washington airports recorded , , and , respectively. In Maryland, two buses collided amid the stormy weather, injuring 26 of their passengers. With localized estimates of up to , the state of New York experienced some of its most historic rainfall; an official total shattered the 24-hour record for any calendar day in Binghamtom. Flash floods throughout the state resulted in one drowning death and US$10,000 in damage. Considerable flooding also occurred in Vermont and Pennsylvania, with a 24-hour rainfall maximum of in Moscow. Farther north, the remnant low enhanced a pressure gradient over southern New England, generating strong winds that knocked out the power in Litchfield County. Rainfall there additionally caused minor flooding. In Quebec, torrents following of rainfall inundated basements and caused two drownings. Despite the deaths and damage, the rains lightened prolonged drought conditions in those regions. Aftermath On October 5, a national disaster was declared for Jamaica due to the effects of Nicole. In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4 million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12 million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2 million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50 million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and plantain farmers. Road damage in Nicole's wake was widespread across Jamaica. Eleven days after the storm, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies allocated CHF150,644 (US$156,221) to sustain the Jamaica Red Cross in distributing aid to about 500 families‚Äîor 2,500 beneficiaries‚Äîin need of life supplies. In late December 2010, the Jamaica‚ÄìCanadian Association in Toronto, Ontario, raised a total of CDN$10,153.87 (US$10,221.33) in relief funds for flood victims. The Hanover Parish Council requested J$30 million (US$351,000) to assist the Saint James Parish Council and other municipal authorities across the country in post-storm clean-up and beautification work. A grant of J$279 million (US$3.26 million) was approved for the reconstruction of a major roadway section in Westmoreland Parish. In spite of the timely relief efforts, Nicole's effects were still felt for months in its wake. The gross domestic product for Jamaica, which had been suffering from a substantially slow economic growth rate, further declined following the extensive damage. The agriculture sector sustained slight losses from reduced egg production due to the storm's traumatizing effects on farm chickens. In the face of the high repair costs, the island saw below-standard levels of holiday season consumption for 2010.

Baltimore's City Department of Recreation and Parks operates Gwynns Falls and Leakin as a single park, beginning at the western edge of the city, following the Gwynns Falls stream from Windsor Mill Road (northwest) to Wilkens Avenue (southeast).\\"History of the Park\\" Friends of Gwynns Falls Leakin Park. Retrieved 2010-09-28. Franklintown Road serves as the main vehicular route through the park, as a continuation of Dogwood Road from the Baltimore County suburb of Woodlawn. It exits the park near West Lafayette Avenue further into the city. Although surrounded by an urban environment, some areas of the park are so heavily wooded that they give the impression of wilderness. Portions of the 1999 horror film The Blair Witch Project were filmed here. The combination of its many secluded areas and easy vehicular access gave it a reputation, in Baltimore and beyond, as a place of crime in the past. In the early 2010s the park began efforts to improve its public image by barricading many dead-end access roads and publicizing family- friendly events. History =Gwynns Falls Park= The properties which eventually became Gwynns Falls Park started with a small parcel of land southwest of Edmondson Avenue, selected by the Baltimore City government in 1901 to serve as a park, anticipating the needs of a growing population. In their plan for the \\"Greater Baltimore Public Grounds,\\" prepared for the Baltimore Municipal Arts Society in 1904, the Olmsted Brothers recommended acquiring land along the Gwynns Falls for a stream valley park.\\"Trail Info\\" Gwynns Falls Trail Council. Retrieved 2010-09-29. Gwynns Falls Park was established by the City of Baltimore in 1908 with the addition of other properties to the land purchased in 1901. In the 1960s, federal, state and city transportation planners proposed routing Interstate 70 through the Gwynns Falls Valley and the Park. The eastbound interstate was to continue from its current eastern terminus at the Security Boulevard/Cooks Lane interchange and run towards an intersection with Interstate 95, which runs from the northeast to southwest through the city; a spur route, Interstate 170, was to begin there, and serve downtown via the neighborhoods immediately west of it. This extension was canceled officially in the early 1980s due to heavy sustained local opposition, and the I-70 designation itself was truncated to the Baltimore Beltway in 2014. =Leakin Park= A bequest from J. Wilson Leakin in 1922 provided funding for a 300-acre addition to the park, purchased as two parcels in 1941 and 1948 from the descendants of Thomas de Kay Winans (1820‚Äì1878). A stipulation of the bequest required the city to name this portion of the park for Leakin's grandfather, Shepard A. Leakin, a former mayor. The property purchased from the Winans family was previously known as the Crimea. Thomas Winans named his Baltimore property after the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine.Evan Balkan (2006). 60 Hikes within 60 Miles. \\"Leakin Park\\", pp 60-64. Menasha Ridge Press. . In 1856, Winans built a villa on the property, which he called the Orianda House. His villa continues to stand in Leakin Park, at 1901 Eagle Drive.The Orianda House.

Pipeline plans Plans to build a two- mile-long gas pipeline through a heavily wooded section of the park were questioned by the Friends of Gwynns Falls/Leakin Park organization in September 2013. The pipeline will replace an aging pipeline originally installed in 1949 along Dead Run, a tributary of Gwynns Falls. Initially, Baltimore Gas & Electric Company planned a replacement line running mostly along the park's southern border. An alternative suggestion would move more of the line to the southern border at the neighborhood of West Hills. Either route will require extensive clearing of trees that are more than 100 years old, because the new pipeline requires a 40-foot wide access corridor to be kept clear of trees. Running the pipeline along the existing route would involve a serious environmental impact, due to its proximity to Dead Run. This alternative also involves extensive clearing, because the new pipe must be located at least 75 feet from the old line to satisfy safety requirements. The access corridor along the old pipeline is only 26 feet wide.

It was nicknamed \\"the city's largest unregistered graveyard.\\" A webpage was created to track victims found in the park. This aspect of the park has been referenced in works of popular culture set in Baltimore. In an episode of The Wire, a police detective recalls checking the park for a body earlier in his career and being told only to care about ones that fit the victim's description. \\"We're looking for one body in particular‚Äîif you go grabbing every one you see, we'll be here all day,\\" he recounts being told. In its first season, the podcast Serial investigated the death of Hae Min Lee, found in the park in 1999. One of the bodies to be found in the park is that of Eugene Leroy Anderson, a local 20-year-old whose skeletal remains were found off Stokes Drive in October 1969. It was believed that his fellow Black Panthers had tortured and killed him that spring after discovering he was an FBI informant. However, when four other Panthers were prosecuted for the crime in 1971, witnesses who had been informants themselves gave inconsistent accounts of how the crime took place. Only one defendant was convicted, later pardoned by Governor Marvin Mandel. The crime remains officially unsolved. Several factors made Leakin attractive to criminals disposing of bodies. It borders on Edmondson and Walbrook, two high-crime neighborhoods of the city. Franklintown and Windsor Mills roads, which cross the park, are \\"easy thoroughfares to get in and out of a secluded area after illegal acts\\" in the words of Rona Kobell, a former Sun reporter writing in Slate. And many short dead-end roads entered the park from the surrounding neighborhoods. A park planner, Molly Gallant, led successful efforts to change the park's reputation after a community based 2011 campout in the park. She, along with volunteers, began closing off the access roads to discourage illicit behavior. A bike trail around the park's perimeter has also made a significant, positive impact and now welcomes cyclists and hikers from around the city.

He was born in Manchester, England, in 1502, the son of a carpenter. Described as a pious child, \\"geven to solitarynes abstinence & prayer\\", Hall became a successful draper and the junior constable of Manchester in 1557. While working on his accounts one evening in 1551, Hall heard a voice telling him that \\"the daye draweth nere\\", and saw a vision of the Five Wounds of Christ. He dismissed it as a dream until an angel appeared to him the following year when he was seriously ill in bed. The angel told Hall that he was \\"elect and chosen of God to declare and pronounce unto his people his worde\\", whereupon Hall found himself lifted from his sickbed and taken on a two-day visit to Heaven and Hell. In about 1557‚Äì8 Hall began work on his The Visions of Elizeus Hall in Metre, a collection of all his visions that he wrote while on his knees, along with a shorter work he referred to as \\"his booke of obedience\\"; there are no extant copies of either book. Hall travelled from Manchester to London in 1562, where he proclaimed himself \\"a mesenger sente from godde to the Quene & to all princes\\". He was interrogated and examined several times during his stay in London, and was denounced in a sermon given by James Pilkington, the Bishop of Durham. After delivering a warning and admonition from God to Edmund Grindel, the Bishop of London, Hall was examined by Grindel on 12 June 1562. For harbouring \\"popishe Judgement in religion\\", failing to receive communion, and for holding Catholic views on purgatory and transubstantiation, Hall was pilloried in Cheapside on 26 June and subsequently incarcerated in Bridewell Prison, where he died in 1565.

Early life Born in Alampur village in Mahabubnagar District of Telangana, Tella Lakshmi Kantamma hailed from a large family of Kamma landlords. Her father was T. Venkat Reddy, and her mother was Mangamma. Lakshmi Kantamma was the youngest child. She studied up to 5th class in Kurnool, and then her sister helped her in completing SSLC in Gudivada. She entered Madras Christian College to pursue intermediate studies, and completed B.A. in Machilipatnam. She later received a masters in economics in 1971. Like P.V Narasimha Rao, she was initially drawn to socialist ideas, and she was a writer and Sanskrit scholar. She married Tella Venkata Subba Rao on 1 November 1944. He was then District Forest Officer in Anantapur; she was elected as secretary of Ladies Club. After that she completed her MA in Pachiappa College in Madras, when her husband went to England to undergo training as Assistant Conservator of Forests. On 5 June 1960 Lakshmi Kantamma and Subba Rao had a daughter ‚Äì Jogulamba who was their only child. Singer Smita is her grand daughter. Political career Her three decades of political life began with a claim for a position on the MLA ticket in 1957. She was denied the seat on the grounds that she was the wife of a Government official, but took this issue to the notice of Lal Bahadur Shastri and questioned whether they were looking at her as citizen of India or wife of an officer. Shastry placed her on the ticket for a seat in Khammam which was a stronghold of Communists; Congress had never won an election in that seat in the past. Lakshmi Kantamma won the election. She became a Member of Parliament in 1962. She served as Executive Member of Parliament Committee when Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister. She was elected to Parliament continuously from 1962 to 1977. During the China War in 1962, she not only learnt rifle shooting but also won 2nd prize. She was a member of Indian delegation from Parliament to visit Australia. In those days women were not allowed to become IAS officers. Lakshmi Kantamma took the initiative and convinced Mrs. Indira Gandhi and got the barrier lifted. She raised the issue of enacting a law for 50% property right for women several times in Parliament. As member of the state election committee in 1972, she was instrumental in allotting tickets to 70 women and youth. Chekuri Kasaiah who faced defeat at her hands, recalls even now that there used to be huge crowds during her electioneering at Khammam in 1957. Khammam is a seat where Congress had lost its deposit in the previous election but Lakshmi Kantamma won the seat hands down. She was in the forefront of leaders who fought to secure Police Academy, BHEL, Visakhapatnam Steel Plant and Kothagudem Thermal Power Project. Her role in the election of V. V. Giri as President of India was mentioned by V. V. Giri in his autobiography. Though she was very close to Indira Gandhi, she opposed her when she imposed emergency. She declined various ministerial berths offered by Indira Gandhi as she felt people are of utmost importance than positions. She influenced the politics of those days as a co-worker with Vajpayee, Chandra Shekar, Morarji Desai, P. V. Narasimha Rao and Charan Singh. She was an important leader in Janata party and served as All India General Secretary of the party. She got elected as an MLA from Himayat Nagar constituency in Hyderabad. She declined the opportunity to become the Chief Minister of the State, and was instrumental for making P. V. Narasimha Rao as Chief Minister of A.P.

Perhaps she is the only woman who led a versatile, unique and multi-faceted personality after Durga Bhai Deshmukh who led a conscientious political and social life. Starting from the communist student's movements to rubbing shoulders with Indira Gandhi, she played different roles very efficiently. She was committed to the principles she believed in, could speak out boldly what she believed in and never bowed her head and displayed self-confidence all through.

Like the 1813 Class which preceded them, there were 40 1661s, turned out of Swindon Works in two batches. Construction * Nos. 1661-1680 (Lot 69, 1886) * Nos. 1681-1700 (Lot 70, 1886-7) Design Unlike the 1813s, the 1661s had larger wheels (), double frames with a longer wheelbase (), and saddle, not side tanks. Their frames had originally been ordered for the tender engines of the 2361 Class; however, more 2361s turned out not to be needed, after tank engines (of Joseph Armstrong's 1076 Class) had been found to be successful hauling the heavy coal trains from Aberdare. Like the 2361s, the 1661s carried long boilers ( barrel) when new, but shorter boilers were fitted on overhaul. As usual with GWR saddle tanks, pannier tanks were later fitted to most of them, between 1910 and 1926. Accident In 1904, locomotive No. 1674 was one of two locomotives hauling an express passenger train that was derailed at Loughor, Glamorgan due to excessive speed. Surging of water in the saddle tanks of No. 1674 was considered a contributory factor. Five people were killed and eighteen were injured. Following the accident, eight of the class were sold to South Wales railways in 1906, duly returning into GWR stock at the Grouping in 1922. In 1907 a second locomotive was involved in an accident. Alexandra (Newport and South Wales) Docks and Railway No.28 (ex GWR 1683) was derailed by catch points at Bassaleg Junction, Monmouthshire, rolled down the embankment and landed in the local cricket field. The locomotive was repaired and spent 15 years on the A(N&SW;)D&R.; http://www.penrhos.me.uk/adrlocos.shtml Withdrawal The last in service was No. 1685, which ran until 1934.

It was one of the most important battles of the Luxembourg Resistance during World War II.  Prelude  While the Grand- Duchy of Luxembourg had been liberated by U.S. Army forces in September 1944, the German troops pulled back to Germany and took up new defensive positions along the border rivers Moselle, Sauer and Our. As soon as the country was liberated, Luxembourgish resistance members formed a militia across the country and were equipped with arms and ammunition by the United States Army. Most of the Luxembourgish militia took up positions at the German border and occupied the important observation posts along the Rivers Our and Sauer. One of the most important posts was Vianden Castle from which the Luxembourgers could look deep into German territory and report German troop movements to the Allied Forces. = First action = On the 15th of November, Luxembourgish militia members spotted a German patrol between Wiesen and Bettel and decided to strike. Five of the eleven German soldiers in the patrol were killed by the Luxembourgers who suffered no casualties. After this incident the German command decided to recapture the castle of Vianden. The leader of the resistance, Victor Abens, evacuated the civilians of Vianden but nevertheless decided that his 30 militia men should remain in the town and in the castle to defend it. In the following days, the U.S. Army supported the Luxembourgers in Vianden with weapons and ammunition before leaving the town.  Battle  On Sunday morning, 19 November, the Germans attacked the town with 250 soldiers of the Waffen-SS. After bombarding the town and the castle with grenade launchers the German soldiers began to attack the castle itself which was defended and fortified by four members of the Luxembourgish militia. After heavy fighting around the castle, six German soldiers breached the defences via the gate of the castle, only to be involved in house-to-house fighting inside the castle. After sustaining several casualties, the Germans withdrew from the castle and concentrated their force on the town, but the strong resistance offered by the militia forced the Germans to abandon their assault and withdraw to the other side of the river to Germany.  Aftermath  Eighteen German soldiers were killed during the main battle. The 30 men of the Luxembourgish militia suffered only one dead, with three being seriously wounded, and three more slightly wounded. A single civilian was killed when a grenade exploded in her home. When the Germans launched the Battle of the Bulge a month later, the 30 men of the Luxembourgish militia, being hopelessly outnumbered, abandoned Vianden and withdrew to the unoccupied south of the country. Most of them continued their engagement by helping the U.S. Forces during the battle.

This standard is applicable to all structures, regardless of their size and business sector. The list of requirements which works as a guideline is used as a basis for an entity's compliance certification, this falls under the framework of specific financial audits. The MSI 20000 scope statement's specification provides the requirements in terms of the financial quality of firms, depending on their sector of activity. The statement's specifications focus on two main aspects: financial strength and financial performance. The MSI 20000 certification provides information on the best administrative and financial management practices and serves as an indicator of good financial governance. The statement serves as a benchmark for various economic and financial actors and operators.  Versions  * 2007: Creation of the MSI system; MSI stands for Market Standard Indicator. * 2008: Creation of the MSI reference system associated with the 20000 index, it is officially named MSI 20000. * 2009: The scope statement classifies the MSI 20000 as part of the standard family. * 2016: The internationalization of the MSI system leads to redefining the operating framework of the MSI system and its dedicated certification Origin.  Origin  The MSI 20000 certification was initially developed, after the subprime crisis in 2008, to identify the healthiest listed companies on stock exchange markets and to minimize the deterioration impact of their stock market crash, during stock market crashes. The desired outcome is to face recurrent market reluctance at major anticipated and announced events (crises, repurchasing, etc.).  Concept  MSI 20000 is a collaborative project, based on simple operating rules, combining financial and technological skills. The project was conceived by international financial experts, within the MSI Organization, a non-profit NGO based in Switzerland which manages the updating of the statement of standards and its scope of application. The main goal is to provide the market with a reliable, relevant, performing and continuously updated tool.  Functioning  To obtain the certification, an audit is carried out in accordance with the scope statement's procedures and specifications. The audits conducted by a certified body accredited by the MSI Organization must be subject to an ongoing monitoring system, in lines with the ISO 17021 standard. The MSI 20000 scope statement includes a set of ratios, financial instruments and econometric models, related to the sector under study. The set is classified in themes and sub-themes, according to the fundamental principles of solidity and financial performance, ensuring companies: solvency, profitability and sustainability over time. The diagnoses are established according to the strength and performance of these respective themes: management of assets liquidity, liabilities, risks, human resources, operating cycles, etc... commercial, economic and financial profitability, overall net, operational, value creation, etc. The MSI 20000 approach is based on a strictly supervised scientific and mathematical approach, combining quantitative, qualitative universal and objective indicators. According to the MSI monitoring center, financial quality assessment is based on the intrinsic values of the audited facilities, which takes place after the approval of financial statements by legal auditors. For the sake of reliability and rigor, the analysis tools and the evaluation criteria used are adapted according to the sector of activity, via FinTech tools. In accordance with certification's regulations, the MSI 20000 certification is valid for three years and can only be issued by an accredited or certified organization.

History In his will of 28 February 1681/2, Thomas Parmiter bequeathed funds for \\"six almshouses in some convenient place upon the waste of Bethnal Green and further for the building of one free school houses or room, wherein ten poor children of the hamlet of Bethnal Green may be taught to read or write\\".The Tower Hamlets Connection (p124) by Harold Finch - Published 1996 Thomas Parmiter died in 1688. The first Parmiter's Almshouses were opened in John Street, now Grimsby Street, off Brick Lane in 1722, and were adjacent to the first school. Along with the school, the Almshouses moved to Gloucester Street, now Parmiter Street, Bethnal Green in 1839, where they remained in use until they were destroyed by a V2 rocket in February 1945. Parmiter's School moved to new premises in Approach Road, Bethnal Green in 1887, and in 1977 the school relocated to Garston, Hertfordshire.A history of the Parmiter's Estate Charity by Andrew Lewis & Brian Coulshed - Published 1999 Despite the school moving from Bethnal Green, links remain with the Almshouse & Pension Charity, as the out-pensioners of the Charity visit the school twice a year for a meal, and entertainment provided by the students. Administration The Parmiter's Almshouse & Pension Charity is a Registered Charity (215087) and a Limited Company registered with Companies House Cardiff, as Company Number, 4862231 with a registered office at 6 Trull Farm Buildings. Tetbury, Gloucestershire GL8 8SQ. The Charity's governing document is the scheme of the charity commissioners dated 28 January 2008. In 2003, the trust became a limited company in order that the trustees personal liability is limited, given that the trust undertook the development of new almshouses. The trustees of Parmiter's Almshouse & Pension Charity are responsible for managing the affairs of the charity. The board has a membership of nine trustees. Issues that the trustees discuss, organise and responsible for are: ‚Ä¢ Constitution ‚Ä¢ Finance ‚Ä¢ Private finance ‚Ä¢ Almshouse Provision ‚Ä¢ Almshouse Management Arrangements ‚Ä¢ Pensioner appointment & payments ‚Ä¢ Trips to Parmiter's School at Garston in Hertfordshire ‚Ä¢ Dinners ‚Ä¢ Trips to Seaside The administration of the Charity is undertaken on behalf of the Trustees by The Trust Partnership. The Current Almshouses Due to difficulty in securing land in Bethnal Green to build replacement Almshouses, the Trustees of the Charity made a decision in 2008 to look for a site outside of Bethnal Green and as a result a site was found in 2009 in Great Clacton, Essex. On 27 September 2010 the Charity finally took possession of its first Almshouses for 65 years ‚Äî six two bedroom bungalows, thereby complying with the original terms of Thomas Parmiter's will. The Almshouses have been let to residents who reside within the area of the former Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. On 5 October 2010, the Reverend Group Captain Donald Wallace, the Chaplain to Parmiter's School performed the dedication ceremony and unveiled the commemorative plaque, to officially open the new almshouses. The Out-Pensioners The Trustees appoint up to 150 pensioners who must have resided in the area of the former Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green for at least two years. Appointments are made periodically, following adverts being placed in a local newspaper and at a number of other locations in Bethnal Green, which must include St Matthew's Church, Bethnal Green. The Trustees do not hold a waiting list for Pensioners. Pensioners receive a half-yearly pension of ¬£75. The Trustees hold two celebrations normally in March and October at a local venue for pensioners. This normally includes a four course meal with drink and a free raffle. Following on from the meal, entertainment is provided in the form of a singer and usually everyone then gets up dancing! In order to underline the importance of maintaining links with Bethnal Green; Parmiter's School invite Pensioners to visit the school every July and December to have a three course lunch and be entertained by the pupils. This is a popular afternoon out for Pensioners, who catch the coach in Cambridge Heath Road. In June every year, the Trustees organise a day trip to Eastbourne on the Sussex Coast. Pensioners who come on the trip are given ¬£15 each to pay for their lunch. The coaches leave from Cambridge Heath Road at 9am sharp and leave Eastbourne at around 5pm to return to Bethnal Green by about 7.30pm. On the outgoing trip in the morning, the coaches usually stop at The Pantiles in Tunbridge Wells for an hour break. For those Pensioners who are no longer able to get out and about, and join us at the five events we hold annually, the Trustees have arranged for a Christmas Hamper to be delivered.

After a huge fight between Renee and Gaby, they apologize to each other and Renee decides to follow through with the divorce. Bree is exhausted after many all-nighters of sex with Keith's unrestricted libido. Later, he confesses that he was only trying to impress her (because Bree seemed too conservative and sophisticated for him) after Bree reveals she can't keep up with him. They tell each other that they like each other the way they are. Tom asks his mother, Allison, as a nanny to take care of the baby. After a big argument, Lynette fires her mother-in-law, but Tom overrules her, telling her that she is going to stay. After Lynette and Allison's talk, Tom's mother shows symptoms of dementia to Penny, unknown to Lynette and Tom.

He was recognized as one of the best of his era, representing the best in English cabinetmaking. Examples of his furniture can be found in the Victorian and Albert Museum, The California Palace of the Legion of Honor and the Library at Saltram, Devon. The origins of the McLean firm is somewhat confused by the many variations in spelling the name 'McLean'. \\"John MacKlane, upholder and cabinet maker in Little Newport Street, off Leicester Square\\" is listed in 1774.The London furniture makers: from the Restoration to the Victorian Era, 1660-1840 As many as eight different variations of name spellings have been recorded, the problem arising because many people in those days were illiterate and names were written phonetically at the whim of whoever was writing the name at the time. History The first appearance of the name 'McLean' can be found on the south side of Little Newport Street, Leicester Square in June 1770, where a \\"Jn. McLean\\" rented a \\"Ho & workshops\\" until 1783. A trade card for the Newport Street Address advertises that he was a \\"Cabinet, Chair Maker and Upholder\\". The rent of the Little Newport premises was valued at ¬£36; because this rent was considerable and the premises were new, this indicates that McLean was already established in business before 1770.Simon Redburn, John McLean and Son, Furniture History No records have yet been found establishing McLean's whereabouts between 1783 and 1790. From 1790 until the firm's demise in 1825, they are recorded at 55/58 Upper Marylebone Street (now New Cavendish Street) and from c. 1799-1805, later expanding to occupy premises in both Pancras Street and Upper Terrace and continuing in business until 1825. McLean and Son also gained a notable mention in Thomas Sheraton's Cabinet Dictionary in 1803. One of the \\"fashionable Pieces of Cabinet Furniture\\" included a \\"Pouch Table\\", whose design was taken and \\"executed by Mr. M'Lean in Mary-le-bone street, near Tottenham court road, who finishes these small articles in the neatest manner\\". That John McLean and Son were cabinet-makers of the highest calibre is confirmed by being patronised by such leading connoisseurs as the 5th Earl of Jersey, for whom they worked extensively at Middleton Park, Oxfordshire, and the Earl's London mansion in Berkeley Square. The firm of John McLean and Son advertised that it specialised in \\"Elegant Parisian Furniture\\" and although the six surviving pieces that bear his trade label are undoubtedly English, they do owe much to Gallic influence not only in their design. Trade directories from 1809 give \\"John McLean & Son, upholders\\" as from 58 Upper Marylebone Street with his son William McLean at the same address. The business was in serious decline from 1825 as the Marylebone Rate Books reveal rate arrears and bankruptcy. A final journal entry in the same year states, \\"Died so poor that his body was sent in a box by wagon into the country to relations\\". The causes for the decline are not clear, although it was common that the notoriously slow payments by clients for completed work caused financial embarrassment to many tradesmen in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The class used similar inside frames and chassis dimensions to the 1813 Class of 1882-4. In this they differed from the intervening 1661 Class, which had reverted to the double frames of the Armstrong era. Thus the 1854 Class belongs to the \\"mainstream\\" of GWR 0-6-0 tank classes that leads towards the larger GWR pannier tanks of the 20th century.

Most of the class worked in the GWR's Southern Division, the majority of them in South Wales. Two examples were to be found in the GWR London Division at time of nationalisation.

After the fall of Metternich's absolutism in the Revolution of 1848, there appeared on the scene a young generation preoccupied with urban life and contemporary social problems, and determined to reintroduce Czech as a literary language. Politically they promoted the cause of liberty, democracy, and social justice, fighting the reactionary Bach government and making efforts to improve the status of the Czech nation within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The first yearbook of the group was published in 1858. Named M√°j (\\"May\\") after M√°cha's great poem, it included contributions by Jan Neruda and V√≠tƒõzslav H√°lek, as well as Adolf Heyduk, Rudolf Mayer, Karolina Svƒõtl√°, Jakub Arbes, Karel Sabina, Josef V√°clav Friƒç and Gustav Pfleger-Moravsk√Ω. Their verse tales were described as Byronic although the closer influence was probably Pushkin. Their efforts were to a great extent responsible for bringing Czech literature into the European mainstream. They were major advocates of the National Theatre of Prague, for which the foundation stone was laid in 1868. Their reformist concerns were also reflected in journalistic endeavours.

While it is true that there is a superficial resemblance, above the running plate; that the 2361s likewise have diameter wheels; and that they are numbered in the same sequence; they are nevertheless a quite separate class, having a longer cylinder stroke, larger boiler, longer wheelbase, and consequently greater tractive effort. Use The 2361s were originally allocated to the Worcester Division, and then worked in the London area. Some subsequently worked in the Wolverhampton Division, and at miscellaneous sheds such as Neath, Llanelly, Bristol and Oswestry.

A deeply religious person, Harvey's faith and her own interest in nature were primary sources for her work. Early life and family Born in Dallas, Georgia, Harvey was the seventh of thirteen children born to Homer and Rosie Mae White. At the age of fourteen, she married Charles Harvey and settled in Buena Vista, Georgia.She divorced Harvey in 1968 and relocated independently to Alcoa, Tennessee, where she was raising eleven children by age 35. As a child, she recalls making \\"something out of nothing,\\" often creating her own toys and dolls. In addition to having eleven children, Harvey had twenty-eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.  Career  In 1977, Harvey began working at Blount Memorial Hospital as a housekeeper. For extra income, at night while everyone was asleep Harvey would make dolls. After exhibiting her artwork at the hospital, her work drew attention and gallery representation. One of the staff doctors introduced her to the directors of the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York City, which continued to sell her work exclusively for several years.  Works  Harvey's sculptures were typically wood decorated with paint, beads, shells, cloth, and other found materials, combining \\"performance (on the order of a puppet show) sculpture, painting, and assemblage\\". After that time, she increasingly focused on her artwork until her death in 1994. Harvey's work belongs to a larger tradition of black vernacular art created in the American South. The assemblage aspect of her work, the use of found materials, and emphasis on religious themes are common to the black vernacular art tradition. As a creator of visionary art, She often claims that God is the main source for her work, even to the extent that He is working through her: \\"I‚Äôm really not the artist. God is the artist in my work; nature and insects, they shape my work for me, because they belong to God. I belong to God, and all things belong to God, because it‚Äôs in his Word that all things are made to him, that without him there‚Äôs not anything made.\\" According to Harvey, God allowed her to see anthropomorphic forms within the wood she worked with, and with that help she could give physical shape to the spiritual presences within these tree roots, limbs, and pieces of driftwood. Her interest in nature was due in part to her belief that she could access or see the spirit of her ancestors within trees, for example, and her general belief in transcendentalism. Her work often reflected specific biblical stories, including stories from Genesis and Revelation. She also created a series of works inspired by the African- American experience in the United States. When naming her works, she frequently used an African-English dictionary to provide a direct connection to African culture.  Exhibitions, holdings, and influence  Harvey's work has been included in over 50 exhibitions, including a posthumous inclusion in the 1995 Whitney Biennial. Her work Cross Bearers was subsequently purchased by the Whitney Museum for its permanent collection. She was also the subject of a major retrospective in 1997 at the Tennessee Museum of Art. Her works are in the permanent collections of the Knoxville Museum of Art and the American Folk Art Museum, New York. Harvey has been cited as an influence by Alison Saar, and a street in Alcoa has been named after her.

It is based on a FinePix S5 Pro, which is in turn based on the Nikon D200. It has a Nikon F lens mount and can use most lenses made for 35 mm Nikon SLR cameras. It replaces the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro UVIR. Unlike most digital cameras, there is no IR or UV filtering in front of the image sensor. This results in a wide spectral response of approximately 1000 nm to 380 nm (infrared to ultraviolet). Suitable external bandpass filters are required to photograph in IR or UV wavelengths. Infrared filters are readily available at low cost from many sources, but ultraviolet filters ‚Äì and suitable lenses ‚Äì can be expensive. Photography in infrared and ultraviolet poses its own special challenges regarding exposure and ‚Äì above all ‚Äì focusing a SLR camera. By definition, these forms of light are invisible to the human eye. The IS Pro includes a Live View mode that relays what the sensor sees as live video to the LCD screen (and, optionally, via USB to a computer running appropriate software). Some lenses have separate IR focus index marks, which help, but few if any have UV marks. True ultraviolet photographic lenses are generally made from special glass because normal optical glass does not pass UV particularly well. However, because the sensor is only sensitive to long- wavelength UV, a quartz lens is not required. The IS Pro was originally intended for specialist markets like Forensic photography, medical, museum and fine art. FujiFilm generally restricts the sale of these cameras to professional users in these and similar fields; their EULA specifically prohibits \\"unethical photographic conduct\\".(archived) Fujifilm IS-1 web page including EULA Very few have ever gone on open public sale, although some were made available via dealers at closeout prices in fall 2010. A niche use for these cameras is in field of astrophotography. The extended IR and UV sensitivity makes them useful for imaging Ha emission nebulae.

He became one of the only doctors in Northwest Arkansas to provide this service to women, as other physicians stopped offering to perform abortions. His Fayetteville Women's Clinic was frequently picketed and blocked by pro- life protesters. Biography Harrison was born on September 8, 1935, in Faulkner County, Arkansas. His mother joked that it was inevitable that her son would become an obstetrician, after he had been born at home while his father was on the way to get a doctor to come to the house. He went to church and read through the Bible twice before reaching his teens, but was \\"thoroughly unimpressed with the God it described\\", as The New York Times stated in his obituary. He attended the University of Central Arkansas, but received rather poor grades and enlisted in the United States Navy. After completing his military service, he enrolled in the University of Arkansas, switching his planned major from business to pre-med in order to impress the woman he would later marry. After completing his undergraduate degree, he received his medical training at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, where he received his M.D. and performed his internship and residency. While at medical school in 1967, studying obstetrics, he examined a patient whom he determined was pregnant. When told she was going to have a baby, she said, \\"Oh, God, doctor, I was hoping it was cancer\\" -- words that stuck with Harrison throughout his career as a physician.Martin, Douglas. \\"Dr. William Harrison, Defender of Abortion Rights, Dies at 75\\", The New York Times, September 25, 2010. Accessed September 28, 2010. The Fayetteville Women's Clinic was established in 1972. After abortion in the United States was legalized following the United States Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, Harrison began offering abortion services to his patients starting in 1974, though at the time he primarily performed handled births, delivering more than 6,000 babies through his practice. As the years progressed, he started to see more women looking for an abortion and he ultimately gave up delivering babies. He wanted to provide his patients with a safe option to terminate pregnancy and started getting more patients as other doctors in Northwest Arkansas abandoned the procedure. In data provided by NARAL Pro- Choice America in 2010, 97% of counties in Arkansas had no abortion provider.Arkansas: Political Info and Laws in Brief, NARAL Pro-Choice America. Accessed September 28, 2010. Harrison had no qualms about becoming the only abortion provider in the area and frequently spoke in public about his defense of a woman's right to reproductive choice, saying, \\"I have chosen to ride this tiger unquietly, raking its side with verbal spurs, swinging my hat and whooping like a cowboy\\". In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he offered free abortions to women who had survived the disaster. In a 2005 profile in the Los Angeles Times, Harrison said that he had been encouraged by his wife to retire after undergoing surgery for a head injury, but as one of only two abortion providers in the state, he felt that \\"there's no one to take my place.\\"Simon. \\"Los Angeles Times Profiles Arkansas Abortion Provider William Harrison\\", Medical News Today, December 1, 2005, copy of article from Los Angeles Times. Accessed September 27, 2010. He performed an estimated 20,000 abortions during his career. As a physician, Harrison believed that there was a higher moral value to protect the well-being of a pregnant woman, but would not perform abortions during the third trimester of pregnancy, even in cases where the fetus is severely disabled, as infants at that stage of development are viable and can feel pain.Simon, Stephanie. \\"THE NATION; COLUMN ONE; Offering Abortion, Rebirth; Yes, an Arkansas doctor says, he destroys life.

He would send women seeking a late-term abortion to Dr. George Tiller, who ran a clinic in Wichita, Kansas, often providing gas money to women making the trip.

Also in 1942, construction began on Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat Battery (AMTB) 944, with two fixed and two towed 90 mm guns, along with the Harbor Entrance Control Post (HECP) for Boston Harbor--the installation that kept track of all vessels entering and leaving the harbor. AMTB 944 replaced Battery Taylor in October 1943, whose guns were placed in storage at that time.Berhow, p. 205 By 1945 Fort Dawes had a mine casemate controlling some of the mines guarding the northern approach to Boston Harbor. Fort Dawes can also lay claim to the largest collection of \\"artillery that never was\\" in the harbor defenses of Boston. Battery 105 and Battery 207 began construction in 1942. Battery 105 was completed as a large bunker housing magazines and fire control for two 16-inch guns, like those at Battery Murphy in Nahant and generally similar to the guns of Battery Long at Fort Duvall. By the time the emplacements had been finished, however, WW2 was being won, and the need for the battery was deemed to have passed, so it was never armed. The nearby battery of two 6-inch guns, Battery 207, was also never equipped with guns, for the same reason. In 1946 AMTB 944 was disarmed, and within a few years the site was abandoned. However, in the summer of 1956 or perhaps a bit longer, the airfield was used to run flights testing the new ideas of air traffic control. A small radar was installed there and used to track flights to determine if an airplane could be directed to follow a predetermined path. Prof. Eugenio Calabi was advisor on the project. In the early 1990s all of the military facilities on Deer Island were demolished and the earth stripped away for the construction of the Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Plant. All vestiges of Fort Dawes were destroyed.

The action of the drama takes place in Swabia during the Middle Ages. Performances Lucie H√∂flich in Das K√§thchen von Heilbronn, 1905, Deutsches Theater, Berlin The play was first performed at the Theater an der Wien on 17 March 1810 and then published in the same year. Originally, the first two acts appeared separately with the play Ph√∂bus, also by Kleist. Although the play has gained respect among modern audiences, it was originally largely rejected. Goethe, who was director of the theatre at Weimar when it was written, refused at first to present it, calling it \\"a jumble of sense and nonsense.\\" It was also passed over by the Dresdener Hoftheater and the Berliner Schauspielhaus, and in Germany the play was initially only seen in Bamberg's less famous theatre.

K√§thchen, says the blacksmith, shows an \\"unnatural possession\\" when Count von Strahl enters the shop, bowing before him \\"as if struck by lightning\\". K√§thchen is also accused of following the Count and then throwing herself out of a second story window in his presence. Interrogated to the point of being bullied, K√§thchen confesses to never having been bewitched. The esteemed Count is found not guilty of making advances toward Theobald's daughter, and the court dismisses the case against him entirely. Act 2 ‚Äì In a forest near the cave of the Secret Court. Later in the mountains near a coal miner's hut. It is night with thunder and lightning At the beginning of Kleist's second act Count von Strahl yearns for K√§thchen in a monologue. It becomes increasingly evident that he is not capable of acting on these feelings, given the vast social class divisions between them. We also learn of the Count's enemy, Kunigunde, whose impending lawsuits would take away much of Strahl's rightful lands. Kunigunde's former suitor, Maximilian Frederick, however, has kidnapped her. Strahl unknowingly defeats his enemy's capturer and frees Kunigunde. The rules of hospitality at the time require that he invite her back to his castle, whereupon she learns of a dream. The dream indicates that he will find his future bride in the daughter of the emperor. Kunigunde, aware of the information, presents herself as this prophesied woman. Soon, the Count is considering making Kunigunde his wife. Act 3 ‚Äì Hermitage in a mountainous forest. Later at the Thurneck Castle K√§thchen, in her shame, wants to enter a convent despite her father's objections. In a last attempt to keep his daughter out of the convent, Theobald suggests that she follow Count von Strahl. The Rhine Graf, now betrayed by Kunigunde, decides to attack Count von Strahl. Through a series of unforeseen events K√§thchen intercepts his plans to attack and rushes off to warn Strahl. After his refusal to read the letter, he threatens to whip K√§thchen for returning. Eventually Strahl reads the letter and learns of the impending attack. After the fighting has subsided Kunigunde sees an opportunity to get rid of K√§thchen and sends her into a burning building to retrieve a picture. K√§thchen, with the help of an angel, escapes the building unscathed. Act 4 ‚Äì In the mountains, surrounded by waterfalls and a bridge. Later at the Strahl Castle Strahl pursues the Rhine Graf and K√§thchen accompanies them. K√§thchen falls asleep beneath an elderberry bush where Strahl questions her. Through questioning they discover that they have met already in their dreams. The Count then begins to realize that K√§thchen is his real prophesied wife. K√§thchen walks in on Kunigunde during her bathing and is so shocked by what she sees that she cannot speak a word. Kunigunde, having been discovered, decides to have K√§thchen poisoned. Act 5 ‚Äì City of Worms in a plaza in front of the imperial castle. The throne is to one side. Later in a cavern with a view of the countryside. Finally, the castle square with a view of the castle and a church Strahl confronts the emperor about the validity of K√§thchen's nobility and in a monologue of the emperor he confesses that he is her biological father. Strahl invites K√§thchen to his wedding, but in a twist she learns that it is her wedding. Shocked by this sudden turn of events, K√§thchen passes out and the play ends in turmoil. Author comments K√§thchen and the Count of Strahl on the Heinrich von Kleist Memorial in Frankfurt (Oder) In a letter to Marie v. Kleist (Berlin, Summer 1811), Heinrich v. Kleist wrote: \\"The judgement of the masses has governed me too much until now; especially K√§thchen von Heilbronn bears witness to that. From the beginning, it was a marvellous concept and only the intent to adapt it for stage play has led me to mistakes that I would now like to cry over. In short, I want to soak up the thought that, if a work is only quite freely sprung from one human mind, then that same work must necessarily belong to the whole of mankind.\\"\\"\\" \\"Because he who loves K√§thchen cannot completely disregard Penthesilea because they belong together like the + and - of algebra, and they are one and the same being, only imagined out of contrary relations.\\"\\"\\" Kleist in a letter to Heinrich J. von Collin (8 December 1808). \\"I am now eager to learn what you would have to say about K√§thchen, because she is the reverse side of Penthesilea [an Amazon- feminist heroine of an earlier play], her opposite pole, a creature as powerful through submission as Penthesilea is through action ...?\\"\\"\\" Kleist in a letter to Marie von Kleist (late autumn 1807) Trial by fire The trial by fire is originally a medieval ordeal meant to test the innocence of a defendant in undecided court cases. There were several types of trials by fire: walking barefoot over hot coals, holding a hot piece of iron in one's hands, or wearing a shirt dipped in hot wax. Whoever managed to survive such an ordeal was considered innocent. Other ordeals were also common, wherein the defendant with hands and feet bound together was thrown into water. Drowning confirmed the defendant's innocence, while staying afloat confirmed the guilty status and the defendant was then put to death. The trial by fire in this text is not referring to an actual ordeal, but simply a test for K√§thchen. She passes this test when she returns safely from the burning Thurneck Castle with the help of an angel.Grathoff, Dirk. \\"Notes\\" in Heinrich von Kleist's Das K√§thchen von Heilbronn. Reclam, 1992.

The team was formed by Dave Berry, the manager of the Latrobe Athletic Association, for the purpose of playing the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, which fielded a team composed of many of the game's stars from the era. The game between the two clubs ended in a 16-0 Duquesne victory and is considered to be the first all-star game for professional football. Contrary to popular belief, while the game was held at Exposition Park, which would be currently located inside of the city limits of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the 1898 location of the game was Allegheny, Pennsylvania which was not incorporated into the city of Pittsburgh until 1907. History =Origin= At the end of the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club's 1897 season, the club signed a number of talented players to contracts for the upcoming 1898 season. However, in April 1898, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began. As a result, many of the team's recently signed players ended up in the United States Army. Looking for a solution to the problem, Duquesne manager William Chase Temple went out and signed up replacement players. Temple succeeded, and he received excellent results, when it was noticed that some of the replacements actually ended up being even more talented than the original contracted stars. However that August, the war ended, with an American victory, and the soldiers quickly returned home. As a result, the Duquesnes suddenly found themselves with a surplus of pro football stars under contract. The team had so much depth, that it's benchwarmers would have starred for lesser teams. The amount of talent on the field was also reflected on the team's ledgers. Due to the high payroll, Temple eventually took over the payments to the athletes, thus becoming the first individual professional football team owner. After a 7‚Äì0‚Äì1 season, the Duquesnes' team was being compared favorably with the 1896 team put together for a two-game stand by the Allegheny Athletic Association, featuring Pudge Heffelfinger. =Fielding an all-star team= However Latrobe manager Dave Berry knew the all-star depth of the Duquesne team. He then conceived the idea of opposing the Duquesnes with an all-star team that drawn from the best players from all the other area teams. A game between the two teams was then arranged for Saturday, December 3, at Exposition Park. Berry began signing up stars, however he did not sign up everyone that he wanted. The leaders of the Greensburg Athletic Association opposed the game and did their best to discourage their players from taking part in it. The Washington & Jefferson Presidents football team also followed by disallowing their players from taking part in the game. Sam Boyle, an end from Penn State, was asked by Berry to be the team's captain, however he declined. No members from the Pittsburgh Athletic Club appeared on the team either. Berry was forced to rely heavily on his own Latrobe team, which fielded Eddie Wood, Doggie Trenchard, Harry Ryan, George Krebs, Bill Hammer, Jack Gass and Grennie Lewis. However George Barclay and Babe Rinehart, both from the Greensburg Athletic Association, decided to play on Berry's team despite the warnings given to them by Greensburg officials not to do so. The game The All-Stars were outplayed by their Duquesne opponents. While both teams consisted of top tier players, the All- Stars consisted of much individual talent but no teamwork. Meanwhile, Duquesne played the entire 1898 season together and formed the bonds of teamwork during that time. A little into the second quarter, Duquesne scored with a Roy Jackson touchdown. However, they could not convert the extra point, and the score stood 5-0 at halftime (touchdowns were only 5 points at the time). In the third quarter, Duquesne's J.A. Gammons ran 60 yards for a touchdown on a punt return. Roy Jackson scored Duquesne's third touchdown late in the game, after the team put together a scoring drive of 80 yards on just four plays. The extra point attempt failed, however the game ended in a 16-0 Duquesne win. Hours before the start of his all-star game, Dave Berry was \\"arrested\\" by one of his Latrobe players for a debt he claimed Berry owed him. Berry paid the $33 owed and then had the player arrested on false arrest charges. =Box score= =Attendance= Attendance for the game was only 1,500 people. Part of the blame was due to many Pittsburghers considering the football season over with the Thanksgiving Day games. Uncertain weather was also blamed for the poor attendance. However most of the blame went to the leaders of the Greensburg Athletic Association, who were accused of spreading rumors that various star players would not appear in the game.

In 1872, after the American Civil War ended, the Georgia General Assembly funded $1,000 so that the soldiers could be relocated and reburied in a general area. Initially, each grave was marked with a tin marker; however, by the 1930s, the markers were gone. The Patrick R. Cleburne Confederate Cemetery has 712 headstones with only three marked headstones. The three known soldiers in this cemetery are Agnatius Brooke, Robert Lindsay and Abner Joel Yancey. The headstones are patterned in the shape of the Confederate Flag. The walkways are shaped in the letter X and graves fill in the triangles of the X.(2005, July 28). 2005 Guide Book: Southside: About The Southside: Five Intriguing Places. The Atlanta Journal Constitution, 18GI. It is estimated that 600‚Äì1000 Confederate soldiers are buried here. The history behind this cemetery and other confederate cemeteries in Georgia is a mystery and continues to be researched today. Organizations continue to preserve historic documents and present new information to understand the history of Georgia and its confederate soldiers during the American Civil War.  Events and traditions  * In 1934, a granite monument, stone and metal fence, and stone archway were added. The ceremonies were attended by the last two survivors of the battle. * In 1971, Georgia governor Jimmy Carter assigned the upkeep of the six Georgian Confederate cemeteries to the Georgia Building Authority. * A grave-marking ceremony was held in honor of twice named Roll of Honor, Ensign Robert Lindsey, a fallen confederate soldier, from Company D, 4th Kentucky Infantry during May 1992 at the Patrick R. Cleburne Confederate Cemetery. He died in Clayton County, Georgia while carrying the company colors to the line. The exact grave site is unknown; however, the 4th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry and the Frankie Lyle chapter of United Daughters of the Confederacy placed a marker in his honor at the cemetery.Case, C.

The 3001s, which had driving wheels, were built in two batches: * 3001-3020 (Lot 84, 1892) * 3021-3030 (Lot 86, 1891-2) Because of the restricted width available between the large driving wheels, these locomotives were fitted with narrow diameter boilers. In order to increase the heating surface the boilers were made longer than previous types, and were fitted with raised fireboxes. Despite the fact that the broad gauge was in its very final months, new broad gauge engines were still needed to maintain services, and eight of these new engines, Nos. 3021-3028, were built (as \\"convertibles\\") with the wheels outside the frames, to run on the broad gauge. They were duly converted back to \\"narrow\\" (standard) gauge in summer 1892. These engines were too heavy at the front end, and after a derailment in 1893 it was decided to give them front bogies. Thus transformed, in 1894 the class joined the 3031 Class, one of the most elegant of the entire late Victorian era.

The Blake Plateau lies in the western Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern United States coasts of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida. The Blake Plateau lies between the North American continental shelf and the deep ocean basin extending about 145 kilometers (90 miles) east and west by 170 kilometers (106 miles) north and south, with a depth of about 500 meters (1,640 feet) inshore sloping to about 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) about 375 kilometers (233 miles) off shore, where the Blake Escarpment drops steeply to the deep basin. The Blake Plateau, associated Blake Ridge and Blake Basin are named for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer , in service 1874-1905, that first used steel cable for oceanographic operations and pioneered deep ocean and Gulf Stream exploration. Survey lines of the steamer George S. Blake first defined the plateau that now bears the ship's name.  History  In July 1880 George S. Blake under the command of Commander John R. Bartlett, U.S.N., was working with sounding gear designed by Lieutenant Commander Sigsbee in cooperation with Alexander Agassiz collecting biological samples and examining the Gulf Stream running eastward from Cape Romain when, in taking frequent soundings eastward, \\"depths on this line were unexpectedly small, the axis of the Gulf Stream being crossed before a depth of three hundred fathoms (1,800 feet/549 meters) was found\\" with a bottom of \\"hard coral\\" and little life. This was early indication of the plateau that would in the future carry the ship's name. In 1882 Commander Bartlett described the plateau: Bartlett reported the scouring effect of the current on the plateau, noting that on each side of the current the sounding cylinder, a device for sampling the nature of the bottom with the sounding, brought up ooze. Within the current the \\"bottom was washed nearly bare\\", with particles being small and broken pieces of coral rock and so hard the sharp edge of the brass cylinder was bent.  Characteristics  A typical continental margin profile found at latitude 35¬∞N (a) is significantly different from that of latitude 31¬∞ 30‚Ä≤N (b). Both profiles are drawn using the same scale. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Ocean Explorer) = Geology = Due to unusual features of the plateau, particularly scouring by the Florida Current and the Antilles Current that merge over the plateau to form the Gulf Stream, mineral deposits, particularly manganese nodules, have long been of interest. Methane and other gas hydrates are also found on the plateau. = Biology = The Blake Plateau, although described as a \\"bleak, current-swept plain,\\" has biological communities including Lophelia pertusa reefs that support communities as well as communities supported by gas hydrates. Commercial fishermen have begun exploiting deep sea fish on the plateau with studies being undertaken on the viability as these fish, although large, grow slowly. Biological sampling of the deep, hard bottom is difficult under the Gulf Stream with the consequence that the fauna is relatively poorly known.

At the 1852 general election, Whitmore was elected MP for Bridgnorth in succession to his brother Thomas Charlton Whitmore. A petition was lodged against his election, but ultimately dismissed. He was Lord of the Treasury and keeper of the Privy Seal to the Prince of Wales from March 1858 to June 1859. Whitmore served as the Conservative party whip for many years until 1869. In 1865 Whitmore lost the seat in the election to John Dahlberg Acton (who became Lord Acton in 1869), but successfully petitioned and had the result overturned. The reinstated Whitmore was a Lord of the Treasury from July 1866 to December 1868, when the Conservatives lost power after implementation of the Reform Act 1867 and William Ewart Gladstone first became Prime Minister. In 1868, representation for Bridgnorth was reduced to one member, but Whitmore was returned (again defeating John Dahlberg Acton) and held the seat until 1870. In 1870, a by- election was held, and William Henry Foster elected to the seat, which he in turn held until its abolition in 1885.

It was ordered by Generalleutnant Friedrich-Wilhelm M√ºller, in retaliation for the support and involvement of the local population in the Cretan resistance. M√ºller, who earned the nickname \\"the Butcher of Crete\\", was executed after the war for his part in this and other massacres. Background Viannos is a mountainous area in the southeastern part of Heraklion regional unit, stretching between the feet of Mount Dikti in the north and the Libyan Sea in the south coast of Crete. Following the Battle of Crete in 1941 during which the island fell to the Axis, Viannos and the nearby Lasithi were part of the Italian occupation zone. Until the end of 1942, the Italians had hardly any presence in the area, hence facilitating the set up and activation of several resistance groups. Among them was one of the largest guerrilla bands in Crete, led by Manolis Bandouvas. In early 1943, the increasing activity of guerrillas combined with the rumors that the Allies had plans to invade Crete, led the Italians to start the construction of coastal fortifications and install garrisons in the region. On the other hand, the Germans had started since 1942 to station forces of their own in the coastal villages of Tsoutsouros and Arvi. In May 1943, they also established an outpost with three men in Kato Simi that were in charge of collecting potatoes for the provision of occupation troops and keeping the surroundings under surveillance.Moss, Stanley W. Ill Met By Moonlight, Orion, 2014, . Ambush at Kato Simi The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 followed by the Italian armistice announced on September 8 and the smuggling of the Italian commander of eastern Crete Angelico Carta to Egypt, reinforced the rumors that an Allied operation against Crete was imminent. Prompted by this misapprehension, Bandouvas ordered an attack against the German outpost in Kato Simi.Davis, Wes. The Ariadne Objective: The Underground War to Rescue Crete from the Nazis, Crown, 2013.Kokonas, Nikos A. The Cretan Resistance, 1941-1945, Zeno, London, 1993. According to British sources, he acted without consulting the British; he anticipated that the Allies would soon land, and hoped that he would emerge as a national hero when they did so. Bandouvas later claimed he had instructed his men to capture the Germans alive, conforming to orders from Cairo. Nevertheless, his claims were denied by SOE agents Patrick Leigh Fermor and Thomas James Dunbabin. Another theory for Bandouvas‚Äô motives suggests that he naively fell into a provocative trap treacherously set by the British who, preparing for the post-war era, aimed to wipe out the increasingly popular local units of pro-communist EAM/ELAS.Œî.

Kidnap in Crete: The True Story of the Abduction of a Nazi General, Bloomsbury, 2015, p. 92. Battle of Kato Simi The bodies of the two German soldiers stationed in Kato Simi were discovered and news of the incident reached their superiors, who ordered an infantry company to move to the village and investigate their fate. In the meantime, Bandouvas had realized that the village was in danger and he was left with no other option but to defend it. Thus, he set an ambush with 40 of his men in a valley near the entrance of Kato Simi and waited for the Germans. They appeared on the morning of September 12 and were assaulted with running fire. Despite their initial surprise, the Germans managed to retreat and a fierce battle began that lasted until the late afternoon. The Germans were finally defeated, suffering heavy losses.Leong Kok Wey, Adam. Killing the Enemy: Assassination Operations in World War II, I.B. Tauris, 2015. Twelve Germans were captured alive. Bandouvas' partisans lost only one man and withdrew to the mountains. Reprisals On the day following the elimination of the German company in Kato Simi, a large force numbering more than 2000 men started to gather in Viannos. Exasperated by the loss of his men and wanting to set an example for fleeing Italians who were considering joining with the partisans, the commander of Heraklion Friedrich-Wilhelm M√ºller ordered troops of the 65th regiment of the 22. Luftlande Infanterie-Division garrison unit to destroy Viannos and promptly execute all males over the age of sixteen as well as everyone who was arrested in the countryside, irrespective of gender or age. Hence, a plan for the systematic destruction of Viannos was put into place starting on September 13. Separated into smaller groups, forces from the Grenadier-Regiment 65 surrounded the region, invading it simultaneously from various directions. At the beginning, they reassured the locals that their intentions were peaceful, persuading many of the men who had fled to the mountains to return to their homes. On the following day (14 September), indiscriminate mass executions, impromptu shootings and arrests, as well as looting, arsons, vandalism, demolition and destruction of harvests, took place.Œ£œÑŒ≠œÜŒ±ŒΩŒøœÇ Œë.

About 200 more civilians were held hostages. Around 1000 buildings, mostly houses, were destroyed. The surviving villagers were forbidden to bury their dead or return to their homes, most of which had been burned to the ground. No reparations were ever paid to those who survived. It took the villages many years to recover, although some never managed to achieve that completely. Most of Bandouvas' guerrillas dispersed in the nearby mountains whilst he and a few men fled westwards, being chased by the Germans. They were joined by resistance groups of the White mountains range, and during October 1943, clashed with German detachments on several occasions. In reprisal, the Germans executed several civilians in the villages of Kali Sykia and Kallikratis. In November 1943, Bandouvas was eventually evacuated to Egypt. General M√ºller was captured by the Red Army in East Prussia and later extradited to Greece. Along with Bruno Br√§uer, commander of the ‚Äò‚ÄôFestung Kreta‚Äô‚Äô between 1942‚Äì44, he was charged with war crimes by a Greek military court.Psychoundakis, George.

It was released on the Acorn Atom sometime around 1982 and on the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro in 1983. Gameplay The game is a text adventure, being an attempted reconstruction of the original Adventure computer game, although it is not very faithful to the original mainframe version. In-game screenshot (Acorn Electron) In this version of the game, the player must rescue a princess from the Magic Caverns. There are over a hundred different locations and many problems must be solved in order to achieve this goal. The game supports one or two word commands and the most useful commands are available via function key shortcuts e.g. INVENTORY, CHECK SCORE etc. The game's instructions do not reveal all valid verbs, as it is left to the player to discover them. The instructions also mention that the Arabian Nights folk tales may provide useful hints to the player. The Acorn Atom version of the game requires 12K of RAM and is unrelated to another Acorn Atom title (a text adventure game engine), also called Adventure from Acornsoft.
