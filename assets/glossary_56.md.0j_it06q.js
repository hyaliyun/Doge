It is about 8.5 km (5 miles) north of Ballyshannon and 16 km (10 miles) southwest of Donegal Town. The area's 3 km (2 mile) long beach or 2km if measuring from the cliffs to Carrickfad (long rock in Irish) which juts out from the headland and is visible at low tide. Donegal Bay is frequented by walkers, surfers, wind- surfers, kite-surfers and swimmers. Beach Rossnowlagh is one of Ireland's and Europe's best Blue Flag surfing beaches. As the slowly rising beach faces westward into the Atlantic Ocean, and the fact that Donegal Bay has a funnel- like shape, it can increase the size of the waves, especially in winter when some huge rollers are generated and it has been known to have waves up to 7 metres (20 ft) high. Rossnowlagh has good safe facilities and has excellent water quality. Rossnowlagh beach Rossnowlagh has many visitors during the summer months and most of the beach is accessible by car. Drivers are cautioned however to be aware of soft sand areas where cars can get stuck and to be aware of incoming tides which can move in rapidly and cover most/all of the beach. There may be a Beach Warden on duty and information about full and low tides may be displayed. Drivers on the beach are required to drive very slowly at 15 km/h (10mph) and to be on the lookout for children and other users of the beach. A soil erosion study of the beach at Rossnowlagh, known officially as Belalt Strand, has been made. The area consists mainly of sandy beach, but also rocky shore platform, sand dunes, grassland, boulder clay cliffs and rock cliffs. Over the last 60 years it has been determined that the central section of the dune front has been eroding at rates up to 0.6 metres (2 ft) per year, with the highest erosion rate between 1951 and 1977. Starting in 1972, short lengths of rock armour were constructed at first in front of the Sandhouse Hotel and with further additions along the shore-line; this stopped the erosion in protected parts but the dune front has a ragged appearance with up to of erosion where half of the sandy shoreline has no protection.LIFE Project 1999 and LIFE Project 2000 The beach was the setting for the recording of the music video for Nathan Carter's version of Wagon Wheel. Public transport access The Seirbhís Iompair Tuaithe Teoranta (SITT) Rural Transport/ Locallink Donegal Donegal Town to Ballyshannon route serves Rossnowlagh every day.http://www.locallinkdonegal.ie/ Onward connections are available at Ballyshannon such as Ulsterbus for example. The nearest railway station is Sligo railway station. Bus Éireann services from Ballyshannon serve Sligo bus station which is located beside the railway station. Amenities The main amenity is the extensive beach which is very popular with families. It is frequented by walkers, joggers, sunbathers, surfers, wind-surfers, kite-surfers, doggers and swimmers, and is accessible by car via 3 ramps. There is about 3 km (2 miles) of wide sandy beach although it is possible to walk several more kilometres further along the shore and all the way to Murvagh Beach. The Sandhouse Hotel is located adjacent to the beach, with a Surfers Bar attached. Overlooking the beach and on the cliff is the Smuggler's Creek Inn restaurant and bar, and there are several shops in the area, along with a Post-Office and Shop near the Franciscan Friary as well as The Thatch Tea House nearby. The Franciscan Friary is located up from the southern end of the beach.Raphoe Diocese The Friary has a Visitor Centre and contains the Donegal Historical Society Museum which houses a small collection including stone age flints and old Irish musical instruments. The Friary also has gardens which are open to visitors. To the south-west further along the cliffs in the distance stands the ruined Kilbarron Castle which is accessible via Creevy. Events View from Rossnowlagh strand * Rossnowlagh Surf Club hosts several surfing events, some with dozens of young surfers competing. For example, competitions are held for U12, U14 and U16 age groups. * The annual Orange Order parade for the County Donegal Orange Lodge is held each year in Rossnowlagh, usually on the Saturday before 12 July. The number of participants and marching bands varies each year with most marchers coming from Order lodges based in Northern Ireland but some come from other areas in Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan. There is no lodge in Rossnowlagh. The participants begin near St John's Church and march for approximately 2 km (1¼ miles) into the centre of Rossnowlagh, where they congregate for some time. The marchers march back to St John's church area in the late afternoon. * The Irish National Junior Surfing Championships have been hosted in Rossnowlagh, such as in 2007 where 113 young surfers competed for titles in U12, U14, U16 and U18 levels, including events for bodyboard and longboard. Rossnowlagh Surf Club members have been successful in these and other surfing competitions. * An annual Feis (Irish Gaelic: pronounced fesh) is held each summer in July or August at the Franciscan Friary in Rossnowlagh. The feis is officially called the Feis of the Four Masters or ' in Irish. One of the Four Masters, Michael O'Cleirigh, comes from the nearby locality. * The Inter-Counties Surfing contest is Ireland's longest-running surfing contest and has been held every year since 1969. As it is normally the last surfing event of the year in Ireland, held in September or October, it is widely viewed as a social event of the surfing calendar, and the actual surfing often takes second place to the craic and social enjoyment. In the last decade the contest has turned into a battle between the two dominant counties in Irish Surfing, hailing from opposite ends of the country — Donegal and Waterford. * The World Rally Championship came to the Rossnowlagh area in 2007 and again in 2009. Rally Ireland organised both events. The rally which drew a large number of spectators was held in the townland of Cashel on the northern edge of Rossnowlagh and was labelled the Donegal Bay stage. This special stage was 14 km (9 miles) long on narrow single-lane tarmac back roads. In 2007 it was won by Jari-Matti Latvala and in 2009 by Mikko Hirvonen. Sébastien Loeb was the overall winner of both rallies. * Cartys Annual Christmas Shore fishing competition is to be held at Rossnowlagh on 27 December 2017. History =Franciscan Friary= There had been 500 years of Franciscan history in Donegal Rossnowlagh Friary when the link was broken in the mid-19th century. However, the Franciscan order re-established themselves in County Donegal when new friary buildings were built in Rossnowlagh in the early 1950s. The land for the Friary was donated by Charles Williamson to his brother and Franciscan, Brother Paschal Williamson. =Railway Transport= Rossnowlagh railway station opened in 1905 but closed on 1 January 1960. It was part of the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee network with the train running towards Ballyshannon (where a walk across the town to the other station in Ballyshannon run by the Great Northern Railway of Ireland, would be required for Bundoran or Enniskillen) to the south and north to Donegal Town, Stranorlar, Strabane (where passengers could change onto the Great Northern Railway of Ireland, to reach Omagh) and Derry. During the 55 years of its operation, Rossnowlagh, with its 2 miles of golden beach, became a popular venue for excursionists, and it was particularly favoured by families, daytrippers and for groups on their annual outings. =Bus transport= Between 1999 and 2000 Bus Éireann route 484 served Rossnowlagh on Fridays only linking it to Ballyshannon for onward connections. Rossnowlagh had a regular daily bus service until the late 1980s. People The surfer Easkey Britton lives here.

Background Lawrence Gellert's brother was artist Hugo Gellert, here in a self-portrait (circa 1918) Lawrence Gellert was born László Grünbaum on September 14, 1898, in Budapest, Hungary. He came to America at the age of seven and grew up in New York City. His mother was Katica Schwartz, while his father was Ábrahám Grünbaum, was a skilled craftsman (tailor) by trade. Both parents were ethnically Jewish, but Lawrence's mother had converted to Catholicism while in Hungary and remained devoutly Christian all her life. The Grünbaum family had left Hungary in part to keep their five sons from being drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army. Lawrence's oldest brother, Hugo Gellert, was accepted into Cooper Union as an art student, won a scholarship to study in Paris, and was soon doing illustrations for The New York Times and later, The New Yorker. When Hugo adopted the surname \\"Gellert\\" after a Hungarian Catholic saint who had championed the poor, the family followed suit. When the United States entered World War I, another brother, Ernest (a pacifist and conscientious objector) received a 10-years sentence to a military prison in New Jersey. One morning in March 1918, Ernest was found dead in his cell of a gunshot wound to the head. This was a hugely traumatic event for the family, who were certain Ernest had been tormented and then murdered by the guards. The newspapers reported Ernest's death as a suicide. Hugo Gellert, an impassioned anti- militarist, had fled to Mexico for the duration of the war. Career Lawrence Gellert's education was spotty and he dropped out of high school after attending briefly. During the 1920s he found work on a newspaper but was stricken with lung and rib infections and possibly also suffered a mental breakdown. On the advice of his doctors, he maintained, he moved around 1924 to Tryon, North Carolina, in an attempt to recover his health, having originally intended to go to Florida. In Tryon he found friends, joined an amateur theater group, and at some point began writing down the words of African American spirituals and then making audio recording of them, using at first a makeshift, wind-up recording machine and paper-backed zinc discs (now inaudible), and, after 1930, a Presto disc recorder. Gellert's biographer, Bruce Conforth, relates that contrary to what has been written elsewhere, Gellert, who was fascinated with the striking beauty, especially, of African American religious music, was \\"very slow\\" to become interested in issues of racial justice and equality and was only pushed into it by his brother Hugo. =Folk song collecting= From 1933 to 1937 Gellert was back in New York City but made short trips through North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, collecting folksongs of black Americans. At one point, Gellert's automobile was \\"allegedly known as 'Larry's Nigger Hoo Doo Shack on Wheels'.\\" Throughout the 1930s Lawrence frequently contributed to the magazine the Masses (later the New Masses), where his brother Hugo was on the editorial staff. Several of his columns appeared under the title \\"Negro Protest Songs\\", illustrated by Hugo with pictures of lynchings. These were published in book form under the titles Negro Songs of Protest (1936) and Me and My Captain (1939). Steven Garabedian has described the press reception of Negro Songs of Protest this way: > In a short profile in 1936, Time magazine applauded the \\"lean, scraggly- > haired New Yorker\\" for his skill in \\"collecting Negro songs that few white > men have ever heard.\\" His collection, determined the New York Times, > unearthed a \\"new genre\\" of black music dealing with \\"the realities of Negro > life.\\" The left-wing press was even more enthusiastic. The Communist Party > newspaper Daily Worker called the release of Negro Songs of Protest a > \\"landmark in American culture.\\" Composer Lan Adomian, in New Masses, wrote > that the book featured \\"some of the finest examples in Negro folk music\\" of > the day. The material, he concluded, represented an \\"indictment\\" against > long-standing white ignorance and denial, a stark rebuke to \\"the slander > that a nation of thirteen million people, reduced to peonage, is nothing > more than a grand minstrel show.\\"Steven Garabedian, 'Negro Songs of > Protest,' and the Left-Wing Folk-Song Revival of the 1930s and 1940s\\". > American Quarterly : 57 (March 2005):1. Selections from Gellert's recordings were released in 1973 and 1982 by Rounder Records as vinyl LPs and 1984 on Heritage Records (HT-304). In the 1990s these were reissued on two CDs by Document Records, edited by University of Michigan folklorist and ethnomusicologist Bruce Conforth. In 2008, Conforth published his long-awaited biography, African American Folksong and American Cultural Politics: The Lawrence Gellert Story (2013). =Fabrication of Protest Songs= During his lifetime, Gellert was suspected by other folklorists and colleagues of doctoring or even of having fabricated the songs he presented as \\"Negro protest songs\\", since they were unable to find parallels anywhere. Gellert also refused to share any information on the identity of the singers he recorded nor the dates on which he collected this material, ostensibly to protect the singers from reprisal. Conforth concludes that Gellert (or someone connected to the New Masses) did indeed fabricate the protest songs. This was done to lend distinction to Gelltert's material, which was otherwise indistinguishable from the repertoire collected by other researchers, the difference being only in the manner in which Gellert's material was packaged. Moreover, Gellert falsified much else about his life, such as that he had witnessed a lynching and had lived with a black woman. Conforth explains that, in his opinion, Gellert, a weak and dependent character, who since his twenties had been a chronic invalid and then an alcoholic, was manipulated into doing this by the \\"Left\\" (who included his brother Hugo and New Masses editor, Mike Gold). Crnforth believes that Lawrence was also motivated by a desire to increase his standing in the eyes of his surviving brothers: Hugo, the famous artist, and also Otto and Theodore (Ted) Gellert, who together owned a prosperous import-export business and who financed Lawrence's recording ventures. As described by Conforth, in fact, Gellert was an inveterate fabulist whose stories about himself and how he made his recordings are completely unreliable. Conforth believes that Gellert's large collection, which comprises predominantly blues and devotional songs, is of great historical importance nevertheless. According to Conforth, Gellert had no interest in politics himself. Nor was he interested in white folk music, which he despised. A strikingly handsome man, who was, especially when young, very attractive to women, Gellert had originally wanted to become a Broadway actor. Death In old age, Gellert, who lived in downtown New York City, became known as an eccentric Greenwich Village character. In 1979, at the age of 80, he disappeared after reportedly having become a \\"person of interest\\" (or believing that he was) in the disappearance of Etan Patz, a notorious kidnapping-murder case, since the Patzes lived nearby. Conforth interviewed Lawrence's older brothers, who had supported Lawrence financially all his life, and came away believing the family had somehow spirited him away to protect his fragile mental health from the stress of being linked to the case.

It was founded by Cecilia Tan, who is also its manager. It specializes in science fiction erotica, a once uncommon genre, and its publications often feature BDSM themes. History Cecilia Tan founded the house in 1992 after researching the markets for publication of her own stories, which combined science fiction plotlines with explicitly sexual themes. At the time, science fiction publications turned away such material as unsuitable for their audience, and most publishers of erotic material were hard-core pornographers and uninterested in any material whose plotlines extended beyond the simple formula encounter story (in which two people meet and sex ensues). The ground-breaking combination of sex-positive, woman- centered erotica with science fiction and fantasy themes came as a result of Tan's editorial vision that rather than combine the worst clichés of both genres, the mixture could instead expand the boundaries of what was possible in each. Science fiction had developed a somewhat deserved reputation for being dismissive or neglectful of human character development issues like love, lust, attraction, and family issues, while erotica was definitely ripe for something beyond the encounter formula. Placing stories into a science fictional or magical context allowed writers for Circlet Press to remove their stories from their contemporary political context and sidestep issues such as feminism, AIDS, and sexual identity politics. Circlet Press has been identified with a peer group of start-up \\"alternative sexuality\\" publishers and businesses, including Greenery Press, Daedalus Publishing, Black Books, Obelesk Books, Blowfish, and The Stockroom). Their arrival also coincided with the burgeoning of a women's erotica movement, evidenced by the publication of many upscale trade paperback anthologies such as Herotica, Best American Erotica edited by Susie Bright, On A Bed of Rice (ed. Geraldine Kudaka), Slow Hand (ed. Michele Slung), and many others coming from the mainstream publishing houses. Lesbian bookseller Gilda Bruckman, who for years headed one of the leading women's bookstores in the US (New Words, formerly in Cambridge, MA), said, in support of the idea that Circlet's efforts were part of a growing trend in women's erotica, \\"I think the younger generation of women who see themselves as feminists... feel that it's central to their being. It's having control of the expression of one's sexuality, not being restricted to societal norms.\\" Effects on the market The effect that Circlet had on the mainstream science fiction seems to be twofold. One, the house nurtured a new generation of writers who were emboldened to use genre elements in their erotic fiction and erotic elements in their genre fiction. Two, by mapping out new territory, Circlet expanded what was possible, and acceptable, in sf/fantasy. The first tentative forays into \\"spicier\\" material by many of the mainstream science fiction imprints bore fruit in the form of strong sales and good reviews for titles such as Polymorph by Scott Westerfeld and The Black Jewels Trilogy by Anne Bishop. Tan spoke on many panels at science fiction conventions such as the World Fantasy Convention, World Science Fiction Convention, Philcon, Arisia, Boskone, and Lunacon about mixing and cross- pollinating genres. With erotica forging the way, the influx of romance into sf/f was not far behind, as writers like Catherine Asaro and Laurell K. Hamilton built readerships that included sf/f readers, mystery readers, and romance readers. Hamilton's \\"Anita Blake\\" books have grown sex-focused and explicitly sexual, and legions of \\"paranormal romance\\" writers and readers have followed in her wake.

He is also on the board of trustees of the think tank, the Fraser Institute, a director for the Manning Centre for Building Democracy and a non-executive director of HSBC. He is the former chairman of SNC-Lavalin and president and CEO of EnCana Corporation. Morgan writes a column for the business section of The Globe and Mail. Morgan was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada on December 30, 2010. Early years Morgan, the youngest child in a family of four, grew up on a small grain and livestock farm near Carstairs, Alberta. His father was originally from Wales. Education Morgan graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Alberta. He also has Post Graduate qualification including the Executive Business Program of Cornell University. Career In the 1970s, after graduating as an engineer, Morgan first worked for a Nebraska-based oil and gas company, then Alberta Energy Company (AEC), which was established in September 1973. He worked in \\"oil and gas exploration, production and pipelines in technical, operational, financial and management positions\\". By 1998, he was mentioned in Peter C. Newman's publication, Titans: How the New Canadian Establishment Seized Power, about \\"the new Canadian establishment\\", as a \\"promising comer to watch.\\" By 2003, Morgan was described in a Maclean's magazine profile as \\"the most powerful man in Canada's oil patch.\\" =Alberta Energy Company (1994-2003)= In the 1970s, after graduating as an engineer, Morgan first worked for the \\"Canadian subsidiary of a Nebraska-based oil and gas company\\" and in 1975 joined Alberta Energy Company (AEC), which was established in September 1973. When Morgan began at AEC it was during the start-up period and he was part of the founding management. He served as President and CEO from 1994 to 2003. =Encana (2003-)= Morgan founded EnCana Corporation and served as its President and Chief Executive Officer from April 2002 to December 31, 2005 and as Executive Vice Chairman from December 2005 to October 12, 2006. When Alberta Energy Corporation merged with PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd in 2002 to form EnCana, it was, according to the University of Alberta website, \\"widely viewed as the most significant transaction in Canadian energy sector history.\\" As President and CEO, in April 2002, Morgan launched EnCana Corporation's operations with former AEC staff as his management team, making the merger of the two companies more like an \\"AEC takeover\\", according to The Globe and Mail. By September 2005, Encana had become the number one company on the Toronto Stock Exchange—the first energy company to do so since 1980. In 2005, Morgan was listed in 9th place out of 25 in the Globe and Mail's \\"The Power 25\\", running \\"the continent's biggest natural gas empire, presiding over a critical commodity that powers the grid\\". In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the price of gas had increased to become more valuable than oil. By 2005 when Morgan left EnCana, the company \\"had become North America’s leading independent oil and natural gas production company, with a stock market value of approximately $60 billion.\\" =SNC-Lavalin= Morgan became an Independent Director of SNC- Lavalin Group Inc. on March 4, 2005 and from May 2007 through May 2013, he served as Chairman. =Canadian Council of Chief Executives= BY 2005, Morgan was director and a Vice-Chairman of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, now known as the Business Council of Canada (BCC), which includes CEOs of 150 leading Canadian companies. Boards of directors Along with his service on the Boards of Directors at AEC, Encana, SNC-Lavalin, and the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, over the years Morgan has also served as director at Industry Training Authority, Noblegen Inc., the Institute of the Americas, the Council for Canadian Unity, the Fraser Institute, the Manning Centre, American Petroleum Institute, Accenture Energy Advisory Board, Rio Tinto Alcan (Also known as Alcan Inc.) and Lafarge North America Inc. Morgan served as a director of HSBC Bank Canada from December 1996 to May 2012. Political views According to the Globe and Mail, by 2005 Morgan had become the \\"loudest voice in the oil patch trying to shout down the Kyoto Accord\\". Awards and honours Morgan was named Canada's Outstanding CEO of the Year in 2005. In 2005, he was named as Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering (FCAE). According to Bloomberg, he is the \\"recipient of the Canadian Business Leader Award from the University of Alberta and the Ivey Business Leader Award from the University of Western Ontario, two Honorary Degrees and an inductee to the Alberta Business Hall of Fame\\". In 2005 he was named as a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering (FCAE). Public appointment commission controversy In 2006, Morgan was appointed by Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper to chair the newly-established Public Appointments Commission. The appointment was rejected by opposition MPs due in part to statements Morgan had made linking refugees with crime in Canada. A May 17, 2006 article in the National Post criticized Morgan's opponents asking, \\"who but the hopelessly politically correct can deny the malign influence of violent gangs from Jamaica, Sri Lanka and East Asia on street life in Toronto, Vancouver and other Canadian urban centres?\\" His past role as a supporter and fundraiser for the Conservative Party of Canada was criticized as a possible conflict of interest with the commission's role of eliminating the use of public appointments for partisan patronage purposes. Canadian Air Force Morgan served as an Honorary Colonel of Canadian Air Force's 410 Tactical Fighter Squadron. Personal life Gwyn is married to Patricia Trottier. They live on Vancouver Island near Victoria, British Columbia.

History  A group of Don Cossacks took part in the Bulavin Rebellion in opposition to reforms of Peter the Great. After their defeat, starting from 1737, they began to take refuge in the Ottoman Empire and moved from the Kuban region where some of them, known as Nekrasov Cossacks, had settled earlier. A group settled around Constanţa on the Black Sea coast, while another group settled on the shores of Lake Manyas in northwestern Anatolia in 1740. In 1883, the group in Romania moved to Anatolia, first to settle on Mada Island on Lake Beyşehir, then to the shores of Lake Akşehir in Central Anatolia. In a separate event after the dissolution of the Zaporozhian Host and the destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich, up to 5000 Cossacks fled to the Turkish- controlled Danube delta where the Sultan allowed them to form the Danubian Sich. After several bloody clashes with Nekrasovites, resulting in most of them to either return to Russia or re-located to Manyas, and their support for Turkey against the Greeks during the Greek War of Independence, the Danubian Sich ended in 1828. Some returned to Russia, whilst others were moved to central Turkey and worked in forced labour. As of 1927, there were three Cossack villages in Turkey: Eski Kazaklar (later officially renamed as Kocagöl, the earlier settlement on the southwestern tip of Lake Manyas) and Yeni Kazaklar (founded by a community that left Eski Kazaklar and located on the northern shore of Lake Manyas) in Manyas district of Balıkesir Province, and Kazak (on the eastern shore of Lake Akşehir) in Akşehir district of Konya Province. Their main economic activity was fishery. In 1927, residents of Yeni Kazaklar left Turkey. Cossacks of Eski Kazaklar and Kazak decided to migrate in 1962, most Eski Kazaklar villagers repatriating to Russia, while most residents of Kazak chose to settle in the U.S. Footnotes References * Servet Somuncuoğlu, Don Kazakları, TİMAŞ Yayınları, Istanbul 2004.

The advantage of blogs is that posts and comments are easy to reach and follow due to centralized hosting and generally structured conversation threads. Although there are many different types of corporate blogs, most can be categorized as either external or internal. Types =Internal blogs= An internal blog, generally accessed through the corporation's Intranet, is a weblog that any employee can view. Many blogs are also communal, allowing anyone to post to them. The informal nature of blogs may encourage: * employee participation * free discussion of issues * collective intelligence * direct communication between various layers of an organization * a sense of community Internal blogs may be used in lieu of meetings and e-mail discussions, and can be especially useful when the people involved are in different locations, or have conflicting schedules. Blogs may also allow individuals who otherwise would not have been aware of or invited to participate in a discussion to contribute their expertise.Fernández Dutto, C. (September 19th, 2005)Internal blogs: How to design powerful conversations that open possibilities for action and collaboration within blogs =External blogs= An external blog is a publicly available weblog where company employees, teams, or spokespersons share their views. It is often used to announce new products and services (or the end of old products), to explain and clarify policies, or to react on public criticism on certain issues. It also allows a window to the company culture and is often treated more informally than traditional press releases, though a corporate blog often tries to accomplish similar goals as press releases do. In some corporate blogs, all posts go through a review before they are posted. Some corporate blogs, but not all, allow comments to be made to the posts. According to Hoffman Agency, corporate blogs should not be ‘about me’, but should be a platform to show thought leadership and communicate views on industry issues. Vivian Wagner, E-Commerce Times. \\"The Rise of Corporate Blogging.\\" Aug 3, 2012. Retrieved Jan 10, 2013. Roger Yu, USA TODAY. \\"More companies quit blogging, go with Facebook instead.\\" Apr 20, 2012. Retrieved Jan 10, 2013. External corporate blogs, by their very nature, are biased, though they can also offer a more honest and direct view than traditional communication channels. Nevertheless, they remain public relations tools. Corporate blogs may be written primarily for consumers (business-to- consumer) or primarily for other businesses (B2B). Certain corporate blogs have a very high number of subscribers. The official Google Blog is currently in the Technorati top 50 listing among all blogs worldwide. The number of subscribers, blog comments, links to blog posts, and the number of times a post is shared in other social media are indicators of a blog's popularity, potential influence, and reach. While business blogs targeted to consumer readers may have a high number of subscribers, comments, and other measures of engagement; corporate blogs targeted to other businesses, especially those in niche industries, may have a very limited number of subscribers, comments, links, and sharing via social media. Accordingly, other metrics are often evaluated to determine the success and effectiveness of B2B blogsDe Young, G. (April 20th, 2010) Meaningful Metrics for B2B Blogging. Marketers might expect to have product evangelists or influencers among the audience of an external blog. Once they find them, they may treat them like VIPs, asking them for feedback on exclusive previews, product testing, marketing plans, customer services audits, etc.Céré, J. (September 21st, 2005) Consumer Generated: from Mayhem to Marketing . The business blog can provide additional value by adding a level of credibility that is often unobtainable from a standard corporate site. The informality and increased timeliness of information posted to blogs assists with increasing transparency and accessibility in the corporate image. Business blogs can interact with a target market on a more personal level while building link credibility that can ultimately be tied back to the corporate site.

It is a center of furniture production. Meda is served by Meda railway station. History Meda's history is linked to the history of its convent and of its foundation. From the latter's location on a mound () stems the town's name. According to legend, the Saints Aimo and Vermund, counts of Turbigo, were attacked by two wild boars while hunting. To save their lives, they swore to God that, if saved, they would build a convent right there. The convent was built around 780 near an old little church dedicated to St. Vittore. In order to be free from the control of the new priorate, the people of Meda built another church dedicated to St. Mary and St. Sebastian. The quarrels between the inhabitants and the convent ended on 10 December 1252, when the Prioress Maria da Besozzo gave up all her political, administrative and economic power on the village. Later the municipal territory was held by the Visconti and Sforza families until, in the 16th century, it fell under the control of Spain and then of Napoleon. Meda later came under the power of the House of Habsburg and then, after the Second War of Italian Independence, became part of the Kingdom of Italy. The Meda territory, on the border with the town of Seveso, was the location of the ICMESA factory, which became known in 1976 for the release of a dioxin cloud, which affected many towns of the Brianza. This event is known as the “Seveso disaster” (Disastro di Seveso). Meda received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on 4 September 1998.

Although the Emmanuel parish dates from 1803, the cornerstone of the current native sandstone building was laid in 1849 and completed in 1851. The church contains original Tiffany stained-glass windows from three different periods and a scale model of Fort Cumberland. The grounds are part of the Fort Cumberland Walking Trail, signposted with plaques and detailed in a leaflet available from the visitor center. Standing at the eastern end of the Washington Street Historic District, it is one of Maryland's examples of early Gothic Revival architecture. The church is on the former site of Fort Cumberland, and earthwork tunnels remaining from the fort run under the church. The church was constructed around 1850 and designed by Philadelphia architect John Notman. It is modeled after St. Paul's Church in Brighton, England. The design is typical ecclesiastical architecture of the second quarter of the 19th century, especially that of the Episcopal Church. Emmanuel Episcopal Church and the First Presbyterian Church on an old postcard The Cumberland Parish House was built in 1903 and designed by Cumberland native Bruce Price. Price chose elements of the popular Second Empire style for the Parish House, an eclectic style based loosely on French architecture during the reign of Napoleon. The Parish house features elements typical of this style, such as a projecting pavilion, tall windows and roof, and deep architectural details. Many other houses of the Washington Street Historic District resemble the Parish House, but also feature a mansard roof, this style's central characteristic. The church and parish house sit on land that was originally Fort Cumberland, which served as a frontier outpost during the French and Indian War. The only building to remain from the fort is the small cabin that was used by George Washington as his headquarters when he was in the Cumberland area with his Virginia troops. It has been moved to nearby Riverside Park. Emmanuel Episcopal Church and Parish House are at 16 Washington Street and are contributing buildings to the Washington Street Historic District. Church services are open to the public, and the tunnels are open for tours during the Heritage Days festival in June.

CK1 isoforms are involved in Wnt signaling, circadian rhythms, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of transcription factors, DNA repair, and DNA transcription. Discovery By the early 1950s it was known from metabolic labeling studies using radioactive phosphate that phosphate groups attached to phosphoproteins inside cells can sometimes undergo rapid exchange of new phosphate for old. In order to perform experiments that would allow isolation and characterization of the enzymes involved in attaching and removing phosphate from proteins, there was a need for convenient substrates for protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Casein has been used as a substrate since the earliest days of research on protein phosphorylation. By the late 1960s, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase had been purified, and most attention was centered on kinases and phosphatases that could regulate the activity of important enzymes. Casein kinase activity associated with the endoplasmic reticulum of mammary glands was first characterized in 1974, and its activity was shown to not depend on cyclic AMP. CK1 family The CK1 family of monomeric serine–threonine protein kinases is found in eukaryotic organisms from yeast to humans. Mammals have seven family members (sometimes referred to as isoforms, but encoded by distinct genes): alpha, beta 1, gamma 1, gamma 2, gamma 3, delta, and epsilon. Isoforms range from 22 to 55 kDa and have been identified in the membranes, nucleus, and cytoplasm of eukaryotes and additionally in the mitotic spindle in mammalian cells. The family members have the highest homology in their kinase domains (53%–98% identical) and differ from most other protein kinases by the presence of the sequence S-I-N instead of A-P-E in kinase domain VIII. The family members appear to have similar substrate specificity in vitro, and substrate selection is thought to be regulated in vivo via subcellular localization and docking sites in specific substrates. One consensus phosphorylation site is S/Tp-X-X-S/T, where S/Tp refers to a phospho-serine or phospho-threonine, X refers to any amino acid, and the underlined residues refer to the target site. Thus, this CKI consensus site requires priming by another kinase. CKI also phosphorylates a related unprimed site, which optimally contains a cluster of acidic amino acids N-terminal to the target S/T including an acidic residue at n − 3 and a hydrophobic region C-terminal to the target S/T. A single acidic residue in the n − 3 position is not sufficient for CKI phosphorylation. In contrast, in several important targets, NF-AT and beta-catenin, CKI does not require n − 3 priming but, instead, phosphorylates the first serine in the sequence S-L-S, which is followed by a cluster of acidic residues, albeit less efficiently than the optimal sites. Roles Casein kinase activity was found to be present in most cell types and to be associated with multiple enzymes. The type 1 casein kinase family of related gene products are now given designations such as \\"casein kinase 1 alpha\\" and \\"casein kinase 1 epsilon\\". =Wnt signaling pathway= Casein kinase 1 epsilon has been suggested to play a role in phosphorylation of Disheveled in the Wnt signaling pathway. Casein kinase 1 alpha (CK1α) binds to and phosphorylates β‑catenin In plants the phosphorylation of protein Jade-1 is regulated by casein kinase 1. In humans there are three casein kinase 1 gamma enzymes. Xenopus casein kinase 1 gamma (CK1gamma) is associated with the cell membrane and binds to LRP. CK1gamma was found to be needed for Wnt signaling through LRP, and is both necessary and sufficient to transduce LRP6 signaling in vertebrates and Drosophila cells. Wnt binding to LRP causes a rapid increase in phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of LRP by CK1gamma. Phosphorylation of LRP6 by CK1gamma promotes binding of axin to LRP and activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. = Circadian rhythm = CK1ε and CK1δ are essential in the genetic transcription-translation (and post-translation) feedback loops that generate circadian rhythm in mammals. The previously-characterized CK1ε isoform was first implicated as a clock gene when its Drosophila homolog, double-time (Doubletime (gene)), was discovered in 1998. Double-time is 86% identical to human CK1ε. Kloss et al and Price et al showed that mutations in double-time altered circadian rhythm. They found two DBT mutants that had abnormal free- running periods and one that was pupal-lethal but resulted in accumulations of hypophosphorylated PER protein. Since then, double-time's protein product DBT has been well characterized for its role in phosphorylating PER, the protein product of clock gene period in Drosophila, and its mammalian homologs appear to play a similar role.  Interactions  DBT has been shown to physically interact with PER in vitro and in vivo, and to create a stable complex with PER throughout the circadian cycle. PER that has been phosphorylated by DBT is recognized by the Slimb protein. Slimb is a component of the Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, which marks proteins for proteosomal degradation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Enhanced PER degradation in the cytoplasm is predicted to delay nuclear translocation of both PER and TIM, and to thus affect the period of circadian rhythms. The mutation dbtS, associated with a proline to serine substitution at residue 47 [P47S], shortens period length by about 6 h. dbtL contains an amino acid substitution of isoleucine for methionine at residue 80 (M80I) and lengthens period to 29 h. A third mutation, dbtAR, is associated with a change from histidine 126 to tyrosine and causes arrhythmia. PER protein in this mutant is hypophosphorylated. Each of these mutations maps to the kinase domain of DBT gene. The short- and long-period alleles of DBT enhance or attenuate, respectively, PER degradation in the nucleus, further demonstrating the importance of timely PER degradation as a critical determinant in establishing 24-h rhythmicity. In addition to influencing protein degradation, DBT affects the timing of nuclear accumulation of PER. The short-period mutant dbtS delays PER nuclear accumulation, which is independent of PER protein stability, and arrhythmic alleles of dbt cause nuclear accumulation of PER in clock-containing cells of larval and adult Drosophila. Both mammalian CK1δ and CK1ε contain closely related 123-amino-acid carboxy-terminal domains that can auto-regulate kinase activity. CK1δ and CK1ε are 53% identical. These domains are not related to the carboxy-terminal domain of double-time, suggesting a split in the evolution of the mammalian and fly homologs. A similar function for casein kinase 2 has been reported in Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila, and Neurospora.  Positive and negative feedback  In the negative feedback loops, CK1ε periodically binds to and phosphorylates the PER proteins (PER1, PER2, and PER3), which form heterodimers with each other and interact with CRY1 and CRY2. The effects of phosphorylation are two-fold. It has been shown in Drosophila that phosphorylation of the PER proteins increase their ubiquitination, which leads to degradation. Phosphorylation of the PER proteins also leaves them unable to enter the nucleus, where they suppress transcription of clock genes. The blocking of nuclear translocation occurs via phosphorylation of PER at the nuclear localization signal, which masks the signal and prevents nuclear entry. However, this CK1ε-mediated constraint to the cytoplasm can be overcome when the PER protein complex is bound to CRY. CK1ε has been shown to phosphorylate CRY when both CK1ε and CRY are complexed with PER in vitro, but the functional significance of this remains undetermined. CK1ε may also have a role in positive feedback; the transcription factor BMAL1 is a CK1ε substrate in vitro, and increased CK1ε activity has been shown to positively regulate transcription of genes under the influence of BMAL1-dependent circadian gene promoters. This has not yet been studied in vivo.  Significance in disease  CK1δ and CK1ε have been shown to be relevant in human disease. Recent findings indicate that pharmaceutical inhibition of CK1 may be a promising therapeutic for aberrant circadian rhythm. Mutations and variants of the CK1ε phosphorylation site of PER2 are associated with cases of Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS). Similarly, length variations in the CK1ε phosphorylation site of PER3 have been found to correlate with morningness and eveningness; longer alleles are associated with early risers while shorter alleles are associated with late risers. Additionally, 75% of patients with Delayed sleep phase syndrome are homozygous for the shorter allele. Mutations in CK1 have been shown to alter circadian behavior in other mammals, as well. In 1988, the golden hamster tau mutant, which has a freerunning period of 22hrs, was the first mammalian circadian mutant discovered. Twelve years later in 2000, the tau mutation was mapped to CK1ε. Since its discovery, the tau mutant has proven to be a valuable research tool in circadian biology. CK1ɛtau, a T178C substitution, is a gain-of function mutation that causes an increase in degradation of PER, but not CRY. This creates a disruption in the PER- regulated feedback loop and consequently an acceleration of molecular oscillations. Homozygous mutants (CK1ε(tau/tau)) show a significant decrease in period, both in vivo (behaviorally) and in vitro (measured by firing rates of the suprachiasmatic nucleus). Recent research has also identified a link between mutations in the CK1δ gene and familial migraine and advanced sleep phase, a finding that was replicated in mice migraine models.  Roles of isoforms  CK1δ and CK1ε were thought to be generally redundant in circadian cycle length and protein stability. Recent research, however, has shown that CK1δ deficiency lengthens circadian period while CK1ε deficiency does not. Also, CK1α has recently been suggested to play a role redundant to CK1δ in phosphorylating PER1 although this is not consistent with other data = Nucleo-cytoplasmic regulation of transcription factors = CKIα or CKIδ is essential in modulating the nuclear export of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6), a protein with essential nuclear and cytoplasmic roles in biogenesis of the 60S subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome. Phosphorylation of Ser-174 and Ser-175 by CKI promotes nuclear export of eIF6 while dephosphorylation by calcineurin promotes nuclear accumulation of eIF6. It is unclear whether the same mechanism is responsible for eIF6 cycling in yeast and if other kinases also play roles in these processes. CKI homologs are also implicated in cytoplasmic shuttling of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) through observation that the transcription factor Crz1p is phosphorylated by a CKI homolog in yeast. = Interphase, mitosis and DNA repair = CKIδ activity is implicated in mitosis and in response to DNA damage. During interphase, CKIδ associates with the Golgi Apparatus and appears to regulate the budding of clathrin coated vesicles from the TGN; it also appears to associate with tubulin. While undamaged mitotic cells shows no CKIδ association with tubulin, the kinase was recruited during mitosis in cells with DNA damage, indicative of a role for CKIδ in arranging the microtubule network during mitosis. The mechanisms for these biochemical interactions remain unknown.

The complete play was first performed outside in the playing field at Cupar, Fife in June 1552 during the Midsummer holiday, where the action took place under Castle Hill. It was subsequently performed in Edinburgh, also outdoors, in 1554. The full text was first printed in 1602 and extracts were copied into the Bannatyne Manuscript. The Satire is an attack on the Three Estates represented in the Parliament of Scotland – the clergy, lords and burgh representatives, symbolised by the characters Spiritualitie, Temporalitie and Merchant. The clergy come in for the strongest criticism. The work portrays the social tensions present at this pivotal moment in Scottish history. Synopsis A complete version of the play was printed by Robert Charteris as, Ane (Pleasant) Satyre of the Thrie Estaits, in Commendation of Vertew and Vituperation of Vyce, Edinburgh (1602).\\"Pleasant\\" appears in the title on the first page of the play, not on the title-page of Charteris's (1602) edition. In the first part there are 27 different characters. In the second part seven more are added. The key characters are; King Humanity, Divine Correction, Sensuality, Spirituality, Temporality, Gude Counsel and Chastity. The play opens with Diligence delivering a sermon on good kingship. The main character, young King Humanity, then appears and is at first led astray by Sensuality and the Vices. His false counsellors introduce him to a mistress, Sensuality, which is the starting point of his disconnection from the moral way of life. He is then fooled by three disguised liars. Gude Counsel is sent to prison by the liars who already have taken control of King Humanitie's mind. With the beginning of his lecherous new life the king forgets about the moral virtues and can no longer judge properly. He consigns Charity and Verity to the stocks. In the course of the following scenes the audience sees how the three so called Vices (Discretion, Devotion and Sapience) try to get rid of everything and everyone who could be dangerous to them. For instance Lady Chastitie, who is homeless since the church in Scotland is not as it was meant to be, begs for shelter from Spiritualitie, Temporalitie and finally the People but is rejected in each case. In the end when Lady Chastitie is sent to prison by the Vices, Divine Correction enters the stage. This is the moment when the vices know that their time has come to an end and they flee and take away the king’s treasure box. Correction frees Gude Counsel, Chastitie and Vertie. He advises the young king to call a parliament and gives him advice regarding a successful reign. The second part starts with an interruption. A member of the King's realm, known only as The Poor Man, emerges from the audience, establishes an alliance with John Commonweal to demand reform, and Diligence reappears to announce that the King will seek to improve his realm. Afterwards the Pardoner enters the scene and tries to sell pardoners. Poor Man hears that and buys pardoners worth ‘ane groat’. But Poor Man is not satisfied and gets angry and so they start to argue. In the following scene Diligence opens parliament and King Humanitie, Correction, the king’s courtiers and the virtues enter. The three estates greet the king and parliament is opened. John Commonweal stands up and talks to the King and Correction. He reveals all the failures of the estates. In the course of the following hearing Temporalitie gets punished but as this estate wants to cooperate this is just a short episode. Spiritualitie does not agree on what is said about their estate and fights back. But there are too many accusations against this estate and therefore they also have to give in. The three Vices are imprisoned and sentenced to be hanged. Flatterie tried to get away by betraying his fellows Falsehood and Deceit but this did not work. In the end of the second part the three vices Deceit, Falsehood and Flatterie are allowed to say something before they are hanged. After the execution of the vices and a rousing speech by Folie, Diligence closes the play and advises the audience to go their ways and enjoy their time.Edington, Carol, Court & Culture in Renaissance Scotland, pp.221-224 Sixteenth century performances =Interlude at Linlithgow, 1540= The 1540 interlude was performed in the hall of Linlithgow Palace The 1931 edition of Lindsay's works by Douglas Hamer hypothesized different forms of the play.Hamer, Douglas, Works of Sir David Lindsay of the Mount, vol.2, Scottish Text Society (1931-4), pp.1-8 The critic John MacQueen proposed the play might have composed by Lindsay as early as 1532 for the court of the young James V of Scotland.MacQueen, Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis, SSL(1965-6), 129-43.

As the play turned on the Reformation of the church, Eure obtained a more detailed description from a Scottish contact who saw the play at Linlithgow, and enclosed in his letter the synopsis written by his spy .Ellis, ed., Original Letters relative to British History, series 3 vol.3 (1846), pp.279-285 This description corresponds with the expanded later text of Lindsay's play. A king was shown with his courtiers, Placebo, Picthanke, and Flatterye. A Poor Man made his complaint, and was answered by a Burgess, a Man at Arms and a Bishop, who represented the three estates of the Parliament of Scotland. The Poor Man mentioned the real events of James V executing both John Armstrong (of Staplegordon; in ballads the Laird o'Gilnockie), hanged in July 1530, and 'Sym the Laird,' who was hanged in February 1536.Cameron, Jamie, James V, (1998), pp.77-83 The role of the poor man was described in the spy's synopsis; > \\"After them come a poor Man, who did go up and down the scaffald, making a > heavy complaint that he was harried (chased) through the Courtier's place, > where through he hade strayled (lost) his house, his wife and children > beggyng thair bread, and so of many thousand in Scotland, whiche would make > the Kyng's Grace lose of men if his Grace stod neide (required), saying > there was no remedy to be gotten, for though he would suite to the King's > Grace, he was neither acquainted with Controller nor Treasurer, and without > them might no man get no goodness of the King.

The play at Linlithgow had shown the 'naughtiness' of the church. Bellenden said after the play the King spoke to the churchmen in the audience asking them to reform their factions and manner of living, otherwise he would send six of them into England to his uncle, Henry VIII.Pinkerton, John, The History Of Scotland From The Accession Of The House Of Stuart To That Of Mary, vol.2, (1791), pp.494-497 =The Cupar Banns, 1552= The performance at Cupar on 7 June 1552 was heralded by a short piece called the Cupar Banns announcing the play, presumably also written by Lindsay.David Lyndsay's Cupar Banns in, John Pinkerton, Scottish Poems Reprinted From Scarce Editions, vol.2 (1792) This has three sections of comic drama as a foretaste of the Satire; the Cotter and his wife, Bessy and the Auld Man, and Fynlaw of the Foot Band, introduced by the 'Nuncius' and linked by the Fool. The characters of the three parts are supposed to be members of the Satire's audience. The Banns with some stage directions are found only in the Bannatyne Manuscript.Newlyn, Evelyn S., 'Traditions of Myth in The Cupar Banns', in, The European Sun, Tuckwell (1993), pp.355-367 =Edinburgh, 1554, and the Charteris synopsis= Some preparations for the Edinburgh performance on Sunday 14 August 1554 were made by the Burgh Council. William MacDowall with six carpenters built a stage of boards, a seat for Mary of Guise and the French ambassador Henri Cleutin, and a 'Convoy House', at the Greenside playfield, with the gallows, 'jebbettis,' used in the final scene.Van Heijnsbergen, Theo, 'Literature in Queen Mary's Edinburgh: the Bannatyne Manuscript', in, The Renaissance in Scotland, Brill (1994), p.206 The town council paid the wages of 12 minstrels, and after the play treated the actors to dinner.Adam, Robert, ed., Edinburgh Records: The Burgh Accounts, vol.1 (1899), p.110: Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol.10 (1913), p.232:Marwick, ed., Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1528-1557, (1871), entries from 1554 via British History Online, (The other play event mentioned on 15 June 1554 was the entry of Guise as Regent) The printer Henry Charteris mentioned the Edinburgh performance in his introduction to Lindsay's Warkis (1568), saying how the clergy were surprised by the play and considered taking revenge. Charteris gave this summary of the Satire; > \\"In the play, playit beside Edinburgh, in the presence of the Quene Regent, > and ane greit part of the nobilitie, with ane exceeding greit nowmber of > pepill. lestand fra 9 houris afoir none till 6 houris at evin, quhair, > amangis mony baith grave materis and merie trickis, he brocht in ane > Bischop, ane Persone (Parson), ane Freir, and ane Nun, deckit up in their > papisticall ornamentis and maner of raiment.

This production opened on 16 August 1996 and starred Sylvester McCoy. The play was quoted at the opening of the new Scottish Parliament, a mark illustrating its importance to modern Scots. A new performance at Linlithgow Palace and Stirling Castle based on the story of the 1540 interlude took place in 2013 using a cast drawn from stage and screen. In Linlithgow an open-air stage was erected on the Peel looking out across the loch for the performance.Scotsman Newspaper: Plans for 40-player presentation of the Satire at Linlithgow Peel, 2013 Language The Satire is notable for being one of the earliest recorded instances of fuck, predating any English language forms but preceded in the Scots language by the makar William Dunbar (Oxford English Dictionary entry.)

The shape avoids stress concentrations which could break the bone. The hole on the underside is for attaching bait.Object: Matau (fish hook) Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Retrieved 8 September 2016. A circle hook is a type of fish hook which is sharply curved back in a circular shape. It has become widely used among anglers in recent years because the hook generally catches more fish and is rarely swallowed.Prince ED, Ortiz M and Venizelos A (2002) \\"A comparison of circle hook and\\" J\\" hook performance in recreational catch-and-release fisheries for billfish\\" American Fisheries Society Symposium 30: 66–79. Since the circle hook catches the fish on the lips at the corner of its mouth, it usually decreases the mortality rates of released fish as compared to J-hook (like O'Shaughnessy or Octopus hooks) which are often swallowed by the fish, causing damage to the gills or vital organs.Cooke SJ and Suski CD (2004) \\"Are circle hooks an effective tool for conserving marine and freshwater recreational catch-and-release fisheries?\\" Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems, 14: 299–326. The circle hook's shape allows it to only hook onto an exposed surface, which in the case of a fish means the corner of its mouth. The fish takes the baited hook and swallows it, and as the hook is reeled in, it is safely pulled out of the fish until it reaches the mouth. At this point it will catch the corner of the mouth, resulting in fewer gut-hooked fish. It is important to not strike (or set the hook) when the fish bites, but rather just reel in. The act of striking while using a circle hook often results in the hook being pulled out of the fish altogether. Studies have shown that circle hooks do less damage to billfish than the traditional J-hooks, yet they are at just as effective for catching billfish. This is good for conservation, since it improves survival rates after release.Prince ED, Ortiz M, and Venizelos A (2002) \\"A Comparison of Circle Hook and “J” Hook Performance in Recreational Catch-and-Release Fisheries for Billfish\\" American Fisheries Society Symposium 30, pp. xxx–xxx.

From the summer of 1989–90 until 2001–02, and again since 2010–11, the tournament was replaced by one of three other competitions: the original Australian Baseball League (ABL), the International Baseball League of Australia (IBLA), and since the 2010–11 season the new ABL. Despite other competitions being held in place of the Claxton Shield, the physical trophy has remained the award for the winning teams. Though city- based teams have competed for the Claxton Shield in some seasons, the name engraved on the shield is that of the winning state; for the 2010–11 ABL season won by the Perth Heat, \\"West Australia 2011\\" was engraved. The Victoria Aces were the last team to win the shield under the Claxton Shield format, having won the 2010 tournament by defeating South Australia two games to nil in the final series. It was the eighteenth time the Aces had won the shield, and the twenty-second time it had been won by a Victorian team—the most by any state—including three times by the Waverley / Melbourne Reds and once by the Melbourne Monarchs. The Melbourne Aces currently hold the shield after overcoming the Adelaide Giants in the 2019–20 Australian Baseball League season. It was the Melbourne Aces first ABL title and twenty-third time a Victorian team has won the Claxton Shield.  History  There had been interstate baseball tournaments held prior to the start of the Claxton Shield. Prior to the federation of Australia, an inter-colonial series was held in Melbourne in 1890 between Victoria and South Australia at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground. South Australia were the eventual winners of the series, winning two games to one. New South Wales and Victoria started holding an annual series between themselves in 1900, that was only called off for a smallpox outbreak in 1913, but would not return until 1919 because of World War I. The first \\"national\\" tournament was held in Hobart in 1910, won by New South Wales defeating Victoria and hosts Tasmania. New South Wales repeated the feat in 1912 in Melbourne when they won again, this time with the addition of South Australia. None were held regularly though, and they did not always involve all baseball–playing states.Clark 2003, pp.41–53 = Establishment = In 1913 and in the wake of national tournaments having already been played, the Australian Baseball Council was formed by representatives of the state controlling bodies. Because of conflict between the north and south Tasmanian baseball community, they were not among the states on the council, which included New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. Further national tournaments were not organised though, until the efforts of Norrie Claxton in 1934. Claxton, who had played for South Australia in both cricket and baseball, and was a patron of the South Australia Baseball Association, donated a shield to be awarded to the winners of the annual carnival, with the intention of permanently awarding the shield to the first team to win three consecutive tournaments, and was named the Claxton Shield. The first tournament was held in 1934, with matches played at the Adelaide Oval and Hindmarsh Oval in Adelaide. The hosts South Australia won the tournament, and would go on to win the next two editions as well. At this point, all participating states agreed that it should be a perpetual shield awarded to the winner each year. In 1936, the Western Australia Baseball League applied to join the other states in competing for that year's tournament in Sydney. However their request came too late, as the arrangements had already been confirmed. A month after the tournament, Western Australia hosted Victoria in Perth for a three-game series as a form of preparation for their entry in the 1937 tournament in Adelaide. In a repeat of circumstances, the Queensland Baseball Association applied to send a team to the 1937 tournament, but as had been the case with Western Australia their application was too late. Queensland would make their Claxton Shield debut in the 1939 tournament in Melbourne. = Post WWII = The early part of the decade was interrupted by World War II, however the post war years provided many new players to the competition and brought Australian baseball to new heights. The Victoria Aces began their rise to the dominance of Claxton Shield by achieving their first hat-trick of titles between 1947 and 1949. In 1950, the Claxton Shield was restored to a national competition after the Queensland Rams returned to the competition after a four-year absence. It was a decade of close competition with each capital city holding at least one series during the decade. In 1952, Western Australia won their first title. The series in 1961 marked an expansion in the competition as all teams played each other twice that year. In 1962, the longstanding tradition of hosting the event in August was broken when host Adelaide scheduled the series in October, perhaps the first step in a long march to create the sport's eventual move in Australia to the summer season. Behind starting pitcher Neil Page, South Australian teams dominated the decade, winning six championships. The decade also marked the introduction of the Helm's Award, which is presented to the Claxton Shield's MVP every year.8 December 2008. 75 years of Claxton 75th Claxton Shield Tournament Program. pg 7 South Australia's decade may well have been the 1960s, but the 1970s belonged to Western Australia who captured a title in 1975 and a hattrick from 1977 to 1979 thanks to what was arguably one of the strongest Claxton squads of all time. The era saw a new dimension of Claxton Shield with corporate involvement and interstate rivalries becoming strong. It also saw the expansion of the competition to six teams, with the admittance of the Northern Territory between 1981 and 1988. After a 42-year drought, the Queensland Rams won their first national title in 1982 before capturing two others in 1983 and 1987. The 1980s saw the likes of such names as Tony Adamson, Dave Nilsson, Graeme Lloyd, Adrian Meagher and Phil Dale. New South Wales Patriots won the last championship in 1988 before the introduction of the Australian Baseball League. = Australian Baseball League = After the 1988 Claxton Shield and the Australian Baseball League was formed to take over from the traditional Claxton Shield, the first game was between Perth Heat and Adelaide Giants at Parry Field in Perth 27 October 1989 with the Giants winning 8–5. The league ran for 10 seasons before being bought out by Dave Nilsson and his company Nilcorp due to the declining financial state of the league. = International Baseball League of Australia = In late 1999 Australian baseball player David Nilsson purchased the rights to the Australian Baseball League for A$5,000,000. Nilsson, who with Glenn Partridge had the vision of creating the International Baseball League of Australia, ran the next 3 Claxton Shields each using a different format. The first format used was the most similar to the former Australian Baseball League, 6 teams divided into 2 divisions, southern and northern division playing home and away games with a total of 17 games, followed by a best of 3 division championship with the winner of each division meeting in the best of 3 championship series to decide the Claxton Shield champion and IBLA champion. The second format was a four-team competition played exclusively on the Gold Coast at Palm Meadows Baseball Stadium. Teams involved in this championship were 3 composite teams; IBLA Australia, IBLA Internationals, MLB All-Stars and the 4th team was the Taiwanese national team. A cut-throat finals system was used in this championship with a 3rd place play-off. The third and final format was run jointly with the Australian Baseball Federation, The championship was held in Melbourne at the Melbourne Ballpark and used a more traditional Claxton Shield format, 6 teams over 1 week playing each other once again using a cut-throat finals system. = Return to Claxton Shield = The \\"State vs State\\" format of Claxton Shield returned in 2002 during the IBLA season. It then truly became the top tier baseball competition in Australia again in 2003 when the IBLA folded. The decade has brought close to a hundred young Australians playing baseball in Major League Baseball and Japan, most of who return home to showcase their talents to local fans. The 2004 Olympic Games signalled a coming of age for Australian baseball when the Australian national baseball team won silver medals. More recently, the 2008 series saw the return of a \\"home & away\\" format so that the game can be showcased nationwide.8 December 2008. 75 years of Claxton 75th Claxton Shield Tournament Program. pg 8  Season structure  The Claxton Shield has followed numerous formats over the years. The original format saw a round-robin tournament used, with each of the three participating teams playing each other once over the course of a week. The tournament would be hosted in a single city, though in some cases multiple grounds were used for individual games, the team with the most wins being declared the winner. With the expansion to four teams in 1937, the addition of a final was made, with the top two teams playing in a championship game. Though there were many variations in the fine details from year to year, particularly when a team was added or removed from the competition, the basic concept of a round-robin followed by a final was continued through to the final Claxton Shield before the start of the Australian Baseball League in 1988. When the International Baseball League of Australia collapsed and the Claxton Shield resumed in its own right in 2003, the original format was continued. The 2008 Claxton Shield saw a new format for the tournament. A home and away season was introduced, splitting the six participating teams into two divisions of three teams each. The teams played within their own divisions, meeting both other teams twice for a three-game series: one series at home, one away. The division leaders then met in a best of three final series for the championship. 2009 marked the 75th anniversary of the inaugural Claxton Shield, and so a mix of old and new was used. A showcase round was held in Sydney, where each team met each other team once. After this, each team met each other once again for a three-game series on a home and away basis, much the same as the previous season. The finals series was expanded to allow three teams to reach the playoffs. The second and third placed teams met in a best of three series, the winner of which met the first placed team. The 2010 season eliminated the showcase round, and used a double round-robin format: each team met each other team twice—once at home, once away—each time for a three-game series, resulting in each team playing 24 games over ten rounds before the finals series, the most for any Claxton Shield season. The three team playoff structure was kept. This season structure was seen as a template for the relaunch of the Australian Baseball League the following season: the only likely changes being the expansion to six teams meaning no bye rounds for any teams, and the possible change from a three-game series each round to a four-game series.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on January 20, 1962, and stars Bugs Bunny. In the cartoon, Bugs finds himself at odds with Blacque Jacque Shellacque, a ruthless lumberjack with a French Canadian accent who wants to control the water supply by building a series of dams. The title is a pun on \\"hair/hare\\". Plot Bugs Bunny is taking his morning shower under a waterfall, singing \\"April Showers\\" (à lá Al Jolson) when the water stops flowing. He decides that beavers are responsible and, after a brief delirium that the supply has permanently dried up, climbs up the waterfall to the source of the problem. The source of the problem turns out to be the villainous Blacque Jacque Shellacque, who has built an illegal rock dam in an effort to control the water supply and sell it at inflated prices. Bugs demands for Jacque to explain what gives him the right to build the dam, and Jacque responds \\"Dees give me ze right!\\" as he sticks a revolver into Bugs' neck (this exchange is cut out of most commercial showings). Bugs next asks Jacque what would happen if certain rocks become loose, to which Jacque simply states he would replace them. Bugs then tricks Jacque into removing a tiny rock, at the dam's base, which then dislodges the dam. Later, Bugs resumes showering, but Jacque has built a replacement dam (\\"Won't that guy ever learn?\\" \\"Thees time I build heem stronger!\\"). Jacque expects another sabotage attempt from Bugs, and thinks he is still one step ahead of the rabbit when he spots what he believes to be a phony shark fin in the impounded water. The shark is real, however, and threatens Jacques until Bugs \\"saves\\" him by crashing a log through the dam. (\\"Thees is being saved?\\") Still later, Bugs has resumed showering again, but Jacque has built an even bigger replacement dam, and gloats at Bugs from above. Unintimidated, Bugs turns to the audience and quotes Red Skelton's \\"mean widdle kid\\": \\"He don't know me vewy well, do he?\\" (just like in Hare Trigger). Bugs then sends a single lighted stick of dynamite on a miniature raft towards the new Shellacque-built dam, but as Jacque tends to it (or vice versa, as the dynamite blows up in Jacque's face off-screen), he also immediately notices a huge raft full of lighted dynamite subsequently headed toward the dam and they explode and demolish it. Finally fed up with Bugs, Jacque fires his rifle into the waterfall not knowing Bugs is not there, thinking he has killed off his nemesis once and for all (\\"So much for crazee seek rahbeet! Bah!\\"). Nearby, Bugs - at his carrot garden - sees that his record player has been destroyed by Jacque's gunfire. Although mad at first, Bugs calmly declares his famous line: \\"Of course you know, this means war.\\" Later, a triumphant Jacque boasts about his new steel dam, but quickly finds out that his water supply has been cut off. Bugs, it turns out, has turned the tables and built a dam of his own, in revenge for the aforementioned shooting of the record player. Declaring this as the last straw, an angry Jacque retrieves a cannon and blows the dam apart, only to find another rabbit-built dam. Jacque blows that one up as well, only to find more dams to destroy. Finally, Jacque reaches the \\"Grand Cooler Dam\\" (a pun on \\"Grand Coulee Dam\\", although the dam looks more like Hoover Dam). Jacque tries to blow that dam up as well, but his attempt fails (the cannonball bounces off of the face of the dam and back into the muzzle of the cannon) and he is launched into a police paddy wagon instead and hauled away for attempting to destroy the Cooler Dam. \\"He's not foolin' mehe'll be back...\\" says Bugs as he watches his nemesis being taken away. \\"Like, uh, in about 20 years?\\" References External links * Wet Hare at the Internet Movie Database * Wet Hare at the Big Cartoon DataBase 1962 films 1962 animated films 1962 short films 1960s American animated films 1960s animated short films Looney Tunes shorts American films Films directed by Robert McKimson Films scored by Milt Franklyn Films featuring Bugs Bunny ","title":"Wet Hare"},{"id":"5785631","text":"Ramai Pandit ( Ramai Ponđit) or Ramai the Wise was a medieval Bengali poet from the region of Bengal.

Routes from the port connect to the North Atlantic through the Hudson Strait. , the port had four deep-sea berths capable of handling Panamax-size vessels for the loading and unloading of grain, bulk commodities, general cargo, and tanker vessels. The port is connected to the Hudson Bay Railway, which shares the same parent company, and cargo connections are made with the Canadian National Railway system at HBR's southern terminus in The Pas. It is the only port of its size and scope in Canada that does not connect directly to the country's road system; all goods shipped overland to and from the port must travel by rail. The port was built by the Government of Canada and remained under federal government ownership until its sale in 1997 to the American company OmniTRAX. In December 2015, OmniTRAX announced it was negotiating a sale of the port, and the associated Hudson Bay Railway, to a group of First Nations based in northern Manitoba. With no sale finalized by July 2016, OmniTRAX shut down the port and major railroad freight operations along the HBR in August 2016. The railway continued to carry cargo to supply the town of Churchill itself until the line was damaged by flooding on May 23, 2017. The Port and the Hudson Bay Railway were sold to Arctic Gateway Group — a consortium of First Nations, local governments, and corporate investors — in 2018. On July 9, 2019, ships on missions to resupply arctic communities began stopping at the port for additional cargo, and the port began shipping grain again on September 7, 2019.  History  The port was built in the late 1920s and began exporting grain shipments in 1931, following a six-year project to build the railway to connect Hudson Bay to other points in Canada for use in shipping. The first ship to import cargo through the port was the British freighter Pennyworth in 1932. As this Arch Dale cartoon shows, the notion that Churchill could be a port was originally the subject of mockery. The port and all freight railway service to the port was shut down in August 2016 following the Government of Canada's ending of the Wheat Board monopoly, which subsequently allowed Canadian farmers to sell grain to all market participants, and shippers were free to ship via lower-cost non-Arctic ports and transport routes. After purchasing the port and related infrastructure in 2018, the Arctic Gateway Group repaired the rail line before winter set in, lowering the cost of goods in Churchill. On September 7, 2019, the Arctic Gateway Group announced that it had successfully completed the loading of its first grain ship since operations were ceased in 2016.  Port operations  The port is iced in for much of the year and is accessible only between late July and early November. For example, in 2010 the shipping season was July 28 to November 2. Shallow waters also restrict its development as an ocean port. Despite these restrictions the port remains useful for shipping grain and other bulk cargos because shipping by rail costs several times as much, per ton, as shipping by sea. The port is a compulsory pilotage area.port of churchill: port operations Pilotage is provided by the Great Lakes Pilotage Authority, a Crown corporation of the Government of Canada which includes responsibility for pilotage on the Hudson Bay coast of the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba.Great Lakes Pilotage Authority - About GLPA Pilotage charges between July 20 and October 31 follow a published schedule; outside these dates charges are based on cost recovery.Great Lakes Pilotage Tariff Regulations (SOR/84-253), SCHEDULE III: PILOTAGE CHARGES FOR THE PORT OF CHURCHILL, MANITOBA From 1931 to 2016, the port typically was used for outgoing shipments of grain, usually from the Canadian Wheat Board.Winnipeg Free Press Since 2007, port activity diversified somewhat and increased in line with growth in Arctic mining operations in Nunavut and an expansion in supply ship reloading. In September 2007 the port handled its first domestic export trade, shipping 12,500 tonnes of wheat to Halifax aboard the Arctic supply ship Kathryn Spirit. On October 18, 2007 the port received its first import trade in seven years and the first ever from Russia, a shipment of fertilizer purchased by Farmers of North America. The shipment is supposed to be the beginning of an Arctic Bridge that would link Churchill with the Russian port of Murmansk. The port was almost entirely reliant on grain from the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) for its viability. Wheat accounted for 90 per cent of all traffic through the port. According to a November 6, 2008 press release, the CWB shipped 424,000 tons of western Canadian wheat through the port of Churchill during the 2008 shipping season. The first wheat left port on August 8, and the last of 15 freighters left on October 20. Exporting prairie wheat through Churchill saves Canadian farmers money on transportation in terms of rail-freight costs and avoiding Saint Lawrence Seaway charges, but the operating profits to the private company operating the port were highly dependent on the monopoly rates and rules implemented by the CWB. The CWB incentivized shipments via the port through the use of its Churchill Storage Program which paid farmers to retain grain on-farm for later movement through the port. Because the Churchill shipping season begins before the new wheat crop is harvested each summer, the Storage Program helped ensure adequate volumes of grain are available for export by bringing in grain saved from the year before. The port of Churchill exported of grain in 1977, 621,000 tonnes in 2007, and 529,000 tonnes in 2009. Shipments continued to decline, falling to in 2012 and plummeting to in 2015.http://www.fcc- fac.ca/newsletters/en/express/articles/20121221_e.asp#story_3 Port operations ceased in August 2016. The CWB was sold off to Saudi Company, G3 Global Grain Group in 2015 and the Churchill Port suffered as grain shipments were slowly ceased. Omnitrax then closed the rail-line and port, citing profitability of the operations. It then entered into initial talks to sell the port and rail- line to a local indigenous consortium of Manitoba First Nations, Missnippi Rail Consortium. Under the new ownership of the Arctic Gateway Group, the port completed the loading of its first grain ship on September 7, 2019. It was announced on September 16 that the port has begun loading a second ship. =Alternatives to grain= The government of Manitoba proposed in 2010 that the Port of Churchill could serve as the North American terminus of an Arctic Bridge shipping service to Murmansk in Northern Russia. Containers from inland China and central Asia could potentially be transported to Murmansk by Russian railways, shipped to Churchill then transported south by rail to major destinations in North America, avoiding existing transport bottlenecks. In 2010, investments to upgrade the port to \\"facilitating export options and the flow of two-way trade with other Northern ports\\" were made, as described in the Statement on Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy: Exercising : Sovereignty and Promoting Canada's Northern Strategy Abroad which is launched on August 20, 2010. Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil exporter, and the Port of Churchill has an oil-handling system. The port's owner has proposed a $2 million upgrade to this system, which would give additional competitive advantage to Canada's oil export industry. On July 9, 2019, the port began supplying cargo to ships on their way to resupply northern communities.  Marketing efforts The Churchill Gateway Development Corporation was created in 2003 to market the port and diversify its traffic base. The port's official web site (www.PortOfChurchill.ca) contained promotional information until September 2018, when this content was taken offline.

It is also known as the silver king. It is found in the Atlantic Ocean, typically in tropical and subtropical regions, though it has been reported as far north as Nova Scotia and the Atlantic coast of southern France, and as far south as Argentina. As with all Elopiformes, it spawns at sea. Its diet includes small fish and crustaceans. It has been recorded at up to in length and weighing up to . A tarpon is capable of filling its swim bladder with air, like a primitive lung. This gives it a predatory advantage when oxygen levels in the water are low. In appearance, it is greenish or bluish on top and silver on the sides. The large mouth is turned upwards and the lower jaw contains an elongated, bony plate. The last ray of the dorsal fin is much longer than the others, reaching nearly to the tail. The tarpon is the official state saltwater fish of Alabama. It is poorly received as food, but valued as a game fish. The tarpon has a reputation for great aerobatics and has been the subject of media attention, including the TV miniseries Chasing Silver, released in 2004. Game fishing Atlantic tarpon Tarpons are considered one of the great saltwater game fishes, not only because of their size and their accessible haunts, but also because of their fighting spirit when hooked; they are very strong, making spectacular leaps into the air. The flesh is undesirable, commonly described as being smelly and bony. In Florida and Alabama, a special permit is required to kill and keep a tarpon, so most tarpon fishing there is catch and release. Despite its name, the Atlantic tarpon is not limited to one body of water or exclusive to the East Coast. In their northern migration, they range through the Florida Keys and gradually make their way up the west coast of Florida and on to the Texas coast. The International Sábalo (tarpon) Fishing Tournament is held every May in Tecolutla on Mexico's Costa Esmeralda. Geographical distribution and migration Illustration of an Atlantic Tarpon. Since tarpons are not commercially valuable as a food fish, very little has been documented concerning their geographical distribution and migrations. They inhabit both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Their range in the eastern Atlantic has been reliably established from Senegal to the Congo. Tarpons inhabiting the western Atlantic are principally found to populate warmer coastal waters primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and the West Indies. Nonetheless, they are regularly caught by anglers at Cape Hatteras and as far as Nova Scotia, Bermuda, and south to Argentina. Scientific studies indicate schools have routinely migrated through the Panama Canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific and back for over 80 years. They have not been shown to breed in the Pacific Ocean, but anecdotal evidence by tarpon fishing guides and anglers indicates it is possible, as over the last 60 years, many small juveniles and some mature giants have been caught and documented, principally on the Pacific side of Panama at the Bayano River, in the Gulf of San Miguel and its tributaries, Coiba Island in the Gulf of Chiriquí, and at Piñas Bay in the Gulf of Panama. Since tarpons tolerate a wide range of salinity and are opportunistic feeders, their migrations are limited only by water temperatures. They prefer water temperatures of ; below they become inactive, and temperatures under can be lethal. A large non-migrant tarpon community is found in the Rio San Juan and Lake Nicaragua.

These problems were characterised in his speech as \\"unattackable at the present state of mathematics\\" and are now known as Landau's problems. They are as follows: # Goldbach's conjecture: Can every even integer greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes? # Twin prime conjecture: Are there infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is prime? # Legendre's conjecture: Does there always exist at least one prime between consecutive perfect squares? # Are there infinitely many primes p such that p − 1 is a perfect square? In other words: Are there infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1? , all four problems are unresolved. Progress toward solutions =Goldbach's conjecture= Vinogradov's theorem proves Goldbach's weak conjecture for sufficiently large n. In 2013, Harald Helfgott proved the weak conjecture for all odd numbers greater than 5. Unlike Goldbach's conjecture, Goldbach's weak conjecture states that every odd number greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes. Although Goldbach's strong conjecture has not been proven or disproven, its proof would imply the proof of Goldbach's weak conjecture. Chen's theorem proves that for all sufficiently large n, 2n=p+q where p is prime and q is either prime or semiprime.A semiprime is a natural number that is the product of two prime factors. Montgomery and Vaughan showed that the exceptional set (even numbers not expressible as the sum of two primes) was of density zero. The best current bound on the exceptional set is E(x) < x^{0.72} (for large enough x) due to Pintz.Janos Pintz, A new explicit formula in the additive theory of primes with applications II. The exceptional set in Goldbach's problem, 2018 preprint In 2015, Tomohiro Yamada proved an explicit version of Chen's theorem: every even number greater than e^{e^{36}} \\\\approx 1.7\\\\cdot10^{1872344071119348} is the sum of a prime and a product of at most two primes. =Twin prime conjecture= Yitang ZhangYitang Zhang, Bounded gaps between primes, Annals of Mathematics 179 (2014), pp. 1121–1174 from Volume 179 (2014), Issue 3 showed that there are infinitely many prime pairs with gap bounded by 70 million, and this result has been improved to gaps of length 246 by a collaborative effort of the Polymath Project. Under the generalized Elliott–Halberstam conjecture this was improved to 6, extending earlier work by MaynardJ. Maynard (2015), Small gaps between primes. Annals of Mathematics 181(1): 383-413. and Goldston, Pintz & Yıldırım. Chen showed that there are infinitely many primes p (later called Chen primes) such that p + 2 is either a prime or a semiprime. =Legendre's conjecture= It suffices to check that each prime gap starting at p is smaller than 2 \\\\sqrt p. A table of maximal prime gaps shows that the conjecture holds to 4×1018.Jens Kruse Andersen, Maximal Prime Gaps. A counterexample near 1018 would require a prime gap fifty million times the size of the average gap. Matomäki shows that there are at most x^{1/6} exceptional primes followed by gaps larger than \\\\sqrt{2p}; in particular, :\\\\sum_{\\\\stackrel{p_{n+1}-p_n > x^{1/2}}{x \\\\leq p_n \\\\leq 2x}}p_{n+1}-p_n\\\\ll x^{2/3}.. A result due to Ingham shows that there is a prime between n^3 and (n+1)^3 for every large enough n. =Near-square primes= Landau's fourth problem asked whether there are infinitely many primes which are of the form p=n^2+1 for integer n. (The list of known primes of this form is .) The existence of infinitely many such primes would follow as a consequence of other number-theoretic conjectures such as the Bunyakovsky conjecture and Bateman–Horn conjecture. , this problem is open. One example of near-square primes are Fermat primes. Henryk Iwaniec showed that there are infinitely many numbers of the form n^2+1 with at most two prime factors.. Nesmith Ankeny proved that, assuming the extended Riemann hypothesis for L-functions on Hecke characters, there are infinitely many primes of the form x^2+y^2 with y=O(\\\\log x).N. C.

Replacing the exponent with 2 would yield Landau's conjecture. The Brun sieve establishes an upper bound on the density of primes having the form p=n^2+1: there are O(\\\\sqrt x/\\\\log x) such primes up to x. It then follows that almost all numbers of the form n^2+1 are composite.

It is financed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and through the local state dental councils.  Objectives  * Maintain uniform standards of dental education in India * Regulate the curriculum in the training of dentists, dental hygienists and dental mechanics * Regulate the level of examinations and qualifications  Function  The Dental Council of India is constituted by an act of parliament ‘The Dentists Act 1948’ (XVI of 1948) with a view to regulate the dental education, dental profession and dental ethics thereto- which came into existence in March, 1949. The Council is composed of 6 constituencies representing Central Government, State Government, Universities, Dental Colleges, Medical Council of India and the Private Practitioners of Dentistry. The Director-General of Health Services is Ex- Officio Member – both of the Executive Committee and General Body. The Council elects from themselves the President, Vice-President and the members of the Executive Committee. The elected President and the Vice-President are the Ex- Officio Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is the governing body of this organisation, which deals with all procedural, financial and day-to-day activities and affairs of the Council. The Council is financed mainly by grants from the Govt. of India, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (Deptt. of Health) though the other source of income of the Council is the 1/4th share of fees realised every year by various State Dental Councils under section 53 of the Dentists Act, Inspection fee from the various Dental Institution for Inspecting under Section 15 of the Dentists Act, 1948 and application fee from the organisation to apply for permission to set up new Dental College, opening of higher Courses of study and increase of admission capacity in Dental Colleges under section 10A of the Dentists Act, 1948 as amended by the Dentists (Amendment) Act, 1993.  Future  In January 2020, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare put in the public domain the draft National Dental commission Bill, a bill aimed at replacing the Dental Council of India and replacing it with National Dental Commission. These Regulatory Bodies are proposed to be replaced with a common Statutory Body known as National Commission for Human Resources for Health. This is primarily due to widespread allegations of corruption in the Dental Council of India, and raids conducted by Central Bureau of Investigation on Anil Kohli, tainted ex-President of Dental Council of India and Ketan Desai, tainted ex- President of Medical Council of India.

These lenses may also be used for other purposes, often being suited for indoor sports photography as well, due to suitable focal length and wide aperture, though autofocus speed is an issue in sports photography that is less important in portraiture. Criteria Lenses suited for traditional portrait photography are medium telephoto lenses, in the 85 mm-135 mm range, which provide the desired perspective distortion in head and shoulders shots (compressing facial features), and have fast aperture, of 2.8 or faster, to allow shallow depth of field, focusing attention on the subject. One can use other lenses, either with shorter focal length (particularly for full body shots), or longer focal length (particularly in fashion photography, to increase the flattening effect, or in very cropped facial shots). Other lenses can be used for artistic effect; one could use a fisheye lens, for instance, though this is considered neither traditional nor flattering.

It primarily owns and operates railroads, with a network of 21 regional and shortline railroads in 12 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces. It is one of the largest privately owned railroad companies in the United States. The firm also invests in, develops, and operates ports, multimodal transportation terminals, and industrial parks. History of the company OmniTRAX was incorporated in 1986 as a subsidiary of The Broe Group, a privately held energy development and real estate company founded by Denver businessman Pat Broe in 1972. OmniTRAX purchased the Great Western Railway of Colorado that year in order to augment the value of Broe's industrial real estate developments in northeastern Colorado. =Initial expansion= OmniTRAX leased the Kansas Southwestern Railway from the Union Pacific Railroad in April 1991. In June 1992, OmniTRAX purchased all the outstanding stock of the Chicago West Pullman Transportation Co., which owned the Manufacturers' Junction Railway at Cicero, Illinois; the Newburgh and South Shore Railroad at Cleveland, Ohio; the Chicago Rail Link at Chicago, Illinois; the Chicago, West Pullman and Southern Railroad in Chicago; the Georgia Woodlands Railroad in Warren and Wilkes counties, Georgia; and the Wisconsin and Calumet Railroad in southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois. The Wisconsin & Calumet was sold less than a month later to the Wisconsin and Southern Railroad.; OmniTRAX purchased the abandoned Western Electric Hawthorne Works in Cicero, which was adjacent to the Manufacturers' Junction Railway, and began developing it as a multimodal transfer center. In October 1992, OmniTRAX purchased of track in Kansas and Oklahoma from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The main lines of track stretched from Salina, Kansas, to Osborne, Kansas, and from Marion, Kansas, to Scott City, Kansas.; ; OmniTRAX formed the Central Kansas Railway to run on the lines. The Kansas Southwestern Railway merged into the Central Kansas Railway in May 2000, and then OmniTRAX sold the Central Kansas Railway to the Watco Companies in April 2001. OmniTRAX purchased of track between Borger and Panhandle, Texas, from the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe in November 1993. It formed the Panhandle Northern Railroad to operate on this track. Eighteen months later, in May 1995, OmniTRAX leased the Northern Ohio & Western Railway from the Sandusky County/Seneca County/Tiffin Port Authority. =Move into Canada= OmniTRAX moved into Canada in November 1996 with its purchase of the Hudson Bay Railway, which ran from The Pas, Manitoba, to the Port of Churchill in Churchill, Manitoba. OmniTRAX then purchased the port itself for C$1 in November 1997. As part of the deal, the Canadian government agreed to put C$34 million worth of upgrades, dredging, and repairs into the port, while OmniTRAX pledged to add C$45 million in upgrading the port facilities and Hudson Bay Railway. Three months later, OmniTRAX purchased the Carlton Trail Railway track bought from the Canadian National Railway. The ran from Warman, Saskatchewan, to White Star, Saskatchewan, and from Speers Junction (near White Star) to end of the line at Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan. =Post-2000 expansion= OmniTRAX expanded its presence in the American Southeast in 2004 by purchasing the Georgia and Florida Railnet (renamed the Georgia and Florida Railway) from North American Railnet. It also leased the terminal switching Fulton County Railway (based in Atlanta), and the Alabama and Tennessee River Railway in Alabama. It purchased both lines outright in 2018. OmniTRAX made its first venture into Washington state when it purchased the BNSF Railway in January 2005. This route, shaped like an inverted capital \\"U\\", ran from Kettle Falls, Washington, north to the U.S.-Canadian border at Laurier, Washington, crossed the border to reach Cascade City, British Columbia, traveled west to Almond Gardens, then south to cross the border to follow Washington State Route 21 to Republic, Washington. Another of line (from Kettle Falls southeast to Chewelah, Washington, and from Kettle Falls northwest to Columbia Gardens, British Columbia) was leased from BNSF. The Kettle Falls International Railway was created to run on these lines. OmniTRAX completed its purchase of all of North American Railnet's assets in April 2005 when it purchased the Nebraska Kansas Colorado Railway and the Illinois Railway. =2010s purchases= OmniTRAX moved into California for the first time in 2011 when it purchased the Stockton Terminal and Eastern Railroad, a short line linking several industrial customers to the Port of Stockton, the Union Pacific, and the BNSF. The company expanded its operations in Oklahoma in June 2014 when it purchased the Sand Springs Railway based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In September 2016, it acquired the former Gerdau steel mill site. The company said it would work with other Broe Co. subsidiaries to build residential, retail, industrial, logistics, and transportation buildings and facilities there. June 2014 also saw OmniTRAX purchase the Brownsville and Rio Grande International Railroad in Texas, bringing its number of rail subsidiaries to 19. This made OmniTRAX the third-largest shortline railroad company in the United States, behind Genesee & Wyoming Inc. and Watco Companies. As part of the Brownsville & Rio Grande purchase, OmniTRAX also received a 30-year lease on within the Brownsville Navigation District (the governmental entity which runs the Port of Brownsville and other transportation and shipping infrastructure in the Brownsville, Texas, area). Under the terms of the deal, the company agreed to invest at least $8.5 million in rail and port upgrades, and help market of undeveloped port land. OmniTRAX said it would build an industrial park on the land. By the end of 2014, the firm also controlled the Peru Industrial Railroad, a switching railroad in Peru, Illinois. By March of 2016, OmniTRAX owned 20 shortline railroads operating in 12 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces. In the early months of the year, it spent $14 million restoring of track between Greeley and Windsor, Colorado. This halved the rail traffic passing through the town of Fort Collins by providing a shorter route for traffic intended for routing along the Union Pacific. In July of that year, the company partnered with the Topflight Grain Cooperative to operate the new Decatur Central Railroad. OmniTRAX purchased of Decatur Junction Railway track that connected Topflight's facility at the Midwest Inland Port near Cisco, Illinois, with a variety of grain and cereal processing plants in and around Macon County, Illinois. The top companies shared the costs of equipment and operations of the railroad. OmniTRAX proposed buying Iowa Pacific Holdings' Sanford Lake Branch track (also known as the Saratoga-North Creek Railway), which ran from North Creek, New York, to Tahawus, New York, in August 2019. The firm also proposed buying track owned by Warren County which ran from North Creek to Corinth, New York. This would allow OmniTRAX to make additional connections with Class I railroads. Local residents, concerned that OmniTRAX would permit its track to be used for the storage of oil tank cars, opposed the sale. Warren County officials did not want to sell their track for fear of losing control over the uses to which it could be put. After a year of public debate, OmniTRAX declined to pursue both deals.; ; In July 2019, OmniTRAX purchased the Winchester and Western Railroad's Virginia Division from Covia Holdings for $105 million. The division included of track in western Virginia and of track in New Jersey. The purchase was subject to review and approval by the Surface Transportation Board, a federal agency. It was completed in September 2019. Churchill controversy In 1997 the Canadian National Railway sold the Port of Churchill and accompanying rail line to OmniTRAX as part of the privatization of CN. OmniTRAX operated the railway for the ensuing two decades, shipping mostly wheat to the Port of Churchill on behalf of the Canadian Wheat Board. In June 2017, OmniTRAX suspended service on the Churchill rail line after severe flooding washed out the line in multiple locations. OmniTRAX refused to repair the railway, claiming it was not economically feasible. The company claimed that due to the closure of the Canadian Wheat Board in 2008, it was no longer economical to operate the line or the Port of Churchill. As part of a 2008 contract between the Federal Government and OmniTRAX, the Government of Canada had given OmniTRAX C$20 million for upgrades to both the Railway and Port with the agreement that the company would match the funds. However, the contract stipulated that OmniTRAX could not reduce or abandon service on the line, or the funding would be required to be returned. On October 13, 2017, Minister of Natural Resources Jim Carr issued a notice of default to OmniTRAX, advising the company that they had 30 days to make repairs to the rail line or face default on the agreement. On November 14, the Federal Government issued a notice of default against OmniTRAX claiming C$18 million, plus interest. In response, the company filed a complaint through NAFTA Chapter 11 claiming the Canadian Federal Government had sabotaged efforts to repair and transfer ownership of the railway. In June of 2018 OmnitTRAX was ordered by federal regulators to repair the tracks. On August 31, 2018 the port and rail line were sold to Arctic Gateway Group, a consortium of investors including First Nations, local governments, financial holding companies, and grain producers. BC Rail controversy In 2003, OmniTRAX was one of three companies bidding for BC Rail, a province-owned railroad in British Columbia then being privatized by the government. OmniTRAX officials began communicating with provincial officials in 2001, urging the privatization of the railroad. Although the British Columbia Liberal Party had pledged during 2001 elections not to sell the road, OmniTRAX officials continued to urge them to do so in 2002. BC Rail officials recommended the privatization of the line in the fall of 2002. OmniTRAX partnered with BNSF to bid on the line. OmniTRAX hired Pilothouse Communications, a Victoria-based lobbyist firm, to represent its interests. Pilothouse lobbyist Erik Bornmann bribed two ministerial aides from 2001 to 2003 with cash and gifts in exchange for confidential government documents that were then passed to OmniTRAX. Brian Kieran, Pilothouse's owner, claimed he advised OmniTRAX against offering one a gift (a trip to Denver to see a football game), but OmniTRAX officials disregarded his advice. Law enforcement officials never charged OmniTRAX with any wrongdoing in regards to the bribery effort or the receipt of stolen documents. OmniTRAX ultimately bid C$710 million for BC Rail, a C$4 million increase over its initial second-round bid. Although Crown prosecutors believed the improved OmniTRAX bid was related to its receipt of leaked documents, court testimony indicated that the government's bid evaluation team thought the improved offer was merely an attempt to win the auction. OmniTRAX dropped out of the auction (police later alleged, based on wiretap information) after its officials came to believe that the provincial government had predetermined Canadian National Railway to be the successful bidder. David Basi, an aide to BC Finance Minister Gary Collins, then advised Collins to arrange an unnamed \\"consolation prize\\" for OmniTRAX. In December 2003, Pat Broe and Dwight Johnson (a vice president of The Broe Group) had dinner at an exclusive Vancouver restaurant with Collins. Their conversation allegedly regarded the sale of a BC Rail spur line to OmniTRAX. The sale of the spur was cancelled after law enforcement officials revealed to Collins that the sale had been compromised due to the disclosure of confidential government information. Law enforcement officials investigated the dinner meeting, but never charged Broe, Johnson, or Collins with wrongdoing. OmniTRAX strongly asserted it had committed no ethical or legal infractions regarding the meeting. About the company OmniTRAX is subsidiary of The Broe Group, a company with an array of financial interests in energy development, healthcare technology, real estate, transportation, and other industries. As of August 2019, OmniTRAX operated 21 rail lines, making it one of the largest privately-owned rail transportation companies in the United States. OmniTRAX's corporate strategy is to identify companies or groups of companies transporting cargo but not using railroads to do so. It then looks for unused or under-used rail opportunities nearby to serve these customers. Commodities which the company transports include aggregate, chemicals, clay, grain, and stone. OmniTRAX railroads often connect to Class I railroads. OmniTRAX also operates ports, terminals, and multimodal transhipment facilities. It sometimes engages (alone or in concert with other Broe Group companies) in industrial development. =Subsidiaries= OmniTRAX owned and managed railroads include: *Alabama & Tennessee River Railway *Brownsville and Rio Grande International Railroad *Carlton Trail Railway *Central Texas and Colorado River Railway *Chicago Rail Link *Decatur Central Railroad *Fulton County Railway *Georgia & Florida Railway *Georgia Woodlands Railroad *Great Western Railway of Colorado *Illinois Railway *Kettle Falls International Railway *Manufacturers' Junction Railway *Nebraska Kansas Colorado Railway *Newburgh & South Shore Railroad *Northern Ohio & Western Railway *Panhandle Northern Railroad *Peru Industrial Railroad *Sand Springs Railway *Stockton Terminal and Eastern Railroad *Winchester and Western Railroad TransCANADA Switching Services (TSS) was formed by OmniTRAX in 1996. In 1997, TSS won a contract to provide switching services at the newly-opened Deltaport, the Port of Vancouver's new container shipping facility. OmniTRAX ceased to provide services at Deltaport in July 2008. OmniTRAX Logistics Services (OLS) is a subsidiary of OmniTRAX that provides materials handling. In 2016, OLS purchased the assets of Terracor Group, a firm that provided ultra-fine-grain sand for hydraulic fracturing purposes. These included three \\"frac sand\\" facilities (in Montana and Texas) and the mineral rights to a frac sand mine in Wisconsin. OmniTRAX intended to supply frac sand to Broe Group energy development companies as well as to other customers in Bakken Formation of Manitoba, Montana, North Dakota, and Saskatchewan; the Eagle Ford Shale of Texas; and the Permian Basin of New Mexico and Texas. OmniTRAX's attempt to open the Wisconsin mine led to a lawsuit in February 2017 by local residents who feared the noise, light, and traffic associated with the mine. Although OmniTRAX won a state permit to fill in of wetland as part of a proposed railroad associated with the mine, a state court permitted the lawsuit to proceed. In May 2019, OmniTRAX said it had abandoned the mine project.; ; ; ; OmniTRAX Sand Holdings is a subsidiary of OmniTRAX which provides transportation options for frac sand and ceramics. It is a joint venture of OmniTRAX and Arrows Up, a bulk materials storage and transportation company. The joint venture is marketing the Arrows Up Jumbo Bin, a container which can be used by rail or trucks that is capable of holding up to of frac sand or ceramic material. The bin can be used for transportation or storage, and contains its own dust suppression features.

Life Baermann was born in Potsdam. In his youth, Baermann took lessons from Joseph Beer (1744–1811) at the military school in Potsdam. After his prowess came to the attention of the Berlin court in 1804, Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia had the 20-year-old musician pursue his training in Berlin under the guidance of Franz Tausch (1762–1817). He played in the court orchestra of Munich from 1807 until his retirement in 1834, when his son Carl Baermann succeeded him. Parallel to Baermann's rise, the clarinet was undergoing a series of developments in key construction and embouchure that allowed greater agility and flexibility in playing. The growing custom was to play with the reed on the bottom lip, as is done today, as opposed to the top lip as had been the previous prevailing style. Baermann was an exponent of this new style of playing, and possessed a modern instrument made by Griesling & Schlott which allowed him to play chromatic passages with far greater ease than traditional 5-keyed instruments. He is said to have had a great dynamic range.His playing is described in primary sources by the Trio di Clarone in the preface to Mendelssohn's Concert Piece for Clarinet, Basset Horn and Piano No. 1, published by Breitkopf & Härtel, Germany, 1993 Numerous composers wrote for Baermann, who undoubtedly had a great influence on the Romantic clarinet repertoire thereby. Along with lesser-known composers such as Franz Danzi and Peter von Lindpaintner, Baermann received works from Felix Mendelssohn, Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer. Mendelssohn most notably wrote the two Konzertstücke, Opp. 113, 114 (Concert Pieces) for Baermann and his son Carl to play together; Meyerbeer wrote a quintet (1812) and concertos, and Weber produced numerous works including two concertos (Op. 73 and Op. 74), a quintet (Op. 34), the Concertino, Op. 26 and the Sylvana Variations, Op. 33, but not the Grand Duo Concertant (Op. 48).Taken from the section by Pamela Weston in Colin Lawson's Cambridge Companion to the Clarinet, pp. 94–95, Cambridge University Press, 1995. As with many other virtuosi at the time, Baermann tried his hand fairly successfully at composing for his instrument. Among other works, he wrote a Septet in E-flat major, Op. 23, for clarinet, string quartet, and two ad libitum horns. The Adagio movement from this septet has received several recordings as a stand-alone piece, though it was for many years misattributed to Richard Wagner. Baermann died in Munich, aged 63.

Producing about 110 to 120 hp, it was at the low-end of the power range of contemporary engines, and was generally outperformed by rotaries whose power- to-weight ratio tended to be much better. It also had stiff competition from the Ferdinand Porsche-designed 120 hp Austro-Daimler 6. The D.II was produced only briefly as a result, but its design formed the basis for the later Mercedes D.III which saw widespread use throughout the war. Design and development The D.II was based on the Austro-Daimler to a large degree. Like the Austro-Daimler, it was built up from the crankcase, which was milled from two pieces of cast aluminum bolted together at their midline. The cylinders were separately milled from steel and bolted to the top of the crankcase. Steel sleeves were fitted over the cylinders and welded on to form a cooling jacket. Much of this complexity is due to the differential rates of expansion of steel and aluminum, which precluded screwing the cylinders into the crankcase, and the alloys of the era meant that an aluminum cylinder was not possible. Both engines also used a scavenger pump to pump oil out of the crankcase to a separate cylinder, where a second high-pressure pump supplied oil to the engine. This arrangement allowed for a much smaller \\"sump\\" on the bottom of the crankcase, reducing the overall size of the engine, although in the case of the D.II it was not nearly as much as the Austro-Daimler. Where the D.II differed from the Austro-Daimler was largely in mechanical arrangement. For instance, the D.II featured a single overhead cam, powered by a shaft leading up from the crankshaft at the rear of the engine, whereas the Austro-Daimler had a more conventional valvetrain using pushrods driven from the crankcase. Another unique feature was the ability to shift the camshaft to a half-compression position for starting. The D.II used two carburetors located together on one side of the engine, feeding the cylinders through two manifolds; the Austro-Daimler separated its carburetors to locate them closer to the cylinders they fed. The D.II also used a unique cooling jacket design, with every two cylinders being covered by a single jacket. The D.II was introduced in 1914. It was fairly quickly replaced by the D.III, and ended production around 1916. The D.III was essentially a scaled-up D.II, although it abandoned the paired cooling jackets.

It was formed in 1965 by the Russian composer and harpsichord player Andrey Volkonsky to perform Russian and Western sacred music of the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and Baroque eras. Its members were featured soloists of the Moscow State Philharmonic Society. In the intervening years, the 12-member group has expanded its repertoire to include a broad range of sacred and secular vocal and instrumental works of the 16th-18th centuries from across Europe. After the emigration of Andrey Volkonsky to the West, the ensemble was directed by the organist Oleg Yanchenko, and since 1993 by the singer Lydia Davydova. As the name suggests, the ensemble specializes in madrigals and other secular genres of Renaissance and Baroque. The group has recorded more than 30 vinyl disks and has given more than 4000 performances in Russia, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Hungary, Poland, and elsewhere. The Ensemble Madrigal enjoys a permanent relationship with the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall in Moscow. Reviews \\"The hype was not justified; it was exceeded! The concert of the Ensemble Madrigal, 'Music of the Castilian Kings', struck the public at the overcrowded Church of St. Joseph both by the choice of repertory and the quality of the performance. The vocalists were excellent, as were the instrumentalists - all brought together by the artistic director of the ensemble, Lydia Davydova; together, they created a miracle. Truly, the fantastic concert of the Ensemble Madrigal demonstrated a high level of skill and gives honour to Russian music and art.\\" (La Verdata, Spain) References Bibliography Tumanov, Alexander.

It may also be entwined with images of a real or abstract nature, with the use of art or photography. Furthermore, while experimental literature was handwritten on paper or vellum, the digital age has seen an exponential leaning to the use of digital computer technologies. Early history The first text generally cited in this category is Laurence Sterne's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759). This text occurs so early in the standard history of the novel that one can't refer to its \\"breaking\\" conventions that had yet to solidify. But in its mockery of narrative, and its willingness to use such graphic elements as an all-black page to mourn the death of a character, Sterne's novel is considered a fundamental text for many post-World War II authors. However, Sterne's work was not without detractors even in its time; for instance, Samuel Johnson is quoted in Boswell as saying \\"The merely odd does not last. Tristram Shandy did not last.\\" Denis Diderot's Jacques the Fatalist and His Master, drew many elements from Tristam Shandy, a fact not concealed in the text, making it an early example of metafiction. 20th- century history In the 1910s, artistic experimentation became a prominent force, and various European and American writers began experimenting with the given forms. Tendencies that formed during this period later became parts of the modernist movement. The Cantos of Ezra Pound, the post-World War I work of T. S. Eliot, prose and plays by Gertrude Stein, were some of the most influential works of the time, though James Joyce's Ulysses is generally considered the most important work of the time. The novel ultimately influenced not only more experimental writers, such as Virginia Woolf, but also less experimental writers, such as Hemingway. The historical avant-garde movements also contributed to the development of experimental literature in the early and middle 20th century. In the Dadaist movement, poet Tristan Tzara employed newspaper clippings and experimental typography in his manifestoes. The futurist author F.T. Marinetti espoused a theory of \\"words in freedom\\" across the page, exploding the boundaries of both conventional narrative and the layout of the book itself as shown in his \\"novel\\" Zang Tumb Tumb. The writers, poets, and artists associated with the surrealist movement employed a range of unusual techniques to evoke mystical and dream-like states in their poems, novels, and prose works. Examples include the collaboratively written texts Les Champs Magnétiques (by André Breton and Philippe Soupault) and Sorrow for Sorrow, a \\"dream novel\\" produced under hypnosis by Robert Desnos. By the end of the 1930s, the political situation in Europe had made Modernism appear to be an inadequate, aestheticized, even irresponsible response to the dangers of worldwide fascism, and literary experimentalism faded from public view for a period, kept alive through the 1940s only by isolated visionaries like Kenneth Patchen. In the 1950s, the Beat writers can be seen as a reaction against the hidebound quality of both the poetry and prose of its time, and such hovering, near-mystical works as Jack Kerouac's novel Visions of Gerard represented a new formal approach to the standard narrative of that era. American novelists such as John Hawkes started publishing novels in the late 1940s that played with the conventions of narrative. The spirit of the European avant-gardes would be carried through the post-war generation as well. The poet Isidore Isou formed the Lettrist group, and produced manifestoes, poems, and films that explored the boundaries of the written and spoken word. The OULIPO (in French, Ouvroir de littérature potentielle, or \\"Workshop of Potential Literature\\") brought together writers, artists, and mathematicians to explore innovative, combinatoric means of producing texts. Founded by the author Raymond Queneau and mathematician François Le Lionnais, the group included Italo Calvino and Georges Perec. Queneau's Cent Mille Millards de Poèmes uses the physical book itself to proliferate different sonnet combinations, while Perec's novel Life: A User's Manual is based on the Knight's Tour on a chessboard. The 1960s brought a brief return of the glory days of modernism, and a first grounding of Post-modernism. Publicity owing to an obscenity trial against William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch brought a wide awareness of and admiration for an extreme and uncensored freedom. Burroughs also pioneered a style known as cut-up, where newspapers or typed manuscripts were cut up and rearranged to achieve lines in the text. In the late 1960s, experimental movements became so prominent that even authors considered more conventional such as Bernard Malamud and Norman Mailer exhibited experimental tendencies. Metafiction was an important tendency in this period, exemplified most elaborately in the works of John Barth, Jonathan Bayliss, and Jorge Luis Borges. In 1967 Barth wrote the essay The Literature of Exhaustion,John Barth (1984) intro to The Literature of Exhaustion, in The Friday Book. which is sometimes considered a manifesto of postmodernism. A major touchstone of this era was Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, which eventually became a bestseller. Important authors in the short story form included Donald Barthelme, and, in both short and long forms, Robert Coover and Ronald Sukenick. While in 1968 William H. Gass's novel Willie Masters Lonesome Wife added challenging dimensions to reading as some of the pages are in mirror writing where the text can only be read if a mirror is held in an angle against the page. Some later well-known experimental writers of the 1970s and 1980s were Italo Calvino, Michael Ondaatje, and Julio Cortázar. Calvino's most famous books are If on a winter's night a traveler, where some chapters depict the reader preparing to read a book titled If on a winter's night a traveler while others form the narrative and Invisible Cities, where Marco Polo explains his travels to Kubla Khan although they are merely accounts of the very city in which they are chatting.Cooley, Martha. \\"On the Work of Italo Calvino\\", The Writer's Chronicle, May 2008, pp 24-32 Ondaatje's The Collected Works of Billy the Kid uses a scrapbook style to tell its story while Cortázar's Hopscotch can be read with the chapters in any order. Argentine Julio Cortázar and the naturalized Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector, both Latin American writers who have created masterpieces in experimental literature of 20th and 21st century, mixing dreamscapes, journalism, and fiction; regional classics written in Spanish include the Mexican novel \\"Pedro Paramo\\" by Juan Rulfo, the Colombian family epic \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Peruvian political history \\"The War of the End of the World\\" by Mario Vargas Llosa, the Puerto Rican Spanglish dramatic dialogue \\"Yo-Yo Boing!\\" by Giannina Braschi, and the Cuban revolutionary novel \\"Paradise\\" by Lezama Lima.Americas Society's Latin American Literature Roster, 2005. Contemporary American authors David Foster Wallace, Giannina Braschi, and Rick Moody, combine some of the experimental form-play of the 1960s writers with a more emotionally deflating, irony, and a greater tendency towards accessibility and humor. Wallace's Infinite Jest is a maximalist work describing life at a tennis academy and a rehab facility; digressions often become plotlines, and the book ultimately features over 100 pages of footnotes. Other writers like Nicholson Baker were noted for their minimalism in novels such as The Mezzanine, about a man who rides an escalator for 140 pages. American author Mark Danielewski combined elements of a horror novel with formal academic writing and typographic experimentation in his novel House of Leaves. Greek author Dimitris Lyacos in Z213: Exit combines, in a kind of a modern-day palimpsest, the diary entries of two narrators in a heavily fragmented text, interspersed with excerpts from the biblical Exodus, to recount a journey along which the distinct realities of inner self and outside world gradually merge. 21st-century history In the early 21st century, many examples of experimental literature reflect the emergence of computers and other digital technologies, some of them actually using the medium on which they are reflecting. Such writing has been variously referred to electronic literature, hypertext, and codework. Others have focused on exploring the plurality of narrative point of views, like the Uruguayan American writer Jorge Majfud in La reina de América and La ciudad de la luna.

In 1995 it was recognized as the largest privately owned ambulance service in the United States. Today the company responds to emergency and non-emergency calls in Louisiana; Southeast, Central, and North Texas; Jackson County, Mississippi; and Memphis, Tennessee. Headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, Acadian Ambulance maintains a fleet of more than 400 ground ambulances, as well as eight medical transport helicopters and five fixed-wing aircraft that provide aerial transport to medical facilities. In addition to emergency medical services, Acadian offers an aircraft charter service, a personal medical alarm service, fire and burglar alarm service, industrial medical personnel, fire and safety technicians, and medical and industrial training, as well as billing software. History Acadian was founded by Roland Dugas, Richard Zuschlag, and Richard Sturlese in response to funeral homes ceasing to provide ambulance services because of new, financially burdensome federal guidelines. They decided that it was time to create a private ambulance company and took their idea to the Lafayette Police Jury. Without the needed funds to get started, they decided to hire former Vietnam War medics to staff their new company, and raise funds through membership subscriptions. On July 21, 1971, the Police Jury authorized Acadian Ambulance Service, Inc. to be the emergency provider for Lafayette Parish. To this day, Acadian uses membership drives to aid funding of the company. When Acadian first started, they had just 2 ambulances and 8 medics. Roland Dugas was the first president. At 12:01 AM on September 1, 1971, when funeral homes ceased services, Acadian Ambulance Service went live with a membership of 8,400 households. Over the next year, Acadian grew to a fleet of 8 ambulances, and moved into about 26,000 households. In 1972, Acadian expanded service into St. Mary and Vermilion Parishes. They soon put in a model dispatch system, of which other companies would follow. In 1973, Acadian moved into Acadia, Jefferson Davis, St. Martin, and Terrebonne Parishes, along with the city of Eunice. Membership levels grew to 70,648. In 1974, Acadian built a new headquarters in Lafayette with a state of the art Emergency Medical Dispatch Center. The company now had 100 employees, including 75 EMTs as it moved into Evangeline and Iberia Parishes. By 1975, they had 33 ambulances, and 80,216 households covered. In 1976, Acadian expanded their EMT training, formalizing it and fully certifying employees through the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians and the state of Louisiana. In 1979, membership reached 100,000 households. That year brought the expansion into Assumption Parish, and an expansion to their telemetry system, including transmissions of EKGs to hospital rooms from almost anywhere in the service area. Over the past four decades, Acadian Ambulance continued to grow its service area and now encompasses the majority of parishes in Louisiana, 34 counties in Texas and one county in Mississippi. In 2018 it was announced that Acadian Ambulance would also begin servicing Memphis, Tennessee in 2019. The company also expanded into six distinct divisions, with patients, clients and customers around the globe. Acadian Companies After starting out in 1971 as a small ambulance company in Lafayette, Louisiana, Acadiana Ambulance has grown into a larger, multi-division company. Today, Acadian has more than 4,000 employees across six divisions— ranging from Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technicians and pilots to health, safety, and security professional and support staff. The Acadian fleet includes more than 400 ground ambulances, helicopters, and fixed-wing aircraft. An Acadian ambulance at the scene of an emergency Acadian Ambulance Service Acadian Ambulance Service began operations in 1971, in response to a sudden crisis. Communities around the country found themselves without emergency medical transportation when new federal regulations caused funeral homes to discontinue using their hearses for emergency transport. These regulations went into effect at midnight on September 1, 1971. At 12:01 a.m., Acadian Ambulance began its Louisiana operations with three young co-founders, two ambulances, eight medics, and 279 square miles of Lafayette Parish to cover. Air Med Services Surrounding parishes became interested in having Acadian Ambulance’s pre-hospital emergency care and soon invitations to serve came in from other areas. Louisiana's diverse geography of rich swamps and marshlands, and extensive rural areas, made navigation in a ground ambulance an often difficult task. Air Med To address the challenge of an expanded population and geographical service area, Acadian Ambulance expanded to include Air Med Services in 1981, which hosted the first medical helicopter based in Lafayette, La. This allowed Acadian Ambulance to quickly access onshore and offshore emergency situations. By 1989, Air Med had also acquired fixed wing aircraft for extended emergency and non-emergency air medical transports. Air Med and Executive Air Charter currently operate several King Air aircraft and a Lear 45 jet aircraft. Executive Aircraft Charter Service Eventually the fixed wing fleet of Air Med would progress into Executive Aircraft Charter Service; since only a handful of air medical flights are scheduled per week, the interior of the aircraft can be easily reconfigured and utilized for business or pleasure flights throughout North America. Safety Management Systems At its inception, Air Med was the first aero-medical provider in the Gulf of Mexico with helicopters equipped like a hospital emergency room and flight paramedics. This enhanced the safety of offshore workers and Acadian also began providing contract medics to work shifts on oil installations offshore soon after. The duality of these developments led to partnerships with the oil & gas companies, which in turn evolved into Safety Management Systems, Acadian’s health, safety, environmental, medical, security and training service company. Today, SMS is one of the largest providers of these services in the industry and caters to an array of industrial safety needs, such as: safety and regulatory compliance training, health and wellness testing and specialized programs, and remote paramedics. Acadian Total Security When Acadian began in the 1970s, emergency communications were primitive, at best. Within the next 10 years, Acadian established a nationally respected dispatch center that became recognized as an industry leader in emergency communications. Through the use of their state-of-the art technology, communication center, and highly trained dispatchers, Acadian Monitoring Services was born in 1991 as Acadian On Call. Acadian Monitoring Services currently offers personal medical alerts, mobile monitoring, GPS tracking and fleet safety services, advanced video security services, access control, security monitoring, and telehealth monitoring through three, highly sophisticated call centers. In 2014, Acadian expanded its security monitoring division and began offering security systems, advanced video services and access control systems directly to consumers. National EMS Academy Because most ambulance services were unregulated before 1970, Acadian became one of the first companies to train EMTs. Acadian’s 700-hour National Registry paramedic course was one of the first of its kind offered in Louisiana. In-house EMS education continued over the next three decades as Acadian’s medical education department trained medics and offered the continuing education hours EMTs needed to recertify. However, along with the growth of the company came a corresponding shortage of paramedics. With this in mind, the National EMS Academy was launched in 2003 through collaboration with South Louisiana Community College, so Acadian could educate its own medics. Legal problems and lawsuits On March 26, 1998, US Attorney Mike Skinner announced that Acadian Ambulance had agreed to pay the federal government $1.9 million to settle a lawsuit that charged the Lafayette company with overbilling the Medicare and Medicaid programs from 1990 to 1994. Following her total left hip arthroplasty in June 2000, Gaye Cryar was being moved from her hospital bed to the stretcher of an Acadian Ambulance to transfer her to a rehabilitation hospital. The Acadian Ambulance crew dropped the patient, causing a re-injury and an acute fracture of the acetabulum and dislocation of the hip prosthesis. Acadian won summary judgement in the trial court but the Louisiana Court of Appeals, Third Circuit, reversed the summary judgment on May 31, 2006, saying, \\"[the] increasing complaints after the patient reported a rough transfer from bed to stretcher at Women's, this evidence is sufficient to raise a material issue of fact as to how, when, and where the fracture occurred, as well as to the possible fault of Women's and Acadian Ambulance.\\" On December 27, 2010, while transporting a pregnant patient, an Acadian Ambulance unit collided into the rear of a sugar cane truck near Brusly, Louisiana. The patient they were transporting did deliver her baby through Caesarean section, but remained critically injured. The lawsuit following the crash, Peggy Ross, et al. v. Michael Averette, et al. resulted in jury awarding $116,939,241 in damages on August 1, 2012. During Hurricane Katrina, Acadian Ambulance was contracted to evacuate \\"Special Needs\\" patients in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. They were notified they needed to evacuate Dorothy Hingle, 83, and her son, Russell Embry, 54, from their home due to the pending hurricane. They contacted Ms. Hingle on August 26, 2005, and confirmed they needed to be evacuated and agreed to perform the service. On August 27, 2005, they called Ms. Hingle back stating they would not be able to evacuate them, and as a result Ms. Hingle and Mr. Embry drowned when their home was covered by the storm surge. Acadian was sued for the negligence in Cooley V. Acadian Ambulance (2010-CA-1229, LA Ct. App., 4th Circ.). On June 11, 2009, Acadian Ambulance agreed to an undisclosed settlement with the family. Also as a result of failing to evacuate \\"Special Needs\\" people in St. Bernard Parish during Hurricane Katrina, a family of three were drowned as a result of the water surge. Jake John Schiro, Sr., Individually and as Administrator of the Estates of Dolores Schulte Schiro, Jake John Schiro, Jr. and Cynthia Ann Schiro v. Acadian Ambulance Service, Inc., ABC Ins. Co., et al. was filed in 2006 and is still making its way through the Louisiana court system. On December 12, 2012, Acadian Ambulance was ordered to pay $17 million in a class action lawsuit against them by 12th Judicial District Judge Mark Jeansonne. Keisha Desselle, et al. vs. Acadian Ambulance Service (No. 2010-5885 \\"A\\": Avoyelles Parish) was filed on October 25, 2010, in response to the improper billing practices of Acadian Ambulance. Acadian would file liens against accident victim's insurance settlements or civil awards which violated LSA-R.S. 22:1874. Additionally Acadian would balance bill insured patients for the difference between the negotiated payments received from insurance companies and the actual charged amount of the ambulance bill. Judge Jeansonne later recanted his original judgement and Acadian Ambulance agreed to settle a class action lawsuit for less than $5 million in June, 2014. The suit alleged that Acadian overcharged for services they provided to patients and it applies to those who were billed or paid for services between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2013.

It is one of the most expensive Afrikaans medium schools, the fee per child amounting to R 32,400 per annum (as of 2019). It has received the award for academic school of the year from the Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) in 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. In 2018 it received the award for best academic school in Gauteng province, the 9th time since 2009. It claims a 100% matric pass rate for 30 consecutive years. History The school formally opened on 9 January 1979 with 12 classrooms and 215 grade 8 and 9 pupils. The original school buildings were completed on 3 August 1979. By the 6th the school hall was complete and used for the first time. The first principal was Mr. H. Davin, hence the footpath to the administrative building was named \\"Davinweg\\". There were 11 suggestions for the school name among which \\"Hoërskool Hoogland\\", \\"Hoërskool Pretoria-Oos\\" and \\"Hoërskool op die Kruin\\". On 13 March 1979 it was however it was named as \\"Hoërskool Waterkloof\\", and the school motto, \\"Ons bou in geloof\\" (i.e. We build in faith), was formally accepted on 2 July. In 1980 the first permanent principal was appointed, mr. P. van der Merwe Martins, a member of the Afrikaner Broederbond who was previously a teacher in Volksrust. The school employed 12 teachers and 2 typists at this stage, and the first registered student was Riana Hattingh. When mr. Martins received a promotion in 1988, he was replaced by mr. F. van Dyk as the second principal. Dr. L. C. Becker was principal from 1991 till 2009, when the school lost control over its finances and the board stepped in. On 12 January 2011 mr. Daan G. C. Potgieter was appointed as the fourth principal. The principal since 1 December 2018 is mr. Chris H. Denysschen, formerly principal of Hoërskool Ben Vorster in Tzaneen. The school anthem was written by prof. S. J. Pretorius and was accepted on 13 May 1979 and the official banner was handed over on 18 September 1979. On 9 February 1980, the first grass and trees were planted by teachers, parents and pupils. The grandstand was completed in the same year and was named after the first principal, mr. Martins. In May 1994, Waterkloof's hostel \\"Klofiesig\\" was opened. On the cultural front, the English Department made their full-length play \\"Romeo and Juliet\\". The first opera \\"Die Witperdherberg\\" was staged in 1984. In 1984 the name \\"Druppels\\" was given to the new grade 8 learners. The name was proposed by Jurika Brand, a member of the Klofieraad (prefects). In 1985 Waterkloof yielded 15 Northern Transvaal Junior Choir and Orchestra pupils. In 1986, the school choir had their first public concert during the Applous'86 competition. With the development of the sports grounds, where the B and C rugby fields currently are, they had to be reclaimed because it was a natural pan where waterbirds were found. The first inter-house athletics event took place on 6 March 1979 and participated in the D-bond during the inter- schools athletics event. The first rugby match was played in the same year against Hoërskool Menlopark. Ulinda Gresse scored the first goal for the first hockey team. The first hockey team won their first game against Lyttelton Manor High in 1980. In September 1992, Waterkloof first rugby team won the \\"Direkteurstrofee\\" for the first time. In 1995 Waterkloof had won the A-bond interhigh athletics for the tenth consecutive year. Ballet was offered as a subject from 1997. =2000s= During 2003 local schools received police visits urging pupils to help fight crime. According to the testimony of Christoff Becker, son of Waterkloof's principal, dr. L. Christo Becker, this served as inspiration for two coordinated attacks on loitering black men in Constantia Park and Moreleta Park during the evening of 1 December 2003. Becker and three pupils of the school, the \\"Waterkloof Four\\", displayed defiance and arrogance in court and received 12-year prison sentences for assault and murder. A fourth pupil was acquitted for testifying against them. In 2007 the school reported alleged incidents of sexual misconduct by its pupils to the police. Older boys would have sexually abused younger boys while on a rugby bus tour. In 2008 the deputy headmaster dr. Louis Dey (45) sued three of the school's pupils for an amount of R600,000 after an incident in 2006 where they circulated a manipulated picture of him and the principal, dr. L. Christo Becker, which depicted them naked and engaged in a seemingly homosexual act. The three teenagers were ordered to pay R45,000 in damages for sending the image to hundreds of pupils via MMS and bluetooth, an amount which Dey described as \\"shockingly inappropriate\\". In 2009, following a forensic audit requested in December 2008, the governing body committee stepped in to manage the school after uncovering alleged financial irregularities spanning the years 2004 to 2008, which ran into millions of rand. The school principal, dr. L. Christo Becker, and his deputy, mr. André D. Eloff, resigned before they could be put on compulsory leave. Some irate parents claimed the money was used to bankroll the protracted legal battle to keep the principal's son Christoff out of prison, while the upmarket lifestyle of his deputy was also singled out. Dr. Becker was replaced by mr. Daan Potgieter. Early 2017, a married male teacher who was appointed less than a year earlier had to quit the school after his alleged intimate encounter with a grade ten pupil came to light. The incident of 2 February 2017 allegedly occurred in a classroom and was brought to the attention of the governing body by the principal. Its chairman disputed that the act was caught on camera or that it occurred following a \\"sokkie\\". In early 2019 the hostel was renamed Huis Kloofsig. The hostel also introduced a new \\"koshuisvader\\", Cobus van Dyk, who was the forwards coach of the SA Schools Rugby team. On 11 March 2020 a hacker gained access to Facebook and Instagram accounts used by the school to vent anger at conditions at the school, including a supposed drop in pass rate and the behaviour of fellow pupils and parents. Headmaster Chris H. Deneysschen replied by releasing a statement which labelled the breach as a cyber crime, but his deputy, Cobus van Dyk, claimed that the school suffered no damage to its reputation.

The 1956 film of the same name was \\"opened up\\" in the beginning to include scenes on the bus and in places away from the diner. Characters Bus Stop is a drama, with romantic and some comedic elements. It is set in a diner in rural Kansas, about 25 miles west of Kansas City, Missouri during a snowstorm from which bus passengers must take shelter. The characters are: * Grace Hoylard - Owner of the diner. She is 40ish, and pretty in a fading, hard-bitten way. She has a passionate side to her nature, loving a good fight and the attentions of a good man. * Elma Duckworth - An intelligent, but naive and impressionable high school girl. She is Grace's waitress. * Will Masters - The local sheriff. Brusque in manner, but goodhearted and a staunch Christian, described as a \\"deacon of his church\\". A highly \\"moral\\" man in the general sense of the word. * Dr. Gerald Lyman - A college philosophy professor who is articulate and charming but cannot hold a position, partially due to his resistance to any kind of authority, and partially due to his unfortunate taste for young women. He also has an obvious drinking problem. * Cherie - A pretty young woman who comes from a difficult \\"hill folk\\" background, and has left her innocence far behind. She is an aspiring nightclub singer, but has never worked in any establishment above the level of \\"cheap dive\\". * Bo Decker - A brash young cowboy with boorish manners that hide a naivete almost as profound as Elma's. He has convinced himself that Cherie will be his bride, though Cherie wants nothing to do with him. * Virgil Blessing - An older, wiser cowboy who has become a father figure to Bo (who was orphaned at the age of 10) as well as Bo's head ranch hand. * Carl - The bus driver, who has an ongoing \\"just passing through\\" relationship with Grace. As referenced repeatedly, this is purely sexual in nature. Synopsis The play is set in a diner about 25 miles west of Kansas City in early March 1955. A freak snowstorm has halted the progress of the bus, and the eight characters (five on the bus) have a weather-enforced layover in the diner from approximately 1 am to 5 am. Romantic or quasi-romantic relationships include Grace and Carl, Professor Lyman and Elma, and Cherie and Bo. Virgil and Will are the older authority figures outside the relationships. Broadway Bus Stop opened on March 2, 1955 and closed on April 21, 1956, running for a total of 478 performances. The opening night starred Albert Salmi as Bo and Kim Stanley as Cherie, and the play was directed by Harold Clurman. The play was nominated for four Tony Awards in 1956: Best Play (written by William Inge; produced by Robert Whitehead and Roger L. Stevens); Best Featured Actress in a Play (Elaine Stritch); Best Scenic Design (Boris Aronson); and Best Director (Harold Clurman). In 1996, there was a short-lived revival of the play that ran for 29 performances. There was also a musical, again involving Logan, titled Cherry (1972). Revivals In 2010 and 2011 Bus Stop received three productions in Great Britain including an acclaimed production directed by James Dacre that played at the New Vic and Stephen Joseph Theatres. The Guardian wrote of this production that \\"there is something beguiling about this forlorn slice of Americana, which mediates on the distances between towns and the distances between people, like an Edward Hopper painting with dialogue.\\" Film In 1956, Joshua Logan directed a film adaptation of the play starring Marilyn Monroe as Cheri and Don Murray as Bo. Television In August 1982, Bus Stop was presented on HBO, a special filmed performance of the play at the Claremont Theater in California, directed by Peter Hunt. It starred Tim Matheson as Bo Decker and Margot Kidder as Cherie. The play became a 26-episode American drama series that aired on ABC from October 1, 1961 until March 25, 1962.

He was purchased by Terri and Arthur Jones in 1985 and was kept in Ocala, Florida, for five years before being sold to the St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park in Florida. For 8 years he wowed spectators with both his amazing nutria-tossing abilities and his even more amazing tolerance of people. Feeders of the large croc were allowed to go into the enclosure and get as close as 1 metre from the large animal (a normally suicidal proximity) without any fear of attack. While feeders still used long tongs to feed Gomek, he was generally considered to be a \\"tame\\" crocodile and was the favorite of the alligator farm and people around the nation. After many years, Gomek died of heart disease on March 6, 1997. By then, he was a very old crocodile, and one of the largest and tamest captive crocodiles in existence. When he died, he was long, and weighed - as confirmed by St. Augustine Alligator Farm - and 80 years old. There is a tribute to Gomek near his enclosure, which now houses his successor Maximo and his mate Sydney.

The large mouth is turned upwards; the lower jaw contains an elongated, bony plate. The last ray of the dorsal fin is much longer than the others, reaching nearly to the tail. It is capable of filling its swim bladder with air and absorbing oxygen from it. Those living in fresh water tend to be smaller than the ones living in saltwater, growing just over , while saltwater examples grow over . They live upwards of 44 years and mature within two.

Juveniles of the species stay inshore and migrate to coastal areas while maturing to spawn. Typically, they spawn twice a year. At sea, the larvae migrate inland and are leptocephalic (flattened, transparent and eel-like). Unlike the barramundi, they are able to breed in fresh and salt water.Ley, J.A. 2008.

Distribution  The Indo-Pacific tarpon is found from the coasts of East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula to the coastal waters of South Asia, Southeast Asia, southern Japan, French Polynesia, and southern Australia. Their usual habitat is in coastal waters, estuaries and many miles upstream (from the estuaries) in freshwater rivers and lakes. They are amphidromus, i.e. they migrate from the river to the sea, and from the sea to the river. The tarpon lives in many tropical areas of Australia in the tropical, coastal, and brackish waters of the Indo-Pacific Ocean in both fresh and salt water. They are widely distributed from Australia, Japan, South and Southeast Asia and North Africa. Data are deficient on their population, as their commercial landings and human disturbances are unknown, but they are known to be extremely common throughout their range. Over 300 specimens are found in museums. Local names In Bengal, South Asia, they are known as koral fish (নানচিল কোরাল). In Malaysia, they were called ikan bulan(moon fish).

It is now part of the Archdiocese of Lyon. History Vienne Cathedral The legend according to which Crescens, the first Bishop of Vienne, is identical with the Crescens of Saint Paul's Second Letter to Timothy, iv, 20 certainly postdates the letter of Pope Zosimus to the Church of Arles (417) and the letter of the bishops of Gaul in 451; because, although both these documents allude to the claims to glory which Arles owes to St. Trophimus, neither of them mentions Crescens. Archbishop Ado of Vienne (860–875) set afoot this legend of the Apostolic origin of the See of Vienne and put down St. Zachary, St. Martin and St. Verus, later successors of Crescens, as belonging to the Apostolic period. This legend was confirmed by the Recueil des privilèges de l'Eglise de Viene, which, however, was not compiled under the supervision of the future Pope Callistus II, as M. Gundlach maintained, but a little earlier, about 1060, as Louis Duchesne proved. This collection contains the pretended letters of a series of popes, from Pius I to Paschal II, and sustains the claims of the Church of Vienne. Le Livre épiscopal de l'archevêque Léger (1030–1070) included both the inventions of Ado and the forged letters of the Recueil. It is historically certain that Verus, present at the Council of Arles (314), was the fourth Bishop of Vienne. In the beginning the twelve cities of the two Roman Vienne provinces were under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Vienne, but when Arles was made an archbishopric, at the end of the fourth century, the see of Vienne grew less important. The disputes that later arose between it and the metropolitan of Arles concerning their respective antiquity are well known in ecclesiastical history. In 450 Pope Leo I gave the Archbishop of Vienne the right to ordain the Bishops of Tarantaise, Valence, Geneva and Grenoble. Many vicissitudes followed, and the territorial limit of the powers of Metropolitan of Vienne followed the wavering frontier of the Kingdom of Burgundy and in 779, was considerably restricted by the organization of a new ecclesiastical province comprising Tarantaise, Aosta (in Italy) and Sitten (or Sion in French; in Switzerland). In 1120 Calixtus II, who had been Bishop of Vienne, decided that the Archbishop of Vienne should have for suffragans the Bishop of Grenoble, Bishop of Valence, Bishop of Die, Bishop of Viviers, Bishop of Geneva, and Bishop of Maurienne; that the Archbishop of Tarantaise should obey him, notwithstanding the fact that this archbishop himself had suffragans, that he should exercise the primacy over the province of Bourges, province of Narbonne, province of Bordeaux, province of Aix, province of Auch and province of Embrun, and that, as the metropolitans of both provinces already bore the title of primate, the Archbishop of Vienne should be known as the \\"Primate of Primates\\". In 1023 the Archbishops of Vienne became secular lords paramount. They had the title of Count, making them prince-archbishops, and when in 1033 the Kingdom of Arles was reunited to the Holy Roman Empire, they retained their independence and obtained from the empire the title of Archchancellors of the Kingdom of Arles (1157). Besides the four Bishops of Vienne heretofore mentioned, others are honoured as saints. According to the chronology created by M. Duchesne, they are: St. Justus, St. Dionysius, St. Paracodes, St. Florentius (about 374), St. Lupicinus, St. Simplicius (about 400), St. Paschasius, St. Nectarius, St. Nicetas (about 449), St. Mamertus (died 475 or 476), who instituted the rogation days, whose brother Claudianus Mamertus was known as a theologian and poet, and during whose episcopate St. Leonianus held for forty years the post of grand penitentiary at Vienne; St. Avitus (494 – 5 February, 518), St. Julianus (about 520–533), Pantagathus (about 538), Namatius (died 559), St. Evantius (died 584–586), St. Verus (586), St. Desiderius (Didier) 596–611, St. Domnolus (about 614), St. Ætherius, St. Hecdicus, St. Chaoaldus (about 654–664), St. Bobolinus, St. Georgius, St. Deodatus, St. Blidrannus (about 680), St. Eoldus, St. Eobolinus, St. Barnardus (810–841), noted for his conspiracies in favour of the sons of Louis the Pious, St. Ado (860–875), author of a universal history and two martyrologies, St. Thibaud (end of the tenth century). Among its later bishops were Guy of Burgundy (1084–1119), who became Pope Callixtus II; Christophe de Beaumont, who occupied the see of Vienne for seven months of the year 1745 and afterwards became Archbishop of Paris; Jean Georges Le Franc de Pompignan (1774–1790), brother of the poet and a great enemy of the \\"philosophers\\", and also d'Aviau (1790–1801), illustrious because of his strong opposition to the civil constitution of the clergy and the first of the émigré bishops to re- enter France (May, 1797), returning under an assumed name and at the peril of his life. Michael Servetus was living in Vienne, whither he had been attracted by Archbishop Pierre Palmier, when Calvin denounced him to the Inquisition for his books. During the proceedings ordered by ecclesiastical authority of Vienne, Servetus fled to Switzerland (1553). In 1605 the Jesuits founded a college at Vienne, and here Massillon taught at the close of the 17th century. The churches of Saint-Pierre and Saint-André le Haut are ancient Benedictine foundations. The famous council of Vienne was held at Vienne in 1311 (see also Templars). After the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801, the archiepiscopal title of Vienne passed to the see of Lyon, whose Metropolitan was henceforth called \\"Archbishop of Lyons and Vienne\\", although Vienne belongs to the Diocese of Grenoble.

This is a benchmark for test and tag as well as electrical safety and is referred to in many other New Zealand and Australian electrical standards. In-service safety inspection and testing of electrical equipment AS/NZS 3760:2010 provides a process to reduce the risk of electrical shock to users of electrical equipment. It also incorporates the physical safety of the item to be tested, and if the item is in an unsafe state there are actions and steps outlined to remedy this. The Standard covers electrical equipment that connects to the mains supply by a flexible cord and plug. Created to minimise electrical hazards in the workplace. Appliances are inspected for damage, and various measurements are made to the appliances' earth continuity, insulation, polarity, and physical condition. After testing has determined a pass, a tag must be attached to the appliance indicating when it was tested. Tags must have the following as minimum requirements * ‘Tested to AS/NZS 3760’ reference * Test Date (DD/MM/YY) * Retest Date (DD/MM/YY) * Name of Person or Company who carried out the testing * Appliance ID (asset number) * Be non-metallic * Non-reusable Retesting intervals of equipment can vary from 3 months to 5 years, depending of the environment where the equipment is located.

The first was for a low cost lightweight complement for the F-111B which could replace the F-4 Phantom II for air superiority, escort, and ground attack missions in the early 1960s. This role was dropped in favor of the VFX aircraft, which emerged as the F-14 Tomcat. The second VFAX evolved when the VFX proved too costly to replace all existing fighters and attack aircraft, and the Navy was invited to take part in the USAFs Lightweight Fighter Program (LWF). The Navy chose the \\"loser\\" of the LWF contest for its VFAX role as it was inherently more suitable to naval operations than the winner; it was redesigned to become the F/A-18 Hornet. Overview VFAX was essentially the Navy counterpart to the Air Force's FX study which eventually led to the F-15 Eagle air superiority fighter. The F-111B had no rear visibility and was found to be too heavy and ungainly in a dogfight. It was not even slated to carry a simple gun or AIM-9 Sidewinder normally carried by air superiority fighters like the F-8 Crusader. Even the F-4 Phantom II did not achieve the success that the US enjoyed over Korean MiGs. It was thought that a mix of F-111B and lighter advanced fighter bombers could handle all anticipated threats in close and long range combat. As a company project, Grumman was well aware of the limitations of the F-111B, but their approach to the VFAX was the Grumman 303 design. It essentially transplanted the engines and AWG-9/AIM-54 Phoenix weapons system of the F-111B into an agile airframe with the same tried and proved components of the A-6 Intruder, such as the landing gear and primary attitude reference. It would have to be capable of defeating the Soviet MiG-17 'Fresco' and MiG-19 'Farmer' fighters encountered by Navy pilots after 1965 over Vietnam. After 1967, it would also have to defeat the next generation Soviet fighters as well. By 1966,Flight International Magazine August 1966, Seattle Public Library main branch stacks the Navy had been persuaded that a single VFAX could meet the specification if it were large enough to carry the AWG-9/Phoenix weapons system. The VFAX was quickly dropped in favor of a hastily rewritten VFX specification which was largely built around the 303. The VFX, it was thought, was a better and cheaper alternative to a fleet of F-111B FADF (fleet air defence) dedicated interceptors and lighter fighter bombers. Needless to say, this greatly accelerated the need to cancel the now superfluous F-111B. In 2006, many on internet forums had expressed the common view that loiter, range, approach speed, and fleet air defence were the only design goals for the F-14. However, what is evidently the only surviving account of the VFAX specification. When the final classifications of the VAFX/VFX came out, it was composed of the following, with Air Superiority (Visual maneuvering close combat) as the first priority, ahead of FADF. # Air superiority # Fleet Air Defence FADF # Attack Escort # Air to Ground Attack # Long loiter time # Range # Approach speed to the carrier  Maneuverability  In order to avoid being forced to accept the F-X specification then being developed by the USAF, the Navy insisted on an airplane uncompromised by the air superiority requirements. This was actually a code phrase which meant retaining the primary FADF capability of the relatively heavy Phoenix missile. If the F-14 was created to shoot down bombers, and it was not optimized for maneuvering air combat as the primary design goal, it has even been suggested that the F-14's extraordinary maneuverability is due to the accident of a low approach speed requirement. However, the Grumman design was able to create a design in which the FDAF and AS requirements did not significantly compromise each other. The F-14 would use a wing sweep program to optimize lift and drag at all combat speeds, twin tails for stability, greatly reduced weight through extensive use of titanium to achieve a better thrust to weight ratio than the F-4, a pancake fuselage for increased lift, a raised tandem cockpit for reduced drag and increased visibility, a gun for close-in fighting, and widely spaced engines for weapons carriage and survivability. Though as the first of a new generation of air superiority fighters, it would be criticized for not possessing the desired 1:1 combat thrust to weight ratio as was intended in the proposed upgraded F-14B and F-14C, it would prove to be competitive in training against a variety of competitors throughout its service life, especially at low speeds with a fully forward wing at full afterburner. When accepted by the Navy after a competition, the VFAX and VFX would become the F-14 Tomcat, the first dedicated US Navy air superiority design since the F-8 Crusader. The F-14 would be tasked as the Navy's only primary air superiority fighter as well as FADF interceptor throughout its service life. Doctrine would strip the F-14 of any ground attack role until very late in its career, with the retirement of the A-6 Intruder and Air Force deployment of the similar F-15E Strike Eagle.  Revival  VFAX was revived in the 1970s when it was realized that although the F-14 was smaller than the F-111B, it was still a very large plane. It was a very expensive to replace all of the attack fighters and USMC F-4 Phantom IIs, which had passed on the Tomcat's cost and initial lack of ground attack capability (which the fighter wouldn't get until the 1990s). The VFAX would later be folded into the USAF LWF lightweight fighter competition. The Navy would choose the loser of the USAF competition, the YF-17. It was the product of a long evolution of the Northrop Cobra project, which was a radical redesign that used the wings and nose of the tiny F-5 Freedom Fighter as a design starting point. Attracted by the safety and growth potential of two engines, it was developed into the F/A-18 Hornet as the low end of a high low mix. Like the F-4 Phantom II, it would have conformal carriage for the radar guided AIM-7 Sparrow (and later AMRAAM) missiles. In the 1990s, the original Cobra design would be stretched yet again into the heavier Super Hornet. The F/A-18E/F would be deemed by 2006 to have enough capability to replace its senior stablemate, the VFX F-14 Tomcat in the primary air superiority role, along with most other jet combat, EW and tanker support types. Dogged by complaints that the F-18 lacked \\"legs\\" or range, the Navy later opted for the F/A-18E/F to replace the A-12 Avenger, which in turn was meant to replace the A-6 Intruder. While there were no precise reasons, the Navy and the Secretary of Defense opted to buy no more new Tomcats or its variants. While the Navy studied a swing wing version of the Air Force F-22, they opted not to develop a direct replacement of the F-14 Tomcat. The fire and forget capability of the new AMRAAM missile would give the Super Hornet much of the capability of the powerful, but old AIM-54 Phoenix system. Together with the F/A-18A and the anticipated retirement of other aircraft types, Hornets and Super Hornets will take on roles of aircraft since Vietnam of the A-1, A-4 and A-7 light attack, F-8 light, F-4 medium, and F-14 heavy fighters, RA-5C and RF-8 reconnaissance, KA-3 and KA-6 tankers, EA-6B jammers, and S-3 ASW aircraft, or just about all jet combat aircraft roles.

The black pattern consists of a band across the apex of the tergite (on its discal part only, not extending to the sides), and stripe down the centre of the tergite, and a black band across the full width of the base. Due to the black pattern described above, the main yellow areas on these tergites are at the sides of the insect but they are fairly prominent due to their large size, and their bright colour. At the basal margin of these tergites there is usually a narrow yellow border. This border is usually slightly thicker on the third tergite, where it is also more obvious as the front of tergite four is wholly black, thus enhancing the contrast of the feature. The only other Helophilus-species having this yellow border is Helophilus hybridus, but males of such species differs from pendulus-males in the black band at base of the tergite two not extending to the sides. The yellow pattern here is usually a bright, slightly orangey yellow (unlike the paler lemon yellow of trivittatus). Tergite four is largely black, with isolated dull yellow crescentic markings on each side. Females have yellow hairs on the hind part of tergite five, unlike H. hybridus females, in which these hairs are black due to certain biological adapments. The legs possess patterning which differ from the other species in the genus. First, the hind tibia of pendulus has at least the apical half (usually all except the basal third) pale yellow, whereas other species, such as H. hybridus and H. groenlandicus have pale yellow only on the apical third or less. The middle tibia of pendulus is wholly pale, unlike H. groenlandicus, on which it has a dark apex. The mid-tarsi have extensive dark markings on at least their distal segments, unlike trivittatus which usually has wholly pale mid-tarsi. =Larvae= Ecology and behaviour It is associated with a wide variety of waterbodies, from large lakes and rivers down to areas as small as ditches, small ponds and muddy puddles. Larvae have been found in cow-dung, very wet manure or very wet old sawdust. This species visits flowers; it also commonly rests on leaves. It often emits a buzzing sound when resting. It is a notable wanderer and can be found well away from water. The larvae feed on detritus. H. pendulus female rests on a leaf References References Citations  Stubbs, Alan E. and Steven J.

He won the 1982 and 1989 Kate Greenaway Medals for British children's book illustration and he was a commended runner up five times (a distinction dropped after 2002). For his contribution as a children's illustrator he was U.K. nominee in 1988 and again in 2010 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest recognition available to creators of children's books. Life He was born and grew up in Pakefield, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, where his mother kept the village shop. His father died a month before he was born. At the age of three, the family home was hit by an enemy bomb, but he survived along with his mother and two older brothers. He studied at Lowestoft School of Art, and later in London at the Royal College of Art, where he won a scholarship to the United States. He married his first wife, author Jane Charters, in 1959. Their son Mark was born the following year. He lives in London (2010). Approach to illustration Michael learned to respond instantly to text as an art student.\\"Michael Foreman\\". Magic Pencil. The British Library. Having drawn for the newspapers and for the police, drawing female suspects when Identikit only catered for men, he gained valuable drawing experience. A travel scholarship took him all around the world, drawing landscapes, architecture and wildlife. Although many of his books feature luminous watercolours, it is the drawing that he sees as vital: \\"It's all in the drawing and illustration. It's a question of creating another world, believable in its own right. I think I was very lucky to have started art school so young when they actually taught Art. It was a rigorous training - not just painting and drawing from life - but hours of anatomy and perspective. ... it really taught you to understand what you were looking at.\\" His aim in illustration is to make the worlds created believable, real: \\"I keep trying to make things more real, not in a literal photographic sense, but in an emotional sense, telling a story by capturing the essence of the situation, giving it some meaning.\\" Selected works = 1960s = * 1961 Comic Alphabets: Their origin, development, nature (illustrator) Routledge & Kegan Paul (), by Eric Partridge * 1961 The

The school mascot is the Eagle and the school colors are teal, black, and white. History The school started as an outgrowth of Living Word Christian School, an elementary school in Saint Peters, Missouri in St. Charles County. In 1999, Tom Hughes donated of real estate to Living Word. With the help of donations, work was soon completed on the building. As of the 2013–14 school year, they joined forces with Westgate Christian Academy to create one school. Sports As of the 2008–2009, the school has been a member of the Missouri State High School Activities Association. This allows the athletic teams to compete on a higher level against larger private and smaller public schools. Their soccer team is coached by Blake Smith and David Watts. The soccer team has won districts four years in a row. Their cheerleaders compete at a national level and in 2010 received 7th place in their division nationally. The cheerleaders are coached by Cherie Danforth. Their dance team started in 2003, and now competes at a local level through MSHSAA. They are coached by Genie Meadows. Currently the school has both girls and boys soccer, volleyball, basketball, and track/cross country. There is also football and baseball for boys. Cheerleading, dance, and softball teams are available for girls. The golf team is co-ed but it is male dominated.

They are related to other Oromo people living in northern Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, with whom they share a common language and cultural heritage.Kelly, 1992: 20. First and foremost they are pastoralists and almost all, if not all, of them are muslims.Kelly, 1992:20-21. In 2019 the Tana Orma numbered 158,993.See: https://web.archive.org/web/20131121153548/http://www.knbs.or.ke/censusethnic.php Terminology The literature on the Galla, Orma, Oromo, Warra Daya, Wardey (Wardai, Waridei, and Wardeh) shows that the terminology is extremely confusing. Therefore, first a few comments concerning the terminology. In the oldest literature, the Cushitic speaking people who nowadays are identified as the Orma and Oromo speaking people were called Warra Daya. This name was used by the Somali for the Oromo or Southern Galla living in Jubaland. In the colonial literature these people are called the Galla. The Oromo never called themselves Galla as they considered the name offensive.In an ethnographic journal it was vaguely ('may be') argued that the name Galla is an Oromo word, adopted by neighbours, for there is a word galla \\"wandering\\" or \\"to go home\\" in their language (International African Institute Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5, Issue 2 (1969): The Galla of Ethiopia; The Kingdoms of Kafa and Janjero: North Eastern Africa Part II: 11). Schlee (1992) called most etymological explanations for the name Galla ‘silly’. In his opinion this applies also for explanations as ‘free men’ and ‘the sons of men’. In the middle of the twentieth century, following the principle that the name a people use for themselves is to be taken in for official and scientific use, the name Galla was slowly replaced by Oromo.Schlee (1997. There exist no agreed-upon etymology for this name and both Orma and Oromo are used, although the spelling Oromo is preferred since the second half of the twentieth century. For the group of people discussed here the name Orma is used as this is their self-chosen name. The name Orma forms enough contrast to other tribes in the area, but if we want to distinguish them from other Orma and Oromo and want to prevent confusion, we should specify them as the Tana Orma.Schlee (1992: 4) argues this strongly. In practice many authors who wrote about this group of people had already done this. For instance, Turnton, 1970 and Kelly, 1992. The Somali still call the Tana Orma Wardey or Warra-Daya. However, the Tana Orma restrict the name Wardey to back-migrants who had lived as serfs under the Somali and who were descendants of Orma captives.Schlee, 1992: 4). History =Overview= The Warra Daya were first mentioned in an Arabic source in the 15th century. According to Turnton they migrated into the Juba area in the 16th century. In the early 19th century they were at the height of their power when they inhabited almost all of Jubaland (roughly Northern and Eastern Kenya and Western Somalia).Turnton,1970: 60 In the 19th century the Darod Somali, particular Ogaden, advanced southwards across the Juba River. A first attempt in 1842 failed, but in 1844 they tried again and were allowed to enter as clients (shegats).Turnton, 1970: 73. The usual method of Darod penetration into a new area was to adopt a client relationship with the people already there. In practice this meant that they became herdsboys who were allowed to keep some animals of their own. Then these clients slowly consolidated their numbers until they had achieved parity with or even superiority over the original inhabitants. Around 1865, when a small pox epidomology weakened the Warra Daya, they were attacked by Darod from the North and to a lesser extend by the Kamba from the West and Masai from the South. The Darod clients joined the conflict and this explained the severity of the conflict and the heavy defeats of the Warra Daya. In 1867 the Somali invited the Warra Daya elders for a great peace offering, which was accepted by the Warra Daya. However, the feast turned out to be an ambush and thousands of Warra Daya were slaughtered. The offering was followed by extensive Somali raids. Most of the remaining Warra Daya were forced to cross the River Tana and sought refuge along the southern and eastern bank of the Tana River. Large numbers of especially the Orma men, were killed and an estimated 8,000 women and children were captured.Schlee, 1992: 7-8. Lewis has analysed why the Orma were defeated so badly and mentioned that the Somali had better weapons, sometimes they used horses and, above all, had higher numbers. Moreover, their area was large and the main body of the Orma lived elsewhere, hence it was difficult for the Tana Orma to request assistance (Lewis,1965: 32).The Orma also repeatedly requested assistance from the Europeans, which they did not get. In practice, their presence contributed to the decline of the Orma. These women and children were either clientized by the Somali or sold as slaves. Since there was a shortage of women under the Somali, they took Orma women as their concubines and some of them were even married by the Somali. In order to protect the remaining free Warra Daya on the east bank of the Tana from the Somali, in 1909 the few remaining Warra Daya on the east bank of the Tana were moved by the British to the west bank. These Warra Daya on the west bank became known as the Tana Orma. The decimation of the Tana Orma had also the result that they had become an isolated ethnical group that no longer shared a border with other Oromo speaking people. =Somali-Galla agreement and the Wardey= Already in the 19th century there were regularly discussions whether the British should ignore slavery in Juba area or should take action against it. Theoretically, the British were opposed to any form of slavery, but in practice they condoned it, also because they would not be capable to enforce any agreement with the Somali if abolishment of slavery would be a pre- condition.Turnton, 1970: 146-147, 160 and 221. When Kenya became a British protectorate, this discussion resurfaced as it was seen as shameful to have slavery in the British empire. In Tana River District and the North Eastern Province this discussion focused around the position of the clientized Orma amongst the Somali community. It was clear that the Orma clients had not become clients out of their free will, were in fact serfs and could not leave the Somali. Since these Orma clients were, as long as they adhered to paying tribute and ‘symbolic’ submission, often allowed to live in their own villages and keep livestock. An aspect of the 'symbolic' submission was that Orma girls should always have their first sexual intercourse with a Somali. The children of these women were often considered Somali and it enriched the Ogaden with a mixed population.Schlee, 1989: 43. With some pressure of the British the Somali agreed to the Somali-Galla agreement, which stated that the Orma could return to their brothers on the right bank of the Tana, provided they left half of their livestock with the Somali. This agreement also implied clearly that the Somali should remain on the left bank of the Tana.The Britisch always feared that the Somali would cross the Tana. Turnton describes this extensively (Turnton,1970: 501-502). A good number of the enslaved Orma returned, but since the British had limited military power, they were not in a position to guarantee a return of all the Orma who wanted to cross the river.Unknown, 1932 and 1932. Darroch, et al. Initially these back-migrants were called Wardey, also written as Waridei Wardeh and Wardei, etc. In 1939 the Somali refuted the Somali-Galla agreement and no clientized Orma crossed the Tana until after Independence. =Independence= After the Independence of Kenya (1963), many of the remaining clientized Orma returned and this explains the huge population increase of the Orma.Kelly, 1990: 82. In 1971 President Kenyatta officially welcomed the Wardey.Kelly, 1992: 359. Nowadays the term Wardey is mainly used for the clients who returned after Independence. Most of them do not speak Orma. The ones that migrated back during the colonial time are called Orma. Population figures Early population figures of the Tana Orma are scanty. The colonial government estimated the number in 1926 at 2,394.Rowland, 1955: 24-5. In 1932 they were estimated at 5,000. This increase was due to the return of Wardey. The first full count of the Orma took place in 1962. Their number was counted as 15,985 of which 96% lived in Tana River District, 2% in other Coast districts and 1.5% in Garissa. The remaining 0.5% lived scattered over Kenya. In 1979 they were estimated at 32,000.Kelly, 1992: 20. Between 1969 and 1979 their increase was 96%, whereas other ethnical groups as the Pokomo in Tana River County had only a population increase of 12%. This large increase was again due to the back-migration and Somali disguised as Wardey. This ‘back-migration’ has continued since.This census did not have a category Wardey and these people were recorded as Orma, Somali or other Kenyans. People who might call themselves in the Northern Eastern Province Somali, might call themselves Orma in Coast Province. In 2009 the Orma were counted as 74,146.This figure includes the Galla. In 2019 their number was 158,993. For the first time the category Wardey was available under the main category Orma and 65,965 of the Orma categorized themselves as Wardey.Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, 2019, Volume IV: 423. Religion The Tana Orma converted relatively recently to the Islam and primarily after the 1920s and en masse in the 1930s and 1940 and since then almost all are Islamic.Kelly, 1992: 301. Culture Both sexes are circumcised and the Tana Orma strictly adhere to marrying outside their moiety, a universally practised custom by all Oromo speaking people.Kelly, 1992. Livelihood Although originally the Orma were pastoralists, they have now become increasingly sedentarized and economically diversified. The majority, however, is still pastoralist. The Orma pattern of seasonal livestock movement is based on alternating use of riverine floodplain pastures in the dry season and more arid pastures with scattered wells and ponds in the wet season.Kelly, 1992: 21> Conflicts between the Tana Orma and other ethnical groups Especially since the collapse of the Somali state in the nineties, regularly there were conflicts between the Orma, Wardey and Somali in Tana River County. In 2012-13 serious conflicts broke out between the Pokomo and Orma resulting in almost 200 dead people.Kirchner, 2013: i and 3) The cause of the conflicts were Orma people encroaching on the Pokomo agricultural area. Two factors have contributed to the transformation of the previous fairly harmonious relationship of the two into very antagonistic conflicts.Townsend, 1978). First the population increase has caused pressure on the limited resources. Secondly the Orma have been pushed southwards by Wardey and Somali people. Since these groups are often better armed, the Orma did not have an alternative but to move southwards, which brought them into conflict with the Pokomo.Kirchner, 2013: 76 and 94-5.

Background Green Island, or Al Jazeera Al Khadraa, was a fortress built by British forces during World War II. Located south of the city of Suez and the mouth of the Suez Canal, it was a series of concrete bunkers sitting atop an seawall, ringed by razor wire three rolls deep. Only long and wide, the island was heavily defended. Its garrison consisted of approximately seventy Egyptian infantrymen and twelve As-Sa'iqa commandos, fourteen machine gun positions, two 37-mm anti-aircraft guns, and four 85-mm anti-aircraft guns. The island and surrounding area were within range of both Israeli and Egyptian artillery sited on opposite shores of the gulf. Though the destruction of Egyptian early warning radar and ELINT sites was an ongoing goal during this period, known as the War of Attrition, the raid was as much prompted by a wish to send a \\"message\\" to Egypt as it was the actual destruction of the military targets. IDF Chief of Staff Chaim Bar Lev and Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan together decided that Egypt should be shown that no Egyptian position was safe, no matter how well-fortified or impregnable. As a target, Green Island fulfilled both goals. Green Island could have been more easily attacked by Israeli artillery or aircraft with less risk to Israeli life, but a commando raid would send a clear message and, it was hoped, have a negative effect on Egyptian military forces' morale. Prelude It was decided that the operation would be a combined operation, split between elements of Israel's Sayeret Matkal General Staff Reconnaissance unit and Shayetet 13 Naval Commandos.The Israeli Commando Assault on Green Island Lieutenant Colonel Zeev Almog commanded the operation. The specific priorities were set at destruction of the 85 mm anti-aircraft guns, then the main northern building, then the radar and ELINT site. The plan called for the Naval Commandos, using Zodiac inflatable boats, to lead the first of two waves in the assault. The second wave, by Sayeret Matkal, would consist of commandos, command and control and medical teams, and an extraction team. The second wave commandos would arrive to carry the fight just as the first wave ran low on ammunition. Battle The first wave consisted of four teams of two officers and three commandos each and departed from the vicinity of Ras Sudar on the east bank of the Gulf of Suez at 2030. They approached to within of the island by boat, then swam, first on the surface and once closer underwater using rebreathers. Each man carried of equipment. They surfaced at the island 8 minutes behind schedule, at 0138. The delay was caused by a more difficult swim than anticipated due to the currents. The first team breached the barbed wire allowing the second team to move in and counter the initial Egyptian response. The third team then crossed a small bridge and destroyed a defensive and observation tower and radar facility. The fourth team cleared a building to the north. Half the raiders cleared or blocked the southern half of the island, the fortress, while the other half eliminated the radar and anti-aircraft equipment. This was complicated by the fact that most of their hand grenades were rendered useless by the swim at deeper than expected depths due to each man's heavy load. This breaching of the island's defences was supported by a separate Naval Commando team providing covering fire and diversion with a bazooka and a light machine gun from a small rock outcropping just south of the island, having reached it by Swimmer Delivery Vehicles (SDV). At this point the commander of the first wave, Lieutenant Dov Bar, signalled the second wave to come in using a flare. To avoid catching the approaching second wave in a cross fire a second flare by Bar signalled the covering fire and diversion team on the rock outcropping to stand down and withdraw, which they did successfully. The second wave, which had been idling in their Zodiacs in the Gulf, now trailing the first wave's recovered boats, roared up to the island. They quickly set up a command post and aid station and took out the 85 mm gun emplacements. Not much larger than a football field, all combat on the island was conducted at close range. The Egyptian response to the first wave was uncoordinated at first, then became fierce, employing heavy and light machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. After the arrival of the second wave, the efforts of the defenders became sporadic and again uncoordinated, with some jumping from bunkers into the sea, and eventually calling in artillery on their own position. The extraction was ordered at 0215.The Israeli Commando Assault on Green Island By 0255 the teams were aboard the Zodiacs and heading for the eastern bank of the Gulf, having lost one Zodiac at the island to Egyptian artillery fire. At 0310, with the Israeli commandos still crossing the Gulf, satchel charges left on the island detonated destroying the remaining facilities.The Israeli Commando Assault on Green Island Egyptian artillery now shelled both the Zodiacs and the beachheads set up to receive them, driving several boats away and delaying their landings while they searched for alternate beaches to divert to. Another Zodiac was lost when it was abandoned by its team less than 400 meters from Green Island, but the team was recovered by helicopter at 0500 after spending several hours swimming toward the eastern shore. Aftermath The result of the raid was the destruction of the entire Egyptian facility at Green Island. Israeli casualties were three Sayeret Matkal and three Shayetet 13 commandos killed, and eleven wounded—a casualty rate of approximately fifty percent. Egyptian casualties were 80 killed (almost the entire garrison) and an unknown number wounded. A number of the Egyptian casualties were caused by friendly fire; the shelling of the island by their own artillery. Following the raid the Israeli Air Force exploited the hole in Egyptian air defenses to launch Operation Boxer, engaging the Egyptian Air Force in over 300 dogfights and bombing raids. Naval Commando conducted another 80 raids along the Suez Canal until the 1970 cease-fire ended the War of Attrition.

In 1959, he published 'The Manifesto of the Khmer Serei' claiming that Sihanouk was supporting the 'communization' of Kampuchea.Ben Kiernan. How Pol Pot Came to Power: Colonialism, Nationalism, and Communism in Cambodia, 1930-1975, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985), p.47 In the 1960s, the Khmer Serei were accumulating in numbers and were on their way to becoming a formidable fighting force. The primary objective of the Khmer Serei was to destabilize the existing powers held by the then-Cambodian leader, King Norodom Sihanouk and to overthrow his reign - and to become a permanent part of the Cambodian body politic.Robert L. Turkoly-Joczik. The Khmer Serei Movement, Asian Affairs, Vol. 15, No. 1 (Spring, 1988), p.48 The Khmer Serei's relative lack of resources, poor timing and lack of dominance as compared to the Khmer Rouge majority and political support from Sihanouk, eventually led to their decline. Their goals, therefore were never brought to fruition. Beginnings - before 1950s According to Turkoly-Joczik's essay, the beginnings of the Khmer Serei's dissidences date back to periods before the Second Indochina War, tracing its origins back to Vietnam's Mekong Delta, in the town of Tra Vinh, Vinh Binh Province, the birthplace of Son Ngoc Thanh. In examining the political ambitions of Son Ngoc Thanh, we will better understand the reasons for the eventual formation of the Khmer Serei and their activities. Son Ngoc Thanh did his studies in France. When he returned to Vietnam, he attempted to join the French Colonial Service but was declined. He then moved to Cambodia in the early 1930s, and secured a secretarial position in the Cambodian Buddhist Institute. While at the institute, he took the opportunity of his position as secretary and empowered patriotic monks to spread Buddhist and nationalistic sermons throughout Cambodia and into the Mekong Delta. In 1936, Thanh founded a newspaper to carry out his anti-French and pro-independence views and was involved in anti-French demonstrations. Thanh fled to Japan to escape possible imprisonment by the French and joined the Imperial Japanese Army as a commissioned officer. Thanh returned to Cambodia and, with support from Japan, started his political career. Thanh eventually held positions of Foreign Minister and later on as Prime Minister of Cambodia. However, his position as Prime Minister was short-lived. Thanh was arrested and put on trial for treason.William Shawcross. Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia, (London: The Hogarth Press, 1986), p.47 After the trial, he was put on house arrest in France. While on house arrest, a group of his supporters with military support were recruiting and establishing themselves near the border provinces of Thailand, Cambodia and South Vietnam. These militant supporters of Thanh were known as the Khmer Issarak (“independent” Khmer), who shared Thanh's pro-independence goals. The Khmer Issarak were armed bands active within Cambodian borders during the later French colonial period.Robert L. Turkoly-Joczik. The Khmer Serei Movement, Asian Affairs, Vol. 15, No. 1 (Spring, 1988), p.49 The armed struggles with the French caused serious disruption to the Cambodian economy in 1946-1947.David P. Chandler. A History of Cambodia, (Colorado: Westview Press, 1983) p.178-179, Khmer Issarak and the formation of Khmer Serei in 1950s Thanh's political supporters gained control of the Democratic Party and won the national election of September 1951. Facing mounting political pressure, Sihanouk was forced to request Thanh's release from house arrest. Thanh was eventually released the next month. Upon his return to Cambodia, Thanh resumed his political activities and founded a newspaper whose rhetoric angered Sihanouk and his French advisers, thereby risking imprisonment. In order to avoid arrest, Thanh fled to the Cambodian jungles and took refuge with the Khmer Issarak. During this period, the Khmer Issarak was believed to be about three thousand strong with a substantial percentage with access to military arms. From 1952 to 1954, the Khmer Issarak carried out small-scale attacks against local police and initiated audio broadcasts of anti-Sihanouk propaganda messages along the Thai-Cambodian border. Strategically, they operated mainly from bases on the Thai and Vietnamese borders, recruiting from the Khmer Krom minority of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. However, things were not going as planned for Thanh. By 1955, Sihanouk had put a dent in the Khmer Issarak forces by offering amnesty to those who would return to the \\"national\\" fold. Clearly Thanh had underestimated Sihanouk's influence and large numbers of Khmer Issarak had put down their arms. Realizing the error, Thanh attempted to reconcile with Sihanouk but was not successful in doing so. Therefore, in 1956, with aid from American, he created the Khmer Serei movement - uniting the remaining Issarak factions. While Thanh and his forces were receiving aid from the Americans, it was believed that these actions led to the tarnishing of his image among Cambodians.Marie A. Martin. Cambodia: A Shattered Society, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), p.46 Between 1955 and 1959, Thanh was to remain in the forest to organise guerrilla warfare and propaganda activities against Sihanouk. The Khmer Serei continued to be a source of disturbance to the Sihanouk government, organizing dissident activities along the border provinces of Cambodia. More significantly, many of these Issarak leaders would become key actors in the events of late 1960s and 1970s, as the old Issarak divisions re-formed as the Khmer Rouge, Khmer Serei and the lesser-known White Khmers.Eve, M, Zucker. Forest of Struggle: Moralities of Remembrance in Upland Cambodia, (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2013), p.33-34 The Khmer Serei and major events in the 1960s By the 1960s, the Khmer Serei continued to recruit new members from the Khmer Krom. With the experiences gained during the last decade, they had become conditioned into a well-trained force, both disciplined and well-armed.Justin J. Corfield. Khmers Stand Up!: A History of the Cambodian Government 1970-1975, (Melbourne: Monash University, 1994), p.56 During this time, Sihanouk's increasing unpredictability resulted in a trickle of young men and women fading into the forest, joining Thanh's cause, possibly causing the Khmer Serei numbers to swell.William Shawcross. Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia, (London: The Hogarth Press, 1986), p.51 In 1961, Sihanouk severed diplomatic relations with Bangkok over the 'Thai support' provided to the Khmer Serei.Ben Kiernan. How Pol Pot Came to Power: Colonialism, Nationalism, and Communism in Cambodia, 1930-1975, (New Haven: Yale University Press), 1985, p.194 By 1963, Thanh strategically moved the Khmer Serei moved back to South Vietnam for financial and material support from the Saigon government. Moving back to the Mekong Delta area gave Thanh the potential to recruit new members from the large populations of Khmer Kroms living there. In addition, the U.S. Special Forces and its Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) would become its allies, and recruited the Khmer Serei into its ranks. The recruited members maintained their membership to Khmer Serei and were also obligated to bear arms for the Saigon government. This was beneficial on two fronts: firstly, the monetary rewards from joining the CIDG were more regular and higher than what they previously obtained and therefore many were recruited; secondly, the Khmer Serei was able to maintain its identity and building itself as a single cohesive force. Although there is no official documentation that shows the organisational working structure and functional responsibilities of the Khmer Serei movement, there is one cited source derived from personal observation: The movement's military organisation coincided with the structure of the CIDG, that is, the Khmer Serei were organised into platoons, companies and battalions. Whether this was coincidental, or to accommodate the CIDG, is unknown.Robert L. Turkoly- Joczik.The Khmer Serei Movement, Asian Affairs, Vol. 15, No. 1 (Spring, 1988), p.52 Therefore, it was possible that their leader, Thanh had indeed maintain tight control over the group but it was structurally led by junior leaders in their respective military units. According to sources, the Khmer Serei headquarters was located at the Cambodian Buddhist compound and supported by field headquarters on the Cambodian border at the South Vietnamese village of Tinh Bien, in close proximity to the Seven Mountains region of the border. With exception of the independent Khmer Serei units along the border, virtually all of the other Khmer Serei personnel were associated with the U.S. Army Special Forces’ activities conducted in the Mekong Delta. It is estimated that at least fifty percent of all Khmer Krom CIDG soldiers were also members of the Khmer Serei. The Khmer Serei also had loose links with the US-backed Front de Lutte du Kampuchea Krom militia, or \\"White Scarves\\" (; ), of Southern Vietnam. This group, founded by a Khmer Krom monk named Samouk Sen, sought Khmer Krom independence and regularly clashed with the Viet Cong: it expanded in the 1960s and later became affiliated to FULRO, a paramilitary organisation for Vietnamese minority groups. Members of both the Khmer Kampuchea Krom and the Khmer Serei were trained by the US military for clandestine operations during the Second Indochina War as part of MIKE Force, and were partly financed and armed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).Vietnam Studies, U.S. Army Special Forces 1961-1971, CMH Publication 90-23, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C. 1989 (First Printed, 1973) At their peak in 1968, the Khmer Serei and related forces were thought to number up to 8000 men.Michael Radu. The New Insurgencies, (New Jersey: Transaction Publishers, 1990), p.202 The Khmer Serei participated in a number of general intelligence gathering missions. It is believed that they assisted Project GAMMA, an intelligence gathering mission on the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) bases in Cambodia, as well as providing support to Cambodia against the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, one of these activities from Project Gamma was Operation Cherry. It was also suggested that the Khmer Serei were involved in making liaison with unnamed units in Cambodia as part of intelligence gathering on the North Vietnamese Army's dispositions and to develop a strategy for the Cambodian Army movements. The Khmer Serei knew the terrain and language well and therefore were invaluable to the mission. According to one U.S. Army commander, the Khmer Serei were good soldiers: They knew the border area, could communicate with the local populations, and could get intelligence about the Viet Cong and what they were doing in their sanctuaries across the border.Robert L. Turkoly-Joczik. The Khmer Serei Movement, Asian Affairs, Vol. 15, No. 1 (Spring, 1988), p.57 In addition, member of the Khmer Serei has anti-communist contacts in the Cambodian Army who were sympathetic to any plan to rid Cambodia of the North Vietnamese presence. The information provided would have been crucial to the success of any plan for a military incursion into Cambodia, and it gives an indication of the importance of the Khmer Serei's role in Operation Cherry. Sihanouk government's response to the Khmer Serei movement The Khmer Serei were generally viewed as a minor irritant by the media but Sihanouk was infuriated by its existence and by its clandestine radio broadcast emanating from the Thai and South Vietnamese borders, which made scurrilous attacks on him and the royal family.David P. Chandler. The Tragedy of Cambodian History: Politics, War and Revolution since 1945, (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980), p.131 Therefore, the Cambodian leadership took serious and active measures to stop them. To Sihanouk, the rebels were 'traitors to the constitution and the nation'.Ellen J. Hammer. The Struggle for Indochina, (California: Stanford University Press), p.261 Sihanouk saw the Khmer Serei as a genuine threat and therefore the Cambodian regime viewed the insurgency seriously: allegations later surfaced that Sihanouk had executed as many as 1000 Khmer Serei suspects during his rule. This was evident in the events which led to the 1963 arrest, public caging and subsequent execution of Preap In, a Khmer Serei activist who had offered to go to the National Assembly to negotiate directly with Sihanouk, was a prominent example of the Sangkum's repression of the Khmer Serei.1964: Preap In, Khmer Serei operative, Executed Today (blog), January 20, 2013, http://www.executedtoday.com/2013/01/20/1964-preap-in-sihanouk-cambodia The execution of In, a former member of the Democratic Party, was filmed and shown in all cinemas for a month, an event which remained in the memories of Cambodians for many years.Philip Short. Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare, (New York: Henry Holt, 2005), p.156 Mass defection of Khmer Serei and dissolution in 1969 In early 1969, five hundred Khmer Serei soldiers defected from South Vietnam to Cambodia.William Shawcross. Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia, (London: The Hogarth Press, 1986), p.119-120 The defectors were welcomed back to Cambodia and were integrated into the Cambodian armed forces. There were two suggested theories about these defections: the first was that Son Ngoc Thanh had order five hundred men to defect so that the Khmer Serei could infiltrate the Cambodian forces and subvert Sihanouk's government; the second was that the defectors were actually employed by the CIA in order to reinforce Lon Nol and his forces when they made their move to depose Sihanouk. The rationale to these defections were never explained by the CIA or Thanh; however, these defectors did support Lon Nol's government to fight against the North Vietnamese forces based in Cambodia. Therefore, the defection of five hundred soldiers should be viewed as a military action that deserves merit. They were effectively used by Lon Nol to reinforce his own forces and later used to strengthen the Cambodian Army in its battle against the North Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge. However, in the same year, Thanh formally announced the dissolution of the Khmer Serei organisation and pledged support to the Lon Nol government, and was made special councilor to Lon Nol and later as Prime Minister of Cambodia. Khmer Serei in the 1970s After the Cambodian coup of 1970, the Khmer Serei participated in the Second Indochina War. It was believed that at least three battalions, consisting approximately 1500 Khmer Serei troops re-enforced the US-supported Vietnamese troops in Cambodia. The troops were ready and could be inserted by air into Phnom Penh. Lon Nol saw the elite Khmer Serei troops as a political threat and inserted them into the worst 'meat-grinder' battles and few Khmer Serei soldiers survived these 'suicide missions'.William Shawcross. Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia, (London:The Hogarth Press, 1986), p.131-132 After the war, Khmer Serei forces remain stunted and underdeveloped. Their efforts to achieve political and economic breakthroughs after the coup proved to be disastrous - instead of political freedom, they found themselves under the direct control of Lon Nol. Many of their leading members were arrested or killed.Stephen Heder. Kampuchean Occupation and Resistance, (Bangkok: Chulalongkorn University, 1980), p.83 Following the 1975 Khmer Rouge victory and the proclamation of Democratic Kampuchea, the few remaining \\"Free Khmer\\" operating in the north-west, in the area of the Dangrek Mountains, found themselves mostly in refugee camps along the Thai-Cambodian border, such as Nong Chan and Nong Samet. After the fall of Cambodia in 1975, the Khmer Serei or groups identifying themselves as Khmer Serei became a source of disruption along the Thai-Cambodian border. The Khmer Serei had become highly fractionized and seemingly without an overall leader. During this period, the Khmer Serei had been reduced to 'a collection of petty warlord movements' that operated along the Thai-Kampuchean frontier.Stephen Heder. Kampuchean Occupation and Resistance, (Bangkok: Chulalongkorn University , 1980), p.80 At various intervals during the 1980s, these groups composed of Khmer Rouge and various pro-Sihanouk or pro-Son Sann factions conducted sporadic military activities against President Heng Samrin’s Vietnamese-sponsored People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). Son Sann was to use some of these former Khmer Serei supporters as the basis of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front movement, formed in 1979.Roger Kershaw. Monarchy in South-East Asia: The Faces of Tradition in Transition, (London: Routledge, 2001), p.221 Without Son Ngoc Thanh, the movement lacked a central command to coordinate its combat operation, public information, and recruitment. As a consequence, those calling themselves Khmer Serei had become no more than groups of independent free agents. It was also reported that a number of the remaining Khmer Serei groups has become ‘little more than black marketeers or bands of extortionists’ who preyed on the defenseless in the border refugee camps. Other reports informed of internal fighting between different Khmer Serei groups and were not longer a ‘united cohesive force’ against the forces of Heng Samrin. In the words of Turkoly-Joczik, \\"like many dissident movements in Cambodia, the Khmer Serei has become an aberration, a political anomaly that haunts the Cambodian hinterlands as a specter of lost hope and a promise unfulfilled.\\" Notes References # Chandler, D.

The feature presentation of the DVD follows the band on their United States tour that spanned from April 1 to May 2 of 2004 and also featured the hardcore punk band Planes Mistaken for Stars and the punk band No Choice. Jake Burghart focuses on the relentless pressure on the band coming from major record companies looking to produce the band's upcoming album as the band struggles to decide what steps to take. With the release of the widely successful As the Eternal Cowboy (2003) on Fat Wreck Chords the prior year, various record companies (named in the film, among them Warner Bros. Records) took notice of the commercial potential of the band and, as illustrated in the DVD, took to wining and dining with \\"Against Me!\\". Oppositely, the film features brief interviews from those who oppose the band's signing to larger labels on DIY and anarchist principles, including a pair of interviews from DIY folk punk band Ghost Mice. The interviews from both sides offer insight into what pressures face the band and shed light on the moral dilemma that confuses and frustrates the band. During an interview with Fat Mike from Fat Wreck Chords in this documentary, he explains that his label offered the band a certain amount of money with their deal, which they accepted. Despite the pitches from major labels and the ensuing deliberation, the band was already obligated with that deal to release their next album with Fat Wreck. This album was Searching For A Former Clarity. They then signed to Sire Records three months after the release of Searching For A Former Clarity. The film illustrates the classic life of a rock band on tour, with the band and friends pulling ridiculous pranks and spending the month drunk. However, as Laura Jane Grace indicates in a statement on the back of the DVD case, \\"this isn't meant to be a representation of who we are as people. Just who we were right then.\\" Musically, the DVD contains live performances from the tour, with songs spanning their musical career. The extra features include many performances that were not a part of the feature presentation, including some much older footage from before the band was as it is today. The black and white photo on the cover of the DVD captures lead singer, Laura Jane Grace, and bassist, Andrew Seward, in the middle of a \\"high-five\\" while playing live at the 9:30 Club, in Washington D.C., on January 20, 2004.

It's the longest inverted roller coaster in Europe. The coaster stands tall making it the world's fourth tallest complete circuit inverted coaster, has a track length of , a top speed of and six inversions: Ride experience The track layout bears similarities to Raptor at Cedar Point with larger elements. The train departs the station and makes a carousel turn to the left onto the lift hill. Once the train has crested the top of the lift hill, it banks to the left and drops into a vertical loop. The train continues on and up into a zero-g roll, then back down into a highly banked speed turn to the right. Coming out of the turn, the train immediately travels through a cobra roll, followed by a large upwards helix to the right, and onto the mid-course brake run. The train then dives off the mid-course brake run and into a corkscrew, which leads into a tunnel. Exiting the tunnel, the train travels through another corkscrew and a low to the ground helix before slowing to a halt on the final brake run. Ride elements *Vertical loop *Zero G roll *Cobra roll *Two corkscrews after the block brake Theme Katun has an ancient Mayan ruin theme. Riders pass through two circular structures called \\"Stargates\\" - one just after leaving the station and another just before entering the final brake run. A \\"Katun\\" is a period of 7200 days (just under 20 years) in the Maya calendar. Accident and incidents On August 18, 2007, a 28-year-old man from Morocco was killed after he was struck in the head by the leg of a passenger on the ride. The man had passed a restricted area fence taller than 2 meters, where he wanted to retrieve his hat, lost moments before during a ride on the roller coaster. He didn't realize the coming of the train when he was struck at around 64 mph. The girl whose leg struck the man was injured and the ride was shut down for 24 hours. An investigation ensued, concluding that Mirabilandia's direction was not considered guilty.

Important quantities for describing acoustic waves are acoustic pressure, particle velocity, particle displacement and acoustic intensity. Acoustic waves travel with a characteristic acoustic velocity that depends on the medium they're passing through. Some examples of acoustic waves are audible sound from a speaker (waves traveling through air at the speed of sound), ground movement from an earthquake (waves traveling through the earth), or ultrasound used for medical imaging (waves traveling through the body). Wave properties =Acoustic wave equation= The acoustic wave equation describes the propagation of sound waves. The acoustic wave equation for sound pressure in one dimension is given by : { \\\\partial^2 p \\\\over \\\\partial x ^2 } - {1 \\\\over c^2} { \\\\partial^2 p \\\\over \\\\partial t ^2 } = 0 where :p is sound pressure in Pa :x is position in the direction of propagation of the wave, in m :c is speed of sound in m/s :t is time in s The wave equation for particle velocity has the same shape and is given by : { \\\\partial^2 u \\\\over \\\\partial x ^2 } - {1 \\\\over c^2} { \\\\partial^2 u \\\\over \\\\partial t ^2 } = 0 where :u is particle velocity in m/s For lossy media, more intricate models need to be applied in order to take into account frequency-dependent attenuation and phase speed. Such models include acoustic wave equations that incorporate fractional derivative terms, see also the acoustic attenuation article. D'Alembert gave the general solution for the lossless wave equation. For sound pressure, a solution would be : p = R \\\\cos(\\\\omega t - kx) + (1-R) \\\\cos(\\\\omega t+kx) where :\\\\omega is angular frequency in rad/s :t is time in s :k is wave number in rad·m−1 :R is a coefficient without unit For R=1 the wave becomes a travelling wave moving rightwards, for R=0 the wave becomes a travelling wave moving leftwards. A standing wave can be obtained by R=0.5. =Phase= In a travelling wave pressure and particle velocity are in phase, which means the phase angle between the two quantities is zero. This can be easily proven using the ideal gas law : \\\\ pV = nRT where :p is pressure in Pa :V is volume in m3 :n is amount in mol :R is the universal gas constant with value 8.314\\\\,472(15)~\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{J}}{\\\\mathrm{mol~K}} Consider a volume V. As an acoustic wave propagates through the volume, adiabatic compression and decompression occurs. For adiabatic change the following relation between volume V of a parcel of fluid and pressure p holds : { \\\\partial V \\\\over V_m } = { -1 \\\\over \\\\ \\\\gamma } {\\\\partial p \\\\over p_m } where :\\\\gamma is the adiabatic index without unit and the subscript m denotes the mean value of the respective variable. As a sound wave propagates through a volume, the horizontal displacement of a particle \\\\eta occurs along the wave propagation direction. : { \\\\partial \\\\eta \\\\over V_m } A = { \\\\partial V \\\\over V_m } = { -1 \\\\over \\\\ \\\\gamma } {\\\\partial p \\\\over p_m } where :A is cross-sectional area in m2 From this equation it can be seen that when pressure is at its maximum, particle displacement from average position reaches zero. As mentioned before, the oscillating pressure for a rightward travelling wave can be given by : p = p_0 cos(\\\\omega t - kx) Since displacement is maximum when pressure is zero there is a 90 degrees phase difference, so displacement is given by : \\\\eta = \\\\eta_0 sin(\\\\omega t - kx) Particle velocity is the first derivative of particle displacement: u = \\\\partial \\\\eta / \\\\partial t. Differentiation of a sine gives a cosine again : u = u_0 cos(\\\\omega t - kx) During adiabatic change, temperature changes with pressure as well following : { \\\\partial T \\\\over T_m } = { \\\\gamma - 1 \\\\over \\\\ \\\\gamma } {\\\\partial p \\\\over p_m } This fact is exploited within the field of thermoacoustics. =Propagation speed= The propagation speed, or acoustic velocity, of acoustic waves is a function of the medium of propagation. In general, the acoustic velocity c is given by the Newton-Laplace equation: : c = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{C}{\\\\rho}}\\\\, where :C is a coefficient of stiffness, the bulk modulus (or the modulus of bulk elasticity for gas mediums), :\\\\rho is the density in kg/m3 Thus the acoustic velocity increases with the stiffness (the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force) of the material, and decreases with the density. For general equations of state, if classical mechanics is used, the acoustic velocity c is given by : c^2=\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial\\\\rho} where differentiation is taken with respect to adiabatic change. :where p is the pressure and \\\\rho is the density  Phenomena  Acoustic waves are elastic waves that exhibit phenomena like diffraction, reflection and interference. Note that sound waves in air are not polarized since they oscillate along the same direction as they move. = Interference = Interference is the addition of two or more waves that results in a new wave pattern. Interference of sound waves can be observed when two loudspeakers transmit the same signal. At certain locations constructive interference occurs, doubling the local sound pressure. And at other locations destructive interference occurs, causing a local sound pressure of zero pascals. =Standing wave= A standing wave is a special kind of wave that can occur in a resonator. In a resonator superposition of the incident and reflective wave occurs, causing a standing wave. Pressure and particle velocity are 90 degrees out of phase in a standing wave. Consider a tube with two closed ends acting as a resonator. The resonator has normal modes at frequencies given by :f = \\\\frac{Nc}{2d}\\\\qquad\\\\qquad N \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,2,3,\\\\dots\\\\\\\\} where :c is the speed of sound in m/s :d is the length of the tube in m At the ends particle velocity becomes zero since there can be no particle displacement. Pressure however doubles at the ends because of interference of the incident wave with the reflective wave. As pressure is maximum at the ends while velocity is zero, there is a 90 degrees phase difference between them. =Reflection= An acoustic travelling wave can be reflected by a solid surface. If a travelling wave is reflected, the reflected wave can interfere with the incident wave causing a standing wave in the near field. As a consequence, the local pressure in the near field is doubled, and the particle velocity becomes zero. Attenuation causes the reflected wave to decrease in power as distance from the reflective material increases. As the power of the reflective wave decreases compared to the power of the incident wave, interference also decreases. And as interference decreases, so does the phase difference between sound pressure and particle velocity. At a large enough distance from the reflective material, there is no interference left anymore. At this distance one can speak of the far field. The amount of reflection is given by the reflection coefficient which is the ratio of the reflected intensity over the incident intensity :R = \\\\frac{ I_{\\\\mathrm{reflected}} }{ I_{\\\\mathrm{incident}} } =Absorption= Acoustic waves can be absorbed. The amount of absorption is given by the absorption coefficient which is given by :\\\\alpha = 1 - R^2 where :\\\\alpha is the absorption coefficient without a unit :R is the reflection coefficient without a unit Often acoustic absorption of materials is given in decibels instead. = Layered media = When an acoustic wave propagates through a non-homogeneous medium, it will undergo diffraction at the impurities it encounters or at the interfaces between layers of different materials. This is a phenomenon very similar to that of the refraction, absorption and transmission of light in Bragg mirrors. The concept of acoustic wave propagation through periodic media is exploited with great success in acoustic metamaterial engineering.Gorishnyy, Taras, Martin Maldovan, Chaitanya Ullal, and Edwin Thomas. \\"Sound ideas.\\" Physics World 18, no. 12 (2005): 24. The acoustic absorption, reflection and transmission in multilayer materials can be calculated with the transfer-matrix method.

This movement included both Russians and peoples of other nationalities living within the Soviet Union, in which case it is referred to as the Liberation Movement of the Peoples of Russia ().  History  The movement began spontaneously at the outbreak of the Soviet-German war in June 1941. White Russian emigres, veterans of the White movement, began seeking sympathetic ears in the German Armed Forces (the Wehrmacht) and trying to find a means of creating armed units that would be used on the Eastern Front (such as the Russian Corps). Meanwhile, some captured Soviet officers switched sides, including General Andrey Vlasov. The German propaganda department began exploiting the idea of a Russian Liberation Army (which did not exist) in order to encourage defections, printing up propaganda leaflets encouraging surrender and dropping them in Soviet zones. The Russian National People's Army, formed in occupied Belarus which was under the command of two White emigres, S.V. Ivanov and Constantine Kromiadi and also had a considerable amount of emigres in its officer core. Later the emigres were replaced by former Soviet commanders B.I. Boyarsky and Georgii Zhilenkov, since Nazi officials dreaded emigre influence on Soviet citizens. The unit, 8,000 men strong, managed to negotiate with Soviet partisans to reduce hostility, displeasing the SS which eventually disarmed the unit. These units were under German supervision, kept to a restricted size (often without being fully outfitted with heavy artillery), and two of them were disarmed out of fear they would not be loyal. The Russian anti-communist organization National Alliance of Russian Solidarists (NTS) was the only significant organized Russian group that tried to act outside of all German sponsorship. This principle was declared in 1938 by chairman Sergei Baidalakov who said in the wake of the impending military conflict: \\"With whom do we go? The Russian conscience can have only one answer. Not with Stalin, not with foreign conquerors, but with the entire Russian people.\\" The hope was to create an entirely independent, self-sufficient \\"third force\\" that would be anti- Communist and at the same time anti-Nazi, based on a grass roots partisan resistance movement. Shortly before the attack on the Soviet Union, NTS decided to close its offices on Axis occupied territories and go underground in order to avoid Axis infiltration. It also forbade its members to join any German sponsored units, such as the Russian Corps in Serbia. There was no united center for the movement until the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia was founded in November 1944, officially announcing its existence with the Prague Manifesto. This movement, led by General Vlasov, received a surprising groundswell of support amidst white emigres, Soviet Eastern workers, and POWs, despite the apparent futility of the situation (Nazi Germany was already fighting on its own soil when the first Russian liberation units were ready for deployment). The committee received the blessing of Metropolitan Anastasy of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia as well as the Paris Exarchate. Several armed groups who had been fighting already, such as the Russian Corps of General Boris Shteifon, the \\"Battle Group\\" of white General Tourkoul, and the Cossacks of Ataman Helmuth von Pannwitz submitted themselves to the committee's command, although the turn of events prevented them from ever being de facto incorporated into the Russian Liberation Army. Others, such as General Pyotr Krasnov and several Ukrainian armed groups refused to submit to Vlasov and denounced him publicly. References * (1994) The Mission of the Russian Emigration, M.V.

The 2002 winner of the Boston Underground Film Festival (BUFF) Bachus Award, The Neuchatel Sci-Fi Fest Audience Choice Award, and much critical acclaim for its razor sharp, if quite demented social satire, it was created by taking an old sci-fi movie—Killers from Space—overdubbing the soundtrack with humorous dialogue, and adding some new scenes, essentially turning it into an entirely different movie. The plot involves alien invaders with a machine that turns straight people gay. Plot Scientist Doug Fartin (who insists that his name is pronounced “Far- tan”) is in charge of Operation Manhole, a project to eliminate all homosexuals in the military by luring them to a specific spot and then dropping a bomb on them. The bomb, however, misses its target and instead obliterates part of the nearby town of Inbred, Texas. The plane is then struck by an invisible force and crashes to earth, and its occupants—Dr. Fartin and the pilot—are presumed dead. Fartin, however, was saved from the plane by extraterrestrials with bulging eyeballs, who then performed an operation on him. Fartin wanders back to the military base the next day, with no memory of how he survived the plane crash, and is beginning to exhibit stereotypically gay behavior (e.g., he keeps using the word “fabulous”). Base commander Colonel Butz and surgeon Major Problemo talk to Doug's wife, Vagina, about her husband's new behavior; if she can't turn him back into “a real man,” he'll be included in the next bombing. She tries her best to sexually arouse him, but he can only have sex with her while imagining that she's Ted Kennedy. The next day, Doug Fartin—whose security clearance has been revoked because of his new gayness—steals a piece of paper from a vault in Butz's office. Upon hearing of this, FBI agent Priggs tries to figure out what was stolen, which isn't easy because the vault is highly disorganized and mostly filled with take-out menus. Priggs discovers a handful of marijuana on the floor in front of the vault, and immediately recognizes it as part of Fartin's stash. Doug arrives at Sodom Flats with the paper, but is caught and confronted by Priggs. Doug punches Priggs out and tries to escape in his car, but a hallucination of bulging eyeballs causes him to run off the road and crash. Regaining consciousness in the base infirmary, Fartin remembers what happened to him after the plane went down, and tells his story to Butz and the others: The aliens, who are from Uranus (“an all-gay planet”), have been the ones responsible for creating homosexuals on Earth and other planets. Over the centuries, they've monitored these planets and tried to snuff out homophobia. The last time they’d visited Earth was during World War II, when their agents abducted Adolf Hitler and turned him into a cross-dressing lounge singer on another planet; the Germans set up an imposter in Hitler's place, but when the imposter ordered the invasion of Russia, the aliens knew that Nazi Germany was doomed, so they left. Now the aliens have returned, with a new mission: to build a machine whose transmissions will cause everyone on Earth to become homosexual. They had ordered Fartin to return to the military base, steal from the vault the bottom half of page 32 from the original manuscript of Giovanni's Room, and bring it to the aliens’ subterranean headquarters at Sodom Flats. Fartin rightly concluded that there's something on the paper that the aliens needed to complete their machine and refused to cooperate, but the alien leader—the Super-Homo—hypnotized Doug to ensure his complicity. After hearing Fartin's story, Butz and his associates aren't sure about Doug's sanity. Later, Sheriff Mussolino of Inbred (who's been turned into a bulging- eyed agent of the aliens) materializes in Fartin's room and tells him that the aliens now need a power source for their machine; Fartin, who is now convinced that helping the aliens is the right thing to do, goes to the nearby power station and orders the technician, at gunpoint, to move certain levers and switches (one of which causes the camera filming this movie to temporarily falter).

A takeoff on The Three Little Pigs told as a hip, jazzy musical, the short features the voice of Stan Freberg, with music provided by jazz composer/trumpeter Shorty Rogers. It was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on January 5, 1957 as part of the Looney Tunes series. Plot The short opens with a display of the book that shows the Three Little Pigs who used to play pipes and dance jigs. The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops. During a gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf appears and proves he is friendly by stating that he wants to join the band. The Wolf happens to be terrible at playing his choice instrument (a trumpet) so the pigs throw him out. Feeling insulted, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the straw house using his trumpet, forcing the pigs to go to the Dew Drop Inn, the House of Sticks. Things go well (including the piano playing pig doing an imitation of Liberace's \\"I wish my brother George was here\\"), until the Wolf comes in and attempts to play his trumpet again. Like the pigs, the people watching also think the wolf's playing is corny, so they call for the pigs to \\"throw the square out\\", which they do. Again, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the Dew Drop Inn. The pigs then realize that to escape the Wolf's \\"windy tricks,\\" they will go to the House of Bricks (built on May 1, 1776, according to a cornerstone). The House of Bricks has a \\"No Wolves Allowed\\" rule, so when the Wolf tries to get in, he is punched in the face by a bouncer. Then he tries to ram the door down with a log but with no success. The Wolf runs out of breath in trying to blow away the club, but thinks he can get in by disguising himself. He reenters in fur coat and ukulele with his perfect rendition of the Charleston song (cut short by slipping on a strategically thrown banana peel). He returns in the disguise of a houseplant with his trumpet but gets blasted outside by a plunger shot from the double bass. For his third try, the Wolf shows up in a drum major outfit playing a big bass drum to the tune of \\"Don't Give Up the Ship\\". A dart is shot into the drum to deflate it, leaving him to exit in humiliation before the pigs shut and lock the door to ensure he can't get in again. Not the least bit deterred, he shows up with a large cylinder of TNT and snaps, \\"I'll show those pigs that I'm not stuck! If I can't blow it down, I'll blow it up!\\" The fuse is blown out on his first try, so he steps back a bit and lights it from there. Unfortunately for him, he is too far away and his weapon explodes while he is carrying it to his target, killing the Big Bad Wolf. The narrator reveals that the explosion did not send the Wolf to Heaven but down to \\"the other place\\", where his trumpet playing improves. When the pigs hear this, one of them says, \\"The Big Bad Wolf, he learned the rule: you gotta get hot to play real cool!\\" The Wolf's spirit then rises up through the floor and, now playing expertly, joins in for the final notes prompting one of the pigs to alter their band's name to \\"The Three Little Bops Plus One\\".

His painting was a complex composite assemblage, with delicate and formal structures using various aesthetic and visual data, in order to become a work of art autonomous aesthetic phenomenon.

He was one of the first Slavic expressionist painters and one of the most authentic Macedonian painters of landscape, in which he imported folk elements as well. He painted still nature, portraits and mosaics. Education and career Ličenoski graduated in 1927 from an art school in Belgrade, where he had studied under Milan Milovanović (1876–1946), Ljubomir Ivanovic (1882–1945) and Petar Dobrovic (1890–1942). Upon graduation, he organized his first exhibition in Skopje and specialized in wall painting at the School of Applied Arts in Paris. There he attended the École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers (1927–29) and frequented the studio of Andre Lhote. In 1929 he returned to Belgrade and became a member of the group Oblik. In the 1930s he gradually abandoned portraiture and social issues as subject-matter in favour of painting the Macedonian landscape, which he rendered with somewhat crude brushwork and thick layers of intense colour. During that decade he decorated ecclesiastical and other buildings and worked on the monument Albanian Golgotha (1940) for the Serbian soldiers' cemetery on the island of Vido (Greece). He moved to Skopje in 1945 and became a professor at the newly established School of Applied Arts.

Painting style His style had developed in the context of the Ecole de Paris, which contrasted with the narrative models he had inherited from the Post-Byzantine tradition. In his mature work he introduced the idiom of Expressionism into modern Macedonian art. From 1928 up to 1941, his art featured full color expressionism with a high presence of Macedonian motives on his canvases. He was also able to express himself perfectly well through fresco paintings and mosaics. Accomplishments He founded the Office of Cultural and Historic Monuments, an art gallery and an art school where he taught until his death.

The company was a direct competitor to UFA, which had begun operations in Berlin in 1917, and quickly absorbed several other film industry companies in the region. In 1930 investor Wilhelm Kraus and a consortium of banks bought a major shareholding in the company, and on 21 September 1932 the group took control and renamed it Bavaria Film AG. In 1938 the Bavaria Film was nationalised but privatised again in 1956.  Films shot at Bavaria Film  Alfred Hitchcock made his first film, The Pleasure Garden, in Geiselgasteig in 1925. In 1934 Peer Gynt was made there. The studios have been used by numerous directors, including Elia Kazan (Man on a Tightrope, 1952), Max Ophüls (Lola Montès, 1955), Stanley Kubrick (Paths of Glory, 1957), Richard Fleischer (The Vikings, 1958), John Huston (Freud: The Secret Passion, 1962), Robert Siodmak (The Nina B.

It extends for from an intersection with NY 21 in the town of Hopewell, near the city of Canandaigua, to a junction with NY 96 midway between the villages of Phelps and Clifton Springs. NY 488 also passes through the hamlet of Orleans, located within the town of Phelps. Although NY 488 is signed as a north–south highway, most of the route follows an east–west alignment. NY 488 was originally designated as part of NY 88 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 88 was truncated to the village of Phelps in August 1972, at which time its former routing between NY 21 and NY 96 was renumbered to NY 488, eliminating an overlap with NY 96\\\\. Route description NY 488 heading eastbound from its western terminus in Chapin. The Finger Lakes Railway is visible in the distance. NY 488 begins at an intersection with NY 21 in the hamlet of Chapin, a small community within the Ontario County town of Hopewell. The highway progresses eastward, crossing the Finger Lakes Railway at a grade crossing less than from NY 21\\\\. Just past the railroad, the route makes a slight turn to the northeast for before curving back to the east and continuing across open farmland. As NY 488 crosses the town of Hopewell, it serves a handful of isolated homes and intersects several north–south highways of local importance, including County Road 47 (CR 47). The route continues eastward into the town of Phelps, where it serves a pair of large farms on its way to the small hamlet of Orleans, located on both the western bank of Flint Creek and the right-of-way of the now-defunct Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). In the western portion of Orleans, NY 488 intersects with the north–south CR 20, which leads to most of the hamlet's residences. NY 488, meanwhile, bypasses most of the community to the northwest as it makes a gradual turn to the north to follow Flint Creek and the old PRR right-of-way toward the village of Phelps. Outside of Orleans, the route reenters mostly rural surroundings as it approaches a junction with CR 43\\\\. While CR 43 heads north toward Clifton Springs, NY 488 turns to the northeast, following the creek and the old rail bed past the large reservoir serving the village of Newark. At an intersection with Trimble and Griffith Roads, the highway turns back to the north, matching a similar curve in the creek's routing. NY 488 continues on, crossing the former right-of-way of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and passing Midlakes High School on an otherwise nondescript stretch before ending at an intersection with NY 96 west of the village of Phelps. History NY 488 approaching its eastern terminus, a signalized intersection with NY 96 in Phelps On May 25, 1915, the state of New York let a contract to improve an highway connecting the city of Canandaigua to the hamlet of Orleans to state highway standards. The reconstruction of the highway was 70 percent complete by 1920 and finished by 1926, by which time the highway was added to the state highway system as State Highway 1278 (SH 1278). The north–south highway connecting Orleans to the village of Phelps was rebuilt to state highway standards as SH 1863. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, SH 1278 and SH 1863 became part of the new NY 88, which began in the village of Sodus and extended southward through Phelps to the intersection of West Avenue and Main Street in Canandaigua.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930–31 and 1931–32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931).

He was also the interim editor-in-chief of Grantland.com, replacing Bill Simmons, before ESPN shuttered the site on October 30, 2015. Connelly joined ESPN in 2001 to host the daily interview program Unscripted with Chris Connelly, designed to be a more contemporary version of the long-running Up Close interview show which previously occupied the 5PM ET timeslot. The show, which premiered on the same day as Pardon the Interruption, lasted only a few months before being replaced by an early SportsCenter and eventually Around the Horn. Since the cancellation of Unscripted, Connelly has reported and narrated the long-form human interest reports that air on SportsCenter on weekends. Most notably, he annually does a one-week series called \\"My Wish\\" involving athletes fulfilling kids' Make a Wish Foundation wishes. Connelly also helped ABC and ESPN cover the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 2006; he conducted interviews with finalists who had just been eliminated. Before joining ESPN, Connelly worked for Rolling Stone magazine as a music critic. During the 1980s he also served as Special Music Correspondent for Good Morning America, which involved interviewing the music stars of the day. Next Connelly spent thirteen years at MTV (1988-2001). He hosted the pre-shows for the MTV Movie Awards and prior to that, The Big Picture, a weekly show with features and movie reviews.

This villa was constructed in 1582 by Cardinal Bonanni. It was sold in 1617 to the banker Roberto Primo who constructed the 'teatro d'acqua' (water theatre) at the far end of the garden. The theatre is a direct copy of that at the nearby Villa Mondragone, for whom Primo acted as a banker. The clock, or 'orologio' was added in the nineteenth century while the villa was in the ownership of the Lancellotti family. The villa was restored in 1730, by the new owner Prince Pietro Piccolomini. In 1840 the Villa, called Villa Piccolomini, was sold to Francis Mehlem of Bavaria. The villa was bought and restored in 1866 by Prince Filippo Massimo Lancellotti and his wife Princess Elisabetta Borghese Aldobrandini. King Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia, lived here, and in October 1805 he received Pope Pius VII as a guest. In 1855 the famous writer George Sand rented the Villa Piccolomini from March 31 to April 19 and lived here with her son Maurice and her secretary Alexandre Manceau. The facade of the palace offers views of the garden from every floor, and panoramic views of Tuscolo hill. The inside contains rooms decorated with allegorical scenes of the countryside, older paintings by Ciro Ferri (1634–1689). The Italian garden encloses a nymphaeum from the 16th century. In the hall there is a mosaic in white and black tesseras found in Tuscolo hill, near the local Camaldolese monastery, in 1863. Statues found during the archeological excavation of Tusculum are the decoration of the Villa. A part of the gardens, now called \\"Ombrellino\\", today is a public park. Views of the garden facade of this villa can be had from Tuscolo's road. The villa is no longer open to the public. Ombrellino Park.

Their most common use is against mosquitoes. Larvicides may be contact poisons, stomach poisons, growth regulators, or (increasingly) biological control agents. Biological agents Larva of Aedes aegypti The biological control agent Bacillus thuringiensis, also known as Bt, is a bacterial disease specific to Lepidopteran caterpillars. Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, also known as Bti, and Bacillus sphaericus, which affect larval mosquitoes and some midges, have come into increasing use in recent times. Bti and B. sphaericus are both naturally occurring soil bacterium registered as larvicides under the names Bactivec, Bacticide, Aquabac, Teknar, Vectobac, LarvX, and VectoLex CG. Typically in granular form, pellets are distributed on the surface of stagnant water locations. When the mosquito larvae ingest the bacteria, crystallized toxins are produced that destroy the digestive tract, resulting in death. These larvicides will last only a few weeks in water and pose no danger to humans, non-targeted animal species, or the environment when used according to directions. Chemical Agents Methoprene is an insect growth regulator agent that interrupts the growth cycle of insect larvae, preventing them from development beyond the pupa stage. MetaLarv and Altosid are products containing S-methoprene as the active ingredient. They are usually applied to larger bodies of water in the form of time-release formulations that can last from one to five months. Use of this larvicide does not pose an unreasonable health risks to humans or other wildlife and it will not leach into the ground water supply. Methoprene is moderately toxic to some fish, shrimp, lobster, and crayfish, and highly toxic to some fish and freshwater invertebrates; it bioaccumulates in fish tissues. Temephos, marketed as Abate and ProVect, is an organophosphate which prevents mosquito larvae from developing resistance to bacterial larvicides. Due to the small amount needed and the fast rate that temephos breaks down in water, this type of larvicide does not pose an unreasonable health risk to humans, but at large doses it can cause nausea or dizziness. Similarly, there is not a large risk to terrestrial species, but there is a toxic concern for non-targeted aquatic species. Therefore, temephos should be limited only to sites where less hazardous larvicides are ineffective and with intervals between applications. Acoustic larvicide Sound energy transmitted into water at specific frequencies cause larvae air bladders to instantly rupture, severely damaging internal tissues causing death or latent effects prohibiting further maturity. Other techniques Larviciding techniques can also include the addition of surface films to standing water to suffocate mosquito larvae, or the genetic modification of plants so that they naturally produce a larvicide in plant tissues. Research on botanical oils has found neem oil to be larvicidal. Larvicidal activity of neem oil (Azadirachta indica) formulation against mosquitoes. Median lethal concentration (LC50) of the formulation against Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti was found to be 1.6, 1.8 and 1.7 ppm respectively. The formulation also showed 95.1% and,99.7% reduction of Aedes larvae on day 1 and day 2 respectively; thereafter 100% larval control was observed up to day 7.

Early life Thanh was born in Travinh, Vietnam, to a Khmer Krom father and a Chinese-Vietnamese mother.: \\"The first of the Khmer Krom to arrive on the scene in Phnom Penh was Son Ngoc Thanh. Thanh had been born in Cochinchina, and his father was a Khmer Krom landowner, while his mother was from a Chinese-Vietnamese family.\\" He was educated in Saigon, Montpellier and Paris, studying law for a year before returning to Indo-China. He found work as a magistrate in Pursat and as a public prosecutor in Phnom Penh before becoming Deputy Director of the Buddhist Institute. Along with another prominent early Khmer nationalist, Pach Chhoeun, he established the first Khmer language newspaper, Nagaravatta, in 1936. The political outlook of Nagaravatta, which urged Khmers to break the commercial monopoly of foreign traders by starting their own businesses, was to make Thanh and his colleagues receptive to Japanese fascism, or as he termed it \\"National Socialism\\". Thanh's ideology was essentially republican, right-wing, and modernising in outlook, which was to make him a longstanding opponent of the King Norodom Sihanouk. Despite his nationalism, he was also a strong advocate of pan-Asian cooperation, and advocated the teaching of the Vietnamese language in Cambodian schools, as it was a potential conduit for modernising ideas. Involvement in government After demonstrations against the French in July 1942, Thanh fled to Japan, returning when Sihanouk declared Cambodia's independence on 12 March 1945, during the Japanese occupation. He was made Foreign Minister. In August with the surrender of Japan, Thanh made himself Prime Minister. With the restoration of French control in October, he was arrested, and sent into exile first in Saigon and then in France. Many of his supporters joined the Khmer Issarak resistance to fight the colonial power. In 1951, the authorities brought Thanh back, to considerable popular acclaim; refusing a Cabinet position, he made alliances with various leaders of the Khmer Issarak rebels, and established another newspaper (Khmer Kraok) which advocated revolt against the French administration and was quickly banned. In 1952, accompanied by his lieutenant Ea Sichau (a French-educated customs official and leftist intellectual) and a number of supporters, Thanh disappeared into the forests in the area of Siem Reap, and began to organise resistance. The Issarak movement was split between the Khmer National Liberation Committee, the more overtly leftist United Issarak Front, and a variety of regional warlords and guerrilla leaders. Thanh attempted to gain overall control of the movement throughout the early 1950s; a few of the movement's leaders, such as Prince Norodom Chantaraingsey and Puth Chhay, temporarily supported his overall leadership. By 1954, however, he had been increasingly sidelined by the leftists, and received overtures from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, who would fund many of his activities in future. Though Thanh retained a high degree of support amongst the Khmer Krom, in subsequent years he would have relatively little influence or popular support within Cambodian domestic politics, especially as Sihanouk's Sangkum movement absorbed most centrist and rightist elements. The Khmer Serei The First Indochina War ended in 1954. From his base near Siem Reap, Thanh organized the Khmer Serei militia, mainly recruited from amongst the Khmer Krom, to fight Sihanouk, who had come to regard Thanh as one of his greatest enemies. In his 1959 \\"Manifesto\\" of the Khmer Serei, Thanh charged Sihanouk with allowing the \\"Communistization\\" of Cambodia at the hands of North Vietnam. The Khmer Serei operated in the border areas of Thailand and South Vietnam, making clandestine anti-Sihanouk radio broadcasts, but made little headway, although they were suggested as a source of military power in a number of coup plots (such as the Bangkok Plot). After the Cambodian military and Lon Nol overthrew Sihanouk in 1970, Thanh was invited to participate in the new Khmer Republic government - initially as an adviser to the Acting Head of State, Cheng Heng - and put his Khmer Serei troops at its service. In 1972, Thanh again became Prime Minister, but after being the target of a bomb attack (possibly organised by Lon Nol's brother, Lon Non) he was soon dismissed by Lon Nol and exiled himself to South Vietnam. Thanh was arrested after the Fall of Saigon, and died in custody in Chi Hoa Prison in Ho Chi Minh City due to illness on 8 August 1977.

On the surface, the Web looks like a variation on GOPHER (p. 189). In addition, Krol notes: : The World Wide Web or WWW, is the newest information service to arrive on the Internet. The Web is based on a technology called hypertext....Like GOPHER and WAIS, the Web is very much under development, perhaps even more so. So don't be surprised if it doesn't occasionally work the way you'd like. It's certainly worth playing with (p. 227). =The Web v. Gopher= Krol compares the Web and Gopher, stating: :The Web and Gopher: You may be asking yourself what is so great about this. After all, what we've done so far isn't all that different from what you can do with Gopher. The Web appears to have a subject-oriented flavor, which is an advantage, but at first glance, it doesn't seem fundamentally different. That's not really true though. While there are a lot of similarities, the Web and Gopher differ in several ways. First, the Web is based on hypertext documents, and is structured by links between pages of hypertext. (231). He further notes: :The Gopher just isn't as flexible. Its presentation is based on individual resources and servers...the web eliminates the barrier between your data and \\"public data\\" ... Ten years ago, a few dozen boxes full of index cards was de rigueur for anyone writing a dissertation or an academic book. With the Web, a few hypertext documents make that all obsolete (232). =Browsers= While Krol notes that a number of web browser options exist, he highlights ViolaWWW stating that, \\"The one called Viola or 'ViolaWWW' is probably the most feature rich\\" (p. 227). =Hypertext editors= At the time of publication, HTML editors or \\"hypertext editors\\" were rare. Krol states: : Hypertext Editors: At this time, hypertext editors, which are needed to take full advantage of the Web, are scarce. The WorldWideWeb browser for the NeXT workstation incorporates a hypertext editor; the ViolaWWW browser will eventually add a hypertext editor. For the moment, if you don't have a NeXT, you're out of luck. If you poke around in the online help long enough, you'll find a description of HTML, the markup language. If you're really bold, you can create hypertext 'by hand.' But that's beyond the scope of this book. We expect that use of the Web will really explode once hypertext editors are available. For the moment, though, its hobbled by the lack of editors (p. 241).

The Romanichal Traveller tradition of the vardo is seen as a high cultural point of both artistic design and a masterpiece of woodcrafters art.Travelling Art: Gypsy Caravans and Canal Barges by Gordon Thorburn and John Baxter 2007. The heyday of the living wagon lasted for roughly 70 years, from the mid-1800s through the first two decades of the twentieth century. Not used for year-round living today, they are shown at the Romanichal (British Romani) horse fairs held throughout the year, the best known of which is Appleby Horse Fair. Design A vardo's design includes large wheels set outside the body, whose sides slope outward considerably as they rise toward the eaves. Beyond this characteristic, the six types of caravans differ in shape, size, placement of the wheels relative to the bed, where made, and maker.Ward-Jackson pp. 73-95 The roofs of the bow-top and open-lot types are canvas stretched over curved wooden frames; the others are roofed in wood.Ward-Jackson pp. 84,88 By the mid-1800s, the designs were almost entirely standardized, and some features are common to all types. The door is almost always in the front.Ward-Jackson p. 41 The small cast-iron cooking stove was invented in America and was available there and in Great Britain from about 1830 on and is a common fixture of the wagons.Ward-Jackson p. 49 A cooking stove necessitates a chimney to vent smoke. A caravan's chimney is always on its left side as viewed from its front doorway; as the caravan travels along the left side of the road, the chimney is in less danger from low-hanging tree limbs in that position.Ward-Jackson p. 75 The stove rests in a wooden fireplace. The wagon's interior is typically outfitted with built-in seats, cabinets, a wardrobe, bunks in the rear of the caravan, a chest of drawers, and a glass-fronted china cabinet.Ward-Jackson pp. 74-75 There are windows on the left side and rear. Some types have clerestories which let in light and air.Ward-Jackson pp. 49-52 A bracket for an oil lamp is mounted over the chest of drawers opposite the fireplace; the chest's top functions as a table. Wagons' exteriors can range from fairly plain to intricately carved, painted in bright colors, and sheathed in places with gold leaf.Ward-Jackson pp. 168-184 History Romanichal-style trotting cart The Romanichal had arrived in the British Isles by 1500 AD,Ward-Jackson p. 22 but they did not begin to live in vardos until around 1850. Prior to that, they traveled in tilted carts or afoot and slept either under or in these carts or in small tents.Ward-Jackson p. 29 Originally Romanichals would travel on foot, or with light, horse-drawn carts, typical of other Romani groups or would build \\"bender\\" tents — so called because they were made from supple branches which they bent inwards to support a waterproof covering. The heyday of the Romani caravan was the latter part of the 19th century.Ward-Jackson p. 51 Initially using castoff horses and even mules to draw their chimneyed living wagons, the Romanichal gradually created a breed of horse known variously as the Gypsy Cob (UK, NZ), Gypsy Horse (US, UK, AU), Coloured Cob (UK, Ireland, parts of continental Europe), Gypsy Vanner (USA, CAN), Tinker Horse (parts of continental Europe), and Irish Cob (Ireland) to do so.Hart, p. 63 Wagons were first used as a form of living accommodation (as opposed to carrying people or goods) in France in 1810 by non-Romani circus troupes.The New Gypsy Caravan, Timothy Lemke. Published by Lulu.com, 2007 Large transport wagons combined storage space and living space into one vehicle, and were pulled by teams of horses. By the 19th century wagons became smaller, reducing the number of horses required, and around the mid-to-late-19th century (1840–1870), Romanichals in Britain started using wagons that incorporated living spaces on the inside, and added their own characteristic style of decoration. In The Old Curiosity Shop (ch. xxvii), Charles Dickens described Mrs. Jarley's well- appointed van: :'One half of it...was carpeted, and so partitioned off at the further end as to accommodate a sleeping-place, constructed after the fashion of a berth on board ship, which was shaded, like the windows, with fair white curtains... The other half served for a kitchen, and was fitted up with a stove whose small chimney passed through the roof. It also held a closet or larder, several chests, a great pitcher of water, and a few cooking-utensils and articles of crockery. These latter necessaries hung upon the walls, which in that portion of the establishment devoted to the lady of the caravan, were ornamented with such gayer and lighter decorations as a triangle and a couple of well-thumbed tambourines.' These smaller wagons were called \\"vardo\\" in the Romani language (originating from the Ossetic word vurdon) for cart.The Gypsies, Angus M. Fraser, Blackwell Publishing, 1995. The Romani vardo evolved into some of the most advanced forms of travelling wagon, and are prized for their practicality as well as aesthetic design and beauty. There is no more iconic or recognizable Romani symbol than a highly decorated Romanichal vardo, and the time of its use is often affectionately called \\"the wagon time\\" by Romanichal travellers. The vardos were typically commissioned by families or by a newlywed couple from specialist coach builders. Building the vardo took between six months to a year; a variety of woods including oak, ash, elm, cedar, and pine were utilized in its construction. Prized by the Romani, and later by non-Romani, including other traveller groups, for their practicality as well as aesthetic beauty, vardos can be categorized into six main styles; these being the Brush wagon, Reading, Ledge, Bow Top, Open lot, and Burton. The general design evolved over time and were named after the home's owners, for their traditional style (Ledge), for the town of its construction (Reading), or for the name of the builder. =Burton wagon= Popular with Romanis, as well as Showmen families, and circus people, the Burton wagon is the oldest example of a wagon used as home in Britain. Originally undecorated, the Burton wagon evolved into an elaborate Romani vardo, but due to its smaller wheels it was not suited for off-road use. =Brush wagon= The Brush or fen wagon as it was also known, consists of a standard Romani vardo, with straight sides and the wheels located outside the body. The Brush was similar in construction to the Reading vardo, but unlike other styles, the brush wagon had two distinct features: a half-door with glazed shutters, located at the back of the vardo, with a set of steps, both set around the opposite way from other wagons The English Gypsy Caravan, C.H. Ward-Jackson & Denis E. Harvey, 1973 and lacked the mollycroft (skylight) on the roof. The exterior is equipped with racks and cases fitted on the outside frame and chase of the wagon allowing the owner to carry trade items like brushes, brooms, wicker chairs, and baskets. Additionally, three light iron rails ran around the entire roof, used for stowing bulkier goods, and sometimes trade-name boards. The wagons were elaborately and colorfully painted. =Reading wagon= Romanichal Reading vardo, early 20th century The Reading or kite wagon is so named due to its straight sides that slope outwards towards the eaves, high arched wheels, and relative light weight; there is no other vardo that epitomizes the golden age of Romani horse travel. It dates from 1870 and is synonymous with the original builder Dunton and Sons of Reading from where the vardo takes its name. The wagon was highly prized by the Romanies for its aesthetic design, beauty and practicality to cross fords, pull off-road and over rough ground, something smaller-wheeled wagons like the Burton were unable to do. The Reading wagon is 10 feet long, with a porch on the front and back. The rear wheels were 18 inches larger than the ones on the front. At the start of the 20th century the design incorporated raised skylights. On either side of the bed space, quarter-inch thick bevelled mirrors were common, and were lavishly decorated. Cupboards and locker seats were built in to prevent movement whilst travelling. Side and back windows were decorated and shuttered, and the body of the vardo itself would have originally been made from beaded tongue-and-groove matchboard, painted red picked out in yellow and green. As with other vardo, the extent of the elaborate decoration reflected the wealth of the family, boasting carved lion heads and gargoyles; these would have been painted gold or extensively decorated with gold leaf. Today, surviving Reading wagons are prized exhibits in museums or private collections. A fine one is in the University of Reading's Museum of English Rural Life. =Ledge wagon= Romnichal-style Ledge vardo The characteristic design of the ledge or cottage shaped wagon incorporated a more robust frame and living area that extended over the large rear wheels of the wagon. Brass brackets supported the frame of the wagon and solid arched roof usually 12 feet high, extended over the length of the wagon to form porches at either end and panelled with tongue in groove boards. The porch roof was further supported by iron brackets, and the walls were highly decorated with ornate scrollwork and carvings across the length of the wagon. =Bow top= Based on the design of the Ledge wagon, the Bow Top is significantly lighter, and less likely to turn over in a strong wind. The design incorporated a lightweight canvas top, supported by a wooden frame: a design reminiscent of the older “bender tents” used by the Romanichal. Both back and front walls of the wagon were decorated in scrollwork and tongue and groove and the wagon was painted green to be less noticeable in woodland. The inside of the Bow Top also contained the same high scrollwork or Chenille fabric, with a stove, table and double bed. The bow-top is commonly thought of as being covered in teal- coloured canvas. This is said to now be a tradition which began before World War II when only cotton duck was available.Hockensmith p. 76 =Open lot= Almost identical in size and construction of the Bow Top wagon, the Open lot or Yorkshire Bow featured the same design but with a curtain instead of the door characteristic of other wagons. The wagon's entrance was covered by a curtain for privacy. Decoration and painting Door carving of a traditional Romanichal Chiriklo (bird). Reading vardo, early 20th century Vardos were elaborately decorated, hand carved and ornately painted with traditional Romani symbols. Examples of famous Wagon Artists responsible for the early development of vardo art are Jim Berry, John Pockett, Tom Stevens, Tommy Gaskin, John Pickett, modern contemporary decorators continuing to shape this colourful tradition included artists such as Yorkie Greenwood and Lol Thompson. Much of the wealth of the vardo was on display in the carvings, which incorporated aspects of the Romani lifestyle such as horses and dogs, as well as stock decorative designs of birds, lions, griffins, flowers, vines and elaborate scrollwork. Carved details were often accented with gold, either painted or, in the most expensive wagons, the use of between 4-15 books of gold leaf applied as decoration. Many individual makers were identified by their particular designs. Funeral rites The Romanichal funeral rite during the wagon time of the 19th and 20th century included burning the wagon and belongings after the owner's death.In the Life of a Romany Gypsy, Manfri Frederick Wood, et al. Routledge, 1979 The custom was that nothing whatsoever would have been sold, though some of the deceased's possessions, jewellery, china or money would be left to the family. The rest, including the wagon, was destroyed. Modern traditional use The Romani travellers in the 1920s proudly clung to their decorative vardos, although the economics of their way of life was in upheaval due to the contraction in the horse-trading industry and the changes from their traditional crafts.Gypsy caravans in Journal of the GLS (3rd series), 19 (4), pp 114-146, F.G. Huth, 1940 In the present day, Romanichals are more likely to live in caravans. The tradition does survive, primarily outside Romani culture. It was estimated that by 1940 only about 1% of Romani travellers still lived in the traditional horse-drawn vardo. Today's Romanichal still attend horse fairs,Jones 2002 the best known of which is Appleby Horse Fair.Capstick and Donoghue 2002 Some attendees of the fairs travel there in the traditional manner via horse-drawn vardos. American photographer John S. Hockensmith documented such a journey in 2004, travelling with and photographing the Harker family's 60-mile journey to Appleby in bow top living waggons.Hockensmith 2006 p. 12 Other uses The British writer Roald Dahl acquired a traditional vardo in the 1960s which was used as a playhouse for his children; later he used the vardo as a writing room, in which he wrote Danny, the Champion of the World. John Lennon's Rolls-Royce Phantom V was painted in the style of a Romani gypsy wagon by artist Steve Weaver of private coach maker J.P. Fallon Ltd.

Located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, it is touted as \\"Alabama's Big Cave\\". In addition to the caves, the park offers various other attractions, including a three- quarter acre maze known as the Lost Trail Maze, panning for gemstones, a climbing wall, and amusement park style rides. While on the caverns tour, visitors can view a sound, light, and water show that changes with the holidays and seasons. Before being commercialized as DeSoto Caverns, the cave was well known locally as Kymulga Cave. There is evidence that the cave was formerly used by Native Americans, and it was mined during the Civil War. Cave structure The main room of the cave is just over ten stories high and larger than a football field. The entrance has been enlarged from an earlier period when it was a by hole in the side of a hill. It was thought at one time that the cave system was very large, extending from near Childersburg to Talladega, Alabama. However, explorations have revealed only one place where the cave continues for any distance beyond the main room. At the left end of the rear wall of the main room, the cave continues some two or three hundred yards, ending at a blank wall and a small pool of water. With the possible exception of an underwater exit through this pool, there are no other known unexplored routes in the cave. The caverns are noted for one of the largest continuing accumulations of onyx-marble stalagmites and stalactites in the world. DeSoto Caverns has actively growing rock formations (speleothems). For this reason, guests are not permitted to touch most of the rock formations. History of the caverns =Early Native Americans= A burial site of the early Native American Copena culture can be seen in DeSoto Caverns. The term 'Copena' comes from the first three letters of copper and the last three letters of Galena, two materials commonly found in these burials. Caves were considered good burial spots by the Copena culture because they offered a peaceful and protective environment for the spirits of the dead. The burial was discovered in 1965 by a team of archaeologists from the University of Alabama. It contained the skeletons of five Native Americans, one of whom was a child. Of special note was an immense jawbone that scientists believe belonged to a man who would have been more than seven feet tall. In 1995, DeSoto Caverns officials cooperated with a group of Native Americans who wished to rebury the remains of these five people in an undisclosed area of the cave. =16th century= The arrival of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto and his expedition in 1540 marked the beginning of European recorded history in Alabama. At the time of de Soto's arrival, the Muscogee people inhabited Alabama and other parts of the Southeast. In Talladega County, where DeSoto Caverns is located, the Coosa people represented the Muscogee. The Coosa chiefdom—the first in Alabama's recorded history—extended roughly from Gadsden to Wetumpka, on both sides of the Coosa River. Their capital, also called Coosa (meaning \\"canebrake\\"), was near what is now Childersburg; and just a few miles to the east was DeSoto Caverns, their ancestral cave. The de Soto expedition spent a little over five weeks in the Coosa capital. The Coosa Micco (or chief) warmly welcomed de Soto during a ceremony that took place near the entrance of DeSoto Caverns. Despite the Micco's kindness and an offer of land, de Soto took him hostage and took slaves from among the Coosa people. =18th century= During George Washington's presidency, Benjamin Hawkins was appointed General Superintendent for Indian Affairs, with responsibility for all Native American tribes south of the Ohio River. In December 1796, he visited the upper Creek Indian territory and in his report to the president described the magnificence of DeSoto Caverns. This report makes DeSoto Caverns the first officially recorded cave in the United States. =19th century= Toward the end of the American Civil War, the Confederate Army encouraged families to mine caves for saltpeter, which is used to make gunpowder. The situation became so critical that the Army paid young men to mine saltpeter rather than enlist, with the result that DeSoto Caverns became a saltpeter- mining center. The cave's spring-fed well was an important asset, as the mining of saltpeter involves soil leaching, which requires a lot of water. The well, a leaching trough, and a reconstructed vat used in the saltpeter-mining operations of the Civil War period are on display in the caverns. =Early 20th century= In 1912, the caverns were purchased by Ida Elizabeth Brandon Mathis—a businesswoman and nationally recognized expert on farm economics—and a number of friends with the idea of mining the cave for its abundant onyx, a semi-precious stone. Unfortunately, Mexican onyx became popular about this time, and the partners could not compete with its lower price. The mine was left dormant for several years after initial mining tests. During the Prohibition period (1920–1933), when sales of alcohol were prohibited in the United States, an illegal speakeasy and dance hall was opened in the cavern. Because of frequent shootings and fights, the caverns became known in the early 1920s as \\"The Bloody Bucket,\\" and the establishment was eventually closed down by federal agents. In the mid 1920s, Ida Mathis's son Allen bought out the other mining partners' interest in the caverns and secured all underground rights to the property and surrounding areas. Throughout its first half-century, the cave was a popular place of exploration for young romantics and teenage spelunkers. In the early 1960s, Mathis, along with Mr. Fred Layton, began to develop the caverns into a show cave, and high-powered electric lights were installed to show off the caverns' colorful onyx. The attraction was initially opened to the public under the name KyMulga Onyx Cave, after a group of Chickasaw Indians who had established the Indian village Kymulga a few miles away on Talladega Creek around 1960. =Late 20th century= Allen Mathis' son and grandson—Allen W. Mathis, Jr., and Allen Mathis, III—took over the caverns' operation in 1975. The following year the caverns were renamed DeSoto Caverns in honor of Hernando de Soto. New lighting was installed, pathways were widened, and improvements were added to allow larger groups of visitors. Back areas of the cave never before accessible to visitors were opened in 1980. The 1980s also saw the development of a light, sound, and water show and the addition of a playground, a gift shop, and a cantina. Camping facilities were enlarged and updated. In the 1990s, the climbing wall and gemstone panning features were added. DeSoto Caverns was added to the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on July 19, 1976.

Early life and education Jocelyn Cadbury was born in 1946, the son of Laurence Cadbury and Joyce née Mathews, and the younger brother of Sir Adrian Cadbury and Sir Dominic Cadbury. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a degree in Economics and Anthropology. Alongside his academic studies, he was a keen rower. In 1970, he began working at Lucas Industries in Birmingham, as an industrial relations officer. From 1974, he worked for Cadbury. Political career At the 1979 general election, on his second attempt, Cadbury was elected Member of Parliament for Birmingham Northfield, defeating Labour incumbent Raymond Carter. It was one of the Conservatives' best and most surprising results in that election, as a Labour majority of 10,597 was overturned into a Conservative one of 204 on a 10.2% swing. Cadbury argued for an alternative economic strategy to help the manufacturing industry. Together with other Conservative MPs, he supported a September 1981 pamphlet called \\"Changing Gear\\", which criticised the government's economic approach. In November 1981, Cadbury was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State for Industry, Norman Lamont. Death In July 1982, Cadbury committed suicide. He shot himself in the garden of his parents' home in Birmingham. He was 36.

It is part of the Grey Mare's Tail Nature Reserve which is owned by the National Trust for ScotlandNational Trust for Scotland: Grey Mare's Tail Nature Reserve. According to tradition, Dob's Linn is named for a covenanter, Halbert Dobson, who took refuge there from Government troops during The Killing Time in the late 17th century. Dob's Linn is important in geology as the location of the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) which marks the boundary between the Ordovician and Silurian periods, and marks the base of the Llandovery epoch, on the geologic time scale. Dob's Linn was ratified as the GSSP by the International Union of Geological Sciences in 1984. The boundary is defined as the first appearance of graptolites Parakidograptus acuminatus and Akidograptus ascensu 1.6 m above the base of the Birkhill Shale Formation. The shale section also contains chitinozoa and conodonts, but neither are well preserved. Dob's Linn has been criticized for the difficulty in relating its graptolite biostratigraphic sequence with shallow water sequences elsewhere, although the stratotype also appears to correspond with a carbon-13 isotope excursion in the latest Ordovician which can be identified worldwide. The area was first studied by Charles Lapworth in the late 19th century. His work established fossil graptolites as a method of understanding stratigraphic sequences. A more recent description of the area, enumerating the zones established by Lapworth, is given in the British Regional Geology Monograph. Before Lapworth's work, it was thought that the Silurian rocks of the Southern Uplands formed a single sequence, that would have to be about 6000m in thickness. By his identification of particular graptolite species in different zones of the Dob's Linn exposure, Lapworth was able to demonstrate that the Uplands consist of a much thinner layer, consistent with Silurian deposits elsewhere, that had been repeatedly folded and faulted, with multiple repetitions of the same strata, often upside down. The understanding that sequences of sedimentary rocks could be inverted played an important part in the later resolution of the Highlands Controversy in which Lapworth was also involved.

In 1960, he won the Hopeful Stakes aboard that year's Eclipse Award 2-year-old champion, Hail To Reason.

Nicknamed \\"Red\\", he played for the Boston Braves and the Cleveland Indians from 1923 to 1927. He batted and threw right-handed. Although he primarily played as a third baseman, Padgett was utilized at shortstop and second base as well. Padgett played minor league baseball for the Memphis Chicks of the Southern Association until 1922, when he was drafted by the Boston Braves in that year's Rule 5 draft. After making his debut in 1923 and spending three seasons with the Braves, Padgett's contract was purchased by the Cleveland Indians, where he spent the next two years of his career before playing his last game on July 30, 1927. He died on April 15, 1957 in East Orange, New Jersey. Padgett is best known for turning the fourth unassisted triple play in Major League Baseball history on October 6, 1923. Personal life Padgett was born on March 1, 1899, in Philadelphia. He became a foreman at a manufacturing company after he retired from baseball in 1930. He was married to Edith. Together, they had one son, Joseph, who was fatally injured in 1937 while playing basketball. Edith joined the WAAC as a private in 1942. This is because she felt she would be symbolically taking their deceased son's place, as he would have been twenty-one years old and thus eligible for conscription into the army. Before reporting for duty, Edith taught Ernie how to cook. When asked which one was more challenging to accomplish, Padgett joked that making an unassisted triple play was \\"much easier than making a soufflé.\\" Professional career =Draft and minor leagues= Padgett began his career for the Memphis Chicks, a minor league baseball team that were members of the Southern Association. He played for the team until , when he was drafted in that season's Rule 5 draft by the Boston Braves. He made his major league debut for the Braves on October 3, 1923 at the age of 24, entering the game as a pinch-hitter for pitcher Joe Oeschger. =Boston Braves (1923–1925)= In just the second game of his major league career (as well as the Braves' final game of the season), Padgett achieved baseball history when he executed the fourth unassisted triple play on October 6, doing so against the Philadelphia Phillies. In the fourth inning of the game, Padgett, playing shortstop, caught Walter Holke's line drive, stepped on second base to retire Cotton Tierney, and then tagged outfielder Cliff Lee before he was able to return to first base. Although this was the fourth unassisted triple play in the MLB, it was the first recognized triple play to be accomplished in the National League (even though Paul Hines is sometimes credited with being the first to turn an unassisted triple play back in , his play has been labeled \\"dubious\\" and would not have been considered unassisted even by 19th century rules). In the following season, Padgett was involved in an arguable lineup substitution during a May 17 game against the Cincinnati Reds. After being drilled in the head by a pitch, Padgett was permitted by the umpires to have a pinch runner replace him while he sat out and recuperated from his dizziness. However, he was allowed to return to the game and play. This substitution, which was known as utilizing a \\"courtesy runner\\", is now banned under Rule 3.04 of the official rules of the MLB. The 1924 season turned out to be Padgett's most complete season, resulting in many personal bests. He played 138 games and amassed 128 hits, 25 doubles, 9 triples, 46 runs batted in and hit the only home run in his career. Defensively, his fielding percentage of .967 was the third highest amongst all third basemen in the league. However, Padgett also had the fourth highest number of strikeouts in the league with 56. Though he raised his batting average to a career high of .305 in , Padgett was limited to just 86 games that year. At the end of the season, the Cleveland Indians purchased his contract from the Braves for cash only, with no players exchanged in the transaction. =Cleveland Indians (1926–1927)= Padgett arrived in Cleveland and served as the temporary replacement for the injured Johnny Hodapp, who suffered from sprained ankle at the time. However, his playing time was extremely limited, as he appeared in only 36 games for the Indians that season. In , he featured in just 7 games before being released by the organization on July 30. Padgett had spent only five seasons in the Majors. =Back to the minors= Padgett returned to minor league baseball, joining the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association. He spent two seasons playing for the team and was considered an offensive and defensive upgrade for the Pelicans. Padgett was granted an unconditional release in 1930, whereupon he joined the Charlotte Hornets, who were ranked as Class B in the South Atlantic League. In the middle of that season, he signed with the Reading Keystones of the International League and played for them for the remainder of the year before retiring completely from baseball.

He was born in Woodford County, Kentucky on his family's plantation, \\"Rose Hill.\\" At the time of his birth his namesake, Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of the French, was at the height of his power. Buford graduated from West Point in 1827 and served for eight years in the artillery and in 1835 resigned from the service to become an engineer. He thereafter engaged in iron manufacturing and banking at Rock Island, Illinois and became president of the Rock Island and Peoria Railroad, which went bankrupt when major Southern bonds were defaulted with the start of the Civil War. Career In the U.S. Civil War, he first served as colonel of the 27th Illinois Infantry, fighting at the Battle of Belmont. He then commanded the so-called \\"Flotilla Brigade\\" of the Army of the Mississippi during the Battle of Island Number Ten.

For the rest of the war, Buford served as commander of the District of East Arkansas. Buford was mustered out of the army on August 24, 1865. On July 5, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Buford for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 19, 1867. Personal life Buford's younger half brother, John Buford, was also a West Point graduate (Class of 1848) and a general in the Union Army during the Civil War, commanding the 1st Division, Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac.

In Lawless, AWOL soldier Tracy Lawless infiltrates his brother Ricky's former gang to find out who murdered Ricky. A second series began in February 2008, and ran for seven issues. The first three issues, overlapping stories from the points of view of three characters involved in organized crime in the 1970s, were collected as The Dead and the Dying (issues 1-3, 2008). Issues 4-7 were collected as Bad Night (issues 4-7, 2009). A third series ran for five issues in 2009-2010, and was collected as The Sinners (2010). A fourth series followed in 2011, which ran for four issues, and was collected as The Last of the Innocent (2011).

With his partner Ivan, Tommy Patterson ran the city's most proficient crew of pickpockets and taught the trade to his eight- year-old son, Leo. When Tommy was arrested and imprisoned for the murder of Teeg Lawless, Ivan took care of Leo and explained to him how following certain rules can keep a criminal \\"out in the world,\\" out of both prison and the morgue. Around the same time, Teeg Lawless' two sons were arrested. While his fifteen-year-old brother Ricky was sent to a juvenile work camp, Tracy Lawless was given the option of going to prison or enlisting in the armed forces.

(蕭長懋) (458–493), courtesy name Yunqiao (雲喬), nickname Baize (白澤), formally Crown Prince Wenhui (文惠太子, literally \\"the civil and benevolent crown prince\\"), later further posthumously honored as Emperor Wen (文皇帝) with the temple name of Shizong (世宗), was a crown prince of the Chinese dynasty Southern Qi. He was Emperor Wu (Xiao Ze)'s oldest son, but predeceased his father. After his death, his son Xiao Zhaoye became crown prince and eventually succeeded Emperor Wu, but was soon thereafter overthrown by Emperor Wu's cousin Xiao Luan, who took over the throne. By 498, all of Xiao Zhangmao's descendants had been exterminated.  Background  Xiao Zhangmao was born in 458, when his father Xiao Ze was just 18, and because he was the oldest grandson of his grandfather Xiao Daocheng, who was a Liu Song general at the time, he was much favored by his grandfather. His mother was Xiao Ze's wife Pei Huizhao (裴惠昭). In 477, after Xiao Daocheng had seized power after assassinating the violent Emperor Houfei of Liu Song and made Emperor Houfei's brother Liu Zhun emperor (as Emperor Shun), the general Shen Youzhi rose against him from Jing Province (荊州, modern central and western Hubei), and as Xiao Ze defended Penkou (湓口, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi) in preparation for a possible eventual attack by Shen, he made Xiao Zhangmao his assistant in reviewing the troops. After Shen was defeated, Xiao Zhangmao initially returned to the capital Jiankang to serve under his grandfather, but subsequently was made the governor of Yong Province (雍州, modern southwestern Henan and northwestern Hubei).  As Prince of Nan Commandery  In 479, Xiao Daocheng seized the throne from Emperor Shun, ending Liu Song and starting Southern Qi, as its Emperor Gao. Xiao Ze was created crown prince, and in an unprecedented action, Xiao Zhangmao was created the Prince of Nan Commandery. (Prior to Xiao Zhangmao, there had not been any Southern Dynasties sons of living crown princes who were created imperial princes.) In 480, he was recalled to Jiankang to serve as the defender of the key fortress Shitou. When his mother Crown Princess Pei died later that year, by suggestion of the prime minister Wang Jian, Prince Zhangmao was prevented from carrying out full mourning customs for his mother, due to the importance of his post, but his defense post was moved from Shitou to the important suburb of Xizhou (西州). In 482, he was made the governor of South Xu Province (南徐州, modern western central Jiangsu). After Emperor Gao died in 482, Xiao Ze succeeded him (as Emperor Wu), and Xiao Zhangmao was created crown prince. His wife Princess Wang Baoming was created crown princess, and their oldest son Xiao Zhaoye was created the Prince of Nan Commandery.  As crown prince  Xiao Zhangmao was close to his brother, Xiao Ziliang (蕭子良) the Prince of Jingling, and both were adherents of Buddhism. Despite his Buddhist beliefs, however, Xiao Zhangmao was wasteful and luxurious in his living—using many items that were appropriate only for emperors, although he was also praised as kind and hospitable. However, he was apprehensive of his impulsive but militarily-minded brother Xiao Zixiang (蕭子響) the Prince of Badong, and when Xiao Zixiang executed a number of his staff members in 490, drawing Xiao Ze's ire in sending troops against him, Xiao Zhangmao secretly instructed the general Xiao Shunzhi (蕭順之) (father of Emperor Wu of Liang, who founded a new dynasty) not to permit Xiao Zixiang to return to Jiankang alive, and later, even though Xiao Zixiang submitted to Xiao Shunzhi and requested to meet his father to confess his crimes, Xiao Shunzhi strangled Xiao Zixiang to death. Xiao Zhangmao disliked Emperor Wu's cousin (Emperor Gao's nephew) Xiao Luan the Marquess of Xichang, and once told Xiao Ziliang: :I do not like him. I do not know the reason, but all I can say is that he does not have sufficient blessings. Xiao Ziliang, who was friendly with Xiao Luan, tried to defend Xiao Luan, but Xiao Zhangmao would not hear it. Late in Emperor Wu's reign, he favored time on feasting and tours, and he often had Crown Prince Zhangmao rule on important matters, and therefore the crown prince's authority was well established in the empire. However, he was also often ill, perhaps aggravated by his large build. In spring 493, he died. Emperor Wu soon created his son Xiao Zhaoye to succeed him as crown prince, and when Emperor Wu died later that year, Xiao Zhaoye became emperor, but was overthrown and killed by Xiao Luan in 494. Xiao Luan initially made Xiao Zhangmao's another son Xiao Zhaowen emperor, but later that year deposed and killed him as well and took over as emperor directly (as Emperor Ming). By 498, Emperor Ming had also killed Xiao Zhangmao's other two sons Xiao Zhaoxiu (蕭昭秀) the Prince of Baling and Xiao Zhaocan (蕭昭粲) the Prince of Guiyang, exterminating Xiao Zhangmao's line. Traditional historians attribute Emperor Ming's killing of Xiao Zhangmao's sons as payback for Xiao Zhangmao's dislike of him, but as modern historian Bo Yang observed, Emperor Ming also killed the sons of Emperors Gao and Wu, both of whom treated him with kindness and respect.

Born in Mullinahone, County Tipperary, Curran first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Tipperary minor teams as a dual player before later joining the under-21 hurling side. He joined the senior panel during the 2001 championship. Curran subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won one All-Ireland medal, four Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Curran won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a one-time championship medallist with Mullinahone. His brothers, Niall and Seán, have also represented Tipperary in both Gaelic football and hurling respectively. Throughout his career Curran made 43 championship appearances. After being released from the Tipperary senior team he announced his retirement on 30 April 2015. Playing career =University= During his studies at the Waterford Institute of Technology, Curran was an automatic inclusion on the college hurling team. After losing the decider in 2002, his side were back the following year and faced Cork Institute of Technology in the final. A 0–13 to 1–7 victory gave Curran a Fitzgibbon Cup medal as captain of the team. =Club= After winning several divisional championship titles with Mullinahine, the highlight of Curran's club career came in 2002 when the club reached the final of the senior championship for only the second time in their history. Local kingpins Thurles Sarsfields provided the opposition, however, in spite of leading by six points coming into the final quarter, the game ended in a 0–14 apiece draw. The replay was more conclusive. Eoin Kelly scored a remarkable 2–7 as Mullinahone claimed a 2–10 to 1–11 victory. Not only was it Curran's first championship medal but it was also a first title for Mullinahone. =Inter-county= Curran was just sixteen years-old when he made his minor championship debut for Tipperary as a dual player in 1998. He collected a Munster medal the following year after a 1–13 to 2–7 defeat of Clare. After failing to make the under-21 team in 2000, Curran spent the following two seasons on the team, however, Limerick dominated the championship at the time. Curran made his senior debut for Tipperary on 15 April 2001 in a 0–20 to 2–8 defeat of Cork in the group stage of the National Hurling League. He later won a league medal, albeit as a non-playing substitute, following a 1–19 to 0–17 defeat of Clare. Curran was later included on Tipperary's championship panel and collected a set of Munster and All-Ireland medals, once again as a non-playing substitute, following respective defeats of Limerick and Galway. On 13 July 2002 Curran made his senior championship debut in a 2–19 to 1–9 qualifier defeat of Offaly. He became a regular member of the team in the last line of defence, however, Tipperary endured a disappointing period. After remaining undefeated during their 2008 league campaign, Tipperary qualified for the decider against Galway. A Lar Corbett goal proved decisive in the 3–18 to 3–16 victory. It was Curran's first league medal on the field. He later collected a first Munster medal on the field of play as Tipperary continued their winning streak with a 2–21 to 0–19 defeat of a resurgent Clare. Tipperary retained their provincial crown in 2009, with Curran collecting a second Munster medal following a 4–14 to 2–16 defeat of Waterford. On 6 September 2009 Tipperary faced four-in-a-row hopefuls Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. For long periods Tipp looked the likely winners, however, late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their efforts to secure a 2–22 to 0–23 victory. Three successive Munster titles proved beyond Tipperary, however, in spite of a shock defeat by Cork in the provincial quarter-final, Tipperary used the qualifiers to good effect and qualified for the All-Ireland decider on 5 September 2010. Kilkenny were the opponents once again as they sought a fifth successive All-Ireland crown title. \\"The Cats\\" lost talisman Henry Shefflin early in the game due to injury, while Tipp's Lar Corbett ran riot and scored a hat-trick of goals before Noel McGrath added a fourth. The 4–17 to 1–18 victory gave Curran his first All-Ireland medal on the field of play. He later won a first All-Star. Tipperary reclaimed the provincial crown in 2011 following a huge 7–19 to 0–19 drubbing of Waterford in the decider. It was Curran's third Munster medal. Tipperary subsequently faced Kilkenny in a third successive All-Ireland decider on 4 September 2011. Goals by Michael Fennelly and Richie Hogan in either half gave Kilkenny, who many viewed as the underdogs going into the game, a 2–17 to 1–16 victory. In spite of this defeat Curran later collected a second successive All-Star. Curran was appointed captain of the team in 2012 as Tipperary won their fourth Munster crown in five years. The 2–17 to 0–16 defeat of Waterford gave Curran a fourth provincial winners' medal. Pádraic Maher replaced Curran as Tipperary's first- choice full-back in 2014, with the latter being dropped to the bench. He played no part during the championship campaign which eventually saw Tipperary face an All-Ireland final draw and subsequent defeat by old rivals Kilkenny. On 30 April 2015, He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling the next day. =Inter-provincial= Curran also had the honour of lining out for Munster in the Inter-provincial Championship on a number of occasions. He secured a winners' medal in this competition in 2005 following a 1–21 to 2–14 defeat of Leinster.

At Paramount, he starred in melodrama and comedy. In 1933, his contract with Paramount ran out and he moved to MGM for one year. As the decade progressed, Holmes' career declined, and he appeared in a few box-office failures, including Sam Goldwyn's poorly received Nana (1934). His last American movie was General Spanky (1936). In 1938, he appeared in two UK movies. Housemaster was his last film, and he returned to acting on stage in the United States. Scandal In 1933, Holmes was driving with actress Mae Clarke when he crashed into a parked car. Clarke, who suffered a broken jaw and facial cuts, sued Holmes for , claiming that he had been driving while drunk. Clarke dropped the suit when Holmes agreed to pay her medical expenses.

It is the first segment of the planned Washington-New York Northeast Maglev project. Proposed construction and progress of project = Previous efforts = The idea of using a high-speed maglev transportation system to link Washington DC and Baltimore dates back to the 1990s. Section 1218 of the \\"Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century\\" created a National Magnetic Levitation Transportation Technology Deployment Program. The program is administered by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), a unit of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The objective of the program is to demonstrate high-speed maglev technology in commercial service through a project of about 40 miles in length, so that it can be considered later in the century for implementation in a longer distance intercity corridor application. Section 1218 envisioned $1 billion in federal funding for a single demonstration system which must be matched by other sources 2 to 1. FRA selected seven projects for further study in May 1999, and they received $55 million in further funding to develop their proposals. Of these seven, Baltimore–Washington and Pittsburgh advanced to next stage as semi-finalists in April 2001. In 2001, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) published a Record of Decision (ROD) following completion of a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for the Maglev Deployment Program. The purpose of this action was to demonstrate Maglev technology by identifying a viable maglev project in the US, and assisting a public/private partnership with the planning, financing, construction, and operation of a project. As published in the ROD, FRA concluded that Maglev was an appropriate technology for use in new transportation options in Maryland and Pennsylvania and should be further studied at the project level. In coordination with MDOT’s Maryland Transit Administration (MTA), FRA then prepared and circulated a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in 2003, for a maglev project linking downtown Baltimore, BWI Marshall Airport, and Union Station in Washington, DC. The DEIS documented project needs, including transportation demand, regional economic growth, and reducing corridor congestion. The DEIS also documented feasible mitigation measures for the environmental impacts as well as the benefits of the project alternatives. In 2007, FRA prepared a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS); however, the FEIS was not finalized. Federal funding of the project development continued through fiscal year 2004. However, due to legislation passed by the state of Maryland in 2004, the Baltimore–Washington project dropped out and did not receive federal funding for fiscal year 2005. Instead, the program funded Pittsburgh and a line between Las Vegas and Anaheim in fiscal year 2005, with all federal funding removed from the program after that year. In 2009, the Maryland Department of Transportation released \\"Maryland's FY 2009-2014 Consolidated Transportation Program (CTP)\\" document which is divided into different PDF documents. In the \\"Maryland Transportation Administration\\" document on page 42, marked \\"Page MTA-38\\" in the lower-right hand corner is a listing for the Maglev System Study which lists under description: \\"Feasibility study and preparation of environmental documentation involved with operating magnetic levitation trains between Baltimore and Washington, with a stop at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport.\\" the justification section is very interesting in that the Maryland Transit Administration has received \\"special federal funding as part of a national demonstration of Maglev technology\\" it continued that \\"if feasibility is demonstrated, Maglev could provide rapid and efficient transportation between Baltimore, Washington, and BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport.\\" The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 revived federal funding of intercity high-speed rail, particularly in the context of the Las Vegas to Anaheim route. Northeast Maglev, a private U.S. company, revived the project in 2010. In November 2013 the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, proposed fully financing a high-speed maglev link between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., to president Obama. Interest increased for the Baltimore to Washington, D.C., project in 2015 when Maryland Governor Larry Hogan visited Japan to ride an advanced prototype maglev train which traveled at 311 miles per hour (500 km/h) and some $28 million of U.S. funding was tapped to study the project. = Current effort = In 2016, the cost of the D.C.-Baltimore connection with three stops, one in each city and at Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport, was estimated between $10 billion and $12 billion, of which Northeast Maglev said it had secured $5 billion from Japan. The route had not been decided. In September 2016, the Maryland Transit Administration started conducting an environmental impact study. The review process was expected to be finalized in mid-2019 but instead was paused at that time for a lack of details about the design and engineering. Sometime in May 2020, the environmental impact study review process has restarted and as of May 28, 2020, the target completion date for the draft EIS is March 26, 2021 and the target completion date for a combined final EIS and Record of Decision is January 28, 2022.

Grand Prix is considered the \\"main game\\", with players racing around five circuits, with new drawings unlocked in this mode. Spot Race is a time attack mode centered on unlocked drawings. Formation begins with the player starting with one dot and having to collect small pellets to fill up a meter. When the meter is sufficiently filled up, another dot will appear to assist in the collection of pellets. While only the player's dot can be directly controlled, additional dots can be manipulated by holding down the appropriate Formation button. A WiiWare version was released in North America on May 24, 2010 and in the PAL region on June 25, 2010, under the name light trax. =Coloris= Coloris sees players eliminating colored squares by altering the color of other squares to make them the same color as the squares nearby. The game features two different game modes: clear mode and score mode. In clear mode the player must eliminate a certain number of squares (depending on the difficulty level) before moving on to the next level. In score mode the player must eliminate squares to achieve a high score. =Orbital= =Soundvoyager= Soundvoyager is intended to be played using sound only, without looking at the console's screen. The game involves several different subgames, one of which has players trying to center a dot on a side-scrolling stage on top of an invisible target by only using sounds from the left and right speakers to guide them and another involves the player driving the wrong way down a three-lane road trying to dodge oncoming vehicles by listening to which lane they are in. =Digidrive= Digidrive is the seventh and final installment of the bit Generations series. Developed by Q-Games, it is the only game in the series not developed by skip Ltd. The objective of the game is to propel the disc-shaped core to as many meters as possible before the piston collides into the core and ends the game. The player must direct up to three different varieties of \\"vehicle,\\" each of a different color, into one of four different lanes. If five of the same vehicle fill up the same lane, a triangle will appear and the lane will change to the same color as the type of vehicle that entered this lane. A DSiWare version was released in the PAL regions under the name Intersect on October 2, 2009, and under the original Digidrive title in Japan on November 4, 2009 and in North America on November 16, 2009.

She is shown performing in Azemia oder die Wilden in the Leopoldstadt Theater Maria Anna Josepha Francisca Gottlieb (29 April 1774 – 4 February 1856) was an Austrian soprano. She was the first Pamina in Mozart's opera The Magic Flute. She was born in Vienna, one of four sisters. Her parents were actors, who worked in the German theatre company of the Nationaltheater,Grove Encyclopedia of Opera, cited below and all four sisters were raised to the family trade, working as actresses as children.New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, article \\"Anna Gottlieb\\" Anna first acted at the Burgtheater at age five.New Grove Dictionary Shortly after she turned 12 (1 May 1786), she premiered the role of Barbarina in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro. At fifteen, she appeared in the role of Amande in Paul Wranitzky's opera Oberon, König der Elfen (\\"Oberon, King of the Elves\\"). This production featured in the leading role the soprano Josepha Hofer, who was Mozart's sister-in-law and later premiered the role of the Queen of the Night in Mozart's The Magic Flute. When in 1789 the actor and impresario Emanuel Schikaneder brought his troupe to be the resident company at the Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna, Gottlieb became a soprano in the company, singing in various Singspiele. When Mozart composed The Magic Flute for the Schikaneder company, he chose Gottlieb, aged seventeen, for the leading role of Pamina, the pinnacleThis opinion is given, for instance, in the Grove Encyclopedia of Opera of her career. In 1792 Gottlieb moved to the Theater in der Leopoldstadt, where, during the years 1803–17 under the direction of Carl Friedrich Hensler,http://www.musiklexikon.ac.at/ml/musik_H/Hensler_Carl.xml (in German) she was \\"mainstay of the company\\" (New Grove). She appeared in a number of parody works, and was admired for her ability to lampoon operatic sopranos, having had direct experience in this area herself. Her greatest success at the Leopoldstadt Theater was in the role of Hulda in Ferdinand Kauer's play Das Donauweibchen (1798).Grove Encyclopedia of Opera Her career was interrupted between 1809 and 1813 owing to the Napoleonic wars, and when she returned to the stage her voice had declined. As she aged, she gradually changed roles, eventually becoming a character singer playing roles of old women. In 1828 a new director, Rudolf Steinkeller,Ferdinand Raimund took over the Leopoldstadt Theater, and the declining singer was dismissed. She had no pension from her former employer and sank into poverty, appealing in vain from time to time for the Emperor to give her a pension. In 1842 she contacted a newspaper editor, L. V. Frankl, introducing herself as \\"the first Pamina\\"; Frankl undertook a fundraising campaign that enabled Gottlieb to visit Salzburg for the unveiling of a monument to Mozart. She was the last singer alive in Vienna who had known Mozart. The aging Gottlieb was mocked, much later, in the 1896 memoirs of Wilhelm Kuhe:Pianist and impresario, born in Prague. http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/55431?_fromAuth=1 :\\"[at the 1842 Mozart commemoration] there entered a very tall, thin and eccentric-looking woman who at once exclaimed as though addressing an audience, 'I am the first Pamina' ... she seemed to think that she had at least an equal claim with Mozart to be an object of universal veneration\\".Quoted from the New Grove.

Howard's 1933 film The Power and the Glory with Spencer Tracy was overlooked for decades, but in recent years it has received significant reappraisal due to recognition that the film was a major influence on the structure of Citizen Kane. Howard began directing 1940's Knute Rockne, All American, but after a disagreement with the studio was replaced by Lloyd Bacon. The film includes the scene in which future President of the United States Ronald Reagan, portraying terminally ill football player George Gipp, asks Rockne to have the team \\"win just one for the Gipper\\". Howard married his wife, Margaret Howard, in Las Vegas in 1949. After suffering from a throat malignancy, which started in 1953, he died in Los Angeles on February 21, 1954 at the age of 54. On February 8, 1960, he was awarded the posthumous honor of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1500 Vine Street.

The subgenre originated in the United States and achieved peak viewership from the mid-1980s through the end of the 1990s. Airing mostly during the day and distributed mostly through television syndication, tabloid talk shows originated in the 1960s and early 1970s with series hosted by Joe Pyne, Les Crane, and Phil Donahue; the format was popularized by personal confession- filled The Oprah Winfrey Show, which debuted nationally in 1986. The format has since been emulated outside the United States, with the United Kingdom, Latin America and the Philippines all having popular shows that fit the format. Tabloid talk shows have sometimes been described as the \\"freak shows\\" of the late 20th century, since most of their guests were outside the mainstream. The host invites a group of guests to discuss an emotional or provocative topic – ranging from marital infidelity to more outlandish topics – and the guests are encouraged to make public confessions and resolve their problems with on-camera \\"group therapy\\". Similar shows are popular throughout Europe. Tabloid talk shows are sometimes described using the pejorative slang term \\"Trash TV\\", particularly when producers appear to purposely design their shows to create controversy or confrontation, as in the case of Geraldo (such as when a 1988 show featuring Ku Klux Klan and Neo-Nazi members, anti-racist people and Jewish activists led to an on-camera brawl) and The Jerry Springer Show, which focused on lurid trysts – often between family members. Vicki Abt, Ph.D., professor of sociology and American studies, criticized tabloid TV shows, claiming that they have blurred the lines between normal and deviant behavior. The genre experienced a particular spike during the 1990s, when a large number of such shows were on the air, but which gradually gave way during the 2000s to a more universally appealing form of talk show. History The Les Crane Show, a network talk show that aired on ABC as part of its late-night schedule from August 1964 to February 1965, was the first talk show to follow the format. Host Les Crane would bring on controversial guests, interview them in an aggressive but fair style, and take questions from the audience. Crane was the first to interview an openly gay man on-air and frequently interviewed black celebrities, folk singers and other taboo guests; Crane was rebuffed in his efforts to interview lesbians on one of his shows. The format was designed as competition to NBC's long-running franchise, Tonight, and its hard style contrasted with Tonight's more comedic format. The show generated significant controversy and was canceled after six months, later being retooled into a lighter talk show in an effort to boost ratings. Joe Pyne, a Los Angeles-based host, also hosted a similar talk show in syndication, although the focus was more on his confrontations with guests and less on audience participation. In Chicago, Lee Phillip occasionally addressed controversial topics within the context of her long-running talk show as early as the late 1950s, but her show did not have a studio audience. = Trash TV = The subgenre is sometimes described in pejorative slang as \\"trash TV\\", particularly when the show hosts appear to purposely design their shows to create controversy or confrontation. One of the earliest of the post-Oprah shows was Geraldo, which was oriented toward controversial guests and theatricality. As an example, one of the early show topics was titled \\"Men in Lace Panties and the Women Who Love Them\\". One 1988 episode featuring racist skinheads ended in a brawl that left host Geraldo Rivera with a broken nose. This incident led to Newsweeks characterization of his show as \\"Trash TV\\". The term was subsequently applied to tabloid talk shows at their most extreme; some hosts, such as Jerry Springer, have proudly accepted the label, while other hosts, such as Jenny Jones, resent it. The Jerry Springer Show would gain a reputation as the most confrontational and sexually explicit, with stories of lurid trysts – often between family members, and with stripping guests and audience members. Although the show started as a politically oriented talk show, the search for higher ratings in an extremely competitive market led Springer to topics often described as tawdry and provocative, increasing its viewership in the process. Topics included partners admitting their adultery to each other, women or men admitting to their partners that they were transvestites who had convinced their partners that they were a different sex, or revealing that they were pre- or post-op transsexuals, paternity tests, numerous features on the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups, and an exposé of shock rock featuring El Duce from The Mentors and an appearance from GWAR. Violence and fights between guests became almost ritualistic, with head of security Steve Wilkos separating the combatants before fights escalated into something more serious. Though frequently criticized, Springer claimed that he had no creative control over the guests. Maury would go on to become one of the most enduring examples of the format. Debuting the same season as Springer and likewise initially having a more serious focus, host Maury Povich over time developed a largely formulaic series that carved out a niche: by the 2010s, Maury had become almost synonymous with adversarial paternity tests and lie detectors. A typical episode of Maury features an urban poor woman, often with a checkered sexual background, accusing a past sexual partner of being the father of her child, which the man will categorically deny. At the end of the segment, Povich dramatically reveals the results of the paternity test; if the test proves that the man is not the father, he will celebrate boisterously, sometimes infamously in dance or by running into the audience to high-five audience members, as the mother runs backstage sobbing, while if he is determined to be the father, the mother will strut in triumph, sometimes holding a copy of the results and shoving the results into the now-proven father's face. By the 21st century, Maury had already earned a reputation as being \\"miles further down the commode\\" than Springer, and the name of the show would become a byword for dysfunctional parental situations. =Controversy= On an episode of The Jenny Jones Show titled \\"Same-Sex Secret Crushes\\", taped on March 6, 1995, a gay man named Scott Amedure confessed his love for his friend, Jonathan Schmitz. Schmitz reacted with laughter while on the show, but became disturbed by the incident later. He had a history of mental illness and alcohol/drug abuse. Three days after the show's initial airing, Schmitz killed Amedure. Schmitz was later convicted of second degree murder and was sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison. Amedure's family then filed a lawsuit against the producers of The Jenny Jones Show. In interviews, Jones said that her producers told Schmitz that his admirer could be a male, but Schmitz maintained they misled him into thinking it would be a woman. While under oath, Jones admitted that the show did not want Schmitz to know that his admirer was a man. Amedure's family won the initial ruling, and the show was ordered to pay them $25 million. =Decline and resurgence= By the early 2000s, the genre began to decline in popularity with viewers, and certain hosts either saw their shows cancelled due to low ratings (such as Jenny Jones and Sally Jessy Raphaël), died (such as Wally George) or voluntarily ended their shows to pursue other interests (such as Ricki Lake). Many media analysts have attributed the decline in popularity of tabloid talk shows and daytime talk in general to competition from cable and satellite television, and an increased number of women in the workforce (resulting in a corresponding decline in potential viewers for daytime television, a phenomenon that had also mostly killed off the tabloid talk show's predecessor in daytime lineups, the daytime game show, and would later force cutbacks in soap operas, another daytime staple, as well). Common presumptions indicated that viewers were tiring of the constant recycling of subjects that are often shown on such programs. Another explanation would be that the same audience shifted directly over to the new \\"Reality\\" TV and court show genre that rose to prominence at around the same time; most reality television and many court shows featured conflicts and raunchy material that would be normally seen in a tabloid talk show. (When Springer's show was canceled in 2018, it was replaced with a court show hosted by Springer.) As early as the late 1990s, hosts such as Oprah Winfrey, and to a lesser extent Montel Williams, began to distance their programs from the genre by refocusing them to incorporate more serious subject matter or staying on stage in the manner of more traditional talk shows. Another example of this trend was Geraldo Rivera ending his show in 1998 to focus on his CNBC talk show Rivera Live full-time. New talk shows also followed the trend of emphasizing less bawdy themes; The Ananda Lewis Show (which ran from 2001 to 2002) made a point of being an alternative to the tabloid style talk shows still airing at the time. The Phil Donahue Show, seen by many as originating the genre, was cancelled in 1996 as it could not compete with the new crop of shows. Donahue and Rivera would attempt to re- establish their journalistic credentials on cable television: Donahue with a short-lived talk show on MSNBC, and Rivera going back to his \\"roving reporter\\" roots, filing reports on CNBC, NBC and Fox News Channel. Maury Povich began hosting a weekend news show in 2006 with wife Connie Chung on MSNBC while still hosting his daytime show. Weekends with Maury and Connie was cancelled after six months due to low ratings, and received harsh reviews by many of the same critics who criticized his daytime talk show. Jerry Springer, while continuing to host his televised \\"freak show\\", also hosted a more serious talk show on Air America Radio in the mid-2000s. The syndicated Judge Hatchett dealt with many of the topics of tabloid talk shows, but was set within the framework of a court show and was more direct in its efforts to intervene in the participants' lives. Only a handful of the shows from the tabloid talk era remained in production as of 2011, and only one new tabloid talk show premiered between 2000 and that time: The Tyra Banks Show, which ran from 2005 to 2010, was a replacement for Ricki Lake after Lake quit her show. Tyras format was more contemporary in the style of Oprah and Dr. Phil, but had gone over the limits of her show by having her audience members appear in their underwear along with her and most famously, pretending to suffer the effects from rabies to a shocked reaction. Tabloid shows have seen a slight comeback in the late 2000s and early 2010s, although with a greater emphasis on self- help than their predecessors (owing to the popularity of shows such as Dr. Phil). Steve Wilkos eventually left Jerry Springer and received his own syndicated talk show, The Steve Wilkos Show, which debuted in 2007. The once- defunct Tribune Entertainment ordered new pilots for tabloid-style talk shows hosted by radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge and conservative talk radio host Bill Cunningham, for a possible fall 2011 debut; while Bubba's show was not picked up, The Bill Cunningham Show debuted in limited syndication in September 2011 before moving to The CW (becoming the only talk show on U.S. network television not to be lifestyle- or celebrity interview-oriented) in September 2012; Cunningham continued to host the show until he decided to leave in 2016, at which point Robert Irvine took Cunningham's place. An American version of the British tabloid talk show The Jeremy Kyle Show also launched in September 2011. Ricki Lake and The Queen Latifah Show were both slated to return in September 2012, but with revamped, more mature formats (Latifah's as a more celebrity and lifestyle-focused program and Lake's focusing more on lifestyle and self-help topics) to reflect the hosts' increased age; also set to debut was a show hosted by Trisha Goddard, who hosted a tabloid show in the United Kingdom for several years. Lake's new show lasted only a year, and Queen Latifah's was delayed until September 2013 and was cancelled after two years. Goddard and Kyle also failed to gain traction with their U.S. talk show efforts, and both were canceled after two seasons. Face the Truth, a half-hour series which debuted in the fall of 2018, attempted to cross the tabloid format with the panel show with host Vivica A. Fox. The program failed however, and was cancelled after one season. Influence In the scholarly text \\"Freaks Talk Back\\", Yale University sociology professor Joshua Gamson credits the tabloid talk show genre with providing much needed high impact media visibility for gays, bisexuals, transsexuals and transgender people, and doing more to make them mainstream and socially acceptable than any other development of the 20th century. In the book's editorial review Michael Bronski wrote \\"In the recent past, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered people had almost no presence on television. With the invention and propagation of tabloid talk shows such as Jerry Springer, Jenny Jones, Jane Whitney, and Geraldo, people outside the sexual mainstream now appear in living rooms across America almost every day of the week.\\" Gamson credits the tabloid talk show fad with making alternative sexual orientations and identities more acceptable in mainstream society. Examples include a recent Time magazine article describing early 21st century gays coming out of the closet younger and younger, and the decline of suicide rates among gays and lesbians. Gamson also believes that tabloid talk shows caused homosexuals to be embraced on more traditional forms of media. Examples include sitcoms like Will & Grace, primetime shows like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and feature films like the Academy Award-winning Brokeback Mountain. While having changed with the times from her tabloid talk show roots, Winfrey continued to include gay guests by using her show to promote openly gay personalities like her hairdresser, makeup artist, and decorator Nate Berkus who inspired an outpouring of sympathy from middle America after grieving the loss of his partner in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Winfrey's \\"therapeutic\\" hosting style and the tabloid talk show genre has been either credited or blamed for leading the media counterculture of the 1980s and 1990s, which some believe broke 20th century taboos, led to America's self-help obsession and created confession culture. The Wall Street Journal coined the term \\"Oprahfication\\" to refer to the concept of public confession as a form of therapy and Time magazine named Winfrey one of the \\"100 Most Influential People\\" of the 20th century. Sociologist Vicki Abt criticised tabloid talk shows for redefining social norms. In her book Coming After Oprah: Cultural Fallout in the Age of the TV Talk Show, Abt warned that the media revolution that followed Oprah's success was blurring the lines between normal and deviant behavior. Television critic Jeff Jarvis agreed, saying \\"Oprah was the one that trashed daytime TV. She took the Donahue format and then brought on the whiny misfits and losers and screamers and shouters, and then everyone, including Donahue, followed her, until it went overboard. Then finally she came back and recanted and said, no, no, now I'm the queen of quality on TV.\\" Talk shows were often spoofed in mainstream media, with Night Stand with Dick Dietrick being one of the full- length spoofs of the medium (complete with fake guests and audience members asking questions). =Oprah talks to Phil Donahue= In the September 2002 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine, Oprah Winfrey interviewed Phil Donahue at his Manhattan penthouse in what she described as a \\"full-circle\\" moment. She wrote in the article's introduction, \\"If there had been no Phil Donahue show, there would be no Oprah Winfrey show. He was the first to acknowledge that women are interested in more than mascara tips and cake recipes – that we're intelligent, we're concerned about the world around us, and we want the best possible lives for ourselves.\\" In the interview, Donahue explained that \\"the show became a place where women discussed issues that didn't naturally come up, and certainly not in mixed company. Much of what we talked about on the air is what women had been talking about in ladies' rooms.\\" Donahue recalled that he finally had to do a show about doctors who hated him because, for the first time, women were challenging their physicians. He also discussed how hosting the show helped him overcome his own taboos. \\"I put a gay guy on in 1968 – a real live homosexual sitting right next to me. I was terrified ... I'm from Notre Dame. And believe me that's the one thing you didn't want to be doing at Notre Dame was hangin' with gay people ... If you don't understand those feelings then you don't understand homophobia. There's a reason for the closet. As the years went by after that show, I got involved in gay politics, and through my activism, I began to realize what it must be like to be born, to live, and to die in the closet.\\" Donahue also commented on the new crop of tabloid talk shows, such as Jenny Jones – \\"One-Night Stand Reunions\\". When Winfrey reminded him \\"You started all this,\\" he replied, \\"If that's what you think, I'm proud. What I'm most proud of is that we involved the audience more than anybody else in the game. People who owned the airwaves got to use them in this wild thing called democracy.\\" While both Winfrey and Donahue admitted to having done shows that were \\"naughty\\", both wondered if newer shows like Jerry Springer had crossed over into a whole different territory. Reflecting on the genre as a whole Donahue added, \\"If you want to know about America's culture in the last half of the 20th century, watch some of these programs.\\" Europe =In Greece= Annita Pania is the longest living representative of the tabloid talk genre in Greece, which reached its peak during the mid-1990s. =In the United Kingdom= American tabloid talk is widely viewed in the United Kingdom. First-run tabloid chat shows are also produced in the United Kingdom (especially The Graham Norton Show), which are largely similar to their American counterparts, albeit more tame in style. Most hosts get more involved with their guests, rather than taking an apathetic attitude in a fashion similar to Jerry Springer and usually the audience is not as involved. Jeremy Kyle, for example, was known for his confrontational attitude towards those on his programme, The Jeremy Kyle Show, while others like Trisha Goddard are more pacifist. Springer himself hosted a series on ITV as The Jerry Springer Show. Vanessa Feltz's programme The Vanessa Show was cancelled by the BBC in 1999, as a result of the discovery that some participants were actually actors cast from a talent agency, although it was known previously for outlandish stories similar to the American shows.

Music career Mazda was one of the co-founders of Poole punk/mod band Tours, singing and playing lead guitar. They signed to Virgin Records in 1979 after selling large quantities of their self-produced and distributed \\"Language School/Foreign Girls\\" double A side 7\\" single. BBC Radio 1 DJs John Peel and Mike Read championed the band which led to a bidding war between Virgin, Polydor, Sire and EMI records. Eventually the band signed to Virgin, but the association was short-lived after an argument between the band and the label led the other founder/leader Ronnie Mayor to quit. Mazda formed a new band, The Cosmetics, and went on to become the in house producer of IRS Records, working with seminal punk/new wave acts such as The Fall, The Birthday Party, Wall of Voodoo, The Fleshtones, Tom Robinson (including playing guitar in his band), Alternative TV, Yello, Suburban Lawns, Brian James, The Scientists and The Folk Devils. He released a solo album, Hands of Fate, in 1983. Later, Mazda turned his attention back to his first musical love and began working with R&B; musicians such as Average White Band, The JBs, Neneh Cherry, Bootsy Collins and Ultra Nate. Songwriting Mazda also pursued a parallel career as a songwriter. After signing to Warner Chappell Music in 1989 he went on to write, \\"How Long\\", a Billboard R&B; No 1 hit for American singer Ultra Nate which won him a prestigious A.S.C.A.P award. As a writer he contributed to albums by Jamie J. Morgan, The JBs, Average White Band, Clyde \\"Funky Drummer\\" Stubblefield, Nick Kamen and many others. Acting career In January 2005 he formed his own acting troupe, \\"The Queens Players\\" and, a year after emigrating to the USA, he scored an Off Broadway role as 'English' in Scott Brooks' Bag Fulla Money which played at 42nd Street's Clurman Theatre. Mazda has appeared in various Hollywood films including Saving Private Ryan, Batman Begins, Love Actually and Quills. Director After several years in New York Mazda is now the owner of a custom built theatre complex, The Secret Theatre, which grew from the foundation of \\"The Queens Players\\", a classical acting troupe which was founded by Mazda in 2005. In 2007, after a search for a home for The Queens Players, The Secret Theatre was built in a warehouse building, The LIC Arts Center. The initial performance space is now known as The Little Secret after a second larger space The Big Secret was constructed in 2009. This was followed by a third space, POCO which opened in 2010 and then The Studio was built in 2012. The Secret Theatre is now the home of not only The Queens Players, but also acts as a rental house for prestigious off off companies such as Flux Theatre Ensemble and Gideon Productions.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed May 19, 2011 river that flows southward through Kalamazoo County and St. Joseph County, Michigan. Its headwaters are east of the city of Kalamazoo at Portage Lake, and the river flows southwest to its mouth within the city limits of Three Rivers, where it drains into the St. Joseph River. Origin of name Portage, the French word for \\"carry\\", refers to transporting a canoe overland, either between waterways or around an obstacle. The French word is used, although the river was used by the Potawattomi and other Native Americans for trade and transportation before the French arrived. The Portage River and a major tributary, Portage Creek, form a key water link between the drainage basins of the Kalamazoo River and the St. Joseph River. Tributaries of the two rivers run within of each other within what is now the large Kalamazoo suburb of Portage. From the high ground of this suburb, two creeks, both named Portage Creek, run north and south toward their respective drainage basins. The suburban city, creeks, and river are all named after this portage or carrying-place for birch bark and dugout canoes, a key link in the Native American infrastructure of what was to become the state of Michigan. Impact of glaciation The Wisconsin glaciation period left behind a large number of kettles, ponds, and bogs. The headwaters and upper reaches of the Portage River once contained countless examples of post-glacial wetlands. Farmers built drainage ditches to dry out many of the wetter flatlands for arable cropland, and significant population growth south of Kalamazoo has led to further alterations in the landscape. Many of the larger glacial lakes remain: * Austin Lake, in Portage, is the largest lake in the Portage River drainage. * Gourdneck Lake, near Portage, is so called because its unusual shape is said to resemble a mature gourd. * Indian Lake is the site of a longtime campsite of the Potawatomi tribe of Native Americans. * Portage Lake in St. Joseph County (not the source lake in Kalamazoo County with the same name) covers . History of river The Portage River was an early trade route for the Pottawatomi, Ojibwa, Ottawa, and French traders. A pow-wow is held annually in Three Rivers to celebrate this history, along with a reenactor camp of French traders. A famous battle between the Pottawatomi and the Shawnee under Chief Elkhart took place on the banks of the Portage River in 1802, and is commemorated by a plaque in Three Rivers. Portage Creek (the south-flowing Portage Creek, part of the Portage River drainage) drops at what is now the town of Vicksburg. In 1831 John Vickers spied this power source and built a gristmill on the creek, thereby flooding Sunset Lake and founding the town that would be named after him. Dutch and Low German farmers with experience in wetlands horticulture took charge of the river region's wetlands during the decades after the American Civil War. The southern Kalamazoo region was one of the first locations in the United States where celery for salads was grown. (Traditional English and American popular cooking traditions of that time demanded that all vegetables be boiled or otherwise cooked before being served.) For several generations the Portage River area led the nation in celery production. Other specialty crops grown on Portage River \\"muckland\\" included peppermint and spearmint. On the Portage River's high sandy banks further south, strawberries were cultivated. The best known strawberry farm was R. M. Kellogg's in Three Rivers, founded in 1896. The R. M. Kellogg farms also maintained a popular tourist attraction, the Kellogg Gardens, elaborate gardens with many unusual structures, next to the Portage River in the city of Three Rivers. Although the river today is used almost exclusively for recreation, up until the early 1900s it served as a corridor for transportation and commerce. Frank Dentler of Parkville operated a paddle wheel steamboat for the transportation of goods to the railroad lines, down river to Three Rivers and up river to the Portage Station near Portage Lake (St. Joseph County.) The river today Much of the Portage River remains wet and wooded today. Trees have been allowed to re-grow along the river's banks, which are unsuited for agriculture. The river is enjoyed by canoeists and kayakers. Fishing is excellent and includes largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and walleye, but check the State of Michigan Department of Health's fish advisory before eating any river or lake fish. The Portage River's banks form a riparian wetland ecosystem, rich in characteristic species such as painted turtles, wood ducks, and bullfrogs, as well as many rare and unusual native plants and plant communities. The Southwest Michigan Land Conservancy maintains the Hidden Marsh Sanctuary, a wilderness preserve and walking trail along the Portage River just north of the city of Three Rivers. One of the river's headwater bogs remains in conservancy status, namely Bishop's Bog in Portage, Michigan. Dams Dams along the Portage River include the historic Cook's Mill Dam in Kalamazoo County, Parkville Dam and mill site near Parkville, and the Hoffman Street Dam and the Boy's Dam from Hoffman Pond in Three Rivers.

It is located on the third floor of Portage Place mall in downtown Winnipeg. By the end of the 2016-17 season, PTE had presented 340 plays on its thrust stage over its 44 year history, 149 of which were world premieres, to an annual average attendance of 35,000 people. Approximately 700 students enroll annually in onsite acting classes, from adults to children as young as five. Classes range from acting for stage, film and TV to Improv to Theatre Production to Musical Theatre, Voice, Movement and others. Every year, the Prairie Theatre Exchange's Theatre for Young Audiences touring program performs in elementary and junior high schools, as well as for community audiences throughout the province. Educational partners of the PTE include the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg School Division, and other school divisions, alternative learning centres, and community arts groups across the province of Manitoba. During the Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, two of the festival's venues are the Prairie Theatre Exchange's Mainstage and Colin Jackson Studio, and both Folklorama and the Winnipeg Jazz Festival have been regular users of the facilities. PTE also rents office space to Shakespeare in the Ruins, Manitoba Chamber Orchestra, and Patient Puppets, pairing a very low rent with access to office equipment and staff expertise to support those endeavours. History The theatre originated with the Manitoba Theatre School started by the Manitoba Theatre Centre (MTC) in 1960. In 1972-1973, MTC shut down the school, and a group spearheaded by Colin Jackson and Charles Huband founded the Manitoba Theatre Workshop (MTW) to take its place. The organization operated out of the old Grain Exchange building on 160 Princess Street in downtown Winnipeg. Colin Jackson was director of MTW from 1973 to 1976. Originally the Manitoba Theatre Workshop was oriented toward a younger audience, but in 1975, the first adult productions were performed at MTW. These were presented by Confidential Exchange, a studio theatre group of local actors formed in 1974. In 1981, the workshop changed its name to the Prairie Theatre Exchange, to reflect a growing focus on presenting a season of plays for an adult audience, while maintaining its commitment to the School and its younger clientele. Gordon McCall became the Artistic Director that same year. 1982-1983 was an all-Canadian season of the PTE, featuring five world premieres, three of which were by Manitoba playwrights. This emphasis on local plays resulted in a $20,000 loss. In 1983, Kim McCaw was appointed Artistic Director. During that year, subscription packages were introduced for its three-play adult season. 200 subscriptions were sold that season. These numbers increased to over 3500 by the 1985/86 season, and PTE established a reputation as a \\"prairie populist\\" theatre, becoming one of a handful of Canadian theatres at the time to give voice to Canadian stories. The 1986-87 season was a milestone for the PTE. The theatre announced a balanced budget of $1.2 million, the first time that it had surpassed $1 million. From 1987 through 1989, the Prairie Theatre Exchange initiated and completed a move into Portage Place Shopping Centre, with the opening play, Village of Idiots, at the new location on October 12, 1989. The new facility cost $3.5 million, comprised , and the new theatre seated 364. Later, a reconfiguration to improve sightlines resulted in the current house capacity of 323 seats. Michael Springate became Artistic Director in 1991, followed by Allen MacInnis in 1995. In August 2001, the Prairie Theatre Exchange performed overseas for the first time at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, with an all-aboriginal cast in a production of fareWel by Winnipeg playwright Ian Ross. In October 2002, PTE announced the appointment of Robert Metcalfe as Artistic Director for 2003-04, as it celebrated its 30th season. In May 2004, the theatre launched the Carol Shields Festival of New Works. The festival featured staged readings of 21 new plays by 19 Canadian playwrights, and continues to bring together not only theatre companies but also dance companies, filmmakers, visual artists, musicians, and singer-songwriters every year to celebrate the act of creating new work. May 2013 saw the 10th annual Festival. In March 2007, the PTE Playwrights Unit was established with seven local playwrights to use PTE as a base and resource. The current roster of new and established playwrights consists of Joseph Aragon, Sharon Bajer, Rick Chafe, Ginny Collins, Tricia Cooper, James Durham, Debbie Patterson, Ellen Peterson, Marc Prescott, and Alix Sobler. As of November 2013, PTE has given professional productions to four new plays that were developed within the Playwrights' Unit (Sharon Bajer, Burnin' Love - March 2011, Rich Chafe, The Secret Mask - November 2011, Ellen Peterson, The Brink - October 2012, and Tricia Cooper, Social Studies - November 2013). Other new scripts developed by the members of the Playwrights Unite during the past few years have been produced across the country, including a number of Short Shots—ten minute plays specially commissioned by PTE for the Carol Shields Festival. As of April 2007, the total number of plays presented since 1973 reached 278. 131 of these were original works. On November 8, 2007, PTE marked its 35th year with a special fundraising dinner honouring the extraordinary contributions of The Honourable Mr. Charles R. Huband. Mr. Huband, a Life Member of the PTE Board of Directors, was one of the driving forces in the creation of PTE. On January 13, 2011 PTE launched its two-phase Capital Campaign with a goal of $2.2 million. On November 8, 2012 PTE announced that it reached its Capital Campaign goal of $2.5 million. With the completion of Phase 1 of the capital project in the summer of 2011, PTE was able to renovate the lobby, construct a new lounge, and upgrade its washrooms. The main theatre also received new carpeting, reupholstered seats, and fresh paint. The second phase, over the summer of 2012, saw the completion of a new Board Room, updated offices, the completion of a new film studio in the \\"Annex\\" portion of the facility, complete with editing suite, and a new space for the Playwrights Unit that includes a library of Canadian plays, workstations, and meeting area. At the conclusion of the 2011/12 season, PTE's total number of productions increased to 310 over its history. (139 of these were new plays.) In September 2012, the official name of the education program at PTE was changed to PTE Theatre and Film School, to reflect an increasing roster of film and TV acting classes.

GLUT (and hence FreeGLUT) allows the user to create and manage windows containing OpenGL contexts on a wide range of platforms and also read the mouse, keyboard and joystick functions. FreeGLUT is intended to be a full replacement for GLUT, and has only a few differences. Since GLUT has gone into stagnation, FreeGLUT is in development to improve the toolkit. It is released under the MIT License. History FreeGLUT was originally written by Paweł W. Olszta with contributions from Andreas Umbach and Steve Baker. Since Paweł ceased working in 3D graphics, he passed the baton to Steve Baker. Steve is now the official owner/maintainer of FreeGLUT, although John Fay does most of the day-to-day work. Paweł started FreeGLUT development on December 1, 1999. The project is now virtually a 100% replacement for the original GLUT with only a few departures (such as the abandonment of SGI-specific features such as the Dials&Buttons; box and Dynamic Video Resolution) and a shrinking set of bugs. FreeGLUT contains a few enhancements over the original GLUT - but as a matter of policy, no further significant features will be added. In April 2015, FreeGLUT obtained initial support for the new Wayland display server protocol. =OpenGLUT= Some members of the FreeGLUT team who wanted to add features forked the code to create OpenGLUT. Development of OpenGLUT ceased in May 2005; the last release was OpenGLUT-0.6.3 in March 2005. Status FreeGLUT is now very stable and has fewer bugs than the original GLUT. However, there are places where the original GLUT specification did not make clear what order things like callbacks occur and it is possible for application programs that work under GLUT to fail under FreeGLUT because they assume something that GLUT never guaranteed to be true. New revisions appear periodically; however, since it is now quite stable and no new features are planned, these updates are required less and less often. This would change if there was ever a new release of GLUT. FreeGLUT is distributed instead of GLUT in some Linux distributions. Since it is upwards compatible at a binary level, programs compiled for GLUT can be linked to FreeGLUT without problems.

The incident became known as the Rothbury affair or the Rothbury riot, and is described as the \\"bloodiest event in national industrial history.\\" In 1929 colliery owners on the Northern New South Wales coalfields combined as the Northern Collieries Association. On Thursday 14 February 1929 the mine employers gave their 9,750 employees 14 days' notice, that they (the miners) should accept the following new conditions: > A wage reduction of 12½ per cent on the contract rates, one shilling ($0.10) > a day on the \\"day wage\\" rate; all Lodges must give the colliery managers the > right to hire and fire without regard to seniority; all Lodges must agree to > discontinue pit-top meetings and pit stoppages. The miners refused to accept these terms, and on Saturday 2 March 1929, all miners were \\"locked out\\" of their employment.. In September 1929, the NSW State Parliament introduced an Unlawful Assembly Act designed to suppress the miners, which authorised police to break up any gatherings. On 16 December 1929 about 5,000 miners demonstrated against the introduction of non-union labour into the Rothbury mine by the conservative Bavin government, which had taken over the colliery. The government called in 70 New South Wales police officers from districts outside Newcastle to protect the colliery and allow the entry of non-union labour. Angry miners marched to the mine gate led by a pipe band. When they charged the gate bearing clubs and firearms, the miners were met with defensive baton blows by the police and there were hand-to-hand clashes. Three shots had been fired at the police and the order to draw their revolvers and fire a volley of shots over the heads of the rioters and then into the ground. One miner, Norman Brown, received a fatal wound from a ricocheting bullet. The youngest miner was 15-year-old Joseph Cummings, who risked his life, dodging bullets as he ran for the doctor, in a futile effort to help save Brown's life. The Sydney Daily Telegraph Pictorial described the event as \\"the most dramatic industrial clash that has ever shocked Australia.\\". In June 1930, after fifteen months of living in poverty and starvation, the miners capitulated and returned to work on reduced contract wages. However, the lockout failed to break the resolve or organisation of the miners union. The Rothbury mine finally closed in 1974. A monument in honour of Norman Brown is located at North Rothbury.. The site is now a railway workshop, restoring locomotives and rollingstock used on railways in the local coalfields. The word Rothbury has been trademarked by the Fosters Group..

It has been identified with the site of the later town of Monmouth in south east Wales, located adjoining the confluence of the River Monnow with the River Wye. A plaque on the local bank records its position. History and remains The reference to Blestio in the Antonine Itinerary is the only one made to the settlement in Roman sources. It was located on the road between Caerleon (') and Silchester ('), midway between the fort at Usk (') and the iron making centre at ', believed to be at Weston under Penyard near Ross-on-Wye. It is suggested that the name may derive from the Greek word βλαστος, meaning \\"offshoot\\". Blestium at RomanBritain.org . Accessed 2 March 2012 It is now generally accepted that a Neronian or pre-Flavian military fort was established at Monmouth, perhaps before 55 AD, making it the earliest Roman fort in Wales. Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust Historic Landscape Characterisation: Lower Wye Valley, 011 Monmouth. Accessed 2 March 2012 The fort was probably established, either by Publius Ostorius Scapula or his successor Aulus Didius Gallus, during the first advances of the Romans against the Silures of south east Wales. The invading forces established a series of auxiliary forts along the Monnow valley into mid Wales, as well as advancing towards Usk where they established the fort of Burrium. The Silures fought a successful guerrilla war against the Romans for some thirty years before being defeated by the forces led by Sextus Julius Frontinus. The fort at Blestium is believed to have housed around 2,000 soldiers during the initial campaign, and later to have remained as a small fortlet.Monmouth Civic Society, Guide to the Monmouth Heritage Blue Plaque Trail, n.d., p.6 Relatively few Roman remains had been found at Monmouth until recently. The first ditch of the fort was discovered by the Monmouth Archaeological Society behind properties on Monnow Street, within Monmouth town centre. Excavations in 2010 in Agincourt Square also uncovered pottery and bones, which appear to confirm the existence of a fort. South Wales Argus, Roman fort unearthed in Monmouth, 12 August 2010. Accessed 2 March 2012 There is substantial evidence of iron working dating from the Roman period, drawing on local iron ore and charcoal for smelting from local forests. This includes hearths and waste slag, both in the town centre and in the Overmonnow area. Stone buildings associated with 2nd and 3rd century iron working have been excavated near the crossing of the River Monnow. Coins found in the town date mainly from the third and fourth centuries, suggesting continuing civilian settlement. Monmouth Heritage Trail Lloyds TSB bank, Monnow Street The Monmouth Heritage Trail includes a blue plaque recording the Roman fort of Blestium. This is attached to a late eighteenth-century town house which is now used as the Lloyds TSB bank in Monnow Street. The house was occupied, and probably built, by Philip Meakins Hardwick, who was one of the founders of the Monmouth Picnic Club of local gentlemen responsible for developing the viewpoint and buildings on The Kymin around 1800. The house became the home of Monmouth's town clerk and Viscount Nelson and his entourage were entertained there during their visit to the town on 19 August 1802. Another notable resident was said to be the architect Philip Fisher who lived at the house whilst designing improvements to the Shire Hall in the 1720s.

It is about a fictional lake monster in British Columbia. The film was distributed by TriStar Pictures and produced by Triumph Films. Plot Ashley Black is depressed because her father Jack spends all his time focusing on his job instead of her and her older brother Joshua. She constantly records his radio show and listens to it. One day, her father takes them to a remote Canadian lake that was popular with tourists due to a myth about an aquatic monster named Orky. They rented a cabin next to an elderly First Nations man who uses a wheelchair. Jack meets a local psychiatrist, Dr. Wanda Bell, who is trying to aid some local men who claim that they have been possessed by Orky. When Ashley runs away, Jack also has the same experience while looking for her. As a result, he becomes more devoted to his children. Ashley and Joshua find out that the reason that Orky is possessing people is to try and tell them that he is dying because a businessman is dumping toxic waste into the lake. Ashley and Joshua help the old man in the cabin next to theirs to find a totem pole in the woods. With the help of Hiro, the son of Japanese monster seekers, they expose the businessman's illegal dumping. Orky, however, still dies from the poisonous waste. The old man summons a lightning bolt which enters a hole in the cave where Orky lives. Ashley and Hiro stay on the dock overnight and leave some cookies out. When she realizes that the cookies have been eaten, Ashley screams with joy which suggests that Orky is still alive, or reincarnated.

Early life She was born at Stranorlar, in County Donegal, Ireland, the seventh child in a family of twelve children. She was blind as a consequence of an attack of smallpox when she was 18 months old. In her writings, she recounts how she learned by heart the lessons which her brothers and sisters said aloud every evening, and how she bribed them to read to her by doing their chores. She then worked hard at memorising all that she had heard. She composed her first poem, a version of \\"The Lord's Prayer\\", when she was seven years of age.Biography of Frances Brown, from the Preface to Granny's Wonderful Chair First publications In 1841, Browne's first poems were published in the Irish Penny Journal and in the London Athenaeum'. One included in the Irish Penny Journal was the lyric \\"Songs of Our Land\\", which can be found in anthologies of Irish patriotic verse.Pádraig Breathnach: Songs of the Gael. Dublin 1922. p. 5. She published a complete volume of poems in 1844 and a second volume in 1847. The provincial newspapers, especially the Belfast-based Northern Whig, reprinted many, and she became widely known as 'The Blind Poetess of Ulster'. In 1845 she made her first contribution to the popular magazine Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, for which she wrote for the next 25 years. The first story of hers published there, in March 1845, was \\"The Lost New Year's Gift\\", which tells of a poor dressmaker in London and exemplifies her story-telling abilities. She also contributed short stories to magazines with a largely female readership, for example, a number in the 1850s to the Ladies' Companion, a magazine read by many well-to-do women of the Victorian era. Stories she contributed there included the amusing \\"Mrs Sloper's Swan\\" and an eerie tale set in County Fermanagh, called \\"The Botheration of Ballymore\\". Emigration to Edinburgh In 1847, she left Donegal for Edinburgh with one of her sisters as her reader and amanuensis. She quickly established herself in literary circles, and wrote essays, reviews, stories, and poems, in spite of health problems. In 1852, she moved to London, where she wrote her first novel, My Share of the World (1861). Her best known work, Granny's Wonderful Chair, was published in 1856, remains in print to this day, and has been translated into several languages. It is a richly imaginative collection of fairy stories. It was also in 1856 that her third volume of poetry appeared – Pictures and Songs of Home. This was directed at very young children and contains beautiful illustrations. The poems focus on her childhood experiences in County Donegal and provide evocative descriptions of its countryside. London and later life After her move to London, Browne wrote frequently for the Religious Tract Society's periodicals The Leisure Hour and The Sunday at Home. One of those in The Leisure Hour was \\"1776: a tale of the American War of Independence\\", which appeared on the centenary of that event in 1876. As well as describing some of the revolutionary events, it is a love story and beautifully illustrated. Her last piece of writing was a poem called \\"The Children's Day\\", which appeared in The Sunday at Home in 1879. Frances Browne died on 21 August 1879 at 19 St John's Grove, Richmond upon Thames. She was buried in Richmond Cemetery on 25 August 1879.

Blair also edited an anthology of her poems, short stories and essays: The Best of Frances Browne (Limavady: Rathmore Books, c. 2012). Browne's career is treated by Paul Marchbanks in Irish Women Writers: An A-to-Z Guide, edited by Alexander G. Gonzalez (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood; Oxford: Harcourt Education, 2006).

Maurer, Mark Gordon, and Larry Gelbart. The cast also includes Alan Arkin, Jim Broadbent, Michael McKean, Eion Bailey, and Alexa Davalos. Maurer, who originally conceived the story and did extensive research, sold the project to HBO and then brought on Gordon and hired Gelbart to write and collaborate on the screenplay. At the time of production, this was the most expensive 2-hour television/cable movie ever made, with a budget of over $30 million. The movie was shot almost entirely on location in and around San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. The film concerns the filming of The Life of General Villa (which was shot in 1914) and is seen through the eyes of Frank N. Thayer, a studio boss's nephew who gets a career boost when he is placed in charge of the project. The resulting film became the first American feature- length movie, introducing scores of viewers to the true horrors of war that they had never personally seen. Thayer sold the studios on making the film despite their concerns that no one would sit through a movie longer than 1 hour, by convincing them that they could raise the price of movies to ten cents, doubling the going price at that time. The actual contract that Pancho Villa signed with Frank N. Thayer and the Mutual Film Company on January 5, 1914, to film the Battle of Ojinaga still exists and is in a museum in Mexico City. The original film has been lost, but some unedited film reels of the battle, showing Pancho Villa and his army fighting Federal forces, as well as photographs and publicity stills taken from the original film, still exist. Plot Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa (Antonio Banderas) finds himself without adequate funding to finance his war against the military-run government. He also finds himself at odds with the Americans because of the Hearst media empire's press campaign against him. To counter both of these threats, he sends emissaries to movie producers to convince them to pay to film his progress and the actual battles. Producer D.W. Griffith (Colm Feore) is immediately interested and convinces Mutual Film Studios boss Harry E. Aitkin to send a film crew. Aitkin's nephew Frank Thayer is initially a mere errand boy for the studio, but he makes a good impression with Villa, who demands that Thayer be placed in charge of the project. Thayer and a camera crew team film Villa leading his men to victory in battle. Despite the failure of this initial footage (which draws derisive laughter from potential backers) Thayer convinces Aitkin to invest even more money in a second attempt, and also convinces Villa to participate in making a more narrative film. Thayer returns to Mexico with a director, actors, producers, cameramen and screenwriters, and begin to film Villa's previous exploits using a younger actor, future film director Raoul Walsh (Kyle Chandler). The filming goes well, although Villa becomes angry that the screenwriters and the director have changed history to make a more dramatic film. However, he agrees to do a cameo appearance as an older version of himself. Meanwhile, Thayer begins a romance with actress Teddy Sampson (Alexa Davalos) whom he's had a crush on since they first met. One night Villa announces that they will attack a Federal held fort at Torreon and win the revolution. The film's director and his crew tell Villa that they are not coming with him to film the battle. Villa scares them into going to the battle by having a firing squad shoot over their heads. The next morning, Villa assembles his men to attack Torreon. Thayer and his team go in to film the action. After a skirmish on the way to the fort, Villa's army arrives at Torreon and lays siege to the fortress. Villa orders an attack and personally leads the charge. Villa's army is initially successful, but they suffer heavy casualties and are forced to withdraw. That night, Villa orders his army to bombard Torreon into submission, and, after a long, brutal bombardment, Villa's cavalry finishes off the last of Torreon's Federal defenders. However, Thayer and his camera crew team witness Villa personally shooting a Mexican widow in cold blood with his handgun during the aftermath of the battle. Disgusted, the team leaves. The Life of General Villa is shown in theaters in America, and to great success, although Thayer and his camera crew members regret making the film. Nine years later General Villa is driving his car with an associate and two of his bodyguards through Parral, Chihuahua. His car is flagged down by a Mexican civilian, when several Federals suddenly appear with machine guns. Villa reaches for his pistol, but is shot several times and is killed.

The original film's producer, D. W. Griffith, directed The Birth of a Nation in 1915, which featured Walsh as John Wilkes Booth. That same year, Walsh directed the first gangster movie, Regeneration, on location in the Lower East Side of New York City, and went on to direct approximately 138 movies, including such films as The Big Trail (1930) with John Wayne (Walsh discovered Wayne as a propman, renamed him, and cast him in the lead), Me and My Gal (1932) with Spencer Tracy, The Bowery with Wallace Beery and George Raft, The Roaring Twenties with James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart, High Sierra (1941) with Bogart, They Died with Their Boots On (1941) with Errol Flynn, White Heat (1949) with Cagney, and Band of Angels (1957) with Clark Gable and Sidney Poitier.

The company also operates stores under the name Hearty Platter, Tobacco Outlet Plus, and Kwik Trip/Kwik Star Express. Kwik Trip, Inc. is a privately held company headquartered in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Unlike many other convenience store chains, the company is vertically integrated across most of its product lines. It carries bag/pitcher milk and orange juice in pouches under the Nature's Touch brand via its in-house dairy. Kwik Trip also has an internal bakery operation which provides sliced and wrapped bread, doughnut and muffin products to its stores, along with a store brand snack line under the \\"Urge\\" branding. The company also maintains branding partnerships with several Upper Midwest professional sports teams, including Minnesota's Twins, Vikings, and Wild, along with the Green Bay Packers, Milwaukee Brewers, and Milwaukee Bucks (the latter featured as part of its chocolate milk line). All locations have small grocery sections selling basic fruits, bread, canned food, frozen food, sliced cheeses, and ice cream, along with traditional convenience store food such as bottled drinks and hot dogs. Notably, the chain has sold bananas, baking potatoes, and yellow onions for 39 cents per pound as a loss leader, along with fresh beef, hot dogs, bratwurst, and chicken. They also all have heated and ready-to-eat food, and will cook food to order off a small menu. In 2018, the company acquired the south-central Wisconsin chain PDQ, which offered fresh fried chicken in their stores; the PDQ recipe and chicken is currently being slowly rolled out to select stores. The next year, the chain began to offer home delivery of hot food in select markets through a partnership with EatStreet. Stores located off major highway exits operate as full service truck stops, with dual-pump fuel islands. Many of the truck stop locations also have overnight parking, showers, and full-service Denny's restaurants. Automatic car washes are also available at many stores, with some restrictions on availability and hours due to local noise and environmental ordinances.  History  alt=Kwik Trip was founded in 1965 by the Hansen and Zietlow families in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Over the next several years they added new locations surrounding Eau Claire. In 1973, they built a distribution center and moved the headquarters to La Crosse. In 1993, they opened their first location in Iowa under the name Kwik Star. In 2000, the Zietlow family became the sole owner of Kwik Trip, Inc. By 2016, the chain had over 500 stores, all privately owned. In 2017, they acquired the chain PDQ, and in 2020 they acquired Stop–N–Go. Store operations Kwik Trip stores employ a mixture of full-time and part-time employees. In addition to a store leader, each store employs an assistant store leader and about 3-5 guest service leaders. These employees are responsible for overseeing store operations while the store leader is out of the store. Additionally, each store has a food service leader and assistant food service leader responsible for overseeing the individual store's hot food program, ensuring that appropriate amounts of food are made and sold and the program continues to grow according to company expectations. District leaders supervise multiple stores in a given region, and zone leaders supervise multiple districts. Workplace honors Kwik Trip sign at Mauston, Wisconsin In 2011, Kwik Trip was named by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel as the number one large workplace (over 500 employees) for workers in Southeastern Wisconsin.

Sources  Brief accounts of Ishoʿyahb's patriarchate are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (thirteenth- century), and the ecclesiastical histories of the Church of the East writers Mari (twelfth-century), ʿAmr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth- century). There are also the works he penned himself. Early career Ishoʿyahb was the son of a wealthy Persian Christian named Bastomagh, of Kuphlana in Adiabene, who was a frequent visitor to the monastery of Beth ʿAbe. He was educated at the School of Nisibis, became bishop of Nineveh, and was afterwards appointed metropolitan of Adiabene. As metropolitan of Adiabene he hindered the Jacobites from building a church in Mosul, despite the fact that they were supported by all the weight and influence of the Tagritians from Tikrit. Bar Hebraeus declares that he bribed right and left to effect this. He was one of the members of the delegation of the Church of the East which met the Roman emperor Heraclius in Aleppo in 630, and took away a very costly and beautiful casket, containing relics of the apostles, from a church at Antioch. Many argue the casket was stolen similar to how relics were often stolen during the Crusades. He donated the casket to the monastery of Beth ʿAbe.  Ishoyahb's patriarchate  On Maremmeh's death in 647, the Church of the East in what is now Iraq elevated Ishoʿyahb to the Catholicate. However Metropolitan Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir did not recognise this. Ishoʿyahb maintained good relations with the Arabs - whom he called variously Tayy, Muhajirs, and Hanifs - but never did heal the schism in his own Church. Ishoʿyahb died in 659. Works Ishoʿyahb wrote a Refutation Of Opinions on behalf of John, Metropolitan of Beth Lapat, several other tracts and sermons, some hymns, a vita of the martyr Isho-sabhran, and an exhortation to novices. He is also known for making substantial improvements to the liturgy of the Church for the daily office and for various sacraments. The Chronicle of Seert, Pt.1.1, pg.85 (295), also credits him with choosing the three eucharistic anaphoras that are currently in use in the Assyrian Church of the East. Ishoʿyahb is chiefly studied today for his letters during his catholicate; because these open a glimpse into a critical time in history of the Church of the East, and also witness to their relations with the Arabs under the caliphates of ʿUthman and ʿAli (although the Arab leaders are not named). *The heretics are deceiving you [when they say] there happens what happens by order of the Arabs, which is certainly not the case. For the tayyaye mhaggre (Muhajir Arabs) do not aid those who say that God, Lord of all, suffered and died. And if by chance they do help them for whatever reason, you can inform the mhaggre (Mujahirs) and persuade them of this matter as it should be, if you care about it at all. So perform all things wisely, my brothers; give unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's., 179. Quoting Ep. 48B, 97. In a letter addressed to the schismatic Shemʿon: *You alone of all the peoples of the earth have become estranged from every one of them. And because of this estrangement from all these, the influence of the present error came to prevail with ease among you. For the one who has seduced you and uprooted your churches was first seen among us in the region of Radhan, where the pagans are more numerous than the Christians. Yet, due to the praiseworthy conduct of the Christians, the pagans were not led astray by him. Rather he was driven out from there in disgrace; not only did he not uproot the churches, but he himself was extirpated. However, your region of Fars received him, pagans and Christians, and he did with them as he willed, the pagans consenting and obedient, the Christians inactive and silent. As for the Arabs, to whom God has at this time given rule (shultana) over the world, you know well how they act towards us. Not only do they not oppose Christianity, but they praise our faith, honour the priests and saints of our Lord, and give aid to the churches and monasteries. Why then do your Mazonaye [Omanis] reject their faith on a pretext of theirs? And this when the Mazonaye themselves admit that the Arabs have not compelled them to abandon their faith, but only asked them to give up half of their possessions in order to keep their faith. Yet they forsook their faith, which is forever, and retained the half of their wealth, which is for a short time.Hoyland, 181-2 quoting Ep. 14C, 51 Notes See also * Adiabene (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province) * East Syriac Rite * List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East References * Abbeloos, J.

Ormond was the official captain of the Tipperary team in 2008, however, when Ormond or any other Loughmore player failed to secure a regular starting place, Eoin Kelly fulfilled the role of captain. Early life Paul Ormond was born just outside Templemore, County Tipperary in 1977. He was educated locally and later attended Our Lady's Secondary School in Templemore. Here Ormond's hurling skills came to the fore and he won an All-Ireland 'B' Colleges' medal. Playing career =Club= Ormond plays his club hurling with his local Loughmore-Castleiney club in Tipperary and has enjoyed some success. His first major success was a county under-21 'B' medal in 1994. In 2007 Ormond won a senior county title with the club. This was later converted into a Munster club title. =Inter-county= Ormond first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a dual player at minor level. He won a Munster minor title with the Tipperary Gaelic football team in 1995. He later played with the under-21 hurling and football teams, however, he enjoyed little success. In 1998 Ormond was a substitute on both the Tipperary senior football and hurling teams, however, there was no provincial success. In 1999 he made his senior championship debut in the game against Clare. Tipperary lost on that occasion, however, two years later in 2001 Ormond had his first major success when he collected a National Hurling League medal. Later that same year Tipperary defeated Limerick in the provincial final, giving Ormond his first Munster medal. His team later reached the All-Ireland final where old rivals Galway provided the opposition. Tipp won the day again giving Ormond an All-Ireland medal. Since then Tipperary's hurling fortunes have taken a downturn. The team made a number of appearances in the latter stages of the All-Ireland series, however, a return to the big stage remained elusive. Tipp captured another National League title in 2008, however, Ormond, in spite of being the official team captain, did not play any part in the final victory.

Time geography was originally developed by human geographers, but today it is applied in multiple fields related to transportation, regional planning, geography, anthropology, time-use research, ecology, environmental science, and public health. According to Swedish geographer Bo Lenntorp: \\"It is a basic approach, and every researcher can connect it to theoretical considerations in her or his own way.\\" Origins of time geography The Swedish geographer Torsten Hägerstrand created time geography in the mid-1960s based on ideas he had developed during his earlier empirical research on human migration patterns in Sweden. He sought \\"some way of finding out the workings of large socio-environmental mechanisms\\" using \\"a physical approach involving the study of how events occur in a time-space framework\\". Hägerstrand was inspired in part by conceptual advances in spacetime physics and by the philosophy of physicalism.In and , Hägerstrand cites the writings of Albert Einstein and Arthur Eddington on general relativity as inspirations. Physicalist philosopher and sociologist Otto Neurath is cited in . While these ideas are important sources for time-geographic ontology, time geography should not be portrayed as exclusively physicalist. Hägerstrand also cited phenomenologist Martin Heidegger and conservationist Rachel Carson as major influences, along with numerous geographers (). \\"Hägerstrand wanted to stress the importance of the material aspects of the real world as the basis of life, with an imperative for researchers to take basic constraints into consideration: that natural resources, time, and space are limited... Nevertheless, Torsten Hägerstrand was not a hardcore materialist. His materialism is embedded in a deep concern for the importance of human experiences, reflections, and reasoning for the development of geographical knowledge.\\" () Hägerstrand's earliest formulation of time geography informally described its key ontological features: \\"In time-space the individual describes a path\\" within a situational context; \\"life paths become captured within a net of constraints, some of which are imposed by physiological and physical necessities and some imposed by private and common decisions\\". \\"It would be impossible to offer a comprehensive taxonomy of constraints seen as time-space phenomena\\", Hägerstrand said, but he \\"tentatively described\\" three important classes of constraints: *capability constraints — limitations on the activity of individuals because of their biological structure and/or the tools they can command, *coupling constraints — limitations that \\"define where, when, and for how long, the individual has to join other individuals, tools, and materials in order to produce, consume, and transact\\" (closely related to critical path analysis), and *authority constraints — limitations on the domain or \\"time- space entity within which things and events are under the control of a given individual or a given group\\". Examples of the visual language of time geography: space-time cube, path, prism, bundle, and other concepts. Hägerstrand illustrated these concepts with novel forms of graphical notation (inspired in part by musical notation),; ; such as: *the space-time aquarium (or space-time cube), which displays individual paths in axonometric graphical projection of space and time coordinates; *the space-time prism, which shows individuals' possible behavior in time-space given their capability constraints and coupling constraints; *bundles of paths, which are the conjunction of individual paths due in part to their capability constraints and coupling constraints, and which help to create \\"pockets of local order\\"; *concentric tubes or rings of accessibility, which indicate certain capability constraints of a given individual, such as limited spatial size and limited manual, oral-auditive and visual range; and *nested hierarchies of domains, which show the authority constraints for a given individual or a given group.; While this innovative visual language is an essential feature of time geography, Hägerstrand's colleague Bo Lenntorp emphasized that it is the product of an underlying ontology, and \\"not the other way around. The notation system is a very useful tool, but it is a rather poor reflection of a rich world-view. In many cases, the notational apparatus has been the hallmark of time geography. However, the underlying ontology is the most important feature.\\" Time geography is not only about time-geographic diagrams, just as music is not only about musical notation. Hägerstrand later explained: \\"What is briefly alluded to here is a 4-dimensional world of forms. This cannot be completely graphically depicted. On the other hand one ought to be able to imagine it with sufficient clarity for it to be of guidance in empirical and theoretical research.\\" By 1981, geographers Nigel Thrift and Allan Pred were already defending time geography against those who would see it \\"merely as a rigid descriptive model of spatial and temporal organization which lends itself to accessibility constraint analysis (and related exercises in social engineering).\\" They argued that time geography is not just a model of constraints; it is a flexible and evolving way of thinking about reality that can complement a wide variety of theories and research methods. In the decades since then, Hägerstrand and others have made efforts to expand his original set of concepts.For a more extensive list of Hägerstrand's publications, see Torsten Hägerstrand By the end of his life, Hägerstrand had ceased using the phrase \\"time geography\\" to refer to this way of thinking and instead used words like topoecology.; Later developments in time geography Schematic and example of a space-time prism using transit network data: On the right is a schematic diagram of a space-time prism, and on the left is a map of the potential path area for two different time budgets. Since the 1980s, time geography has been used by researchers in the social sciences,For example: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; the biological sciences,For example: ; ; ; ; ; and in interdisciplinary fields. In 1993, British geographer Gillian Rose noted that \\"time-geography shares the feminist interest in the quotidian paths traced by people, and again like feminism, links such paths, by thinking about constraints, to the larger structures of society.\\" However, she noted that time geography had not been applied to issues important to feminists, and she called it a form of \\"social science masculinity\\". Over the following decades, feminist geographers have revisited time geography and have begun to use it as a tool to address feminist issues.For example: ; ; ; GIS software has been developed to compute and analyze time-geographic problems at a variety of spatial scales. Such analyses have used different types of network datasets (such as walking networks, highway networks, and public transit schedules) as well as a variety of visualization strategies.For example: ; ; Specialized software such as GeoTime has been developed to facilitate time-geographic visualization and visual analytics. Time geography has also been used as a form of therapeutic assessment in mental health.; ; Benjamin Bach and colleagues have generalized the space-time cube into a framework for temporal data visualization that applies to all data that can be represented in two dimensions plus time.; See also * Agent based modeling  GIS and public health * Historical ecology * Historical geographic information system * Material flow analysis * MuSIASEM * Sankey diagram * Spatiotemporal database * Time–distance diagram Footnotes References                    Further reading                * Historical geography Visualization (graphic) ","title":"Time geography"},{"id":"5787429","text":"Anti-Social Music (ASM) is a composer/performer collective founded in New York City in 2001.

Fox, Shemar Moore, Golden Brooks, Sean Blakemore and Keshia Knight Pulliam. The sequel, Motives 2, was released in 2007 (direct-to-video).  Plot  Emery Simms (Shemar Moore) is a highly educated business tycoon whose life takes a turn for the worse when he engages in an adulterous fling with the wildly free-spirited and exotic Allanah James (Golden Brooks). Emery accidentally kills a man who tries to get information out of him, which is then witnessed by another man who flees. Emery does not notice the dead man's cell phone, which has all their calls logged in. He then makes a phone call to his friend who does not answer. Later, he meets Allanah whose car has broken down. He gives her a ride to her job unaware she is working an angle to get what she wants. He then calls her and insists they have dinner. They do, but the police follow them, seeing them make out as does another man that is following Allanah. The crazed man comes to the restaurant and attacks Emery. Emery goes to see Allanah and sees that the place she lives in is unsatisfactory, so he takes her to one of his properties - a condo. She makes herself at home and even invites a friend over, who tells her that she can keep the condo and lifestyle if there \\"is a hole in the condom\\". Emery drops by for sex and she has her friend wait outside so she can do what she needs to with Emery. Allanah's friend ends up joining them. Emery then visits his friend Brandon Collier (Sean Blakemore), gives him a box cutter and tells him to help him unpack. The two reminisce about the fun times they had in college. Allanah meets Emery in a park where children are playing and announces she is pregnant. Shocked, Emery tells her to abort the baby, but Allanah tells him no. She then sets up a meeting with Connie (Vivica A. Fox), Emery's wife, sending her a romantic note, which Connie thinks is from Emery. When Connie arrives at a park where the meeting is to take place she finds a beautifully dressed table with flowers and a bottled of chilled wine waiting. Allanah then appears and the two women sit down for a chat. Allanah tells Connie she is pregnant with Emery's child and asks her for money. Connie gives her a check for $100,000 then returns home to pack her bags to leave Emery. When Emery walks in the two get into an argument over Allanah, her pregnancy and the pay off. In the meantime, Allanah returns to the condo where her husband, Derrick Woods (Joe Torry), shows up demanding money. Emery soon follows to confront her about the meeting with Connie, and finds Allanah and Derrick having sex. He tells them both to leave and demands that Allanah give back the check. Derrick goes ballistic on Allanah upon finding out what she did, as Emery searches her purse for the check. Emery hurls an insult at Derrick and the two fight. In the struggle, Emery drops the check, Allanah picks it up then flees the condo very much alive. Allanah soon turns up dead, her throat cut. Emery is asked to come to the police station and is interrogated by Detective Morgan (Mel Jackson) about her murder. Emery insists that when he left the condo Allanah was alive, just as Derrick insists the same in his interrogation. They are both released upon investigation of the murder. Connie returns to Emery, but still doesn't trust him. While she is home, Emery goes in search of pictures taken of him having sex with Allanah in his car, but cannot find them. The movie fast forwards to an event for wayward youth, where Connie is giving a speech. During the speech, Emery is arrested for Allanah's murder. Before this happened, he goes to see Brandon who tells him that he wants Connie and his life. The two fight, Emery stops, leaving Brandon alive. After Emery is sentenced and sent to prison, Connie visits him and presents him with divorce papers, forcing him to sign them. Reluctantly, he does. Connie then gets up and walks away as Emery screams for her to come back. As Emery is being led back to his cell, he sees Connie walks to Brandon. She looks back at him as the two embrace and with a smug look Brandon stares intently at Emery. In Emery's flashback, the viewer sees and reveals that it was Brandon who set him and Allanah up, murdered her, and sent a box of evidence to Detectives Pierce (Victoria Rowell) and Morgan all in an attempt to get Connie all to himself. Emery, in a fit of rage, then attempts to attack Brandon yelling \\"You did this to me!\\", but security guards hold him back. Yelling to Connie that it was Brandon who was the cause of everything, Connie walks out the door. Brandon winks at Emery and leaves as he's being dragged back to his cell, still yelling for Connie to return. The film ends with credits revealing that Emery is currently awaiting for an appeal for the murders of Allanah James and Kenneth Stroud.  Cast  * Vivica A.

When introduced into service, these ships were the most powerful destroyers in the world. They served as first-line destroyers through the 1930s, and remained formidable weapons systems well into the Pacific War. History Construction of the advanced Fubuki-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion program from fiscal 1923, intended to give Japan a qualitative edge with the world's most modern ships.Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare p.1040 The Fubuki class had performance that was a quantum leap over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated . The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many light cruisers in other navies.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun page 221-222. Akebono, built at the Fujinagata Shipyards in Osaka was the seventh in an improved series, which incorporated a modified gun turret which could elevate her main battery of Type 3 127 mm 50 caliber naval guns to 75° as opposed to the original 40°, thus permitting the guns to be used as dual purpose guns against aircraft.F Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare (London: Phoebus, 1977), Volume 10, p.1040. Akebono was laid down on 25 October 1929, launched on 7 November 1930 and commissioned on 31 July 1931. Originally assigned hull designation \\"Destroyer No. 52\\", she was named Akebono before her launch. Operational history On completion, Akebono was assigned to Destroyer Division 7 under the IJN 2nd Fleet. During the Second Sino- Japanese War, from 1937, Ayanami covered landing of Japanese forces in Shanghai and Hangzhou. From 1940, she was assigned to patrol and cover landings of Japanese forces in south China and participated in the Invasion of French Indochina. =World War II history= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Akebono was assigned to Destroyer Division 7 of the IJN 1st Air Fleet, but was unable to participate in the attack due to a damaged propeller, and was held in reserve in Japanese home waters as a guard vessel. Repairs completed by mid-January 1942, Akebono was part of the escort for the aircraft carriers and during air strikes against Ambon. She was later part of the escort for the cruisers and during \\"Operation J\\" (the Japanese invasion of the eastern Netherlands East Indies). On 1 March, at the Battle of the Java Sea, Akebono assisted in sinking the British cruiser and destroyer , and the American destroyer .Brown. Warship Losses of World War II She returned to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for repairs at the end of March. At the end of April, Akebono escorted and Haguro to Truk, and subsequently joined Admiral Takeo Takagi's force at the Battle of the Coral Sea.Morison. Coral Sea, Midway and Submarine Actions, May 1942 – August 1942. At the end of May, she escorted from Truk back to Kure Naval Arsenal. During the Battle of Midway in early June, Akebono was part the diversionary force in \\"Operation AL\\" that attacked Dutch Harbor, Alaska in the Aleutians campaign, and returned to Yokosuka in early July. On 14 July, Akebono was reassigned to the Combined Fleet, and escorted the battleship Yamato and aircraft carrier at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August. Akebono remained assigned to Taiyō through September, and to the aircraft carrier from October to February 1943. Through the rest of 1943, Akebono continued to serve as an escort for Unyō, Taiyō, , or in various missions throughout the Pacific, except for a period in December when she was assigned to \\"Tokyo Express\\" transport missions in the Solomon Islands. On 1 January 1944, Akebono was reassigned to the IJN 5th Fleet. On 14 January, she rescued 89 survivors of torpedoed destroyer en route to Truk. Returning to Yokosuka for repairs and refit on 25 January, she was reassigned to Ōminato Guard District for patrols of northern waters through October. However, as the situation continued to deteriorate for Japan in the Philippines, she was reassigned to Admiral Kiyohide Shima's Diversionary Force at the Battle of Surigao Strait on 24 October. The following day, Akebono rescued about 700 survivors of the heavy cruiser and then scuttled her with a torpedo.Morison. Leyte, June 1944 – January 1945, On 13 November 1944, Akebono, while alongside destroyer at Cavite pier near Manila, was attacked in a USAAF air raid.

Set in 4038, Satterfield plays Steve Armstrong, the first human in 50 years to compete in the intergalactic boxing sport called simply \\"The Arena\\". The film was produced by Irwin Yablans and features original music by Richard Band. Plot Steve Armstrong (Paul Satterfield) is working as a short order cook on a space station somewhere in the galaxy. Overwhelmed by the volume of orders, he repeatedly fouls up and soon finds himself in a confrontation with an alien patron named Vang. After a fight which smashes up the diner and leaves the alien injured, Steve and his friend and co-worker Shorty (Hamilton Camp) are fired. As it turns out, Vang is an Arena fighter, and his manager Quinn (Claudia Christian) confronts Steve. Amazed that a human could beat one of her best fighters, Quinn offers him a contract, but convinced that humans no longer have a place in the Arena, Steve refuses, intending to make his way back to Earth. Lacking sufficient money for a ticket, Shorty attempts to raise the cash by gambling in an underground casino. The game is raided by the authorities and in the confusion, Shorty pockets the money. Caught in the act by crime boss Rogor (Marc Alaimo) and his enforcer Weezil (Armin Shimerman), Shorty is held for ransom. Steve promises to pay off the debt, so he reluctantly returns to Quinn and agrees to a contract. Remarkably he wins his first match with an alien named Sloth in an upset. He continues fighting, determined to prove that a human has what it takes to be champion, and soon becomes a top contender. Despite Rogor's multiple attempts to cheat, Steve ultimately wins the championship from Rogor's top fighter, an alien named Horn (Michael Deak).

He was also the founder of Cumberland College in Princeton, Kentucky, in 1825, which was eventually moved to Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1843, to become Cumberland University. The name Franceway Ranna was a frontier corruption of François-René. Early life = Education = He was born at Claremont, New Hampshire on April 24, 1790. His family were Episcopalians. His maternal grandfather and an uncle were in succession pastors of the Episcopalian congregation at Claremont. His great uncle, Rev. Ranna Cossitt, was a Loyalist who became the first Anglican minister in Sydney, Nova Scotia. At the age of fourteen Mr. Cossitt commenced his preparation for college, and entered Middlebury College, in Vermont. In 1813 he graduated. His standing was high in a large class. After leaving college he spent two years in teaching, at Morristown, New Jersey. It was customary, in those days, for men, after having completed their collegiate studies, to spend some time in teaching before entering upon the study of those things relating more immediately to their chosen profession. From Morristown he went to North Carolina, and took charge of Vine Hill Academy, on Roanoke River. From North Carolina he returned to New England deeply impressed with the necessity of personal religion. Mr. Cossitt's original purpose was to engage in the legal profession, but with his spiritual change came a change of purpose. He resolved to devote himself to the Christian ministry. He studied theology at New Haven, in what has since become the General Episcopal Seminary of New York—the institution having been removed. Bishop Brownell, of Connecticut, gave him license as a \\"lay reader\\" in the Episcopal Church. =Teaching and ministry= He then directed his course to Tennessee, and established a school at a little place on Cumberland River, called in its day New York, a few miles below Clarksville. A number of his Carolina friends had moved and settled there. They were wealthy, and desired to educate their children. With a view to this object, they urged his settlement among them. In addition, the opening and improving condition of the country presented a fine prospect to men engaged in the work of education. His school became in process of time, amongst other things, a sort of theological seminary. A number of young men preparing for the ministry resorted thither for the purpose of receiving instruction. In the fall of 1821 he came to a camp-meeting held on Wells's Creek, in Stewart county. He was accompanied to the meeting by William Clements, an educated gentleman and an elder in the Church, who had previously become acquainted with him. An introduction by such a man as Mr. Clements was a recommendation. They arrived at the meeting on Saturday. The ministers in attendance included Thomas Calhoun, Robert Baker, and Robert S. Donnell. Mr. Cossitt preached on Saturday evening, although still an Episcopalian. His text was, \\"If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.\\" The sermon was an argument in support of the truth of the Christian Scriptures. This was his introduction to Cumberland Presbyterians. Mr. Calhoon was the manager of the meeting, and treated him with great attention and respect. In 1822 he was set apart to the whole work of the ministry in the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, and became a member of the Anderson Presbytery. On the 19th of February, of the same year, he was married to Miss Lucinda Blair, of Montgomery County. Her father was a prominent member of the Church. Mr. Cossitt was now fairly identified with the Cumberland Presbyterians. Shortly after his marriage he issued a prospectus with a view to the publication of a paper, which he proposed to call the Western Star. For some reason the publication was never commenced. After spending two or three years at New York, he moved to Elkton, Kentucky, and established a school there. His associations at Elkton were unusually pleasant. He always spoke of them with interest. Cumberland College = Establishment = At the sessions of the Cumberland Synod at Princeton, in 1825, the plan of Cumberland College was projected, and commissioners were appointed to examine particular points, and make the location. Another set of commissioners was appointed to procure a charter for the proposed Institution from the Legislature of Kentucky. It was to have been called the Cumberland Presbyterian College. The gentlemen who visited the Legislature for the purpose of procuring a charter, were advised to drop the \\"Presbyterian\\" from the proposed name, as it might arouse sectarian opposition among the members and their friends, and thus cause the application to be rejected. Accordingly, the application was made for a charter of Cumberland College. The change was displeasing to some leading members of the Church, and was perhaps the first step in producing a series of embarrassments which in process of time became very numerous and great—so much that in a few years the existence of the Institution was placed in jeopardy. Princeton and Elkton were rivals in their efforts for the location. The Institution was located in the vicinity of Princeton; a farm was bought about a mile from the town. It was to be a manual labor school, and arrangements were made accordingly. Mt. Cossitt was chosen President, and opened the College for the reception of students in March, 1826. Cumberland College was an experiment. The country was comparatively new. The Cumberland Presbyterian Church had been chiefly devoted to the more immediate work of saving sinners, and collecting congregations. The itinerant plan of preaching, and yearly camp-meetings, constituted a large part of their machinery. The establishment of denominational schools and of colleges had been overlooked. The lessons necessary to conducting such enterprises with success had to be learned from experience. A practical man would have expected blunders and a probable failure. Again, the plan of the Institution was a novelty. It was a generous conception. Almost any reasoner would have decided that it was suitable to the wants and genius of a plain, practical people. It looked to the education of young men, and especially of young men preparing for the ministry, who had not the means of supporting themselves at more expensive institutions of learning. Rugged young men, who had been first trained at the plow, and who had vigor of body, were to be converted into scholars, and statesmen, and pulpit orators. The students were to occupy dormitories provided for them, to use straw-beds, and furniture of the plainest and cheapest king, and to board at a common boarding-house. The fare was to be healthful, but plain and cheap. All luxuries were proscribed. The students were to work two hours each day except the Sabbath, and to pay sixty dollars a year into the College treasury. Upon the opening of the College, Mr. Cossitt collected around him some of the best young men in the land. A large log-building was constructed for College purposes, and the students who were educated there during ten of the first years of the Institution \\"rubbed their backs against wooden walls.\\" Notwithstanding what would now be considered the grimness and severity of the system, the number of the students was large. In the spring and summer of 1830 it reached one hundred and twenty-five. =Financial difficulties= At the meeting of the General Assembly in 1830 it was thought necessary to raise the charges in money from sixty to eighty dollars. Experience had shown that the expenditures of the establishment were greater than its friends had anticipated. The circumstance operated unfavorably, of course, upon the patronage of the Institution; still its patronage was respectable. Pecuniary difficulties, however, rather increased than diminished. Money had been borrowed to pay for the farm, and other debts had been contracted, and the interest was an eating cancer. In 1831 the General Assembly leased the College to Rev. John Barnett and Rev. Aaron Shelby for a term of years. The pecuniary difficulties of the Institution had become very great. The Church had become in some degree alienated; confidence in the final success of the enterprise was failing. Messrs. Barnett and Shelby were to have all the proceeds of the College after paying the necessary expenditures—to support a sufficient number of instructors, to keep up the boarding-house, and pay the debts of the College. They were considered men of great energy and perseverance, of respectable financial ability, and devoted friends of the Church. Mr. Shelby continued his connection with the Institution till the summer or fall of 1833, when he sold his interest to Mr. Harvey Young. In the summer of 1834 Mr. Young died, and the entire management of the financial affairs of the College fell into the hands of Mr. Barnett. In the summer of 1834 the cholera visited the town. A number of persons fell victims to the terrible disease. The College, however, did not disband. But the cholera was followed by a malignant fever, which extended to the College community, and spread over the country. The condition of things became so bad at the College, that a temporary suspension of operations was found absolutely necessary. The manager of the farm and boarding-house died; one of the professors was finally prostrated, one of the students died, and a number in addition were sick. It was a terrible blow upon the Institution. It rallied, however, and the fall session commenced with favorable prospects. Still there were financial troubles. The Church, too, began to complain of Mr. Barnett. Some thought he managed badly; others thought he managed wholly with a view to his own selfish ends; others went so far as to impeach his integrity as a man of business and a Christian. A change became necessary. Accordingly, at the General Assembly in 1837, which met at Princeton, Cumberland College Association was formed. Mr. Barnett's interest was transferred to the Association. It was a joint-stock company. It was pledged to carry on the operations of the Institution under the direction and control of the General Assembly. A number of the most respectable and wealthy citizens of Princeton and the neighborhood entered into the Association. Prospects seemed to brighten, and hope was restored once more. The Association entered upon their with vigor and energy. Still, after a temporary revival of interest and confidence, another cloud arose. An impression was made upon the minds of those in the neighborhood of the College that the Church had deserted it, and that neither contributions nor patronage were to be expected from that quarter. It was believed that busy persons, with selfish designs, contributed to that impression. The subject of transferring the Institution to the control of the Episcopalians of Kentucky was seriously considered. How far Episcopalians of Kentucky may have been answerable themselves for the state of feeling which existed, the writer has no means of knowing, but some of Dr. Cossitt's friends thought that they were not inactive. It was natural enough that they should have felt an interest in a measure which would have contributed greatly to their success and establishment in Lower Kentucky. The result of this condition of things was a great effort on the part of Dr. Cossitt to arouse the Church once more to an interest in behalf of the College. He and Rev. F. C. Usher, who was connected with him in the department of instruction, published a circular letter, in which earnest appeals were made to the ministers and members of the Church. These efforts were continued to the meeting of the General Assembly, which occurred in May following, Its sessions were held at Elkton, Kentucky. When the Assembly met, it appeared that the Church had been fully awakened to the importance and danger of the crisis. A magnificent scheme was formed. If it had been carried into effective operation, it would have relieved the College from debt, and rendered it permanent, if not prosperous. It was proposed to raise one hundred thousand dollars for educational purposes. Fifty-five thousand dollars of that sum was to serve as a perpetual endowment of Cumberland College; thirty thousand was to be used in Pennsylvania, in the endowment of a college there; and the remaining fifteen thousand dollars was to constitute a sort of floating capital, to be used as circumstances might suggest. Several of the most popular young men in the Church were engaged as agents; the people were not illiberal in their subscriptions, and every thing seemed to promise well. Dr. Cossitt confidently believed that the College would be endowed, and that the most liberal provision would be made for the education of candidates for the ministry. This last was always a controlling thought with him, as it has been with all the earnest educators in our Church. This thought originated the impulse which led to the establishment of Cumberland College at first, and afterward to the establishment of Cumberland University. At the General Assembly of 1841 things seemed to be going forward smoothly. The friends of the College were still hopeful, and even buoyant. It was announced at the General Assembly of 1842, that Cumberland College was still hopelessly in debt, that its property was under execution, and liable to be placed under the sheriff's hammer any day. The troubles of Cumberland College threw a shadow over Dr. Cossitt's path which continued to his dying day. The happiest hours of his life were those in which he was struggling—often against fearful odds—for the prosperity, or to maintain the existence, of the Institution. It was the enterprise through which he expected his name to be handed down to posterity, if it should reach posterity at all. He felt that his work in the College was the great work of his life. When the condition of the College became known to the Assembly, the revulsion of feeling and the disappointment were so great that steps were immediately taken toward the removal of the Institution. A commission of gentlemen, all prominent members of the Church, was appointed to consider the matter, and take some action upon it. The commission met in Nashville, on the first day of the following July, 1842, and determined to establish Cumberland College at Lebanon, Tennessee. Dr. Cossitt was elected to the presidency of the new College, and accepted the appointment, and of course the Commencement of the College at Princeton, in 1842, terminated his connection with that Institution. The friends of the old Institution, however, rallied, sold its useless property, paid its debts, and continued its operations with respectable success for a number of years. Later life In 1829 Mr. Cossitt made an excursion through some of the Middle and Southern States. He spent some time in Washington City, and while there published and circulated a pamphlet, setting forth the character and claims of the College. He preached in several of the churches of the city, and received some donations. He preached also in Baltimore and Philadelphia, receiving very respectful attention in both cities. He brought one young man from Baltimore, and two or three from Eastern Virginia, to the Institution. Two of these young men remained until they graduated. They became useful and honored men. Early in 1830 the leading men connected with the College commenced the publication of the Religious and Literary Intelligencer, at Princeton. It was the first periodical of the Church. Mr. Cossitt was identified with it for a few months, and a principal contributor to its columns. The Assembly of 1830, however, transferred the editorial control of the paper to Rev. David Lowry. It afterward became the Revivalist, and finally the Cumberland Presbyterian, in Nashville. In 1833 Mr. Cossitt lost his wife and the mother of his children. On the 19th of January, 1834, he was married a second time, to Miss Matilda Edwards, of Elkton, Kentucky. In 1839 he received the Doctorate of Divinity from Middlebury College, and also from the Trustees of Cumberland College, with which he was then connected. In March, 1840, he commenced the publication of the Banner of Peace. It was at first a monthly periodical. He continued it a year under this form. In December 1841 the publication was renewed. It was changed, however, from a monthly to a small weekly. Early in the year 1843 Dr. Cossitt moved to Lebanon, and took charge of Cumberland College at that place. In a short time the Institution became what is now Cumberland University. He continued in the presidency of the College till the fall of 1844, when he resigned, and was succeeded by Rev. T. C. Anderson. He now gave himself up to the management of his paper, enlarging, and otherwise improving it, as he was able. He continued the publication of the Banner of Peace to the close of 1849. His editorial valedictory is contained in the number of the 24th December, 1849. The paper was transferred to Rev. W. D. Chadick and Mr. W. L. Berry. Mr. Chadick assumed control of the editorial department. In 1853 Dr. Cossitt published his Life and Times of Finis Ewing. In the same year he was elected by the Trustees Professor of Systematic Theology in Cumberland University. This appointment he declined, on account of his age and increasing infirmities. The last decade of his life he devoted to the management of his own domestic concerns. In addition to the wife of his youth, he had buried a daughter at Princeton. Two others, both young wives, and one of them a young mother, had been taken from him after he came to Lebanon. He had committed to the grave also in Lebanon, an only son and a son-in-law. In the quietude of his own home he found time and opportunity for rest, for intellectual refreshment, for meditation and prayer. A few weeks before his death he became unusually ill. On the morning of the third of February, 1863, between four and five o'clock, he sunk into the arms of death.

Plot The plot revolves around a series of murders that take place over two years in the Nevada Desert near Groom Lake. The movie opens with a woman being chased through the desert by an unseen creature, but then she wakes up revealing it to be a nightmare. Traci and her boyfriend Gibson are driving across the desert at night. Gibson keeps talking about Area 51, but Traci is only interested in reaching Las Vegas. In order to get Gibson to shut up and keep driving, Traci takes her top off and straddles his lap. Because of her distraction he runs over something, blowing out a tire. Gibson stops to change the tire, but immediately vanishes when he gets out of the car. Traci searches for him, but only finds a bloody tire iron. She runs back to the car, lights a cigarette and drives away. However, she soon has an accident and is trapped by the seatbelt. The monster picks up her cigarette outside the car and ignites the gasoline leaking from the car, setting it and Traci on fire. Several people are attacked at a small carnival, by an alien. This draws the attention of Dr. Cleo Browning (Phoebe Falconer). Dr. Browning discusses killing the creature with Sheriff Sam Cash (Sean Galuszka), but she is overheard by animal rights activist Roxanne, and her boyfriend Albert. Roxanne thinks that if they capture the alien they can expose to the world what the government is doing to animals. In the meantime, three of the carnival workers set out to capture the alien and add it to the sideshow. Cash and Dr. Browning meet with Cletus (Matthew Christopher). He speculates that the alien is living in a cave in the mountains. While the two are meeting with Cletus, Roxanne attempts to slash the sheriff's tires, sending Albert to act as a lookout. Unable to cut the tires, she looks for Albert, but is unable to find him. Eventually, when she discovers his body, she screams and starts to run, but she also killed by the alien. The next day, Dr. Browning and Cash search for the alien. They find its \\"home\\" in a small tunnel. Cash lowers Dr. Browning into the tunnel by rope. Browning finds the alien's child and sends it back up to Cash. The three carnival workers sneak up and hold a gun to Cash's head, demanding the alien child. He gives it to them and they throw him into the tunnel. Cash and Browning escape and return to the carnival. They interrupt the sideshow and take the alien child back. They attempt to drive away but one of the workers shoots out one of their tires. The carnies then lure Dr. Browning near the \\"Mother\\" alien, who had just arrived. She is attacked by the alien but is able to fight back. One of the carnies, fighting with Cash, shoot him. Dr. Browning, stabs the alien while fighting it and the creature collapses. As the doctor is walking away a woman carney asks if the alien is dead and she says it is. As the carney bends over the alien it leaps up and kills her.

Club career Förster started playing professionally at SV Waldhof Mannheim, in the second division. In January 1975, he switched to country giants FC Bayern Munich, but his stay there was highly unsuccessful (he did appear twice in the club's 1975–76 European Cup victorious campaign).

Until his retirement, Förster scored 25 goals in 291 overall top-division league matches, being instrumental in Stuttgart's 1984 national league (31 matches, two goals). He retired in 1986, at only 30. International career Förster won his first cap for West Germany on 22 May 1979, in a 3–1 friendly win in Republic of Ireland.

The character is the third to use the name White Tiger. He has also adopted the moniker of the Black Panther. The character was created by Christopher Priest and Dan Fraga and introduced in Black Panther (vol. 3) #50. Publication history With sales numbers declining on the third volume of Black Panther, the decision was made to retool the series. The original character - T'Challa T'Chaka, the king of Wakanda - would be replaced with a new character impersonating the Black Panther, starting with issue #50. According to writer Christopher Priest, this would be 'some guy who starts this gig, essentially, as a scam, but who evolves over the course of time to embrace and appreciate the rich heritage and culture of the Lord of the Wakandas'. In issue #50 of the Black Panther, Kevin \\"Kasper\\" Cole makes his first appearance. He is an officer in the narcotics division of the New York Police Department's Organized Crime Control Bureau (OCCB), looking to be promoted to homicide detective. He lives with his mother Ruth and his pregnant girlfriend Gwen in a squalid apartment in Harlem. His father \\"Black\\" Jack is a former cop that has been imprisoned on the charge of corruption. The character was pitched by Priest as a 'dark satire of Spider-Man', in line with work he had done on DC Comics' Steel, who functioned similarly as a 'dysfunctional Superman'. The character of Kasper Cole and his friends and family therefore take many cues from Peter Parker and his supporting cast, with Kasper's mother Ruth correlating with Aunt May, his father Jack with Uncle Ben and his girlfriend Gwen with Gwen Stacy. Priest also drew inspiration from the film Training Day, as well as sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond. The first storyline, \\"Black and White\\", running in issues #50 to #56, focuses on Kasper's investigation into the ties between his boss Sal Anthony and the criminal 66 Bridges gang. Suspended from the police force, he adopts the mantle of the Black Panther - stealing the costume from his Sergeant Tork, an ally of the Panther - so that he can gather evidence. This brings him into conflict with Nigel \\"Triage\\" Blacque (who leads 66 Bridges) and the police department's Internal Affairs. During the course of the investigation, Kasper also comes into contact with the original Black Panther, as well as the Panther's antagonist and half-brother the White Wolf (Hunter). They both attempt to manipulate him to their needs. Christopher Priest has described \\"Black and White\\" as being 'about a war between The Black Panther (T'Challa) and the \\"white panther\\" (Hunter) over the soul of this young kid'. Before the story arc concludes, it is revealed to the reader that 66 Bridges is in fact led by Kasper's father as Kibuka (a plotline that has been left unresolved) and that Triage is his half-brother. Kasper does not succeed in taking down the gang, although he manages to expose a number of crooked cops. He has also struck a deal with his corrupt boss, who will help him take down 66 Bridges if Kasper locates his kidnapped son. This search is key to the final Black Panther story arc, \\"Ascension\\" (#59-62). In order to find the child, Kasper makes a deal with T'Challa's nemesis Erik Killmonger, the then rightful holder of the Black Panther mantle. Given a synthetic version of the herbs that grant the Black Panther his powers, Kasper gains the enhanced skills necessary to locate the child. The arc and the series concludes with Kasper becoming a White Tiger, a sort of acolyte to the Black Panther cult, although he remains in Harlem. Before the final Black Panther arc was finished, Kasper Cole was already designated as one of the feature characters in the short-lived The Crew (2003–2004, 7 issues). He makes his first regular appearance in issue #1 and as the new White Tiger in issue #2. His character provides narration (the only one to do so) for the second, fourth, (part of the) sixth and seventh (the final) issue. In the series, Kasper teams with James Rhodes (War Machine), Danny Vincente (Junta) and Josiah X in taking on Triage and the 66 Bridges Gang. While Kasper's relationship with the other characters is fraught with conflict, they nonetheless manage to defeat Triage. After the conclusion of The Crew, he is referenced in the Civil War: Battle Damage Report one-shot. During Civil War II, Kasper is shown in attendance at James Rhodes' funeral after he is killed by Thanos.Captain America: Sam Wilson #10 Kasper is later shown retired from the world of superheroics, now focusing on his police career after having been kicked out of his apartment by Gwen. T'Challa convinces him to don the White Tiger suit one last time in order to stop Cardiac and Vanisher, the latter of whom has been smuggling stolen vibranium out of Wakanda. Later, T'Challa unveils a new costume for Kasper and says that he wants to train him properly to become a hero again, not as White Tiger or Black Panther, but in a new identity altogether.Black Panther: World of Wakanda #6 Appearance Joe Bennett. Kevin \\"Kasper\\" Cole is depicted as biracial, the child of an African man and a Jewish woman. As a result of the sharp contrast between his light skin and the dark skin of his father, he has been nicknamed Kasper, after Casper the Friendly Ghost. Aspects of his heritage and the colour of his skin are frequently referenced in Black Panther and The Crew. Initially, Kasper Cole was to be modelled after actor Vin Diesel, an idea suggested by artist Oscar Jimenez. Language and culture barriers, as Priest describes it, precluded this suggestion from being properly translated to Jorge Lucas, who ended up as the penciller of the Black Panther title. Power and abilities Kasper Cole was initially non-powered, wearing only the Black Panther's outfit for protection and carrying a pair of 9×19mm pistolsAs can be read in the script for Black Panther #50. (later loaded with non-lethal gel bullets). Later on, after ingesting a synthetic version of the herbs that give the original Black Panther his powers, he possesses peak human physical strength, speed, reflexes and reactions, agility and durability, superhuman eyesight, and night vision. The suit Kasper wears as the Black Panther and later as the White Tiger is a vibranium microweave body suit capable of dissipating the kinetic and hydrostatic shock damage of bullets or bullet-like objects, essentially making it bullet-proof. It also has special vibranium soled boots for scaling vertical surfaces. Anti-metal properties of the Antarctic vibranium in his claws and boots will break down any known metal including adamantium. Kasper also carries energy based throwing daggers capable of paralyzing or tagging his enemies. He can track those tagged via an advanced pocket computer (which also has numerous other capabilities), a Kimiyo Card.

Geography and site The park is in size. It has seven lakes, two rivers, three public bird hides, and meadows. One of the lakes, Lavells Lake is designated as a local nature reserve. The two rivers that flow through the park are the River Loddon and the Emm Brook. The Museum of Berkshire Aviation and the headquarters of the British Entomological and Natural History Society are both located in the park. The site is popular for a number of sports including sailing, angling, kayaking, and canoeing. Other facilities include play areas and a cafe. History Anglo Saxons farmed the park's river meadows and called the area Whistley, where \\"wisc\\" means marshey meadows and \\"lei\\" means a woodland clearing. From the start of the 17th century, much of the area then belonged to Windsor Forest. The present day cafe was originally a farmhouse built in 1904, which was called 'High Chimneys'. In 1924 the area was sold to a farmer who renamed the farm after his home village of Dinton, near Aylesbury. The country park is part of the river Loddon's flood plain and so makes a good source of gravel, between 1969 and 1979 an extensive gravel extraction program was carried out. Much of the gravel was used for the M4 and the A329(M). In 1979 Dinton Pastures was opened to the public. In 1992, part of the country park, Lavells Lake, was declared as a local nature reserve by Wokingham Borough Council.

This was accomplished through the use of a legal fiction devised by lawyers in the fifteenth century to prevent the enforcement of entails. A 1472 case, known as Taltarum's Case, increased the popularity of this proceeding. Background Entails were originally designed to keep ownership of land within a family. Thanks to the effects of the statute De donis conditionalibus, the intent of the entail could not be broken, which meant that land in fee tail could not simply be sold, transferred, or mortgaged, as whatever the current owner did with it, ownership would automatically pass on their death to those specified by the entail. While entails performed a valuable function in the 13th century, when De donis conditionalibus was enacted, by the 15th century, changes in social and economic conditions meant that landowners were more concerned with being able to freely sell, convey or mortgage their land. It was in this time that the common recovery was devised as a way of circumventing De donis conditionalibus. The process The common recovery was intended to turn land held in fee tail into land held in fee simple, and exploited elements of existing legal procedures to achieve this. As a preliminary, there needed to be a conveyance of the land. The owner (in tail) of the land A conveyed it to someone else B (known as the tenant in precipe) to the intent that a third person C (known as the demandant) might sue for it. C accordingly issued a writ against B. In court, B defended his right saying (correctly) that he had acquired it from A. A (now called the vouchee) was called upon to vouch for his right to the land. He alleged that he had acquired it from D (a person known as the common vouchee). D asked for time and failed to appear subsequently; alternatively, he dashed out of the court. In either case, the judgment was that C should recover the land, and that D should compensate B with land of equal value. However, D was chosen because he was a 'man of straw' with no property at all, so that the judgment against him was valueless, and it was never enforced. The result was thus that C recovered land in fee simple, which A had owned in only fee tail; thus, the entail was barred. Occasionally, it was also necessary to bar the rights of other persons E, such as trustees holding in trust for an equitable tenant in tail; in that case A alleged that he had acquired it from E and E alleged it had come from D, but the final result was the same. The actual consequence of a common recovery depended on what the conveyance creating a tenant in precipe said (usually in its final few lines). This might be: * to the use of A and his heirs (i.e. in fee simple) * (if the transaction was in connection with a sale) to the use of C (in fee simple) * (if the transaction was in connection with a mortgage) to the use of C provided that if A paid off the principal and interest then it should revert to A and his heirs. * If the entail was barred so that the land could be resettled (on marriage or otherwise), it might be provided that a father and son could jointly appoint the property as they wished, or there might be detailed provisions as to the future interests in the land. At the end of the proceeding, the lawyers often had an exemplification of the proceedings prepared; this was a formal transcript of the proceedings in the monarch's name and sealed with a large seal, often mounted (to preserve it) in a tin box. Unless there was a whole manor or an advowson involved, the description of the land (which may be exaggerated) merely stated the improvements: number of houses etc.; extent: acres of land; type: meadow, pasture etc.; and the location: township or parish where it was. These descriptions are thus usually not particularly useful as historical sources. Since the purpose of the transaction cannot be known from the recovery, it is possible to say only that the vouchee dealt with the land. Abolition In England and Wales, common recoveries were abolished in 1833; instead a disentailing deed (a successor to that creating the tenant in precipe) was enrolled in Chancery. Since 1926, entails can no longer exist as legal estates, only as equitable interests, and enrollment has become unnecessary. Like Fines (or Final Concords), common recoveries were proceedings based upon a legal fiction in order to produce a genuine change, but without truly adverse parties. In this they differ from the use of a legal fiction in ejectment cases, where there was a genuine dispute, but one that required a legal fiction to make it justiciable.

King Mindaugas was the first and only Lithuanian monarch crowned King of Lithuania with the assent of the Pope. Other monarchs of Lithuania were referred to as grand dukes, kings or emperors in extant foreign written sources as the size of the realm and their power expanded or contracted. This practice can be compared to that of British, Japanese and many other monarchs who are known as kings or emperors in spite of not being crowned with the assent of the Pope. Because Lithuania was pagan in the 13th century, Lithuanian monarchs were not granted the title of a Catholic monarch even though extant Christian sources referred to Lithuanian rulers as kings or emperors regardless of their religious affiliation. For instance, Gediminas titled himself King of Lithuania and Rus, and Duke of Semigalia. The Pope also addressed him as King. The confusion stems from eastern and western European traditions of royal hierarchy and titles. In Eastern Europe, the title of grand duke equalled king and sometimes emperor. In Western Europe, the title of grand duke is reserved to monarchs of small polities and ranks junior to king and emperor. After the formal Christianization and especially after the creation of the personal union with Poland, the Kings of Poland–Lithuania retained the separate titles of Grand Dukes of Lithuania and Kings of Poland (similarly to how the Emperors of Austria–Hungary had retained the separate titles of Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, to some extent). The Catholic crown was to be received from the Pope or Holy Roman Emperor, but being multireligious and powerful, Lithuania was not subservient to either and with rare exceptions did not pursue the title. For diplomatic reasons three further attempts were made to re-establish the Kingdom status – by Vytautas the Great in 1430, by Švitrigaila who wanted to continue Vytautas' attempts at the coronation, and by the Council of Lithuania in 1918. King Mindaugas The papal bull regarding Lithuania's placement under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome In the early 13th century, Lithuania was inhabited by various pagan Baltic tribes, which began to organize themselves into a state – the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By the 1230s, Mindaugas emerged as the leader of the Grand Duchy. In 1249, an internal war erupted between Mindaugas and his nephews Tautvilas and Edivydas. As each side searched for foreign allies, Mindaugas succeeded in convincing the Livonian Order not only to provide military assistance but also to secure for him the royal crown of Lithuania in exchange for his conversion to Catholicism and some lands in western Lithuania. The status of a kingdom was granted on 17 July 1251, when the Bishop of Chełmno was ordered to crown Mindaugas by Pope Innocent IV. Two years later, Mindaugas and his wife Morta were crowned King and Queen of Lithuania. In 1255, Mindaugas received permission from Pope Alexander IV to crown his son King of Lithuania. The coronation and the alliance with the Livonian Order allowed for a period of peace between Lithuania and Livonia. During that time, the Lithuanians expanded east, while Livonia attempted to conquer Samogitia. Enticed by his nephew Treniota, Mindaugas broke the peace after the Order was defeated in the Battle of Skuodas in 1259 and the Battle of Durbe in 1260. Lithuanian forces were, however, unable to prevent the devastating Mongol invasion of Lithuania in 1258–1259. Treniota's influence grew as he waged a war against the Order and his priorities began to diverge from those of Mindaugas. The conflict resulted in the assassination of Mindaugas and two of his sons in 1263. The country reverted to paganism and its status as a kingdom was lost. The state survived as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the subsequent monarchs are known as Grand Dukes as they could not be crowned Kings until they converted to Christianity (the Christianization of Lithuania occurred only in 1387). Attempts to re- establish the Kingdom There was an attempt by Grand Duke Vytautas the Great (ruled 1392–1430) to receive a Catholic crown. At the Congress of Lutsk in 1430, Sigismund, King of Hungary who was yet to be elected Holy Roman Emperor, offered Vytautas the crown and proclaimed Lithuania a (presumably subservient) kingdom. It did not come to fruition, because of the opposition from Polish nobles and later from his first cousin Władysław II Jagiełło.Frost 2015, p. 142-150. According to some historians, the crown was sent to Lithuania by Sigismund, but it was intercepted by Polish forces, but in reality, Sigismund sent only the documents proposing an alliance between him, Vytautas and the Teutonic Order, and judgement from legal experts that the coronation could be performed by the bishop of Vilnius.Frost 2015, p. 148-149 Soon afterwards, Vytautas died without having been crowned Catholic king. Following the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Kings of Poland were also crowned as Grand Dukes of Lithuania and therefore they did not use the title of King of Lithuania; the two parts of the Commonwealth were known to as the Grand Duchy and the Polish Crown. After Lithuania declared independence in February 1918, the monarchy was re- established and the 2nd Duke of Urach was invited to become King Mindaugas II. However, the monarchy was short-lived and Mindaugas II never visited Lithuania. The Kingdom of Lithuania was a client-state of the German Empire, and following Germany's defeat in World War I in the fall of 1918, the idea of a monarchy was abandoned in favor of a democratic republic.

In the late 1890s, a rubble masonry dam was started. Its purpose was to power a mill intended to make paper from straw. At stages, the river flowed through a cleft only 4.25 feet (1.3 m) wide. Difficulties in constructing the dam caused the paper mill project to be abandoned. Hydroelectric development continued at intervals, but floods and erosion caused the project to be abandoned in 1912 after approximately $100,000 had been spent.

Polypropylene implants absorb water very slowly, about <0.01% in 24 hours. The polypropylene, which is yarn-like, causes irritation to the implant pocket which causes the production of serum which fills the implant pocket on a continual basis.

Stranmillis () is an area in south Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is also an electoral ward for Belfast City Council, part of the Laganbank district electoral area. As part of the Queen's Quarter, it is the location for prominent attractions such as the Ulster Museum and Botanic Gardens. The area is located on Stranmillis Road, with Malone Road to the west and the River Lagan to the east. Its name, meaning \\"the sweet stream\\" in Irish, refers to the Lagan, whose waters are still fresh at this point, before becoming brackish as the river flows onward toward its mouth in Belfast Lough. Stranmillis Road begins at the junction of University Road, Malone Road and College Gardens, heading uphill and southwards past Friar's Bush Graveyard and a small shopping district, before descending towards the River Lagan. The route then swings to the west around the outside of Stranmillis College and uphill again, before rejoining the Malone Road. The north end of Stranmillis Road contains many shops and restaurants, while the south end of the road is mainly housing. alt=Imposing grey concrete blocks of 20th-century modernist architecture. The Malone and Stranmillis Historic Urban Landscape featured on the 2010 tentative list of sites proposed for addition to the List of World Heritage Sites of the United Kingdom, as an area of architectural interest featuring examples of the Arts and Crafts Movement. History In the 9th or 10th century A.D. a rath was built on the bank of the Lagan. The site is one of Belfast's best surviving ringforts and now lies in the grounds of Stranmillis College. In 1603 Sir Arthur Chichester was granted expansive lands in Ulster, including all of the land west of the Lagan from Carrickfergus to Dunmurry, and the site of the future City of Belfast. In 1606 he leased his Stranmillis lands for 61 years to Moses Hill, who built a plantation castle. This was described in the Report of the Plantation Commissioner around 1611 as being located at a place called \\"Stranmellis\\". The castle guarded a crossing point of the Lagan, close to today's King's Bridge. The site of the castle has been traced to some Victorian farm buildings in the centre of the current estate, and historian George Benn stated during the 19th century that the ruins of the building existed \\"almost within living memory\\". Hill also built a second castle at Malone, on the site of what is now Malone House. Before the lease expired, the Hill family moved out of Stranmillis and the lands reverted to the Chichester family to become the Countess of Donegall's Deer Park. In 1683 Richard Dobbs described it as \\"a very fine Park, well stored with Venison and in it a Horse Course of Two Miles\\". A Donegall document defines it as \\"Stranmellis Park\\". Places of interest Several well-known Belfast landmarks are located in the area, including: *Botanic Gardens, a public park opened in 1828, including some rare species in the 19th-century Palm House and Tropical Ravine. *The Ulster Museum is situated adjacent to the park and has been located in Stranmillis since 1929. *The Lyric Theatre moved to its current location on the bank of the Lagan in 1968. The theatre was fully redeveloped between 2007 and 2011. Stranmillis University College =Stranmillis College and Queen's University= Stranmillis University College is located at the midway point of the road. Established as a teaching college in 1922, it is now a constituent college of Queen's University.

Their music is characterised by a melodic blend of pop, folk and traditional Celtic influences. Often compared to Scottish bands with a similar sound like Big Country, Del Amitri and The Proclaimers, The Silencers have distinguished themselves with their eclectic sounds, prolific output and continued career. Their first single, \\"Painted Moon,\\" was a minor international hit and invited critical comparisons to Simple Minds and U2. In 1987 they released their first album A Letter From St. Paul, which included \\"Painted Moon\\" and another minor hit, \\"I See Red.\\" Buoyed by the huge European hit \\"Bulletproof Heart\\", the band's third album Dance to the Holy Man is the band's commercial peak to date. Throughout the 1990s, The Silencers saw a popular taste shift away from their songwriter-based style of music toward grunge and electronic music. History Before forming The Silencers, vocalist Jimme O'Neill and guitarist Cha Burns were active in London's new wave music scene. O'Neill wrote songs for Paul Young and Lene Lovich, while Burns played guitar in Adam Ant's backing band during 1982–1984 together with Fingerprintz drummer Bogdan Wiczling. O'Neill, who, in the mid 1970s, had worked for a time as a clerical assistant in the Department of Health and Social Security, released a single for Oval Records in 1975, \\"Achin' in My Heart\\"/\\"Cold on Me\\", under the name Jimme Shelter (a throwback to the song, \\"Gimme Shelter\\" by The Rolling Stones). =1980s= In 1979, they met and formed a post-punk/new wave project called Fingerprintz, and released three albums under that name: The Very Dab, Distinguishing Marks and Beat Noir. They earned some critical recognition and notable appearances on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show and the BBC's In Concert radio series. The group split in 1985. Then O'Neill formed a duo with electropop singer Jacqui Brookes and they released two singles in 1983: \\"Haunted Cocktails\\" and \\"Lost Without Your Love\\". When Brookes subsequently released solo album Sob Stories, O'Neill wrote or co-wrote a majority of the tracks and played guitar and other instruments on the album. Soon O'Neill and Burns were playing music together again, this time joined by drummer Martin Hanlin and bass player Joseph Donnelly, a cousin of Simple Minds singer Jim Kerr. After considering band names like 'My Granny's Green Chair' and 'The Hot Dog From Hell', they settled on 'The Silencers'. In September 1986, they began to tour Europe and the United Kingdom. They demoed three new songs at Scarf Studios in London: \\"Painted Moon\\", \\"I See Red\\" and \\"I Can't Cry\\". The demos earned them a recording contract with RCA Records, and their song \\"Painted Moon\\", about O'Neill's personal reaction to the Falklands War, was included on the soundtrack to the film The Home Front, and then released as their first single in April 1987. Their first album A Letter from St. Paul included re- recorded versions of all three demos. The Pretenders invited the band to support them on their European tour, and then the success of Painted Moon across the pond induced a tour of the United States on their own, and later with Squeeze. In 1988, The Silencers toured Europe with The Alarm and Painted Moon became a radio hit in the UK. The band moved back to Scotland and recorded a second album A Blues for Buddha at CaVa Studios in Glasgow, with Flood producing. The standout tracks were \\"Scottish Rain\\", about love and fallout from Chernobyl, and \\"The Real McCoy\\" which became a fan favourite. The band then toured Europe with Simple Minds for four months, culminating with a stadium show at Wembley in front of 80,000. =1990s= After the tour, the band began work on third album Dance to the Holy Man, but personal conflict derailed the process. Donnelly and Hanlin left the band, and were replaced by Tony Soave on drums and Lewis Rankine on bass. The album, a departure from the band's \\"guitar-based atmosphere pop\\", was recorded during the summer of 1990. It included funk, blues, and Celtic strains. The O'Neill-penned \\"This Is Serious\\" had previously been submitted to other artists and had been recorded twice prior to The Silencers' version; in 1987 Eric Martin recorded it for his I'm Only Fooling Myself album, and one year later Marilyn Martin recorded it for her 1988 album, which took its name from the track. The single \\"Bulletproof Heart\\", a re-recording of a track from the Fingerprintz album \\"Distinguishing Marks\\" and later to be covered by Jim Kerr for his Lostboy project, became a big hit in Spain and France, where the band had success at that time, but album sales lagged back in the United Kingdom (Dance to the Holy Man entered nevertheless the UK Top 40, it was their first entry, and last to date, in this chart). Coatbridge-born JJ Gilmour joined the band as a second male vocalist before another tour of Europe, and Stevie Kane joined the band, replacing Rankine during the tour due to personality conflict. Deeply in debt to RCA and not having the expected success in the UK, The Silencers were in danger of being dropped by their record label despite their success throughout Europe. However, after label representatives saw an impressive live show they allowed the band to begin work on fourth album Seconds of Pleasure. \\"I Can Feel It\\" (the video for which featured a cameo role from Frances Corrigan, O'Neill's daughter's friend from Coatbridge) was, true to form, a hit in Europe and ignored in the UK. Without tour support from RCA, the band financed its own tour to Switzerland, France and Scotland. In 1994, The Silencers signed to new labels: Permanent for Britain and BMG for France. That summer they recorded a cover of the song \\"Wild Mountain Thyme\\", featuring O'Neill's daughter Aura on vocals. It became a hit in Scotland after featuring in a tourism board advertising campaign. Soon after, they completed fifth album So Be It. After a mid-1996 tour of Europe, Gilmour and Soave left the band. Jim McDermott of the Kevin McDermott Orchestra joined on drums and Aura O'Neill became a permanent member of the band. The year 1996 brought the release of singles compilation Blood & Rain, and The Silencers took several years off from recording. In 1999, the band worked on seventh album Receiving, which was financed by money from festival appearances in Europe. Speaking of the new record, O'Neill said, \\"Some of the new tracks were recorded as if this was a different band. I wanted to forget about everything we'd done before and some of what came out reminded me of Fingerprintz – new wave for the nineties!\\" The experimental nature of the songs, he said, was inspired by the influence of Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs and Charles Bukowski. =2000s= In 2001, the band released their first live album, A Night of Electric Silence, recorded in Glasgow in 2000, with McDermott on drums, Stevie Kane on bass, Phil Kane on keyboards, O'Neill on guitar and vocals, Milla on violin and Aura O'Neill on vocals. In November 2004, Come was released, featuring the tracks \\"Siddharta\\", \\"Let It Happen\\" and \\"Head\\". However, by this time most of the band's albums were out of print. In July 2006, Baptiste Brondy, a 20-year-old French drummer, replaced McDermott. Burns was six days past his 50th birthday when he died of lung cancer in the Welsh seaside resort of Prestatyn on 26 March 2007.

His second novel, it was published by Bantam Books in 1987, in which year it was nominated for the Philip K Dick Award. In 1990, it won the Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis. Plot summary David Mingolla is an artillery specialist in the United States Army serving in a near-future Central American war (references are made to then-future \\"Afghanistan in '89\\" and a nuclear weapon that destroyed Tel Aviv). As his unit serves in \\"Free Occupied Guatemala\\", Mingolla goes on leave and meets a woman named Debora in a cantina. They gradually become lovers; however, as they get close to each other, Mingolla feels intense mental pain later identified as a psychic probing his mind. Soon after this, Mingolla is recruited into the Psicorps, an elite group of psychics the United States has assembled to counter the Soviet Union's own. Debora, a veteran of the revolt that led to American intervention in the first place, is designated his target. On his way through Psicorps training to refine his mental abilities, Mingolla learns that this front of the Cold War (published before 1991, before USSR's fall) as well as the war itself is a manipulation by two Panamanian families, the Madradonas and the Sotomayors, over three centuries to increase psychic potential in humanity as well as their own genetic diversity. Mingolla and Debora meet and part several times before their meeting with the Madradonas and Sotomayors in Darién, Panama and become embroiled with the members of Mingolla's former squad in a firefight which culminates in the nuclear destruction of Panama City. David and Debora leave the city and their former friends and antagonists behind them, deciding that ultimately what matters is their love for one another, the only item that has not been blatantly manipulated. The fictional work excerpted several times in the novel, Juan Pastorín's short story collection The Fictive Boarding House, gives clues to the nature of the novel and Mingolla's experiences himself in a type of foreshadowing. The lyrics of Prowler heard or sung or thought among members of Mingolla's unit which bookend Life during Wartime serve this function as well. As a nod to science fiction author Philip K. Dick's work, the text itself does not present a clear or objective account of what truly happened to Mingolla or what was hallucination on his part. (At one point on Mingolla's journey, an AI combining a downed Sikorsky helicopter and a long-range guided missile imparts \\"revelation\\" to him.) PsiCorps' intensive drug therapy to hone Mingolla's potential as well as the presence and use of \\"Sammy\\" (short for Samurai, an intense stimulant) and Frost, a super-addictive version of cocaine, make the third person point of view essential for this novel.

De-regulation of CK2 has been linked to tumorigenesis as a potential protection mechanism for mutated cells. Proper CK2 function is necessary for survival of cells as no knockout models have been successfully generated.  Structure  Ribbon structure of CK2 tetramer containing two α and two β subunitsCK2 typically appears as a tetramer of two α subunits; α being 42 kDa and α’ being 38 kDa, and two β subunits, each weighing in at 28 kDa. The β regulatory domain only has one isoform and therefore within the tetramer will have two β subunits. The catalytic α domains appear as an α or α’ variant and can either be formed in a homodimer (α & α, or α’ & α’) formation or heterodimer formation (α & α’). It is worth noting that other β isoforms have been found in other organisms but not in humans. The α subunits do not require the β regulatory subunits to function, this allows dimers to form of the catalytic domains independent of β subunit transcription. The presence of these α subunits does have an effect on the phosphorylation targets of CK2. A functional difference between α and α’ has been found but the exact nature of differences isn’t fully understood yet. An example is that Caspase 3 is preferentially phosphorylated by α’ based tetramers over α based tetramers.  Function  CK2 is a protein kinase responsible for phosphorylation of substrates in various pathways within a cell; ATP or GTP can be used as phosphate source. CK2 has a dual functionality with involvement in cell growth/proliferation and suppression of apoptosis. CK2s anti-apoptotic function is in the continuation of the cell cycle; from G1 to S phase and G2 to M phase checkpoints. This function is achieved by protecting proteins from caspase-mediated apoptosis via phosphorylation of sites adjacent to the caspase cleavage site, blocking the activity of caspase proteins. CK2 also protects from drug-induced apoptosis via similar methods but it is not as well understood. Knockdown studies of both α and α’ sub-units have been used to verify this anti-apoptotic function. Important phosphorylation events also regulated by CK2 are found in DNA damage repair pathways, and multiple stress-signaling pathways. Examples are phosphorylation of p53 or MAPK, which both regulate many interactions within their respective cellular pathways. Another indication of separate function of α subunits is that mice that lack CK2α’ have a defect in the morphology of developing sperm.  Regulation  Although the targets of CK2 are predominantly nucleus-based the protein itself is localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Casein kinase 2 activity has been reported to be activated following Wnt signaling pathway activation. A Pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and Dishevelled appear to be an intermediary between Wnt-mediated activation of the Frizzled receptor and activation of CK2. Further studies need to be done on the regulation of this protein due to the complexity of CK2 function and localization. Phosphorylation of CK2α T344 has been shown to inhibit its proteasomal degradation and support binding to Pin1. O-GlcNAcylation at S347 antagonizes this phosphorylation and accelerates CK2 degradation.  Role in tumorigenesis  Among the array of substrates that can be altered by CK2 many of them have been found in increased prevalence in cancers of the breast, lung, colon, and prostate. An increased concentration of substrates in cancerous cells infers a likely survival benefit to the cell, and activation of many of these substrates requires CK2. As well the anti-apoptotic function of CK2 allows the cancerous cell to escapes cell death and continue proliferating. Having roles in cell cycle regulation may also indicate CK2’s role in allowing cell cycle progression when normally it should have been ceased. This also promotes CK2 as a possible therapeutic target for cancer drugs. When added with other potent anti-cancer therapies, a CK2 inhibitor may increase the effectiveness of the other therapy by allowing drug-induced apoptosis to occur at a normal rate.  Role in viral infection  In SARS- CoV-2 (COVID-19) infected Caco-2 cells, the phosphorylase activity of CK2 is increased resulting in phosphorylation of several cytoskeletal proteins. These infected cells also display CK2-containing filopodia protrusions associated with budding viral particles. Hence the protrusions may assist the virus in infecting adjacent cells. In these same cells, the CK2 inhibitor silmitasertib displayed potent antiviral activity. Senhwa Biosciences and the US National Institutes of Health have announced that they will evaluate the efficacy of silmitasertib in treating COVID-19 infections.

Established in 1903 as a picnic spot by the Camden Interstate Railway Company, it is one of only thirteen trolley parks that remain open in the United States. Whereas most trolley parks were located at the end of trolley lines, Camden Park is unusual in that it was built where riders traveling between Huntington and nearby cities would stop to change lines. Not long after opening, the park soon gained a carousel and other roadside attractions. Camden Park is West Virginia's only amusement park. The park is home to more than thirty rides and attractions, including a full-size traditional wooden roller coaster, the Big Dipper, and several other vintage rides. Over the years, Camden Park has featured a swimming pool, a roller rink, and even a small zoo. Today, the park hosts a variety of events throughout the year, including live musical performances as part of the \\"Hot Summer Nights\\" concert series. Other events include the \\"Children's Festival,\\" \\"Coca-Cola Days,\\" and the \\"Halloween Spooktacular.\\" The park is typically open six days a week from late May to early August, with a more limited schedule in late August, and select dates in September and October.  History  Camden Park was established as a picnic spot by the Camden Interstate Railway Company in 1903, and named after former West Virginia Senator Johnson N. Camden. As steamboat traffic gave way to intercity trolleys, the park was located near the mouth of Twelvepole Creek, where riders traveling between Huntington, Ceredo, Kenova, Ashland, and Coal Grove would stop to change lines. The first amusement park ride, a carousel, was built around 1903; the park owners consider this to be the official date of the park's founding, celebrating the park's eightieth anniversary in 1983, and centennial in 2003; promotional materials produced in 2013 describe the park as having provided \\"110 years\\" of fun. About 1912, the park's first roller coaster was added. Described as the \\"new sensation,\\" the attraction featured a tall hill, a spiraling section, and several dips of various lengths. Eustace Via purchased Camden Park from the Ohio Valley Electric Railway in 1916, and operated the park until the end of World War II, adding various rides and attractions. The park was subsequently sold to a group of investors, including Harry Nudd, who operated the park. Deeming the original roller coaster unsafe, the owners demolished it in the summer of 1957. Nudd obtained plans for what became the Big Dipper, a new wooden roller coaster that opened in the summer of 1958. The park subsequently came into the hands of J.P. Boylin, whose family continues to operate the park and its attractions. Many of the attractions are vintage amusement park rides, such as the carousel, The Whip, Tilt-A-Whirl, Paratrooper, Dodgem Cars, and Scrambler. The park also features a miniature railway with a covered bridge, a vintage Pretzel Haunted House ride, swan-shaped pedal boats, a miniature golf course, arcade games, shooting galleries, and a restaurant. The park once featured a roller rink, and a paddleboat attraction known as the Camden Queen, which took riders on a short excursion up the Ohio River. In the center of the park is an Indian mound, once used as a picnic area, but now heavily grown over with trees. Many large sycamores formerly lined the park's midway, but these appear to have been cut down in the 1990s. \\"Gallery: Camden Park through the years\\", in The Herald-Dispatch, June 3, 2013.  Major rides and attractions  Riders enjoy a spin on the Big Dipper. *Big Dipper - Camden Park's most famous attraction, a traditional wooden roller coaster built by National Amusement Devices in 1958. The ride replaced an earlier roller coaster that had been built on the same site about 1912, and which was demolished in 1957. The Big Dipper features original Century Flyer cars with working headlights, and a classic figure-eight track design.Century Flyer cars The ride's name refers to a big dip measuring almost the full height of the roller coaster after the first turn. A second, shallower dip leads into an unlit tunnel, from which the cars emerge shortly before returning to the pavilion to let off passengers. The Big Dipper is one of only three National Amusement Devices roller coasters still in operation; one of the other two is Camden Park's miniature roller coaster, the Lil' Dipper. American Coaster Enthusiasts lists the Big Dipper as an \\"ACE Coaster Classic.\\" *Lil' Dipper - a miniature wooden roller coaster with steel supports, this ride was built by National Amusement Devices in 1961. *Paratrooper - a classic amusement park ride featuring ten cars, each large enough for two adults or three children. Each car is suspended from a framework that can be raised and lowered as the cars circle the ride, so that the cars continually rise and fall as they travel. The cars pivot above a canopy, giving the impression of a parachute or umbrella. Camden Park's Paratrooper ride is located on the south side of the park, adjacent to U.S. Route 60, and west of the carousel. During the 1980s and 1990s, each car sported a different color of metallic paint, with a yellow interior. In recent years, the exteriors have been repainted metallic blue. *Carousel - an ornate merry-go-round, featuring undulating horses and stationary seats. The park's current carousel celebrated one hundred years of operation in 2007. *Log Flume - a basic log flume ride, featuring two-seated cars molded in the shape of logs; each car can hold from two to six passengers. The cars float down a winding channel surrounded by tall grass, cat-tails and other wetland plants, and are pulled up two hills, from which they rapidly descend, resulting in large splashes. Camden Park's log flume was constructed in 1983, as part of the park's 80th anniversary celebration. The ride is located in the northeastern portion of the park, and typically has the park's longest lines on hot summer days. *Haunted House - a dark ride inspired by ghost stories, monster movies, and mad scientists. The narrow, winding corridors feature sudden and unexpected lights and noises, luminescent paint and models, and animated props. The ride is said to be one of only two gravity-fed Pretzel rides remaining in the United States. *Slingshot - a figure eight roller coaster with spinning cars and Camden Park's latest ride that opened in May 2016. *Camden Princess - a customized Zamperla Rockin' Tug. *Miniature Train - a miniature railroad, featuring a replica steam locomotive and four cars with wooden bench seating and one fully open side. In the 1980s and 1990s, the cars were decorated in a wild west theme, and each was named for a city made famous in western folklore, including Dodge City and Tombstone. The ride begins near the midway, and circles the northeastern portion of the park, passing through a covered bridge before turning for home. Until the 1980s, the wild west theme was portrayed with life-sized dioramas of Indian attacks on settler cabins; as the train passed, riders heard and saw gunfire from the rifles, and saw fallen settlers and panicked housewives. The dioramas were removed in the 1990s, but recently a Hatfield–McCoy motif has been added in their place. *Kite Flyer - a Zamperla ride, in which the riders lie flat and experience a sensation similar to hang-gliding. *Tilt-A-Whirl - a classic Selner ride, featuring seven gondolas attached by center pivots to an undulating floor. As the ride speeds up, the gondolas turn in a circle around the center pivot, sometimes picking up enough speed to fling riders against the backs of their seats. *Flying Scooters - A ride consisting of a center post with ride vehicles suspended from arms attached to the center post. *Skyliner - a chairlift ride, which gives two or three riders an aerial view of the park. Riders board and get off again in the center of the park, just south of the miniature railroad tracks. The ride parallels the southern path of the railroad tracks, and overlooks the miniature golf course and part of the parking lot. In the 1980s and 1990s, the ride was painted bright orange, but since that time it has been repainted in lime green. *Swan Lake - a paddleboat ride located in the northern end of the park, between the log flume and the Tilt-A-Whirl. The boats are shaped like giant swans. *The Rattler - Riders are suspended from an overhead axis and go through dual swinging and spinning motions. *The Whip - a classic flat ride, built at Coney Island by William F. Mangels; one of a handful still in existence. Another is the Kiddie Whip featured among Camden Park's children's rides. *West Virginia Adventure Golf - An 18-hole miniature golf course, designed by Castle Golf, featuring various West Virginia-themed landscapes, including a grist mill, covered bridge, cabin, chapel, and various animatronic figures. One hole depicts a shootout between the Hatfields and the McCoys. The course is located on the site of an earlier miniature golf course, and the former Thunderbolt Express. *Mound Builder Pavilion - a covered outdoor picnic area and stage where live musical performances are featured. The pavilion is named for the park's Indian mound.  Children's rides Children enjoying the Umbrella Car ride. *Junior Whip - a miniature Whip ride located near the park entrance, together with other children's rides. *Dune Buggies - a set of miniature cars that follow a preset track. *Skyfighter - a children's airplane ride. *Handcars - a series of hand-powered sledges that travel along a path of winding rails. This ride is adjacent to the park entrance. *Boat ride - a miniature boat ride designed for younger children; the two-seater gondolas appear to be floating in water. *Pony Carts - a miniature, flat carousel-style ride for small children. This ride is located near the skyliner, just south of the miniature railroad. *Umbrella Car Ride - a flat, carousel-style ride for small children, featuring automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, and other vehicles.  Former rides and attractions  * Bull's Eye - A roundup wheel ride that goes in diagonal directions. Formerly known as The Rainbow. It was closed following the 2016 season and replaced with Slingshot. * Camden Park Zoo - located North of the train station; it was removed in the early 1970s. * Caterpillar - a classic amusement park ride operated at Camden Park in the 1950s. The cars followed an undulating circular track. A similar Music Express-type ride, the Hot Cat, was featured at the park from the 1990s to 2011. * Cloud 9 - located between the Little Dipper and the railroad tracks in the early 1980s. * Dodgem Cars - a traditional bumper car ride from the 1940s; a series of center islands consisting of firmly anchored tire bumpers usually keeps traffic moving counter-clockwise, but cars can pass between the islands to engage one another and cause chaos. In the 1980s and 1990s, the cars were painted in glossy orange, yellow, green, blue, white, and black. Destroyed by an electrical fire in July 2013.http://www.wowktv.com/story/22893877/crews-on-the-scene-of-a- structure-fire-at-camden-park * Enterprise - a fast, looping, inverted \\"Ferris wheel\\"-like ride, featuring a mural of the Starship Enterprise from Star Trek: The Next Generation. The ride was closed in 1993, after a hydraulic malfunction resulted in injuries to more than fifty riders. \\"Readers remember 100 years of Camden Park\\", in The Herald-Dispatch, April 14, 2013. *Fun Slide - a tall, multi-lane slide that stood between the Little Dipper and the railroad tracks in the early 1980s. Riders climbed a long series of stairs, and slid down one of the lanes on a burlap mat. Camden Park's slide featured blue lanes, and its steps were painted brown. *Hot Cat - a Music Express-type Caterpillar ride, the Hot Cat featured a train on an undulating circular track, half of which was enclosed in a darkened shed-like structure. The exterior was brightly lit with flashing lights, while loud music played both inside and out. The Hot Cat was a featured attraction at Camden Park from the 1990s to 2011, but was dismantled in 2012. It stood south of the Big Dipper, and west of the Paratrooper and Magic Rainbow. *Hurricane - a classic Hurricane ride manufactured by Dartron Industries. Camden Park's Hurricane ride was painted blue with yellow cars, each adorned with the name of a famous hurricane from the 1950s or 1960s, including Audrey, Betsy, Beulah, Camille, Carol, and Hazel. The ride was a fixture of the park during the 1980s, and was located in the park's northeast corner, behind the log flume, and next to the Tilt-a-Whirl. It was replaced by the Kite Flyer. *Miniature Golf - in the 1970s and 1980s, a miniature golf course was located north of the skating rink. This area was later occupied by the Thunderbolt Express. A new, 18-hole miniature golf course has opened in its place. *Roller Coaster - Camden Park's first wooden roller coaster, originally described as the \\"new sensation.\\" Riders were taken to the top of a tall hill, then sent down a gentle dip, and then into a counter-clockwise spiral, followed by an elliptical course featuring several smaller dips, and returning to the pavilion. Painted white, the roller coaster was complemented by a red-roofed tower adjacent to the top of the first hill. This ride was demolished in the summer of 1957, and construction began on the Big Dipper, which opened the following summer. *Scrambler An Eli Bridge ride in which riders are spinning in cars that look like they will crash into each other. *Skydiver - a \\"looping ferris wheel\\" ride, opened in 2001 on the site of the former Camden Park skating rink. The ride was closed following the 2009 season, and was replaced by the Rockin' Tug, in a different location, for 2010. * Spider - A classic amusement park ride, featuring eight arms, each with two independently spinning two-seater cars (larger Spiders sometimes featured four cars per arm). The cars traveled diagonally in a circle, and paused to let riders on and off at the lowest point, until all of the cars were occupied. This left some riders suspended at the ride's highest point, pointing upwards at the sky, and a large sycamore to the south of the Indian mound. For many years, the Spider was located along the park's midway, between the restaurant and the Indian mound. It was closed and dismantled following a 2011 accident, in which one of the arms broke off and fell to the ground, injuring three riders. \\"Three hospitalized after Spider ride collapses at Camden Park\\", in The Herald-Dispatch, July 24, 2011. Camden Park's Spider was painted black, with white car interiors, and was usually illuminated after dark with yellow and white fluorescent tubes and clear incandescent bulbs; toward the end of its life, the yellow fluorescent bulbs were replaced by red. *Tip-Top - a flat ride manufactured by Hrubetz featuring ten tub-like cars, each with two bench seats and a large, horizontal wheel in the center. The ride would spin and be propelled upward by compressed air. Each car would spin independently, and riders could influence the speed and direction of their spin by pulling or pushing against the wheel. In the 1980s this ride was located south of the Indian mound, between the Scrambler and the Spider. The Flying Scooters ride has occupied this location since 2006. * Thunderbolt Express - a shuttle roller coaster, originally known as Kings Island's Screamin' Demon ride. The Screamin' Demon was closed and sold in 1987, and reopened at Camden Park for the 1988 season, immediately north of the skating rink, on land that had previously been used as a miniature golf course. As the Thunderbolt Express, the ride operated until 1999, when it was closed following a circuit board malfunction. The ride never re-opened, and was dismantled in 2004 after falling into disrepair. *Yo-Yo - a classic amusement park ride, featuring a series of swings suspended on long chains from a rotating upper carousel. This ride was located south of the Big Dipper, immediately west of the Paratrooper and Magic Rainbow rides during the late 1980s. Camden Park's was painted yellow, with black and white trim. The same type of ride had previously been operated at Camden Park in the late 1970s. Popular culture *Camden Park is a location in the video game Fallout 76. *One of Camden Park's rides makes an appearance in the opening titles to the TV adaptation of the popular podcast My Brother, My Brother and Me.

He launched the first Protestant mission to Arabic-speaking Muslims, and settled in Baghdad, now the capital of Iraq, and later in southern India. His ideas influenced a circle of friends who became leaders in the Plymouth Brethren. Among these were JN Darby, JV Parnell (Lord Congleton), and George Müller, who had married Groves' sister Mary. The significance of Groves lies in his desire to simplify the task of churches and missions by returning to the methods of Christ and his apostles described in the New Testament. As a missionary, his goal was to help indigenous converts form their own churches without dependence on foreign training, authorisation or finance. His ideas eventually found wide acceptance in evangelical circles. Biography Groves was born in Newton Valence, Hampshire, England and was the only son in a family of six. His father was a businessman and the family were Anglicans, attending church in Fulham. Having trained as a dentist in London, he set up practice in Plymouth, at the age of 19. Two years later he married his cousin Mary Bethia Thompson, and moved to Exeter. =Call to missionary work= In 1826, while continuing his dentistry in Exeter, he enrolled as an external student of theology at Trinity College, Dublin, with a view to ordination in the Church of England and appointment with the Church Missionary Society. His study of the New Testament led him to believe that the practices of the early church should be considered a model for every age and culture, and this caused him to consider withdrawing from Trinity College, from the CMS, and from the Anglican communion on his wife's advice. However, he had already laid the money aside and considered that he would be thought fickle if he suddenly abandoned his application. The morning before he was due to depart for Dublin, however, he was awoken by a noise and, on investigating, found that a burglary had taken place. Two packets of money were in his drawers – one containing £40 for the Irish trip and the other containing £16 for taxes: only the packet containing £40 was taken. Groves took this as a sign from God that he was not to go to Dublin and thereafter he gave up the idea.page 80 of \\"Diary and Letters of Henry Craik\\" – W Elfe Tayler He met with other Christian believers in private houses for study of the apostles' doctrine, and for fellowship, breaking of bread, and prayer, as was the custom of the early church (Acts 2:42), without requiring the presence of any ordained minister. It was here that he met JN Darby and others who were later to become prominent leaders in the Plymouth Brethren movement. He became increasingly concerned with the drift of the Plymouth Brethren* Groves' famous \\"prophetic letter\\" to Darby expressing his concerns that the \\"brethren\\" were turning into another Christian denomination towards sectarianism under the leadership of Darby and aligned himself with George Müller when the brethren split in 1848 to form the Open Brethren and Exclusive Brethren. =Missionary to Baghdad= In 1829 Groves and his wife Mary set out for Baghdad, together with their two young sons, Henry and Frank, and accompanied by several Christian friends, one of whom was John Kitto. A second party set out to join them the following year, including Francis William Newman and John Vesey Parnell. In March 1831 Baghdad entered upon a year of intense misery, with civil war, plague, floods and famine, in which Groves suffered the death of his wife and a recently born baby daughter. =Missionary to India= At this time, a revised charter granted to the East India Company opened the way for unrestricted Christian missionary work in India. On invitation from Colonel Arthur Cotton, in 1833, Groves visited widely among missionaries in India, and found open doors for the gospel in many parts of the country. In 1834 he accompanied the Scottish missionary educator Alexander Duff from Calcutta to Scotland, nursing him slowly back to health. Duff probably owed his life to Groves's attentions, as indeed did Arthur Cotton on an earlier occasion. During his time in Britain, Groves married for a second time. His wife was Harriet Baynes. The wedding took place on 25 April 1835 at St Mary's Church, Great Malvern. She accompanied Groves when he returned to India in 1836. Groves was accompanied by John Kitto, Edward Cronin and John V Parnel (2nd Baron Congleton). Rejoined by his sons and others from Baghdad, he established a missionary team in Madras supported largely through his dentistry, and later a farm and mission settlement in Chittoor. He recruited a number of missionaries to assist existing efforts in several parts of India, and to pioneer new ventures, notably in the Godavari Delta and Tamil Nadu. Groves advocated the adoption of the New Testament as a manual of missionary methods. As a primitivist among missiologists, he pre-dated the more celebrated Roland Allen by eighty years. One of Groves's Indian disciples was John Arulappan who adopted his principles. As a full-time evangelist, Arulappan lived \\"by faith\\" and stimulated the creation of a network of indigenous Indian fellowships. Groves's ideas were later taken up in India by descendants of Arulappan associated with Bakht Singh, and, in a Chinese context, by Watchman Nee. Groves continued preaching and teaching in India until ill health forced him back to England in 1852. His niece, Lydia Müller, wrote at the time 'Leaning his head on his hand, he sweetly fell asleep in Jesus, at twelve on Friday, 20 May 1853'page 501 of \\"Memoir of AN Groves with the Supplement\\" – Third Edition, Harriet Groves, published in 1869 by James Nisbet & Co, Berners Street, London in the home of his sister's husband George Müller. He is buried in Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol. He considered his life a failure, and did not live long enough to see the worldwide impact of his ideas and example on a new generation of \\"faith missions\\" springing from the 1859-60 Revivals. Influence =Author= In 1825, Groves wrote a small booklet Christian Devotedness, expounding Jesus' teaching concerning stewardship of material possessions. He exhorted all Christians to live economically, trusting God to supply their needs, and devoting their income to the cause of the Gospel. This booklet had a major impact upon George Müller, and through him on James Hudson Taylor (who soon after conversion attended the Kennington meeting where Edward Cronin was local) and many other significant Christian leaders. Groves' early journals Journal of a Residence in Baghdad were edited by AJ Scott and published by J Nisbet, London in 1831 & 1832\\\\. After his death, his memoirs were published in 1856 by his widow Harriet Groves, under the title Memoir of the late AN Groves, containing Extracts from his Letters and Journals. =Letters= Throughout his life, Groves corresponded with several prominent leaders of the early Brethren movement. His letters are a notable primary source for historians of the Plymouth Brethren. =Sectarianism, Communion & Ordination= Groves, an Anglican, came to recognize fellowship of genuine Christians based on \\"Life, not light.\\" http://www.bruederbewegung.de/pdf/grovesdarby.pdf In a letter to J. N. Darby (10 March 1836,) he wrote, \\"I ever understood our principle of union to be the possession of the common life or common blood of the family of God (for the life is in the blood); these were our early thoughts, and are my most matured ones...\\" and \\"I would infinitely rather bear with all their evils, then separate from their good. These were the then principles of our separation and intercommunion.\\" page 25 of \\"A History of the Brethren Movement\\" – Second Edition, Roy Coad, published in 1976 by the Paternoster Press, London Thus he gathered with others of like mind for communion that ignored sectarian divisions, setting the stage for \\"Open communion\\" based on faith in Jesus alone, not denominational affiliation. And he later came to realize that ordination—official recognition of authority and privilege in ministry—was itself unbiblical. \\"One day, the thought was brought to my mind, that ordination of any kind to preach the gospel is no requirement of Scripture. To me it was the removal of a mountain.\\"page 22 of \\"A History of the Brethren Movement\\" – Second Edition, Roy Coad, published in 1976 by the Paternoster Press, London These principles had an effect on non-conformist churches then and non-denominational churches today. =Father of faith missions= The biography by RB Dann shows that Anthony Norris Groves may be rightly regarded as the \\"father of faith missions,\\" i.e., the principle that a missionary, if called and sent by the Holy Spirit, should go to their mission in faith, believing that God will thus provide for all their needs—and without first raising funds from supporters. In addition, such a missionary should not publish their financial needs but rather wait in faith for God to provide. By his example, Groves challenged much of previous (and current) thinking about the missionary task through his journeys to Mesopotamia and India which he undertook without the backing of the State or Church.

She served in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) from 1912 to 1947. Margaret Phillips was born in Kentucky, but moved to California with her family when she was nine years old and settled in downtown Los Angeles. She was the second of five children. Her older sister Lillian married William A. Hammel, who was sheriff of Los Angeles County twice (1899-1902, 1907-14) and chief of the Los Angeles Police Department from 1904 to 1905. One of Adams's brothers, Oliver Roy Phillips, was also in law enforcement, being a police officer for the Los Angeles Police Department. Margaret Phillips married Elmer Adams on January 1, 1899 in Santa Ana, California. They had two children, Wilbur Vernon Adams and Anna Margaretta Adams Bowdish. In 1912, Margaret Adams and her husband Elmer separated. As she needed to support her two children, her brother-in-law Sheriff William A. Hammel asked her to work at the Los Angeles Sheriff's Office. According to family lore, she accepted the job, but only on the condition that she would be deputized. She took the oath of office on February 16, 1912 and began work in the Civil Division under Juan Murrieta. Margaret Q. Adams served the LASD for 35 years until her retirement in 1947. By that time, she coordinated almost all of the evidence being processed through the Los Angeles Courthouse. Because of the importance of her work, she became close to several of the sheriffs succeeding Bill Hammel. She was even godmother to Judge Warren Biscailuz, son of Sheriff Eugene W. Biscailuz (sheriff from 1932 to 1958). After retirement, Margaret Adams helped to raise her granddaughter Margaret Irene (Bowdish) McDonald after her daughter, Anna Margaretta, died of breast cancer. Margaret I. McDonald carried on the family's pioneering ways, being the first woman to work on the floor of the Pacific Stock Exchange in November 1963. Margaret Queen Adams died in Costa Mesa, California on January 7, 1974, six months short of her 100th birthday. She was buried next to her daughter at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California, wearing her sheriff's shield.

The stories featured various folk tales, Greco-Roman myths, Biblical stories, classic literary adaptations, and adaptations of classical music and ballet, as well as stories about animals written by Thornton Burgess. The soundtracks were often taken from existing children's records, licensed from the original labels, including RCA Records and Capitol Records. 104 cartoons were produced. In October 1960, United Artists bought time on a station in Toledo, Ohio, to test the Mel-O-Toons for audience response; they showed two of the films, \\"Rumplestiltskin\\" and \\"Waltz of the Flowers\\". Variety reported that the viewer response was entirely positive, saying, \\"Many parents compared the Mel-O-Toons favorable to what they called the usual violence in kiddie programming.\\" A week later, UAA bought a full-page ad in Variety, announcing: \\"We passed the test in Toledo!\\" The ad described the test: \\"Here's what happened: Two of these new cartoons were shown in a fifteen-minute on-the-air audition over WSPD-TV.

He was born in Sirajganj in East Bengal (now in Bangladesh). He added the suffix Siraji in honour of his home region. Early life As a young boy, Ismail Hossain Siraji learnt Persian in school and studied Sanskrit at home and was well versed Sanskrit grammar and literature, studied Sanskrit dictionaries as well as Hindu scriptures like Vedas, Manusmriti and Upanishads. Career He earned his living by writing and making public speeches. He acquired a great reputation as an orator. He was an advocate of Muslim interests, but was not a communalist. Hindu-Muslim amity based on equal sharing of resources was his belief. He was active in many parties and organisations, such as, Indian National Congress, Muslim League, Anjuman-i-Ulamah-i-Bangala, Jamiat Ulema-e- Hind, Swarajya Party and Krishak Samiti. He went to Turkey in 1912 with a medical team during the Balkan War. Shibli Nomani and Allama Iqbal influenced Siraji. Like them, he felt that it was necessary to harmonise religious and secular thought to awaken the Indian Muslim community. Muslim Enlightenment of Bengalis Siraji is one of the most prominent figures in the Bengali Muslim Reawakening during the British occupation. He encouraged Muslims to get a good education (especially women whose place in society was merely in the house) and the learning of the English language (many didn't learn the language because they thought that it was the language of the British). He believed in religious tolerance. He also thought that Hindu-Muslim unity would be needed to create a strong Bengali society that would be able to fight against tyranny. His writings often handled these sort of issues. His views were unpopular at first, and during his speeches, he would at times have objects thrown at him.

They served as first-line destroyers through the 1930s, and remained formidable weapons systems well into the Pacific War. History Construction of the advanced Fubuki-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion program from fiscal 1923, intended to give Japan a qualitative edge with the world's most modern ships.Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare p.1040 The Fubuki class had performance that was a quantum leap over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated . The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many light cruisers in other navies.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun page 221-222.

The original purpose of the detector was to explore the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) properties of nucleons (i.e. protons and neutrons). To explore these properties, excitation states of the nuclei require to be measured (e.g. Delta baryons, symbol Δ). These excited states of nucleons decay via the emission of light mesons such as pions (π), eta mesons (η) or kaons (K). Various models exist that describe the correlation between the observed reactions, the excited states and QCD. DAPHNE was built to observe charged light mesons from the decay of excited nucleon states. The excitation of nuclei can be done with either pion scattering, or real photon scattering on the nucleon. Real photon scattering has the advantage that the first vertex can be cleanly described by the well known quantum electrodynamics (QED), while for the pion scattering at least two strong interaction vertices exist that require much more effort from models. The detector was used by the Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique in– Saclay, France (accelerator SATURNE, 19871990) and the Institut für Kernphysik in Mainz, Germany (accelerator MAMI, 1990–2003).  Setup  Two different schematic views of the detector DAPHNE. Perpendicular to the beam line (left) and along the beam line (right). DAPHNE is a cylinder symmetric detector that was built to detect mainly charged particles from excited nucleons. Its construction is made in such way that a high coverage both in momentum and angular space is provided. The angular range of the detector is Ω = 0.94 × 4π steradians. The detector consists of six layers of organic scintillators divided into 16 segments and is cylinder symmetric. These scintillators were originally produced by Nuclear Enterprises. The following table shows the set-up of one of the 16 identical sectors of DAPHNE, starting from the most inner layer. {border=\\"1\\" + DAPHNE Detector Layers ! Layer !! Material !! Thickness !!

To identify particles, the multilayered structure represents a range telescope that allows to determine the energy deposit in each layer and the range of a particle in the detector at all. By the energy losses in each layer and the distribution of energy losses over the layers, the type of particle and its total energy can be determined. This identification is done in a way that measured values are compared to simulated values of particle hypothesis. The maximum likelihood method is used to evaluate which particle hypothesis fits the best to the measured data. The algorithm used checks for proton and charged pion signatures. For a better identification of the observed reaction, DAPHNE is provided with three concentric and independent multiwire proportional chambers. By analysis of data of the chambers it is possible to safely identify up to five different tracks of charged particles for each identified event. A reconstruction uncertainty of 0.2 degrees (azimuthal) and 2 mm (along the beamline) is provided. The chambers are located around the target place, which is in the very center of the detector. The tracks from the chambers are used to calculate the kinematics of a photoproduction reaction. The main information extracted is the path of the proton and the path of charged pions. This information can also be used to reconstruct missing particles that failed getting identified due to detector angular or momentum acceptance or due to the efficiency of the calorimeter.

Located at the intersection of 36th Street and Northern Boulevard in Queens, it is served by the M train on weekdays, the R train at all times except nights, and the E train at night.  History  The Queens Boulevard Line was one of the first lines built by the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND), and stretches between the IND Eighth Avenue Line in Manhattan and 179th Street and Hillside Avenue in Jamaica, Queens.The New York Times, New Subway Routes in Hylan Program to Cost $186,046,000, March 21, 1925, page 1 The Queens Boulevard Line was in part financed by a Public Works Administration (PWA) loan and grant of $25 million. One of the proposed stations would have been located at 36th Street. The first section of the line, west from Roosevelt Avenue to 50th Street, opened on August 19, 1933. trains ran local to Hudson Terminal (today's World Trade Center) in Manhattan, while the (predecessor to current G service) ran as a shuttle service between Queens Plaza and Nassau Avenue on the IND Crosstown Line.  Station layout  This underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. The two center express tracks are used by the E train during daytime hours and the F train at all times. Both platforms have red I-beam columns at regular intervals with every other one having the standard black station sign plates with white lettering. The station's trim line is purple with a black border and name tablets have \\"36TH ST.\\" in white lettering on a black background and purple border. Small directional and name signs are tiled in white lettering on a black border under the trim line and name tablets. This is one of two stations on the R route that is named \\"36th Street\\"; the other is 36th Street on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn. =Exits= The northeast corner entrance to 36th Street station Each platform has two fare control areas and there are no crossovers or crossunders to allow free transfer between directions. The fare control areas on the Manhattan-bound side are on platform level. The full-time one is at the middle and has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases going up to the three-way intersection of Northern Boulevard, 36th Street, and 35th Street, one to the northeast corner and the other to the island formed by these three streets. The Manhattan-bound platform has another un-staffed entrance/exit at the extreme east (railroad north) end. It has two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles and a single staircase going up to the northeast corner of 36th Street and Northern Boulevard. Connecting these two fare control areas is a passageway that was formerly part of the platform as only a full-height fence separates them and it has the platform's trim line and name tablets. The fare control areas on the Forest Hills-bound side are un-staffed and on small mezzanines above the platforms that are connected to each other. One is at the extreme west (railroad south) end and has one staircase to the platform, two HEET turnstiles, a part-time bank of regular turnstiles, and one street stair going up to the south side of Northern Boulevard east of 34th Street. The other fare control area has one staircase to the platform, one HEET turnstile and one exit-only turnstile, and one street stair going up to the south side of Northern Boulevard between 36th and 37th Streets. =Nearby track infrastructure= There are route selector punch boxes on the southbound platform, for the connection to IND 63rd Street Line (currently used by the F train from the express tracks) west of the station. In normal revenue service, all trains that stop at this station continue along the IND Queens Boulevard Line to Queens Plaza. East of this station, the express tracks dive down to a lower level and make a direct route to Roosevelt Avenue along Northern Boulevard while the local tracks turn north into Steinway Street and then east under Broadway. This is because Broadway and Steinway Street are not wide enough to hold four tracks underneath them. The only other line in the system where the express tracks split away from the mainline and make a shortcut is on the IND Culver Line between Seventh Avenue and Church Avenue in Brooklyn.

This enzyme catalyzes the biodegradation of fatty acid derivatives known as gangliosides. The diseases are better known by their individual names. Beta-hexosaminidase is a vital hydrolytic enzyme, found in the lysosomes, that breaks down lipids. When beta-hexosaminidase is no longer functioning properly, the lipids accumulate in the nervous tissue of the brain and cause problems. Gangliosides are made and biodegraded rapidly in early life as the brain develops. Except in some rare, late-onset forms, the GM2 gangliosidoses are fatal. All three disorders are rare in the general population. Tay–Sachs disease has become famous as a public health model because an enzyme assay test for TSD was discovered and developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, providing one of the first \\"mass screening\\" tools in medical genetics. It became a research and public health model for understanding and preventing all autosomal genetic disorders. Tay–Sachs disease, AB variant, and Sandhoff disease might easily have been defined together as a single disease, because the three disorders are associated with failure of the same metabolic pathway and have the same outcome. Classification and naming for many genetic disorders reflects history, because most diseases were first observed and classified based on biochemistry and pathophysiology before genetic diagnosis was available. However, the three GM2 gangliosidoses were discovered and named separately. Each represents a distinct molecular point of failure in a subunit that is required for activation of the enzyme. Tay–Sachs disease Tay–Sachs disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that causes a progressive deterioration of nerve cells and of mental and physical abilities that begins around six months of age and usually results in death by the age of four. It is the most common of the GM2 gangliosidoses. The disease occurs when harmful quantities of cell membrane gangliosides accumulate in the brain's nerve cells, eventually leading to the premature death of the cells. Sandhoff disease Sandhoff disease is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The disease results from mutations on chromosome 5 in the HEXB gene, critical for the lysosomal enzymes beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A and B. Sandhoff disease is clinically indistinguishable from Tay–Sachs disease. The most common form, infantile Sandhoff disease, is usually fatal by early childhood. AB variant GM2-gangliosidosis, AB variant is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that causes progressive destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Mutations in the GM2A gene cause AB variant. The GM2A gene provides instructions for making a protein called the GM2 activator. This protein is a cofactor that is required for the normal function of beta-hexosaminidase A. The disease is usually fatal by early childhood.  Treatment  There are no authorized therapies for the treatment of the GM2 Gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease). The current standard of care for GM2 Gangliosidosis disease is limited to supportive care and aimed at providing adequate nutrition and hydration. This supportive care may substantially improve the quality of life of people affected by GM2. The therapeutic team may include specialists in neurology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, psychiatrist, orthopaedics, nutrition, physical therapy and occupational therapy. = N-Acetyl-Leucine = N-Acetyl-Leucine is an orally administered, modified amino acid that is being developed as a novel treatment for multiple rare and common neurological disorders by IntraBio Inc (Oxford, United Kingdom). N-Acetyl-Leucine has been granted multiple orphan drug designations from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of a various genetic diseases, including GM2 Gangliosidosis (Tay- Sachs and Sandhoff). The US FDA has granted IntraBio a Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for N-Acetyl-Leucine for the treatment of GM2 Gangliosidosis. Compassionate use studies in both Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff patients have demonstrated the positive clinical effects of treatment with N-Acetyl-Leucine for GM2 Gangliosidosis These studies further demonstrated that the treatment is well tolerated, with a good safety profile. A multinational clinical trial investigating N-Acetyl-L-Leucine for the treatment of GM2 Gangliosidosis (Tay- Sachs and Sandhoff) began in 2019 Recruitment is ongoing. IntraBio is also conducting parallel clinical trials with N-Acetyl-L-Leucine for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C and Ataxia-Telangiectasia. Future opportunities to develop N-Acetyl-Leucine include Lewy body dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, restless leg syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and migraine.

He was the son of Qutb ad-Din Muhammad.  Ruler of Khwarazm  = Warfare with the Seljuk suzerain = Atsïz gained his position following his father's death in 1127. During the early part of his reign, he focused on securing Khwarazm against nomad attacks. In 1138, he rebelled against his suzerain, the Seljuk sultan Ahmad Sanjar, but was defeated in Hazarasp and forced to flee. Sanjar installed his nephew Suleiman Shah as ruler of Khwarazm and returned to Merv. Atsïz returned, however, and Suleiman Shah was unable to hold on to the province. Atsïz then attacked Bukhara, but by 1141 he again submitted to Sanjar, who pardoned him and formally returned control of Khwarazm over to him. The same year that Sanjar pardoned Atsïz, the Kara Khitai under Yelü Dashi defeated the Seljuks at Qatwan, near Samarkand.Biran, 44. Atsïz took advantage of the defeat to invade Khorasan, occupying Merv and Nishapur. Yelü Dashi, however, sent a force to plunder Khwarazm, forcing Atsïz to pay an annual tribute.Biran, 44. In 1142, Atsiz was expelled from Khorasan by Sanjar, who invaded Khwarazm in the following year and forced Atsïz back into vassalage, although Atsïz continued to pay tribute to the Kara Khitai until his death.Grousset, Rene, The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia, (Rutgers University Press, 2002), 160. Sanjar undertook another expedition against Atsïz in 1147 when the latter became rebellious again.Grousset, 160. In 1153, Sanjar was defeated and imprisoned by a group of Oghuz tribes, and Khorasan soon descended into anarchy. The portion of the Seljuk army that refused to join the Oghuz proclaimed the former ruler of the Karakhanids, Mahmud Khan, as their leader. Mahmud sought an alliance with Atsïz against the Oghuz, while Atsïz's brother Ïnal-Tegin had already plundered a part of Khorasan in 1154. Atsïz and his son Il-Arslan departed from Khwarazm, but before they could make any gains Sanjar escaped from his captivity and restored his rule.  Death  Atsïz died in 1156, and was succeeded by Il-Arslan.  Evaluation of reign  Atsiz was a flexible politician and ruler, and was able to maneuver between the powerful Sultan Sanjar and equally powerful Yelü Dashi. He continued the land-gathering policy initiated by his predecessors, annexing Jand and Mangyshlak to Khwarazm. Many nomadic tribes were dependent on the Khwarazmshah. Towards the end of his life, Atsiz subordinated the entire northwestern part of Central Asia, and in fact, achieved its independence from the neighbors.Bartold V.V.

Satyendranath Dutta was an expert in many disciplines of intellectual enquiry including medieval Indian history, culture, and mythology. Early life and education Satyendranath Dutta was the son of Rajaninath Dutta, who was a trader. He was born at Nimta, 24 Parganas (north). The family hailed from Chupi in Purba Bardhaman district on 11 February 1882. His grandfather, Akshay Kumar Datta, was a great thinker, Brahmo social reformer and writer who was the guiding spirit of the Tattwabodhini Patrika. After passing the school leaving examination from the Central Collegiate School, he received his graduate level education from the General Assembly’s Institution in Kolkata. Although he left (what is now) Scottish Church College without taking a degree, his training there helped him immensely for the future. After unsuccessfully to join the ranks of his father in their family business, he quit that to devote his energies entirely to scholarly pursuits. He wrote poems like Jatir Pati. Death He died on 25 June 1922, aged 40. Rabindranath Tagore has immortalized Satyendranath in a poem written after his death. Kazi Nazrul Islam also wrote a poem titled 'Sayendranath' eulogizing his death.SMARAKA GRANTHA: Death anniversary of Satyendranath Dutta Observed A street in South Kolkata has been named after him. Works Satyendranath Dutta composed poems and initially composed poems for the Bengali magazine Bharati. Although his stylistic nuances during this stage reflect the influence of Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Akshay Kumar Baral and Debendranath Sen, his later poetry illustrates a greater resonance with the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore. Dutta wrote under multiple pseudonyms, including Nabakumar, Kaviratna, Ashitipar Sharma, Tribikram Varman and Kalamgir. =Books of poems= * Sabita (The Sun, 1900) * Sandhiksan (The Opportune Moment, 1905) * Benu O Bina (Flute and Lyre, 1906) * Hom Shikha (The Blaze of the Yagya, 1907) * Fuler Fasal (The Harvest of Flowers, 1911) * Kuhu O Keka (Song of Cuckoo and Peahen, 1912) * Tulir Likhon (Written with a Brush, 1914) * Abhra-Avir (1916) * Hasantika (1919) * Bela Sheser Gan (Song at Dusk, 1923) * Biday-Arati (Farewell Hymn, 1924) * Kavyasanchayan (Collected Poems, 1930) * Shishu-Kavita (Children's Poetry, 1945) * Bhorai (The song of Dawn) * Tirtha-renu * Tirtha-Salil Other works * Janmaduhkhi (Destined to be sad from Birth - novel, 1912) * Chiner Dhup (Chinese incense - essays, 1912) * Rangamalli (play, 1913) References *Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) in Bengali edited by Subodh Chandra Sengupta and Anjali Bose External links  *Satyendranath Dutta at the West Bengal Public Library Network 1882 births 1922 deaths 19th-century Bengali poets Bengali Hindus Bengali-language poets Bengali writers Bengali-language writers Dutta, Satyendranath Dutta, Satyendranath Dutta, Satyendranath Translators to Bengali 20th-century Indian poets 20th-century Indian translators 20th-century Bengali poets Bengali male poets Indian male poets Poets from West Bengal 19th-century male writers 19th-century Indian translators 20th-century Indian male writers ","title":"Satyendranath Dutta"},{"id":"5788241","text":"Greg Kroah-Hartman (GKH) is a major Linux kernel developer. he is the Linux kernel maintainer for the branch, the staging subsystem, USB, driver core, debugfs, kref, kobject, and the sysfs kernel subsystems, Userspace I/O (with Hans J.

He is the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band Elbow. Early life Garvey grew up in Bury, Lancashire of Irish descent. His father spent most of his working life as a newspaper proofreader, later working as a school assistant and his mother was a police officer before becoming a psychologist. One of seven siblings, Garvey has five older sisters: Gina, Louise, Sam, Karen, and Becky. His younger brother is actor Marcus Garvey. Career In the early 1990s, while at sixth-form college in Whitefield, near Bury, Garvey formed Elbow with Mark and Craig Potter, Pete Turner, and Richard Jupp. He serves as the lyricist of Elbow, and has been widely praised for his songwriting throughout his career. As well as vocal duties Garvey has also played a wide variety of instruments live including both electric and acoustic guitar, trumpet, and various forms of percussion. Elbow won two Ivor Novello awards for best song writing for the 2008 single \\"Grounds for Divorce\\" as well as best contemporary song for \\"One Day Like This\\". He was awarded a lifetime achievement honour by the Radio Academy in 2014. In the same year, he also featured on the re-launched Band Aid charity's single to raise funds for the Ebola crisis in Africa. Garvey, with Elbow, was commissioned by the BBC to write the theme song for the 2012 London Olympics and Elbow performed this song, \\"First Steps\\" at the closing ceremony of the Olympics. Amongst other work, Garvey produced and recorded the I Am Kloot album Natural History (2001). Alongside Elbow keyboard player Craig Potter he also produced I Am Kloot's single \\"Maybe I Should\\" (2005, not associated with any album), their Mercury Music Prize nominated 2010 album Sky at Night and their 2013 album Let It All In. Elbow were themselves Mercury Music Prize nominees, in 2011, for the album Build a Rocket Boys! and won the prize in 2008 for their album \\"The Seldom Seen Kid\\". In addition, Garvey made an appearance on Massive Attack's 2010 album record Heligoland. He is a member of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA). In April 2012 Garvey became a patron of the Manchester Craft and Design Centre. In recognition of his outstanding contribution to music he received, in July of the same year, an honorary doctorate from Manchester Metropolitan University, to become a Doctor of Arts. Garvey has been a presenter on BBC 6 Music since 2007(Sunday afternoon 2 pm to 4 pm, British time) and previously presented a show on Sunday evenings on XFM. He had a monthly column in the now-defunct listings magazine City Life and is a patron of the Mines Advisory Group (MAG), the Manchester-based charity responsible for clearing war zones of mines and munitions worldwide. In 2015, Garvey presented Music Box, an iPlayer-exclusive series covering emerging and established bands. Garvey has also read several children's stories for the CBeebies \\"Bedtime Stories\\" program on the BBC. In 2015, Garvey announced that he would be releasing his first solo studio album while continuing his duties as Elbow's lead songwriter. The resulting album, Courting the Squall, was released on 30 October 2015, by Polydor Records in the UK. On 27 October 2015 Garvey appeared on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland, where he performed \\"Angela's Eyes\\" and \\"Belly of the Whale\\". In April 2017, Garvey appeared in the BBC television sitcom Peter Kay's Car Share, playing Kayleigh's brother-in-law Steve.

At this point, simple physical models that describe wave dynamics often become invalid, particularly those that assume linear behaviour. The most generally familiar sort of breaking wave is the breaking of water surface waves on a coastline. Wave breaking generally occurs where the amplitude reaches the point that the crest of the wave actually overturns—the types of breaking water surface waves are discussed in more detail below. Certain other effects in fluid dynamics have also been termed \\"breaking waves,\\" partly by analogy with water surface waves. In meteorology, atmospheric gravity waves are said to break when the wave produces regions where the potential temperature decreases with height, leading to energy dissipation through convective instability; likewise Rossby waves are said to break when the potential vorticity gradient is overturned. Wave breaking also occurs in plasmas,https://crppwww.epfl.ch/~duval/P5_009.pdf when the particle velocities exceed the wave's phase speed. A reef or spot of shallow water such as a shoal against which waves break may also be known as a breaker. Types Classification of breaking wave types Breaking wave on a slope in a laboratory wave channel (movie) Animation showing how the slope of the seafloor along the coast affects breaking waves Breaking of water surface waves may occur anywhere that the amplitude is sufficient, including in mid-ocean. However, it is particularly common on beaches because wave heights are amplified in the region of shallower water (because the group velocity is lower there). See also waves and shallow water. There are four basic types of breaking water waves. They are spilling, plunging, collapsing, and surging. =Spilling breakers= When the ocean floor has a gradual slope, the wave will steepen until the crest becomes unstable, resulting in turbulent whitewater spilling down the face of the wave. This continues as the wave approaches the shore, and the wave's energy is slowly dissipated in the whitewater. Because of this, spilling waves break for a longer time than other waves, and create a relatively gentle wave. Onshore wind conditions make spillers more likely. =Plunging breakers= A plunging wave occurs when the ocean floor is steep or has sudden depth changes, such as from a reef or sandbar. The crest of the wave becomes much steeper than a spilling wave, becomes vertical, then curls over and drops onto the trough of the wave, releasing most of its energy at once in a relatively violent impact. A plunging wave breaks with more energy than a significantly larger spilling wave. The wave can trap and compress the air under the lip, which creates the \\"crashing\\" sound associated with waves. With large waves, this crash can be felt by beachgoers on land. Offshore wind conditions can make plungers more likely. If a plunging wave is not parallel to the beach (or the ocean floor), the section of the wave which reaches shallow water will break first, and the breaking section (or curl) will move laterally across the face of the wave as the wave continues. This is the \\"tube\\" that is so highly sought after by surfers (also called a \\"barrel\\", a \\"pit\\", and \\"the greenroom\\", among other terms). The surfer tries to stay near or under the crashing lip, often trying to stay as \\"deep\\" in the tube as possible while still being able to shoot forward and exit the barrel before it closes. A plunging wave that is parallel to the beach can break along its whole length at once, rendering it unrideable and dangerous. Surfers refer to these waves as \\"closed out\\". =Collapsing= Collapsing waves are a cross between plunging and surging, in which the crest never fully breaks, yet the bottom face of the wave gets steeper and collapses, resulting in foam. =Surging= Surging breakers originate from long period, low steepness waves and/or steep beach profiles. The outcome is the rapid movement of the base of the wave up the swash slope and the disappearance of the wave crest. The front face and crest of the wave remain relatively smooth with little foam or bubbles, resulting in a very narrow surf zone, or no breaking waves at all. The short, sharp burst of wave energy means that the swash/backwash cycle completes before the arrival of the next wave, leading to a low value of Kemp's phase difference (< 0.5). Surging waves are typical of reflective beach states. On steeper beaches, the energy of the wave can be reflected by the bottom back into the ocean, causing standing waves. Physics During breaking, a deformation (usually a bulge) forms at the wave crest, either leading side of which is known as the \\"toe.\\" Parasitic capillary waves are formed, with short wavelengths. Those above the \\"toe\\" tend to have much longer wavelengths. This theory is anything but perfect, however, as it is linear. There have been a couple non-linear theories of motion (regarding waves). One put forth uses a perturbation method to expand the description all the way to the third order, and better solutions have been found since then. As for wave deformation, methods much like the boundary integral method and the Boussinesq model have been created. It has been found that high-frequency detail present in a breaking wave plays a part in crest deformation and destabilization. The same theory expands on this, stating that the valleys of the capillary waves create a source for vorticity. It is said that surface tension (and viscosity) are significant for waves up to about in wavelength. These models are flawed, however, as they can't take into account what happens to the water after the wave breaks. Post-break eddy forms and the turbulence created via the breaking is mostly unresearched. Understandably, it might be difficult to glean predictable results from the ocean. After the tip of the wave overturns and the jet collapses, it creates a very coherent and defined horizontal vortex. The plunging breakers create secondary eddies down the face of the wave. Small horizontal random eddies that form on the sides of the wave suggest that, perhaps, prior to breaking, the water's velocity is more or less two dimensional. This becomes three dimensional upon breaking. The main vortex along the front of the wave diffuses rapidly into the interior of the wave after breaking, as the eddies on the surface become more viscous. Advection and molecular diffusion play a part in stretching the vortex and redistributing the vorticity, as well as the formation turbulence cascades. The energy of the large vortices are, by this method, transferred to much smaller isotropic vortices. Experiments have been conducted to deduce the evolution of turbulence after break, both in deep water and on a beach.

Also at Oxford Art Online (subscription required). Robert de Cotte (1656 - 15 July 1735) was a French architect- administrator, under whose design control of the royal buildings of France from 1699, the earliest notes presaging the Rococo style were introduced. First a pupil of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, he later became his brother-in-law and his collaborator.De Cotte married Hardouin-Mansart's sister before 1683 (Kimball). After Hardouin-Mansart's death, de Cotte completed his unfinished projects, notably the royal chapel at Versailles and the Grand Trianon. Biography Born in Paris, Robert de Cotte began his career as a contractor for masonry, working on important royal projects between 1682 and 1685, when he was made a member of the Académie royale d'architecture and architect of the Court, ranking third in importance after Mansart's seldom-credited assistant François Dorbay (Kimball, p 36f). On his return to France after a six-month sojourn in Italy (1689–1690), in the company of Jacques Gabriel,A journal of dry annotations and a collection of architectural drawings by various hands at the Bibliothèque Nationale are mentioned by Kimball. he became the director of the Manufacture des Gobelins, where not only the famous tapestries, but also royal furnishings were produced; even designs made under his direction for wrought iron balustrading are to be found among the eight volumes of drawings for the Gobelins, and for other public and private commissions, conserved at the Cabinet des Estampes, Bibliothèque Nationale.They were inherited by his heirs, who donated them to the collection. In 1699, when Mansart was made Surintendant des Bâtiments, a position otherwise invariably reserved for a noble layman, de Cotte became his second-in-command in an executive function, charged with overseeing all the files of drawings, the stocks of marble and other materials including those for the royal manufactures of the Gobelins and Savonnerie, with overseeing the bidding process with contractors and with liaison with the Académie, of which he was made a member that same year. Fiske Kimball, the chronicler of the Rococo, notes that there are no surviving drawings by de Cotte from this period, nor from the period after Mansart's death in May 1708 (Kimball pp 61, 78). From 1708, Robert de Cotte was Premier architecte du Roi and director of the Académie royale d'architecture. He was in charge of the Bâtiments du Roi, which had been organized by Hardouin-Mansart into the prototype of all modern architectural offices, where the roles of director, comptroller, inspector, architect and draftsman were specialized, and the personalities involved submerged under the aegis of the Premier Architecte (Kimball, p. 8). The last years of Louis XIV are not on the whole periods of intense activity at Versailles, where the single great enterprise, already in progress at de Cotte's accession, was the Chapel, completed in 1710; there the decorative designs were actually the work of Pierre Lepautre, whom Fiske Kimball characterized as the \\"father of the Rococo\\".\\"By the variety of work at the same moment under Mansart and De Cotte, by the changes in style when their designers changed, we know that the creative responsibility was not theirs. The true creative artist, as in other periods of fertile originality, was the designer who held the pencil.\\" (Kimball, p 89) De Cotte, with ever-widening responsibilities at Court, was also occupied with projects in Paris. His name is inscribed on the first draft for the final project for Place Vendôme (1699).\\"Place Louis le Grand, suivant l'idée de Mr. de Cotte\\" is inscribed on the drawing in the Cabinet des Estampes. De Cotte was responsible for the Hôtel de PontchartrainUn ministère dans la ville [HÔTEL de LIONNE- PONTCHARTRAIN] (Chancellerie, 1703); his team was busy building hôtels particuliers in Paris, notably the Hôtel de Lude (1710, demolished), the Hôtel d'Estrées in rue de Grenelle (1713, remodelled); surviving drawings for interiors are in the hand of Pierre Lepautre. De Cotte was in charge of the team that remodelled François Mansart's Hôtel de Vrillière in 1714-1715 for Louis XIV's legitimated son, the comte de Toulouse; the outstanding features were the grand staircase, in which several sculptors collaborated, and the Gallery (1718–1719), upon which de Cotte's reputation has rested, and which survives. Mariette attributed its design to François-Antoine Vassé,La galerie dorée and Fiske Kimball, on the basis of surviving preparatory drawings, concurred (Kimball, pp 117–8). With the Régence during the minority of Louis XV, coinciding with de Cotte's maturity, the artistic lead in France passed smoothly in 1715 from the Bâtiments du Roi to the work being done by Gilles- Marie Oppenord for the Regent, Philippe, duc d'Orléans, at the Palais Royal in Paris. No new architects were added to the rolls of the Bâtiments du Roi. De Cotte, one of Europe's most prominently-placed architects, served by a rigorously-trained staff, was free to accept private commissions, assisted during his later years by his son Jules-Robert de Cotte (1683–1767). Balthasar Neumann, in Paris to consult him over the building operations at Würzburg, found him and his son grandly occupied.Kimball quotes Neumann's letters (Kimball p126). At this period, de Cotte was responsible for the Hôtel de Conti, rue de Bourbon (1716–19, acquired by the duc du Maine; demolished) and the Hôtel de Bourvallais, Place Vendôme,Ministère de la Justice - Portail now the Ministry of Justice.In 1715, Bourvallais was imprisoned in the Bastille for embezzlement of royal funds. He was freed after two years but had to abandon his private hotel to the king. In 1718, the Conseil du Roi attributed it to the Chancellerie de France. Outside France, de Cotte's team was commissioned for projects to be completed on site by local craftsmen. In Bonn, his team was extensively employed by the Elector of Cologne, for the design of his rural Poppelsdorf Palace (from 1715) and interior remodeling (1716–1717) of his urban Electoral Palace. The decoration of the Cabinet des Glâces in the latter palace followed designs by Oppenord that featured reverse curves and garlands applied to mirror surfaces, a new feature. A new wing called the Buen Retiro was commissioned in the autumn of 1717.Kimball 1964, pp. 126–127. From newly-Bourbon Spain, the princesse des Ursins required his advice on the remodeling of her Château de Chanteloup near Amboise (Neuman, p. 229, note 4) and the queen's apartments of the royal palace in Madrid. An octagonal room was fabricated in Paris under de Cotte's eye, 1713–1715, and sent to be installed in Madrid. At La Granja, an assistant from de Cotte's office, René Carlier, was employed in the designs for the parterres (Kimball, p 124). For the cardinal de Rohan, de Cotte provided decors for the Château de Saverne in Alsace (1721–1722; destroyed by fire). With the death of Lepautre in 1716, de Cotte turned for the invention of ornaments to the sculptor François-Antoine Vassé, \\"responsible for all that is of creative significance in De Cotte's later works, as Lepautre had been in the previous period\\" (Kimball p 115). He died in Passy (now part of Paris).

During his tenure as Army Minister, the Kwangtung Army staged the Huanggutun incident as assassinate Fengtian warlord Zhang Zuolin in June 1928. Prime Minister Tanaka reported to Emperor Hirohito that the incident had been staged by rogue junior officers within the Imperial Japanese Army without orders from Tokyo and demanded that the perpetrators be punished. While Shirakawa's role in the bombing remains uncertain, he refused to punish the perpetrators and instead transferred them to other posts to avoid a court martial. With tensions in China rapidly ramping up towards open war, with the Shanghai Incident starting in January 1932, Shirakawa was dispatched to China on February 25, 1932, to become commander of the Shanghai Expeditionary Army. He was under direct orders from Emperor Hirohito to bring the situation to a close. Shirakawa issued a cease-fire order on March 3 over the strong objections of his commanders and greatly angering The Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. However, the emperor was pleased, and the League of Nations General Assembly, which was poised to issue a strong condemnation of Japan, remained silent.

He died at the age of 24, leaving a well regarded body of work produced over a mature career of only three years.Britannica online Encyclopaedia, Bulgarian literature.A history of Bulgarian literature 865-1944, Charles A. Moser, Mouton, 1972, pp. 223-226. Early life He was born Hristo Izmirliev, in 1898, in Kukush in Macedonia (today Kilkis, Greece), which had militant traditions and an enterprising population. According to Tushe Daliivanov, a close relative and fellow writer, Hristo was from a poor family; Hristo's father, Dimitar Izmirliev, was an important and admired man in Kukush before political disagreements with the Greek authorities over his socialist views resulted in his imprisonment. On October 8, 1912, when Smirnenski was 14 years old, the First Balkan War started, and Bulgarian troops left Kukush. After the victory of the Balkan allies, disagreements arose and the Second Balkan War broke out. After invading, Greek troops burned Kukush; and the Izmirliev family, with thousands of other refugees, went to Sofia. Despite the poverty in which Dimitar Izmirliev and his wife found themselves, they made sure that their children studied. Hristo attended a technical school and his younger brother Anastas helped the family by selling newspapers. Hristo Smirnenski made his literary debut in 1915 during his second year at college, in the satirical newspaper K'vo da e (Anything Goes). He first called himself \\"Smirnenski\\" in the magazine Smyah i salzi (Laughter and Tears). Despite his youth, Hirsto soon became one of the most sought after and popular writers of that time. In 1917, he first used the pseudonym Smirnenski. As a student in a technical school, he continued to work in a colonial shop. During this time, the First World War started. In May 1917, Hristo enrolled as a cadet at the Military School, and from his barracks continued to write daily and publish humorous publications. At the end of 1917, the October Revolution broke out. A school-wide quarantine was imposed in order to keep students from being influenced by communist ideas. In April 1918, Hristo released his first collection of poems, Raznokalibreni vazdishki v stihove i proza (Sighs of Various Sizes, in Verse and Prose). The collection was of a humorous nature; it was later criticized by the author himself. In 1918, the Soldiers' Revolt against King Ferdinand made a strong impact on his conceptual development. Smirnenski witnessed the bloodiest clash near Sugar Factory, in Sofia. Horrified by the cruelty with which the government defeated the rebels, he left the Military School in November; and his father was forced to pay compensation. Adult years After entering civic life, Smirnenski became a member of the editorial board of Bulgarin, a popular newspaper, but made his living as a clerk, reporter, treasurer, editor, and proofreader. The period from 1919 to 1920 was a turbulent one in Sofia. In November 1919, Smirnenski was published in the Communist Party's weekly literary magazine Red Laughter. Smirnenski's humor had become more socially inclusive. He participated in demonstrations and rallies for causes such as requesting amnesty for convicted soldiers, and improving the material condition of workers. Gradually, his social affiliation became a crucial factor in his ideological views and he became a fighter for the proletariat. In the spring of 1920, he became a member of the Communist Youth League, and in 1921, the Bulgarian Communist Party. 1920 was a turning point in Smirnenski's creative path. The communists saw his earlier creative pursuits as manifestations of the \\"decadent\\" symbolism of poetic achievements. According to socialist literary criticism, his first real poem was \\"The First of May\\", which was published in the May Day issue of Red Laughter. Smirnenski published a series of poems in the pages of Red Laughter: \\"Nee\\" (June 26, 1920), \\"Red Squads\\" (September 3, 1920), \\"The Street\\" and \\"Tomorrow\\" (September 24, 1920), \\"Herald of the New Day\\" (October 15, 1920), \\"Northern Lights\\" (October 29, 1920), \\"In the Storm\\" (January 6, 1921), \\"The Tempest in Berlin\\" (January 13, 1921), \\"Johan\\" (January 27 1921), and others. A few dozen of his works, representing his new aesthetic outlook, were published in Red Laughter and the party publication Workers' Newspaper. At the end of February 1922, the party publisher, the General Workers Cooperative Society \\"Liberation\\", printed the second and final poetry collection published during Smirnenski's lifetime - To be the Day!. The first printing of 1,500 copies sold out quickly. A few months later cooperative \\"Liberation\\" issued a second edition. Through this work, Smirnenski rose to be known as a talented poet with bright and well-demarcated individuality - an artist whose work was socially engaged, who was seen as a model for a new social and aesthetic class, and whose work a model of Bulgarian literature in the second decade of the 20th century. With the new book, Smirnenski went beyond mere political and ideological commitment and showed a selfless and fervently humanity, the dream of happiness of mankind, in his creative philosophy. Here was Smirnenski at his most vivid. With his works, Smirnenski inspired millions of people to rise up against social injustice. With unique lyrical style, Smirnenski sings longing for happiness and everlasting love to the people, philosophically summarized in \\"Herald of the New Day\\" - \\"What a divine happiness it is to be human\\". Death Smirenski's tireless work and deprivations undermined the 24-year-old poet's health and he died on June 18, 1923, from tuberculosis. He had followed political events and kept his faith, optimism, and sense of humor right until his last breath. Legacy Despite his early death, Smirnenski is known as a very productive writer. In the eight brief years of his prolific career, he wrote thousands of pieces of poetry and prose in various genres using more than 70 pseudonyms. One of the last editions of his collected works consists of eight volumes. He was lauded by left-leaning literary critics for championing socialist ideals in his works, and by certain of the modern conservative literary circles as the author of \\"Applied Poetry\\". Smirnenski was a remarkable poet: his poetry is energetic and his lyrics have a confessional character. His extraordinary humor and faith in life, along with his humanism are recreated in the finest form in his works. The most characteristic of them evoke a solemn and festive feeling of the need for change in the world, the bitterness of harsh realities, and a willingness to fight for change. His works are still relevant today and are the subject of public debate (e.g. \\"Tale of the Ladder\\") and online searches of literary criticism. Despite being underrated, he is an inspiration to millions and deserves to be honored as one. Smirnenski Point on Robert Island, South Shetland Islands, is named after Hristo Smirnenski.

His final game for the Stags came in 1985. It was no surprise that he moved on in the summer, joining Chesterfield for a fee of £12,000 after scoring 57 goals in 157 league games for the Stags. He scored 17 times in 68 league games for Chesterfield before moving to Torquay United for £7,000 in November 1987. He scored with an overhead kick on his home debut against Hereford United after a headed pass from Gary Wright, and although sent off 3 more times that season (for which he received an 8 match ban) his ability to lead the attack made him an unlikely favourite of the crowd as Torquay made the play-offs and got further than usual in the cup competitions. In August 1988 he left Plainmoor for Belgian side KVV Overpelt (costing £13,000) after 24 league games for the Gulls, scoring 4 times, but returned to Torquay on loan in December 1989. Following a spell playing in South Africa, in October 1990 he returned to Chesterfield, with a fee of £14,500 resembling a reasonable piece of business by the Belgian side. He played a further 32 league games, scoring 4 times for Chesterfield before a cartilage injury forced him to retire from league football. On leaving Chesterfield in May 1992, he returned to the Highland League to play for Inverness Caledonian FC until 1994 when he moved to the Aberdeen Highland League Club, Cove Rangers F.C. Whilst playing for Cove Rangers he began working as a sales executive for an office equipment business. He continued this job, combining it with a part-time role as manager of Highland League club Lossiemouth F.C. between 1998 and 1999. Whilst his football management was successful, at the end of the season he was offered a job as group sales manager for Xerox Concessionaire in Edinburgh, which he took, leaving football behind him. Now living in Glasgow, alongside coaching another side, Caldwell has made two substitute appearances for Cardonald AC, scoring the winning goal in his most recent outing.

Located approximately 80 km to the southwest of Munich in Nazi Germany, the camps were named \\"Riederloh\\" and \\"Riederloh II\\" respectively. Riederloh \\"Riederloh\\" was a residence camp which was directly run by the DAG. It existed from 1939 to 1945 at the South end of the DAG site. Camp Riederloh hosted German laborers during construction (1939–1941), as well as Germans and non-German forced laborers, mainly from Poland and the USSR, as well as Italian military detainees (1941-1945). Riederloh II \\"Riederloh II\\" was a sub-camp of Dachau concentration camp and, therefore, run by the SS. It existed from 1944 to 1945 at approximately 2 km to the East of the DAG site. Camp Riederloh II was a work camp where 472—this number is usually reported in literature—among the approx. 1,000 Jewish inmates (mainly from Poland and Hungary, brought to Kaufbeuren from Auschwitz after having passed selection) died by malnutrition and physical infirmity, as well as extremely brutal behaviour of SS guards, between fall 1944 and January 1945. The surviving inmates where marched to Dachau in 1945, put under quarantine, fed to make them fit for labor again and then taken to other sub-camps of Dachau. Meanwhile the baracks of Riederloh II were reassigned to Ukrainian forced laborers. After 1945 On the sites of the DAG facilities and the Riederloh camp, after 1946 the German nationals (often referred to as Sudeten Germans) expelled from Jablonec in Czechoslovakia were settled; their settlement grew into a large quarter of Kaufbeuren and was named Neugablonz later. Other Czech Germans were settled on and around the site of Riederloh II, their (smaller) settlement evolving into what is today Steinholz, a detached settlement of the village of Mauerstetten. Therefore, sometimes Riederloh II is referred to with the unofficial name of concentration camp Mauerstetten-Steinholz. Memorials At Mauerstetten there is a cemetery with a memorial stone recalling the death of the 472 Jewish victims at Riederloh II. Victims of labor accidents of laborers from the barracks of camp Riederloh are remembered on a memorial stone in the Roman Catholic Church in Neugablonz. Mentally ill laborers of camp Riederloh, or people suffering from nervous breakdowns, were brought to the nearby facility at Kaufbeuren-Irsee if they wouldn't recover within 4 weeks time.

The reader is made to enjoy the obverse side of personalities usually regarded with unmitigated solemnity. One smiles like an accomplice in their doubts, slippings and tergiversations.

In 2015, University lecturer in literary Dr Marco Galea wrote that the Maltese novel is dominated by Frans Sammut and two others: :In the case of fiction, the situation is not so straightforward. Immanuel Mifsud, together with the younger Clare Azzopardi, Pierre J. Meilak and Walid Nabhan, have produced ground-breaking works of short fiction, but have so far shied away from tackling the novel. Offerings from other writers in this genre have been few and far between. The upshot is a curious situation where contemporary prose writing in Maltese is dominated by the short form, while the novel continues to be dominated by figures such as Frans Sammut (another member of the Moviment, who died in 2011), Alfred Sant and Trevor Żahra.https://inizjamedmalta.wordpress.com/maltese-literature/ The Local Council of Haz-Zebbug praises Frans Sammut as \\"international author\\" Critical Acclaim Marie Benoit The Malta Independent 05.05.2011: What always struck me about Frans is his lack of intellectual pretension.

The complex is located in the vicinity of One Court Square in Hunters Point and Long Island City, Queens, and is served by the 7, E, and G trains at all times; the M train on weekdays; and the <7> express train during weekdays in the peak direction. The complex comprises three originally separate stations, formerly known as 23rd Street–Ely Avenue (Queens Boulevard Line), Long Island City–Court Square (Crosstown Line), and 45th Road–Court House Square (Flushing Line). The Flushing Line station was the first to open, in 1916. The Crosstown Line station opened in 1933, followed by the Queens Boulevard Line station in 1939. Two passageways were built to connect the three stations. The first was built in 1990, following the opening of the Citigroup office tower at One Court Square. In December 2001, this passageway came into greater use when G trains started to terminate at Court Square. A second passageway was completed between the Crosstown and Flushing Line stations in 2011. The Crosstown and Flushing Line stations were renamed \\"Court Square\\" with the latter being made fully ADA-accessible. The Queens Boulevard Line station, which is not ADA- compliant, was renamed \\"Court Square–23rd Street\\". History The station complex is located in Long Island City, in western Queens. The first station to open was 45th Road–Court House Square on November 5, 1916, built as part of a two-stop extension of the future IRT Flushing Line from Hunters Point Avenue to Queensboro Plaza. This part of the Flushing Line, in turn, was built under the Dual Contracts, under which the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company would construct and operate lines as part of a unified subway system. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the city-owned Independent Subway System (IND) constructed the first sections of the Crosstown and Queens Boulevard Lines; the Court Square Crosstown Line station was the first Queens station of either line to be built, with its structure having been completed in July 1930 and the tilework and equipment installed afterward. On August 19, 1933, the IND opened the Court Square station as part of the first leg of the IND Crosstown Line. The IND Queens Boulevard Line between Manhattan and Roosevelt Avenue opened that same day, with trains (predecessor to today's G service) operating between Queens Plaza and Nassau Avenue in Brooklyn. The 23rd Street–Ely Avenue station had been partially built in the early 1930s, but was not completed until August 28, 1939, with trains serving the station. = Connections created = Citicorp In 1984, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) planned to construct a transfer passageway between the Queens Boulevard and Crosstown Line stations as part of a planned connector between the Queens Boulevard Line and the IND 63rd Street Line. Around 1986, Citigroup (then Citicorp) agreed to fund the passageway, at a cost of $8.5 million, as part of a zoning requirement for the construction of the adjacent One Court Square tower, which was being built to allow Citicorp to split its operations between several different buildings. Two of these buildings, Citigroup Center and 399 Park Avenue, were located near the Lexington Avenue–53rd Street station, the next stop southbound on the Queens Boulevard Line. However, that stop was located in Manhattan, across the East River from Queens. The company selected the Court Square site due to its proximity to the Queens Boulevard subway. The building opened in 1989, with the passageway completed later on. In 2000, the MTA began designing a second in-system passageway between the Flushing and Crosstown line stations. On December 16, 2001, the 63rd Street Line connector was opened and service on the Queens Boulevard Line was increased, requiring G trains to terminate at Court Square on weekdays. To compensate Crosstown riders going into Queens, a free out-of-system transfer to the Flushing Line station was created. In October 2005, Citigroup announced they would be funding the passageway between the Flushing and Crosstown line stations, as a zoning requirement for the construction of the Court Square Two building. On March 17, 2011, the Queens Boulevard station was renamed to \\"Court Square–23rd Street\\". On June 3, 2011, the $47 million ADA-accessible connection between the Crosstown Line and Flushing Line stations was opened and the two stations were renamed \\"Court Square\\". Most of the project was funded by Citigroup, but $13.9 million was covered by the MTA. The Flushing Line station was closed from January 21, 2012 to April 2, 2012 to complete further renovations, including platform upgrades and alterations to the station's mezzanine to make the station fully ADA- compliant. Station layout  The station complex consists of three formerly separate stations along the IND Queens Boulevard Line, IND Crosstown Line, and IRT Flushing Line. There are several entrances to the complex, with two passageways within fare control connecting the stations. = Crosstown–Queens Boulevard Lines transfer passageway = The northernmost passageway, which is long, connects the eastern end of the Queens Boulevard Line station, at 44th Drive east of 23rd Street, with the north end of the Crosstown Line station at Jackson Avenue and 45th Avenue. This passageway was originally planned in the 1980s to compensate for the planned reroute of the G service away from the Queens Boulevard line when the track connection from the Queens Boulevard Line to the 63rd Street Line was completed (which ultimately occurred in 2001). It was constructed in the 1990s after Citigroup opened its office tower at One Court Square. The main fare control area has a skylight and the passageway formerly contained the only moving walkway in the subway system, which moved passengers from the Crosstown and Flushing Lines' platforms to the Queens Boulevard Line's platforms. These were installed in December 2001 when the G began terminating at this station complex on weekdays. However, the moving walkway was found to have limited benefits: it saved commuters an average of 9 seconds; was often out of service; and could only operate in one direction toward the Queens Boulevard Line platforms. As a result, in 2016, it was announced the moving walkway would be removed in summer 2018 to provide additional capacity in the passageway. This was in anticipation of the Canarsie Tunnel shutdown in 2019, which would displace many passengers who usually travel across the East River via the BMT Canarsie Line (), since the section of the tunnel under the East River would be closed for renovations. The walkways were removed starting in June 2018. The passageway is split into two sections, and between these two sections is the full-time fare control area for the complex that has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases. One has two escalators and goes up to south side of 44th Drive inside a Citibank location next to the tower, and the other is open weekdays only and leads to the entrance plaza of One Court Square. A set of escalators opposite the street stairs lead to the building's lobby. Lining the walls of this passageway is Stream, a glass mosaic mural by Elizabeth Murray. This is one of two murals Murray made for MTA Arts & Design; the other, Blooming, can be found at Lexington Avenue/59th Street. = Flushing–Crosstown Lines transfer passageway = The second passageway, opened in June 2011, consists of two escalators, one elevator, and one staircase within a glass-enclosed structure that connects the underground Crosstown Line station and the elevated Flushing Line station at 45th Road. Between 2001 and 2011, this was a free out-of-system transfer that could be made using MetroCards. While the elevators make both passageways ADA-accessible, only the IRT Flushing Line platforms are fully ADA-accessible with elevators to platform level. Starting in 2020, one of the stairs to the IND Crosstown Line platform will be demolished and replaced with an elevator. In December 2019, the MTA announced that the IND Queens Boulevard Line station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020–2024 Capital Program. In addition, there is no direct connection between the Flushing and Queens Boulevard platforms. IRT Flushing Line platforms Court Square is an elevated station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway. There are two side platforms and two tracks at the station. The station opened on November 5, 1916 as 45th Road–Court House Square as part of an extension of the Flushing Line two stops to the west to Queensboro Plaza. The platforms at 45th Road were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. In 2005, this station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The current platforms were installed in the 2012 renovations. They are composed of numerous panels of composite fiberglass resin, lighter than conventional concrete and designed to resist corrosion and thermal expansion. The platform edges are equipped with ADA-compliant tactile strips. Both platforms have beige windscreens that run along their entire lengths and brown canopies with green frames and support columns except for a small section at their north ends. Small sections of the windscreens are mesh, allowing a view into the local area. = Exits = This station has an elevated station house beneath the tracks at the extreme south end. A single staircase from each platform goes down to a combined waiting area and crossunder, where a turnstile bank provides entrance and exit from the station. Near these staircases, one elevator leads from each platform to the mezzanine. Outside fare control, there is a token booth; an elevator and two staircases go down to the northwestern corner of 45th Road and 23rd Street. Two escalators and a staircase, located within an enclosed structure, lead directly to the complex's underground mezzanine area via a new transfer passageway. The northbound platform's elevator also leads to the underground mezzanine within fare control, stopping at the station house level but bypassing the street along the way. The southbound platform's elevator only connects that platform to the station house. A single staircase also leads to the southwestern corner of 45th Road and 23rd Street. It is signposted as serving only the Flushing Line station, as opposed to all three stations of the complex. The station house formerly had two more staircases leading to either eastern corner, as well as another staircase to the northwestern corner. In June 2011, they were replaced by the in-system transfer to the underground platforms, which added a new staircase to the former southeast corner of the intersection. As part of the project, a short strip of 45th Road between 23rd Street and Jackson Avenue was de-mapped, while the adjacent Albert Short Triangle was renovated. In the early 20th century, there were requests for an additional entrance from 23rd Street at the north end of the station, but this was never constructed. =Gallery= File:NYCSub 7 45th St Court House Sq platform.jpgManhattan-bound platform before renovation, looking south File:Court square platform.jpgCovered section of new platform at Court Square File:Court Square Rehabilitated IRT Flushing Platform (7039769399).jpgOutdoor section of new platform File:NYCSub 7 Court House Sq 2.jpgStation entrance in 2005, prior to the construction of the direct connection to the IND complex IND Queens Boulevard Line platforms Court Square–23rd Street on the IND Queens Boulevard Line is an underground station with two tracks and two side platforms. It is located along 44th Drive between 21st and 23rd Streets and is the westernmost station on the line in Queens. Going by railroad directions, Court Square–23rd Street is the Queens Boulevard Line's southernmost station in Queens. Each platform has a scarlet lake trim line with a black border and name tablets reading \\"23RD ST. – ELY AVE.\\" in white sans serif letting on a black and brown background and matching scarlet lake border. Below the trim line and name tablets are small directional signs and station signs alternating between \\"23RD\\" and \\"ELY\\" in white lettering on a black border. Red I-beam columns run along both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate in white lettering. The station, provisionally called \\"21st Street/Van Alst Avenue,\\" was constructed between 1931 and 1933 along with the original section of the line east to Roosevelt Avenue. Although the station had been completed, it was not opened alongside the rest of the line due to lack of demand perceived by the city Board of Transportation, which called the station a \\"dead\\" station. This was in spite of protests from local civic and industry leaders, due to the numerous factories in the surrounding area. By December 1933, the station was referred to as \\"Ely Avenue\\", likely to avoid confusion with the nearby station on the Crosstown Line. In September 1936, it was decided to complete the station as an in-fill station due to expanding commercial and industrial operations in the area, with tilework, staircases, and other equipment installed. The station was finished by 1938, but its opening was delayed once again due to alleged lack of demand, with calls to open the station to serve the Long Island City Courthouse, St. John's Hospital (now the site of One Court Square), and the newly opened Queensbridge Houses. The station finally opened as 23rd Street–Ely Avenue on August 28, 1939, six years after the first section of the Queens Boulevard Line and the opening of Court Square station on the Crosstown line. Ely Avenue was the former name of 23rd StreetStreet Name Changes in Queens, New York until many named streets in the borough were given numbers by the Queens Topographical Bureau in 1915. Similarly, Van Alst Avenue is now 21st Street, while the former Nott Avenue is the present-day 44th Drive. There are four ceramic mosaic/relief murals on the two platforms and connecting mezzanines, made by Frank Olt in 1992. Each one has an individual title according to nearby plaques, but collectively they are the Temple Quad Reliefs. = Exits = This station has three entrances and exits; the full-time one is at the extreme geographical east end. A single staircase from each platform leads up to a crossover. Formerly, on the Manhattan-bound side, one exit-only turnstile and one full-height turnstile led from the crossover to a single staircase that went up to the northeast corner of 44th Drive and 23rd Street. The long passageway to the IND Crosstown Line platform extends to the south, past the crossover. Prior to the construction of the passageway, this exit contained a full-time token booth and staircases to both sides of 44th Drive. There are plans to add a new entrance to the crossover as part of the construction of the Skyline Tower at the northeast corner of this intersection, which will replace the former HEET entrance. This station's second fare control area is at the station's extreme western end. A single staircase from each platform goes up to a raised crossover split in two by a steel fence. The Manhattan-bound side has a turnstile bank, token booth, and one staircase going up to the northeast corner of 21st Street and 44th Drive while the Queens-bound side has two exit-only turnstiles and one staircase going up to the southeast corner of that same intersection. All fare control areas have their original IND-style directional mosaics. =Gallery= File:23rd-Ely Station by David Shankbone.jpgThe Manhattan-bound platform as it looked when the station was known as \\"23rd Street – Ely Avenue\\". File:Court Sq 23 Ely WB platform jeh.jpgThe Manhattan-bound platform with updated Helvetica signs and \\"Ely\\" mosaics. IND Crosstown Line platform Court Square, previously called Long Island City−Court Square, is the northernmost station on the IND Crosstown Line and the northern terminal for G trains at all times. Although G service terminates here, the tracks themselves continue north and merge with the 60th Street Tunnel Connection to form the IND Queens Boulevard Line's local tracks just south of Queens Plaza. This section of the tracks are not used in regular service, though until April 19, 2010, trains traveled over this connection to continue to Forest Hills–71st Avenue at various times of the day. Just south of the station, the two tracks split into three, then merge again into two tracks. The third track is used to switch trains between track directions. This underground station, opened on August 19, 1933, has one island platform between two tracks. Each track wall has a green trim line with a black border and small \\"COURT SQ\\" signs below it in white lettering on black background. Green I-beam columns run along both sides of the platform at regular intervals. Two staircases between the platform and the mezzanine are being widened and two new staircases are being added to provide additional capacity. After 2020, when construction on the Canarsie tubes is completed, one of the new staircases will be replaced by an elevator, which would make the platform ADA-accessible. The project is funded as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program. The elevator project was originally expected to begin in 2018. = Exits = Three staircases from the platform go up to the full length mezzanine above and a passageway within fare control connects the station to the Queens Boulevard platform. All fare control areas are unstaffed, containing just full height turnstiles. The main fare control area has a single staircase that goes up to the southwest corner of Jackson Avenue and Court Square West, and a staircase to the north side of Jackson Avenue at Thompson Avenue in front of One Court Square. There was previously a street stair to the southeast corner of Court Square West and Jackson Avenue and another to the southwest corner of Pearson Street and Jackson Avenue; the latter is currently used as employee space. After the IND 63rd Street Line was connected to the Queens Boulevard Line in December 2001, during a project known as the \\"63rd Street Connector\\", another unstaffed entrance was added to the south end of the mezzanine at 45th Road. This was done to allow an out-of- system transfer to the IRT Flushing Line. From this fare control area, a single staircase goes up to the north side of Jackson Avenue at Pearson Street directly outside the staircases to the IRT station. A second staircase to the southwest corner of the intersection no longer exists. In June 2011, this transfer was replaced by an enclosed in-system transfer that consists of two escalators, one elevator, and one staircase connecting both stations. =Gallery= File:R68 (G) train at Court Square.jpgAn R68 G train on the Crosstown Line tracks.

Nearby points of interest  The P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center (MoMA PS1) is nearby at 46th and Jackson Avenues. The One Court Square building, owned by Citicorp, sits right above the station as well. Queens County Criminal Court is directly on Court Square, just east of Jackson Avenue. The site of the 5 Pointz building at Jackson Avenue and Davis Street, which was famously covered in graffiti until its demolition in 2014, is visible just south of the Flushing Line station and can be seen by passing trains. In addition, the station sits in the center of the Hunters Point Historic District, and as a result, many historic buildings can be found near the stations. However, the area right around the station is also seeing a revitalization, with high-rise condominiums and rental buildings being built in the area, and upscale restaurants being built near the train station. In addition, there is a bourgeoning art community due to the presence of MoMA PS1 and 5 Pointz. There is also a supermarket proposed for the area.

Sean Connery stars as the Franciscan friarIncorrectly described as a monk in the movie. William of Baskerville, called upon to solve a deadly mystery in a medieval abbey, and Christian Slater is his apprentice Adso of Melk. Plot Adso of Melk recounts how, in 1327, as a young Franciscan novice (a Benedictine one in the novel), he and his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville, traveled to a Benedictine abbey in northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The monk Adelmo of Otranto —a young but famous manuscript illuminator— was suspiciously found dead on a hillside below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. The abbot seeks help from William, who is renowned for his deductive powers. William is reluctantly drawn in by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also worries the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William quickly deduces that Adelmo committed suicide, having jumped from a nearby tower having a window, and that the slope of the hill caused the body to roll below the other tower. William's solution briefly allays the monks' fears, until another Monk is found dead, ominously floating in a vat of pig's blood. The victim is Venantius, a translator of Greek and the last man to speak with Adelmo. The corpse bears black stains on a finger and the tongue. The translator's death rekindles the monks' fears of a supernatural culprit, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan friar Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation. In the scriptorium, William inspects Adelmo's desk, but is blocked by Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. Brother Malachia, the head librarian, denies William access to the rest of the building. William encounters Salvatore, a demented hunchback, and his protector, Remigio da Varagine, the cellarer. William deduces that both were Dulcinites, members of a heretical, militant sect that believes that clergy should be impoverished. William does not suspect them of murder though because Dulcinites target wealthy bishops, not poor monks. Nevertheless, Remigio's past gives William leverage in learning the abbey's secrets. Salvatore tells William that Adelmo had crossed paths with Venantius on the night that Adelmo died. Meanwhile, Adso encounters a beautiful, semi-feral, peasant girl who has sneaked into the abbey to trade sexual favours for food, and is seduced by her. Returning that night to Venantius's desk, William finds a book in Greek, and a parchment with Greek writing, smudges of a color blended by Adelmo for illuminating books, and cryptic symbols written by a left-handed man using invisible ink. Berengar sneaks into the darkened scriptorium, distracts William and steals the book. Berengar is later found drowned in a bath and bearing stains similar to those on Venantius. William narrates his conclusions that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide, due to giving in to Berengar's requests for homosexual favors. Venantius received a parchment from Adelmo before Adelmo's death, and Berengar is the only left-handed man in the abbey. William theorizes that the translator transcribed the Greek notes on the parchment from a book, and that the book is somehow responsible for the deaths. The abbot is unconvinced and, burning the parchment, he informs William that the Inquisition — in the person of Bernardo Gui, an old adversary of William — has already been summoned. Determined to solve the mystery before Gui arrives, William and Adso discover a vast, hidden library above the scriptorium. William suspects the abbey hid the books because much of their contents comes from pagan philosophers. Gui finds Salvatore and the peasant girl fighting over a black cockerel while in the presence of a black cat. For Gui, this is irrefutable proof of witchcraft, and he tortures Salvatore into a false confession. Privately, William reveals his past connection to Gui, and his own past as an inquisitor to Adso. Years earlier, Bernardo Gui demanded that William condemn a man whose sole crime was translating a Greek book that conflicted with the scriptures. Ultimately, Gui had William imprisoned and tortured to change his verdict, with the translator being burned at the stake. As both William's Franciscan brothers and the papal delegates arrive, the debate begins. Soon, the abbey's herbalist finds a book written in Greek in his dispensary, and is overheard telling this to William. The herbalist returns to his dispensary, only to be murdered by a hooded figure. Shortly afterward, Malachia warns Remigio to escape, as Salvatore has revealed their Dulcinite history. After Remigio attempts to escape, Malachia wipes blood from his own shoes, revealing that it was he who murdered the herbalist. Before Remigio can escape the abbey, he is caught by Bernardo Gui's guards. Learning of Remigio's Dulcinite past, Gui arrests him for the murders, and brings Remigio, Salvatore and the girl before a tribunal. Remembering William, Gui chooses him to join the abbot as a tribunal judge. At trial, Remigio proudly admits his past but denies having killed anyone in the abbey. While the abbot quickly condemns Remigio for murder, William points out that the murders are tied to the Greek book, which Remigio could not read, and warns that Remigio's execution will not end the murders. Under Gui's threats of torture, however, Remigio \\"confesses\\" by falsely summoning the Devil. Gui arranges for the prisoners to be burned at the stake, while William, having \\"relapsed\\", will be taken to Avignon. The papal delegates condemn the Franciscans for William's obstinacy and end the debate. As the monks prepare to burn Gui's prisoners, Malachia is found dying, with black stains on his tongue and finger. Although Malachia's death vindicates William's warning, Gui takes it as proof that William is the murderer, and orders his arrest. Fleeing Gui's guards, William and Adso re-enter the secret library and come face to face with the Venerable Jorge, the oldest denizen of the abbey. Having decoded the lines on the translator's parchment, William demands that Jorge turn over the book that the dead men had been reading: Aristotle's Second Book of Poetics on Comedy. Jorge hates laughter, thinking it undermines faith in God, and a book on laughter written by Arisotle will only bring laughter to the wise men, and undermine the faith among those of learning. To prevent that, Jorge killed those who had read the book by poisoning its pages. Jorge gives the book to William, thinking he too will suffer the poison. When William reveals that he is wearing gloves, Jorge grabs the book, then starts a blaze that quickly engulfs the library. William stays behind, trying to save some of the books and encouraging Adso to leave. Jorge kills himself by consuming the poison-coated pages. Seeing the fire, the monks abandon the prisoners, allowing the local peasants to save the girl, though Salvatore and Remigio die. Adso chases Gui, who manages to escape him, but the peasants push his wagon off a cliff, impaling him. As William and Adso depart, Adso encounters the girl, stops for a few seconds, but eventually chooses to go with William. The much older Adso states that he never regretted his decision as he learned many more things from William before their ways parted. He also says that the girl was the only earthly love of his life, but he never learned her name. Cast * Sean Connery as William of Baskerville * F.

He felt personally intrigued by the project and other things because of a lifelong fascination with medieval churches and a great familiarity with Latin and Greek. Annaud spent four years preparing the film, traveling throughout the United States and Europe, searching for the perfect multi-ethnic cast with interesting and distinctive faces. He resisted suggestions to cast Sean Connery for the part of William because he felt the character, who was already an amalgam of Sherlock Holmes and William of Occam, would become too overwhelming with \\"007\\" added. Later, after Annaud failed to find another actor he liked for the part, he was won over by Connery's reading, but Eco was dismayed by the casting choice, and Columbia Pictures pulled out because Connery's career was then in a slump. Christian Slater was cast through a large-scale audition of teenage boys. For the wordless scene in which the Girl seduces Adso, Annaud allowed Valentina Vargas to lead the scene without his direction. Annaud did not explain to Slater what she would be doing in order to elicit a more authentic performance from the actors.DVD commentary by Jean- Jacques Annaud The exterior and some of the interiors of the monastery seen in the film were constructed as a replica on a hilltop outside Rome and ended up being the biggest exterior set built in Europe since Cleopatra (1963). Many of the interiors were shot at Eberbach Abbey, Germany. Most props, including period illuminated manuscripts, were produced specifically for the film. Reception The film did poorly at the box office in the United States: It played at 176 theaters and grossed $7.2 million on a $17 million budget. However, it was popular in many parts of Europe and grossed over $77.2 million worldwide. Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of a possible 4, writing \\"What we have here is the setup for a wonderful movie. What we get is a very confused story...It's all inspiration and no discipline.\\" In 2011, Eco was quoted as giving a mixed review for the adaptation of his novel: \\"A book like this is a club sandwich, with turkey, salami, tomato, cheese, lettuce. And the movie is obliged to choose only the lettuce or the cheese, eliminating everything else – the theological side, the political side. It's a nice movie.\\" John Simon stated The Name of the Rose misfired due to its preposterously happy ending.

The recreation area, established on August 22, 1972, is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, and includes the Sawtooth, Hemingway–Boulders, and Cecil D. Andrus–White Clouds wilderness areas. Activities within the recreation area include hiking, backpacking, White water rafting, camping, rock climbing, kayaking, mountain biking, fishing, and hunting. The SNRA headquarters are about seven miles (11 km) north of Ketchum on Highway 75. SNRA also has a ranger station in Stanley, near its northern boundary. History The SNRA was created on August 22, 1972 by , which including creating the Sawtooth Wilderness from the Sawtooth Primitive Area. The White Clouds and Hemingway–Boulders wilderness areas were created on August 7, 2015 by Public Law 114-46. Between 1998 and 2010 an outbreak of Mountain pine beetle killed thousands of Lodgepole Pine across the Sawtooth Valley . In recent years forest management activity has increased in the form of Prescribed Fire, commercial Logging, and non-commercial thinning of dead and diseased trees throughout the Sawtooth NRA. Active Forest management is designed to reduce hazardous wildfire fuel, restore beetle killed forests, regenerate young growth, and prevent the further spread of Bark beetle and disease such as dwarf mistletoe. Forest management activities have been developed and supported by the local residents through the Sawtooth Valley Wildfire Collaborative. Geology Sawtooth Mountains Much of the SNRA was heavily glaciated, especially in the Sawtooth Mountains where remnants of these glaciers exist as glacial lakes, moraines, hanging valleys, cirques, and arêtes. The Sawtooth Fault stretches long, and runs through the Sawtooth Valley, while the two past large earthquakes likely took place on the fault around 7,000 and 4,000 years b.p. =Mountains= The Sawtooth Mountains are located within the SNRA, along with the White Cloud, Boulder, and Smoky mountains. The highest point in the SNRA is Castle Peak at in the White Cloud Mountains, while the second-highest point is Ryan Peak at in the Boulder Mountains. Thompson Peak, at an elevation of , is the highest point in the Sawtooth Mountains, while Saviers Peak at is the highest point in the Smoky Mountains. =Rivers= The headwaters of the Salmon River, also known as the \\"River of No Return\\" are in the SNRA, and the river flows north through the Sawtooth Valley before turning east in Stanley and following the northern border of the SNRA. The headwaters of the Big Wood, Boise, and Payette rivers are also in SNRA. =Lakes= There are hundreds of lakes in the SNRA, most of which have been created by alpine glaciers. The largest lakes are Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, Yellow Belly, Stanley, and Sawtooth lakes. *List of lakes of the Sawtooth Mountains *List of lakes of the White Cloud Mountains Wildlife Timber wolves were reintroduced in the 1990s and plans to reintroduce grizzly bears have been abandoned.

The ancient foundations of the sciences were driven by practical and religious concerns and or the pursuit of philosophy more generally. From the Middle Ages until the Age of Enlightenment, scholars sought various forms of noble and religious patronage or funded their own work through medical practice. In the 18th and 19th centuries, many disciplines began to professionalize, and both government-sponsored \\"prizes\\" and the first research professorships at universities drove scientific investigation. In the 20th century, a variety of sources, including government organizations, military funding, patent profits, corporate sponsorship, and private philanthropies, have shaped scientific research. Ancient science Most early advances in mathematics, astronomy and engineering were byproducts of more immediate and practical goals. Surveying and accounting needs drove ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Chinese, and Indian mathematics, while calendars created for religious and agricultural purposes drove early astronomy. Modern science owes much of its heritage to ancient Greek philosophers; influential work in astronomy, mechanics, geometry, medicine, and natural history was part of the general pursuit of philosophy. Architectural knowledge, especially in ancient Greece and Rome, also contributed to the development of mathematics, though the extent of the connection between architectural knowledge and more abstract mathematics and mechanics is unclear. State policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, dating at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought, and the study of defensive fortifications during the Warring States period in China. General levies of labor and grain were collected to fund great public works in China, including the accumulation of grain for distribution in times of famine,Francesca Bray (1984), Science and Civilisation in China VI.2 Agriculture for the building of levees to control flooding by the great rivers of China, for the building of canals and locks to connect rivers of China, some of which flowed in opposite directions to each other,Joseph Needham, Science and Civilisation in China and for the building of bridges across these rivers. These projects required a civil service, the scholars, some of whom demonstrated great mastery of hydraulics. Science policy in the Middle Ages H. Floris Cohen's historiography of the scientific revolution (How Modern Science Came into the World) credits the Umayyad caliphates and especially the Abbasid caliphates support for the translation movement from the Greek, Persian, and Syriac literature to Arabic. These translations were undertaken by the library of the House of Wisdom in Bagdhad. Al-Kindi, Al-Battani, Ibn Sahl and Ibn al-Haytham flourished under the liberal policies of these caliphates. Arabic-language science policy Science in the Islamic world during the Middle Ages followed various models, and modes of funding varied based primarily on scholars. It was extensive patronage and strong intellectual policies implemented by specific rulers that allowed scientific knowledge to develop in many areas. The most prominent example of this is with the Translation Movement of the ninth century that was facilitated by early Abbasid Caliphs.Abattouy, M., Renn, J. & Weinig, P., 2001. \\"Transmission as Transformation: The Translation Movements in the Medieval East and West in a Comparative Perspective\\". Science in Context, 14(1–2), 1–12. Other wealthy patrons also supported this movement and accelerated the process of acquiring, translating and interpreting ancient works of philosophy and science. Funding for translation was ongoing throughout the reign of certain caliphs, and it turned out that certain scholars became experts in the works they translated and in turn received further support for continuing to develop certain sciences. As these sciences received wider attention from the elite, more scholars were invited and funded to study particular sciences. Examples of translators and scholars who benefited from this type of support were al-Khawarizmi, Hunayn Ibn Ishaq and the Banu Musa.2004\\\\. Centuries in the House of Wisdom Education The Guardian.

Funding was reserved for those who were well versed in certain disciplines, and was not given based on religious affiliation. For this reason we find Jewish, Christian and mixed Muslim scholars working in Baghdad and other locations, often with one another. A notable feature of many scholars working under Muslim rule in medieval times is that they were often polymaths. Examples include the work on Optics, Math and Astronomy of Ibn al-Haytham, or the work on Biology, Theology and Arabic literature of al-Jahiz. Many of these scholars were encouraged through patronage to take a multidisciplinary approach to their work and to dabble in multiple fields. Those individuals who were knowledgeable on a wide variety of subjects, especially practical topics, were respected and well-cared for in their societies. Funding of science existed in many Muslim empires outside the Abbasids and continued even after the Mongol invasions into the Middle East. Results of patronage in Medieval Islamic areas include the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, the Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Bimaristans across the Middle East and Persia, and famous observatories, such at that of Ulugh Beg in Samarqand. It is also significant to note that later Muslim empires (Ottomans, Safavid, Mughal empires) also supported science in their own ways, even though there scientific achievements were not as prominent on a global level.O'Leary, D.L., 1952. The Early Westward Drift of Science and Philosophy. Philosophy East and West, 1(4), 53–58. 16th and 17th centuries In Italy, Galileo noted that individual taxation of minute amounts could fund large sums to the State, which could then fund his research on the trajectory of cannonballs, noting that \\"each individual soldier was being paid from coin collected by a general tax of pennies and farthings, while even a million of gold would not suffice to pay the entire army.\\"Galileo (1638) Two New Sciences, Salviati, first day of the dialogs In Great Britain, Lord Chancellor Sir Francis Bacon had a formative effect on science policy with his identification of \\"experiments of .. light, more penetrating into nature [than what others know]\\",Sir Francis Bacon (1624). New Atlantis which today we call the crucial experiment. Governmental approval of the Royal Society recognized a scientific community which exists to this day. British prizes for research spurred the development of an accurate, portable chronometer, which directly enabled reliable navigation and sailing on the high seas, and also funded Babbage's computer. =Patronage= Most of the important astronomers and natural philosophers (as well as artists) in the 16th and 17th centuries depended on the patronage of powerful religious or political figures to fund their work. Patronage networks extended all the way from Emperors and Popes to regional nobles to artisans to peasants; even university positions were based to some extent on patronage. Scholarly careers in this period were driven by patronage, often starting in undistinguished universities or local schools or courts, and traveling closer or farther from centers of power as their fortunes rose and fell. Patronage, and the desire for more, also shaped the work and publications of scientists. Effusive dedications to current or potential patrons can be found in almost every scholarly publication, while the interests of a patron in a specific topic was a strong incentive to pursue said topic—or reframe one's work in terms of it. Galileo, for example, first presented the telescope as a naval instrument to military- and commerce-focused Republic of Venice; when he sought the more prestigious patronage of the Medici court in Florence, he instead promoted the astronomical potential of the device (by naming the moons of Jupiter after the Medicis). A scholar's patron not only supported his research financially, but also provided credibility by associating results with the authority of the patron. This function of patronage was gradually subsumed by scientific societies, which also initially drew upon their royal charters for authority but eventually came to be sources of credibility on their own. =Self-funded science= Self-funding and independent wealth were also crucial funding sources for scientists, from the Renaissance at least until the late 19th century. Many scientists derived income from tangential but related activities: Galileo sold instruments; Kepler published horoscopes; Robert Hooke designed buildings and built watches; and most anatomists and natural historians practiced or taught medicine. Those with independent means were sometimes known as gentlemen scientists. =Exploration and commerce= Military and commercial voyages, though not intended for scientific purposes, were especially important for the dramatic growth of natural historical knowledge during the \\"Age of Exploration.\\" Scholars and nobles in seafaring nations, first Spain and Portugal followed Italy, France and England, amassed unprecedented collections of biological specimens in cabinets of curiosities, which galvanized interest in diversity and taxonomy. 18th and 19th centuries Gradually, a science policy arose that ideas be as free as the air (air being a free good, not just a public good). Steven Johnson, in The invention of air (a 2008 book on Enlightenment Europe and America, especially on Joseph Priestley) quotes Jefferson: \\"That ideas should spread freely from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, ... like the air ... incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.\\" p.xiii Steven Johnson (2008) The invention of air (with acknowledgement on p.241, that Johnson learned the Jefferson quotation from Lawrence Lessig. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as the pace of technological progress increased before and during the industrial revolution, most scientific and technological research was carried out by individual inventors using their own funds. For example, Joseph Priestley was a clergyman and educator, who spoke freely with others, especially those in his scientific community, including Benjamin Franklin, a self-made man who retired from the printing business. A system of patents was developed to allow inventors a period of time (often twenty years) to commercialise their inventions and recoup a profit, although in practice many found this difficult. The talents of an inventor are not those of a businessman, and there are many examples of inventors (e.g. Charles Goodyear) making rather little money from their work whilst others were able to market it. =Scientific societies= The professionalization of science, begun in the nineteenth century, was further enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the National Academy of Sciences in 1863, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1911, and state funding of universities of their respective nations. =Professionalization= =Industry= =Research universities= 1900–1945 In the twentieth century, scientific and technological research became increasingly systematised, as corporations developed, and discovered that continuous investment in research and development could be a key element of success in a competitive strategy. It remained the case, however, that imitation by competitors—circumventing or simply flouting patents, especially those registered abroad—was often just as successful a strategy for companies focused on innovation in matters of organisation and production technique, or even in marketing. A classic example is that of Wilkinson Sword and Gillette in the disposable razor market, where the former has typically had the technological edge, and the latter the commercial one. Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel's will directed that his vast fortune be utilized to establish prizes in the scientific fields of medicine, physics and chemistry as well as literature and peace. The Nobel prize served to provide financial incentives for scientists, elevated leading scientists to unprecedented visibility, and provided an example for other philanthropists of the industrial era to provide private sources of funding for scientific research and education. Ironically, it was not an era of peace that followed, but rather wars fought on unprecedented international scale that led to expanded state interest in the funding of science. =War research= The desire for more advanced weapons during World War I inspired significant investments in scientific research and applied engineering in both Germany and allied countries. World War II spawned even more widespread scientific research and engineering development in such fields as nuclear chemistry and nuclear physics as scientists raced to contribute to the development of radar, the proximity fuse, and the atomic bomb. In Germany, scientists such as Werner Heisenberg were being pushed by the leaders of the German war effort, including Adolf Hitler to evaluate the feasibility of developing atomic weapons in time for them to have an effect on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, allied countries in the late 1930s and 1940s committed monumental resources to wartime scientific research. In the United States, these efforts were initially led by the National Defense Research Committee. Later, the Office of Scientific Research and Development, organized and administered by the MIT engineer Vannevar Bush, took up the effort of coordinating government efforts in support of science. Following the United States entry into the second world war, the Manhattan Project emerged as a massive coordinated program to pursue development of nuclear weapons. Leading scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer, Glenn T. Seaborg, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller were among the thousands of civilian scientists and engineers employed in the unprecedented wartime efforts. Entire communities were created to support the scientific and industrial aspects of the nuclear efforts in Los Alamos, New Mexico; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; the Hanford site in Washington and elsewhere. The Manhattan Project cost $1,889,604,000 of which $69,681,000 was dedicated to research and development. The Manhattan Project is regarded as a major milestone in the trend towards government funding of big science. 1945–2000 =Cold War science policy= In the United States, the foundation for post-WWII science policy was laid out in Vannevar Bush's Science – the Endless Frontier, submitted to President Truman in 1945. Vannevar Bush was President Roosevelt's science advisor and became one of the most influential science advisors as in his essay, he pioneered how we decide on science policy today. Vannevar Bush, director of the office of scientific research and development for the U.S. government, wrote in July 1945 that \\"science is a proper concern of government\\" Vannevar Bush (July 1945), \\"Science, the Endless Frontier\\" This report led to the creation of the National Science Foundation in 1950 to support civilian scientific research. During the Cold War era, the former Soviet Union invested heavily in science, attempting to match American achievements in nuclear science and its military and industrial applications. At the same time, the United States invested heavily in advancing its own nuclear research and development activities through a system of National laboratories managed by the newly formed Atomic Energy Commission in collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This era of competition in science and weapons development was known as the arms race. In October 1957, the Soviet Union's successful launch of Sputnik spurred a strong reaction in the United States and a period of competition between the two new world superpowers in a space race. In reaction to Sputnik, President Eisenhower formed the President's Science Advisory Commission (PSAC). Its November 1960 report, \\"Scientific Progress, the Universities, and the Federal Government,\\" was also known as the \\"Seaborg Report\\" after University of California, Berkeley Chancellor Glenn T. Seaborg, the 1951 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry. The Seaborg Report, which emphasized federal funding for science and pure research, is credited with influencing the federal policy towards academic science for the next eight years. PSAC member John Bardeen observed: \\"There was a time not long ago when science was so starved for funds that one could say almost any increase was desirable, but this is no longer true. We shall have to review our science budgets with particular care to [maintaining] a healthy rate of growth on a broad base and not see our efforts diverted into unprofitable channels.\\" True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen,\\" (Washington, D.C.: Joseph Henry Press, 2002), p. 256 available online at http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309084083/html/256.html page viewed July 26, 2006. President John F. Kennedy's appointment of Seaborg as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1961, put a respected scientist in a prominent government post where he could influence science policy for the next 11 years. In an address at Rice University in 1962, President Kennedy escalated the American commitment to the space program by identifying an important objective in the space race: \\"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\\" . Federal funding for both pure and applied research reached unprecedented levels as the era of Big Science continued throughout the Cold War, largely due to desires to win the arms race and space race, but also because of American desires to make advances in medicine. =State funding cuts= Starting with the first Oil shock, an economic crisis hit the western world which made it more difficult for the states to maintain their uncritical funding of research and teaching. In the United Kingdom, the University Grants Committee started to lower their annual block grant for certain universities as soon as 1974. This was compounded by the access to power of the Thatcher government in 1979, who pledged a radical reduction of public spending. Between 1979 and 1981, more cuts in the block grant threatened universities and became opportunities seized by certain actors (heads of departments, vice-chancellors, etc.) for radical reorganisation and reorientation of the university's research. In 1970 in the United States, the Military Authorization Act forbade the DOD to support research unless it had \\"direct or apparent relationship to a specific military function.\\" This cut the ability of the government to fund basic research. =Selectivity= In order to administer severely depleted resources in a (theoretically) transparent manner, several selectivity mechanisms were developed through the 1980s and 1990s. In the United Kingdom, the funding cuts of 1984–1986 were accompanied by an assessment of the quality of research. This was done by estimating outside research income (from research councils and private business), as well as \\"informed prejudice\\" by the experts on the UGC. This became the first Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), soon to be followed by many others. In France, selectivity is exercised through various means. The CNRS evaluates regularly its units and researchers. For this reason, through the 1980s–90s, the government has attempted to privilege funding for researchers with a CNRS affiliation. With the creation of a contract system finalised in 1989, all research was submitted to approval of the university for inclusion in the contract passed with the Education Ministry. This allowed universities to select and privilege research and researchers they considered better than others (usually those associated to the CNRS or other grands corps de recherche). Critics of selectivity systems decry their inherent biases. Many selectivity systems such as the RAE estimate the quality of research by its income (especially private income), and therefore favour expensive disciplines at the expense of cheap ones (see Matthew effect). They also favour more applied research (liable to attract business funding) at the expense of more fundamental science. These systems (as well as others such as bibliometry) are also open to abuse and fixing. 21st century policy The NSF and OSTP have established a Science of Science and Innovation Policy program known as SciSIP, aimed at understanding the field itself. (NSF site) The European Union manages research funding through the Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development.

The first graduating class was composed of five girls who graduated in 1866. The next graduation did not occur until 1869. Since that year, the school has graduated a class annually. In 1906, a new school was built adjacent to the old one on North Church Street. During this time the Garnet and White, the annual yearbook, was established and continues to this day. In 1923, the Student Council was created to help students and staff work together. With the expansion of athletics, the school needed room for sports fields. In 1923 a stadium was built on Penn Street and stands to this day. The stadium is named J. Oscar Dicks Stadium after the man on the School Board's Athletic Committee who helped lobby for the stadium. On December 22, 1947, fire destroyed the school. The principal at the time was B. Reed Henderson and the rebuilt school would later be named after him. Onlookers to the fire witnessed catastrophic failure of the roof and flames estimated at 100 feet high. The community was stunned by the destruction of their beloved school. Parents from outside the district had paid extra money to send their students to the school, which was well known for its academic excellence. At the time of the fire, plans were already underway to build a new school on the property next to the athletic stadium. In the interim, students from the high school were placed in the adjacent junior high building until the new school was completed. The school operated on half days for junior high students and the other half for high school students. In February 1951, the West Chester Joint High School was opened at the school's current location on Montgomery Avenue. The word \\"joint\\" was used because surrounding townships who send students here had helped pay for the construction. In 1954, a junior high occupied east side of the building, but became part of the high school after growing enrollment. In 1968, the school was renamed B. Reed Henderson High School after the longest serving principal of any high school in the district. In 1966, the surrounding areas officially became the K-12 West Chester Area School District. Rising enrollment once again outpaced building capacity and West Chester East High School was built. The building was renovated in the 1970s, adding a new library and second cafeteria. In later years, the auditorium was refurbished and bathrooms updated. In 2003, renovations and additions took place.B.

Henderson also has a great variety of clubs; one of the most popular, the Astronomy Club, has recently acquired a high powered telescope through a generous donation. =Athletics= Henderson athletic teams are part of the Ches-Mont League. Many of Henderson's sports teams have had good seasons, winning numerous Ches-Monts, Districts and State Championships. These teams include baseball, boys' soccer, field hockey, football, girls' tennis, basketball, swimming, cross country, and track and field. Specifically the boys' cross country, girls' tennis, football, track and field teams, and the boys' basketball team have been Ches-Mont Champs for multiple years. Several individuals have been named All-Americans in their sport. Several athletes have gone on to win NCAA championships in college and several have made the Olympic Trials. In 2010, the Baseball team won the school's second Ches-Mont title, and first AAAA state championship title. The team beat District 1 rival Owen J. Roberts 7-0 in the state title game. In 2007 the Varsity Hockey team won the Flyers Cup Championship and were crowned Pennsylvania State Champs at the Class A level with a victory over Penguins Cup winner Freeport, the same year their football team went on to the AAAA District 1 championships. The girls' soccer team won a national championship in 1997 and won the state championship in 1995, 1998 and 1999. They also played in the State Championship in 1996 although they lost 0-1. The boys' soccer team were the state champions in 2002 and state runners up in 2004 and 2005. The boys' cross country team won back to back state titles in 2002 and 2003 and finished second to eventual national champion Coatesville High in 2006. Currently, the team is ranked 13th in the country and 1st in the state and is looking to qualify for Nike Cross Nationals (NXN) after winning the 2009 PIAA State Championship. At Nike Indoor Nationals in 2007 the boys' distance medley relay won the national championship, edging Fork Union high school by 1/2 of a second. In 1991, the 4x400 relay won the Championship of America race at the Penn Relays defeating several international teams and was the only US team to win the event between 1985 and 1996. They recently won the PIAA State Championship of 2012. In 2011, the girls' track and field 4x800m relay team won the state championship and broke a 29-year-old state record. The new state record is 8:55.43, which was also the fastest time in the nation in 2011.

Clay Kaserne () , commonly known as Clay Kaserne, is an installation of the United States Army in Hesse, Germany. The kaserne is located within Wiesbaden-Erbenheim. It is named for General Lucius D. Clay. It is the home of the Army's 2d Theater Signal Brigade, 66th Military Intelligence Brigade and is the headquarters of the U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR), which oversees the 7th Army Training Command, 10th Army Air & Missile Defense Command and 21st Theater Sustainment Command. Clay Kaserne also maintains an airfield. History =Origins= Lucius D. Clay Kaserne was new military facility built near the village of Garlstedt just north of the city of Bremen. The facilities cost nearly $140 million to construct, half of which was paid for by the Federal Republic of Germany. The 2nd Armored Division (Forward) stationed there had approximately 3,500 soldiers and another approximately 2,500 family dependents and civilian employees. The German government constructed family housing in the nearby city of Osterholz-Scharmbeck. In addition to troop barracks, motor pools, an indoor firing range, repair and logistics facilities, and a local training area, facilities at Garlstedt included a troop medical clinic, post exchange, library, movie theater, and a combined officer/non-commissioned officer/enlisted club. The division's soldiers and family members received radio and TV broadcasts from The American Forces Network (AFN) – Europe via the AFN Bremerhaven affiliate station located in the nearby port city of Bremerhaven. The brigade was officially designated as 2nd Armored Division (Forward) during ceremonies at Grafenwöhr, FRG on 25 July 1978. The Garlstedt facilities were officially turned over to the United States by the German government in October. At that time the Garlstedt kaserne (camp) was named after General Lucius D. Clay, revered by the German people for his role as the American military commander following World War II. His son, a retired U.S. Army major general, attended the ceremony. The brigadier general in charge of 2nd Armored Division (Forward) had a unique command. In addition to command of the heavy brigade, he also functioned as the Commander, III Corps (Forward), headquartered in Maastricht, Netherlands, and as commander of all US Army forces in Northern Germany, including the military communities of Garlstedt and Bremerhaven. In the event of the deployment of III Corps and/or the 2nd Armored Division from the United States, the division commander would revert to his job as assistant division commander for operations of 2nd Armored Division. This contingency was practised during REFORGER exercises in 1980 and 1987. As a result of this varied and demanding job, command of the 2nd Armored Division (Forward) was considered a plum assignment for armor branch brigadier generals, on par with perhaps only the Berlin Brigade for high visibility and potential for advancement to higher rank. The brigade initially deployed to Germany with the M60 Patton tank and the M113 armored personnel carrier. 4–3rd Field Artillery had the M109 155 mm self-propelled howitzer. In 1984, 2–66th AR transitioned to the M1 Abrams main battle tank. In 1985, 3–41st IN and 4–41st IN transitioned to the M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle; also, C/2-1 Cavalry was replaced by an air cavalry troop, D/2-1 Cavalry, armed with AH-1S Cobra attack helicopters. The brigade's initial subordinate combat units consisted of the 3rd Battalion of the 41st Infantry Regiment, 2nd Battalion of the 50th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Battalion, 66th Armored Regiment (Iron Knights), 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery Regiment, and C Troop, 2nd Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment. In October 1983, as part of the army's regimental alignment program, 2–50 Infantry was redesignated as 4–41 Infantry and 1–14 Field Artillery as 4–3 Field Artillery. Other brigade subordinate units eventually included the 498th Support Battalion, D Company, 17th Engineer Battalion, and the 588th Military Intelligence Company. The brigade also had a military police platoon and an aviation detachment. In 1986, under the army's COHORT unit manning and retention plan, 3–41st Infantry returned to Fort Hood and was replaced by 1–41st Infantry. In 1987, 4–41st Infantry returned to Fort Hood, Texas and was replaced by 3–66th Armor (Burt's Knights, named for Captain James M. Burt who was awarded the Medal of Honor as a company commander in the 66th Armored Regiment in the Battle of Aachen during World War II). Now an armor-heavy brigade, 2nd Armored Division (Forward) fielded 116 M-1A1 Abrams tanks and nearly 70 M2/3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles. The division participated in numerous major NATO training exercises, including \\"Trutzige Sachsen\\" (1985), \\"Crossed Swords\\" (1986) and the \\"Return of Forces to Germany\\" (REFORGER) (1980 and 1987). Division subordinate units used the NATO gunnery and maneuver ranges at the Bergen-Hohne Training Area for gunnery and maneuver training and each year the division as a whole deployed south to Grafenwöhr and Hohenfels[24] (both in Bavaria) training areas for annual crew and unit gunnery and maneuver qualification. The division had a formal partnership with Panzergrenadierbrigade 32, a Federal Republic of Germany Bundeswehr mechanized infantry brigade headquartered in nearby Schwanewede. The division also had informal relationships with Dutch, Belgian, and British NORTHAG forces, often conducting joint training activities at Bergen Hohne. After the Gulf War the division went through a series of inactivations and redesignations. Due to the restructuring of the U.S. Army after the end of the Cold War, the 2nd Armoured division was ordered off the active duty rolls, ending more than 50 years of continuous service. SGT Michael L. Anderson was the last member of the 2nd Armored Division.[citation needed] He was a 74F who was in charge of cutting orders for all remaining members of 2nd Armored Division HQ. On 1 September 1991, he cut the final orders for himself and his commanding officer. Over the summer and fall of 1992, 2nd Armored Division was inactivated. Lucius D. Clay Kaserne was turned back over to the German government and was later to become home of the German Army Logistics and Supply School (Logistikschule der Bundeswehr) as well as the seat of General der Nachschubtruppe. Lucius D. Clay's name was later reused for the Wiesbaden Army Airfield.2nd Armored Division The land on which present-day Clay Kaserne now stands was originally built in 1910 as a race track for horses. In 1929, the race track was converted into a regional airport. The Luftwaffe took over operations in 1936. One unit stationed at the airfield was Jagdgruppe 50, a fighter group of Messerschmitt Bf 109s. =World War II= On August 17, 1943, Jagdgruppe 50 intercepted American bombers taking part in the ill-fated Regensburg Strike targeting the Messerschmitt factory in Regensburg and the ball bearing plants in Schweinfurt. Alfred Grislawski, a German fighter ace,Fellgiebel took part.Sky Battles, Sky Warriors, by Alfred Price, The field was captured when the 80th U.S. Infantry Division took Wiesbaden on 28 March 1945.The Last Offensive by Charles B. MacDonald, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 71-183070 Subsequently, the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) gave the base the temporary designation \\"Y-80.\\" =Cold War= C-54 Skymaster Berlin Airlift in the Winter of 1948–49 Beginning in September, 1945, the European Air Transport Service (EATS) operated passenger and cargo service from Wiesbaden daily to London, Munich, Bremen, Vienna and Berlin. From Berlin an EATS plane made weekly flights to Warsaw, Poland. Flights originated from Vienna for Bucharest, Belgrade, Sofia, and Budapest. In the Mediterranean area EATS flights connected Udine, Pisa, Rome, and Naples. EATS originally was composed of left-over wartime troop carrier squadrons, glider and fighter pilots, B-17 \\"Flying Fortress\\" crewmen and other available personnel. In addition to regular flights which service the Army of Occupation, EATS also operated special flights such as providing transportation for diplomatic officials, evacuating sick or wounded, performing mercy flights, aiding Graves Registration in returning the remains of American soldiers and rushing supplies to needy areas. In 1948 the installation served as a hub supporting the Berlin Airlift with around-the-clock flights to Tempelhof Airport. Airmen from Wiesbaden distinguished themselves in support of \\"Operation Vittles\\". C-47 \\"Skytrain\\"s and C-54 \\"Skymasters\\" of the 60th Troop Carrier Group flew missions daily to Tempelhof in the beleaguered city of Berlin. During one day's operations more than 80 tons of food and supplies were airlifted from Wiesbaden. The streets on Wiesbaden Air Base were named after servicemen who gave their lives during the Airlift. On 4 July 1956 a U-2A stationed in Wiesbaden flew over both Moscow and Leningrad as part of Operation Overflight, missions to spy on Soviet military bases. This was the first flight by a U-2 over the Soviet Union. It was flown by United States Air Force pilot Hervey Stockman, and the aircraft is now in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. In 1973, the headquarters of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) was relocated to Ramstein Air Base near Kaiserslautern. The Air Force moved most personnel out of Wiesbaden in 1975 as part of Operation Creek Swap, in which most Army facilities in Kaiserslautern were turned over to the Air Force, in exchange for the facilities at Wiesbaden. The 4th Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, was stationed at Wiesbaden in 1976 as part of \\"Brigade 76\\" until it was replaced by the 3d Corps Support Command and 12th Aviation Brigade in the mid-1980s. In the mid-1980s, the base served as a landing point for the F-117 \\"Nighthawk\\" \\"Stealth Fighter\\". Although not officially acknowledged by the Air Force until 1988, the F-117 became operational in 1983. The Wiesbaden Air Base would \\"go dark\\", turning off all airfield and perimeter lights, whenever \\"stealth\\" flights were landing or taking off. From 1975 to 1993, the air base was a joint Army/Air Force community. In 1993, Wiesbaden Air Base was officially renamed Wiesbaden Army Air Field (WAAF). U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF)/U.S. Air Forces in Europe units (USAFE) assigned to Wiesbaden Air Base or Lindsey Air Station from 1945 to 1993 included: * 363d Reconnaissance Group May – August 1945 * 51st Troop Carrier Group September 1945 – August 1948 * 317th Troop Carrier Group 30 September – 15 December 1948 * 7150th Air Force Composite Wing 15 December 1948– 1 October 1949 * 60th Troop Carrier Wing 1 October 1949 – 2 June 1951 * 18th Weather Squadron Headquarters 1949 – 1957 * 7110th Support Wing 2 June 1951 – 1 December 1957 * 7030th Support Wing 1 December 1957 – 15 November 1959 * 7100th Support Wing 15 November 1959 – 15 April 1985 * 7100th Air Base Group 15 April 1985 – 1 June 1993 * 1602d Air Transport Wing, 1 Jun 1948-30 May 1964 (MATS) =21st century= Until summer 2011, WAAF was home to the headquarters of 1st Armored Division and a number of subordinate units. As American forces draw down in Europe, 2017 plans called for Wiesbaden to remain one of six geographic hubs for U.S. forces in Europe. After the closure of US facilities in Frankfurt, Germany, the headquarters of American Forces Network (AFN) was moved to Mannheim. AFN opened a small regional studio, AFN Hessen, on WAAF to serve the American troops in and around Wiesbaden. It is now home to the 2nd Military Intelligence Battalion of the 66th Military Intelligence Brigade, flying the RC-12 Guardrail signals intelligence aircraft. On June 14, 2012, WAAF was renamed \\"Lucius D. Clay Kaserne\\" after General Lucius D. Clay. Clay was the former U.S. military governor of the Germany and architect of the rebuilding of Germany after World War II that led to the Marshall Plan. Clay instituted Operation Vittles from WAAF in 1948, retiring only after the Soviets lifted their blockade of Berlin. Prior to this renaming, \\"Lucius D. Clay Kaserne\\" was the name of a U.S. Army facility in then-West Germany, near the community of Garlstedt in Osterholz-Scharmbeck. The installation still named Clay Kaserne had been the home of the 2nd Armored Division (Forward) and is now the home of the Bundeswehr's logistics school. Lindsey Air Station Lindsey Air Station, an installation on the opposite side of Wiesbaden from the air base, was established as an Army Air Force installation on 13 November 1946, having previously been a German Army facility named Gersdorff Kaserne. Lindsey Air Station achieved its greatest prominence between December 1953 and 14 March 1973 when it was the host base for Headquarters, USAFE. After the transfer of Wiesbaden Air Base to the Army in 1976, Lindsey Air Station provided support for various Air Force units in the Wiesbaden area until it was returned in 1993 to the Federal Republic of Germany and renamed Europaviertel. The buildings at Lindsey Air Station now house certain offices of the German Federal Investigation Bureau Bundeskriminalamt (BKA), the State Police of Hesse, new private housing and a folk high school (VHS). The sports field and gym are now the home of the Wiesbaden Phantoms.

The agreement was signed between Anglo-Persian Company (later renamed British Petroleum), Royal Dutch/Shell, Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later renamed Total), Near East Development Corporation (later renamed ExxonMobil) and Calouste Gulbenkian (an Armenian businessman). The aim of the agreement was to formalize the corporate structure of IPC and bind all partners to a \\"self-denial clause\\" that prohibited any of its shareholders from independently seeking oil interests in the ex-Ottoman territory. It marked the creation of an oil monopoly, or cartel, of immense influence, spanning a vast territory. The cartel preceded easily by three decades the birth of another cartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which was formed in 1960. United States Office of the Historian: The 1928 Red Line Agreement Red Line Agreement 1928 territory As Giacomo Luciani (2013) writes: > \\"Having formed IPC, [Calouste] Gulbenkian insisted that participants in the > consortium sign what became known as the Red Line Agreement (Yergin 1991: > 203–6). The red line was drawn on a map to define the territories formerly > under the sovereignty of the Ottoman Empire, and the agreement stated that > participants in the IPC consortium pledged to be involved in the > exploitation of any oil to be discovered within the red line exclusively > through consortia with the same composition as the IPC. Hence, if one of the > IPC consortium members were to discover any oil or obtain a concession > elsewhere within the red line, it would have to offer this asset to the > remaining members in the same ‘geometry’ as in the IPC.\\" It has been said that, at a meeting in 1928, Calouste Gulbenkian, an Armenian businessman and philanthropist, drew a red line on a map of the Middle East demarcating the boundaries of the area where the self-denial clause would be in effect.\\"The Emergence of the Arabian Oil Industry\\" by Rasoul Sorkhabi, Ph.D., University of Utah's Energy & Geoscience Institute, GeoExpro, No. 6 of 2008. Gulbenkian said this was the boundary of the Ottoman Empire he knew in 1914. He should know, he added, because he was born in it and lived in it. The other partners looked on it attentively and did not object. They had already anticipated such a boundary. (According to some accounts, the “red line” was not drawn by Gulbenkian but by a French representative.) Except for Gulbenkian, the partners were the supermajors of today. Within the “red line” lie the entire ex-Ottoman territory in the Middle East including the Arabian Peninsula (plus Turkey) but excluding Kuwait. Kuwait was excluded as it was meant to be a preserve for the British. Years later, Walter C. Teagle of Standard Oil of New Jersey remarked that the agreement was “a damn bad move”.Bennett H. Wall and George S. Gibb, Teagle of Jersey Standard, New Orleans, 1974, p. 209 However, it served to define the sphere of operations of TPC's successor, the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC). The writer Stephen Hemsley Longrigg, a former IPC employee, noted that \\"the Red Line Agreement, variously assessed as a sad case of wrongful cartelization or as an enlightened example of international co‑operation and fair-sharing, was to hold the field for twenty years and in large measure determined the pattern and tempo of oil development over a large part of the Middle East\\".Oil in the Middle East by S. H. Longrigg, 2nd Edition, published by the Oxford University Press, 1961, p.70 Apart from Saudi Arabia and Bahrain where ARAMCO and BAPCO prevailed, IPC monopolized oil exploration inside the Red Line during this period. American oil companies Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum were partners in IPC and therefore bound by the Red Line Agreement. When they were offered a partnership with ARAMCO to develop the oil resources of Saudi Arabia, their partners in IPC refused to release them from the agreement. After the Americans claimed that World War II had ended the Red Line Agreement, protracted legal proceedings with Gulbenkian followed.Daniel Yergin, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power, New York, 1991, pp. 413-9 Eventually the case was settled out of court and the American partners were allowed to join ARAMCO.\\"Oil: Share the Wealth”, Time, 23 December 1946 The Red Line Agreement became a legacy document after this date, as IPC continued to operate existing concessions under its terms but the shareholder companies were allowed independently to seek new oil concessions across the Middle East.

Synopsis A palmer (pilgrim) begs a cup from a maid who is washing at the well, so that he could drink from. She says she has none. He says that she would have, if her lover came. She swears she has never had a lover. He says that she has borne six babies and tells her where she buried the bodies. She begs some penance from him. He tells her that she will be transformed into a stepping-stone for seven years, a bell-clapper for seven, and spend seven years in hell. In some variants, the children were incestously conceived. Commentary This ballad combines themes from the Biblical stories of the Samaritan woman at the well, and Mary Magdalene. In several foreign variants, the palmer is in fact Jesus. The ballad \\"The Cruel Mother\\", Child ballad 20, exists in a number of variants, in some of which there are verses where the dead children tell the mother she will suffer a number of penances each lasting seven years; those verses properly belong in \\"The Maid and the Palmer\\".

This should be contrasted with policies such as the American first-sale doctrine, where artists do not have the right to control or profit from subsequent sales. History The Angelus was sold by Millet for 1,000 francs in 1865, but just 14 years after Millet's death in 1889 it was sold by the copper merchant Secrétan for 553,000 francs The droit de suite was first proposed in Europe around 1893, in response to a decrease in the importance of the salon, the end of the private patron, and to champion the cause of the \\"starving artist\\". Many artists, and their families, had suffered from the war, and droit de suite was a means to remedy socially difficult situations.Assemblee-nationale.fr According to Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, droit de suite was created in France following the sale of Millet's 1858 painting, the Angélus, in 1889 at the Secretan sale. The owner of the painting made a huge profit from this sale, whereas the family of the artist lived in poverty. Legislation =European Union= The 2001/84/EC directive mandates a somewhat uniform system of droit de suite across the European Union. This directive is controversial in the United Kingdom. =France= In France, this system is in force through article L122-8 of the Code of intellectual property. It will be reformed by article 48 of the DADVSI law, which implements directive 2001/84/EC. During discussions in the French Parliament leading to this law, it was argued that in practice, the droit de suite is only paid at auctions, and that it thus disfavors the Paris art marketplace compared to London or New York City. Following DADVSI, a government regulation (through a decree) is to set degressive rates and maximal fees so that the Paris marketplace is not hindered.Assemblee- nationale.fr =United States= The California Resale Royalty Act, (Civil Code section 986), was struck down as unconstitutional on May 17, 2012, because it violated the US Constitution Interstate Commerce clause, ending a 35-year run that entitled artists to a royalty payment upon the resale of their works of art under certain circumstances. The ruling by Judge Jacqueline H. Nguyen of the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, is pending appeal in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Nguyen added: > The Court finds that the CRRA explicitly regulates applicable sales of fine > art occurring wholly outside California [emphasis added]. Under its clear > terms, the CRRA regulates transactions occurring anywhere in the United > States, so long as the seller resides in California. Even the artist-the > intended beneficiary of the CRRA-does not have to be a citizen of, or > reside in, California....Therefore, the CRRA violates the Commerce Clause of > the United States Constitution. California’s droit de suite statute, the California Resale Royalty Act, was enacted in 1976, and was struck down on May 17, 2012, pending appeal. The law applied to all works of fine art resold in California, or resold anywhere by a California resident, for a gross sale of $1000 or more. It had mandated a five percent royalty on the resale price of any work of fine art. An artist was able to waive this right “by a contract in writing providing for an amount in excess of five percent of the amount of such sale.” At least one scholar has proposed that this law is unconstitutional in that it effects a Fifth Amendment taking of private property. In September 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office published a \\"Notice of Inquiry\\" regarding establishing an artist \\"resale royalty right\\" in the US.\\"Resale Royalty Right\\", U.S. Copyright Office (last visited October 24, 2012). The Notice was published in response to a request by Representative Jerrold Nadler and Senator Herb Kohl, who had introduced droit de suite legislation in 2011. The Copyright Office's subsequent report endorsed \\"congressional consideration of a resale royalty right, or droit de suite, which would give artists a percentage of the amount paid for a work each time it is resold by another party.\\" A follow-up bill was introduced in 2014, the American Royalties Too Act, and was vigorously opposed by auction houses. The bill died in committee. =Australia= The Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists Act 2009 gives the creator of an artwork the right to receive a royalty when their work is resold on the commercial art market. For artworks already in existence at 9 June 2010, the royalty applies only to the second and subsequent resales after that date. Under clauses 22 and 23 of the act artists have a case by case right to instruct the appointed government agency the Copyright Agency Ltd, to not collect and/or make their own individual collection arrangements. The royalty is calculated as 5% of the sale price, but does not apply where that price is less than $1,000. It is payable, via an official collecting agency, or if the creator chooses (on a case by case basis) it can be paid directly to the creator, on resales made during their lifetime and to their heirs for resales made up to 70 years after the creator’s death. The primary legal obligation to pay the royalty rests on the seller. However, in economic terms, it may effectively be passed on to the purchaser. Eligible artworks include original works of graphic or plastic art, including pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware, photographs, fine art textiles, installations, fine art jewellery, artists’ books, carvings and multi-media artworks. The royalty is restricted to Australian citizens or residents, though there is provision for reciprocal rights to be extended in the future to persons resident in other jurisdictions with compatible royalty schemes. The introduction of the scheme was controversial, as it has been elsewhere. During the first three years of its operation, royalty payments totaling $1.5m were made to about 650 artists for 6,800 transactions, with about 50% going to Indigenous artists. The highest individual royalty was A$50,000. Most recipients have received amounts ranging from A$50 to A$500. The average transaction cost is reportedly $30 AU. A review of the scheme was announced in June 2013. =Philippines= The Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines (Republic Act 8293) gives the author/artist or his heirs a 5-percent share in the gross proceeds of the sale or lease of the original painting, sculpture, or manuscript, subsequent to its first disposition by the creator. This right exists during the lifetime of the author or artist and fifty years after his/her death.

It is licensed and owned by Morgan State University. WEAA was named 1999 Jazz Station of the Year by Gavin Magazine. The station has been noted for its willingness to host intense discussions of issues like racism and sexuality.Rob Hiassen, \\"WEAA's companion talk shows don't mince words\\", Baltimore Sun, 23 February 1994, p. 1C. Although WEAA is based at Morgan State, most of its staff are non-students, and it serves a larger community within Baltimore. However, the station does take on many student interns and volunteers, who learn skills connected to radio broadcasting.Sandy Alexander, \\"Campus stations claim niche in radio market\\", Baltimore Sun, 21 April 2002. History WEAA went live on January 10, 1977. It debuted at 88.9 MHz as an educational, non-commercial station.\\"Morgan's Radio Station Slated to Begin in January.\\" Baltimore Sun, November 29, 1976,p. 44. Its first format was \\"black progressive,\\" which featured a wide range of music by black performers: jazz, Caribbean, a gospel show, some blues, some soul, and album tracks by black artists. The station also had a news department and broadcast some educational programs. Some sources have claimed that the call letters stood for \\"We Educate African- Americans.\\" David Zurawik. \\"At Morgan, WEEA Goes Back to Its Educational Roots.\\" Baltimore Sun, October 15, 2017, pp. E1, E5. Program manager Al Stewart said his vision was for the station to both educational and entertaining. And because the station was on the campus of Morgan State, students would be given valuable experience gathering news or producing public affairs programs, in addition to serving as deejays.Antero Pietila. \\"Morgan Opens FM Station.\\" Baltimore Sun, January 25, 1977, pp. B1, B3. After beginning with 18 hours a day of programming, WEAA tried to move to a 24-hour a day operation in mid-May 1977.\\"Morgan Radio Station to Air 24 Hours Daily.\\" Baltimore Sun, May 16, 1977, p. C24. However, the station was not able to sustain this, and instead returned to a regular schedule of being on air from 6 AM to midnight, 7 days a week.\\"Morgan Radio Fund Drive Exceeds Expectations.\\" Baltimore Sun, May 1, 1979, p. 21. Within a few months, WEAA was gaining positive attention for its news coverage: student reporters focused on events of interest to the black community, in addition to events occurring on campus. Members of the news department also began winning awards for their news features.\\"Morgan State Co-Ed Takes First.\\" Atlanta Voice, December 10, 1977, p. 19. The station also covered college sports, including Morgan State football.\\"Morgan State at Virginia State.\\" Baltimore Sun, September 30, 1983, p. 28. WEAA soon proved to be successful at fundraising, getting listeners to support the station's programs. By 1979, the station was able to raise more than $50,000 during a pledge drive, exceeding the station management's expectations. Additionally, WEAA became home to several people who went on to become famous. Among them was Kweisi Mfume, who served as program director of WEAA, beginning in the late 1970s, and also hosted a popular talk show;Michael Ollove. \\"Mfume Emerged as Universal Candidate in 7th District.\\" Baltimore Sun, September 11, 1986, p. 18. Mfume subsequently went on to a career in politics.Norman Wilson. \\"Welch Goal in Fourth: Neighborhood Unity.\\" Baltimore Sun, August 6, 1979, p. C4. Another famous alum of WEAA was April Ryan, who began working there as a disc jockey and then began hosting a news program in the late 1980s; she went on to become a news reporter for the American Urban Radio Networks, and a political analyst for CNN.Brittany Britto. \\"She's Got the Beat.\\" Baltimore Sun, October 30, 2016, pp. E1, E4. Some professional announcers also worked at WEAA, mentoring young students interested in broadcasting: one well-known veteran of black radio in Baltimore, Larry Dean (real name: Lawrence D. Faulkner), helped to start WEAA's news department and worked as the station's news director for nearly eight years.\\"Larry Dean, Radio Pioneer.\\" Baltimore Sun, December 15, 1985, p. 6J. Station Controversies White Baltimore activist Robert Kaufman accused WEAA of reverse racism in 1998 when they turned down his offer to host a show for free. Kaufman's complaint with the Maryland Commission on Human Rights was unsuccessful.Michael Olesker, \\"It's a sound argument for radio stations\\", Baltimore Sun, 11 May 1998. In 2007, a coalition of WEAA listeners took to the streets in protest when \\"The Powers Report\\" with Tyrone Powers went off the air. Powers and his supporters alleged that newly elected governor Martin O'Malley had used his political clout to force Powers off the air in retaliation for critical remarks.Gregory Kane, \\"Defense of ousted radio host heats up\\". Baltimore Sun, 31 January 2007, p. 1B. Powers filed a lawsuit alleging that O'Malley ordered him fired, with WEAA manager Donald Lockett and NAACP president Kweisi Mfume acting as intermediaries.Gregory Kane, \\"Lawsuit airs story on loss of air time\\", Baltimore Sun, 23 January 2008.Rev.

His work in Bengali poetry is dominated by his frequent use of regional dialects.Retrieved: 22 January 2014 In the 1950s he was among those Bengali poets who were outspoken in their writing on such subjects as the events of the Bengali Language Movement, nationalism, political and economical repression, and the struggle against the West Pakistani government. Early life and career Mahmud was born in Morail Village of Brahmanbaria District in present-day Bangladesh. His childhood and secondary education days were spent in this village which is located adjacent to Brahmanbaria town. Mahmud started his career as a journalist. He obtained widespread recognition after Lok Lokantor was published in 1963. In succession, he then penned Kaler Kalosh (1966), Sonali Kabin (1973), and Mayabi Porda Dule Otho (1976). His other notable poetical works include, Arobbo Rojonir Rajhash, Bakhtiyarer Ghora and Nodir Bhitorer Nodi. In addition to writing poetry, he wrote short stories, novels and essays such as Pankourir Rakta and Upamohadesh. In 1971 he went to India and worked there to build public opinion in favour of the Liberation War of Bangladesh. After the war, he joined The Daily Ganakantha as the assistant editor. He was jailed for a year during the regime of the Awami League government. Later, he joined Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy in 1975 and retired in 1993 as director of the academy.

It is extremely rare, and has varying degrees of expressivity owing to heteroplasmy.Gene Reviews: MERRF MERRF syndrome affects different parts of the body, particularly the muscles and nervous system. The signs and symptoms of this disorder appear at an early age, generally childhood or adolescence. The causes of MERRF syndrome are difficult to determine, but because it is a mitochondrial disorder, it can be caused by the mutation of nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA. The classification of this disease varies from patient to patient, since many individuals do not fall into one specific disease category. The primary features displayed on a person with MERRF include myoclonus, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, myopathy, and ragged red fibers (RRF) on muscle biopsy, leading to the disease's name. Secondary features include dementia, optic atrophy, bilateral deafness, peripheral neuropathy, spasticity, or multiple lipomata. Mitochondrial disorders, including MERRFS, may present at any age.  Symptoms  An individual displaying MERRFs syndrome will manifest not only a single symptom, but patients regularly display more than one affected body part at a time. It has been observed that patients with MERRF syndrome will primarily display myoclonus as a first symptom. There may also be seizures, cerebellar ataxia and myopathy. Secondary features can include dementia, optic atrophy, bilateral deafness, peripheral neuropathy, spasticity, multiple lipomata, and/or cardiomyopathy with Wolff Parkinson-White syndrome. Most patients will not exhibit all of these symptoms, but more than one of these symptoms will be present in a patient who has been diagnosed with MERRF disease. Mitochondrial disorders, including MERRF, may present at any age. Due to the multiple symptoms presented by the individual, the severity of the syndrome is very difficult to evaluate.  Causes  Mitochondrial inheritance The cause of MERRF disorder is due to mutations in the mitochondrial genome. This means that it is a pathological variant in mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) and is transmitted by maternal inheritance. Four point mutations in the genome can be identified that are associated with MERRF: m.A8344G, m.T8356C, m.G8361A, and m.G8363A. The point mutation m.A8344G is mostly associated with MERRF, in a study published by Paul Jose Lorenzoni from the Department of neurology at University of Panama stated that 80% of the patients with MERRF disease exhibited this point mutation. This point mutation disrupts the mitochondrial gene for tRNA-Lys. This disrupts the synthesis of proteins. The remaining mutations only account for 10% of cases, and the remaining 10% of the patients with MERRF did not have an identifiable mutation in the mitochondrial DNA. Many genes are involved. These genes include: * MT-TK * MT-TL1 * MT-TH * MT- TS1 * MT-TS2 * MT-TF It involves the following characteristics: * progressive myoclonic epilepsy * \\"Ragged Red Fibers\\" - clumps of diseased mitochondria accumulate in the subsarcolemmal region of the muscle fiber and appear as \\"Ragged Red Fibers\\" when muscle is stained with modified Gömöri trichrome stain. There is currently no cure for MERRF.  Mechanism  The mechanism by which MERRFs syndrome occur is not yet well understood. The human mitochondrial tRNA mutations are associated with a variety of diseases including mitochondrial myopathies. However, it is understood that defects in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with these diseases, and studies have been able to assign biochemical defects. One of these defects has to do with the decreased energy available for cell processes. As muscles are stained with Gömöri trichrome, characteristic ragged red fibers are visible under the microscope. This appearance is due to the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria below the plasma membrane of the muscle fiber. These may extend throughout the muscle fiber as the disease severity increases. The mitochondrial aggregates cause the contour of the muscle fiber to become irregular, leading to the \\"ragged\\" appearance.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis varies from individual to individual. Each is evaluated and diagnosed according to age, clinical phenotype, and pressed inheritance pattern. If the individual has been experiencing myoclonus, the doctor will run a series of genetic studies to determine if it is a mitochondrial disorder. The molecular genetic studies are run to identify the reason of for the mutations underlying the mitochondrial dysfunction. This approach will avoid the need for a muscle biopsy or an exhaustive metabolic evaluation. After sequencing the mitochondrial genomes, four points mutations in the genome can be identified which are associated with MERRF: A8344G, T8356C, G8361A, and G8363A. The point mutation A8344G is mostly associated with MERRF, in a study published by Paul Jose Lorenzoni from the Department of neurology at University of Panama stated that 80% of the patients with MERRF disease exhibited this point mutation. The remaining mutations only account for 10% of cases, and the remaining 10% of the patients with MERRF did not have an identifiable mutation in the mitochondrial DNA. If a patient does not exhibit mitochondrial DNA mutations, there are other ways that they can be diagnosed with MERRF. They can go through computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).The classification for the severity of MERRF syndrome is difficult to distinguish since most individuals will exhibit multi-symptoms. This is often necessary for children with complex neurologic or multi-system involvement, as described below. =History and physical examination of the patient= A detailed family history should be obtained from at least three generations, particularly if there have been any neonatal and childhood deaths. A family history may also indicate if any family members exhibit features of the multi-system disease, specifically if there has been maternal inheritance. This would show transmission of the disease only to females, or if there is a family member who experienced a multi-system involvement such as: brain condition that a family member has been record to have such as seizures, dystonia, ataxia, or stroke-like episodes. There may also be optic atrophy, skeletal muscle with a history of myalgia, weakness, or ptosis. Family history may also include neuropathy and dysautonomia, or heart conditions such as cardiomyopathy. The patient's history might also exhibit kidney problems, such as proximal nephron dysfunction. There may also be endocrine conditions, such as diabetes or hypoparathyroidism. The patient might have also had a gastrointestinal condition which could have been due to liver disease, as well as episodes of nausea or vomiting. Multiple lipomas in the skin, sideroblastic anemia and pancytopenia in the metabolic system, or short stature might all be examples of patients with possible symptoms of MERRF disease. Treatment  Like many mitochondrial diseases, there is no cure for MERRF, no matter the means for diagnosis of the disease. The treatment is primarily symptomatic. High doses of Coenzyme Q10, B complex vitamins, and L-Carnitine are used for the altered metabolic processing that results in the disease. There is very little success with these treatments as therapies in hopes of improving mitochondrial function.Gene reviews: MERRF: Management of patients The treatment only alleviates symptoms, and these do not prevent the disease from progressing. Patients with concomitant disease, such as diabetes, deafness, or cardiac disease, are treated in combination to manage symptoms.  Recent studies  The Journal of Child Neurology published a paper that discusses possible new methods to test for MERRF and other mitochondrial diseases through a simple swabbing technique. This is a less invasive technique which allows for an analysis of buccal mitochondrial DNA, and showed significant amounts of the common 5 kb and 7.4 kb mitochondrial DNA deletions, which are also detectable in blood. This study suggests that a buccal swab approach can be used to informatively examine mitochondrial dysfunction in children with seizures and may be applicable to screening mitochondrial disease with other clinical presentations. Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America published an article investigating the human mitochondrial tRNA (hmt-tRNA) mutations which are associated with mitochondrial myopathies. Since the current understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms of these mutations is limited, there is no efficient method to treat their associated mitochondrial diseases. All pathogenic mutants displayed pleiotropic phenotypes, with the exception of the G34A anticodon mutation, which solely affected aminoacylation.

It was adjacent to a spring, grotto, and related shrines dedicated to the Greek god Pan. Now nearly uninhabited, Caesarea is an archaeological site in the Golan Heights. Caesarea was called Paneas (Πανειάς Pāneiás), later Caesarea Paneas, from the Hellenistic period after its association with the god Pan, a name that mutated to Banias , the name by which the site is known today. (This article deals with the history of Banias between the Hellenistic and early Islamic periods. For other periods, see Banias.) For a short period, the city was also known as Neronias (Νερωνιάς Nerōniás); the surrounding region was known as the Panion (Πάνειον Pā́neion). Caesarea Philippi is mentioned by name in the Gospels of MatthewMatthew 16:13–20 and Mark.Mark 8:27–30 The city may appear in the Old Testament under the name Baal Gad (literally \\"Master Luck\\", the name of a god of fortune who may later have been identified with Pan); Baal Gad is described as being \\"in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon.\\"Joshua 11:17, 12:7, and 13:5. Philostorgius, Theodoret, Benjamin of Tudela, and Samuel ben Samson all incorrectly identified Caesarea Philippi with Laish (i.e. Tel Dan).; ; Eusebius of Caesarea, however, accurately placed Laish in the vicinity of Paneas, but at the fourth mile on the route to Tyre. History =Hellenistic Paneas= Ruins of the Agrippa palace in \\"Neronias/Caesarea Philippi\\" Ruins of the Agrippa palace Alexander the Great's conquests started a process of Hellenisation in Egypt and Syria that continued for 1,000 years. Paneas was first settled in the Hellenistic period. The Ptolemaic kings, in the 3rd century BC, built a cult centre. Panias is a spring, today known as Banias, named for Pan, the Greek god of desolate places. It lies close to the \\"way of the sea\\" mentioned by Isaiah,Isaiah 9:1 along which many armies of Antiquity marched. In the distant past a giant spring gushed from a cave in the limestone bedrock, tumbling down the valley to flow into the Huela marshes. Currently it is the source of the stream Nahal Senir. The Jordan River previously rose from the malaria-infested Huela marshes, but it now rises from this spring and two others at the base of Mount Hermon. The flow of the spring has decreased greatly in modern times. The water no longer gushes from the cave, but only seeps from the bedrock below it. Paneas was certainly an ancient place of great sanctity and, when Hellenised religious influences were overlaid on the region, the cult of its local numen gave place to the worship of Pan, to whom the cave was dedicated and from which the copious spring rose, feeding the Huela marshes and ultimately supplying the river Jordan. The pre-Hellenic deities that have been associated with the site are Ba'al-gad or Ba'al-hermon. The Battle of Panium is mentioned in extant sections of Greek historian Polybius's history of \\"The Rise of the Roman Empire\\". The battle of Panium occurred in 198 BC between the Macedonian armies of Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Greeks of Coele-Syria, led by Antiochus III.Perseus Digital Library. TUFTS University Polybius Book 16 para 18Perseus Digital Library. TUFTS University Polybius Book 16 para 19Perseus Digital Library. TUFTS University Polybius Book 16 para 20 Antiochus's victory cemented Seleucid control over Phoenicia, Galilee, Samaria, and Judea until the Maccabean revolt. The Hellenised Sellucids built a pagan temple dedicated to Pan (a goat-footed god of victory in battle [creator of panic in the enemy], desolate places, music and goat herds) at Paneas.Chambers Dictionary of Etymology: The Origins and Development of Over 25,000 English Words Edited By Robert K. Barnhart, Sol Steinmetz (1999) Chambers Harrap Publishers L, , p 752 =Roman Period= Herod's Kingdom: During the Roman period the city was administered as part of Phoenicia Prima and Syria Palaestina, and finally as capital of Gaulanitis (Golan) was included together with Peraea in Palaestina Secunda, after 218 AD. The ancient kingdom Bashan was incorporated into the province of Batanea. Herod and Philip (20 BC-AD 34)  On the death of Zenodorus in 20 BC, the Panion, which included Paneas, was annexed to the Kingdom of Herod the Great. He erected here a temple of \\"white marble\\" in honour of his patron. In the year 3 BC, Philip II (also known as Philip the Tetrarch) founded a city at Paneas. It became the administrative capital of Philip's large tetrarchy of Batanaea which encompassed the Golan and the Hauran. Flavius Josephus refers to the city as Caesarea Paneas in Antiquities of the Jews; the New Testament as Caesarea Philippi (to distinguish it from Caesarea Maritima on the Mediterranean coast).Matthew. 16:13 In 14 AD, Philip II named it Caesarea in honour of Roman Emperor Augustus, and \\"made improvements\\" to the city. His image was placed on a coin issued in 29/30 AD (to commemorate the founding of the city), this was considered as idolatrous by Jews but was following in the Idumean tradition of Zenodorus. Province of Syria (AD 34-61)  On the death of Philip II in AD 34, the tetrarchy was incorporated into the province of Syria with the city given the autonomy to administer its own revenues. \\"Neronias\\" (AD 61-68)  In 61 AD, King Agrippa II renamed the administrative capital as Neronias in honour of Roman Emperor Nero: \\"Neronias Irenopolis\\" was the full name.Neronias Irenopolis But this name held only until 68 AD when Nero committed suicide.Madden, Frederic William (1864) History of Jewish Coinage, and of Money in the Old and New Testament B. Quaritch, p 114 Agrippa also carried out urban improvements\\"As for Panium itself, its natural beauty had been improved by the royal liberality of Agrippa, and adorned at his expenses\\" . It is possible that Neronias received \\"colonial status\\" by Nero, who created some coloniesCaesarea Philippi under Nero was called \\"Neronias\\" (in Spanish) During the First Jewish–Roman War, Vespasian rested his troops at Caesarea Philippi in July 67 AD, holding games over a period of 20 days before advancing on Tiberias to crush the Jewish resistance in Galilee.Emil Schürer, Fergus Millar, Géza Vermès (1973) The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ (175 BC-AD 135) Continuum International Publishing Group, p 494 Gospel association In the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus is said to have approached the area near the city, but without entering the city itself. Jesus, while in this area, asked his closest disciples who they thought he was. Accounts of their answers, including the Confession of Peter, are found in the Synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Here Saint Peter made his confession of Jesus as the Messiah and the \\"Son of the living God\\", and Christ in turn gave a charge to Peter. The apostles Peter, James and John were eyewitnesses to the Transfiguration of Christ, which happened \\"in a high place nearby\\" and is recorded in Matthew (17:1-7), Mark (9:2-8) and Luke (9:28-36).Matthew 17:1-7, Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:28-36 According to the Christian ecclesiastical tradition, a woman from Paneas, who had been bleeding for 12 years, was miraculously cured by Jesus.Luke; 8:43; Mark 5:23; Matthew 9:20 =Byzantine period= Julian the Apostate  On attaining the position of Emperor of the Roman Empire in 361 AD Julian the Apostate instigated a religious reformation of the Roman state, as part of a programme intended to restore the lost grandeur and strength of the Roman State. He supported the restoration of Hellenic paganism as the state religion. In Panease this was achieved by replacing the Christian symbols. Sozomen describes the events surrounding the replacement of a statue of Christ (which was also seen and reported by Eusebius):- > Having heard that at Caesarea Philippi, otherwise called Panease Paneades, a > city of Phoenicia, there was a celebrated statue of Christ, which had been > erected by a woman whom the Lord had cured of a flow of blood. Julian > commanded it to be taken down, and a statue of himself erected in its place; > but a violent fire from the heaven fell upon it, and broke off the parts > contiguous to the breast; the head and neck were thrown prostrate, and it > was transfixed to the ground with the face downwards at the point where the > fracture of the bust was; and it has stood in that fashion from that day > until now, full of the rust of the lightning.\\" =Early Islamic period = In 635, Paneas gained favourable terms of surrender from the Muslim army of Khalid ibn al-Walid, after the defeat of Heraclius's army. In 636 AD, a newly formed Byzantine army advanced on Palestine, using Paneas as a staging post, on the way to confront the Muslim army at Yarmuk. The depopulation of Paneas after the Muslim conquest was rapid, as the traditional markets of Paneas disappeared (only 14 of the 173 Byzantine sites in the area show signs of habitation from this period). The Hellenised city fell into decline. The council of al-Jabiyah established the administration of the new territory of the Umar Caliphate, and Paneas remained the principal city of the district of al-Djawlan (the Golan) within Jund Dimashq, jund meaning \\"military province\\" and Dimashq being the Arabic name of Damascus, due to its strategic military importance on the border with Filistin (Palestine). Around 780, the nun Hugeburc visited Caesarea and reported that the town had a church and a \\"great many Christians\\". Bishopric (Byzantine period until present) Caesarea Philippi became the seat of a bishop at an early date: local tradition has it that the first bishop was the Erastus mentioned in Saint Paul's Letter to the Romans (). What is historically verifiable is that the see's bishop Philocalus was at the First Council of Nicaea (325), that Martyrius was burned to death under Julian the Apostate, that Baratus was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381.

To the left the cable car installation can be seen. The Mount of Temptation (, ) is said to be the hill in the Judean Desert where Jesus was tempted by the devil (). The exact location is unknown and impossible to determine. It is generally identified with Mount Quarantania, Arabic name: Jabal al-Quruntul, from its Crusader name, Mons Quarantania, a mountain approximately high, towering from the northwest over the town of Jericho in the West Bank. According to the public domain Catholic Encyclopedia (1907-1914), Quarantania is \\"a limestone peak on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho\\". Description Halfway up to the top of the mount is the Greek Orthodox Monastery of the Temptation or \\"Deir al-Qarantal\\" in Arabic. Above Qarantal, on top of the cliff, is a modern wall that sits on the ruins of the Hasmonean (later Herodian) fortress Dok or Duq (), mentioned in the First Book of Maccabees, which appears as Dagon in Josephus' \\"Antiquities of the Jews\\" (Ant., XIII, viii, 1; BJ, I, ii, 3). The modern wall was built at the end of the 19th century when the Greek Orthodox hoped to raise another monastery on the top of the mount, but ran out of money.

Subordinates, understanding the commander's intentions, their own missions and the context of those missions, are told what effect they are to achieve and the reason why it needs to be achieved. They then decide within their delegated freedom of action how best to achieve their missions. Orders focus on providing intent, control measures, and objectives, allowing for greater freedom of action by subordinate commanders. Mission command is closely related to civilian management concept of workplace empowerment and its use in business has been explored by writers such as Bungay (2011) and Tozer (1995, 2012).

History  Originating from the Napoleonic corps concept, increasingly larger armies prevented movement en bloc. Commanders often separated by miles, communicating through horse-carried dispatches, were expected to maneuver in concert with one another. Beginning as early as 1807, the Prussian high command began to emphasize a battle philosophy that Moltke would later describe as: > A favourable situation will never be exploited if commanders wait for > orders. The highest commander and the youngest soldier must be conscious of > the fact that omission and inactivity are worse than resorting to the wrong > expedient Continued focus on tactical initiative at the lowest levels developed within the German army through the First World War and formally became Auftragstaktik during the Second World War. Despite the exceptional performance of the Wehrmacht at the tactical level, mission command was not adopted by NATO commanders until the 1970s.

PCD is a rare condition that occurs in less than 1% of cancer patients. As is the case with other paraneoplastic syndromes,Paraneoplastic Syndromes, 2011, Darnell & Posner PCD is believed to be due to an autoimmune reaction targeted against components of the central nervous system, mostly to Purkinje cells.S.

Part 3: Anti-Yo/CDR2, anti-Nb/AP3B2, PCA-2, anti-Tr/DNER, other antibodies, diagnostic pitfalls, summary and outlook 2015; 12, 168 (free) It is thought to be triggered when tumor cells (in PCD, most commonly ovarian or breast cancer) ectopically express proteins normally expressed in the cerebellum. This is believed to trigger an anti-tumor immune response that may be clinically significant, but also an anti-neural immune response. A broad spectrum of neuronal and glial proteins has been identified as target antigens in PCD. Presentation Neurological symptoms may include, among others, dysarthria, truncal, limb and gait ataxia and nystagmus. Symptoms often develop subacutely and progress rapidly over a period of weeks or months to a plateau period that can last for months to years and which often reflects complete loss of Purkinje cells. Pathophysiology The anti-Purkinje cell antibodies originally described in PCD led to the hypothesis that the antibody might be pathogenic, much as earlier studies had demonstrated pathogenicity of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in myasthenia gravis. However, when the antibody was used to clone the cDNA encoding the cdr2 antigen, it was found to be an intracellular protein. This led to the suggestion that there might be a cell-mediated component (T cell) in disease pathogenesis. cdr2 antigen- specific CD8+ T cells were subsequently described in more anti-Yo-positive PCD patients,. These T cells are likely components in both the anti-tumor immune response and in the neuronal degeneration. Diagnosis Of particular note, PCD symptoms precede the diagnosis of the underlying cancer in the majority of cases, and often present insidiously and progress rapidly for weeks to months to a severely disabled state followed by a variable plateau period that can last for months to years. Therefore, newly developing cerebellar ataxia should always prompt proper diagnostic measures to exclude PCD. Treatment Tumor removal is still the therapeutic mainstay with very early treatment being essential to prevent irreversible neuronal loss. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatments are often ineffective. There may be a role for high-dose gammaglobulin therapy in the treatment PCD, but due to the rare occurrence of this disease, controlled trials of this therapy may be difficult.

Harry White and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p 436–7. was a Church of Ireland clergyman, a piper and a collector of Irish music and songs. Life =As a cleric= Goodman was born in Ballyameen, Dingle, County KerryO'Brien Moran (2013). and was raised in Ventry, County Kerry, a Gaeltacht area studied at Trinity College, Dublin, having gained a scholarship in 1847. He was ordained curate of the Church of Ireland in 1851 (his father the Reverend Thomas Chute Goodman had been rector of Dingle). He married Charlotte King in 1852. They had three sons, one of whom later drowned while a student, the other two setting up a medical practice in Brigg, Lincolnshire. Goodman's first date posting was to Creagh Parish in West Cork in 1852. In 1859, he moved to Killaconagh, on the Beara peninsula, where he preached in Irish. He was posted to the parish of Abbeystrewry in Skibbereen in 1866 as a Canon of Ross, remaining there until his death in 1896. In 1867, he self-financed the rebuilding of the local church which had become dilapidated. A statue to commemorate him, playing his uilleann pipes, was erected in 2006 at the gate to the Abbeystrewery parish church in Skibbereen town. =As a music collector= While still in Ventry he learned to play the flute. In Ardgroom, County Cork (his second parish) there is a strong local tradition of his skill as a piper. The townlands around his own were well known for traditional music in the 19th century. Around this time Goodman began collecting music. There is evidence in his private manuscripts and in his letters that his song and music collecting had begun during his undergraduate days. His music collection was not published in his lifetime but by May 1861 it consisted of over 700 tunes. Some 150 of the tunes were drawn from Tom Kennedy, a blind piper living on the Dingle Peninsula.The man who saved a feast of music from the Famine years In all, his collections numbered over 2000 tunes annotated in both Irish and English. This collection is in manuscript form and now resides in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. Of the collection, 150 to 200 of the melodies are song tunes the words of which were, for many years, believed lost. In 2006, a manuscript with over 80 song-texts was discovered and was donated to Trinity College Library. He played a set of Taylor uilleann pipes, which he later gave to his friend Alderman Phair. He was widely admired and respected in the locality and is remembered for playing music seated under a tree outside his rectory or mending his pipes and sharing tunes with visiting pipers. He and his housekeeper Lizzie distributed alms to the local poor every Monday who came to his house for this purpose. They were known locally as \\"Goodman's pensioners\\". =As a Professor of Irish= Goodman was appointed Professor of Irish in Trinity College Dublin in 1879 and combined this position with his clerical duties in Skibbereen, spending alternating six months in each location. Among his students at Trinity College were Douglas Hyde and John Millington Synge.

Most commonly known as the two-spotted cricket,Orthoptera Species File: species Gryllus (Gryllus) bimaculatus De Geer, 1773 (Version 5.0/5.0; retrieved 10 July 2020) it has also been called the \\"African\\" or \\"Mediterranean field cricket\\", although its recorded distribution also includes much of Asia, including Korea, China and Indochina through to Borneo. It can be discriminated from other Gryllus species by the two dot-like marks on the base of its wings. The species is popular for use as a food source for insectivorous animals like spiders and reptiles kept as pets or in zoos. They are easy to raise and do not require prolonged exposure to cold in order to complete their life cycle. Behavior 250px = Fighting = In the wild, male crickets do not tolerate one another and will fight until there is a winner. The loser usually retreats without serious injury. The fighting method involves opening the mandibles as wide as possible, gripping the opponent's mandibles and pushing with the hind legs. = Chirping = Male crickets of this species produce several distinctive chirps, though each sound is made by rubbing the two outer wings together. Loud and steady chirps made throughout the night are to attract females and to warn off other males. Loud fast- frequency chirps are emitted when males encounter one another and are preparing to fight. They are intended to frighten off the rival male. There are two other chirp patterns that can be observed in their mating behaviors. A soft clipping sound, 'calling' song, is made when a female is known to be nearby but in a certain distance, and more rigorous sound, 'courtship' song, is made when a female is close enough to mate (mounting on the male's back). These two song can be easily distinguished by human ear based on its chirp patterns and frequency components. = Song pattern and body size = Whether cricket song pattern (e.g. frequency spectrum) reflect song-emitter's body size is controversial. A recent study failed to detect body-size effect on both calling and courtship songs of G. bimaculatus. = Shelter = These crickets hide under logs, in grasses, and in crevices. They also dig holes in the ground to create homes, or live in holes created by other animals. Males are territorial and will fight off other males, but allow any number of females to coexist in the same shelter. = Cannibalism = Cannibalism is extremely rare, but females have been observed to eat males if there is not enough food to eat. = Circadian rhythm = Pigment Dispersing Factor has been implicated in the nocturnal rhythms of crickets. Breeding Females have a tubular organ at the rear, known as an ovipositor, which is used to lay eggs into the ground. They lay their eggs into humid soil and the baby crickets hatch in about two weeks. = Polygamy = Gryllus bimaculatus exhibit polygamy, in which one individual has many different mates. Variation of polygamous behavior occurs between males and females, within a population of Gryllus bimaculatus. Both females and males continuously seek mates with whom they can spread their seed. Polyandry is the most common form of polygamy practiced in G. bimaculatus. This means that female crickets will mate with more than one male. Male crickets do not exhibit polygyny.  Polygamy in males  The rate at which males seek mates is unspecific but relatively high. This is due to anisogamy and their drive to pass on alleles while minimizing competition. Males will show the same drive to mate with previous mates as with new mates. The ability of a male cricket's sperm to successfully fertilize a female's egg after mating varies depending on various traits. An example of one trait that increases fertilization success is the amount of sperm that is effectively delivered through mating. The more sperm that is deposited results in greater fertilization success because more eggs are able to hatch. The order in which various males mate with one female before fertilization also affects fertilization success. The last male that mates with a female tends to have the highest fertilization success. Traits that increase the ability of a male's sperm to successfully fertilize a female's egg compared to that of another male are most advantageous. This is because these traits have been selected for over traits that have lower fertilization success.  Polyandry  Females prefer to mate with certain males more than others. Females show a distinct preference for mating with new males. Female G. bimaculatus mate with at least two males before zygote production occurs. Polyandry is a costly reproductive system for females because they put a lot of time, energy and resources into producing eggs. It is not as costly for males because they can produce a larger amount of sperm for less time, energy and resources. Males can also fertilize many eggs in one mating. However, polyandry is still evolved in crickets because it provides benefits that outweigh the costs. It allows females to mate with males that have more desirable traits than previous mates, which is beneficial to offspring success. This multiple mate system allows new combinations of genes to come together, which results in more genetic variation in the population. It also allows females to avoid mating with infertile males. Two mechanisms that allow polyandry to be advantageous agents for increasing males' fitness are sperm competition and male guarding behavior. = Sperm competition = Sperm competition is the interaction between sperm traits and female selection of these traits. It allows males with more advantageous traits to survive and reproduce more than less fit males. In particular, competition among males causes sperm competition to increase. Sperm expenditure will increase when there is a higher risk of competition. Reproductive investment is metabolically straining, especially for males that have less desirable genes. These males have to invest even more resources into each reproductive opportunity when a mate competitor is in their environment. The greater the amount of resources a male invests in producing a large amount of sperm, the greater the chances of successful fertilization. Sperm competition also helps to prevent crickets that have genomes that are too similar from mating. Inbreeding , which is when individuals who have closely related genomes mate, decreases the viability of cricket offspring and results in offspring with lower fitness. As a result, male crickets that are genetically similar to female mates tend to be less effective in producing healthy offspring that have high fitness. Females can avoid the costs of inbreeding by selecting sperm that are not genetically similar to their eggs. = Male guarding behavior = Male guarding behaviors are when male crickets guard female crickets after recently mating with them. These behaviors protect the guarding male's sperm and allow this sperm to fertilize the female's egg, despite the increase in predation of the guarding male. As a result, the guarding male's advantageous traits are passed on. Male guarding behaviors also reduce the risk of females becoming prey. When males protect female mates from predators, these females are saved from death. This not only has the benefit of allowing that particular male's sperm to become fertilized, but also allows the female to continue to survive and reproduce. This in turn can lead to increased mating and higher fitness between the female and guarding male. = Novel mate hypothesis = Females of G. bimaculatus species prefer to mate with new, or \\"novel\\", mates. The Novel Mate hypothesis states that a female will avoid mating with males they have already mated with. The differentiation between previous mates and novel ones allows females to search for genetically superior males. Females are able to differentiate between novel and previous mates through odor cues. These are left behind by the female on the male to allow for sensory-differentiation. This self-referent chemosensory signaling is both a reliable and simple means for a female to maximize the benefits of polyandry. Females can also use palpation and antennation before mating to deduce whether or not a mate is novel. Economic importance Gryllus bimaculatus is widely used by suppliers of live crickets for feeding to pet and zoo animals.

The station is served by Amtrak's Keystone Service between New York City and Harrisburg. The current station was built in 1990, but a planned relocation of the station is expected to be completed in 2021.  Services and facilities  The Middletown station is located on Mill Street, off of Pennsylvania Route 441 (South Union Street). In addition to being used by residents of Middletown, the station is also popular with commuters heading to Harrisburg and Philadelphia who utilize its free parking. It sees twenty-three arrivals by the Keystone Service on weekdays, thirteen from both Harrisburg and New York Penn Station, and seven from each on weekends. The station is east of Harrisburg, west of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, and from New York. In fiscal year 2018, the station saw a ridership of 68,022 passengers, a decrease of 0.2 percent from the previous year. The station consists of only a platform and a shelter. As the Middletown station is unstaffed, all tickets from the station need to be pre- paid, or purchased from a conductor on board the train. Capital Area Transit's Route 7 transit bus passes near the station on Union Street between Middletown, Harrisburg International Airport, and downtown Harrisburg.  History  The Broadway Limited passing through the station in 1980 A railroad was first laid through Middletown in 1836 by the Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mount Joy and Lancaster Railroad, which was taken over by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1850. A brick station was built in 1902, but was demolished in the 1970s. Prior to the introduction of the Keystone Service in 1981, Middletown was served by the Big Apple, the Silverliner Service, and the Keystone. A shelter and concrete platform was built in 1990 by Amtrak. From 1991 to 1995, the Atlantic City Express served the station on weekends. = Relocation = The Middletown station is in need of being relocated because it is currently on a superelevated curve and does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as well. It is to be moved to a location at Ann Street and Pennsylvania Route 230, between the current station and Harrisburg International Airport. Initial plans called for the station to be moved next to the airport terminal, but this was rejected in favor of keeping the station in the downtown area. By 2013, it was expected to be completed by 2015 and estimated to cost $32 million. Funding would be provided by the Federal Transit Administration and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). , bidding for site clearing was expected to take place in mid-2016, with the new station opening in 2018. The work includes pedestrian bridges to the platform and over Route 230, and an extension of West Emaus Street to Route 230. By early 2018, the projected opening was delayed to 2022 due to delays with Norfolk Southern and Amtrak relocating their tracks. , the work is expected to be complete in August 2021.

Parasocial interaction (PSI) refers to a kind of psychological relationship experienced by an audience in their mediated encounters with performers in the mass media, particularly on television. Viewers or listeners come to consider media personalities as friends, despite having limited interactions with them. PSI is described as an illusionary experience, such that media audiences interact with personas (e.g., talk show host, celebrities, fictional characters, social media influencers) as if they are engaged in a reciprocal relationship with them. The term was coined by Donald Horton and Richard Wohl in 1956. Evolution of the term Parasocial interaction was first described from the perspective of media and communication studies. In 1956, Horton and Wohl explored the different interactions between mass media users and media figures and determined the existence of a parasocial relationship (PSR), where the user acts as though they are involved in a typical social relationship. However, parasocial interaction has existed before mass media, when a person would establish a bond with political figures, gods or even spirits. Since then, the term has been adopted by psychologists in furthering their studies of the social relationships that emerge between consumers of mass media and the figures they see represented there. Initially, Horton and Wohl viewed parasocial interactions as abnormalities resulting from a lack of time spent with others. Perse and Rubin (1989) contested this view, finding that parasocial interactions occurred as a natural byproduct of time spent with media figures. Although originating from a psychological topic, extensive research of PSI has been performed in the area of mass communication with manifold results. Psychologists began to show their interest in the concept in the 1980s, and researchers began to develop the concept extensively within the field of communication science. Many important questions about social psychology were raised concerning the nature of these relationships that are problematic for existing theories in those fields. The concept of parasocial interaction and detailed examination of the behavioral phenomena that it seeks to explain have considerable potential for developing psychological theory. The conceptual development of parsocial interaction (PSI) and parasocial relationship (PSR) are interpreted and employed in different ways in various literature. When it is applied in the use-and-gratifications approaches, the two concepts are typically treated interchangeably, with the regard primarily to a special type of \\"interpersonal involvement\\" with media figures that includes different phenomena such as interaction and identification. In contrast to the U&G; approaches, research domains such as media psychology and semiotics argue for a clear distinction between the two terms.Klimmt, C.; Hartmann, T.; Schramm, H. (2006). \\"Parasocial interactions and relationships\\". Psychology of Entertainment: 291–313. PSI specifically means the \\"one-sided process of media person perception during media exposure\\"; whereas PSR stands for \\"a cross-situational relationship that a viewer or user holds to a media person, which includes specific cognitive and affective components\\". Schmid & Klimmt (2011) further argue that PSI and PSR are progressive states such that what begins as a PSI has the potential to become a PSR. In sum, the terms, definitions, and models explicating PSI and PSR differ across scientific backgrounds and traditions. For example, researchers Dibble, Hartmann and Rosaen (2016) argued that PSI and PSR are often \\"conflated conceptually and methodologically\\" (p. 21). To test their assertion, they tested for parasocial indicators with two different scales used for parasocial inquiry. They used the traditional PSI-Scale (A.M. Rubin et al., 1985) and the newer EPSI-Scale (Hartmann & Goldhoorn, 2011) and compared results between the two. The traditional PSI-Scale (and modified forms of it) is the most widely used measure of PSI assessment , . However, they (Dibble et al., 2016) found evidence supporting their hypothesis that the newer EPSI-Scale was a better measure of PSIs and that the traditional scale merely revealed participants' liking of characters. Because of varying conceptions, it is difficult for researchers to reach a consensus. Scientific research Studying social interaction, and by extension parasocial interaction (PSI), follows a social cognitive approach to defining individual cognitive activity. Accordingly, there are similar psychological processes at work in both parasocial relationships and face-to-face interactions. However, the parasocial relationship does not follow the process of the typical long-term relationship. The media user remains a stranger to the media figure, whereas this \\"strangeness\\" would gradually evaporate in typical social interaction. Many parasocial relationships fulfill the needs of typical social interaction, but potentially reward insecurity. Many who possess a dismissive attachment style to others may find the one-sided interaction to be preferable in lieu of dealing with others, while those who experience anxiety from typical interactions may find comfort in the lives of celebrities consistently being present. Additionally, whatever a celebrity or online figure may do can provoke emotional responses from their audiences—some even going as far as suffering from negative feelings because of it. The research of PSI obtained significant interest after the advent of the uses and gratifications approach to mass communication research in the early 1970s. In a study of early soap opera, McQuail et al. (1972) identified two essential functions of PSI: companionship and personal identity. Rosengren and Windahl (1972) further argued that PSI could be identified in the process of viewers' interacting with media figures, but such interaction did not produce identification.Rosengren, K. E., & Windahl, S. (1972). Mass media consumption as a functional alternative. In D. McQuail (Ed.), Sociology of mass communications: Selected readings (pp. 119–134). Harmondsworth: Penguin This is an important distinction, because identification has a longer history than PSI. Subsequent research has indicated that PSI is evident when identification is not present (Chory-Assad & Yanen, 2005; de Bruin, Suijkerbujk, & Jansz, 2006). During last several decades, PSI has been documented in the research analyzing the relationship between audience members and television newscasters, TV and radio talk-show hosts, sitcom characters and other TV celebrities or performers (Palmgreen, Wenner, & Rayburn, 1980; Rubin & Perse, 1987, Sood & Rogers, 2000; Park & Lennon, 2004; Spitzberg & Cupach, 2007). Research has also been conducted on how a favorable PSI can be facilitated between celebrities and their followers on social media, specifically through the interactions followers have with the celebrities posts on social media (Kim & Song, 2016). Although different PSI scales have been employed in these studies, PSI was clearly documented with each persona (Hataway, 2008). Noticing the importance of media in the area of psychological research, Giles (2002) asserted that there is a need for PSI research to move away from the field of mass communication and into the field of psychology. Studies in this area are commonly conducted by focusing a key psychological issue for PSI: concerning the similarity between parasocial relations and ordinary social relationsGleich, U. (1997). Parasocial interaction with people on the screen. In New horizons in media psychology (pp. 35–55). VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften. (Turner, 1993). For example, Turner (1993) adopted the idea of homophily (i.e., the tendency for friendships to form between people that are alike in some designated respect) to examine the interpersonal and psychological predictors of parasocial interaction with television performers. The author found that one dimension of homophily (i.e., attitude) was the best predictor of parasocial interaction. Hataway (2008) indicated that although there seems to be prevailing to analyze PSI in the domain of social psychology, a solid connection to psychological theory and developmental theory has been missing. Hataway (2008) further suggested that more psychological research is needed in order to develop parasocial theory. Specific issues cited were \\"how parasocial relationships are derived from parasocial interaction and the way those relationships further influence media usage as well as a social construction of reality, and how parasocial interaction is cognitively produced\\" (p. 18). He saw that the majority of PSI research has been conducted by mass communication scholars as a weakness and called for psychologists to refer to Giles (2002) for directions of studies. Another important consideration for the study of PSI at a psychological level is that there is a form of PSI existing even in interpersonal social situation. People may use fundamentally the same cognitive processes in both interpersonal and mediated communication. Giles (2002) also suggested that the element of direct interaction occurred in mediated interaction, such as talking to a presenter or celebrity guest, may continue in social interaction, with a cartoon character or a fictional protagonist in the mind. This may finally constitute a new way of interpreting social interaction. A further consideration is application of social cognitive approaches in individual levels. It is traditionally accepted that this approach is inadequate by itself for the study of relationships (Duck, 1994). However, a number of growing literature on the role of imagination in social interaction (Taylor, 1999; Gleason, Sebanc, & Hartup, 2000;) suggests that some imaginative activity (e.g., imaginary friends) may be an influential factor in the outcome of real social interaction. PSI is nowadays regarded as an extension of normal social cognition, specifically in terms of the use of the imagination. Current PSI literature commonly acknowledge that the psychological processes acting at the individual level parallel those used in ordinary social activity and relationship building. Psychological implications during childhood Parasocial interaction is best explored across a lifespan, which explains the growing focus on parasocial interaction in children and adolescents. Studies have found that sex-role stereotyping is common in children's parasocial relationships with media figures, though boys most overwhelmingly choose male characters, while young girls are less likely to prefer one gender over another. Additionally, sex-role stereotyping is more common in children ages 5–6, but decreases in children age 10–11. Existing literature also intimates that attachments, parasocial or otherwise, established in early childhood, are highly influential on relationships created later in life. Many studies have focused on adolescent girls because they are more likely to form a strong bond with a media figure and be influenced in terms of lifestyle choices. = Positive consequences =  Identity formation  The primary effect is that of learning: consistent with Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory, much evidence shows that children learn from positive and negative televised role models, and acquire norms and standards for conduct through media outlets such as television and video games. This is supported by a study by Cynthia Hoffner with children aged 7–12, which showed that the gender of children's favorite televised characters was strongly correlated to the gender of the children. Furthermore, the research showed \\"wishful identification\\" with parasocial relationships, namely, that boys preferred intelligence, while girls preferred attractiveness when picking favorite characters. These alternatives are both enhanced and mitigated by their separation from reality. On one hand, parasocial interactions are particularly appealing to adolescents in the throes of identity formation and increasing autonomy from parents because these relationships provide idealized figures with whom the adolescent can envision total acceptance. The lack of actual contact with these idealized figures can offer positive social interactions without risk of rejection or consequent feelings of unworthiness. One cannot know everything about a media figure or icon, allowing adolescents to attach fantasized attributes onto these figures in order to meet their own specific wants or needs. On the other hand, entities far removed from reality tend to be less influential on children. A study by Rosaen and Dibble examined correlation between realism of favorite television character and strength of parasocial relationships. Results showed a positive correlation between social realism (how realistic the character is) and strength of parasocial relationships. Results also show age-related differences among children. Older children tended to prefer more realistic characters, while younger children generally had more powerful parasocial relationships with any character. Age, however, did not impact the correlation between social realism and strength of parasocial interaction, which suggests that more real characters are grounds for more powerful parasocial relationships in children of all ages.  Learning through the media  The ability to learn from parasocial relationships is directly correlated to the strength of the relationship, as has been shown in work by Sandra L. Calvert and colleagues. In a study by Lauricella, Gola, and Calvert (2011), eight 21-month-old infants were taught seriation sequencing by one of two characters. One character, Elmo, is iconic in American culture and therefore socially meaningful, and the other, DoDo, although popular with children in Taiwan, is less well known in American media. Children were better able to learn from the socially meaningful character (Elmo) than from the character who was less easily recognized (DoDo). Furthermore, children could become better able to learn from less socially-relevant characters such as DoDo, by developing a parasocial relationship with that character. Accordingly, after children were given DoDo toys to play with, their ability to learn from that character increased. In a later study, this effect was found to be greatest when children showed stronger parasocial relationships: Children's success on the seriation task, and therefore their ability to learn from a less familiar character, was greatest for children who exhibited more emotional nurturing behaviors toward the DoDo toy during play. Personalization of a character makes a child more likely to nurture the character, and thus more likely to form a parasocial relationship that would improve learning from videos featuring the character. In place of DoDo and Elmo, Calvert et al. (2014) gave children Scout and Violet dolls. These interactive plush toy dogs can be programmed to say a child's name and have particular favorites (i.e., a favorite food, color, and song). 18-month-old children were given either personalized toys ( matched for gender, programmed to say the child's name, and programmed to have the same favorites as the child) or non-personalized toys (the opposite gender, programmed to call the children \\"Pal\\" and have random favorites). At the end of the study, children who had received personalized dolls were better able to learn from their characters than were children who had received non-personalized toys. Children also nurtured personalized toys more than non-personalized toys. It seems that perceived similarities increase children's interest and investment in the characters, which motivates the development of parasocial relationships and helps improve later screen-based learning. =Negative consequences= In the past two decades, people have become increasingly interested in the potential negative impacts media has on people's' behavior and cognition. Many researchers have begun to look more closely at how people's relationships with various media outlets affect behavior, self-perception and attachment styles, and specifically in regards to creating parasocial relationships.  Body image  Further research has examined these relationships with regard to body image and self-perception. Interest in this more narrow area of research has increased as body image issues have become more prevalent in today's society. A study was conducted to examine the relationship between media exposure and adolescents' body image. Specifically, researchers looked at parasocial relationships and the different motivations for self-comparison with a character. This study surveyed 391 7th and 8th grade students and found that media exposure negatively predicted body image. In addition to the direct negative impact, the study indicated that parasocial relationships with favorite characters, motivations to self-compare, and engagement in social comparison with characters amplified the negative effects on kids' body images. Furthermore, the researchers found that making social comparisons with favorite characters distorted actual, or ideal, body image and self- perception. Studies have been done exploring these effects across gender. A study examined the parasocial relationships between men and superheroes; the study looked at muscular vs. non-muscular superheroes and men who either did or did not develop a one-sided psychological bond with a superhero character. The results from this study indicated a significant impact on body image, particularly when exposed to muscular superhero characters. Research conducted by Ariana F. Young, Shira Gabriel, and Jordan L. Hollar in 2013 showed that men who did not form a parasocial relationship with a muscular superhero had poor self-perception and felt negative about their bodies after exposure to the muscular character. However, if the men had a PSR with the superhero, the negative effects on body satisfaction were eliminated.  Aggression  Further studies have looked into parasocial relationships and more specifically at the impacts on violent and aggressive behavior. A study done by Keren Eyal and Alan M. Rubin examined aggressive and violent television characters and the potential negative impacts they may have on viewers. The study was based on social cognitive theory and looked at trait aggression in viewers and identification and parasocial interaction with aggressive characters. The researchers measured trait aggression in each of the participants and compared that to the level of identification with aggressive characters. The study found that more aggressive viewers were more likely to identify with aggressive characters and further develop parasocial relationships with the aggressive characters. Parasocial interaction has been linked to psychological attachment theory and its consequences have seen the same dramatic effects as real Relationship breakup. In considering the relationship between parasocial interaction and attachment styles, Cohen (2004) found that individuals who were more anxious media consumers tended to be more invested in parasocial relationships. In parasocial interaction there is no \\"normal\\" social interaction; it is a very one-sided relation. The knowledgeable side has no direct control over the actions of the side it observes, and it is very difficult for it to contact and influence it.  Parasocial breakup  While much research focuses on the formation and maintenance of parasocial relationships, other research has begun to focus on what happens when a parasocial relationship is dissolved. Eyal and Cohen define parasocial breakup as \\"a situation where a character with whom a viewer has developed a PSR goes off the air.\\" The distress that media consumers experienced after a parasocial breakup was quite similar to that of a social relationship. However, the emotional distress experienced after the parasocial breakup was weaker than that of the real life interpersonal relationship. Lather and Moyer-Guse (2011) also considered the concept of parasocial breakup, but in a more temporary sense. While the study focused on parasocial breakups as a result of the writers' strike from 2007–2008, the researchers found that media consumers still experienced different levels of emotional distress. This study, like previous studies, showed that parasocial relationships operate very similarly to real-life relationships. On the internet In 1998, John Eighmey, from Iowa State University, and Lola McCord, from the University of Alabama, published a study titled \\"Adding Value in the Information Age: Uses and Gratifications of Sites on the World Wide Web.\\" In the study, they observed that the presence of parasocial relationships constituted an important determinant of website visitation rates. \\"It appears,\\" the study states, \\"that websites projecting a strong sense of personality may also encourage the development of a kind of parasocial relationship with website visitors.\\" In 1999, John Hoerner, from the University of Alabama, published a study titled \\"Scaling the Web: A Parasocial Interaction Scale for World Wide Web Sites\\", in which he proposed a method for measuring the effects of parasocial interaction on the Internet. The study explained that websites may feature \\"personae\\" that host to the visitors to the sites in order to generate public interest. Personae, in some cases, are nothing more than the online representations of the actual people, often prominent public figures, but sometimes, according to the study, will be the fictional creations of the sites' webmasters. Personae \\"take on many of the characteristics of a [real-life] companion, including regular and frequent appearances, a sense of immediacy...and the feeling of a face-to-face meeting.\\" Additionally, the study makes the point that, even when no such personae have been created, parasocial relationships might still develop. Webmasters might foster parasocial interactions through a conversational writing style, extensive character development and opportunities for email exchange with the website's persona. Hoerner used the Parasocial Interaction (PSI) scale, developed by Rubin, Perse, and Powell in 1985, and modified the scale to more accurately assess parasocial interactions on the Internet. They used the scale to gauge participants' reactions to a number of different websites, and, more generally, to determine whether or not parasocial interaction theory could be linked to Internet use. The study concluded, first, that parasocial interaction is not dependent on the presence of a traditional persona on a website; data showed that websites with described \\"strong personae\\" did not attract significantly more hits than other websites selected by the study conductors. \\"The literal, mediated personality from the newscast or soap opera of the past [around which the original PSI-scale was framed] is gone. The design metaphor, flow of the web experience, and styles of textual and graphic presentations of the information all become elements of a website persona and encourage parasocial interaction by the visitor/user with that persona.\\"  In social media  Though most literature has focused on parasocial interaction as a television and film phenomenon, new technologies, namely the Internet, have necessitated a closer look at such interactions. The applications of PSI to computer-mediated environments are continuously documented in literature in last decade (Ballantine and Martin 2005; Goldberg and Allen 2008;). Many researchers concluded that, just as parasocial relationships are present in television and radio, they are also present in online environments such as blogs and other social networking sites. Through an exploration of followers on politicians' blogs, Thorson and Rodgers (2006) found that parasocial interacting with the politician influences people's opinions about the politician, and promotes them to vote for the politician. Social media is designed to be a new channel through which parasocial interaction/relationship can be formed. Research has shown that interacting with individuals through blogs and social media such as Twitter can influence the perceptions of those individuals. As Internet users become more active on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, followers often feel more engaged with them, making the parasocial relationships stronger. Social media is defined as \\"Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0 and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content\\". While the usage of social media for personal means is common, the use of social media by celebrities has given them an opportunity to have a larger platform for personal causes or brand promotion by facilitating word-of-mouth. = Twitter = Twitter is one of the most popular social media platform and a good choice for celebrities who want to chat with their fans without divulging personal access information. In 2013, the analysis from Stever and Lawson assumed that Twitter can be used to learn about parasocial interaction and the study provided a first step in that endeavor. The study included a sample of 12 entertainment media celebrities, 6 males and 6 females, all taken from 2009–2012 Twitter feeds. The result showed that, although fans interacting with celebrities via Twitter have limited access to communicate with the celebrity, the relationship is still parasocial even though a fan might receive the occasional reply from the celebrity. Twitter can provide a direct connection between followers and celebrities or influencers that gives access to everyday information. It is an entertaining way for most fans since Twitter enables them to be a part of life that they enjoy.Katy Perry, one of the most followed people on TwitterFor example, In June 2019, Katy Perry served as the top most followed individual on Twitter for having over 108 million followers. The more followers one has on Twitter, the greater perceived social influence one has. This is particularly because tweets are broadcast to every follower, who may then retweet these posts to their own followers, which are then rebroadcast to thousands of other Twitter members (Schaefer 2012; Scott 2011). Seen as the equivalent to a movie earning a box-office hit or a single track hitting the top of the Billboard charts, the phenomenon of \\"trending\\" (i.e., words tagged at a higher rate than others on a social media platform) on Twitter grants users the ability to earn influence on the platform. Twitter, alongside other social media websites, can be utilized by its users as a form of gaining social capital. Social media networks inherit at least one key attribute from the Internet, in that they offer open accessibility for all users. Philip Drake and Andy Miah argue that the Internet, and therefore social networks and blogs, downsize the gatekeeping processes that exist in other mass media forms. They further state that this means that online information can spread unfiltered and thus does not rest on strict framework conditions such as those on television or in newspapers. This, however, remains subject to an ongoing debate within research. Through presence on social media platforms, stars and celebrities attempt on the one hand to participate in the production of their image; on the other hand, they must remain present in these media in order to stay on the media's and consequently on the audience's agenda. According to Daschmann (2007), celebrities all have to compete for the public's (limited) attention. In such a competitive environment a famous person must therefore remain present on all the accessible media channels.Jacksepticeye, a Let's Play content creator with over 22 million subscribers = YouTube = YouTube, a social media platform dedicated to sharing video-related content produced by its users, has grown in popularity to become a form of media that's likened to television for the current generation. By content creators granting insight into their daily lives through the practice of vlogging, viewers form close one-sided relationships with these creators that manifest in comment chains, fan art and consistent responses with the creator in question. Parasocial interaction and relationships are commonly formed between the creators and their audiences due to the creator's desire to interact with their fanbase through comments or posts. Many creators share \\"personal\\" details of their lives, even if there's little authenticity in the polished identity they convey online. In a study conducted by Google in 2017, a reported 40% of millennial YouTube subscribers claimed their \\"favorite creators understands them better than their friends.\\" For many viewers, parasocial relationships check off the four factors that are defined by Mark Granovetter's \\"The Strength of Weak Ties\\" theory: intimacy is gained by the creator's sharing of personal details, by which their viewers may react emotionally; viewers dedicate time to watching content the creator uploads; and what the creator posts—whether sponsored or not—may make the viewer feel as if they are being offered something, like a favor.  Commercial influences  Parasocial interaction (PSI) theory was used to understand consumers' purchasing behavior in online context. With the development of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, both companies and consumers start to use social commerce platforms more frequently. Many studies indicate that, among various factors affecting consumers' purchase decision on SCPs, such as credibility of products, parasocial interaction exerts more potential influence on users' final decisions. Sokolova and Kefi conducted a study with large data set (1209 respondents) from the audiences of four popular influencers in the beauty and fashion sector in France to discover the influence of parasocial interaction and credibility on consumers' purchase intention. Their study discovers that younger generations value parasocial interaction and their personal attachment to influencers more than credibility. On the social commerce platforms, users intend to build parasocial interaction, one with other users, one with celebrities. = PSI with other users = Certain social media users are active creators of online content, such as personal experiences, ideas, reviews, for targeted audience, which are called influencers. Influencers can become experts, similar to celebrities to some extent, and their posts may influence products and brands and affect potential customers, i.e. their followers. The users in a social commerce platform \\"meet\\" with other users and influencers through the images, videos, and feedbacks that they share on the social media. By the time, after multiples times of \\"meetings\\", the imaginary intimacy is improved, and the users will deliberately maintain the online friendship, which is a parasocial interaction. Influencers on the social media platforms often comment on the products they have tested, and promote them online to other users by providing their feelings and self-experiences along with images and videos. Under the parasocial relationship, users intend to rely on the images or comments that influencers had on the products, which will influence consumers' final decisions. Thus, many social commerce merchants utilize this psychological implication, and sift beautiful images and positive comments on products to provide users a more intuitive shopping experience. For instance, the occurrence and popularity of vlog creates a social space where strangers can share feelings and build intimate relationship. Many merchants pay vlogger for recommending and persuading their subscribers to purchase the products. = PSI with celebrities = PSI relationships are more readily formed between social media user and celebrities. On social media, celebrities build and strengthen more intimate relationships with consumers and fans. Simultaneously, the context of SCPs, supported by Web 2.0 social media technologies, stimulates users' parasocial interactions with celebrities and experts. Uncertainty reduction theory is an example of a way that this can occur. The process of repeated exposure to an individual gradually reduces the user's level of uncertainty, which increases the user's chances of liking this celebrity.Ballantine, P. W., & Martin, B. A. S. (n.d.). Forming Parasocial Relationships in Online Communities. Retrieved from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267374790_Forming_Parasocial_Relationships_in_Online_Communities. Repeated exposure to the celebrity gives users a sense of predictability in their actions, which engenders a sense of loyalty. Users who are immersed in celebrity-fans PSI may affirm their loyalty through various activities, including purchasing products endorsed by celebrities. Unlike influencers, celebrities bring their fans with stronger impulse purchase. Targeted consumers (fans) desire to interact with celebrities, instead of passively receiving information from celebrities. By purchasing and supporting the celebrity endorsing products, fans may build more intimate relationship with celebrities in their imagination. In a 2014 journal article, Seung-A Annie Jin and Joe Phua discussed how they conducted studies to determine multiple hypothesis based on the number of followers a celebrity had in correlation to the trust that imparted onto a consumer. This study was done in terms of a celebrity endorsing a product and the likelihood of the consumer to purchase the product after seeing the promotion. Consumers perceived the celebrity with a high number of followers as being more physically attractive, trustworthy, and competent. A high number of followers on the celebrity endorser's profile also significantly increased consumers' intention to build an online friendship with the celebrity. The study found that if a celebrity with a higher number of followers was perceived as more trustworthy, the consumer exhibited significantly higher postexposure product involvement and buying intention as opposed to those who were exposed to a celebrity with a lower follower count. Merchants on social commerce platforms will find huge potentials of analyzing and applying parasocial interactions to manipulate consumers' purchase intention. = PSI with companies = As social media relationships grew between celebrities and influencers, businesses created social media profiles for audience engagement. Fast food restaurants have started comedy Twitter accounts to interact with their customers in a personal way. The companies' Twitter accounts respond to tweets from customers, tell jokes and engage in the online industry in ways that create PSI with the consumers. This strategy is working. A study done by Lauren I.Labrecque in 2013 found that customers have higher loyalty intentions and are more likely to provide information for the brand when the brand fostered PSIs. The study also showed that these outcomes were less likely when the consumer felt the response from the company's social media account were automated. Furthermore, including personal details and behind-the-scenes ideation in interactions with consumers also triggers PSI and results in a positive impact.

Clone Being: Exploring the Psychological and Social Dimensions by Stephen E. Levick on page 107.  Limitations  Most studies find that PSI only occurs as friendship, which is overly restrictive theoretically and practically. It is common that people may build parasocial interactions with certain media figures, even though they do not consider to be \\"friends\\", such as a villain in a show. Though PSI with disliked figures occurs less likely than with heroes and positive characters, the situation of \\"love to hate\\" relationship with disliked characters still occurs. Some researchers realize the restriction of limiting PSIs as friendship, which may preclude them from capture broader situation of meaningful media user reactions. In 2010, Tian and Hoffner conduct an online questionnaire measuring the responses from 174 participants to a liked, neutral, or disliked character from the ABC drama Lost. All participants reported the identification they had perceived with the character, as well as the parasocial interaction and how did they try to change their perspectives to be more like the character. According to the whole sample, perceived similarity was a significant positive predictor of both identification and parasocial interaction. Undeniably, parasocial interaction was higher for liked than for neutral and disliked characters based on the study. Parasocial interaction still appeared with liked, neutral and disliked characters. The prevailing perspective of PSI as a friendship is not appropriate based on the theoretical and experimental findings, and many researchers start to improve the measurement of the PSI's concept. Future research One direction for future PSI concerns the advancement of methodology. As theories become more defined and complex, experiments seem to be necessary to be employed in testing hypotheses. Because the meanings of perception and emotion take up much of what parasocial interaction/relationship research interest, the cause and effect is hard to be distinguished and potential spuriousness is difficult to be avoided.Oliver, M. B., & Raney, A. A. (Eds.). (2014). Media and Social Life. Routledge. For example, whether similarity precedes PSI and whether mediated interaction create a sense of similarity requires experimental validation. Cohen (2001) also suggested that different types of relationships are encouraged to be analyzed by different genres, which particularly challenges scholars in examine the mediated relationship in those reality TVs (e.g., Survivor). These prototypical reality shows which are built around narratives, displaying a lot of emotions which seem to invite empathy and identification, and also demonstrating the characters' skills as to develop fandom. Ratings and audience responses provide strong evidence that those reality shows create significant mediated relationship, but future inquiries should examine whether this new kind of mediated interaction/relationship evolves or do these interactions/relationships conform to existing patterns. The influence of media in childhood has received little attention from developmental psychologists, even though children have a high degree of exposure to media. While many studies and experiments have explored the nature of parasocial relationships, there are many opportunities for future research. For example, a potential future area of research could be the issue of reruns, where the relationships have outcomes which are already known or well-established. In addition, another area of research could focus on production techniques or televisual approaches. This would include techniques such as chiaroscuro or flat lighting, the strategic placement of close-ups or establishing shots, deductive or inductive shot sequences, hip hop editing, or desaturation. These techniques have long been theorized to have some sort of influence on the formation of parasocial relationships, but their influence has yet to be determined. The prevailing use of social media and its impact on mediated relationships also requires further study of PSI (Agnew, 2013). Different social media platforms provide channels through which celebrities communicate with their followers easily, making parasocial interaction/relationships seem less unidirectional and perhaps more satisfying and intense. As such, whether social media has made PSI more a part of everyday life needs further exploration. Technological development has been raising questions regarding the role of PSI in our social lives, as media content is available in more places and times. Our mediated friends are never too far away, instead, they actually rest in our pockets and sleep in our beds. Whether this means that we spend more time and effort on cultivating these relationships and will be less dependent on real social relationships, needs further exploration. Other concerns include the continuity of media figures representation across various media outlets, and the notion of parasocial interaction as compensation for lack of social outlets. Popstars, for example, may not only appear on television, but on several different television or radio programs, as either a chat guest or a performer; further repeated viewings of these stars would intensify visual aspects of parasocial interaction with that star. Most research has typically characterized media users as a television viewer who is often solitary and in need of social interaction. The different types of user- figure interaction can be addressed by conceptualizing parasocial interaction as an extension of ordinary social interaction. Through close examination of social encounters that are significant for parasocial relationships, we can continue to distinguish between parasocial interaction an isolated activity and longer-term interaction.

Collins, 1899. p. 480 He left the Erie to go to the southwest to construct railroads, and he made the first survey for the Pacific Railroad west from the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains.Edward Harold Mott (1899, p. 350-1) Late 1860s he served as President of the American Society of Civil Engineers.  Biography  Kirkwood was born in Edinburgh, Scotland He graduated at the Edinburgh College,Proceedings ... Constitution and By-laws, Vol. 11 Brooklyn Engineers' Club, 1908. p. 57 and learned civil engineering on the Boston and Albany Railroad, an early work from which a number of engineers and contractors came to the Erie when it was building. Kirkwood had come to the United States in 1832 with letters to McNeill, who arranged work for him on the Norwich Worcester Railroad. He served on the Boston & Providence Railroad, and in 1835 became Assistant Engineer of the Stonington Railroad. In that same year he surveyed the route for the Long Island Rail Road, which was opened from the foot of Atlantic street to Hicksville in 1837. He had charge of the construction of that road until operations were stopped by the panic of 1837.Edward Harold Mott (1899, p. 321) In 1840 Kirkwood was Resident Engineer on the Mountain Division of the Western Rail Road., where he remained until its completion in 1843. He located and constructed the Springfield & Northampton Rail Road. In 1848 he completed the Starrucca Viaduct as Superintendent in one season; The Starrucca Viaduct near Lanesboro, Pennsylvania, considered to be the most expensive railroad bridge at the time, as well as the largest stone viaduct, and for its first use of concrete in American bridge construction. This success led to his appointment as General Superintendent of the Erie Railroad on April 1, 1849, where he succeeded Hezekiah C. Seymour. Only one year later at Erie Railroad, May 1, 1850, Kirkwood was succeeded by Charles Minot, and became Chief Engineer of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. the Pacific Railroad, and was responsible for the construction of the road from St. Louis to Pacific, Missouri. The towns of Kirkwood, Missouri, and Kirkwood, New York, are named after him. Late 1860s he consulted on and completed the Bergen Tunnel in 1858–9. At this time he was Engineer of the Brooklyn Water Supply, whose successful completion was largely due to his efforts. In 1865 he was appointed Chief Engineer of St. Louis, Missouri, in charge of the design of a state-of-the-art waterworks. He served in that capacity until 1867, when he was replaced by Thomas Jefferson Whitman, brother of Walt Whitman. In 1867 he moved back to New York and served as President of the American Society of Civil Engineers from 1867 to 1868. In the last years of his life he was consulting engineer at the Lynn, Massachusetts water-works.James Grant Wilson (1888) Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography. p. 557 In 1877 Kirkwood died in Brooklyn, New York at the age of 70 and was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.Jerry R. Rogers (2007) Environmental and Water Resources Milestones in Engineering.. p. 16  Work  = Starrucca Viaduct = 1920 picture of the Starrucca Viaduct. The Starrucca Viaduct was designed by Julius W. Adams and James P. Kirkwood and built in 1847-1848 by New York and Erie Railroad, of locally quarried random ashlar bluestone, except for three brick interior longitudinal spandrel walls and the concrete base portions of the piers and deck covering. This may have been the first structural use of concrete in American bridge construction. The viaduct was built to solve an engineering problem posed by the wide valley of Starrucca Creek. The railroad initially considered building an embankment, but abandoned the idea because it was impractical. The Erie Railroad was well-financed by British investors, but even with money available, most American contractors at the time were incapable of the task. Julius W. Adams, the superintending engineer of construction in the area, hired James P. Kirkwood, a civil engineer who had previously worked on the Long Island Rail Road. Accounts differ as to whether Kirkwood worked on the bridge himself, or whether Adams was responsible for the plans with Kirkwood working as a subordinate. It took 800 workers, each paid about $1 per day, equal to $ per day today, to complete the bridge in a year. The falsework for the bridge required more than half a million feet of cored and hewn timbers. = General superintend of Erie Railroad = View of Wall Street with Erie Railroad office on nr. 56. The first general superintendent, Hezekiah C. Seymour, came from Oneida County, and got the name on the road of the \\"Oneida Chief.\\" In 1849 a successor to Superintendent Seymour was to be appointed, as he intended to quit the service. S. S. Post was superintendent of transportation. He was in the line of promotion to the general superintendency, and as he was very popular with the employees, they were delighted with the prospect of having him as their superintendent. James P. Kirkwood was also mentioned in connection with the place. W. H. Stewart ran what was called the night line, and, in expectation of hearing the news somewhere along the line that Post had been elected superintendent, he had a big transparency, inscribed \\"S. S. Post, General Superintendent,\\" all ready to light and display on his train. The news came, however, that Kirkwood was the choice of the Directors, and there was great disappointment among the \\"boys.\\" This was in April, 1849. It is highly probable, though, that S.S. Post's long connection with the Railroad Company, and his popularity, would have secured him the place; if he had not shown an inclination to answer, in a non-committal way, queries put to him by the Directors, and a disposition to respond to them by asking questions himself. Superintendent Kirkwood became known among the railroad men as the \\"Silent Man,\\" from a peculiarity of his disposition. His office was at 56 Wall Street, New York. Audience with him was easily obtained, and as the caller entered, the superintendent would look up at him a moment. If the caller did not at once go on to mention the business that had brought him there, Kirkwood would turn his eyes back to his work without a word. Then the visitor might stand or sit there all the rest of the day without the Superintendent paying any more attention to him, or until the visitor broke the silence himself by speaking and making known his errand.Edward Harold Mott (1899, p. 405) See also * Compton Hill Reservoir Park * Long Dock Tunnel  Selected publications  * James Pugh Kirkwood (1867) Brooklyn Water Works and Sewers: A Descriptive Memoir * James Pugh Kirkwood, Saint Louis (Mo.).

The incident occurred on September 11, 1974, killing 72 of the 82 people on board. The scheduled flight was from Charleston Municipal Airport to Chicago O'Hare, with an intermediate stop in Charlotte. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the accident determined multiple crew errors were the primary cause of the crash. Accident On the morning of September 11, 1974, while conducting an instrument approach in dense ground fog into Douglas Municipal Airport in Charlotte, the aircraft crashed more than short of runway 36, killing 72 of the 82 on board. Thirteen survived the initial impact at 7:34 am EDT, including the first officer (co-pilot) and one flight attendant, but three of them ultimately died from severe burn injuries.Florence Morning News South Carolina , September 12, 1974. Archived at GenDisasters.com. Retrieved 2008-03-15. One of the initial survivors died of injuries 29 days after the accident.

The captain was 49-year-old James E. Reeves, who had been with the airline since 1956. He had 8,876 flight hours, including 3,856 hours on the DC-9. The first officer was 36-year-old James M. Daniels, Jr. He had been with the airline since 1966 and had 3,016 flight hours, including 2,693 hours on the DC-9. Crash investigation and recommendations While investigating this accident the NTSB reviewed the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and found that the flight crew engaged in unnecessary and \\"nonpertinent\\" conversation during the approach phase of the flight, discussing subjects \\"ranging from politics to used cars.\\" The NTSB concluded that conducting such nonessential chatter can distract pilots from their flying duties during the critical phases of flight, such as instrument approach to landing, and recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) establish rules and educate pilots to focus exclusively on flying tasks while operating at low altitudes. This rule, it was later realized, should also have been applied to takeoffs as was displayed by the lack of a sterile cockpit environment prior to the crash of Air Florida Flight 90 on January 13, 1982. The FAA, after more than six years of consideration, finally published the Sterile Cockpit Rule in 1981.The Sterile Cockpit NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System Directline, #4 : June 1993. Robert L. Sumwalt. Retrieved 2007-04-22. Another possible cause of the crash discussed by the NTSB in its review of the CVR was that the crew was apparently trying to visually locate the Charlotte airport, while executing an instrument approach in the presence of low-lying fog. In addition, a persistent attempt to visually identify the nearby Carowinds amusement park tower, known as \\"Carowinds Tower\\" to pilots, rising to an elevation of , or above ground level (AGL), may have further distracted and confused the flight crew. The first officer (co-pilot) was operating the flight controls, and none of the required altitude callouts were made by the captain, which compounded the flight crew's near total lack of altitude awareness. During the investigation, the issue of the flammability of passengers' clothing materials was raised. There was evidence that passengers who wore double-knit synthetic fiber clothing articles sustained significantly worse burn injuries during the post-crash fire than passengers who wore articles made from natural fibers. The NTSB released its final report on May 23, 1975. The NTSB concluded that the accident was caused by the flight crew's lack of altitude awareness and poor cockpit discipline.

The route connects the cities of Lexington and Winston- Salem to various recreational and natural sites including Uwharrie National Forest, High Rock Lake and Hanging Rock State Park. NC 8 is part of a two- state, 151 mile highway 8 system. Route description NC 8 begins with NC 740 at the intersection with US 52 and Gold Street, in New London. After a short concurrency with NC 740, it goes northeast to connect with NC 49, then travels briefly on divided four-lane through Rowan County and over the Yadkin River. After briefly serving as the northern perimeter for the Uwharrie National Forest, it splits with NC 49 and goes north to Southmont. Continuing north, it enters the Lexington city limits near I-85. Turning on Talbert Boulevard, it bypasses south of downtown Lexington, then continues north along Raleigh Road and the one-way streets of Fifth and Sixth streets. On the north side of Lexington, it connects with I-85 Business/US 29/US 64/US 70 before pressing on along Winston Road to Welcome, where it begins its longest concurrency with US 52\\\\. With US 52, it bypasses east of Welcome and west of Midway before entering Winston-Salem, where the freeway becomes known as the North-South Expressway. With a brief concurrency with US 311, it eventually splits from US 52 at Germanton Road, where it continues along north as a two- lane rural highway. After joining with NC 65, it crosses into Stokes County and enters Germanton. later, it splits north from NC 65 to meet-up with NC 89 and traverse through Danbury. Ending its last concurrency just north of Hanging Rock State Park, it continues north crossing NC 704 before ending at the Virginia state line. Continuing into Virginia, it becomes State Route 8, towards Stuart, Virginia. History NC 8 was established in 1930 as a new primary routing from Lexington, south to the Junior Order United American Mechanics (JOUAM) children's home, located near High Rock Lake. In 1936, it was extended further south to Abbot Creek, passing through Southmont. In 1939, NC 8 was extended southeast on new primary routing, crossing Abbot Creek, to NC 62. In late 1940, NC 8 was extended north, in concurrency with US 52 to Winston-Salem, then replaced NC 109 in Forsyth and Stokes Counties to the Virginia state line, where it continued on as already existing SR 8\\\\. Between 1945-1949, NC 8 was rerouted north of Winston-Salem, from Indiana Avenue, Cherry Street and part of Germanton Road, and onto Patterson Avenue. In 1953, NC 8 was extended southwest, with a short concurrency with NC 49 and replacing NC 6, to New London. In 1954, NC 8 was placed on one-way streets in downtown Winston-Salem, using 4th Street (southbound) and 5th Street (northbound). In 1960, NC 8 was moved from Main Street to Old Salem Road, in the Salem College area. In 1962, NC 8 was adjusted downtown Winston-Salem: northbound using Main Street-Fifth Street-Liberty Street, and southbound using Liberty Street-First Street. In 1967, NC 8 northbound was rerouted on a short concurrency with US 158/US 421 then north along a completed section of the North-South Freeway; NC 8 southbound remained unchanged until 1973, when the rest of the North-South Expressway was completed, eliminating its routing through downtown Winston- Salem. In 1972, NC 8 was adjusted from Third Street to Sixth Street in Lexington. In 1981, NC 8 was extended to Gold Street, then share short concurrency with NC 740 to its current southern terminus with US 52. In 1982, US 52/NC 8 was placed on new freeway west of Midway. Between 1991-1993, US 52/NC 8 was placed on new freeway bypassing east of Welcome.

It is one of the most important Baroque complexes in Naples. The church is located on a street of the same name just south of Via dei Tribunali and a few blocks south of the church of San Paolo Maggiore, Naples nave Within the courtyard of the monastery of San Gregorio Armeno in Naples. History In the 8th century, the iconoclast decrees in Greece caused a number of religious orders to flee the Byzantine empire and seek refuge elsewhere. San Gregorio Armeno in Naples was built in the 10th century over the remains of a Roman temple dedicated to Ceres, by a group of nuns escaping from the Byzantine Empire with the relics of St. Gregory, bishop of Armenia. During the Norman domination the monastery was united to that of the Salvatore and San Pantaleone, assuming the Benedictine rule. The construction of the church was begun in 1574, using designs by Giovanni Battista Cavagni, and consecrated five years later. A later consecration dates to 1674, and refurbishment to 1762.Le chiese di Napoli, Volume 1, by Luigi Catalani, Naples (1845): page 99. The façade has three arcades surmounted by four pilaster strips in Tuscan order. The interior has a single nave with five side arcades: the decoration, with the exception of the five chapels, was finished by Luca Giordano (also author of the Saints over the windows of the dome) in 1679. Bernardino Lama, likely the son of Giovanni Bernardo Lama, was author of the altarpiece. The interior houses also the famous Holy Staircase, used by the nuns during their penitences. The cupola was painted with a Glory of San Gregorio by Luca Giordano. The ceiling cassettoni or framed canvases depict the Life of the St Gregorio Armeno and were commissioned by the abbess Beatrice Carafa from the Flemish Teodoro d'Errico. On the right, the altarpieces include an Annunciation of Mary by Pacecco De Rosa, a Virgin of the Rosary by Nicola Malinconico, and frescoes by Francesco Di Maria. On the left, is a St. Benedict altarpiece by Spagnoletto. The main altar was designed by Dionisio Lazzari, and has an altarpiece depicting the Resurrection by Giovanni Bernardo Lama. The Idria Chapel houses eighteen paintings by Paolo De Matteis, portraying the Life of Mary. Over the chapel's high altar is a medieval icon, in Byzantine style, of the Madonna dell'Idria. The main attraction is the cloister (1580). In the centre is a marble fountain, decorated with dolphins and other marine creatures, with the statues of \\"Christ and the Samaritana\\", by Matteo Bottiglieri.

In his long career spanning both World Wars, he served as Chief of Mission in eight countries, as Assistant Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and married into Russian nobility. Career Armour was born in Brighton, England while his parents were vacationing there. He grew up in Princeton, New Jersey and graduated from St. Paul's School and Princeton University in 1909. In 1913, he graduated from Harvard Law School before returning to Princeton to study diplomacy. His first posts were to Austria in 1912 and France from 1915–1916 before formally entering the Foreign Service. =Russia= One of his first assignments in the Foreign Service was as Second Secretary in the United States embassy in Petrograd in the Russian Empire, beginning in 1916 (during World War I). After the collapse of Czarist Russia, the Bolsheviks seized control of the government and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central powers, which marked their exit from World War I. (These events precipitated the Russian Civil War which would lead to the formation of the Soviet Union in 1922.) Prior to the formal signing of the treaty, the United States partially evacuated their embassy, but Armour remained as part of the limited staff. On July 25, the Russian authorities ordered the diplomats out of Petrograd and a new legation was set up in Vologda. The North Russia Campaign, an Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War, further destabilized the situation and resulted in the legation becoming essentially under siege. (The Russian army had already attacked the British consulate and killed its Attache.) At this point, the order of events for Armour becomes somewhat unclear. According to news reports of the time, Armour was arrested and brought back to Moscow, where he and other Americans (diplomats and otherwise) were allowed to flee the country on August 26, by train to Sweden, arriving on September 5. Later, it was revealed that Armour had during this period used a fake Norwegian passport and, disguised as a courier, sneaked back into Petrograd and arranged for Princess Myra Koudashev of Petrograd to escape the country. Contrary to the contemporary reports, his obituary in the New York Times also says that he did not travel in the refugee train from Moscow, but rather escaped himself to Finland, still disguised as a courier, where he caught up with them. On November 2, shortly after they arrived back in the United States, the two announced their engagement. They were married February 2, 1919 in Brussels, Belgium. =Russian background of Mrs. Armour= Née Myra Sergueievna Koudashev, Mrs. Amour was a daughter of a first marriage of Tatar Prince Serguey Vladimirovich Kudashev, to a Russian Countess of the Nieroth family, being born in Saint Petersburg, 7 April 1895. Over the following years, diplomat Armour served in a number of embassies and consulates, including those in Belgium, The Netherlands, Uruguay, Italy, the United States Department of State (1922–1924), Japan (1925–1928), and France (1928–1932). =France= In 1929, after the death of Myron T. Herrick on March 31, 1929, Armour was made Chargé d'affaires and Head of the Embassy in Paris until the selection of a replacement. This was Armour's first time as Chief of Mission. He was also an extremely popular social figure in France and he and his wife were often written about in American newspapers, flaunting the Parisian high life. =Haiti= In 1932, Armour was elevated to Envoy and assigned as Minister to Haiti in the Caribbean. His primary responsibility there was to work toward returning the government of the country to native hands at the conclusion of the United States occupation of Haiti, which had been in effect since prior to World War I for some 19 years. He was selected for the position due to his fluency in French, but also as a sign to the Haitians that the United States would put a well-respected diplomat in their country. On August 7, 1933, Armour signed a treaty with Haiti \\"to return government functions to the Haitians by October 1944 and to withdraw the United States Marines stationed there by November 1944.\\" The plan succeeded ahead of schedule, as the Marines left the country on August 14, 1934. =Canada= After the death in office of Warren Delano Robbins, Armour was made Minister to Canada. His appointment to Canada so soon after his success in Haiti was meant to underscore Canada's importance to the United States, according to the New York Times. During his time in Canada, the State Department banned marriages between diplomatic personnel and the citizens of foreign countries they served due to potential conflict of interest problems. Though there were at this time 122 diplomats who had taken foreign wives, Armour's high-profile relationship with his highborn Russian wife and the way in which they were engaged were commonly cited by the press on both sides of the issue. =Chile and Argentina= In 1938, Armour was appointed as Ambassador to Chile, was a post in which he served relatively uneventfully. The following year, he was appointed as Ambassador to Argentina, as the Second World War was heating up. During this period, Armour worked to negotiate better trade relations with these South American countries, and, once the United States entered the war, to apply pressure on them to not support the Axis powers. One of the provisions of the treaty that he helped negotiate essentially cut off the supply of tungsten, essential for steels in armored tanks and in electrical lamps, to Japan from Argentina. Imports from that country to Japan accounted for half of that country's supply. However, Argentina refused to budge off key issues and remained ostensibly neutral. In 1941, Armour was made honorary director of the first Pan-American Games, which were to be held in 1942, but were called off due to the war. Near the end of the war, on January 26, 1944, Argentina finally caved to pressure from Britain and the United States and broke ties with the Axis powers. However, almost immediately after this, General Edelmiro Julián Farrell seized power in a coup from President General Pedro Pablo Ramírez. Both generals closely backed General Juan Domingo Perón, their successor from June 1946 to July 1974, who was President in three different periods: 1946–1952; 1952–1955 until a military coup ousted him; and from September 1973, after 18 years in exile, to 1 July 1974 when he died. As a result of this turmoil, the United States refused to recognize the legitimacy of the new government. Armour was ordered to remain in Argentina, but not to officially establish relations of any kind with the new government until a list of conditions were met. The United States officially suspended relations with the country on March 3, 1944, believing that the coup was backed by pro-Axis groups. Armour was officially recalled on June 27, 1944. After his recall, Armour was made acting Chief of the Department of Latin American Affairs, now probably integrated under the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs in the State Department, until his appointment the following year, on 15 December 1944, to Spain, presenting his credentials three and a half months later, on March 24, 1945. Spain and retirement In Spain, Armour continued to apply pressure on the government of Francisco Franco due in part to its support of the Axis powers during the Second World War. On his retirement on November 29, 1945 (formally, 1 December 1945), only 8 months afterwards, the United States further isolated Spain by refusing to send another ambassador until 1951. A resolution of the United Nations, document 32(I) 9 February 1946, commended General Franco's regimen, stating: in Spanish: During the period from December 1945 to March 1951, the U.S. embassy remained open with a succession of Chargé d'Affaires, namely Philip W. Bonsal from March 1946 to June 1947, Paul T. Culbertson from June 1947 to December 1952, and Stanton Griffis. The later Chargé d'Áffaires was appointed on February 1, 1951 again as an Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary presenting his credentials on March 1, 1951, just one month after his appointment, but he relinquished the charge on January 28, 1952, 11 months later. In 1947, Armour came out of retirement to serve as Assistant Secretary of State of Political Affairs under George C. Marshall. On July 15, 1948, he retired for a second time. In 1950, Armour was asked out of retirement again to serve as Ambassador to Venezuela. In 1954, he came out of retirement again to serve as Ambassador to Guatemala, a post he only served in for seven months. According to an interview in 1976, Armour indicated that he was proudest of his work in 1954, protesting Joseph R. McCarthy's attacks on the members of the Foreign Service who were suspected of connivance with communism during the ongoing Cold War, in his February 9, 1950 Wheeling Speech on Lincoln Day to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. With a Russian wife, no matter whether she was an exiled Tsarist times aristocrat descending from Tatar Princes settled at the Saint Petersburg corridors of power centuries before, there were grounds for deep suspicions, and as a Catholic member of the Democratic Party under Democrat Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. Armour died in 1982 and was buried in Princeton Cemetery. References {width=100% - valign=top           } External links *Norman Armour Papers at the Seeley G.

The predominantly Orthodox Jewish community falls under the jurisdiction of Shomron Regional Council. In , it had a population of . The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. In 2008, the New York Times described Yitzhar as \\"an extremist bastion on the hilltops commanding the Palestinian city of Nablus ... [where] a local war is ... being waged\\". The inhabitants of Yitzhar have a reputation as being among the most extreme Israeli settlers, and regularly clash with members of the Israeli security forces and local Palestinian civilians. The settlement is at the forefront of the settler movement's so called \\"price tag\\" policy, which calls for attacks against Palestinians in retaliation for actions of the Israeli government against West Bank settlements.Amos Harel, Revital Hovel, Jack Khoury,'Security sources: 100 followers of racist rabbi are behind hate crimes,' Haaretz 8 May 2014. In May 2014, Shin Bet said the price-tag hate crimes were mainly attributable to about 100 extremist youth, mostly from Yitzhar, acting on ideas associated with rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburg at the community's Od Yosef Chai yeshiva. History The settlement was originally established in 1983 as a pioneer Nahal military outpost, and de-militarized a year later, when turned over to residential purposes in 1984 with the assistance of Gush Emunim's settlement organization, Amana. The settlement continuously grew from a population of 200 in 1994 to almost 400 in 2002, and reached a population of 895 in 2009, predominantly strictly religious Jewish settlers. The Nahal settlement was called \\"Rogen\\", a play on words from the Hebrew root meaning \\"annoyance\\". The Hebrew term \\"yitzhar\\" was already used in biblical times (f.e. Deuteronomy 7:13), meaning \\"high quality olive oil\\", and derives from one of the region's major industries. According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated land from six Palestinian towns/villages nearby in order to construct Yitzhar: *495 dunams from Asira al-Qibliya,‘Asira al Qibliya Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 15 *282 dunums from Huwara,Huwwara Town Profile, ARIJ, p. 16 *233 dunums from Burin,Burin Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 18 *139 dunams from Madama,Madama Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 15 *114 dunums from Einabus,Einabus Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 15 *58 dunums from Urif.‘Urif Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 15 Geography Yitzhar is situated east of the Israel–West bank separation barrier, 20.5 kilometers from the Green line, in the mountain-range area about 10 km southwest of Nablus. One of the Jewish settlements ringing the city of Nablus, Yitzhar is built on the ridge of Salmen al Parsi, a mountain 808 meters above sea level south of Mount Grizim. The settlement has a total area of 1,663 dunams, and is zoned for over one thousand families in single family homes. Outposts Yitzhar has several unauthorized outposts which are illegal according to Israeli law. Lehavat Yitzhar, established in 1998, has ten families and five caravans, and six permanent structures. Shalhevet Farm (Yitzhar West), established in 1999, has eight families and thirteen caravans, and nine permanent houses. Hill 725, established in 2001 outside the boundaries of the parent settlement Yitzhar, has 23 inhabitants and six caravans, and two permanent structures. Mitzpe Yitzhar, established in 2002 outside the boundaries of the parent settlement Yitzhar, has six structures, and was dismantled in May 2004 for the third time, but in early 2005, it was re-established. Shalhevet Ya has three permanent houses and a caravan. On 21 August 2013, settlers razed Palestinian land with bulldozers to expand the Yitzhar settlement. They were protected by Israeli soldiers.Settlers raze Palestinian land near Nablus. Ma'an, 21 August 2013 Economy The settlement has, olives, vineyards, a winery, and wheat fields. Only Jewish labor is employed, and all private homes, community buildings, and internal roads and development are done by Jews only, mainly residents of the settlement itself, according to the Shomron Regional Council's website. Education Education is a priority of the community, and several institutions operate locally: a day-care center, pre-schools, the boy's Zilberman Talmud Torah, and the Od Yosef Chai (\\"Joseph Still Lives\\") institutions headed by Rabbi Yitzhak Shapira, comprising the Dorshei Yichudcha yeshiva high school, a post-high school yeshiva gedola, previously located in Joseph's Tomb Nablus, headed by Rabbi Yitzhak Ginzburg, and a kollel. The yeshiva, built illegally according to the IDF military prosecutor, supports the so-called \\"price tag\\" policy, and senior rabbis of the yeshiva are suspected to encourage students to attack Palestinians and Palestinian property, and the Israeli security forces. Several students affiliated with the yeshiva were forbidden to enter the West Bank on \\"well-founded suspicions that these students had been involved in attacks on Arabs, including 'price tag' attacks on Arab property\\". In 2003, rabbi Ginzburg who is a member of the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic movement, was indicted for incitement to racism in his book \\"Tipul Shoresh\\" (\\"Root Treatment\\"), which contains calls for the Arabs to be expelled from Israel, and for the land to be \\"cleansed\\" of foreigners, and compares the Arabs to a cancer. Previous demands to indict Ginzburg had been rejected by Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein in 2001, and following the 1998 publication of Ginzburg's book Baruch Hagever (\\"Baruch the Man\\"), which praised the mass murderer Baruch Goldstein. Ginzburg was offered an end to all criminal proceedings against him in return for his explicitly and publicly retracting his offensive statements about Arabs. In January 2010, Shapira was arrested for alleged involvement in the torching of a Palestinian mosque in the village of Yasuf, after five of his students had been arrested on suspicion of torching the mosque's carpet and book closet and obstructing the investigation. Shapira, who refused to say which of his students had taken part in the attack, was released a day after his arrest. An investigation into the book Torat HaMelech (\\"The King's Torah\\"), co-written by Shapira and rabbi Yosef Elitzur-Hershkowitz, which discusses the rules of war, and states that in certain situations, non-Jews can be killed, including babies of enemy forces \\"because of the future danger they may present\\", led to a police raid of the Od Yosef Chai yeshiva in Yitzhar. Police detained Shapira and Elitzur- Hershkowitz in Summer 2010 for questioning on suspicion of incitement to racial violence, possession of a racist text, and possession of material that incites to violence. According to Haaretz, Israeli security service Shin Bet is urging the Education Ministry to stop funding the Od Yosef Chai Yeshiva in Yitzhar. In 2009, the yeshiva high school received NIS 468,000, and the yeshiva gedola received NIS 847,000 from the Education Ministry. The yeshiva also got NIS 707,000 from the Social Affairs Ministry for a project to rehabilitate ultra-Orthodox drop-outs, and an additional NIS 156,000 to operate a dormitory. In January 2011, it was decided not to transfer funds to the yeshiva gedola, but after political pressure was applied, the yeshiva received a letter saying funding would be restored. Od Yosef Chai, for its part, is preparing to petition the High Court of Justice if its funding is halted. In November 2011, Israel's Education Ministry decided to withhold funds from the Od Yosef Chai yeshiva and close down the Dorshei Yehudcha Yeshiva high school. The decision was based on information received from the defense establishment of extensive involvement by students and rabbis in violent acts against Palestinian residents and Israeli security forces. Violent incidents The inhabitants of Yitzhar have a reputation as being among the most extreme Israeli settlers, and regularly clash with local Palestinian civilians. From the late 1980s through the next decade, Yitzhar youth were accused of arson at a local mosque, firing on Palestinian cars, torching Palestinian fields and olive groves, and rampaging through local villages. In 1989, two yeshiva students were convicted of aggravated assault, after a rampage led to the killing of a local 13-year-old girl, and injuries to an 82-year-old man. The settlement is at the forefront of the settler movement's so-called \\"price tag\\" policy, which calls for attacks against Palestinians in retaliation for actions of the Israeli government against West Bank settlements. A reserve officer serving in the area, commenting on incidents where Israeli soldiers were punished or attacked for carrying out demolition orders, is on records as stating: : > \\"You never know if a patrol in the community and its surroundings won't end > with a barrage of stones\\", says a reserve officer who served there. \\"And the > most irritating thing is that later on in the army, and in the community, > they'll feed you with the Shabbat cakes they bring and tell you to let it > be, because it's just a few psychos.\\"Ariela Ringel Hoffman 'Don't dismiss > Yitzhar settlers as 'errant weeds' ,' Ynet 8 May 2014. = 1998 = Two Yitzhar residents, Harel Bin-Nun, 18, and Shlomo Liebman, 24, were shot and killed while patrolling a track newly dug to expand the settlement, in an ambush by Arabs on 5 August 1998.Lionel I. Casper, The Rape of Palestine and the Struggle for Jerusalem , Gefen Publishing House, Jerusalem 2003 p.220.Fatal Terrorist Attacks in Israel Since the DOP (Sept 1993) Yitzhar settlers reacted by leading an armed funeral cortege past local Palestinian villages, and stating they would expand the settlement in two divisions named after the dead residents, a proposal that received the backing of Binyamin Netanyahu.Barbara Demick,'At Funeral For 2 Settlers, Call To Rethink Peace Talks There Were Shouts Of \`\`revenge. Settlers Vowed To Expand Itzhar After The Attack,' The Philadelphia Inquirer 6 August 1998. = 2004 = On 9 June 2004, a Palestinian goatherd complained that a resident of Yitzhar had stolen his goats. The police escorted him to the settlement, and returned the goats to him, but when he was getting back to his village, he was attacked by settlers, who once again took the goats from him. A police unit rushed down to arrest the settlers, while members of Yitzhar's readiness unit went down in the direction of the assault. The police claimed that the members of the readiness group blocked their way and interfered with their actions, and arrested the four men, accusing them of armed robbery, assault, stealing goats from a Palestinian, and preventing the police from doing their job. The four settlers filed a lawsuit that was partially accepted in March 2010 by the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court which ruled that the police had presented false and misleading testimony by declaring that the four men were involved in the assault and had stolen \\"the sheep\\", while they had not witnessed the attacks against the goatherd. The judge ordered the state to pay NIS 10,000 to each of the four plaintiffs, and to their lawyer. = 2008 = On 13 September 2008, a Palestinian entered the Yitzhar-outpost Shalhevet, set fire to an family's house who were away for the weekend, and stabbed a nine-year-old boy who had spotted him and tried to call for help, wounding him lightly. Dozens of settlers from Yitzhar responded by marching through the adjacent Palestinian village of Asira al-Qibliya, where the attacker was thought to live, using live fire and wounding eight people, and torching dozens of Palestinian homes and buildings, with Israeli soldiers present, in what then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called a \\"pogrom\\". One week later, a fourteen-year-old teenager from Asira al-Qibliya, was shot dead by Israeli border police while walking toward Yitzhar, intending to throw a Molotov cocktail at the settlement. Police later said they had identified him as the attacker of the boy, thanks to forensic evidence. = 2011 = In 2011, UNOCHA reported 70 attacks by Yitzhar settlers on Palestinians. Four inhabitants of Yitzhar were arrested on 13 June 2011 on suspicion of incitement and attacks on public order, including a minor suspected of setting fire to Palestinian property, after Israeli police raided the \\"Hakol Hayehudi\\" (The Jewish Voice) news site run from Yitzhar. On 2 August 2011, Israel Defense Forces' GOC Central Command issued administrative restraining orders against 12 settlers from Yitzhar and nearby outposts, and a student at the local yeshiva on suspicions that they were involved in attacks on Palestinians. Nine of the settlers were ordered to stay out of the West Bank, and three to leave the settlement. In response, the Israeli NGO B'Tselem issued a statement condemning the use of administrative orders which are issued without charges being filed, without trial and without judicial sanction, stating \\"the move is an unacceptable means of dealing with lawbreakers in the West Bank. Firm action must be taken against settlers who harm Palestinians and Palestinian property, but this must be carried out through the criminal-justice system and not by issuing administrative orders based on classified material.\\" After the IDF had razed two buildings in the outpost Mitzpe Yitzhar in December 2011, a mosque in the Palestinian village of Burqa near Ramallah was torched, and \\"Mitpze Yitzhar\\", \\"war\\", and \\"price tag\\" spray-painted in Hebrew on the mosque's exterior wall, and vandals thought to have come from Mitzpe Yitzhar had spray-painted slogans in Hebrew, including \\"price-tag\\", \\"Yitzhar\\", and comments insulting Muhammad, on the exterior walls of a mosque in the Palestinian town of Bani Na'im. = 2012 = Several incidents occurred in May and June 2012, many of them on Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath. A video of an incident of Saturday 19 May 2012, released by the Israeli NGO B'Tselem, shows a large number of young men from the settlement of Yitzhar descending towards the nearby Palestinian village of Asira al-Qubliya, young Palestinian men from Asira al-Qubliya coming out to confront the settlers when they approach the village, as well as burning fields later on, and heavily armed Jewish settlers shooting at and wounding a young Palestinian, with Israeli soldiers standing by and doing nothing to prevent the shooting. Yitzhar's spokesman said in a telephone interview with the BBC that \\"the incident had been started by the Palestinian villagers who ... had deliberately set fire to their own land in order to try and burn down the Jewish settlement\\", in what he called \\"arson terror\\", claiming that the settlers had gone down the hill to try and extinguish the fire, and were \\"attacked by hundreds of Arab rioters hurling rocks at them\\". Although it is not possible to tell who started the fire from the videos, it shows that there was no fire burning when the young settlers went down the hill. According to the BBC, the villagers of Asira al-Qubliya point out that it was their fields that were burned, and that the fire was much closer to their own village than to the Jewish settlement. The Israeli military issued a statement saying that it was investigating, and that \\"it appears that the video in question does not reflect the incident in its entirety\\". A week later, a Palestinian was shot and wounded by a settler from Yitzhar in clashes which started when a group of settlers set fire to fields belonging to the Palestinian village of Urif. In early June 2012, police opened a criminal investigation into two shootings, in which members of the Yitzhar rapid response security team opened fire in the direction of Palestinians during clashes between settler youths and local Palestinians, and confiscated weapons from five members of the security team. The Israeli NGO B’Tselem, which released video footage of both incidents, accused the IDF and Border Police of refusing to make settlers leave the area and of not acting to protect the Palestinians, but an IDF investigation found that the soldiers had acted correctly. A Palestinian and an Israeli security guard for the Yitzhar settlement were injured in clashes on 17 December 2012 outside the settlement, after a Palestinian shepherd approached the settlement and a group of Palestinians began hurling rocks at guards and IDF soldiers which responded with riot dispersal means. According to the Israeli NGO Yesh Din, who had a field worker observing the incident, masked settlers had started the clashes by throwing stones. = 2013 = On 1 April 2013, eight Palestinian schoolgirls were reportedly lightly wounded when their bus was attacked by stone-throwing settlers near Yitzhar. On 30 April 2013, a 31-year- old Yitzhar resident, Eviatar Borovsky, was stabbed to death at the Tapuach Junction by a 24-year-old Palestinian from a village near Tulkarm who had been released some six months earlier from an Israeli jail after serving three years in prison for throwing stones. In retaliation, settlers from Yitzhar reportedly smashed the window of a mosque in the village of Urif and tried to burn it down, set fire to fields in Palestinian villages, and stoned two buses carrying Palestinian schoolgirls, lightly injuring two girls and one of the drivers. = 2014 = On 8 April 2014, hundreds of Yitzhar residents attacked a Border Police force, hurling stones, burning tires, and vandalizing equipment. IDF soldiers were watching the scene without intervening, when settlers destroyed an army outpost.\\"Security source: Soldiers stood idly by as Yitzhar settlers destroyed army post\\". Jerusalem Post, 8 April 2014 The Border Police had come to the community to demolish five illegally built structures, after Yitzhar residents had punctured the tires of military vehicles in two earlier instances.\\"A settlement turns on its creators\\". Haaretz, 9 April 2014 The Yitzhar settlers subsequently destroyed an IDF post. After soldiers asked them to refrain from damaging their personal belongings, they complied with the request by restricting their damage to military infrastructure.Yoav Zitun ,'Jewish terror in Yitzhar may 'escalate to shooting soldiers' ,' Ynet, 9 April 2014.

Marie-France Garcia (born 9 February 1946 in Oran) is a French singer and actress. She is transsexual and a Parisian pop icon of the 1970s.  Biography  Marie-France was hired in 1969 by the Alcazar in the Latin Quarter, where she became as famous a celebrity as Marilyn Monroe. She remained one of the celebrities of that music-hall until 1987. She became a member of FHAR (Homosexual Front of Revolutionary Action), alongside Guy Hocquenghem. As a member of FHAR, she was interviewed in the magazine \\"Recherches\\" (special issue \\"Trois milliards de pervers\\" (3 billion perverts), 1973). She was a member of a small group, the Gazolines, with Hélène Hazera. The two performed in \\"Les Intrigues de Sylvia Couski\\" by Adolfo Arrieta (1974). Alain Z. Kan paid tribute to her by naming one of his songs \\"Marie-France\\" in 1976.

She pursued her acting career in theater, notably in Le Navire Night by Marguerite Duras in 1979. With the album 39 de Fièvre (39 °C Fever) in 1980, through several renditions of sixties pop (Gillian Hils, Johnny Hallyday, Sylvie Vartan, Rocky Volcano) and written Jean-William Thoury originals and composed by Dynamite Yan or Vincent Palmer, she captured the style of the rock group Bijou. She reappeared in the film Les Innocents (\\"The Innocents\\"), directed by Téchiné in 1987. In 1993, she recorded a revival of Édith Piaf, in a duet with Marc Almond, who rendered two songs to her. Daniel Darc and Mirwais collaborated on her eponymous 1997 album, for which she wrote the lyrics of a few songs herself. Dave then invited her on his album Doux tam tam in 2003. Frédéric Botton wrote several songs for her in 2005. At the end of 2006, Léonard Lasry invited Marie-France to sing a duet entitled \\"Du désir au bout des doigts\\" (\\"Desire at the Fingertips\\") as an homage. This song is featured on the first Léonard Lasry album, Des Illusions (\\"Illusions\\") (29 Music). Marie-France also published a duet with Hélèna Noguerra on her last album called \\"Fraise Vanille\\" (\\"Strawberry Vanilla\\") (released in October 2007). In 2008, Marie France recorded a rock'n'roll garage album entirely written by Jacques Duvall and composed by Miam Monster Miam. The album is called Phantom feat. Marie France and reminds her fans of the rock'n'roll Marie France of the 1980s.

The texts were canonized under this name during the 11th century AD, and from the time of the Song dynasty, were included in most military leishu. For imperial officers, either some or all of the works were required reading to merit promotion, like the requirement for all bureaucrats to learn and know the work of Confucius. There were many anthologies with different notations and analyses by scholars throughout the centuries leading up to the present versions in Western publishing. The Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty commented on the seven military classics, stating, \\"I have read all of the seven books, among them there are some materials that are not necessarily right ... and there are superstitious stuff can be used by bad people.\\" Members of the Communist Party of China also studied the texts during the Chinese Civil War as well as many European and American military minds.

Livedo reticularis appears as a bluish-purple, netlike mottling of the skin. Sneddon's syndrome may instead present with livedo racemosa, which involves larger, less organized patches of bluish-purple mottling of the skin. Both are generally found first in the extremities, both worsen in cold and either may occur without Sneddon's Syndrome or any other systemic disease. Sneddon's Syndrome can be characterized by: transient amnesia, transient aphasia, palsy, headaches, hypertension, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), stroke, coronary disease and dementia. The skin manifestations may precede the neurologic symptoms by years. Pathogenesis Sneddon's syndrome is a progressive, noninflammatory arteriopathy leading to the characteristic skin condition and to cerebrovascular problems, including stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), severe but transient neurological symptoms thought to be caused by cerebral vasospasm, coronary disease and early-onset dementia. Progressive compromise of arterial linings in Sneddon's produces clotting, for which high-dose warfarin is most commonly prescribed, and can also cause the development of systemic arterial plaque when cholesterol levels are normal. Diagnosis There are no diagnostic tests on which all Sneddon's patients will have abnormal results, although brain MRI and skin biopsy are often abnormal. The diagnosis is based on a detailed history and physical examination. About 40-60% of patients with the syndrome test positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. Treatment Sneddon's patients are generally treated with warfarin, maintaining a high INR of 3-4. Because most will experience significant relief of symptoms after several months of consistent INR in this range, treatment with warfarin is often used as a diagnostic tool. Epidemiology Sneddon's syndrome is a rare condition that is usually misdiagnosed. It occurs in families and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Sneddon's Syndrome most often becomes apparent in women in their thirties, though cases do occur in men and in children. Generally, Livedo precedes cerebrovascular involvement by roughly ten years, and many years of cerebrovascular involvement precede the development of dementia, when it occurs. History It is named for Ian Bruce Sneddon. In 1965, Dr. Sneddon first reported 6 patients with a distinct skin rash and cerebrovascular accidents (strokes).Sneddon's Syndrome was formerly understood to be a type of autoimmune disease called antiphospholipid syndrome, although it has been reclassified as a noninflammatory cerebrovascular disease. It should be considered in patients diagnosed with vasculitis when standard treatments fail.

Usually, a dissection is an arterial wall dissection, but rarely it may be a vein wall dissection (VWD). By separating a portion of the wall of the artery (a layer of the tunica intima or tunica media), a dissection creates two lumens or passages within the vessel, the native or true lumen, and the \\"false lumen\\" created by the new space within the wall of the artery. Description Dissections become threatening to the health of the organism when growth of the false lumen prevents perfusion of the true lumen and the end organs perfused by the true lumen. For example, in an aortic dissection, if the left subclavian artery orifice were distal to the origin of the dissection, then the left subclavian would be said to be perfused by the false lumen, while the left common carotid (and its end organ, the left hemisphere of the brain) if proximal to the dissection, would be perfused by the true lumen proximal to the dissection. MRI of an aortic dissection 1 Aorta descendens with dissection 2 Aorta isthmus Vessels and organs that are perfused from a false lumen may be well-perfused to varying degrees, from normal perfusion to no perfusion. In some cases, little to no end-organ damage or failure may be seen. Similarly, vessels and organs perfused from the true lumen but distal to the dissection may be perfused to varying degrees. In the above example, if the aortic dissection extended from proximal to the left subclavian artery takeoff to the mid descending aorta, the common iliac arteries would be perfused from the true lumen distal to the dissection but would be at risk for malperfusion due to occlusion of the true lumen of the aorta by the false lumen.  Types  Examples include: *Aortic dissection (aorta) *Coronary artery dissection (coronary artery) *Carotid artery dissection (carotid artery) *Vertebral artery dissection (vertebral artery) Carotid and vertebral artery dissection are grouped together as \\"cervical artery dissection\\". References  External links  Gross pathology Angiology ","title":"Dissection (medical)"},{"id":"5789270","text":"Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a flap-like tear of the inner lining of the vertebral artery, which is located in the neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms a blood clot, thickening the artery wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral artery dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan. Vertebral dissection may occur after physical trauma to the neck, such as a blunt injury (e.g. traffic collision), or strangulation, or after sudden neck movements, i.e. coughing, but may also happen spontaneously. 1–4% of spontaneous cases have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the blood vessels. Treatment is usually with either antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or with anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin. Vertebral artery dissection is less common than carotid artery dissection (dissection of the large arteries in the front of the neck). The two conditions together account for 10–25% of non-hemorrhagic strokes in young and middle-aged people. Over 75% recover completely or with minimal impact on functioning, with the remainder having more severe disability and a very small proportion (about 2%) dying from complications. It was first described in the 1970s by the Canadian neurologist C. Miller Fisher.  Classification  Vertebral artery dissection is one of the two types of dissection of the arteries in the neck. The other type, carotid artery dissection, involves the carotid arteries. Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the neck) or spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).  Signs and symptoms  Head pain occurs in 50–75% of all cases of vertebral artery dissection. It tends to be located at the back of the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone. Obstruction of blood flow through the affected vessel may lead to dysfunction of part of the brain supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary (\\"transient ischemic attack\\") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies the part of the brain that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation infarct. Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face. If the dissection of the artery extends to the part of the artery that lies inside the skull, subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur (1% of cases). This arises due to rupture of the artery and accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space. It may be characterized by a different, usually severe headache; it may also cause a range of additional neurological symptoms. 13–16% of all people with vertebral or carotid dissection have dissection in another cervical artery. It is therefore possible for the symptoms to occur on both sides, or for symptoms of carotid artery dissection to occur at the same time as those of vertebral artery dissection. Some give a figure of multiple vessel dissection as high as 30%.  Causes  The causes of vertebral artery dissection can be grouped under two main categories, spontaneous and traumatic. = Spontaneous = Spontaneous cases are considered to be caused by intrinsic factors that weaken the arterial wall. Only a very small proportion (1–4%) have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder, such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type 4 and, more rarely, Marfan syndrome. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type 4, caused by mutations of the COL3A gene, leads to defective production of the collagen, type III, alpha 1 protein and causes skin fragility as well as weakness of the walls of arteries and internal organs. Marfan syndrome results from mutations in the FBN1 gene, defective production of the protein fibrillin-1, and a number of physical abnormalities including aneurysm of the aortic root. There have also been reports in other genetic conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta type 1, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, α1 antitrypsin deficiency and hereditary hemochromatosis, but evidence for these associations is weaker. Genetic studies in other connective tissue-related genes have mostly yielded negative results. Other abnormalities to the blood vessels, such as fibromuscular dysplasia, have been reported in a proportion of cases. Atherosclerosis does not appear to increase the risk. There have been numerous reports of associated risk factors for vertebral artery dissection; many of these reports suffer from methodological weaknesses, such as selection bias. Elevated homocysteine levels, often due to mutations in the MTHFR gene, appear to increase the risk of vertebral artery dissection. People with an aneurysm of the aortic root and people with a history of migraine may be predisposed to vertebral artery dissection. = Traumatic = Traumatic vertebral dissection may follow blunt trauma to the neck, such as in a traffic collision, direct blow to the neck, strangulation, or whiplash injury. 1–2% of those with major trauma may have an injury to the carotid or vertebral arteries. In many cases of vertebral dissection, people report recent very mild trauma to the neck or sudden neck movements, e.g. in the context of playing sports. Others report a recent infection, particularly respiratory tract infections associated with coughing. Trauma has been reported to have occurred within a month of dissection in 40% with nearly 90% of this time the trauma being minor. It has been difficult to prove the association of vertebral artery dissection with mild trauma and infections statistically. It is likely that many \\"spontaneous\\" cases may in fact have been caused by such relatively minor insults in someone predisposed by other structural problems to the vessels. Vertebral artery dissection has also been reported in association with some forms of neck manipulation. There is significant controversy about the level of risk of stroke from neck manipulation. It may be that manipulation can cause dissection, or it may be that the dissection is already present in some people who seek manipulative treatment. At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, or no association.  Mechanism  A reconstruction of the vertebral arteries from a CT scan, seen from the front. From the bottom, V1 is from the subclavian artery to the foramina, V2 is from the foramina to the second vertebra, V3 is between the foramina until entry into the skull, and V4 is inside the skull embedded in the dura mater. They merge into the basilar artery, which then divides into the posterior cerebral artery. The vertebral arteries arise from the subclavian artery, and run through the transverse foramen of the upper six vertebrae of the neck. After exiting at the level of the first cervical vertebra, its course changes from vertical to horizontal, and then enters the skull through the foramen magnum. Inside the skull, the arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which joins the circle of Willis. In total, three quarters of the artery are outside the skull; it has a high mobility in this area due to rotational movement in the neck and is therefore vulnerable to trauma. Most dissections happen at the level of the first and second vertebrae. The vertebral artery supplies a number of vital structures in the posterior cranial fossa, such as the brainstem, the cerebellum and the occipital lobes. The brainstem harbors a number of vital functions (such as respiration) and controls the nerves of the face and neck. The cerebellum is part of the diffuse system that coordinates movement. Finally, the occipital lobes participate in the sense of vision. Dissection occurs when blood accumulates in the wall of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), allowing blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood. Once dissection has occurred, two mechanisms contribute to the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the flow through the blood vessel may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the vessel wall, leading to ischemia (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities in the vessel wall and turbulence increase the risk of thrombosis (the formation of blood clots) and embolism (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem. Subarachnoid hemorrhage due to arterial rupture typically occurs if the dissection extends into the V4 section of the artery. This may be explained by the fact that the arterial wall is thinner and lacks a number of structural supports in this section.  Diagnosis  Magnetic resonance angiogram of the neck vessels in a person with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV; it shows a dissection of the left internal carotid artery, dissection of both vertebral arteries in their V1 and V2 segments and a dissection of the middle and distal third of the right subclavian artery. Such striking episodes of dissection are typical for this \\"vascular\\" subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Various diagnostic modalities exist to demonstrate blood flow or absence thereof in the vertebral arteries. The gold standard is cerebral angiography (with or without digital subtraction angiography). This involves puncture of a large artery (usually the femoral artery) and advancing an intravascular catheter through the aorta towards the vertebral arteries. At that point, radiocontrast is injected and its downstream flow captured on fluoroscopy (continuous X-ray imaging). The vessel may appear stenotic (narrowed, 41–75%), occluded (blocked, 18–49%), or as an aneurysm (area of dilation, 5–13%). The narrowing may be described as \\"rat's tail\\" or \\"string sign\\". Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure, and it requires large volumes of radiocontrast that can cause complications such as kidney damage. Angiography also does not directly demonstrate the blood in the vessel wall, as opposed to more modern modalities. The only remaining use of angiography is when endovascular treatment is contemplated (see below). More modern methods involve computed tomography (CT angiography) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR angiography). They use smaller amounts of contrast and are not invasive. CT angiography and MR angiography are more or less equivalent when used to diagnose or exclude vertebral artery dissection. CTA has the advantage of showing certain abnormalities earlier, tends to be available outside office hours, and can be performed rapidly. When MR angiography is used, the best results are achieved in the T1 setting using a protocol known as \\"fat suppression\\". Doppler ultrasound is less useful as it provides little information about the part of the artery close to the skull base and in the vertebral foramina, and any abnormality detected on ultrasound would still require confirmation with CT or MRI.  Treatment  Treatment is focused on reducing stroke episodes and damage from a distending artery. Four treatment modalities have been reported in the treatment of vertebral artery dissection. The two main treatments involve medication: anticoagulation (using heparin and warfarin) and antiplatelet drugs (usually aspirin). More rarely, thrombolysis (medication that dissolves blood clots) may be administered, and occasionally obstruction may be treated with angioplasty and stenting. No randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare the different treatment modalities. Surgery is only used in exceptional cases. =Anticoagulation and aspirin= Aspirin (tablets pictured) is commonly used after stroke. In vertebral artery dissection it appears as effective as anticoagulation with warfarin. From analysis of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in reducing the risk of further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through a severely narrowed vessel) on transcranial doppler despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient. Professional guidelines in the UK recommend that patients with VA dissection should be enrolled in a clinical trial comparing aspirin and anticoagulation if possible. American guidelines state that the benefit of anticoagulation is not currently established. =Thrombolysis, stenting and surgery= Thrombolysis, stenting and surgery are not used as widely as anticoagulation or antiplatelet drugs. These treatments are invasive, and are typically reserved for situations where symptoms worsen despite medical treatment, or where medical treatment may be unsafe (e.g. an unacceptable bleeding tendency). Thrombolysis is enzymatic destruction of blood clots. This is achieved by the administration of a drug (such as urokinase or alteplase) that activates plasmin, an enzyme that occurs naturally in the body and digests clots when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for heart attacks and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic drug is administered either intravenously or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but its place in the treatment of VAD is uncertain. Stenting involves the catheterization of the affected artery during angiography, and the insertion of a mesh-like tube; this is known as \\"endovascular therapy\\" (inside the blood vessel). This may be performed to allow the blood to flow through a severely narrowed vessel, or to seal off an aneurysm. However, it is unclear whether the technical success of the procedure translates into improved outcomes, as in both cases the problem often resolves spontaneously over time. Stenting, as well as the insertion of coils by means of angiography, may be performed if there is an aneurysm and/or extension of the dissection into the V4 section of the artery. Surgery carries a high risk of complications, and is typically only offered in case of inexorable deterioration or contraindications to any of the other treatments. Various arterial repair procedures have been described.  Prognosis  Prognosis of spontaneous cervical arterial dissection involves neurological and arterial results. The overall functional prognosis of individuals with stroke due to cervical artery dissection does not appear to vary from that of young people with stroke due to other causes. The rate of survival with good outcome (a modified Rankin score of 0–2) is generally about 75%, or possibly slightly better (85.7%) if antiplatelet drugs are used. In studies of anticoagulants and aspirin, the combined mortality with either treatment is 1.8–2.1%. After the initial episode, 2% may experience a further episode within the first month. After this, there is a 1% annual risk of recurrence. Those with high blood pressure and dissections in multiple arteries may have a higher risk of recurrence. Further episodes of cervical artery dissection are more common in those who are younger, have a family history of cervical artery dissection, or have a diagnosis of Ehlers- Danlos syndrome or fibromuscular dysplasia.  Epidemiology  The annual incidence is about 1.1 per 100,000 annually in population studies from the United States and France. From 1994 to 2003, the incidence increased threefold; this has been attributed to the more widespread use of modern imaging modalities rather than a true increase. Similarly, those living in urban areas are more likely to receive appropriate investigations, accounting for increased rates of diagnosis in those dwelling in cities. It is suspected that a proportion of cases in people with mild symptoms remains undiagnosed. There is controversy as to whether VAD is more common in men or in women; an aggregate of all studies shows that it is slightly higher incidence in men (56% versus 44%). Men are on average 37–44 years old at diagnosis, and women 34–44. While dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries accounts for only 2% of strokes (which are usually caused by high blood pressure and other risk factors, and tend to occur in the elderly), they cause 10–25% of strokes in young and middle-aged people. Dissecting aneurysms of the vertebral artery constitute 4% of all cerebral aneurysms, and are hence a relatively rare but important cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  History  Spontaneous vertebral artery dissection was described in the 1970s. Prior to this, there had been isolated case reports about carotid dissection. In 1971, C. Miller Fisher, a Canadian neurologist and stroke physician working at Massachusetts General Hospital, first noted the \\"string sign\\" abnormality in carotid arteries on cerebral angiograms of stroke patients, and subsequently discovered that the same abnormality could occur in the vertebral arteries. He reported the discovery in a paper in 1978.  Notable cases  Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died on 27 November 2014 after developing a vertebral artery dissection as a result of being struck on the side of the neck by a cricket ball during a Sheffield Shield match on 25 November 2014. The ball struck Hughes on the base of the skull just behind his left ear which caused a vertebral artery dissection complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage.

It serves Cooke County, Denton County, and Montague County, Texas. History As with many of the early community colleges, NCTC began as an extension of the local school district. In NCTC's case, a branch of the Gainesville Independent School District known as Gainesville Junior College was proposed by Superintendent Randolph Lee Clark, who previously started a junior college that later became Midwestern State University. The Gainesville college was established May 20, 1924, and held its first classes in the fall of that year. For the first 22 years of the school's existence, it shared the same building with Gainesville High School, also sharing teachers and administrators (not until 1957 were separate teachers hired for the college). In 1946 a building located next to the high school was purchased and the college had its own building. However, by the mid-1950s the college grew to the point that sharing space with the high school was no longer practical. Local citizens passed a bond issue to build separate facilities for the college. However, discussions took place as to whether a separate entity, apart from the Gainesville ISD, should be created (including assessment of a property tax to support it). With the support of citizens such as W.T. Bonner (who donated the first of the current campus and later sold more to the college), Cooke County voters approved the creation of the new district, and Gainesville Junior College became Cooke County Junior College (the Junior was later dropped in the 1970s). In 1994, the institution's name was changed to North Central Texas College to reflect its increasing instructional offerings in two Denton County cities—Lewisville and Denton. During this time, NCTC operated under a \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" with the other junior colleges, and thus no separate schools were formed in neighboring Denton and Montague Counties. In 1992, president Ronnie Glasscock led the school to two major accomplishments. First, the \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" was codified into state law (however, neither Denton nor Montague are included in NCTC's tax base). Second, Glasscock lobbied for a name change, realizing that Cooke County College would handicap the college's effort to be a true regionally focused college. He was successful, and on June 1, 1994, the Regents voted to change the college's name to its current designation. In January 2000, NCTC opened a branch campus in Bowie (to serve Montague County). The citizens of Bowie voted a 1/2 cent sales tax increase to build the , $2.196 million facility. NCTC also opened the Corinth campus (to serve Denton County) at the same time. A historical marker outside the Administration Building claims that NCTC is the oldest continuously operating public community college in Texas, having been approved for operations in May 1924. This is based on the fact that several junior colleges which predate NCTC in terms of its opening either ceased operations (temporarily or permanently), were not founded as public institutions, or later became four-year colleges. *Stephenville College started in 1893 as a private institution, and became a public college in 1898. However, financial troubles led to its buyout by Texas A&M; in 1917, and it ultimately became Tarleton State University. *El Paso Junior College (no relation to the current El Paso Community College) opened in 1920. It ultimately became the University of Texas at El Paso. *Wichita Falls Junior College, which also has historical ties to Randolph Clark, opened in 1922. It ultimately became Midwestern State University. *South Park Junior College opened in 1923. It ultimately became Lamar University. *Four junior colleges (Carr-Burdette College in Sherman, Clifton College in Clifton, Gunter College in Gunter, and Wesley College in Greenville), all of which opened prior to NCTC, permanently ceased operations. *Weatherford College in Weatherford dates its history back to 1869, and can claim the title of oldest two-year college in Texas. However, it began as a Masonic institution and later became a Methodist school, operating as a four-year institution until 1921 when it reorganized as a two-year college. Even so, it was operated as a private institution until 1949 when Parker County took over operations. *Hill College opened in 1923, and has always operated as a public two-year college. However, Hill College ceased operations in July 1950 (though it never lost its charter to operate) and eventually re-opened in September 1962. *Jacksonville College in Jacksonville, Texas, opened in 1899 and has operated continuously since that time. However, like Weatherford College, it operated as a four-year college until 1918 when it reorganized as a two-year college. Also, Jacksonville College has never been a public institution, having been owned and operated by a Baptist denomination or organization since its founding. Campuses Gainesville campus The original location, the Cooke County Campus, is in Gainesville and is the main campus. NCTC maintains full-service campuses in Corinth and Bowie, with branch campuses in Denton, Flower Mound, and Graham. Organization and administration The current president of NCTC is Dr. Brent Wallace. Dr. Wallace previously served as the Vice-President of Instruction. As defined by the Texas Legislature, the official service area of NCTC consists of the following:Texas Education Code, Section 130.190, \\"North Central Texas College District Service Area\\". *all of Cooke and Montague Counties, and *all of Denton County excluding the cities of Frisco and The Colony, and those portions of the county included within the Carrollton- Farmers Branch, Celina, and Prosper school districts.

The original aluminium prototype appeared in 1953 as the 541 at the London Motor Show, although this changed to glassfibre for all production cars. Within a year, the new 541 had already earned rave reviews from magazines, notably Autocar, whose testers drove the grand tourer to a top speed of over . It was the fastest four-seater the magazine had ever tested at the time. The 541R employed a low-revving straight-six engine from the Austin Sheerline. The suspension system came from the Austin A70 with independent suspension by coil springs at the front and a live axle with semi-elliptic springs at the rear. The 541R, introduced in 1957, differed from the 541 by using rack & pinion steering instead of a cam- and-roller system, and large disc brakes were used on all four wheels. The car's styling was by Jensen's designer Eric Neale, and was not only considered attractive, but was aerodynamically efficient too; a Cd figure of only 0.39 was recorded, which became the lowest figure at Jensen. The body covered a chassis built by bracing 5-inch (12.7 cm) tubes with a mixture of steel pressings and cross-members to create a platform. The 1957 model carried the DS7 version of the Austin Sheerline's four-litre motor equipped with twin carburetors on its right side.

Historically, there were also narrow gauge railroads in Chiriquí Province (Ferrocarril de Chiriquí), which were abandoned in the late 20th century.Ediciones prensa.com BROKEN LINK  Panama Canal Railway  Panama Canal Railway Container train arrival at Colon Panama Canal Railway Passenger train in yard at Colon During the first half of the 19th century, travel across the Isthmus of Panama was difficult and dangerous. The need for a more reliable interoceanic communication grew stronger after the acquisition of California by the United States. The construction of a transcontinental railroad started in 1850 and the first train from coast to coast passed on January 28, 1855. However, more than twelve thousand workers probably died during the construction. The railway greatly assisted in the building of Panama Canal, which closely paralleled and in some places took over the rail line. Parts of the rail route were moved during the building of the canal, and considerable additions were made to the rail system. The rebuilt and improved Panama Railway beside the canal was completed in 1912. In 1979, the United States government handed over control of the Canal Zone and railway to the government of Panama. On 19 June 1998, the government of Panama turned over control to the private Panama Canal Railway Company (\\"PCRC\\"). The Panama Railway was originally broad gauge broad gauge, but when it was rebuilt in 2000, the gauge was changed to standard gauge . The route is long across the Isthmus of Panama from Colón (Atlantic) to Balboa (Pacific, near Panama City). As of 2015, Panama Canal Railway Company runs both passenger and freight trains between Panama City and Colón. Passenger service consists of one service in each direction Monday-Friday and the regular one way fare is US$25.  Ferrocarril de Chiriquí  Bridge of the Chiriquí Railway At the end of the nineteenth century, the government of Panama studied the feasibility of additional railroads. In 1910, Panama Railway was commissioned to estimate cost of a railroad from Panama City to David, Chiriquí with branches to Antón (Coclé Province) and Los Santos. The costs were however too high and the government decided to construct additional network in Chiriquí Province only. In 1914, a contract was signed for construction of a railroad David - Boquete - Concepción with a branch Dolega - Potrerillos and another short one to Puerto Pedregal. The railroad was inaugurated on April 23, 1916 with the first train from David to Boquete. (Dr. Alonso Roy) Edwards Rail Car company reports an undated acknowledgment of their three railcars, which were delivered to Ferrocarril de Chiriquí probably in the 1920s. After 1974, the infrastructure of Chiriquí Railroads was transferred to Ministry of Public Works (Ministerio de Obras Públicas) and operations were stopped around 1990. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the tracks of the defunct railroads are being dismantled and reused for construction of bridges in rural areas La Prensa February 21, 2003.  Chiriquí Land Company  Plantation tram probably on an excursion The Chiriquí Land Company was a United Fruit company involved in banana growing and real estate management in Panama. It also operated railroads that at their peak totaled about 300km, more than the Panama Railroad and FNC put together. Their primary traffic was bananas, but it also ran public passenger and freight trains. These were divided into two systems of similar size, both entirely narrow (3') gauge. The southern, in Chiriquí Province, was closed by 1988. The northern, in Bocas del Toro Province, covered Almirante, Changuinola, Guabito and parts of Sixaola. The last-mentioned section closed in 1999, leaving only the bridge over Changuinola River. The remainder was closed between 2005 and 2008. The railroad used General Electric engines ().  Trams  Two separate and distinct tram or streetcar systems operated in Panama City. The first started service on October 1, 1893, and ended during the Thousand Days' War. The second started in 1913 and operated, with reorganizations and company transferrals, until May 31, 1941. There have been proposals for a tramway system to supplement the Panama City Metro, but as of 2017 no construction has taken place.  Panama City Metro  Contracts were awarded in 2010 for line 1 of the Panama Metro in Panama City, with 14 stations. Service began in April 2014, and the first phase of line two began service in 2019, bringing the total number of stations to 29.  Panama City-David railway  The government of Panama and China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group are working to have a new high-speed railway between Panama City and David constructed, following the formalization of Panamanian-Chinese relations in June 2017.

It was founded by Milo Medin, cable companies Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI), Comcast, and Cox Communications, and William Randolph Hearst III, who was their first CEO, as a joint venture to produce high-speed cable Internet service through two-way television cable infrastructure. At the company's peak it provided high speed Internet service for 4.1 million subscribers in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and the Benelux nations (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg). The company operated as four joint ventures, three of which were international. In 1999, the company acquired Excite. In 2008, @Home was merged into Ziggo. History The passing of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 enabled cable companies to start offering Internet telephony services to customers. The company's first VP of Engineering and later Chief Technology Officer was Milo Medin, and the company got its start from venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. In December 1998, Excite was in merger negotiations with Yahoo! inc in an agreement to purchase the Excite portal for a price between $5.5 billion and $6 billion. On December 19, at Kleiner Perkins prompting, @Home Network's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Jermoluk met with Excite's chairman and CEO George Bell, according to documents filed with the SEC, and a deal was hashed out for the purchase of Excite and its debt. On January 19, 1999, @Home Networks acquired the Internet portal Excite. The $6.7 billion merger became one of the largest mergers of two Internet companies ever; the combined entity would marry the profitable high speed Internet network of @Home and expand its existing Home.com portal with Excite's money-losing search engine and Internet portal. The combined entity's external name became Excite@Home, however the stock symbol and regulatory filing records remained properly known as At Home Corporation (ATHM). As a side effect of the deal, @Home's chairman and chief executive George Tom Jermoluk (also called T.J. for short) stepped down as chief executive officer, but remained chairman of the board, and Excite's former chairman and chief executive George Bell, who was the president of the Excite division of @Home, moved over as chief executive of the new Excite@Home entity. The new Excite division took the existing @home.com web portal that was provided to subscribers of the service and merged it with the Excite portal. Along with this was the movement toward personalized web portal content, a concept now commonplace in all Internet portals today. In just months following the merger, Excite@Home's Excite division purchased iMall for about $425 million in stock. Most significant of these was the purchase of the online greeting card company Blue Mountain Arts, Excite@Home issued 11.2 million shares, worth close to $430 million, and paid $350 million in cash. In addition Excite paid for sponsorship of Infiniti IndyCar driver Eddie Cheever, Jr., through the 2000 and 2001 Indy racing seasons for an undisclosed amount. On June 10, 1999, the @Home cable division announced a joint venture with Australia with Cable & Wireless Optus to form a new company, AtHome Network Australia. The projected homes passed for the deal was 2.2 million. The merger between Excite and @Home fell disastrously short of expectations. The stock which once soared at $128.34 a share in the first quarter of 1999 and had a market cap of $35 billion had fallen to $1 a share by the third quarter of 2001 when the company formally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The new Chief Executive George Bell worked from his home in Massachusetts and the Chief Financial Officer Mark McEachen lived in LA, flying in only once per week to the Bay Area to conduct business. Both executives were part of the former Excite executive team. More significantly, expenses ran far ahead of revenues. The burst of the dot-com bubble in March 2000 and the subsequent collapse of the Internet advertising market further limited the company's prospects by making it harder to raise investor money to keep the company afloat in the absence of retained earnings. By 2001, the company was running out of cash. On September 21, 2000, George Bell stepped down as chief executive officer and reprised his role as president of the Excite division. The stock was trading at $15.38 a share, a drop of 90% of the company's evaluation during his leadership. On April 23, 2001, Patti S. Hart, the former chief executive officer of Telocity joined Excite@Home as its third CEO and @Home's fourth. In the same announcement, the outgoing chairman George Bell resigned and left the company completely. The news was not good, as the company also reported a first-quarter net loss of $61.6 million, or 15 cents per share, on revenue of $142.8 million compared with a loss of $4.6 million, or 1 cent, on revenue of $138 million in the same period the prior year. Excite@Home headquarters for sale. The buildings have since been re-purposed as a medical facility On June 11, 2001, Excite@Home announced what it had raised $100 million in fresh financing from Promethean Capital Management and Angelo Gordon & Co. Part of the deal not widely disclosed was that the loan was repayable immediately if Excite@Home stock was delisted by Nasdaq. The loan, structured as a note convertible into shares of Excite, had an interest rate of zero. The key aspect of the deal was that Promethean gained first dibs on Excite's assets. By August 20, 2001, @Home fired their auditor firm Ernst & Young, replacing them with PricewaterhouseCoopers. In addition, they received a demand for the immediate repayment of $50 million in debt by bondholders Promethean Capital Management and Angelo Gordon & Co. At the same time, both Cox Cable and Comcast announced that they would separate from the broadband Internet service by Q1 of 2002. On September 13, 2001, Excite@Home sold Blue Mountain Arts for $35 million to American Greetings, less than 5% of what they had paid less than two years earlier. On October 1, 2001, the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. The company's remaining 1,350 employees would be laid off over the following months into the first quarter of 2002. As part of the agreement @Home's national high-speed fiber network access would be sold back to AT&T; for $307 million in cash. At Home Liquidating Trust became the successor company to Excite@Home charged with the sale of all assets of the former company. After the company's demise, the four Excite@Home headquarters buildings at 450 Broadway Street in Redwood City, California, were purchased by Stanford University Medical Center, greatly remodeled, and reopened as the new home of the Stanford Medicine Outpatient Clinics in 2009. The shells were largely preserved, but the interiors are completely new, providing facilities that had been unavailable in the Palo Alto location. The buildings, plainly labeled Stanford Medicine, are easily visible from the freeway, U.S. 101, where the buildings labeled Excite@Home had previously been. Features Features of the @Home network were fairly standardized from cable provider to cable provider. All users of the service were granted email addresses which were (username)@home.net. Users were also given a special content-rich start-page on the Internet, which was specifically created for broadband speeds at a time when very few websites on the Internet were geared towards broadband users. Users were also granted access to other Excite websites such as Blue Mountain and their greeting-card by email service. Also as part of the @Home experience, users were provided with a special Excite@Home web browser which was essentially an @Home re-branded version of Internet Explorer with Excite@Home enabled features built within the browser. Additionally, besides the web browser users could also download the Excite@Home powered Instant Messenger, and @Home Assistant desktop widget, which had features like Excite's Search and current wire service news, along with an Internet radio portal known as \\"TuneIn\\" (which has no connection or relation to the current-day streaming provider of the same name).

Later, N.V. Energie- Distributiebedrijf Oost- en Noord-Nederland (EDON) (then called Essent) got full ownership of @Home Benelux BV, and the company was called Essent Kabelcom. In February 2007, Essent sold Essent Kabelcom to private equity firms Warburg Pincus and Cinven, and the company was once again called @Home (now without the 'Benelux'-part). On May 16, 2008, @Home merged with cable providers Casema and Multikabel into Ziggo, thus becoming the largest cable provider of The Netherlands.

The screenplay was written by Bruce Rubenstein and Rourke, under the pseudonym 'Sir' Eddie Cook. The film was released a month after Shakur's murder. Mickey Rourke was also the music supervisor of the film. It had limited distribution in theaters in the United States. It was shot in New York City in 1994 with a significant portion done in Brooklyn. Rourke and Shakur became friends on and off the set. Plot Butch \\"Bullet\\" Stein (Mickey Rourke) is a 35-year-old Jewish-American convict and junkie, who is released from prison on parole after serving an 8-year sentence for being an accomplice to a robbery, perpetrated by his friend, Irish-American gangster Paddy. After his release, Bullet and his best friend Lester (John Enos III) rob two teenagers for drugs. He also robs and stabs in the eye drug runner Flaco (Manny Pérez), telling him to let his boss Tank (Tupac Shakur) know Bullet is back. He returns to Brooklyn to live with his dysfunctional family, including his alcoholic father, depressed mother and his two brothers, the older mentally unstable Vietnam veteran Louis (Ted Levine), and his younger brother Ruby (Adrien Brody), an aspiring graffiti artist. Tank is a local drug kingpin with a score to settle after Bullet stabbed him in the eye while they were serving time together. Bullet seems to welcome the challenge. Tank first pressures Paddy to find and deliver Bullet to him. Later, he tries to have him killed by having one of Paddy's dealers sell Bullet drugs laced with poison. This fails when the drug spot is robbed by gunmen, one of whom stabs Ruby through the hand with a knife in the process. Over the course of the film, Bullet keeps himself occupied by shooting heroin and robbing his neighbor's house for jewelry, which he and Lester sell to an Italian-American gangster named \\"Frankie Eyelashes\\" (Larry Romano). He also encourages Ruby to follow his artistic dreams and has a deep friend-to-friend talk with Lester over whether Lester might be a closeted homosexual because of his mother abandoning him and his father's passing when he was a child, but he denies it. After the first failed attempt to kill Bullet, Tank gets one of his henchmen to start a fight with Bullet, which is witnessed by Louis. The fight ends in a draw when the henchman breaks his hand. Paddy figures out Tank's attempt to kill Bullet and that he is trying to play him and his associates against one another. He and his henchman Big Balls (Donnie Wahlberg) confront Tank about it, in the process killing two of his henchmen, including High Top (Michael K. Williams). Bullet briefly returns home where he tells his mother he's sorry for everything he put her through over the years. He later goes to a nightclub with Ruby and Lester. Paddy tries to help him escape because Tank is on the way to kill him. Bullet then accepts his fate when he is cornered by Tank and his men and has a final showdown with Tank, who shoots him dead to Ruby's horror. Soon after Bullet's funeral, Louis gets revenge by sneaking up on an unsuspecting Tank as he tries to enter his club and proceeding to cut Tank's throat, killing him. Louis then leaves Bullet's pet rat (named after Tony Curtis) on the dead body, exclaiming \\"Payback's a motherfucker\\" (a line which Tank said to Bullet when he had his henchman battle Bullet). The final shot of the film ends with Louis watching as Bullet's rat is about to feast on Tank's corpse.

Types include: *Cranial nerve root: the initial or proximal segment of one of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves leaving the central nervous system from the brain stem or the highest levels of the spinal cord. *Spinal nerve root: the initial or proximal segment of one of the thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves leaving the central nervous system from the spinal cord. Each spinal nerve is formed by the union of a sensory dorsal root and a motor ventral root, meaning that there are sixty-two dorsal/ventral root pairs, and therefore one hundred and twenty four nerve roots in total, each of which stem from a bundle of nerve rootlets (or root filaments). Pain and pathologies Damage to nerve roots can cause paresis and paralysis of the muscle innervated by the affected spinal nerve. It can also cause pain and numbness in the corresponding dermatome. A common cause of damage to the nerve roots are lesions in the spine, such as prolapse of the nucleus pulposus, spinal tuberculosis, cancer, inflammation, spinal tabes. Root pain syndromes, known colloquially as radiculitis, sciatica are one of the most common symptoms caused by damage to the nerve root. Radiculopathy is commonly called the \\"root\\". In addition to pain, nerve damage may also bring about impaired muscle control. Typically, mechanical dysfunction is caused by pressure on the nerve root or shock can affect both the roots of the lower limbs and arms. The first sign of disease, sometimes before a few years, the occurrence of radicular syndrome are pain in the neck and shoulder area. Usually, the pain occurs as a consequence of a cold or hypothermia, sometimes calls it load, poor working posture or sleep, sudden movement of the head. Teams root localized mostly within the three lower cervical roots C5, C6, C7. =Symptoms= *Forced, reflexive position of the spine (the slope and a slight twist in the opposite direction has fallen Root) *Paraspinal muscle contracture *Reduction of cervical lordosis *Numerous painful points on the edges of the blade *Pain at the back of the head slope *Pain radiating to the upper chest and shoulder area *The positive sign of nerve root tension in the upper limbs (not always) Upper limb radiculopathies =C5 radiculopathy= *Pain is found along the lateral brachium of the affected side of the arm. *C5 innervated muscle weakness may be found (e.g., rhomboids, deltoid). =C6 radiculopathy= *Pain is found along the lateral antebrachium of the affected arm *C6 innervated muscles are weak (e.g., forearm pronator and supinators, wrist extensors). =C7 radiculopathy= *Pain is found along the middle finger of the affected arm *C7 innervated muscle weakness is found (e.g., wrist flexors, finger extensors). =Treatment= Treatment should be initiated as early as possible, before any increase in muscle tone, which further intensifies the pain. Traction is recommended to decompress a compressed roots. Radiculopathy can be caused by herniated nucleus pulposus. Surgery is the last resort when conservative therapy is unsuccessful. Lower limb radiculopathies Often on a single nerve root, the cause is a herniated intervertebral disc. The first harbinger of roots is usually lumbago. The disease usually occurs with periods of remission. From the first symptoms to develop a full radicular syndrome may take several months or several years. Pain increases gradually, but it can also be sudden. Cold causes muscle contraction, which leads to increased previously hidden symptoms. =Symptoms= *Scoliosis *Paraspinal muscle contracture *The reduction of lumbar lordosis =L4 radiculopathy= *Pain located on the front of the thigh and shin, further radiates towards the inner ankle, sometimes the medial toe *Occasionally, failure of the quadriceps muscle and reflex weakness =L5 radiculopathy= *Pain radiates to the side of the thigh and lower leg towards the back of the foot and toes 1-3 *All reflexes are preserved =S1 radiculopathy= *Pain radiates to the posterior side of the thigh and lower leg to the ankle side, sometimes up to the fourth toe *Gluteal muscles are weakened *Difficulty standing on toes =Treatment= The treatment team is dependent on the root of the abnormality and the stage of the disease. In the acute phase, in order to unlock the nerve root is recommended to apply traction and isometric muscle relaxation. In cases where the manipulation is undesirable or impossible to carry out the infiltration may be root. In the case of the severe pain, this procedure should be carried out first. It is helpful to the administration of anti-inflammatory drugs. In the acute setting, the main goal is to restore proper mobility by not producing pain, individually selected physiotherapy. Surgery is used when other methods do not produce results. The exception is when paralysis is observed; in those cases, surgery should be performed as soon as possible to avoid irreversible paralysis of muscles. A new method of treating herniated discs is the direct cause of any root is termonukleoplastic, the treatment consisting in introducing into the annulus fibrous of a special catheter tip heating. Warming up for a few minutes end to 65 °C results in the destruction of pain- sensitive nerve endings within the fibrous ring, reducing the volume of disk space and alleviate inflammation associated chronic irritation.

Description  The standard game of Militaire was played with a 54-card pack comprising cards each portraying a rank badge of the British Army and a card value in points. There were 4 cards each of all the officer ranks - General (60 points), Brigadier (50), Colonel (45), Lieutenant Colonel (40), Major (35), Captain (30), Lieutenant (25) and 2nd Lieutenant (20) - and 7 cards each of the Other Ranks: Sergeant (15), Corporal (10) and Lance Corporal (5). In addition, there was a single card depicting the rank of Sergeant Major (5 – 60 points) which acted as a wild card or 'master card'. The pocket version of Militaire only had 40 cards: 3 of each officer rank, 5 of each other rank and 1 sergeant major wild card. The rules were the same, except that sets of 4 were only possible with the cards of the other ranks. The patience-sized cards measure 70 x 45 mm, whereas the standard cards measure 85 x 56 mm.  Rules  The game was designed for three or four players; two packs were to be used if there were five or more. Deal and play were clockwise. Players cut for first dealer and then 7 cards were dealt to each player. The remainder were stacked face down in the middle of the table and the top card turned and placed beside the stock to start the discard pile. The aim was to form sets of 3 or 4 cards of the same rank or runs of at least 3 cards in rank sequence. Eldest hand began by drawing the upcard or the top card of the stock and then discarding a card to the discard pile. On completing a valid set or run, a player could meld it to the table, face up, and score points based on the card values. The first player to expose a complete hand of 2 sets or a run and a set or a run of 6-7 cards won and scored the following bonus points in addition to his card points: * Set of 3 - 30 points * Set of 4 - 40 points * Run of 3 - 10 points * Run of 4 - 20 points * Run of 6 - 50 points * Run of 7 - 100 points If the seventh card was unused, the holder incurred penalty points to its value. Other players only scored the value of sets or runs they meld to the table. Scores were kept on a cribbage-style scoring board. Players could play an agreed number of deals, known as a \\"rubber\\".Rule set accompanying the Militaire card game.  Variant  The rules described a variant played for stakes by four or more players in which a discarded card not immediately picked up by the following player could be bid for by the remainder and exchanged for any hand card; the winning bidder paying the amount of the bid to the pool which was taken by the winner of the rubber.

History Last standing building in Stanley Gold was found in nearby Lightning Creek in 1861 resulting in the towns of Stanley and Van Winkle springing up as part of the Cariboo Gold Rush. Stanley is located in the Cariboo region of British Columbia’s central interior. Stanley can be found by following Highway 26 east from the city of Quesnel. A 45-minute drive along Highway 26 passes by the appropriately named Stanley Road on which the town of Stanley was located. Stanley once had a sprawling population that surpassed the town of Barkerville at one time due to the gold in the area. Passing by the vicinity one would not even know that there was ever a bristling town full of gold-hungry prospectors and their families. A lone building that is now being renovated is the little visible evidence from the gravel road that there was anything ever there. But just a few steps into the now thick underbrush reveals plenty of evidence of the town of Stanley. An abundance of scrap wood, metal and remnants of buildings can be seen buried in the brush and earth. By the end of the 19th century (1800s), Stanley had a population that surpassed the nearby town of Barkerville; Over half the population of Stanley consisted of Chinese. =Last Standing Building in Stanley, The Lightning Hotel= Because of its longevity, much has been written about the Lightning Hotel from its arrival at its current site in 1873. It was originally brought down from the town of Richfield during a great fire that destroyed most of the town. The building was saved by a bucket brigade. Then moved on skids from Richfield to its present location. The first proprietor, William Houseman, locally nicknamed The Duke of York, renamed his Yorkville Saloon to The Lightning Hotel. The hotel had many owners from William Ellis, John Lowe, William Morgan Len Ford James.A.Rawson. Also super chef and confectioner Hannah Williams owned it until 1947 at the time of her death. There is some speculation that the hotel burned down in 1924 and was rebuilt on its original site from buildings purchased by Jimmy Williams at the defunct La Fontaine Mine. During the early 1900s an additional wing (which was the mirror image of the original structure) was built doubling the size of the building. This addition had all the hallmarks of a building built in the 1920s lending to the further confusion of the date of the original building. The 1920s addition disappeared sometime between 1970 and 1990, leaving the current structure all that remains of the Lightning Hotel. The current construction bears all the 'trait's' of a building of the late 19th century. Hotels of the 1800s were no larger than the building currently standing. In addition, a building such as the one that stands today would never have been found in a mining camp. It was purchased by prominent Vancouver mining executive Jack LaFleur and his wife Nita who opened it in 1967 for the centennial year. After that, the building was closed and slowly fell into disrepair with the second half of the building (built in the early 1900s) disappearing completely. In 1996, Jack and Nita LaFleur's son, Mark LaFleur and his business partner Lawrence Adams took on the job of restoring the property by giving it a new foundation and securing it structurally. The work was done by Mr. Howard Berlin. The restoration process continues today. Stanley Cemetery Stanley Cemetery Overlooking the town of Stanley is the old Stanley Cemetery located atop a hill. The graveyard holds some pioneers of the gold rush area along with some later expired residents. At first glimpse, it seems as though grave robbers may have dug up some of the plots and took the bones but the graves belonged to Chinese gold miners whose remains were shipped back to their birthplace. Stanley Cemetery The old cemetery is gradually becoming a part of the land, as is the town of Stanley. The Stanley cemetery is maintained only by donations which shows in the deterioration. =Occupying the Stanley Cemetery= Daisy Gardner, Mearl Gardner and Mary Gardner’s first baby daughter. =Mountain Pine Beetle and the Stanley Cemetery= The Cariboo region of British Columbia was ravaged by the Mountain Pine Beetle in which Stanley lies. In 2005, the beetle kill trees were harvested around the Stanley cemetery and area for the safety of the visitors and to reduce the threat of forest fire. In the process of logging the beetle kill trees, the fencing surrounding the Stanley cemetery and some of the individual burial plots where damaged by the fallen trees. The damaged fencing was not repaired afterwards. In 2007, some minor restoration work was done to the area fencing.

It takes its name from the boundary separating reality from religious truth, a boundary epitomized by Prester John's Sea of Dust.  Production  A stylistic tribute to the sixties work of Hammer Films and Italian genre director Mario Bava, Sea incorporates the Prester John myth into its heady stew of surrealism, social satire, and comic invention. Pitt went as far as to call her final screen appearance \\"one of the best films I ever worked on.\\" While the tongue-in-cheek \\"horror\\" film garnered largely positive reviews in the genre press, including such publications as Canada's Rue-Morgue, the U.K.'s Gorezone, and America's Fangoria, its Midnight Movie structure and social critiques also served to polarize audiences. The film can be read as a dark satire of George W. Bush's War on Terror and the rise of Neo-Con politics, as well as a Lynchian fable of sexual repression. \\"(SEA is) at once a black slapstick comedy, a twisted horror tale, a stylish period piece and a biting religious satire,\\" wrote Fangoria. Originally shot in 2006-2007, Sea of Dust suffered post-production delays attributable to the illness of star Ingrid Pitt, which caused extensive structural revisions (detailed in the Region 1 DVD commentary). Regardless, the film obtained strong festival response, winning both the Rhode Island International Film Festival and Fright Night Film Fest, and opening Fangoria's Trinity of Terrors in Las Vegas in 2009. Sea of Dust also gained the support of cult directors Jean Rollin and Ken Russell, no strangers to the incorporation of surreal elements into a horror context, which boosted the film's standing. In August 2010, Sea of Dust was released in North America by Cinema Epoch DVD. This package included three trailers, all of which would be banned when the film went to cable TV. Despite the film's satiric intent, the trailers were deemed \\"too bloody\\" for mass consumption, as was a fourth that had been created as a tribute to Ingrid Pitt (who passed in November, 2010). The same month marked the publication of the McFarland Press book, \\"Ingrid Pitt, Queen of Horror,\\" by Bobb Cotter. Mr. Cotter called Sea of Dust \\"one of the strongest anti- intolerance statements made in recent film history\\" and one of Ingrid Pitt's \\"best latter-day showcases.\\"  Reception  Sea of Dust garnered largely positive reviews in the horror press upon its initial release. Rue Morgue Magazine called the film: “Truly original…Several British period fright flicks feature religious zealotry (Witchfinder General and The Devils for starters), but SEA OF DUST may be the most mind-bending one yet. Literally!\\" Nathaniel Thompson, editor of the four volume DVD Delirium series, wrote: \\"Sea of Dust ambitiously sets its sights on a complex, mindbending story about the extremities of moral conviction framed like a nasty fairy tale...sort of a clash between The Saragossa Manuscript and Kill, Baby, Kill with a hefty dose of gore.\\" Bloody-Disgusting also commented upon the film's surrealist touches: “It‟s like David Lynch and Hammer Horror got together, did a bunch of ecstasy and read the Bible. Nothing else in modern horror looks or feels like it. Gore hounds will be pleasantly surprised by the sheer amount of excess.\\" Michael Den Boer of 10,000 Bullets called the film: “First rate. It is refreshing to finally come across a horror film that goes against the grain. SEA OF DUST is a metaphysical horror film that takes a few viewings to fully digest.\\" Additionally, Sea of Dust performed admirably on the film festival circuit. Sea of Dust won the \\"Best Picture Grand Prize\\" at the 2008 Rhode Island International Horror Film Festival. In 2009, Sea of Dust won the \\"Best of the Fest\\" at Louisville's Fright Night Film Fest. The film also opened the Fangoria Trinity of Terrors Film Festival in October of that year. Issues with the film's distribution resulted in its producers withdrawing SEA OF DUST from public exhibition thereafter. Since 2009, has only been screened publicly on two occasions. In each, the film has received additional awards. In 2013, Sea of Dust was projected at Parafest at the Sands Hotel & Casino in Bethlehem, where it won the \\"Audience Choice Best Feature Award\\" and \\"Best Poster Award.\\" The latter provided long overdue recognition for multi-media artist Stephen Romano, whose projects included the illustrated \\"Shock Festival\\" novel and the Incident On and Off a Mountain Road episode of Showtime’s Emmy Award-winning Masters of Horror cable series (directed by Don Coscarelli). In 2014, Sea of Dust appeared at the Macabre Faire Film Festival in Long Island, New York where it again received the \\"Audience Choice Best Feature Award\\" as well as the \\"Best Cinematography Award.\\"  References   External links   American supernatural horror films American films 2008 films 2008 horror films ","title":"Sea of Dust (film)"},{"id":"5789608","text":"Kozłówka may refer to the following places: *Kozłówka, Lublin Voivodeship (east Poland) *Kozłówka, Podlaskie Voivodeship (north-east Poland) *Kozłówka, Masovian Voivodeship (east-central Poland) ","title":"Kozłówka"},{"id":"5789617","text":"Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana, commonly called the coligallo palm (Spanish for rooster tail, a reference to the form of the leaf), is an understory palm native to Central America and southern Mexico,Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesPérez J., L.

The leaves are undivided, or pinnate with 3-9 leaflets, the terminal leaflet with a forked apex. The flowers are produced all year round, on upright inflorescences; they are monoecious, with complete temporal separation of the male and female stages. The flowers are pollinated by bats in the family Phyllostomidae. Because the flowers are made of a sweet chewable tissue (like the pulp of a fruit) they are much favoured by katydids (Tettigoniidae), whose feeding reduces the number of flowers available to be pollinated. The inflorescences host a species of mite (Acari) which live and reproduce on the inflorescence and travel to new inflorescences by hitching a ride on the flower-visiting bats. The behaviour of parasitising another animal for transport but not food is known as phoresy. A similar phenomenon which has been more comprehensively surveyed are the mites that live in flowers visited by hummingbirds and are phoretic on these flower-visiting birds.

The individual games are Poker Face Paul's Blackjack, Poker Face Paul's Gin, Poker Face Paul's Poker, and Poker Face Paul's Solitaire. Summary =Blackjack= Poker Face Paul's Blackjack is a card game where the player starts out with a certain amount of money on the Las Vegas Strip and play in a series of blackjacks games to either win big or bust. The player can choose to play in four different casinos and can select options on how they play including how much bets are worth and how many decks are used. The game will also help the player out with the rules and regulations of blackjack. =Solitaire= There are four different versions of solitaire to play (Klondike, Monte Carlo, Eleven and Calculation) each with their own look and set of rules. There are in-game instructions as well as hints that will help out the player as the progress. Players can turn these hints on or off as well as change time limit (ten minutes, eight minutes, seven minutes, six minutes, or disabled). =Poker= There are two versions of Poker to choose from: the standard five-card stud where the player competes against computer opponents in an attempt to get a good hand such as a straight, flush, etc. Video poker is the second option where the player goes at it alone, but still with the same objective as five-card stud trying to assemble a winning hand, however since the player is alone they receive a certain amount of money according to the hand they assemble. There are also instructions that help the player out. =Gin= The player can choose from three different players with each being a level of difficulty: Jack is the easiest and has the player learn the basics, Jane is a medium setting and a little harder while Ming is the hardest setting. Players can also customize a variety of options including rule settings and can learn the basics of Gin through a built-in strategy that is essentially a learning tool. Reception In their July 1994 issue GamePro reviewed all of the Poker Face Paul games except Gin. They gave Poker a mostly negative review and outright panned both Blackjack and Solitaire, remarking that all three games suffer from poor graphics and sounds, and that aside from Poker they offer less fun than can be had by playing the game with a real deck of cards, which also cost far less than a Game Gear cartridge.

The manufactory had its immediate origins in a carpet manufactory established in a former soap factory (French savon) on the Quai de Chaillot downstream of Paris in 1615 by Pierre DuPont, who was returning from the Levant. Under a patent (privilège) of eighteen years, a monopoly was granted by Louis XIII in 1627 to DuPont and his former apprentice Simon Lourdet, makers of carpets façon de Turquie (\\"in the manner of Turkey\\"). Until 1768, the products of the manufactory remained exclusively the property of the Crown, and Savonnerie carpets were among the grandest of French diplomatic gifts.The ambassadors of Russia, Spain, Denmark, Siam and even an unauthorized \\"ambassador\\" from Persia were all presented with Savonnerie carpets (Standen). The carpets were made of wool with some silk in the small details, knotted using the Ghiordes knot, at about ninety knots to the square inch. Some early carpets broadly imitate Persian models, but the Savonnerie style soon settled into more purely French designs, pictorial or armorial framed medallions, densely massed flowers in bouquets or leafy rinceaux against deep blue, black or deep brown grounds, within multiple borders. History of the manufacture Ottoman Court carpet, late 16th century, Egypt or Turkey. The pre-history of the Savonnerie manufacture lies in the concerns of Henri IV to revive the French luxury arts, which had collapsed in the disorders of civil violence in the Wars of Religion. French silver was being drained to the Levant and Persia for the purchase of knotted-pile carpets. Among the craftsmen the king provided with studios and workshops in the galleries of the Louvre itself, was Pierre Dupont. Dupont's La Stromatourgie, ou Traité de la Fabrication des tapis de Turquie (\\"Treaty on the manufacture of Turkish carpets\\", Paris 1632) is a prime source for information on French carpet manufacturing in the early seventeenth century (Standen). Dupont and Lourdet fell into a quarrel that lasted into the next generation. The tapestry-workers were orphan children provided by the Hôpital de Bon Port, and Lourdet gained possession of the soap-factory buildings, while Dupont continued at the Galeries du Louvre until his death in 1640; the pile carpet manufactories both flourished, providing both Cardinal Mazarin and Anne of Austria with carpets and pile hangings, now proudly made, as the documents state, façon de France, \\"in the French manner\\". The best of the Savonnerie carpets were completed under the new contract granted in 1664The contract was to Lourdet alone; Louis Dupont continued to occupy his royally sponsored workrooms at the Louvre until 1671, when his workshop was established at the Savonnerie, independent of that run there by Lourdet's widow (Standen). under the general direction of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, organized along lines similar to those employed in the Gobelins and commissioning the unequalled series of thirteen carpets for the Galerie d'Apollon and ninety-three for the Grande Galerie of the Louvre,The Grande Galerie du Bord de l'Eau that is the Louvre's present long paintings gallery. which, though all but one were completed by 1683, were never used, Louis XIV's attention having become entirely fixed on Versailles, while the Grand Galerie was now used for displaying maps and plans of fortifications rather than royal levées. Nevertheless, a fortune was spent on the carpets, which were paid for at the rate of 165 livres per aune, which measured 118.8 square centimeter/46 and a half square inches. The designs were from the king's painter Charles Le Brun, realized as full-scale cartoons by two painters from the Gobelins; Le Brun was carrying out ceiling paintings in the same galleries. Weaving began in 1668 and the first carpets for the Grande Galerie were delivered towards the end of that year (Wrightsman catalogue, no. 277). Some thirty-five complete carpets remain in the French Mobilier National today. Savonnerie carpet detail. In its heyday, the Savonnerie took sixty orphans aged ten to twelve and apprenticed them for six years, at the end of which term, one would be granted the maîtrise while the others would remain journeymen. The children were taught the art of design as well, a painter from the Académie coming once a month to inspect their projects. Later, under the financial stringencies ensuing from the wars of Louis XIV, the Savonnerie fell into eclipse, its management combined with that of the Gobelins under the direction of the architect of the Bâtiments du Roi, Robert de Cotte, its workers often unpaid, its looms frequently idle, though in 1712 it was made a Manufacture Royale. During the 18th century attempts were made to update the manufactory's often retardataire designs, lightening and brightening the colors and introducing Rococo elements. In the later eighteenth century, Savonnerie produced panels for screens and firescreens and some wall-hangings. The Revolution saw the factory's nadir; royal crowns, cyphers and fleurs-de-lys were cut from carpets that remained in storage as insignia of féodalité. The revival of the Savonnerie is due to the patronage of Napoleon, who commissioned carpets after 1805 in the Empire style. New cartoons were designed by Percier and Fontaine and the old stock of drawings made their way into the collections of the new Louvre Museum. In 1825, the Savonnerie was incorporated with the Gobelins Manufactory, and its independent existence came to an end. The Savonnerie phenomena was already spreading across the European aristocracy who wished to emulate the traditional fashions of the previous French Court. One of the British houses, notorious for collecting 18th-century French royal artworks, is Waddesdon Manor - a Victorian manor house that possesses nineteen Savonnerie carpets now in its collection.

He was born in the douar of Thlet, in Seriana in the Batna region. His father, Rahal Nezzar, was a former non-commissioned officer in the French army who had turned to farming after World War II. His mother died in 1941. Military career After studying in the local native school (école indigène), he was transferred to a school for troops' children at Koléa, and then joined the French army, studying at the Strasbourg military school in Algiers where non-commissioned officers were trained. After independence in 1962, he remained in the Algerian army, and started rising through the ranks. He went to Moscow in 1964 to receive military training at the M. V. Frunze Military Academy. Upon his return in 1965, he was named Director of Materiel in the Ministry of National Defense. Soon after Houari Boumedienne's coup, he was put in charge of the Saharan 2nd Motorized Infantry, based around Ain Sefra. In 1968, he was sent to Egypt to help guard the Egypt–Israel line of control, which at the time (just after the Six-Day War) witnessed regular artillery bombardments and aerial bombings. After returning from Egypt, he was put in charge of training Algeria's first parachutists, with Soviet help, at Biskra. In 1975, he went through further training at the Ecole Supérieure de Guerre in Paris; at this point, he was a Lieutenant-Colonel. He returned in his second year without finishing his studies, having been summoned back to command troops in Tindouf at the height of the Moroccan-Algerian conflict over the Western Sahara issue. He spent the next seven years in the Bechar-Tindouf area. After Chadli Bendjedid took power, Nezzar was sent away from Tindouf to the east, a decision which he resented. He rose rapidly through the ranks, and, by 1988, he was a ground forces commander at Ain Naadja in Algiers, where he played a significant role in suppressing the \\"Black October\\" riots. Political career He became Minister of Defense in July 1990. In his memoirs, he recounts his hostility during this period to the interim prime minister Mouloud Hamrouche and president Chadli Bendjedid, whom he accuses of effectively \\"conniving\\" with the Islamic Salvation Front for the sake of increasing their power. After the Islamic Salvation Front's electoral victory in 1991, he, along with Larbi Belkheir, was among the leading generals who decided to depose then-President Chadli Bendjedid and annul the elections, marking the beginning of the Algerian Civil War. He became a member of the new provisional governing body, the High Council of State (HCS), when it was established in January 1991. He survived an assassination attempt in February 1993 in El Biar (Algiers), and gave up his position five months later, when the HCS's mandate terminated. In 1999, he (unusual for an Algerian general) published his memoirs, written in French and translated into Arabic. Personal life In October 2001, Khaled Nezzar's son Lotfi violently attacked a Le Matin reporter, Sid Ahmed Semiane, for having criticized his father. He had already threatened him several times. Nezzar apologized for his son's actions three days later; his son was eventually found guilty in court, and paid a fine of 12 euros.RSF - A journalist assaulted by the son of Khaled Nezzar ; RSF - Algeria 2003 annual report In 2002, Nezzar sued the dissident officer Habib Souaidia in Paris for defamation. Souaidia had accused him of \\"being responsible for the assassination of thousands of people\\", blaming him and other generals for starting the war and committing massacres attributed to the Armed Islamic Group. As the trial began, nine Algerians in Paris filed complaints against Nezzar for torture and inhumane treatment; he left Paris before these could be evaluated, saying he did not want to risk a diplomatic incident. The court found Souaidia innocent. References * Nezzar, Khaled. 1999. Mémoires du Général Khaled Nezzar, Chihab Editions. . * Proces K. Nezzar / H.

The town is located near the mouth of the Sainte-Anne River along the Chemin du Roy, a historic segment of Quebec Route 138 that stretches from near Montreal to Quebec City. It is the world capital of Tommy Cod fishing. During Tommy Cod season, generally from late December to mid-February, thousands of tourists come to Sainte-Anne for ice fishing and a small fishing village is built on the frozen waters of the Sainte-Anne River that bisects the town. The centrepiece of the town is the Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade Church, a Catholic church near the banks of the Sainte-Anne River, modelled after the Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal. History On October 29, 1672, an area of 1.5 lieue (about 4.8 km) by 1 lieue (about 3.2 km) deep at the Sainte-Anne River was granted by Intendant Jean Talon as a seignory to Edmond de Suève and Thomas Tarieu de Lanouguère (or Lanaudière). An increase of 3 lieues was granted to Marguerite Denis, widow of Thomas Tarieu, by Governor Frontenac and Intendant Champigny on March 4, 1697. The islands were added to the seignory on April 6, 1697, and confirmed on October 30, 1700. The order of January 8, 1710, dismissed the co- seigneur François Chorel de Saint-Romain d'Orvilliers and granted the islands to Pierre-Thomas Tarieu de la Pérade, son of Thomas Tarieu and husband of Madeleine de Verchères, a Quebec heroine who, at 14 years of age, successfully defended her parents' fort against a band of Iroquois. Following another increase granted in April 1735 to Pierre-Thomas Tarieu, the Sainte-Anne-De La Pérade Seignory came to be named after him. In 1693, the Parish of Sainte- Anne-de-la-Pérade was formed. In 1820, the post office opened. In 1845, the parish municipality was established, abolished two years later during provincewide municipal restructuring, and reestablished in 1855. In 1912, the village itself separated from the parish municipality and was incorporated as the Village Municipality of La Pérade. In May 1989, the village and parish municipalities merged again to form the new Municipality of Sainte-Anne-de-la- Pérade. On December 31, 2001, it was transferred from the Francheville Regional County to the new Les Chenaux Regional County, following the creation of the new City of Trois-Rivières and the dissolution of the Francheville RCM.

It is located near the mouth of the 'Rivière-du-Loup', on the north shore of Lac Saint-Pierre. Louiseville is twinned with Soissons in France and Cerfontaine in Belgium. History The area was originally part of the la Seignorie Rivière-du-Loup. This seignory was formed in 1665 by Intendant Jean Talon and granted in 1672 to Charles Dugey Rozoy-de-Mannereuil, officer in the Carignan Regiment. The seignory was thereafter also known as Rivière- Mannereuil for some time. In 1714, a mission was formed by the Récollets who dedicated it to the patronage of Anthony of Padua. In 1722, the Ursulines owned the seignory and attempted to change the name to Saint-Antoine-de-la- Rivière-Saint-Jean but the settlement became known as Rivière-du-Loup or Rivière-du-Loup-en-Haut after the seignory or local river. In 1816, its post office opened. In 1845, the Parish Municipality of Rivière-du-Loup-en-Haut was formed, and abolished two years later in 1847. It was reestablished in 1855 as Saint-Antoine-de-la-Rivière-du-Loup, named after the parish patron and the seignory. In 1878, the main settlement separated from the parish municipality and formed the Village Municipality of Rivière-du-Loup. Just one year later it was renamed to Louiseville in order to avoid confusion with another town called Rivière-du-Loup in the Bas-Saint-Laurent region. The new name was a tribute to Princess Louise, viceregal consort of Canada, the third daughter of Queen Victoria, who had planned to visit the Mauricie that same year. On January 1, 1989, the parish and village municipalities merged again and became the Town of Louiseville.

From Medard, outings for hikers and canoeists are possible.Location =Neighbouring municipalities= Medard borders in the north on the municipality of Breitenheim, in the east on the municipality of Odenbach, in the southeast on the municipality of Cronenberg, in the southwest and west on the town of Lauterecken, in the west on an exclave belonging to the municipality of Grumbach and in the northwest on the municipality of Kappeln. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Medard is the outlying homestead of Bärenhof.Constituent communities =Municipality’s layout= Most of Medard's houses are found standing either side of the through road, Bundesstraße 420, branching off which are smaller sidestreets. The most important of these branching off to the south are a street leading to the former railway station and another leading to the former mill. In the area around the mill, nowadays known as Medardusquelle (“Saint Medardus’s Spring”), a bridge crosses the river Glan, which leads to the few houses that stand on the river's right bank, and also to the sporting ground and to lands used for agriculture and forestry. Here on the right bank, two shaft kilns for making quicklime, in operation between 1820 and 1900, are preserved. The pretty old village church in the middle of the graveyard, the former school and the former Roman archaeological dig sites lie at the ends of the sidestreets that branch off the through road to the north. Here, too, a great new building zone spreads out. A very old gymnasium stands on the through road. Houses in the village core are as a rule simple houses, but there are also Einfirstbauernhäuser (farmhouses with single roof ridges), which are typical of the Westrich, an historic region that encompasses areas in both Germany and France. The inn and hotel of the Bärenhof stands at the side of the road leading to Odenbach and Meisenheim left of Bundesstraße 420. Once found in this area was a knacker’s yard. Medard was once also noted for its great number of houses with crow-stepped gables, of which nowadays only a single example is preserved; it stands on Mühlenstraße.Municipality’s layout History =Antiquity= The municipality of Medard has yielded a wealth of archaeological finds from prehistoric and Roman times. The Marialskopf in the southeast was in the time when the area was settled by the Celts ringed by walls and palisades, a refuge castle. The remnants of this settlement within the ringwall can still clearly be seen. In 1973 and 1983, archaeological digs unearthed and secured potsherds from vessels made by the Hunsrück-Eifel Culture. Significant was the recovery of a silver coin struck in Pannonia, a quarter-stater with Zeus’s head on the obverse and an image of a rider on the reverse. Splinters and shards of old ceramic vessels are still to be found on those lands today. It is likely that the Celtic settlement remained once the Romans had conquered Gaul. Near Medard’s mediaeval church, foundations from a settlement built in Gallo-Roman times were discovered in 1973. It turned out to be a villa rustica from the turn of the 4th century AD. In 1979, 1980 and 1984, under Diethelm Malitius’s leadership, some outbuildings were also partly unearthed. The archaeologists also discovered fragments of sculptures, one showing a female figure, grapevine shoots and a horn of plenty full of fruits. In the Middle Ages, it is likely that many stone reliefs still lay all around in the ground, perhaps explaining the spolia from Roman times that can still be seen in the church walls today, showing such things as grapes and another female figure. Taken out of the church’s walling were the fragments of a relief that shows Medea on a wain drawn by snakes. Of Medea’s children, whom she killed out of jealousy, only the lower part of a boy’s body can still be seen. The image’s background shows her unfaithful husband, Jason. The relief was supposedly once part of a grave monument. During renovation work on the church, three sandstone blocks from Roman times were discovered near the portal in 1988, of which one was originally used as an ossuary (repository for bone ash). One side of this stone bears a well-preserved inscription that reads “[D M (for Dis Manibus)] ... us Ammosus et Amandia Mandina Conjux Regulo filio [su]orum et suo vivi fecer[unt]”, or in English, “...us Ammosus and his wife Amandia Mandina set [this grave monument] to their son Regulus and themselves to their lifetime.” The digs at the Roman settlement site resumed very extensively in 1995 and 1996 under Wolfgang Heinzelmann’s leadership on assignment from the Alt-Medard (“Old Medard”) Promotional Association and the State Office for Monument Care. This work fully brought to light the former Roman settlement's main house, the atrium house, together with other structures built up around it and the villa's girding wall. It was apparently a great, certainly two-floor building with corner risalti at the front, of which one could be heated by a hypocaust facility. The house's footprint measured 30 m in length and 20 m in breadth. The archaeologists found a column fragment, remnants of flooring and plastering in Pompeian red. A bathing facility was only partially unearthed, but a drainage ditch was fully dug up, revealing a further series of single finds. All together, three different building periods were identified. It is presumed that this great villa rustica with its many outbuildings covered an area of some 3 ha. It may therefore be that this Roman estate unearthed on Medard's outskirts is by far the biggest that has ever come to light in the whole Western Palatinate. To preserve them, the digs have once more been filled with earth.Antiquity =Middle Ages= The Gallo-Roman settlement near today's village may have vanished in the 5th century. The archaeological discoveries suggest that there was an epoch during which the area was not settled, but it was quite soon that more settlers came and founded another settlement. Nevertheless, it is unknown just when this village was founded. Indeed, during the digs at the villa rustica, the archaeologists also found the outlines of six small pit-houses from the Middle Ages. It is to be assumed that the village's first houses arose very early after the Franks took the land, on the mountainside, likely near a wooden church. The pit-houses that were unearthed, going by what is known about such things by archaeology, likely date from the 10th or 11th century. They must not have been the oldest buildings from the time of post-Roman settlement. Originally, the estate of Medard lay in the Free Königsland, but was given by a Merovingian king into the ownership of the Bishops of Verdun, although it is unknown when this donation happened. The Counts of Veldenz as successors to the Counts of the Nahegau founded out of their own small holdings and out of extensive territories that they safeguarded as Vögte belonging to the Bishoprics of Mainz, Worms, Verdun and Reims their new county, the County of Veldenz. In a 1235 document, the fiefs held by the Counts of Veldenz from the Bishops of Verdun were listed: Veldenz, Medard, Baumholder, Wolfersweiler, Freisen, Sankt Wendel, Tholey and Neunkirchen an der Nahe. Since Medard is named right after Veldenz, the estate might have been of special importance to Verdun. Bit by bit, the Counts of Veldenz managed to suppress the influence wielded by the Bishops of Verdun. The Counts lent them knights with official duties, and also with benefices and rights from Verdun holdings, and thus also with rights from Saint Medardus’s Estate (Medard). In the applicable enfeoffment documents, until the mid 14th century, a note appeared stating that the enfeoffment's origin was Verdun, but by the late 14th century, this note was being left out, leading to the conclusion that by this time, Verdun's ownership rights no longer meant very much. Nevertheless, the Bishopric of Verdun remained the landholder, which could be clearly seen whenever a new prince took power or a new bishop was installed. When the last Count of Veldenz died in 1444, the Bishops of Verdun held the Vogtei of the Counts of Veldenz to be extinct along with the Counts, and no longer wanted to recognize Count Palatine Stephan as their rightful successor. However, Archbishop of Trier Jacob managed to negotiate the reinstatement of the original arrangement in 1454. The feudal arrangement between Verdun and Veldenz was then confirmed in 1497 by Emperor Maximilian I. Until about 1000, the estate of Medard, along with Meisenheim and Lauterecken, were held to be the more important centres in the Glan valley. Bit by bit, it was outstripped in importance by the two other centres, which later became towns. Lauterecken arose only about 1000 at a castle and was likely granted town rights in 1349. Meisenheim, which was a town as of 1315, was also raised as early as the 12th century to residence town by the Counts of Veldenz. Between 1124 and 1444, Medard lay in the County of Veldenz, within which it belonged to the Oberamt of Meisenheim. After the Counts died out in 1444, it belonged to the Duchy of Palatinate- Zweibrücken.Middle Ages =Modern times= In 1509 a lord was once again enfeoffed with Medard, this time Alexander, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken, by the Bishopric Administrator Nikolaus von Verdun. The Bishop of Verdun at that time, Prince Louis of Lorraine, was only nine years old and thus could not undertake the deed himself. What clearly showed that this was nothing more than a symbolic deed anyway was Verdun's utter lack of influence when in 1537, the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken chose to introduce the Reformation into their domains. During the Thirty Years' War, Medard suffered not only under the ravages of war but also under the Plague, though the loss of life was not as great as it was in the area around Kusel, for the inhabitants managed in the main to shelter themselves within Meisenheim’s town walls. The Amt seat of Meisenheim was never overrun by troops coming through the area. The loss of life was nevertheless great enough, and after the war, resettlement began. It may well have been in this time that the dale first began to be settled in the Medard area. From 1589 comes a report of a long dispute over grazing rights between Medard and Lauterecken, which had since become “foreign”. It is also highly likely that Medard was destroyed during French King Louis XIV's wars of conquest. France tried using military force beginning in 1672 and through its politique des Réunions beginning in 1679 to win back such areas within Germany as were in one way or another still tied to France. Within today's Kusel district, de jure relations with Verdun in Lorraine barely still existed in the estate of Medard, which by now found itself in the Unteramt of Odenbach. On Lorraine, too, France raised a claim, and the duchy was annexed to France in 1766. The then Count Palatine of Zweibrücken Friedrich Ludwig, and also Leopold Ludwig, the last Count Palatine of Veldenz-Lützelstein who kept his residence in Lauterecken, opposed the French attempts at Réunion. The French showed their displeasure at this by burning many places in the two counties palatine down, in 1677 the town of Kusel and in 1680 Castle Veldenz. It is unknown today in what way Medard, too, suffered in the warfare of that time. Meanwhile, after the destruction, the French were promoting the settling of newcomers and the reintroduction and spread of the Catholic faith. The County Palatine of Veldenz mentioned above had been established by the 1543 Treaty of Marburg. Under its terms, a border had also arisen between Medard and the neighbouring town of Lauterecken, for Medard had not been included in the new county palatine, but rather had remained in the Oberamt of Meisenheim in the County Palatine of Zweibrücken. What is odd is that in 1653, Count Palatine Leopold Ludwig had the Bishop of Verdun enfeoff him with not only Veldenz, which belonged to this new county palatine, but also Medard, Baumholder and Wolfersweiler. Since the last three named places remained with the County Palatine of Zweibrücken, it seems that this enfeoffment was never operative. On the other hand, the feudal arrangement between Verdun and its landholders remained in force until the French Revolution.Modern times Recent times During the time of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era that followed, the German lands on the Rhine’s left bank were annexed by France. With the new political arrangement and within the new boundaries, Medard found itself in the Mairie (“Mayoralty”) of Meisenheim, the Canton of Meisenheim, the Arrondissement of Birkenfeld and the Department of Sarre. After French rule, the Congress of Vienna drew new boundaries yet again. Between the Glan and the Nahe arose the Principality of Lichtenberg, a newly created exclave of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and the Oberamt of Meisenheim belonging to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg. Medard now lay within this Meisenheim body, whereas its neighbours on the Glan's right bank, Lauterecken and Odenbach, had been grouped into the bayerischer Rheinkreis, later known as Rheinpfalz (“Rhenish Palatinate”), an exclave of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The whole Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg passed after the last Prince's death in 1866 to the Kingdom of Prussia, and what had hitherto been the Oberamt of Meisenheim now became the Landkreis (district) of Meisenheim within Prussia's Rhine Province. This district was merged into the Bad Kreuznach district in 1932. In the 19th century, the Glantalbahn (railway) ran through the village. There were further changes after the Second World War. At first, Medard still lay in the Bad Kreuznach district within the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz in the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In the course of administrative restructuring in 1968 the village was split away from the Bad Kreuznach district and grouped into the Kusel district, and in 1972 into the newly founded Verbandsgemeinde of Lauterecken. At the same time, it was transferred from the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz to the Regierungsbezirk of Rheinhessen- Pfalz, which was then also newly founded, but which has now been dissolved.Recent times =Population development= The village of Medard has remained rurally structured to this day. A great part of the populace earned its living until a few decades ago at agriculture. Alongside farmers were the local craftsmen, as well as workers and employees who mostly sought work elsewhere. Agriculture now employs few people. Many people in the workforce nowadays earn livelihoods outside the village. The following table shows population development for Medard, although figures from long ago are not available:Medard’s population development {border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"500\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\" Year 1978 1999 2007 - align=\\"center\\" Total 540 470 519 } =Municipality’s name= The village's namesake is Saint Medardus, the original patron of the Church of Medard. Medardus, from Salency in France (also Saint Gildard’s birthplace), dedicated himself as a son of well-to-do parents to the poor, for whom he gave his whole fortune. He was later a bishop in Vermandois and Tournai, and died about 560. He was thus Saint Remigius’s contemporary. The original estate of Medard was said to be a base of the Bishopric of Verdun, and it was also described in the oldest known documents as an estate. In an 1150 document, surviving today in an 1156 copy, appears the transcription “in Curiam sancti Medardi”. Among other forms of the name that have appeared over the ages are de Sancto Medardo (1223), Curtis S. Medardi (1235), apud Sanctum Mydehardum (1289) and Sant Medhard (1343). It could be that an earlier name for the village was displaced by the church patron’s name. The name once bore the tag Sankt (“Saint”), but this was dropped in the Reformation.Municipality’s name =Vanished villages= For the Medard area, three vanished villages are known by name, Rode, Schwanden and Nirthausen (also called Nordhausen and Erdhausen). Rode lay north of Medard and Schwanden northeast, while Nirthausen lay somewhere between Medard and Lauterecken. Rode and Schwanden were named in documents in 1289, 1379 and 1380, in each of which the name form Swande was used for the latter. Both names mean “clearing”. Both villages (or farms, as the case might have been) may have been given up even long before the Thirty Years' War. Nirthausen was mentioned, among other times, in 1377 as Nyrthusen, in 1387 as Nyrthuißen and in 1643 as Nörthausen. The rural cadastral toponym Erdhausen, still used today, can be traced back to Nirthausen. Unlike the other two, Nirthausen was still standing at the time of the Thirty Years' War, but was likely not settled by either its original inhabitants or newcomers after that war. Researchers Dolch and Greule trace the first part of the name, Nirt—, back to a man named Nerito. According to this theory, a man named Nerito founded the village. Just where this village stood is a matter of some disagreement, and some even assign it to a neighbouring municipality.Vanished villages Religion It is assumed that Medard was founded at the time of the Frankish taking of the land, making it one of the oldest villages founded by settlers coming along the Roman roads running through the Glan valley. The area in which the founding came about must have belonged to the Free Imperial Domain (Reichsland), for only thus could the estate of Medard have become a donation to the Bishop of Verdun. Therefore, the village's founding could have come about as early as the early 6th century, and it is quite possible that efforts to Christianize the Germanic peoples had their roots here. That would have necessitated a church in the village right from the beginning. The villages that later belonged to the parish of the estate of Medard must all have been founded somewhat later; a time period of 200 to 400 years can be assumed for that. These villages’ names only became known to history very late. They were, besides Medard itself, Windsberg (today Windhof), Lauterecken, Berschweiler (today a constituent community of Wiesweiler), Lohnweiler, Adenbach, Becherbach, Odenbach and the now vanished villages of Nyrthausen, Mannweiler (near Reipoltskirchen), Rode and Schwanden. To be borne in mind is that under secular organization during the Middle Ages, Odenbach had become an Unteramt seat, and that this Unteramt and the parish were coëxtensive. While Medard was a Verdun landhold, it nevertheless belonged under ecclesiastical organization to the Archbishopric of Mainz. The church that stands today – or at least the churchtower – has its roots in the 13th century. The triple nave was only built in the 16th century. The quire was a renovation job done in 1890. The Reformation was introduced in 1537 in line with ecclesiastical developments in the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken, which at first adopted the Lutheran faith. However, beginning in 1588, Count Palatine Johannes I forced all his subjects to convert to Reformed belief as espoused by John Calvin. The church stewardship responsible for Medard at that time was the one at Meisenheim. Changes came both to the parish and the secular organization at the time when the new County Palatine of Veldenz was founded under the terms of the 1543 Treaty of Marburg. At this time, Lauterecken, Berschweiler and Lohnweiler were grouped into the new county palatine, which would affect the new consolidation within the parish only bit by bit. From 1367, the parish branch village of Odenbach already had its own church. In 1675, Medard lost its function as mother church and itself became a branch of Odenbach. The new political order brought by the French Revolution and Napoleonic French rule also brought fundamental changes in ecclesiastical organization. Under Hesse-Homburg sovereignty, Medard was split away from Odenbach and grouped into the parish of Meisenheim. For a time, the rector of the Meisenheim Latin school was also the clergyman in Medard. Only in 1902, long after Medard had passed to Prussia, did Medard once again find itself at the hub of its own parish. In 1902 and 1903, the rectory that still stands now was also built. From 1866, the Meisenheim district also formed its own church district. This was dissolved in 1969 and merged with the likewise former church districts of Kreuznach and Sobernheim into a new church district known as “An Nahe und Glan”. Belonging to this was the parish of Medard, but only for a short time, for in 1976, it was grouped into the Sankt Wendel church district. Since 1991, the minister at Medard has had two parishes to tend, his own and the small parish of Niederalben, which lies 15 km away.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Medard's mayor is Albert Graf, and his deputies are Hans Knaul and Stefan Hoos.Medard’s executive =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per bend sinister azure a church chancel foremost Or and argent Saint Medardus proper vested of the first, mitred Or and bearing a staff of the same in the dexter hand a book of the same in the sinister. The charge on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is the local church, and the tinctures, blue and gold, are those borne by the Bishopric of Verdun, for the area was donated to the Bishop of Verdun sometime between 575 and 588. The charge on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is the municipality's patron saint, Medardus, who is also the village's namesake. He is shown as a bishop, which is also a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Bishopric of Verdun, dating back to the Early Middle Ages. The tinctures on this side are the ones once borne by the Counts of Veldenz, who held the village for centuries. The arms have been borne since 4 November 1985.Description and explanation of Medard’s armsDescription and explanation of Medard’s arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate’s Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Kusel district * Evangelical parish church, Kirchgasse 8 – nave and rectangular quire, about 1262, west tower completed late 13th century, aisles possibly about 1510, renovation 1592–1597; Roman spolia, possibly early 3rd century; at the graveyard sarcophagi, about 1000 (see also below) * Near Hauptstraße 18 – former flowing well, sandstone-block, cast-iron basin, 19th century; remnants of the wooden waterpipe * Hauptstraße 26 – former school; sandstone-framed plastered building, 1844; barn from time of building; characterizes village's appearance * Kirchgasse 3 – Evangelical rectory; villalike cube-shaped building with hipped roof with risalti and timber-frame gables, 1903; characterizes square's appearance * Near Mühlgasse 20 – former shaft kiln of the limeworks of the firm C. und L. Schlemmer; three-level, regenerative flue, 1922 * Mühlgasse 30 – house with crow-stepped gable, partly timber-frame (plastered), 16th century, stable-barn, possibly from the 19th century * former shaft kilns, in the Scheiderwald (woods) at municipal limits with Cronenberg – two sandstone-block hoppers integrated into the slope, 1820 Evangelical church The Romanesque church in the village is nowadays Evangelical. It stands on the site where it is believed once stood a chapel. Inside the quire arch are the two yeardates 1262 and 1597. The tower and parts of the nave are known with certainty to be older than even the earlier of those dates. Many times, alterations were made to the church, especially in the years from 1592 to 1597. Perhaps it was then that the two aisles were added. It is also believed that it was then that two columns were removed from each of the nave's side walls to make the building into what is held in the Reformed tradition to be a church suited to sermons (Predigtkirche). By 1887, the quire had fallen into disrepair and was torn down and replaced with a new one. =Regular events= Medard holds its kermis (church consecration festival) on the second weekend in September. Other than what is also practised in neighbouring villages, there are no customs peculiar to Medard.Regular events =Clubs= The following clubs are active in Medard:Clubs *Angelsportverein — angling club *Förderverein der Feuerwehr — fire brigade promotional association *Landfrauenverein — countrywomen's club *Männergesangverein — men's singing club *Modellflugverein „Falke“ — model aircraft club *Sportverein — sport club Economy and infrastructure =Economic structure= In the beginning, the villagers of Medard earned their livelihoods mainly by working the land. Alongside smaller handicraft businesses was a mill, and limestone was long mined here, and fired into quicklime. Two limekilns of the shaft variety still stand today. A mineral spring has long been known, and in the former mill's buildings is used for mineral water production in grand style (“Medardus-Quelle”). A business that marketed ceramic ware set up shop in the village after the Second World War, but ceased production a few years ago. A major metal construction firm that makes window and door structures went into production in January 2000 on the road leading to Lauterecken. All together, the businesses in the village fall far short of employing the whole available workforce, and thus many must commute to jobs elsewhere, mainly to Lauterecken, Meisenheim, Kaiserslautern and Bad Kreuznach. All together, the tourism sector in the village still has room to grow.Economic structure =Education= Originally, Medard schoolchildren had to go to school in Odenbach, for which the Medard clergyman donated one Malter of corn. In 1596, the clergyman declared himself ready to teach classes himself, thereby sparing himself the corn payment. In 1604, a man named Jost Drincker, at the same time a teacher in the Eßweiler Tal (dale), was supposed to be hired as a “German schoolmaster” in Medard. It seems likely that Drincker only taught in Medard sporadically, for a 1609 school inspection in Medard noted that no school was to be found there. It is unknown when school started back up. In 1623, a schoolteacher named Johannes Walmeister came to Medard, who sought in vain in 1626 to have himself transferred to the Amt of Lichtenberg because the people in Medard were too poor to send their children to school. A setback for schooling came with the Thirty Years' War, but the teaching post was soon filled after the war. In 1655, seven years after the war ended, a schoolmaster complained that children were not coming to school regularly and that he was not getting his full salary. This teacher had himself transferred, ushering in a long time during which there was no school. Further school inspections in 1666 and 1673 also noted that no school was to be found in Medard. Parents who were interested in sending their children to school were now once again forced to turn to Odenbach. In 1674, though, Medard once again had a schoolteacher; however, he soon left the village again because he was not being paid enough. In 1687, the teaching post in Medard was newly filled, and the teacher at that time was given a good reference. In 1695, Hans Konrad Henn was the schoolteacher. In 1708, it was Johann Rudolf Roland, who in 1714 was transferred to Rehborn. Following him was Kaspar Methiger, who in 1722 went to Ulmet. Then came Balthasar Nikolay, earlier the schoolteacher in Einöllen. He taught in the village for 31 years and in 1753, when he was 75, asked that his son-in-law be hired, who for a while taught 50 children. He then taught until 1791, and in turn he was followed by his own son-in-law, Johannes Hunsicker from Jeckenbach. About this schoolteacher it was reported that he possessed “besides the knowledge of educational sciences, the calling of a great artist in fabricating musical instruments”. The musical instruments built by Hunsicker, mainly pianos, were even sold abroad, and thus he was in a better financial position than other teachers. Hunsicker's income from the municipality then amounted to 18 Rhenish guilders, 12 Batzen and 8 Pfennige. Today, primary school pupils and Hauptschule students attend their respective schools in Lauterecken. There are Gymnasien in Lauterecken and Meisenheim. The nearest university town is Kaiserslautern (Kaiserslautern University of Technology).Education =Transport= Medard lies on Bundesstraße 420 (Oppenheim—Neunkirchen, Saarland). In Lauterecken, only 2 km away, Bundesstraßen 420 and 270 cross each other. The nearest Autobahn interchanges are all rather far away (Kusel 32 km, Kaiserslautern 35 km, Wörrstadt 45 km). Formerly, the village lay on the Glan Valley Railway (Glantalbahn, Bad Münster am Stein—Homburg), which opened in 1906 and closed in 1985. Running nowadays on the railway right-of-way are small draisines as a tourist attraction.Transport Serving Lauterecken is a railway station on the Lauter Valley Railway (Lautertalbahn). Famous people =Sons and daughters of the town= Karl L. Kistner (b. 1926) — A painter, graphic artist and writer, Kistner has had many exhibitions throughout Germany. A well known work of his is Die Bibel in 61 Linolschnitten (“The Bible in 61 Linocuts”). Among other things that he has published are Autoleien, Jeden Tag ein Lächeln (“Every Day a Smile”) and Liebesbriefe (“Love Letters”).Sons and daughters of the town References External links * Medard in the collective municipality’s webpages Municipalities in Rhineland-Palatinate Kusel (district) ","title":"Medard"},{"id":"5789858","text":"Drohobych Raion (, translit: Drohobyts’kyi raion) is a raion (district) of Lviv Oblast (region) of western Ukraine.

Population: History Kesova Gora was known since approximately 1238, and it apparently was formed from a combination various smaller settlements: Krasny, Zaychy, and Grachi. Originally, the settlement was called Kyasova Gora, meaning \\"clay-filled region\\" in Finnish. For a long time, it was a votchina of the Prozorovsky noble family. One of the most important landmarks of the settlement is the still-functioning Saint Nicholas Church. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, Kesova Gora was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as Saint Petersburg Governorate), but in 1727 it was transferred to Moscow Governorate. In 1775, Tver Viceroyalty was formed from the lands which previously belonged to Moscow and Novgorod Governorates. Kesova Gora was a part of Kashinsky Uyezd of Tver Viceroyalty. In 1796, Tver Viceroyalty was transformed into Tver Governorate. On October 3, 1927 Kashinsky Uyezd was abolished; Kesova Gora was transferred to Bezhetsky Uyezd. On July 12, 1929 the governorates and uyezds were abolished. Kesovsky District, with the administrative center in Kesova Gora, was established within Bezhetsk Okrug of Moscow Oblast. Shortly afterwards, the district was renamed Kesovogorsky. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 29, 1935 Kalinin Oblast was established, and Kesovogorsky District was transferred to Tver Oblast. On February 13, 1963, during the abortive Khrushchyov administrative reform, Sonkovsky District was merged into Bezhetsky District, but on January 12, 1965 it was re-established. In 1975, Kesova Gora was granted urban-type settlement status. Economy =Industry= Kesova Gora's economy is primarily agriculture-based. There is also a bread-making factory, a linen factory, and a milk and meat packing company in the settlement. =Transportation= The main form of transportation in the settlement is the passenger train which makes a stop at the historic wooden town train station (constructed in 1895) two or more times a day. The train travels from nearby Sonkovo to Savyolovo, and back. A more frequent bus service is also available in the area, but it only travels to closer locations. A road that travels from Kashin to Bezhetsk also passes through the settlement. Culture and recreation Saint Nicholas Church. Kesova Gora contains one cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally two objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monument is the Saint Nicholas Church (1770s) whereas the local monuments are the Transfiguration Church (1800) and the monument to Aleksey Alelyukhin, a military pilot and double Hero of the Soviet Union, who was born in Kesova Gora. There is a local museum in Kesova Gora.

Turner Jr. (born February 29, 1940) is an American Thoroughbred flat racing trainer who is best known for winning the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing in 1977 with Seattle Slew, and is the world's oldest living Triple Crown-winning trainer. Turner maintains a public training stable and bloodstock consulting services, operating mainly in New York, Florida and the Mid-Atlantic region. In recent years he has been based in Belmont Park and Saratoga Racetrack in New York, and Palm Meadows Thoroughbred Training Center in Florida, training horses that compete on the New York Racing Association circuit, at Gulfstream Park, and other racing venues along the U.S. East coast. Early life and career Born in Rochester, New York, Turner grew up riding and fox hunting in Pennsylvania's horse country and began his career with racehorses as a steeplechase jockey while still a teenager. Working under Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame steeplechase trainer Burley Cocks, Turner rode first over jumps from 1958 to 1963 and then, when his 6'2\\" height made race-riding unrealistic, continued as an assistant- trainer until 1966. At the age of 26, Turner went into business on his own as a trainer and found early success with the Thoroughbred racehorse Salerno, who won the Remsen Stakes in 1967. Seattle Slew In 1975, Karen and Mickey Taylor gave their $17,500 colt to Billy Turner for training. Turner started the colt, named Seattle Slew, at Mrs. Henry Obre's Andor Farm in Monkton, Maryland. At 2, Seattle Slew moved to the racetrack and, under Turner, went undefeated in his two-year-old racing season and was honored with the 1976 Eclipse Award. The following year, Turner became only the ninth trainer in American racing history to win the Triple Crown when he saddled Seattle Slew to victories in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Belmont Stakes, and Slew was voted U.S. Horse of the Year. He was for many years the only horse to win the Triple Crown while still undefeated (though he lost some subsequent races); this feat was emulated in 2018 by Justify, who retired with no losses. After the Triple Crown, a disagreement occurred between Turner, who wanted to give Slew a rest, and the owners, who wanted to run him in the Swaps Stakes in California. This conflict led to a parting of ways, and Seattle Slew was sent to trainer Doug Peterson. Later career Two years after Slew's historic run, Turner trained a chestnut colt, Czaravich, who won or showed in all of his 13 starts. His campaign included wins in the Carter Handicap (1979), Withers Stakes (1979), Jerome Handicap (1979) and Metropolitan Handicap (1980). In 1984, Turner conditioned Welcome Farm's colt Play On, who won that year's Withers Stakes and finished second to Gate Dancer in the Preakness. From 1995 to 1999, Turner trained Althea Richard's Punch Line, a horse he referred to as \\"the second best horse I ever trained.\\" A winner of 21 races from ages 2 to 8, Punch Line was named the Virginia's Horse of the Year, champion sprinter 1997, 1998 and at the age of 8, won the Fall Highweight Handicap carrying 136 pounds. Today, Punch is retired in Virginia, and Turner still pays him regular visits. Since 1976, Turner's horses have won more than $15 million in purses. Turner took in $780,000 of that purse money in 1977. Personal life Billy Turner is married to former jockey and exercise rider Patricia Rich 'Patti' Turner and has two children from previous marriages. Since 1992, Patti has acted as Assistant Trainer for Turner Racing. She has been involved in racing since 1969 and over the years has worked as an exercise rider and jockey with horses that include Mr. Prospector, Talc, Sea Hero and Punch Line. Patti is also a skilled consultant on bloodlines and breeding and, along with Turner, regularly travels to Keenland, Saratoga, Timonium etc. to assess bloodstock and advise clients in their purchases.

The statue of Saint Ubaldo leads the procession. Saint Ubaldo Day or Festa dei Ceri is an event celebrated on the 15th of May in the Italian town of Gubbio. It honors the life of Bishop Ubaldo Baldassini who was canonized as protector of Gubbio. It is also celebrated in the American town of Jessup, Pennsylvania The eve of his death anniversary, May 15, is marked in Gubbio by a procession known as Corsa dei Ceri. Jessup conducts a nearly identical \\"Race of the Saints\\" on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. The procession through the streets features small statues of Saint Ubaldo, Saint George, and Saint Anthony, in order. They are mounted upon immense wooden pedestals each hoisted by a team of \\"Ceraioli\\" (runners) clad respectively in yellow, blue, or black.  In Gubbio, Italy  In Gubbio, the procession ends by carrying the ceri to the Basilica di Sant' Ubaldo, which stands on top of Gubbio's Mount Ingino. In this case, an obvious competition occurs as Saint Ubaldo's ceraioli try to close the basilica doors before George and Anthony can join Ubaldo inside. The event in Gubbio is bigger in many ways: a longer course, more participants and thousands more spectators, and a higher level of excitement and intensity.  In Jessup, Pennsylvania  = Origin = The borough of Jessup, a suburb of Scranton, organized and presented to the Luzerne County court for incorporation in December, 1876, grew in subsequent decades along with the anthracite coal industry. The demand for miners brought many European immigrants to the Lackawanna Valley. Italians came to Jessup mostly from Gubbio and other communities of the Umbria region's Province of Perugia. Jessup's new sizable Perugian enclave transplanted the tradition of La Festa dei Ceri in 1909. It continued only until 1952 but was revived for the borough's centennial celebration 24 years later. Certain years since then had up to 30,000 spectators joining Jessup's population of under 5,000 for the event, attracting national news media. Today, it is administered by the community's Saint Ubaldo Society and coupled with Jessup Hose Company No. 2's weekend-long carnival and picnic. Gubbio, incidentally, is \\"Sister City\\" to Jessup resulting from a process that began in May, 1978 and was formally completed in May, 2004. As customary in Italy, Gubbio refers to Jessup as its \\"Città Gemellata\\" or \\"Twinned City\\". 2009 will be celebrated as the 100th anniversary of Saint Ubaldo Day in Jessup and numerous commemorative celebrations were planned by the Saint Ubaldo Society to mark the occasion. = Events = Saint Ubaldo Day begins early in the morning with roving musicians from Valley View High School about town and an intimate ceremony at Saint John's Catholic Italian cemetery. Members of all three families, Sant' Ubaldo, San Giorgio, and Sant' Antonio, then gather together for a frittata breakfast. Participants then process to Saint Mary's Assumption Church for a special Mass followed by \\"L'Alzata\\". During the Alzata, three \\"stanga\\" (the H-shaped platforms to be placed upon teams' shoulders) are stood vertically as the large \\"ceri\\" (the pedestals) are fastened into them perpendicularly with wooden pegs. This hardware weighs approximately 400-450 pounds (900 in Gubbio) each and is reminiscent of the bier that carried Saint Ubaldo himself through Gubbio in proclamation of his heroism. The saints' statues are affixed after \\"capodieci\\" (team captains) climb atop the cross-members, where they bless the structures with holy water from \\"brocca\\", ceramic vases sent directly from Gubbio. The afternoon is spent socializing among neighbors. Many households assemble in their yards and on their sidewalks to offer homemade food and wine to passersby. During these hours, the saints are carried leisurely throughout Jessup on display and for practice. The procession is the main event and is termed a \\"race\\" more for its quick pace and level of excitement than for any competitive aspect. It begins in the uptown section of Jessup and winds its way through residential blocks before reaching the Church Street business district. This downhill stretch ends at Station Park in the opposite end of town. The course is reversed and climbs Church Street again before turning toward the Jessup Veterans' Memorial Stadium. Teams circle the fields three times in a spectacle called \\"I tre giri\\". Saint Ubaldo always \\"wins\\", though George and Anthony can gain favor by having their ceri removed more swiftly as teams lay the stanga at rest and hammer the wooden pegs out.

The school took the position that the name was a \\"gift\\" to the Arab peoples for their contribution to the economy of the Coachella Valley, not as a foreign racial symbol. In 2002, Coachella Valley High School officials had a meeting to determine whether to rename the mascot out of concern it might produce negative stereotypes against Arabs and Middle Eastern people, after the September 11 terrorist attacks. They decided to keep the mascot name. In November 2013, the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee described the mascot as an offensive stereotype, and began an online petition to get the school to change it. In April 2014 the committee was working to keep the Arab Mascot, but to develop an image that represented the fierce warrior history of the mascot, in a way that is not considered an offensive stereotypical caricature. In addition, the students and staff were working to add in an Arab History component.

Most of the nobility were Baltic Germans, but with the changing political landscape over the centuries, Polish, Swedish and Russian families also became part of the nobility, just as Baltic German families re-settled in e.g. the Swedish and Russian Empires. The nobility of Lithuania is for historical, social and ethnic reasons often separated from the German-dominated nobility of Estonia and Latvia. History This nobility was a source of officers and other servants to Swedish kings in the 16th and particularly 17th centuries, when Couronian, Estonian, Livonian and the Oeselian lands belonged to them. Subsequently Russian Tsars used Baltic nobles in all parts of local and national government. Latvia in particular was noted for its followers of Bolshevism and the latter were bitterly engaged throughout 1919 in a war against the aristocracy and Landed Estates and the German Freicorps. With independence the government was firmly Left. In 1918 in Estonia 90% of the large landed estates had been owned by Baltic Barons and Germans and about 58% of all agricultural estates had been in the hands of the big landowners. In Latvia approximately 57% of agricultural land was under Baltic German ownership. The Baltic Germans bore the brunt of left-wing and nationalist agrarian reform (as in the new Czechoslovakia). The severity of the agrarian legislation introduced in Estonia on 10 October 1919 and in Latvia on 16 September 1920 reflected above all a determination to break the disproportionate political and economic power of the German element. In Estonia 96.6% of all the estates belonging to the Baltic Germans were taken over, together with farms and villas. The question of fair compensation was left open. In Latvia, in contrast to the implied promise in Estonia, nominal remainders usually made up of about 50 hectares and in a few cases 100 hectares, were left to the dispossessed estate owners, as well as an appropriate amount of stock and equipment. These concessions were seen by most Baltic Germans as offering little more than the life-style of a peasant farmer. Again, fair compensation was to be considered later. The Baltic Germans lost at a stroke most of their inherited wealth built up over 700 years.The Baltic States and Weimar Ostpolitik by John Hiden, Cambridge University Press (England), 1987, p.36-7. Apart from the landed estate owners the rural Mittelstand dependent upon the old estates was severely affected. The expropriation of agrarian banks by the State also hit the Baltic Germans, who controlled/owned them. Paul Schiemann's later polemic against the Bank of Latvia came to the conclusion that 90% of Baltic Germans wealth had gone into the coffers of the Latvian State. Nothing could prevent the Estonian and Latvian political parties from pressing home the attack on Baltic German wealth. The USA Commissioner to the Baltic in 1919 wrote of the Estonians: \\"German Balts are their pet aversion, more so really than the Bolsheviks\\". His comment conveys the extreme position of the Baltic peoples on the subject of the Baltic Barons. The ruined and the dispossessed drifted to the cities and towns. The new left-wing government in Berlin was unsympathetic to their kin in the Baltic States and were bitterly attacked by Baron Wrangell, who from March 1919 had increasingly assumed the role of spokesman for the German Balts at the German Foreign Ministry (Auswartiges Amt) and argued that the internationally recognised Treaty of Nystad guaranteed the position of the German minority in the Baltic.Hiden, 1987, p.37-41. The Baltic Barons and the Baltic Germans in general were given the new and lasting label of Auslandsdeutsch by the Auswartiges Amt who now grudgingly entered into negotiations with the Baltic governments on their behalf, especially in relation to compensation for their ruination. Of the 84,000 German Balts twenty thousand or so emigrated to Germany during the course of 1920-21. More followed during the inter-war years.Hiden, 1987, p.50-55. The annexation of Estonia and Latvia by the Soviet Union took place in June 1940. Nowadays it is possible to find the successors of the Baltic nobility all around the world. Manorial system Järlepa () manor house, Estonia, a typical Baltic manor house. Rural Estonia and Latvia was to a large extent dominated by a manorial estate system, established and sustained by the Baltic nobility, up until the declaration of independence of Latvia and Estonia following the upheavals after World War I. Broadly speaking, the system was built on a sharp division between the landowning, German-speaking nobility and the Estonian- or Latvian- speaking peasantry. Serfdom was for a long time a defining characteristic of the Baltic countryside and underscored a long-lasting feudal system, until its abolishment in the Governorate of Estonia in 1816, in the Courland Governorate in 1817 and in the Governorate of Livonia in 1819 (and in the rest of the Russian Empire in 1861). Still, the nobility continued to dominate the rural parts of Estonia and Latvia via manorial estates throughout the 19th century. However, almost immediately following the declaration of independence of Estonia and Latvia, both countries enacted far-reaching land reforms which in one stroke ended the former dominance of the Baltic nobility on the countryside. The manorial system gave rise to a rich establishment of manorial estates all over present-day Estonia and Latvia, and numerous manor houses were built by the nobility. The manorial estates were agricultural centres and often incorporated, apart from the often architecturally and artistically accomplished main buildings, whole ranges of outbuildings, homes for peasants and other workers at the estates and early industrial complexes such as breweries. Parks, chapels and even burial grounds for the noble families were also frequently found on the grounds. Today these complexes form an important cultural and architectural heritage of Estonia and Latvia. For an overview of manorial estates in Estonia and Latvia, see List of palaces and manor houses in Estonia and List of palaces and manor houses in Latvia. Organization They were organized in the Estonian Knighthood in Reval, Couronian Knighthood in Mitau, and Livonian Knighthood in Riga. Viborg also had an institution to register rolls of nobles in accordance with Baltic models in the 18th century. =Noble titles in Estonia, Livonia and Couronia= *King: Magnus, King of Livonia, declared during the Livonian War *Duke: Dukes of Courland or Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, e.g. Peter August, Duke of Schleswig- Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck *Fürst (usually translated into English as Prince): e.g. Fürst Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly or Prince Lieven *Count: e.g. Count Joseph Carl von Anrep *Baron (or the corresponding title of Freiherr): e.g. Baron Henrik Magnus von Buddenbrock; Baron Arthur SR.Friedrich Johann Ludwig von Kleist-Keyserlingk (1839-1915 Mitau, Latvia) \\"House Susten Gawesen\\" Gallery File:Albert of Riga.JPGBishop of Riga Albert von Buxhoeveden File:Hermann von Salza1.jpgHermann von Salza, fourth Grand Master of the Teutonic Order File:Wolter von Plettenberg (1450-1535).jpgMaster of the Livonian Order and general File:Wrangel Herman-Ugglan.jpgHerman Wrangel, Soldier and politician File:OttoWilhelmvonFersen.jpgOtto Wilhelm von Fersen, Swedish Field Marshal File:Ernst Johann von Biron 111.PNGErnst Johann von Biron, Duke of Courland File:Gideon Ernst Freiherr von Laudon.jpgErnst Gideon von Laudon, Austrian Field Marshal File:Palen P A.jpgPeter Ludwig von der Pahlen, General and Member of the State Council of the Russian Empire File:Jacob Sievers by Joseph Grassi.JPGJacob von Sievers, Russian statesman from the Sievers family File:Munnich GIM end of 18th century.jpgBurkhard Christoph von Münnich, Russian Field Marshal, reformer of the Imperial Russian Army File:Peter von Lacy.PNGPeter von Lacy, Russian Field Marshal File:Count Franz Moritz von Lacy (oil on canvas portrait HGM).jpgFranz Moritz von Lacy, Austrian Field Marshal, son of the latter File:Kruzenshtern I F.jpgAdam Johann von Krusenstern, admiral and explorer File:Vrangel FP.jpgFerdinand von Wrangel, admiral and explorer File:Admiral Faddey Faddeyevich Bellingshausen.jpgFabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, admiral and explorer File:PGRS 1 007 Barclay de Tolly - crop.jpgMichael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, Russian Field Marshal and Minister of War File:Fabian Wilhelm von Osten- Sacken.jpgFabian Gottlieb von der Osten-Sacken, Field Marshal File:Dorothea von Lieven.jpgDorothea von Lieven, Lady-in-waiting of the Imperial Court of Russia, salonist File:1784 Darbes Elisa von der Recke anagoria.JPGElisa von der Recke, writer and poet File:Balthasar Campenhausen.jpgBalthasar von Campenhausen, Privy Councilor and Chamberlain File:Graf-Medem.jpgChristoph Johann von Medem, courtier in the courts of Prussian kings Frederick the Great, Frederick William II and Emperor of Russia Paul I File:KauffmannKruedener.jpgBarbara von Krüdener, religious mystic and author.

Overview ASPETE was founded in 2002, and took over from SELETE, a teacher training institution founded in 1959. It is a self-administered public legal entity operating in accordance with article 16, para. 5 of the Constitution, the provisions of Law 3027/2002, and the School’s Regulation. Following from the adoption of Law 3549/2007 sailer is clear that the Higher Education Institute (AEI / University) of the country consisted of two parallel sectors A) University and B) Technological Educational Institute. ASPETE belongs to the University and particularly the technology sector, together with the TEI (LAW NUM. 3549 - Reforming the institutional framework for the structure and function of higher education). The General Departments operate in accordance with the provisions of article 5, para.3 of Law 1404/1983 and are not authorized to issue degrees. The degree issued by the Departments of ASPETE qualifies its holders to teach in the corresponding discipline in secondary education; it is awarded following the completion of a course of study of eight academic semesters including the submission of a thesis and the practical work experience in the field, and is equal in status to that of TEI-s (Technological Education Institutes). In order to obtain a degree equivalent to that of TEI-s in the specific discipline, the graduates of ASPETE may attend a 1-Year Programme of Special Studies at ASPETE. Μain Entrance of ASPETE ASPETE also offers: * 1-Year programmes of pedagogical training, further training or specialization for in-service or prospective teachers. Those who have successfully completed the pedagogical training programmes are awarded a \\"Certificate of Pedagogical and Teaching Competence\\"; those who have completed further training or specialization programmes are awarded a \\"Certificate of Further Training\\" or \\"Specialization Training\\". Apart from Athens, 1-year programmes of pedagogical training (EPPAIK) are also delivered in Thessaloniki, Patras, Volos, Ioannina, Heraklion-Crete, and Sapes. * Joint Postgraduate Programmes (M.A.) in cooperation with Higher Education Institutions in Greece or abroad. ASPETE is currently involved in the planning and implementation of the following joint postgraduate programmes: :a. A joint postgraduate programme in cooperation with the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in \\"Subject Didactics and New Technologies\\". :b. A joint postgraduate programme, \\"MA in Education\\", in cooperation with Roehampton University, London. History YPEPTH and ASPAITE ASPETE's establishment in 2002 was paved by SELETE (Σ.Ε.Λ.Ε.Τ.Ε.), a Technical and Vocational Teacher Training Institute (Σχολή Εκπαιδευτικών Λειτουργών Επαγγελματικής και Τεχνικής Εκπαίδευσης), founded in 1959. SELETE's growth and mission was closely related to the economic development of Greece in the fifties. Right after World War II, the Greek government became aware of the need to place particular emphasis on the provision of vocational training in several traditional and new technical specialties. This meant developing and planning a system of Technical and Vocational Education in both, the public and private sector. Such an institutionalization entailed the systematic training of teachers of technical and vocational subjects, and it was to this end that SELETE was founded by state-law in 1959 (Law 3971/1959). ASPAITE When SELETE was first founded, the prevailing trend for the education and training of Technical and Vocational Teachers was that of the \\"add on\\" approach. That is, the focus was primarily on pedagogical training and only a small component of the curriculum pertained to technical or vocational subjects. Later, in the seventies, a parallel approach was adopted, that urged integrating pedagogical training with technical and vocational training. This new approach led to the establishment of two separate Schools under SELETE: 1\\\\. The Pedagogical Technical School (PATES), which maintained the tradition of the \\"add on\\" pedagogical approach and included the following Departments: :a. Department of Tertiary Education Graduates :b. Department of Secondary Technical & Vocational Education Graduates: 2\\\\. The Higher School of Pedagogical & Technical Education (ASETEM), which adopted the same approach at the level of Tertiary Education and included the following Departments: :a. Department of Electrical Engineering Instructors. :b. Department of Electronic Engineering Instructors. :c. Department of Mechanical Engineering Instructors. :d. Department of Civil Engineering Instructors.

Focusing on issues affecting the public realm in Toronto and nationally (four issues each per year), Spacing was originally published by the Toronto Public Space Committee in house until it was spun off as a wholly independent magazine after the first issue. History and profile Launched in December 2003, the magazine has been critically acclaimed by Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, the National Post and Utne Reader magazine, the latter of which nominated Spacing the best new title at its annual independent magazine awards in 2004, and nominated the magazine again in 2006 for Best Local Coverage and Best Design. The magazine is published three times a year. In 2006, Spacing won a Canadian National Magazine Award for \\"Best Editorial Package\\" for the 'History of our Future' issue. Noteworthy Toronto photographers Matt O'Sullivan, Rannie Turingan, Miles Storey and Sam Javanrouh, are known for the street-scene photos featured in Spacing issues. Past Spacing issues have focused on pedestrians in public space, street postering, public art, and public transit, the future plans for the city that were never developed, the top 10 public space issues for the 2006 municipal elections, and profiles of Toronto's intersections. The cover of each issue of Spacing features a prominent headline related to that issue's theme: # The Fight to Save Postering # Everyone is a Pedestrian # Work and Play # The History of Our Future # The New Beautiful City # Searching for the Better Way # What Kind of City do you Want? # At the Crossroads # Water # Is Toronto Ready to be a Green City? # The Car and the City # The People Issue # Urban Design Ideas Competition # Grey Spaces # Return of Suburbia # Animals # Rules # Oh, the Spectacle # City Hall # Winter # Canadian Public Spaces # The Hungry City # The National Issue # Disaster Spacing is also widely known for creating and selling the Toronto subway button series, which replicates the tile patterns and colours of every Toronto subway station. They have also been instrumental in putting on social events around the city, often collaborating with local political and heritage organizations. For the 2006 municipal election, Spacing hosted 'The Political Party' in which the leader contenders, Jane Pitfield and incumbent David Miller read pre-prepared speeches to a raucous crowd of over 500. Spacing has twice co-hosted 'Toronto the Good' parties at Fort York at the foot of Bathurst Street, and the Distillery District off Parliament Street by the Don River in Toronto. Advocacy for public transit is a key element of the magazine's editorial focus, and as such they have hosted parties, conferences, and exhibitions in support of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The magazine has seven daily blogs: Spacing Canada, Spacing Toronto, pacing Vancouver, Spacing Montreal, Spacing Ottawa, Spacing Atlantic and Spacing Edmonton. Spacing Calgary is expected to launch in the near future. All follow a similar group blog format providing commentary, links, and events for local urban issues. Spacing's website also features Spacing Photos, a photoblog that highlights images based on a theme captured by a wide range of Toronto photobloggers. The Spacing Votes blog was created for the 2006 city election, and was active from September 2006 to November 2006. It was written by the Spacing editors alongside guest columnist John Lorinc, the author of The New City: How the Crisis of Canada's Cities is Shaping Our Nation, and writer for Toronto Life on urban affairs. Spacing also produces the biweekly postcast, Spacing Radio hosted by CBC National Radio News anchor David Michael Lamb. The podcast launched in early 2009.

Michelle Jacques Gabriel, is a designer, painter, architect and architect of the 17th and 18th centuries. He was one of the most prominent designers of the Versailles Palace in his lifetime. For his unique creativity and selflessness, he has always been attended by Louis XIV And eventually he became a trusted advisor to the king. He made important contributions to the king during his years of service, which is one of the most important works in the construction of the Versailles palace, which once served as the lobby of the fourteenth. Michel had a mission to build the Versailles Palace throughout his life, he was also the first designer of the city's bridges in Paris. Interestingly, Gabriel's son (Ange Jacob Gabriel) continued his father's journey, and in this regard, like his father, completing the Versailles palace at the time of Louis 14 It has 15 significant roles. The Gabriel family is also home to the Cathedral of La Rochelle, the Royal Opera Royal Opera House and the Petit Trianon Palace, built on the palace of Versailles. Biography His mother was a cousin of Jules Hardouin- Mansart and his father, also named Jacques Gabriel, was a masonry contractor for the Bâtiments du Roi, the French royal works, and the designer of the Château de Choisy for the king's cousin, La Grande Mademoiselle. The younger Jacques Gabriel was appointed one of the at the Bâtiments du Roi in 1688, at the age of twenty-one. Two years later he was sent to accompany Robert de Cotte on an eighteen-month sojourn in Italy, sharpening his eye, and on his return was made one of the Autres Architectes in the Bâtiments du Roi, where he proved an efficient administrator. He was made a member of the Académie at Mansart's reorganization of that body in 1699. Pierre-Jean Mariette, who knew him well says that he was \\"expert in the conduct of building, but he could not have drawn the least jot of ornament\\". For designers of ornament, Gabriel relied on Pierre Lepautre and after Lepautre's death, on Jean Aubert, another designer trained in the Bâtiments du Roi. Gabriel succeeded Robert de Cotte as Premier Architecte du Roi of de Cotte's retirement in December 1734 and held the post until he was succeeded by his \\"vastly more gifted\\" son, Ange-Jacques Gabriel in 1742. Gabriel's work in Paris has been much remodelled. Mariette's Architecture françoise offers plates illustrating several hôtels particuliers by Gabriel. He completed the Palais Bourbon (begun by Giardini, continued by Pierre Cailleteau Lassurance). He completed the Hôtel de Lassay nearby. He was responsible for the Hôtel Peyrenc de Moras (de Biron), 1728-31. Notes \\"Il étoit expert dans la conduite du bâtiment, mais il n'auroit pas pu dessiner le moindre bout d'ornement\\"; ).

Traveling north-south, it connects the cities of Charlotte, Conover, Taylorsville, Wilkesboro and Jefferson; linking the Charlotte metropolitan area with the High Country. NC 16 is part of a three-state route 16 that connects the Charlotte region with northwestern West Virginia. Route description NC 16 is part of a three-state highway 16, that totals , from Waxhaw, North Carolina to St. Marys, West Virginia. NC 16 begins as a two-lane road in Waxhaw, from its intersection with NC 75 (Main Street), it travels north along Broome Street to Weddington, where it widens to four-lane and becomes Providence Road. After crossing the Union-Mecklenburg county line, it enters Charlotte's city limit. Along Providence Road, NC 16 connects with I-485 (exit 57) and NC 51 (Pineville-Matthews Road). In the Cherry neighborhood, Providence Road becomes 3rd Street; at the intersection of Charlottetowne Avenue, northbound NC 16 changes over to 4th Street, while southbound remains on 3rd Street. As NC 16 enters Uptown Charlotte, it merges with I-277/US 74 (John Belk Freeway, exit 2A); southbound travelers will encounter an awkward u-turn at 3rd Street to get on over to 4th Street. Going counter-clockwise around Uptown Charlotte, John Belk Freeway becomes Brookshire Freeway (with US 74 leaving to follow Independence Boulevard out of the city); at the I-77/US 21 interchange (exit 5/exit 11), NC 16's concurrency with I-277 ends and the highway becomes Brookshire Boulevard. In the Oakview Terrace neighborhood, NC 16 connects with I-85 (exit 36). In the Paw Creek neighborhood, NC 16 connects again with I-485 (exit 16) before leaving the Charlotte city limits. Crossing Rozzelles Ferry Bridge at Mountain Island Lake/Catawba River, NC 16 enters Gaston County. At Lucia, NC 16 Business splits from mainline NC 16, where it travels through Lowesville, Triangle and Denver, before merging back at Killian Crossroads. NC 16 through Gaston, Lincoln and southeast Catawba County is a four-lane expressway, with superstreet design at some at-grade intersections. Speed limit is on this portion of highway. Between Killian Crossroads and Newton, NC 16 drops down from four-lane to two-lane for . Near Newton, NC 16 Business splits and follows the old alignment through downtown Newton and Conover, while mainline NC 16 travels along a four-lane bypass east of both cities. After crossing I-40 (exit 132), NC 16 Business rejoins mainline NC 16, continuing north as a two-lane rural highway. At Lookout Shoals Lake/Catawba River, NC 16 enters Alexander County. Traveling through Millersville and Isenhour Park, NC 16 connects with US 64 and NC 90 in Taylorsville. Continuing north, the highway meanders through the Brushy Mountains, entering Wilkes County at Kilby Gap (). At Moravian Falls, NC 18 merges with NC 16 as the highway straightens out towards Wilkesboro. At US 421 (exit 286A), switches concurrency as NC 18 continues into downtown Wilkesboro. After , NC 16 splits with US 421, which continues towards Boone. In a northwesterly direction, NC 16 travels through Millers Creek and Wilbar before ascending along Piney Ridge and entering Ashe County at Horse Gap (, highest point along route). Immediately entering Ashe County is the Blue Ridge Parkway followed by NC 163 towards West Jefferson. Continuing north, through Glendale Springs, NC 16 joins NC 88 in Index, then goes northeasterly to Jefferson, where it switches concurrency with US 221\\\\. After , NC 16 splits from US 221, which continues on towards Sparta. Continuing north, it reaches the Virginia state line near Grassy Creek, where it continues on as SR 16, towards Mouth of Wilson. History NC 16's southern terminus in Waxhaw NC 16 was established in 1921 as an original state highway, traveling from SC 16, at the South Carolina state line, north through Gastonia, Dallas and Lincolnton, to NC 10, in Conover. In 1926, NC 16 was rerouted along Aspen Street in Lincolnton towards High Shoals, removing it from a short concurrency with NC 27 to Boger City. In 1929, NC 16 was extended north through Taylorsville and Wilkesboro, replacing NC 67; then northwest through Jefferson and then west to the Tennessee state lane, replacing NC 68\\\\. In 1930, US 321 was assigned onto NC 16 between the South Carolina state line to Conover. In 1934, NC 16 was truncated at US 64/US 70/US 321, in Conover; its former routing south replaced by US 321. In 1937, NC 16 was rerouted to its current alignment between Millers Creek and Glendale Springs, leaving behind secondary roads Old North Carolina Highway 16 (SR 1562 and SR 1559 in Wilkes County, SR 1648 in Ashe County) and Trading Post Road (SR 1632). Around 1940, NC 16 was extended south of Conover, via US 321 to Newton, then southeast through Denver and Charlotte, to its current southern terminus at NC 75, in Waxhaw; the new routing replaced part of NC 73 and all of NC 271 and NC 262\\\\. In 1940, NC 16 was rerouted to its current northern terminus at the Virginia state line, in Grassy Creek, with continuation as SR 92 to Mouth of Wilson. Its old alignment, through Jefferson, to the Tennessee state line was replaced by NC 88; while NC 16 replaced all of NC 681. In 1954, NC 16 was rerouted in Wilkesboro, going west on NC 268 and then on new primary road bypassing west of North Wilkesboro. Its old alignment to North Wilkesboro continued on as NC 18; while Boone Trail (SR 1500), to Cricket, was downgraded. In 1958, NC 16 was placed on new primary road west from its former alignment, Old North Carolina Highway 16 (SR 1573), bypassing Crumpler and Grassy Creek. In 1962, NC 16 was rerouted, in Charlotte, along Hawthorne Lane from Casewell Street. In 1969, NC 16 was rerouted onto the new bypass route east of Moravian Falls; then added onto new US 421 bypass, in Wilkesboro, going west then onto new primary routing north to Millers Creek. The old alignment through Cricket were downgraded to secondary roads: Curtis Bridge Road (SR 1185) and Boone Trail (SR 1372). In 1970, NC 16 was converted to one- way streets in Newton, with northbound on College Avenue and southbound on Main Street. In 1974, NC 16 was rerouted, from Trade Street, onto North Graham Street then northwest onto the Northwest Freeway (future Brookshire Freeway); its old alignment along West Trade Street and Rozzelles Ferry Road were downgraded to secondary roads. In 1977, NC 16 was converted to one-way streets, with northbound along third street and Independence Boulevard, and southbound along Elizabeth Avenue and Hawthorne Lane. Final configuration of NC 16 in Uptown Charlotte came in 1982, with its removal along Hawthorne Lane, Elizabeth Avenue and Trade Street, rerouted along 3rd/4th streets onto the John Belk Freeway then north on the Brookshire Freeway. In 1989, NC 16 was rerouted onto new Brookshire Boulevard in northwest Mecklenburg County; its former alignment along BellHaven Boulevard and Rozzelles Ferry Road were downgraded to secondary roads. In 1990, NC 16 was placed on new four-lane expressway between Mountain Island Lake and Lucia; part of its old alignment was downgraded to secondary road, while NC 273 was extended along most of it. In 2007, NC 16 was extended on new four-lane freeway between Lucia and NC 73; its old alignment through Lowesville become NC 16 Business. In 2008, NC 16 was placed on new four-lane boulevard bypass east of Newton; its old alignment becomes the second NC 16 Business loop. In 2012, NC 16 was placed on new four- lane expressway, from NC 73 to Killian Crossroads; its old alignment through Denver becomes an extension of NC 16 Business from Lowesville. =North Carolina Highway 262= North Carolina Highway 262 (NC 262) appeared in 1930 as new primary routing from NC 25, in Waxhaw, to US 74/NC 20 (7th Street), in Charlotte. In 1940, it was entirely replaced by an extension of NC 16. =North Carolina Highway 271= North Carolina Highway 271 (NC 271) appeared in 1926 running from Thrift to NC 20 near Charlotte. In 1931 the road was extended north to NC 10 in Newton. The next year the original section of NC 271 was renumbered as part NC 27A. Two years later NC 271 was truncated to Triangle with the routing from Triangle to Newton becoming a part of NC 73\\\\. In 1940 the rest of the road was renumbered as part of NC 16. =North Carolina Highway 681= North Carolina Highway 681 (NC 681) was established in 1928 as a renumbering of part of NC 68; traveling from NC 68/NC 69, in Jefferson, to the Virginia state line, at Grassy Creek. In 1931, Virginia established SR 139 to connect with NC 681 at the state line, which continued to Mouth of Wilson. In 1940, the route was decommissioned in favor of NC 16. Future NC 16, from Tower Road (SR 1895), near Killian Crossroads, to Claremont Road (SR 1801), near Newton, is to be widened to a four-lane expressway, using the superstreet design. Construction is scheduled for 2017 on the project. Junction list Special routes =Lowesville–Denver business loop= North Carolina Highway 16 Business (NC 16 Bus) was established in December 2007 when NC 16 was placed on new construction between Lucia and Lowesville, its old alignment becoming a business loop. In March 2012, NC 16 Business was extended north to its current terminus at Anderson Mountain, north of Killian Crossroads, after mainline NC 16 was moved onto new construction bypassing Denver. NC 16 Business also connects the communities of Triangle and Westport, along the western banks of Lake Norman. =Newton–Conover business loop= North Carolina Highway 16 Business (NC 16 Bus) was established in January 2008 when NC 16 was placed on new construction east Newton andConover, its old alignment becoming a business loop. In Newton, it traverses along Charlotte Highway, D Street, College Street (northbound only) and Main Street. In Conover, it traverses completely on 1st Avenue. In November, 2012, a new overpass was built over I-40; the old overpass was originally connected to the I-40 (exit 131) before exit 132 was built. =Newton truck route= North Carolina Highway 16 Truck (NC 16 Truck) provides a different routing along NC 16 Business for truck drivers, bypassing downtown Newton. The route begins west on D and C Streets (overlap with NC 10), then north on Southwest Boulevard (overlap with US 321 Bus) and finally east on 20th Avenue, reconnecting with NC 16 Business. =Taylorsville truck route= North Carolina Highway 16 Truck (NC 16 Truck) provides truck drivers, that are passing through, a different route that bypasses the downtown area of Taylorsville, via US 64 and Liledoun Road.
