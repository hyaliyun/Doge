He was born in Tuschkau (now Mƒõsto Tou≈°kov), near Pilsen, Bohemia. His father died early on, so L√§mel quickly developed an interest in the mercantile business. By the age of twenty-one, he had his own wholesale warehouse in Prague. This soon became one of the nation's most important. L√§mel was a great supporter of reforms. He encouraged improvements in sheep raising, and created new ways to card and manufacture their wool. During the Napoleonic wars, he sought to help Austria in any way he could. He bought all the supplies from magazines captured by the French, and later all the captured artillery pieces as well. In all, he saved the empire over 3,000,000 gulden. In 1809, he bought 450 tons of biscuits for the troops, declining any profits or commissions. On top of that, he loaned the government considerable sums of money, which culminated in 1809, with his lending the state his entire fortune to speed the withdrawal of French troops from Vienna. As a result of his actions for his country, he asked to be allowed to buy a house in Vienna, but in March 1811 the emperor refused his permission. Later that year, however, L√§mel was elevated to the hereditary nobility, which gave both him and his children the right to live in Vienna‚Äîwhere Jews were barely tolerated. In 1813, he was appointed commissary of the army by Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, which released him from having to quarter soldiers. Besides Austria, Saxony also benefited from L√§mel's services. Several letters from the kings there describe their respect for him. His work was one of the causes of the end to the body-tax (Leibzoll) in that kingdom. His entire life, L√§mel always tried to raise the living-conditions of his fellow Jews. In 1817, he succeeded in getting the Bohemian Jews' taxes reduced, and was told they would soon be completely abolished. Even so, he never tried to escape the taxation himself, even after he moved to Vienna. Shortly before his death, he tried to get the medieval Jewish oath abolished. L√§mel's daughter, Elise Herz, founded a school in the Zikhron Moshe neighborhood of Jerusalem in his memory, the Simon Edler von L√§mel's Stiftung.

Hikayat Hang Tuah (Jawi: ÿ≠⁄©ÿßŸäÿ© Ÿá⁄† ÿ™ŸàÿßŸá) is a Malay work of literature that tells the tale of the legendary Malay warrior, Hang Tuah and his four warrior friends - Hang Jebat, Hang Kasturi, Hang Lekir and Hang Lekiu - who lived during the height of the Sultanate of Malacca in the 15th century.Hikayat Hang Tuah - malay concordance project The author is unknown, however, it has been accepted that it was written and rewritten by several different authors from different time periods in history with the aim to improvise the tale to fit the society at that certain periods of time. Story The most memorable chapter in the work concerns a duel between Hang Tuah and his closest friend, Hang Jebat. Hang Tuah was falsely accused of adultery with one of his king's maids by his jealous rivals. Upon hearing the accusation, the king ordered Hang Tuah killed, without a further investigation of his alleged offense. Hang Tuah was secretly saved, however, by his executioner, the Bendahara. Hang Jebat was aware that Hang Tuah was being unjustly punished and in a show of support and deep loyalty for his friend, revolted against the sultan. The sultan's forces were unable to suppress Hang Jebat. The sultan later came to realize that Hang Tuah was innocent, and immediately regretted sentencing Hang Tuah to death. The Bendahara then told the sultan that Hang Tuah was still alive, and that only Hang Tuah could suppress Hang Jebat's rebellion. Hang Tuah was immediately recalled and given amnesty. After seven days of fighting, Hang Tuah managed to kill Hang Jebat. However, according to the Malay Annals, it was Hang Kasturi that fought with Hang Tuah instead of Hang Jebat. Significance and Controversies Malay culture holds the Hang Tuah legends in extremely high regard. In fact, one of the hottest debates in Malay literature centers on the duel between Hang Tuah and Hang Jebat. Hang Tuah is a symbol of absolute loyalty to a ruler while Hang Jebat symbolizes freedom and justice. Hence, there is the question of who is right. Though it is generally perceived that there were five friends, there is doubt that Hang Lekir and Hang Lekiu are indeed two different persons. In the Jawi script, the letter \\"Ô∫≠\\" (ra) and the letter \\"Ôª≠\\" (wow) look similar and those were part of the nouns \\"Leki-r\\" and \\"Leki-u\\". Due to the similarity, the differentiation of Lekir and Lekiu might be due to mistranslation. Many historians and literature experts disagree however, and point out that the five friends are a Malay version of the five warriors of Lord Krishna from the Mahabharata. Apart from that, Hikayat Hang Tuah is highly critical of the Javanese and deals with the rivalry between the Malay Sultanate of Malacca and the Javanese Majapahit Empire. In the literary work, many of the crooks and the villains were from Majapahit or Java. The king of Majapahit is depicted as an indecisive person and Majapahit's grand vizier, Gajah Mada, as sly, cunning and unsympathetic. The text is believed dated since 1700, the manuscript was dated in 1849.Hikayat Hang Tuah - malay concordance project The Hikayat Hang Tuah was first published in 1908, edited by Sulaiman bin Muhammed Nur and William Shellabear.Hunt, Robert. 2002.

A Juba Dance performance could include: *counter-clockwise turning, often with one leg raised *stomping and slapping *steps such as \\"the Jubal Jew,\\" \\"Yaller Cat,\\" \\"Pigeon Wing\\" and \\"Blow That Candle Out.\\" The dance traditionally ends with a step called \\"the Long Dog Scratch\\". Modern variations on the dance include Bo Diddley's \\"Bo Diddley Beat\\" and the step-shows of African American Greek organizations. History of the dance The Juba dance was originally brought by Kongo slaves to Charleston, South Carolina. It became an African- American plantation dance that was performed by slaves during their gatherings when no rhythm instruments were allowed due to fear of secret codes hidden in the drumming. The sounds were also used just as Yoruba and Haitian talking drums were used to communicate. The dance was performed in Dutch Guiana, the Caribbean, and the southern United States. Later in the mid-19th century, music and lyrics were added, and there were public performances of the dance. Its popularization may have indirectly influenced the development of modern tap dance. The most famous Juba dancer was William Henry Lane, or Master Juba, one of the first black performers in the United States. It was often danced in minstrel shows, and is mentioned in songs such as \\"Christy's New Song\\" and \\"Juba\\", the latter by Nathaniel Dett. Hambone was famously adopted and adapted in the 1950s by the legendary Rhythm & Blues singer Bo Diddley, in creating the distinctive \\"Bo Diddley beat\\", which was copied by a host of top rock singers.

The building's exterior depicts scenes of the life of Abraham Lincoln and is located on the southwest corner of the Quad. The building is home of the Liberal Arts and Science College. Lincoln Hall contains four floors which includes classrooms, a theater, conference rooms, and offices for faculty. Specifically, the Department of Communication, Department of Sociology, several LAS administrative offices, including Student Academic Affairs and the Dean's Office reside in Lincoln Hall (about 250 people). Over the years, Lincoln Hall has emerged as the second most used classroom building on campus, with 350 sections of classes held there each semester. Almost every student will have taken a class in Lincoln Hall by graduation. Lincoln Hall was built in 1909 after the Illinois State Legislature approved the $250,000 project. It was ready for occupation in 1911, and was finally dedicated on February 12, 1913. The prairie-influenced Italian design honors President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln Hall is considered architecturally innovative and qualifies for the National Registrar of Historic Places. A bronze plaque with the text of the Gettysburg Address hangs in the East entrance of the hall. Also in the entryway is a bronze bust of Lincoln made by Hermon Atkins MacNeil. The nose is more polished than the rest of the sculpture because many students rub it for good luck. 10 scenic panels from the life of Lincoln are on the east (Quad) exterior side of the four- story building. These panels were executed and signed by sculptor Kristian Schneider who worked for the American Terra Cotta and Ceramic Company in Crystal Lake, Ill. Schneider is best known as the sculptor who was in charge of executing the work for American architect Louis Sullivan from the time of the Auditorium Building until his death in 1924. On the north and south sides it has 20 quotes (10 on each side) from Lincoln‚Äôs speeches and letters. Half the quotes were added in the 1929 expansion of the building. The original 10 quotes (five on each side) are each flanked by two medallion portraits (20 portraits in all) of men who played prominent roles in Lincoln's life. There are also at least 69 owl figures adorning the building. The South courtyard is a memorial to those University of Illinois students who died in the First World War, dedicated by the classes of 1918 and 1919. The plaque of the Gettysburg Address in the East Foyer Five of the 10 scenic panels of Lincoln's life on the East side of the exterior of Lincoln Hall The restored East Foyer of Lincoln Hall, with the bust of Lincoln still overlooking A new classroom in Lincoln Hall There was an addition to Lincoln Hall in 1929. The renovation cost $500,000 and extended the building west to Wright Street and added a theater. Also, in 1950 Lincoln Hall became the first building on campus with wheel-chair assessable ramps. In 2005, the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois placed Lincoln Hall on its yearly Ten Most Endangered list. In July 2009, Governor Pat Quinn approved $60.3 million for the renovation of Lincoln Hall. The University of Illinois pledged to pay $6 million for the renovation. The plan brought the building up to the contemporary building code. The renovated building was ready for occupancy in July 2012. The entire exterior of the building was restored including the slate of roof tiles, windows, brick mortar, detailing, and the 30 terra cotta panels depicting quotes and portraits from Abraham Lincoln's life. On the Wright Street side of the building, the old carriage porch was restored into the formal entrance for the building. As for the interior of Lincoln Hall, the theater, east foyer, and some detailing were restored. The Lincoln Hall Theater was returned to its original look by using historical colors and preserving the decorative iron ends of seats, the tablets, and frescoes. A new stage curtain, seats, stage equipment, projectors, and a control room were added. The refinishing of the interior of Lincoln Hall included 5,000 feet of original white oak paneling, baseboard, door cast, and trim. In the entrance foyer from the Quad, the barrel vault ceiling, Gettysburg Address tablet, marble floors, and pillars were restored. The bust of Lincoln still overlooks the foyer. One of the restored decorative iron ends of the seats in Lincoln Hall Theater Since the renovation of Lincoln Hall, air conditioning and wireless connection are installed throughout the entire building. All 18 classrooms are on the first floor and each classroom has audio/visual capacity. Every classroom is equipped with projectors, display screens, chalkboards, and speakers. Office suites are on the upper floors and include conference rooms equipped for presentations and meetings with faculty. The renovated courtyard The renovation of Lincoln Hall is also eco-friendly. The roofs within the courtyards are covered with plants reducing rain runoff and increasing the lifespan of the roof. The slate roofing tiles were recycled as mulch for the grounds. Storm drains and sanitary sewers are relined instead of replaced eliminating the need for excavations and new pipe. New building materials‚Äîat least 20 percent of which is harvested and manufactured regionally‚Äîare recyclable in case the University ever desires another upgrade. Adhesives, sealants, paints, carpeting, and coatings meet low VOC (volatile organic compound) and other chemical component limits set by South Coast Air Quality Management District, Green Seal, and other environmental standards. No composite wood or agrifiber products contain urea-formaldehyde resins. Heating and cooling systems operate on non-hydrochlorofluorocarbon refrigerants to comply with the Montreal Protocol on preserving atmospheric ozone. Finally, low-flow water fixtures are installed to reduce water usage by more than 40%. The College of Liberal Arts and Science rededicated the renovated Lincoln Hall on February 12, 2013, exactly 100 years to the day of the building's original dedication. Lincoln Hall also accepts donations towards the Lincoln Hall Fund for Scholarships. People who donate $300 to $1,200 are eligible to have their name engraved in one of the tiles in the courtyard. People who donate $1,500 to $3,000 to the fund get their name engraved in one of the courtyard benches or tables.

The group's members wrote the song in collaboration with its producers, the British songwriting and production team Xenomania, based on the perception that women must expose their body to be noticed \\"Red Dress\\" was released in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2006 as the album's third single, and is the first to feature vocals by Amelle Berrabah, following the departure of Mutya Buena in December 2005. The Sugababes performed a cover of the Arctic Monkeys' song \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\" as the single's B-side. The song is an uptempo pop record that contains a sample from \\"Landslide\\", a Northern soul recording by Tony Clarke. It received positive reviews from critics, who commended its composition and Xenomania's contribution in particular. \\"Red Dress\\" peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart, number seven on the Netherlands' Dutch Top 40 chart, and inside the top twenty on the singles charts of Ireland, New Zealand and Norway. The song's music video was directed by Tim Royes in January 2006 and features the group's members in red dresses. The Sugababes performed the single as part of the set lists for their Taller in More Ways, Overloaded: The Singles Collection and Change tours, and at the Liverpool Summer Pops and Oxegen Festival music festivals. For the single release, the song was re- recorded to feature vocals from Berrabah. The 'single version' also features slightly different vocals from Buchanan and Range. Background and composition \\"Red Dress\\" was written by the Sugababes‚ÄîKeisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena and Heidi Range‚Äîin collaboration with Brian Higgins, Miranda Cooper, Tim Powell, Nick Coler, Shawn Lee, Lisa Cowling, and Bob Bradley, for the group's fourth studio album Taller in More Ways (2005). According to Range, the song was inspired by the perception that women must expose their body to be noticed. It was produced by Higgins and Xenomania, who also produced the album track \\"Ace Reject\\". \\"Red Dress\\" was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley and Powell with assistance from Richard Edgeler, and programmed by Powell and Higgins. The accompanying keyboards for the track were provided by Powell, Higgins, Tim Larcombe and Jon Shave. The bass was provided by Bradley, while the guitars were provided by Coler and Lee. \\"Red Dress\\" was recorded by Dario Dendi at Eden Studios, London, with assistance from Chris Poulter and Zoe Smith. \\"Red Dress\\" is an uptempo pop song with elements of funk. Its instrumentation consists of keyboards, bass and guitars. The song's main riff is sampled from \\"Landslide\\", a Northern soul recording by Tony Clarke. \\"Red Dress\\" features two choruses, as well as verses that are reminiscent of \\"Rapture\\" by American pop band Blondie. Talia Kraines of BBC noted that the song has a \\"foot- tapping\\" vibe to it. \\"Red Dress\\" features a girl power theme, and is lyrically about a woman who uses her sexuality to gain power over men. The Sugababes repeatedly sing the line \\"Cause I'm cooler than the red dress\\" during the beginning of the song and in the first chorus. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic noted that \\"Red Dress\\" is evocative of Xenomania's \\"frisky\\" productions for British girl group Girls Aloud. Release On 21 December 2005 it was announced that Buena had left the Sugababes. Amelle Berrabah was revealed as her replacement one day later. As a result of the line-up change, Taller in More Ways was re- released to feature Berrabah's vocals on three tracks, which included \\"Red Dress\\", \\"Gotta Be You\\" and \\"Follow Me Home\\". \\"Red Dress\\" was subsequently chosen as the third single from the album. Buena later revealed that she had been uncomfortable with the original version of the song after recording it, clarifying that she \\"absolutely hated\\" it. Upon hearing the new version with Berrabah, she became \\"quite happy they did it.\\" The song was released as a CD single and digital download on 6 March 2006 by Island Records. It is featured on the Sugababes' greatest hits album, Overloaded: The Singles Collection (2006), and the soundtrack for the 2006 film It's a Boy Girl Thing. The Sugababes confirmed in January 2006 that the B-side to \\"Red Dress\\" would be a cover version of Arctic Monkeys' debut single \\"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\\", which replaced the group's 2005 single \\"Push the Button\\" at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Upon the recording of the B-side, the Sugababes said: \\"When our bosses asked us to think of covers for the B-side, we knew which song we would all love to do.\\" Ben Thompson of The Observer praised Berrabah's \\"bluesy rasp\\" as a novelty, while Jimmy Draper of Time Out wrote: \\"It transforms the punky rave-up into a disco stomper that could make even the staunchiest pop-hater get up and dance\\". Reception =Critical response= \\"Red Dress\\" received positive reviews from music critics. Stuart McCaighy of This Is Fake DIY described the song as \\"top of the range pop\\", and considered it an example that Xenomania \\"don't keep all their best songs for Girls Aloud.\\" Peter Robinson of The Observer called the track a \\"thumping tour de force from Xenomania\\", and noted that it \\"flirts vivaciously with pop songwriting convention\\". A journalist from Virgin Media regarded \\"Red Dress\\" as an \\"irresistibly funky effort from the amorphous trio and their producers\\". AllMusic critic K. Ross Hoffman praised the bassline sampled from Tony Clarke's \\"Landslide\\", while Fiona Edwards of Digital Spy applauded the song's bass, beats, and chorus. Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine described the song as an \\"up-tempo floor-filler\\" with a \\"maximalist stomp.\\" Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Joe Muggs praised \\"Red Dress\\" as a dancefloor hit; similarly, Digital Spy critics Nick Levine and David Balls considered it one of the group's most danceable singles. A journalist from The Scotsman characterised the track as \\"mechanically groovy\\", while a Birmingham Mail critic described it as \\"a stomping anthem with attitude-drenched verses and killer chorus\\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian characterised \\"Red Dress\\" as a \\"brilliant, immaculately written pop song\\". However, Andrew Mueller of the same publication called it \\"a lazy and rather too obvious retread\\" of the group's 2004 single, \\"In the Middle\\". =Chart performance= \\"Red Dress\\" debuted at number four on the UK Singles Chart in the issue dated 18 March 2006 with 18,210 copies sold. It was the highest-ranked debut for that week. Taller in More Ways subsequently became the first album by the Sugababes to produce three UK top-five hits. \\"Red Dress\\" spent ten weeks on the chart and has sold 100,000 copies in the country, ranking as the group's fourteenth best-selling single in the UK. The song debuted and peaked at number twelve on the Irish Singles Chart. \\"Red Dress\\" appeared on the Dutch Top 40 chart at number nine, and peaked at number seven the following week for two non-consecutive weeks. It was the chart's 66th best-performing single of 2006. The single reached the top twenty on the charts in Denmark and Norway, and the top forty on the charts in Belgium (Flanders), Germany, Hungary, and Switzerland. It reached number 41 on the Austrian Singles Chart, and number 61 on the Czech Singles Chart. The song's performance throughout Europe allowed it to chart on the European Hot 100 Singles chart, where it peaked at number fourteen. \\"Red Dress\\" debuted and peaked at number 22 on the Australian Singles Chart, where it charted for twelve weeks. The single peaked at number sixteen on the New Zealand Singles Chart and was the group's third consecutive top-twenty hit in the country. A writer from the Coventry Evening Telegraph noted that the line- up change did not affect the song's commercial performance. Promotion =Music video= Amelle Berrabah, Heidi Range and Keisha Buchanan wearing red dresses in the music video for \\"Red Dress\\". The accompanying music video for \\"Red Dress\\" was directed by Tim Royes and filmed in January 2006. Berrabah revealed details about the music video during an interview that was published on the group's official website, saying: \\"We're shooting the vid this week with director Tim Royce. We're really looking forward to it as there are going to be lots of costume changes. It's going to have a catwalk show theme with lots of mad outfits ‚Äì very over the top and extravagant ‚Äì we can't wait!\\" Royes went on to direct the music video for Sugababes' single \\"Easy\\" in the same year. The Sugababes wore endorsed hosiery in scenes for the video as part of their endorsement with Pretty Polly. The video begins with close-up shots of Berrabah, Buchanan and Range; all three are wearing red dresses, while Berrabah is also wearing a black mask. Buchanan drops two large, blue feathers on the floor and begins strutting. Berrabah later removes her mask and is shown lying on a red chair. The next scene shows all three members on a fluffy, white couch in hosiery; Range, Buchanan and Berrabah are wearing blue, pink and white tops, respectively. The trio begin strutting together in a linear motion, resembling a catwalk. Range is shown on a bubble chair, and later on a red floor, resting her leg on a disco ball. Throughout the video, the Sugababes continue to strut in red dresses, corresponding with the song's theme. The video ends with Range, Buchanan and Berrabah posing with their hands on their hips. The music video for \\"Red Dress\\" earned the Sugababes a 2006 Music Vision Award nomination. The video peaked at number two on the UK TV airplay chart for three weeks. =Live performances= The Sugababes performed \\"Red Dress\\" in Turin, Italy, in February 2006 for Top of the Pops at the Winter Olympics. To promote the song's release, they performed it on 6 March 2006 at the HMV store on Oxford Street, London. The single appeared in the set list for the group's Taller in More Ways tour in 2006, and served as the shows' encore in conjunction with \\"Push the Button\\". According to Craig Hope of Chronicle Live, the song \\"came amid a sea of manic applause\\". \\"Red Dress\\" was featured in the set list for their 2007 tour in support of Overloaded: The Singles Collection. The Sugababes performed the single at the Aintree Pavilion in July 2007 as part of the Liverpool Summer Pops music event. It was the opening song of the gig, and the trio was backed by a five- piece band. The single was performed on 14 September 2007 during their gig at indig02, a live club for smaller music events. Nick Levine of Digital Spy described the performance as \\"one of the night's pulsating highlights\\". \\"Red Dress\\" was also included on the set list for the Sugababes' Change Tour in 2008. During the performance, the song was mashed with Frankie Goes to Hollywood's 1984 single \\"Two Tribes\\". Corresponding with the title of the song, the trio wore red, cellophane dresses for the performance. Berrabah named the outfit one of her favourites to wear during the tour. \\"Red Dress\\" was performed at the 2008 Oxygen Festival as part of a set list which included numerous of the group's previous singles. In June 2009, the band performed \\"Red Dress\\" at the Cannock Chase Forrest as part of a 75-minute show, and at Canterbury, Kent as the thirteenth song on the set list. \\"Red Dress\\" was one of many songs that the group performed on 10 July 2009 at the Riverside Ground in County Durham, England. The fourth line-up of the Sugababes, consisting of Range, Berrabah and Jade Ewen, performed the single in November 2010 at the Yas Hotel in Abu Dhabi, as part of a set list. The trio played the song in September 2011 during their gig at London's nightclub, G-A-Y, in which they wore coordinating, pastel rubber outfits.

Both Karnes County and Karnes City, its county seat, are named after him. Biography Henry Wax Karnes, a native of Tennessee, first visited Texas in 1828. He returned to Texas during the Texas Revolution; he was one of Sam Houston's most important spies and worked closely with Deaf Smith. He fought with Smith, Segu√≠n, and James Bowie in the battle of Concepci√≥n and then joined the siege of Bexar. While serving in a volunteer company, Karnes was sent with Smith to learn the fate of the Alamo. By the time of the Battle of San Jacinto, he had become a captain and later was a colonel. After the war, he served in the Texas Rangers. Karnes and Seguin teamed up as part of a campaign to calm the Comanche threat in Texas.Moore (2006), p. 228. He was wounded by an arrow in the Arroyo Seco Fight, an operation against the Comanches in August 1838.Telegraph and Texas Register, Vol. 4, Saturday, September 1, 1838 He died of yellow fever during 1840 in San Antonio, Texas. Karnes was buried outside of Old Campo Santos Cemetery as he was a Protestant, and only Catholics were allowed to be buried there. This cemetery was later moved and Santa Rosa Hospital was built in its place across from Milam Park. A monument to Karnes was erected in the park in 1932, as this was the closest to his grave that the city knew of. Relatives Contrary to popular belief, Karnes was not the great-grand-uncle of Patsy Yvonne Karnes aka Patsy Swayze, the mother of actors Patrick Swayze and Don Swayze. They descend from a different Henry Karnes from Tennessee. There are many Karnes descendants living in Texas to this day.

The decision to form the Royal Commission was taken by the Fourth Labour government, after the Labour party had received more votes, yet won fewer seats than the National Party in both the 1978 and 1981 elections. It was also a reaction to the power displayed by Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, whose action of illegally abolishing the Superannuation scheme in 1975 without any repercussions highlighted the need to distribute power in a more democratic way. The Royal Commission's report Towards a Better Democracy was instrumental in effecting New Zealand to change its electoral system from first-past-the-post to mixed member proportional.  Membership  The Royal Commission consisted of # John Wallace (Chairman) # John Darwin # Kenneth Keith # Richard Mulgan # Whetumarama Wereta (MƒÅori representative)  Criteria  The Royal Commission established ten criteria for choosing an electoral system. The criteria were not weighed equally by the commission, and a balance was sought. 1\\\\. Fairness between political parties ::The number of seats in the House should roughly reflect the number of votes received 2\\\\. Effective representation of minority and special interest groups ::The membership of Parliament should reflect the divisions of society 3\\\\. Effective MƒÅori representation ::MƒÅori should be fairly and effectively represented in House ::Treaty of Waitangi & aboriginal rights should be respected 4\\\\. Political Integration ::All groups should respect views taken by others in society 5\\\\. Effective representation of constituents ::An electoral system should encourage close links and accountability to the community 6\\\\. Effective voter participation ::The voting system should be understandable ::Power should be hands of voters to make/unmake governments 7\\\\. Effective government ::Governments should be able to act decisively and fulfil their responsibilities to their voters 8\\\\. Effective Parliament ::Parliament should be independent from government control ::Parliament should be able to authorise spending and taxation as well as legislate 9\\\\. Effective parties ::Political parties should be formulating policy and providing representation 10\\\\. Legitimacy ::Fair and reasonable to the community The Commission evaluated first-past-the-post, single transferable vote, Supplementary Member, Alternative Vote and mixed member proportional.  Recommendations  # The Commission unanimously recommended the adoption of mixed member proportional, with a threshold of 4% and that a referendum be held before or at the 1987 election. # They also recommended that the MƒÅori seats be abolished, with MƒÅori parties instead receiving representation if they did not pass the threshold. # That the number of MPs raise to 120 (although they considered 140 would be ideal, they realised that it would receive too much public backlash). # The term of Parliament be raised to four years. # The Commission recommended that citizens initiated referendums not be implemented. However, they were in 1993.  Implementation  In 1992 and 1993, two referendums were held, resulting in the adoption of MMP. The threshold was changed to 5% and the MƒÅori seats were retained instead of allowing MƒÅori parties to avoid the threshold. The number of MPs was increased to 120. A referendum was held on increasing the term of Parliament to four years in 1990. It failed to pass; Parliament continues operating under a three-year term.

The book contrasts the worldviews of pro-choice and anti-abortion activists, arguing that the two sides of the debate on abortion are rooted in different sets of values and ideas about women's roles. Her thesis was recently criticized by political scientist Jon Shields in a retrospective in Contemporary Sociology as well as by the New York Times journalist Ross Douthat.https://www.cmc.edu/sites/default/files/govt/FacMember/Shields/Shields_Politics_Motherhood.pdfhttps://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/opinion/sunday/douthat- divided-by-abortion-united-by-feminism.html?_r=0 The book also explores the historical connection between the rise of both pro-life and pro-choice sentiments, and the desire on the part of physicians to professionalize their image. She is careful in the book not to reveal her personal position on abortion, but her 1992 article \\"She's Come To You For An Abortion\\" in Harper's Magazine reveals that she is pro-choice. In her book Dubious Conceptions, Luker discusses the evolution of public perceptions about teenage pregnancy during the twentieth century, and argues that teenage pregnancy should be recognized not as a distinct social problem, but as a symptom of the need for better approaches to poverty.

One of the first works of juvenile fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes, the story relates the adventures of three boys marooned on a South Pacific island, the only survivors of a shipwreck. A typical Robinsonade ‚Äì a genre of fiction inspired by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe ‚Äì and one of the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them. In the early 20th century, the novel was considered a classic for primary school children in the UK, and in the United States it was a staple of high-school suggested reading lists. Modern critics consider the book's worldview to be dated and imperialist, but although less popular today, The Coral Island was adapted into a four-part children's television drama broadcast by ITV in 2000. Background =Biographical background and publication= Born in Edinburgh in 1825, and raised there, Ballantyne was the ninth of ten children and the youngest son. Tutored by his mother and sisters, his only formal education was a brief period at Edinburgh Academy in 1835‚Äì37. At the age of 16 he travelled to Canada, where he spent five years working for the Hudson's Bay Company, trading with the first nations for furs. He returned to Scotland in 1847 and for some years worked for the publisher Messrs Constable, first as a clerk and then as a partner in the business. During his time in Canada he had helped to pass the time by writing long letters to his mother ‚Äì to which he attributed \\"whatever small amount of facility in composition [he] may have acquired\\" ‚Äì and began his first book. Ballantyne's Canadian experiences formed the basis of his first novel, The Young Fur Traders, published in 1856, the year he decided to become a full-time writer and embarked on the adventure stories for the young with which his name is popularly associated. Ballantyne never visited the coral islands of the South Pacific, relying instead on the accounts of others that were then beginning to emerge in Britain, which he exaggerated for theatrical effect by including \\"plenty of gore and violence meant to titillate his juvenile readership\\". His ignorance of the South Pacific caused him to erroneously describe coconuts as being soft and easily opened; a stickler for accuracy he resolved that in future, whenever possible, he would write only about things he had personal experience of. Ballantyne wrote The Coral Island while staying in a house on the Burntisland seafront opposite Edinburgh on the Firth of Forth in Fife. According to Ballantyne biographer Eric Quayle he borrowed extensively from an 1852 novel by the American author James F. Bowman, The Island Home. He also borrowed from John Williams's Narrative of Missionary Enterprises (1837), to the extent that cultural historian Rod Edmond has suggested that Ballantyne must have written one chapter of The Coral Island with Williams's book open in front of him, so similar is the text. Edmond describes the novel as \\"a fruit cocktail of other writing about the Pacific\\", adding that \\"by modern standards Ballantyne's plagiarism in The Coral Island is startling\\". Although the first edition is dated 1858 it was on sale in bookshops from early December 1857; dating books forward was a common practice at the time, especially during the Christmas period, to \\"preserve their newness\\" into the new year. The Coral Island is Ballantyne's second novel, and has never been out of print. He was an exceedingly prolific author who wrote more than 100 books in his 40-year career. According to professor and author John Rennie Short, Ballantyne had a \\"deep religious conviction\\", and felt it his duty to educate Victorian middle- class boys ‚Äì his target audience ‚Äì in \\"codes of honour, decency, and religiosity\\". The first edition of The Coral Island was published by T. Nelson & Sons, who in common with many other publishers of the time had a policy when accepting a manuscript of buying the copyright from the author rather than paying royalties; as a result, authors generally did not receive any income from the sale of subsequent editions. Ballantyne received between ¬£50 and ¬£60, equivalent to about ¬£6500 , but when the novel's popularity became evident and the number of editions increased he tried unsuccessfully to buy back the copyright. He wrote bitterly to Nelsons in 1893 about the copyrights they held on his books while he had earned nothing: \\"for thirty-eight years [you have] reaped the whole profits\\". The Coral Island ‚Äì still considered a classic ‚Äì was republished by Penguin Books in 1995, in their Popular Classics series. =Literary and historical context= Published during the \\"first golden age of children's fiction\\", The Coral Island began a trend in boys' fiction by using boys as the main characters, a device now commonplace in the genre. It preserves, according to literary critic Minnie Singh, the moralizing aspects of didactic texts, but does so (and in this regard it is a \\"founding text\\") by the \\"congruence of subject and implied reader\\": the story is about boys and written retrospectively as though by a boy, for an audience of boys. According to literary critic Frank Kermode, The Coral Island \\"could be used as a document in the history of ideas\\". A scientific and social background for the novel is found in Darwinism, of the natural and the social kind. For instance, published a year before Origin of Species (whose ideas were already being circulated and discussed widely), Charles Darwin's 1842 The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs was one of the best-known contemporary accounts of the growth of coral. Ballantyne had been reading books by Darwin and by his rival Alfred Russel Wallace; in later publications he also acknowledged the naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes. The interest in evolutionary theory was reflected in much contemporary popular literature, and social Darwinism was an important factor contributing to the world view of the Victorians and their empire building. Plot summary The story is written as a first person narrative from the perspective of 15-year-old Ralph Rover, one of three boys shipwrecked on the coral reef of a large but uninhabited Polynesian island. Ralph tells the story retrospectively, looking back on his boyhood adventure: \\"I was a boy when I went through the wonderful adventures herein set down. With the memory of my boyish feelings strong upon me, I present my book especially to boys, in the earnest hope that they may derive valuable information, much pleasure, great profit, and unbounded amusement from its pages.\\" alt=Black and white illustration The account starts briskly; only four pages are devoted to Ralph's early life and a further fourteen to his voyage to the Pacific Ocean on board the Arrow. He and his two companions ‚Äì 18-year-old Jack Martin and 13-year-old Peterkin Gay ‚Äì are the sole survivors of the shipwreck. The narrative is in two parts. The first describes how the boys feed themselves, what they drink, the clothing and shelter they fashion, and how they cope with having to rely on their own resources. The second half of the novel is more action-packed, featuring conflicts with pirates, fighting between the native Polynesians, and the conversion efforts of Christian missionaries. Fruit, fish and wild pigs provide plentiful food, and at first the boys' life on the island is idyllic. They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions: a broken telescope, an iron-bound oar, and a small axe. Their first contact with other humans comes after several months when they observe two large outrigger canoes in the distance, one pursued by the other. The two groups of Polynesians disembark on the beach and engage in battle; the victors take fifteen prisoners and kill and eat one immediately. But when they threaten to kill one of the three women captured, along with two children, the boys intervene to defeat the pursuers, earning them the gratitude of the chief, Tararo. The next morning they prevent another act of cannibalism. The natives leave, and the boys are alone once more. More unwelcome visitors then arrive in the shape of British pirates, who make a living by trading or stealing sandalwood. The three boys hide in a cave, but Ralph is captured when he ventures out to see if the intruders have left and is taken on board the pirate schooner. He strikes up a friendship with one of the crew, Bloody Bill, and when the ship calls at the island of Emo to trade for more wood Ralph experiences many facets of the island's culture: the popular sport of surfing, the sacrificing of babies to eel gods, rape, and cannibalism. alt=Black and white illustration Rising tensions result in the inhabitants attacking the pirates, leaving only Ralph and Bloody Bill alive. The pair succeed in making their escape in the schooner, but Bill is mortally wounded. He makes a death- bed repentance for his evil life, leaving Ralph to sail back to the Coral Island alone, where he is reunited with his friends. The three boys sail to the island of Mango, where a missionary has converted some of the population to Christianity. There they once again meet Tararo, whose daughter Avatea wishes to become a Christian against her father's wishes. The boys attempt to take Avatea in a small boat to a nearby island the chief of which has been converted, but en route they are overtaken by one of Tararo's war canoes and taken prisoner. They are released a month later after the arrival of another missionary, and Tararo's conversion to Christianity. The \\"false gods\\" of Mango are consigned to the flames, and the boys set sail for home, older and wiser. They return as adults for another adventure in Ballantyne's 1861 novel The Gorilla Hunters, a sequel to The Coral Island. Genre and style All Ballantyne's novels are, in his own words, \\"adventure stories for young folks\\", and The Coral Island is no exception. It is a Robinsonade, a genre of fiction inspired by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), one of the most popular of its type, and one of the first works of juvenile fiction to feature exclusively juvenile heroes. Susan Maher, professor of English, notes that in comparison to Robinson Crusoe such books generally replaced some of the original's romance with a \\"pedestrian realism\\", exemplified by works such as The Coral Island and Frederick Marryat's 1841 novel Masterman Ready, or the Wreck of the Pacific. Romance, with its attention to character development, was only restored to the genre of boys' fiction with Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island argues literary critic Lisa Honaker. The Coral Island, for all its adventure, is greatly occupied with the realism of domestic fiction (the domain of the realist novel); Ballantyne devotes about a third of the book to descriptions of the boys' living arrangements. The book exhibits a \\"light- hearted confidence\\" in its description of an adventure that was above all fun. As Ralph says in his preface: \\"If there is any boy or man who loves to be melancholy and morose, and who cannot enter with kindly sympathy into the regions of fun, let me seriously advise him to shut my book and put it away. It is not meant for him.\\" Professor of English has observed that \\"the swift movement of the story from coastal England to exotic Pacific island is similar to the swift movement from the real world to the fantastic in children's fantasy\\". To a modern reader Ballantyne's books can seem overly concerned with accounts of flora and fauna, an \\"ethnographic gloss\\" intended to suggest that their settings are real places offering adventures to those who can reach them. They can also seem \\"obtrusively pious\\", but according to John Rennie Short, the moral tone of Ballantyne's writing is compensated for by his ability to tell a \\"cracking good yarn in an accessible and well-fashioned prose style\\". Themes The major themes of the novel revolve around the influence of Christianity, the importance of social hierarchies, and the inherent superiority of civilised Europeans over the South Sea islanders; Martine Dutheil, professor of English, considers the novel \\"a key text mapping out colonial relations in the Victorian period\\". The basic subject of the novel is popular and widespread: \\"castaway children assuming adult responsibilities without adult supervision\\", and The Coral Island is considered the classic example of such a book. The supposed civilising influence of missionaries in spreading Christianity among the natives of the South Seas is an important theme of the second half of the story; as Jack remarks to Peterkin, \\"all the natives of the South Sea Islands are fierce cannibals, and they have little respect for strangers\\". Modern critics view this aspect of the novel less benevolently; Jerry Phillips, in a 1995 article, sees in The Coral Island the \\"perfect realiz[ation]\\" of \\"the official discourse of 19th century Pacific imperialism\\", which he argues was \\"obsessed with the purity of God, Trade, and the Nation.\\" The importance of hierarchy and leadership is also a significant element. The overarching hierarchy of race is informed by Victorian concepts, influenced by the new theories of evolution proposed by Darwin and others. In morals and culture, the natives are placed lower on the evolutionary ladder than are Europeans, as is evidenced in the battle over the native woman Avatea, which pits \\"the forces of civilization versus the forces of cannibalism\\". Another hierarchy is seen in the organisation of the boys. Although Jack, Ralph and Peterkin each have a say in how they should organise themselves, ultimately the younger boys defer to Jack, \\"a natural leader\\", particularly in a crisis, forming a natural hierarchy. The pirates also have a hierarchy, but one without democracy, and as a consequence are wiped out. The hierarchy of the natives is imposed by savagery. Ballantyne's message is that leaders should be respected by those they lead, and govern with their consent. This educational message is especially appropriate considering Ballantyne's adolescent audience, \\"the future rulers of the world\\". Modern critics find darker undertones in the novel. In an essay published in College English in 2001, Martine Dutheil states that The Coral Island can be thought of as epitomising a move away from \\"the confidence and optimism of the early Victorian proponents of British imperialism\\" toward \\"self-consciousness and anxiety about colonial domination\\". She locates this anxiety in what she calls the \\"rhetoric of excess\\" that features in the descriptions of cannibalism, and especially in the accounts of Fijian savagery provided by Bloody Bill (most notably that of the sacrifice of children to the eel gods) and the missionary, a representative of the London Missionary Society, an \\"emblematic figure of colonial fiction\\". Others have also linked popular boys' fiction of the period with imperialism; Joseph Bristow's Empire Boys (1991) claimed to see an imperialist manhood,' which shaped British attitudes towards empire and masculinity.\\" The novel's portrayal of Pacific culture and the effects of colonisation are analyzed in studies such as Brian Street's The Savage in Literature: Representations of 'Primitive' Society in English Fiction (1975) and Rod Edmond's Representing the South Pacific: Colonial Discourse from Cook to Gauguin (1998). The domination imposed by \\"geographical mapping of a territory and policing of its native inhabitants\\" is an important theme in the novel both specifically and in general, in the topography of the island as mapped by the boys and the South Pacific's \\"eventual subjugation and conversion to Christianity\\", a topic continued in Stevenson's Treasure Island. The exploration of the relationship between nature and evangelical Christianity is another typically Victorian theme. Coral connects the two ideas. Literary critic Katharine Anderson explains that coral jewellery, popular in the period, had a \\"pious significance\\". The \\"enchanted garden\\" of coral the boys discover at the bottom of their island's lagoon is suggestive of \\"missionary encounters with the societies of the Pacific Island\\". In Victorian society coral had been given an \\"evangelical framing\\", and the little \\"coral insect\\" responsible for building coral reefs mirrored the \\"child reader's productive capacity as a fundraiser for the missionary cause\\"; literary critic Michelle Elleray discusses numerous children's books from the early to mid-19th century, including The Coral Island, in which coral plays such an educational role. The novel's setting provides the backdrop for a meditation in the style of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who promoted an educational setting in which lessons are provided by direct interactions with the natural world rather than by books and coercive teachers. Singh points out that Rousseau, in Emile, or On Education, promotes the reading and even imitation of Robinson Crusoe; literary critic Fiona McCulloch argues that the unmediated knowledge the boys gain on their coral island resembles the \\"direct language for children\\" Rousseau advocates in Emile. Critical reception The Coral Island was an almost instant success, and was translated into almost every European language within fifty years of its publication. It was widely admired by its contemporary readers, although modern critics view the text as featuring \\"dated colonialist themes and arguably racist undertones\\". Ballantyne's blend of blood-thirsty adventure and pious imperialism appealed not just to his target juvenile audience but also to their parents and teachers. He is today mainly remembered for The Coral Island, to the exclusion of much of his other work. The novel was still considered a classic for English primary school children in the early 20th century. In the United States it was long a staple of suggested reading lists for high-school students; such a list, discussed in a 1915 article in The English Journal, recommends the novel in the category \\"Stories for Boys in Easy Style\\". A simplified adaptation of the book was recommended in the 1950s for American 12‚Äì14 year olds. Although mostly neglected by modern scholars and generally considered to be dated in many aspects, in 2006 it was voted one of the top twenty Scottish novels at the 15th International World Wide Web Conference. Influence Robert Louis Stevenson's 1882 novel Treasure Island was in part inspired by The Coral Island, which he admired for its \\"better qualities\\", as was J. M. Barrie's character Peter Pan; both Stevenson and Barrie had been \\"fervent boy readers\\" of the novel. Novelist G. A. Henty was also influenced by Ballantyne's audience-friendly method of didactism. William Golding's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies was written as a counterpoint to (or even a parody of) The Coral Island, and Golding makes explicit references to it. At the end of the novel, for instance, one of the naval officers who rescues the children mentions the book, commenting on the hunt for one of their number, Ralph, as a \\"jolly good show. Like the Coral Island\\". Jack also makes an appearance in Lord of the Flies as Jack Merridew, representing the irrational nature of the boys. Indeed, Golding's three central characters ‚Äì Ralph, Piggy and Jack ‚Äì are caricatures of Ballantyne's heroes. Despite having enjoyed The Coral Island many times as a child, Golding strongly disagreed with the views that it espoused, and in contrast Lord of the Flies depicts the English boys as savages themselves, who forget more than they learn, unlike Ballantyne's boys. Golding described the relationship between the two books by saying that The Coral Island \\"rotted to compost\\" in his mind, and in the compost \\"a new myth put down roots\\". Neither is the idyllic nature of Ballantyne's coral island to be found on Stevenson's treasure island, which is unsuitable for settlement \\"but exists merely as a site from which to excavate treasure, a view consistent with the late-Victorian imperial mission\\" according to Honaker. Television adaptations The Coral Island was adapted into a children's television series in a joint venture between Thames Television and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1980, first shown on Australian and British television in 1983. It was also adapted into a four-part children's television drama by Zenith Productions, broadcast by ITV in 2000.

Ruddimans, 1742. In fact the figure of the Earth is far less oblate than this, since the Earth is not homogeneous, but has a dense iron core.

The formula predicts two possible equilibrium figures when \\\\Omega\\\\rightarrow 0, one is a sphere (e\\\\rightarrow 0) and the other is a very flattened spheroid (e\\\\rightarrow 1). The maximum angular velocity occurs at eccentricity e=0.92996 and its value is \\\\Omega^2/(\\\\pi G\\\\rho)=0.449331, so that above this speed, no equilibrium figures exist. The angular momentum L is :\\\\frac{L}{\\\\sqrt{GM^3\\\\bar{a}}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt 3}{5} \\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{\\\\bar{a}}\\\\right)^2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\Omega^2}{\\\\pi G\\\\rho}} \\\\ , \\\\quad \\\\bar{a} = (a^2c)^{1/3} where M is the mass of the spheroid and \\\\bar{a} is the mean radius, the radius of a sphere of the same volume as the spheroid. Stability For a Maclaurin spheroid of eccentricity greater than 0.812670, a Jacobi ellipsoid of the same angular momentum has lower total energy. If such a spheroid is composed of a viscous fluid, and if it suffers a perturbation which breaks its rotational symmetry, then it will gradually elongate into the Jacobi ellipsoidal form, while dissipating its excess energy as heat. This is termed secular instability. However, for a similar spheroid composed of an inviscid fluid, the perturbation will merely result in an undamped oscillation. This is described as dynamic (or ordinary) stability. A Maclaurin spheroid of eccentricity greater than 0.952887 is dynamically unstable. Even if it is composed of an inviscid fluid and has no means of losing energy, a suitable perturbation will grow (at least initially) exponentially. Dynamic instability implies secular instability (and secular stability implies dynamic stability).

However, a month after being declared the winner, Kraft tested positive for Erythropoietin, better known as EPO. She and her coach, Martin Malleirer, admitted to the decision to take the performance-enhancing drug. As a result, she was stripped of her title and the second-place finisher Natascha Badmann was awarded her fifth Ironman world title. Kraft was banned by the German Triathlon Federation (DTU), for one year, after a positive drugs test. This ban ended on 12 November 2005. The privately owned World Triathlon Corporation banned Kraft from all Ironman events worldwide until 16 October 2006. As a result of Kraft and Katja Schumacher's doping cases, the DTU created the Elitepass: only Elitepass holders would be eligible for prize money, and they would be subject to unannounced drug testing. Comeback After the end of her German ban, she trained in Clermont, Florida. She joined the Braunschweig club Tri-Lions and applied for an Elitepass from the DTU. On 12 February 2006, she entered her first post-ban race, winning second place at the 15th Triathlon De Santos in Brazil. In August 2006, she won the German championship at the half Iron distance race in Kulmbach with a lead of 12 minutes. In May 2007 she won the Ironman Brazil, and on 3 November of the same year, she won the Florida Ironman with a time of 9 hours 5 minutes and 35 seconds, breaking the course record by 20 minutes.

The film is directed by Uwe Boll and stars Til Schweiger. It was a major box office bomb and, like Boll's other films, a critical disappointment. Plot The film begins in a jungle at nighttime as a mercenary squad scouts the nearby area looking out for modified super soldiers, only to be slaughtered by a lone mutant. Dr. Krieger is informed by his men about the event and asked to stop the research, Krieger refusing to do so. The film then skips to Valerie Cardinal, a journalist who is secretly receiving information about the events and the actual research by an informant. They arrange a meeting with her at the Island. To get to the island, Valerie hires skipper Jack Carver to take her to the Island. Soon after, she reveals to Jack that her informant is named Max and he served in the Special Forces with him and that he is her uncle. Jack denies having known him. Jack then takes her to the island. However, it turns out that the mercenaries caught Max and turned up at the spot he was going to meet Valerie. The mercenaries capture Valerie and destroy Jack's boat, though Jack manages to escape. Jack steals a gun from a nearby guard after knocking him out and rescues Valerie. Jack suggests that they leave the island, though Valerie refuses to leave without Max. They hijack a mercenary vehicle and proceed to the central base where they both are captured. Jack is jailed in an empty cell with a former member of the cooking staff. While they attempt to escape, Valerie is forced to have dinner with Krieger, who orders the mercenaries to unleash Max (who is now a mutant) on Jack and Cook when he sees them on camera, trying to escape. After a brief fight, Jack manages to convince Max who he really is. Max who is convinced, but still mentally fragile, assaults the mercenaries and releases the other mutants. The mutants attempt to kill all the humans on the Island. After taking heavy casualties, half of the Mercenary Forces realize that there is no hope in sight of controlling the mutants and decide to team up with Jack and escape the island. The other half of the mercenaries remain loyal to Krieger and try to retain control of the island. The two sides begin to battle each other and the mutants at the same time. As the battle goes on, Max is shot and killed by Krieger's sadistic female second-in-command Katia, and most of the mercenaries on the island are killed by the mutants. This leaves only Krieger and his second-in-command, Jack and Valerie, and the cook alive. While trying to find Valerie, Jack engages in a fight with Katia. Jack finds Valerie and tells her about Max. The cook, Jack, and Valerie hijack a boat at the docks. When Krieger arrives at the docks shortly after while being chased by mutants, he finds the boat missing. He turns around and screams as the screen fades to black. The film ends with Jack in a relationship with Valerie, while also continuing his work as a skipper. Valerie, like Jack, also continues her work with the CIA. Jack hires the cook for his boat. Cast Production Uwe Boll gained the rights to a Far Cry movie from Crytek, purportedly before the game was released. In an October 2006 interview, Uwe Boll said that production on Far Cry would begin in May 2007. The film was released on the second of October, 2008, in Germany. Reception Like most other films directed by Uwe Boll, Far Cry received negative reviews with most critics saying it does the games no justice. IGN gave the film a 3 out of 10 and said \\"Perhaps one day game companies will learn to be more particular about the directors they choose to realize their products on the big screen. Fans of the game, and fans of movies in general, would be wise to avoid this one at all costs. Unless, of course, your purpose is to mock.\\" Reboot Variety reported that Ubisoft is developing another Far Cry film (based on the video game Far Cry 3) along with a Watch Dogs and Raving Rabbids film, this time, produced by Ubisoft Motion Pictures.

She is a prominent figure in Hong Kong music and popular culture and was once frequently referred to in the media as a \\"grass-roots diva\\" and \\"goddess.\\" She is known for songs which deal with social issues and the struggle for democracy in Hong Kong. Tse's main claim to fame was her 2008 song, \\"Wedding Invitation Street\\" (ÂõçÂ∏ñË°ó), which was widely successful and swept many prestigious year-end music awards. This was followed by a string of further hits including \\"Song of the Year\\" (Âπ¥Â∫¶‰πãÊ≠å), Lone Village (Áç®ÂÆ∂Êùë), \\"Hillwood Road\\" (Â±±ÊûóÈÅì) and viral hits such as \\"The Egg and the Lamb\\" (ÈõûËõãËàáÁæîÁæä) and \\"Rashomon\\" (ÁæÖÁîüÈñÄ). She is considered to be one of the four leading female Cantopop singers of the 2000s‚Äì2010s, along with Miriam Yeung, Joey Yung, and Denise Ho. Tse is married to fellow Hong Kong singer Louis Cheung, with whom she has two children. Life and musical career =Early life and discovery= Kay Tse was born on 13 March 1977 in Tai Po, Hong Kong, the only child of a Hakka family. She first learned to play the piano at the age of six, and has since obtained eighth-grade level. Tse attended Valtorta College, a state-funded Catholic high-school in Tai Po and obtained 21 points in her Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination. Tse began her studies at the University of Hong Kong in 2002, majoring in American Studies, and graduated in 2005. During this time, she entered a university singing competition, performing the Stefanie Sun song, \\"Believe\\" (Áõ∏‰ø°). One of the judges was music producer Adrian Chow (Âë®ÂçöË≥¢), who was so impressed that he would sign her onto his independent label, \\"Ban Ban Music\\". At the time, Tse was also working part-time as a piano teacher and taught English. =2005‚Äì2006: Career beginnings= Tse's debut album, Kay One, was released on 5 May 2005. The album combines an eclectic mix of pop, rock and jazz styles. Kay One spawned five singles, including lead single \\"Beauties\\" (ÂßøËâ≤‰ªΩÂ≠ê), an up-tempo, pop-rock song which criticizes the beauty imperative within an Asian context. Follow-up single \\"The One and Only\\" (ÊàëÊ≠å„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇÊïÖÊàëÂú®) is a slow ballad which showcases Tse's wide vocal range. On 23 December 2005, the album received a special re-release edition titled Kay One Plus, with a new bonus track called \\"Follow Me\\" (Ë∑üÊàëËµ∞). The song contains folk elements and deals with her music and her fans. It topped the TVB chart and became her first number one song. In addition, the album contains two non- Cantonese songs: The One and Only, an English cover of the second single; and \\"Plastic Rose\\" (Â°ëËÜ†Áé´Áë∞), the mandarin version of \\"Beauties.\\" In 2006, Tse started garnering more media attention, first losing her dental braces she had worn for many years. On 2 June, she released the EP, K sus2, which contained the first single \\"Gloomy Festival\\" (ÊÑÅ‰∫∫ÁØÄ). The single received positive critical reception for raising concern about disadvantaged groups in society. It garnered a decent amount of airplay and became her first single to peak within the top 10 of all four major charts, reaching no. 1 on both the TVB and Commercial Radio charts, and winning her first year-end song award at the 2006 Ultimate Song Chart Awards. On 12 October 2006, Tse joined major label Cinepoly Records, a decision made by Tse alongside her manager Sammy Haze and music producer Adrian Chow, on the condition that they be granted a level of artistic freedom. =2007‚Äì2011: Cinepoly period= The First Day, pregnancy and hiatus (2007) Tse performing at the Sina Awards in 2007. Shortly after signing with Cinepoly Records, Tse held a press conference on 26 November 2007 to announce that she had been three months pregnant, with plans to take a maternity leave after a farewell concert and a new album. On 5 January 2007, Tse held her farewell concert, Kay Tse: The First Day Live, at KITEC, co-presented by Ban Ban Music and Commercial Radio Hong Kong. Labelmates Hins Cheung, Kelvin Kwan, and Wilfred Lau performed as guests. Onstage, Tse remarked that it had been exactly 2 years since she debuted her first single, \\"Beauties\\" and took the opportunity to premiere a new single, \\"The First Day.\\" The First Day was the first album Tse recorded for Cinepoly. Released on 18 January 2007, the album contained three new songs and nine newly rearranged versions of previous songs. Lead single \\"Problems upon Problems\\" (ÁØÄÂ§ñÁîüÊûù) became Tse's most successful single at that point, reaching three of the four major singles charts. A second edition of the album was released in March, which included a bonus DVD of her farewell concert. In late January, Tse married fellow Hong Kong songwriter and recording-artist Louis Cheung. The ceremony took place in Regal Airport Hotel near Hong Kong International Airport.http://bbs.ent.163.com/bbs/jiepai/75237,3.html She gave birth to her son on 11 December 2007. Following the birth of her son and almost a year's hiatus from music, Tse released a new songs and greatest hits compilation, 3/8, in December 2007. The compilation's three new songs, \\"3/8\\", \\"Zhong Wu Yan\\" (ÈçæÁÑ°Ëâ∑) and \\"The Retired Life of Wonder Woman\\" (Á•ûÂ•áÂ•≥‰ø†ÁöÑÈÄÄ‰ºëÁîüÊ¥ª) were all released as singles, with the latter two reaching number 1 on various charts. Tse explained that the album title, 3/8, refers to the eight stages of life, and the three-eights that she has traveled. This refers especially to her musical life, summing up her musical journey in the past three years. \\"Wedding Invitation Street\\" and rise to prominence (2008) 2008 was a watershed moment for Tse's music career. Her first single of the year, \\"17 Degrees\\" (17Â∫¶) topped three of the four major singles charts, with second single \\"Wedding Invitation Street\\" becoming the most well-known song of 2008 (ÂõçÂ∏ñË°ó). \\"Wedding Invitation Street\\" was released amidst controversy over the redevelopment of Wan Chai's Lee Tung Street, from which the songs takes its title. Although appearing to be a love song about letting go on the surface, many have read it as a potent critique on the city's urban renewal plans. The song made a lasting impression on Hong Kong's collective consciousness, and marks Tse's rise to prominence as not only one of the leading female singers of Hong Kong music, but also as a socially conscious \\"grassroots diva.\\" Both \\"17 Degrees\\" and \\"Wedding Invitation Street\\" were released on the album Binary in July, to overwhelming critical and commercial success. The album was certified platinum, with sales exceeding thirty-thousand copies. Tse swept all the most prestigious year-end music awards in 2008, including the Media Grand Prize co-presented by Hong Kong's four major media outlets awarded to the performer garnering the most awards that year. In November, Tse was admitted to hospital for suffering Pneumothorax, which was reportedly the fourth time the condition had occurred. This had impacted her ability to sing with Tse being hospitalised for a week.Êù±ÊñπÊó•Â†±2008Âπ¥11Êúà09Êó• 00:28 Last accessed 4/07/2010 Yelling and Slowness, HKRIA controversy (2009) Tse during a performance on March, 2010. Following-up on the previous year's success, Tse released two albums, Yelling and Slowness in 2009. The former was released on 19 March, which spawned two hit singles \\"Zhu Ying Tai\\" (Á•ùËã±Âè∞) and \\"Song of the Year\\" (Âπ¥Â∫¶‰πãÊ≠å), further establishing her popularity. She announced her first stadium concert, Kay Tse Yelling Live 2009 in support of the album, which was held at the Hong Kong Coliseum in May. The concert later toured to Macau and Guangzhou in December, becoming her first concerts held outside of Hong Kong. In fall 2009, HMV Hong Kong announced that Yelling was the 9th biggest selling album of the year, which sold in excess of 15,000 copies, rivaling long established female acts such as Joey Yung and Miriam Yeung.http://group.mtime.com/LeslieCheung/discussion/803337/ Slowness, released late in the year on 21 December, also spawned a hit lead single, \\"Living\\" (Ê¥ªËëó), which topped three of the four major singles charts. It was around this time however that controversy began between TVB and the Hong Kong Recording Industry Alliance, which meant that Tse, under Cinepoly, would no longer appear on TVB or have her singles chart. For that same reason, Tse did not receive any year-end awards from TVB that year, which would remain the case until she switched labels in 2012. To promote Slowness, Tse began a mini- university tour which spanned from January to March, 2010.http://www.elle.com.hk/celebrity/news/Kay-Tse-Slowness-Mini-Live-at- Baptist-University Second Home and Mandarin market (2010) Promotion continued for Slowness for the first half of 2010, which saw three further singles that enjoyed moderate chart success. On 23 August 2010, Tse held a press conference to announce her contract renewal with Cinepoly, reportedly a seven-figure deal spanning 5 years. In the period between 2009‚Äì2010, Tse had faced some major setbacks in the Hong Kong market, not least including the HKRIA controversy which had caused her an important platform to promote herself, leading to a decline in popularity. She became frequently attacked in the media, especially by the publications Oriental Sunday and New Monday, which were owned by Emperor Entertainment Group. It is widely thought that this was a smear tactic by EEG who perceived Tse as a threat to their contracted artiste Joey Yung, an example being that in 2008, Tse had won six awards at the Commercial Radio's year-end award show to only two won by Yung. She admitted to Black Paper Magazine in 2011 that she had suffered depression during this time, though had recovered. Having faced such setbacks, Tse set her sights in the latter part of 2010 on the Mandarin market. On 23 August, she released her first Mandarin single, \\"Weak\\" (ËÑÜÂº±) followed by her debut Mandarin album, My Second Home (Á¨¨‰∫åÂÄãÂÆ∂) on 5 November 2010. The second single, \\"Goodbye\\" (ÂÜçË¶ã) was released to coincide with the album launch.  Your Happiness, label disputes (2011)  In May, Tse premiered the single \\"December 20th\\" (ÂçÅ‰∫åÊúà‰∫åÂçÅ). The single was described as \\"last moment on Earth [...] lyrically about the rich-poor and class divides in Hong Kong\\". The single garnered positive reception, with many calling the style more in line with her earlier releases. On 15 August, Tse debuted her follow-up single \\"Your Happiness\\" (‰Ω†ÂÄëÁöÑÂπ∏Á¶è), which became the title track of the album released on 13 October 2011. =2012‚Äì2013: Label changes= In 2012, Tse performed as a principal cast member in Loving the Silent Tears, a Broadway-style musical production at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, USA. The musical is based on a poetry collection, Silent Tears by Supreme Master Ching Hai, a Vietnamese-born spiritual leader and entrepreneur. Tse performs the song \\"Talking to a Stone Buddha,\\" singing in Mandarin and English. On 29 March 2013, Tse announced that she had signed to Gold Typhoon (Taiwan). She released the Mandarin single, \\"I Have A Dream\\" followed by the album, With Thanks ‚Äì Kay in September. She briefly signed with Herman Ho's record company, Stars Shine International before it closed, releasing the Cantonese single, \\"The Best of Time\\" (ÊúÄÂ•ΩÁöÑÊôÇÂàª). = 2014‚Äì2016: Independent period, 10th Anniversary, World Tour and second hiatus =  Kontinue  On 30 June 2014, Kay's company released her new single Egg and Lamb (ÈõûËõãËàáÁæîÁæä). The composer and writer Adrian Chow, claimed that he was inspired by the film 12 Years a Slave. The song soon became popular as the official MV collected about one million clicks on YouTube within two weeks of its release. However, it was alleged that the new song touched on sensitive political issues between Hong Kong and Mainland China. The song and the official MV on Chinese mainstream online music players and video websites were soon deleted respectively on the second day since its release. Also, the name of the song was blocked when searching on websites. On 29 September 2014, Kay released Kontinue, her first Cantonese album since 2011's Your Happiness. In 2015, Kay began her 10th Anniversary World Tour on 10 October. In 2016, she stated she would be on hiatus for a year. The hiatus was brought forward due to her announcement of pregnancy. Also, due to the negative mood and outlook due to political and social event in Hong Kong, the World Tour was cut short. = 2018‚Äìpresent: imagine.nation period = Tse's second child, Karina, was born in March 2017. In December 2017, Tse signed with Juno Mak's label, imagine.nation, effectively marking her comeback. Tse's first single in 2018 was the Cantonese version of the theme song to the Bollywood film Secret Superstar, released in Hong Kong on 12 April 2018.

India) was the son of Captain Syed Mohammed, commander of the Paigah army in Hyderabad State and brother of Olympic tennis player Syed Mohammed Hadi. He was born in Hyderabad on 16 October 1890 and got his primary and secondary education from Madrasa Aliya. After completing his matriculation he moved to Bombay and completed his intermediate from Wilson College. In 1912 when he was in the final year of his B.A., the Nizam's government approved his scholarship by the State government to study in England. From 1912 to 1916, he read history, political science, and economics at Peterhouse, Cambridge. Immediately after completing his M.A Cantab (Tripos) in Economics, he returned to Hyderabad. Working life In 1916, he joined government service as Reader of history & economics at Nizam College. In 1917, he was offered a job in the Education Department of Hyderabad State as Divisional Inspector of School by the Director of Education Sir Ross Masood. He served in the Education Department between 1918 and 1947 as Divisional Inspector of Schools, Deputy Director Education, Principal Nizam College and as Director Education. During his tenure, he also represented Hyderabad State in the Imperial Education Conference held London in 1927 and later visited Germany and published (1930s) the book The German School System. He retired as Director of Education in 1947. In 1948 soon after the fall of Hyderabad State, the new Governor of Hyderabad, Major-General J.N. Choudhary, nominated him on an Enquiry Committee of three members to investigate into the atrocities committed against Muslims during police action in various districts of the State. Syed Ali Akbar worked on this committee for seven months and submitted a comprehensive report to the Governor. He was appointed as principal of the first Evening College in India in 1949 which he served till 1953. He later took over as the Honorary Principal of the newly established Anwar-ul-ulum College mainly to cater to the education requirements of the poor Muslim students. Syed Ali Akbar served the college for over 15 years and was instrumental in raising it from a Junior Intermediate College with few dozen students to a degree college for both Arts and Science subjects with over 1,000 students. With the help of his friends and grants from the state of government, he was able to undertake construction of suitable building for housing the expanding requirements of the college. After retiring as Principal of Anwar-ul-ulum College, Syed Ali Akbar continued to remain active and busy in literary pursuits. He was the chief editor of the well-known English language quarterly Islamic Culture and President of Idara Adabiat Urdu which published monthly magazine Sub Rus for 20 years. He also served as chairman of Sugra Humayun Mirza Wafq & Safdaria Higher School committee until his death. He was a member of Osmania University Senate for several years. Know to be a man of principles and integrity, Syed Ali Akbar was respected and admired by his colleagues, friends, subordinates, and relations alike. He had a large circle of distinguished personalities as his friends - like Khwaja Nazimuddin Shahid Saharwardi, Syed Mohammed Azam, Saeed Jung, Sir Prakash were his colleagues & friends in Cambridge. He had also close friendship with Sir Ross Masood, Sir Salar Jung III, and Sir Mirza Ismail. Mir Osman Ali Khan the Nizam had also great regard and respect for him. Syed Ali Akbar's contribution in the establishment of a sound education system in Hyderabad State is still remembered and acknowledged. It was due to his pioneering and untiring efforts that the foundation of primary and secondary education was laid in Hyderabad. Because of his initiative and efforts vocational schools were established in the state both for boys and girls. As principal of Nizam College, Evening College and as first principal of Anwar-ul-ulum College, he made valuable contributions in improving the standard of education at the college level. He also helped in improving the standard of education at the university level as an active member of the Osmania University Senate. Publication Syed Ali Akbar was the author of the classic book The German School System originally published in the 1930s which has been republished (in November 2006) by Hesperides Press (). He has been referenced in the books Locating Home: India's Hyderabadis Abroad by Karen Isaksen Leonard, published by Stanford University Press (2007) and by E. M. Forster in his classic book A Passage To India published by Penguin Classics. 1890 births Alumni of Peterhouse, Cambridge Indian Muslims Indian academics Scholars from Hyderabad, India Year of death missing ","title":"Syed Ali Akbar"},{"id":"3826841","text":"ASC Pty Ltd, formerly the Australian Submarine Corporation, is an Australian government business enterprise involved with Australian naval shipbuilding, headquartered in Osborne, South Australia.

History The ASC construction facility on the Port River HMAS Hobart under construction by ASC at Osborne The Australian Submarine Corporation was formed when Kockums (designer of the ) became part of a joint venture with the Australian branch of Chicago Bridge & Iron, Wormald International, and the Australian Industry Development Corporation to construct the six vessels.Yule & Woolner, The Collins Class Submarine Story, pp. 76‚Äì80 The ASC construction facility was established on previously undeveloped land on the bank of the Port River, at Osborne, South Australia.Jones, in The Royal Australian Navy, p. 244 Work on the site began on 29 June 1987, and it was opened in November 1989.Yule & Woolner, The Collins Class Submarine Story, p. 127 South Australia had been selected as the site of the construction facility based on the proposed location of the facility and promises by the State Government to help minimise any problems caused by workers unions.Yule & Woolner, The Collins Class Submarine Story, pgs 87-8, 128 By the end of 1990, Chicago Bridge & Iron and Wormald International had both sold their shares in ASC.Yule & Woolner, The Collins Class Submarine Story, pp. 181‚Äì4 The shares were bought up by Kockums and the Australian Industry Development Corporation, with some of Kockums' shares then sold to James Hardie Industries to maintain an Australian majority ownership of the company. On 5 April 2000, the shares in ASC held by Kockums were bought out and the company was nationalised, despite a trend by the Howard Government towards privatisation of government-owned companies.Yule & Woolner, The Collins Class Submarine Story, p. 312 In 1991 the company had brought the insolvent Carrington Slipways in New South Wales to expand operations. The company‚Äôs name was changed from the Australian Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd to ASC Pty Ltd on 1 October 2004 in order to position it as a supplier of naval combat vessels in addition to being a specialist submarine supplier and maintainer.Historical details for ABN 64 008 605 034 Australian Business Register The name ASC was specifically selected to recognise the company‚Äôs ‚Äúheritage and achievements.‚Äù In October 2016, the Federal Government confirmed that ASC would be dissolved into three companies focused on different elements of current ASC works. One would be dedicated to the Air Warfare Destroyers, one to continued submarine sustainment and development and one to infrastructure development. Dissolution is expected to be complete by 2017.Federal government announces Adelaide based shipbuilder ASC to be split into three companies ABC News 11 October 2016 In December 2018, ASC Shipbuilding was structurally separated from ASC Pty Ltd, and transferred to BAE Systems Australia for the duration of the contract to build Hunter class frigates. Products ASC rose to prominence in 1987 when it was contracted by the Australian Government to design and manufacture a fleet of six s for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in what was the largest defence contract ever signed in Australia. Although the submarine project was marred with difficulties throughout the 1990s, upon completion the Collins class were hailed as the most advanced diesel-electric submarines in the world. The difficulties continued, however, and the very expensive Collins class submarines have been plagued with troubles and controversy ever since. ASC maintains the six Collins class submarines for their operational lifespans under a A$3.5 billion contract with RAN.Yule & Woolner, The Collins Class Submarine Story, p. 315 To date, no other navy has expressed interest in buying a Collins class submarine. In 2005, the company was selected by the Australian Government, ahead of two other bidders, as the preferred shipbuilder for three new AEGIS-based Australian air warfare destroyers (AWD) under the Sea 4000 Project. The AWDs are scheduled to begin service in 2013. ASC also has contracts for production of Keka-class coastal patrol boats, produced in Hong Kong for use of Hong Kong maritime police, and the Series T.81 produced in Thailand for the use of the Royal Thai Navy.

Biography In the early 1980s together with Milƒço Manƒçevski he formed Bastion, one of the first electronic bands in the then Socialist Republic of Macedonia within SFR Yugoslavia. Subsequently, he went on to play with one of the most famous Macedonian bands Leb i sol, recording two albums and touring extensively around the Balkans and the rest of Europe. In the 1990s, Kiril moved to Australia and began experimenting with music, combining ethnic Macedonian music and electronic beats. This led to his first solo release, Synthetic Theatre, an EP received extremely well by Australian independent radio stations. In 2000, American label Tone Casualties released his album Homebound, which continued the concept of blending Macedonian ethnic instrumentation and electronica. It received excellent reviews from critics around the world, including individuals from the United States, Canada, UK, Spain and Japan. Croatian Playboy Magazine voted it the best album of the year from the former Yugoslavia. After returning to the Republic of Macedonia, he composed the film score for Milƒço Manƒçevski's Dust, as well as for the films Bal-Can-Can and The Great Water. He performed concerts around Macedonia and abroad, including performances at the international Exit Festival. He was also involved in composing additional music for the 2007 Milƒço Manƒçevski film Shadows.

Goertz (March 12, 1915 - June 4, 1970) was an American mechanical engineer and an early pioneer in the field of robotics, specifically remote- controlled robots (see telepresence). In 1949, while working for the Atomic Energy Commission at Argonne National Laboratory, Goertz filed a patent for an early master-slave manipulator () in order to handle radioactive material. Goertz recognized the value of electrically coupling manipulators and laid the foundations of modern tele-robotics and bilateral force-reflecting positional servos. Goertz also performed early research on the degrees of freedom necessary for smooth motion by remote manipulation and developed one of the first head-mounted displays as a prototype for virtual reality. Nautical terms such as pitch, yaw, and roll were incorporated into the lexicon of robotics by Goertz. Today, the purpose of teleoperation has expanded beyond the scope of nuclear safety and now includes uses such as reaching remote environments in space or in surgical operations, among other uses. (Print; or In 1985 the American Nuclear Society established the 'Ray Goertz Award' to recognize and honor members who have made outstanding contributions to the field of remote technology.  Education and Early Life  Raymond C. Goertz was born in Clearwater, Kansas on March 12, 1915. He was the son of Norma E. and Flora (Saint) Goertz and had a sister, Mrs. Thelma Main and two brothers, Lynn Goertz and Lee Noble. Goertz received his Bachelor of Science degree from Montana State College in 1940, graduating with honors. He then began his graduate studies at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1942, staying there until 1946. In 1947 Goertz moved to Illinois and completed his graduate studies at the Illinois Institute of Technology from 1947 to 1949.  Career and Research  Raymond Goertz worked for the Sperry Gyroscope Company at the Servomechanisms Laboratory as a project engineer from 1940 to 1947 while also working on his graduate studies at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. In 1947 Goertz moved to Illinois to begin work at Argonne National Laboratory as a mechanical engineer, meanwhile completing his graduate studies at the Illinois Institute of Technology through 1949. Goertz later became a senior engineer at Argonne National Laboratory in the remote control engineering division. At the first and second International Conferences on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 and 1958 Goertz represented the United States as a delegate. During his career Goertz was a member of the American Nuclear Society, the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Goertz's primary work and accomplishments revolved around the development and improvement of master-slave manipulator devices, but Goertz also devoted time to completing basic research on the degrees of freedom necessary for smooth motion by remote manipulation. He also created an initial prototype of a virtual reality device by developing one of the first head-mounted displays. For his work Goertz also codified terms so that university and industrial developers could replicate and contribute to his field, and he incorporated nautical terms into the lexicon of robotics, including pitch, yaw, and roll. The company of Central Research Labs in Red-Wing, Minnesota was created by Goertz's efforts and technological developments, and the company made more than 8,000 master-slave manipulators for entities in 26 different countries. Goertz was replaced in 1953 as head of Central Research Labs by Demetrius Jelatis. Today, the purpose of teleoperation has expanded beyond the scope of just safety and now includes uses such as reaching remote environments in space or deep underwater and working with manipulating extremely large or small objects for surgical operations or manufacturing, among many other uses. = Master Slave Manipulator Device Designed by Raymond Goertz = The goal of a master-slave manipulator is the protection of workers from radiation while enabling precise manipulation of materials. The machine can be thought of as two distinct devices, the \\"slave\\" and \\"master\\" arms. The \\"slave\\" arm is responsive to the controlling device, the \\"master\\" arm, with the benefit that through remote handling manual tasks can be performed without the need of direct human intervention. In nuclear settings the slave arm is located within a hot-cell and the master arm is located in a control room. Whenever the master arm is manipulated, the motion is reproduced precisely by the slave arm. While at Argonne National Laboratory Goertz developed the master-slave manipulator in order to safely handle hazardous material from the 100-B plutonium reactor at Hanford. The initial master-slave manipulator device was designed by Goertz in 1948 as a seven-degree-of-freedom bilateral (symmetrical) metal tape transmission pantograph device, which was operated through a leaded glass wall. In 1949 Goertz filed a patent for a mechanical, bilateral master-slave manipulator, and in 1951 Goertz improved upon this design with the first tel-operated articulated arm with a design that relied on mechanical coupling between the master and slave arms through the utilization of steel pulleys and cables. This was a major milestone in force feedback technology and derivatives of this design are still seen today. Goertz gradually became aware of the necessity of haptic senses for manipulating delicate objects and used force-feedback systems to improve the deftness of the human-machine combination. Through incorporating the principles of cybernetics Goertz was able to also construct the first electrical master-slave manipulator system, and by 1954 a modified version of the master-slave manipulator (Model 8) began commercial production. In order to create accurate master-slave manipulator devices, it was necessary for Goertz to develop several principles, all of which are applicable to our own contemporary robotic surgical systems. The principles are as follows. The motion of the slave arm must possess six independent degrees of freedom, three of translation and three of rotation to position gripping devices, and a tong squeeze motion to grip items. The motion of the slave arm must be coupled to the master arms that the position and the direction of the two arms correspond to. The coupling of the two arms must be bilateral and this means that forces at the slave end must be reflected at the master end and displacements produced at the slave end must be able to produce a displacement at the master end, with the slave arm being able to align itself in response to the constraints imposed by the task being done. = Awards = Goertz was the recipient of the Edward Longstreth medal at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1967. He also received the Radiation Industry award from the American Nuclear Society in 1969. In 1985 the American Nuclear Society established the \\"Ray Goertz Award\\" to recognize and honor its members who have made outstanding contributions to the field of remote technology.  Personal life  Raymond Goertz married Helen Boula on September 2, 1950 in Cook, Illinois. Together they had three children: Alan, Jean, and Linda. Goertz passed away on June 4, 1970 at the age of 55 in Downers Grove, Illinois.

It is implied that the position is hit and held from motion as if freezing in motion, or into ice. Freezes often incorporate various twists and distortions of the body into stylish and often difficult positions. Spins are often combined with freezes, and the spins are usually done in the form of kicks.

Less intuitively named freezes include: *Planche - A freeze with your body straddled parallel over the ground, while arms are straight, you use your strength to hold your body weight. *Baby Freeze - The hands are used for balance, with the nearest side of your waist on one elbow and a knee on the other, sometimes swapping leg placement. Airbaby - A freeze with the knee resting on the elbow of the supporting arm. *Chair Freeze - A freeze while you're lying down arched to the floor with the arm stabbed into the back to support the body. Airchair - A chair freeze without the head or feet on the floor, usually facing the ceiling, with leeway for many leg variations. Elbow Airchair - A chair freeze, performed with hand at the back and that elbow pointed at the ground. Hands and feet are removed from the floor to complete the freeze. *Double Airchair/Recliners - An Airchair freeze, having both arms in a stabbed position at the back. Only Contortionists and other extremely flexible individuals could be able to perform this move. It is very dangerous, and is not performed often. *Handglide Freeze - Similar to the Turtle freeze, except only one elbow is stabbed into the abs, the other is out to the side of the body and is either placed on the ground or held above it. *Hollowback - A more difficult freeze. It is basically a bridge with feet not touching the floor. There are many variations performed from a handstand, headstand, or on the elbows. * Invert - an inverted hollowback freeze. instead of making a bridge you crunch in your face to your legs so it makes a v shapes as in to \\"invert\\" the hollowback. *O Freeze- a hollowback with an extreme arch the feet touch the bboy's elbows, this resembles an 'O' shape. *Pike - A freeze with one hand planted on the ground while the entire body is perpendicular to the floor with both feet held high to the air. *Turtle Freeze - Both arms are bent in front of the chest with the elbows stabbing into either the abs or surrounding area. All the weight is placed onto the hands and the rest of the body is suspended above the ground. See float. *Birthday Elbow- a freeze on the elbow wherein the bboy's head rests on his hand, the body is horizontal, facing the ground. *Flag-standing on one hand while facing the side and punched the other hand forward *L-kick-standing on one hand while crotch and bend one leg while holding the end of a straight leg with the other hand *V-kick-balancing two hands and kicking feet V-shaped on *Y-freeze- standing on one hand and balance while opening leg shape 'Y'. *Shoulder freeze-balance the body using the shoulder while making free style legs.

This includes facilities such as a dedicated 5-storey block for each company, air-conditioned smart lecture rooms, elevators, air-conditioned gymnasiums, and a shooting range simulator. Co-located in the training ground are various training sheds of various sizes customised to fit platoons or entire companies. There are also rifle, grenade and Battle Inoculation Course ranges. In addition, there are sports facilities and supporting amenities such as a medical centre, canteens, auditoriums, an SAF e-Mart outlet, the Infantry Heritage Centre and Total Defence Museum. All buildings in the Ladang complex are connected by sheltered walkways, and are linked to the ferry terminal for transportation to the main island. It is also easily accessible to pre- existing training facilities in the rest of the island, with the Tekong Highway just north of the training complex which connects to Rocky Hill Camp. Located near to the ferry terminal is a statue known as the National Service Landmark, depicting a life-sized infantry soldier with the Singapore Armed Forces Flag, which was unveiled by Dr Tony Tan on the same day of the training centre's official opening. =Pulau Tekong - Rocky Hill Camp= Rocky Hill Camp has its own Medical Centre (Rocky Hill Medical Centre), swimming pool, cookhouse and running track. SISPEC was situated in Rocky Hill Camp from 1999/2000 to 2006 and housed 3 companies namely Zulu Coy, Yankee Coy and Quebec Coy. = Kranji Camp II= Today, BMTC School V's centralised training structure allows the SAF to strengthen its first touch point with recruits and their families. Recruits undergo a common nine-week BMT, comprising a four- week basic soldiering phase.

Career From Mill Hill School he entered Jesus College, Cambridge in 1921 to obtain a degree in Agriculture. In 1925 he began to work in the Department of Agriculture on insect pests. He continued on this line during two years at the University of California as a Rockefeller Fellow. Awarded the PhD from Cambridge in 1929, he then moved to the Imperial Institute of Entomology, returning to Cambridge three years later as a lecturer in Entomology and Fellow of Jesus College. A religious conscientious objector, during World War II he studied insects that preyed on stored food. In 1943 he published an extensive review on insect learning, following it with a similar work on birds in 1951. He closely followed the burgeoning ethological research of Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen, introducing their work to English readers. In 1951-52 he was the Prather Lecturer at Harvard University, and in 1956 published his book Learning and instinct in animals. In 1950 he became the first director of the Cambridge Ornithological Field Station; he was appointed Reader in Zoology in 1959 and awarded a personal chair in 1966. =Bird song= When the sound spectrograph was launched he saw that recording sound frequencies and intensities over time made it possible to quantitatively analyze bird song. He obtained the first of these devices in the UK, fathering a group of talented investigators of song. He also led a rigorously controlled study of imprinting learning. =Other= He was a member of the advisory committee to the Anti-Concorde Project and as a vocal conservationist led in saving Wicken Fen from draining and development.

Partially based on the BMW Isetta two- seater, it was BMW's first postwar four-seater economy car. It was not a sales success, but it began the design process for its more successful successor, the BMW 700. Concept, design, and engineering Right 3/4 view, with front door open and side door in view BMW needed to expand its model range, but they did not have the resources to develop an all-new car with an all-new engine. Therefore, it used the Isetta as starting point for a new four seat economy car. BMW 600 interior As a result, the 600 used the front suspension and front door of the Isetta. The need to carry four people required a longer frame, a different rear suspension, and a larger engine. A new perimeter frame was designed, using box section side members and straight tube crossmembers. The rear suspension was an independent semi trailing arm design; this was the first time BMW had used this system. The chassis had a wheelbase of , a front track of , and a rear track of . The 600 was powered by the flat-twin engine from the R67 motorcycle/sidecar combination. This engine, which delivered at 4,500 revolutions per minute, was mounted behind the rear wheels. A four-speed manual gearbox was standard, while a Saxomat semi-automatic transmission was available. The 600 had a top speed of approximately 100 km/h. Access to the rear seats was by a conventional door on the right side of the vehicle. Reception The Isetta image hurt the sales of this larger, more upscale car. The sales figures for the 600 did not meet BMW's expectations. During production from August 1957 to 1959, about 35,000 were built. This is attributed to competition with more conventional cars, including the Volkswagen Beetle. Legacy Rear view of the 600 The 600 played a direct role in the design of its successor, the BMW 700. Wolfgang Denzel, the distributor of BMW cars in Austria, commissioned Giovanni Michelotti to prepare concept sketches based on a lengthened BMW 600 chassis. Denzel presented the concept, a 2-door coupe with a slanted roof, to BMW's management. The concept was generally well received, but objections were raised about the limited passenger space. BMW decided to produce two versions, the coupe, and a 2-door sedan with a taller, longer roof. Another legacy of the 600 was its independent semi-trailing arm rear suspension. This was BMW's first use of this suspension system and, with the exception of the BMW M1, it was used on every BMW production automobile until the 1990s. It was eventually supplanted by the \\"Z-axle\\" multi-link suspension introduced with the BMW Z1 in 1988. The last BMW cars with semi-trailing arm suspension were the BMW Compact and the BMW Z3. =Space efficiency= The BMW 600 was noted in magazine and journal articles as an example of space efficient design. It was noted for carrying four people within a shorter length than that of the Mini.

Women's football began to be organised in the early 20th century, but for several decades occurred mostly in the form of scratch matches and one-off exhibition games. State-based leagues emerged in the 1980s, with the Victorian Women's Football League (VWFL) forming in Melbourne in 1981 and the West Australian Women's Football League (WAWFL) forming in Perth in 1988. The AFL Women's National Championships were inaugurated in 1992. Women's football became professionalised in the 2010s, with a national league, AFL Women's, commencing its inaugural season in 2017 with teams formed by existing Australian Football League (AFL) clubs. History Nellie Stewart and other women playing in a charity football match, 1894, East Melbourne Cricket Ground Codified in 1859, Australian football had been played by men for almost half a century before the first women's football matches were played. Contact sports such as football were widely considered unsuitable for women at the time, and public attitudes prevented them from participating in organised matches. Exceptions included charity matches, such as patriotic fundraisers, which occasionally featured women players. Women have nonetheless followed the Australian game passionately since the mid-19th century, comprising approximately 50% of spectators at matches‚Äîa uniquely high figure among football codes. Both world wars were a great liberator for women; as the men fought in the war, women were often called to perform many tasks typically done by men, including spectator sports. Records exist of a football side in Perth, Western Australia made up of department store staff playing as Foy & Gibson's as early as 1917. Matches played in Western Australia were also recorded in 1918. In South Australia, an early example of Women's football was a Port Adelaide Women's team in 1918 where a game took place at Alberton Oval between Port Adelaide and another club representing Thebarton. Port Adelaide was captained by Eileen Rend. Following World War I, an exhibition match in Melbourne was held to show that women could play what had previously been seen to be a man's sport. The first women's match attracted a large crowd and interest. The umpire wore a dress.AFL Record. Round 19 (Women's Round), 2007. Pg 8 In 1929 a Women's Australian rules football match played at Adelaide Oval attracted a record 41,000 spectators. In 1929, as part of an annual charity day, a 30 minute match was played on Adelaide Oval between workers of the Charles Moore & Co. factory and the Mirror Shirt and Pyjama Factory. Although the match was not a standalone event newspapers at the time did refer to it as the main attraction of the day. A moth biplane dropped the game ball to start the match.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/11063164 Archives also show a charity women's match occurred on Bassendean Oval in Perth, Western Australia, 27 August 1944. It is unknown whether the game had been played continuously in the state. Beyond this and occasional matches over the years, women's football was rarely organised, until the formation of the Victorian Women's Football League in 1981 with four teams competing at open level. Women's Australian rules football began to rapidly grow in 2000, with the number of registered teams increasing by a phenomenal 450%. In women's Australian rules football in 2015, 163 new teams were formed and a total of 284,501 players took part in organised games. The first full international was held between the USA Freedom and Team Canada in Vancouver on Saturday 4 August 2007 in front of a crowd of almost 2,500. Rule modifications Some women's competitions, but not all, are played with modified rules. The main rule differences between the women's and men's versions of Australian football involves modified tackling rules. Typically aggressive slinging (swinging a player by the jumper or throwing the player to the ground) of oppositions players in a tackle is not allowed. Like the men's game, head high contact is strictly not allowed. Another main difference is the size of the ball. A smaller ball to the men's version is often used to minimise hand injuries when (marking) the ball. Games of International rules football are also played by many women's leagues against Gaelic Athletic Association clubs. Recreational football, a fully non-contact version of Australian rules football, is also becoming popular amongst women in Australia and the United States. Many women's leagues also fall into the emerging 9-a-side footy or Metro footy formats. Competitions =National league= A national competition backed by the AFL began in 2017. Bids for a licence to participate were submitted by 13 existing AFL teams, with eight teams awarded licences to participate in the inaugural season. The competition had been announced in 2008 and was slated to commence in 2013 with four to eight teams, but this was later postponed after it was found that the new teams from the and would not have time to submit their bids in full. A licence was granted to Fremantle under the umbrella of the Women's Football League in February 2010, but due to a review and the subsequent admission of the Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney to the AFL, this licence was recalled. With the foundation of the AFLW in 2017, this licence was reissued to the club. =National championships= Women's Football Australia are responsible for the annual AFL National Women's Championships which began in 1992. In 2005, two teams from Victoria, a senior and an under-19s side and teams from the ACT, Northern Territory, New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia, the Australian Defence Force and Queensland participated. =International competition= A match between Ireland and the US in the women's division of the 2011 Australian Football International Cup There was a women's division at the 2008 Australian Football International Cup with Australia, US, Canada and Papua New Guinea competing. There is also International Rules Football with a women's Australia women's international rules football team competing against the Ireland women's international rules football team. The 2006 tour helped to lift the profile of the sport slightly in Australia. The first ever full international was held between the US \\"Freedom\\" and Team Canada in Vancouver on Saturday 4 August 2007. The US Freedom toured Australia in August 2009 playing teams in Sydney, Cairns, Bendigo, and Melbourne over an 8-day period. Papua New Guinea's national team, the \\"Kurakums\\" competes in the AFL Women's National Championships. Participation figures During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, women's Australian rules football saw a large expansion in the number of competitors. In 1998, Auskick, a national program began. The program was designed to introduce the game to primary school aged children. By 2006, it had over 140,000 participants each year. Though the program was never specifically aimed at girls, the safe non-contact environment proved popular and in 2007 about 16% (12%) in of all Auskick participants were female. In Australia, a total of 18,609 girls and women played Australian rules football in 2005 and in 2006 48,054 women played the sport in Australia, and it is one of the fastest growing sports among women in Australia. By 2017, a record number of 463,364 females were playing Australian rules football across the nation, making up 30% of all participants. The number of female Australian Rules Football teams reached 1,690 nationally, a huge 76% increase on the previous year By region =Australia= There are women's Australian rules football teams in all states and territories of Australia. Victoria Players in the Victorian Women's Football League, 2008, left to right: Phoebe McWilliams, Rachel Achampong and Avril Chow Organised women's Australian rules football has been played in Victoria since 1981 with the formation of the Victorian Women's Football League (VWFL), the oldest and largest Australian rules football league for women in the world. Women's football in Victoria has a comparatively high profile in the media. The work done by League president Debbie Lee and Media Manager Leesa Catto as well as involvement by celebrities such as Tiffany Cherry have helped to boost exposure for the sport. The VWFL Grand Final is now played in front of a crowd exceeding 1,500 people. The annual Vic Country vs Vic Metro match has been now played as a curtain raiser to a home and away Australian Football League match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. VWFL players have participated in charity matches against senior male players in both the AFL Legends Game (which is broadcast on television in multiple states and live in Victoria) and Community Cup. The VWFL is an open age Women's Footy competition which began in 1981 with four teams. In the following decades it has grown substantially and now features 3 division structure and as well as many clubs fielding teams in the reserve grades for the first and second division. In 2004 the League affiliated with Football Victoria. In 2005 there were 24 teams (from 20 clubs) in total, with over 800 women taking part. A U17 Youth Girls Competition was established by Football Victoria in 2004. This was following legal action taken against them in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (following a complaint to the Equal Opportunity Commission) by Penny Cula- Reid, Emily Stayner, and Helen Taylor. The three schoolgirls were banned from playing in junior leagues, with fears of expensive insurance liability in case of injury and \\"medical reasons\\" being cited by Football Victoria (i.e. the physical differences between the bodies of boys and girls). The court found in favour of the girls in February 2004. In response to the ruling, the U17 Youth Girls Competition began in May, with 122 girls participating. Victoria fields both senior and under 19 in the AFL Women's National championships and have been the dominant state, with the two teams combined having won every one of the 15 national titles. Western Australia Organised Women's Australian rules football has been played in Western Australia since 1988, with the first premiership being won by Mount Lawley.

Women's footy is played by the Tokyo Geckos, the Irish Galahs (Gaelic football) and Osaka Bilbies. Europe The first ever women's footy match in the UK was organised by Aussie Rules UK and was held in London on 21 April 2007 as part of the ANZAC Sports Challenge. Since then, women's Australian rules football teams have been formed across Europe, with women's teams representing England, Ireland, Scotland, France, Sweden, Croatia, and a combined Wales/Denmark team competing at the 2017 Australian Rules Football European championship, known as the Euro Cup.http://www.afleurope.org/euro- cup-2017-fixtures/ There is a women's league in London, founded in 2015, which currently consists of teams from 7 clubs across two divisions.http://afllondon.com/?page_id=439 There are also University-based women's Australian rules football teams across Europe, such as at the Universities of Cork, Birmingham, Oxford, and Cambridge. The University of Oxford founded a women's team in 2015, with the University of Cambridge following in 2017. After more than 100 years since the first recorded men's Oxford versus Cambridge Australian rules football varsity match (as reported in the Kalgoorlie Miner newspaper in 1911) the first women's Australian rules varsity match was played in Oxford in March 2018 and resulted in a draw. LGBTI issues In September 2017 the AFL ruled that transgender woman, Hannah Mouncey, was ineligible for selection in the 2018 AFLW draft.

It was the first model in the SZ series. The Silver Spur is a long-wheelbase version of the Silver Spirit, produced from 1980 to 2000. It was the first car to feature a retractable Spirit of Ecstasy. The spring-loaded mascot sank into the radiator shell if dislodged from its position. Mark I The Silver Spirit was introduced by Rolls-Royce in 1980 as the first of a new generation of company models. It formed the basis for the Flying Spur, Silver Dawn, Touring Limousine, Park Ward, and Bentley Mulsanne/Eight series.The Spirit/Spur carried over the basic design of the Silver Shadow, its 6.75 L L410 V8 engine and GM-sourced THM400 3-speed automatic gearbox, and similarly styled unitary bodywork manufactured at Pressed Steel. The Spur/Spirit continued the Silver Shadow's emphasis on ride quality by utilising its hydropneumatic self- levelling suspension, modified with Girling automatic hydraulic ride height control system and gas-charged shock absorbers File:Rolls Royce Silver Spirit MK1 Dash.jpg1986 Silver Spirit Mk1 RHD dash File:1986 Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit.jpg1986 Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit.

Suspension design saw the most change, with \\"Automatic Ride Control\\" introduced, a fully automatic system that adjusted dampers at all four wheels in real time. Other updates included the adoption of ABS and fuel injection as standard for all models and markets. The last Mark I Silver Spirit/Spur was chassis no KCH27798, with Mark II cars starting with 29001. The fuel injection system was now Bosch's MK-Motronic. Originally retaining the three-speed Turbo Hydramatic GM400 transmission from earlier Spirits/Spurs, a four-speed unit (the GM 4L80E) was introduced in the winter of 1991. The size of the petrol tank was also increased, up to the car's range was now up to well over . Exterior and interior changes were minimal, with a considerably smaller steering wheel and two additional ventilation outlets added to the fascia mildly modernising the look up front. Mark III The Silver Spirit III and Silver Spur III were introduced in 1993, featuring engine improvements and some cosmetic updates. A new design of intake manifold and cylinder heads increased power output. The parameters of the semi-active suspension system were modified so that shock absorbers would default into \\"soft\\" ride mode when they wore out (rather than \\"hard\\" in the previous Mark II, noticeably impacting ride quality). Dual airbags were introduced inside, along with independent adjustment of the rear seats. =Flying Spur= The 1994‚Äì1995 Flying Spur was a turbocharged, higher performance version of the Silver Spur III. 134 cars were produced. =Silver Dawn= The Silver Dawn is a special edition of the Silver Spur III with several additional options, such as Electronic Traction Assistance System and rear seat heaters. The radiator height is reduced by and the size of the Spirit of Ecstasy was reduced by 20 percent. The new front was later inherited by the Mark IV series. Silver Dawn appeared one year earlier on the American market. Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn (US) Mark IV Designed in the autumn of 1992, the New Silver Spirit/New Silver Spur was the final revision of the Silver Spirit and Silver Spur, introduced late in 1995 as a 1996-year model. A marketing decision had been made that the cars should not get a \\"series IV\\" designation because the number four is a homonym for death in some Far Eastern languages. 1996 Rolls-Royce Silver Spur ‚Äò96 Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn front Major changes included the introduction of a Garrett turbocharger on all models and the replacement of the previous Bosch engine management systems with one by Zytec. Also new were updated integrated front and rear bumpers and sixteen-inch wheels. As of 1997, the long wheelbase became standard, with limousine models offered in extra-long only. Inside, a wooden column running down the centre of the dashboard was added. Silver Spirit production closed with the model year 1997, although vehicles continued to be produced through 2000 to use up Silver Spirit bodies and parts remaining in stock. =Park Ward Limousine= The Rolls-Royce Park Ward Limousine is a limited edition Silver Spur/Spirit mark IV with a extended wheelbase and a taller roof. The Park Ward replaced the Silver Spur/Spirit Touring Limousine. In the middle of model year 1998 the name was changed to Rolls-Royce Silver Spur Park Ward. The model nomenclature on the badge on the boot compartment lid says Park Ward. Standard equipment on this model included a bar cabinet with crystal decanters and goblets, intercom, an electrically operated division and a backseat sunroof.

Touring limousines Rolls-Royce touring limousines were built to a Robert Jankel designRolls-Royce Touring Limousine http://www.rrab.com in cooperation with coach builder Mulliner Park Ward, London. The first Silver Spur Limousine was produced in 1982. 16 cars had the extended wheelbases, 84 cars with extended wheelbases were produced in 1984 and later. One car had wheelbase extension. These cars were extended at the B-pillar, between the front and rear doors. From 1991 on, 99 units of the Touring Limousine with wheelbase extension were produced. The car was lengthened at the C-pillar with an opera window added. Like these earlier models, most of the cars had fold-down occasional seats in the rear passenger area. The Park Ward Limousine was the last one to be officially extended (, again at the C-pillar) with 70-unit production commencing in 1996 and concluding in 1999.

He became widely known around 1960 as the interviewer of Adolf Eichmann.  Biography  Willem Sassen was born in Geertruidenberg, Netherlands. He grew up in a traditional Roman Catholic family in North Brabant and attended a gymnasium in Neerbosch near Nijmegen and in Breda. His father was impressed by the fascist ideas of the Zwart Front (literally 'Black Front'). Sassen decided not to become a priest but to study law in Leuven and Ghent instead. As a student, Sassen became a member of the German-Flemish workers' group DeVlag. When Sassen visited the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, his admiration for Hitler and Nazi Germany grew. Because of Sassen's pro-Nazi political activities, the authorities expelled him from Belgium, so he could not finish his law studies. In 1938 Sassen became a recruit in the Dutch army and was trained as an artillerist. When Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, Sassen was a member of the 7th Field Artillery regiment and was taken prisoner by the Germans for a short time. Sassen married Paula Fisette in 1940, divorced, and later married Miep van der Voort, with whom he had two daughters. Their eldest daughter is Saskia Sassen (born 1947 in The Hague), the internationally known American sociologist and professor of economics. Sassen's third wife was Els Delbaere, the daughter of a Flemish artist who, because of his own Nazi past, had also fled to Argentina.  Nazi and SS career up to 1945  On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa), and Sassen volunteered for the German Eastern front. He became a member of the first Netherlands PK (\\"Propaganda Kompanie\\"). Because he had been working for Radio Bremen for some time already, he could start his work as a war correspondent after a short cut training. He was a \\"Wort-und Funkberichter\\" with the SS- division \\"Wiking\\" in the southern sector of the front and in the spring of 1942 witnessed the offensive in the Caucasus. On 26 July 1942, Sassen was wounded near Rostov and during the following eight months recovered in hospitals in Krak√≥w, Munich and Berlin. In April 1943 he was promoted to SS- Unterscharf√ºhrer (the lowest rank of non-commissioned officer, comparable to a US Corporal) and assigned to an SS armoured division near Kharkov. In the summer of 1943, he followed another training course on war correspondence and propaganda together with Dutch colleagues in Villach, Austria. From August 1943 to June 1944, together with his Flemish colleague Jef Desseyn, Sassen formed the permanent editor team of Radio Brussels (Zender Brussel). The team was also responsible for training courses for war correspondents. On 6 June 1944 (D-Day), Kriegsberichter Sassen was at the front in Normandy reporting the battles around Caen, Bayeux, Saint-L√¥, Avranches, Falaise and Lisieux. On 1 September 1944, Zender Brussel was ordered to be evacuated to Germany. Sassen remained in the Netherlands, reported the airborne landings around Arnhem and became the editor of the newspaper Het Nieuws van den Dag in Amsterdam. On 23 October 1944, Sassen in his newspaper called upon the hungry and cold of Amsterdam to go robbing food and fuel in the districts of the more rich and wealthy people; this was too much even for the Germans, and on pressure of the Sicherheitsdienst police, Sassen was dismissed. Willem Sassen was sent to Doetinchem where he was active in the black propaganda Aktifpropaganda, Skorpion West. There he published Het Laatste Nieuws. At the beginning of 1945 Sassen was asked to participate in a Werewolf organisation in case the allied forces overran the German army in the Netherlands. He became the leader of Neurop (Neu Europa). The group was to pass on military intelligence on allied troop movements and to commit sabotage. The German army capitulated sooner than was expected, and Willem Sassen fled together with his younger brother Alfons to Alkmaar. Former members of the Dutch resistance offered them a refuge; Willem Sassen had aided certain members of the Dutch resistance during the war, including Anthony Mertens, an old prewar friend.  Escape to and second career in Argentina  On 5 June 1945, Sassen was arrested in Alkmaar by British Field Security and interned in Fort Blauwkapel near Utrecht. On 15 December he fled with two other inmates. He first went to his girlfriend Miep van der Voort (Utrecht) and later to his friend Anthony Mertens. For two years Sassen went into hiding in Antwerp, Brussels and Amsterdam. With the help of his friends, among whom were Mertens and former SS member Karl Breyer, Sassen managed to obtain a passport. In May 1947 he flew in a KLM plane to Dublin, Ireland. There he met up with some of his old comrades, before setting off to Argentina. Together with his girlfriend Miep van der Voort, their daughter Saskia Haremaker (The Hague 1947), and some former SS men and collaborators, he departed in the coastal vessel The Eagle under the command of former U-boot captain Schneider to Buenos Aires. On 3 November they arrived at the docks of Darsena Norte in Buenos Aires. Three days later they were allowed to disembark. The Sassen family lived first in Ciudad Jard√≠n Lomas del Palomar (Greater Buenos Aires), where their second daughter was born. Willem Sassen started to work as a journalist, translator and as a ghost writer for Hans Ulrich Rudel and later Adolf Eichmann. Around 1960, Willem Sassen was recruited by Georg Mertins . He was asked to represent Merex AG, which was a cover for the illegal arms trade controlled by the German secret service Bundesnachrichtendienst . Other representatives in Latin America were Klaus Barbie (Bolivia) , Friedrich Schwend (Peru) , his brother, Alfons Sassen (Ecuador) and, in Madrid, Spain, Otto Skorzeny . In the 1970s, Sassen among others worked as a PR-consultant for Chile's dictator Pinochet and Paraguay's dictator general Alfredo Stroessner.  The Eichmann interviews  In 1957, Sassen interviewed Adolf Eichmann about his involvement in the Nazis' Final Solution. Parts of the interviews were published in two articles in Life magazine. It is assumed that the transcripts of the interviews are much more realistic and personal than the autobiography Eichmann wrote while in prison in Israel, possibly attempting to place himself in a better light and alter the outcome of the trial. In 1980 the Sassen documents or Sassen tapes, consisting of approximately 600 pages of material from the interviews, were transferred to Eichmann's widow, Veronika. Sassen was interviewed in an edition of the British World in Action (Granada/ITV, 1978) about his connections in Argentina with Josef Mengele; the Auschwitz concentration camp physician was still alive and on the run at the time. The Sassen \\"Interviews\\" are documented in detail in Eichmann Before Jerusalem by Bettina Stangneth, Vintage Press, 2015. Sassen sold some of the material to Life Magazine.

Constructed in between 1907 and 1909 in the Neo-classical style Palladian style and is faced with Sylacauga marble. It had once been considered for demolition for not being large enough to accommodate the growing county. A much larger, modern masonry and glass structure behind it (left side of photo), now serves its judicial functions. The courthouse underwent a $US 6 million renovation between 1989 and 1996. Historic district Attached to the courthouse is the First Reformed Dutch Church and Cemetery, built in 1898, which has served as the county's Jury Assembly Room since it was renovated around 1985. The courthouse, church, and grounds comprise the Somerset Courthouse Green, which added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 7, 1989. History The Court House in Somerville, NJ When Somerset County was chartered in 1688 most, if not all, judicial affairs were subject to the jurisdiction of the Middlesex County. This all changed in 1714 because the growing community was in need of its own court. The Colonial Assembly passed an act allowing for the building of a court house in Somerset County. County Freeholders chose Six Mile Run (in Franklin Township), as the site to build the new courthouse and jail. In 1737, the jail and courthouse caught fire and burned to the ground. Everything was destroyed. The Freeholders then decided, due to the fire and due to the inaccessibility of the courthouse, to move its location to present-day Millstone. This courthouse served the county until about 1779. This is when invading British forces burned down the courthouse and again most of the records were lost. A committee was appointed by the county in 1782 to build a new courthouse. The Committee met with members of the Dutch Reformed Church (the Consistory of the Church of Raritan) and voted to join together and build a courthouse. This association between the court and the church lasted until 1788 when the Dutch Reformed Church relinquished its previous agreements for use of the courthouse, located in Somerville.

Boardman, Ltd. (Boardman Books) was a London publishing houses that turned out both paperback and hardcover books, pulp magazines, and comic books. Founded by Thomas Volney Boardman in the 1930s, Boardman Books is best known for publishing the long-running monthly series of hardcover Bloodhound Mysteries, most with jacket illustrations by Denis McLoughlin. Boardman's Best American Detective Stories of the Year series is thought by some scholars of the genre to be the best collection of hard-boiled fiction ever published. Boardman published the first British hardcover edition of Robert E. Howard's The Coming of Conan as well as other titles originated by Gnome Press in the United States. Besides mystery, fantasy, and science fiction, Boardman Books published other genres of fiction and nonfiction.  History  Boardman pioneered British reprinting of American comics. During the week of 16 October 1937, the first issue of a Boardman tabloid comic in the traditional British format, Okay Comics Weekly, arrived at newsagent's all over England. The content was mostly American newspaper strips and the first issue sported a cover strip by Will Eisner. Okay lasted only until 26 February 1938, or a total of twenty issues. At about this same time, other British publishers experimented with reprinting American comics and imports of the real thing began to land on British shores. It rapidly became apparent that a significant British market for American comic books existed. However, the British declaration of war on Germany on 3 September 1939, immediately halted the official importation of American comics into the United Kingdom although masses of American comics intended for G.I.s began arriving in 1942. Already with a taste for American comics, Thomas Volney Boardman, Sr., made an arrangement with Everett M. \\"Busy\\" Arnold of Quality Comics to produce British editions of two titles, Feature Comics (#29‚Äì33) and Smash Comics (#7‚Äì11), all appearing in 1940‚Äì1941. Because Boardman needed low-priced titles to please his primary outlet, Woolworths Group's Department Stores, the British editions reprinted only about half the content of the American originals. To use the rest of the pages, Boardman created two additional corresponding titles in the American style, Super Funnies (#29‚Äì33) and Mystery Comics (#7‚Äì11). After World War II, Boardman continued comic book production with a series of monthly comics produced by rotogravure and priced at a modest 3 pence. In the late-1940s, they introduced a number of children's annuals under their Popular Press line, intended primarily for the Christmas market and sold almost exclusively through the Woolworth's department store chain. These annuals contained a mixture of text and comic strip stories. Some were original British creations while others were reprinted from Quality Comics. In the late 1950s, increased competition with now legal American comic book imports caused Boardman to drop their comics annual line. The last, Buffalo Bill True West Annual saw print in 1961. The firm ceased operations entirely in 1967, although the Bloodhound Mystery line continued for several years from other publishers.

It includes a renderer as well as many other tools for measuring the simulated light levels. It uses ray tracing to perform all lighting calculations, accelerated by the use of an octree data structure. It pioneered the concept of high dynamic range imaging, where light levels are (theoretically) open-ended values instead of a decimal proportion of a maximum (e.g. 0.0 to 1.0) or integer fraction of a maximum (0 to 255 / 255). It also implements global illumination using the Monte Carlo method to sample light falling on a point. Greg Ward started developing Radiance in 1985 while at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The source code was distributed under a license forbidding further redistribution. In January 2002 Radiance 3.4 was relicensed under a less restrictive license. One study found Radiance to be the most generally useful software package for architectural lighting simulation. The study also noted that Radiance often serves as the underlying simulation engine for many other packages.Geoffrey G. Roy, A Comparative Study of Lighting Simulation Packages Suitable for use in Architectural Design, Murdoch University, October 2000 HDR image format Radiance defined an image format for storing HDR images, now described as RGBE image format. Since it was the first (and for a long time the only) HDR image format, this format is supported by many other software packages. The file starts with the signature '#?RADIANCE' and then several lines listing the commands used to generate the image. This information allows the renderer rpict to continue a partially completed render (either manually, or using the rad front-end). There are also key=value declarations, including the line 'FORMAT=32-bit_rle_rgbe'. After this is a blank line signifying the end of the header. A single line describes the resolution and pixel order. As produced by the Radiance tools this always takes the form of '-Y height +X width'. After this line follows the binary pixel data. Radiance calculates light values as floating point triplets, one each for red, green and blue. But storing a full double precision float for each channel (8 bytes √ó 3 = 24 bytes) is a burden even for modern systems. Two stages are used to compress the image data. The first scales the three floating point values to share a common 8-bit exponent, taken from the brightest of the three. Each value is then truncated to an 8-bit mantissa (fractional part). The result is four bytes, 32 bits, for each pixel. This results in a 6:1 compression, at the expense of reduced colour fidelity. The second stage performs run length encoding on the 32-bit pixel values. This has a limited impact on the size of most rendered images, but it is fast and simple. Scene description format A radiance scene is made from one or more object files. The .rad format is a simple text file. It can specify individual geometric objects, as well as call programs by starting a line with an exclamation point '!'. When specifying geometry the first line is modifier type name The following three lines contain parameters starting with an integer specifying the number of parameters. The parameters need not be on the same line, they can be continued on multiple lines to aid in readability. Modifiers create materials and can be chained together, one modifying the next. For example: myball.rad chrome sphere ball 0 0 4 0 0 10 10 This can then be arrayed in another file using the xform program (described later): scene.rad void metal chrome 0 0 5 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.9 0.0 !xform -a 5 -t 20 0 0 myball.rad This creates a chrome material and five chrome spheres spaced 20 units apart along the X-axis. Before a scene can be used, it must be compiled into an octree file ('.oct') using the oconv tool. Most of the rendering tools (see below) use an octree file as input. Tools The Radiance suite includes over 50 tools. They were designed for use on Unix and Unix-like systems. Many of the tools act as filters, taking input on standard input and sending the processed result to standard output. These can be used on the Unix command line and piped to a new file, or included in Radiance scene files ('.rad') themselves, as shown above. =Geometry manipulation= Several radiance programs manipulate Radiance scene data by reading from either a specified file or their standard input, and writing to standard output. * xform allows an arbitrary number of transformations to be performed on a '.rad' file. The transformations include translation, rotation (around any of the three axes), and scaling. It also can perform multi-dimensional arraying. * replmarks replaces certain triangles in a scene with objects from another file. Used for simplifying a scene when modelling in a 3D modeller. =Generators= Generators simplify the task of modelling a scene, they create certain types of geometry from supplied parameters. * genbox creates a box. * genrprism extrudes a given 2D polygon along the Z-axis. * genrev creates a surface of revolution from a given function. * genworm creates a worm given four functions - the (x, y, z) coordinates of the path, and the radius of the worm. * gensurf creates a tesselated surface from a given function. * gensky creates a description for a CIE standard sky distribution. =Geometry converters= Radiance includes a number of programs for converting scene geometry from other formats. These include: * nff2rad converts NFF objects to Radiance geometry. * obj2rad convert Wavefront .obj files to Radiance geometry. * obj2mesh convert Wavefront .obj files to a Radiance compiled mesh. This can then be included in a scene using the recently added mesh primitive. More efficient than using obj2rad and includes texture coordinates. =Rendering= * rpict is the renderer, producing a Radiance image on its standard output. * rvu is an interactive renderer, opening an X11 window to show the render in progress, and allowing the view to be altered. * rtrace is a tool for tracing specific rays into a scene. It reads the parameters for these rays on its standard input and returns the light value on standard output. rtrace is used by other tools, and can even be used to render images on its own by using the vwray program to generate view rays to be piped to it. * dayfact is an interactive script to compute luminance values and daylight factors on a grid. * findglare takes an image or scene and finds bright sources that would cause discomforting glare in human eyes. * mkillum takes a surface (e.g. a window or lamp shade) and computes the lighting contribution going through it. This data is then used by the illum material modifier to make lighting from these secondary sources more accurate and efficient to compute. =Image manipulation and analysis= * pfilt filters an image. The common technique to achieve anti-aliased images is to render several times larger than the desired size, and then filter the image down using pfilt. * pcompos composites images, either with anchor coordinates or by adding several images on top of another. * pcond conditions images. Can simulate a number of effects of the human visual response e.g. defocusing dark areas, veiling due to glare, and colour loss due to mesopic or scotopic vision in low light. * pinterp interpolates between two images provided they both have z buffers. Uses rtrace to fill in gaps. Is used to speed up the rendering speed of simple animations. * ximage is an image viewer for viewing HDR Radiance images. It can adjust the simulated exposure and apply some of the human visual effects of pcond. =Integration= * rad is a front-end which reads a '.rif' file describing a scene and multiple camera views. Previously, make and a makefile were used in a similar role. rad coordinates oconv, mkillum, rpict/rview and other programs to render an image (or preview) from the source scene file(s). * trad is a GUI front-end to rad using Tcl/Tk. * ranimate is a front-end which coordinates many programs to generate virtual walk-through animations i.e. the camera moves but the scene is static.

St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Biography The son of a goldsmith, Luigi (1726‚Äì1785), Valadier was born in Rome in 1762. He also occasionally provided designs for silver, such as the \\"York Chalice\\" for Henry Cardinal York (1800‚Äì01), the grand silver table service for Monsignor Antonio Odescalchi (1795‚Äì97) and the similar Rospigliosi-Pallavicini service, begun in 1803 which he partly produced in the silver workshop he directly oversaw and partly sub-contracted to other Roman silversmiths. Valadier also designed some furniture and other decorative arts, such as the rock crystal and silver reliquary for relics of the Holy Crib in Santa Maria Maggiore, for Pope Pius IX. Valadier worked in Rome and elsewhere in the Papal States, but many of his projects remained on paper. He was named official architetto camerale of the Papal States by Pope Pius VI in 1786. He taught architecture at the Accademia di San Luca was a pioneer archeologist and a restorer of monuments, such as the Milvian Bridge (1805) and the Arch of Titus in Rome, (1819‚Äì21).

The word is derived from the Greek term , which is composed of , \\"mystery\\", and , \\"I carry\\". This feast was also called Hersiphoria, from Herse, the daughter of Cecrops, on whose account it was established. On the Athenian Acropolis two girls aged between seven and eleven were elected to live for a year at a time as arrhephoroi, tending the sacred olive tree and weaving, with the help of other women, the new robe for Athena. Proud parents commemorated their daughters' service by making dedications on the Acropolis. At the annual festival of the Arrhephoria the girls (according to Pausanias) placed on their heads what the priestess of Athena gives them to carry. Neither the priestess knows what it is she is giving them, nor do the girls. In the city there is a sacred precinct not far from that of Aphrodite in the Garden and through it runs a natural underground passage. Here the virgins descend. Down below they leave behind what they have brought and take something else and carry it, veiled as it is. These two virgins are discharged forthwith and others are taken up to the Acropolis in their place.Cantarella, Eva. Pandora's Daughters: The Role & Status of Women in Greek & Roman Antiquity. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. 1989. Interpretation of the festival is difficult because of the lack of sources, but it is clear that the virginal arrhephoroi are chosen from the noblest families of the city and are deployed in a context of impregnation (dew), sexual power (Aphrodite and Eros), and birth (Erichthonios). The word \\"arrhephoros\\" etymologically probably means \\"dew carrier\\", which at first sight does not help. The arrhephoroi were charged with weaving the peplos (garments) for Athena. The aletrides ground the grain for Athena. The arkios were the priestesses who celebrated a rite intended to forgive an offense against Artemis. The kanephorai were the girls who carried the baskets with all of the offerings to the festival. Archaeological evidence reveals that from near the Erechtheion a secret stairway led off the Acropolis past a small rock-cut shrine of Eros and Aphrodite, near which was the precinct to which they were going. The mythical associations of the arrhephoroi are with their starting-point the Erechtheion. Kekrops, the first king of Athens, whose tomb was in the complex, had three daughters, Aglauros, Herse, and Pandrosos. The mystery revolves around innocence, obedience, and fecundity. They were given a closed basket by Athena who forbade them to open it. One night Aglauros and Herse gave in to curiosity, opened the basket, and saw Ericthonios, the mysterious child of Hephaestus. Snakes also appeared out of the basket, and in terror the two girls jumped off the Acropolis to their deaths. The sanctuary of Aglauros lies at the foot of the cliff; it may have been the precinct to which the arrhephoroi descended. Pandrosos, who did not succumb to this fatal curiosity, has a shrine next to the sacred olive tree on the Acropolis itself. In the fifth century B.C. Aristophanes wrote Lysistrata which explained the stages of the women during this festival: > \\"When I was just seven, I was arrephoros, then at ten, I was aletris for the > archegetis, then I carried the orange robe as arkios (bear) at Brauronia, > and finally, having become a beautiful girl, I was kanephoros, with a > necklace of dried figs.\\" These stages have certain tasks which display the ancient system that all girls must go by when reaching puberty. The stages of this \\"initiation\\" are as follows. The arrhephoroi comes first, and is a time when the girl dresses in white and begins to weave for the offering to Athena. This is an art that was frequently performed by women during the time, and therefore must be taught at a young age. The second stage is to teach the girl how to bake, specifically, how to bake bread. The third step is considered a symbol of death and resurrection. The girl must attend and participate in the festival with the older women. These stages are all tasks that the girl will use for the rest of her life, and therefore are held with high importance and expectation. It is believed through sources that Attica was one of the first in history to have one of these festivals. Modern followers of Hellenism (religion) celebrate it 3 Skirophorion, in accordance with the Attic calendar. References * Price, Simon. Religions of the Ancient Greeks.

As the name suggests, block walking problems involve counting the number of ways an individual can walk from one corner A of a city block to another corner B of another city block given restrictions on the number of blocks the person may walk, the directions the person may travel, the distance from A to B, et cetera. An example block walking problem Suppose such an individual, say \\"Fred\\", must walk exactly k blocks to get to a point B that is exactly k blocks from A. It is convenient to regard Fred's starting point A as the origin, (0,0), of a rectangular array of lattice points and B as some lattice point (e,n), e units \\"East\\" and n units \\"North\\" of A, where e+n=k and both e and n are nonnegative. =Solution by brute force= A \\"brute force\\" solution to this problem may be obtained by systematically counting the number of ways Fred can reach each point X=(x_1,x_2) where :0 \\\\le x_1 \\\\le e and 0 \\\\le x_{2} \\\\le n without backtracking (i.e. only traveling North or East from one point to another) until a pattern is observed. For example, the number of ways Fred could go from (0,0) to (1,0) or (0,1) is exactly one; to (1,1) is two; to (2,0) or (0,2) is one; to (1,2) or (2,1) is three; and so on. Actually, you could receive the number of ways to get to a particular point by adding up the number of ways you can get to the point south of it and the number of ways you can get to the point west of it.(With the starting point being zero and all the points directly north and south of it one.) In general, one soon discovers that the number of paths from A to any such X corresponds to an entry of Pascal's Triangle. =Combinatorial solution= Since the problem involves counting a finite, discrete number of paths between lattice points, it is reasonable to assume a combinatorial solution exists to the problem. Towards this end, we note that for Fred to still be on a path that will take him from A to B over k blocks, at any point X he must either travel along one of the unit vectors <1,0> and <0,1>. For the sake of clarity, let E=\\\\langle 1,0 \\\\rangle and N=\\\\langle 0,1\\\\rangle. Given the coordinates of B, regardless of the path Fred travels he must walk along the vectors E and N exactly e and n times, respectively. As such, the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct rearrangements of the word : \\\\overbrace{ EE \\\\cdots E }^{e\\\\text{ times}}\\\\underbrace{ NN \\\\cdots N }_{n \\\\text{ times}}, which is equivalent to finding the number of ways to choose e indistinct objects from a group of k. Thus the total number of paths Fred could take from A to B traveling only k blocks is :\\\\binom{k}{e}=\\\\binom{k}{n}=\\\\frac{k!}{e! n!}. Other problems with known block walking combinatorial proofs * Proving that :: \\\\sum_{k=0}^n { n \\\\choose k}^2\\\\ = { 2n \\\\choose n} : can be done with a straightforward application of block walking.Lehoczky, Sandor and Richard Rusczyk.

Finnish White Guards had started their military campaign in March 1918. The goal was to annex White Karelia from Bolshevist Russia. British Royal Marines had invaded Murmansk at the same time to prevent the Germans and their Finnish White Guard allies from gaining the White Sea coast and the Murmansk Railroad. Murmansk Legion was armed with British equipment and wore British uniforms. The Legion was led by Oskari Tokoi and Verner Lehtim√§ki who were both promoted as Colonel by the British Navy.

Oxford and the Netherlands Thomas first moved to Oxford in 1569 to start his degree. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Exeter College, Oxford after just a year in 1570, being described as a \\"prodigy\\" as his acquisition of knowledge was profound. He was elected a chaplain-fellow of Balliol College, Oxford 3 years later in 1573 and gaining his Master's degree in 1575. He became a Bachelor of Divinity in 1582 then a Doctor of Divinity in 1584. From 1585 to 1587 he left Oxford to serve as personal chaplain to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, who was appointed governor of the Netherlands. Dudley, who was an ardent Protestant, utilized Holland in maintaining religious rigor among the troops during the two-year campaign which ended without great success and few battle engagements. For his service to Dudley, Holland was graciously rewarded by Queen Elizabeth I. Returning to Oxford, Thomas was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity in 1589 and a canon of Salisbury Cathedral in 1590. He became rector of St. Nicholas Church, Rotherfield Greys, Oxfordshire in 1591 and from 1592 he served as Rector of Exeter College.

Bible Translating In June 1604, 54 of England's most prominent linguists and scholars were commissioned into 6 groups to translate the Bible into English. Thomas took a very prominent part in the translation of the Bible, as a member of the \\"First Oxford Company\\", responsible for the translation of the books of the Old Testament prophets from Isaiah to Malachi, in the project to create an Authorized Version of the Bible (King James Version) for reading in the churches. After it was published 2 May 1611, Thomas died 10 ¬Ω months later aged 63. He had stoutly resisted the \\"popish innovations\\" which Richard Bancroft and William Laud strove too successfully to introduce at Oxford. Thomas is interred in the chancel of St Mary's church, Oxford. One of his portraits is in the Hope collection in the Bodleian Library, and a fine engraving in Henry Holland's Herœâologia Anglica. Another of his portraits, which is in the National Portrait Gallery, London, reads, \\"Hollandus docuit divini dogmata verbi et pugil adversos stravit feliciter hostes,\\" which translates roughly as \\"Holland taught the teachings of God's Word and fought against enemies, successfully throwing them down.\\" alt=Holland taught the teachings of God's Word and fought against enemies, successfully throwing them down. The Bewitching of Anne Gunter It was during his time translating that Thomas was involved in a case of witchcraft in North Moreton brought by his sister in law, Anne Gunter, and her father, Brian Gunter, against local women who it was said had cursed Anne Gunter. The case went to the Star Chamber and Thomas was called as an expert witness. He refused to believe that Anne was possessed by the devil and that she could it was claimed read with her eyes closed. It was eventually discovered to be the invention of Anne's father who had a vendetta against a local family. Works Thomas' works include: * 'Oratio habita cum Henricus Episc.

Millard, California Lt. Governor. Spencer Gurdon Millard (July 10, 1856 - October 24, 1895) was an American Republican politician, lawyer and school teacher. He was elected as the 20th Lieutenant Governor of California, his term to run from 1895 to 1899, but died in office within the first year. He was born in Ionia, Michigan, the son of Gurdon J. Millard (c. 1830-?) and Joanna Freeman (c. 1834-?). His sister was Frances M. Millard (c. 1854-c. 1891), who died in India, where she went as a missionary. Millard attended Hillsdale College, where he studied for several years, graduating from the institution in 1877. He then obtained a teaching position at the grade school in Carson City, Michigan, and served in the capacity as principal for about three years. In about 1880, he began the study of law with William O. Webster, an attorney at Ionia, and after studying for about two years he was admitted to the bar. He then became a member of the firm of Webster & Millard, in which he was engaged in the practice of law until he removed to Los Angeles, California, in 1887. On June 17, 1885, Millard and Ida N. Hall (1860‚Äì1952) were married in Ionia. They had two children, Spencer J. Millard (1888-before 1952), who was born in Ionia, Michigan, and died in Tennessee, and Gertrude Millard (1891‚Äì1979), who was born and died in Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, Millard practiced law alone. Soon after his arrival, he built a house in the Angeleno Heights tract. One of his first public appearances in politics was at the Republican City Convention in the fall of 1892, when John Q. Tufts was nominated for Mayor. Millard's bearing as a Presiding Officer was seen as dignified, his decisions being usually prompt and accurate and his voice excellent, as it could be readily heard. He presided so acceptably that he was called to wield the gavel at the Republican County Convention in May 1894, when delegates were chosen to the State Convention, which a short time later nominated him for Lieutenant Governor. During the campaign following his nomination, Millard spoke for 60 consecutive nights, except Sundays, and traveled throughout the state. At the close of the campaign, when the news arrived that he was elected, he was heard to remark that he felt very well, and, barring a slight hoarseness, that appeared to be his condition. He had, it was said, not had a physician for 20 years, and his robust physical condition seemed to have withstood the strain of the campaign without any perceptible injury. Shortly before the time of assembling the Legislature, in January 1895, Millard was ill with an attack of influenza, which developed into pneumonia. He was ill at home for about two months and then went to Indio, in hope of recovering his health. Afterward, he returned to Los Angeles, and during the latter part of June went East to the home of his father, who then lived in the northern part of Michigan. In the first week of September, he returned to California accompanied by his cousin, Jay B. Millard (1854‚Äì1936), principal of the Spring-Street School. He remained in Northern California, spending most of the time at Shasta Springs near Dunsmuir, until the afternoon of Sunday, October 20, when he left Dunsmuir for Southern California.Los Angeles Times, Oct. 25, 1895, \\"A Busy Career - The Lieutenant-General in Law and in Politics,\\" p. 1 During the time of his illness and death, William T.

While epistemology has a long philosophical tradition dating back to Ancient Greece, epistemic logic is a much more recent development with applications in many fields, including philosophy, theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, economics and linguistics. While philosophers since Aristotle have discussed modal logic, and Medieval philosophers such as Avicenna, Ockham, and Duns Scotus developed many of their observations, it was C. I. Lewis who created the first symbolic and systematic approach to the topic, in 1912. It continued to mature as a field, reaching its modern form in 1963 with the work of Kripke. Historical development Many papers were written in the 1950s that spoke of a logic of knowledge in passing, but it was Finnish philosopher von Wright's paper An Essay in Modal Logic from 1951 that is seen as a founding document. It was not until 1962 that another Finn, Hintikka, would write Knowledge and Belief, the first book-length work to suggest using modalities to capture the semantics of knowledge rather than the alethic statements typically discussed in modal logic. This work laid much of the groundwork for the subject, but a great deal of research has taken place since that time. For example, epistemic logic has been combined recently with some ideas from dynamic logic to create dynamic epistemic logic, which can be used to specify and reason about information change and exchange of information in multi-agent systems. The seminal works in this field are by Plaza, Van Benthem, and Baltag, Moss, and Solecki. Standard possible worlds model Most attempts at modeling knowledge have been based on the possible worlds model. In order to do this, we must divide the set of possible worlds between those that are compatible with an agent's knowledge, and those that are not. This generally conforms with common usage. If I know that it is either Friday or Saturday, then I know for sure that it is not Thursday. There is no possible world compatible with my knowledge where it is Thursday, since in all these worlds it is either Friday or Saturday. While we will primarily be discussing the logic-based approach to accomplishing this task, it is worthwhile to mention here the other primary method in use, the event-based approach. In this particular usage, events are sets of possible worlds, and knowledge is an operator on events. Though the strategies are closely related, there are two important distinctions to be made between them: * The underlying mathematical model of the logic-based approach are Kripke semantics, while the event-based approach employs the related Aumann structures. * In the event-based approach logical formulas are done away with completely, while the logic-based approach uses the system of modal logic. Typically, the logic-based approach has been used in fields such as philosophy, logic and AI, while the event-based approach is more often used in fields such as game theory and mathematical economics. In the logic-based approach, a syntax and semantics have been built using the language of modal logic, which we will now describe. =Syntax= The basic modal operator of epistemic logic, usually written K, can be read as \\"it is known that,\\" \\"it is epistemically necessary that,\\" or \\"it is inconsistent with what is known that not.\\" If there is more than one agent whose knowledge is to be represented, subscripts can be attached to the operator (\\\\mathit{K}_1, \\\\mathit{K}_2, etc.) to indicate which agent one is talking about. So \\\\mathit{K}_a\\\\varphi can be read as \\"Agent a knows that \\\\varphi.\\" Thus, epistemic logic can be an example of multimodal logic applied for knowledge representation.p. 257 in: : 257 The dual of K, which would be in the same relationship to K as \\\\Diamond is to \\\\Box, has no specific symbol, but can be represented by eg K_a eg \\\\varphi, which can be read as \\"a does not know that not \\\\varphi\\" or \\"It is consistent with a's knowledge that \\\\varphi is possible\\". The statement \\"a does not know whether or not \\\\varphi\\" can be expressed as eg K_a\\\\varphi \\\\land eg K_a eg\\\\varphi. In order to accommodate notions of common knowledge and distributed knowledge, three other modal operators can be added to the language. These are \\\\mathit{E}_\\\\mathit{G}, which reads \\"every agent in group G knows;\\" \\\\mathit{C}_\\\\mathit{G}, which reads \\"it is common knowledge to every agent in G;\\" and \\\\mathit{D}_\\\\mathit{G}, which reads \\"it is distributed knowledge to every agent in G.\\" If \\\\varphi is a formula of our language, then so are \\\\mathit{E}_G \\\\varphi, \\\\mathit{C}_G \\\\varphi, and \\\\mathit{D}_G \\\\varphi. Just as the subscript after \\\\mathit{K} can be omitted when there is only one agent, the subscript after the modal operators \\\\mathit{E}, \\\\mathit{C}, and \\\\mathit{D} can be omitted when the group is the set of all agents. =Semantics= As we mentioned above, the logic-based approach is built upon the possible worlds model, the semantics of which are often given definite form in Kripke structures, also known as Kripke models. A Kripke structure M for n agents over \\\\Phi is a (n+2)-tuple (S, \\\\pi, \\\\mathcal{K}_1, ..., \\\\mathcal{K}_n), where S is a nonempty set of states or possible worlds, \\\\pi is an interpretation, which associates with each state in S a truth assignment to the primitive propositions in \\\\Phi, and \\\\mathcal{K}_1, ..., \\\\mathcal{K}_n are binary relations on S for n numbers of agents. It is important here not to confuse K_i, our modal operator, and \\\\mathcal{K}_i, our accessibility relation. The truth assignment tells us whether or not a proposition p is true or false in a certain state. So \\\\pi (s)(p) tells us whether p is true in state s in model \\\\mathcal{M}. Truth depends not only on the structure, but on the current world as well. Just because something is true in one world does not mean it is true in another. To state that a formula \\\\varphi is true at a certain world, one writes (M,s) \\\\models \\\\varphi, normally read as \\"\\\\varphi is true at (M,s),\\" or \\"(M,s) satisfies \\\\varphi\\". It is useful to think of our binary relation \\\\mathcal{K}_i as a possibility relation, because it is meant to capture what worlds or states agent i considers to be possible. In idealized accounts of knowledge (e.g., describing the epistemic status of perfect reasoners with infinite memory capacity), it makes sense for \\\\mathcal{K}_i to be an equivalence relation, since this is the strongest form and is the most appropriate for the greatest number of applications. An equivalence relation is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. The accessibility relation does not have to have these qualities; there are certainly other choices possible, such as those used when modeling belief rather than knowledge. The properties of knowledge Assuming that \\\\mathcal{K}_i is an equivalence relation, and that the agents are perfect reasoners, a few properties of knowledge can be derived. The properties listed here are often known as the \\"S5 Properties,\\" for reasons described in the Axiom Systems section below. =The distribution axiom= This axiom is traditionally known as K. In epistemic terms, it states that if an agent knows \\\\varphi and knows that \\\\varphi \\\\implies \\\\psi, then the agent must also know \\\\,\\\\psi. So, : (K_i\\\\varphi \\\\land K_i(\\\\varphi \\\\implies \\\\psi)) \\\\implies K_i\\\\psi This axiom is valid on any frame in relational semantics. =The knowledge generalization rule= Another property we can derive is that if \\\\phi is valid, then K_i\\\\phi. This does not mean that if \\\\phi is true, then agent i knows \\\\phi. What it means is that if \\\\phi is true in every world that an agent considers to be a possible world, then the agent must know \\\\phi at every possible world. This principle is traditionally called N. : \\\\text{if }\\\\models \\\\varphi\\\\text{ then }M \\\\models K_i \\\\varphi.\\\\, This rule always preserves truth in relational semantics. =The knowledge or truth axiom= This axiom is also known as T. It says that if an agent knows facts, the facts must be true. This has often been taken as the major distinguishing feature between knowledge and belief. We can believe a statement to be true when it is false, but it would be impossible to know a false statement. : K_i \\\\varphi \\\\implies \\\\varphi This axiom is valid on any reflexive frame. =The positive introspection axiom= This property and the next state that an agent has introspection about its own knowledge, and are traditionally known as 4 and 5, respectively. The Positive Introspection Axiom, also known as the KK Axiom, says specifically that agents know that they know what they know. This axiom may seem less obvious than the ones listed previously, and Timothy Williamson has argued against its inclusion forcefully in his book, Knowledge and Its Limits. : K_i \\\\varphi \\\\implies K_i K_i \\\\varphi This axiom is valid on any transitive frame. =The negative introspection axiom= The Negative Introspection Axiom says that agents know that they do not know what they do not know. : eg K_i \\\\varphi \\\\implies K_i eg K_i \\\\varphi This axiom is valid on any Euclidean frame. =Axiom systems= Different modal logics can be derived from taking different subsets of these axioms, and these logics are normally named after the important axioms being employed. However, this is not always the case. KT45, the modal logic that results from the combining of K, T, 4, 5, and the Knowledge Generalization Rule, is primarily known as S5. This is why the properties of knowledge described above are often called the S5 Properties. Epistemic logic also deals with belief, not just knowledge. The basic modal operator is usually written B instead of K. In this case, though, the knowledge axiom no longer seems right‚Äîagents only sometimes believe the truth‚Äîso it is usually replaced with the Consistency Axiom, traditionally called D: : eg B_i \\\\bot which states that the agent does not believe a contradiction, or that which is false. When D replaces T in S5, the resulting system is known as KD45. This results in different properties for \\\\mathcal{K}_i as well. For example, in a system where an agent \\"believes\\" something to be true, but it is not actually true, the accessibility relation would be non-reflexive. The logic of belief is called doxastic logic. Problems with the possible world model and modal model of knowledge If we take the possible worlds approach to knowledge, it follows that our epistemic agent a knows all the logical consequences of their beliefs. If Q is a logical consequence of P, then there is no possible world where P is true but Q is not. So if a knows that P, it follows that all of the logical consequences of P are true of all of the possible worlds compatible with a 's beliefs. Therefore, a knows Q. It is not epistemically possible for a that not-Q given his knowledge that P. This consideration was a part of what led Robert Stalnaker to develop two dimensionalism, which can arguably explain how we might not know all the logical consequences of our beliefs even if there are no worlds where the propositions we know come out true but their consequences false.Stalnaker, Robert. \\"Propositions.\\" Issues in the Philosophy of Language. Yale UP, 1976. p. 101. Even when we ignore possible world semantics and stick to axiomatic systems, this peculiar feature holds. With K and N (the Distribution Rule and the Knowledge Generalization Rule, respectively), which are axioms that are minimally true of all normal modal logics, we can prove that we know all the logical consequences of our beliefs. If Q is a logical consequence of P, then we can derive \\\\mathcal{K}_a (P \\\\rightarrow Q) with N and the conditional proof and then \\\\mathcal{K}_a P \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{K}_a Q with K. When we translate this into epistemic terms, this says that if Q is a logical consequence of P, then a knows that it is, and if a knows P, a knows Q. That is to say, a knows all the logical consequences of every proposition. This is necessarily true of all classical modal logics. But then, for example, if a knows that prime numbers are divisible only by themselves and the number one, then a knows that 8683317618811886495518194401279999999 is prime (since this number is only divisible by itself and the number one). That is to say, under the modal interpretation of knowledge, when a knows the definition of a prime number, a knows that this number is prime. It should be clear at this point that a is not human. This shows that epistemic modal logic is an idealized account of knowledge, and explains objective, rather than subjective knowledge (if anything).See Ted Sider's Logic for Philosophy.

Tsakopoulos attended California State University, Sacramento. Tsakopoulos was a minority owner of the Sacramento Mountain Lions franchise of the short lived United Football League along his son, Angelo Tsakopoulos, Jr., who presently serves as president of AKT Development. In 2002, Tsakopoulos purchased a 70,000 volume collection on Hellenistic civilization and donated it to the library of California State University, Sacramento where it is available for use by the community . Early life and career Tsakopoulos was born in Rizes, a small village in Arcadia, Greece. He arrived in United States with his family in 1951, eventually settling in Sacramento, California after having lived in New York City and the Chicago, Illinois area. His older brother, George, who would arrive in the U.S. in 1955 after having been wounded in the Greek Civil War, would later also become a major investor with his brother in Sacramento real estate. Tsakopoulos founded Sacramento's AKT Development Inc. in 1964, which was when the company made its first real estate sale. George Tsakopoulos died at the age of 81 in Sacramento, California. His daughter, Eleni Kounalakis, served as president of AKT Development. She served as United States Ambassador to Hungary from 2010‚Äì2013 and is the Lieutenant Governor of California. His other daughter, Chrysa Tsakopoulos, married George Demos, a former United States Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor and Congressional candidate. His son, Kyriakos Tsakopoulos, is the current president and CEO of AKT Development and a former alumni trustee of Columbia University. Tsakopoulos was fined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for a violation of the Clean Water Act. Tsakopoulos sued the government and was able to bring his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, though the Court found against him. From the Association of State Wetland Managers: :\\"The case grew out of Tsakopoulos' preparations to subdivide part of the 8,350 acre (3,379 hectare) Borden Ranch into apple orchards and vineyards. He used a method of soil preparation called deep plowing or deep ripping to loosen the clay subsurface of nearly 1,000 acres (4,000 hectares) so that the roots of deep- growing trees and vines could penetrate. During the course of that work, about 2 acres (0.8 hectares) of wetlands also were plowed, although to lesser depths.\\" :\\"But Tsakopoulos argued that normal farming practices, including deep plowing, were excluded specifically from the Clean Water Act.\\" :\\"The government said that was true only if the plowing did not change the character of the farmland.\\" Justice Anthony Kennedy had to recuse himself from the case because of his acquaintance with Tsakopoulos and only eight justices were left deciding the case. The ruling turned out to be a 4‚Äì4 tie. Because of the tie, the ruling against Tsakopoulos by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was automatically affirmed.

It is classified as a restricted true endowment fund for governments and non-profit organizations. Put simply, a permanent fund may be used to generate and disburse money to those entitled to receive payments by qualification or agreement, as in the case of Alaska citizens or residents that satisfy the rules for payment from their permanent fund from State oil revenues. It was first introduced through GASB Statement 34. The name of the fund comes from the purpose of the fund: a sum of equity used to permanently generate payments to maintain some financial obligation. Also, a fund can only be classified as a permanent fund if the money is used to report the status of a restricted financial resource. The resource is restricted in the sense that only earnings from the resource are used and not the principal. For example, a fund can be classified as a permanent fund if it is being used to pay for accounting services for a perpetual endowment of a government-run cemetery or financial endowments towards a government-run library. A common misconception is that permanent funds are required for special-purpose government entities that solely engage in business-type activities. However, this is not the case. According to Statement 34, that special-purpose government entity needs only to report the net balance of the restricted resources.

Software pipelining is a type of out-of-order execution, except that the reordering is done by a compiler (or in the case of hand written assembly code, by the programmer) instead of the processor. Some computer architectures have explicit support for software pipelining, notably Intel's IA-64 architecture. It is important to distinguish software pipelining, which is a target code technique for overlapping loop iterations, from modulo scheduling, the currently most effective known compiler technique for generating software pipelined loops. Software pipelining has been known to assembly language programmers of machines with instruction-level parallelism since such architectures existed. Effective compiler generation of such code dates to the invention of modulo scheduling by Rau and Glaeser.B.R. Rau and C.D. Glaeser, \\"Some scheduling techniques and an easily schedulable horizontal architecture for high performance scientific computing\\", In Proceedings of the Fourteenth Annual Workshop on Microprogramming (MICRO-14), December 1981, pages 183-198 Lam showed that special hardware is unnecessary for effective modulo scheduling. Her technique, modulo variable expansion is widely used in practice.M. Lam, \\"Software pipelining: An effective scheduling technique for VLIW machines\\", In Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN 88 Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 88), July 1988 pages 318-328.

Gao et al. formulated optimal software pipelining in integer linear programming, culminating in validation of advanced heuristics in an evaluation paper.J. Ruttenberg, G.R. Gao, A.

Example Consider the following loop: for i = 1 to bignumber A(i) B(i) C(i) end In this example, let \`A(i)\`, \`B(i)\`, \`C(i)\` be instructions, each operating on data \`i\`, that are dependent on each other. In other words, \`A(i)\` must complete before \`B(i)\` can start. For example, \`A\` could load data from memory into a register, \`B\` could perform some arithmetic operation on the data, and \`C\` could store the data back into memory. However, let there be no dependence between operations for different values of \`i\`. In other words, \`A(2)\` can begin before \`A(1)\` finishes. Without software pipelining, the operations execute in the following sequence: A(1) B(1) C(1) A(2) B(2) C(2) A(3) B(3) C(3) ... Assume that each instruction takes 3 clock cycles to complete (ignore for the moment the cost of the looping control flow). Also assume (as is the case on most modern systems) that an instruction can be dispatched every cycle, as long as it has no dependencies on an instruction that is already executing. In the unpipelined case, each iteration thus takes 9 cycles to complete: 3 clock cycles for \`A(1)\`, 3 clock cycles for \`B(1)\`, and 3 clock cycles for \`C(1)\`. Now consider the following sequence of instructions with software pipelining: A(1) A(2) A(3) B(1) B(2) B(3) C(1) C(2) C(3) ... It can be easily verified that an instruction can be dispatched each cycle, which means that the same 3 iterations can be executed in a total of 9 cycles, giving an average of 3 cycles per iteration. Implementation Software pipelining is often used in combination with loop unrolling, and this combination of techniques is often a far better optimization than loop unrolling alone. In the example above, we could write the code as follows (assume for the moment that \`bignumber\` is divisible by 3): for i = 1 to (bignumber - 2) step 3 A(i) A(i+1) A(i+2) B(i) B(i+1) B(i+2) C(i) C(i+1) C(i+2) end Of course, matters are complicated if (as is usually the case) we can't guarantee that the total number of iterations will be divisible by the number of iterations we unroll. See the article on loop unrolling for more on solutions to this problem, but note that software pipelining prevents the use of Duff's device. In the general case, loop unrolling may not be the best way to implement software pipelining. Consider a loop containing instructions with a high latency. For example, the following code: for i = 1 to bignumber A(i) ; 3 cycle latency B(i) ; 3 C(i) ; 12(perhaps a floating point operation) D(i) ; 3 E(i) ; 3 F(i) ; 3 end would require 12 iterations of the loop to be unrolled to avoid the bottleneck of instruction \`C\`. This means that the code of the loop would increase by a factor of 12 (which not only affects memory usage, but can also affect cache performance, see code bloat). Even worse, the prologue (code before the loop for handling the case of \`bignumber\` not divisible by 12) will likely be even larger than the code for the loop, and very probably inefficient because software pipelining cannot be used in this code (at least not without a significant amount of further code bloat). Furthermore, if \`bignumber\` is expected to be moderate in size compared to the number of iterations unrolled (say 10-20), then the execution will spend most of its time in this inefficient prologue code, rendering the software pipelining optimization ineffectual. By contrast, here is the software pipelining for our example (the prologue and epilogue will be explained later): prologue for i = 1 to (bignumber - 6) A(i+6) B(i+5) C(i+4) D(i+2) ; note that we skip i+3 E(i+1) F(i) end epilogue Before getting to the prologue and epilogue, which handle iterations at the beginning and end of the loop, let's verify that this code does the same thing as the original for iterations in the middle of the loop. Specifically, consider iteration 7 in the original loop. The first iteration of the pipelined loop will be the first iteration that includes an instruction from iteration 7 of the original loop. The sequence of instructions is: :Iteration 1: \`A(7) B(6) C(5) D(3) E(2) F(1)\` :Iteration 2: \`A(8) B(7) C(6) D(4) E(3) F(2)\` :Iteration 3: \`A(9) B(8) C(7) D(5) E(4) F(3)\` :Iteration 4: \`A(10) B(9) C(8) D(6) E(5) F(4)\` :Iteration 5: \`A(11) B(10) C(9) D(7) E(6) F(5)\` :Iteration 6: \`A(12) B(11) C(10) D(8) E(7) F(6)\` :Iteration 7: \`A(13) B(12) C(11) D(9) E(8) F(7)\` However, unlike the original loop, the pipelined version avoids the bottleneck at instruction \`C\`. Note that there are 12 instructions between \`C(7)\` and the dependent instruction \`D(7)\`, which means that the latency cycles of instruction \`C(7)\` are used for other instructions instead of being wasted. The prologue and epilogue handle iterations at the beginning and end of the loop. Here is a possible prologue for our example above: ; loop prologue (arranged on lines for clarity) A(1) A(2), B(1) A(3), B(2), C(1) A(4), B(3), C(2) ; cannot start D(1) yet A(5), B(4), C(3), D(1) A(6), B(5), C(4), D(2), E(1) Each line above corresponds to an iteration of the main pipelined loop, but without the instructions for iterations that have not yet begun. Similarly, the epilogue progressively removes instructions for iterations that have completed: ; loop epilogue (arranged on lines for clarity) B(bignumber), C(bignumber-1), D(bignumber-3), E(bignumber-4), F(bignumber-5) C(bignumber), D(bignumber-2), E(bignumber-3), F(bignumber-4) D(bignumber-1), E(bignumber-2), F(bignumber-3) D(bignumber), E(bignumber-1), F(bignumber-2) E(bignumber), F(bignumber-1) F(bignumber) Difficulties of implementation The requirement of a prologue and epilogue is one of the major difficulties of implementing software pipelining. Note that the prologue in this example is 18 instructions, 3 times as large as the loop itself. The epilogue would also be 18 instructions. In other words, the prologue and epilogue together are 6 times as large as the loop itself. While still better than attempting loop unrolling for this example, software pipelining requires a trade-off between speed and memory usage. Keep in mind, also, that if the code bloat is too large, it will affect speed anyway via a decrease in cache performance. A further difficulty is that on many architectures, most instructions use a register as an argument, and that the specific register to use must be hard-coded into the instruction. In other words, on many architectures, it is impossible to code such an instruction as \\"multiply the contents of register \`X\` and register \`Y\` and put the result in register \`Z\`\\", where \`X\`, \`Y\`, and \`Z\` are numbers taken from other registers or memory. This has often been cited as a reason that software pipelining cannot be effectively implemented on conventional architectures. In fact, Monica Lam presents an elegant solution to this problem in her thesis, A Systolic Array Optimizing Compiler (1989) (). She calls it modulo variable expansion. The trick is to replicate the body of the loop after it has been scheduled, allowing different registers to be used for different values of the same variable when they have to be live at the same time. For the simplest possible example, let's suppose that \`A(i)\` and \`B(i)\` can be issued in parallel and that the latency of the former is 2 cycles. The pipelined body could then be: A(i+2); B(i) Register allocation of this loop body runs into the problem that the result of \`A(i+2)\` must stay live for two iterations. Using the same register for the result of \`A(i+2)\` and the input of \`B(i)\` will result in incorrect results. However, if we replicate the scheduled loop body, the problem is solved: A(i+2); B(i) A(i+3); B(i+1) Now a separate register can be allocated to the results of \`A(i+2)\` and \`A(i+3)\`. To be more concrete: r1 = A(i+2); B(i) = r1 r2 = A(i+3); B(i+1) = r2 i = i + 2 // Just to be clear On the assumption that each instruction bundle reads its input registers before writing its output registers, this code is correct. At the start of the replicated loop body, \`r1\` holds the value of \`A(i+2)\` from the previous replicated loop iteration. Since \`i\` has been incremented by 2 in the meantime, this is actually the value of \`A(i)\` in this replicated loop iteration. Of course, code replication increases code size and cache pressure just as the prologue and epilogue do. Nevertheless, for loops with large trip counts on architectures with enough instruction level parallelism, the technique easily performs well enough to be worth any increase in code size. IA-64 implementation Intel's IA-64 architecture provides an example of an architecture designed with the difficulties of software pipelining in mind. Some of the architectural support for software pipelining includes: * A \\"rotating\\" register bank; instructions can refer to a register number that is redirected to a different register each iteration of the loop (eventually looping back around to the beginning). This makes the extra instructions inserted in the previous example unnecessary. * Predicates (used to \\"predicate\\" instructions; see Branch predication) that take their value from special looping instructions. These predicates turn on or off certain instructions in the loop, making a separate prologue and epilogue unnecessary.

It was originally operated by Shell but was sold in 2008 and is now operated by Fairfield Energy and partners MCX. Under Fairfield initially the platform was operated using the duty holder model. Amec (now AMEC Foster Wheeler) were the duty holder contractor and Aker Solutions was the engineering and upgrade project contract. Fairfield became the duty holder in April 2014. The Field was originally discovered in July 1973 in a water depth of 151 metres (495 ft) approximately 12 km from the UK-Norway median line. Estimated recovery is 363 million barrels of oil. The oil reservoir is located at a depth of 9,000 feet (2,740 metres). Dunlin acts as the host platform for production from the Osprey and Merlin subsea fields. Production Production started in August 1978 from the Dunlin Alpha platform. This platform is a concrete gravity base (GBS) structure of the ANDOC type (Anglo Dutch Offshore Concrete) and was installed in June 1977. It has four legs and storage capacity for 838,200 barrels of oil. The total sub-structure weight is 225,000 long tons (229,000 tonnes) and it is designed to carry a topsides weight of 15,635 long tons (15,886 tonnes). The storage system was decommissioned by Shell from 2005 to 2007 prior to the sale to Fairfield Energy. The topsides facilities included capability to drill, produce, meter and export oil. It also has capability to re-inject water to maintain reservoir pressure, (111,250 bls/day)predicted. Peak production was 115,000 barrels per day in 1979; and it was approximately in the region of 3500 - 4000 bpd in 2015 prior to the shut in announcement (Production ceased on 15 June 2015) Oil production is by pipeline to Cormorant Alpha and then by Brent System pipeline to Sullom Voe, Shetland. Associated gas powers electrical generation. Some gas was flared. Subsea Satellite Fields Osprey was developed by Shell in 1989/90 and employs two drill centres, one for production (with 8 subsea trees) and one for water injection (with 4 subsea trees). The drill centres are connected to the platform via two back to back flowline bundles containing 2 off 8\\" production flowlines and a 10\\" water injection line. Subsea trees and the manifolds were supplied by Cameron Oil Tools (now OneSubsea). Subsea control system was supplied by Kvaerner FSSL (now Aker solutions). The Merlin field was discovered in 1998 and was initially developed as a low cost CRINE field (Cost Reduction In the New Era) utilising the discovery well recompleted as a subsea producer. The Merlin drill centre was progressively expanded to 3 subsea production wells and a single water injector. The flowlines from Merlin comprise 8\\" water injection and production lines. These tie into the Osprey riser system at Dunlin. Merlin subsea controls tie in via a crossover manifold adjacent to Dunlin into the Osprey umbilical system. Flexible flowlines were installed for water injection service on Merlin and Osprey in 2002. Osprey and Merlin produce from the same Brent sequence geology as the main Dunlin Field. Pipeline Infrastructure Fairfield installed a 4\\" fuel gas import line from the Thistle platform in 2012 to provide fuel for the platform power generation plant. The field had become gas deficient (insufficient associated gas being produced as a by product of oil production) under Shell. In an attempt to mitigate this Shell had installed a 33KVa power import cable between Dunlin and Brent C in 2002. The Brent sequence fields rely on water injection to maintain production and Dunlin had an installed water injection plant capable of delivering 250,000 bwpd supplied by 5 electrically powered water injection pumps. Dunlin acts as a pipeline node on the Brent system and provides connection point for the 16\\" export line from the Enquest operated Thistle and Don Fields and the 16\\" line from the Murchison field (the latter in the process of being decommissioned by Canadian Natural Resources International - CNRI - June 2015) Decommissioning In May 2015, Fairfield Energy has announced plans to decommission its Dunlin Alpha platform in the North Sea. The decommissioning process, which requires regulatory approvals, is expected to cost about ¬£400 million. Dunlin has been cited as an example of the impact a decommissioning decision has impacting surrounding infrastructure as per the 2014 Wood MER (Maximising Economic Recovery) Report - the \\"Domino Effect\\".https://www.oilandgaspeople.com/news/3882/low-oil-price-domino-effect- to-shut-more-north-sea-fields-early/ Enquest will have to provide a pipeline \\"bypass\\" to allow continued export from the Thistle complex of fields to be exported via the 16\\" export line into the 24\\" line that runs from Dunlin to Cormorant Alpha. The decommissioning of the Murchison field and the Dunlin complex removes two \\"shippers\\" from the Brent system resulting in increase pipeline operating costs for the remaining users.

He held the office from 2006 until his resignation in 2018, following his election to a fourth term in 2017. He resigned after he was convicted on 47 federal charges related to corruption at city hall. On April 17, 2015, Pawlowski announced that he would run for the U.S. Senate in 2016, but he suspended his campaign the following July. He was a candidate for Pennsylvania governor in 2014, but dropped out of the race in February after \\"it became clear that he was not going to be able to raise the necessary money.\\" Early life and education Ed Pawlowski was born to small business owners in Chicago. The family owned and operated a popular Polish restaurant on the city's North Side. Pawlowski attended school in Chicago and Addison, Illinois, where he earned his high school diploma in 1983. Following his high school graduation, he enrolled at Moody Bible Institute, in Chicago, Illinois, where he received his bachelor's degree. He went on to earn a master's degree in urban planning and public policy from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Personal life Pawlowski has been married for 25 years to Lisa, a community activist and licensed social worker in Allentown, who he met at Moody. They have two children, both of whom attend Allentown public schools.  Early career and first mayoral election  After his years at MBI, Pawlowski then worked as a community organizer in Chicago's Southwest Side, focusing on helping residents find quality, affordable housing and improving their quality of life. Pawlowski then enrolled at the University of Illinois to pursue his master's degree in urban planning and public policy. He was then hired to be the executive director of Windows of Opportunity, the non-profit subsidiary of the Chicago Housing Authority, where he supervised the development of special programs and self-sufficiency projects designed to help Chicago's public housing residents, which at the time numbered more than 100,000. In 1996 he became executive director of Lehigh Housing Development Corporation, which under his leadership expanded to six counties and over 50 employees, becoming a regional community development corporation now known as Alliance for Building Communities. Due to his success in reviving and strengthening this organization, he was recruited to the post of director of community and economic development for the City of Allentown by then-mayor Roy Afflerbach. Pawlowski was then recruited to challenge Afflerbach for mayor by dozens of community activists and business leaders who believed the city was headed in the wrong direction. Pawlowski was elected to his first term as mayor in 2005 by a majority of the voters. Pawlowski was the first candidate for mayor to win every precinct in a competitive election‚Äîa distinction he maintained through his 2009 re-election bid. Pawlowski streamlined operations in city hall, while increasing services to the residents of Allentown. Under his leadership, crime in the City of Allentown is down over 30 percent. His efforts to market Allentown have produced more than 75 million dollars in state and federal grants to rebuild city parks, develop new downtown businesses, and improve the quality of life for families in Allentown. =Safer streets= When Ed Pawlowski became mayor of Allentown in January 2006, crime was at a five-year-high in every single category, far above the state average. Since then, he has transformed Allentown into a safer city and decreased crime year after year by directing the installation of assisting a high-tech security network, tackling quality of life issues, and providing safer streets and neighborhoods to the third largest city in Pennsylvania. Mayor Pawlowski rebuilt the police force by hiring 80 additional police officers since taking office and working with police to focus on cleaning up crime hot spots. Last year alone, he secured funding to hire an additional 20 officers and worked with the Police Department to launch tip411, an Internet- based tool that enables the public to text message anonymous tips to police. Pawlowski was instrumental in the creation of Allentown's state-of-the-art high-tech security network by securing state and federal grants to purchase more than 120 cameras to watch city streets‚Äîall focused on identifying and quelling crime hot spots. As a result, Allentown's crime rate has decreased for six consecutive years, according to the FBI and state police. During this period, overall crime has decreased by nearly 30 percent and violent crime has decreased 20%. = Fiscal management= As mayor, Pawlowski provided strong fiscal management to a city that was in debt, facing an $8 million deficit when he took office. Pawlowski transformed the inherited deficit into a $14-million-dollar cash reserve that helped Allentown weather the nation's worst economic downturn since The Great Depression. He converted traffic signals to LED technology, reducing electrical consumption and saving more than $120,000 annually. He reduced Allentown's vehicle fleet and consolidated EMS billing services to create a more efficient department. Although Allentown has not seen a property tax increase during Pawlowski's terms, the administration's fiscal responsibility has come into question. under Mayor Pawlowski's tenure in late 2012, Allentown's bond rating was downgraded to an A3 with a \\"negative outlook.\\" In 2012, he addressed a police pension fund crisis by offering a controversial solution (see controversies section) of leasing the city's publicly owned water and sewer systems for a period of 50 years. Despite public opposition to the lease, Mayor Pawlowski defended it, stating \\"In less than 24 months Allentown would be just another Pennsylvania city making very ugly headlines about bankruptcy and its leaders lacking the political courage to address its fiscal problems.\\" To reduce labor costs, Mayor Pawlowski initiated negotiations with two of Allentown's largest public employee unions, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), and crafted labor concession agreements. Through these agreements, the Mayor was able to save Allentown taxpayers more than $15 million over the next five years. =Parks and recreation= Mayor Pawlowski created a handicapped-accessible playground in Cedar Beach Park, which attracts children from every neighborhood in Allentown and beyond. He also added free spray parks for City children to cool off during hot summer days. Due to his efforts, Allentown has been designated as a Playful City USA Community for the fourth year in a row. The conversion of one pool to a spray park and the closure of another pool, both in less wealthy parts of Allentown, and the subsequent plans by the Pawlowski administration to launch a new pool in a more affluent area of the city created some degree of controversy. According to Colin McEvoy of the Easton Express Times, \\"\\"That drew concerns among the public and council members alike, particularly the idea of a pool being closed in one of the poorer parts of the city while a more affluent neighborhood gets a destination splash park.\\" Mayor Pawlowski's administration was also credited with bringing Allentown the coveted distinction as a \\"Tree City USA\\" for the first time in the City's History. This designation from the Arbor Foundation recognizes urban communities that have demonstrated a commitment to preserving urban forestry and sustainability. =Community development= Some noteworthy projects completed under the Pawlowski administration include: recreating the pre-World War II era Hanover Acres public housing project into the modern Overlook Park Community and the multimillion-dollar redevelopment of the Cumberland Gardens housing project on the city's south side. As mayor, Pawlowski established the \\"Landlord Hall of Shame\\" to force irresponsible landlords to clean up problem properties, and he directed the Police Department to focus on nuisance crimes such as graffiti, excessive noise and illegal parking. Despite these efforts, Allentown's poverty rate for families nearly doubled during Pawlowski's tenure, going from 14.6% in 2007 to 24.6% in 2011. He improved the city's infrastructure by advocating for State and Federal Funding for three new bridges now under construction‚Äîincluding one of the few federally funded bridges in Pennsylvania. That project, known as the \\"American Parkway Bridge\\" will connect Route 22 to Center City Allentown for the first time in 60 years. The Pawlowski Administration has also created programs to focus on neighborhood street-scape improvements, a new fire station, and the installation of approximately 1,200 ADA ramps. This year, using a grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation, Allentown will lead the Commonwealth and the Nation in the fight for greater regulation and oversight of natural gas pipelines. This grant was issued in response to a 2011 natural gas pipeline explosion that leveled an entire city block and killed five Allentown residents.  Third term re-election campaign In the May 21, 2013 primary election, Pawlowski, running for a third consecutive term as mayor on the Democratic ticket, not only won the Democratic nomination but also the Republican nomination through a grassroots write-in campaign initiated by a number of local Republican activists and businessmen. Pawlowski is the first mayor in the history of the City of Allentown to earn both the Republican and Democratic nominations for mayor. President of the Pennsylvania Municipal League Pawlowski was elected as the President of the Pennsylvania Municipal League in 2013. Previously, Pawlowski had served as both First and Second Vice President of the organization. The Pennsylvania Municipal League (PML) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization established in 1900 as an advocate for Pennsylvania's 3rd class cities. Today, the PML represents participating Pennsylvania cities, townships, town, boroughs, and home rule municipalities that all share the League's municipal policy interests. The President and Board of Directors oversee the administration of a wide array of municipal services including legislative advocacy (on both the state and federal levels), publications designed to educate and inform, education and training certification programs, membership research and inquiries, consulting-based programs, and group insurance trusts. As president, Pawlowski has focused on increasing the statewide profile of the Municipal League, developing programs to help urban communities address pressing challenges such as lack of job growth, unfunded pension liabilities, and working with legislators in Harrisburg to ensure that cities are provided with the support and resources necessary for them to serve as economic catalysts for their regions. Candidacy for U.S. Senate On April 17, 2015, Pawlowski announced his intentions to run for the U.S. Senate as the Democratic candidate. He will compete with Joe Sestak in the primary election, with both candidates running for the seat held by current Senator Pat Toomey. In his campaign announcement, he touted his success as a pragmatic problem solver who has brought more than $1 billion of new development and thousands of new jobs to Allentown while eliminating operating and pension obligation deficits. \\"I can take my record of success and the lessons I‚Äôve learned in Allentown to Washington and make things work for all of us again,\\" Pawlowski said during his announcement speech. \\"The game has been rigged against us for too long. The playing field is not level. Businesses that think themselves too big to fail also seem to believe they are too big to care and we are too small to matter. Only together can we create change.\\" Pawlowski went on a brief announcement tour and picked up numerous endorsements along the way. The Metropolitan Regional Council of Carpenters and the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 542, both in Philadelphia, announced their support of Pawlowski, as did the Lehigh Valley Building Trades Council. Pawlowski was also endorsed by fellow mayors Bob Donchez of Bethlehem, Sal Panto of Easton and Vaughn Spencer of Reading; Pennsylvania state Reps. Michael Schlossberg, Peter Schweyer, Dan McNeill and Thomas Caltagirone; and Adrian Shanker, chairman of the LGBT Caucus of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Pawlowski suspended his campaign four days after the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a search in City Hall and questioned officials in connection with a grand jury investigation.  Controversies  = Lease concession = Ed Pawlowski and the majority of Allentown City council advocated throughout 2012 and 2013 for the lease of the city's publicly owned water and sewer systems to cover soaring pension costs for high-ranking police officers negotiated under the previous administration. The proposal to lease the city's water and sewer systems for 50 years came under significant public scrutiny, especially considering successful legal action by surrounding municipalities that left the city with considerable budget shortfalls involving Allentown's Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ). Several meetings were held with the public in relation to the lease of water systems, the first being in July 2012. The final vote on whether the water lease would be approved and who would be permitted to purchase it relied on Allentown City Council. Residents expressed concerns over the safety of water systems in private hands, evidence from prior sales in other cities that suggested rates would skyrocket if the systems were handed over to a private or public firm, the importance of water staying a public asset, and several ethical concerns regarding the transparency of the process. Several residents also argued why the systems needed to be leased, considering that, if the lease succeeded, profits from the water and sewer systems would go into private coffers instead of public funds. Additionally, the Mayor's administration spent an undisclosed amount of public funds on hiring Public Finance Management (PFM) to research the situation and sell the public on the idea of leasing water and sewer systems. The amount spent to hire PFM was later discovered to have totaled $500,000. A conflict of interest was also purported when it was announced that PFM would negotiate the request for proposals for the water lease, thereby giving the firm a stake in the success of the water lease proposal. As a result of the controversy, a concerned citizens group later referred to as Save Allentown's Water was formed. Also, groups including but not limited to Food and Water Watch, Water Posse, and the Lehigh Valley Industrial Workers of the World all helped to oppose water privatization in the beginning. In October 2012, resident Elijah LoPinto submitted a petition to force Allentown City Council to discuss making the water lease a ballot question; however, council refused to discuss the petition or ballot question. Eventually, Save Allentown's Water and Food and Water Watch compiled a petition that would force the water lease to become a referendum issue. The petitioners gathered over 4,000 signatures from registered voters in Allentown, double the required 2,000. Despite the signatures being deemed valid, the petition was disqualified in February 2013 for not meeting requirements under the Pennsylvania Election Code and State Constitution. In April 2013, more public meetings were held as Allentown City Council prepared to commence with a final vote on the water lease. Mayor Pawlowski continued to defend his proposal despite the concerns of the public, stating that \\"In less than 24 months Allentown would be just another Pennsylvania city making very ugly headlines about bankruptcy and its leaders lacking the political courage to address its fiscal problems.\\" Over a hundred residents were in attendance at the final meeting on the water lease, where the lease was approved by city council by a 6-1 vote. The highest bidder for the water lease was Lehigh County Authority with a bid of $220 million. The LCA is a public water and wastewater utility governed by a nine-member board of directors appointed by the county, whose ratemaking practices are governed by the Pennsylvania Municipal Authorities Act. The lease-concession provided the city an upfront payment of $211 million, with annual payments of $500,000. The payments helped the city reduce its unfunded pension liability by $150 million, eliminate $30 million in water and sewer debt and reduce its annual Municipal pension obligation from $28 million to $6 million in a single year.‚Ä¢ http://www.governing.com/blogs/view/gov-how-allentown-sold-its-utilities-to- fund-its-pensions.html As a result, Standard & Poor‚Äôs Rating Services lifted Allentown‚Äôs bond rating by three notches from BBB+ to A+. The rating agency noted that the dramatic one time rate increase was due to city‚Äôs \\"significantly improved budget flexibility\\" as a result of its water and sewer system lease-concession agreement. The lease concession and bonds sold to finance development in the Neighborhood Improvement Zone collectively won Allentown recognition from The Bond Buyer as its \\"Deal of the Year\\", for the Northeast Region in 2013. = FBI probe and conviction= In 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began \\"interception of electronic and wire communications\\" in Allentown City Hall. On July 2, 2015 the FBI raided Allentown City Hall and Mayor Ed Pawlowski's home as part of a more-than-two- year investigation into Allentown's contracting practices. Several days later, Mike Fleck, campaign manager for Pawlowski and former Reading Mayor Vaughn Spencer, abruptly moved from his Allentown home. News reports at the time claimed that Fleck was secretly recording Pawlowski and Spencer for the FBI. Subsequently, two individuals pleaded guilty on bribery charges related to the investigation. Court documents related to one of the cases implicated an unnamed individual (\\"Public Official No. 3\\") who matches the description of Mayor Pawlowski. The defendant in the other case was Reading City Council President Francisco Acosta, and documents in that case implicated unnamed individual (\\"Public Official No. 1\\") matching the description of Reading's Mayor Spencer. Acosta received a two-year prison sentence. In November 2015, former Allentown assistant solicitor Dale Wiles pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Charging documents stated that Wiles was working under the direction of Public Official No. 3 when he steered a contract, initially scored in favor of another vendor, to a donor of the official. Eron Lloyd, a special assistant to Spencer, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery offenses. Charging documents stated that he conspired with Public Official No. 1. to bribe Reading City Council members to repeal campaign contribution limits for recipients of no-bid contracts. In January 2016, former Allentown Finance Director Gary Strathearn pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Charging documents stated Strathearn steered a contract to campaign donors of Public Official No. 3. That same month, Allentown Controller Mary Ellen Koval resigned and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit honest services fraud. Charging documents stated that Koval conspired with Public Official No. 3 to steer contracts with the city and with the Allentown Parking Authority to campaign donors. On January 20, 2016 the Allentown City Council unanimously voted no confidence in the mayor and called on him to resign. Additional guilty pleas relating to the FBI investigation were made in April 2016. Campaign manager Mike Fleck pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit extortion and bribery offenses and a single count of tax evasion. According to court documents, Fleck worked with several unnamed public officials in Reading and Allentown to deprive citizens of their \\"right to honest services\\" through \\"bribery and kickbacks.\\" Matthew McTish, president of McTish, Kunkel & Associates, an Allentown-based engineering firm, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery offenses. According to court documents, McTish donated to the campaigns of Public Officials No. 1 and No. 3 to secure municipal contracts in Allentown and Reading. In March 2017, Francis Dougherty, formerly a managing director for Allentown, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud in an alleged effort to steer city contracts and other services to Pawlowski campaign donors. According to court documents, Dougherty conspired with Public Official No. 3 to steer the city's streetlight upgrade contract to a campaign donor of Public Official No. 3. He also threatened to fire a city employee who did not write bidding documents in a way favorable to a campaign donor, court documents say. Patrick Regan, a former vice president with The Efficiency Network (TEN), pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud on June 12, 2017 in regards to the streetlight contract. According to court documents, Regan participated in a conspiracy with Dougherty to give Regan's company an advantage in the bidding process. Court documents state that Dougherty allowed Regan to rewrite the city's bidding documents for the contract and pass them through an intermediary, giving Dougherty a \\"degree of separation.\\" Regan was told the process was designed to \\"eliminate competition,\\" court documents state. Regan was also a donor to Pawlowski's mayoral, gubernatorial and U.S. Senate campaigns, according to campaign finance records. The TEN contract was canceled in the wake of the investigation. On April 3, 2017, Mark Neisser, a former business development manager of T&M; Associates, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery offenses. The charging documents indicate that Neisser admitted giving thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to Public Official No. 1 and to Public Official No. 3 to \\"gain or maintain his firm's competitive edge\\" to receive municipal engineering contracts in Reading and in Allentown. On July 25, 2017, Pawlowski was indicted in a pay-to-play scheme according to his lawyer. Pawlowski has denied any wrongdoing and will not be stepping down or dropping out of the campaign for a fourth term as Allentown mayor. On March 1, 2018, following a federal trial, Pawlowski was found guilty of 47 charges, including multiple counts of conspiracy, bribery, attempted extortion, false statements to federal officials, mail fraud, and wire fraud. He was also found not guilty of seven charges. After the conviction U.S. Attorney Louis D. Lappen said in a statement, Pawlowski \\"(sold) his office to the highest bidder to fund his personal ambitions\\". On March 7, 2018, Pawlowski announced his resignation as Mayor of Allentown. On October 23, 2018, Pawlowski was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison.

The band released two critically acclaimed albums in the mid-1980s and are best known for the independent chart hits \\"Graceland\\" and \\"Mahalia\\". Since The Bible's first split in 1990, lead singer Boo Hewerdine has maintained a solo career while the band itself has been intermittently active. History =Early years and \\"Walking the Ghost Back Home\\" (1985‚Äì1986)= The Bible was formed in 1985 in Cambridge, when former Great Divide frontman Boo Hewerdine teamed up with keyboard player/drummer Tony Shepherd (who'd played with jazz bands and drummed for Cambridge bands The Wobbly Jellies and Somewhere in the Foreign Office, the latter of which had featured future satirist Chris Morris on bass).Booklet notes, Walking The Ghost Back Home reissue Lazell, Barry (1998) Indie Hits 1980‚Äì1989, Cherry Red Books, , p. 20 Using Hewerdine's savings and several budget-rate studios, the duo recorded The Bible's debut album Walking the Ghost Back Home with the assistance of bass player Clive Lawson, jazz saxophonist Kevin Flanagan and drummer Dave Larcombe (the latter of failed \\"Oxbridge Duran Duran\\" band Roaring Boys).Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 223 Walking the Ghost Back Home was released in 1986 on the independent record label Backs Records. The album was well received by music pundits, giving The Bible a top-ten hit on the UK Independent Chart and staying in the chart for ten weeks. This was followed by the first release of \\"Graceland\\" as a single, which gave them a minor hit in the UK. After follow-up single \\"Mahalia\\" (which reached number 15 on the UK Independent Chart) The Bible was consolidated as a five piece group. Dave Larcombe was recruited as a full-time drummer (allowing Shepherd to concentrate on keyboards), Larcombe's former Roaring Boys bandmate Neill MacColl (brother of Kirsty MacColl) was recruited as lead guitarist after performing on various Bible B-sides, and Clive Lawson was replaced by a full-time bass guitarist, Leroy Lendor.Ankeny, Jason \\"[ The Bible Biography]\\", AllMusic. Retrieved 30 November 2010 =Chrysalis period: \\"Eureka\\", \\"The Bible\\" and first split (1987‚Äì1990)= On the strength of Walking the Ghost Back Home, The Bible signed to Chrysalis Records. \\"Graceland\\" was re-mixed for single re-release in February 1987 (though it eventually charted only slightly higher than the original release). Leroy Lendor had left the band at this point, and to cover for him the band brought in former Christian Death bass player Constance Redgrave to play on the remaining tracks on the \\"Graceland\\" EP and on 1987 live dates. By the time The Bible began recording tracks for a second album (initially self-producing with Pete Smith and Owen Morris), the band were without a bass player again. Neill MacColl's brother Calum ‚Äì a respected multi-instrumentalist from the folk music scene ‚Äì guested on bass guitar for the sessions. Unsatisfied with their initial work, The Bible ditched the existing new album recordings (some of which would later surface as B-sides) and opted to start again. At the suggestion of their management, the band recruited American country-rocker Steve Earle as their new producer, and recorded a more successful set of sessions with yet another guest bass player (this time Greg Harewood of Incognito/Mirage/Soul II Soul). These formed the basis for most of the second Bible album, Eureka, released in January 1988. In spite of good reviews, the commercial performance of Eureka was disappointing ‚Äì the album peaked at number 71 on the UK Albums Chart and its three singles failed to chart. Although the band had begun to record a third album (to be titled Anticlockwise), Chrysalis rejected the initial recordings in favour of repackaging earlier material. Leroy Lendor returned to the band in time for a re-recording of \\"Graceland\\" which provided The Bible with their highest charting single to date (reaching number 51 in the UK in April 1989) Chrysalis then opted to compile the song with most of the Eureka tracks as a stopgap album called The Bible, filling out the remaining space on the record with a number of B-sides. As further promotion, the Eureka single \\"Honey Be Good\\" was re-released and gave The Bible a second hit later that year, reaching number 54. The additional commercial pressures of being on a larger label did not sit well with Hewerdine, who later recalled \\"I think I felt under a lot of pressure. There were a lot of people telling me what I should do and I felt very bullied.\\"\\"About Boo Hewerdine\\" page on Boo Hewerdine homepage In early 1990, The Bible broke up in farcical circumstances. Having flown to Germany to perform \\"Honey Be Good\\" on what turned out to be a TV talent show, they lost to a man who performed under the name of Mr Gadget, wore a spinning bowtie with lights on it, and won by 140,000 votes as compared to The Bible's twelve. As Hewerdine later remembered it, \\"we all took it so personally that we split up.\\" =Post-split work and mid-'90s reformation (1990‚Äì1994)= Having already recorded a duo album with Darden Smith in between previous Bible commitments, Hewerdine now began a solo career. Shepherd moved into music teaching and session playing (among other work, playing keyboards on a number of early Oasis tours), while MacColl and Lendor teamed up with Calum MacColl and drummer/keyboard player Robert Bond III in a new band called Liberty Horses (who released a single album, Joyland, in 1993). In spite of the break-up, relationships between the band members remained fairly amicable: when interviewed in 2013, they would claim to have never really split up, but just to have periodically stopped when the band's money ran out and made it impossible to continue. In 1994, The Bible reformed (with the lineup of Hewerdine, Shepherd, Larcombe, Lendor and Neill MacColl) for recordings and a tour. The band released the Dreamlife EP in 1994. Tracks for a new album were recorded, including several songs co-written with former Danny Wilson frontman Gary Clark, a songwriting collaborator of Hewerdine's. Unfortunately, the band's new record deal failed and The Bible split up again before they could complete and release the album. MacColl went on to team up with Gary Clark in the band King L, who released one album (Great Day For Gravity) in 1995, featuring several more Clark/Hewerdine co-writes including \\"Greedy\\" and \\"Last Cigarette\\". Versions of both of the latter songs (plus the original title track from the Dreamlife EP and a version of the unreleased Bible song \\"Junk\\") surfaced on Hewerdine's 1996 solo album Baptist Hospital, which featured several appearances by MacColl (who also guested on the live dates). In 1999 the proposed third Bible album was finally assembled and released posthumously, under the name of Dodo. =Second reformation (2011‚Äìpresent)= The various members of The Bible maintained contact over the following decade- and-a-half. During this time Hewerdine continued his solo career and worked with Eddi Reader, while MacColl played with David Gray and Kathryn Williams. In late 2011, The Bible reunited for two concerts (at the ABC 1/2 in Glasgow on 29 September and The Grand in Clapham, London on 30 September) to promote the new Red Grape Records reissue of Walking the Ghost Back Home. In addition to the promotional dates, they also announced that they were working on new material. In 2013, Eureka was reissued for its 25th anniversary by Cherry Red Records as a double disc, including B-sides and different mixes. The Bible played two dates in promotion at the Islington Assembly Hall (1 March) and The Met in Bury (15 March), with an unavailable Dave Larcombe now replaced on drums by Martyn Barker (Shriekback, King Swamp) and with former Dream Academy member Kate St John playing saxophones and accordion. A live album recorded at the Bury gig was scheduled for later in the year but has not yet been released. The concerts saw the debut of two new Bible songs, 'Money Spider' and 'Static'. The band are currently recording a fourth album in intermittent sessions \\"as and when schedules allow\\".\\"The Bible Interview\\", Music-News.com, 5 March 2013 The band recently performed a 30th Anniversary concert ‚Äì originally scheduled for September 2016, but cancelled, the concert took place on 27 January 2017 at Under the Bridge in Fulham.

It was the first BMW automobile with a monocoque structure. The 700 was a sales success at a time when BMW was close to financial ruin. The 700 was also successful in its class in motorsport, both in its stock form and as the basis of a racing special called the 700RS. More than 188,000 were sold before production ended in November 1965. Upon discontinuing the 700, BMW left the economy car market. Concept, design, and engineering Wolfgang Denzel, the distributor of BMW cars in Austria, commissioned Giovanni Michelotti to prepare concept sketches based on a lengthened BMW 600 chassis.BMW - Bavaria's Driving Machines, Norbye, pp. 124-125 In January 1958, Denzel was awarded a development contract for the 700. Denzel presented a prototype to BMW's management in July 1958. The concept, a two-door coup√© with a slanted roof, was generally well received, but objections were raised about the limited passenger space. BMW decided to produce two versions, the coupe, and a two-door sedan with a taller, longer roof. The engineer responsible for the chassis and suspension was Willy Black, who had designed and engineered the 600. The drivetrain and suspension were similar to those of the 600, with a rear-mounted flat-twin engine powering the rear wheels, leading arm suspension at the front, and semi trailing arm suspension at the rear. The 700 used a steel monocoque structure, and was the first BMW automobile to do so. The engine was an enlarged version of that used in the R67 motorcycle and the 600. With a bore of and of stroke, the engine displaced . The engine originally used a single Solex 34PCI carburetor and had a compression ratio of 7.5:1, resulting in a power output of . Reception The coupe and saloon versions of the 700 were shown at the 1959 Frankfurt Motor Show. After the show, BMW received 25,000 orders for 700s. Production of the BMW 700 Coupe began in August 1959, with the saloon version following in December. The large number of orders was welcome news for BMW, which was in a financial crisis. In December 1959, shareholders blocked a proposal by BMW's supervisory board to merge BMW into Daimler-Benz.BMW - Bavaria's Driving Machines, Norbye, p. 132 The subsequent heavy investment in BMW by Herbert QuandtThe BMW Story Horst Monnich has been attributed in part to the success of the 700. By April 1960, production of the 700 was at 155 cars per day. 188,211 BMW 700s were built in five years of production. Development The first variant of the 700 to appear after the original coup√© and saloon was the 700 Sport in August 1960. Available only as a coup√©, the Sport used an uprated engine with a pair of Solex carburetors and a 9.0:1 compression ratio. This brought the power output to . The Sport also had a rear anti-roll bar. A ribbed oil pan was used to reduce the oil temperature of the more powerful engine. The 700 Sport was renamed the 700 CS in 1963. The 700 Cabriolet was introduced shortly after the 700 Sport, and was available only with the Sport's 40 horsepower engine. The convertible body was made by Karosserie Baur of Stuttgart.Deutsche Autos 1945-1990, Band 4, Oswald, p.184 2,592 convertibles were built. A Saxomat semi-automatic transmission was offered as an option on 700s from September 1960. The 700 Luxus (deluxe) replaced the original saloon in 1962. A longer wheelbase variant, the LS, was also added, extending the wheelbase by . In February 1963, the size of the inlet valves in the 700's base engine was increased. This increased power to . The final development of the 700 was the 700 LS Coup√© of 1964. This was a long-wheelbase coup√© with the Sport engine. 1,730 LS Coup√©s were built. Production of the BMW 700 ended in November 1965. By that time, the successful New Class cars had established themselves in the marketplace. High demand for these larger cars with larger profit margins led BMW to stop making economy cars. BMW eventually returned to the economy car market in 2002 with the Mini.The Ultimate History of BMW, Noakes, pp.172-174 An attempt to transfer the rights to body production and export markets of the 700 to Autocars Co. in Israel in 1965 fell through. E. Illin Industries had earlier tried to start an enterprise in assembling 700s in Israel, which resulted in four 700s being assembled there in April 1963. The 700 was assembled in Argentina by Metalmec√°nica SAIC and sold as a De Carlo 700 Glamour until 1964 when the same running gear was clothed with a Simca 1000 look-alike body as the De Carlo SL. A small number of coup√©s were assembled there in 1961.http://bmw700.club/the-700-story/ File:BMW 700.jpgBMW 700 saloon File:BMW 700 Sport.jpgBMW 700 LS Coup√© File:BMW 700 Cabrio (ret2).JPGBMW 700 Cabrio Motorsport Race-prepared BMW 700 Sport Several racing drivers competed in BMW 700s.

Electoral history Marston was first elected as MP in the 2006 federal election, defeating incumbent Liberal MP Tony Valeri by a 466-vote margin. He was subsequently reelected in 2008 and 2011. He lost his seat in the 2015 election to the Liberal candidate, and former Mayor of Hamilton, Bob Bratina.

The city itself is administratively subdivided into nine Union Councils. Geography The district lies between 27¬∞40'-29¬∞16' north latitudes and 60¬∞45'-70¬∞01' east longitudes. The riverain area of the district lies close to eastern bank of the river Indus and Panjnad. The Rahim Yar Khan District is bounded on the north by Muzaffargarh District, on the east by Bahawalpur District, on the south by Jaisalmer district (India) and Ghotki District of Sindh province, and on the west by Rajanpur District. This district is divided into three main physical features: (a) Riverside area, b) canal-irrigated area, and (c) desert area which is called Cholistan. The Riverside area of the district lies close on the southern side of the Indus river mainly falling in the river bed. The canal-irrigated area lies on the south and is separated by main Minchan Bund. The approximate height of the irrigated area is above sea level. The third part of the area, called Cholistan, lies in the south of the irrigated tract up to the Indo-Pak border. The surface of the desert consists of a succession of sand dunes rising at places to a height of and covered with the vegetation peculiar to sandy tracts. Demography According to the 1998 census of Pakistan, the total population of Rahim Yar Khan district was 3,141,053 of which 19.16% were urban an intercensal percentage increase of 70.6 since March, 1981 when it was 1,841,451. The average annual growth rate was 3.2 percent during this period. The total area of the district is 11,880 square kilometres which gives population density of 264 persons per square kilometre as against 155 persons observed in 1981 indicating a fast growth rate of the district. The urban population was 616,582 or 19.6 percent of the total population of the district which grew at an average rate of 4.3 percent during 1981-98 and had decreased from 4.7 percent observed during 1972-81. There are three Municipal Committees and five Town Committees in the district. The population of the district is predominantly Muslims i.e. 96.7 percent. The next higher percentage is of Hindu (Jati) with 1.8 percent, followed by Scheduled Castes 0.6 percent. The Bhagwan Shri Krishna Mandir is one of the main Hindu temple in Rahim Yar Khan district. While other minorities like Christians, Ahmadi etc. are very small in number. The proportion of population of Muslims is higher in urban than rural areas. According to the 1998 census, the most widely spoken first languagedefined as the language for communication between parents and children in the district was Saraiki, spoken by 62.6% of the population. 27.3% identified their language as Punjabi, 2.9% ‚Äì as Urdu and 2.9% ‚Äì as Sindhi. The local dialect (see Riasti) belongs to the southern dialect group of Saraiki. (requires registration). Other languages spoken are Bagri/Choolistani and Haryanvi. History It has been renamed customarily amid last 5000 years, first available (on record) name was AROR or ALOR, and then it became City of Pattan, Phul Wada, Noshehra and now Rahim Yar Khan. The ancient tower of Pattan Minarah is standing just 13 km away from city center in the south in its original form. Rahim Yar Khan has had the status of a separate district since 1943. The district derives its name from its headquarters, the city of Rahim Yar Khan, which was known as \\"Naushehra\\" until 1881.

History Opened in September 1990 in a ceremony presided over by Governor of Virginia L. Douglas Wilder, the $106 million facility was built to provide initial relief to the then overcrowded Virginia correctional system. The facility opening allowed for the subsequent closure of the Virginia State Penitentiary in downtown Richmond. The execution chamber moved from the former state penitentiary to Greensville in 1991.Richardson, Selden. The Tri-State Gang in Richmond: Murder and Robbery in the Great Depression (True Crime Series). The History Press, 2012. , 9781609495237. p. 203. Initially, the center was classified as a maximum security facility. However, with the subsequent opening of other facilities intended for the most hardened violent criminals, the security classification at Greensville has been lowered to medium security. There is a double perimeter fence topped with razor wire as well as six high guard towers to bolster perimeter security. The facility consists of 4 pod-style buildings (three have a capacity for 516 inmates each; the fourth can handle 192 higher- risk inmates) arranged in a hexagon in a campus-like setting. The tract of land upon which the Correctional Center is constructed measures . It is located one mile (1.6 km) from Interstate 95. The primary contractor for the project was Morrison-Knudsen. In 1995, a minimum-security work camp for low- risk inmates was constructed adjacent to the main complex. Together, the two facilities have a capacity of 3,007 inmates. The facility contains a dedicated health care unit and mental health center which serves inmates in the eastern region of the Virginia corrections system. It is also home to the state death chamber, which was completed in April 1991. There have been 111 executions by electrocution or lethal injection that have taken place in the L Building, located at the rear of the facility.

It was made from 1946 to 1958 as only a chassis at Rolls-Royce's former Merlin engine plant, their Crewe factory, alongside the shorter Bentley Mark VI. The Bentley too was available as a chassis for coachbuilders but also for the first time could be bought with a Rolls-Royce built standard steel body. It was announced by Rolls-Royce in April 1946 as the 25/30 hp replacement for the 1939 Wraith in what had been their 20 hp and 20/25 hp market sector, that is to say Rolls-Royce's smaller car. The size was chosen to be in keeping with the mood of post-war austerity. Even very limited production of the chassis of the larger car, the Phantom IV, was not resumed until 1950 and then, officially, only for Heads of State.Peter Pugh The Magic of a Name: The Rolls-Royce Story, Part 2: The Power Behind the Jets 2015 Icon Books. , Improvements announced were: chromium-plated cylinder bores for the engine; a new more rigid chassis frame to go with new independent front suspension; and a new synchromesh gearbox. Chassis lubrication was now centralised.News in Brief. The Times, Thursday, 4 April 1946; pg. 2; Issue 50418 Engine The straight six-cylinder postwar engine, which had been briefly made for the aborted by war Bentley Mark V, replaced conventional overhead valve gear with an F-head configuration of overhead inlet valves and side exhaust valves and reshaped combustion chambers. There were new main and big-end bearings and a more efficient drive to the timing gear. To this prewar mix Rolls-Royce added chromed bores. Initially, this engine retained the Mark V's capacity of increased from 1951 to and in 1955, after the introduction of the (standard wheelbase) Silver Cloud, to for the remaining Silver Wraiths. Chassis The first cars had an entirely new 127 inch (3226 mm) wheelbase chassis which differed considerably from that of the pre-war Wraith and was much nearer rigid. It matched the new Bentley chassis but with an extra 7 inch section added to the centre. The new chassis had coil sprung independent front suspension, which required a very rigid chassis to function properly, and at the rear conventional semi-elliptic springs and live axle. The braking system was a hybrid hydro-mechanical system with hydraulic front brakes and mechanical rears using the mechanical servo similar to that of the pre-war cars. The last short-wheelbase cars were delivered in November 1953. The long, 133 inch (3378 mm), wheelbase chassis was announced in 1951 and the first delivered in January 1952. 639 were made by the time of the last deliveries in October 1958. This was not quite the last Rolls-Royce model to be supplied as a \\"chassis only\\" ready for a wide variety of bespoke coachwork designed and made by a rapidly declining number of specialist coachbuilders. Most of the bodies selected used \\"formal\\" limousine designs. From 1949 until 1955 customers wishing to buy a Rolls-Royce fitted with a much smaller standard steel body could purchase the Silver Dawn. It rode on a chassis seven inches shorter than the Silver Wraith, and was almost identical to Rolls-Royce's Bentley Standard Steel saloon available alongside the Silver Wraith since July 1946.

Its main attraction was punk music. The name comes from the fact the building it was in originally began as a deaf people's clubhouse in the 1930s. Founding Daphne (dead name \\"Robert\\") Hanrahan, manager of The Offs discovered the San Francisco Club for the Deaf, and was able to rent it on a nightly basis. She remembers finding the place: ‚ÄúI bought a burrito at La Cumbre and noticed a sign on the fire escape across the street. It said ‚ÄòHall for Rent.‚Äô I went up the flights of stairs and saw two guys watching TV with the sound off. After a very short while, I realized we weren't going to communicate, so I wrote on a piece of paper that I wanted to rent the place. Bill‚ÄîI never knew his last name‚Äîwas a mustachioed, lascivious, cigar-chewing character who apparently was in charge. He wrote ‚ÄòOK & $250,‚Äô so I wrote ‚ÄòOK.‚Äô‚ÄùTHE ROOTS OF SAN FRANCISCO PUNK: THE DEAF CLUB, 1978-1980 The first show as the Deaf Club on 9 December 1978 featured the Offs, started by guitarist Billy Hawk and singer Don Vinil, and later joined by former Hot Tuna drummer Bob Steeler and a rotation of horn players including Bob Roberts, Richard Edson and Roland Young. They were accompanied by The Mutants, who are known for their theatrical performances which often include elaborate props, projections, and comical antics. They are credited with being one of the first \\"Art-punk\\" bands in San Francisco, and were one of the most popular bands of the San Francisco punk scene during the late 1970s and early 1980s. On The Rag also participated in the Deaf Club's first show. Over 100 bands such as Northern California's The Dead Kennedys, Tuxedomoon, The Units, The Zeros, Crime, The Dils, Flipper, Negative Trend, Los Microwaves, The Jars, Minimal Man, Voice Farm, Humans, Pearl Harbor and the Explosions, The Sleepers, Avengers, Factrix, Bpeople, S.S.I., NON, MX-80, V.I.P$, K.G.B., Monitor, Blowdryers, BoB, VKTMS, Snuky Tate, JJ180, On The Rag, Noh Mercy, No Alternative; as well as Southern California's Bags, The Alley Cats, Germs, X, Soul Rebels, Walking Dead, Wall of Voodoo, The Rotters, Seizure, Z'EV, Barry Kooda Kombo, Vs., Fillmore Struts, Punts, Inflatable Boy Clams, Jah Hovah, Plugz, Suburbs, The Vandals, The Controllers, Nervous Gender, U.X.A., Dinettes, and some touring bands from Vancouver like D.O.A., Pointed Sticks, and Subhumans, and even touring bands from England like Levi and the Rockats would play this small underground club. Given the unique nature of the venue and its location in the Mission District near 16th Street and the Roxie Theater, it was enthusiastically supported by the punk and arts community, visited by film greats like John Waters and occasionally challenged by the officials of the San Francisco noise abatement patrol, the police, fire department, health department and the alcohol and beverage control until it closed. The house DJs were Enrico Chandoha who worked on the editorial staff of the early Thrasher Magazine; Jack Fan (an Offs road manager and chef at the Zuni); BBC celebrity Johnnie Walker; and Robert Hanrahan. About such venues, Brendan Earley of The Mutants comments: > \\"The earthiness, I guess, of playing places like the Deaf Club seemed to > have a lot more energy to them. You know the crowd that started coming to > this music in '77, it was maybe a peak of their scene, or the scene at that > time. They were not normal kinds of clubs, they weren't places like the > Stone, or even the Mabuhay, really. They were neat places to play; often > good audiences, and good energy going on.\\"Quote cited from White Noise > Records. ‚Ä≥A possibly unique aspect of the club was the constant presence of actual deaf people in the hall, who didn't know what to make of their unruly musical cohorts‚Äîbut counterintuitively, they did seem to enjoy the music. Indeed, punk music might be tailor-made for deaf people to enjoy, because of the constant frenetic thudding of the 4/4 beat that can be sensed as vibrations. As Penelope Houston of The Avengers said, ‚ÄúIt was kind of amazing. I think they were dancing to the vibrations. The deaf people were amused that all these punks wanted to come in and rent their room and have these shows.‚Äù According to artist Winston Smith, ‚ÄúThey put their hands on the table and they could hear the music. It was music they could appreciate because it was so loud.‚Äù‚Ä≥ In an interview Robert Hanrahan says \\"The social aspect of being able to participate and be accepted was big for the deaf people. They enjoyed being exposed to a different subculture like their own. It was very convivial, no fights or hassles.Deaf Club \\"I was there...\\" By Daphne Hanrahan Walking Dead Records compilation albums The four partners in Walking Dead Records developed a live compilation project that resulted in an album released by Optional Record distribution of Berkeley, CA on the Walking Dead label: \\"Can You Hear Me? Music From the Deaf Club.\\" It was recorded on a mobile 8 track by Jim Keylor (also of Army Street Studios), DJ'ed by Johnnie Walker , produced by Robert Hanrahan who also managed and booked the Club, and coordinated by Peter Worrall. The photos selected for the album were taken by Sue Brisk, the album art was by Diana Miami (aka Diana Stumbo) and the liner notes were written by V. Vale of RE/Search/Search & Destroy. It was recorded live at the club during early 1979 and is a testament to the authentic underground punk and \\"new wave\\" scene during that period in San Francisco's music history. The album featured The Mutants' \\"Tribute to Russ Meyer\\" and \\"Monster of Love\\" and performances from other first and second generation San Francisco Punk bands like: * Offs ‚Äì \\"Hundred Dollar Limo\\", \\"Die Babylon\\", \\"I've Got the Handle\\" (Offs were: Don Vinyl, Billy Hawk, Bob Roberts now of Spotlight Tattoo in Los Angeles, Bob Steeler and Denny Boredom who also played with Hot Tuna) * Pink Section ‚Äì \\"Jane Blank\\", Francine's List\\" & \\"Been In The Basement 30 Years\\" (Pink Section was: singer Judy Gittelsohn and drummer Carol Detweiler (both members of Inflatable Boy Clams), singer / guitarist Matt Heckert (Survival Research Laboratories), and bassist Stephen Wymore.) * Tuxedomoon ‚Äì \\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\", courtesy of The Rolling Stones and \\"Heaven\\" from the film Eraserhead (Tuxedomoon was: Winston Tong, Steven Brown, Blane Reinenger, Peter Carcinogenic (Principle), Greg Langston on drums, With Bruce Geduldig on visuals) * KGB ‚Äì \\"Dying in the USA\\" & \\"Picture Frame Seduction\\" * Dead Kennedys with \\"Police Truck\\", \\"California Uber Alles\\", \\"Short Songs\\" & \\"Straight A's\\". Raymond Pepperell, Jr., better known as East Bay Ray of the Dead Kennedys used the original two track safety masters from that live eight track recording to release their recent 2004 Live at the Deaf Club CD. From the Deaf Club, Walking Dead also produced, with William Passerelli, Dirk Dirksen (Mabuhay Gardens), Paul Rat Bachavich (Temple Beautiful) & Goody Thompson: the Western Front Festival. The festival engaged the Deaf Club and every venue, (including the \\"art clubs\\": A.R.E., Target Video, Valencia Tool & Die, Club Foot, the A-hole and Club Generic) in the San Francisco Bay Area that embraced punk culture and music for a week long event. Reviews In a conversation with Robert Hanrahan at the Deaf Club during a show during the Western Front with one of the Dinettes of San Diego, Joel Selvin the music critic for the SF Chronicle who was attracted by the energy surrounding the punk scene promised to \\"put the scene on the map.\\" Selvin authored an extensive article published in the San Francisco Chronicle, October 22, 1979 on page 6 entitled \\"S.F. Goes Punk.\\" It documented the scene during that time and included interviews with Dirk Dirksen, Joe Rees, Robert Hanrahan, Johnnie Walker and Paul Rat Bachavich. He also mentioned the Deaf Club in a subsequent publication: \\"San Francisco: The Musical History Tour : A Guide to over 200 of the Bay Area's Most Memorable Music Sites\\" where he disparages the Club as \\"one of the stranger scenes on the punk rock scene.\\" Tono Rondone, a member of the Frank Hymng Band, which featured Fritz Fox of The Mutants, remembers a humorous sideline to the history of The Deaf Club: \\"At one point, there was a headline in the San Francisco Chronicle which told of the temporary closing of The Deaf Club whose headline read 'Deaf Club Closed Due to Excessive Noise Levels.'\\" Herb Caen in his daily San Francisco Chronicle column dated Monday August 13, 1979 \\"Have a Weird Day\\" said: \\"I don't know about you, but I find it slightly bizarre that The Deaf Club at 530 Valencia ‚Äì indeed a social hangout for deaf people ‚Äì features punk rock groups, such as Zen, Off, The Pink Section, Blow Driers and Mutants. \\"The louder the better!\\" beams Edward Juaregui, executive director of Deaf Self Help. \\"We all like to dance, and we can feel the vibrations.\\" How about the neighbors? \\"Oh,\\" continued Edward, \\"they're going crazy. They keep calling the cops, complaining the noise is deafening. Isn't that rich?\\" Ethan Davison a fan said \\"The most interesting thing about the Deaf Club was that it was a real Deaf Club. The members stood around with the rest of us drinking the pow- erful drinks. I don't sign, so I never ‚Äúspoke‚Äù to any of them, but what I was told was that they enjoyed our music because they could feel the vibrations on the floor. I imagine that they also enjoyed the visual display, for we were the most visually interesting visual community at the time. People would dye their hair a different shade of blue, green, or purple every week. It can now be said that I never had trouble buying a Bloody Mary, even though I was sixteen.\\"the deaf club an un-oral history Kathy Peck, of the Contractions, remembers the Deaf Club fondly, explaining that, \\"The place was filthy. My boots would stick to the floor. The deaf people would dance to the vibration of the beat. Robert Hanrahan would do a radio show with Johnny Walker (BBC punk rock DJ) on the side of the stage, it seems. Robert Hanrahan, manager of the Offs discovered the San Francisco Club for the Deaf in 1978, and was able to rent it on a nightly basis. It was great fun. The Deaf Club was more a like a neighborhood place, very underground, in the Mission District. People would give the deaf sign for a beer as the Offs, the Contractions, Middle Class, No Alternative, and the Dils played. People like Ginger Coyote (Punk Globe) would hang out, dance, and drink. The bathroom was full of graffiti. We'd load in, and the punk bands would always get in crazy fights, especially Brittley Black, drummer of Crime, who fell out of the upstairs window many a night.The deaf people were receptive. They could ‚Äúhear‚Äù through the wooden floor‚Äîa simple floor, made from planks or linoleum. It could catch the vibrations. FrankMoore from the Outrageous Beauty Pageant was there in his wheelchair that people dragged upstairs, since it was on the second floor. Dirk Dirksen (Mabuhay club promoter and San Francisco music icon) nurtured his career. As Bonnie Hayes from the Punts says, ‚ÄúThe club was utterly un-controlled, which was one of the best things about it. It was basically like a big, really messy party at someone's house. It seemed private, like an inside thing - you would meet everybody and be in the family.‚Äù In his daily San Francisco Chronicle column dated Monday August 13, 1979, \\"Have a Weird Day\\", Herb Caen said: \\"I don't know about you, but I find it slightly bizarre that The Deaf Club at 530 Valencia ‚Äì indeed a social hangout for deaf people ‚Äì features punk rock groups, such as Zen, Off, The Pink Section, Blow Driers and Mutants. \\"The louder the better!\\" beams Edward Juaregui, executive director of Deaf Self Help. \\"We all like to dance, and we can feel the vibrations.\\" How about the neighbors? \\"Oh,\\" continued Edward, \\"they're going crazy. They keep calling the cops, complaining the noise is deafening. Isn't that rich?\\" In a conversation with Klaus Flouride of The Dead Kennedys he looks back at the state of the Deaf club.\\"I remember it being working-class, but I don't remember it being that dingy, but we played an awful lot of pretty dingy punk clubs. That didn't ever impress upon me that much. I think that ‚ÄúCalifornia √úber Alles‚Äù might have come out by the time we played there, but I really don't think so, because we still had 6025 in the group. So, it was still before we had a single out. We were still early on in the thing. There was a folding table in the back. They sold cans of Budweiser. I think it was for like a buck apiece. Back then, you could get Buds for $2.50 or $3.00 a six-pack, or something like that, so they were doing okay. That was your bar. The thing that impressed me the most was that when we were watching the Germs I was right up front, and I was trying to talk to the person next to me. Everybody was grabbing somebody's ear and hollering to try and talk, whereas the deaf members, the people who were deaf and frequented the place on an everyday basis, would just lean forward towards the stage and sign each other‚Äî no problem with communication.\\"the deaf club an un oral history Esmerelda Kent of Noh Mercy recalls that, \\"The Deaf Club was down the street from our ‚Äúhouse‚Äù which was a ginormous storefront, 1920s dry goods store on Valencia Street that is now Artists Television Access (ATA Gallery) at 992 Valencia St., where me, Tony Hotel, and our manager (and Tuxedomoon's manager) Adrian Craig lived. We had a huge basement that had secret passages (connecting all the block) where we used to record and practice. The Deaf Club was my favorite club because of how strange it was. One night after we played at the end of the night, I went backstage and changed and I thought everyone had left because it was so quiet I was sure I was alone. I went out and the room was full with over a hundred people all signing. I wondered if drunk deaf people slurred their sign language.They loved the music because they could feel it. Deafness knows no specific demographic, so rich, poor, old, young, black, Asian, anyone could be and often was deaf and they were all there. Who knew? It was great to write a note of what you wanted to the bartender and see old ladies drinking with spiked mohawk punks.\\" Closing The club closed with a party hosted by the artist and filmmaker Bruce Conner. The club had a history of being closed for various reasons, such as by the fire marshal for the lack of sprinklers. Holding private parties with a closed door policy was a way of it continuing to run. The DEAF CLUB closed after the WESTERN FRONT, a September‚ÄìOctober festival of West Coast Bands, which went underreported. As Biafra said, \\"The magic of the DEAF CLUB was its intimate sweaty atmosphere, kind of like a great big house party. The club remained raw to the very end. References * Selvin, Joel.

Based on the Silver Cloud II, it shared a V8 engine and General Motors Hydra-Matic automatic gearbox with that model. Rolls-Royce assembled the cars' chassis and drivetrains with bodies made to standard designs by coachbuilders Park Ward, and James Young, former vendors absorbed by Rolls-Royce. The engine was a 6,230 cc 90-degree V8 with twin SU carburetors, coupled to a 4-speed automatic transmission. The car had massive drum brakes and a wheelbase of 3,683 mm. A four speed automatic transmission and power assisted steering were standard. A shallow gear gave a walking speed which was suitable for ceremonies. From 1963 onward, the Silver Cloud III's 7% more powerful engine and new front wings (incorporating the latter's quad headlamps) were fitted. Park Ward vs James Young models Of the 832 total built between 1959 and 1968, James Young made 217 bodies. Park Ward, owned by Rolls-Royce, made 607 bodies. In 1962, H. J. Mulliner & Co. was merged by Rolls-Royce with Park Ward to form Mulliner Park Ward. Prior to the merger, eight Phantom Vs had been made by H.J. Mulliner.

Everything was black except for the radiator, even the wheels. Lennon asked for the radiator to be black as well, but Rolls Royce refused. Originally the car was customised from Park Ward with black leather upholstery, cocktail cabinet with fine-wood trim, writing table, reading lamps, a seven-piece his-and-hers black-hide luggage set, and a Perdio portable television. A refrigeration system was put in the boot, and it was one of the first cars in England to have tinted windows. He probably paid ¬£11,000 (nearly ¬£210,000 in today's general inflation value). Lennon didn't know how to drive and didn't get his driving licence until 1965, at twenty- four years of age. He sometimes hired a 6'4\\" Welsh guardsman named Les Anthony. In December 1965, Lennon made a seven-page list of changes that cost more than ¬£1900: the back seat could change into a double bed, a Philips Auto- Mignon AG2101 floating record player that prevented the needle from jumping, a Radio Telephone and a cassette tape were added, while speakers were mounted in the front wheel wells so that occupants could talk outside via microphone. The car needed a new paint job after Lennon used it in Spain during his filming in Richard Lester's How I Won the War. Lennon commissioned a custom paint job from private coach makers J.P. Fallon Ltd. in the style of a Romany gypsy wagon (not \\"psychedelic\\" as often referenced). Artist Steve Weaver painted the red, orange, green and blue swirls, floral side panels and a Libra on the roof. Lennon was in a 60s mood and wanted to make a statement to the English establishment. He loved telling a story about an elderly woman who hit the car with her umbrella. To match his later White Album period, Lennon also bought another all-white Phantom V in 1968. In 1977, Lennon donated the yellow Phantom V to the Cooper-Hewitt Museum at the Smithsonian Institution to cover an IRS bill of $250,000. The Cooper-Hewitt sold the car in 1985 for $2,299,000 to Canadian businessman Jim Pattison, who donated it to the Province of British Columbia. It was on display during Expo 86 in Vancouver, and since 1993 it has been in the Royal British Columbia Museum in Canada. = Queen Elizabeth II = Two cars built in 1960 and 1961 joined the fleet of two earlier Phantom IV's. Having been retired from active service in 2002, both are now on public display: one in the royal motor museum at Sandringham, and the other in the special garage aboard HMY Britannia in Leith, Edinburgh. Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother acquired a Rolls-Royce Phantom V Landaulet (registration plate NLT 1) in 1962 which is now used by Charles, Prince of Wales. = Others = The Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten used a Phantom V for ceremonial occasions. It was removed from Hong Kong by the Royal Navy immediately following the handover to China on 1 July 1997. The Philippines had a 1960 Phantom V that was owned by former First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos, wife of President Ferdinand Marcos. The car at the Philippine Presidential Car Museum. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, owned a Phantom V. Since his exile, the car has been kept in his royal residence in Tehran and is occasionally shown to the public among the other luxurious cars owned by the Shah, including a unique Rolls-Royce Phantom VI and a Phantom IV. Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito had a 1960 Rolls-Royce Phantom V in presidential collection for representative purposes. The car is now displayed at the Museum of Yugoslavia, Belgrade. Elton John had a pink 1960 Park Ward. Liberace had a 1961 that became a part of his show at the Las Vegas Hilton. It also appeared in the movie Behind the Candelabra Elvis Presley had a 1963 James Young. It came with few extra options but did have a telephone, Firestone whitewall tyres, electric windows, and air conditioning. The centre rear armrest had a writing pad, mirror and clothes brush. An unusual feature was a microphone for the singer. It was originally painted Midnight blue, but Elvis had to repaint it a light silver as his mother's chickens kept pecking the paint. Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu bought a 1967 landaulet but returned it to Rolls Royce upon the disapproval of the Politburo. It was used by Queen Elizabeth II on two-state visits.

At least one study has found that quinpirole induces compulsive behavior symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder in rats. Another study in rats show that quinpirole produces significant THC-like effects when metabolic degradation of anandamide is inhibited, supporting the hypothesis that these effects of quinpirole are mediated by cannabinoid CB1 receptors.

She played an important role in the elite society of Los Angeles and, later, Santa Monica. She was married to two wealthy Anglo-American men over the course of her life, Abel Stearns and then Colonel Robert S. Baker. Like many californias of her time, Arcadia Bandini provided to her Anglo husbands opportunities for entrance into and alliances within the established californio elite society. She was a skilled businesswoman in her own right, as well as a renowned hostess and organizer of balls and other social functions. Through her Bandini family wealth and the wealth of her husbands, Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker amassed an enormous estate and fortune, and upon her death was one of the wealthiest women in America. In her later life, she was considered \\"the great benefactress of Santa Monica\\" for her investments in and contributions to the development of the city. Because she had no children and did not leave a will, her death prompted an infamous court battle for control of her estate. Early life: the Bandini family Arcadia Bandini was born in 1825 in San Diego, California to Juan Bandini and Marie de los Dolores Estudillo. Her father Juan, born in Peru, was considered the \\"first citizen of San Diego,\\" and the Bandini family home, Casa de Bandini, was the center of San Diego society. The social gatherings and dances in the Bandini home and gardens were so renowned that Juan Bandini achieved legend status and was labeled by historian Winifred Davidson as the \\"Prince of Hosts.\\" In addition to being social elites, the Bandinis were one of the richest landholding families in the area, which made the three daughters very attractive potential marriage partners to ambitious men seeking land and status in the californio community. Bandini and her two younger sisters, Ysidora and Josefa, were known as three of the most beautiful women in Alta California. Juan Bandini, a former revolutionary himself, supported the Anglo American invaders during the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt. His extensive business dealings with Anglo American men like Abel Stearns led him to believe that the future of California would be American, not Mexican. Bandini and her sisters Ysidora and Josefa were said to have made a United States flag out of fabric from their own clothes and put it up at Juan Bandini's San Diego ranch in 1847. Marriages El Palacio, the adobe home where Arcadia and Abel lived =To Abel Stearns= Portrait of Abel Stearns At age 14, Arcadia Bandini married the 43-year-old Anglo-American Abel Stearns, who had moved west from his hometown in Lunenburg, Massachusetts. The marriage was arranged by Juan Bandini, Bandini's father, as Stearns and Juan Bandini were close political allies and friends. Bandini's younger sister, Ysidora, moved to Los Angeles with her to be her companion. Because Abel Stearns was not born a Mexican citizen, he had to petition the Los Angeles civil government to marry Bandini. He also had to petition the Catholic authorities, which was standard procedure for the time; the Church considered all prospective Catholic marriages to ensure that the parties' ages were appropriate, that they were not already married to others, whether their births were legitimate, and, chiefly, whether the union would be incestuous. While the gap in their ages was substantial, at 29 years (and Stearns himself claimed to authorities to be 40 rather than 43, perhaps to make the gap smaller), it was relatively common at this time for very young californias to marry significantly older Euro-American men. The Catholic Church had determined 11 to be the age below which a girl could not get married, so Bandini was above that standard. Stearns, a former U.S. citizen, became a naturalized Mexican citizen and converted to Catholicism in order to do business and own property in Mexican California. He became one of the wealthiest men in Los Angeles, and his wealth was supplemented by Bandini's substantial dowry of land. They lived together in a home called El Palacio (The Palace; also known as the Don Abel Stearns House), built in 1859 in the Pueblo de Los Angeles. This large adobe home, which surrounded an extensive courtyard and patio, was a major site for Los Angeles high society. Here, the couple entertained and hosted influential guests like Commodore Jones and Captain Fr√©mont. An 1860 census form recorded 19 people living in El Palacio, including \\"Refugio Bandini, Bandini's sisters, nieces, nephews, distinguished guests, secretaries, servants, painters, and laborers\\" in addition to Abel and Arcadia. Arcadia Bandini de Stearns, along with her sisters, hosted many balls and other grand social functions for elite californios and naturalized Anglo- Americans like Stearns; de Stearns Baker, in particular, has been characterized by scholars as having \\"ruled Los Angeles society\\" in this period. Abel Stearns, nicknamed \\"Cara de Caballo\\" (Horse Face) for his long face, was generally known and remembered as a good friend and husband, but was also known to have a bad temper. de Stearns Baker's grand-nephew Ricardo Bandini Johnson told a reporter from the Santa Monica Mirror that Abel was \\"often away\\" from home and thus \\"did not pay a lot of attention to Arcadia.‚Äù The couple did not have any children. Stearns died in 1871, at age 72, leaving all of his fortune (in land and money) to de Stearns Baker. Portrait of Colonel Robert S. Baker =To Colonel Robert S. Baker= In 1875, the widowed de Stearns Baker married Colonel Robert S. Baker (1826‚Äì1894), a wealthy Anglo American from Rhode Island who owned Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica, where they settled. Colonel Baker had come to California in 1849 during the Gold Rush and worked in the San Francisco mining supplies business, as the company Cooke and Baker. He then worked in the cattle and sheep trade in Northern California, before purchasing Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica from the Sepulveda family for the opportunities in the cattle trade it offered. With this purchase, he moved to Los Angeles, where he met and married de Stearns Baker. Baker's possession, through the marriage, of the Bandini family's holdings of Rancho La Laguna and Rancho La Puente further expanded his ranching business. The couple moved to Santa Monica, where they played a crucial role in the development of the community (see below in \\"Santa Monica\\" section). They resided in \\"Ocean Cottage\\" by the pier. At the home, de Stearns Baker continued to do what she had done so well in Casa de Bandini and El Palacio - entertaining and hosting many elite guests and influential political figures. The Bakers did not have children. Colonel Baker died in 1894, leaving his money and estate to the again widowed de Stearns Baker.Baker Family de Stearns Baker continued to live in their home on Ocean Avenue until her death in 1912. Portrait of Arcadia de Baker in 1885  Landowner, businesswoman, and benefactress  Though she married to two Anglo-American men and during her lifetime California came under control of the United States, de Stearns Baker reportedly never spoke English, but rather did business in Castilian Spanish. Thus, she required an interpreter; for many years, her husband Abel Stearns filled this role. de Stearns Baker's choice to continue to speak her native tongue links her to other elite california women like Rosal√≠a Vallejo, who famously refused to speak in English. = Los Angeles = Much of the commercial life of the city of Los Angeles, as well as the high society life, centered on Abel and de Stearns Baker because of the prominence of Abel Stearns' warehouse, \\"La Casa de San Pedro.\\" The warehouse operated as one of the four most significant trading ports in the West during this time period and was connected from San Pedro to Los Angeles via a stagecoach line. de Stearns Baker's name was on all of Abel Stearns' investments alongside his, so she shared in his wealth as a business partner in addition to as a wife. After Stearns' death, de Stearns Baker ran his businesses. Even when de Stearns Baker had moved to Santa Monica, she remained a powerful presence in Los Angeles society and charity work. In the early 1900s, when she was in her seventies and thus not very involved with the new women's clubs of the city, she was still \\"a key source of funds, in-kind donations, and society support\\" for the club causes. de Stearns Baker's wealth and social status made her \\"the most formidable of all\\" the elite California women, and she worked with Los Angeles club women on events like the yearly Fiesta de las Flores. = Santa Monica = The Arcadia Hotel in Santa Monica, named for Arcadia Bandini de Stearns BakerArcadia de Stearns Baker was known as the \\"godmother of Santa Monica\\" and a \\"great benefactress\\" for her contributions to and vision for the formation and development of the city. As she created the original map for the city plan and layout, her aesthetic vision was crucial in structuring Santa Monica. She donated a great deal of her land ‚Äì for example, to the city of Santa Monica for Palisades Park; to the government to form a National Home for Disabled Veterans (now the Veterans' Administration); to the government to create the first experimental forestry station in the United States; and to schools, churches, and clubs (like the Bay City Women's Club). In 1879, de Stearns Baker bought out her husband Colonel Baker's land and business holdings and officially became the business partner of John Percival Jones. In 1897, de Stearns Baker and Jones founded the Santa Monica Land and Water Company, which \\"subdivided and developed about 50,000 acres in West Los Angeles.\\" Legacy Arcadia Bandini de Baker (1987) by Masahito Sanae (bronze bust on pedestal), Palisades Park, Santa Monica (Public Art in Public Places) The grand hotel at 1700 Ocean Avenue, by the Santa Monica pier, was named \\"The Arcadia Hotel\\" in honor of Arcadia Bandini de Baker. It opened its doors in 1887, but was closed down and demolished in 1909. On October 18, 1987, a bronze bust of Arcadia Bandini de Baker was unveiled at Palisades Park, Santa Monica. Created by artist Masahito Sanae, a plaque on the front reads: > DEDICATED/TO/ARCADIA BANDINI DE BAKER/1827-1912/FOR HER LOVE AND DEVOTION TO > SANTA MONICA AND/GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS OF LAND TO BENEFIT/THE PEOPLE AND > THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY/BY/THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA/BANDIDI FAMILY AND > FRIENDS/SANTA MONICA HISTORICAL SOCIETY/MASAHITO SANAE/SCULPTOR/OCTOBER 18, > 1987.  Ethnic/racial identity  Many elite Californios/as like Arcadia Bandini stressed their \\"Spanish\\" (rather than Mexican) blood and heritage, thus aligning themselves with Europe and whiteness and distancing themselves from the mestizaje (racial mixing) associated with Mexico Marrying white Anglo American men, like Abel Stearns and Robert S. Baker, served as further confirmation and assertion of whiteness. When this white or \\"Spanish\\" racial status was challenged, Californias like de Stearns Baker were often outraged. An instance described by scholar Eileen Wallis illustrates this. When the General Federation of Women's Clubs in Los Angeles made the decision to officially exclude African American women from their membership, the influential clubwoman Caroline Severance (though officially supporting the new policy) remarked that she did not understand why white Americans associated socially with \\"Italians, Spaniards, and representatives of other dark-skinned races,\\" but not with African Americans. De Stearns Baker, a benefactress of clubwomen causes and events, was so furious at being labeled part of a \\"dark- skinned\\" race that she decided not to participate in the annual Fiesta de Flores in Los Angeles and took back her donation to the fund, setting a precedent that other elite Californias followed.  Death and legal battle over estate  Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker died in 1912, at age 85, and was interred between her husbands at Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles. It is estimated that 2,000 people attended her funeral, held in St. Vibiana's Cathedral, which is a testament to her status as a public figure and pillar of the community. The numbers vary, but the estate she left was estimated to be between $8 and $15 million. Because she left no will, her death thus launched a large-scale court battle for control of her large fortune and holdings. In the years after her death, many potential heirs fought each other for the money. 42 distant relatives of Abel Stearns tried to claim the estate, but a Los Angeles judge ruled that their rights were terminated by the marriage of de Stearns Baker to Colonel Baker, so they eventually settled for 10%. In the end, the rest of the estate was distributed among de Stearns Baker's relatives. The legacy of this battle, and of Arcadia Bandini's philanthropy, was recently revived in a 2011 court case in which \\"advocates of homeless veterans\\" sued the Veterans Administration for renting out a substantial part of the land de Stearns Baker had originally donated to the federal government to found a National Home for Disabled Veterans. One of the plaintiffs was Carolina Winston Barrie, who was referred to as a \\"direct descendant\\" of Arcadia Bandini ‚Äì but because Bandini had no children, this is inaccurate in the traditional sense of the term. Barrie is rather the great-great niece of de Stearns Baker, and the direct descendant of one of the heirs of the estate. Ultimately, the federal government settled in the case and the Veterans Administration must \\"develop a master land-use plan...that identifies sites for housing homeless veterans.\\"  See also  * Don Abel Stearns House * Concepci√≥n Arg√ºello * Juana Briones de Miranda References People from Los Angeles Californios American people of Mexican descent Mexican people of Peruvian descent American people of Peruvian descent History of Santa Monica, California 1825 births 1912 deaths Clubwomen ","title":"Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker"},{"id":"3827564","text":"Rolls Royce Phantom III from circa 1936, photographed in Canberra in 2005 Rolls-Royce has used the Phantom name on full-sized luxury cars over the past century: *Rolls-Royce Phantom I, 1925-1931 *Rolls-Royce Phantom II, 1929-1936 *Rolls-Royce Phantom III, 1936-1939 *Rolls-Royce Phantom IV, 1950-1956 *Rolls- Royce Phantom V, 1959-1968 *Rolls-Royce Phantom VI, 1968-1990 *Rolls-Royce Phantom VII, 2003‚Äì2017 *Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coup√©, 2007‚Äì2016 *Rolls- Royce Phantom Coup√©, 2008‚Äì2016 *Rolls-Royce Phantom VIII, 2017‚Äìpresent Phantom ","title":"Rolls-Royce Phantom"},{"id":"3827566","text":"Stadio Comunale is Italian for \\"municipal stadium\\", and may refer to a main stadium in many towns in Italy and Italian Switzerland.

He has been described by critics as a conspiracy theorist and by the Anti- Defamation League (among other sources), as a Holocaust denier and antisemite. Biography Hoffman was born to a Catholic family in Geneva, New York. His father, the chief of physical therapy at Clifton Springs Hospital, was German- American. His mother was Italian-American. According to biographical information on the back cover of his book Judaism Discovered, Hoffman studied at the State University of New York at Oswego under Dr. Richard Funk and Dr. Faiz Abu-Jaber, father of Diana Abu-Jaber. Hoffman was reportedly taught at an early age about William Morgan, whose disappearance in 1826 resulted in the formation of the Anti-Masonic Party. He said that he learned from his maternal grandfather that elections in the United States were rigged by organized crime. From this, Hoffman was said to have deduced that \\"[n]othing is as it seems to be,\\" which in turn led to a \\"life long vocation, researching the subterranean workings of the occult cryptocracy's orchestration of American history\\". Hoffman claims to have operated an organic farm and to have lived among the Amish for several years. In 1995, Hoffman moved with his family to northern Idaho. There, he hoped to establish a museum that would detail the \\"Communist holocaust against Christians\\" (i.e., the persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union), \\"the holocaust against the Germans\\", (i.e., the bombing of Dresden and other major German cities in World War II), and the \\"Holocaust against Japan\\" (i.e., the bombing of Tokyo and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). Hoffman has written articles for the UK-based magazine Fortean Times,Fortean Times, issue no. 30. as well as the Lutheran newspaper Christian News of New Haven, MO, which is published by Otten.Dec. 10, 2012, p. 5 He has claimed to have worked as a reporter for the Albany, New York, bureau of the Associated Press. His interests include the alleged occult roots of Freemasonry, the command ideology of the Cryptocracy, Fortean phenomena, and the sacred texts of Orthodox Judaism.Paul Rydeen, \\"Through a Hoffman Lens Darkly,\\" Crash Collusion, Views =Holocaust denial and the Jews= Hoffman has been described by the Anti-Defamation League as a \\"Holocaust denier and anti-Semitic ideologue\\". Other authorities to call him a Holocaust denier include Michael Barkun of Syracuse University and Michael Whine.Stephen E. Atkins, Holocaust Denial as an International Movement (Praeger: 2009), p. 178.Michael Whine, \\"The Far Right on the Internet\\" in The Governance of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring (ed. Brian D. Loader: Routledge, 1997), p. 212. Mattias Gardell has asserted: \\"Antisemitism is prominent... in the worldview of Michael Hoffman II\\". Hoffman has worked on the projects of neo-Nazi Tom Metzger and of the Holocaust deniers Willis Carto, David Irving, Ernst Z√ºndel, and Herman Otten.Christian News, Dec. 10, 2012, p. 5 Hoffman was the Assistant Director of the Institute for Historical Review (!HR), a Holocaust denial organization for a period. He retains a connection with it. Stephen A. Atkins, in his book, Holocaust Denial as an International Movement (2009), wrote that Hoffman's newsletter Revisionist History promotes Holocaust denial and Hoffman contends that \\"the real Holocaust of World War II was deaths caused by the Allies.\\" He quotes Hoffman denying the existence of gas chambers: The Great Holocaust Trial: The Landmark Battle for the Right to Doubt the West's Most Sacred Relic (1985) is a sympathetic account of the 1980s Canadian trials of Ernst Z√ºndel. At the time, Z√ºndel was required to appear before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for \\"spreading false news\\", by distributing the Holocaust-denying pamphlet Did Six Million Really Die? in Canada. Hoffman's book argues that Holocaust denial material should be completely legal to publish. On his YouTube channel in 2016, Hoffman said: \\"Judaism‚Äôs focus is on self-worship, people who worship themselves, and this is where I see a corollary with Nazis and with what Hitler was doing.\\" He has claimed that Judaism has a positive view of pedophilia and advocates the hatred of non-Jews. He has claimed that early Jewish texts are equivalent to teachings \\"from the church of Satan\\". =Irish slavery myth= Hoffman is the author of They Were White and They Were Slaves: The Untold Story of Enslavement of Whites in Early America. The book was self- published in 1993. According to Derrick Jensen, Hoffman is \\"overtly racist\\" and \\"attempts to make the case that the enslavement of whites by commercial interests in Britain and the Americas was worse than the enslavement and genocide of Africans... perpetrated by those same interests.\\" Jensen said \\"Hoffman's analysis is seriously flawed\\" but that \\"his scholarship is impressive, and the story he tells is both interesting and horrifying\\". The book's espousal of the Irish slaves myth is considered by Liam Hogan (interviewed by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2016) to be responsible for the notion being absorbed by white supremacists. =Cryptocracy= Hoffman is the author of Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare which outlines his conspiracy theory of a shadow government or \\"cryptocracy\\" that gains power through manipulation of symbols and twilight language. Examples of such \\"psychodramas,\\" in Hoffman's view, include Route 66 (which connects various centers of occult significance), and the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, in which Hoffman sees ritualistic elements. The theory of masonic symbolism in the assassination of President Kennedy was first articulated by James Shelby Downard, with whom Hoffman co-authored King/Kill-33 which became the inspiration for a song by Marilyn Manson. Hoffman also states that this ruling cabal is slowly revealing the truth through movies such as They Live and The Matrix and other forms of symbolic and subliminal communication. Hoffman has appeared on the Alex Jones radio show to discuss his theories.

Vol. 3, No. 1, Spring 2001: 263-274. The GCD is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization incorporated in Arkansas. History One of the earliest published catalogs of comic books appeared in the 1960s, when Dr. Jerry Bails and Howard Keltner put together some projects to catalog the comic books of the \\"Golden Age.\\" These efforts were Dr. Bails' The Collector's Guide to the First Heroic Age of Comics, and Howard Keltner's Index to Golden Age Comic Books, and their collaboration on The Authoritative Index to DC Comics. The next big step in organizing data about comic books was Robert Overstreet's Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, which is still being published. This guide is sometimes referred to as the first best attempt to list factual information beyond the superhero comics. It was likely the first catalog to get widespread distribution. Today there are several other comic book price guides. In 1978, the GCD's immediate predecessor, APA-I (Amateur Press Alliance for Indexing) was formed by a few fans who were interested in exchanging information on comic books in index form. These people were generally interested in either one of two things ‚Äî either following the plot threads and continuity of the stories, or the creator credits. APA-I is also still running, as a paper-based index. The organization publishes a quarterly magazine. APA-I members have gathered editorial records and conducted interviews with comic book professionals, to add to the information that could be gleaned from the books themselves. In late 1993 and early 1994, three members of APA-I interested in comic books started up an e-mail correspondence. Tim Stroup, Bob Klein, and Jonathan E. Ingersoll soon began sharing indexing information in a common format using electronic media for storage and distribution. By March 1994, they had formed a new group to create an electronic version of APA-I related to comic books, giving it the name Grand Comic-Book Database and the goal to 'contain information on every comic book ever published'. The newly formed GCD grew slowly, using the new medium of e-mail to canvass friends and acquaintances from APA-I as well as other contacts in comics fandom. Early work consisted of indexing information, setting goals, and deciding on file structure. Information was distributed on floppy discs and via surface mail. The use of e-mail to knit together the group through constant communication has proved important to this day. There had been several previous attempts to set up similar groups that did not have this advantage. The original file structure has changed, and data distribution and collection methods are now almost exclusively over the Internet. It is one of several online databases of comic book information. In December 2009, a vote was held of the membership and it was decided to change the official name from \\"The Grand Comic-Book Database\\" to \\"The Grand Comics Database\\". Organization The Grand Comics Database is a volunteer organization of hobbyists. It is not a commercial endeavor, and its charter states that it will not become one. The database currently catalogs more types of information than originally intended, and the formats of presentation and data gathering have changed also. All data is available for research and use by the public at no charge. The project is overseen by a board elected by the members. Decisions on changes are to be made by the board as directed by member consensus. The project operates with several public contacts. * The Public Relations Coordinators post updates to Facebook, Twitter, and other outlets, and monitor the contact email account. * The Technical Coordinator oversees the technical work on the site and coordinates it with the non-technical aspects of the project. * The Rules Coordinators manage the process by which data entry and formatting rules are established. The bulk of the work is performed by an ever-changing group of editors and contributors through the online indexing system on the web site, or through offline submissions. Casual users of the website also make contributions through an error reporting system. And, because several comic book creators are members, these creators often provide details on their own work or colleagues' work. Several e-mail lists are maintained for communication of a variety of comic book-related information. The database does not include any information on comic book pricing, nor does it conduct any sales or trade services. Specifications The Grand Comics Database intends to catalog key story information, creator information, and other information which is useful to readers, fans, hobbyists, and researchers. This includes creator information such as writers, pencillers, inkers, colorists, letterers, and editors. It also includes story information such as: title, feature of the story, genre of the story, page count, characters, and a short synopsis. Stories are defined to include any feature in a comic book, which allows the database to include advertising, text articles in an issue, letter columns, character profiles, and any other features that are in a comic book. Also included is information on the comic books themselves, such as: publisher, publication date, price, page count, a cover image, and reprint information. The GCD project uses a broad definition of comic book; a comic book is 50% or more art and/or pictures which tell a story. The editors try to err on the side of inclusion, so that if there is a question, a book usually can be included. This definition eliminates any webcomics. However, it includes small print run fanzines, promotional giveaway comics, and minicomics. Although syndicated comic strips are not indexed, listings include mentions of comic books reprinting newspaper strips. Since 2004, comic book fans can index their favorite comic book using the convenience of a web-based interface. Anyone interested is encouraged to contribute, by using the interface, uploading a cover image scan, or even simply sending an e-mail with new information. The standards request that all indexing be done from an actual copy of the comic book, to ensure that data is verified upon entry. A group of editors then vets each entry before the information is added to the database. The database currently has comic books from many countries representing over forty languages, though United States issues represent the bulk of the data. There are active chapters and indexers in several other countries, including Germany, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. , the database includes information on over: * 12,900 publishers * 24,000 creators * 143,900 series * 1,600,000 issues (including 112,000 variants and over 2,600,000 stories) * 812,000 cover images See also * List of comic creators * List of comic books * List of comic book publishing companies References =Inline citations= =General references= * Allred, Will. \\"Credit Where Credit Is Due.\\" Quantum Zone - Behind the Scenes.

The film is based on the 1950 play The Man by Mel Dinelli who also wrote the screenplay. Plot The film is set in December, 1918 in an unnamed small town. A widow (Lupino) impulsively hires handyman (Ryan) to look after her house. She soon learns Ryan is a dangerous schizophrenic, but by the time she comes to this realization she is unable to leave her house and escape from him. Cast The cast includes the following: * Ida Lupino as Mrs. Helen Gordon * Robert Ryan as Howard Wilton * Taylor Holmes as Mr. Walter Armstrong * Barbara Whiting as Ruth Williams * James Willmas as Mr. Stevens * O. Z. Whitehead as Mr. Franks Production notes The play on which the film is based, The Man, was originally a short story by Mel Dinelli. Dinelli adapted the story for the stage. It debuted on Broadway in January 1950 starring Dorothy Gish. The story was also featured on the CBS radio show Suspense as \\"To Find Help\\" on January 18, 1945 with Frank Sinatra as Howard and Agnes Moorehead as Mrs. Gillis (Mrs. Gordon in the film). It was dramatized again on Suspense in 1949 with Gene Kelly and Ethel Barrymore on January 6, 1949. The movie was shot over an 18-day period in 1951 for Collier Young and Ida Lupino's production company, The Filmakers. Howard Hughes, then the head of RKO Pictures, withheld the film from release for a year. Co-star Robert Ryan later said that he felt Hughes tried to \\"bury\\" the film because Ryan was active in left-wing politics and spoke publicly about his involvement. Reception According to Bosley Crowther, the film is a \\"straight tour-de-force situation, clearly contrived and designed for no other positive purpose than to send shivers chasing up and down the spine. And in that respectable endeavor, its success will depend entirely upon how susceptible you are to illogic and little tricks of looming shadows and clutching hands.\\" Related works Earlier that year, Lupino and Ryan co-starred in On Dangerous Ground, a film noir directed by Nicholas Ray and produced by John Houseman. The story was the basis for a 1960 episode of the TV anthology Startime, with Audie Murphy and Thelma Ritter.

Alptekin is the son of Isa Alptekin, who claimed that during 1933‚Äì1934, he was the General Secretary of the First East Turkestan Republic in Western China when in reality he was a representative from Xinjiang in the KMT government. He has played very important roles for the foundation of some international organizations, the best known of which are the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) and the World Uyghur Congress. Biography After the Peaceful Liberation of Xinjiang in 1949 and succession by the new People's Republic of China, Alptekin's family fled to Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir. There he attended Catholic school and then Convent College, completing his studies in the Institute of Journalism in Istanbul. Alptekin is based in Germany. Career In 1971, due to his father's connections, he got a job at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) in Munich. He worked as a \\"Senior Policy Advisor\\" and directed the Uygur Division until 1979, when Uyghur- language broadcasts were discontinued for a lack of an audience under RFE/RL jurisdiction. During his time at the Division, he complained about lack of media coverage of the Uyghurs, lamenting \\"the international community only reacts when conflict breaks out.\\" Concurrently in the 1970s and 1980s, the CIA looked to connect to Uyghur separatists, and found Alptekin a suitable match because of his leadership in various Uyghur organizations and his tenure at RFE. He became an adviser to the CIA, and retired his RFE/RL post in 1995 as it moved to Prague in the Czech Republic. Erkin Alptekin has founded various organizations for separatist movements, mostly related to the Uyghur nationalist cause. In 1985 he participated in the founding of the \\"Allied Committee of the Peoples of East Turkistan, Tibet and Inner Mongolia\\", which held its first conference in 1998 in New York. He founded the East Turkistan Union in Europe in Europe. In 1991, he also became one of the founders of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO), which has its headquarters in The Hague. During a conference held in Munich in April 2004 Alptekin was elected the President of the World Uyghur Congress. Erkin Alptekin has been lobbying, not only for Uyghur nationalism but also for other separatist movements, peoples, and minorities, including the indigenous peoples in Western countries since 1971. Erkin Alptekin is also on the advisory board of several international organizations situated in Asia, Europe and in the United States. For the last 35 years Alptekin has attended more than 6,000 international conferences worldwide on various topics; published numerous articles, research papers and brochures; and has been the focus of several Western press media.

The Corniche was a development of the Mulliner Park Ward two-door versions of the Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. These were designated as the 2-door Saloon and Drophead Coup√©,The handbook of the Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow and Bentley T Drophead Coup√© and 2-door Saloon, 1969, www.ebay.com Retrieved 18 April 2020 introduced in 1965 and 1966 respectively. Production remained in London at Mulliner Park Ward; the new name was applied in March 1971. A Bentley version of the Corniche was also produced. It became known as the Bentley Continental from 1984 to 1995. The Corniche draws its name from the experimental 1939 Corniche prototype. The name originally comes from the French word corniche, a coastal road, especially along the face of a cliff, most notably the Grande Corniche along the French Riviera above the principality of Monaco. 1939 experimental Corniche The first car with the Corniche nameplate was a 1939 prototype based on the Bentley Mark V, featuring coachwork by the Parisian firm Carrosserie Vanvooren. It undertook 15,000 miles (24,000 km) of endurance testing in Continental Europe before being blown up by a bomb at a dock in Dieppe while awaiting shipment back to England. No production model was ever manufactured because of the onset of World War II, but the company registered the name for the future. Corniche The Corniche, available as coup√© or convertible, used the standard Rolls-Royce V8 engine with an aluminium-silicon alloy block and aluminium cylinder heads with cast iron wet cylinder liners. The bore was 4.1 in (104.1 mm) and the stroke was 3.9 in (99.1 mm) for a total of 6.75 L (6,750 cc/411 cuin). Twin SU carburettors were initially fitted, but were replaced with a single Solex 4A1 four-barrel carburetor introduced in 1977.Wood, p. 106 De-smogged export models retained the twin SUs until 1980, when Bosch fuel injection was added. A three-speed automatic transmission (a Turbo Hydramatic 400 sourced from General Motors) was standard. A four-wheel independent suspension with coil springs was augmented with a hydraulic self- levelling system (using the same system as did Citro√´n, but without pneumatic springs, and with the hydraulic components built under licence by Rolls- Royce), at first on all four, but later on the rear wheels only. Four wheel disc brakes were specified, with ventilated discs added for 1972. The car originally used a wheelbase. This was extended to in 1974 and in 1979. The Corniche received a mild restyling in the spring of 1977. Difference included rack-and-pinion steering, alloy and rubber bumpers, aluminium radiator, oil cooler and a bi-level air conditioning system was added. Later changes included a modified rear independent suspension in March 1979. In March 1981, after the Silver Spirit had gone on sale, the Coup√© version of the Corniche and its Bentley sister were discontinued. For 1985 there were also cosmetic and interior changes. Corniche models received Bosch KE/K-Jetronic fuel injection in 1977. This engine, called the L410I, produced approximately at just above 4,000 rpm for a top speed of . The Bentley version was updated in July 1984 with a new name, the Continental,Automobil Revue 1991. p. 174 revised and color-coded bumpers, rear view mirrors, a new dash and improvements to the seats. Production totaled 1090 Rolls-Royce Corniche Saloons, 3239 Rolls-Royce Corniche Convertibles, 69 Bentley Corniche Saloons and 77 Bentley Corniche Convertibles. The Corniche was popular with high income celebrities (see below), with the notable exception of Jeremy Clarkson who mocked James May's Corniche as \\"just a Ford Zephyr with a chrome nose.\\" File:'75 Rolls-Royce Corniche (Hudson).JPG1971-1973 Rolls-Royce Corniche (North America) File:'73 Rolls-Royce Corniche Convertible (Hudson).JPG1974-77 Rolls-Royce Corniche (North America) File:1974 Bentley Corniche DHC (US).jpg1974 Bentley Corniche Corniche II The Corniche II name was applied for the United States market from 1986 and for other markets from 1988. Anti-lock brakes were added for 1988, but air bags would not be available until the Corniche III. Also new for 1988 were some detail changes to the interior. Later in 1988 there was also a new reverse warning lens type and pattern around the rear license plate, as well as newly designed seats and redesigned instrumentation.Wood, p. 103 1,234 examples of the Corniche II were produced. Rear view of 1988 Bentley Continental (US) Corniche III The Corniche III was introduced at the 1989 Frankfurt Motor Show with new alloy wheels, color-coded bumpers, a more advanced suspension system, air bags and MK-Motronic fuel injections. Minor interior changes included a revised dashboard, console and seats. The revised, airbag-equipped dashboard (1990) Japanese Emperor's parade car (1990) Corniche IV The car was reworked for 1992 as the Corniche IV, presented at the January North American International Auto Show in Detroit. By this time production had moved to Crewe, in preparation for the 1994 closure of Mulliner Park Ward. Mechanically, the IV featured the four-speed GM4L80 automatic transmission rather than the previous three-speed GM400 unit. Adaptive suspension was also introduced. Visually there is nearly no difference between the Corniche III and IV except for a glass rear window replacing the previous plastic unit. The top mechanism was improved, no longer requiring manual latching. CFC-free air conditioning was specified, as were driver and passenger airbags. In October 1992 a 21st anniversary Corniche was presented. 25 cars were built, all finished in Ming Blue with a cream hood with a silver plaque on the dash.Wood, p. 107 In August 1993 engine power was increased by 20 percent. Corniche S The Rolls-Royce Corniche S The last 25 Corniche models to be built, completed in the summer of 1995, were unique turbocharged versions and were called the Corniche S. The photo was taken in the showroom of Vantage Motorworks, Inc. in Miami, Florida. Corniche (2000) Rolls-Royce Corniche The fifth series to bear the Corniche name made its debut in January 2000. At the time of its release, it was the most expensive vehicle offered by Rolls-Royce, with a base price of US$359,900. Its production was ended in 2001, as Bentley became a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG and continued manufacture in Crewe while Rolls-Royce became solely owned by BMW, manufacturing in a new factory built by BMW.

Since the average platelet size is larger when the body is producing increased numbers of platelets, the MPV test results can be used to make inferences about platelet production in bone marrow or platelet destruction problems., Lab Tests Online. MPV may be higher when there is destruction of platelets. This may be seen in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), myeloproliferative diseases and Bernard‚ÄìSoulier syndrome. It may also be related to pre-eclampsia and recovery from transient hypoplasia., Arch Pathol Lab Med. Vol 133, September 2009;1441-43.. Abnormally low MPV values may correlate with thrombocytopenia when it is due to impaired production of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, such as in aplastic anemia. A low MPV may indicate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In addition, low MPV may correlate with abnormally small platelet size, sometimes a symptom of a spectrum referred to as Wiskott‚ÄìAldrich syndrome (WAS), caused by a genetic mutation of the WAS gene.

Reuters. 22 March 2006. Before his appointment, Michael Fallon questioned his non-residency at the parliamentary Select committee on Treasury. Blanchflower attended a number of meetings by conference call. During his tenure, he voted in the minority in eighteen of thirty six meetings. He voted to maintain the interest rate in his first nine meetings, but to reduce interest rates in March 2007 and in every meeting from October 2007 through March 2009. Six other members of the MPC have served during Blanchflower's time on the MPC. Blanchflower continually voted for rate cuts. At the September 2008 MPC meeting, Blanchflower distanced himself further from consensus by voting for a 0.5% 'cut' against the other eight members' 'hold'.BBC Bank voted 8‚Äì1 to hold UK rates In the Autumn of 2008, the worldwide economic situation began to deteriorate dramatically, most clearly evidenced by dramatic falls in the values of shares worldwide. On 8 October 2008, the BOE took part in a set of simultaneously announced cuts in the policy rate of a number of major Central Banks. The MPC eventually came around to Blanchflower's view and subsequently lowered rates to levels never before seen in the Bank of England's existence and moved to do unprecedented levels of quantitative easing. In March 2009, it was announced that Blanchflower would be replaced by David Miles at the end of his term, 31 May 2009.The Guardian, 19 March 2009, Miles to replace Blanchflower on Bank of England monetary policy committee  Current work  David Blanchflower is the Bruce V Rauner professor of economics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, part-time professor at the University of Stirling, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a contributing editor for Bloomberg TV.

History The Raffles Lighthouse was first mooted in 1833, but the foundation stone was only laid in 1854 when William John Butterworth was the Governor of the Straits Settlements from 1843 to 1855. The stones on which Raffles Lighthouse stands come from the granite quarries on Pulau Ubin. The lighthouse was named after Sir Stamford Raffles, who founded modern Singapore in 1819. The lighthouse was erected on a rocky island called Pulau Satumu, the southernmost island off the main island of Singapore. Pulau Satumu means \\"one tree island\\" ‚Äì sa refers to satu (\\"one\\") and tumu is the Malay name for the large mangrove tree, Bruguiera confugata. The light source was a wick burner which was replaced in 1905 by a pressurised vapour kerosene mantle burner to increase the light intensity for a greater visible range. A 2nd Order optic was mounted on a roller carriage to allow for smooth rotation. (The Order is a system of classifying the type of lenses used based on the focal length of the lens). This roller carriage was a weight-driven machine which had to be rewound manually to lift the weight whenever it reached the base. The rewinding was done hourly. A crew of seven men was required to man the lighthouse. Raffles Lighthouse is located on Pulau Satumu (indicated by the arrow), south of the main island of Singapore In 1968, the installation of a 4th Order electrically operated revolving optic replaced the original 2nd Order optic with a pressurised vapour kerosene \\"Hood\\" mantle burner. The light source was changed to a 100-volt/1,000-watt incandescent bulb producing 350,000 candelas of light intensity with a visibility range of . The power supply came from one of the three generators installed in a generator room built close to the keeper's room. As the rotation was electrically driven by motors, the crew was reduced to four men. In 1988 the 4th Order optic was replaced by a rotating beacon. This comprised an array of quartz halogen lamps in aluminium parabolic reflectors mounted on a gearless revolving pedestal. The lamps require only one-fifth of the energy required to produce the same intensity as incandescent lamps. These low-power lamps therefore allow solar power to be used in place of generators. In addition, the operation of the light is controlled by a photocell. The manning of the lighthouse was further reduced to two men. The use of solar energy which is freely and readily available has resulted in a reduction of operating and maintenance cost. Present-day lighthouse The present lighthouse equipment consists of a main and standby rotating beacon, each producing 117,000 candelas with a nominal range of . A radar beacon (racon) was also installed at the lighthouse which provides additional navigational information to ships by emitting a Morse code on the ship's radar screen. In 2005, an Aids to Navigation Automatic Identification System (AIS) was installed to broadcast additional positioning information to ships. Coral reef surveys The National Parks Board, National Biodiversity Centre, Blue Water Volunteers and volunteers from the public started a coral reef surveying programme in 2005 to monitor the status of hard corals (Scleractinia), mobile invertebrates and coral reef fish at several locations around five southern islands, including Pulau Satumu on which Raffles Lighthouse is located.

It was written by Don Houghton and stars Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and Stephanie Beacham. Unlike earlier films in Hammer's Dracula series, Dracula A.D. 1972 had (at the time of filming) a contemporary setting, in an attempt to update the Dracula story for modern audiences. Dracula is brought back to life in modern London and preys on a group of young partygoers that includes the descendant of his nemesis, Van Helsing. It is the seventh Hammer film featuring Dracula, and the sixth to star Christopher Lee in the title role. It also marked the return of Peter Cushing as Van Helsing for the first time since The Brides of Dracula (1960), and was the first to feature both Lee and Cushing in their respective roles since Dracula (1958). It was followed by the last film in Hammer's Dracula series to star Christopher Lee, The Satanic Rites of Dracula, which similarly utilized a modern setting and featured most of the same central characters. Storyline In 1872, Count Dracula (Christopher Lee) and his nemesis Lawrence Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) battle on the top of a runaway coach. The carriage crashes and Dracula is partly impaled by one of the wheels. In the struggle, Van Helsing manages to fully push the wheel into the vampire's chest, staking him. This done, Van Helsing collapses and dies from his own wounds. At that moment, a follower of Dracula (Christopher Neame) arrives, collects Dracula's remains and, a few days later, buries them near Van Helsing's grave at St Bartolph's Church. A century later, a new generation of Britons appear who move the tale along: in this case, a group of young hippies that includes Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham), granddaughter of Lorrimer Van Helsing (Peter Cushing), an occult expert and descendant of Dracula's old nemesis, and Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame), who closely resembles the disciple of Dracula seen in 1872. Alucard persuades Jessica and the others to attend a black magic ceremony in the now abandoned, deconsecrated St Bartolph's, where he performs a bloody ritual involving one of their group, Laura Bellows (Caroline Munro). Jessica and the others flee in horror, after which Dracula is resurrected and kills Laura. Laura's body is discovered, drained of blood, and a police investigation begins, headed by Inspector Murray (Michael Coles). Murray suspects an occult element and interviews Lorrimer Van Helsing, who is shocked to learn the details of Laura‚Äôs death. He realises that Johnny Alucard (whose name is Dracula written backwards) is a disciple of Dracula, and that the Count must have returned. In the meantime, Alucard brings another of Jessica‚Äôs friends, Gaynor Keating (Marsha Hunt), to St. Bartolph's, where she is killed by Dracula and Alucard willingly has himself turned into a vampire. The vampiric Alucard kills a passerby and lures Jessica‚Äôs boyfriend, Bob (Philip Miller), to a caf√© they frequent, where he turns him into a vampire as well. While Lorrimer is out, Bob goes to the Van Helsing house and persuades Jessica to come to the caf√©, where he and Alucard capture her and take her to Dracula. Aided by one of Jessica's friends, Lorrimer tracks Alucard to his flat and battles him. Alucard accidentally kills himself with the running water in the bathroom shower. At St Bartolph's, Lorrimer finds Bob's dead body, slain by sunlight before he could reach his resting place, and Jessica in a trance, with Dracula planning to take his revenge on the Van Helsing family by turning her into a vampire. Lorrimer sets a trap for Dracula by placing a pit of stakes underneath the graveyard and waits for him to return at nightfall. The two have a struggle in which Lorrimer attempts to kill Dracula with a silver knife, but the knife is pulled out by Jessica, still under Dracula‚Äôs command. As the pair go outside, Lorrimer throws holy water at Dracula, which burns his hands and causes him to fall into the pit of stakes that Van Helsing had previously prepared. Realising Dracula is still barely alive, Lorrimer uses a shovel to push Dracula into the stakes even further. Dracula dies, his body crumbling into ashes, and his spell over Jessica is broken. As Jessica embraces her grandfather, the title \\"Rest in Final Peace\\" is shown. Continuity The film's opening sequence was not in the previous film, Scars of Dracula (1970), but is completely new and sets up a new short series of the Hammer Horror Dracula chronology finishing in the following film, The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973). This film's prologue takes place in 1872 and therefore is impossible to reconcile with the previous films in the series, the chronology of which starts in 1885 as described in the 1958 original.

Dracula A.D. 1972 began production in September 1971 as Dracula Today and was filmed in Chelsea and Hertfordshire. The film was inspired by the events surrounding the Highgate Vampire case. While the two present-day Dracula films star both Lee and Cushing, they do not correspond to the chronology established in the Victorian/Edwardian-era films; the first Hammer Dracula film, Dracula, is set in the 1880s, whereas the flashback sequence of the last battle between Van Helsing and Dracula in Dracula A.D. 1972 is set in 1872‚Äîlong before the first meeting of Van Helsing and Dracula in the original film. For the Black Mass segment, the film used the track \\"Black Mass: An Electric Storm in Hell\\" by the pioneering electronic group White Noise, from their 1969 album An Electric Storm; Neame's dialogue was later sampled by Orbital for \\"Satan Live\\" and \\"Tension\\". Dracula A.D. 1972 was marketed with the taglines \\"Past, present or future, never count out the Count!\\" and \\"Welcome back, Drac!\\" When it was released in the United States, a brief clip was played before the film in which actor Barry Atwater (the vampire Janos Skorzeny in The Night Stalker) rises from a coffin and swears the entire audience in as members of the Count Dracula Society. Reception Critical reaction to Dracula A.D. 1972 has been mixed to negative. Upon the film's release, Roger Ebert gave the film only 1 star out of 4, while Clyde Jeavons of The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"an abortive and totally unimaginative attempt to update the Bram Stoker legend to present-day Chelsea,\\" adding that \\"the attempt to reconcile Transylvania with S.W.3 merely sends the script haywire ('Close the devil's circle‚Äîdig the music, kids!') ... even that old stand-by, unintentional humour, has been torpedoed by an arch script which insultingly begs for laughs with lines like, 'She's a bit drained,' and 'Come in for a bite.'\\" Dennis Prince of DVD Verdict said, \\"Dracula A.D. 1972 is definitely one of the weakest installments in Hammer's horror catalog and will likely only have strong appeal to Dracula completists.\\" Eccentric Cinema wrote, \\"One can have a fun time with this movie‚Äîmostly because of its faults. It's cheese all right, professionally made cheese that's much better acted and staged than it really has any right to be.\\"DRACULA A.D. 1972 ‚Äì eccentric- cinema.com The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review called the film \\"a major disappointment\\" and \\"the low-point of the whole Hammer Dracula series\\" despite \\"minor positive aspects\\".The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review George R. Reis of DVD Drive-In wrote, \\"Considered a low point in Hammer's roster, Dracula A.D. 1972 is hardly that. ... [T]he film has a number of things going for it. ... Cushing's exceptional Van Helsing pretty much carries the film. ... Christopher Neame is charismatically evil as Johnny Alucard [and] his stirring fight scene with Van Helsing is a highlight. ... How can Hammer fans not like this stuff?\\" In his 2017 book on vampire movies of the 1970s, author Gary A. Smith wrote that looking back on the film, \\"what seemed like a terrible idea back in 1972, really isn't so dire after all. Now, so far removed from its contemporary setting, the swinging London of Dracula A.D. 1972 seems as much a period piece as the Victorian settings of its predecessors. The main problem with the film is that Dracula is confined to the ruins of a Gothic church and never really interacts with the modern world.\\" The film, despite its generally mixed reception, has some prominent admirers and supporters. American film director Tim Burton at one point claimed it to be among his favourite films,https://ew.com/article/2015/06/16/tim-burton-tribute-christopher-lee/ and English author, film critic and horror expert Kim Newman chose it as one of his Top 10 favourite vampire movies.http://www.horrorview.com/kim- newman¬¥s-ten-favourite-vampire-movies In the 2020 BBC/Netflix Dracula miniseries, the third episode is in itself an homage to the film, taking place in present day. It also includes references to it along with many other Hammer Dracula films. Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed by former Manfred Mann member Mike Vickers, and is in a funky, \\"blaxploitation\\" style that reflects the early 1970s setting of the film. It was first released commercially in 2009 on CD. The film also featured two songs, \\"Alligator Man\\" and \\"You Better Come Through for Me\\", by the American band Stoneground (a late replacement for the Faces), which were included as bonus tracks on the CD.https://www.discogs.com/Mike-Vickers-Dracula-AD-1972-Original-Motion- Picture-Soundtrack/release/3440195 *BSX Records (BSXCD 8855) *Release date: 4 May 2009 *Limited edition of 1,500 copies ;Track listing #\\"Warner Bros.

The highway, which is long, starts at an intersection with in Tiger and travels north to the Canada‚ÄìUS border north of Metaline Falls. At the border, SR 31 becomes (BC 6). The route parallels the Pend Oreille River for most of its route and the primary functions of the highway is to serve and connect Tiger, Ione, Metaline and Metaline Falls with British Columbia. Before 1964, the route from Newport to BC 6 was the northernmost section of , which ran from Spokane to BC 6\\\\. Originally created in 1964, SR 31 extended southeast to an intersection with (US 2, formerly ) in Newport. The North Cascades Highway (SR 20) was extended to Newport in 1973 and SR 31 from Newport to Tiger became SR 20\\\\. SR 31 had one auxiliary route, , which became SR 211 after SR 20 was extended. Route description State Route 31 (SR 31) is long within Pend Oreille County, Washington from in Tiger north to (BC 6) at the Canada‚ÄìUS border, located north of Metaline Falls. The highway parallels the Pend Oreille River for most of its route and connects Tiger, Ione, Metaline and Metaline Falls with British Columbia. The route also parallels the Pend Oreille Valley Railroad from Tiger to Metaline Falls; the railroad extends south to Newport along SR 20 and east to Dover, Idaho. SR 31 starts at an intersection with SR 20 and Tiger East Road in the small community of Tiger. The road turns northwest after the intersection and then curves north after intersecting Vogel Road. After crossing the railroad, the highway forms the eastern boundary of Ione Municipal Airport and later passes Sullivan Lake Road. At the Sullivan Lake Road junction, SR 31 is named McKay Road and crosses the Ione Millpond to enter the city of Ione. There, the route is renamed Second Street and leaves the city to parallel the Pend Oreille Valley Railroad and the shoreline of the Pend Oreille River. The name of the road changes to Lehigh Avenue, a name that stays with SR 31 until the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The railroad crosses the road and later bridges the Pend Oreille River, as the highway turns northwest and reverts northeast. The route reaches Metaline and curves southeast to cross the Pend Oreille River on the Pend Oreille Bridge into Metaline Falls. After turning south and back north, the highway starts to curve multiple times until intersecting Sullivan Lake Road and being directed northeast. The road turns north and crosses two streams before curving northwest and then northeast to Lake Lucerene. After passing Lake Lucerene, SR 31 passes Crescent Lake and Boundary Lake before ending at the Canada‚ÄìUS border. SR 31's northern end at the Canada‚ÄìUS border is the easternmost crossing in Washington and is located east of Crawford State Park. History =Pre‚ÄìSR 31 (1923‚Äì1964)= The shield of (1937‚Äì1964) In 1923, a system of roads to connect cities throughout Washington was established. One of the roads, State Road 6, followed a route from Spokane to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. The road was named the Pend O'Reille Highway, a name that would identify the route until 1964. The state road system was later expanded into a new system in 1937. During the creation of the Primary and Secondary Highways in 1937, the road that was State Road 6 became (PSH 6). PSH 6 ran from (US 10) and (future ), north to the Canada‚ÄìUS border; the route was co-signed as US 195 from Spokane to Newport. US 2 was signed over PSH 6 from Spokane to Newport in 1948 and the route became SR 31 from Newport to the Canada‚ÄìUS border during the 1964 highway renumbering. During the renumbering, WSDOT replaced the previous system of Primary and Secondary Highways with a new system called State Routes, which is still in use today. =SR 31: Newport‚ÄìBC 6 (1964‚Äì1973)= SR 31's route from 1964 until 1973 SR 31's previous route ran a total of from Newport northwest to Tiger and north to the Canada‚ÄìUS border at . The route started in Newport at the intersection of W. Walnut Street (SR 31 northbound and US 2 eastbound) and N. Union Avenue (US 2 westbound). Next, the highway went northwest and left Newport to parallel the Pend Oreille River for the rest of its route. The road would also join the Pend Oreille Valley Railroad north to the current southern terminus. SR 31 turned west and passed Lake Newport State Park, located on the shores of the river, before curving northwest and entering the community of Dilkena. From Dilkena, the road goes north to pass SR 311's northern terminus in Usk and pass the towns of Cusick, Locke and Jared. The highway turned east at Jared and back northwest at Ruby. After Blue Slide and Lost Creek, SR 31 would continue north out of Tiger, which was the eastern terminus of . SR 31 from Newport to Tiger later became SR 20 after it was extended on SR 294 and SR 31 in 1973. SR 311 (1964‚Äì1973) Former SR 311's shield that identifies the route. From 1964 until 1973, SR 31 had an auxiliary route called State Route 311\\\\. The highway ran from US 2 west of Newport, north to SR 31 in Usk. The road was entirely located within Pend Oreille County; the southern terminus was located east of Pend Oreille State Park on US 2 and west of Diamond Lake and the community of the same name. SR 311 advanced north past Sacheen Lake and Davis Lake to the northern terminus, which was south of Cusick. SR 311 was established as in 1937 during the creation of the primary and secondary highway system. In the 1964 renumbering, SR 311 was created over SSH 6B. When SR 20 was extended over SR 294 and SR 31, SR 311 became , which it is still currently designated as.

Kannel () is an Estonian plucked string instrument (chordophone) belonging to the Baltic box zither family known as the Baltic psaltery along with Finnish kantele, Latvian kokles, Lithuanian kanklƒós, and Russian gusli. The Estonian kannel has a variety of traditional tunings. In Estonia, studying the kannel has made a resurgence after some years of decline.Postimees: P√§rimusmuusika ait l√∂√∂b uksed valla (in Estonian) Etymology  According to Finnish linguist Eino Nieminen, the name of the instrument, along with the names of most of its neighbouring counterparts (Finnish kantele, Livonian kƒÅndla, Latvian kokles and Lithuanian kanklƒós), possibly comes from the proto-Baltic form *kantlƒ´s/*kantlƒìs, which originally meant 'the singing tree', ultimately deriving from the Proto-European root *kan- ('to sing, to sound'). However, Lithuanian ethnologist Romualdas Apanaviƒçius believes kokles could be derived from the Proto-European root *gan(dh)-, meaning 'a vessel; a haft (of a sword)', suggesting that it may be related to the Russian word gusli.Romualdas Apanaviƒçius. Ancient Lithuanian Kanklƒós, Institute of Ethnomusic, Vilnius, Lithuania History A kannel player in J√§rvep√§√§, Setomaa, Estonia ca. 1912. The kannel became rare in the early 20th century, though surviving in some parts of the Estonian diaspora, until cultural movements under the Soviets encouraged the development and playing of larger chromatic kannels. However, influence from neighboring traditional Finnish kantele players supported the playing of the traditional smaller kannels. Social role The kannel serves as a national symbol of Estonia; Jakob Hurt's 1875-1876 publication of Estonian folksongs was even entitled Vana Kannel (\\"The Old Kannel\\"). The kannel was legendarily played by the Estonian god of song Vanemuine, and the Estonian national epic Kalevipoeg (published in the 1850s) begins with the line: Laena mulle kannelt, Vanemuine!

First developed by Texas Instruments, and later produced by Raytheon when the latter purchased the radar business of the former. AN/APN-149 This is the first terrain-following radar for use on manned aircraft, designed by Bert Bechtel, a former Navy engineer, who had designed a radar scan template control technique that permitted safe aircraft descent in adverse weather. The concept was the basis of winning a $750,000 US Army contract to develop a radar system to automatically guide a drone aircraft. The US Army did not pursue the project to production, but the US Air Force became interested and believed that Bechtel's innovation would protect the low-flying planes. AN/APN-165 Terrain-following/ground-mapping radar by Texas Instruments for OV-1 Mohawk AN/APQ-89 TFR tested on T-2 Buckeye for pilots to familiarize TFR operation on other combat aircraft. AN/APQ-99 Developed by TI as a multi-modes radar, in addition to terrain avoidance and terrain-following modes, and AN/APQ-99 can also be used for ground mapping. Smaller in size then the Westinghouse AN/APQ-72 and fitted in the nose of for A-7A, RF-4B/C. AN/APQ-99 is also supplied to Germany, Iran and Japan. AN/APQ-101 Terrain-following radar by Texas Instruments. AN/APQ-110 Ku band terrain-following radar by Texas Instruments for General Dynamics F-111A and RF-4C. It replaced the side-looking mapping radar by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company on RF-4C. AN/APQ-115 Improved AN/APQ-110 terrain-following radar by Texas Instruments for the A-7A, General Dynamics F-111, RF-4C, and C-130E. AN/APQ-115 has a single contoured, spoiled parabola antenna, with a search cone of 5 degrees wide, spanning from +7 degrees above to -18 degrees below to the boresight of the aircraft. AN/APQ-115 suffered from inaccurate references (poor stabilization and Doppler inputs), which directly lead to the development of more advanced system such as AN/APQ-122. The Texas Instruments I-band AN/APQ-116 is a TFR used in A-7 Corsair II and C-130 Hercules aircraft. AN/APQ-116 was basically the integration of previously independent AN/APQ-115 TFR into the ILAAS digital navigation system. The radar also fed a digital weapons computer which made possible accurate delivery of bombs from a greater stand-off distance, greatly improving survivability compared with faster platforms such as the F-4 Phantom II. AN/APQ-122 X band multi-mode radar by Texas Instruments for C-130 Hercules, Boeing RC-135, Boeing T-43 and Boeing E-4. AN/APQ-122 has a slotted planar array antenna with a separate X-band receiver used to generate MRI video, with a search cone of 7.5 degrees wide, spanning from +8 degrees above to -17 degrees below to the boresight of the aircraft. For AN/APQ-122(V)B, the stabilization reference could either be manually or automatically switched to MD-1 gyro if the LN-15J inertial navigational system become unreliable or inoperable, thus terrain following operation can still continue, where in earlier system such as AN/APQ-115, if the Doppler fails, the terrain following operation would be discontinued.

AN/APQ-158 Improvement of AN/APQ-126 with 15 line replaceable units for the MH-53 Pave Low helicopter and PAVE LOW III requirement. Designed to perform terrain following mode/function in high clutter area such as in cities. AN/APQ-162 Development of AN/APQ-99 for RF-4C, incorporating experience gained from AN/APQ-116 and other radars in the family. AN/APQ-168 multi-mode radar by Texas Instruments for HH-60D & MH-60K. Increased jamming resistance, improved weather penetration, better guidance in turn flight, and better power management function in semi-covert mission. The radar can operate in terrain- clearance, terrain-avoidance, air-to-air ranging and cross-scan modes, the latter combining ground-mapping or terrain-avoidance with terrain-following. A terrain storage facility permits the radar to have a reduced duty cycle, thereby reducing the probability of detection by enemy ESM equipment. There's also the incorporation of built-in test (BITE) provides a high degree of fault isolation and detection. AN/APQ-171 Improved AN/APG-146 terrain-following radar by Texas Instruments for F-111C/F, developed by Texas Instruments in the mid- eighties with the objective of replacing the four different TFR models used across the USAF F-111 fleet with a single type.

Development It was commissioned by The Coca- Cola Company to be handed out to 125 executives at their 1983 sales convention with an Atari 2600 console. It was developed by Atari, Inc. as a modification of the original Space Invaders cartridge. The game was packaged in a black cartridge without a label. Due to the original Space Invaders Atari 2600 developer Rick Maurer leaving Atari over payment issues, Atari tasked designer Christopher Omarzu with hacking the original. The intent was to boost the morale of Coca-Cola's employees, but most of the cartridges were discarded by their recipients. Pepsi Invaders has been mistakenly labelled Coke Wins and Coke Invaders, to the confusion of Omarzu. Legacy Writer Matthew S.

Accessed February 22, 2008. He was taken in the second round of the 1972 NFL Draft out of Penn State University by the Colts (48th overall). Mitchell was a teammate of Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris of the Pittsburgh Steelers while at Penn State, and many actually thought the Steelers were going to draft Mitchell instead of Harris before the draft. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2004. Mitchell established himself in the mid-1970s as one of the best all-around running backs in the NFL. Mitchell, along with teammate Bert Jones, propelled the Baltimore Colts to three consecutive AFC East Division titles, unseating a powerhouse Miami Dolphins team that had topped the division for four straight years (1971‚Äì74). Mitchell topped the 1,000-yard rushing plateau in three consecutive seasons (1975‚Äì77) earning Pro Bowl honors each year. In addition to his rushing exploits, he twice led the NFL in pass receptions, in 1974 and 1977. Mitchell was named 2nd Team All-Pro in 1976 and 1977 as well as being named 2nd Team All-AFC following the 1975 campaign. After his successful run in Baltimore, Mitchell was dealt to the San Diego Chargers after the 1977 season. Mitchell turned in a solid season in 1978 with the Dan Fouts-led Chargers and finished his career in 1980 appearing in two games with the Los Angeles Rams.

It is named for Pollux, the twin of Castor on the grounds that it is often found associated with petalite (previously known as castorite). The high caesium content was missed by the first analysis by Karl Friedrich Plattner in 1848, but after the discovery of caesium in 1860 a second analysis in 1864 was able to show the high caesium content of pollucite. Its typical occurrence is in lithium-rich granite pegmatites in association with quartz, spodumene, petalite, amblygonite, lepidolite, elbaite, cassiterite, columbite, apatite, eucryptite, muscovite, albite and microcline.

Classified as E 66 and nicknamed Pearson's Dream after its designer, it was an experimental Mallet locomotive designed to work on the Rimutaka Incline. The \\"E\\" classification was previously used by the Double Fairlie E class of 1872-75, but the classification was free as they had all been withdrawn by the time E 66 entered service. After the withdrawal of E 66, \\"E\\" was again re-used on the battery-electric E class of 1922.  Origin and design  The Rimutaka Incline opened in 1878, connecting Wellington with the Wairarapa region, and with the completion of the Wairarapa Line in December 1897, it provided NZR's main link to the north as the west coast route was then privately owned by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR). Six special Fell locomotives, the H class, worked the Incline, but after 1897, traffic increases necessitated additional motive power. Initially, two members of the B class were converted from tender locomotives into tank locomotives and reclassified as the WE class; W 192 was also transferred to assist on the Incline. These locomotives proved to be more expensive to operate and used more fuel than the H class.W. N. Cameron, Rimutaka Incline: Extracts from \\"A Line of Railway\\" (Wellington: New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society, 1992), 83. However, they were considered successful enough by the Chief Mechanical Engineer A. L. Beattie that he authorised his Chief Draughtsman, G. A. Pearson, to design another, more powerful locomotive to work the Incline. To meet Beattie's requirements, Pearson designed E 66 as a Mallet articulated locomotive with a wheel arrangement of 2-6-6-0T under the Whyte notation system. Its cylinders were placed at each end instead of one wheelset behind the other allowing one set to be driving forward at all times. It was a Vauclain compound, re-using materials left over from an unsuccessful experiment in the 1890s on N 27. This compounding encouraged the use of a then remarkably high boiler pressure, 200 psi, which in turn caused the use of a corrugated furnace for strength. This also provided a clear space below the boiler, allowing room for the rear power bogie. The restricted grate area of such a furnace though may have been the cause of some of the steaming problems. The locomotive also used other surplus materials, such as modified F class wheels. The locomotive was built at the Petone Railway Workshops in the Hutt Valley under Pearson's direct supervision and entered service on 23 February 1906.  Rimutaka Incline service  E class locomotive E 66 at the Petone Railway Workshops In a trial between Upper Hutt railway station and Summit railway station, the non-Incline portion of the route over the Rimutaka Range, E 66 successfully hauled forty-five wagons up the 1 in 35 grade. This was the equivalent of a load that would have required two WF class locomotives. The locomotive soon began work on the Incline as intended and was based at Cross Creek railway station at the foot of the Incline. It was rated to haul up to 80 tons on the Incline, 15 tons higher than the maximum permitted of the H class, and in a trial it successfully hauled 103 tons from Cross Creek up to Summit. However, it was much more costly to operate than the H class and thus ran only two-thirds the annual mileage of the H locomotives. E 66 consumed 167 pounds of coal per mile, while an H class used 117 pounds, and its operating cost was 54.10 pence per mile compared to 37.73 pence for an H. Furthermore, E 66's crews complained of excessive heat in the cab, especially through tunnels, and firemen had to wear heat-resistant asbestos pants due to the excessive heat.  Transfer and withdrawal  In December 1908, the WMR was purchased by NZR and its Wellington - Manawatu Line was incorporated into the national network as part of the North Island Main Trunk Railway (NIMT). Most traffic from beyond the Wairarapa was re-routed via the old WMR route as it was quicker and did not include the time-consuming Incline. Accordingly, by 1909, traffic over the Incline was in decline and primarily served the Wairarapa. The traffic volumes thus became manageable for the H locomotives alone, and E 66 was transferred from Cross Creek to Wellington despite its moderate success on the Incline. The NIMT contained a steeply graded section between Wellington and Johnsonville (now truncated as the Johnsonville Branch due to the Tawa Flat deviation) and E 66 was used to bank trains over this route. However, it had not been designed for this work and became unpopular with crews. Due to these problems, it did not meet the designer's ambitions and thus acquired the \\"Pearson's Dream\\" nickname. Due to its unpopularity in Wellington and increasing tonnages over the Incline due to World War I, E 66 was transferred back to Cross Creek in 1916. However, it was only in steam 23 days that year, sometimes for works trains rather than revenue service, and operated over a distance of just 478 miles. In May 1917, it was withdrawn from service, stored, and then dismantled. Its boiler was transferred to Auckland for use as a depot wash-out boiler and used in this capacity until 1931 when it was condemned and dumped. The locomotive thus did not survive to be preserved.

As the two girls become romantically involved, their taboo relationship causes them to be marginalized by the other students. Unable to cope with the social pressures of having a lover of the same gender, Shi-Eun tries to distance herself from the increasingly dependent Hyo-shin. Hyo-shin reacts poorly to Shi-eun's changed attitude, viewing it as both a betrayal and rejection. Hyo-shin consequently commits suicide by jumping off of the school roof. It is also heavily implied that she was pregnant at the time of death, the father being literature teacher Mr. Goh. The plot unfurls in a nonlinear fashion, often from the perspective of fellow student Soh Min-ah (Kim Min-sun). Min-ah grows increasingly invested in Shi-eun and Hyo-shin when she finds a diary kept between the two alienated girls. This diary allows her disturbing insights to the nature of the relationship and pulls her deeper into a strange chain of events around the school. After Hyo-shin's death, supernatural occurrences start to terrorize all of the students that condemned the relationship. It is later revealed that Hyo-shin's spirit is malevolently haunting the school through the remnants she left behind in the diary.

Despite the increasing visibility of the Korean LGBT movement in the 1990s, when Memento Mori was made, queer films of the time frequently concealed LGBT content behind the guise of other genres, such as horror or romance. The elements of horror featured in Memento Mori, which include telepathy and possession, function as a method of creating distance between the audience's reality and the fantasy of the horror movie, and the characters therein. The representation of queer characters within a horror context is further aided by Korea's LGBT history. Despite being tolerated throughout most of Korean history, Neo-Confucianism, which came into prominence during the Chos≈èn dynasty, eliminated acceptance towards same-sex behavior and ‚Äúeffectively made homosexuality invisible, ghostly.‚Äù Despite the societal implication of queer people as inherently ghostly, the film does not treat its LGBT characters as the archetypal monsters, representative of societal taboos, as in the Western horror tradition. Rather, Memento Mori‚Äôs queer characters are the heroes the story is centered around, and the ghostly terror is directed at the film‚Äôs homophobic characters. In creating a uniquely Korean canon of the horror genre, Korean horror films have not imported Western-style monsters or slashers; they instead center on a ghost, most often a female ghost. Within the tradition of Korean horror cinema, the female spirit exists to get revenge on their murderers. The ghosts of early horror films typically have ‚Äúlived a life of repression in a patriarchal family,‚Äù and it is within the context of these heterosexual relationships that most traditional Korean horror film ghosts seek their revenge. However, the horror cycle starting with Whispering Corridors shifts the focal relationship from familial relationships to friendships, particularly those between school aged girls. The more contemporary version of the Korean ghost story, featuring the ghost of a schoolgirl, is ideal representation for girls, who are taught to internalize their problems. The current education system in South Korea is frequently gender segregated in both middle school and high school, emphasizing distinctive gender norms and attempting to curb sexuality. Lingering Confucian influences play a large role in gender segregated schools, which in turn lead to normalized ‚Äúhomosocial bodily contact‚Äù and significant relationships between students of the same gender. This normalized intimacy between schoolgirls makes the jump from the homosocial to the queer relationship of Hyo-shin and Shi-eun plausible to the audience. However, this context of highly interdependent, exclusive female friendships, which become necessary for survival in the highly competitive environment of Korean high schools, may soften the LGBT themes in Memento Mori as a result of such close relationships being accepted as a ‚Äúright of passage‚Äù.

Abramoff and his wife gave $10,000 to the Bush-Cheney Recount Fund, shortly before Abramoff joined Greenberg Traurig, which forgave over $314,000 in legal fees incurred by the Bush Campaign in the 2000 Florida election recount.\\"Bush Florida 2000 recount committee still owes lobbyist's former firm $314k\\", therawstory, Accessed on March 15, 2006. Of the approximately $85 million in tribal money entrusted to Abramoff, his employers, or his related organizations (see Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal for more), over $4.4 million since 1999 were directed to at least 250 members of Congress, primarily Republicans in leadership positions or on relevant committees, and Democrats with standing connections to Native American interests (in a 2:1 GOP ratio). These contributions have since become tainted by their association with Abramoff's criminal behavior. Abramoff was associated with Tom DeLay's and Grover Norquist's K Street Project to bring Republican dominance to Washington lobbying.Balz, Dan and Bimbaum, Jeffrey H. (Staff Writers) Case Bringing New Scrutiny To a System and a Profession, The Washington Post, January 4, 2006. Skyboxes and St. Andrews Through the front company Sports Suites LLC, Abramoff owned skyboxes at MCI Center and Camden Yards, and two at FedExField. Between 1999 and 2003, Abramoff hosted 72 events for members of Congress, all but eight for Republicans. On May 7, 2000, while Abramoff was actively lobbying against the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act in the House of Representatives, Tom DeLay attended a performance by the Three Tenors in a skybox at Washington's MCI Center. Several major donors to DeLay's Texans for a Republican Majority PAC were also invited. It was later revealed that the skybox was leased and paid for by Jack Abramoff, at an estimated cost of $3,600‚Äì7,500. Although Federal law at the time did not require disclosure or reimbursement of this sort of gift-giving from a lobbyist to a PAC, the law was changed several months later, and the incident was cited in later criticisms of DeLay's acceptance of gifts. On May 25, DeLay departed on a 10-day trip to Scotland together with Abramoff and DeLay's aides Tony Rudy and Susan Hirschmann. In documents filed after the trip as required by House rules, DeLay claimed that the purpose of the trip was primarily \\"educational\\", to hold meetings with Conservative leaders in Britain, including former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and that the total cost of the trip was $28,106. The filings indicated that the trip was being paid for by the \\"National Center for Public Policy Research\\", a think tank then chaired by Jack Abramoff. On the same date as DeLay's trip departure, Abramoff clients eLottery and the Mississippi Choctaw sent checks totaling $50,000 to the National Center for Public Policy Research. eLottery and the tribe both later claimed that they were unaware that the money was intended to pay for a trip. Details later emerged that many parts of the trip were paid for directly on Abramoff's credit card, and a card belonging to Edwin A. Buckham, another prominent lobbyist. Although the trip did include a meeting with Margaret Thatcher, according to detailed bills leaked to the Washington Post, the trip also included golf at the exclusive St. Andrews Golf Resort, theater tickets, and \\"superior\\" room accommodations at the London Four Seasons. The total cost of the trip was estimated at $70,000‚Äì120,000, of which approximately $12,000 was reimbursed to Abramoff by Preston Gates. The length of the trip, expense, source of funding, and activities of the trip are significant as House ethics rules at the time prevented representatives from accepting gifts from private parties if it would \\"create the appearance of using public office for private gain.\\"  Justice Department investigation  These actions by Abramoff ignited an investigation by the Justice Department to examine widespread claims and allegations of corruption of law-makers connected with Jack Abramoff. The allegations of corruption were later shown to be true, and resulted in a politician (Rep. Bob Ney, (R-OH)) getting convicted for accepting bribes from Abramoff. Abramoff also plead guilty to tax fraud and bribery of public officials in January 2006.  Politicians who have received direct contributions from Abramoff  FEC records show that Abramoff gave $172,933 for Republican candidates, $88,985 to Republican causes and nothing to Democratic candidates or organizations. A compilation of the complete FEC record and its analysis of contributions made by Jack Abramoff, only, independently confirmed the latter claim. Some of the most prominent who have received such contributions and who may have other connections to Abramoff include: ;President George W Bush (R) As a Bush Pioneer, Abramoff raised over $100,000 for the George W. Bush reelection campaign in addition to the $6,000 which he personally contributed. Although the White House insists President Bush never met Jack Abramoff outside of large gatherings, The Texas Observer reports that in May 2001 Abramoff \\"charged two of his clients $25,000 for a White House lunch date and a meeting with the President.\\" Time Magazine also reports having at least five White House publicity photos, or 'clicks' showing Bush together with Abramoff or Abramoff's family members. ;U.S. Rep. & Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX) Joining Abramoff on a vacation was Tom DeLay, whose airfare to London and Scotland in 2000 was charged to an American Express card issued to Abramoff, according to two sources who know Abramoff's credit card account number and to a copy of a travel invoice displaying that number. DeLay's expenses during the same trip for food, phone calls and other items at a golf course hotel in Scotland were billed to a different credit card also used on the trip by a second registered Washington lobbyist, Edwin A. Buckham, according to receipts documenting that portion of the trip. ;U.S. Rep. & Former Chairman of the House Administration Committee Bob Ney (R-OH) Bob Ney also guiltyIn 2002, after Abramoff and Reed closed the casino of the Tigua tribe, Abramoff persuaded the tribe to hire him to lobby Congress to reopen the casino. After Abramoff met with Bob Ney to ask him to push the legislation, the Tigua (by overnight mail) sent three checks to Ney's political committees, totaling $32,000. The exchange of campaign contributions in return for Ney's support of an amendment to reopen the Tigua's casino constituted bribery. Emails between Abramoff and the Tigua's political consultant show that Ney solicited the Tigua to pay for part of a 2002 golf trip to Scotland, knowing full well that solicitation of travel is specifically prohibited by House rules. Shortly after Ney returned from Scotland, he was scheduled to meet with members of the Tigua tribal council. Prior to that meeting, Abramoff reminded the Tigua that \\"for obvious reasons\\" the golf trip would not be mentioned at the meeting, but that Ney show his appreciation \\"in other ways\\", which was, Abramoff pointed out, just what the tribe wanted. Although the tribe never ended up paying for the golf trip, Ney's attempt to tie the gift of the trip to the legislative assistance the tribe was seeking likely violates federal criminal law. Ney lied when he said he was \\"duped\\" by Abramoff and lied again on financial disclosure forms when he said that a nonprofit had paid for the trip. However, Safavian, in an email to his government employer seeking permission to go on the trip, states that Abramoff personally extended invitations to all the guests. Ney also said he made the trip to speak to Scottish parliamentarians. But the Scottish parliament wasn't in session at the time he was in Scotland. Ney is also implicated in the separate Abramoff SunCruz scandal. Bob Ney is now setting up a legal defense fund for Abramoff. Bob Ney was \\"Representative #1,\\" in Abramoff's January 3 plea agreement. On September 15, 2006 Ney's guilty plea for bribery related to Abramoff's clients and others was submitted to the court and made public. ;U.S. Rep. Heather Wilson, CD1 (R-NM) Congresswoman Heather Wilson received $1,000 in a direct contribution from Abramoff. ;U.S. Rep. Tom Feeney, III (R-FL); Congressman Tom Feeney (R-FL) joined other Republicans on the now infamous golf trip to Scotland with Abramoff in 2003. ;U.S. Rep. Richard Pombo (R-CA) In 2003, Abramoff gave Richard Pombo's (R-CA) PAC $5,000. Abramoff also gave $2,000, the maximum allowed, to Pombo's congressional campaign committee that same year. On January 8, 2006, the Los Angeles Times reported that \\"Pombo helped one of Abramoff's clients, the Mashpee Indians in Massachusetts, gain official recognition as a tribe; the congressman received contributions from the lobbyist and the tribe in that instance.\\" ;U.S. Rep. Mike Ferguson (R-NJ) New Jersey Republican Rep. Mike Ferguson is not going to give back the $1,000 he received in 2001, according to his spokeswoman Abby Bird. ;U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-NJ) New Jersey Republican Rep. Frank LoBiondo has planned or has given back the $1000 contribution he had received in 2001. ;U.S. Rep. Jim Saxton (R-NJ) New Jersey Republican Rep. Jim Saxton has given back the 1000-dollar contribution he had received from Abramoff. ;U.S. Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) Conrad Burns (R-Montana) is an alleged recipient of illegal favors and $136,000 in campaign contributions from Abramoff. As the chair of the Interior Subcommittee on Appropriations, Burns received over $136,000 in campaign contributions through Abramoff and then directed $3 million to the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe of Michigan, an Abramoff client and one of the wealthiest tribes in the country from a program intended to help the neediest tribes fix dilapidated schools. After initially claiming credit for the appropriation, Burns subsequently denied knowledge of it. \\"A lot of things happened that I didn't know about. It shouldn't have happened, but it did.\\" Although initially refusing to return Abramoff's donations, Burns ultimately said that he would return or give away $150,000 he received from Abramoff and his clients. In December, 2005, a leader of a tribe which gave $22,000 in campaign contributions to Burns in 2002 stated that they had done so solely at the request of Abramoff and believed the senator was part of \\"Abramoff's group\\". ;U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) (R-Texas) On November 12, 2001, Reed sent Abramoff an e-mail stating, \\"get me details so I can alert cornyn and let him know what we are doing to help him\\" [sic]. Similarly, on November 13, Reed wrote \\"I strongly suggest we start doing patch-throughs to perry and cornyn [sic]. We're getting killed on the phone.\\" Also, on January 7, 2002, Reed sent Abramoff an e-mail stating \\"I think we should budget for an ataboy for cornyn\\" [sic]. When Cornyn ran for Senate, Abramoff contributed $1,000, the maximum amount legally allowed. Cornyn, who has spoken out against gambling, also received $6,250 in contributions from Las Vegas casino interests who oppose Indian gaming, some of which were made at the same time Cornyn was pushing to close the Tigua's casino. ;New Jersey State Senator William Gormley (R-Atlantic, NJ) New Jersey State Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, got $1,000 from Abramoff when Gormley was running for the U.S. Senate in 2000. Abramoff also gave $5,000 to the New Jersey Republican State Committee. New Jersey Democratic Party Chairwoman Bonnie Watson Coleman hopes this money will be returned to Abramoff. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Abramoff has contributed more than $220,000 in New Jersey since 1995, almost exclusively to Republican candidates and committees and only a \\"smattering\\" of those who received donations from Abramoff have returned them. ;U.S. Senator Jim Talent (R-MO) ;U.S. Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA) In 2000, Abramoff gave $500 to Ed Royce.  Politicians with connections to Indian affairs and Greenberg Traurig  ;U.S. Rep. J.D.Hayworth (R-AZ) Rep.J.D. Hayworth the largest single recipient of Abramoff related money and co-chairman of the Congressional Native American Caucus, has received more than $150,000 from Indian tribes once represented by Abramoff. ;U.S. Senator David Vitter (R-LA) The Louisiana Jena Band of Choctaws offered testimony accusing Louisiana Senator David Vitter (R) of being in cahoots with Abramoff and his attempts to stymie the tribe's casino plans. ;U.S. Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, one of several committees investigating the scandal. From 2001 to 2004, Grassley received over $62,000 in donations from groups related to the scandal. In March 2002 he sent a letter to Secretary of the Interior Gale Norton opposing the Jena casino. In April he received a donation of $1000 from Abramoff's firm. ;U.S. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) Between 2001 and 2004 Sen. Harry Reid received $61,000 from donors with whom after the fact had hired Abramoff later on, Reid's office confirmed, and has decided not to return any donations. In a February 9, 2006 Washington Post article, Reid's office acknowledged contacts with Greenberg Traurig during this time. Reid also intervened on government matters in ways that Abramoff's tribal clients might have deemed helpful, once opposing legislation on the Senate floor and four times sending letters pressing the Bush administration on tribal issues. Reid collected donations around the time of each action. Reid's office said none of the senator's actions were affected by donations or done for Abramoff. Reid sent a letter they wrote on March 5, 2002, to Interior Secretary Gale Norton asking her to reject an application from the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, which was seeking to open a casino outside its Louisiana reservation. An Abramoff client fighting the Jena casino, the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, donated $5,000 to Reid's political action committee, the Searchlight Leadership Fund, the next day, at Abramoff's request. While Abramoff never donated directly to Reid, the lobbyist did instruct the tribe to send $5,000 to the fund. The Washington Post reported that Abramoff sent a list to the tribe titled \\"Coushatta Requests\\" recommending donations to campaigns or groups for 50 lawmakers. Alongside Reid's name, Abramoff wrote, \\"5,000 (Searchlight Leadership Fund) Senate Majority Whip.\\" Reid was Democratic whip at the time. About the same time, Reid sent a letter to the Interior Department helpful to the tribe, records show. His March 5, 2002, letter pressed the agency to reject a casino proposed by a potential rival to the Coushattas, the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians. Sen. John Ensign (R-Nev.) also signed the letter. Future Abramoff coworker Edward Ayoob before he knew Abramoff worked for Reid from June 1997 to March 2002 variously as legislative counsel, tax counsel, appropriations manager, foreign affairs adviser and chief aide on judicial nominations, according to a biography on his employer's Web site. Ayoob in 2002 was hired as a lobbyist by Greenberg Traurig LLP, where his work included teaming with Abramoff and other lobbyists on client matters. According to the Greenberg Traurig website, Greenberg Traurig has over 1400 lobbyists. Abramoff left Greenberg Traurig in March 2004 after the Senate and the FBI began investigating his activities while Ayoob left Greenberg Traurig in spring 2005. Ayoob is now a senior lobbyist at Barnes & Thornburg LLP. Reid downplayed Ayoob's role, saying Ayoob was a legislative assistant on his staff and not an adviser. Ayoob and Reid met \\"from time to time\\" after Ayoob became a lobbyist, according to a Reid spokesperson. She said she did not know when they last spoke or how Reid would characterize their relationship today. The Washington Post has reported that the aide later helped throw a fundraiser for Reid at Abramoff's firm that raised money from several of Abramoff's lobbying partners. ;U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) Senator Byron Dorgan, the senior Democrat on the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, had received at least $79,300 from associates and clients who later hired Abramoff to work for them. After several news articles appeared detailing the tribal donations, Dorgan wrote a news release replying to several claims he said were erroneous, including the allegation he received money directly from Abramoff. In the release, Dorgan said, \\"The fact is I have never met Abramoff and have never received a campaign contribution from him. If he was directing any of his clients to make a political contribution to me, it was done without my knowledge.\\" Dorgan says, in the release, that his activities in support of several tribal programs are continuing his trend of supporting Native American issues since being elected, and do not stem from Abramoff-related campaign contributions. In December 2005, Dorgan returned tribal donations totaling $67,000. ;U.S. Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) According to the FEC, Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) failed to account properly for two fundraisers he held in Abramoff's skybox at Washington's MCI Center in 2002 and 2003, according to filings with the FEC and the Iowa Democrat's spokeswoman. Campaign contributions returned or donated Many politicians have returned or donated all or part of the money received from Abramoff or his clients though only two lawmakers have given some of this money back to Native Americans. According to CBS, over 100 lawmakers have donated Abramoff related money to charity. It is not yet clear if donating the money will give them tax advantages in a way that returning the money would not or if these charities have a history of donating money or aiding favorable lawmakers in other ways. ;President George W. Bush (R) On January 4, 2005 President George W. Bush announced that his campaign will donate $6000 to the American Heart Association. The $6000 is the sum of the donations by Abramoff, Abramoff's wife, and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan. The more than $100,000 in Bush Pioneer money raised by Abramoff, but not directly contributed by Abramoff will not be returned. ;Republican Governors Association On January 12, 2006, The Boston Globe reported paraphrased Massachusetts Governor, Mitt Romney, saying that \\"the Republican Governors Association would donate to charity $500,000 in contributions it received from a donor entwined in the Abramoff investigation.\\" ;U.S. Rep. J.D.Hayworth (R-AZ) Rep.J.D. Hayworth, the largest single recipient of Abramoff related money and co-chairman of the Congressional Native American Caucus, has received more than $150,000 from Indian tribes once represented by Abramoff. Hayworth has said he will keep these donations because they were given independently of Abramoff's influence. He donated to charity $2,250 he got directly from Abramoff. The charity's name is unavailable, but was claimed to be related to Hurricane Katrina relief. ;U.S. Senator Mel Martinez (R-FL) Returned $2,500 contribution he received from Bob Ney. He has so far refused to return a quarter million dollars raised at a fundraiser co-chaired by Abramoff. ;U.S. Senator Jim Talent (R-MO) On October 26, Sen.

Conrad Burns, the fourth largest recipient of Abramoff related money, some $60,000, announced that he would return or donate $150,000 he received from Abramoff and his clients. Via his spokesman he had previously claimed that the money could not be returned as the committee that received it was shut down and the money was \\"already spent\\". Burns attempt to make a $111,000 \\"donation\\" to the Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council was rejected by the tribe who said the money was tainted because it originally came from Abramoff and his clients. Julia Doney, president of the Fort Belknap Indian Community Council, and a member of the tribal leaders council, explained that the tribes are \\"tired of being used\\" and don't want help Burns with his political troubles. \\"it's tainted money\\" said Doney The Blackfeet Community College has also refused to accept money Burns because it came from Jack Abramoff. James St. Goddard, a Blackfeet council member, told The Great Falls Tribune that taking the money \\"would have made it look like the money is clean. We do not want Mr. Burns to use the tribes any more for his political gain.\\" ;U.S. Rep. Dennis Rehberg (R-MT) Rep. Dennis Rehberg returned $20,000. ;U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan (D-ND) On December 13, 2005 Sen. Byron Dorgan reported that he would return $67,000 in questionable donations from Abramoff's clients (the entirety of his \\"Abramoff-related money\\"). Dorgan was quoted as saying he would not \\"knowingly keep even one dollar in contributions if there is even a remote possibility that they could have been the result of any action Mr. Abramoff might have taken.\\" ;U.S. Rep.

Plot 60 years ago, a doll-maker and a woman in a red kimono (Jeong Yu- mi) fell in love in the Korean countryside, and the doll-maker made a doll in her image. Later, when the red kimono woman was found murdered, the blame was put on the doll-maker. He was arrested and killed by vigilantes in the woods. Not content to be without her maker, the doll sat by his grave for all eternity. In present day, Hae-mi (Kim Yoo-mi), a sculptor, Tae-seong (Shim Hyung-tak), a model looking for work, Young-ha (Ok Ji-young), a woman who talks to her doll like it's alive, Jung-ki (Im Hyung-joon), a photographer, and Sun-young (Lee Ka-yeong), a ditzy high school student, arrive at an isolated doll museum after receiving an invitation that dolls will be made in their image. They are greeted by siblings Choi Jin-wan (Chun Ho-jin), the museum‚Äôs curator, and Im Jae-won (Kim Do-young), the paraplegic doll-maker. Then, odd events begin to occur. Hae-mi catches sight of a mysterious young girl in a red dress who shows up repeatedly on the museum grounds. Tae-seong has an encounter with a doll that touches him, and it is revealed that the curator is keeping a man chained underground. Hae-mi finally meets the red- dress girl, learning that her real name is Mi-na (Lim Eun-kyung). Things take a nasty turn when someone destroys Young-ha's doll; Young-ha is found hanged. Panic arises in the group. Hae-mi is alarmed to find a crying Mi-na with bloody hands. Mi-na asks Hae-mi why she doesn't recognize or remember her, before fleeing in tears. Inside the house, Sun-young and Jung-ki are both murdered. Hae-mi finally remembers that when she was younger, she had a doll that she loved so much that it gained a soul, resulting in Mi-na. Tae-seong reveals himself to be a police officer who had come to investigate a recent murder at the museum, and handcuffs Hae-mi in suspicion. However, Im reveals that she is possessed by the red kimono doll, who wants to avenge its maker; all the guests Im invited are the descendants of the doll-maker's vigilante killers. Angry at being rejected by Hae-mi, Mi-na admits to murdering the other guests and kills Tae-seong before going after Hae-mi. She stops her murder attempt when she sees Hae-mi's scar, remembering the childhood incident where Hae-mi protected her. However, Im destroys Mi-na's soul before attempting to finish off Hae-mi, who kills Im in defense. The chained man, revealed to be Im's husband, escapes prison and kills the curator. He finds his dying wife, saying he regrets bringing the red kimono doll from the woods after all the trouble it caused. In the end, Hae-mi and Im's husband burn the dolls and the remaining corpses.

A. Smith. Acquired by the Navy 29 March 1956 and commissioned 3 December 1956, Commander J. A. Dare in command. Compass Island was one of two ships, the other being USS Observation Island (E-AG-154), converted and classified as navigational research test vessels under the Polaris Missile system budget. Compass Island's conversion was at an estimated cost of $19,600,000. The ship's mission was to assist in the development and evaluation of a navigation system independent of shore-based and celestial aids, a necessary adjunct of the ballistic missile program. She operated along the eastern seaboard testing equipment and training personnel until 13 March 1958 when she sailed from New York for experiments in the Mediterranean, returning to New York 17 April to resume her east coast operations. A dramatic example of her work was provided when USS Nautilus (SSN-571), using the Shipboard Inertial Navigation System (SINS) first tested by Compass Island in 1957, made a submerged cruise beneath the Arctic ice pack, touching exactly at the North Pole on 3 August 1958. The INS hardware was the N6A-1 built by North American Aviation, a naval modification of the N6A designed for the Navaho cruise missile. It had also been installed on the USS Skate (SSN-578), along with the Nautilus, following successful sea trials on the Compass Island.https://books.google.com/books?id=1T0NbffwteoC&pg;=PA71#v=onepage&q;&f;=true USS Skate reached the North Pole the week after Nautilus, and in the following year became the first vessel to surface at the North Pole.

With this new equipment, she continued her east coast and Caribbean cruising through 1960. In 2003, Compass Island and three other decommissioned US Navy ships, USS Caloosahatchee (AO-98), USS Canopus (AS-34), and USS Canisteo (AO-99), were towed to a dry dock site at Graythorp near the port city of Hartlepool in the United Kingdom to be scrapped, but UK environmentalists protested their arrival at Able UK, the salvage company. Work to dismantle a controversial fleet of former US warships was slated to begin in the summer of 2008, five years after the company originally won the scrapping contract.

He appeared in over 300 credits, notably Spartacus (1960) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), during his career spanning over 60 years.  Early years  Brocco was born in Reading, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Brocco.  Career  Brocco acted on stage with the Walter Hampton Players. He debuted on Broadway in Centuries (1927); he also performed in The Merry Wives of Windsor (1938). Brocco appeared as a criminal type in several episodes of Adventures of Superman. He holds the distinction of having been killed off in two of them, a relative rarity for villains in the series. In the first, The Secret of Superman, he deduces that Kent is Superman, but is killed in a police shootout soon after. In The Clown Who Cried, he falls off a building and Superman is unable to save him. He also appeared as \\"The Spector\\" in The Phantom Ring, where the criminals developed a machine that can make them invisible. Finally, in that episode, he survives, albeit rather banged up by Superman. Brocco was also on two episodes of Combat!, \\"The Long Walk\\" in 1964 and \\"The Flying Machine\\" in 1966. He appeared as Claymare, an Organian council member, in the Star Trek episode \\"Errand of Mercy\\", which established the uneasy treaty of peace between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. Brocco displayed a comedic talent portraying Peter The Waiter for 8 episodes of The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show on CBS during their 1955‚Äì1956 New York City season. Brocco played Colonel Matterson, a patient who used a wheelchair and had dementia, in the Academy Award-winning One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). He also appeared as the patient in the hospital, Mr. Eagane, in the Happy Days 1974 episode \\"Hardware Jungle\\". In 1983 he played Ali MacGraw's father in the epic TV miniseries The Winds of War. Brocco lived for some 40 years in Laurel Canyon, in a 1920s Spanish style home on Laurel Canyon Blvd. near the Country Store. He had his ceramics studio in the ground floor, a source of income when he was blacklisted for a while during the red scare of the early 1950s. Death Brocco died from a heart attack in Los Angeles, California, on December 20, 1992, aged 89.

In their initial WWE run, the stable consisted of Kenny, Mikey, Johnny, Mitch, and Nicky. The team's ring personas were those of an all-male cheerleading squad. Kenny and Mikey are currently signed to Major League Wrestling (MLW) as The Spirit Squad. Before forming the group, all members competed in OVW, WWE's developmental territory, where they were once opponents. In January 2006, the Spirit Squad made their television debut on the Raw brand. Three months later, the team won the World Tag Team Championship and, by \\"executive decision\\", were all collectively recognized as champions and internally decided which two defended the championship at any given time. Their reign marked the first time five wrestlers had been simultaneously recognized as World Tag Team Champions. After losing the tag team championship in November 2006, the team disbanded, with Kenny the only member to appear on WWE television regularly. Nicky, Mikey and Johnny returned to OVW, where Mikey and Nicky formed a tag team, and Mitch was released from his WWE contract in May 2007. Today, only Nicky has been continually signed since their breakup, wrestling under the name Dolph Ziggler. Other members occasionally reunite on the independent circuit.  Concept  The idea for the Spirit Squad came directly from World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) chairman Vince McMahon. Originally, the group was scheduled to be made up of four wrestlers from WWE's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW); Ken Doane, Nick Mitchell, Nick Nemeth and Elijah Burke. Burke, however, turned down McMahon's offer to join the Spirit Squad, feeling that he could not perform the acrobatics required from members of the group, and chose to remain in OVW. Burke was replaced in the Spirit Squad by Johnny Jeter and Mike Mondo. The five members were given new ring names Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky and Mikey.  History  =Formation= The Spirit Squad made their first appearances in WWE at house shows and in dark matches. On January 23, 2006, they had their television debut, when they appeared on Raw and helped Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler by performing cheers for Coachman and distracting Lawler. In subsequent weeks, the team was hired by several wrestlers to perform cheers for them. They eventually became a part of the ongoing scripted feud between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels. The villainous McMahon ordered the Squad to perform disrespectful cheers about Michaels, attack him on numerous occasions, and face him in multiple handicap matches. While involved in the Michaels- McMahon feud, they also continued wrestling in the tag team division, and on the April 3 episode of Raw, won the World Tag Team Championship when Kenny and Mikey ‚Äì with outside help from the other three Squad members ‚Äì defeated Big Show and Kane. After winning the championship, an \\"executive edict\\" was declared stating that all five members were recognized as the champions, with any two members allowed to defend the championship at once under the Freebird Rule. On May 1, the night after the Backlash pay-per-view, the five members of the Spirit Squad were jointly named \\"Co-General Managers\\" of Raw. During the night, after drawing \\"spirit straws\\", they placed Kenny into a title match with WWE Champion John Cena. Before the match they ordered play-by-play analyst Joey Styles in their office to instruct him on how to call Kenny's upcoming win (which never did come to pass), instructing him to do it \\"with spirit\\" or they would force him to call all of the following Raw episodes while wearing a female cheerleading uniform. This led to Styles confronting color commentator Jerry Lawler and eventually quitting the show in a worked shoot promo. Kenny lost the match after special referee Triple H, who was conspiring with the Squad, walked out on the match. Three weeks later, on Raw, Vince McMahon signed another handicap match pitting the Spirit Squad against Shawn Michaels. The match never started, however, because the Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, ripping apart his ring attire and, in storyline, shattering his knee with a steel chair. McMahon then called Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer, however, Kenny snatched the sledgehammer away, disrespecting Triple H, which led to him attacking the group. The Spirit Squad wrestling against D-Generation X in a handicap match at a house show Triple H and Shawn Michaels revived D-Generation X (DX) and as a team began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric pranks on the Squad and the McMahons (Vince and his son Shane), including DX dumping green slime onto the group and embarrassing the team afterwards, by defeating them, and dumping feces on the Spirit Squad and the McMahons. DX defeated the Spirit Squad in handicap tag matches at Vengeance, and scoring a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII. At the same time as their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon, the team also wrestled other teams in Raw's tag team division over their World Tag Team Championship. The Squad successfully defended the championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene, Charlie Haas and Viscera, and Snitsky and Val Venis before entering a lengthy feud with The Highlanders. They eventually defeated The Highlanders to retain the titles at the Unforgiven pay-per-view. At the end of September and beginning of October the Squad as a whole began a losing streak, with separate members losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of Raw. After Johnny and Mikey lost to the debuting Cryme Tyme on October 16, Kenny started yelling at the other members of the Spirit Squad in the ring and walked off shouting \\"I'm tired of losing\\". Tensions further escalated the following week, when the Spirit Squad lost to Cryme Tyme for the second consecutive week. After the defeat, Kenny attacked Mikey, then announced he would defeat Flair, since no other member of the group could do it. Later in the night he was successful, with help from the rest of the Squad, despite Flair bringing a number of fellow \\"Legends\\" (Dusty Rhodes, Sgt. Slaughter, and \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper) to the ring with him to even the odds. It was then decided that Flair and one of those legends, of the fans choosing, would wrestle the Squad at Cyber Sunday for the World Tag Team Championship. At Cyber Sunday the fans chose Piper and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the title. At the time of their loss the team had held the title for 216 days, the longest since the team of Owen Hart and The British Bulldog held it for 241 days in 1996 and 1997. At Survivor Series, The Squad (with Mitch) went on to face the legends consisting of captain Ric Flair, Sgt. Slaughter, Dusty Rhodes, and Ron Simmons (with Arn Anderson) in a losing effort. = Breakup and aftermath = The group disbanded on the November 27 episode of Raw, when they were defeated in a five-on-three handicap match by DX and Flair. In a backstage segment later that night, DX placed all members into a crate stamped \\"OVW, Louisville, Kentucky\\", a reference to the developmental territory from which the Spirit Squad had come. After the breakup, Kenny emerged as the only member to remain on WWE television, gaining the last name \\"Dykstra\\" and continuing the feud with Flair that led to the Spirit Squad's break up. At Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), Nicky and Mikey were repackaged as a tag team, called The Frat Pack. Johnny also returned to OVW after the breakup of the Spirit Squad, save for an appearance during a battle royal on an episode of Raw. Mitch was released from WWE on May 18, 2007, Johnny in the beginning of 2008, Mikey on June 13, 2008, and Kenny on November 10, 2008. In September 2008, Nicky began wrestling as Dolph Ziggler for WWE and as of 2020 is still under contract. Ziggler has gone on to have success as a singles wrestler, having won the Intercontinental, United States, and World Heavyweight Championships. =Independent circuit= On September 26, 2009, Kenny and Mitch reunited as the Spirit Squad in the National Wrestling Alliance's New Jersey territory in a match against Fire Power (Danny Inferno and Jim Powers) for the vacant NWA New Jersey Tag Team Championship but lost the match. On August 21, 2014, the Chikara promotion announced that Johnny, Kenny, and Mikey would be reuniting as the Spirit Squad for the 2014 King of Trios tournament. After a win over Sinn Bodhi and the Odditorium (Qefka the Quiet and Sir Oliver Grimsly) on September 19, the Spirit Squad was eliminated from the tournament in the second round on September 20 by the Golden Trio (Dasher Hatfield, Icarus and Mark Angelosetti). In 2016, Kenny and Mikey appeared for New York Wrestling Connection. On November 12, they captured the NYWC Tag Team Championship from Hounds of Hatred (Boo and Bam Sullivan) at Firestorm 3. 15 days later, Spirit Squad lost the titles back to Hounds of Hatred. On February 26, 2017, Kenny and Mikey defeated the UK Hooligans and 2 mates Pissing Around to win the Preston City Wrestling's Tag Team championship. On April 8, 2017, Kenny and Mikey answered The Young Bucks' open challenge for the Ring of Honor (ROH) World Tag Team Championship, losing the subsequent title match. =Return to WWE= In late 2016, Mikey and Kenny returned to WWE for a short storyline with Dolph Ziggler (formerly Nicky in the Spirit Squad). On October 4, on SmackDown, they taunted Ziggler about his time in the Spirit Squad, before attacking him at the behest of the Intercontinental Champion The Miz and Maryse. Five days later, at the No Mercy pay-per-view, they attempted to distract Ziggler in his career vs. title match against The Miz, but were unsuccessful. On the October 11 episode of SmackDown, Mikey and Kenny faced Ziggler in a two-on-one handicap match; Ziggler won but was attacked by The Miz before being saved by Rhyno and Heath Slater. This led to a six-man tag team match the following week, which Mikey, Kenny, and The Miz won. Mikey and Kenny unsuccessfully challenged Slater and Rhyno for the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship on October 25. They appeared throughout November in tag team matches, before disappearing off television. =House of Hardcore (2016‚Äì2018)= At House of Hardcore 23, The Squad (Kenny & Mikey) made their House of Hardcore (HOH) debut, losing to Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman. = Major League Wrestling (2019) = On July 24, 2019, it was announced that Squad members Mike Mondo and Kenny Dykstra were now signed to Major League Wrestling (MLW). They would go on to debut at that months Never Say Never show.https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/mike-mondo-kenn-doane- spirit-squad-join-mlw In MLW they are known as Doane and Mondo, the Spirit Squad. They wrestled on the pre-show main event to MLW Saturday Night SuperFight on November 2, 2019 in a 3 way tag match vs Contra Unit (Simon Gotch and Ikuro Kwon) and the team of Douglas James and Dominic Garrini.

The core of Kuula's oeuvre are his many works for voice and orchestra, in particular the Stabat mater (1914‚Äì18; completed by Madetoja), The Sea-Bathing Maidens (1910), Son of a Slave (1910), and The Maiden and the Boyar's Son (1912). In addition he also composed two Ostrobothnian Suites for orchestra and left an unfinished symphony at the time of his death in 1918.  Life and career  He was born in the Vehkakoski village of the Alavus town and registered as a native in the city of Vaasa (then Nikolainkaupunki), when Finland still was a Grand Duchy under Russian rule. He is known as a colorful and passionate portrayer of Finnish nature and people. Kuula became Jean Sibelius's first composition student. He is best remembered for his large output of melodic choir and vocal works. His instrumental works include two Ostrobothnian Suites for orchestra, a violin sonata, a piano trio, and an unfinished Symphony. Kuula's major choral work is often considered the cantata Stabat Mater, which was completed in spring 1915 (original version, later lost) but revised, beginning 1917 and unfinished at the time of his death. He also wrote a few dozen highly artistic piano works. A Swedish critic once said that Kuula's music reaches parts of the human spirit where one is forced to deep examination of one's self. Kuula was known to be a fierce Fennoman. He died in the provincial hospital in Viipuri in 1918 after being mortally wounded 18 days earlier on Walpurgis Night by a bullet fired by a J√§ger. The bullet was fired as a result of a quarrel that happened at the Hotel Seurahuone in conjunction with the first victory celebration of the White victory in the Civil War of Finland. Kuula is buried in Hietaniemi cemetery, Helsinki.

It is a work in three movements, lasting about 22 minutes. History In 1939, Philadelphia industrialist Samuel Simeon Fels commissioned Barber to write a violin concerto for his ward, Iso Briselli, a graduate from the Curtis Institute of Music the same year as Barber, 1934. The Barber biographies written by Nathan Broder (1954) and Barbara B. Heyman (1992) discuss the genesis of the concerto during the period of its commission and the subsequent year leading up to the first performance. Heyman interviewed Briselli and others familiar with the history in her publication. In late 2010, previously unpublished letters written by Fels, Barber, and Albert Meiff (Briselli's violin coach in that period) from the Samuel Simeon Fels Papers archived at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania became available to the public.Historical Society of Pennsylvania letters and an in-depth portrayal of the violinist, Iso Briselli linked to this violin concerto, written and edited by conductor, Marc Mostovoy http://www.isobriselli.com. Barber accepted Fels's advanceMay 4, 1939 Letter from Fels to Barber‚Äîsource-link 3 below and went to Switzerland to work on the concerto. Barber started working on the first two movements in Switzerland during the summer of 1939. He hoped to complete the concerto in the early fall to meet the October 1st deadline. His plans were interrupted, however, due to the impending war‚Äîall Americans were warned to leave Europe. In late August, he went to Paris and then took a ship to the USA, arriving in early September. After spending a short time with his family in West Chester, PA, he went to the Pocono Mountains to continue working on the concerto. When he delivered the first two movements to Briselli in mid-October, Briselli received them with great enthusiasm. He believed they were beautiful and eagerly awaited the finale. He suggested to Barber that when writing the last movement, he might include more of the virtuosic side of the violin's capabilities. However, in mid-November, things began to go awry. Briselli showed the two completed movements he was learning to his violin coach in New York City, Albert Meiff, who was immediately critical of the work from a violinistic standpoint. Briselli did not concur. Nevertheless, Meiff, who enjoyed the confidence of Fels, and believing he was protecting Briselli's interests, took it upon himself to write Fels a letter (November 13) stating why the violin part had to undergo a \\"surgical operation\\" by a \\"specialist\\" such as himself. He said \\"The technical embellishments are very far from the requirements of a modern violinist...\\" and if Briselli performed the work as written, it would severely hurt his reputation. Meiff said he was rewriting the violin part to make it more acceptable and that it was necessary that he, Briselli and Barber get together for a \\"special meeting\\" to discuss his changes.November 13, 1939 Letter from Meiff to Fels‚Äîsource-link 4 below Briselli was disappointed when he received the third movement from Barber in late November. He had expected a finale comparable in substance and quality to the first two movements, and felt it was too lightweight by comparison. He told Barber that it did not have a sense of belonging; it seemed musically unrelated to the first two movements, and he thought it was insufficient in compositional form or development to stand as the finale of a major work. It was important to Briselli that the commission be as substantial as the other major concertos in his repertoire that he was offering for prospective orchestra engagements. Briselli asked Barber if he would rewrite the finale; he could premiere it at a later date to give Barber more time if needed. He suggested possible ways in which the movement could be deepened or expanded; perhaps even changing its form altogether such as a sonata-rondo; that perhaps he might expand the third movement while possibly retaining the Moto perpetuo as the middle section and giving it more clearly defined structural parameters. Briselli felt that only then would it be a complete, first-class concerto. Despite Briselli's prodding, Barber was dismissive of his suggestions and declined to alter it. This was a big disappointment for Briselli, who believed that with a substantial third movement, the work could stand as a great American violin concerto. Briselli decided to hold his ground regarding the finale and chose to forego the concerto's premiere and relinquish his claim on it. On December 14, Barber wrote Fels that, as he probably already knew, Briselli had decided the piece was \\"not exactly what he wanted, and has given it back to me.\\" Barber expressed concern about the disposition of the $500 advance that he had already spent and wanted to be sure that Fels understood his side of the story. Barber explained why he was late in delivering the commission: he was held up in Europe with the war outbreak and subsequently the illness of his father. He landed back in the US on September 1st and immediately \\"went to the mountains to work.\\" Barber said he was surprised to see on landing that \\"the first performance was already announced for January\\" without his being notified by Briselli or Eugene Ormandy.Dec 4, 1939 Letter from Barber to Fels. . . P.1> http://www.isobriselli.com/letters/BROWN_1.jpeg . . .P.2> http://www.isobriselli.com/letters/BROWN_2.jpeg‚Äîsource-links 5,6 below Also, Barber knew Briselli and Fels wanted the music by October 1 to give Briselli time to learn it‚Äîpresumably for the upcoming January performances.May 4, 1939 Letter from Barber and reply by Fels‚Äîsource-links 1,2,3 below At this juncture, the Barber and Briselli accounts differ somewhat; both are set forth here: Barber continues that he gave Briselli \\"the completed first two movements (about 15 minutes of music)\\" in \\"the middle of October\\" and \\"he seemed disappointed that they were not of virtuoso charactera bit too easy.\\"December 14, 1939 Letter from Barber to Fels‚Äîsource-links 5,6 below Briselli's account was that he liked them very much but suggested to Barber when writing the third movement, he might explore more of the virtuosic side of the violin's capabilities. Barber then says he asked Briselli \\"what type of brilliant technique best suited him; he told me he had no preference.\\" Barber continues: \\"At that time, he did not apparently dislike the idea of a 'perpetual motion' for the last movement.\\" Barber says that he \\"worked very hard\\" on the last movement, finishing it \\"in far from ideal circumstances\\" (his father's illness), and sent the violin part to Briselli about two months before the intended premiere. Barber says that \\"It is difficult, but only lasts four minutes.\\" Barber never mentions Meiff's proposal that the three of them meet in regards to alterations of the violin part of the first two movements, or Meiff's desire to \\"advise\\" Barber on the third movement while it was being written. Barber then discloses to Fels that when he sent the finale to Briselli, \\"At the same time, I had a violinist from Curtis play it for me to see that it was practical and playable.\\" Barber then wrote \\"My friends heard and liked it, so did I. But Iso did not.\\" The three reasons he gave for Briselli's rejection were (1) \\"he could not safely learn it for January;\\" (2) \\"it was not violinistic;\\" and (3) \\"it did not suit musically the other two movements, it seemed to him rather inconsequential. He wished another movement written.\\" Barber continues \\"But I could not destroy a movement in which I have complete confidence, out of artistic sincerity to myself. So we decided to abandon the project, with no hard feelings on either side.\\" He said he was \\"sorry not to have given Iso what he had hoped for.\\"December 14, 1939 Letter from Barber to Fels‚Äîsource-links 5,6 below. [Contemporaries confirmed that the two men did remain friends until Barber's death despite their disagreement on the concerto.] Barber goes on to say that \\"While it was Iso's complete right not to accept a work he finds unsuitable,\\" he feels he does deserve to be paid something considering that he had worked four months entirely on the concerto and \\"has done his best in submitting a work for which he makes absolutely no apology.\\" He appeals to Fels' \\"understanding and generosity\\" that he be allowed to keep the $500 advance, which he believes is standard practice \\"when a commissioned work is not accepted by the commissioner.\\" Fels does say in his December 15 letter to Barber that the matter would most likely be settled \\"satisfactorily\\" for both parties. Meiff replies on December 26 to a hand written note from Fels with a lengthy two-page letterDecember 26, 1939 Letter from Meiff to Fels‚Äîsource-links 7,8 below outlining to Fels, \\"point by point,\\" the many reasons why the piece is deficient‚Äîthus arming Fels with the information he needed to be able to speak intelligently to Barber. Meiff explains: it \\"hasn't got enough backbone‚Äînot strong, not majestic‚Äîdoes not contain enough dramatic moments, all of which make for a successful performance.\\" He says it is not a piece for a great hall with a huge orchestra \\"...like placing a small basket of dainty flowers among tall cactus in a vast prairie;\\" he says it lacks an effective beginning and a typical violin technique. And specifically addressing the finale: \\"It was a dangerous thought from the very beginning, to make a perpetual motion movement ...without a breath of rest and without melodic parts...a risky tiresome ending...it was a wrong idea, and Mr. Barber should admit this.\\" Meiff therefore felt it his duty \\"to advise Iso not to do it.\\" On the positive side, he acknowledges that \\"...it has many beautiful parts\\" and that he has \\"personal admiration for the composer for himself personally and musically.\\" But there is never any evidence or assertion by Briselli or contention by Barber that Briselli found the third movement too difficult to play. As to the upcoming premiere performance, in place of the Barber, Briselli substituted Dvo≈ô√°k's Violin Concerto. Barber's letter of December 14 to Fels identifies his intention with regard to the third movement: Barber (now teaching at the Curtis Institute) set up a test of playability to assure himself what he was giving to Briselli was \\"practical and playable.\\" A Curtis student, Herbert Baumel, was known to be an excellent sight reader, and he was asked to study the finale for a couple of hours, then to join Barber in pianist Josef Hofmann's studio. After reviewing the music, Baumel went to the studio to discover an audience of Barber, Gian Carlo Menotti, Mary Louise Curtis Bok (founder of the Curtis Institute), and Edith Braun,Edith Evans Braun http://archives.nypl.org/mus/20102 a friend of Mrs. Bok. In the correspondence Barber writes, \\"My friends ... liked it, so did I.\\" In early 1940 there was a private performance by Baumel with the Curtis Institute Orchestra under Fritz Reiner. That performance brought the piece to the further attention of Eugene Ormandy, who soon scheduled its official premiere in a pair of performances by Albert Spalding with the Philadelphia Orchestra in the Academy of Music in February 1941. [The actual premiere was on February 7.] Those performances were followed on February 11, 1941, by a repeat performance in Carnegie Hall, and from that point, the piece rapidly entered the standard violin and orchestral repertoire, and has become one of the most frequently performed of all 20th-century concertos. It received its UK premiere by Eda Kersey at a Proms concert in 1943.Graham Parlett, CD review on the Arnold Bax Website (archive from 25 October 2014) Recordings The concerto has been recorded by a number of violinists, including Louis Kaufman, Ruggiero Ricci, Leonid Kogan, Anne Akiko Meyers, Joshua Bell, Giora Schmidt, James Ehnes, Hilary Hahn, Itzhak Perlman, Gil Shaham and Isaac Stern. The version made in 1964 by Stern with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Bernstein remains a celebrated romantic interpretation, while the 1988 recording by Meyers with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra has been highly praised. A transcription of the concerto for flute and orchestra was recorded and issued on the now defunct Collins Classics label and later re-released on the Regis label with Jennifer Stinton as the soloist. Form # Allegro # Andante # Presto in moto perpetuo Barber provided these program notes for the premiere performance: :The first movement‚Äîallegro molto moderato‚Äîbegins with a lyrical first subject announced at once by the solo violin, without any orchestral introduction. This movement as a whole has perhaps more the character of a sonata than concerto form. The second movement‚Äîandante sostenuto‚Äîis introduced by an extended oboe solo. The violin enters with a contrasting and rhapsodic theme, after which it repeats the oboe melody of the beginning. The last movement, a perpetuum mobile, exploits the more brilliant and virtuosic character of the violin. The concerto is scored for two each of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, and trumpets; timpani, snare drum, piano, and strings.

The title comes from the popular music hall song Ask a Policeman. The Turnbotham Round police force are threatened with dismissal by their Chief Constable and decide to manufacture some smugglers to keep their jobs. When they encounter real smugglers, their plans begins to fall apart. Plot Sergeant Dudfoot is talking about his life as a policeman at Turnbotham Round during a radio broadcast. His staff Albert and Harbottle (played by Graham Moffatt and Moore Marriott) enter after they have been poaching and Harbottle ruins the broadcast. The next day, Dudfoot receives a letter from the Chief Constable. The letter states that an investigation will shortly take place to see if the police force in Turnbotham Round is necessary at all since no arrests have been made in the ten years that Dudfoot has been a policeman. Dudfoot decides to set a speed trap and stops passing cars down a country lane just outside the village. After stopping and later releasing a man who has neither a licence nor insurance, Dudfoot, Harbottle and Albert stop, question and knock out another driver who is actually the Chief Constable. They drive the unconscious Chief Constable back to the police station and lock him in the cell. Dudfoot then drives the Chief Constable's car into Harbottle's shop window to create the impression that the Chief Constable had just had an accident. However, when the Chief Constable comes round, he fails to be fooled by the 'accident', but the Squire intervenes and claims to have witnessed the accident, which saves Dudfoot, Harbottle and Albert from a lot of trouble. The Chief leaves after Harbottle makes up a story about a Headless Horseman when questioned about his old looks. Dudfoot states that they need to arrest a criminal soon or else their police station will be closed down and Harbottle takes him to the library to look for books on crime. On their way the coastguard stops them and tells them his brother a lighthouse keeper wants a light hung up on top of the police station as his grandmother is very ill and he agreed to the idea that if he could see the light on the Police Station tower he'd know his grandmother was still alive. (Harbottle misunderstands this, thinking that the grandmother is alone in the lighthouse, causing him to sob uncontrollably whenever the matter is mentioned.) Unknown to the cops, this is connected to the smugglers. Later Albert suggests that they should capture some smugglers by placing a keg of brandy on the beach and getting a witness to see what happens. Dudfoot comes back into the station with a fisherman, who is carrying a keg of brandy and Albert and Harbottle say they haven't taken their keg down to the beach yet, therefore resulting in two kegs of liquor. Albert's girlfriend Emily screams and passes out as she claims to have seen a Headless Horseman. Later Albert spots the Headless Horseman too and after an encounter with him in the Squire's garage, they are scared off by the Horseman, though Harbottle finds a small package which he tucks away. Back at the police station, the Chief Constable phones them about the smuggling and instructs them to find the navigational light the smugglers are using. In spite of the light episode with the coastguard, the three policemen brush off the idea that the coastguard is involved with smuggling. A warning note to keep their noses out of things that are not of their concern is wrapped around a stone thrown in through the police station window. A ticking sound is heard from the package that Harbottle earlier picked up and they find pocket watches inside. Harbottle then recites a rhyme which tells the legend of the Headless Horseman, although he doesn't know the last line, but his father does. So the trio decide to pay him a visit. Harbottle's father reveals the line thus also revealing the place, the Devil's Cave where the smuggling is taking place. The trio investigate the cave, follow a tunnel and discover many barrels of liquor and other things that seemed to belong to Harbottle. They eventually discover that they are in their own cellar. They decide to call the Chief Constable, but are confronted by the Squire who reveals that he is the leader of the smugglers. After a fight in the dark, the smugglers lock the trio in their own cell and escape, deciding to give chase in their car, but since the other police agents think they are smugglers as well, their car is also wanted. After a chase on a bike, a lorry and a London bus, the police agents finally capture the smugglers at Brooklands. The Chief Constable asks the Squire if he has seen him before, but the Squire denies this. Dudfoot then reveals the story of the accident at Harbottle's shop, and the Chief Constable orders that the trio be arrested. Dudfoot punches the Chief Constable and the trio run as fast as they can along the race track away from the other pursuing policemen.

Tall, thin and bespectacled, Tufty Mann was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler. He played first-class cricket for Natal in the seasons immediately before and after the Second World War, and then played for Eastern Province from 1946‚Äì47. But more than two-thirds of his 73 first-class games were for South Africa, on tours to England in 1947 and 1951 and in home series against England and Australia. Background and early cricket career Born in Benoni, Transvaal, Mann was educated at the Michaelhouse boarding school in South Africa and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge University. He came to the fore in golf first and at the age of 16 he won the Natal Amateur Golf Championship. He won a blue for golf in the annual match between Cambridge University and Oxford University. He did not play cricket for the University's first team; he played in the Freshman's trial match, but did not take any wickets and was not tried again. Back in South Africa the following winter, however, Mann made his first-class cricket debut for Natal in five games in the 1939‚Äì40 season and bowled economically in them, though he did not take more than three wickets in any one innings. Mann served in the Second World War and was captured in the fighting in Italy; he escaped from a prisoner of war camp and was \\"hidden by peasants\\", according to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. He kept a large diary of his exploits in wartime and on his cricket visit to England in 1951 was attempting to sell his memoirs. In his will published after his death in 1952 he left ¬£400 to two Italian farmers who had sheltered him in the North Italian marshes after he had escaped. After war service, Mann returned to Natal but, as in 1939‚Äì40, in his three matches for the team in 1945‚Äì46 he failed to take more than three wickets in an innings. A move to Eastern Province in 1946‚Äì47 brought immediate dividends. In his first match for his new team, he took six wickets in Transvaal's first innings at a cost of 69 runs; more remarkable by modern standards was the economy, for the wickets, five of them Test batsmen, came in 67.6 eight-ball overs, 38 of which were maidens. At the time, the 542 balls he bowled were the most in any single innings in first-class cricket. He followed that with six for 126 against another Test-batsman-filled team, Natal, in the next match. The bowling won him a place in the 1947 South African team to England. Test cricketer in England The 1947 English cricket season was dominated by the batting exploits of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich, who both broke records for the numbers of runs scored in a season. Mann's accuracy was one of the few factors that could subdue the English pair, and his first bowling in Test cricket, in the first game of the five-match series, was a spell of eight successive maidens; he finished the innings with figures of no wickets for 10 runs in 20 overs. He followed that up when England followed on with second-innings figures of one for 94 in 60 overs: the single wicket that he took was that of Compton, but Compton had made 163 by that stage and the match was easily saved. The first Test figures illustrated Mann's value to the South African side, but also his limitations. \\"Mann rarely departed from his orthodox going-away ball on the middle or off stump and on account of his low trajectory batsmen seldom were able to get to the pitch,\\" Wisden wrote. In a sunny, warm summer, Mann was often used as a defensive bowler, but when there was a helpful wicket, he was at times able to impart some spin to the ball: Wisden recorded in the third Test, as England chased a small target for victory on a worn pitch, that \\"Mann's left-arm leg-breaks began to turn nastily... Hutton and Compton found this to their cost\\" as Mann dismissed both before the match was won by England. In the Test series as a whole, which England won by three matches to nil, with two draws, Mann was the South Africans' most successful bowler, taking 15 wickets at an average of 40.20 and bowling 329.5 overs: an economy rate of 1.83 runs an over. He conceded less than two runs an over when Edrich (189) and Compton (208) shared a third- wicket partnership of 370 in the second Test, and ended the stand by bowling Edrich, his only wicket in the match. His best bowling return of the series in a single innings came in the fourth game, when he took four for 68 in 50 overs in England's first innings. And in the final match he took four for 93 in 64 overs and followed that up with two for 102 in 27 overs ‚Äì England were hitting out to secure a declaration in a high-scoring match that ended as a draw. In all first-class matches, Mann took 74 wickets at an average of 25.25 and bowled 351 maiden overs. He had particular success in a late-season match against Kent when he followed first-innings bowling of six for 132 with a second-innings return of seven for 95. His batting was occasionally successful too: against Glamorgan he hit 97 in 55 minutes, including a six and 13 fours, and was out to \\"a deep-field catch\\" going for his century. This would remain his highest first-class score. Test series in South Africa Mann returned to South Africa for the 1947‚Äì48 domestic cricket season and in the first game took the best bowling figures of his career: eight for 59 against Western Province. For the two seasons that followed, however, domestic cricket took a back-seat to the tours of South Africa by, in 1948‚Äì49, an England team and then in 1949‚Äì50, a team from Australia. Mann played in all 10 Tests on these two tours and in only a single other first-class match in each season, and those other games were also against the touring sides. In the series against England, Mann headed the South African bowling averages, though with 17 wickets he took fewer than Cuan McCarthy and Athol Rowan. Played mainly on batsman-friendly pitches and with the South Africans in particular often batting very defensively, the series was won by England by 2‚Äì0 with three drawn matches and there was a lot of bowling for South Africa's main three bowlers. It was in this series, when a particularly drawn-out innings by the England captain George Mann ended with his dismissal by Tufty Mann that broadcaster John Arlott summed up the innings as \\"a case of Mann's inhumanity to Mann\\".Martin-Jenkins, Christopher (1990). Ball by Ball: The Story of Cricket Broadcasting. Grafton Books. p. 97. . Mann's best bowling figures came in the tight first match which was affected by rain and which England won very narrowly by two wickets: he took six first-innings wickets for 59 runs, but in the second innings he and Rowan, who had taken the other four wickets in the first innings, were hampered by a wet ball and bowled very little. Conditions got easier for batsmen in the next match: Mann had a spell in which he took three middle-order English wickets while only 10 runs were added, but the score was 540 for three before the first of these wickets fell, and they were his only wickets of the match. For the third and fourth matches of the series, the selectors packed the South African side with bowlers in an attempt to take wickets; a consequence was that Mann bowled very little and failed to take a wicket in either match, though his fellow spin bowler, Rowan, was used more and was successful. In the fifth and final game, the fringe bowlers were left out so Rowan and Mann did most of the bowling and took 15 of the 17 England wickets to fall. In the second innings of this game England were set 172 to win in 95 minutes and achieved the target; Mann's 9.7 overs ‚Äì eight-ball overs were used in this series ‚Äì cost 65 runs and brought him four wickets, one of the few times in his career when he was hit in this way. The Australian tour to South Africa in 1949‚Äì50 was an even less successful event for the South African side than the England tour had been: the Australians won four of the five Tests and had the better of the drawn game. South Africa's bowling was ostensibly hampered by injury to Rowan which kept him out of all the Tests, though Hugh Tayfield emerged as a spin partner for Mann and the real weakness, shown in the series figures, was in seam bowling ‚Äì Tayfield took 17 wickets in the series, Mann, 16 and the other bowlers only 17 between them. Mann's best innings figures for the series came in the second match, where he took four for 105 as the Australians scored 526 for seven before declaring. The Australian first innings of the following Test, the third, was the only time in the series when the South African bowlers got on top of the Australian batsmen, and Tayfield took seven for 23 and Mann three for 31 as the touring team was dismissed for just 75 to give the South Africans a first-innings lead of 236: Mann and Tayfield were unable to repeat the feat in the second innings, however, and the Australians won the match by five wickets. The fourth Test of the series was the only drawn game; Mann took no wickets, but he scored 52, his only Test match half century. Back to England Mann was picked for his second tour of England with the 1951 team. In the early matches of the tour, his defensive rather than his wicket-taking talents were to the fore: by the start of June, he had taken only 14 first-class wickets, but more than a third of his overs were maidens and he was averaging less than 1.8 runs per over from his bowling. In the first Test, following two large first innings, the South Africans struggled in their second innings against Alec Bedser and set England just 186 to win on a pitch that was affected by rain. Athol Rowan and Mann bowled England out for 114 and Mann's four for 24 came in 24 overs, of which 16 were maidens. The Times commented on Mann's accuracy which was, it wrote, as if \\"bowling on a sixpenny-piece over after over\\"; when he took his first wicket, that of Jack Ikin, his figures were one for six runs off 15 overs. The next two Tests were not successful either for Mann personally or for his team, with both games lost, and the fourth match of the series was played on a batting pitch at Leeds and Mann bowled 60 overs, taking three for 97, as England matched South Africa by scoring more than 500 before rain washed out the final day. The fifth and final Test at The Oval was played on a pitch that suited spin bowlers, but Mann was not fit to play: his absence, Wisden wrote, \\"was keenly felt, for the pitch should have proved ideal for his left-arm slow bowling\\". He returned to the team for one final county match against Middlesex at Lord's, but the game was washed out and he did not take a wicket in just six overs of bowling. On the tour as a whole, Mann's parsimony had left him top of the South African Test bowling averages with 10 wickets at an average of 26.40, and in all first-class matches he had taken 44 wickets at 26.38. Illness and death At the end of the tour of England, 14 of the 16 South African players departed for home on the Union Castle Line ship MV Winchester Castle; the exceptions were Cuan McCarthy, who started at Cambridge University, and Mann, who \\"is staying in England for medical treatment\\". Mann had \\"an abdominal operation\\" in England, where he stayed in hospital for three months, having been joined in England by his wife, Daphne. He was able to return to South Africa, but needed a second operation in mid-1952 and died six weeks later, on 31 July 1952 in Hillbrow.

Passage of the bill was defeated, in large part, by the lobbying efforts of Jack Abramoff. The bill was supported by Christian conservative groups such as Focus on the Family, Moral Majority, and the Christian Coalition. A new version of this legislation was attached to the SAFE Port Act and became law in 2006. In 1999, eLottery, inc. hired Jack Abramoff's lobbying firm, Preston Gates & Ellis, to represent their effort to block the bill. ELottery, an Internet-based firm, intended to sell state lottery tickets online, and this business venture was threatened by the IGPA. Abramoff recruited Ralph Reed, his College Republicans cohort, and Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition to oppose the legislation. Although Reed was a former Director of the Christian Coalition which now supported the bill, Abramoff suggested a strategy for opposing the bill on the basis of exceptions in the bill for horse racing and jai-alai. Reed and Sheldon later claimed that they did not know that they were effectively doing this work on behalf of a gambling corporation. These claims contradict email exchanges between Abramoff and Reed which discuss eLottery and its parent company, eLot in 2000 and 2001. In June 2000, Susan Ralston helped Jack Abramoff pass checks from eLottery to Lou Sheldon's Traditional Values Coalition (TVC) and also to Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), en route to Ralph Reed's company, Century Strategies :\\"I have 3 checks from elot: (1) 2 checks for $80K payable to ATR and (2) 1 check to TVC for $25K,\\" wrote Ralston, \\"Let me know exactly what to do next. Send to Grover? Send to Rev. Lou?\\" Abramoff directed his client, eLottery, to direct $25,000 in payments to Sheldon's Traditional Values Coalition, and also checks totalling $160,000 to Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform. Abramoff then directed Norquist to receive his checks and write another check for $150,000 to Faith and Family Alliance, a Delaware-based political advocacy group started by Reed. The check was received by Robin Vanderwall, then Director of Faith and Family Alliance, who claimed Reed called him and directed him to write a check for an equal amount to Century Strategies, Reed's political consultancy. \\"I was running a shell\\", Vanderwall later claimed. \\"I regret having had anything to do with it.\\" Abramoff was working closely with Tony Rudy, then Majority Whip Tom DeLay's Chief of Staff. In numerous emails, Rudy delivered inside information on the status of discussions of IGPA within the House Republican Caucus, and suggested strategies to defeat it. DeLay was normally a staunch opponent of gambling, but had not taken a position on the bill. Reverend Sheldon worked publicly to oppose the bill, holding numerous press conferences. On July 13, 2000, Sheldon met privately with DeLay. DeLay later announced his opposition to the bill. While the bill was under consideration in the House, a letter began circulating among congressman opposing the legislation, signed by Florida Governor Jeb Bush. The letter caused confusion amongst the Republican Caucus, but was later shown to be a forgery. Abramoff's firm had hired Shandwick Worldwide, based in Tampa, Florida to lobby Jeb Bush and other leaders for letters showing opposition to IGPA. Months later, a Florida man, Matthew Blair, told authorities in a plea bargain agreement that he was hired by Shandwick to obtain the letter, but created a forgery when he failed to get a real one. Shandwick denied any complicity in the forgery. DeLay voted against IGPA, and used his powers as Majority Whip to place the bill on the suspension calendar, a House procedural maneuver which bans amendments and limits debate. The bill's sponsor, Robert Goodlatte (R-VA) agreed, as he expected the bill to pass. The bill failed to meet the two- thirds majority required by the suspension calendar, and was rejected on July 18. The bill's original supporters, such as James Dobson's Focus on the Family, immediately demanded that the House leadership revive the bill. Abramoff realized that he would not be able to muster support to reject the bill in an ordinary majority vote. Abramoff used Sheldon to target 10 Republican House members in vulnerable districts, using Sheldon to carry out a media campaign and Reed to carry out a direct-mail campaign accusing the members of being 'soft on gambling' if they supported the bill. In a fax to eLottery on August 18, Abramoff wrote, \\"please get me a check as soon as possible for $150,000 made payable to American Marketing Inc. This is the company Ralph [Reed] is using.\\" Abramoff also directed eLottery to write a check for $25,000 to Toward Tradition, a Seattle, Washington-based foundation formerly chaired by Abramoff, and then chaired by Rabbi Daniel Lapin. Toward Tradition later employed Tony Rudy's wife, Lisa Rudy for work allegedly related to an Interfaith conference to be held in September 2000. Lapin claimed that Lisa Rudy's company, Liberty Consulting, was paid over $25,000 for \\"ground work\\" related to the conference. Toward Tradition also received $25,000 in funding from Abramoff's client Magazine Publishers of America. According to the MPA, this donation was given at the direction of another Preston Gates employee, not Abramoff. Tony Rudy had also aided Abramoff in lobbying Tom DeLay on a postal-rate increase opposed by the magazine publishers. The FBI interviewed Toward Tradition in 2005 regarding this apparent money laundering. Due to the campaigns manufactured by Reed and Sheldon, the targeted members reported to DeLay's office that they were being pressured by constituents to vote against the bill. Tony Rudy used his position as Chief of Staff to exaggerate these concerns in reports to Tom DeLay. DeLay eventually convinced other members of the House Republican leadership that passing the bill could cost the Republican caucus 4 seats, at which point the other leaders agreed not to put the bill to a vote in that session of Congress.

R. R. Tolkien wrote for his Middle-earth legendarium. Within the stories, the original song was composed by Bilbo Baggins and recorded in The Hobbit. Different versions of it also appear in The Lord of the Rings, along with some similar walking songs. The walking song gives its name to Donald Swann's 1967 song-cycle The Road Goes Ever On, where it is the first in the list. Versions of this song =In The Hobbit= The original version of the song is recited by Bilbo in chapter 19 of The Hobbit, at the end of his journey back to the Shire. Coming to the top of a rise he sees his home in the distance, and stops and says the following:The Hobbit, ch. 19 \\"The Last Stage\\" :Roads go ever ever on, :Over rock and under tree, :By caves where never sun has shone, :By streams that never find the sea; :Over snow by winter sown, :And through the merry flowers of June, :Over grass and over stone, :And under mountains in the moon. :Roads go ever ever on :Under cloud and under star, :Yet feet that wandering have gone :Turn at last to home afar. :Eyes that fire and sword have seen :And horror in the halls of stone :Look at last on meadows green :And trees and hills they long have known. =In The Lord of the Rings= There are three versions of \\"The Road Goes Ever On\\" in the novel The Lord of the Rings. 1) The first is in The Fellowship of the Ring, Book I, Chapter 1. The song is sung by Bilbo when he leaves the Shire. He has given up the One Ring, leaving it for Frodo to deal with, and is setting off to visit Rivendell, so that he may finish writing his book.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 1, ch. 1 \\"A Long-expected Party\\" :The Road goes ever on and on :Down from the door where it began. :Now far ahead the Road has gone, :And I must follow, if I can, :Pursuing it with eager feet, :Until it joins some larger way :Where many paths and errands meet. :And whither then? I cannot say. 2) The second version appears in Book One, Chapter 3. It is identical except for changing the word \\"eager\\" to \\"weary\\" in the fifth line. It is spoken aloud, slowly, by Frodo, as he and his companions arrive at a familiar road - the Stock Road - on their journey to leave the Shire.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 1, ch. 3 \\"Three is Company\\" 3) The third version appears in The Return of the King, Book VI, Chapter 6. It is spoken by Bilbo in Rivendell after the hobbits have returned from their journey. Bilbo is now an old, sleepy hobbit, who murmurs the verse and then falls asleep.The Return of the King, book 6, ch. 6 \\"Many Partings\\" :The Road goes ever on and on :Out from the door where it began. :Now far ahead the Road has gone, :Let others follow it who can! :Let them a journey new begin, :But I at last with weary feet :Will turn towards the lighted inn, :My evening-rest and sleep to meet. Earlier, when leaving the Shire, Frodo tells the other hobbits Bilbo's thoughts on 'The Road': \\"He used often to say there was only one Road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every doorstep, and every path was its tributary. 'It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out of your door,' he used to say. 'You step onto the Road, and if you don't keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept off to.'\\". Based on Bilbo's description here and his experiences, the Road consisted of the Hill Road, the Bywater Road, the Great East Road across Eriador, the High Pass over the Misty Mountains and the Elf- path through Mirkwood. The critic Tom Shippey contrasts the versions of the Old Walking Song sung by Bilbo and Frodo. Bilbo follows the \\"Road ... with eager feet\\", hoping to reach the peace of Rivendell, to retire and take his ease; whereas Frodo sings \\"with weary feet\\", hoping somehow to reach Mordor bearing the Ring, and to try to destroy it in the Cracks of Doom: very different destinations and errands. =In The Lord of the Rings films= This song is heard multiple times in The Lord of the Rings films. The first time it is heard, the song is sung and hummed by Gandalf as he approaches Frodo and is just barely discernable. Also when Bilbo makes his way off in attempt to finish his book, he sings a verse of the song. The later occurrences of this song are based on those in the books.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Film by Peter Jackson =A different walking song= Similar changes in mood and words are seen in two versions of \\"A Walking Song\\", in the same metre and similarly at the start and end of The Lord of the Rings. The first version, in the chapter 'Three is Company', is sung by the hobbits when they are walking through The Shire, just before they meet a company of elves. Three stanzas are given in the text, with the first stanza starting \\"Upon the hearth the fire is red...\\". The following extract is from the second stanza of the song. :Still round the corner there may wait :A new road or a secret gate, :And though we pass them by today, :Tomorrow we may come this way :And take the hidden paths that run :Towards the Moon or to the Sun. It is this part of the song that is reprised with different words later in the book. This new version is sung softly by Frodo as he and Sam walk in the Shire a few years after they have returned, and as Frodo prepares to meet Elrond and others and journey to the Grey Havens to take ship into the West. :Still round the corner there may wait :A new road or a secret gate, :And though I oft have passed them by, :A day will come at last when I :Shall take the hidden paths that run :West of the Moon, East of the Sun. The final line of the verse is a variant on the phrase \\"East of the Sun and West of the Moon\\", which is used in fairy- stories and similar tales to refer to another world that is fantastically difficult to reach ‚Äî in this case Aman, which can only be reached by the Straight Road. An example of the use of this phrase is in the fairy tale \\"East of the Sun and West of the Moon\\". Musical arrangements =Classical music= The title song and several others were set to music by Donald Swann as part of the book and recording The Road Goes Ever On, named for this song. The entire song cycle has been set to music in 1984 by the composer Johan de Meij; another setting of the cycle is by the American composer Craig Russell, in 1995. All the songs have been set to music by The Tolkien Ensemble across their four Tolkien albums, starting with their album An Evening in Rivendell. as part of the now completed project of setting all poems in The Lord of the Rings to music. =Film, radio, and musical theatre= A musical version of some sections of this song can be heard in the 1977 animated movie version of The Hobbit. While a full song was written for the film and can be heard on the soundtrack and story LP and is titled Roads, it was not heard in the film. The melody was later used in the 1980 animated version of The Return of the King and on The Return of the King soundtrack and story album. A musical version of some sections of this song can be heard in the movie The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, composed by Howard Shore. It is sung by Gandalf (Ian McKellen) in the opening scene, and also by Bilbo (Ian Holm) as he leaves Bag End. Gandalf's singing can be heard on the track Bag End on The Complete Recordings and Bilbo's on Keep It Secret, Keep It Safe. Large parts were included in Billy Boyd's \\"The Last Goodbye\\" on the soundtrack of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. The song can be heard in the 1981 BBC radio version, sung by Bilbo (John Le Mesurier) to a tune by Stephen Oliver. The stage musical based on the novel includes a song, \\"The Road Goes On\\" - the lyrics of which are loosely based on this poem. =Literary adaptations= The UC Berkeley Alumni Chorus commissioned the American composer Gwyneth Walker to set the poem to music in 2006, which she did in several musically unrelated ways.

The film is set at Narkover School, where headmaster Doctor Alec Smart (Will Hay) becomes involved in the disappearance of a valuable necklace. The setting is loosely based on the works of Beachcomber, where Narkover is a school specializing in gambling and extortion, and the headmaster is a \\"Dr. Smart-Allick\\". Plot Alec Smart, who is engaged teaching in a prison, applies for the job of headmaster at a nearby public school to replace the previous headmaster who has been convicted of writing forged cheques and has just been sent to prison. Smart appeals to the Governor to write him a good reference which he pretends to. Afterwards he writes his real recommendation which is very negative about Smart's talents. The trustee who works as the Governor's secretary, Faker Brown, \\"accidentally\\" gets the two letters mixed up and delivers the one praising Smart. On the basis of the letter, Lady Dorking, the who runs the Board of Governors appoints Smart to the job. This angers her deputy, Colonel Crableigh, who had favoured promoting his nephew, the Deputy head. On his arrival at the school, Smart is treated to a boisterous reception by the unruly students led by the Head Boy, Cyril Brown, who is the son of Faker Brown. Narkover proves to be a breeding ground for young criminals, who prefer to spend their time playing cards rather than taking classes. After his initial attempts to stop their games, Smart himself ends up playing cards with the students. He gets off on the wrong foot with Colonel Crableigh but, in spite of Smart's obvious incompetence, Lady Dorking immediately takes a shine to him. Crableigh begins engineering a scheme to have Smart dismissed and replaced by his own nephew. Soon after his arrival Smart is approached by Faker Brown, just released from prison, who blackmails him into giving a job as a steward at the school. Brown has his eye on the valuable jewels of Lady Dorking, in particular her diamond necklace, which she is due to be wearing on Founders Day which takes place a few days later. It involves a dinner and a rugby match between the school's old boys and the current students, with Smart persuaded to captain the school team. On Founder's Day, Lady Dorking wears her best jewels. In the Headmaster's study, she is shown some conjuring tricks by Smart. Crableigh places Dorking's necklace in Smart's pocket in an attempt to incriminate him and have him dismissed. However, the necklace is then stolen by Faker who hides it in a decanter. After trying, and failing, to persuade him to give it back Smart takes it and hides it in a Jewellery Box due to be presented to Lady Dorking at the dinner.. Shortly before the presentation, the diamonds are again taken by the Head Boy Cyril Brown who picks the lock. He hides the necklace in a rugby ball, but before he can make off with it, the ball is taken by the referee in the match. Confusion then ensues as during the match, Faker and Cyril Brown try to recover the ball and make off with it while Smart tries to prevent them. Eventually Smart kicks the ball towards some police spectators and unmasks the villains in spite of Crableigh's attempts to have Smart arrested for the theft.

Production and reception His first production for Gainsborough Pictures, the film was a breakthrough role for Will Hay and helped establish him as a film star throughout the British Empire. The role of the bumbling schoolmaster, which he had first developed in his 1920s music hall act, would be reprised in another two of Hay's films, Good Morning, Boys and The Ghost of St. Michael's Writing for The Spectator, Graham Greene characterized the film as \\"very amusing\\", describing Hay's portrayal of Dr. Smart as \\"competent\\" and praising Dampier's portrayal of Second Master Finch as the film's \\"finest performance\\". (reprinted in: ) The Radio Times Guide to Films gave Boys Will Be Boys three stars out of five, observing that the film contains \\"the blend of bluster and disthonesty that makes [Hay's] films irresistible\\".Radio Times Guide to Films (2004). p.187 Influence This was Hay's first screen outing for his well- established \\"schoolmaster\\" music hall routine. Hay had previously appeared in two Pinero adaptations Those Were The Days and Dandy Dick, and a comedy revue show as the incompetent head of a broadcasting service in Radio Parade of 1935. After the success of Boys Will Be Boys, Hay appeared in a number of films in which he played incompetent schoolmasters including Good Morning Boys and the Ghost of St Michaels. Hay has been described as being \\"surpassed only by Chaplin as an actor who ingeniously found how to translate his music hall performative to film\\".St Pierre p.192 Based on this film, an Australian radio show was made called Fourth Form at St Percys, which quickly changed its title to Yes, what! The show features a teacher (Percy Pym) who sounded like Will Hay trying to teach a bunch of unruly children, the worst of who are Greenbottle (who sounded like Moore Marriott) and Bottomley. They never quite manage to get through a lesson through endless interruptions which easily lead the teacher astray which leads to punishments (hitting with a stick) being handed out. The shows were about 12 minutes long and normally began with chimes and; \\"Good morning boys! Good morning sir\\" The series lasted from 1935 till 1937 and cost A$10 an episode to make. Over seventy years later, it is still on a number of radio stations in Australia and is currently available on CD with one of the stars talking about the show.

Biography The son of one Test player, Len Tuckett, and the nephew of another, Joe Cox, Lindsay Tuckett was just a month past his 16th birthday when he made his first-class cricket debut for Orange Free State in March 1935. A lower-order right-handed batsman and a fast-medium right-arm bowler who specialised in in-swingers, he took regular wickets for one of the weaker provincial sides for the next 20 years, but had a much shorter career in Tests. Picked for the 1947 South African tour of England, he began promisingly, and even though he strained a muscle in the first Test and was less effective afterwards, he was picked for all five Tests and finished with 15 wickets, the joint highest number for the side. In the first innings of the first match at Trent Bridge, he took five England wickets for 68 runs and it was a dropped catch off his bowling in the second innings that, according to the report in the 1948 Wisden, allowed England to escape from the match with a draw after following on 325 runs behind. At Lord's in the second Test, he again took five wickets in the first innings, this time for 115 runs as England amassed 554 runs with centuries by Bill Edrich and Denis Compton. On the 1947 tour as a whole, Tuckett took 69 wickets at an average of 25 runs per wicket. When the Marylebone Cricket Club toured South Africa in the 1948‚Äì49 season, Tuckett was again chosen as an opening bowler in four out of the five Tests, but could not repeat his form of 18 months earlier. He took only four wickets in the series and did not play for South Africa again. In the first Test, he bowled the last possible over of the match, and on the eighth and final ball England's ninth wicket pair of Alec Bedser and Cliff Gladwin scrambled the single run that gave the touring side victory. Following the death of Norman Gordon on 2 September 2014, Tuckett was the oldest living Test cricketer. He died on 5 September 2016 at the age of 97.
