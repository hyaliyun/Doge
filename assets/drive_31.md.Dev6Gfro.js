Early life Hackett was born near Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland, the eldest child of the Rev. John Winthrop Hackett, M.A., and his wife, Jane Sophia Monck-Mason, (daughter of Henry Monck-Mason, LL.D.). Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, he graduated BA in 1871 and MA in 1874. He was called to the Irish bar in 1874, but emigrated to Sydney, in 1875 where he was called to the New South Wales bar in the same year. Career Hackett took up journalism and contributed to the Sydney Morning Herald, but in 1876 went to Melbourne to become vice-principal and tutor in law, logic and political economy, at Trinity College. He also contributed to The Age and the Melbourne Review. In 1880 he was a candidate for Normanby at an election for the Victorian Legislative Assembly as an advanced liberal, but was badly defeated and lost his deposit. At a later election Hackett was opposed to John Madden, and this time lost by only a small margin. At the end of 1882 he resigned his positions at Trinity College and went to Western Australia to become a squatter in the Gascoyne district. Among other properties, he took up Wooramel Station; his first season was a bad one and he decided to give up the land. He joined forces with Charles Harper, the proprietor of The West Australian, and very soon his influence on this paper began to be felt. The Western Mail was established in 1885 and both papers became prosperous. In 1887 Hackett became editor of The West Australian and was a strong advocate of responsible government. Western Australia received its constitution in 1890, and Alexander Forrest selected Hackett as the first man to be asked to join the nominee Western Australian Legislative Council. The population of the colony was still under 50,000 but was beginning to rise, and the discovery of gold accelerated this. The newspapers grew with the population and became very valuable properties. Hackett, as editor, was writing a daily leading article, and was also the business manager. Hackett at the 1898 Australasian Federal Convention. In 1894 Hackett was elected to the Legislative Council as representative of the south-western province, and held this seat until his death. He was a delegate to the 1891 and 1897 Federal conventions, and was appointed a member of the constitutional committee. He was asked to join more than one ministry, but had to decline as it was impossible for him to add to the work he was already doing. He was also of the opinion that, as a newspaper editor, he would no longer be able to speak with the same freedom if he were in office. He advocated women's suffrage, and Western Australia was one of the early jurisdictions to give women the vote. He also strongly supported Forrest in his development policy, in the building of the pipe line to the goldfields, and the making of Fremantle harbour. He was interesting himself very much in the Perth public library, museums, and national gallery of which he became president, and also in the proposed university. He was a prominent member of the Church of England, holding the offices of registrar of the Diocese of Perth and chancellor of St George's Cathedral. He declined a knighthood in 1902 but accepted it in 1911, and two years later was created KCMG. The University of Western Australia opened in 1913 with Sir John as its first chancellor, and he gave it its first substantial private contribution when he endowed the chair of agriculture. Hackett's partner, Charles Harper, died in 1912, and Hackett acquired full ownership of the West Australian for ¬£88,000. Hackett suffered from Parkinsonism and his health began to fail in 1915. He took a trip to the eastern states which appeared to have benefited him; however he died suddenly on 19 February 1916 of a heart condition and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery. Family On 3 August 1905, Hackett married the 18-year-old Deborah Vernon Brockman (1887‚Äì1965). They had four daughters, and a son also called John. John (1910‚Äì1997) also became Sir John Hackett, a popular and distinguished General in the British Army. After she was widowed, Lady Hackett remarried to become Lady Moulden, and finally ‚Äì after an honorary doctorate and a further widowhood ‚Äì married Basil Buller Murphy to become Dr. Deborah Buller Murphy. A daughter Patricia Hackett (1908‚Äì1963) followed her father into the legal profession, and is today remembered for the Patricia Hackett Prize awarded by the University of Western Australia and endowed in her memory in 1965.William Wilde et al, The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature Oxford University Press, Melbourne 2nd edition 1994 Legacy Hackett was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D. by Trinity College, Dublin in June 1902. Under his will a bequest to the Church of England paid for the building of St George's College, the first residential college within the University of Western Australia. After provision for his widow and children, the residue of his estate went to the University which received the sum of ¬£425,000. This was an unexpectedly large sum, because by the time that the university was ready to receive it in 1926, shares in The West Australian had increased greatly in value. ¬£250,000 of this with accrued interest was used for the erection of a group of buildings which include Winthrop Hall and Hackett Hall, which were built in a much grander architectural style than might previously have been envisaged. Another ¬£200,000 was used to set up a fund which still provides scholarships, bursaries and other financial help for deserving students. The suburb of Hackett, in inner North Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia bears his name, in recognition of his efforts to support the federation of the Australian colonies, which took place in 1901. Streets and a suburb in Perth are also named 'Hackett' and 'Winthrop'.

RainSong makes high-end carbon fiber (graphite) bodied steel-string acoustic guitars, with past models including nylon string guitars, 12-string guitars, and a jazz archtop guitar.  Company  RainSong Graphite Guitars is a guitar manufacturing company originally based out of Hawaii that recently moved to the mainland to Woodinville Washington near Seattle. Because the company was in such high demand, relocation allowed for easier distribution. In addition to the 30 states in the U.S., they can now be found in Canada, The United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Singapore, and Australia. RainSong makes about four or five guitars a day and only about five hundred to one thousand in a year compared to larger companies like Fender and Gibson which make that much in a day. This attributes to the cost of the guitar, where they range from about $2,000 to $4,000 depending on the model you purchase, the twelve-string tends to be one of the most expensive.  Creator/Current owner  The creator of RainSong, John Decker designed the guitar, like most inventions, out of the necessity for a product that didn't exist. This idea was sparked when Decker was playing guitar for a wedding in Hawaii when it started to pour. This posed a problem because his guitar was wooden and would warp after coming in contact with moisture, completely ruining the body of the guitar. He was caught in the dilemma of if he should continue to play and ruin his guitar or should he run for cover and risk angering the bride and family. After this experience, he was determined to create a guitar that could withstand the weather and humidity that Hawaii offered. Decker had an extensive background in physics, specifically in plasma physics. He earned his PhD in plasma physics in 1966 from Cambridge University then worked for the air force as a physics researcher. Then after he moved to Hawaii and worked as the manager of the air forces optical observatory. In 1981 he went into business for himself in cooperation with Luther Lorenzo Pimentel and was determined to create this guitar that he could play in any weather. After finding the perfect recipe for the guitar and making a successful business from it, he then retired and left the business to his son- in-law. Coomar took over the business from Decker, his father-in-law, and decided that keeping the company in Hawaii had too many business disadvantages. Coomar, who is originally from India and then graduated from the University of Southern California, decided to move the business to Woodinville in 2001 since one of his toolers, Beaver Machine Works owner Rod Brower, offered him a building for rent.  Manufacture  Artist Big Kenny from Big and Rich using a RainSong Guitar in concert John Decker's background and extensive research, conducted at the Sperry Rand research lab in Sudbury, Massachusetts where he focused on plasma stability helped him develop a guitar made from graphite. Using data research he conducted on the stiffness and density properties of wood, he figured out composite materials that had similar properties to this. Most materials ,such as plastics and fiberglass, were rejected because they were too stiff or extremely heavy. He finally settled on graphite which is a composite material of carbon fibers in an epoxy matrix. The materials are shipped from Tulsa, Oklahoma, at subzero temperatures in order to keep the material malleable. It is then shaped, hardened and cured by baking at 200 degrees for several hours. This process uses the same technology for bonding the pieces of the bridge and neck together that is used in making planes and rockets and other satellite equipment, therefore its much stronger than any other bond classic guitars and made with like wood glues or epoxy which can still warp and decay with time and weather changes. No matter the weather, rain or shine, you can still play on the guitars, hence the name RainSong.  Sound  Pure carbon guitars produce a tone that is clear, rich and resonant, similar to a piano, with a treble that rings with clarity and a bass that is warm without being muddy. It has showed up in the hands of performers including two longtime rockers, Steve Miller and Daryl Hall. Dr. Decker said the most responsive possible guitar soundboard would be one with infinite stiffness and zero mass, so that the energy from the slightest tug of a finger on a string would translate most efficiently into moving air instead of diffusing as heat in the structure of the instrument.  RainSong body styles  RainSong offers five different body styles of their guitars within several different ‚Äúseries‚Äù. Their body types they offer which are shown in the graphic below are the DR(dreadnought), the JM, The OM, the WS, and the PA. Each is designed for a different effect and sound quality. Some are made to be louder or softer or just to be more visually pleasing or comfortable. Each of their series are based around an idea or concept. As of 2017 their series collections are named ‚ÄúConcert Hybrid Series‚Äù which are made to be good harmony guitars, ‚ÄúHybrid Series‚Äù which are described to have a mellow blend effect on the tone at a more affordable price point in comparison to the other styles, ‚Äúclassic Series‚Äù which are engineered to have crystalline clarity in their tone, ‚ÄúConcert Series‚Äù which have a warmer tone to them, and last but not least the ‚ÄúBlack Ice Series‚Äù which are the artistry guitars that feature intricate design patterns on the body of the guitar and every guitar is unique in both appearance and tone.

Since the conclusion of his driving career, McClure has remained in ARCA, serving as both a team owner and currently a crew chief. For the 2020 season, he has worked for two teams, serving as the crew chief for John Ferrier's family team in ARCA's season- opening race at Daytona, and for Connor Okrzesik's part-time ARCA Menards Series East team. Racing career =Driving career= McClure made his Busch debut in 1988, running his own No. 83 Oldsmobile in four races. His series debut came at Nazareth, falling out due to an engine failure. McClure's finishes improved drastically every race and by the race at Langley, McClure earned his best finish of the year in 18th. Also, his best start of the year ended up 12th at Myrtle Beach. McClure made two starts in 1989. He finished 19th at Charlotte and 25th at Rockingham. McClure had one start in 1990. He started 41st at Daytona, but was caught up in a crash. However, McClure still managed 22nd and the season opener at Daytona would prove to be his only 1990 start. McClure only made one career start in NASCAR's Winston Cup Series, which came in 1992 at the 1992 running of the Champion Spark Plug 400. He qualified the Jim Rosenblum Racing 39th at Michigan. He did finish the race, however, it was only a 31st-place finish. McClure returned after a six-year hiatus in 1996, running three races for Moy Racing. After finishing 26th and 31st, McClure finished 16th at the Milwaukee Mile. It would prove to be his best career finish in the series. McClure was then invited back for ten races in 1997 for Moy. McClure's team struggled in his starts. His best start was 32nd and best finish was 23rd at Las Vegas. The poor results can be explained to his five DNFs in ten starts. McClure reappeared on the NASCAR scene in 2000, running three CTS races for Albernaz Racing. He started 29th and finished 26th at Portland. His next start at Texas proved to be his best. He was 21st in that race. At Nazareth, McClure earned his best career start of 28th and looked to be in good shape for bettering his previous starts. However, a late engine failure ended his CTS career in 23rd. McClure's start at Nazareth in 2000 ended up being his last NASCAR race as a driver. =Crew chiefing career= In 2008, McClure worked for Fast Track Racing in the ARCA Series, crew chiefing the No. 11 car full time for Bryan Silas. In addition, he crew chiefed FTR's part time Truck Series team, the No. 48, when Silas and Hermie Sadler made a combined three starts in that truck. According to ThePitLane.org, Cal Boprey replaced McClure as the crew chief of the No. 11 of Silas for 2009, and he moved to the No. 15 Venturini Motorsports Chevy/Toyota, a part time car, to crew chief drivers Ryan Fischer, Alex Yontz, Dakoda Armstrong, Justin Marks, Justin Lloyd, Jesse Smith, Josh Richards, and Steve Arpin. 2009 ARCA RE/MAX Team Chart ThePitLane.org. Accessed August 15, 2019. He left after one year to crew chief Brazilian rookie Miguel Paludo's No. 77 car for Hattori Racing Enterprises in the K&N; East Series. McClure was crew chief for rookie T.J. Bell's partial Cup Series schedule in 2011 in the No. 50 Toyota/Chevy for LTD Powersports (a team owned by Joe Falk, before he owned Circle Sport). The team shut down after just one year, and McClure went back to ARCA crew chiefing for Andy Belmont Racing's No. 1 Ford and driver Mikey Kile in 2012. McClure rejoined Venturini Motorsports' ARCA Racing Series team in 2013. He had one win as crew chief for Todd Gilliland in 2015 and two wins with Christopher Bell in 2016. For 2017, he was the crew chief for the No. 15 driven by Christian Eckes and other drivers. McClure eventually left Venturini (again) and joined Empire Racing as the crew chief for the No. 46 car of Thad Moffitt. The team has an alliance with Richard Petty Motorsports. In 2018, he also served as crew chief for dirt racer Ryan Unzicker at Springfield and DuQuoin (when he needed a crew chief and Moffitt was not running those races).

Contents According to Cato's biographer Cornelius Nepos, the Origins consisted of seven books. Book I was the history of the founding and kings of Rome. Books II and III covered the origins of major Italian city and gave the work its title. The last four books dealt with the Roman Republic, its wars, and its growing power,Cornelius Nepos, Life of Cato, ¬ß3. focused on the period between the onset of the First Punic War up to 149. When Cato wrote, there had been four major works devoted to Roman history: Naevius and Ennius had written in Latin verse and Fabius Pictor and Alimentus had written in Greek prose. The two poetic works closely tied the history of Rome to its gods. The two prose works apparently hewed closely to the annals of the pontifex maximus. Feeling no need to follow precedent, Roman or otherwise,. Cato declared: In his books on the Italian cities, Cato apparently treated each individually and drew upon their own local traditions.. The latter books include at least two of Cato's political orations verbatim, something thought to have been unique in ancient historiography. The first was his oration to the Roman Senate against declaring war on Rhodes in 167. The other was his oration to the Senate supporting legislation to establish a special court of inquiry regarding Sulpicius Galba's treatment of the Lusitani. Although he avoided mentioning military commanders by name, the work's surviving fragments suggest that he also focused a great deal of attention on his own campaigns as a general. History The Origins is a lost work, with no complete text surviving to the modern day. Its fragments in other works. have been collected and translated. Influence Festus felt that the last four books on Rome's rising power \\"outweighed the rest\\",Festus, On the Meanings of Words, p. 198 M. but later Roman historians largely disregarded the Origins because it eschewed consular dating. and highlighted his own political career so heavily. Livy pointedly remarked that Cato was \\"not the man to minimize his own achievements\\".Livy, History of Rome, XXXIV, xv, 9. In the present day, the Origins is considered to be the beginning of proper historiography in Latin and considered to have been an important work in the development of Latin literature.

Later it obtained nationwide 15-year GSM license in November 1996 to extend its business to cellular mobile, radio telephone services. It launched operation in the last quarter of 1997 as a Bangladesh-Malaysia joint venture. Gulshan. In July 2004, it was reported that Egypt based Orascom Telecom is set to purchase the Malaysian stakes in Sheba Telecom through a hush-hush deal, as Sheba had failed to tap the business potentials in Bangladesh mainly due to a chronic feud between its Malaysian and Bangladeshi partners. An agreement was reached with Orascom worth US$25 million was finalised in secret. The pact has been kept secret for legal reasons, considering financial fallout and because of the feud. The main reason for the undercover dealing was the joint venture agreement between the Bangladeshi and the Malaysian partners, which dictates that if any party sells its Sheba shares, the other party will enjoy the first right to buy that. Integrated Services Ltd. (ISL), the Bangladeshi partner, was being 'officially' shown as purchasing the shares held by Technology Resources Industries (TRI) of Malaysia for $15 million. ISL then paid another $10 million to Standard Chartered Bank to settle Sheba's liabilities. In September 2004, Orascom Telecom Holdings purchased 100% of the shares of Sheba Telecom (Pvt.) Limited. It was acquired for US$60 million. Sheba had a base of 59,000 users, of whom 49,000 were regular when it was sold. Afterward it was re-branded and launched its services under the \\"Banglalink\\" brand on 10 February 2005. In March 2008, Sheba Telecom (Pvt.) Limited changed its name as Orascom Telecom Bangladesh Limited, matching its parent company name. In July 2013, following the 2011 ownership restructuring in the parent company, the company name changed for the second time to Banglalink Digital Communications Ltd.

The event ran from 1902 to 1951 and was won by many major champions, including three-time winners Walter Hagen, Ben Hogan, and Sam Snead. Played in March until 1944, the final seven events were held in early November. Hogan's win in 1940 at age 27 was his first as a professional; the winner's share was a thousand dollars. It was cancelled when the professionals asked the patrician patriarch of Pinehurst, Richard Tufts, who was a great champion of amateurism, to increase the prize money in line with PGA Tour rates. The final tourney's purse was $7,500 in 1951, with a winner's share of $1,500.

It is a low-wing monoplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Front seating was in a side-by-side configuration with a rear seat provided. Design and development Designed to meet Air Ministry Specification T.23/43, the Prentice was the first all-metal aircraft to be produced by the Percival Aircraft Company. The prototype Prentice TV163 first flew from Percival's factory at Luton Airport, Bedfordshire on 31 March 1946. Early trials revealed inadequate rudder control, resulting in a revised rudder and a large cutout in the elevators. The aircraft were later modified with turned-up wingtips.Thetford 1976, p. 429. Over 370 were delivered to the RAF between 1947 and 1949. An unusual design feature was the provision for three seats. While the instructor and pupil were equipped with dual controls in a side-by-side arrangement in the front, a second pupil sat in the rear seat without controls to receive \\"air experience\\". Both pupils could communicate with the instructor. Night flying training was to be carried out in daylight by means of amber screens incorporated into the canopy and the use of special goggles. The amber screens were folded back when not in use.Marsh, Jeff. \\"Percival \\"Prentice\\" T1\\". Air Atlantique Classic Flight Project, 20 September 2005. Retrieved: 14 May 2009. Several hundred Prentices were ordered for RAF use. Since the Percival factory was concentrating on production of the Percival Proctor and the Merganser light transport aircraft, production was sub-contracted to the Blackburn Aircraft works at Brough. Operational service After these modifications, the Prentice was passed into RAF service, initially with the regular Flying Training Schools (FTS) including the RAF College, Cranwell where they replaced the remaining de Havilland Tiger Moths. Later deliveries went to the Reserve Flying Schools (RFS). The type was used as a pilot trainer until 1952 at the RAF College where it was replaced by the de Havilland (Canada) Chipmunk and in late 1953 at the other schools, when it was replaced by the Percival Provost. Two Air Signals Schools also operated the type to train air signallers, until the last were withdrawn from No.1 ASS at RAF Swanton Morley, Norfolk, in mid 1956.Sturtivant 1997, p. 61. Civilian operations A preserved Percival Prentice giving a pleasure flight in 2007 252 redundant RAF Prentices were later bought in 1956 by Aviation Traders Ltd, a company owned by Freddie Laker.Jackson 1974 and were stored at Stansted and Southend. Most were eventually scrapped but 28 were converted for civil use with two seats and two jumpseats behind the two pilots' seats, separated by a structure which housed the original 4-channel radio. This conversion had quite poor performance with four passengers. One aircraft (G-AOKL) was based at Stansted Aerodrome near London around 1963 and used by the Parachute Club for parachuting with at least three jumpers. One aircraft was converted to a seven-seat layout for pleasure flights. One (G-AOPL) was acquired from Shackleton Aviation at Sywell by Captain Jon Cousens, a Desert Intelligence Officer in the Trucial Oman Scouts and flown to Sharjah in 1967; later being flown on to South Africa where it remained until it ceased flying. The aircraft had a poor performance with any load at high temperatures and initially had poor spin recovery. Forty-two aircraft were built under licence by Hindustan Aircraft for the Indian Air Force. Three fictional civilian Percival Prentice are featured in The Black Island (French: L'√éle noire), the 7th volume of The Adventures of Tintin, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Herg√©. The planes are used by money forgers, flying over Sussex and Scotland.

Life Majumder, Mohitlal (1888-1952) poet, essayist and literary critic, was born in a Baidya family on 26 October 1888 in the village of Kanchrapara in Nadia district, India at his maternal uncle's house(Kanchrapara is now in North 24 Parganas district). His native village was Balagarh in Hooghly District of present-day West Bengal.Bangla Sahitye Mohitlal, Khan, Azharuddin, Jigyasa , Calcutta, 1961, p. 2 He graduated in arts in 1908 from Ripon College (now Surendranath College), Kolkata. He began his career as a teacher at Calcutta High School in 1908 and continued in this profession until 1928. He also worked briefly as a kanungo (1914-1917) in the Settlement Department. He joined University of Dhaka, now in Bangladesh as a lecturer in the Bengali and Sanskrit Department in 1928 and retired from there in 1944. His present house is in a state of ruin at Chongarbon. Writing career Mohitlal Majumder made his literary debut through the journal \\"Manasi\\". Later, he contributed regularly to journals such as the Bharati and Shanibarer Chithi. His early poems, written in pleasing rhythms, reflect the aspirations and sorrows of a dreaming youth. Acquainted with Arabic and Persian, he used Arabic and Persian words in his poems. In pre-Nazrul era, he was the user of Arabic and Persian words. His poems are inspired by both aestheticism and spiritualism. Mohitlal early poems reveal the influence of Rabindranath Tagore, but later, as a member of the Shanibarer Chithi group, he distanced himself from the older poet. As a literary critic, Mohitlal attempted to set standards and reveal the problems of art and literature. His psychological and poet-like approach greatly elevated the status of criticism. In writing critiques he used a number of pseudonyms such as Krittivas Ojha, Sabyasachi and Sri Satyasundar Das.

Filmed in Kenya, it was written by Rodney Amateau, based on the 1972 novel by Peter Driscoll. It had a limited release in the US. Plot In apartheid-era South Africa, Shack Twala (played by Sidney Poitier), a black revolutionary who had served time on Robben Island, is freed by Rina van Niekerk (Prunella Gee), his Afrikaner defence attorney, because he would be a victim of retroactive legislation. Rina, estranged from her husband Blane (Rutger Hauer), is having a relationship with an English mining engineer, Jim Keogh (Michael Caine), who has attended Shack's trial. Surprised by the verdict, Rina, Jim and Shack go off to celebrate at her house. They are stopped by policemen who are conducting identity document checks and arresting everyone who does not have their papers on them. As Shack has only just been released from prison he will not receive his papers until the next day. The policeman and Shack antagonise each other leading to Shack being handcuffed and arrested. When Rina attempts to pull the policeman off Shack, the policeman hits her, knocking her to the ground. Jim assaults and knocks out the policeman making all three fugitives. At a police station, a police brigadier (Patrick Allen) is chastised by the racist Major Horn (Nicol Williamson) of the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) for not only arresting Shack but continuing with their random identity checks and arrests that have infuriated world opinion. The three fugitives are followed and monitored by BOSS to lead them to discover their escape route to Botswana and its facilitators, Indian dentists Anil Mukarjee and Persis Ray; a stash of stolen uncut diamonds being used to fund the Black Congress Party and its leader, a man named Wilby Xaba (Joe De Graft). Shack learns that the diamonds are hidden at the bottom of a sinkhole. With Shack and Mukarjee's help, Jim retrieves the diamonds from the sinkhole, but Ray, wanting to use the diamonds to emigrate from South Africa, kills Mukarjee and attempts to rob them of the diamonds. Shack fights Ray to protect the diamonds, and in the commotion she falls into the sinkhole and is killed. Diamonds in hand, they have arranged for Blane, a private pilot, to fly them out of the country, which he does after Rina blackmails him by threatening to make public his drug usage and relationships with black women, illegal in South Africa. The three arrive at the South Africa-Botswana border, where the police, who were there waiting for them, give chase in jeeps. After evading them, they board Blane's aeroplane and are chased by South African Air Force aeroplanes over the border into Botswana. They manage to escape the pursuing aeroplanes and land on a makeshift runway and disembark, with Blane departing in his aeroplane. They make their way to one of the Black Congress Party's camps where they meet many villagers, Wilby Xaba, and armed guards. Suddenly, BOSS agents arrive in a commandeered lorry, kill the guards, and take Wilby prisoner, revealing that he was their real target all along and that the diamonds retrieved from the sinkhole were forgeries. As the BOSS agents attempt to escape with Wilby via helicopter, Shack and the villagers bring down and destroy the helicopter, kill the pilot and all the BOSS agents with the exception of Major Horn, and free Wilby. Horn is disarmed of his pistol and taken prisoner, where he gloats that he will be rescued by the South African Government and that he will continue to pursue them. Jim responds by killing Horn, shooting him with his own pistol.

The station was originally named Blague Gate, having its name changed to Skelmersdale on 8 August 1874 and carried passengers from 1858 to 1956. History A 1908 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (lower right) railways in the vicinity of Skelmersdale The station was one of several built by the East Lancashire Railway on their branch line from Ormskirk to Rainford Junction. It opened on 1 March 1858, but after a year became part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway system when the ELR was taken over by that company. The station consisted of two platforms with the main building on the northbound side. A wooden signal box was provided to control the adjacent level crossing, passing loop and nearby goods yard. The line towards Ormskirk was subsequently doubled in 1875, the year after the station was renamed. Throughout its life the route operated as a self- contained branch, though connections were available for , Liverpool & Blackpool at Ormskirk and for , and Manchester Victoria at Rainford. The service was also generous, with the L&Y; running a steam railmotor service of 19 trains per day in each direction from 1906. A similar pattern continued after the route became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in January 1923, but increasing road competition after World War II and the subsequent nationalisation of the railways in 1948 saw traffic levels decline. The station was closed to passenger traffic by the British Transport Commission on 5 November 1956, with the line south to Rainford closing completely on 16 November 1961 and the rest on 4 November 1963, when goods traffic at the station ceased. The track was lifted in 1968 and station was demolished soon afterwards; the B5312 road (known as Railway Road) now passes through the site. Ironically this was done just as the town was undergoing a significant increase in population levels and associated housing development, having been designated as one of the second wave of new towns in 1961 (it was chosen, along with Runcorn as an overspill town for Liverpool). Reopening proposals Skelmersdale has been described as the largest town in North-West England that doesn't have a railway station, although Leigh in Greater Manchester, which also has no station is larger. There have been many discussions about reopening a railway station in Skelmersdale. This would require a three-mile rail restoration. In January 2009, the Liverpool Echo newspaper reported that recommendations have been put to councillors to endorse the ¬£60m plan to build a new railway station in Skelmersdale, reconnecting the town with Liverpool. In June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies, in its Expanding Access to the Rail Network report, called for funding for the reopening of this station as part of a ¬£500m scheme to open 33 stations on 14 lines closed in the Beeching Axe, including seven new parkway stations. The report proposes extending the line from by laying 3 miles of new single track along the previous route to the town, at a cost estimated to be in the region of ¬£31million. The route is largely intact, though a deviation north of Westhead would be required. The proposed station would be on the north west corner of town near the Skelmersdale Ring Road, right next to where the old station once was. A feasibility study on the project jointly funded by Merseytravel, Merseyrail, Lancashire County Council & West Lancs Borough Council was due to begin in the autumn of 2013. Lancashire County Council approved the initiation of a more detailed evaluation on 1 June 2015. This option selection process will take the project to completing Network Rail's GRIP stage 3 level of development in January 2017. The evaluation is to be developed in partnership with Network Rail and Merseytravel. Network Rail has suggested a construction date commencing in April 2021, with services beginning from December 2023, once the single option development and detailed design stages in the GRIP process have been achieved. The likely route for the new link is southwards to join the Kirkby branch line between Upholland and Rainford rather than the original plans to go north via Ormskirk, so as to enable trains to travel to Wigan & Manchester as well as to Liverpool. In February 2017, Lancashire County Council confirmed that the preferred site for Skelmersdale railway station was the former site of Glenburn Sports College/Westbank Campus.Preferred Site Identified for Skelmersdale Railway Station Lancashire County Council County Council Transport portfolio holder John Fillis said that the site \\"is big enough to provide a high quality station with scope to expand to meet future demand.\\".Preferred site identified for Skelmersdale railway station Southport Visiter By September, Merseytravel announced that they would be committing ¬£765,000 to the study into the reopening, estimating that the station could be open within a decade with a lot of additional funding. Merseytravel's plan would also see a new station built at Headbolt Lane in Kirkby. It has been proposed a new station at Skelmersdale would act as the terminus for Merseyrail's Northern Line, with connections available to Wigan and Manchester. Initial estimates suggest that the scheme could cost around ¬£300 million to develop. On page 36 of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, it states that Merseytravel is currently working with Lancashire County Council and Network Rail to develop a plan to extend the Merseyrail network from Kirkby through to Skelmersdale, with work completed in 2019. They are considering 3rd rail electrification and other alternatives with a new station at Headbolt Lane to serve the Northwood area of Kirkby. The document on page 37 states two trials of electric 3rd rail/battery trains will be undertaken in 2020, this is one of the \\"alternatives\\".http://moderngov.merseytravel.uk.net/documents/s21686/Enc.%201%20for%20Updated%20Long%20term%20Rail%20Strategy.pdf Lancashire County Council approved a plan in May 2019 to commission an outline business case into reopening the station which will be presented to the government.

He also co-founded Nightline. Born in Troon, Ayrshire, Scotland, Hosking studied Russian at King's College, Cambridge, earning an MA, before studying Russian history at Moscow State University. He then studied European history at St. Antony's College, Oxford, before earning a PhD in modern Russian history at Cambridge. He taught at the University of Essex as a Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, and then Reader from 1966 to 1984, before joining SSEES, where he held the established chair of Russian History from 1984 to 2007. He also held a Leverhulme Research Professorship in Russian History at SSEES from 1999 to 2004. He has been a visiting lecturer in political science at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, a research fellow at Columbia University's Russian Institute, and a visiting professor at the University of Cologne. Hosking presented the BBC Reith Lectures in 1988. His aim was to explain the dramatic changes of the Mikhail Gorbachev era in their historical context. Most of Hosking's works until this point had dealt with twentieth-century Russia and the Soviet Union, but after the collapse of the Soviet system he turned his attention to earlier periods of Russian history, producing Russia: People and Empire, 1552-1917 and Russia and the Russians. In these books, Hosking emphasized the polarity between the Russian Imperial idea (denoted by the term 'Rossia') and Russia's ethnic nationhood (defined by the older term of 'Rus'). According to Hosking, the development of the Russian Empire prevented the development of Russia as a nation state. In his next book Rulers and Victims - The Russians in the Soviet Union, Hosking examined aspects of this polarity in the Soviet context. Hosking retired from UCL SSEES in December 2007. The established chair that he held was reinaugurated in 2008 as the Sir Bernard Pares chair of Russian History. Its first incumbent was Hosking's former research student, Simon Dixon.

Jane Brook flows through Parkerville on its way down to the Swan River through John Forrest National Park. History The Nyoongar people were the original custodians of the land. The arrival of British settlers in 1829 on the Swan Coastal Plain eventually led to Nyoongar dispossession in the Hills behind Perth. The Parkerville Suburban Area was made open for selection in June 1895. Parkerville was one of the first stations to be constructed on the railway line that once ran between Bellevue and Mount Helena, opening for traffic in 1896. The Railway Hotel, now the Parkerville Tavern, opened in 1902. The town was named in honour of Stephen Henry Parker whose country home, now the Old Mahogany Inn, was situated nearby. Parker was a prominent member of Perth's legal fraternity. In 1903 Sister Kate of the Community of the Sisters of the Church, purchased of land at Parkerville for the \\"League of Charity Home\\" for children, which became the Parkerville Children's Home. The historic Parkerville Children's Home bush cemetery is located approximately three kilometres east of the Home. Clutterbuck Creek is named after Sister Kate's parents. In 1909 the construction of the chapel was completed. Sally Morgan, in her landmark novel My Place, writes how three-year-old Gladys is taken to this orphanage. In 1966 the railway line was closed as part of a change of route to the Avon Valley. The railway route has become the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail as a bridle and walking path. The Parkerville Amphitheatre owned and operated by John Joseph Jones became the site for a number of 1970s concerts, including John Farnham, Cold Chisel, and Jo Jo Zep and the Falcons. This and other nearby locations have been used for filming children's television series, Parallax. A documentary on the Parkerville Amphitheatre, \\"Sets, Bugs & Rock n Roll\\", by Tempest Productions, was shown at the Revelation Film Festival in Perth in July 2015. By the early 2000s, Perth's suburban growth was placing development pressures on Parkerville.

History The history of Eaton Vance dates from 1924, when Charles F. Eaton Jr., formed Eaton & Howard Inc., a Boston-based investment firm. In 1931, he became the president and director of the company. During its course of existence, the company formed several funds, including the Growth Fund in 1962; it invested primarily in common stocks of companies that enjoyed aggressive growth. In 1979, the firm was bought by Vance Sanders & Company and became Eaton & Howard, Vance Sanders Inc. Two years later, on February 20, 1981, Eaton Vance Corporation was established as a holding company. By the end of 1983, Eaton Vance was managing 23 mutual funds and numerous individual and company accounts with over $2.3 billion in their accounts. The company's major products were 34 low- risk and tax-free funds by late 1989. The next year, Eaton Vance started promoting its funds via banks which resulted in a sales profit of $450 million. As of 1993, over 60 banks in the United States were offering the company's funds. By the end of the year, the firm had management assets worth $12 billion. After restructuring its funds to a \\"hub-and-spoke\\" model, in 1995, Eaton Vance started offering new specialty funds through banks. The new funds were set to invest in companies working in entertainment, telecommunications, and PC industries. Despite the restructuring not showing up to be fruitful, by 1997, the company was managing $14.7 billion in assets most of them coming from overseas including Greater China, Greater India, and some emerging markets. In 2001, Eaton Vance acquired Atlanta Capital Management and Fox Asset Management. The company increased its assets under management by 17%, to $54.6 billion. In 2007, Thomas E. Faust Jr became the CEO and Chairman of the company, replacing James B. Hawkes. By September 2007, the firm owned $158.1 billion in assets under management. In 2012, Easton Vance purchased 49% of Hexavest Inc, a Canadian investment management firm.

The ZiS-151 () was a general-purpose truck produced by the Soviet car manufacturer Automotive Factory No. 2 Zavod imeni Stalina in 1947‚Äì1958. In 1956, the factory was renamed to Zavod imeni Likhacheva, and new trucks were called ZiL-151 (). The ZiS-151 was the first major Soviet military all-wheel- drive truck built following World War II, replacing the imported U.S. Studebaker US6 and the earlier Soviet ZiS-6. In early 1948, the cabs were made of wood, soon replaced with a steel cab. Tens of thousands were produced, including specialized versions for hauling different types of cargo. The Soviets also found the trucks an ideal platform for BM-13 Katyusha rocket launchers. The most famous developments of ZiS-151 were the BTR-152 armored personnel carrier and the BAV 485 amphibious vehicle. In 1958, an improved model, the ZIL-157, was introduced. It differed outwardly by its grille and having single rear tires, instead of the ZiL-151's dual tires. Both models remained in production side by side until 1966. In 1956, the Chinese began license building the ZiS-151 as the Jiefang CA10 at First Automobile Works, with slightly more power and angular front fenders. The improved single tire CA30, introduced in 1958, remained in production until 1986.  Engine and driveline  The ZiS-151 engine, a L-head inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developing at 2600 rpm. The transmission was a 5 speed with a direct 4th gear and overdrive 5th. The transfer case had high and low ranges, and selectively engaged the front axle. Both front and rear axles were a split type.  Chassis  The chassis was 6x6, with three live beam axles, adapted and strengthened for conditions in the USSR. It had a reinforced ladder frame with three live beam axles, the front on semi elliptical leaf springs, the rear tandem on quarter elliptical leaf springs with locating arms. Wheelbase was to the center of the rear bogey and to the center of the rear axle. ZiS-151‚Äôs tires have a larger cross section, versus the US6‚Äôs . Both had dual rear tires. The wider tires spread the load over a wider area. This allows the truck to be operated on softer surfaces. The ZiL-157 has much wider single rear tires. To further increase the footprint, a centralized inflation system allows the tire pressure to be reduced from the cab for soft surfaces, then re-inflated for road use. The drive shafts were laid out like the US6, but as a mirror image, the front axle differential was offset to the left, while American trucks were offset to the right. Air brakes were used, on the ZiL-157 the air system also supplied the centralized inflation system.

Established as British Indian Association of Fiji  The original Association was established in 1911, following a severe hurricane that had brought much hardship to the Indians in the Central division, with the name British Indian Association of Fiji. It was formed by a group that included J.P. Maharaj (a Suva Storekeeper), Totaram Sanadhya (a pundit and social worker from Rewa), Ram Singh (a Suva printer) and Ram Rup. The meeting was chaired by Shriyut Rupram and discussed grievances such as the lack of educated leadership amongst the Indians and the dependence on European lawyers. Totaram Sanadhya was responsible for its Hindi language correspondence.  Under the Leadership of Manilal Doctor  The Indian Imperial Association of Fiji (I.I.A.) came into existence in Fiji on 2 June 1918 after the arrival of Manilal Doctor, who asked for the original name of the association (British Indian Association of Fiji) to be changed because the name had the word \\"British\\" in it and Manilal, being a citizen of Baroda State, was not a British subject. Manilal became the President of the Indian Imperial Association of Fiji and Ram Singh its Secretary. The association contained mainly educated Fiji Indians. It sent petitions to the Government seeking review of marriage law, an end to the death penalty and representation into the Legislative Council. The aim of the association was to 'watch the interests of and to assist in the general improvement of the Indian community in Fiji'. As president of the I.I.A., Manilal Doctor wrote to Gandhi, other Indian leaders and the British Labour Party on the sad plight of Indian indentured labourers in Fiji. C.F. Andrews and W.W. Pearson were dispatched to Fiji to enquire into the complaints. Manilal Doctor made submissions for their report, published on 29 February 1916, which reported on the deplorable living conditions of the indentured labourers and their lack of access to education and medical facilities.  Accomplishments  The case of Viraswamy is an example of the success of I.I.A. Viraswamy was an educated young man, who had been recruited in Madras on the understanding that he would be working on a post officer in the government office. When he arrived in Fiji in October 1911, he was sent to work with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. He was initially employed as a telephone operator, but when he complained that he was not being given the promised job, he was sent to work in a cane field. He wrote to the I.I.A. and Manilal Doctor forwarded his case to the Anti-Slavery Society of London. The Society approached the Colonial Office and Veeraswamy was able to buy his freedom and get employment outside the indenture system. After the appointment of Badri Maharaj as the nominated member representing Indians in the Legislative Council (Fiji), the I.I.A. took on the role of an opposition party because Badri Maharaj had little support amongst the Fiji Indians. The I.I.A. was allowed to present an address of welcome to Admiral Lord Jellicoe, on behalf of the Indian community, during his visit to Fiji in 1919. On 26 December 1919, the Association organised a conference in the Suva Town Hall, which Manilal chaired and which passed a number of resolutions, including a call for independence for India, sympathy for the victims of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and other resolutions relating to Fiji Indians. On 29 December 1919 the Association sent a list of request to the government which included the following: # Immediate cancellation of all remaining indenture agreements # Repeal of the Masters and servants ordinance # Improved educational facilities # Training of Indian medical officers like the Fijians # Permission to repatriate gold sovereigns # Establishment of sugar-cane board # Abolition of hut tax and hawkers licences # Agricultural training and financial help for Co-operative credit societies or agricultural banks # Better pay for skilled Indian workers such as locomotive drivers and those handling dangerous machinery # Worker's compensation # Better roads to Indian settlements # Easier acquisition of land without distinction of race # Better railway and steamship facilities # Amendment to municipal ordinances to enable most Indian ratepayers to vote # Amendment to all Fiji's ordinances to enable Indians to do most of the things permitted to Europeans only. The Colonial Secretary, ignored the requests.  The Demise of I.I.A.  Following, the strike of 1920, and after the Government decided to deport Manilal, the I.I.A. organised petitions in different languages, asking for him to be allowed to stay in Fiji. After Manilal was deported from Fiji in 1920, the I.I.A. collapsed. In the 1920s attempts were made to revive the I.I.A., having representatives from all sections of the Indian community, with Ilahi Ramjan as President, Ram Singh as Secretary and Deoki and Ram Samujh as vice-presidents. It made representations to the Secretary of State for the Colonies about residential tax and other issues, but the Government regarded it as representing only the urban educated Indians and refused to recognise it. It thus died a natural death, although attempts were made in later years to establish a similar association.

The Quraysh in Mecca was Muhammad's final major rival in the Arabian Peninsula, and following the conquest, Muhammad focused his military operations on further expansion of his Islamic realm to the north, with a campaign against the Ghassanids and the Byzantine Empire. Muhammad died on 8 June 632. The period following his death, known as the first fitna, was one of significant divide in the Islamic world, characterized by internal conflict between the Muslims caused by the issue of succession to Muhammad, further worsening the Shia-Sunni divide.  Background  This period was preceded by that of Muhammad in Medina, and began after the Conquest of Mecca, which was the result of the violation of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, signed between the Muslims and the Quraysh as a 9 year, 9 month and 9 day armistice in the year 629. = Treaty of Hudaybiyyah = The Treaty of Hudaybiyyah was a pact signed between Muhammad and the Quraysh in the year 629, following Muhammad's departure from Medina to perform the Umrah pilgrimage. After taking an unconventional route around Mecca, Muhammad and his companions encamped at Hudaybiyyah, and the treaty was drafted, signed and ratified here. It was presented as a 9 year, 9 month and 9 day armistice between the Muslims, the Quraysh, and their allies. Less than two years later, the tribe of Banu Bakr, which was allied with the Quraysh, broke the treaty when they attacked the Banu Khuza'ah, who were allied with the Muslims. Muhammad gave the violators 4 months to reconsider their position and demanded retributive justice for the victims. After this 4-month period expired, Muhammad marched with a 10,000-strong army toward Mecca. History =Conquest of Mecca= Muhammad led around 10,000 of his companions toward Mecca in Ramadan 8 AH, which could correspond to December 629 or January 630. Abu Sufyan, leader of the Quraysh in Mecca, aware that Mecca could not prepare a force matching the strength of Muhammad's, left for Medina in an attempt to restore the treaty, but Muhammad refused to accommodate him, and Abu Sufyan returned to Mecca. He later negotiated a bloodless transfer-of-power of Mecca from the Quraysh and converted to Islam K. Armstrong, Muhammad: A Biography of the Prophet (London: Phoenix, 2001 ed.), p. 642. Muhammad acted generously to the Meccans, demanding only that the pagan idols in and around the Kaaba be destroyed. Battle of Hunayn The Battle of Hunain was fought between Muhammad and his followers against the Bedouin tribe of Hawazin and its subsection the Thaqif in 630 in a valley on one of the roads leading from Mecca to al-Ta'if. The battle ended in a decisive victory for the Muslims, who captured enormous spoils. The Battle of Hunayn is one of only two battles mentioned in the Qur'an by name, in Sura. The Hawazin and their allies, the Thaqif, began mobilizing their forces when they learnt from their spies that Muhammad and his army had departed from Medina to begin an assault on Mecca. The confederates apparently hoped to attack the Muslim army while it besieged Mecca. Muhammad, however, uncovered their intentions through his own spies in the camp of the Hawazin, and marched against the Hawazin just two weeks after the conquest of Mecca with a force of 12,000 men. Only four weeks had elapsed since quitting Medina. The Bedouin commander Malik ibn Awf al-Nasri ambushed the Muslims at a place where the road to al-Taif enters winding gorges; the Muslims, surprised by the assault of the Bedouin cavalry, who they thought were encamped at Awtas, began retreating in disarray. Modern historians have been unable to fully reconstruct the course of the battle from this point onwards because the different Muslim sources describing the battle give contradictory accounts. Because Malik ibn Awf al-Nasri had brought the families and flocks of the Hawazin along, the Muslims were able to capture huge spoils, consisting of 6,000 women and children and 24,000 camels. Some Bedouins fled, and split into two groups. One group went back, resulting in the Battle of Autas, while the larger group found refuge at al-Ta'if, where Muhammad besieged them.but we gaming Siege of Ta'if The Siege of Taif took place in 630 CE, as the Muslims besieged the city of Taif after their victory in the Battle of Hunayn and Autas. However, the city did not succumb to the siege. One of their chieftains, Urwah ibn Mas'ud, was absent in Yemen during that siege. 10 AHHadith of Mubahela =631 CE= Battle of Tabouk The Battle of Tabouk (also called the Battle of Tabuk) was a military expedition said to have been led by Muhammed in October 630 CE. According to Muslim biographies, Muhammed led a force of as many as 30,000 north to Tabouk in present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia, with the intention of engaging the Byzantine army. Though not a battle in the typical sense, if historical the event would represent the opening conflict in the coming Byzantine-Arab wars. There is no contemporary Byzantine account of the events, and much of the details come from later Muslim sources. Noting this, as well as the fact that the armies never met, some Western scholars have questioned the authenticity of the details surrounding the event; though in the Arab world it is widely held as historical. Ghassanids The Ghassanids were a group of South Arabian Christian tribes that emigrated in the early 3rd century from Yemen to the Hauran in southern Syria, Jordan and the Holy Land where some intermarried[dubious ‚Äì discuss] with Hellenized Roman settlers and Greek-speaking Early Christian communities. The term GhassƒÅn refers to the kingdom of the Ghassanids. Thaqif adopts Islam Thaqif, the main tribe of the town of Ta'if, adopted Islam in 632, which was exciting since they were beaten in the battle of Hunayn against the Muslims. =632=  Thursday, June 4  Muhammad's will Muhammad became ill and his health took a serious turn on a Thursday. He summoned his companions and announced that he wanted to write a will, he asked for writing materials to write a statement that would \\"prevent the Muslim nation from going astray for ever\\". The first person to reply was Umar, answering that there was no need for any will, arguing that Muhammad was ill and that Umar had the Qur'an which was sufficient for him.  Saturday, June 6  Usama's dispatchment Muhammad had earlier sent an expedition against the Byzantine Empire (Roman) that resulted in what was known as the Battle of Mut'ah. The leader of that expedition was the dark-colored Zayd ibn Haritha, Muhammad's former adopted son. Zayd died during that expedition.  Monday, June 8  death He died on Monday, June 8, 632 A.D/ 12 Rabi' ul-Awwal, 11 A.H. Aftermath This period was followed by the period of the Succession to Muhammad.

Because among Arab authors, he is almost alone in speaking the truth.\\" In a favorable review, Publishers Weekly opined that while some of the material in Aburish's Saddam Hussein was \\"controversial,\\" Aburish's account was \\"detailed, balanced,\\" and \\"credible\\" given \\"Aburish's extensive contacts in the Arab world.\\" Publishers Weekly called Aburish's prose \\"appropriately dramatic but not sensational.\\" Elie Podeh, reviewing Aburish's Nasser for the International Journal of Middle East Studies, criticized Aburish for \\"factual mistakes\\" and \\"misuse of sources,\\" stating that \\"Aburish has ignored new sources ... based on declassified archival material\\" in favor of \\"outdated studies as well as several biased interviews, which he accepts at face value.\\" While acknowledging that Nasser \\"may be a good introduction to readers unfamiliar with the subject,\\" Podeh commented \\"serious students ... will have to wait for another biography.\\" BibliographyAburish, Said K.: Children of Bethany: The Story of a Palestinian Family, Indiana University Press 1988. *Aburish, Said K.: The St. Georges Hotel Bar, International Intrigue in Old Beirut, An Insider's Account, London, Bloomsbury Publishing, 1989. *Aburish, Said K.: Cry Palestine: inside the West Bank, Bloomsbury, London 1991. *Aburish, Said K.: The Forgotten Faithful: the Christians of the Holy Land, Quartet, London, 1993. *Aburish, Said K.: Rise, Corruption and Coming Fall of the House of Saud, Bloomsbury, London, 1994. *Aburish, Said K.: A Brutal Friendship: The West and the Arab Elite, Victor Gollancz Ltd, London, 1997. *Aburish, Said K.: Arafat: From Defender to Dictator, Bloomsbury Pub.

The village is 2.8 miles (4.5 km) south of Alton, on the A32 road, close to a source of the River Wey. The village has two parts, the larger being Upper Farringdon. Lower Farringdon is on the Alton to Gosport road, the A32. The 2001 census predicted a population for Farringdon Parish by 2006 of 495 increasing to 664 at the 2011 Census . The northern of the River Wey's two sources rises in countryside close to Farringdon (Grid Reference: SU707394). History Archaeological finds in the village include a Bronze Age beaker (found in September 1938) with a cruciform design on the base, of which only two examples are known; and a Roman coin, a Sestertius of Trajan (found in 1936). Both are now in Alton Museum. Farringdon was listed in the Domesday Book as Ferendone; the word means fern-covered hill. The village has a Norman church and a number of pre-18th Century houses. Notable people and buildings Farringdon has close associations with two of Britain's most celebrated figures, the novelist Jane Austen (1775-1817) and the naturalist Gilbert White (1720-1793). Austen would come from her home in nearby Chawton, a little over a mile to the north, to visit friends and acquaintances in Farringdon. From 1761 to 1785 White was curate of Farringdon's village church of All Saints, and his pulpit still survives. One of the parish registers contains entries in his handwriting. Gilbert White's house, now a museum, is a little over three miles west of Farringdon. All Saints has Norman and 12th/13th century origins and retains good stained windows. The churchyard contains yew trees reputed to be of great antiquity; the hollow nature of the trees makes ring-counting dating impossible, but estimates have suggested that the trees may be as much as 2,000 years old. A Farringdon landmark is Massey's Folly, an imposing but eccentric building with towers and battlements built by another curate of Farringdon, Rev. T.H. Massey. Its intended purpose during its construction was obscure, but since a few years after the Reverend's death in 1919 it has served as a school and village hall and featured in the 2006 BBC TV programme, Restoration Village. Massey's Folly is in the process of being sold for development as residential units. The Rev Massey also built a vicarage in the village (now a private house).http://www.farringdon.biz The very first Cadbury Milk Tray advert was filmed in Lower Farringdon, by Woodside Road, along the old Meon Valley Railway. The famous Beagley brothers (Thomas, Henry and John), who all represented Hampshire at cricket (Thomas even played for England), all came from the village. Their roots in the Alton area predate the Elizabethan era. Transport Farringdon's closest railway station is at Alton, 2.8 miles (4.5 km) north of the village. The A32 passing through Lower Farringdon was formerly a major route, but the old Alton-Gosport road is passed to the west and east by two major trunk routes, the M3 and the A3(M). As result, traffic density through Farringdon is relatively light. A 30 mph limit is in force.

Description 68088 at Loughborough Introduced in 1888 by Thomas W. Worsdell, six were built in 1888. Their simple, bare design easily navigated the tight curves and poor quality track which they ran on. The H proved so successful, that the NER ordered a further ten in 1891, three in 1897 and five more were ordered by the LNER in 1923. Coal was carried in side bunkers incorporated into the side tanks. The absence of a rear bunker and the small size of the cab provided the driver with a clear view of the buffer bar when reversing onto a train. The H shared their simple domeless boiler design with the H1 (J78) and H2 (J79) classes. The locos were originally fitted with dumb buffers, but these were changed for small round buffers during the 1930s, some also gaining vacuum brakes during this period; only hand and steam brakes were fitted when built. Locomotives operating at Tyne Dock were altered to take shunting poles on each corner of the loco, giving the ability to pull a wagon on an adjacent line. Numbering and livery The LNER originally painted the Y7s in black with ¬ºinch vermillion lining; repaints after 1928 omitted this with locomotives in plain black. Two entered British Railways stock in 1948, becoming BR 68088 and 68089. Operation and preservation The original work of these locos was on Tyneside, at Hull docks, and within Darlington works, but LNER no.8088 was recorded working at Stratford works between 1943 and 1952. Dock work was hit hard by the depression, and between 1929 and 1932 the sixteen locomotives which made up the first two batches delivered were withdrawn, nine being sold to industrial use while the remainder were scrapped. Two have survived to preservation: *NER No. 1310 (Gateshead, 1891), was withdrawn in 1931 and sold to Robert Frazer & Sons, and sold on to Pelaw Main Collieries Limited in 1933. It passed to the National Coal Board in 1949, who renumbered it 63. In 1965, it was bought by the Steam Power Trust, and has been located at the Middleton Railway since 1965. *LNER No. 985 (Darlington, 1923), was renumbered 8088 by the LNER in 1946. It passed to British Railways in 1948, who renumbered it as 68088, and transferred it to the Eastern Region departmental fleet. It was sold to the National Coal Board in November 1952 and worked at Bentick and Thurgaton Collieries until 1964 when it was purchased by the Y7 Preservation Society.

According to the rules of the game, the right to select the first card to play (the opening lead) belongs to the defenders; afterwards, the right to lead belongs to the hand who has won the previous trick. Being on lead generally presents an advantage, as it presents an opportunity to choose a suit and card which will develop a trick for the leader's side. However, in endplay situations being on lead certainly does not present an advantage‚Äîquite the opposite. The tempo can be used for many purposes:Thomas's Bridge Fantasia * Setting up tricks ‚Äì for example, against notrump contracts, defenders will often lead the longest and strongest suit, to set up the tricks in that suit. Against trump contracts, lead of a short suit can set up a subsequent ruff before the declarer can draw trumps. * Pitching losers ‚Äì for example, having x opposite AKQx, the declarer may discard cards from another suit on the honors, holding xxx opposite xxx if on lead; if the opponents were on lead, they can cash the tricks in the declarer's weak suit. * Taking tricks ‚Äì the converse of pitching losers. Having the lead lets us take our tricks before the other side gets to pitch in the suit(s). * Trump promotion or coup en passant ‚Äì if the other side had the lead, they could simply draw trumps; however, with our side on lead, an extra trump trick can be produced. * Killing entries ‚Äì opponents can be forced to use entries in the wrong order. Examples In this extreme example, whoever leads first will take the first 8 tricks, regardless of the denomination. That means that neither side can make any contract, and every contract will fail by at least two tricks‚Äîthe advantage of having on opening lead makes a three- trick difference. Keeping initiative‚Äîgaining tempo‚Äîby not taking a finesse can be decisive to prevent the opponents from developing defensive tricks. Against South's 4 west leads the A (indicating the king) and continues with the 8. The opening lead, although natural, was unfortunate, as it gave the declarer a tempo to develop heart tricks for himself. However, it is now essential not to take the diamond finesse so as not to lose tempo. South must take the A and play to the A, again refraining from finessing. Now, the declarer can lead hearts for ruffing finesse and discard diamonds until West covers with the K, then ruff and cross over to A, again refusing to finesse. On the remaining hearts, all diamonds including the queen are discarded. In total, the declarer loses one trick in trumps, hearts and clubs each. Note that a diamond opening lead sets the contract, as it doesn't give the tempo in hearts to the declarer: the declarer must lose a heart and two diamonds before he sets up the hearts for diamond discards; the trump king is the fourth trick for the defense. Ethics It is important that the defenders establish a rhythmic tempo to their play. For example, if declarer is attempting to locate a particular card, such as an adversely held ace or queen, he may conclude which opponent is most likely to have it based upon a hesitation by that opponent. While the declarer may take advantage of such a hesitation at his own risk, an opponent who deliberately hesitates before making a play with intent to deceive the declarer is guilty of unethical conduct under the of the game and is subject to penalty.

Ge≈çgraphik·∏ï Hyph·∏ógƒìsis, 2:10:8 and as Bocontii on the Tabula Peutingeriana.Tabula Peutingeriana, 2:1 The name Vocontii probably stems from Gaulish Uo-conti ('twenty', perhaps 'twenty-hundred'), after a Gaulish custom of including numbers in tribal names (see Tri-corii, Petru-corii, the 'three-', 'four-tribes'). Geography = Territory = The territory of the Vocontii was bordered in the north by the Is√®re river, in the west by the valley of the Rh√¥ne river, in the south by the Mont Ventoux and the lower reaches of the Durance river, and in the east by the upper reaches of the Durance. They lived south of the Allobroges, east of the Segovellauni and the Cavares, and north of the Salluvii. = Settlements = During the Roman period, the Vocontii became a civitas foederata and had two capitals: Vasio (Vaison-la-Romaine) and Lucus Augusti (Luc-en-Diois), both benefiting from a ius Latii. The Roman town of Noviomagus was probably Nyons. This town and Vasio (Vaison-la-Romaine) were not on the mountains. They were at the foot of the first prealpine ridges, at the edge of the plain of the Rh√¥ne (the Dentelles de Montmirail were just to the south of Vasio; the √âssaillon, Garde- Grosse, Saint Jaumes and Vaux formed a half crescent by Noviomagus). History During the 4th century BCE, the Celtic Vocontii became settled there, with an oppidum south of modern Vaison (Garcia p. 168); this seems to have been used to control trade between the Rh√¥ne and Durance rivers (Meffre). The earliest historical mention of the Vocontii is from 218 BCE during the crossing of the Alps by Hannibal, as recounted in Livy: :After composing the dissensions of the Allobroges, when he now was proceeding to the Alps, he directed his course thither, not by the straight road, but turned to the left into the country of the Tricastini, thence by the extreme boundary of the territory of the Vocontii he proceeded to the Tricorii; his way not being anywhere obstructed until he came to the river Druentia.Livy, The Hisrory of Rome from its Foundation, 21.31 In 121 BC The Vocontii were defeated by Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, a Roman consul, in 125 BCE and by Gaius Sextius Calvinus, a Roman proconsul, in 123 BCE during military campaigns against the Ligurians and Salluvii who lived to their south.Livy, Periochae, 60.1; 61.1Ebel, C. Transalpine Gaul. The emergence of a Roman province, pp. 72-73 In 121 BC Quintus Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus defeated the Allobroges, who lived to the north of the Vocontii, and the Averni, who lived to the west of the River Rh√¥ne.Livy, Periochae, 61.5Florus> Florus, Epitome of Roman History, 37.4-6Strabo, Geography, 4.2.3 In 118 BC Gnaeus Domitius founded a Roman colony at Narbo, near Hispania.Velleius Paterculus, Roman History, 15.5 Southern Gaul came under Roman control and was known as Gallia Transalpina. Over time it came to be organised as a province of the Roman Empire.Badian, E. ‚ÄúNotes on Provincia Gallia in the Late Republic.‚Äù In M√©langes d'arch√©ologie et d'histoire offerts √† Andr√© Piganiol, vol. 2, pp. 901-03 With the reorganisation of the provinces of the Roman Empire under Augustus, Gallia Transalpina was renamed Gallia Narbonensis. It was named after Narbo, which became its capital. Pliny the Elder, who wrote in the 70s AD, referred to the Vocontii as allies.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, 3.37 This means that they were not turned into Roman subjects. They remained autonomous. They were allowed to continue to observe their own laws and did not have to pay a tribute. However, they had to supply auxiliary soldiers to Rome. The date of the grant of an alliance treaty (foedus) is unknown. Goudineau had speculated that it may have been made by Gaius Pomptinus after he suppressed the last rebellion of the Allobroges in 61 BCE when he was the governor of Gallia TransalpinaGoudineau, C., Les fouilles de la Maison du Dauphin a Vaison-la-Romaine, in (Suppl. XXXVII to Gallia), 1979, pp.251-64 However, this is not certain. Pliny also named the town of Vasio in his record of people and places which had Latin rights. When Marcus Fonteius, was governor of Gallia Transalpina, either in 76-74 or 74-72 BC, he was attacked by the Vocontii. He defeated them.Cicero, For Fonteius, 20 Cicero did not say why they rebelled. Presumably this was connected to the heavy indebtedness with was incurred by the Gauls in the region which was due to taxes which were levied by Fonteius to raise money for the Roman troops which were fighting in the Sertorian War (80-72 BCE) in Hispania. Pompey, one of the commanders in that war, had crossed Gaul to go to Hispania and subdued some (unspecified) rebellious tribes there. Pompey used Gallia Transalpina, which was on the road to Hispania and, therefore, his line of communications, as a base for his operations in the Iberian Peninsula. He wintered in Gaul in 75/74 BCE. Fonteius also raised corn for the Roman troops and a Gallic cavalry to support them.Cicero, Pro Fonteius, 17, 20Ebel, C. Transalpine Gaul. The emergence of a Roman province, pp. 78-81 The Vocontii were mentioned by Julius Caesar (note that Further Province and Hither Province stand for Gallia Transalpina and Gallia Cisalpina; the latter was in northern Italy) : :... Here (in the Alps) the Ceutrones and the Graioceli and the Caturiges, having taken possession of the higher parts, attempt to obstruct the army in their march. After having routed these in several battles, he arrives in the territories of the Vocontii in the Further Province on the seventh day from Ocelum, which is the most remote town of the Hither Province; thence he leads his army into the country of the Allobroges,...Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War, 1.10 Caesar was marching from Italy to the vicinity of Lake Geneva to confront the Helvetii. The historian Pompeius Trogus was a Vocontian. His grandfather served in the army of Pompey in Hispania during the Sertorian War .Justinus, Epitome of Trogus' Philippic Histories, 43.3.47, 43.5.11 The Vocontii are later mentioned by Tacitus (Histories, in relation to the Revolt of Vitellius, which took place in 69 CE: :The army then proceeded by slow marches through the territory of the Allobroges and Vocontii, the very length of each day's march and the changes of encampment being made a matter of traffic by the general, who concluded disgraceful bargains to the injury of the holders of land and the magistrates of the different states, and used such menaces, that at Lucus, a municipal town of the Vocontii, he was on the point of setting fire to the place, when a present of money soothed his rage.Tacitus, Histories, 1.66 The administrative reforms of Diocletian (reigned 284-305) abolished the old provinces and created new, smaller ones. The number of provinces was doubled. The Roman towns built on the site of or near Vocontian settlements close to the Rh√¥ne, Vasio and Noviomagus, and those on the River Dr√¥me, Dia Augusta and Lucius Augustii, came under the Provincia Viennensis. Segusturo, and the area in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department came under the Provincia Narbonensis II Rivet gives an account of the archaeological finds in Roman towns in Vocontian territory.Rivet, Albert Lionel Frederick,Gallia Narbonensis: Southern Gaul in Roman Times, pp.286-99 These towns were: Dea Auguta and Lucus Augustii were in the north, on the River Dr√¥me. Vasio and Noviomagus were on the southwestern edge of Vocontian territory. Segusturo was in the southeast, on the River Durance. *Dea Auguta (Die). At some point it took over control of the northern region from Lucus Augustii. It was a substantial settlement which owed its prosperity to its position on a main route from the Rh√¥ne to Italy. Its importance is shown by the fact that it had two aqueducts. One was seven km long and came from the northeast. The other was five km long and came from the southeast. It is not clear when it first became a bishopric. It is possible that Nicasius, who attended the Council of Nicaea in 325 came from Dea. *Lucus Augustii (Luc-en- Diois). Only two inscriptions have been found, one dedicated to Mercury and the other to Dea Augusta Andarta, the dominant local deity. *Noviomagus, which was most probably Nyons. Ptolemy attributed the town to the Tricastini. Archaeology has not yielded much, and the plan of the town is unknown. Mosaics, statues and funerary inscriptions have been found. *Vasio (Vaison-la- Romaine). The pre-Roman settlement must have been an Oppidum. The Roman town was built on the other bank of the river. It was in Pomponius Mela's list of wealthy towns. It had a theatre capable of seating 7,000 people, several public baths and an aqueduct. It was laid out in the formal Roman way. The oldest traces of buildings, which were slightly improved in 20-30 BCE and reconstructed in fully Roman style in the Flavian period (69-96 BCE), go back to the 40-30 BCE. *Segusturo (Sisteron). Excavations have not unearthed much. A second century funerary monument, a few fourth century graves and traces of some buildings have been found. One finds a praetor and a senate leading the city of Vaison, assisted by praefecti sent to the surrounding districts (pagi), which were advised by local assemblies (vigintiviri). Public municipal officials and slaves supplemented this administrative system.Meffre, JC, L'√Çge du Fer dans la r√©gion de Vaison, pp. 213‚Äì215 Military unit A 500-strong auxiliary cavalry unit, the Ala Augusta Vocontiorum civium Romanorum, was raised among the Vocontii. The troopers were Roman citizens. From 122, after service in Germania Inferior, it served at Trimontium, a mixed cavalry and infantry fort near Newstead, Scottish Borders. The unit is known by an inscription, (RIB 2121): :Campestr(ibus) / sacrum Ael(ius) / Marcus / dec(urio) alae Aug(ustae) / Vocontio(rum) / v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) l(aetus) m(erito) (To the sacred Goddesses of the Parade-Ground, Aelius Marcius, decurion¬π of the Vocontian Wing, willingly, gladly and deservedly fulfilled his vow.) This is also attested in two military diplomas, dated 122 and 126; the former from Brigetio in Pannonia (CIL XVI, 65) and the latter from Britannia (AE 1997.1779a).

It lies on the west bank of the River Whitewater, 6 miles east of Basingstoke and 1.5 miles west of Odiham. The area is popular with walkers and cyclists. Many photographers also take pictures of some of the local architecture. There are 29 Grade II listed buildings or entries in the area, and 2 Grade II* listed buildings. The nearby medieval Odiham Castle is of historical interest. At the centre of the village is the Fox and Goose public house. History The village was not recorded in the Domesday Book, possibly being considered part of the manor of Odiham. Becoming a separate manor in the 13th century, it was sold to Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, and the first Governor General of Canada in 1786, and has stayed in that family ever since. Originally a Saxon hunting settlement, the village's economy is rooted in agriculture and more latterly timber, which flourished at the same time as the Basingstoke Canal. Built at the end of the 18th century, it runs through and under Greywell. However, the canal was never a commercial success and was soon overtaken by the advent of the railway; by the turn of the last century it had fallen into disuse. These days, agriculture remains the most important local industry, but most residents work elsewhere, commute to London or are retired. Greywell Hill House In the 17th century, Nateley and Greywell manors were owned by the Zouche family of Bramshill, then the Henley family. The 876 acres of Greywell Manor were bought in 1787 by Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, former Governor General of Quebec. Trustees who purchased the Manor for Guy Carleton described it as \\"A delightful spot... charming hills much woods, good water, a small river in the bottom with good Trout... the Farm buildings in most excellent condition.\\" There were three farms in the Manor, of which Grewell Farm was probably the least significant. An estate survey of 1788 shows the line of the tunnel for the Basingstoke Canal which crosses the north of the estate. The farm was tenanted, Guy Carleton choosing to live at Kempshott nearby and then in Middlesex. He died in 1808 and it was not until around 1824 when the farm had become a gentleman's residence that Arthur Henry Carleton, 2nd Lord Dorchester, finally moved in. The Greenwood map, 1826, indicates that a formal garden has been started and it is clear that a gentleman's residence would have had pleasure grounds as well. The Tithe map of 1842 shows a mansion, approach drive, stable block, grounds and a surrounding park. The 1st edition OS maps show a partly walled kitchen garden as well as lawns and features such as a fountain and a pond. An old chalk pit to the east of the approach drive has become The Dell. Footpaths lead through the park and there has been much planting of trees in the parkland. An article in the Gardeners' Chronicle, 1907, indicates that the period 1870s ‚Äì 1890s there was a great deal of planting both of plants and trees. A Dutch garden is described in what was originally the chalk pit (shown on early, old maps). The title of Lord Dorchester became extinct in 1897, but Henrietta Anne Carleton (by then Mrs Leir-Carleton), daughter of the last Lord Dorchester, applied for reinstatement of the title, which was granted by Queen Victoria in 1899. Henrietta then became the 1st Baroness Dorchester. In its turn, this title became extinct in 1963 when Henrietta's son from her first marriage to Francis Paynton Pigott, died. However, their daughter had already married William James Harris, 6th Earl of Malmesbury. In 2000, William James Harris died and James Carleton Harris became 7th Earl of Malmesbury thus a direct heir of Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester. He is the current owner of Greywell Hill House. St Mary's Church Greywell's church, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, is an ancient structure of flint with stone quoins and dressings in the Norman and early English styles. It consists of a chancel, nave, porch and tower surmounted by wooden belfry containing four bells. At the time of the Domesday Survey in 1086 it is thought that the Chapel of St.Mary, beside the Whitewater, was one of the two churches within the Manor of Odiham mentioned in the survey. The church is of Norman origin and was built in the 12th century. St Mary's Church, Greywell Restored in 1870, it still boasts many old features, the most important of which is the early 16th century rood-screen, made of carved oak which before the restoration was used as a men's gallery with rood loft and circular stairs. The narrow 13th-century Early English chancel arch is also a prominent feature, while on the stonework to the left outside the church door there are visible remains of several consecration crosses dating back to the period of the Crusades. Church Cottage, beside the lych-gate on The Street, is believed to have been originally the priest's lodgings. St Mary's Church in Greywell is part of the United Parish of Newnham with Nately Scures with Mapledurwell with Up Nately with Greywell, which in turn is part of the North Hampshire Downs Benefice in the Church of England Diocese of Winchester. Greywell is within the Anglican United Parish, which is served by St Swithun's, Nately Scures. Greywell Tunnel Eastern portal of the Greywell Tunnel, in Greywell village The Basingstoke Canal runs beneath the village through the Greywell Tunnel, a tunnel built in the late 18th century. The last commercial passage of the tunnel was in 1914; a roof fall in 1932 led to the tunnel becoming totally blocked. The disused western portal of the tunnel is the largest winter bat roost in the UK, and is the second largest colony of Natterer's bat in Europe. Along with Greywell Moors, the tunnel and its bat colony form one of two Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the area. A short section of the canal still in water, leading from the western tunnel portal with the original towpath, is maintained as a nature reserve.

It lies on the border of the New Forest, overlooking the valley of the River Avon. The village is about north-east of the town of Fordingbridge, and about south of the city of Salisbury. Within the parish stands Hale House, a large 18th-century mansion which was the country house of architect Thomas Archer, who also rebuilt Hale church in 1717. Overview Hale is a village to the northeast of Fordingbridge in an area of woodland, to the east of the River Avon. It is a scattered community with some thatched cottages around the green, a village hall, and a Victorian school building which still houses the primary school. At the centre of the village is Hatchet Green, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Conservation Area.Hale Parish Council It contains various tree species including oak, ash, birch, holly, lawson cypress, chestnut and hawthorn. It was taken over by the Parish Council in 1975 because no owner could be traced. History The manor of Hale does not appear in the Domesday Book of 1086. However, there was a hide of land in nearby Charford held of the King by Alwi son of Torber.Victoria County History of Hampshire: Hale Alwi was also holding West Tytherley at the time of the Domesday Book, and since Richard de Cardenvill, at the beginning of the 13th century, was holding Hale and West Tytherley of the King it is possible that this Charford estate was Hale. In the 14th century Hale passed by marriage to Sir Robert Brent of Cossington, in whose family the manor remained for about two centuries. Hale was probably sold to one of the Penruddocks in the 16th century. Thus Robert Penruddock, who died childless in 1583, evidently had a lease of the manor and was the first of the family to settle at Hale. Around this time the original mediaeval church was substantially rebuilt,History of Hale and there is a brass on the floor of the church to Sir John Penruddock, who died 8 March 1600. In 1631 the classical architect Inigo Jones was commissioned by Sir John Penruddock to remodel the medieval church or St Mary's in Hale as a Tuscan temple along the lines of St Paul's, Covent Garden. It has long been suspected that the church was Jones's, but the proof was only recently discovered by Kate Bennett in a manuscript in the Bodleian Library recording a Latin inscription in the hands of the Penruddock family attributing the church to Jones. (See also Dianne Duggan, 2003, 'Hale Church and St Paul's Church, Covent Garden', Hampshire Studies 58, published by the Hampshire Field Club and Archaeological Society.) Hale passed by marriage into the Gage family, until Thomas Gage, 1st Viscount Gage of Castlebar in Ireland, apparently sold the manor between 1713 and 1720 to Thomas Archer, Groom Porter to Queen Anne, who at the latter date was licensed to inclose two roads in Hale between South Charford and Woodgreen. Archer demolished the Penruddock's Elizabethan Manor House and built the Palladian style Georgian Mansion which is here today. He also altered and enlarged the church, landscaped the grounds and planted the oldest part of the Lime Avenue. Andrew Archer, 2nd Baron Archer held it before his death in 1778, his heirs being his three daughters. The May family took over in 1789, and the Goff family bought Hale in 1836. Joseph Goff endowed the village school in 1873. The civil parish of Hale was formed in 1895. Until 1920, Hale was one large estate, and the village was effectively closed to outsiders, with no inn and no shops. In 1920, the estate was divided up and sold in lots. Hale House and its surrounding park still survives as the nucleus of the old estate. Hale Park To the west of Hale is Hale Park, home to a Palladian style Georgian Mansion, built by Thomas Archer around 1715 and added to over the years. The village church is to the north-west of the house. It is dedicated to Saint Mary. It is mostly 18th-century in date, but with its 17th-century nave and chancel retained. The house is now owned by Mr Patrick Hickman . He purchased the house and grounds in 1974 Hale Purlieu Next to Hale is the National Trust common of Hale Purlieu. Hale Purlieu is an area of heath and valley bog with typical flora and fauna. It was for centuries outside of the New Forest ‚Äì the word \\"purlieu\\" means an area which has been \\"disafforested\\" and is not subject to forest law.

The dam holds approximately 520 million litres of water. Location It is located off Rosedale Road in Chidlow, about 45 minutes from Perth by car in the Perth Hills. History Lake Leschenaultia is a man-made lake constructed c.1897 as key infrastructure for the Western Australian Government Railways. It is the largest reservoir constructed on the Eastern Railway line and supplied water to steam trains for almost 50 years. Since 1949 it has been used as a recreation area for both locals, interstate and overseas visitors. Many locals learned to swim at the Lake, especially before the 1960s when there were no public swimming pools available locally. In 2005, Lake Leschenaultia gained a heritage listing based on the railway history, recreational significance and other factors. In 2006, the 40m timber jetty (constructed in 1971) was removed due to safety issues and has since been replaced with a pontoon. Since early in 2007, Lake Leschenaultia has been the venue for the monthly local market. The name \\"Leschenaultia\\" comes from the lake colour's resemblance to the Blue Leschenaultia flower.

Origins Fortescue was the son of Adrian Fortescue who was martyred and has been beatified. Sir John was a great-grandson of Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, Lord Mayor of London (1457), and thus a second-cousin of Queen Elizabeth I.

Fortescue also held the position of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from 1601 to his death. Fortescue served under Queen Elizabeth I and was knighted in 1592. He inherited the manor of Great Washbourne from his mother. When King James I came to the throne in 1603, Fortescue advocated restrictions on his power, in part in order to limit the appointment of Scottish people. These reforms were not implemented, and as a result, James dismissed him from his position as Chancellor of the Exchequer. He retained, however, his position in Parliament and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as well as the keeper of the great wardrobe. Death and burial Fortescue was buried in Mursley Church in Buckinghamshire, where a monument was erected in his honour.

History  The party was founded by a group around Jacques de Kadt and Piet J. Schmidt on 28 March 1932. The group had split from the SDAP after a conflict over the internal opposition publication, the De Fakkel. The moderate leadership of the SDAP banned the publication, in reaction to this the leftwing opposition left the party. It entered in the 1933 elections where at won 27,000 votes and nearly one seat. In 1935 the party merged with the Revolutionary Socialist Party, and formed the Revolutionary Socialist Workers Party.  Ideology & Issues  The OSP was an orthodox Marxist, revolutionary socialist party, which opposed both the authoritarian stalinism of the Communist Party of the Netherlands and the moderate reformism of the Social- Democratic Workers' Party. The party's main goal was the proletarian world revolution, which would replace the capitalist system by a system of workers' councils. In the end this would result in a Communist society where inequality, exploitation and class would be eliminated.  Electorate  The RSP was mainly supported by leftwing intellectuals and educated workers, who were highly concentrated in the large cities.  Organization  = Linked organisations = The party had a strong basis of young militants, united in Socialist Youth Union. (Dutch: Socialistische Jeugd Vereniging; SJV). The party magazine was the De Fakkel (The Torch), which had actually ignited the break between OSP and SDAP. The Youth Union was affiliated to the International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations. = Relationships to other parties = The OSP was shunned by other leftwing parties, because of its strong opposition to the social-democratic SDAP and the Communist CPH. Cooperation with the small Left-Communist RSP led to their merger with the RSAP in 1935.  International Comparison  The OSP is very comparable to other parties formed as orthodox Marxist opposition within social-democratic parties, like Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany - see anti- Stalinist left and centrist Marxism.

It is located in southeastern Queens County in the townships of Lot 57 and Lot 58. Situated on the island's south shore along the Northumberland Strait, Belfast is predominantly an agricultural area.  History  Belfast was the landing site of Lord Selkirk's settlers in 1803. These poor displaced Scottish farmers soon established themselves on the best land in the area and it became one of the most productive farming districts in the colony. The Presbyterian Scots were joined in the mid-19th century by displaced Irish Great Famine refugees who were forced to take poorer land in surrounding areas. Political, social and economic tensions between the Roman Catholic Irish and Presbyterian Scots boiled over during a general election in March 1847, resulting in what has become known as the Belfast Riot. = Belfast today = Today, Belfast is known for its golf course Belfast Highland Greens, Mini Woolen Mills, and many art studios and pottery shops. Point Prim Lighthouse at sunset (August 2019)Also of interest is the lighthouse at nearby Point Prim, which was designed by Architect Isaac Smith in 1845 (notable for designing Province House (Prince Edward Island)) and is the oldest lighthouse on the Island. The 18.2 m (60 foot) structure is also the only round brick lighthouse on PEI and one of the last of its kind in Canada. Hannah's Bottle Village (August 2019)On the road to Point Prim Lighthouse is Hannah's Bottle Village, a local tourist attraction made up of several miniature buildings constructed of glass bottles and cement. There is no admission charge, but donations to the IWK Health Centre in Halifax are accepted. Of particular note is the local parish church, St. John's. Built in 1824 in the style of Sir Christopher Wren, Saint John's is today under the pastoral care of Rev. Roger W.MacPhee. In 2005, the church invited Robin Mark, a popular Christian musician from Belfast, Northern Ireland, to lead their \\"Emerging Church Conference.\\" The E.C.C. was such a success that Mr. Mark returned in 2006 for \\"Revival in Belfast II\\" and was scheduled to be back in 2007 along with Pastor Paul Reid. Saint John's has the largest Presbyterian Sunday school east of Montreal. In addition to Saint John's, Belfast is home to two other churches, namely, Saint Michael's Roman Catholic, and Wood Islands Presbyterian. Many residents of the community attend worship services in Charlottetown or Montague.  Amenities  Belfast's major recreational component to their community include, Belfast Rec Center which includes one ice surface, a community room, a canteen & a skate sharpening service; Belfast Highland Greens, a 9-hole golf course Belfast Community Pool which includes two outdoor pools, a kiddy pool and canteen services, as well as a softball field beside the rink. Belfast is also home to a community-operated campground at Lord Selkirk Provincial Park.  Economy  One of the region's major employers is Northumberland Ferries, which operates a terminal in Wood Islands. This ferry service, which connects Prince Edward Island to Caribou, Nova Scotia, was first established in 1941. Two ferryboats, the and , currently service the route.  Education  Students in the area attend Belfast Consolidated School. From grade 10 through grade 12, they attend Montague Regional High School. Both schools are administered by P.E.I.'s English Language School Board.  Politics  Belfast is part of the provincial electoral district of Belfast-Murray River. Currently the Member of the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island is Progressive Conservative Darlene Compton.  Notable people  Notable \\"Belfasters\\" include former P.E.I. premier John Angus MacLean (d. 2000). Dr. Angus MacAulay, b. 10 Dec. 1759, a lay preacher and medical doctor, was instrumental in helping to establish the first church (a log structure) in 1804. Macaulay was thus easily elected to the House of Assembly in 1806 as a representative of Queens County. When Lieutenant Governor Smith called for elections to a new assembly in 1818, Macaulay was returned from Queens County, and was an active speaker of the house government. Elected again in 1820, Macaulay was once more chosen speaker when the house convened in July. Macaulay stood by his people publicly and privately for more than a quarter of a century. He gave a plot of his own land in Point Prim for a cemetery (where he buried his own daughter). The Polly Cemetery is still used by locals today in the community of Belfast. d. 6 Dec. 1827. Dougald MacKinnon (December 15, 1886 ‚Äì August 21, 1970) was a farmer, fisherman and political figure on Prince Edward Island.

It is located north-west of the central core, in the former suburb of North York. Many of the neighbourhoods in this quadrant of the city can aptly be described as family neighbourhoods with access to parks, green space and a slower pace than found closer to downtown. As its name implies, it is composed of two geographic areas, the first being the Pelmo Park area which is bordered by the 401 to the north, Woodward Avenue to the south, Jane Street to the east and the CNR rail tracks to the west. The second area, Humberlea, is centred on Weston Road and bordered by Sheppard Avenue west to the north, Oak Street to the south, the CNR rail tracks to the east and the Humber River to the west. Education Two public school boards operate schools in Pelmo Park ‚Äì Humberlea, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB). Both TCDSB, and TDSB operate public elementary schools in the neighbourhood. TCDSB operates St. Simon Catholic School , whereas TDSB operate Pelmo Park Public School. TCDSB is the only public school board to operate a secondary school in Pelmo Park ‚Äì Humberlea, St. Basil-the-Great College School. TDSB does not operate a secondary school in the neighbourhood, with TDSB secondary school students residing in Pelmo Park ‚Äì Humberleaattending institutions in adjacent neighbourhoods. The French first language public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir also offer schooling to applicable residents of Pelmo Park ‚Äì Humberlea, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood. CSCM and CSV students attend schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto.

Several municipal parks are located in Pelmo Park ‚Äì Humberlea including Crawford-Jones Memorial Park, Pelmo Park, Pine Point Park, Strathburn Park, and Wallace C. Swanek Park. A number of these parks are situated next to the Humber Valley, which forms a part of the larger Toronto ravine system. Municipal parks are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. In addition to municipal parks, the division also manages a community centre in the neighbourhood, Pelmo Park Community Centre. Transportation Several major roadways bound Pelmo Park ‚Äì Humberlea. Sheppard Avenue bounds the neighbourhood to the north, whereas portions of Albion Road, and Weston Road bound the neighbourhood to the west. Highway 400 is a controlled access highway that bounds the neighbourhood to the east. Highway 401 is another east-west highway that bisects the neighbourhood, serving as a dividing line between Humberlea and Pelmo Park.

It gives its name to the Shotley peninsula. Shotley parish comprises the village of Shotley and the larger adjacent settlement of Shotley Gate and the small settlement of Church End. In 2001 the civil parish had a population of 2,373.  Shotley  The village of Shotley is about a mile northwest from the tip of the peninsula, and lies either side of the B1456 road (the Street). In 2018 it had an estimated population of 854. There are two entries for Shotley (Scoteleia) and an adjacent settlement of Kirkton (Cherchetuna) listed in the Domesday Book of 1086. A school is located outside the village (half of 1 km east) opposite the turning into Oldhall Road. Oldhall Road is located east of the village leading north to St Mary's Church. The church is adjacent to a large naval cemetery cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. It has graves from both world wars, not only those of HMS Ganges trainees, but also of Harwich-based warships killed in action with the Germans. There is a memorial to the dead from the 14-18 Harwich submarines. Shotley Hall is located near to the church. Rose Farm lies to the south of the village. Shotley Parish Council holds its main meeting at the village hall at 19.00 hours every third Thursday of every month, while the Open Spaces and Amenities Committee meets most months on the second Thursday. Both are open to the public.  Shotley Gate  Martello Tower, Shotley ‚Äì geograph.org.uk ‚Äì 1359405 Shotley Gate is a settlement to the south of the village of Shotley at the tip of the peninsula. In 2018 it had an estimated population of 1473. By about 800 AD, the Vikings or Danes started to make an appearance in this area. Under the Peace of Wedmore in 878, all land north of the old Roman Watling Street, which ran from London to Chester, was given to the Viking leader, Guthrum. Shotley therefore became part of Danelaw. The peace was short-lived however, and following an unsuccessful Viking attack on Kent, Alfred King of Wessex attacked the enemy in East Anglia. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the year 885 reads as follows: 'The same year sent King Alfred a fleet from Kent into East Anglia. As soon as they came to Stourmouth, there met them sixteen ships of the pirates, and they fought with them, took all the ships and slew the men. As they returned homeward with their booty, they met a large fleet of pirates and fought with them the same day, but the Danes had the victory'. It is possible that Bloody Point at Shotley took its name from this incident, however at that time the river entered the sea north of Felixstowe and so the area would not have been seen as the mouth of the Stour. It could also have derived this name late in the next century when the Vikings returned to the estuary in force, twice plundering Ipswich. Shotley Gate and the parish have a strategic position for protecting the ports of Felixstowe, Harwich and Ipswich and in 1865 the Shotley Battery fortifications were established. King Edward III camped here early in the Hundred Years War, before the great sea Battle of Sluys. Documents signed by him and kept in the National Archive end with the words \\"at Shotley\\". Shotley Gate also harbours HMS Ganges, a former Royal Navy training establishment (RNTE Shotley) for boys. The teak ship was constructed in 1821 and taken out of service in 1861. It was moved to Shotley in 1899, and by 1905 was moved ashore. A large proportion of the naval ratings of the 20th century, boy entrants in peacetime and men during both world wars, trained there. The training establishment closed in 1976 and the site was subsequently sold for redevelopment. In June 2011 Babergh District Council declared the site a Conservation Area. The HMS Ganges Museum (open Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays between Easter and the end of October 1100 to 1700hrs) houses artefacts and memorabilia from the old shore establishment including a large collection of photographs and original documents.  Amenities and places of interest  The Rose public house is situated in the village of Shotley. The Bristol Arms public house lies in Shotley Gate near the piers and Martello towers. The Shipwreck public house is located at Shotley Marina, also in Shotley Gate at the end of King Edward VII Drive ‚Äì a popular tourist destination. In the summer months a foot and cycle ferry service licensed to carry up to 12 passengers operates between Shotley Marina, Harwich and Felixstowe. There are a number of listed buildings located in Shotley, including Martello towers and the ceremonial mast from the former HMS Ganges. Shotley Cottage (half of 1 km southeast of the village of Shotley) was a World War I radio telegraphy station. The Suffolk Historic Environment Record lists more than 200 sites and monuments in Shotley. St Mary's Church Walking Club, Shotley, meets on the second Sunday of every month. Current issues Sea defences erected at Shotley Cliff = Coastal footpath erosion = In 2008 the collapse of a section of the footpath which runs along the base of Shotley Cliff (which was subsequently reinstated by Shotley Parish Council) drew attention to a coastal erosion issue affecting a lengthy exposed section of the cliff further along, where the path had already crumbled away. It became apparent that the cliff was eroding at a rate not previously recognised, which was likely to endanger several properties above it. A group of local residents in Shotley Gate, informally known as the Shotley Stour Footpath Renovation Group, began a long term project to deal with the issue, which eventually led to the Group (with assistance from the Parish Council) obtaining funding for sea defences to protect the first of the exposed area from a number of sources including Suffolk County Council, the Environment Agency, the Haven Gateway Partnership, Hutchison Ports, Suffolk Coasts & Heaths and Shotley Parish Council, as well as local fundraising; in total, these defences (which were installed by Welham Plant Ltd under the project management of the Stour Footpath Group and Hawes Associates) cost just under ¬£40,000 to install, with a further ¬£60,000 subsequently raised for defences along the remaining of exposed cliff and for the renovation of a derelict picnic area at the other end of the footpath, both hopefully to be completed in 2011 (¬£18,000 of this funding came as a result of the Shotley project winning the Haven Gateway Authority's 'I Love Landscapes' competition in May 2011, the project receiving 1413 votes from the public). Phase two of the sea defence work began on 11 July 2011, extending the defences to the far end of Shotley Cliff and creating a maintenance path to the rear of them which effectively links the remains of two public footpaths to create a continuous coastal path (albeit one which in theory is not a 'public footpath' for the entirety of its length). The sea defences, as well as the newly renovated Shotley Gate Picnic Area at the other end of the footpath, were formally opened by Tim Yeo MP on the morning of 19 September 2011, an event which was also broadcast on BBC Radio Suffolk. The project has been written up by the Estuaries Officer and Suffolk County Council as a case study in inter-agency co-operation with the public. Most of Shotley Cliff and fifty acres of foreshore, including the land on which the sea defences sit, was purchased by Shotley Parish Council late in 2012, and the Council now has responsibility for ongoing maintenance and management of the area. The public footpath (The Stour and Orwell Walk) between Shotley Gate and Pin Mill is currently closed off by Suffolk County Council from about 2 km north of Shotley Gate marina (where it branches to Church End) as far as the Orwell Cottages near Colton Creek until mid August 2014 as a result of recent tidal surge which caused significant erosion. No alternative route is available. = HMS Ganges site redevelopment = Training mast at H.M.S. Ganges ‚Äì geograph.org.uk ‚Äì 1247847 The attempted development of the former HMS Ganges site has caused considerable controversy in the area over several years. The scale of the proposed development was felt by residents in both Shotley and other villages along the B1456 to be in excess of what the local infrastructure could cope with. In November 2010 planning permissions on the site lapsed following an unsuccessful appeal by the developer. The mast which stands in what was formerly the parade ground is currently due for repair. The HMS Ganges site remains undeveloped and its future is uncertain. In April 2012 the developers submitted a revised proposal for 285 homes, a 60-bed nursing home, a hotel, offices, shops and community facilities. The site has had planning permission granted in principle and the land will take two years to clear before building works begin.

During the 1950s, the Provost was developed for the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a replacement for the Percival Prentice. Designed by Henry Millicer, it was a single-engined low- wing monoplane, furnished with a fixed, tailwheel undercarriage and, like the preceding Prentice, had a side-by-side seating arrangement. First flying on 24 February 1950, the prototypes participated in an official evaluation, after which the type was selected to meet Air Ministry specification T.16/48. The Provost entered service with the RAF during 1953 and quickly proved to be more capable than the preceding Prentice. It was a relatively successful aircraft, being exported for multiple overseas operators. Various models were developed, both armed and unarmed, to meet with customer demands. The Provost later adapted to make use of a turbojet engine, producing the BAC Jet Provost. During the 1960s, the type was withdrawn from RAF service in favour of its jet-powered successor. It continued to be used for decades after with various export customers. Development The origins of the Provost can be found in the issuing of Air Ministry specification T.16/48, which called for a single- engined basic trainer aircraft to meet Operational Requirement 257, seeking a replacement for the Royal Air Force's (RAF) existing fleet of Percival Prentice trainers.Meekcoms and Morgan 1994, p. 380. A major priority of the specification was to introduce more direct supervision and observation of student pilots by instructors in order to reduce the rate of late-stage dropouts.Cross, Roy. \\"New RAF Trainer.\\" Flying Magazine, September 1952. Vol. 51, No. 3. pp. 34-35. ISSN 0015-4806. On 11 September 1948, this specification was issued, attracting the attention of various aviation companies; the Air Ministry ultimately received in excess of 30 proposals. Percival was amongst those companies that decided to produce a response, their design has been attributed to the Polish-born aeronautical engineer, Henry Millicer (Millicer later moved to Australia, where he designed the award-winning Victa Airtourer light aircraft). After reviewing the numerous submissions, the Air Ministry selected a pair of designs, the Percival P.56 and the Handley Page H.P.R. 2, and issued contracts for the construction of prototypes to both companies. On 13 January 1950, Percival was received its contract for a pair of prototypes, both of which being powered by the Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah engine. Additionally, the company decided to construct a third prototype, powered by the more powerful Alvis Leonides Mk 25 radial engine. On 24 February 1950, the Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah-powered prototype serial number WE522 performed its maiden flight.Thetford 1957, . Months later, an extensive evaluation was performed of the Provost prototypes, which was flown head-to-head with the rival H.P.R. 2 at RAF Boscombe Down; it also underwent tropical trials overseas. Reportedly, feedback from trials was largely favourable, especially of its handling characteristics, with only minor refinements being recommended.\\"Schooling the Provost.\\" Flight International, 31 August 1951. p. 251. Ultimately, the Leonides-powered P.56 was selected for production as the Provost T.1; on 29 May 1951, an initial order for 200 aircraft was placed. During 1961, production of the type was terminated, by which point a total of 461 aircraft had reportedly been completed. The Percival Provost eventually formed the basis for a jet-powered derivative, the Jet Provost, which ultimately succeeded the piston-engined Provost as the principle training platform of the RAF. Design The Provost was an all-metal, single-engined, two-seat monoplane, featuring fixed conventional landing gear with a fully- castering tailwheel. It was developed to provide training that was better- suited to the increasingly-complicated operational aircraft that were then being brought into service. The main two seats in the cockpit were positioned in a side-by-side configuration, enabling the instructor to sit directly alongside the student, easing training by allowing for mutual close observation and for flight procedures to be more readily demonstrated; a third seat had been originally specified for use by an observer, but this position was later omitted following little use.Cross 1952, pp. 34‚Äì35, 59. The cockpit was considered to be relatively bulky amongst its contemporary rivals, a feature that did not heavily impinge upon the aircraft's overall performance. The type was designed to be easy to maintain; various components were intentionally interchangeable where possible and there was a generous provision of access hatches in the fuselage. Production aircraft were powered by a single Alvis Leonides 25 engine, capable of providing up to ; the performance of this engine meant that Provost was roughly twice as powerful as the preceding Percival Prentice.Cross 1952, pp. 35‚Äì58. The engine operated smoothly across various speeds and produced relatively low noise levels from within the cockpit. The Provost had a roll rate and handling similar to the best fighters upon entering service, it was also known for its rapid rate of climb and generous power provision from its engine.Cross 1952, p. 58. Its performance level has been contrasted to that of aerobatic aircraft, which strongly appealed to some instructor-pilots, although it was deemed to be somewhat excessive for general flying purposes.Flight International 1951, p. 353. According to aviation periodical Flight International, the stall characteristics of the Provost were relatively gentle, it was also quite easy to recover from a spin.Flight International 1951, p. 354. The self-centering stick is relatively sensitive during flight, flying pilots had to be aware of this during landing to ensure that the tail is not raised too high for the propeller arc; however, it could be readily trimmed for hands-off flight. Recovery from a spin was achieved by a combination of pushing forwards on the stick and applying full rudder, while a spin could be deliberately induced by pulling hard back on the stick and applying opposite force using the rudders. The ailerons are used to perform various manoeuvres; a full roll can be performed in four seconds via full aileron deflection.Flight International 1951, pp. 354-355. Both the ailerons and elevators are relatively light compared with contemporary peers; the controls are reportedly well-harmonised in general. Landing the Provost is also relatively easy, being aided by a high level of external visibility for the pilot, a low tendency to float prior to round-out, and fairly low viable approach speeds; it also possesses good side- slip capabilities.Flight International 1951, p. 355. The three-piece canopy was designed for good crashworthiness and to facilitate instrument flying training in daylight, via extendible amber screens and blue-tinted goggles to prevent the pupil seeing outside the cockpit, while the instructor (wearing no goggles) could see through the amber panels. The Provost was also equipped with then-modern very high frequency (VHF) radio aids, which enabled pilots to conduct landings through cloud cover using a Ground Controlled Approach; this better enabled the training of pilots to fly in cloudy conditions and to navigate at night.Cross 1952, p. 59. The majority of controls are logically grouped together, the majority of which being set on the central console positioned between the two seats.Flight International 1951, pp. 353-354. According to author David Ogilvy, the complexity of the cockpit was a deliberate design choice; contrary to earlier trainer aircraft, which were typically simplified so students would find them easy to fly, the Provost intentionally exposed beginners to an advanced environment more representative of the varied tasks of aircraft operations.Ogilvy 2007, pp. 38, 41. Operational history =Royal Air Force= Operational Provost T.1 of the RAF Central Air Traffic Control School in 1967 During 1953, the Provost entered service with the RAF, the first batch of aircraft were delivered to the Central Flying School (CFS) at RAF South Cerney. The CFS carried out intensive flight trials in May and June 1953 prior to instructor training commencing. The Provost was more capable than the Prentice it replaced, which allowed students to move straight on to the De Havilland Vampire after completing training on the Provost. On 1 July 1953, 6 Flying Training School at RAF Ternhill started to re-equip with the Provost. The first pupil training course to use the Provost started in October 1953. No. 22 Flying Training School at RAF Syerston was the next to convert and it was followed by 2 FTS at RAF Cluntoe, Northern Ireland, 3 FTS at RAF Feltwell and then the Royal Air Force College at RAF Cranwell.Ogilvy 2007, p. 38. By September 1954, the Provost had replaced the older Prentice in RAF service entirely.\\"Hunting Percival Provost 53 and Mk 1.\\" Flight International, 10 September 1954. p. 406. Starting during 1956, the type began to be issued to several University Air Squadrons, the first of these being the Queen's University Air Squadron, Belfast in January 1956. The last RAF production aircraft was delivered in April 1956. The aircraft served with the RAF until the early 1960s, when it was replaced by the newer Jet Provost. A few Provosts continued in service throughout the 1960s with the Central Navigation & Control School (later Central Air Traffic Control School) at RAF Shawbury, the last example being retired during 1969. Several retired airframes were renumbered with maintenance serials and used for training of airframe and engine tradesmen. At least five Percival Provost have survived as civilian aircraft. =Export customers= Provost T.53 of the Irish Air Corps at Baldonnel airfield Ireland in 1967 The first export order was placed in May 1953 by Southern Rhodesia, for four T.1 aircraft which were designated the T.51. Later, the Royal Rhodesian Air Force followed with an order for twelve armed trainers, designated the T.52, which were delivered in 1955. In January 1954, the Irish Air Corps ordered four T.51 aircraft and in 1960, a further order for six armed T.53 variants. In 1954, the Burmese Air Force also ordered 12 armed T.53 variants and eventually operated a total of 40 aircraft. In May 1957, the newly formed Sudan Air Force ordered four T.53 armed variant; two were lost in accidents shortly after delivery, a further three were bought in 1959, followed by five former RAF aircraft. Former RAF aircraft were delivered to Royal Air Force of Oman as armed T.52 variants. In 1955, the Royal Iraqi Air Force ordered 15 armed Provost T.53s, with the first delivered in May 1955. The final export customer was the Royal Malaysian Air Force, who obtained 24 T.51 trainers between 1961 and 1968. In 1968, Rhodesia obtained further aircraft using a convoluted route to circumvent an arms embargo.

Multimedia search can be implemented through multimodal search interfaces, i.e., interfaces that allow to submit search queries not only as textual requests, but also through other media. We can distinguish two methodologies in multimedia search: *Metadata search: the search is made on the layers of metadata. * Query by example: The interaction consists in submitting a piece of information (e.g., a video, an image, or a piece of audio) at the purpose of finding similar multimedia items. Metadata search Search is made using the layers in metadata which contain information of the content of a multimedia file. Metadata search is easier, faster and effective because instead of working with complex material, such as an audio, a video or an image, it searches using text. There are three processes which should be done in this method: *Summarization of media content (feature extraction). The result of feature extraction is a description. *Filtering of media descriptions (for example, elimination of Redundancy) *Categorization of media descriptions into classes. Query by example In query by example, the element used to search is a multimedia content (image, audio, video). In other words, the query is a media. Often, it's used audiovisual indexing. It will be necessary to choose the criteria we are going to use for creating metadata. The process of search can be divided in three parts: *Generate descriptors for the media which we are going to use as query and the descriptors for the media in our database. *Compare descriptors of the query and our database‚Äôs media. *List the media sorted by maximum coincidence.

The novel narrates a story of a boy who creates an imaginary world called Fayre Farre to escape his abusive father.  Plot  Kevin Malone has a troubled childhood with history of abuses by his father. To escape the miseries of his real life, he creates a fantasy world called \\"Fayre Farre\\" in which he is \\"The Promised Champion\\", the hero of the world. Amy, a fourteen- year-old girl, enters this fantasy world one day while she is roller-skating at New York's Central Park. Amy has been running away from her own real-life problems. She has lost her cousin Shelly, and Amy's father wants the family to relocate to Los Angeles as he wants to pursue a career in Hollywood. The anticipation of losing her best friends by moving away depresses Amy. She accidentally enters the make-believe world of Kevin, her neighbor who used to bully her in the past. In Fayre Farre, The Promised Champion is losing his supremacy, as the evil \\"White Warrior Anglower\\" expands his armies to gain control over the kingdom. Through a series of adventures, Kevin wins over the White Warrior Anglower, taking help from Amy and her friends. At the end, Anglower is shown as the reincarnation of Kevin's father and Amy accepts the death of her cousin.  Development  Author Suzy McKee Charnas in 2006 The book is set in New York, where Charnas was born. She later moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, but decided to plot the book in New York in response to people who would express their sympathy about her growing up in Manhattan and \\"to write about the reality of growing up in a place of physical freedom, thrilling unpredictability, and a enormous, nourishing energy\\". The book is based on Charnas' experience of being bullied as a child.  Publishing history  The original hardcover edition was published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and illustrated by artist Michael Hussar. An electronic version was released in June 2001 by ElectricStory.com.  Reception  Hazel Davis for The Assembly on Literature for Adolescents appreciated the work of Charnas to combine the real-life problem of child abuse, losing friends, and grieving death with the fantasy elements of monsters, prophesies, magic, and violence. Kirkus Reviews called it an \\"engrossing story\\" for the proper mix of real and unreal worlds. In 1994 the novel won the Mythopoeic Society Award in the Children's Literature category. The award \\"honors books for beginning readers to age thirteen, in the tradition of The Hobbit or The Chronicles of Narnia\\".

Johnson Continuation School, and Hanford Adult School. A arts high school, Sierra Pacific High School, opened on August 13, 2009 with 217 freshman. HJUHSD serves the northwestern portion of Kings County, California. The schools are located in Hanford, the county seat. Hanford High School and Hanford West High School each serve approximately 1,700 students. Earl F. Johnson High School serves about 250 students. Hanford Adult School serves a wide variety of students through its many and varied programs. HJUHSD students attend Hanford High School, Hanford West High School or Sierra Pacific High School based on their home address. These attendance areas were created with input from parents and other community members to create neighborhood schools and to balance student population between the schools. History Hanford High School held its first classes in 1892 with one teacher, W. S. Cranmer, and an average enrollment of fourteen.Gibson, Harold, History of Kings County Public Schools, Hanford, CA, 2004 In May, 1895, Hanford High School celebrated its first graduation. Originally, the high school was located in the back of a local bank in Downtown Hanford. When more room was needed, classes were moved to a house on Elm Street before the school found its final home on Grangeville and Douty streets. Funded by a 1919 bond measure for $350,000 and a $30,000 sale of school property, Hanford High's ‚ÄúMain Building‚Äù on Grangeville Boulevard was opened in 1921 and would be the school's home for more than 50 years. In 1952, a new cafeteria, auto shop and metal shop were added to the school, followed by new classrooms and other facilities in 1959. Around 1940, the student body broke the 1,000 mark. Just over 20 years later, the school population had grown to the point that a separate facility was needed. In November 1962, voters approved a $2.5 million bond issue to build a second campus. Land was purchased on West Lacey Boulevard and construction of ‚ÄúWest Campus‚Äù began in 1963. It opened in 1964 to freshmen, and by 1968, 1,250 9th and 10th graders were enrolled. By 1994, both campuses were serving all four grades. In 1970, Earl F. Johnson Continuation High School - named for a long- time educator who died in 1967 - was built at the north end of the Hanford High School East Campus. In 1975, the community bid a sad farewell to historic Main Hall at the East Campus when it was demolished because it did not meet earthquake and education codes. In 1978, the district celebrated the opening of the replacement administration and library building. It was joined by a new auditorium in 1981 (later named the Stratton L. Tarvin Presentation Center for the Performing Arts in honor of a long-time administrator). In 1980, Hanford Adult School was built on Campus Drive. In 1994, Earl F. Johnson High School was moved a few blocks south on Douty Street to a former elementary school. A $1 million modernization in 2002 expanded classroom space there. In 1997, the district began its biggest construction project in many years: A $18 million local bond and matching state grants funded the construction of classrooms, labs, a library, a performing arts building, an event center and more to transform West Campus into Hanford West High, an independent school. The 2001-2002 school year marked an important milestone for the 100+ year old district: Four independent high school graduations. Hanford West High's first graduating class numbered 291. Hanford High graduated 342; Earl F. Johnson had 21 graduates and Hanford Adult school gave out 41 high school diplomas. On August 13, 2009, a third comprehensive, state-of-the-art high school called Sierra Pacific High School opened with 217 freshmen. Phase two of Sierra Pacific High will include additional buildings, including an administration building, a second academic building, a wrestling room, a pool and aquatics center, maintenance facilities, and a library and media center according to student growth and the need. Sierra Pacific High School was built because the two existing comprehensive high schools were over their enrollment capacities. Hanford High School and Hanford West High School are each built to hold about 1,700 students, but the student population at each was approaching 2,000 students. The Board of the Hanford Joint Union High School believes it is in the best interest of all students to keep high school enrollment at or below 1,700 students each. Studies have shown that this is a size that is big enough to allow for a variety of quality academic and extra-curricular activities, but small enough to allow for the personal interactions that help drive student success. No plans have been made to build any more high schools in the near future in Hanford, but as the city continues to grow to an estimated 70,177 residents by 2020, Hanford Joint Union High School District will continue to plan ahead to best serve all students. Academics Hanford High School, Hanford West High School, and Sierra Pacific High School are comprehensive high schools offering college preparatory academics and extra- curricular activities. Earl F. Johnson Continuation High School is a smaller school designed to serve students who are at risk of not succeeding in the comprehensive setting. Hanford Adult School provides a variety of adult education opportunities for the community, including vocational training, a nursing education program and English-as-a-second-language courses.

Starting out as an all-female organization, Angel Flight was more of a national idea with various names. While these organizations across the country had different names, they were all focused on helping their local AFROTC unit. In April 1957, representatives from 16 different groups came together at the 8th National Conclave of Arnold Air Society to join their purposes under a National Coordination Headquarters. In the 1980s, local Angel Flight chapters were allowed to use the name \\"Silver Wings\\" as recognition for their growing diversity in membership. In 1995, the General Assembly of the yearly national conclave (NATCON) changed the organization's name to \\"Angel Flight-Silver Wings.\\" Local chapters were allowed to use the name \\"Angel Flight,\\" \\"Silver Wings,\\" or \\"Angel Flight-Silver Wings.\\" Hoping to increase recruitment, Angel Flight-Silver Wings restructured the organization in 1996, changing their mission and goals away from being a military-support oriented organization to further diversify their organization. In 1998 the National Conclave changed the organization's name to \\"Silver Wings,\\" functioning as a civilian organization focused on community service, leadership, and professional development. Membership Silver Wings members must be an undergraduate or graduate student within the local chapter, and complete various workshops and projects. Honorary membership can be bestowed.  Organization  The National Headquarters provides direction and focus for the entire organization. The nation is broken up into 11 regions. Region Presidents serve the chapters that lie within their region and communicate from chapters to national officers. The National Headquarters is chosen each year by the General Assembly at NATCON, which takes place annually in spring, typically on Easter weekend. Silver Wings (SW) and Arnold Air Society (AAS) also jointly hold the National Conclave (NATCON) where all members of SW and AAS are invited to discuss matters within the organizations. During this event, business meetings are conducted and local chapters and regions vote on various resolutions and amendments to their manuals.

Whitchurch is Laverstoke's main destination for shopping due to local fast bus routes to the town centre of Whitchurch. In the early 18th century, Laverstoke Mill was purchased by the Portals, a family of Huguenot immigrants from Languedoc who were establishing a successful paper making business. Henry de Portal was naturalised in 1711 and had the mill rebuilt in 1719. In 1724 he won the contract to make Bank of England notes and pioneered the use of the watermark in paper currency. Henry Portal's son Joseph went on to become High Sheriff of Hampshire and purchased the Laverstoke estate adjoining the mill. Following generations prospered further, becoming major land owners. By the 1790s they also owned the Manor at Freefolk Priors and Ashe Park House. Jane Austen and her family were acquainted with the Portals and two of her brother Edward's sons went on to marry members of the Portal family. In 1796 the Portals had the old Laverstoke House demolished and a new house erected in neo-classical style by John Bonomi. It is this house that still stands today (although no longer owned by the Portals and not open to the public).

He batted and threw right-handed. Pitching career Fisher led Pacific Coast League pitchers with 239 innings while playing for the Tacoma Giants in 1960. His minor league record from 1958 to 1961 was 47-28 (.627) with a 3.23 ERA in 93 games (632 innings pitched). Fisher's best pitch was the knuckleball, and in 1963-1966 he worked out the White Sox bullpen with fellow flutterball specialist Hoyt Wilhelm. Fisher started just 63 out of the 690 games he appeared in, and completed 7 of those, two for shutouts. He is better-known, however, for his effective relief work. In Fisher's 15-year career, 1965 stands out as his best season. He was named to the American League All-Star team and finished 4th in the MVP voting. He pitched the final two innings of the 1965 All-Star Game for the AL, holding the National League scoreless on one hit. He retired Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente and Ron Santo in order in the top of the ninth. Fisher led the league that season in WHIP (0.974), games pitched (82), and games finished (60), and was second in earned run average (2.40) and saves (24). His 15-7 record gave him a winning percentage of .682, which ranked fourth. The White Sox finished in second place that year with a record of 95-67. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on June 13, 1966 and helped them win the American League pennant. In 44 appearances for the O's he was 5-3 with 13 saves and a 2.64 ERA in 71.2 innings. Baltimore won the 1966 World Series, but Fisher did not appear in any of the four games against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Jim Palmer, Wally Bunker, and Dave McNally all pitched complete games, and the team needed only one relief appearance, provided by Moe Drabowsky. Fisher spent the 1968 season with the Alvin Dark-managed Cleveland Indians after being acquired along with minor leaguers Johnny Scruggs and Bob Scott from the Orioles for John O'Donoghue and Gordon Lund on November 28, 1967.Joyce, Dick. \\"L.A.

Open University offers undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs.  History  The reorganization at the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM) in 1997 paved the way for the establishment of the Division of Community Health Services (DCHS), which now serves as a component of the Open University. With the Integrated Midwifery Association of the Philippines (IMAP), it pioneered a program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Community Health Service (BSCHS),Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila 39th Anniversary.

Accessed February 16, 2009. Working with the Quality University Education for Social Transformation (QUEST), a non-government educational foundation, PLM and the Trinity University of Asia in Quezon City have already graduated more than 6,000 midwives nationwide. Originally offering only the BCHS Program, the DCHS expanded its offerings to include the Master of Community Health Service (MCHS) in 2001. A year later, PLM by virtue of its charter, installed its General Education Curriculum (GEC) for the first two years of college education at the Second Philippine International School (SPIS), an all- Filipino educational institution for Overseas Filipino Workers in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Nu√±ez, Dr. Domingo B. \\"PLM connects to Riyadh.\\" Pamantasan StarPost, vol.

Visiting assignments of PLM professors are part of the agreement between the partner schools. In 2004, off-campus connections were established with Asia Pacific College of Advanced Studies, Southville International School and Colleges, and World CITI Colleges. In that same year, Mayor Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. of Quezon City signed a memorandum of agreement with the Open University that allows undergraduate city and barangay employees to get a college degree. To qualify, City Hall applicants should have served the local government for at least two years. Barangay employees, whether elected or appointed, must be at least high school graduates. Apart from city employees and officials, Quezon City residents are eligible to apply. Open to them are courses in business management and entrepreneurship. At present, the distance learning programs and the off-campus program that offer a bachelor's degrees in public administration remains a continuing program. It is designed to help qualified government employees get their degrees and improve their competencies as a public servant.Youth & Campus: Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. Manila Bulletin. September 09, 2008.  Admissions  Admission to the Open University is the responsibility of the partner school or agency. Students undergo either the screening procedure set by the partner agency or institution, or take the usual Graduate Record Examination (GRE) for on-campus admission at the PLM main campus. Classes in the off-campus at the master's level programs are held on weekends in the host or partner institution. Provision for modular instructions are provided in various programs should the student decide to complete his tertiary education. Part of the quality control that PLM imposes is the administration of a validation test in all subjects at the end of each semester. The results of this validation test shall form part of the grade a student receives in each subject.  Degree programs  The Open University offers degree programs in a variety of areas.

In 1979, with the passing of the Country Fires Act in the South Australian Parliament, the EFS was renamed the SA Country Fire Service. History The EFS (or now CFS) springs from a long and complex partnership between volunteers, local government and the South Australian government to meet community safety needs. The partnership began as an attempt to deal with fires in rural areas.\\"Basic Firefighting 1 Learner Guide\\", \\"Unit 1: CFS agency awareness and Teamwork\\" Also, in colonial times, government only attempted to control the outbreak of wildfire by legislating against the careless use of fire, beginning with the 1847 ordinance against reckless burn-offs or stubble and grass. Fire suppression was left to local residents who would band together to fight fires as they arose without any formal organisation or authority to set backburns. In 1913, Councils were given the right to appoint Fire Control Officers, with powers to do anything 'necessary or expedient and practicable' to prevent fires, or to protect life and property in the case of fire, or to control or extinguish a fire including backburning. Technological expansion after the Second World War revolutionised rural firefighting with the development of radios, telephones, motor transport and the knapsack spray. Rural residents also began to form into local or district firefighting associations. Later as part of the Second World War-effort, government-equipped volunteer Emergency Fire Service (EFS) brigades were established, at first in Adelaide, and later in some country areas. After the war, equipment from these groups was lent to District Councils for rural firefighting work. To supervise the program, an Emergency Fire Services operation was formed within the Police Department. Gradually the many local council brigades began to feel part of a statewide service. From the mid-1950s, the EFS organisation grew stronger, and volunteers began to campaign for the EFS to be established as a statutory authority. This was achieved in 1976, with the passing of the Country Fires Act, which set up the SA Country Fire Service (CFS).

It was built by the Great Eastern Railway between Wisbech, Cambridgeshire and Upwell, Norfolk to carry agricultural produce. Although called a tram, in many ways it more closely resembled a conventional railway line, and paved the way for the passing of the Light Railways Act 1896. History The Great Eastern Railway (GER) promoted the idea of a tramway between Wisbech and Upwell, and permission to construct the line was obtained by W L Ollard in 1873, but he failed to raise the finance to build it. The GER were still in favour of the line, and authorisation to construct it was enshrined in the Great Eastern Railway Act 1881. As well as carrying passengers, it was always intended as a freight line as well, and to this end it was built to standard gauge, with bull-head rails, rather than the tramway rails favoured by many British tramways. This allowed standard goods wagons to run along it, without the need to tranship goods into wagons suitable for operating on tramway rails. In order to reduce the costs of construction, it was built under the provisions of the Tramway Act, with the support of the Board of Trade, to demonstrate that such construction could bring railways to rural areas which could not otherwise benefit from the new mode of transport. The process of buying land began in February 1882, and building the tramway across the flat terrain proceeded rapidly. The section from Wisbech to Outwell Basin was opened on 20 August 1883, with the extension onwards from Outwell to Upwell Depot opening on 8 September 1884. The initial success of the line was one of the factors that resulted in the passing of the Light Railways Act 1896, under which many more rural lines were built. Rolling stock consisted initially of four coaches originally built for the Millwall Extension Railway, two dating from 1871 and two from 1872. These were supplemented by four more coaches built by the Great Eastern Railway in 1884. They had lower floors, and were of two types; coaches 5 and 6 had four wheels, while coaches 7 and 8 were bogie vehicles, and were considerably longer. All four vehicles had ornate end balconies. The company also built a new baggage van at the same time, and allocated a brake van built in 1875 to the tramway. Motive power was provided by GER Class G15 0-4-0T tram engines, three of which were built in 1883 for the opening of the line; a further seven were built between 1885 and 1897, some for the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway and others for the Yarmouth Union tramway and freight-only lines at Colchester and Ipswich. Those used on the tramway were stabled at March Depot. The first four coaches were scrapped in 1890, when they were replaced by four new four-wheeled vehicles, which were again numbered 1 to 4. Between 1903 and 1921, the Great Eastern Railway built a fleet of twelve GER Class C53 0-6-0T tram engines, up to five of which were based at Wisbech ‚Äì the others worked at Yarmouth, Colchester and Ipswich. In accordance with Board of Trade regulations, the tram engines were fitted with sideplates and cowcatchers. When the line opened, passenger services were provided by six trams a day in each direction, with the journey taking one hour in either direction. By October 1884 the tramway was carrying 3,000 passengers per week, while for fetes and other special events as many as 2,000 passengers a day were carried. The tram competed with the Wisbech Canal that also ran between Wisbech and Upwell. The canal was struggling financially when the tramway opened, and although there was some transfer of coal between the railway and canal at Outwell, the tramway gradually took its trade, and it closed in 1922.Evelyn Simak: Wisbech & Upwell tramway - Outwell Village depot. The Geograph (TF5103). Trains on the tramway were limited to , and passengers could be picked up of dropped off at any point on the line. Most trains were mixed, with the passengers often having to wait while goods wagons were shunted. From 1904, the speed limit was increased to , and the trains only stopped at designated places, although this included a number of request stops, as well as the formal stations. Under the terms of the Railways Act 1921, the Great Eastern Railway amalgamated with other railways to create the London and North Eastern Railway at the start of 1923. By that time the tramway was facing increased competition from motorised buses, and the passenger service ended in 1927. Carriages 2 to 4 and 6 to 8 were transferred to the Kelvedon and Tollesbury Light Railway in Essex. Coach 8 appeared in the 1953 film The Titfield Thunderbolt after passenger services were withdrawn on the Kelvedon line in 1951, and was scheduled for preservation, but was subsequently scrapped. Coach 7 spent many years in a field, being used as an onion store, but was rescued and restored. It now resides on the North Norfolk Railway. Freight traffic continued on the tramway until 1966. For a brief period in 1930-1931 the steam tram engines were supplemented by two LNER Class Y10 Sentinel geared steam locomotives, prior to them moving to the Yarmouth Quay line. From 1952, the line was worked by modified Drewry 0-6-0DM (Class 04) diesel shunters, again fitted with sideplates. It thus became the first line in Britain to be wholly worked by diesel locomotives. The line did not survive the Beeching cuts of the 1960s, and was officially closed on 23 May 1966, although the last train, consisting of Drewry Shunter D2201, three wagons and a brake van ran on 20 May. Route Street name The Tramway The former office of the Outwell Village depot Opened in 1883, the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway ran from the Cambridgeshire town of Wisbech to the Norfolk village of Upwell. Its route carried it close to farms and villages, allowing goods to be shipped into Wisbech where they could be transferred onto the main line and carried to destinations further afield. It was this agricultural trade that caused the line to be constructed in the first place, and what kept it afloat after passenger services ceased in 1927. Its Upwell depot was distant from Wisbech.Evelyn Simak: Wisbech & Upwell tramway - Upwell Depot/Townley Close. The Geograph (T5002). The line had eleven sidings, with two originally allocated for passenger traffic. During the fruit season the sidings could hold more than a hundred vans. The depot had a cattle dock, a depot office, a passenger waiting room, and a coal merchant's office and staithes. There was also an ash pit, and an old GER tender was used for a water tower until 1953 when it was removed. From the Upwell depot, which was the southern terminus of the tramway, the trains headed northwards to the village of Outwell, crossing Small Lode and passing a farm before emerging on Low Side which was the final request stop.Evelyn Simak: Wisbech & Upwell tramway - Upwell depot. The Geograph (TF5002).Evelyn Simak: Low Side. The Geograph (TF5103). A farm driveway now runs where the railway trackbed used to be.Evelyn Simak: Wisbech & Upwell tramway - Low Side The Geograph (TF5103). Running parallel with Well Creek (the old course of the River Nene) the tramway then ran along the grassy verge beside the creek before reaching the final section of reserved track at Goodman's Crossing request stop.Evelyn Simak: Wisbech & Upwell tramway - Goodman's Crossing. The Geograph (TF5103). Outwell Village depot was located by the old course of the River Nene and adjoined by St Clement's church on the other side. It originally had four sidings and was equipped with coal chutes to transfer coal to barges for distribution through the Fens. The depot had a small office building built from red brick and an old van body for storage.Evelyn Simak: Wisbech & Upwell tramway - Outwell Village depot. The Geograph (TF5103). The brick office still stands, but most of the depot site has since been built over by modern housing. The name of the cul-de-sac/access road is \\"The Tramway\\". Motorists passing through Wisbech along Elm High Road near to the fire station may notice a small stretch of grass and trees, which marks the course of the Wisbech Canal, which ran between the River Nene at Wisbech and Outwell Creek on the Middle Level Navigations. The canal succumbed to competition from the tram, though Outwell and Upwell still have some of their canals left.  In fiction  The Rev. W. Awdry, was for about 12 years, the vicar of Emneth, a village near Wisbech, and he drew much inspiration from the tramway for stories in his Railway Series children's books. In the book Toby the Tram Engine the character Toby, his coach Henrietta and later in the book Tramway Engines Mavis the Quarry Diesel are introduced, all three of whom are based on stock used on the tramway. Toby subsequently appeared in many more of the books and also became one of the main characters in the spin-off television series Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends.

For the 2011 season, the Sidewinder's trains were replaced with Vekoma's modern trains, similar to the train on Carowinds' Carolina Cobra. This ride was also the first coaster installed in the park in 14 years since the SooperDooperLooper in 1977. Each ride contains six inversions: 3 loops in the ride's structure, each of which is traversed forward and backward. History Sidewinder was built on a former catering area. This moved to the area that at the time was occupied by Kaptain Kid's Kove, and became Trailblazer's catering pavilion.Hershey Community Archives Ride experience The ride begins with riders being pulled backwards out of the station up a hill by a cable winch. At the top of the hill, the train is released, and speeds through the station and goes through the ride's three inversions, including a cobra roll and a vertical loop. The train goes up a second lift hill and, when it reaches the top, the lift disengages, and the train falls backwards through the inversions, pressing about 5 G's of force on riders (especially in the loop) before it returns to the station. The restraints on the trains have extra padding so that there is minimal discomfort, this has been used on many modern Vekoma Boomerangs. At only 935 feet long, it has the shortest track length of any roller coaster at Hersheypark.

The A32 crosses the river between the two villages, which have formed a single civil parish since 1932. It is in this parish - namely - Corhampton and Meonstoke. On the southern part of the bank is Droxford. Soberton lies to the south of the parish, Hambledon to the east and Exton to the north. History Flint implements found near Old Winchester Hill suggest that the area that is now the parish of Meonstoke was inhabited over 20,000 years ago. Later, in neolithic times a roadway developed along the South Downs, passing south of Old Winchester Hill and crossing the River Meon at Exton. There is a Neolithic stone barrow on the southern slopes of Old Winchester Hill. Also on the Hill are eight Bronze Age barrows.

The demo version was released as a \\"radio teaser\\" shortly before the release of the album's second single, \\"Got the Life\\". Music and structure The song is a rhyme duel between Jonathan Davis and Fred Durst, mixing elements of hip-hop beats, distorted 7-string guitars, and Fieldy's signature bass sound. The song begins with Jonathan and Fred insulting each other on hygiene, sexual orientation, family roots, and other things. At the ending, both say they will perform sexual acts on each other in an ironic way, in fact giving the song a confusing twist. There are lyrical references to each other's songs, including Limp Bizkit's \\"Counterfeit\\" and Korn's \\"Blind\\", \\"Shoots and Ladders\\", and \\"No Place To Hide\\". Parts of the riff from \\"Blind\\" can also be heard during Jon's insults. Musical acts Vanilla Ice, Hanson, and Winger are also tossed around as insults along with references to the 1993 Waco siege, Buffalo Bill, Jerry Springer, Austin Powers, Raggedy Ann, Zingers, Fruity Pebbles, Funkdoobiest, the Confederate flag, and the opening lyrics to Notorious B.I.G.'s \\"Mo Money Mo Problems\\". Concept After the song's release, Davis said in an interview, \\"It's just me and him ragging on each other. Some kids think that Korn and Limp Bizkit hate each other. But hey, why we would be in the same room talking to each other if we hated each other?

Davis and Durst would often offer suggestions for each other's lyrics; a lyric written by Durst as \\"tootin' on your bagpipe\\" was changed to \\"fagpipes\\" by Davis, who stated \\"I helped him bag on me better\\". In 2015, Davis would refer to the song as \\"the dumbest fucking track Korn ever did\\", attributing the song to the excessive drugs and alcohol consumed during the album's production.https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/rank-your-records-korn Media response In an otherwise positive review of the album, Rolling Stone wrote about the song: Similarly, Steve Appleford of the Los Angeles Times called the song \\"a duet of cheap insults with Bizkit's Fred Durst that only diminishes one of Korn's strongest albums\\",Steve Appleford (7 December 2003). \\"In defense of Korn: Look into this mirror: Listening to the band's rages and rants can't be called a pleasant experience, but it sure can be rewarding\\", Los Angeles Times, p.

It is one of Toronto's northernmost neighbourhoods, located along the northern boundary of Steeles Avenue in the former city of North York. The neighbourhood is so named because it contains the main campus of York University. This area is most popular with immigrants of Italian and Chinese descent who have established communities in the area. It is located between Sheppard Avenue and Steeles Avenue east of Black Creek (Derrydowns Park). The neighborhood contains many private residences, many of which are detached and semi-detached bungalows, townhouses as well as a recent new urbanism development, the Village at York, there is also a handful of condominiums, several lowrise apartments, and a few high rise apartments. History =The Village at York University= The Village at York University is one of the last major new-home developments within the City of Toronto including condominium townhouses, semi-detached and detached homes. First residents moved into the first phase of approximately 550 homes in the summer of 2005. A second phase, which started construction in 2007, adds about 300 more homes but includes no new townhouses. It is located just south of the York University campus, north of Finch Avenue. Characteristics of The Village: * It sits on land purchased from York University by the real estate developer Tribute Communities, within the boundaries of the city's secondary plan for York, and in some ways is still considered part of the university community. First-time buyers were given no-cost memberships to York's athletic facilities and privileges at its libraries. Many residents of the Village are York students and staff. * The development's design is loosely based on what is called \\"new urbanism\\", the features of which include high density, garages opening to laneways in the back, and plenty of balconies and terraces. * The neighbourhood is served by three subway stations on Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity. These stations opened on December 17, 2017 when an extension of the line was completed: Pioneer Village station runs diagonally under the intersection of Steeles Avenue West and Northwest Gate. York University station is located in the York University Commons, and Finch West station is located at the corner of Finch Avenue and Keele Street. * The Village, though no longer on university-owned land, is considered part of the broader university area by city planners, and is a component of the York University Secondary Plan. * A significant number of homes in The Village offer‚Äîor have been totally converted into‚Äîstudent housing (the Toronto Star reported in the fall of 2007 that the Village was \\"filled\\" with students ). The Village is served by a residents' group representing both renters and homeowners, which was incorporated in mid-2006. Education In the northweest of the neighbourhood is the campus for York University, which also holds Seneca College's Seneca@York campus. Two public school boards operate schools in York University Heights, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB). The French first language public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir also offer schooling to applicable residents of Morningside, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood, with CSCM/CSV students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto. Both TCDSB, and TDSB operate public elementary schools in the neighbourhood. TCDSB operates one elementary school in the neighbourhood, St. Wilfred Catholic School; whereas TDSB operate four institions that provide primary education, Elia Middle School, Lamberton Public School, Sheppard Public School, and Stilecroft Public School. Both school boards also operate public secondary schools in the neighbourhood. TCDSB operates James Cardinal McGuigan Catholic High School, whereas TDSB operates C. W. Jefferys Collegiate Institute. In addition to elementary and secondary education institutions, the northwest portion of the neighbourhood is home to two public post-secondary institutions, York University, as well as a branch of Seneca College, located at the same university campus. Demographics Major ethnic populations (2016): * 30.6% White; 12.5% Italian, 6.9% Canadian * 18.8% Black; 7.4% Jamaican * 15.2% South Asian * 9.9% Filipino * 8.4% East Indian * 6.4% Latin American (of any race) Transportation Entrance to Finch West station, a subway station in the neighbourhood. Several major roadways pass through the neighbourhood including north‚Äìsouth Keele Street, and east‚Äìwest roadways Finch and Sheppard Avenue. To the north, the neighbourhood is bounded by Steeles Avenue. =Public transit= Public transportation in the neighbourhood is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The TTC operates a number of public transportation services, including bus routes, and the Toronto subway. Three subway stations of Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity are located in the neighbourhood, Pioneer Village station on Steeles Avenue, York University station, and Finch West station on Finch Avenue. In addition to TTC services, the neighbourhood is also serviced by GO Transit's commuter rail service. Located east of the university campus, York University GO Station provides access to GO Transit's Barrie line. Access to York Region Transit, and Brampton's Z√ºm rapid bus transit may also be accessed at the bus stations in York University.

In Xybots, up to two players control \\"Major Rock Hardy\\" and \\"Captain Ace Gunn\\", who must travel through a 3D maze and fight against a series of robots known as the Xybots whose mission is to destroy all mankind. The game features a split screen display showing the gameplay on the bottom half of the screen and information on player status and the current level on the top half. Designed by Ed Logg, it was originally conceived as a sequel to his previous title, Gauntlet. The game was well received, with reviewers lauding the game's various features, particularly the cooperative multiplayer aspect. Despite this, it was met with limited financial success, which has been attributed to its unique control scheme that involves rotating the joystick to turn the player character. Xybots was ported to various personal computers and the Atari Lynx handheld. Versions for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive were announced, but never released. Emulated versions of the arcade game were later released as part of various compilations, starting with Midway Arcade Treasures 2 in 2004. Gameplay The gameplay area shows the perspectives of both characters in the lower half of the screen, with the top half being split between the player statuses and level map. One or two players navigate through corridors as either Rock Hardy or Ace Gunn, battling enemy Xybots with a laser gun, seeking cover from enemy fire behind various objects and attempting to reach the level's exit. In certain levels, players face off against a large boss Xybot. Players move using the joystick, which also rotates to turn the player character. The lower half the screen shows the gameplay area for both players while the upper half is split between the map for the current level and the status display for each player. The display shows the player's remaining energy, which can be replenished by collecting energy pods within the levels. Energy can also be purchased at shops between levels, using coins dropped by defeated Xybots. The player can also purchase power-ups at these shops, including extra armor, increased speed, strength and firepower along with maze and enemy maps. Development The concept for the game was born out of an attempt by designer Ed Logg and engineer/technician Doug Snyder to create a first-person video game without specialized hardware. In 2005, Logg recalled that he had trouble with the controls for the game‚Äîboth building controls that worked with the game design and getting players to realize they could rotate the joystick to turn the in-game characters. Because of these difficulties, Logg was unsure if the game would enter mass production. Originally Logg envisioned the game as a second sequel to Gauntlet titled Gauntlet III: Catacombs. However, the marketing department at Atari Games did not want to make another Gauntlet game and made him change the title. Logg and co-programmer Bob Flannagan eventually settled on a theme based on Major Havoc, a previous Atari arcade game. Reception Upon release, the game was positively reviewed. It drew favorable comparisons to both Berzerk and Gauntlet for its maze-like stages and shooting gameplay. The game's various features, including the cooperative gameplay, were praised, with Computer and Video Games and The Games Machine citing them as aspects that made the game addictive. Commodore User also cited the two-player game as a highlight, saying \\"its real appeal is as a team game, with you and your mate running about the place, covering each other, dividing up and destroying all the robots in the maze, and lending one another gold coins in the shop.\\" Ed Logg recalled in 2005 that the game was not a financial success. GamesTM wrote that \\"Xybots was overlooked in arcades due to its complex controls and tricky gameplay\\" and that its lack of earnings in arcades was the reason no sequel was ever developed. In retrospect, they wrote that the game was \\"ahead of its time\\" and \\"offered a unique experience that similar games of the era were unable to match.\\" Ports Lynx box art by Marc Ericksen Xybots was ported to MSX, Commodore 64, Amstrad, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, and Amiga. In 1991, the Atari Games subsidiary Tengen released a version of the game for the handheld Atari Lynx. =Unreleased= A version for the Sega Genesis by Tengen had been announced at the 1990 Winter Consumer Electronics Show alongside ports of the Atari Games titles Paperboy and Hard Drivin', but while the latter two games were released for the system, Xybots was not. A planned Nintendo Entertainment System port from Tengen also went unreleased. Legacy Having acquired the rights to the Atari Games arcade library through its parent company Williams, Midway released the arcade version of Xybots as part of the 2004 console compilation Midway Arcade Treasures 2, as well as Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for Microsoft Windows.The arcade version also saw release on the PSP as part of Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play. With the dissolution of Midway in 2009, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment picked up the rights to Midway's arcade titles, releasing Xybots for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as part of Midway Arcade Origins and for various other platforms through the Lego Dimensions Midway Arcade Level Pack.

It is a seasonal tributary that flows into the Helena River with a catchment that moves through a number of hills suburbs just east of the Darling Scarp. Its source is in Mahogany Creek, and it flows through Glen Forrest, Darlington, and Boya before meeting the Helena River at Helena Valley. It was originally known as the Smiths Mill Brook on maps between 1902 and 1920. In the 1920s it became known as Nyaania Brook, and in 1945 it officially took the current name. Its importance stems from the fact that it flows through private land for most of its length, linked to issues that affect watercourses in the Darling Scarp region: * usages of herbicides and other contaminants that can become waterborne * excess nutrients from fertilisers used in domestic gardens * inappropriate exotic weeds that flourish in difficult to access locations. It has significant areas of reserves either adjacent, or within either side of its main creek bed. It runs in a number of places along what was rail reserve of the Eastern Railwaywhich is now the southern part of the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail. Upper reaches The creek is small in size and width and moves through numerous private properties. The upper portion of the creek has the Strettle Road Reserve on its north side - which is at the west end of Mahogany Creek which although completely a regenerated plot of land following extensive firing and logging in the last hundred years is a significant reserve. Near the ex- Statham quarry in Glen Forrest it enters into its first reserve, the Thomas Park reserve. In Glen Forrest the Glen Forrest Super Block is on its south side just prior to the border with Darlington and near Devil's Terror. Devil's Terror Springs Historically it achieved its significance in the construction of the Eastern Railway where a surveyed route of the railway encountered difficulties with the creek and creek bed. As a cutting was being constructed (near the bottom of Dalry Rd) clay was struck followed by an underground stream which flooded the clay and turned it into a bottomless bog. The locality earned the name in the Perth newspapers of the 1880s as The Devil's Terror and they cite the example of workers sinking in mud. That section of the railway had to be resurveyed and was shifted 100 meters south along the bed of Nyaania creek. The creek above Glen Forrest was diverted into Chittawarra Brook while a dam was thrown across the creek just to the west of Glen Forrest to hold back the water while a man made channel was built to replace the original creek bed. On completion of the channel the dam wall was breached and Nyaania Creek was allowed to run into the new channel. As a result of this construction the creek bed now runs along the top of the 3 to 5 meter deep cutting. In winter the water can be heard rushing just above ones head as they walk through the cutting. For the duration of the Eastern Railway route usage (1880s to 1953) the Nyaania Creek/Eastern Railway/Devil's Terror location point of coincidence has had springs under or next to the railway line. The sleepers and rails were removed in the mid 1960s, and ever since they have subsisted even when the Nyaania Creek is dry in the middle of a drought. Many users of the subsequent Railway Reserve Heritage Trail have had a particular attraction to their persistence. Lower reaches Having passed through the built up area of Darlington it proceeds into a steep valley south of the riding school in Glen Road, and enters Helena River in Helena Valley. Rehabilitation In the 2000s surrounding bushland was focused as rehabilitation areas.http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23604/20020213-0000/www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/media/media.nsf/8bffe6751fd86a6d482566ba00835f3a/3c34201355dbcc56482569fc0037e1f502ec.html Notes References * Category:Watercourses of Western Australia Category:Darling Range Category:Darlington, Western Australia Category:Eastern Railway (Western Australia) ","title":"Nyaania Creek"},{"id":"5987473","text":"Pamber is a civil parish located in the north of Hampshire, England, near the border with Berkshire.

She is a major figure in post-Tanzimat Turkish poetry.  Life and poetry  Nig√¢r was born in Istanbul to Macar Osman Pasha, an Ottoman nobleman of Hungarian origin. She was educated at the Kadƒ±k√∂y Fransƒ±z Mektebi (French School in Kadƒ±k√∂y), later receiving lectures at home from private teachers. She was able to speak eight different languages and play piano at a young age. She was married at age fourteen, but divorced after a few years of great unhappiness. Her early poetry is in the traditional divan style, but later she was influenced by Recaizade Mahmut Ekrem and others, and adopted a more modernist stance, influenced by the Western poetry of her time. She was well versed in the cultures of East and West, and knew French, Greek, Arabic, and German.Nazan Bekiroƒülu, ≈ûair Nigar Hanƒ±m, Istanbul, 2008, p. 241 Her book Efsus was the first poetry book written in Western style of poetry by a woman author. Like Mihr√Æ Hatun, and possibly the first woman poet since her, her femininity is not hidden. Her writing style, choice of themes and presentation reflects a very feminine sensibility. Apart from poetry, she wrote prose and made several translations. In her personal life, she was an important and well-known figure in the society of her time. Apart from her career as a poet, her life-style, outgoing personality and choice of clothing had a wide influence on society and the perspective of women at the time. Although it is not possible to say that she was a feminist, her view of woman rights was much ahead of her time. Her humanitarian work was recognised by the award of the Order of Charity (≈ûefkat Ni≈üanƒ±). She became increasingly isolated in the last years of her life, and was in great pain.

Lehmann (born September 7, 1955 in Newark, New Jersey) is an American chemist and spectroscopist at the University of Virginia, best known for his work in the area of intramolecular and collisional dynamics, and for his advances in the method of cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS). Raised in Irvington, New Jersey, a suburb of Newark, Lehmann studied chemical physics and mathematics at Rutgers University's Cook College, graduating with highest honors in 1977. His undergraduate research included work in reaction dynamics with John Krenos and John Tully of Bell Laboratories, photoelectron spectroscopy with Joseph Berkowitz of Argonne National Laboratory, and raman and resonate multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopies under Professor Lionel Goodman. Lehmann went on to receive his doctorate in chemical physics from Harvard University in 1983, and was elected to the Harvard Society of Fellows, where he was a junior fellow until 1986. Under the direction of William Klemperer, Lehmann's graduate work involved studies of highly excited vibrational states using photoacoustic spectroscopy. During his time as a fellow, he served as a visiting scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's George Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory. There he developed with Stephen Coy the technique of microwave-detected, microwave-optical double resonance, which permits the automatic assignment of complex spectra. Appointed to the chemistry faculty of Princeton University in 1985, Lehmann received both the Henry and Camille Dreyfus Award for new faculty and the Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation in his first year with the university. In 1987, the university acknowledged him with the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award. He was promoted to associate professor in 1991, and to full professor in 1995, the same year he was named a fellow of the American Physical Society. He received the Thomas A. Edison Patent Award in 2002 for his work in CRDS, and in 2003, was granted the Earle K. Plyler Prize in Molecular Spectroscopy. Lehmann left Princeton in 2005 to join the faculty of the University of Virginia, where he has continued his work in development of ultrasensitive spectroscopic methods with applications in trace gas detection, as well as studies of molecular dynamics in the gas phase and superfluid helium.

The 2011 Census recorded its population as 982. The parish also includes the hamlet of Dean, Farley Mount Country Park and Crab Wood SSSI. Archaeology There are Bronze Age bowl and disc barrows in the parish. Just west of the village are the remains of Sparsholt Roman Villa. It was built in phases from the 2nd to the 4th century, and then abandoned. It was excavated in 1965‚Äì72. Nothing is visible at the site today, but finds from the excavations are on display in Winchester City Museum. A replica of one wing of the villa has been built at Butser Ancient Farm. There was a village at Lainston. It is now abandoned, leaving only the ruin of its 12th-century parish church of Saint Peter, which is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Toponym The earliest known record of the toponym is as Speoresholt in an Anglo-Saxon charter from AD 901 now reproduced in the Cartularium Saxonicum. The name is derived from Old English and probably means \\"wood where spear-shafts were obtained\\". A late-Saxon manuscript from about 1060‚Äì66, now reproduced in the Codex Diplomaticus Aevi Saxonici, records it as Sp√¶resholt. A pipe roll from 1167 records it as Speresholt. Spellings from the 16th century onwards included Sparshall and Spershott. Parish church Inside the nave of St Stephen's church, looking east to the chancel The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint Stephen in Sparsholt are also 12th-century. Early in the 13th century it was enlarged by adding a south aisle and arcade to the nave. The chancel was rebuilt in the 14th century. The chancel arch, west tower and some of the windows are 15th-century. The south doorway was added in 1631. The organ screen and lectern are also 17th-century. The church was restored in 1883 under the direction of the architect William Butterfield. It is a Grade II* listed building. The west tower has a ring of six bells. Until the 20th century it had only four bells: a treble, third and tenor cast in 1742 by Robert Catlin of Holborn and a second cast by Thomas II Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1829. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry recast the three Catlin bells in 1905. In 1951 the same founders cast a new tenor, increasing the ring to five. In 1995 the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast a new treble bell, increasing the ring to six. St Stephen's parish is now one of five churches in The Downs Benefice. The others are at Chilbolton, Crawley, Littleton and Wherwell. Notable buildings northwest of the village is Sparsholt College,Sparsholt College a leading land based college on the edge of the village, from which BBC Radio 4's Gardeners' Question Time series broadcasts from its \\"potting shed\\". northeast of the village is the Lainston House, a 17th-century country house that is now an h√¥tel.Lainston House Sparsholt Manor was the home of businessman and philanthropist, Sir Adrian Swire. Amenities The Plough Inn Sparsholt has a pub, the Plough Inn, which is controlled by Wadworth Brewery.The Plough Inn Stagecoach South bus route 7 links Sparsholt with Winchester bus station.

It can be understood as an instantaneous increment of the Lagrangian expression of the problem that is to be optimized over a certain time period. Inspired by, but distinct from, the Hamiltonian of classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian of optimal control theory was developed by Lev Pontryagin as part of his maximum principle. Pontryagin proved that a necessary condition for solving the optimal control problem is that the control should be chosen so as to optimize the Hamiltonian.  Problem statement and definition of the Hamiltonian  Consider a dynamical system of n first-order differential equations :\\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\\\mathbf{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) where \\\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\\\left[ x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), \\\\ldots, x_{n}(t) \\\\right]^{\\\\mathsf{T}} denotes a vector of state variables, and \\\\mathbf{u}(t) = \\\\left[ u_{1}(t), u_{2}(t), \\\\ldots, u_{r}(t) \\\\right]^{\\\\mathsf{T}} a vector of control variables. Once initial conditions \\\\mathbf{x}(t_{0}) = \\\\mathbf{x}_{0} and controls \\\\mathbf{u}(t) are specified, a solution to the differential equations, called a trajectory \\\\mathbf{x}(t; \\\\mathbf{x}_{0}, t_{0}), can be found. The problem of optimal control is to choose \\\\mathbf{u}(t) (from some compact and convex set \\\\mathcal{U} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{r}) so that \\\\mathbf{x}(t) maximizes or minimizes a certain objective function between an initial time t = t_{0} and a terminal time t = t_{1} (where t_{1} may be infinity). Specifically, the goal is to optimize a performance index I(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) at each point in time, :\\\\max_{\\\\mathbf{u}(t)} J = \\\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} I(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t subject to the above equations of motion of the state variables. The solution method involves defining an ancillary function known as the Hamiltonian (t) \\\\mathbf{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) cellpadding border border colour = #50C878 background colour = #ECFCF4}} which combines the objective function and the state equations much like a Lagrangian in a static optimization problem, only that the multipliers \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t), referred to as costate variables, are functions of time rather than constants. The goal is to find an optimal control policy function \\\\mathbf{u}^\\\\ast(t) and, with it, an optimal trajectory of the state variable \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\ast(t), which by Pontryagin's maximum principle are the arguments that maximize the Hamiltonian, :H(\\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\ast(t),\\\\mathbf{u}^\\\\ast(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t),t) \\\\geq H(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t),t) for all \\\\mathbf{u}(t) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U} The first-order necessary conditions for a maximum are given by :\\\\frac{\\\\partial H(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t),t)}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}} = 0 which generates I_{\\\\mathbf{u}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\mathbf{u}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) = 0, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial H(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t),t)}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}} = - \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}}(t) which generates \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}}(t) = - \\\\left[ I_{\\\\mathbf{x}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\mathbf{x}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) \\\\right] the latter of which are referred to as the costate equations. Together, the state and costate equations describe the Hamiltonian dynamical system (again analogous to but distinct from the Hamiltonian system in physics), the solution of which involves a two-point boundary value problem, given that there are 2n boundary conditions involving two different points in time, the initial time (the n differential equations for the state variables), and the terminal time (the n differential equations for the costate variables; unless a final function is specified, the boundary conditions are \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t_{1}) = 0, or \\\\lim_{t_{1} \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t_{1}) = 0 for infinite time horizons). A sufficient condition for a maximum is the concavity of the Hamiltonian evaluated at the solution, i.e. :H_{\\\\mathbf{uu}}(\\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\ast(t),\\\\mathbf{u}^\\\\ast(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t),t) \\\\leq 0 where \\\\mathbf{u}^\\\\ast(t) is the optimal control, and \\\\mathbf{x}^\\\\ast(t) is resulting optimal trajectory for the state variable. Alternatively, by a result due to Olvi L. Mangasarian, the necessary conditions are sufficient if the functions I(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) and \\\\mathbf{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) are both concave in \\\\mathbf{x}(t) and \\\\mathbf{u}(t). = Derivation from the Lagrangian = A constrained optimization problem as the one stated above usually suggests a Lagrangian expression, specifically :L = \\\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} I(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\left[ \\\\mathbf{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) - \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}(t) \\\\right] \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t where the \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t) compare to the Lagrange multiplier in a static optimization problem but are now, as noted above, a function of time. Proceeding with a Legendre transformation, the last term on the right- hand side can be rewritten using integration by parts, such that :\\\\- \\\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}}(t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t = -\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t_{1}) \\\\mathbf{x}(t_{1}) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t_{0}) \\\\mathbf{x}(t_{0}) + \\\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t which can be substituted back into the Lagrangian expression to give :L = \\\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \\\\left[ I(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\right] \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}t - \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t_{1}) \\\\mathbf{x}(t_{1}) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t_{0}) \\\\mathbf{x}(t_{0}) To derive the first- order conditions for an optimum, assume that the solution has been found and the Lagrangian is maximized. Then any change to \\\\mathbf{x}(t) or \\\\mathbf{u}(t) must cause the value of the Lagrangian to decline. Specifically, the total derivative of L obeys :\\\\mathrm{d}L = \\\\int_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}} \\\\left[ \\\\left( I_{\\\\mathbf{u}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\mathbf{u}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) \\\\right) \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{u}(t) + \\\\left( I_{\\\\mathbf{x}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\mathbf{x}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}}(t) \\\\right) \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\right] \\\\mathrm{d}t - \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t_{1}) \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{x}(t_{1}) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t_{0}) \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{x}(t_{0}) \\\\leq 0 For this expression to equal zero necessitates the following optimization conditions: :\\\\begin{align} I_{\\\\mathbf{u}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\mathbf{u}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_{\\\\mathbf{x}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{f}_{\\\\mathbf{x}}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t)} &= 0 \\\\end{align} If both the initial value \\\\mathbf{x}(t_{0}) and terminal value \\\\mathbf{x}(t_{1}) are fixed, i.e. \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{x}(t_{0}) = \\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{x}(t_{1}) = 0, no conditions on \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t_{0}) and \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t_{1}) are needed. If the terminal value is free, as is often the case, the additional condition \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t_{1}) = 0 is necessary for optimality. The latter is called a transversality condition for a fixed horizon problem. It can be seen that the necessary conditions are identical to the ones stated above for the Hamiltonian. Thus the Hamiltonian can be understood as a device to generate the first-order necessary conditions.  The Hamiltonian in discrete time  When the problem is formulated in discrete time, the Hamiltonian is defined as: : H(x_{t},u_{t},\\\\lambda_{t},t)=\\\\lambda^T_{t+1}f(x_{t},u_{t},t)+I(x_{t},u_{t},t) \\\\, and the costate equations are : \\\\lambda_{t+1}^\\\\top=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial x_{t}} + \\\\lambda_{t}^\\\\top (Note that the discrete time Hamiltonian at time t involves the costate variable at time t+1. This small detail is essential so that when we differentiate with respect to x we get a term involving \\\\lambda(t+1) on the right hand side of the costate equations. Using a wrong convention here can lead to incorrect results, i.e. a costate equation which is not a backwards difference equation).  Behavior of the Hamiltonian over time  From Pontryagin's maximum principle, special conditions for the Hamiltonian can be derived. When the final time t_1 is fixed and the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial t} = 0\\\\right), then: :H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\\\\lambda^*(t)) = \\\\mathrm{constant}\\\\, or if the terminal time is free, then: :H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\\\\lambda^*(t)) = 0.\\\\, Further, if the terminal time tends to infinity, a transversality condition on the Hamiltonian applies. :\\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} H(t) = 0  The Hamiltonian of control compared to the Hamiltonian of mechanics  William Rowan Hamilton defined the Hamiltonian for describing the mechanics of a system. It is a function of three variables: :\\\\mathcal{H} = \\\\mathcal{H}(p,q,t) = \\\\langle p,\\\\dot{q} \\\\rangle -L(q,\\\\dot{q},t) where L is the Lagrangian, the extremizing of which determines the dynamics (not the Lagrangian defined above), q is the state variable and \\\\dot{q} is its time derivative. p is the so-called \\"conjugate momentum\\", defined by :p = \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{q}} Hamilton then formulated his equations to describe the dynamics of the system as :\\\\frac{ d}{ dt}p(t) = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial q}\\\\mathcal{H} :\\\\frac{ d}{ dt}q(t) =~~\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial p}\\\\mathcal{H} The Hamiltonian of control theory describes not the dynamics of a system but conditions for extremizing some scalar function thereof (the Lagrangian) with respect to a control variable u. As normally defined, it is a function of 4 variables :H(q,u,p,t)= \\\\langle p,\\\\dot{q} \\\\rangle -L(q,u,t) where q is the state variable and uis the control variable with respect to that which we are extremizing. The associated conditions for a maximum are :\\\\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial q} :\\\\frac{dq}{dt} = ~~\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial p} :\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial u} = 0 This definition agrees with that given by the article by Sussmann and Willems. (see p. 39, equation 14). Sussmann and Willems show how the control Hamiltonian can be used in dynamics e.g. for the brachistochrone problem, but do not mention the prior work of Carath√©odory on this approach.See  Current value and present value Hamiltonian  In economics, the objective function in dynamic optimization problems often depends directly on time only through exponential discounting, such that it takes the form :I(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) = e^{-\\\\rho t} u(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t)) where u(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t)) is referred to as the instantaneous utility function, or felicity function. This allows a redefinition of the Hamiltonian as H(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t),t) = e^{-\\\\rho t} \\\\bar{H}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t)) where :\\\\begin{align} \\\\bar{H}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t)) \\\\equiv& \\\\, e^{\\\\rho t} \\\\left[ I(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ =& \\\\, u(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) + \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}(t) \\\\mathbf{f}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),t) \\\\end{align} which is referred to as the current value Hamiltonian, in contrast to the present value Hamiltonian H(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t),t) defined in the first section. Most notably the costate variables are redefined as \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}(t) = e^{\\\\rho t} \\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t), which leads to modified first-order conditions. :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{H}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t))}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}} = 0, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{H}(\\\\mathbf{x}(t),\\\\mathbf{u}(t),\\\\mathbf{\\\\lambda}(t))}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{x}} = - \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}}(t) + \\\\rho \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}(t) which follows immediately from the product rule. Economically, \\\\mathbf{\\\\mu}(t) represent current-valued shadow prices for the capital goods \\\\mathbf{x}(t).  Example: Ramsey‚ÄìCass‚ÄìKoopmans model  In economics, the Ramsey‚ÄìCass‚ÄìKoopmans model is used to determine an optimal savings behavior for an economy. The objective function J(c) is the social welfare function, :J(c) = \\\\int^T_0 e^{-\\\\rho t}u(c(t)) dt to be maximized by choice of an optimal consumption path c(t). The function u(c(t)) indicates the utility the representative agent of consuming c at any given point in time. The factor e^{-\\\\rho t} represents discounting. The maximization problem is subject to the following differential equation for capital intensity, describing the time evolution of capital per effective worker: :\\\\dot{k}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial k}{\\\\partial t} =f(k(t)) - (n + \\\\delta)k(t) - c(t) where c(t) is period t consumption, k(t) is period t capital per worker (with k(0) = k_{0} > 0), f(k(t)) is period t production, n is the population growth rate, \\\\delta is the capital depreciation rate, the agent discounts future utility at rate \\\\rho, with u'>0 and u<0. Here, k(t) is the state variable which evolves according to the above equation, and c(t) is the control variable. The Hamiltonian becomes :H(k,c,\\\\mu,t)=e^{-\\\\rho t}u(c(t))+\\\\mu(t)\\\\dot{k}=e^{-\\\\rho t}u(c(t))+\\\\mu(t)[f(k(t)) - (n + \\\\delta)k(t) - c(t)] The optimality conditions are :\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial c}=0 \\\\Rightarrow e^{-\\\\rho t}u'(c)=\\\\mu(t) :\\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial k}=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mu}{\\\\partial t}=-\\\\dot{\\\\mu} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\mu(t)[f'(k)-(n+\\\\delta)]=-\\\\dot{\\\\mu} in addition to the transversality condition \\\\mu(T)k(T)=0. If we let u(c)=\\\\log(c), then log-differentiating the first optimality condition with respect to t yields :-\\\\rho-\\\\frac{\\\\dot{c}}{c(t)}=\\\\frac{\\\\dot{\\\\mu}}{\\\\mu(t)} Inserting this equation into the second optimality condition yields :\\\\rho+\\\\frac{\\\\dot{c}}{c(t)}=f'(k)-(n+\\\\delta) which is known as the Keynes‚ÄìRamsey rule, which gives a condition for consumption in every period which, if followed, ensures maximum lifetime utility.

The village is in the valley of the River Anton, upstream from the point where it joins the River Test at the south. Clatford is to the south from Andover town centre, the most direct route the old railway line which is now a public footpath. Along this path is evidence of the old railway line although little is seen of the earlier canal that preceded the railway. The canal and later railway were important to the local economy, in particular for the transport of raw materials from Southampton via Andover to Upper Clatford for Taskers of Andover, whose premises were in nearby Anna Valley. Pig Iron was shipped from Southampton via the canal to Taskers Wharf, originally where the footpath now leaves Upper Clatford for Andover. The road south out of the village leads to the twin village of Goodworth Clatford (formerly Lower Clatford). Clatford is an old English term meaning 'the ford where the burdock grows'. The village historically contained four manors: Norman Court, Sackville Court, Clatford Manor and Clatford Mills. Stephen Hopkins, passenger on the Mayflower and one of the signatories of the Mayflower Compact, was baptized at Clatford.Robert Charles Anderson, New England Historical Genealogical Society (NEHGS) Pilgrim Family Sketch Stephen Hopkins Significant buildings at Clatford include thatched cottages and houses including the local public house The Crook and Shears, and the local parish church of All Saints, which was first built probably during the reign of Henry I (1100-1135).

Local anesthesia is an anesthetic drug (which can be given as a shot, spray, or ointment) that numbs only a small, specific area of the body (for example, a foot, hand, or patch of skin). With local anesthesia, a person is awake while sedated. Local anesthesia lasts for a short period of time and is often used for minor outpatient procedures (when patients come in for surgery and can go home that same day). For someone having outpatient surgery in a clinic or doctor's office (such as the dentist or dermatologist), this anesthetic is likely used. The medicine can numb the area during the procedure and for a short time afterwards to help control post-surgery discomfort. The function of this instrument involves successfully piercing the surface of the periodontal ligament so the patient can be distributed the anesthesia. Past devices have proven to be insufficient because it instilled fear in patients and made it exhaustingly uncomfortable for dentists to use because of the bulky size. With how simple it is to hide it in the hand due to the smaller size of modern day anesthetic syringes, dentists are successfully able to maneuver in a patient's mouth without causing harm to the patient being treated, allowing for a quick insert of the anesthesia followed by the dentist being able move on swiftly to the next task of the dental visit. Another aspect of the syringe is the capability of use, which means dentists are able to easily insert fluid in the device and follow the color coded instructions that allow for efficient use of the dental instrument. The device is so intricately sized that doctors are able to grip it well enough to get the job done. Some anesthetic syringes also include a power handle that gives the doctor less of a responsibility over the amount of pressure needed to push in the medicine because the power handle has settings that let the dentist set an amount for how much anesthetic they want to be produced. Dental handpieces A high-speed dental handpiece Dental handpieces come in many various types which include: High-speed air driven (also known as an airotor), slow-speed, friction grip, and surgical handpiece. Dental laser A dental laser is a type of laser designed specifically for use in oral surgery or dentistry. The use of a laser can decrease morbidity after surgery, and reduces the need for anesthetics. Because of the cauterization of tissue there will be little bleeding following soft tissue procedures, and some risks of alternative electrosurgery procedures are avoided. Dental torque wrench A dental torque wrench or restorative torque wrench is a torque wrench used to precisely apply a specific torque to a fastener screw for fixation of an abutment, dentures, or prosthetics on a dental implant. Burs The cutting surfaces of dental burs are made of a multi-fluted tungsten carbide, a diamond coated tip, or a stainless steel multi-fluted rosehead. There are many types and classifications of burs. Some of the most common are: the round bur (sizes ¬º to 10) or inverted cone (sizes 33¬Ω to 90L). Burs are also classified by the type of shank. For instance a latch type, or right angle bur, is only used in the slow speed handpiece with contra-angle attachment. Long shank or shaft is only used in the slow speed when the contra-angle is not in use, and finally a friction grip bur, which is a small bur, is used only in the high-speed handpiece. There are many bur shapes that are utilized in various specific procedures. =Operative burs= Flat fissure, pear-shaped, football, round, tapered, flame, chamfer, bevel, end cut, bud bur, steel, inverted cone, diamond, brown stone, and green-stone Restorative instruments =Excavators=Spoon excavator: Used to remove soft carious decay *Half hollenbach: Used to test for overhangs or flash *Dental hatchers: Used to widen the entrance of the tooth cavity and slice away the thin carious enamel *Chisels: Straight - bevels the cavosurface margin and used in 3, 4, and 5 classifications of cavities on the maxillary Wedelstaedt - only used in the anterior for classes 3, 4, and 5 Bin Angle - this is held in a pen grasp and used for class 2 maxillary only BurnishersBall burnisher *Beavertail burnisher *Cone burnisher *Flat plastic *Pear shaped burnisher Burnishers are used for polishing and contouring amalgam fillings and to polish composite fillings.

In 1840, Sir John Tomes and his friend Evrard made the first pair of dental forceps. In 1841, Tomes posted an article to tell the whole world about his discovery of new forceps that had never been seen before, successfully becoming the creator of the forceps and the concept of forceps. In earlier times, or during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, elevators and pelicans were used as extraction devices because the idea of dental forceps did not exist, but the thought of extracting in the first place with some form of a tool was there. With pelicans, their sharp talons were used to be placed down on the inside of the mouth near the gums while the elevator helped pull the tooth out of its socket. Then, a pair of pincers would do the rest of the job, wiggling the tooth out of the gum until the extraction was complete. The functionality of today's dental forceps come from the need to remove items from the mouth such as the cotton balls dentists place next to a patient's teeth or the rubber bands a patient needs for their braces.

History =Roman times= The village is on the line of an ancient Roman road, the Chichester to Silchester Way. =Norman times= The Grey derives from the years when the village was owned by the de Grey family and was used to differentiate the village from the many other Uptons. =Elizabethan times= The Manor House dates from Elizabethan times when the Matthew family lived there. The famous Elizabethan poet, George Puttenham, lived at Herriard House but also had a farm at Upton Grey. It was there that he kept his seventeen- year-old sex slave whom he had kidnapped in London. Eventually she was released when Puttenham's long suffering wife discovered her existence. Buildings =Manor House= Charles Holme purchased several houses and a great deal of the surrounding land in Upton Grey. The Old Manor House, which he rented to tenants for the rest of his life, was in fragile condition. Holme then commissioned a local architect Ernest Newton to refurbish it, keeping many of the original timbers. Today's Edwardian decoration encloses oak rooms, a 16th-century staircase and original roof timbers. Newton's house was finished in 1907. Gertrude Jekyll created a four and a half acre garden around it. =Hoddington House= Hoddington House is a Grade II* Listed mansion built around 1700 by John Limbrey. Described by Nikolaus Pevsner as ‚Äòby far the best house‚Äô in Upton Grey, it is built on the site of a religious house called Edyndon, a monastery affiliated to the Abbey of Beaulieu in the New Forest.Property details http://search.knightfrank.com/cho100437 It was the childhood home of George Sclater-Booth, 1st Baron Basing and his brother, the naturalist Philip Sclater. =St Mary's Church= Monuments in St Mary's, Church include an alabaster wall monument to Dorothy Bulstrode, Lady Eyre (1592-1650), a lady in waiting to Anne of Denmark, with her portrait bust and heraldry.'Parishes: Upton Grey', in A History of the County of Hampshire, vol. 3, ed.

The encoded protein has also been identified as the beta subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1). A t(1;12)(q21;p13) translocation, which results in a TEL-ARNT fusion protein, is associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Three alternatively spliced variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is involved in the induction of several enzymes that participate in xenobiotic metabolism. The ligand-free, cytosolic form of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor is complexed to heat shock protein 90. Binding of ligand, which includes dioxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, results in translocation of the ligand-binding subunit only into the nucleus. Induction of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism occurs through binding of the ligand-bound AhR to xenobiotic responsive elements in the promoters of genes for these enzymes.

It was typically associated with making a visa application at a visa office located outside of one's home country. The term \\"consulate shopping\\" may have appeared by analogy with \\"forum shopping\\" - choosing the best jurisdiction for litigation. In the past, \\"consulate shopping\\" was not an uncommon practice for both visitor and permanent resident visas. For example, a Russian citizen would choose to apply for a visitor visa to the US at a US consulate somewhere in Eastern Europe, rather than one in Russia, based on the belief that, due to different office cultures of the consular staff, the likelihood of rejection would be lower, say, in Budapest than in Moscow. Similarly, a person planning a trip to mainland China may plan on obtaining his or her visitor's visa in a visa office in Hong Kong, immediately before entering the mainland, instead of doing it in advance in their own home country. When applying for permanent residence in Canada, a person living in India, but possessing a multiple entry visitor visa to the UK or a Schengen country could choose to file his application with a Canadian visa office in European, rather than one in India, because the posted processing times were supposed to be much shorter in Europe. Lately, many countries cut down on the practice of consulate shopping by requiring that permanent residence visa applications, and often visitor visa applications as well, be filed only in visa offices within the country of the applicant's citizenship of residence. As of the summer 2008 People's Republic of China joined this trend, requiring all visa applicants only to apply in the Chinese consulate in the country where they are citizens or permanent residents; moreover, in some countries served by multiple consulates (as the USA is), the application must be filed in the consular district serving the area where the applicant resides.Monday, 11 August 2008: New China visa rules An important exception to that trend is that as of July 2010 the U.S. Consulates in China have liberalized their appointment policy. Now, persons who reside in Mainland China can choose to apply for a nonimmigrant visa at any of the Mainland posts‚ÄîBeijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shanghai, or Shenyang.Gary Chodorow, Shopping for a U.S. Consulate in China, (July 8, 2010) References Sidley Austin Brown & Wood (December 7, 2001) \\"The United States responds to terrorism: An analysis of current legislation, immigration controls and the economic environment\\", page 3. * Jenkins, Rosemary (December 2001). \\"The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001: A Summary of the Anti-Terrorism Law's Immigration-Related Provisions\\".

Her keel was laid down in 1944 under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1329) by the Barrett, Hilp & Belair Shipyard in San Francisco, California (Type B7-D1). She was acquired by the Navy on 5 March 1944 as Midnight (the second ship of that name), designated unclassified miscellaneous vessel IX-149, and placed in service on 9 March 1944 with Lieutenant Neal King, USNR, in charge. Service history =World War II, 1944-1945= Midnight completed conversion for Navy use on 28 March and was assigned to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet. That same day, she was towed out of San Francisco, California, on her way to the Central Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she continued her voyage and arrived in Majuro Lagoon on 4 May. For the next five months, she served at Majuro and Eniwetok. During that time, she was renamed Trefoil on 10 June 1944. On 5 October, towed her out of Eniwetok and on to Ulithi where she arrived on 16 October. She remained there for ten months on duty with Service Squadron 8. In August 1945, she was towed from Ulithi to Leyte in the Philippines where she arrived on 28 August. Trefoil remained there until 9 November, when she was towed out for Guam in the Mariana Islands. The barge reached Apra Harbor on 16 November.US navy, Beans, Bullets, and Black Oil, Naval History and Heritage Command, page 139 =Post- war activities, 1945-1948= Trefoil served at Guam for the remainder of her Navy career. Early in 1946, she was chosen as one of the support ships for \\"Operation Crossroads\\", the atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll that summer. However, soon thereafter, that decision was rescinded and another made to dispose of her. Action on that decision was also deferred, and she was used to house Stockton-Pollack employees building a drydock in Apra Harbor. Her reprieve ended in September 1947 when she was determined to be in excess of the needs of the Navy. =Disposal= On 28 May 1948, the barge was turned over to the Foreign Liquidations Commission of the United States Department of State for disposal, and she was sold to the Asia Development Corporation of Shanghai, China. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 December 1948. The barge, however, remained at Apra Harbor because she was impounded due to a dispute over ownership of the vessel between the Asia Development Corporation and Moellers, Limited, of Hong Kong. Resolution of the dispute and final disposition of the barge is unknown.

It tries to determine how likely certain outcomes are if some aspects of the system are not exactly known. An example would be to predict the acceleration of a human body in a head-on crash with another car: even if we exactly knew the speed, small differences in the manufacturing of individual cars, how tightly every bolt has been tightened, etc., will lead to different results that can only be predicted in a statistical sense. Many problems in the natural sciences and engineering are also rife with sources of uncertainty. Computer experiments on computer simulations are the most common approach to study problems in uncertainty quantification.Ronald L. Iman, Jon C. Helton, \\"An Investigation of Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis Techniques for Computer Models\\", Risk Analysis, Volume 8, Issue 1, pages 71‚Äì90, March 1988, W.E. Walker, P. Harremo√´s, J.

Krayer von Krauss, \\"Defining Uncertainty: A Conceptual Basis for Uncertainty Management in Model-Based Decision Support\\", Integrated Assessment, Volume 4, Issue 1, 2003, Sources of uncertainty Uncertainty can enter mathematical models and experimental measurements in various contexts. One way to categorize the sources of uncertainty is to consider: ; Parameter uncertainty: This comes from the model parameters that are inputs to the computer model (mathematical model) but whose exact values are unknown to experimentalists and cannot be controlled in physical experiments, or whose values cannot be exactly inferred by statistical methods. Some examples of this are the local free-fall acceleration in a falling object experiment, various material properties in a finite element analysis for engineering, and multiplier uncertainty in the context of macroeconomic policy optimization. ; Parametric variability: This comes from the variability of input variables of the model. For example, the dimensions of a work piece in a process of manufacture may not be exactly as designed and instructed, which would cause variability in its performance. ; Structural uncertainty: Also known as model inadequacy, model bias, or model discrepancy, this comes from the lack of knowledge of the underlying physics in the problem. It depends on how accurately a mathematical model describes the true system for a real-life situation, considering the fact that models are almost always only approximations to reality. One example is when modeling the process of a falling object using the free-fall model; the model itself is inaccurate since there always exists air friction. In this case, even if there is no unknown parameter in the model, a discrepancy is still expected between the model and true physics. ; Algorithmic uncertainty: Also known as numerical uncertainty, or discrete uncertainty. This type comes from numerical errors and numerical approximations per implementation of the computer model. Most models are too complicated to solve exactly. For example, the finite element method or finite difference method may be used to approximate the solution of a partial differential equation (which introduces numerical errors). Other examples are numerical integration and infinite sum truncation that are necessary approximations in numerical implementation. ; Experimental uncertainty: Also known as observation error, this comes from the variability of experimental measurements. The experimental uncertainty is inevitable and can be noticed by repeating a measurement for many times using exactly the same settings for all inputs/variables. ; Interpolation uncertainty: This comes from a lack of available data collected from computer model simulations and/or experimental measurements. For other input settings that don't have simulation data or experimental measurements, one must interpolate or extrapolate in order to predict the corresponding responses. =Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty= Uncertainty is sometimes classified into two categories, prominently seen in medical applications.Abhaya Indrayan, Medical Biostatistics, Second Edition, Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, 2008, pages 8, 673 ; Aleatoric uncertainty: Aleatoric uncertainty is also known as statistical uncertainty, and is representative of unknowns that differ each time we run the same experiment. For example, a single arrow shot with a mechanical bow that exactly duplicates each launch (the same acceleration, altitude, direction and final velocity) will not all impact the same point on the target due to random and complicated vibrations of the arrow shaft, the knowledge of which cannot be determined sufficiently to eliminate the resulting scatter of impact points. The argument here is obviously in the definition of \\"cannot\\". Just because we cannot measure sufficiently with our currently available measurement devices does not preclude necessarily the existence of such information, which would move this uncertainty into the below category. Aleatoric is derived from the Latin alea or dice, referring to a game of chance. ; Epistemic uncertainty: Epistemic uncertainty is also known as systematic uncertainty, and is due to things one could in principle know but do not in practice. This may be because a measurement is not accurate, because the model neglects certain effects, or because particular data has been deliberately hidden. An example of a source of this uncertainty would be the drag in an experiment designed to measure the acceleration of gravity near the earth's surface. The commonly used gravitational acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2 ignores the effects of air resistance, but the air resistance for the object could be measured and incorporated into the experiment to reduce the resulting uncertainty in the calculation of the gravitational acceleration. In real life applications, both kinds of uncertainties are present. Uncertainty quantification intends to explicitly express both types of uncertainty separately. The quantification for the aleatoric uncertainties can be relatively straightforward, where traditional (frequentist) probability is the most basic form. Techniques such as the Monte Carlo method are frequently used. A probability distribution can be represented by its moments (in the Gaussian case, the mean and covariance suffice, although, in general, even knowledge of all moments to arbitrarily high order still does not specify the distribution function uniquely), or more recently, by techniques such as Karhunen‚ÄìLo√®ve and polynomial chaos expansions. To evaluate epistemic uncertainties, the efforts are made to understand the (lack of) knowledge of the system, process or mechanism. Representation of epistemic uncertainty can be based on methods such as probability bounds analysis, fuzzy logic or evidence/belief theories such as subjective logic or Dempster‚ÄìShafer theory (where epistemic uncertainty is represented as vacuity of belief). Two types of uncertainty quantification problems There are two major types of problems in uncertainty quantification: one is the forward propagation of uncertainty (where the various sources of uncertainty are propagated through the model to predict the overall uncertainty in the system response) and the other is the inverse assessment of model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty (where the model parameters are calibrated simultaneously using test data). There has been a proliferation of research on the former problem and a majority of uncertainty analysis techniques were developed for it. On the other hand, the latter problem is drawing increasing attention in the engineering design community, since uncertainty quantification of a model and the subsequent predictions of the true system response(s) are of great interest in designing robust systems. =Forward uncertainty propagation= Uncertainty propagation is the quantification of uncertainties in system output(s) propagated from uncertain inputs. It focuses on the influence on the outputs from the parametric variability listed in the sources of uncertainty. The targets of uncertainty propagation analysis can be: * To evaluate low-order moments of the outputs, i.e. mean and variance. * To evaluate the reliability of the outputs. This is especially useful in reliability engineering where outputs of a system are usually closely related to the performance of the system. * To assess the complete probability distribution of the outputs. This is useful in the scenario of utility optimization where the complete distribution is used to calculate the utility. =Inverse uncertainty quantification= Given some experimental measurements of a system and some computer simulation results from its mathematical model, inverse uncertainty quantification estimates the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model (which is called bias correction), and estimates the values of unknown parameters in the model if there are any (which is called parameter calibration or simply calibration). Generally this is a much more difficult problem than forward uncertainty propagation; however it is of great importance since it is typically implemented in a model updating process. There are several scenarios in inverse uncertainty quantification: The outcome of bias correction, including an updated model (prediction mean) and prediction confidence interval. Bias correction only Bias correction quantifies the model inadequacy, i.e. the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model. The general model updating formula for bias correction is: : y^e(\\\\mathbf{x})=y^m(\\\\mathbf{x})+\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{x})+\\\\varepsilon where y^e(\\\\mathbf{x}) denotes the experimental measurements as a function of several input variables \\\\mathbf{x} , y^m(\\\\mathbf{x}) denotes the computer model (mathematical model) response, \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{x}) denotes the additive discrepancy function (aka bias function), and \\\\varepsilon denotes the experimental uncertainty. The objective is to estimate the discrepancy function \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{x}) , and as a by-product, the resulting updated model is y^m(\\\\mathbf{x})+\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{x}) . A prediction confidence interval is provided with the updated model as the quantification of the uncertainty. Parameter calibration only Parameter calibration estimates the values of one or more unknown parameters in a mathematical model. The general model updating formulation for calibration is: : y^e(\\\\mathbf{x})=y^m(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}^*)+\\\\varepsilon where y^m(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}) denotes the computer model response that depends on several unknown model parameters \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} , and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}^* denotes the true values of the unknown parameters in the course of experiments. The objective is to either estimate \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}^* , or to come up with a probability distribution of \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}^* that encompasses the best knowledge of the true parameter values. Bias correction and parameter calibration It considers an inaccurate model with one or more unknown parameters, and its model updating formulation combines the two together: : y^e(\\\\mathbf{x})=y^m(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}^*)+\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{x})+\\\\varepsilon It is the most comprehensive model updating formulation that includes all possible sources of uncertainty, and it requires the most effort to solve. Selective methodologies for uncertainty quantification Much research has been done to solve uncertainty quantification problems, though a majority of them deal with uncertainty propagation. During the past one to two decades, a number of approaches for inverse uncertainty quantification problems have also been developed and have proved to be useful for most small- to medium-scale problems. =Methodologies for forward uncertainty propagation= Existing uncertainty propagation approaches include probabilistic approaches and non- probabilistic approaches. There are basically five categories of probabilistic approaches for uncertainty propagation:S. H. Lee and W. Chen, \\"A comparative study of uncertainty propagation methods for black-box-type problems\\", Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization Volume 37, Number 3 (2009), 239‚Äì253, * Simulation-based methods: Monte Carlo simulations, importance sampling, adaptive sampling, etc. * Local expansion-based methods: Taylor series, perturbation method, etc. These methods have advantages when dealing with relatively small input variability and outputs that don't express high nonlinearity. These linear or linearized methods are detailed in the article Uncertainty propagation. * Functional expansion-based methods: Neumann expansion, orthogonal or Karhunen‚ÄìLoeve expansions (KLE), with polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and wavelet expansions as special cases. * Most probable point (MPP)-based methods: first-order reliability method (FORM) and second- order reliability method (SORM). * Numerical integration-based methods: Full factorial numerical integration (FFNI) and dimension reduction (DR). For non- probabilistic approaches, interval analysis, Fuzzy theory, possibility theory and evidence theory are among the most widely used. The probabilistic approach is considered as the most rigorous approach to uncertainty analysis in engineering design due to its consistency with the theory of decision analysis. Its cornerstone is the calculation of probability density functions for sampling statistics.Arnaut, L. R. Measurement uncertainty in reverberation chambers - I. Sample statistics. Technical report TQE 2, 2nd. ed., sec. 3.1, National Physical Laboratory, 2008. This can be performed rigorously for random variables that are obtainable as transformations of Gaussian variables, leading to exact confidence intervals. =Methodologies for inverse uncertainty quantification= Frequentist In regression analysis and least squares problems, the standard error of parameter estimates is readily available, which can be expanded into a confidence interval. Bayesian Several methodologies for inverse uncertainty quantification exist under the Bayesian framework. The most complicated direction is to aim at solving problems with both bias correction and parameter calibration. The challenges of such problems include not only the influences from model inadequacy and parameter uncertainty, but also the lack of data from both computer simulations and experiments. A common situation is that the input settings are not the same over experiments and simulations. =Modular Bayesian approach= An approach to inverse uncertainty quantification is the modular Bayesian approach.Marc C. Kennedy, Anthony O'Hagan, Supplementary Details on Bayesian Calibration of Computer Models, Sheffield, University of Sheffield: 1‚Äì13, 2000 The modular Bayesian approach derives its name from its four-module procedure. Apart from the current available data, a prior distribution of unknown parameters should be assigned. ;Module 1: Gaussian process modeling for the computer model To address the issue from lack of simulation results, the computer model is replaced with a Gaussian process (GP) model : y^m(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta})\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{GP}\\\\big(\\\\mathbf{h}^m(\\\\cdot)^T\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^m,\\\\sigma_m^2R^m(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot)\\\\big) where : R^m\\\\big((\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}),(\\\\mathbf{x}',\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}')\\\\big)=\\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{-\\\\sum_{k=1}^d \\\\omega_k^m(x_k-x_k')^2\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{-\\\\sum_{k=1}^r \\\\omega_{d+k}^m(\\\\theta_k-\\\\theta_k')^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. d is the dimension of input variables, and r is the dimension of unknown parameters. While \\\\mathbf{h}^m(\\\\cdot) is pre-defined, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^m, \\\\sigma_m, \\\\omega_k^m, k=1,\\\\ldots,d+r\\\\right\\\\\\\\} , known as hyperparameters of the GP model, need to be estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This module can be considered as a generalized kriging method. ;Module 2: Gaussian process modeling for the discrepancy function Similarly with the first module, the discrepancy function is replaced with a GP model : \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\sim\\\\mathcal{GP}\\\\big(\\\\mathbf{h}^\\\\delta(\\\\cdot)^T\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^\\\\delta,\\\\sigma_\\\\delta^2R^\\\\delta(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot)\\\\big) where : R^\\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{x}')=\\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{-\\\\sum_{k=1}^d \\\\omega_k^\\\\delta(x_k-x_k')^2 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Together with the prior distribution of unknown parameters, and data from both computer models and experiments, one can derive the maximum likelihood estimates for \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^\\\\delta, \\\\sigma_\\\\delta, \\\\omega_k^\\\\delta, k=1,\\\\ldots,d\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . At the same time, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\beta}^m from Module 1 gets updated as well. ;Module 3: Posterior distribution of unknown parameters Bayes' theorem is applied to calculate the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters: : p(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}\\\\mid\\\\text{data},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi})\\\\propto p(\\\\rm{data}\\\\mid\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi})p(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}) where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi} includes all the fixed hyperparameters in previous modules. ;Module 4: Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function =Fully Bayesian approach= Fully Bayesian approach requires that not only the priors for unknown parameters \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} but also the priors for the other hyperparameters \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi} should be assigned. It follows the following steps:F. Liu, M. J. Bayarri and J.O.Berger, \\"Modularization in Bayesian Analysis, with Emphasis on Analysis of Computer Models\\", Bayesian Analysis (2009) 4, Number 1, pp. 119‚Äì150, # Derive the posterior distribution p(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}\\\\mid\\\\text{data}) ; # Integrate \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi} out and obtain p(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}\\\\mid\\\\text{data}) . This single step accomplishes the calibration; # Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function. However, the approach has significant drawbacks: * For most cases, p(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta},\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi}\\\\mid\\\\text{data}) is a highly intractable function of \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi} . Hence the integration becomes very troublesome. Moreover, if priors for the other hyperparameters \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varphi} are not carefully chosen, the complexity in numerical integration increases even more. * In the prediction stage, the prediction (which should at least include the expected value of system responses) also requires numerical integration. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is often used for integration; however it is computationally expensive. The fully Bayesian approach requires a huge amount of calculations and may not yet be practical for dealing with the most complicated modelling situations. Known issues The theories and methodologies for uncertainty propagation are much better established, compared with inverse uncertainty quantification. For the latter, several difficulties remain unsolved: # Dimensionality issue: The computational cost increases dramatically with the dimensionality of the problem, i.e. the number of input variables and/or the number of unknown parameters. # Identifiability issue: Paul D. Arendt, Daniel W. Apley, Wei Chen, David Lamb and David Gorsich , \\"Improving Identifiability in Model Calibration Using Multiple Responses\\", Journal of Mechanical Design, 134(10), 100909 (2012); Multiple combinations of unknown parameters and discrepancy function can yield the same experimental prediction. Hence different values of parameters cannot be distinguished/identified. Random Events to Quantifiable Uncertainty While rolling one six-sided dice, the probability of getting one to six is equal. An interval of 90% coverage probability extends the entire output range. While rolling 5 dices and observing the sum of outcomes, the width of an interval of 88.244% confidence is 46.15% of the range. The interval becomes narrower compared to the range with a larger number of dice- rolling. Our real-life events are influenced by numerous probabilistic events and the effect of all probabilistic events can be predicted by a narrow interval of high coverage probability; most of the situations HM Dipu Kabir, Abbas Khosravi, Saeid Nahavandi, Abdollah Kavousi-Fard, \\"Partial Adversarial Training for Neural Network-Based Uncertainty Quantification\\", 'IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence', .

The village lies just outside the New Forest, across the main A36 road which runs from the M27 motorway to Salisbury. The nearest town is Romsey, to the east, and the closest city is Southampton, to the southeast. The parish had a population of just over 3,300 in the 2011 census. Some people refer to the two villages of East Wellow and West Wellow individually, while others refer to them collectively as Wellow. There is no official administrative or political division which separates the two parts, and they share the same parish council, which also covers the small settlement of Canada. Canada is just inside the New Forest boundary and can only be reached by public road from the roundabout on the A36 at West Wellow.  History  King Alfred (d. 899) left \\"the toune of Welewe\\" in his will to his eldest daughter Ethelgifu. Thirteen households at \\"Welue\\" are mentioned in Domesday Book (1086). Only the name \\"Wellow\\" appears on Saxton's 1575 map of Hampshire; it is spelt \\"Wellew\\" in various maps from the seventeenth century. East and West Wellow appear separately by the time of John Harrison's 1788 map, separated by the River Blackwater. Their exact positions on these early maps are hard to reconcile with the modern road and settlement pattern, but until 1895 when the county boundary was realigned, West Wellow was in Wiltshire and East Wellow in Hampshire.  Amenities  Embley, in Embley Park, was the family home of Florence Nightingalealt= Most of the current housing dates from the twentieth century, with a few earlier buildings (notably some thatched cottages). There is continuing small-scale infill development. All the principal services are found in the larger West Wellow and include some small shops, a petrol station, village hall, recreation ground and Wellow School. The school was originally funded by money from Florence Nightingale's family and bears a plaque recording that information. There is a public house, the Red Rover, on the A36 and another, the Rockingham, in Canada. The smaller mainly residential East Wellow is approximately one mile to the south-east of West Wellow. Throughout the 1990s, there was discussion of various options for the construction of a Wellow bypass route to relieve the village of the increasing volume of traffic on the A36; but none of these were constructed. The northern boundary of the modern village is effectively the River Blackwater, and the surrounding area is agricultural. The former Wellow Mill on the Blackwater was served by a complicated series of sluices to deal with changes in water level but was converted to a private residence in 1945, and no machinery remains. Along the river are a series of lakes which form the site of Woodington and Whinwhistle fisheries.  Church  The parish church of St. Margaret of Antioch is a flint-faced stone structure consecrated in 1215, and the interior contains some wall paintings from this period. In 1251 Henry III of England granted a charter to Wellow to hold an annual fair on the eve of St Margaret's Day. A chancel was added in the 13th century and a south aisle in the 15th. The church is notable as the burial site of Florence Nightingale, whose family home was the nearby Embley Park, now a private school. St Margaret's is a destination for many visitors interested in Nightingale and the history of nursing. The church is some distance from the majority of the modern housing, and there is no archaeological evidence that there was ever a substantial settlement close to the church.

Before the Dissolution, the parish of Wherwell was in the hands of an important abbey of Benedictine nuns, whose abbess was Lady of the Manor of an area much larger than the existing parish. The town is associated with the Cockatrice. The story is that the cockatrice terrorised the village until it was imprisoned in the dungeons below Wherwell Priory. A prize of land was offered to anyone who could kill the creature. None were successful, until a man named Green lowered a mirror into the dungeon. The cockatrice battled against its own reflection until exhausted, at which point Green was able to kill it. Today there is an area of land near Wherwell called Green's Acres.

Antwerp, 1631 - d. Vienna, 25 June 1679) was a Flemish Baroque painter, draughtsman and etcher. Life He was born in Antwerp.Nikolaas van Hoy at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He likely trained in Antwerp. He worked in Brussels between 1647 - 1655. He is also reported to have spent some time in Rome. He went to Vienna in 1657, possibly with the Dutch painter Jan van Ossenbeeck whom he would have met in Rome and had later joined him in Brussels.Nicolaus van Hoy (Biographical details) at the British Museum siteJan van Ossenbeeck on the Hadrianus website At about 1667 he became the court painter of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor and the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria. He retained this post until his death in Vienna in 1679. He was succeeded at the court by his son Nickolaus van Hoey the Younger (Antwerp 1660- Vienna ca. 1710). Work Equestrian Ballet He made landscapes and portraits. He engraved religious scenes and mythological figures adapted from originals of Veronese, Barocci and Raphael. He was one of the artists and engravers who collaborated with David Teniers the Younger on the publication entitled \\"Theatrum Pictorium\\", a catalogue of the picture gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm. Abraham Teniers published the first edition in 1658 as loose leaves and unnumbered.Theatrum Pictorium at the British Museum The first part with 244 etchings of Italian pictures was published in Brussels in 1660, while the gallery was already in Vienna. The publication ends with an engraving by Frans van der Steen after a drawing by Nicolaus van Hoy of a view of the Stallburg gallery of the Archduke.

The prints of cavalcades by Nicolaus van Hoy were published in Francesco Sbarra's 'La Contessa dell' Aria e dell' Aqua festa a cavallo rappresentata nell' augustissime nozze dell M.M. dell'Imperatore Leopold e dell' Infante Margherita della Spagne' in 1667.Equestrian Ballet at the British Museum site He collaborated with other painters in the production of garland paintings. Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in Antwerp by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, Hendrick van Balen, Andries Daniels, Frans Francken the Younger, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. They typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter.Ursula H√§rting, Review of Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image Van Hoy made garland paintings with other painters, such as the Flemish √©migr√© painter Jan Anton van der Baren, who painted the flowers while Van Hoy painted the devotional image.

The terms Macaoimh and Cub are often co-existent though Macaoimh represents a different tradition. Both boys and girls participate in the Cub Scout programme though some Scout Groups accept boys only. Its membership is the largest of the four Scouting Ireland Sections. The Cub Scout programme is part of the worldwide Scouting movement and aims to develop the youth member using the SPICE program - Social, Physical, Intellectual, Character, Emotional and Spiritual. Methodology The Cub Scout programme is designed to provide adventure, fun and exploration, and to teach responsibility. Cub Scouts are organised into Packs, and then into groups, usually of 6 members, called Sixes. Each Six has one of the Cub Scouts as their leader, a \\"Sixer,\\" and an assistant leader, a \\"Seconder.\\" The Sixers meet in a Sixer Council, and talk about things that the Cub Scouts would like to do. Cub Scouts are given more responsibility and more say in the running of the programme and as a result can do more than Beavers. They spend more time working in small groups and making decisions as a team, with every Cub Scout having a job to do in the Six, and gaining additional responsibility as they develop. Getting out into nature is a focus of Cub Scouting. Cub Scouts gather from time to time on camping events - Jam√≥ige events, big camps for Cub Scouts, with perhaps 2000 Cub Scouts camping together, National Cub Scouting days, as well as Pack Holidays. Personal Progression The personal progressive scheme takes the form of badges which use a certain number of stages to determine how far along in the programme the Cub Scout is. The three stages are Turas (bronze needle), Taisteal (silver needle) and Tagann (gold needle). The Aim of Scouting is to develop young people Socially, Physically, Intellectually, Character, Emotionally, Spiritually. These elements are called the SPICES and are deeply integrated into the programme experience via the Scout Method, Personal Progress Awards and Programme designed by young people. The Programme, that the young people have designed with the help and assistance of Scouters follows a simple process; PLAN, DO, REVIEW. Programmes are planned, activities executed, and the whole process is reviewed. The review process is important as it allows young people to learn by doing, reflect on their new knowledge, and carry it through to the next Programme step. This allows them to see their own progress, and move towards future discoveries and experiences. Along with the Progress badges that a young person gets from following their personal journey in Scouting they also have the opportunity of doing complementary badges; Adventure Skills, Special Interest Badges and Nautical badges. Adventure Skills Badges require a young person to achieve a detailed set standard in a particular Adventure Skill. The requirements are progressive, and ultimately pave the way to outside recognition by a governing body of a chosen skill. There are currently nine Adventure Skills Badges. Special interest badges are open-ended badges that reflect the interests of the young person undertaking them. Any subject is possible. The requirements are designed by the young person in consultation and agreement with their Scouters. Badge requirements are designed to allow exploration of the subject, develop and improve skills, and put the new knowledge into practice, preferably as a practical project which will benefit others. Leadership The role of the Scouter is one of assisting, supporting, facilitating and motivating. The Scouter is a role model, rather than a boss. Younger age ranges will require more facilitation and direction but this should be reversed in older age ranges to one of ‚Äòmentor or coach‚Äô. The Scouter needs to be aware of the young people in their Section, and understand ‚Äòwhere they are‚Äô in relation to their development as young people. Scouters will assist in reviewing activities and help young people to reflect on their experiences and personal journey through Scouting.

Career Wallace was raised in Wales after his father Dougie, also a footballer, transferred to Llanelli Town in 1949. Gordon attended school with future rugby union star Barry John and had trials with Huddersfield Town while Bill Shankly was the Yorkshire club's manager. Shankly moved to Liverpool in late 1959, and soon brought in the teenage Wallace as an apprentice. During his spell at Anfield, his main claims to fame were netting the opening goal in the 1964 FA Charity Shield, scoring twice in a match covered on the very first BBC \\"Match of the Day\\" programme, and being Liverpool's first ever European Champions' Cup goalscorer (the first goal in an away tie against KR Reykjav√≠k), all occurring in August 1964. Despite such a promising start his first team opportunities were limited by the consistency, fitness and excellent disciplinary records of Liverpool's twin strike force, Roger Hunt and Ian St John, respectively England and Scotland internationals. Wallace played for Liverpool Reserves between 1965 and 1967. When Tony Hateley joined Liverpool in 1967, Wallace left on a free transfer, joining Crewe Alexandra. He shone at Crewe and was an important element of the team that won promotion to Division 3 in the 1967‚Äì68 season. His form the following season began to attract interest from higher league sides until a home game versus Watford on 28 September 1968, when a tackle from behind broke his leg. It took him 13 months to return to first team football, but he never managed to regain the form of old. He played his final game for Crewe away at Colchester on 17 September 1972.

She is remembered for her legal dispute with the makers of Nosferatu, an unauthorised film based on her husband's novel Dracula. Life The daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel James Balcombe of 1 Marino Crescent, Clontarf, and of Phillippa Anne Marshall, she was a celebrated beauty whose former suitor was Oscar Wilde. She married Stoker in Dublin in 1878. He had known Wilde from their student days, and had proposed Wilde for membership of the university's Philosophical Society while he was president. Wilde was upset at Florence's decision, but Stoker later resumed the acquaintanceship and after Wilde's fall visited him on the Continent. The Stokers moved to London, where he became acting-manager and then business manager of Henry Irving's Lyceum Theatre, London, a post he held for 27 years. Their only child was born on 31 December 1879 and christened Irving Noel Thornley Stoker. In Golders Green Crematorium Florence Balcombe outlived her husband by 25 years and died in 1937 at the age of 78. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, and her ashes scattered at the Gardens of Rest there. The original plan had been to keep her ashes and those of her husband together in a display urn. After Irving Noel Stoker's death in 1961, his ashes were added to those of his father's in that urn. Nosferatu Balcombe is remembered for her legal dispute with the makers of the 1922 German horror film Nosferatu, which was based without attribution or permission on Stoker's novel Dracula. She was unaware of the existence of Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau's Nosferatu until she received an anonymous letter from Berlin. The document included the program of a lavish cinematic event held in 1922, complete with full orchestral accompaniment, that had taken place in the Marble Garden at Berlin Zoological Garden. The film was described in the handbill as \\"freely adapted from Bram Stoker's Dracula.\\" (Nosferatu screenwriter Henrik Galeen had changed the names of the main characters and made some liberal changes to certain key points. However, the resemblance to Stoker's novel is unmistakable.) Balcombe was struggling financially and, as Stoker's literary executor, had never given permission for the adaptation, nor received payment for it. Her furious response to this copyright infringement was prompt and uncompromising; not only did she want the financial reparation she felt was due to the estate, she demanded that the negative and all prints of the film (which she would never actually see) be immediately destroyed. Balcombe launched a lawsuit in which she was represented by the lawyers of the British Incorporated Society of Authors. The suit took some time to resolve; at one point, the German production company Prana-Film declared bankruptcy to avoid paying for the adaptation. Finally, she won the case, with the final ruling in July 1925 stating that the negatives and all prints of the film should be handed over to her to be destroyed. Despite this ruling, prints of the film slowly began to resurface in the late 1920s, with the first American screenings taking place in New York City and Detroit in 1929. Balcombe did grant the rights to the stage adaptation of Dracula to Hamilton Deane, who had been a neighbour of hers in Dublin. Deane's play, Dracula, premiered in Derby in 1924. In 1927 Horace Liveright bought the American dramatic rights from Florence and hired John L. Balderston to edit it for the New York stage. The show ran for a year on Broadway and for two more years on tour, breaking all previous records for any show put on tour in the United States. However, Liveright failed to pay Florence all her entitlements for the show ‚Äì he died shortly afterwards.

It was the winner of the 1963 Harper Prize for fiction. The book was initially serialized in the Saturday Evening Post, and in January 1963 it was published by Harper & Row. In 1966 it was adapted into the movie of the same name starring Steve McQueen. Background Richard McKenna served aboard a Yangtze River gunboat in 1936 but set the novel a decade earlier, during the Nationalist Northern Expedition of 1925‚Äì1927, aboard the fictional USS San Pablo, a gunboat left over from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The phrase \\"sand pebble\\" is a pun on the boat's name; thus, the sailors who serve on her are the sand pebbles. Plot The novel describes a life of boredom and sudden battle action, but the chief conflict is between the traditional western ideas, which saw China in racist and imperialist terms, and emerging nationalism. The protagonist, Motor Machinist Mate First Class Jake Holman, the San Pablo's chief engineer, teaches his Chinese workers‚Äîhe refuses to call them \\"coolies\\"‚Äîto master the ship's machinery by understanding it, not just \\"monkey see, monkey do\\". The ship is sent to save the China Light Mission from anti-foreign mobs, setting off a debate: \\"No man who favors the unequal treaties has the right to call himself a Christian!\\" Others reply \\"It is time for the Society for Propagation of the Gospel to step aside.

He is sometimes referred to as \\"the father of corporate public relations\\" for his work at AT&T.; The company was experiencing resistance from the public to its monopolization efforts. Page is said to have established a series of public relations heuristics generally referred to as the Page Principles.Page Principles from Arthur W. Page Society In fact, they were composed by Jack Koten, Larry Foster and Ed Block, founding members of the eponymous Arthur W. Page Society, which acknowledges that the Page Principles are derived from Mr. Page's works. No words or phrases from Mr. Page's writings appear in the principles and none of the Page Principles authors worked with or for Arthur Page. It is unclear if any knew or met Mr. Page or that a bibliography or notes survive. Arthur was born 10 September 1883 to Walter Hines Page and his wife Willa A. Page of Aberdeen, North Carolina. For his secondary education, Arthur studied at Lawrenceville School. He then attended Harvard College, graduating in 1905. He went to work at Doubleday, Page & Co., his father‚Äôs company, editing magazines, in particular The World's Work. \\"He wrote many powerful editorials describing and explaining the special obligations of corporations in a democratic society.\\"Edward M. Block Arthur W. Page, The Legacy of Public Relations, Excellence Behind the Name from Pennsylvania State University In 1927 Walter S. Gifford hired Page to become vice-president for public relations at AT&T.; One of his first assignments was to prepare a speech for President Gifford to present in October that year to the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners meeting in Dallas, Texas. In the early 1900s, AT&T; had assessed that 90 percent of its press coverage was negative, which was reduced to 60 percent by changing its business practices and disseminating information to the press. According to business historian John Brooks, Page positioned the company as a public utility and increased the public's appreciation for its contributions to society. On the other hand, Stuart Ewen wrote that AT&T; used its advertising dollars with newspapers to manipulate its coverage and had their public relations team write feature stories that were published as if they were written by independent journalists. In 1941, when the book The Bell Telephone System by A.W. Page was published, the Dallas speech was quoted in chapter 2: \\"Responsibility for such a large part of the entire telephone service of the country...imposes on the management an unusual obligation to the public...\\"AW Page (1941) The Bell Telephone System, p 12, Harper & Brothers Arthur lived until September, 1960. He is today recognized in the name of two organizations, the Arthur W. Page Society, an organization for senior public relations executives, and the Arthur W.

UFO contactee George Van Tassel was likely the first to claim to receive an Ashtar message, in 1952. Since then many different claims about Ashtar have appeared in different contexts. The Ashtar movement is studied by academics as a prominent form of UFO religion. Van Tassel Denzler observes that \\"in the long run, probably the most important person for the propagation and perpetuation of the contactee movement was George Van Tassel\\".Denzler, Brenda (2001) p43 In 1947 Van Tassel moved to Giant Rock, near Landers in the Mojave Desert, California, where he established a large UFO Center. This became the most successful and well-known UFO meeting center of the time.Helland, Christopher (2003) p162Denzler, Brenda (2001) pp43-4Ellwood, Robert S. (1995) p395 As one of the founding \\"fathers\\" of the modern religious ufologies,Grunschloss, Andreas (2004) p422 Van Tassel also created arguably the most prominent UFO group established in the US in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although not as influential or well-known today. This was the \\"Ministry of Universal Wisdom\\" begun in 1953, which evolved out of two previous groups he had organized at Giant Rock in the late 1940s. The organization investigated and encouraged the healing arts, but its prime focus was to collect and analyse UFO phenomena and interview 'contactees'. Due to radio and television interest, Van Tassel became the most well-known promoter of contactee experiences and somewhat of a celebrity in the 1950s.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp162-3 In 1952 Van Tassel himself claimed to receive messages via telepathic communication from an extraterrestrial and interdimensional being named \\"Ashtar\\".Helland, Christopher (2003) p163Flaherty, Robert Pearson (2011) p592Clark, Jerome (2007) p26 This source became the \\"first metaphysical superstar of the flying saucer age\\". Van Tassel also interpreted the Christian Bible in terms of extraterrestrial intervention in the evolution of the human race, and claimed that Jesus was a being from space. The Ministry of Universal Wisdom taught that all humans have the power to tap into the \\"Universal Mind of God\\", which facilitates evolutionary progress such as that exemplified by Jesus and Ashtar. Van Tassel also claimed that by accessing the Universal Mind he could receive messages not only from Ashtar but from humans who had died, such as Nikola Tesla. From Tesla he claimed to receive instructions to build the \\"Integratron\\" machine, which could extend lifespan and access knowledge from the past and future.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp 167-8Reece, Gregory L (2007) p132 Although his purported method of communication with extraterrestrial intelligences resembled what is commonly referred to as \\"channeling\\", Van Tassel claimed to have established a new form of telepathic communication with these 'sources', utilizing a method which included both natural human abilities and the use of an allegedly advanced form of alien technology, rather than the more traditionally religious, non-technological, spiritual medium based approach taken by many other early channelers of the era. Van Tassel maintained that the method he utilized was not a paranormal or metaphysical activity, but required being 'in resonance' with the messages being sent. It was an example of the application of an allegedly advanced extraterrestrial science, that anyone could implement with the proper training in meditation techniques. Giant Rock Space Conventions Van Tassel held weekly channeling sessions at Giant Rock at which people could \\"ask questions\\" and \\"channel answers\\" from extraterrestrials. According to Jerome Clark, these gatherings coalesced the scattered contactee subculture into a recognisable movement in January 1952. This led to the annual Giant Rock Spacecraft Convention organized by Van Tassel, which began in the spring of 1953 and continued for at least another 24 years. It marked Van Tassel's most important role in UFO history In 1959 up to 11,000 people attended these conventions and heard channeled messages claiming to come from space.Helland, Christopher (2000) p38 Most of the well- known UFO contactees attended these conventions as speakers and channelers.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp 163-4 Melton states that almost all of the 1950s contactees became involved in the two ecumenical structures founded by either Van Tassel or Gabriel Green.Melton, J. Gordon (2002) p798 Most of the early messages Van Tassel claimed to have received from Ashtar were first presented to the public at these events. Van Tassel's early purported messages from Ashtar contained a great deal of apocalyptic material, which focused on concerns regarding the development of the soon to be tested hydrogen bomb.Grunschloss, Andreas (2004) p422-3.Helland, Christopher (2003) p164 It was claimed that on July 18, 1952, Ashtar entered the solar system as Commander in Chief of the Ashtar Galactic Command to warn humanity of the dangers of detonating the H-bomb, including the destruction of the planet.Helland, Christopher (Lewis, 2003) p498 The messages stated the space command was determined that humans would not destroy the Earth through the wrong use of nuclear power and that the Command was helping the human race.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp164-5 Van Tassel also claimed that Ashtar had provided specific messages that he was expected to pass on to the U.S. federal government regarding the potential negative impacts of the proposed upcoming bomb tests.Reece, Gregory L. (2007) p136Grunschloss, Andreas (2004) p423 After the actual explosion of the H-bomb by the US and Russian governments, the channeling claimed that the space forces had assisted the planet to survive the bomb tests.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp165-6Reece, Gregory L. (2007) pp136-7 Ashtar Command As the weekly channeling sessions at Giant Rock continued through the early 1950s, the concept of an \\"Ashtar Command\\" was appropriated for use by a number of prominent early contactees and channelers, based on the figure of Ashtar, originally promoted by Van Tassel.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp168-9 Robert Short (AKA Bill Rose), editor of the 1950s UFO magazine \\"Interplanetary News Digest\\", was a member of Van Tassel's group. He began to popularise the messages, but as Van Tassel did not agree that other Ashtar messages were authentic, Short broke away and began his own group called \\"Ashtar Command\\".Helland, Christopher (2003) p169 By the mid-1950s, the concept of Ashtar and a galactic law enforcement agency preparing an imminent rescue of humanity had become well-established, and included various well-known, esoteric channelers of the era. For instance, Elouise Moeller predicted that a space fleet would arrive in the near future; and Adelaide J Brown claimed that flourishing civilisations existed on the other planets in the solar system.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp169-170 However, as time and scientific knowledge progressed, the public failure of these predictions had an enormous negative impact on the expansion of the Ashtar Command movement due to the lack of a central authority that could undertake damage control. Although Robert Short had spent a lot of time promoting the Ashtar message, he was neither the leader nor the only interpreter, as by this time dozens of Ashtar channelers were presenting conflicting messages.Helland, Christopher (2003) p170 Derivation of the Ashtar movement With the advent of UFO religions, \\"Ascended Masters\\" from the esoteric teachings have been described as reappearing in space suits. The space concept was not entirely new however, as the more arcane teachings of Theosophy contained references to extraterrestrial masters.Partridge, Christopher (2003) pp10,12,19Lewis, James R. (2003) pp96,126-7Denzler, Brenda (2001) p46 The concept of the Ascended Master is particularly clear in the Ashtar teachings.Partridge, Christopher (2003) p19 The very word \\"ashtar\\" appears in Helena Blavatsky's The Secret Doctrine (1888).Grunschloss, Andreas (Partridge 2004) p373 However, this reference is to the Sanskrit term ashtar- vidya, meaning the technology of advanced warfare of the type mentioned in the Mahabharata.Helena Blavatsky, The Secret Doctrine Vol. 2, p. 427. According to Helland, the initial account of the Ashtar message as channeled through Van Tassel was not a spiritual message as such but \\"an early contact account between extraterrestrials and humankind.\\" It focused on intervention in human scientific development, and came from a real technological space being on an urgent interstellar undertaking. However, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, as many individuals in the spiritualist movement began to claim contact with Ashtar, the space being began to play more of an Ascended Master role in the narratives. Ashtar movement The Ashtar Command evolved into a movement that had no central authority for several decades up until the mid 1990s, and has been described by Flaherty as \\"the common property of a diffuse New Age Spiritualist milieu.\\" During this time the teachings claiming to be channeled from Ashtar varied immensely.Helland, Christopher (Lewis, 2003) p497 Part of this movement metamorphosed into Guardian Action International and then Guardian Activation International.Tumminia, Diana (2007) p309 Guardian Action Publications was founded to disseminate the channeling, and published several books through the 1980s. In 1988, a newsletter \\"Ashtar‚Äôs Golden Circle\\" was also issued. Grunschloss, who refers to the Ashtar Command as a worldwide network of several loosely organised groups, describes much of the Ashtar channeling as akin to cargo cults, due to the blending of spiritual ascension with new alien technologies and ecologically harmless energies. Grunschloss maintains that most of the Ashtar millenarian concepts involve a transformation of human beings, via these technologies, who will then return to the planet Earth to enjoy a golden millennium.Grunschloss, Andreas (2004) p424-6 Later, with the failure of these prophecies, teachings were modified to include a less material and more spiritual emphasis.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp172-7 =Broadcasts= In 1971, a British radio talk show devoted to UFOs received a strange call-in claiming to originate from outer space, which some of the guests believed to be genuine. * Rex Dutta. Flying Saucer Message. Transatlantic Arts, 1972. * Return to the Past This turned out to be the prelude for the 1977 Southern Television broadcast interruption, when a voice calling itself \\"Vrillon\\" of the Ashtar Galactic Command temporarily took over a television transmitter in southern England.\\"Ashtar Command Radio Broadcast\\" Yvonne Cole Yvonne Cole, who claimed to be channeling Ashtar messages from 1986, predicted the destruction of all Earth civilizations and the arrival on the planet of various alien cultures in 1994.Helland, Christopher (2003) p173 Cole claimed that governments were working with extraterrestrials to prepare for contact.Yvonne Cole in Connecting Link Magazine, volume 23,1994, as referenced in \\"The Rapture: A Counterfeit Explanation\\" from Mussler, Chuck (1997), Koinonia House, Chapter 9 According to Cole, the landing would be broadcast through the global media and include a message from the Ashtar Command. Due to 'sensitization', most of humanity would accept the UFOs as part of humanity's continuing evolution, while Ashtar followers would be needed as advisors, ambassadors and peacekeepers between the alien races and humankind. This would lead to a radical transformation of the world as humanity was initiated into a higher level of existence. These prophecies furthered the continued fracturing and disappointment within the movement when they failed to occur. Despite these failures, during the 1980s a number of individuals began to claim contact with the Ashtar Command through channeling, and various small groups were formed to receive and disseminate the messages.Helland, Christopher (Lewis 2003) p499 Developments after the mid-1990s By the mid-1990s (and continuing up to the present) several of these channeling groups began to utilize the Internet in order to promulgate their beliefs and to attempt to unify the movement by establishing a single 'authoritative' source for all Ashtar messages. This led to more prominence in the religious scene and significant membership. This cohesive response addressed the problem of conflicting, negative and failed prophecies which, after some effort, enabled the Ashtar Command to produce a single Ashtar world view. Individual channelers espousing messages which differed and continued to focus on themes such as the destruction of Earth, conspiracies, ET mass evacuations and general fear-mongering were declared invalid. It was claimed that these channelers had been deceived by negative space beings who had rebelled from the Ashtar Command, made alliances with similar others, and begun operating on the 'lower planes closest to Earth‚Äô.Helland, Christopher (2003) Pp173-4Partridge, Christopher (2005) pp265-6 Most significantly of all, the new, more unified movement declared that in future no new channels would be accepted unless they operated on the ‚Äòlevel of the soul‚Äô. As Helland points out, this was crucial to the formation of an orthodoxy. Channeled messages from Ashtar would be accepted as valid by the new orthodoxy if they complied with criteria consisting of a set of twelve guidelines which outlined what the movement stood for and how Ashtar would interact with society. This had never been attempted before in the 45 years of channeling Ashtar, who was also presented as a Divine figure similar to Jesus.Helland, Christopher, (2003) p174 The new framework claimed that the millions of spaceships believed to be constantly in the vicinity of Earth would never interfere on the planet's surface unless there was a serious problem such as a third world war or an ‚Äòastrophysical catastrophe‚Äô. Helland observes that the emergent group was ‚Äúnoticeably more spiritually focussed and less concerned with extraterrestrial spaceships and visitors.‚ÄùHelland, Christopher (2003) p175 He states that very little distinguished the new Ashtar Command from other theosophically- influenced groups, except that in 1994 a distinctive component, the Pioneer Voyage, was incorporated into the Ashtar world viewPartridge, Christopher (2003) p20 The Pioneer Voyage In 1994, a small group of Ashtar Command members claimed that an extraordinary event had taken place: \\"the lift-off experience‚Äù. They communicated via the Ashtar Network that they had been placed aboard the ‚Äòships of Light‚Äô that were circling the planet. ‚ÄúThe Galactic Fifth Fleet‚Äù had used ‚Äòphysical vibrational transfer‚Äô which involved the human consciousness (or, sometimes, the ‚Äòetheric body‚Äô) being raised from the physical dimension and transferred to the ‚ÄúLight ships‚Äù.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp175-6 A second event was predicted for December 1994 in which over 250 people participated and which was declared by the leadership to have ‚Äúopened a portal to the AC (Ashtar Command) ships for ever.‚Äù It was claimed that in order to participate, a person's vibrations were raised through an eight step contemplative procedure; and that the Pioneer Voyage would occur during the period of a devotee's meditative state and would later be revealed to the individual in some form of conscious recall. This eventually evoked ‚Äòmemory recall‚Äô from a core group of Ashtar Command members meeting in Australia who began providing accounts of their 'time aboard the ships'. Others followed suit. The time on the ships was claimed to be extensive even though the member's meditation period was short.Helland, Christopher, (2003) p176 Helland notes that, despite an increase in complexity, the general themes have remained in accordance with the Australian reports. The claim is that the events are occurring on a spiritual or etheric dimension and not a physical one.Helland, Christopher (2003) p177 The group claims that the purpose of the Lift-off is for the ascension of the human race as a whole, to which individual ascension is a precursor and an aid. It also claims that the collective ascension is being aided by large electronic grids deployed around the planet by the guardian ships.Helland, Christopher (2000) p40 Credibility Helland points out the failure of the July 1952 prediction channeled through Van Tassel that life on Earth will be destroyed ‚Äúwhen they explode the hydrogen atom‚Äù because in November 1952 the first H-bomb was detonated with no such effect.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp164-6 However, the same message also stated that Ashtar was intervening to stop the destruction of the planet.Helland, Christopher (Lewis 2003) p500 After the explosion, ensuing messages claimed that various actions were taken by the space fleet to repair damage.Reece, Gregory L. (2007) p. 137Helland, Christopher (2003) p. 166 After the introduction of Ashtar by Van Tassel, other mediums began to claim contact. The most widely publicised of these messages were met with failure when they predicted civilisations flourishing on the other planets and an imminent landing of space ships on Earth.Helland, Christopher (2003) pp168-173 At one point, according to Helland, dozens of people were claiming contact with Ashtar and presenting conflicting messages.Reece, Gregory L. (2007) p. 138 Helland notes that the Ashtar belief system is based on faith in an extraterrestrial celebrity, the concept of which has fared better than the individual messages. The main shifts in content seem due to failed prophecy, which has moved the emphasis from a physical space fleet averting doom, to the more theosophical concept of an Ascended Master aiding spiritual advancement.Helland, Christopher (2003) p. 175, p. 177Grunschloss, Andreas 2004 p427 He maintains that the Ashtar beliefs are best seen as a syncretism between the I AM movements and the UFO experience, a belief system which regards UFO experiences and sightings as the natural progression of the spiritual development of humanity.

W. Sully shows the riverfront terminal of the Pontchartrain Rail-Road on the left, at the head of Elysian Fields Avenue. Pontchartrain Rail-Road was the first railway in New Orleans, Louisiana. Chartered in 1830, the railroad began carrying people and goods between the Mississippi River front and Lake Pontchartrain on 23 April 1831. It closed more than 100 years later. The long gaugeConfederate Railroads - Pontchartrain line connected the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans along the riverfront with the town of Milneburg on the Lakefront. When built, the majority of the distance of the route between neighborhoods at either end of the route was a mixture of farmland, woods, and swamp. The route of the railway ran down the center of Elysian Fields Avenue. It was the third common carrier railroad to officially open for service to the public in the United States, following the Baltimore and Ohio and the South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company. Early history Pontchartrain Rail-Road in its early years, depicting a 4-2-0 locomotive and carriages, \\"Milneburg Train. Ponchartrain Railroad 5 mile line from Elysian Fields Street to the Shore of Lake Ponchartrain at Milneburg.\\" Meetings discussing building a railway between the river and lake began in 1828. The Pontchartrain Rail-Road was chartered on 20 January 1830. The right-of-way was approved by the New Orleans City Council on 15 March, and construction began immediately, with a pair of parallel railroad tracks. Some of the route included swampland that required up to 4 feet of fill to create a sufficient road bed. A 150 foot wide bed was constructed along the entire route, with the rail line laid with red cypress timbers and English rolled iron rails. Construction of the line was completed on April 14, 1831, and it officially opened on the 23rd, with horse drawn railway carriages. The first steam locomotive, \\"the Shields\\", arrived on 15 June 1832. This first locomotive proved unreliable; a second locomotive \\"the Pontchartrain\\" supplied from England by Rothwell, Hick & Co. proved better, allowing the line to advertise regular steam service of 7 round trips per day (9 on Sundays) starting on 27 September 1832. \\"The Shields\\" was cannibalized, the boiler used to run equipment at the railroad's machine shop. At first, the passenger fare was 75 cents round trip. For some years both steam power and horse-drawn traffic ran on the line, with steam only gradually becoming dominant with the acquisition of more reliable locomotives. One horse-drawn car was kept on the line as late as 1861, although the line at the time also had five working locomotives. For much of the 19th century, a significant portion of sea traffic to New Orleans came in not via the river but to Lake Pontchartrain. Thus the railway was important in transferring cargo between ocean-going ships docked at the lake and riverboats. Many passenger sea ships also arrived via the lake, and the railway took passengers the remainder of the way into the city. For decades the passenger fare was 15 cents for a one way trip, 25 cents for a round trip. The railroad had terminals at the two ends of the line; stops would also be made at a small station at Gentilly Road, about the midpoint of the line, by advance request. In 1871 the line was purchased by the New Orleans, Mobile and Texas Railroad. In 1880 the Louisville and Nashville Railroad leased the line, and the following year purchased it outright. The railway served passengers for the last time in 1932, with service from Milneburg to New Orleans replaced by buses.Hennick and Charleton (2000), p. 39. The line switches from shipping to recreation In the late 19th century, the Pontchartrain Railroad became less important for commerce, as ships too large to use the Lakefront routes became common and the extensive network of long distance railways grew. However, at the same time, the line became more important for recreation. Especially during the long summer, excursions from the city out to the lakefront became common, to enjoy the cooling breezes and the entertainments at Milneberg. In the early 20th century rates were 10 cents for adults, 5 cents for children one way, and double for round trip. Generations of New Orleanians fondly remembered the archaic veteran steam engine nicknamed \\"Smoky Mary\\" running on the line as late as the 1930s. The somewhat less outdated companion locomotive on the line was called \\"Puffing Billy\\". Final years Thanks to the popularity of recreational excursions at Milneburg, business remained brisk for the Pontchartrain Railroad through the mid-1920s. After this, however, the railroad declined for two reasons. One was less demand for short distance rail passenger service with expansion of electric streetcar routes and growth in automobile ownership. The final straw, however, was the closing of the Milneburg resorts while a land reclamation project dredged earth into the shallows of lake Pontchartrain there in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The last passenger service of the line was on March 15, 1932, the line having been in business for over a century. Freight runs on the line continued to 1935, mostly servicing the Lakefront land reclamation project work which made the line obsolete. The Elysian Fields neutral ground, formerly the right-of-way of the Pontchartrain Rail-Road. The old mile-stone at the bottom right is one of the few surviving physical reminders of the long defunct railway.

The railroad served as a passenger and freight carrier.  Overview  Some accounts say the railroad had only a single combination passenger coach and baggage car, two box cars and four flat cars. Since Roswell was a textile manufacturing town, the line would have brought in cotton and dry goods and shipped textile and farming products. The Roswell terminus was located south of the Chattahoochee River near Roberts Drive and connected to the Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line Railway at its Chamblee terminus. At the South Roswell terminus, a bridge was planned, but never built. About 1/2 mile upstream, an old wagon road ran just west of the current River Landing Drive and Grimes Bridge Landing to connect to current day Grimes Bridge and Oxbo Roads and approached the textile mills from the north. Unfortunately, much of the old roadbed was destroyed when Fulton County installed a sewer line. Ike Roberts was an employee of Southern Railway at the time the company decided to create the Roswell Railroad. Roberts participated in the grading and track laying for this new line. He also purchased of land at the northern terminus, built a train station, and leased it to Southern. After completion of the line, he stayed on as the engineer and was the only person that worked in that capacity until the closing of the line. His home still remains on Roberts Drive (his namesake in the Sandy Springs community). As there was no facility to turn around in (South) Roswell, the engine traveled in reverse on the return trip to Chamblee.  Absorption  The Roswell Railroad operated as an independent road until, in 1894, it was absorbed into the newly created Southern Railway. They had one narrow gauge steam locomotive numbered 815, an 0-6-0-arranged Baldwin 1878 steamer named \\"Buck\\" (builder construction number 4321). In 1894, Buck was renumbered N815 in the Southern numbering system. In 1905, the line was converted to and Buck was sold to the S.I.&E.; Co. In 1902, the Bull Sluice Railroad built a line from a junction with the Roswell Branch, just north of Dunwoody, to the Georgia Railway and Power Company's construction site for its hydroelectric Morgan Falls Dam (built to supply electricity to Atlanta's streetcar system, and creating Bull Sluice Lake). The line was built to bring in building materials. Later the Southern purchased this line and it became the Morgan Falls Branch. The Bull Sluice used a steamer named \\"Dinkey\\". In 1905, the line hauled U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt to Roswell to visit Bulloch Hall, the childhood home of his mother Martha Bulloch Roosevelt.

In 2004 it had a population of 907; its inhabitants are called Fromellois. It is located about to the west of Lille. First World War The village of Fromelles was captured by advancing German forces on 9 October 1914 during the \\"Race to the Sea\\". Throughout almost the whole of the war, the front line was stable, running through the territory of the commune and leaving the inhabited area in German hands. The Battle of Aubers Ridge was fought in the area to the northwest of the village on 9 May 1915 as part of the Second Battle of Artois. =Battle of Fromelles= German soldiers posing on a crater left by the explosion of a mine. The photo is dated 9 May 1915, the start of the Battle of Aubers Ridge. The Battle of Fromelles on 19‚Äì20 July 1916 was the first occasion on which the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) saw action on the Western Front. The battle is widely regarded as a disaster for the Allies, and has been described as \\"the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history.\\". It resulted from a plan to divert German attention from the Battle of the Somme, but historians estimate that 5,500 Australians and 2,000 British troops were killed or wounded. The Australian losses were equivalent to the combined total Australian losses in the Boer War, Korean War and Vietnam War: although later World War I actions would be more deadly for the AIF, Fromelles was the only one to achieve no success.. Adolf Hitler is believed to have served as a messenger on the German side with the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division.. =Cemeteries= Many difficulties faced frontline Allied units in the sector following the battle, and the Australian 5th Division found it necessary to bury 400 of its own dead, in a mass grave, about two kilometres north of Fromelles. This particular point on the frontline became known to British Empire troops as \\"V.C. Corner\\" (a name that was probably an ironic reference to the Victoria Cross). On the other side of the lines, many Allied dead were likewise buried hastily by German forces. Following the war, many of these graves were located by the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) and the remains therein were reburied at official cemeteries. At V.C. Corner, the existing mass grave was augmented by the IGWC with unidentified remains found on the battlefield and some from other temporary or otherwise unsuitable sites. After the burial area was reconfigured, and marked with two large concrete crosses, it was officially dedicated, becoming the V.C. Corner Australian Cemetery and Memorial.. The cemetery has remained one of only a few Commonwealth military cemeteries to have no individual headstones. For at least 80 years, the remains of at least 399 Australian and British dead were to remain unaccounted for ‚Äì even though soldiers' personal belongings had been returned to their families, and deaths had been independently investigated and confirmed by the Red Cross,. Following research in the Bavarian Army archives, between 2002 and 2007, by independent military historian Lambis Englezos, a large mass grave, on the outskirts of Fromelles, was identified. The Bois de Phaisan (Pheasant Wood) site, which was confirmed by archaeologists from Glasgow University in July 2007, was reportedly the largest mass grave of Western Allied soldiers to have been discovered since the end of World War I. A full disinterment was carried out in May‚ÄìSeptember 2009, and the bodies of 250 British and Australian soldiers were recovered.. After DNA samples were taken, the bodies were reburied 8n individual graves, about 120 metres from their previous site, at the new Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery.. During the four years of the Great War, British division after division fought in that area of the Western Front which we now know as Fromelles and which forms part of what is now referred to as ‚ÄúThe Forgotten Front‚Äù. Prior to the discovery of the mass graves at Pheasant Wood, Fromelles was known only for being the place where the Australian Imperial Force had experienced its first, and disastrous, taste of action on the Western Front. Whilst Fromelles hosts both the CWGC memorial to the AIF at VC Corner and the Australian Memorial Park, with the exception of a small private memorial to an officer of the Rifle Brigade, no memorial to the British casualties exists in this area. British losses were numbered in their many thousands in and along this line, but the majority of the men killed in action in this area between 1914 and 1918 are commemorated on the Ploegsteert Memorial to the Missing in Belgium. A charitable association, known as the British Memorial Association, Fromelles, has been set up to establish a memorial in Fromelles, dedicated to the thousands of British men who gave their lives in this small corner of France, by educating people about the magnificent efforts of the British Army in this area of the ‚ÄòForgotten Front‚Äô, the Association will endeavour to redress this balance and should be the first port of call for anyone, regardless of nationality, who is interested in Aubers Ridge and Fromelles throughout the Great War..

He was first discovered by Chang Fei during a TV show performance. Before entering Taiwanese showbiz, Kang had switched many jobs. He was first a military policeman (MP), a salesman, then a pub singer for many years. He entered a singing contest in 1997 and won first place with his band. They released an EP in the same year.  Career  It was not until 1998 that Kang began his career in entertainment. Chang Fei praised Kang for a brilliant and quick-witted performance on his popular show, Dragon Brother, Tiger Brother, and agreed to mentor Kang. Kang later met and began working with Jacky Wu. Kang released his first album, Tears Inducing (ÂÇ¨Ê∑ö) in June 1999. The album was a mild success, due to his soul-searching musical direction and humble low-range vocal. However, Kang's songwriting was overshadowed by his obnoxious TV image as a comedian who used foul language, impersonation and slapstick humour as a means to win the audience's heart. The general public tended to focus primarily on his on-screen presence, saying that a singer must have style and Kang was lacking the magic within a singer. The reason for that was not a lack of media exposure or TV coverage, it was due to Kang's public image. Critics had pounded him as \\"ugly looking and badly dressed, with a tumbling voice that can't speak with proper volume and speed\\". Kang had since been working diligently to improve his voice command and speed, as the hard work eventually paid off. His popularity increased as he gained more TV exposure from the support of his boss, Jacky Wu as they appeared in countless classic TV hits such as \\"TV Citizen\\", \\"Electric Playground\\" and \\"Let's Handcuff Him\\". In 2000, Kang released his second album, Happy Birdy Days (Âø´Ê®ÇÈ≥•Êó•Â≠ê). The response was overwhelming and produced many classic songs, such as \\"Happy Birdy Days\\", which is a must sing song in many karaoke places. In 2001, Kang released his third album, Dream Come True (ÂúìÂ§¢), and produced mild success. Following it was a 2002 live album, Kang Kang's Special (Â∫∑Â∫∑ÁöÑÊøïËÉåÁßÄ). Kang's career blossomed when he co-hosted with Jackie Wu on the hit- show \\"Sunday Night 8 o' Clock\\" (Âë®Êó•ÂÖ´ÈªûÈª®). The show was an instant hit, claiming as the sole champion during the Sunday late night TV slot for more than six years straight. Its popularity was due to its renovating structure from in- studio recording to outdoor recording. Adding to that was the introduction of \\"Crossroad\\" (È£üÂ≠óË∑ØÂè£), the outdoor game element that leads a group of guests to famous night markets and restaurants. The game starts with three teams, each led by one TV host, and they must follow certain rules in order to win the race. The rule is simple: each team is first given a title of a single food item and then they must come out a series of 8 food items correlating to the last letter of each item, for example Fried Rice -> Rice Dumpling-> Dumpling And Noodle -> Noodle Soup...and so on. There is an option that grants a team to use 7-11 as a life-saver, but it can only be used once. This newly introduced element was a first in TV game shows, because the Taiwanese culture had its love for food and its night markets for a long time, and what better way to advertise the culture in front of a live audience. Kang was easily the star of the show, as he often mimicked famous stars and singers with his uncanny ability to sing and make eccentric facial expressions at the same time. Often his teammates would respond with tears and laughter during their brief stint as they went on during stages of the game. Coincidentally, Kang's team would often round up as the winner of the show, which later on generated mixed emotions with another host, \\"NONO\\". However, the show lasted a long run and ended in 2008. In 2005, Kang released his fifth album, Who Gives a Damn About Your Mother's Marriage (ÁÆ°‰Ω†Â™ΩÂ™ΩÂ´ÅÁµ¶Ë™∞). It did poorly in both commercial sales and critical acclaim. In the same year, Kang hit bottom low with his TV career, as he was kicked off from Zhang Fei's show \\"Big Brother in Showbizz\\" (Á∂úËóùÂ§ßÂì•Â§ß) due to creative differences. Even though he had the most TV offers in the same year, his popularity declined due to negative tabloid exposure. Critics often panned him as \\"egotistically self-minded, a language abuser, and arrogant as a mule\\". Worse still is that he was often spotted in pubs and other adult-oriented places by paparazzi. He was also hampered by the media as a playboy, often hailing his own sexual prowess and innuendos in public. Kang responded with the remark that his behaviour was only for the sake of the show. In the spring of 2006, Kang Kang reinvented his long-term negative image by losing some weight and concentrating on his own TV shows. In addition, he was romantically involved with his fellow TV assistant. Kang Kang married in 2011 and is now a father of one child. He has toured with Frankie Kao and Jacky Wu as \\"The Three Hard Tenors\\".

A Western saloon is a kind of bar particular to the Old West. Saloons served customers such as fur trappers, cowboys, soldiers, lumberjacks, businessmen, lawmen, outlaws, miners, and gamblers. A saloon might also be known as a \\"watering trough, bughouse, shebang, cantina, grogshop, and gin mill\\". The first saloon was established at Brown's Hole, Wyoming, in 1822, to serve fur trappers. By 1880, the growth of saloons was in full swing. In Leavenworth, Kansas, there were \\"about 150 saloons and four wholesale liquor houses\\".The Week: New York, Thursday, August 13, 1891, pg. 112 Some saloons in the Old West were little more than casinos, brothels, and opium dens. History The word saloon originated as an alternative form of salon, meaning \\"Meaning 'large hall in a public place for entertainment, etc.'\\" In the United States it evolved into its present meaning by 1841. Saloons in the U.S. began to have a close association with breweries in the early 1880s. With a growing overcapacity, breweries began to adopt the British \\"tied-house\\" system of control where they owned saloons outright. Schlitz Brewing Company and a few others built elaborate saloons to attract customers and advertise their beers. Politicians also frequented local saloons because of the adaptable social nature of their business. Temperance illustration of drunkard hitting his wife Beginning in 1893, the Anti-Saloon League began protesting against American saloons. In 1895 it became a national organization and quickly rose to become the most powerful prohibition lobby in America, pushing aside its older competitors the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Prohibition Party. The League lobbied at all levels of government for legislation to prohibit the manufacture or import of spirits, beer and wine. Ministers had launched several efforts to close Arizona saloons after the 1906 creation of League chapters in Yuma, Tucson, and Phoenix. League members pressured local police to take licenses from establishments that violated closing hours or served women and minors, and they provided witnesses to testify about these violations. Its triumph was nationwide prohibition locked into the Constitution with passage of the 18th Amendment in 1920. It was decisively defeated when prohibition was repealed in 1933. =Free lunch= The free lunch was a sales enticement which offered a meal at no cost in order to attract customers and increase revenues from other offerings. It was a tradition once common in saloons in many places in the United States, with the phrase appearing in U.S. literature from about 1870 to the 1920s. These establishments included a \\"free\\" lunch, varying from rudimentary to quite elaborate, with the purchase of at least one drink. These free lunches were typically worth far more than the price of a single drink.\\"Free Lunch in the South.\\" The New York Times, Feb 20, 1875, p. 4. Re value of the lunch, this source speaks of patrons who \\"take one fifteen cent drink [and] eat a dinner which would have cost them $1 in a restaurant.\\" https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1875/02/20/82755928.pdf The saloon-keeper relied on the expectation that most customers would buy more than one drink, and that the practice would build patronage for other times of day. Appearance A saloon's appearance varied from when and where it grew. As towns grew, the saloons became more refined. The bartender prided himself on his appearance and his drink pouring abilities. Early saloons and those in remote locations were often crude affairs with minimal furniture and few decorations. A single wood-burning stove might warm such establishments during the winter months. A pair of \\"batwing\\" doors at the entrance was one of the more distinctive features of the typical saloon. The doors operated on double action hinges and extended from chest to knee level. Further in the American West, some sold liquor from wagons, and saloons were often formed of materials at hand, including \\"sod houses. ...a hull of an old sailing ship\\" or interiors \\"dug into the side of a hill\\". As the size of towns grew, many hotels included saloons, and some stand-alone saloons, such as the Barlow Trail Saloon in Damascus, Oregon, featured a railed porch. Saloons' appearance varied by ethnic group. The Irish preferred stand-up bars where whiskey was the drink of choice and women could obtain service only through the back door. German saloons were more brightly illuminated, more likely to serve restaurant food and beer at tables, and more oriented toward family patronage. Germans were often at odds with Temperance forces over Sunday operation and over the operation of beer gardens in outlying neighborhoods. Other ethnic groups added their own features and their unique cuisines on the sideboard, while a few groups, including Scandinavians, Jews, Greeks, and Italians, either preferred intimate social clubs or did little drinking in public. Entertainment Gambling at the Orient Saloon in Bisbee, Arizona, 1900. Photograph by C.S. Fly. By way of entertainment saloons offered dancing girls, some (or most) of whom occasionally or routinely doubled as prostitutes. Many saloons offered games of chance like Faro, poker, brag, three-card monte, and dice games. Other games were added as saloons continued to prosper and face increasing competition. These additional games included billiards, darts, and bowling. Some saloons even included piano players, can-can girls, and theatrical skits. A current example of this type of entertainment is the Long Branch Variety Show that is presented in the recreated Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas. =Alcohol= When a town was first founded, the initial saloons were often nothing more than tents or shacks that served homemade whiskey that included such ingredients as \\"raw alcohol, burnt sugar and chewing tobacco\\". Rotgut The 1885 Beer Bottle Sidewalk in front of Jim Cotton's Saloon on Washington Street in Phoenix, Arizona As towns grew, saloons were often elaborately decorated, featured Bohemian stemware, and oil paintings were hung from the wall. The hard liquor was improved, often featuring whiskey imported from the Eastern United States and Europe. To avoid rotgut, patrons would request \\"fancy\\" mixed drinks. Some of the top ten drinks in 1881 included claret sangarees and champagne flips. Beer Beer was often served at room temperature since refrigeration was mostly unavailable. Adolphus Busch introduced refrigeration and pasteurization of beer in 1880 with his Budweiser brand. Some saloons kept the beer in kegs stored on racks inside the saloon. Some saloons made their own beer. Sometimes the beer was also kept in chairs, as seen in the motion picture Fort Apache (1948). Notable saloons The Northern, Wyatt Earp's saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, 1902. Josie Earp may be the woman on the horse at left. Among the more familiar saloons were First Chance Saloon in Miles City, Montana; the Bull's Head in Abilene, Kansas; the Arcade Saloon in Eldora, Colorado; the Holy Moses in Creede, Colorado; the Long Branch Saloon in Dodge City, Kansas; the Birdcage Theater in Tombstone, Arizona; the Bucket of Blood Saloon in Virginia City, Nevada; and the Jersey Lilly in Langtry, Texas. Many of these establishments remained open twenty- four hours a day, six days a week except Sundays and Christmas. =Bull's Head= In the American West, occasional incidents were connected to saloons. Phil Coe, the owner of the Bull's Head tavern in Abilene, Kansas, outraged the townspeople by painting a bull, complete with an erect penis (pizzle), on the outside wall of his tavern. The marshal at the time, Wild Bill Hickok, threatened to burn the saloon to the ground if the offending animal was not painted over. Instead, he hired some men to do the job, which angered Coe. The two became enemies and in a later altercation, Wild Bill Hickok killed Coe. Wild Bill, also a professional lawman, gunfighter, and gambler, was later killed on August 2, 1876 by Jack McCall, who shot him in the back of the head, in Saloon No. 10, in Deadwood, South Dakota as Wild Bill was playing cards. His hand‚Äîaces and eights, according to tradition‚Äîhas become known as the \\"dead man's hand\\". =Wyatt Earp's saloons= Former lawman, faro dealer, and gambler Wyatt Earp worked in or owned several saloons during his lifetime, outright or in partnership with others. He and two of his brothers arrived in Tombstone, Arizona on December 1, 1879 and during January 1881, Oriental Saloon owner Lou Rickabaugh gave Wyatt Earp a one-quarter interest in the faro concession at the Oriental Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer. Wyatt invited his friend, lawman and gambler Bat Masterson, to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in the Oriental Saloon. In 1884, after leaving Tombstone, Wyatt and his wife Josie, Warren, James and Bessie Earp went to Eagle City, Idaho, another boom town. Wyatt was looking for gold in the Murray-Eagle mining district. They opened a saloon called The White Elephant in a circus tent. An advertisement in a local newspaper suggested gentlemen \\"come and see the elephant\\". In 1885, Earp and Josie moved to San Diego where the railroad was about to arrive and a real estate boom was underway. They stayed for about four years. Earp speculated in San Diego's booming real estate market. Between 1887 and around 1896 he bought three saloons and gambling halls, one on Fourth Street and the other two near Sixth and E, all in the \\"respectable\\" part of town. They offered twenty-one games including faro, blackjack, poker, keno, and other Victorian games of chance like pedro and monte. At the height of the boom, he made up to $1,000 a night in profit. Wyatt particularly favored and may have run the Oyster Bar located in the Louis Bank of Commerce on Fifth Avenue. In the fall of 1897, Earp and Josie joined in the Alaska Gold Rush and headed for Nome, Alaska. He operated a canteen during the summer of 1899 and in September, Earp and partner Charles Ellsworth Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon in Nome, Alaska, the city's first two- story wooden building and its largest and most luxurious saloon. The building was used for a variety of purposes because it was so large: with ceilings. Wyatt and Josie returned to California in 1901 with an estimated $80,000. In February 1902, they arrived in Tonopah, Nevada, where gold had been discovered and a boom was under way. He opened the Northern Saloon in Tonopah, Nevada and served as a deputy U.S. Marshal under Marshal J.F. Emmitt. His saloon, gambling and mining interests were profitable for a period.

After complaints to Liverpool's Social Services by her eldest sister, Mimi Smith (n√©e Stanley), she handed over the care of her son to her sister. She later had one daughter after an affair with a Welsh soldier, but the baby was given up for adoption after pressure from her family. She then had two daughters, Julia and Jackie, with John 'Bobby' Dykins. She never divorced her husband, preferring to live as the common-law wife of Dykins for the rest of her life. She was known as being high-spirited and impulsive, musical, and having a strong sense of humour. She taught her son how to play the banjo and ukulele. She kept in almost daily contact with John, and when he was in his teens he often stayed overnight at her and Dykins' house. On 15 July 1958, she was struck down and killed by a car driven by an off-duty policeman, close to her sister's house at 251 Menlove Avenue. Lennon was traumatised by her death and wrote several songs about her, including \\"Julia\\" and \\"Mother\\". Biographer Ian MacDonald wrote that she was, \\"to a great extent ... her son's muse\\". Background Julia Stanley, later known by the family as Judy, was born at 8 Head Street, Toxteth, South Liverpool in 1914, and was the fourth of five sisters. Her mother, Annie Jane (n√©e Millward), gave birth to a boy and then a girl, both of whom died shortly after birth. She then had Mary, known as 'Mimi' (1906‚Äì1991), Elizabeth 'Mater' (1908‚Äì1976), Anne 'Nanny' (1911‚Äì1988), Julia 'Judy' (1914‚Äì1958), and Harriet 'Harrie' (1916‚Äì1972). John Lennon would later comment that the 'Stanley girls' were \\"five, fantastic, strong, beautiful, and intelligent women\\". Their father, George Ernest Stanley, retired from the Merchant Navy and found a job with the Liverpool & Glasgow Salvage Association as an insurance investigator. He moved his family to the suburb of Wavertree, where they lived in a small terraced house at 9 Newcastle Road near to Penny Lane. Her mother died in 1945, and Julia had to take care of her father with help from her oldest sister. Marriage to Alf Lennon Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon‚Äîalways called 'Alf' by his family‚Äîwas always joking but never held a job for very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many vaudeville theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name. At the Trocadero club, a converted cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool, he first saw an \\"auburn-haired girl with a bright smile and high cheekbones\\"; Julia Stanley. He saw her again in Sefton Park, where he had gone with a friend to meet girls. Lennon, who was dressed in a bowler hat and with a cigarette holder in hand, saw \\"this little waif\\" sitting on a wrought-iron bench. Julia (14 years old) said that his hat looked \\"silly\\", to which the 15-year-old Alf replied that she looked \\"lovely\\", and sat down next to her. She asked him to take off his hat, so he promptly threw it straight into the Sefton Park lake. Sefton Park, where Julia Stanley first met Alf Lennon Despite standing only tall in heels, she often caught the gaze of men in the street, being attractive and full-figured. She was always well-dressed and even went to bed with make-up on so as to \\"look beautiful when she woke up\\". A nephew later said that she could \\"make a joke out of nothing\\", and could have \\"walked out of a burning house with a smile and a joke\\". She frequented Liverpool's dance halls and clubs where she was often asked to dance in jitterbug competitions with dockers, soldiers, sailors, and waiters. It was remarked that she could be as humorous as any man and would sing the popular songs of the day at any time of day or night. Her voice sounded similar to Vera Lynn's, whilst Lennon specialised in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. She played the ukulele, the piano accordion, and the banjo (as did Lennon), although neither pursued music professionally.The Beatles Anthology DVD 2003 (Episode 1 ‚Äì 0:07:06) McCartney and Lennon talking about Julia Lennon. They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and talking of what they would do in the future: opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. On 3 December 1938, 11 years after they had first met, she married Alf Lennon after she had proposed to him. They were married in the Bolton Street Registry office, although none of her family were present as she had not informed them of the wedding. She wrote 'cinema usherette' as her occupation on the marriage certificate, even though she had never been one. They spent their honeymoon eating at Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where their son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), and then went to a cinema. She walked into 9 Newcastle Road waving the marriage licence and said to her family, \\"There!‚ÄîI've married him.\\" It was an act of defiance against her father, who had threatened to disown her if she ever cohabitated with a lover. On their wedding night, she stayed at her parents' house, and Lennon went back to his boarding house. The next day, he went back to sea for three months, on a ship bound for the West Indies. The Stanley family completely ignored her husband at first, believing him to be of \\"no use to anyone‚Äîcertainly not our Julia\\". Her father demanded that Lennon present something concrete to show that he could financially support his daughter, but Lennon signed on as a Merchant Navy steward on a ship bound for the Mediterranean. He returned after a few months at sea and moved into the Stanley home. He auditioned for local theatre managers as an entertainer but had no success. Julia found out that she was pregnant (with John) in January 1940, but as the war had started her husband continued to serve as a merchant seaman during World War II, sending money home regularly.The Beatles Anthology DVD 2003 (Episode 6 ‚Äì 0:37:32) Lennon talking about living at 9 Newcastle Road in Liverpool. The payments stopped after Alf deserted in 1943. =John= 9 Newcastle Road, Liverpool; the former home of the Stanley family Julia gave birth to John Winston Lennon on 9 October 1940, in the second-floor ward of the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital in Liverpool, during World War II. Her eldest sister, Mimi, phoned the hospital and was told that she had given birth to a boy. Mimi would later claim that she went straight to the hospital during the middle of an air raid and was forced to hide in doorways to avoid the shrapnel from falling bombs, but in actuality, there had been no attack on Liverpool that night. Alf was not present at their son's birth, as he was at sea. Young Lennon started at his first school in November 1945‚Äî Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree‚Äî so she found a part-time job at a caf√© near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi‚Äîwho twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services to complain about the infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins‚Äîshe reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July 1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251 Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child had to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again. She took John back to her house and enrolled him in a local school, but after a few weeks she handed him back to Mimi. Various reasons have been suggested for her decision, such as Dykins' unwillingness to raise the young boy, Julia's inability to cope with the responsibility, or a punishment forced on her by Mimi and her father for \\"living in sin\\". Lennon blamed himself, saying later, \\"My mother ... couldn't cope with me.\\" He then lived continuously at 'Mendips', in the smallest bedroom above the front door, with Mimi determined to give him a \\"proper upbringing\\". Julia later bought Lennon his first guitar for ¬£5/10- (five pounds, ten shillings) after Lennon had pestered her incessantly for weeks, but insisted it had to be delivered to her house, not her sister's. As Lennon had difficulty learning chords, she taught him banjo and ukulele chords, which were simpler,The Beatles Anthology DVD 2003 (Episode 1 ‚Äì 0:14:30) Lennon talking about the banjo and Julia. and later taught Lennon how to play the piano accordion. Julia's banjo was the first instrument that John learned to play 'sitting there with endless patience until I managed to work out all the chords.' After Julia's untimely death, the instrument was never seen again and its whereabouts remains a mystery. As Mimi refused to have a record player in her house, Lennon learned how to play his favorite songs by going to Julia's house. She played Elvis records to Lennon and would dance around her kitchen with him. In 1957, when The Quarrymen played at St. Barnabas Hall, Penny Lane, Julia turned up to watch. After each song she would clap and whistle louder than everyone else and was seen \\"swaying and dancing\\" throughout the whole concert. Lennon frequently visited her house during that period, detailing his anxieties and problems, where she gave him encouragement to continue with music over Mimi's objections. =Victoria= During 1942‚Äì1943, Julia lived with her son at The Dairy Cottage, 120a Allerton Road, Woolton. The cottage was owned by Mimi's husband, and Mimi wanted Julia to live there because they would be closer to her house and also out of the Stanley house. As Alf was often away at sea, Julia started going out to dance halls. In 1942, she met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was stationed in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf later blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling her that because there was a war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. After an evening out, she would often give her young son a piece of chocolate or shortcrust pastry the next morning for breakfast. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier. Williams refused to live with Julia‚Äîwho was still married to Alf‚Äîuntil she gave up John, which she refused to do. When Alf eventually came home in 1944, he offered to look after his wife, their son, and the expected baby, but she rejected the idea. Alf took John to his brother Sydney's house, in the Liverpool suburb of Maghull, a few months before Julia came to term. Julia's daughter, Victoria Elizabeth, born in the Elmswood Nursing Home on 19 June 1945, was subsequently given up for adoption to a Norwegian Salvation Army Captain and his wife (Peder and Margaret Pedersen) after intense pressure from the Stanley family. John Lennon was informed by his Aunt Harriet of her existence in 1964. John was so overcome by emotion, wanting to find his sister, that he placed an ad in the paper, and hired detectives to look for her. They searched Norway for Victoria, and came up empty handed, and John died never having found or met her. Her adoptive name is Ingrid Pedersen. =John \\"Bobby\\" Albert Dykins= Julia started seeing Dykins a year after Victoria's birth (although they had known each other before) when she was working in the caf√© near Lennon's primary school, Mosspits. Dykins was a good-looking, well-dressed man who worked at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool as a wine steward. She later moved into a small flat in Gateacre with Dykins. He enjoyed luxuries, and had access to rationed goods like alcohol, chocolate, silk stockings and cigarettes, which was what initially attracted her. The Stanley sisters called him \\"Spiv\\", because of his pencil-thin moustache, margarine-coated hair, and pork-pie hat, and the young Lennon called him \\"Twitchy\\" because of a physical tic/nervous cough. Julia's family and friends remembered that he also had a fiery temperament, which could result in his being violent when drunk. Lennon remembered seeing his mother during a visit to Mimi's, when her face was bleeding after being hit by Dykins. Paul McCartney later stated that Julia living in sin with Dykins while she was still married was a point of social ostracization for Lennon, as it was often used as a \\"cheap shot\\" against him. Although Julia never divorced Alf, she was considered to be the common-law wife of Dykins. She wanted Lennon to live with them both, but he was passed between the Stanley sisters and often ran away to Mimi's, where she would open the door to find Lennon standing there, \\"his face covered in tears\\". Julia was accused by the family of being frivolous and unreliable‚Äî she never enjoyed household chores‚Äî and was once seen sweeping the kitchen floor with a pair of knickers on her head. Her cooking methods were also haphazard, as she would mix things \\"like a mad scientist\\", and even put tea \\"or anything else that came to hand\\" in a stew. A favourite joke would be to wear a pair of spectacles that had no glass in them, and then to scratch her eye through the empty frame. 1 Blomfield Road, Liverpool, where Julia and Dykins lived Dykins later managed several bars in Liverpool, which allowed Julia to stay at home and look after their two daughters (Julia and Jackie) and Lennon, who often visited and stayed overnight, at 1 Blomfield Road, Liverpool. Lennon and McCartney would rehearse in the bathroom of the house where the acoustics \\"sounded like a recording studio\\". Dykins used to give Lennon weekly pocket money (one shilling) for doing odd jobs, on top of the five shillings that Mimi gave him. In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane, but Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards, as it was \\"not [Stanley] family business\\". =Julia and Jackie= Julia had two daughters with Dykins: Julia Baird (n√©e Dykins ‚Äì b. 5 March 1947) and Jacqueline (Jackie) Dykins (b. 26 October 1949). As Jackie was born prematurely, her mother visited the hospital every day to see her. When Lennon was 11 years old, he started to visit the Dykins' house, and often stayed overnight. Baird would give up her bed to him, then share her sister's bed. Baird remembered that after Lennon had visited them, her mother would often play a record called, My Son John, To Me You Are So Wonderful, \\"by some old crooner, and sit and listen to it\\". [Baird probably meant \\"My Son John\\"‚Äîsung by David Whitfield‚Äîwhich was released in 1956]. After Julia's death, the two girls (aged eleven and eight) were sent to stay in Edinburgh at Aunt Mater's (Elizabeth) and were only told two months later by Aunt Mater's husband, Norman Birch, that their mother had died. The commercial success of the Beatles allowed Lennon to buy a 4-bedroomed house in Gateacre Park Drive, Liverpool, for Baird and Jackie to live in with Lennon's Aunt Harriet and Birch. They had previously been made legal guardians of the two girls; Dykins' parentage had been disregarded as he had never legally married Julia. After Lennon's death and Harriet died, Lennon's wife, Yoko Ono, wanted to sell the house‚Äî as it was still in Lennon's name‚Äî but she later gave it to the Salvation Army on 2 November 1993, even though Lennon had once written a letter, stating: \\"I always thought of the house he's in [Birch] as my contribution towards looking after Julia [Baird] and Jackie. I would prefer the girls to use it.\\" Baird and Jackie later met their half-sister, Victoria/Ingrid, when they were present at the ceremony to place a Blue Heritage plaque on Mimi's house to commemorate that Lennon had lived there. Stanley Parkes (Lennon's cousin) was on the ladder fixing the plaque to the wall and said, \\"I think I can see Ingrid\\" [walking towards the house]. Baird and her sister were surprised, as it meant that Parkes had seen Ingrid before, even though Baird and Jackie never had. When all three finally met for the first time Baird was shocked that Ingrid did not look anything like the Stanley family, as she had \\"pale blue eyes and fair hair\\". Death Julia visited Mimi's house nearly every day, where they would chat over tea and cakes in the morning room or stand in the garden when it was warm. On the evening of 15 July 1958, Nigel Walley went to visit Lennon and found Julia and Mimi talking by the front gate. Lennon was not there, as he was at the Blomfield Road house. Walley accompanied Julia to the bus stop further north along Menlove Avenue, with her telling jokes along the way. At about 9:30, Walley left her to walk up Vale Road and she crossed Menlove Avenue to the central reservation between two traffic lines, which was lined with hedges that covered disused tram tracks. Moments later, Walley heard \\"a loud thud\\", and turned to see her body \\"flying through the air\\"‚Äîwhich landed about from where she had been hit. He ran back to get Mimi and they waited for the ambulance, with Mimi crying hysterically. Julia was struck and killed by a Standard Vanguard car, driven by an off-duty constable, PC Eric Clague, who was a learner-driver. Clague was acquitted of all charges and given a short suspension from duty. When Mimi heard the verdict she was so incensed that she shouted \\"Murderer!\\" at Clague. Clague later left the police force and became a postman. Lennon could not bring himself to look at his mother's body when he was taken to the Sefton General Hospital, and was so distraught that he put his head on Mimi's lap throughout the funeral service. Lennon refused to talk to Walley for months afterwards, and Walley felt that Lennon somehow held him responsible. Julia was buried in Allerton Cemetery, in Liverpool. Her gravesite was for some time unmarked, but it was later identified as \\"CE (Church of England) 38-805\\". The graveyard's location is approx. 1.19 miles east of 1 Blomfield Road. Baird said that the Stanley family hoped to finally put a headstone on her mother's grave, which she hoped \\"will be a private affair for the family and not for the public\\". A headstone was subsequently placed on Julia's grave (replacing a wooden cross), with the words \\"Mummy, John, Victoria, Julia, Jackie\\" inscribed. Julia Lennon's grave in Allerton Cemetery Effect on John His mother's death traumatised the teenage Lennon and, for the next two years, he drank heavily and frequently got into fights, consumed by a \\"blind rage\\". It contributed to the emotional difficulties that haunted him for much of his life, but also served to draw him closer to McCartney, who had also lost his mother at an early age. Julia's memory inspired songs such as the 1968 Beatles song \\"Julia\\", with its dreamlike imagery of \\"hair of floating sky glimmering\\", recalling Lennon's boyhood memories of his mother. Lennon remarked that the song \\"was sort of a combination of Yoko [Ono] and my mother blended into one\\". \\"Mother\\" and \\"My Mummy's Dead\\" were both written under the influence of Arthur Janov's \\"Primal Scream\\" therapy, and released on his solo album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band in 1970. Lennon's first son, Julian, born in 1963, was named after her. Portrayals on film She was portrayed by Christine Kavanagh in In His Life: The John Lennon Story (2000), and by Anne-Marie Duff in Nowhere Boy (2009).

He played club football in Russia for Chernomorets Novorossiysk, Spartak Moscow, FC Moscow, FC Terek Grozny and FC Vityaz Podolsk. Club career In 1997, after playing some amateur football in Cameroon, Tchuisse moved to Russia. After unsuccessfully trying to get into a university in Krasnodar, Tchuisse was spotted by the coach of an amateur side \\"Neftyannik\\", from the nearby Goryachy Klyuch, while playing football with his friends. Less than half a year later, his impressive displays for the Krasnodar Krai team, at an exhibition event, earned him his first professional contract and a move to the Russian Top Division (as it was known at the time) side Chernomorets Novorossiysk. During his time at Novorossiysk, Tchuisse received a career-threatening injury, after a bad challenge by Valery Kechinov. Tchuisse recovered and soon signed for the league champions Spartak Moscow. With Spartak, the Cameroonian won two domestic league titles. In 2000, Tchuisse made his European debut in the UEFA Champions League. Tense relations with his teammates, however, forced the player to look for a move away. Tchuisse was linked with a possible move to RC Lens, but no deal ever materialized and the player, eventually, returned to Chernomorets Novorossiysk. After the club's relegation to the Russian First Division, Tchuisse received an offer from the newly formed ambitious FC Moscow. During his three-year spell at the Moscow club, Tchuisse scored his first professional goal. His two goals for FC Moscow still remain his only goals scored for a professional club.

History =Origins= Traditionally the original ancestor of the Clan Cochrane in Scotland was a Scandinavian Viking who settled in what is now known as Renfrewshire,Cochrane, Alexander. (1983). The Fighting Cochranes. A Scottish Clan With Over Six Hundred Years of Naval and Military History. . between the eighth and tenth centuries. It is evident that the name is of territorial origin, derived from the lands of Cochrane near Paisley., p. 534., p. 57., p. 158. The origin of the name itself is believed to be derived from two Gaelic words which jointly mean The Roar of the Battle or Battle Cry. The Cochranes took the boar as their heraldic beast, in keeping with the character of their traditional ancestor. The three boar's heads adorning the chief's shield are said to represent the exploits of a warrior who killed three of the beasts who were terrorizing the countryside. Another traditional origin of the name Cochrane is that it comes from when an early member of the family fought in battle with such bravery that his leader singled him out from the others and clapped him on the shoulder calling him coch ran which means brave fellow. The first record of the name occurs in 1262, when a certain Waldeve de Coueran witnessed a charter concerning a transfer of lands between Dubhghall Mac Suibhne and Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith., p. 334. Other early bearers of the name are William de Coughran in 1296, who signed submission to King Edward the First in the Ragman Roll;Scot's Peerage and Chronicles of the Cochran by Ida Cochran Haughton p. 11 and Robert de Cochrane in about 1360., p. 695. The name of 1296 appears in the Ragman Rolls swearing fealty to Edward I of England. =14th, 15th and 16th centuries= In 1346 John de Coveran appears as a witness in the election of an Abbot of Paisley. Goseline de Cochran appears as a witness to several grants made by Robert the Steward to Paisley Abbey in 1366. Robert Cochrane (later to become an Earl of Mar (1458‚Äì79) constructed most of what is still standing of Auchindoun Castle. It was passed to the Clan Ogilvy in 1489 and from them to the Clan Gordon in 1535. In 1456 Robert Cochrane of Cochrane resigned the lands of Cochrane to his successor Allen Cochrane who received a charter from King James II of Scotland. Edward Cochrane was accused but cleared of having anything to do with the detention of King James III of Scotland at Edinburgh Castle in 1482. In 1556 William Cochrane, chief of Clan Cochrane obtained a charter of confirmation for the lands of Cochrane from Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1584 chief William Cochrane, along with several others, was charged with being involved in the murder of Patrick Maxwell, but Cochrane was never brought to trial. In 1592 the Clan MacKintosh sacked Auchindoun Castle, which had been built by Clan Cochrane but which at the time belonged to the 6th Earl of Huntly, George Gordon, in retaliation for his killing of their ally, the Bonny Earl of Moray. Also in 1592 chief William Cochrane built a high free stone tower, known as Cochrane Tower or Cochrane Castle. =17th century and Civil War= In about 1350 Robert II of Scotland had built Dundonald Castle in Ayrshire. The castle came into Cochrane hands in about 1638 and it was from there that William Cochrane, 1st Earl of Dundonald took his title. During the Civil War of the 17th century the Clan Cochrane supported the royalist cause. Throughout the war clansman Sir John Cochrane travelled extensively abroad as the king's representative. The chief 'Lord Cochrane' fought in the royalist army at the Battle of Preston (1648). In 1669 the Cochrane chief's title was raised from a Lord to an Earl when Sir William Cochrane was created 1st Earl of Dundonald. After the death of the 7th Earl, the descendants of Sir William's second son became the Earls. =18th century and Jacobite risings= During the Jacobite rising of 1745 the main part of Clan Cochrane supported the British government and in the government army under General Sir John Cope there were two Cochrane officers; Captain John Cochrane and Captain Basil Cochrane, both were clansmen related to the chief, Earl of Dundonald. Both were taken prisoner at the Battle of Prestonpans in 1745. However, on the Jacobite side William Cochrane of Ferguslie shared in the victory. In October 1745 the seventh Earl of Dundonald had his horse shot from underneath him by Jacobites at the West Port, Edinburgh. Later throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the Cochranes distinguished themselves in both land and naval forces, and came to be nicknamed the \\"Fighting Cochranes.\\" The Cochranes are known to have played an important role during the Napoleonic Wars. The most noteworthy of these fighting Cochranes was Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775‚Äì1860) who joined the Royal Navy at the age of 18. The high point of his career was when a brig under his command with a crew of only fifty-four managed to capture a Spanish frigate with a crew of over three hundred sailors and 32 heavy guns. He followed this by defending Trinidad Castle against the French in 1808. He later became the commander of Chile's navy and assisted that country, along with Peru, Brazil and Greece, to become independent. He was known as Lord Cochrane. He is buried at Westminster Abbey in Westminster, London. =20th century= The father of the present chief, who was the fourteenth Earl served with the Black Watch, then during World War Two, he served in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and Greece. When the war ended, he served with the War Office and in Germany until he retired in 1953. Sir Ralph Cochrane the youngest son of Thomas Cochrane, 1st Baron Cochrane of Cults, was a British pilot and Royal Air Force officer, perhaps best known for his role in Operation Chastise‚Äìthe famous \\"Dambusters\\" raid. Clan Chief The chief of the Name and Arms of Cochrane is Iain Alexander Douglas Blair Cochrane, 15th Earl of Dundonald, 10th Baron Cochrane of Dundonald as well as 10th Baron of Paisley and Ochiltree. He is also the 5th Marquess of Maranh√£o in Brazil.

Most members of the SLC group are located in the cell membrane. The SLC gene nomenclature system was originally proposed by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and is the basis for the official HGNC names of the genes that encode these transporters. A more general transmembrane transporter classification can be found in TCDB database. Solutes that are transported by the various SLC group members are extremely diverse and include both charged and uncharged organic molecules as well as inorganic ions and the gas ammonia. As is typical of integral membrane proteins, SLCs contain a number of hydrophobic transmembrane alpha helices connected to each other by hydrophilic intra- and extra-cellular loops. Depending on the SLC, these transporters are functional as either monomers or obligate homo- or hetero-oligomers. Many SLC families are members of the major facilitator superfamily. Scope By convention of the nomenclature system, members within an individual SLC family have greater than 20-25% sequence identity to each other. In contrast, the homology between SLC families is very low to non-existent. Hence, the criteria for inclusion of a family into the SLC group is not evolutionary relatedness to other SLC families but rather functional (i.e., an integral membrane protein that transports a solute). The SLC group include examples of transport proteins that are: * facilitative transporters (allow solutes to flow downhill with their electrochemical gradients) * secondary active transporters (allow solutes to flow uphill against their electrochemical gradient by coupling to transport of a second solute that flows downhill with its gradient such that the overall free energy change is still favorable) The SLC series does not include members of transport protein families that have previously been classified by other widely accepted nomenclature systems including: * primary active transporters (allow flow uphill against electrochemical gradients) such as ABC (ATP Binding Cassette) transporters by coupling transport to an energy releasing event such as ATP hydrolysis * ion channels * aquaporins (water channels) Subcellular distribution Most members of the SLC group are located in the cell membrane, but some members are located in mitochondria (the most notable one being SLC family 25) or other intracellular organelles. Nomenclature system Names of individual SLC members have the following format: * SLCnXm where: * SLC is the root name (SoLute Carrier) * n = an integer representing a family (e.g., 1-52) * X = a single letter (A, B, C, ...) denoting a subfamily * m = an integer representing an individual family member (isoform). For example, is the first isoform of subfamily A of SLC family 1. An exception occurs with SLC family 21 (the organic anion transporting polypeptide transporters), which for historical reasons have names in the format SLCOnXm where n = family number, X = subfamily letter, and m = member number. While the HGNC only assign nomenclature to human genes, by convention vertebrate orthologs of these genes adopt the same nomenclature (e.g., VGNC-assigned orthologs of SLC10A1). For rodents, the case of the symbols differs from other vertebrates by using title case, i.e. Slc1a1 denotes the rodent ortholog of the human SLC1A1 gene.

For other people by this name, please see William Ramsay (disambiguation). William Ramsay (6 June 1868-4 September 1914) was a Scottish-born Australian shoe polish manufacturer. In 1906, Ramsay developed \\"Kiwi\\" brand shoe polish, today one of the most famous shoe polish brands in the world. Born in Glasgow in 1868, Ramsay moved to Australia at the age of ten, settling with his family in Melbourne in June, 1878. The family prospered in Victoria; Ramsay's father, John, was a die-sinker and engraver in Scotland, but became a successful real estate broker in his adopted homeland. After he left school, William Ramsay set up a real estate firm with his father. The business, \\"John Ramsay & Son\\", prospered. After a trip to New Zealand, where he met and married Annie Elizabeth Meek in Oamaru on 2 January 1901, Ramsay established a factory in Carlton in partnership with Hamilton McKellar. From there, Ramsay & McKellar would produce disinfectants, polishes, creams, and a variety of other products. In 1904 the pair moved the factory to Elizabeth Street, in Melbourne, where, in 1906, they began producing a new shoe polish under the trademark \\"Kiwi\\". The polish, which would become phenomenally successful in Australia within a few years, was named in honour of Annie Ramsay's New Zealand heritage. In 1912, after McKellar had left the company, Ramsay's father established a branch of Kiwi Polish Co. in London, in the United Kingdom, and in 1913 William Ramsay himself headed to the region to promote the new brand in Europe. Ramsay died of cancer in the family home at Essendon, in Melbourne, outlived by his wife and two sons. His father would follow ten years later. Two of Ramsay's brothers also went on to achieve notability: Sir John Ramsay as a surgeon and cricketer, and Hugh Ramsay as an artist.

It is bounded by Lawrence Avenue to the north, Bathurst Street to the east, a line south of Stayner Avenue to the south, and the CNR tracks to the west. Prior to the amalgamation of Metropolitan Toronto in 1998, it was part of the city of North York. It is also included as part of the larger official Yorkdale-Glen Park neighbourhood. Character and demographics For the most part, Glen Park homes tend to date back to the 1950s and 1960s, when developers perfected the uniform vista of bungalows and backsplits. Glen Park is a middle-class suburban community of brick houses. Local shopping areas include Lawrence Plaza, and various street shopping areas along Dufferin Street and along Marlee Avenue. The western section of Glen Park ‚Äî centered on Dufferin Street ‚Äî is home to a large Italian-Canadian population. The eastern section of Glen Park (often referred to as Englemount) is a primarily Orthodox Jewish community that resides closer to Bathurst Street. While the area west of the Allen Expressway is considered to part of the administrative neighbourhood of Yorkdale-Glen Park by the City of Toronto, the area east of the Allen is along with Lawrence Manor considered part of Englemount-Lawrence.

The airport is owned by Kings Bay, who also owns the company town. The only flights available are to Svalbard Airport, Longyear, operated two to four times a week by Lufttransport using Dornier Do 228 aircraft. The services are organized as corporate charters and tickets are only available after permission from Kings Bay. Between 1925 and 1928, Ny-√Ölesund saw four air expeditions to the North Pole, two of which required the construction of an airship hangar and mast. The first proposal for an airport in Ny-√Ölesund was launched in 1956 by Norsk Polar Navigasjon, who proposed an airport at Kvadehuksletta. Soviet protests against the airport caused the Norwegian authorities to oppose the plans, which were laid to rest in the early 1960s. Construction at Hamnerabben started in 1965 following the decision to build Kongsfjord Telemetry Station. The airport first hosted service to temporary landing strips near Longyearbyen, but from 1975 served Svalbard Airport. Lufttransport started flights with helicopters in the 1980s, but from 1989 has flown with fixed-wing aircraft. History Norge in Ny-√Ölesund in 1926 =Early aviation in Ny- √Ölesund= Ny-√Ölesund was established as a mining company town by Kings Bay in 1916.Hanoa: 14 Between 1925 and 1928, four attempts were made to reach the North Pole by air from Ny-√Ölesund. In May 1925, Roald Amundsen used Ny-√Ölesund as a base for two flying boats, but the expedition failed to come closer than 88 degrees north.Hisdal: 102 On 9 May 1926,Hanoa: 47 Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd used Ny-√Ölesund as both the starting and landing for their expedition. Although they claimed to have reached the pole, there is strong evidence that they could not have accomplished this.Hisdal: 103 On 11 May, Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-√Ölesund and traveled via the North Pole to Alaska. This is regarded as the first successful expedition to the North Pole. After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-√Ölesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the North Pole, but crashed on the return.Hisdal: 49 The flying boats did not require any specific infrastructure, although they had to be brought by ship to Ny-√Ölesund, where they were assembled. They took off from a manually groomed air strip on snow.Hanoa: 46 For the airship expeditions, a hangar and a mast were needed. Twenty-two carpenters arrived in October 1925 along with supplies on SS Alekto. Materials were transported to the site by railway after a track had been laid to the site from the port. The tall steel mast was completed in December. The wooden hangar was with a height of . It was covered in of tarp. The hangar was completed on 15 February 1926. Mining ceased in Ny-√Ölesund in 1929; it was taken up again in 1941,Hanoa: 61 but because of the Second World War the town was evacuated the following year.Hanoa: 73 From 1946, the Royal Norwegian Air Force started serving Ny- √Ölesund with their Consolidated PBY Catalina amphibian aircraft. The aircraft were able to land if there was no ice on the fjord and lighting and weather permitted it. The first flight took place on 10 May and consisted of post drops. No further flights were carried out until 1949; one of the flights that year was an air ambulance operation. The service also dropped post at the other Norwegian settlements in Svalbard. In 1961, the Catalinas were replaced with Grumman HU-16B Albatross aircraft.Hanoa: 159 =Kvadehuksletta proposal= The first proposal for an airport serving Ny-√Ölesund was launched by the brothers Einar Sverre Pedersen and Gunnar Sverre Pedersen. Einar worked as chief navigator in the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and was instrumental in developing the airline routes over the North Pole.Tamnes: 14 He envisioned that the airport in Svalbard could serve as an emergency landing aerodrome for intercontinental flights, and proposed that the Norwegian trunk airline service be extended to Svalbard.Tamnes: 15 The brothers went on an expedition to Spitsbergen in 1956 to conduct further surveys. Their initial observations concluded that Kvadehussletta, the outermost part of Br√∏ggerhalv√∏ya, was the best-suited place for a major airport. They initially planned for a long runway, which could easily be expanded to . Hotellneset and Adventdalen, both close to Longyearbyen, were rejected because the areas were too small and due to poor weather conditions. The brothers presented the idea to the Government of Norway and SAS, but neither party was interested in investing in an airport. They contacted Kings Bay and asked the company to lease or purchase land to build the airport. The company was positive, but required that the airport remained under Norwegian ownership and regulations. On 22 October 1958, negotiations started with Vestlandske Flyselskap to start an airline service from the mainland to Svalbard. Financing of the airport was in part to be secured through a Hilton hotel, which would provide accommodation for tourists, and the \\"Roald Amundsen Institute,\\" a planned research station.Tamnes: 16 Although the brothers received initial support from the government,Tamnes: 17 the Soviet Union officially protested the airport on 5 November 1958. They claimed it could be used as an air force base‚Äîand thus would be a violation of the Svalbard Treaty‚Äîand pointed out that planning was partially financed with American military funding and that Gunnar was a military officer.Tamnes: 18 From then on the Norwegian government started actively opposing the airport.Tamnes: 20 At first they asked the company to cease operations,Tamnes: 19 then asked the American military to cut funding.Tamnes: 26 They also instructed all government-owned companies to not allow an airport to be built on their ground.Tamnes: 29 The government also used Gunnar's military rank to hinder him, to limited extent, from pursuing the plans.Tamnes: 43 The Aviation Act, which required all airports to have a concession to operate, came into effect from 1961, effectively stopping the plans.Tamnes: 33 =Hamnerabben= Scientific test flight Following the 1962 mining accident and the subsequent Kings Bay Affair, Ny-√Ölesund was transformed from a mining town to a research outpost.Hanoa: 172 The need for an airport to support commercial activity in Ny-√Ölesund arose in 1965 with the construction of Kongsfjord Telemetry Station. The Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research needed to have an aviation connection with Longyearbyen to send magnetic tapes with the downloaded data to Germany. A road was built from the settlement to Hamnerabben, the site of the telemetry station. The top of the hill was sufficiently flat that a runway could be constructed. It was built by giving a long straight section of the road a width of . Waste oil was poured on the gravel to bind it. A smaller road was built to the north of the runway to allow road transport while the runway was in use.Hanoa: 185 The airport was largely used to fly to Longyearbyen, although a limited number of flights were undertaken to the mainland. In addition to magnetic tapes, the aircraft were used to transport personnel and cargo, particularly during winter.Hanoa: 186 Services were originally operated by Ski- og Sj√∏fly, but were later taken over by Svalbard-Fly,Hanoa: 209 both of which had their Cessna 185 aircraft stationed in Ny-√Ölesund. On 3 June 1970, a miner with a fractured skull was transported by ship from Longyearbyen to Ny-√Ölesund and sent on board a Piper PA-31 Navajo to the mainland for treatment.Holm: 96 After the telemetry station closed in 1974, the airport was taken over by Kings Bay.Holm: 97 During this period, Longyearbyen was served by a planed section of tundra in Adventdalen.Holm: 128 The terminal facilities Svalbard Airport, Longyear, opened in 1975, allowing better facilities and connection with scheduled flights to the mainland. At the same time, Lufttransport established itself at Svalbard Airport.Holm: 129 During the summer of 1975, the Norwegian Polar Institute stationed two helicopters at Ny- √Ölesund Airport to support their expeditions.Hanoa: 200 During the late 1970s there was little winter activity in Ny-√Ölesund, but the air strip was kept operational for the few groups of researchers who did visit.Hanoa: 201 A radio line repeater was installed at Kongsvegpasset in 1980, resulting in Ny-√Ölesund receiving a telephone connection. A radio beacon was subsequently installed at the airport.Hanoa: 203 During the 1980s, the services were gradually taken over by Lufttransport, who used both small aircraft and helicopters. These gradually became more regular and became de facto scheduled services every fortnight. Lufttransport replaced the helicopter service with a two-engine five-seat aircraft in 1989, which cut the cost of transport significantly.Hanoa: 216 In 1993, Wider√∏e established itself at Svalbard Airport and flew services to Ny-√Ölesund, but this only lasted the one season. In 1996, Lufttransport and Kings Bay made an agreement that the airline would fly once per week during the winter and up to five times per week during the summer. The airline would use a Dornier Do 228, which was also used for flights from Longyearbyen to Svea Airport for Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani.Holm: 130 Facilities A Lufttransport Dornier Do 228 landing at the airport Ny-√Ölesund Airport, Hamnerabben, is located at Hamnerabben, west of the main settlement of Ny-√Ölesund. It consists of a single long and wide gravel runway. It is located at elevation and aligned 12/30. The airport has a single apron. The airport has aerodrome flight information service but lacks terminal and hangar facilities. Airlines and destinations The only airline to provide service to and from Hamnerabben is Lufttransport, which operates 16-seat Dornier Do 228 aircraft to Svalbard Airport, Longyear. The airline provides two flights per week during the winter and four flights per week during the summer. All departures are charter flights organized by Kings Bay and tickets are only available through the company. Occasional ad hoc charter flights are also sometimes operated. At Longyearbyen, connections are provided onwards to Troms√∏ Airport and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.

These dams are used for power generation, flood control, navigation and recreation. These dams have local and regional environmental impacts on the river and the Chesapeake Bay, both positive and negative.  Environmental impacts  :And by making it more Susquehanna specific. The dams have a positive impact on the environment. They slow water, trapping silt and pollutants. Conowingo Dam is credited with preventing much of the silt from Pennsylvania from reaching the Chesapeake Bay. The dam spillways can add oxygen to the water. The down stream side of dams is favored by aquatic birds, possibly because the fish that pass through the dam are a bit stunned. Conowingo Dam is noted for its bald eagles. Hydroelectric power is considered an environmentally friendly method of power generation. The dams also make a negative impact on the environment. They raise the water level, altering the riparian environment. The upstream pools can become environmentally unsound below the surface, especially during summer. They block migratory fish, such as the American shad. The dams from York Haven down to the Chesapeake all have fish ladders or lifts to mitigate this.  Human impacts  :And by making it more Susquehanna specific. The dams have both a positive and negative impact on human society, outside of the environmental impacts above. River dams have long been associated with power generation. In the past dams powered mills directly. Today dams are used both for direct hydroelectric generation and to form pools for cooling other forms of generation. Dams create navigable stretches of river where they may have been unnavigable before. The first dams at Sunbury, Pennsylvania were to support year round ferry crossings. The creation of dams does have negative impacts. Communities on the river edge are displaced, such as Conowingo, Bald Friar, and Glen Cove, Maryland in 1928. Longitudinal river navigation is impeded. Although the historic Susquehanna was very difficult to navigate most of the year. Timber rafts could come down in the spring high water, but very few boats went up the river, before the canals were built. The Conowingo Dam is located near \\"Smith's Falls\\", where John Smith had to turn back while exploring the region in the early 17th century due to the impassable rapids.

The Guard of the first train was fatally injured in the collision. Events A Class 156 Super- Sprinter formed the 1626 Carlisle to Leeds via Settle service (headcode 2H88). It could only proceed as far as Ribblehead railway station, about 12 miles north of Settle, as the lines from Ribblehead to Settle were blocked by flooding; so it had to return to Carlisle. The driver changed cabs as the train was now heading northbound instead of southbound, and proceeded back over the Ribblehead Viaduct, and on to Aisgill Summit, the highest point on the line at above sea level. It was dark and raining heavily. Near Aisgill Summit itself the train hit a landslide. It derailed across both tracks, and the cabin lights went off. The injured driver managed to radio Crewe Control Room. The conductor escorted passengers into the rear unit, which was across the northbound track. He then returned to see the driver who was still in the cab. Either the conductor or the driver (it is not known which) changed the lights from white to red to warn oncoming trains of the obstruction but no other action was taken. Meanwhile, another Super-Sprinter train forming the 1745 Carlisle to Leeds service (headcode 2H92) had set off from Kirkby Stephen railway station around five miles to the north. About a quarter of a mile before the derailed train, the driver saw its red lights and made an emergency brake application, but there was no chance of stopping before impacting the derailment. The collision killed the conductor of the derailed train, and seriously hurt several passengers: 30 people on the trains suffered some kind of injury. The signalman at Settle Junction signal box was informed of the accident by the conductor of the 2H92 service and the emergency services were then alerted. Inquiry The official inquiry concluded that the conductor of 2H88 failed in his paramount duty to protect his train in the event of an incident by laying down detonators and displaying a red flag one mile from the obstruction. The time between the initial derailment and the subsequent collision was about six or seven minutes which would have allowed a much greater warning time to be given to the second train, and might have prevented the collision or at least reduced its impact. The inquiry noted that a transcript of the call made from the driver of the train that hit the landslide. In his communications with the control centre at Crewe, the call ended with a control saying \\"we will take care of all of that, driver.\\" This may have given the false impression that the southbound service that hit the first stricken service, would be warned appropriately and so the guard set about tending to the needs of his passengers. The chairman of the inquiry, Mr E N Clarke, said that protecting the train should have been the priority of the guard. Further recommendations were made concerning the inadequate communications between Railtrack Control Rooms and inefficient use of the National Radio Network. A \\"group call\\" to all trains in the vicinity of the incident could have been made by the Control Room and might have alerted the second train to the obstruction in time to prevent the collision. Other incidents In 1999 a similar incident occurred on the Settle and Carlisle line at Crosby Garrett, north of Kirkby Stephen, where a landslide caused a Carlisle-bound Sprinter to derail. The driver set off a warning horn mounted on the track, and although a southbound goods train hit the Sprinter, nobody was seriously hurt. This took place during bad weather conditions similar to the 1995 incident.

It encompasses a variety of reproductive conditions, their prevention and assessment, as well as their subsequent treatment and prognosis. Reproductive medicine has allowed the development of artificial reproductive techniques (ARTs) which have allowed advances in overcoming human infertility, as well as being used in agriculture and in wildlife conservation. Some examples of ARTs include IVF, artificial insemination (AI) and embryo transfer, as well as genome resource banking. Aristotle  History  The study of reproductive medicine is thought to date back to Aristotle, where he came up with the ‚ÄúHaematogenous Reproduction Theory‚Äù. However, evidence-based reproductive medicine is traceable back to the 1970s. Since then, there have been many milestones for reproductive medicine, including the birth of Louise Brown, the first baby to be conceived through IVF in 1978. Despite this, it wasn't until 1989 that it became a clinical discipline thanks to the work of Iain Chalmers in developing the systematic review and the Cochrane collection. Scope Reproductive medicine addresses issues of sexual education, puberty, family planning, birth control, infertility, reproductive system disease (including sexually transmitted diseases) and sexual dysfunction. In women, reproductive medicine also covers menstruation, ovulation, pregnancy and menopause, as well as gynecologic disorders that affect fertility. The field cooperates with and overlaps mainly with reproductive endocrinology and infertility, sexual medicine and andrology, but also to some degree with gynecology, obstetrics, urology, genitourinary medicine, medical endocrinology, pediatric endocrinology, genetics, and psychiatry.  Conditions  Reproductive medicine deals with prevention, diagnosis and management of the following conditions. This section will give examples of a number of common conditions affecting the Human Reproductive system. = Infectious Diseases = Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) are infections that affect the Reproductive Tract. There are three types of RTIs: Endogenous RTIs, Iatrogenic RTIs and Sexually Transmitted Infections. Endogenous RTIs are caused by an overgrowth of bacteria which is normally present. An example of an endogenous RTI is Bacterial Vaginosis. Iatrogenic RTIs are infections contracted as a result of a medical procedure. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are infections spread by sexual activity, usually by vaginal intercourse, anal sex or oral sex. Many STIs are curable; however, some STIs such as HIV are incurable. STIs can be bacterial, viral or fungal and affect both men and women. Some examples of STIs are listed below:Scott, G.R. (2014).

Female assessment starts with a full medical history (anamnesis) which provides details of the woman's general health, sexual history and relevant family history. A physical examination will also take place to identify abnormalities such as hirsutism, abdominal masses, infection, cysts or fibroids. A blood test can inform the clinician of the endocrine status of the patient. Progesterone levels are measured to check for ovulation, and other ovulatory hormones can also be measured. Imaging techniques such as pelvic ultrasounds can also be used to assess the internal anatomy. Male assessment also starts with a history and physical examination to look for any visible abnormalities. Investigations of semen samples also take place to assess the volume, motility and number of sperm, as well as identifying infections. Once the investigations are complete, treatment of identified conditions can occur. For fertility issues, this may involve assisted reproductive technology (ART) such as in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or fertility medication. There are surgical methods that can be used as treatment however these are now performed less frequently due to the increasing success of the less invasive techniques. Treatment is also required for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These can take the form of antibiotics for bacterial infections such as chlamydia or highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) for the HIV virus. Education and training Specialists in reproductive medicine usually undergo training in obstetrics and gynecology followed by training in reproductive endocrinology and infertility, or in urology followed by training in andrology. For reproductive medicine specialists in contraception, other methods of training are possible. Specialists tend to be organized in specialty organizations such as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE). Anamnesis The anamnesis or medical history taking of issues related to reproductive or sexual medicine may be inhibited by a person's reluctance to disclose intimate or uncomfortable information. Even if such an issue is on the person's mind, he or she often doesn't start talking about such an issue without the physician initiating the subject by a specific question about sexual or reproductive health. Some familiarity with the doctor generally makes it easier for person to talk about intimate issues such as sexual subjects, but for some people, a very high degree of familiarity may make the person reluctant to reveal such intimate issues. When visiting a health provider about sexual issues, having both partners of a couple present is often necessary, and is typically a good thing, but may also prevent the disclosure of certain subjects, and, according to one report, increases the stress level.'The Cringe Report' By Susan Quilliam. Posted: 06/28/2011; J Fam Plann Reprod Health Care. 2011;37(2):110-112.  Ethical and medicolegal issues  There are many ethical and legal issues surrounding reproductive medicine. In the UK the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HEFA) regulates many aspects of reproductive medicine in the UK, including IVF, Artificial Insemination, storage of reproductive tissue and research in this field. HEFA was established due to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (1990). This act was reviewed and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (2008) was passed through parliament as an update to the 1990 act. For therapies such as IVF, many countries have strict guidelines. In the UK, referrals are only given to women under 40 who have either undergone 12 cycles of artificial insemination, or have tried and failed to conceive for 2 years. While NICE recommends NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) to provide 3 NHS funded cycles of IVF, many only offer 1 cycle, with some only offering IVF in exceptional circumstances on the NHS. If an individual does not meet the criteria or has gone through the maximum number of NHS-funded cycles, the individual will have to pay for private treatment Many reproductive technologies are seen to have ethical problems, including IVF, mitochondrial replacement therapy, germline modification, preimplantation genetic diagnosis. There are many groups around the world which oppose to ARTs, including religious groups and pro-life charities such as LIFE. References Literature Lipshultz LI, Khera M, Atwal DT.

Vane was likely born in the Kingdom of England around 1680. One of his first pirate ventures was under the leadership of Henry Jennings, during Jennings' attack on the salvage camp for the wrecked Spanish 1715 Treasure Fleet off the coast of Florida. By 1717, Vane was commanding his own vessels and was one of the leaders of the Republic of Pirates in Nassau. In 1718 Vane was captured but agreed to stop his criminal actions and accepted a King's Pardon; however just months later he and his men, including Edward England and Jack Rackham, returned to piracy. Unlike some other notable pirate captains of the age like Benjamin Hornigold and Samuel Bellamy, Vane was known for his cruelty, often beating, torturing and killing sailors from ships he captured. In February 1719, Vane was caught in a storm in the Bay Islands and was marooned on an uncharted island. Upon being discovered by a passing British ship, he was arrested and brought to Port Royal where he was eventually tried and hanged in March 1721. Pirate career Little is known of Vane's early life. He lived in Port Royal before becoming a pirate, but he was most likely not born there. Vane worked with Henry Jennings during Jennings' attack on the salvage camp for the wrecked Spanish 1715 Treasure Fleet. Vane first operated as an independent captain in the summer of 1717. By the winter of that year he was one of the leaders of the pirates operating out of Nassau. When word reached the pirates that King George I of Great Britain had extended an offer of pardon to all pirates who wished to surrender, Vane led the pirates who opposed taking the pardon, which included many with Jacobite leanings. On 23 February 1718, Captain Vincent Pearse arrived at Nassau in , in an attempt to get the pirates on the island to surrender. Vane was captured along with his sloop, the Lark. Benjamin Hornigold, Thomas Nichols, and others urged Pearse to release Vane as a show of good faith, which he did; Vane afterwards took the King's pardon. But on 21 March, Vane and his men (including Edward England and Calico Jack Rackham) turned pirate again, capturing a Jamaican sloop. Vane sailed back to Nassau and harassed Pearse repeatedly, trading their sloop for the Lark. Vane left Nassau on 4 April; four days later Pearse left with HMS Phoenix, and Nassau was again controlled by the pirates. After leaving Nassau, Vane raided ships around the Bahamas. He gained a reputation for cruelty; he and his crew would often beat or torture captured sailors to force them to surrender their valuables. Around this time Vane's crew renamed the Lark, calling it the Ranger. Vane cruised again in May and June, capturing, among other ships, a twenty-gun French ship that became Vane's new flagship. Vane was back at Nassau on 22 July 1718 when Woodes Rogers reached Nassau to take office as the new governor. Rogers' ships trapped Vane in the harbor; Vane's ship was too large to pass one of the harbor's two entrances, and the other was blocked by Rogers' fleet. That night, Vane turned the French ship into a fireship, setting it on fire and sailing it towards Rogers' ships. The fireship failed to damage any of Rogers' fleet except one, but the ships were forced to pull away, unblocking the channel. Vane commandeered a small 24 gun sloop, the Katherine, and escaped out the smaller entrance as Rogers' ships returned. Vane took ships off the Bahamas in July, working with Charles Yeats, the original captain of the Katherine. A brigantine that Vane captured became his new flagship. In August he sailed to Charleston and took eight ships there. After seizing a slave ship, he put the slaves aboard Yeats' ship; Yeats sailed off with the slaves and surrendered to the governor of South Carolina in exchange for a pardon. The merchants of Charleston outfitted two sloops to hunt Vane, under the command of William Rhett. Rhett failed to find Vane, but his ships located and captured the pirate Stede Bonnet. Charles Vane, Defying the Governor, from the Pirates of the Spanish Main series (N19) for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes MET DP835025 In August Vane careened his ship near Abaco, where his accomplice Nicholas Woodall smuggled him supplies and ammunition. Hornigold had turned pirate-hunter along with his associate John Cockram and followed Vane, who escaped; Hornigold and Cockram instead captured Woodall, who was imprisoned by Rogers. Vane returned to Nassau in September to marry, threatening to retake the city. In October Vane sailed to Ocracoke Inlet, and met with Blackbeard, perhaps attempting to convince Blackbeard to join forces with him; the two crews celebrated for several days, but split up afterwards. In October Vane raided Eleuthera, carrying away liquor and livestock. On 23 November, Vane spotted a large frigate, but when he hoisted the Jolly Roger the frigate replied by raising a French naval ensign and opening fire. Vane's brigantine and sloop were outgunned, and he ordered a retreat. Vane's crew saw this as an act of cowardice. He was voted out of command in favor of Calico Jack Rackham. Vane and sixteen others who supported him, including his first mate Robert Deal, were put on the sloop. Vane sailed to the Bay Islands, capturing sloops along the way, one of which Deal took command of. In February 1719, Vane and Deal were caught in a hurricane and separated; Vane was wrecked on an uninhabited island. When English ships arrived to collect water near the island, Vane tried to join one of the crews under a false name. He was recognized by an old acquaintance, and arrested. Vane was taken to Spanish Town, Jamaica and held in prison for some time. On 22 March 1721, he was tried for piracy and found guilty. Vane learned that Deal had been tried, convicted, and hanged some time earlier. Vane was sentenced to death, and on 29 March he was hanged at Gallows Point in Port Royal. His corpse was hung in chains at Gun Cay. In popular culture W. Morgan Sheppard portrayed Vane in the 1999 family film Treasure of Pirate's Point. Vane also appears as a secondary character in the 2013 video game Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, in which he was voiced by Ralph Ineson. Zach McGowan portrayed Charles Vane in the 2014 Starz television show Black Sails.

He was Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at the University of Oxford from 1982 to 2006, and Professor of Christian Ethics and Practical Theology at the University of Edinburgh from 2006 to 2013. Early life and education O'Donovan was born on 28 June 1945. He is the son of Joan Knape and Michael Francis O'Donovan (1906‚Äì1966), better known as Frank O'Connor, eminent Irish writer of short stories and memoirs. His doctoral thesis on the problem of self-love in Augustine of Hippo was completed under both Henry Chadwick at Oxford and Paul Ramsey at Princeton. Career =Ordained ministry= O'Donovan was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 1972 and as a priest in 1973. A scholar-priest, he has never undertaken parish ministry. He was a Canon Residentiary of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford from 1982 to 2006. He served on the General Synod of the Church of England from 2005 to 2006. Since November 2015, he has been a Canon Provincial (of the Province of York) and the Provincial Theologian at York Minster. He has also held permission to officiate in the Diocese of York since 2015. O'Donovan has been active in ecumenical dialogue. He was part of the Anglican‚ÄìOrthodox Joint Doctrinal Discussions from 1982 to 1984, and a member of the Anglican‚ÄìRoman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) from 1985 to 1990. =Academic career= O'Donovan taught at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford (1972‚Äì1977), and at Wycliffe College, Toronto (1977‚Äì1982). He was Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology and Canon of Christ Church at the University of Oxford (1982‚Äì2006). He then held the post of Professor of Christian Ethics and Practical Theology at the School of Divinity, New College, Edinburgh (2006‚Äì2013), and was an associate director of the Centre for Theology and Public Issues. He is a past President of the Society for the Study of Christian Ethics. In 2001 he delivered the Stob Lectures at Calvin Theological Seminary. In 2007 he delivered the New College Lectures at New College, University of New South Wales. O'Donovan cites these New College Lectures as his first opportunity to explore the ideas that would become his \\"Ethics as Theology\\" trilogy of books. In 2008 he delivered a lecture at Princeton Theological Seminary upon receiving the Abraham Kuyper Prize for Excellence in Reformed Theology and Public Life. O'Donovan has held distinguished visiting lectureships in the universities of Durham and Cambridge, the Gregorian University in Rome, McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, the University of Hong Kong, and Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California. Personal life In 1978 he married Joan Lockwood O'Donovan. They have jointly authored two books on the history of Christian political thought, and have two sons, Matthew and Paul. Honours He has been a Fellow of the British Academy since 2000 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh since 2009. Major works Resurrection and Moral Order (1986). In this work, O'Donovan argues for the centrality of bodily resurrection of Christ in Christian Ethics. Through resurrection God vindicates the original order of creation and renews it to complete his ultimate goal for redeemed universe. He further defends the objectivity of Christian moral claims from the challenge of \\"anti- foundationalism\\" which O'Donovan tends to refer to as \\"historicism\\". O'Donovan distinguishes himself from Alasdair MacIntyre by opposing neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics and by arguing that MacIntyre's adoption of a more historical perspective cannot avoid ethical relativism. O'Donovan's alternative is to ground an ethic of obedience in a natural moral order. Importantly, however, a \\"true understanding\\" of this moral order can only be achieved \\"in Christ\\". * The Desire of the Nations (1996). * The Ways of Judgment (2005). *Ethics as Theology trilogy (2013-2017). In this trilogy of books O'Donovan explores what implications the gift of the Spirit may have for the \\"forceful moral objectivism\\" of his Resurrection and Moral Order.

Calmodulin (CaM), a Calcium-binding protein, that mediates Ca2+ signaling is involved in all types of cellular mechanisms, including metabolism, synaptic plasticity, nerve growth, smooth muscle contraction, etc. Calmodulin allows for a number of proteins to aid in the progression of these pathways using their interactions with CaM in its Ca2+ bound conformation (Ca2+ -CaM) or as its Ca2+ -free state (ApoCaM). Proteins each have their own unique affinities for CaM, that can be manipulated by the presence or absence of Ca2+ concentrations to allow for the desired release or binding to CaM that determines its ability to carry out its cellular function. Proteins that get activated upon binding to Ca2+ -CaM, include Myosin light- chain kinase, Phosphatase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II(CaMKs), etc. Proteins, like neurogranin (Ng) that plays a vital role in postsynaptic function, however, can only bind to the CaM in ApoCaM via their IQ-domain. Since these interactions are exceptionally specific, they can be regulated through Post-translational modification by enzymes like kinases and Phosphatase to affect their cellular functions. In the case of Ng, it's the synaptic function can be inhibited by the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of its IQ-domain that impedes its interaction with CaM. Cellular functions can be indirectly regulated by CaM, as it acts as a mediator for enzymes that require Ca2+ stimulation for activation. Studies have proven that calmodulin's affinity for Ca2+ increases when it is bound to a calmodulin-binding protein, which allows for it to take on its regulatory role for Ca2+-dependent reactions. Calmodulin, made up of 2 pairs of Ef-hand calcium binding domain 2 separated in different structural regions by an extended alpha helical region, that permits it to respond to the changes in the cytosolic concentration of the Ca2+ ions by taking on two distinct conformations, in the inactive Ca2+ unbound state and active Ca2+ bound state. Calmodulin binds to the targeted proteins via their short complementary peptide sequences, causing a ‚Äúinduced fit‚Äù conformational change that alters the calmodulin-binding proteins‚Äô activity as desired in response to the second messenger Ca2+ signals that arise due to changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. These second messenger Ca2+ signals are transduced and integrated to maintain a homeostatic balance of the Ca2+ ions.  GAP-43 Protein  Found in the nervous system, GAP-43 is a growth-associated protein (GAP) expressed in high levels during presynaptic developmental and regenerative axonal growth. As a major growth cone component, an increase in GAP-43 concentrations delays the process of axonal growth cones evolving into stable synaptic terminals. All GAP-43 proteins share a completely conserved amino acid sequence that contain a CaM binding domain and a serine residue that can be used to inhibit calmodulin binding upon phosphorylation of Protein kinase C (PKC). By possessing these calmodulin-binding properties, GAP-43 is able to respond to PKC activation and release free calmodulin in desired areas. When there are low levels of Ca2+ concentrations, GAP-43 is able to bind and stabilize the inactive Ca2+ -free state of calmodulin, this allows it to absorb and reversibly inactivate the CaM in the growth cones. This binding of the calmodulin to GAP-43 is allowed by the negatively charged CaM electrostatically interacting with the positively charged ‚Äúpocket‚Äù formed in the GAP-43 molecule itself.

It was created in 1962 by merging three blonde draught breeds of south-western France, the Blonde des Pyr√©n√©es, the Blonde de Quercy and the Garonnaise. Since about 1970 it has been selectively bred specifically for beef production. It is the third-most numerous beef breed of France, after the Charolais and the Limousin. It has been exported to many countries round the world.  History  The Blonde d'Aquitaine breed was created in 1962 by merging three blonde breeds of south- western France, the Blonde de Quercy, the Garonnaise and the Blonde des Pyr√©n√©es. All three were principally draught breeds. The Garonnaise had been numerous in Aquitaine ‚Äì 400,000 head were recorded in 1880; a herd-book was started in 1898. The Blonde des Pyr√©n√©es was itself an amalgam of several other breeds, including the B√©arnaise, the Race d'Urt, and the Basquiaise; its herd-book was started in 1920, the same year as that of the Blonde de Quercy. The Blonde d'Aquitaine includes almost all the traditional blonde cattle breeds of southern France, although remnant populations of a few of them have allowed them to be reconstituted. The moving force behind the creation of the breed was Rapha√´l Tr√©mouille, a veterinary surgeon and member of the lower chamber of the French parliament. From about 1970, concerted efforts were made to improve the beef production attributes of the breed. The Blonde d'Aquitaine is the third beef breed of France by numbers, after the Charolais and the Limousin. In 2013 there were about 560,000 head in more than 18,000 farms. The Blonde d'Aquitaine has been exported to many countries of the world, including all countries of the European Union. It is much used for cross-breeding in Oceania and in Eastern Europe, and has shown particular promise when crossed with zebuine cattle breeds in South America.  Characteristics  The Blonde d'Aquitaine is wheat- or cream-coloured, varying from a dark to very light fawn; the surround of the eyes and the area round the muzzle is paler. The skin is white, and the muzzle and mucous areas pale.  Use  The Blonde d'Aquitaine is raised exclusively for beef, whether purebred or cross-bred.

As of the census of 2010, there were 3,405 people, 1,337 households, and 873 families residing in the neighborhood. Description Mardi Gras celebrations, 2000. Sno-ball shop, Summer 2011 About a mile south of Lake Pontchartrain lies the neighborhood of Milneburg. Its residents consist of University teachers from the University of New Orleans, single-family residents and retirees. The area also has many churches, a police station, and also a high school nearby. The area around these sites is still sometimes referred to as Milneburg, but the term is more usually heard in reference to the historic place. The neighborhood now designated as \\"Milneburg\\" by the New Orleans Planning Commission is actually to the south and inland of the historic Milneburg. The boundaries according to local tradition can vary, with some saying Milneburg is located in the area bordered by the streets of St. Roch, Elysian Fields, Filmore and Mexico, while others groups state the area is much larger, going from Leon C. Simon to Filmore, and Elysian Fields to Franklin. The types of homes in the area vary but single-family dwellings are the most common. There were only a few shotgun doubles, a very popular style of housing in the city of New Orleans. The architectural styles of the homes would come under Louisiana Vernacular and Louisiana Victorian. Vernacular homes feature deep one and two story porches, high ceilings with columns, French doors with full- length windows and large shutters. Homes of this type are said to have either a Creole or Acadian influenced design. Victorian homes feature architectural details such as arches, large porches, and decorative millwork . Like the majority of New Orleans, the neighborhood experienced major flooding due to the failure of the Federal levee system during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

He rose to the rank of admiral in the navies of Venezuela and the old Republic of Colombia. Early career He was baptized as Phillipus Ludovicus Brion, son of the merchant Pierre Louis Brion and Marie Detrox, both from what is now Belgium. They arrived in Cura√ßao in 1777. In 1794 they sent their son to the Netherlands to complete his education. While he was there, he enlisted in the forces of the Batavian Republic to fight the British invasion of the northern Netherlands. He participated in the battles of Bergen (September 19, 1799) and Castricum (October 16, 1799). He was taken prisoner by the British but freed after a short time in the prisoner exchange under the Convention of Alkmaar. On his return to Cura√ßao he took an active part in the revolutionary movement on the island, in September 1800. Shortly after his return the island was occupied by the British. He escaped from the British authorities, fleeing to the United States. There he studied naval science and business. He returned to his native island in 1803 (since recovered by the Batavian Republic), dedicating himself to business. From 1803 to 1806 he led various actions to prevent the British reoccupation of the island. Nevertheless, the British occupied the island again in 1807, and Bri√≥n went into exile on the Danish island of Saint Thomas. From here he continued to run his business and maritime interests. In the war for Venezuelan independence In 1813 Brion took up the cause of Venezuelan independence and a year later Sim√≥n Bol√≠var made him captain of a frigate. In 1815 he went to England, where he acquired the 24-gun corvet Dardo, with which he intended to aid the rebels of Cartagena de Indias. To bring aid to the revolutionists, he had sailed from London for Cartagena at his own expense, with 14,000 stand of arms and a great quantity of military stores. Arriving too late to be useful in that quarter, he re- embarked for Les Cayes, Haiti, whither many emigrant patriots had repaired after the surrender of Cartagena. Battle of Los Frailes Bol√≠var, meanwhile, had also departed from Kingston to Port-au-Prince, where, on his promise of emancipating the slaves, Alexandre P√©tion, the president of Haiti, offered him large supplies for a new expedition against the Spaniards in Venezuela. At Les Cayes he met Brion and the other emigrants, and in a general meeting proposed himself as the chief of the new expedition, on the condition of uniting the civil and military power in his person until the assembling of a general congress. The majority accepting his terms, the expedition sailed April 16, 1816 to the coast of Venezuela, with him as its commander and Brion as its captain. On May 2, 1816 he won his first victory over Spanish warships, in the Battle of Los Frailes. On the day of the victory, Brion was named admiral by Bol√≠var. At Margarita Island the former succeeded in winning over Juan Bautista Arismendi, the commander of the island, in which he had reduced the Spaniards to the single spot of Pampatar. On Bol√≠var's formal promise to convoke a national congress at Venezuela, as soon as he should be master of the country, Arismendi summoned a junta in the cathedral of La Villa del Norte, and publicly proclaimed him the commander-in-chief of the republics of Venezuela and New Granada. On May 31, 1816, Bol√≠var and Brion landed at Carupano, but did not dare prevent generals Santiago Marino and Manuel Piar from separating from him, and carrying on a war against Cumana under their own auspices. Weakened by this separation, he set sail, on Brion's advice, for Ocumare de la Costa, where he arrived July 3, 1816, with 13 vessels, of which 7 only were armed. His army mustered but 650 men, swelled, by the enrolment of negroes whose emancipation he had proclaimed, to about 800. On his advance in the direction of Valencia he met, not far from Ocumare, the Spanish general Morales at the head of about 200 soldiers and 100 militia men. The skirmishers of Morales having dispersed his advanced guard, he lost, as an eyewitness records, On Brion's rebukes and admonitions, Bol√≠var again joined the other commanders on the coast of Cumana, but being harshly received, and threatened by Piar with trial before a court-martial as a deserter and a coward, he quickly retraced his steps to Les Cayes. After months of exertion, Brion at length succeeded in persuading a majority of the Venezuelan military chiefs, who felt the want of at least a nominal centre, to recall Bol√≠var as their general-in-chief, upon the express condition that he should assemble a congress, and not meddle with the civil administration. December 31, 1816, he arrived at Barcelona with the arms, munitions of war, and provisions supplied by President P√©tion. Joined on January 2, 1817, by Arismendi, Brion proclaimed on the 4th martial law and the union of all powers in his single person; but 5 days later, when Arismendi had fallen into an ambush laid by the Spaniards, the dictator fled to Barcelona. The troops rallied at the latter place, whither Brion sent him also guns and reinforcements, so that he soon mustered a new corps of 1,100 men. On April 5, the Spaniards took possession of the town of Barcelona, and the patriot troops retreated toward the charity-house, a building isolated from Barcelona, and entrenched on Bol√≠var's order, but unfit to shelter a garrison of 1,000 men from a serious attack. He left the post in the night of April 5, informing Colonel Freites, to whom he transferred his command, that he was going in search of more troops, and would soon return. Trusting this promise, Freites declined the offer of a capitulation, and, after the assault, was slaughtered with the whole garrison by the Spaniards. General Manuel Piar, a mulatto native of Cura√ßao, conceived and executed the conquest of Guayana Province with Admiral Brion supporting that enterprise with his gun-boats. In January 1817 Bri√≥n established the Admiralty and the Marine Corps. On August 3, 1817 he sailed up the Orinoco River with a squadron, fighting the Battle of Cabri√°n. In this battle he captured 14 of the 28 Spanish ships and took 1,500 prisoners. He liberated Guayana on November 5, 1817, and was named president of the Council of Government. On July 20, the whole of the provinces being evacuated by the Spaniards, Piar, Brion, Zea, Marino, Arismendi, and others, assembled a provincial congress at Angostura, and put at the head of the executive a triumvirate, of which Brion, hating Piar and deeply interested in Bol√≠var, in whose success he had invested his large private fortune, contrived that the latter should be appointed a member, notwithstanding his absence. Portrait of Luis Bri√≥n, in Papel Peri√≥dico Ilustrado (1885). Upon these tidings Bol√≠var left his retreat for Angostura, where, emboldened by Brion, he dissolved the congress and the triumvirate, to replace them by a \\"supreme council of the nation\\", with himself as the chief, Brion and Francisco Antonio Zea as the directors, the former of the military, the latter of the political section. However, Piar, the conqueror of Guiana, who once before had threatened to try him before a court-martial as a deserter, was not sparing of his sarcasms against the \\"Napoleon of the retreat\\", and Bol√≠var consequently accepted a plan for getting rid of him. On the false accusation of having conspired against the whites, plotted against Bol√≠var's life, and aspired to the supreme power, Piar was arraigned before a war council under the presidency of Brion, convicted, condemned to death, and shot, October 16, 1817. His death struck Marino with terror. Fully aware of loss when deprived of Piar, he, in an abject letter, publicly calumniated his murdered friend, deprecated his own attempts at rivalry with the liberator, and threw himself upon Bol√≠var's magnanimity. In 1819 Bri√≥n was again at Margarita, where he organized an expedition of 22 ships to attack the coast of New Granada, together with the land forces of colonel Mariano Montilla. They captured ports and the mouths of the Magdalena River, as well as the cities of Barranquilla and Santa Marta. However, differences with Montilla over how to conduct the operation led Bri√≥n to withdraw the fleet to Maracaibo in May 1821. Death Bri√≥n suffered from tuberculosis, and because of the progression of the disease, he decided to return to his native island. He died there in 1821, the day after his arrival. He was buried in the family estate with honors appropriate to his rank. Later his remains were reinterred in the National Pantheon of Venezuela on April 10, 1882.

The constitution was approved in a referendum held on May 31, 2001 when 97% of the voters voted in its favour. Its re- published version consists of a Preamble (Arar) and five main chapters (Qaybo) each of which is sub-divided into Parts (Xubno). There is now a total of 130 Articles (Qodobo) as compared to the previous 156 Articles. History Somaliland has had other constitutional documents of historical importance which range from the international treaties signed by the various Somaliland communities with the British government, and the various constitutional arrangements prior to independence in 1960 to the Declaration of Re-assertion of Sovereignty in 1991 (in Burao) at one of the earliest grand conferences of the Somaliland communities. Although the Republic of Somaliland was independent for a short period in June 1960, it later unified with Trust Territory of Somalia to form the Somali Republic. During that short period no comprehensive constitution was adopted. The State of Somaliland had its own Constitution which was drafted in early 1960, and was briefly in place. Presidential decree ratifying the Somaliland constitution by Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal The first main Constitutional document of the independent Somaliland was the National Charter (Axdi Qaran), which was signed by the Conference of the Somaliland Communities in 1993 in Borama. This was followed by the first Somaliland constitution, which was adopted at the conference of the Somaliland Communities in Hargeisa in February 1997. Under article 151, the constitution shall be implemented for a period of three years from its approval in February 1997 and shall come into force fully once a referendum has been held. There was a provision for this interim period to be increased by the two Houses of Parliament, and in early 2000, the two Houses voted that the period be increased by one year. This was primarily to give more time for the completion of the revision of the constitution (before its submission to the nation at a Referendum) and for putting in place the laws and mechanisms for changing the current ‚Äúrepresentative‚Äù democracy in Somaliland to a popular democracy based on the direct elections of the President of Somaliland and the Parliament of Somaliland. Although initially the Somaliland government proposed fairly extensive amendments to the constitution in 1999, the final revised constitution is not very different from the last one and the reduction of the number of articles from 156 to 130 has been largely achieved by the amalgamation of some articles, rather than by extensive repeals. Unlike the earlier draft proposals, the parts of the constitution relating to directive principles and to human rights have all been retained. On the whole, the revisions tidied up the constitution and no fundamental changes have been made.

Name Khangai has become a generally used term by Mongolians to describe the entire lush forest-steppe area to the north as opposed to the southern desert, which is called Govi (Gobi). The intermediary steppe area is called Kheer or Tal. The word Khangai is composed of the verb \\"khanga-\\" which means \\"provide, supply with necessities\\" and the Mongolian nominalizing suffix \\"-ai\\". The word Khan (King) is also a possible root, probably even related to the verb \\"khanga-\\". Therefore, Khangai is usually interpreted as provident lord, munificent king, generous gracious lord or bountiful king. The ancient name denotes the sacredness of the mountain and the special place it holds in the hearts of those who depend on it. A similar Mongolian word for sacred mountains is Khairkhan which means loving king (for example Asralt Khairkhan, a particularly intimate name meaning caring loving king). Its forbidden to say the name of a Khairkhan when the mountain is in view. If the mountain is in view, it should simply be called Khairkhan, not its full name. This strict custom applies in all regions of Mongolia. Any mountain or hill that is pleasing to the sight or in any other way pleasant is praised with the words \\"that is indeed a special Khairkhan\\" or \\"what a majestic Khairkhan!\\" etc. Any area of the mountainous forest-steppe region understood alone or along with all that it contains (rivers, springs, plants, animals) may be praised with the words \\"that is indeed a great Khangai\\" or \\"there is no denying that that is a unique Khangai!\\" etc. Two provinces of Mongolia are named after the Khangai mountains: Arkhangai (Northern Khangai) and Ovorkhangai (Southern Khangai). The mild climate area where the two provinces meet (eastern Khangai) is known as the cradle of Mongolian and nomadic civilization. The plains at the foot of the eastern Khangai host the Orkhon Valley World Heritage Site. The Xiongnu (209BC - 93AD) capital Luut Khot (Lungcheng), the Xianbei (93AD -234 AD) capital Ordo and the Rouran (330-555) capital Moomt (Mume) are said to have been located there. Later empires also established their capitals there, for example the Uyghur Empire (745-840) built their capital Ordu-Baliq in the region. Features Tsetserleg, capital of Arkhangai Province. Khorgo extinct volcano in the northern Khangai Mountains The tallest mountain is the Otgontenger (lit. \\"youngest sky\\"), the height of which is given as 3,905, 4,021, and 4,031 m depending on the source. It is one of the four paramount sacred mountains of Mongolia. State ceremonies are held there. Suvraga Khairkhan (Stupa Khairkhan, height 3,117m) is another sacred mountain to the east of Tsetserleg. Taryatu- Chulutu is an extinct volcanic field on the northern slopes of the Khangai Mountains. The mountains feed the rivers Orkhon, Selenge, Ider, Zavkhan and the lakes Orog and B√∂√∂n tsagaan. In the west the Khangai mountains transition into the Great Lakes Depression. The Khangai mountain region is known for its mild microclimates in certain areas. Winters there are not as harsh as in other parts of the country.

Claude Ledoux, photograph by Nao Momitani For many years now, the composer has explored the idea of \\"musical crossing borders\\" as he attempts to reflect our fragmented world in his musical processes. As a result, his works has been marked by interactions between contemporary sounds and popular musics, non-European idioms and technology. His recent works, accordingly, demonstrate this interest in the \\"cultural porosity\\" in which emotion arises from geographical and historical encounters, linking spirituality to the most sensual aspects of our material existence. Biography - early years Passionated by science and art, Ledoux began at 17 y.o. his studies in painting and graphic Art at the Fine Arts School, coupled with music at the Conservatoire de Li√®ge. There, he met Jean- Louis Robert, Philippe Boesmans, Frederic Rzewski, Henri Pousseur and decided for a musical career. He also carried out research into electronic music at the CRFMW studio (today Centre Pousseur) where he met Tristan Murail at the occasion of seminars. Afterwards, Ledoux pursued his education abroad, notably in Hungary (at B√©la Bart√≥k seminar), in Italy (in Bolzano and Venice) where he participated in a seminar by Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, and finally in Paris where he lived for few years on the occasion of IRCAM courses. At the same time, he studied composition with Iannis Xenakis at the University of Paris I. Competitions won As a composer he won several competitions (including Lille, Paris and Lausanne). In 2003 he received the Musical Prize from the Civitella Ranieri Foundation of New York for his recent works. Afterwards, his music has been performed in many towns in Europe - For instance : Brussels [Ars Musica], Liege [Royal Philharmonic of Liege], Paris [Radio-France, Pr√©sences, L‚ÄôItin√©raire, Intercontemporain...], Strasbourg [Musica], Berlin [WDR, Philharmonie]), Turkey [Ankara Radio Symphony orchestra), in Ukraine and Russia, more recently at the ISCM Ljublijana (at the orchestral opening concert 2015 with the Slovenian Radio Orchestra]. He has also performed in North America (with the Colorado Symphony orchestra and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra) and Asia (Vietnam, Japan). Latterly, Claude Ledoux has been composer in residence at the Ensemble Musiques Nouvelles (Belgium: 1998-2000), subsequently at the Castello of Umbria (Italy: 2003), the Brussels Bozar (2008-2009), Kitara Hall (Japan: 2009), and in Ars Musica (Brussels: 2012). Asian researches Due to his passion for Asian sounds, he travelled in several eastern countries in order to undertake researches and to learn the traditional art of music. In 1992, he first went through India where he learned traditional musics from the Himalayan slopes to the Rajasthan desert. In 1996, he received a grant from the SPES Foundation to pursue his studies about oriental music in Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia. Afterwards, he travelled many times in Japan (from 2004 until now) where he went deeper into the knowledge of traditional musical practices and instruments of that country which counts as one of the most important for the composer. More recently he made also researches in China. Recent activities In 2009, Claude Ledoux composed the compulsory work for the semi-final of the Queen Elisabeth Competition. Later, in 2012, he served as Artistic Director of the Ars Musica Festival. in that framework, he composed \\"Ayl\\" for Clarinet and orchestra, based on an Armenian traditional tune. Afterwards, he wrote an important number of works with an Eastern dimension over recent years : \\"Crossing Edges\\" for erhu and orchestra, \\"Echoes of Crossing Edges\\" for the Shanghai Sinfonietta, and \\"Eurydice effac√©e\\", commissioned by the Muromachi Ensemble (Tokyo). In 2016 he composed \\"A Butterfly's Dream\\" - based on the Chinese Zhuangzi (book) - the compulsory concerto for the Final of the Queen Elisabeth Competition, piano. In addition to composing instrumental works, 2016 sees him continue this journey, with new pieces for orchestra (including a Shakuhachi concerto for the famous Reison Kuroda) as well as a vocal work that will be premiered in Japan in the context of the 150th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Japan and Belgium. Claude Ledoux earned a Master in \\"Art and Sciences of Music\\" (musicology and communication) from the University of Li√®ge. Artistic Director (and founding member) of LAPS, a new ensemble that combines laptops with acoustic instruments, the composer has also written numerous articles on composition, analysis and contemporary music. Nowadays, apart from composition, he works as a musical journalist as well as a Musical Analysis professor at the CNSMDP - Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur de Musique de Paris (France) and Composition professor at Arts2 - Visual/Music Art School, Music Conservatory of Mons (Belgium). He also taught these subjects at the Universities of S√£o Paulo and Campinas (Brazil: 2008-09) and at the Shanghai Conservatory (China: 2014-15).

Cornish fishermen did not believe in landing fish on a Sunday, so other fleets exploited their opportunity. Locals retaliated by seizing non-Cornish vessels and throwing their catch overboard. This led to three days of rioting, quelled only by the intervention of a naval destroyer.  Background  In the late 19th century the fishing port of Newlyn was home to one of the UK's largest fishing fleets, and was also the regular landing port for many other fishing vessels operating off the Cornish coast. At the time Newlyn was also the home to as many as five Methodist and Non-Conformist religious groups, whose congregations included the local fishermen, most of whom practised a ban on fish being landed on the Sabbath. The non-Cornish fishing crews, largely from Lowestoft and northern English ports, did not hold the same opinions about Sabbath observation, and would frequently land fish on a Sunday attracting higher prices for their fish than those sold on a weekday.The Sunderland Echo; Wednesday 20 May 1896  Early clashes  The riots began in the early morning of Monday 18 May when a group of up to 40 Newlyn fishermen, supported by a mob of around 1,000 others, boarded the boats of \\"East\\" (of Cornwall) fishermen moored in Newlyn Harbour and destroyed their catches. By mid-morning some 16 boats had been seized and approximately 100,000 mackerel thrown overboard.Hutchins. History of Cornwall County Police By midday messages were sent to the fishing communities of St Ives, Mousehole and Porthleven for help in intercepting the further 100 non-Cornish fishing vessels still at sea in the area.  Police mobilisation  Within minutes of the riot's beginning, a message was sent to the county police station at Chyandour in Penzance asking for assistance, and by mid-morning a large number of police had assembled from all parts of west Cornwall. Since an estimated 100 Lowestoft vessels were still at sea a small steamer was dispatched, containing the Newlyn harbour master, to advise them of the situation; the steamer was duly chased by a local trawler. By late afternoon the Porthleven fleet arrived in support of the Newlyn men.  Rioting  The next day the police and local fisherman exchanged in a number of violent encounters around Newlyn Harbour. The only recorded injury was to local Police Inspector Matthews, who was knocked on the head by a fish box. As the rioting continued seven \\"Yorkie\\" vessels were sighted making for Penzance harbour to land their catches there. Around 300 of the rioters then made for that harbour and were met by a detachment of the Penzance Borough Police, supported by a group of local Penzance youths. The strong resistance met on arrival in Penzance forced the rioters to return to Newlyn.  Military arrival  By mid-afternoon the situation had become so serious that the local authorities asked for military assistance. At 6:00 pm 400 soldiers from the Royal Berkshire Regiment under Major Massard arrived by train at Penzance railway station and made for temporary barracks in Penzance to await orders.  Rioting spreads  Around 8:00 pm a considerable riot broke out between the Newlyn, Porthleven and St Ives men, and the men of Penzance supported by the men of Lowestoft, who had by this time managed to land their catches. Around 100 police of both the Penzance and Cornwall forces attempted to intervene but were beaten back, this leading the police to summon the assistance of the military recently stationed in Penzance. The soldiers immediately made for Newlyn, again joined by several hundred Penzance men, and, upon crossing Newlyn bridge, were met with stone throwing. The soldiers then made for the Harbour and occupied the piers. While this was occurring the torpedo boat destroyer HMS Ferret entered the harbour. The arrival of the military calmed the rioters, and by midnight that day they had largely dispersed.

Clanton Park is sandwiched between Downsview Park, formerly CFB Downsview, and Earl Bales Park, named after a former reeve of North York. It also contains several smaller parks. History Faywood Boulevard and Wilson Avenue. The area was developed into a residential area in the 1990s. William Duncan, a linen merchant from Ireland, settled a farm near the crossroads of Sheppard Avenue and Dufferin Street in 1827.David Duncan House web site , retrieved May 20, 2008 A crossroads village was named Dublin after this farm. A general store was constructed in the late 1830s. Duncan built the one-room Dublin schoolhouse in 1872. The Neil Family Cottage, built circa 1900 and moved to its current location circa 1910 appears on Toronto's inventory of heritage properties.City of Toronto's Inventory of Heritage Properties The Beth David Synagogue, designed by Irving Grossman in 1959, is an example of cast concrete construction. The reliefs on the large concrete panels were designed by Canadian artist Graham Coughtry. The neighbourhood used to be home to the Anglican Church of the Apostles on Sheppard Avenue until it was closed in 2012. The neighbourhood became part of the Township of North York which later became a borough and then a city, and was then incorporated into the city of Toronto. A large tract of land between Wilson Heights Boulevard and Faywood Boulevard that formerly belonged to the Downsview airport was developed into housing around the 1990s. Demographics The neighbourhood is one of the largest Jewish areas of the city, but also contains a large number of residents of Italian, Filipino, and Russian origin. The housing ranges from 1950s bungalow style homes to new medium rise condominiums. There is some low income high rise housing. Clanton Park's top ten ethnic and cultural groups (by ancestry) in 2006: * 24% - Jewish * 16% - Italian * 15% - Filipino * 9% - Polish * 9% - Canadian * 7% - English * 7% - Russian * 5% - Irish * 4% - Scottish * 4% - Chinese The percentage of population below the poverty line dropped from 24% (in 1996) to 21% (in 2001). Education Two public school boards operate schools in Clanton Park, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the secular Toronto District School Board (TDSB). Both TCDSB, and TDSB operate public institutions that provide primary education in the neighbourhood. TCDSB operates St. Robert Catholic School, whereas TDSB operate Dublin Heights Elementary and Middle School, and Faywood Arts-Based Curriculum School. Neither school board operates a secondary school in the neighbourhood, with TDSB secondary school students residing in Clanton Park attending institutions in adjacent neighbourhoods. The French first language public secular school board, Conseil scolaire Viamonde, and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir also offer schooling to applicable residents of Clanton Park, although they do not operate a school in the neighbourhood. CSCM and CSV students attend schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto. In addition to public schools, the neighbourhood is home to The Toronto Heschel School. The school is a private school that occupies a building that formerly housed Dublin Elementary (until 1980) and then St. Robert Catholic School and Hudson College. Transportation Bus platforms at Sheppard West station, a subway station in Clanton Park. Several major roadways serve as the neighbourhood's boundaries. Sheppard Avenue bounds the neighbourhood in the north, Bathurst Street to the east, Highway 401 to the south, and Allen Road to the west. Highway 401, and portions of Allen Road, south of Transit Road, are controlled access highway. Public transportation in Clanton Park is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission. The TTC operates several services in the neighbourhood, including bus routes, and Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity of the Toronto subway. Two subway stations are located in the neighbourhood, Sheppard West, and Wilson station. In addition to the TTC, bus routes operated by York Region Transit may be accessed from Sheppard West station.

Edward M. McCook's Union cavalry, on a daring raid to sever communications and supply lines in south-central Georgia, was defeated near Newnan, Georgia, by Confederate forces under Joseph Wheeler. The failure of McCook's column and a concurrent ill-fated raid by George Stoneman forced William T. Sherman to lay siege to the city of Atlanta. Background During the Atlanta Campaign, Gen. William T. Sherman, wanting to avoid the necessity of laying siege to the city, ordered two columns of Federal cavalry on a series of raids south of Atlanta in an attempt to cut off supply and communication lines. Maj. Gen. George Stoneman led the cavalry of the Army of the Ohio to the southeast, while Brig. Gen. Edward M. McCook‚Äôs First Division of the cavalry of the Army of the Cumberland was to sever railroads southwest of the city. He was to link with Stoneman and then seize the Andersonville prison camp and free the 32,000 prisoners held there. Crossing the Chattahoochee River on a pontoon bridge erected at Smith's Ferry, McCook's cavalrymen reached Palmetto, where they cut the Atlanta & West Point Railroad. They captured and burned over 1,000 Confederate supply wagons at Fayetteville on July 28. General McCook also gained a reputation for condoning and encouraging the destruction of civilian property. Early the next morning, his raiders reached Lovejoy's Station, twenty-three miles south of Atlanta, and began wrecking the Macon & Western Railroad. However, McCook called off the raid and turned back across the river when Stoneman failed to appear as planned. The battle Nevertheless, as they tried to return to the main army, McCook's division was attacked near Brown's Mill, three miles south of Newnan, by Confederate cavalry under Joseph Wheeler. McCook wanted to surrender, but instead let his officers lead their battalions out separately. McCook, thoroughly defeated, lost 1,285 men, 1,200 horses, several ambulances, and two pieces of spiked artillery, as well as 100 killed and wounded. Wheeler also freed some 300 Confederate prisoners that McCook had previously captured. Wheeler's losses were 50 men. Stoneman's forces also met with disaster. General Stoneman was captured, becoming the highest ranking Union officer to be a prisoner of war during the Civil War. Many of his and McCook's enlisted men ironically wound up in Andersonville, the target of their raid. Brown's Mill changed the course of the Atlanta Campaign, forcing Sherman to abandon his efforts to use cavalry to cut Atlanta's railroads and compelling him to begin a lengthy siege against his wishes. McCook later took his remaining men northward into Tennessee when Sherman sent the Army of the Cumberland to chase John Bell Hood. McCook fought with distinction during the rest of the war, with his stunning defeat to a lesser force at Brown's Mill the major blemish on his service record.

At present, no cure for the disease is known, but medications or surgery can provide relief from the symptoms. While many medications treat Parkinson's, none actually reverses the effects of the disease. Furthermore, the gold-standard treatment varies with the disease state. People with Parkinson's, therefore, often must take a variety of medications to manage the disease's symptoms. Several medications currently in development seek to better address motor fluctuations and nonmotor symptoms of PD. However, none is yet on the market with specific approval to treat Parkinson's. Medication Pharmacological treatment of Parkinson's disease The main families of drugs useful for treating motor symptoms are Levodopa, dopamine agonists, and MAO-B inhibitors. The most commonly used treatment approach varies depending on the disease stage. Two phases are usually distinguished: an initial phase in which the individual with PD has already developed some disability for which he or she needs pharmacological treatment, and a second stage in which the patient develops motor complications related to levodopa usage. Guidance was reviewed in 2011 and no changes were made. According to NICE as of July 2014 a revised guidance was under development with anticipated publication in 2017. Treatment in the initial state aims to attain an optimal tradeoff between good management of symptoms and side effects resulting from enhancement of dopaminergic function. The start of L-DOPA treatment may be delayed by using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists, in the hope of causing the onset of dyskinesias to be retarded. In the second stage, the aim is to reduce symptoms while controlling fluctuations of the response to medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication, and overuse by some patients, also must be controlled. When medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgical techniques such as deep brain stimulation can relieve the associated movement disorders. =Levodopa= Stalevo, a commercial preparation combining entacapone, levodopa, and carbidopa for treatment of Parkinson's disease Circuits of the basal ganglia in treatment of Parkinson's disease ‚Äì model of the effect of medication on motor symptoms: levodopa, dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors stimulate excitatory signals from the thalamus to the cortex by effects on the striatum, compensating for decreased dopaminergic signals from substantia nigra (seen at bottom right). Levodopa (or L-DOPA) has been the most widely used treatment for over 30 years. L-DOPA is transformed into dopamine in the dopaminergic neurons by dopa-decarboxylase. Since motor symptoms are produced by a lack of dopamine in the substantia nigra, the administration of L-DOPA temporarily diminishes the motor symptomatology. Only 5‚Äì10% of L-DOPA crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. The remainder is often metabolised to dopamine elsewhere, causing a wide variety of side effects including nausea, dyskinesias, and stiffness. Carbidopa and benserazide are peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitors. They inhibit the metabolism of L-DOPA in the periphery, thereby increasing levodopa delivery to the central nervous system. They are generally given as combination preparations with levodopa. Existing preparations are carbidopa/levodopa (co-careldopa, trade names Sinemet, Pharmacopa, Atamet) and benserazide/levodopa (co-beneldopa, trade name Madopar). Levodopa has also been related to a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which is a compulsive overuse of the medication, and punding. Controlled, slow-release versions of Sinemet and Madopar spread out the effect of the levodopa. Duodopa is a combination of levodopa and carbidopa. Slow-release levodopa preparations have not shown an increased control of motor symptoms or motor complications when compared to immediate-release preparations. Tolcapone inhibits the catechol-O- methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme, which degrades dopamine and levadopa, thereby prolonging the therapeutic effects of levodopa. It, alongside inhibitors of peripheral dopa decarboxylase, have been used to complement levodopa. However, due to its possible side effects such as liver failure, it is limited in its availability. A similar drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function and maintains adequate inhibition of COMT over time. Entacapone is available for treatment alone (COMTan) or combined with carbidopa and levodopa (Stalevo). Levodopa results in a reduction in the endogenous formation of L-DOPA, and eventually becomes counterproductive. Levodopa preparations lead in the long term to the development of motor complications characterized by involuntary movements called dyskinesias and fluctuations in the response to medication. When this occurs, PD patients change rapidly from stages with good response to medication and few symptoms (\\"on\\" state) to phases with no response to medication and important motor symptoms (\\"off\\" state). For this reason, levodopa doses are kept as low as possible while maintaining functionality. Delaying the initiation of dopatherapy, using instead alternatives for some time, is also common practice. A former strategy to reduce motor complications was to withdraw patients from L-DOPA for some time. It is discouraged now since it can bring dangerous side effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Most people eventually need levodopa and later develop motor complications. The on-off phenomenon is an almost invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Redistribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction and the use of selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous apomorphine, controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intraduodenal administration of levodopa. In animal models it was shown that the intake of Adenosine receptor antagonists together with Levodopa can amplify its therapeutic effects. =Dopamine agonists= Dopamine agonists in the brain have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors. Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing on- off fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa, but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms with the aim of delaying motor complications. When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine, and lisuride. Agonists produce significant, although mild, side effects including somnolence, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes, side effects appear even at the minimal clinically efficacious dose, leading the physician to search for a different agonist or kind of drug. When compared with levodopa, while they delay motor complications, they control worse symptoms. Nevertheless, they are usually effective enough to manage symptoms in the initial years. They are also more expensive. Dyskinesias with dopamine agonists are rare in younger patients, but along other side effects, more common in older patients. All this has led to agonists being the preferential initial treatment for the former as opposed to levodopa in the latter. Agonists at higher doses have also been related to a wide variety of impulse- control disorders. Apomorphine, which is a dopamine agonist not orally administered, may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are not rare, patients under apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Apomorphine can be administered by subcutaneous injection using a small pump which is carried by the patient. A low dose is automatically administered throughout the day, reducing the fluctuations of motor symptoms by providing a steady dose of dopaminergic stimulation. After an initial \\"apomorphine challenge\\" in hospital to test its effectiveness and brief patient and primary caregiver (often a spouse or partner), the latter of whom takes over maintenance of the pump. The injection site must be changed daily and rotated around the body to avoid the formation of nodules. Apomorphine is also available in a more acute dose as an autoinjector pen for emergency doses such as after a fall or first thing in the morning. Nausea and vomiting are common, and may require domperidone (an antiemetic). In a study evaluating the efficacy of dopamine agonists compared to levodopa, the results showed patients who took dopamine agonists were less likely to develop dyskinesia, dystonia, and motor fluctuations, although were more likely to discontinue therapy due to negative side effects such as nausea, edema, constipation, etc. =MAO-B inhibitors= Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline and rasagiline) increase the level of dopamine in the basal ganglia by blocking its metabolization. They inhibit monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) which breaks down dopamine secreted by the dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, reducing MAO-B results in higher quantities of L-DOPA in the striatum. Similarly to dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors improve motor symptoms and delay the need of taking levodopa when used as monotherapy in the first stages of the disease, but produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa. Evidence on their efficacy in the advanced stage is reduced, although it points towards them being useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. Although an initial study indicated selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, this has been later disproven. Metabolites of selegiline include L-amphetamine and L-methamphetamine (not to be confused with the more potent dextrorotary isomers). This might result in side effects such as insomnia. Another side effect of the combination can be stomatitis. Unlike other nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tyramine-containing foods do not cause a hypertensive crisis. =Other drugs= Some evidence indicates other drugs such as amantadine and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms in early and late PD, but since the quality of evidence on efficacy is reduced, they are not first-choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD is accompanied by a range of different symptoms. Different compounds are used to improve some of these problems. Examples are the use of clozapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, modafinil for day somnolence, and atomoxetine for executive dysfunction. A preliminary study indicates taking donepezil (Aricept) may help prevent falls in people with Parkinson's. Donepezil boosts the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and is currently an approved therapy for the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.Donepezil (Aricept) Reduces Falls in People with Parkinson‚Äôs . Parkinson's Disease Foundation Science News. 11 November 2010. In the study, participants taking donepezil experienced falls half as often as those taking a placebo, and those who previously fell the most showed the most improvement. The introduction of clozapine (Clozaril) represents a breakthrough in the treatment of psychotic symptoms of PD. Prior to its introduction, treatment of psychotic symptoms relied on reduction of dopamine therapy or treatment with first generation antipsychotics, all of which worsened motor function. Other atypical antipsychotics useful in treatment include quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify), and paliperidone (Invega). Clozapine is believed to have the highest efficacy and lowest risk of extrapyramidal side effect. =Getting medication on time= Parkinson‚Äôs patients who do not get the correct medicine at the right time when they are in hospital, (frequently they are in hospital due to unrelated illnesses) sometimes cannot talk or walk. The health of a majority deteriorated due to unsatisfactory medication management when they are in hospital. Parkinson‚Äôs UK believes the NHS could save up to ¬£10m a year and improve the care of Parkinson‚Äôs patients if mandatory training is introduced for all hospital staff.Boris Johnson's mother exits Parkinson's campaign after No 10 intervention The Guardian Parkinson UK found: *\\"Nearly two thirds of people who have Parkinson‚Äôs don‚Äôt always get their medication on time in hospital.\\" *\\"More than three quarters of people with Parkinson‚Äôs that we asked reported that their health deteriorated as a result of poor medication management in hospital.\\" *\\"Only 21% of respondents told us they got their medication on time without having to remind hospital staff.\\"Get It On Time Surgery Illustration showing an electrode placed deep seated in the brain Treating PD with surgery was once a common practice, but after the discovery of levodopa, surgery was restricted to only a few cases. Studies in the past few decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, and surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient. Less than 10% of PD sufferers qualify as suitable candidates for a surgical response. The three different mechanisms of surgical response for PD are: ablative surgery, (the irreversible burning or freezing of brain tissue), stimulation surgery or deep brain stimulation (DBS), and transplantation or restorative surgery.Parkinson's disease surgery neurology Channel. Retrieved on 2010-02-02 Target areas for DBS or lesions include the thalamus, the globus pallidus (the lesion technique being called pallidotomy), or the subthalamic nucleus. =Neuroablative lesion surgery= Neuroablative lesion surgery locates and destroys, by heat, the parts of the brain associated with producing Parkinsonian neurological symptoms. The procedures generally involve a thalamotomy and/or pallidotomy. A thalamotomy is the destruction of a part of the thalamus, in particular the ventralis intermedius, to suppress tremor in 80-90% of patients. If rigidity and akinesia are apparent, the subthalamis nucleus is then the site of ablation. A pallidotomy involves the destruction of the globus pallidus, in particular the globus pallidus interna, in patients with Parkinson's who suffer from rigidity and akinesia. Because it is difficult to accurately measure the amount of tissue to be destroyed, tremors not uncommonly persist through multiple courses of surgery, since tissue is irreversibly damaged and removed and testing smaller areas of tissue is safer to prevent serious complications, such as a stroke or paralysis.. This method has been generally replaced by deep brain surgery. =Deep brain stimulation= Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is presently the most used method of surgical treatment because it does not destroy brain tissue, it is reversible, and it can be tailored to individuals at their particular stage of disease. DBS employs three hardware components: a neurostimulator, also called an implanted pulse generator (IPG), which generates electrical impulses used to modulate neural activity, a lead wire which directs the impulses to a number of metallic electrodes towards the tip of the lead near the stimulation target, and an extension wire that connects the lead to the IPG. The IPG, which is battery-powered and encased in titanium, is traditionally implanted under the collarbone, and is connected by the subcutaneous extension to the lead, which extends from outside the skull under the scalp down into the brain to the target of stimulation. The IPG, or the entire three-component system, are sometimes referred to as a brain pacemaker, due to the precedence and renown of cardiac pacemakers and similarities in the components of both types of systems. The preoperative targeting of proper implantation sites can be accomplished by the indirect and direct methods. The indirect method uses computer tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ventriculography to locate the anterior and posterior commissures and then employs predetermined coordinates and distances from the intercommissural line to define the target area. Subsequent histologically defined atlas maps can also be used to verify the target area. The direct method provides visualization and targeting of deep nuclei by applying stereotactic preoperative MRI, which unlike the indirect method, takes into account the anatomic variation of the nuclei‚Äôs size, position, and functional segregation amongst individuals.Nolte, 2012 Electrophysial functional mapping, a tool used in both methods to verify the target nuclei, has come under scrutiny due to its associated risks of hemorrhages, dysarthria or tetanic contractions. Recently, susceptibility-weighted imaging, a type of MRI, has shown incredible power in its ability to distinguish these deep brain nuclei and is being used in DBS to reduce the overuse of EFM.Abosch, 2010 DBS is recommended to PD patients without important neuropsychiatric contraindications who suffer motor fluctuations and tremor badly controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication. DBS is effective in suppressing symptoms of PD, especially tremor. A recent clinical study led to recommendations on identifying which Parkinson's patients are most likely to benefit from DBS. Diet Muscles and nerves that control the digestive process may be affected by PD, so it is common to experience constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach for a longer period of time than normal). A balanced diet is recommended to help improve digestion. Diet should include high-fiber foods and plenty of water. Levodopa and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, competing between them for access. When taken together, the consequences of such competition is a reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive proteins are discouraged, while in advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa is recommended to be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch and are usually taken at dinner. As the disease advances, dysphagia may appear. In such cases, specific measures include the use of thickening agents for liquid intake, special postures when eating, and gastrostomy in the worst cases. Rehabilitation Studies of rehabilitation in Parkinson's disease are scarce and are of low quality. Partial evidence indicates speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation. Regular physical exercise and/or therapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. Exercise may also improve constipation. Exercise interventions have been shown to benefit patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease in regards to physical functioning, health-related quality of life, and balance and fall risk. In a review of 14 studies examining the effects of exercise on persons with Parkinson‚Äôs disease, no adverse events or side effects occurred following any of the exercise interventions. Five proposed mechanisms by which exercise enhances neuroplasticity are known. Intensive activity maximizes synaptic plasticity; complex activities promote greater structural adaptation; activities that are rewarding increase dopamine levels and therefore promote learning/relearning; dopaminergic neurones are highly responsive to exercise and inactivity (‚Äúuse it or lose it‚Äù); and where exercise is introduced at an early stage of the disease, progression can be slowed. One of the most widely practiced treatments for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT), which focuses on increasing vocal loudness and has an intensive approach of one month. Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve voice and speech function. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many activities of their daily living as possible. Few studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of OT and their quality is poor, although some indication shows it may improve motor skills and quality of life for the duration of the therapy. For monitoring patients with Parkinson's disease, research teams are examining whether virtual house calls can replace visits to clinical facilities. In a trial of such video visits, patients preferred the remote specialist after 1 year. The home care was considered convenient but requires access to and familiarity with Internet-enabled technologies. =Exercise= Regular physical exercise with or without physiotherapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for patients experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. Common changes in gait associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing are addressed by a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Goals with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs include improving gait speed, base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and varying environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed). Strengthening exercises have led to improvements in strength and motor functions in patients with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity in cases of mild to moderate Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Patients perform exercises when at their best, 45 minutes to one hour after medication. An 8-week resistance training study geared towards the lower legs found that patients with Parkinson's Disease gained abdominal strength, and improved in their stride length, walking velocity and postural angles. Also, due to the forward flexed posture and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson‚Äôs disease, deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial for improving chest wall mobility and vital capacity. Exercise may correct constipation. Exercise training on a vibratory platform, also called whole body vibration (WBV) training, has been recently introduced as a training tool complementing standard physical rehabilitation programs for people with Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Compared to no intervention, single sessions of WBV have resulted in improved motor ability, as reflected by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) tremor and rigidity scores. However, longer-term (3‚Äì5 weeks) WBV programs have not led to improved UPDRS motor scores compared to conventional exercises. Furthermore, multiple sessions of WBV have failed to enhance mobility measures (i.e., the Timed Up and Go Test and 10-Meter Walking Test) in people with Parkinson‚Äôs disease. A recent review deemed that the evidence of the effects of WBV training on sensorimotor and functional performance remains inconclusive. =Psychological treatments= Psychological treatment is based on cognitive-behavioral interventions. Cognitive behavioral therapy is confirmed as efficient for treatment of parkinsonian pain, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and impulse control disorders.} Treating Parkinson's disease engages a multidisciplinary approach, and includes a psychologist, because motor symptoms can be worsened by psychosocial factors like anxiety, phobia, and panic attacks. Psychological treatment is tailored to each individual, based on clinical recommendations, especially if they have severe motor disability or cognitive problems. =Rhythmic auditory stimulation= Rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) is a neurological rehabilitation technique consisting in compensating the loss of motor regulation through an external sensory stimulation, mediated by the sound. This technique relies on the strong interaction between auditory and motor neural system. By synchronizing his footsteps on the emitted sound (that can be \\"metronome-like\\" cues or complex music) the patient can improves his gait speed and his stride length. This rehabilitation technique is usually used by physical and occupational therapist for support rhythmic exercise (nordic walking). Nevertheless, studies show that RAS is also a promising auto-rehabilitation technique for patients, at home. An electronic device, allegedly based on these statements, was developed and then became available on the market. Albeit there are no medical claims made for this product, its manufacturer hopes to improve mobility problems of people suffering from this disease. =Cuing= Visual, auditory, and somatosensory cuing devices have also been used van Wegen et al 2006; Nieuwboer et al. 2007 in conjunction with walking aids to improve gait in individuals with Parkinson‚Äôs disease. These cuing strategies have been implemented in an 'app' called Parkinson Home Exercises. Given the challenge that this clinical population may have with initiating motor movements during gait (e.g., freezing gait) , these devices provide external stimulation to cue for the next step to take place.Pongmala, C., Suputtitada, A. & Sriyuthsak, M. (2010). The study of cuing devices by using visual, auditory and somatosensory stimuli for improving gait in Parkinson‚Äôs patients. International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Technology =Gait training= Gait impairment in people with Parkinson's Disease occurs when they generate an inappropriate stride length. Since it is proven that tremor-dominant and akinetic rigid types of Parkinson's disease have various different visuomotor deficiencies, like problems in visual perception and motor coordination, that can influence their gait training, it is recommended for them to receive neuropsychological assessment before physical therapy. Task-specific gait training may also lead to long-term gait improvement for patients with Parkinson's disease. Previous research studies have utilized body weight support systems during gait training, where individuals are suspended from an overhead harness with straps around the pelvic girdle as they walk on a treadmill. This form of gait training has been shown to improve long-term walking speed and a shuffling gait following a one-month intervention period. Studies are also looking at the effect of tai chi on gait performance, and balance in people with Parkinson's Disease. The first study concluded that tai chi was ineffective since there was no improvement on gait performance and no improvement on the Part III score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The second study found that patients taking tai chi improved on their UPDRS score, Timed Up and Go test, six-minute walk and backwards walking. It did not however, show any improvements on their forward walking or their one leg stance test. =Speech and occupational therapy= One of the most widely practiced treatments for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. A study was conducted to determine if LSVT was beneficial in improving sentence intelligibility of 8 speakers with Parkinson's Disease, according to normal-hearing listeners. The study concluded that after LSVT, there was a significant improvement in the percentage of the words understood by the listeners. Even though the LSVT was not beneficial for 2 of the speakers, the treatment did increase their vocal loudness. Therefore, LSVT has shown that it can improve speech and voice impairments in people with Parkinson's Disease. People with Parkinson's disease can also develop dysarthria which is characterized by reduced speech intelligibility. Prosodically-based treatments may help. Occupational therapy aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as much of their daily routine as possible. There is indication that occupational therapy may improve motor skills and quality of life for the duration of the therapy. =Music therapy= Studies are considering whether music therapy can have a beneficial effect on people with Parkinson's Disease. A 3-month study investigated whether there was any motor benefit of music therapy and physical therapy on Parkinson's Disease patients, and whether the therapies had any effect on their emotional well being and their quality of life. The music therapy consisted of choral singing, voice exercise and rhythmic and free body movements, whereas the physical therapy consisted of stretching exercises, specific motor tasks and ways to improve balance and gait. The study concluded that music therapy had a beneficial effect on the patient's emotions, it showed an improvement in bradykinesia, and in quality of life. Music therapy however lacked any motor benefit, whereas physical therapy showed that it improved the rigidity of the patients. = Telemedicine = A 2017 one-year randomized controlled trial found that providing remote neurologic care to individuals with Parkinson's Disease in their own homes was feasible and as effective as in-person care. While it can be more difficult for remote caregivers to establish trust while providing remote care, that assessment of video visits in a patient's home found that, after four virtual visits over one year, individuals with Parkinson's Disease preferred their connection with the remote specialist to their local clinician. Benefits of telemedicine include convenience and cost- effectiveness, as the virtual in-home visits have been found to reduce travel costs and time for patients relative to in-office visits. Some studies have found that the technology supports personalized connections similar to the house calls of the past. Five randomized controlled trials indicated that quality of life was similar or improved for those receiving telemedicine care. Challenges related to telemedicine in treatment of individuals with Parkinson's Disease are related to the technological requirements, as patients and their friends or families must have access to and familiarity with Internet-based technologies. In part because of these technological requirements, studies in the United States have tended to include few participants from ethnic minorities and disproportionately include more highly educated populations. One solution proposed to reduce social and economic barriers to access to remote care is to establish satellite teleneurology clinics in underserved regions. Physicians cite barriers with inability to perform a full neurologic exam in addition to technology and reimbursement issues. New telemedicine technologies being used or evaluated in the context of telemedicine include proprietary wearables, self-sensing and adjusting closed loop systems, robotic technologies, smart devices to detect movements, programs to improve medication adherence, smart home integration, and artificial intelligence or machine learning-based systems. Palliative care Palliative care is often required in the final stages of the disease, often when dopaminergic treatments have become ineffective. The aim of palliative care is to achieve the maximum quality of life for the person with the disease and those surrounding him or her. Some central issues of palliative are caring for patients at home while adequate care can be given there, reducing or withdrawing dopaminergic drug intake to reduce drug side effects and complications, preventing pressure ulcers by management of pressure areas of inactive patients, and facilitating the patient's end-of-life decisions for the patient, as well as involved friends and relatives.  Other treatments  Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa- induced dyskinesias. Its full usefulness in PD is an open research field. Different nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however, no evidence shows vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. Not enough evidence exists to suggest that acupuncture, and practice of qigong or t'ai chi have any effect on symptoms. Fava and velvet beans are natural sources of L-DOPA and are taken by many people with PD. While they have shown some effectiveness, their intake is not free of risks. Life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Faecal transplants may have a beneficial impact on symptoms. While not a treatment per se, a wearable device developed by Haiyan Zhang of Microsoft Research Cambridge, can serve to dampen the tremors of a patient's hand and fingers thereby restoring normal functions. There is also research evaluating the use of telemedicine in movement disorders such as PD. Although remote visits with a specialist can be cost-effective compared to in-person visits, telemedicine requires patients and their caregivers to access to Internet- enabled technologies. History An 1893 photograph of Jean-Martin Charcot, who made important contributions to the understanding of the disease, including the proposal of anticholinergics as treatments for tremor The positive albeit modest effects of anticholinergic alkaloids obtained from the plant of the belladonna were described during the 19th century by Charcot, Erb, and others. Modern surgery for tremor, consisting of the lesioning of some of the basal ganglia structures was first tried in 1939, and was improved over the following 20 years. Before this date, surgery consisted in lesioning the corticospinal pathway with paralysis instead of tremor as result. Anticholinergics and surgery were the only treatments until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid-20th century. It entered clinical practice in 1967, and the first large study reporting improvements in people with Parkinson's disease resulting from treatment with levodopa was published in 1968. Levodopa brought about a revolution in the management of PD. By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation emerged as a possible treatment, and it was approved for clinical use by the FDA in 1997. Research directions No new PD treatments are expected in the short term, but several lines of research are active for new treatments. Such research directions include the search of new animal models of the disease, and the potential usefulness of gene therapy, stem cells transplants, and neuroprotective agents. =Animal models= The tragedy of a group of drug addicts in California in the early 1980s who consumed a contaminated and illicitly produced batch of the synthetic opiate MPPP brought to light MPTP as a cause of parkinsonian symptoms. Other predominant toxin-based models employ the insecticide rotenone, the herbicide paraquat, and the fungicide maneb. Models based on toxins are most commonly used in primates. Transgenic rodent models also exist. =Gene therapy= Present treatments of Parkinson's disease provide satisfactory disease control for most early-stage patients. However, present gold-standard treatment of PD using levodopa is associated with motor complications, and does not prevent disease progression. More effective and long-term treatment of PD are urgently needed to control its progression. In vivo gene therapy is a new approach for treatment of PD. The use of somatic-cell gene transfer to alter gene expression in brain neurochemical systems is a novel alternative conventional treatment. Gene therapy is currently under investigation. It involves the use of a noninfectious virus to shuttle a gene into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme which helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. One of the gene therapy based approach involves gene delivery of neurturin and gilial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to the putamen in patients with advanced Parkinson‚Äôs disease. GDNF protects dopamine neurons in vitro and animal models of parkinsonism; neurturin is a structural and functional analogue of GDNF that protected dopamine neuron in animal model of the disease. Despite open-label trials showing benefits of continuous infusion of GDNF, the results were not confirmed in double-blind studies. This may be due to the distribution factor; the trophic factor was not distributed sufficiently throughout the target place. Another gene therapy of PD involved insertion of the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) into the subthalamic nucleus. GAD enzyme controls GABA productions. In Parkinson‚Äôs disease, the activity of both GABA efferents to the subthalamic nucleus and its target within the basal ganglia circuity are affected. This strategy used andeno-associated viral vectoe (AAV2) to deliver GAD to the subthalamic nucleus. The trial was done to compare the effect of bilateral delivery of AAV2-GAD into the subthalamic nucleus with bilateral sham surgery in patients with advanced Parkinson‚Äôs disease. The study showed the first success of randomised, double-blind gene therapy trial for a neurodegenerative disease and justified the continued development of AAV2-GAD for treatment of PD. = Neuroprotective treatments = GNDF (chemical structure pictured) have been proposed as neuroprotectors in PD, none has proven its efficacy. Investigations on neuroprotection are at the forefront of PD research. Currently, no proven neuroprotective agents or treatments are available for PD. While still theoretical, neuroprotective therapy is based on the idea that certain neurons that produce dopamine and are susceptible to premature degeneration and cell death can be protected by the introduction of neuroprotective pharmaceuticals. This protection can occur before any symptoms manifest based on genetic risk, and also during early- or late-stage PD when other treatments have ceased their impact due to the progression of the disease. Accordingly, neuroprotective therapy seeks to delay the introduction of levodopa. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them has been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include antiapoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein. Selegiline Selegiline is in a group of medications called monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors.Selegiline Information MedLine Plus. Retrieved on 2010-02-02 Selegiline is used to help control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in people who are taking levodopa and carbidopa combination (Sinemet). Selegiline may help people with PD by stopping the effects of levodopa/carbidopa from wearing off, and increasing the length of time levodopa/carbidopa continues to control symptoms. Rasagiline In response to potentially toxic amphetamine metabolites caused by selegiline, another promising treatment is in MAO B propargyl amine inhibitor rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-R-aminoindan, Azilect((R))). The oral bioavailability of rasagiline is 35%, it reaches T(max) after 0.5‚Äì1.0 hours and its half-life is 1.5‚Äì3.5 hours. Rasagiline undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily by cytochrome P450 type 1A2 (CYP1A2). Rasagiline is initiated at 1-mg once-daily dose as monotherapy in early PD patients and at 0.5‚Äì1.0 mg once-daily as adjunctive to levodopa in advanced PD patients.Treat Parkinson Disease Effectively Retrieved on 2010-02-02 = Neural transplantation = Since early in the 1980s fetal, porcine, carotid or retinal tissues have been used in cell transplants for PD patients. Although there was initial evidence of mesencephalic dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, the best constructed studies up to date indicate that cell transplants have no effect. An additional significant problem was the excess release of dopamine by the transplanted tissue, leading to dystonias. Stem cell transplants are a main research recent target: they are easy to manipulate and when transplanted into the brains of rodents and monkeys, cells survive and improve behavioral abnormalities of the animals. Nevertheless, use of fetal stem cells is controversial. Some have proposed that such controversy may be overcome with the use of induced pluripotent stem cells from adults.

Each October, √ñlgii hosts the annual Golden Eagle Festival which showcases the ancient Kazakh custom of eagle hunting. History √ñlgii was an ethnic Kazakh village before the founding of the modern nation of Mongolia in 1911. Kazakhs have been coming to the Altai region of Mongolia for at least 200 years. Many came as Kazakhs faced pressure from the expanding Russian Empire. These numbers increased significantly after the 1917 Russian Revolution and the rise of communism in China. It was the center of Islam in Mongolia before religious purges in the 1930s in which the mosque was destroyed and the imam was executed. Mongolia initially tried to suppress Kazakh language and culture before creating Bayan-√ñlgii Aimag in 1939, with √ñlgii as the seat of government. Much of the center of the city was built in the 1950s to 1980s. √ñlgii developed less than the rest of Mongolia and was not connected by railroad or paved road due to its isolated location and lack of mineral resources. After the Mongolian democratic revolution in 1991 and the breakup of the Soviet Union, 25% of the population moved to newly independent Kazakhstan. Though, many later returned and the population has largely recovered. In recent years construction has increased significantly resulting in many new apartments, shops, restaurants, and hotels (most have been built since 2005), mirroring a construction boom throughout Mongolia.Werner, Cynthia. \\"Kazakhs in Mongolia\\", Cynthiawerner.com; accessed 6 January 2019.

It is a nature reserve and biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, notified in 1971. The wood takes its name from the nearby village of Weston-in-Gordano. History The wood itself dates at least from Iron Age times, with some evidence that there has been woodland here since trees began to recolonise after the last Ice Age some 10,000 years ago. Some of its internal features e.g. old stones, ditches and banks are thought to be medieval boundaries, dating from the Middle Ages and used to divide the wood into sectors. More recently, after the manor of North Weston was sold to the City of Bristol in 1637, marker stones were placed to mark a boundary across the woodland. These stones, marked with C.B. (City of Bristol), remain in place and can be found by looking at the old OS maps of the 19th century. Adjacent to the wood on its southern side is the dis-used Black Rock quarry. On the western side of the woodland, adjacent to Valley Road which runs through the Nightingale Valley, sits another disused quarry which now is the site for the local civic amenity site. The woodland sits on a ridge of Carboniferous limestone. Flora Slopes within the woodland are covered with small-leaved lime trees; oak and hazel are more common on flatter hilltop areas. Rare whitebeams are also dotted throughout the wood. The rare plant purple gromwell is found at the site.Myles (2000), page 168 Other flowers include; wood anemones, violets and bluebells. The presence of other plants such as herb paris and yellow archangel together with the purple gromwell, show that this wood is ancient. Fauna There is a wide coppiced open area inside the wood, created as a butterfly feature as part of the reserve management work, called \\"The Ride\\". Butterflies such as the orange tip, speckled wood and purple hairstreak can be seen in the area in summer. The birds commonly seen, include woodpecker, nuthatch, and tawny owl. Bats also roost in the trees, and the presence of many setts indicates a large badger population. Access and management There are four main entry points to the woodland. The first (at 51.471456,-2.790383) is from a minor road which leads north from the Portishead to Weston in Gordano road; just past the civic amenity site. It enters the north west side of the wood and leads up a set of steps to the main circular path through the woods. The second entrance (at 51.467293,-2.783898) leads past the old quarries along a pathway which leads along the south eastern side of the wood. The third entrance is off Underwood Road in Portishead (at 51.472967,-2.777782) and enters the eastern side of the wood. The final entrance (at 51.4750278, -2.7835127) is from the fields adjacent to the northern side of the woods. A circular walk has been marked out inside the wood. An area of 38 hectares is managed as a nature reserve by Avon Wildlife Trust, and purchased with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Countryside Agency, and donations from members and local people.

Mr Justice Calvert-Smith, is a retired British judge. He was Director of Public Prosecutions of England and Wales from 1998 to 2003 and then a High Court judge. Educated at Eton College and King's College Cambridge, he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1969 and became a queen's counsel in 1997. He was knighted in 2002 and sat as a High Court judge from 2005 to 2012. Mr Justice Calvert-Smith is an honorary member of QEB Hollis Whiteman.  Career  = Early career = After beginning his career both prosecuting and defending, he specialised in prosecution work from 1986, including several cases of murder, terrorism and organised crime. = Directorship of Public Prosecutions = In October 1998, he became Director of Public Prosecutions and head of the Crown Prosecution Service, a post he held for five years. During his tenure, the failure of the prosecutions of Paul Burrell and the killers of Damilola Taylor damaged the Service's reputation, and the CPS was described as \\"institutionally racist\\" by him and two reports.bbc.co.uk: \\"In an interview for BBC Radio 4's On The Ropes (Tuesday 25 June, 9.00am), the Director of Public Prosecutions says he believes that British society is racist.\\"telegraph.co.uk: Notable successes were the prosecutions of serial killer Harold Shipman and former spy David Shayler. When the Human Rights Act 1998 was passed (most of which came into force in 2000), Calvert-Smith was the first DPP to have to deal with the impact it was expected to have on criminal trials.innocent.org.uk: In 2002, he opposed proposals to change the law to deem a person found in possession of drugs to be guilty of possession with intent to supply if the quantity exceeded a certain amount. In a letter to Parliament, he wrote: \\"the best approach is for the jury to focus on weighing the evidence tending to demonstrate intent to supply ... as opposed to this issue being determined with reference to an arbitrary amount\\".Quote by Sir David Calvert-Smith, QC, Parliament of the United Kingdom.

However, the law was changed after he left office, by section 2 of the Drugs Act 2005, which was never commenced and was repealed by the Policing and Crime Act 2009, s 112(2), Sch 8, Pt 13. Towards the end of his term, he piloted a new system in which CPS lawyers, instead of police officers, would make decisions about charging suspects, resulting in a 15 percent increase in convictions. This policy was fully implemented by his successor. = Later career = In 2004, he was acting director of the Customs and Excise Prosecutions Office. In 2005, he led an inquiry for the Commission for Racial Equality into how the police forces of England and Wales deal with racism within their ranks. The inquiry reported in March 2005.

She was played by actress Melissa Leo. In the first two seasons of the show her character was the only female detective or member of the main cast. However, NBC president Warren Littlefield felt that the lack of other female characters was alienating the audience, so Megan Russert was added to the show. It was stated in a special edition of Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, the non-fiction book that the film was based on, that the character of Kay Howard was based on Baltimore Police detective Rich Garvey. Howard is also influenced by Detective Bertina Silver, referred to as 'Bert' by her colleagues, thought by many in the unit to be the exception to the 'Secretaries-with-guns' female officer stereotype. Early and family life In the Season 3 episode \\"The Last of the Watermen\\", Howard visits the small coastal oyster fishing town of Tilghman Island, Maryland where she was brought up. Her father and her brother Josh still live there. She also has a sister, Carrie, who appeared in a Season 4 episode (also played by Leo, under the pseudonym Margaret May). Professional life Having been a homicide detective since April 1991, Kay was generally portrayed as a tough female detective. She is not entirely hardened by her job, however, and at times expresses disbelief that seemingly good people can do terrible things. As a detective she is thorough, realistic, and generally has among the highest clearance rates in the squad. Her high rate of success is important to her as she feels that, as the only woman in the department, she needs to prove herself. Megan Russert would later chide her for this tendency. Despite her generally rational approach, Howard occasionally indulges in magical thinking, feeling that some things \\"transcend\\" logic. This includes varied superstitions, which she displays at work, and the idea that the ghost of a victim had aided her in solving a case. During Season 3, she and fellow detectives Stanley Bolander and Beau Felton are shot while trying to serve an arrest warrant on a suspect. Howard is struck in the heart, but eventually makes a full recovery and returns to work. Her family comes in from the coast to visit her in the hospital; her father is especially concerned over how little information the doctors are willing to share. In the Season 4 premiere, Howard passes a promotion exam and is elevated to Sergeant. Most of her fellow detectives had encouraged her to go up for the position, but on actually assuming the role she becomes alienated from them. This happens in part because she seems at first to \\"micromanage\\" them, and also simply because her new position changes her relationship with them. Her friendship with Det. Meldrick Lewis, for example, grows especially stormy after she is promoted. Personal life Howard guards her private life jealously, but is less consistent on this in the first two seasons. Prior to joining the homicide department, she had an affair with Lt. Jimmy Tyron, who was married. Tyron would later be arrested for shooting C. C. Cox in the back while fleeing. In the first season, she agrees to a date with ASA Ed Danvers, and by the second season the couple go on a double date with Det Stanley Bolander and his new girlfriend. Her relationship with Danvers is strictly sexual, and ends at an unspecified point in the third season of the show. After breaking up with Danvers, she becomes far more reticent about personal matters to avoid being the subject of office gossip. It was implied in the fourth season that her intense privacy, combined with her toughness and style change to masculine clothing, had led to some speculation that she might be a lesbian; upon seeing Kay with a mystery date, Det John Munch said as much, although this may have just been a tactic to get her to tell him who the man is. The DVD commentaries for the show reveal that the producers were aware that the character was extremely popular in the LGBT community. She is generally \\"one of the team\\", although her being female was occasionally remarked upon at the squad. The crime scene photographer J. H. Brodie expressed his infatuation with her, but due to a miscommunication she felt his expression of affection was a way to make fun of her. Det. Mike Kellerman also stated she was attractive \\"because of the hair.\\" In certain episodes she expressed concern about her sister and gender issues. In general she dislikes both being deemed masculine and being treated \\"like a lady.\\" Final season Season 5 saw her character relegated to some degree, but also showed important developments. For example, she is surprised by how emotional she becomes when her former boyfriend Danvers gets engaged. In a later episode in the season, Danvers' fiancee is murdered, which hits Howard nearly as hard as it does Danvers. In addition, her former partner Beau Felton is murdered in Season 5. In Season 6, Howard is transferred to the Fugitive squad, and decides to remain there. The character is not seen again until Homicide: The Movie, when she joins the current and former Homicide detectives to search for Gee's attacker.

Located next to the city's Civic Center and Financial District, it overlooks the International Riverfront and was designed to blend with the City-County Building across Woodward Avenue, TCF Center, and the former Ford Auditorium to the south. History Minoru Yamasaki designed the new headquarters for the Michigan Consolidated Gas Company in 1962. The Michigan Consolidated Gas Building was his first skyscraper, and he used elements from this design for the original World Trade Center in New York City. His design for McGregor Memorial Conference Center at Wayne State University is also highly regarded by architects.AIA Detroit Urban Priorities Committee, (1-10-2006).Top 10 Detroit Interiors, Model D Media In the 1980s, the building became the American Natural Resources Building when that company was formed as the parent of Michigan Consolidated Gas. At this time, a pedestrian bridge was added over West Larned Street at the 14th floor to connect the ANR offices to Michigan Consolidated, which had relocated to the adjacent Guardian Building. When the ANR offices moved from the building in the 1990s, it was given its current name. In December 2012, Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert announced that his company, Rock Ventures, had purchased the building and that Quicken Loans would occupy eight-floors in the structure. The building joins the nearby Qube, First National Building, Chrysler House, and 1001 Woodward in Rock Ventures' real estate portfolio. October 28, 2014, Fifth Third Bank announced plans to relocate its Michigan Regional Headquarters from Southfield to Downtown Detroit in what will be named the Fifth Third Bank Building at One Woodward. The bank occupies approximately of the structure and has also pledged an investment totaling $85 million to the city of Detroit to accompany the transition to its new regional headquarters. Architecture The main structure sits on a raised platform that conceals the loading dock and service entrances. It contains 26 usable floors, a double-height mechanical penthouse, and one floor below ground, reaching a height of The lobby rises two stories from the base and is enclosed by glass panels framed in chrome. Accent panels have the same hexagonal design as the window frames on the upper stories. The lobby walls are recessed from the building facade to create a loggia on all four sides of the building. The floor of the loggia is covered with white marble cut in a hexagonal design and flows uninterrupted to the interior lobby floor and up the walls of the elevator banks. The ceiling of the main level consists of coffered square panels that have a recessed light fixture. Beneath each light bulb, a four-armed bracket holds a blue or green glass sphere that diffuses the light and casts color onto the white floor. The two elevator lobbies have a dropped ceiling that rises to a gable point and again reflects the windows of the upper stories. The lobby holds only planters and a security desk, against the original wishes of gas company executives. In their request for designs, they wished the lobby to include a showroom for gas appliances with a large sign proclaiming Gas is best, the company's slogan at the time. During his presentation, Yamasaki was able to convince company leaders that the clean lines of an unadorned lobby would enhance the company's image more than a showroom. For this reason, the newsstand traditionally seen in large office buildings is located on the lower level. Passo di Danza by Giacomo Manz√π Yamasaki commissioned Giacomo Manz√π, an Italian sculptor with important liturgical commissions in St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, to craft the graceful Passo di Danza (Step of the Dance) for the Jefferson Avenue entrance. The sculpture originally stood in the center of a reflecting pool that had gas torches on its surface. Because of leakage into the loading dock below, much of the pool was filled with plantings in the 1980s. On at least one occasion, the sculpture was the target of pranksters who painted large green footprints leading to it from The Spirit of Detroit statue across Woodward Avenue to suggest a late-night visit. The fa√ßade of the structure consists of piers clad in white marble that tie into the base and divide each side into four bays. The windows of the upper floors are only 12 inches wide and set into pre-cast panels made of concrete and marble chips that cover two floors. Although the windows extend nearly floor-to-ceiling, their narrowness avoids the feeling of acrophobia, a condition to which Yamasaki is said to have been subject. The top and bottom of the window openings meet in a stylized arch, resulting in a delicate lattice appearance that Yamasaki re-used in his designs for the IBM Building in Seattle, the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and the World Trade Center towers. The lattice is uninterrupted from the second through 28th floors, although on the mechanical floors above 26, the spaces in the lattice remain open instead of being glazed. These floors are enclosed by a recessed wall and the space between the outer and inner walls is illuminated after dark. From the building's opening through the early 1980s, the 26th floor was occupied by an upscale restaurant known as The Top of the Flame. Air- conditioning and mechanical equipment on the roof are concealed by a similar lattice work and also illuminated after nightfall. During much of the year, the lighting is white; however, the color is changed for special events, being red and green during December and red, white, and blue prior to the U.S. Independence Day and Canada Day holidays.

In animals, these fats are obtained from food or are synthesized by the liver. Lipogenesis is the process of synthesizing these fats. The majority of lipids found in the human body from ingesting food are triglycerides and cholesterol. Other types of lipids found in the body are fatty acids and membrane lipids. Lipid metabolism is often considered as the digestion and absorption process of dietary fat; however, there are two sources of fats that organisms can use to obtain energy: from consumed dietary fats and from stored fat. Vertebrates (including humans) use both sources of fat to produce energy for organs such as the heart to function. Since lipids are hydrophobic molecules, they need to be solubilized before their metabolism can begin. Lipid metabolism often begins with hydrolysis, which occurs with the help of various enzymes in the digestive system. Lipid metabolism also occurs in plants, though the processes differ in some ways when compared to animals. The second step after the hydrolysis is the absorption of the fatty acids into the epithelial cells of the intestinal wall. In the epithelial cells, fatty acids are packaged and transported to the rest of the body.  Lipid digestion  Digestion is the first step to lipid metabolism, and it is the process of breaking the triglycerides down into smaller monoglyceride units with the help of lipase enzymes. Digestion of fats begin in the mouth through chemical digestion by lingual lipase. Ingested cholesterol is not broken down by the lipases and stays intact until it enters the epithelium cells of small intestine. Lipids then continue to the stomach where chemical digestion continues by gastric lipase and mechanical digestion begins (peristalsis). The majority of lipid digestion and absorption, however, occurs once the fats reach the small intestines. Chemicals from the pancreas (pancreatic lipase family and bile salt-dependent lipase) are secreted into the small intestines to help breakdown the triglycerides, along with further mechanical digestion, until they are individual fatty acid units able to be absorbed into the small intestine's epithelial cells. It is the pancreatic lipase that is responsible for signaling for the hydrolysis of the triglycerides into separate free fatty acids and glycerol units.  Lipid absorption  The second step in lipid metabolism is absorption of fats. Short chain fatty acids can be absorbed in the stomach, while most absorption of fats occurs only in the small intestines. Once the triglycerides are broken down into individual fatty acids and glycerols, along with cholesterol, they will aggregate into structures called micelles. Fatty acids and monoglycerides leave the micelles and diffuse across the membrane to enter the intestinal epithelial cells. In the cytosol of epithelial cells, fatty acids and monoglycerides are recombined back into triglycerides. In the cytosol of epithelial cells, triglycerides and cholesterol are packaged into bigger particles called chylomicrons which are amphipathic structures that transport digested lipids. Chylomicrons will travel through the bloodstream to enter adipose and other tissues in the body.  Lipid transportation  Due to the hydrophobic nature of membrane lipids, triglycerides and cholesterols, they require special transport proteins known as lipoproteins. The amphipathic structure of lipoproteins allows the tryglycerols and cholesterol to be transported through the blood. Chylomicrons are one sub-group of lipoproteins which carry the digested lipids from small intestine to the rest of the body. The varying densities between the types of lipoproteins are characteristic to what type of fats they transport. For example, very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) carry the synthesized triglycerides by our body and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol to our peripheral tissues. A number of these lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver, but not all of them originate from this organ.  Lipid catabolism  Once the chylomicrons (or other lipoproteins) travel through the tissues, these particles will be broken down by lipoprotein lipase in the luminal surface of endothelial cells in capillaries to release triglycerides. Triglycerides will get broken down into fatty acids and glycerol before entering cells and remaining cholesterol will again travel through the blood to the liver. Breakdown of fatty acids by beta oxidation In the cytosol of the cell (for example a muscle cell), the glycerol will be converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is an intermediate in the glycolysis, to get further oxidized and produce energy. However, the main steps of fatty acids catabolism occur in the mitochondria. Long chain fatty acids (more than 14 carbon) need to be converted to fatty acyl-CoA in order to pass across the mitochondria membrane. Fatty acid catabolism begins in the cytoplasm of cells as acyl-CoA synthetase uses the energy from cleavage of an ATP to catalyze the addition of coenzyme A to the fatty acid. The resulting acyl-CoA cross the mitochondria membrane and enter the process of beta oxidation. The main products of the beta oxidation pathway are acetyl-CoA (which is used in the citric acid cycle to produce energy), NADH and FADH. The process of beta oxidation requires the following enzymes: acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. The diagram to the left shows how fatty acids are converted into acetyl-CoA. The overall net reaction, using palmitoyl-CoA (16:0) as a model substrate is: : 7 FAD + 7 NAD+ \\\\+ 7 CoASH + 7 H2O + H(CH2CH2)7CH2CO-SCoA ‚Üí 8 CH3CO-SCoA + 7 FADH2 \\\\+ 7 NADH + 7 H+  Lipid biosynthesis  In addition to dietary fats, storage lipids stored in the adipose tissues are one of the main sources of energy for living organisms. Triacylglycerols, lipid membrane and cholesterol can be synthesized by the organisms through various pathways. = Membrane lipid biosynthesis = There are two major classes of membrane lipids: glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Although many different membrane lipids are synthesized in our body, pathways share the same pattern. The first step is synthesizing the backbone (sphingosine or glycerol), the second step is the addition of fatty acids to the backbone to make phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is further modified with the attachment of different hydrophilic head groups to the backbone. Membrane lipid biosynthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. = Triglyceride biosynthesis = The phosphatidic acid is also a precursor for triglyceride biosynthesis. Phosphatidic acid phosphotase catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglyceride, which will be converted to triacylglyceride by acyltransferase. Tryglyceride biosynthesis occurs in the cytosol. = Fatty acid biosynthesis = The precursor for fatty acids is acetyl-CoA and it occurs in the cytosol of the cell. The overall net reaction, using palmitate (16:0) as a model substrate is: 8 Acetyl-coA + 7 ATP + 14 NADPH + 6H+ ‚Üí palmitate + 14 NADP+ + 6H2O + 7ADP + 7P¬° = Cholesterol biosynthesis = Cholesterol can be made from acetyl-CoA through a multiple- step pathway known as isoprenoid pathway. Cholesterols are essential because they can be modified to form different hormones in the body such as progesterone. 70% of cholesterol biosynthesis occurs in the cytosol of liver cells.  Lipid metabolism disorders  Lipid metabolism disorders (including inborn errors of lipid metabolism) are illnesses where trouble occurs in breaking down or synthesizing fats (or fat-like substances). Lipid metabolism disorders are associated with an increase in the concentrations of plasma lipids in the blood such as LDL cholesterol, VLDL, and triglycerides which most commonly lead to cardiovascular diseases. A good deal of the time these disorders are hereditary, meaning it's a condition that is passed along from parent to child through their genes. Gaucher's disease (types I, II, and III), Niemann‚ÄìPick disease, Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, and Fabry's disease are all diseases where those afflicted can have a disorder of their body's lipid metabolism. Rarer diseases concerning a disorder of the lipid metabolism are sitosterolemia, Wolman's disease, Refsum's disease, and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.  Types of lipids  The types of lipids involved in lipid metabolism include: * Membrane lipids:  Phospholipids: Phospholipids are a major component of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane and are found in many parts of the body.  Sphingolipids: Sphingolipids are mostly found in the cell membrane of neural tissue.  Glycolipids: The main role of glycolipids is to maintain lipid bilayer stability and facilitate cell recognition.  Glycerophospholipids: Neural tissue (including the brain) contains high amounts of glycerophospholipids. * Other types of lipids:  Cholesterols: Cholesterols are the main precursors for different hormones in our body such as progesterone and testosterone. The main function of cholesterol is controlling the cell membrane fluidity.  Steroid ‚Äì see also steroidogenesis: Steroids are one of the important cell signalling molecules.  Triacylglycerols (fats) ‚Äì see also lipolysis and lipogenesis: Triacylglycerides are the major form of energy storage in human body.  Fatty acids ‚Äì see also fatty acid metabolism: Fatty acids are one of the precursors used for lipid membrane and cholesterol biosynthesis. They are also used for energy.  Bile salts: Bile salts are secreted from liver and they facilitate lipid digestion in the small intestine.  Eicosanoids: Eicosanoids are made from fatty acids in the body and they are used for cell signaling.  Ketone bodies: Ketone bodies are made from fatty acids in the liver. Their function is to produce energy during periods of starvation or low food intake.

Biography =Early life= Fua was born on 22 April 1910 in Thonburi, the son of a court painter who had served under Phya Anusat Chitrakorn. He studied art for four years at Bangkok's Poh Chang School of Arts and Crafts before quitting after he found the teaching method too academic. =Key works and development= He later graduated from the School of Fine Arts (later known as Silpakorn University), a student of Silpa Bhirasri. Among his finest surviving works from that period is an oil portrait titled \\"My Grand Mother\\".The portrait can be seen . During 1940-1946, he received a scholarship from Thanomsakdi Kridakorn to study at Visva Bharati University in West Bengal, India. After returning to Thailand, he served at Silpakorn University. He won gold metals at the 1st and 2nd National Exhibitions of Art in 1949 and 1950 for \\"Petchaburi\\", a tempera on paper and \\"Portrait of Madame Rienpracha\\", an oil on canvas. During 1954-1956, he was granted a scholarship by the Italian government to study at the L'accademia Di Belle Arti (The Academy of Fine Art) in Rome. During this period, he experimented with a variety of painting techniques, including chalk, colored pencils, ink, and the palette knife. He also dabbled with abstract and cubist styles. His subjects were mostly Italian landscapes, but also included some nudes. He was later recognized as a pioneer in Thailand's modern art. In 1957, he again won the gold medal at the National Exhibition of Art. A noted art restorer, from 1969-1982, Fua worked on the restoration of the Tripitaka Library at Wat Rakang Kositaram temple (also known as Wat Bang Wah Yai), built during the reign of King Rama I. During that period, he paid for part of the restoration with his own funds. The restoration project cost him his health. The right side of his face and right arm were paralyzed. In 1991, he was admitted to Siriraj Hospital. He died in October 1993 due to inflamed blood vessels of the brain.

In that office he was head of the Crown Prosecution Service. He was previously a Recorder (part-time judge) and defence barrister. He is currently Warden of Wadham College, Oxford and a life peer in the House of Lords, where he sits as a crossbencher and was previously a Liberal Democrat. Early life Kenneth Donald John Macdonald was born on 4 January 1953 in Windsor.Who's Who, MACDONALD, Sir Kenneth (Donald John) (subscription required for online version) Alt URL He was educated at Bishop Wordsworth's School in Salisbury, Wiltshire before studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics at St Edmund Hall, Oxford from 1971 to 1974. During his time at Oxford he was convicted of supplying cannabis after sending 0.1g of the drug through the post. He pleaded guilty, and was fined ¬£75. Career = Barrister = Macdonald was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in July 1978 where he became the first pupil of barrister Helena Kennedy. He was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1997. As a junior barrister he defended a number of terrorist suspects (both Provisional IRA and those from the Middle East), fraudsters and major drug dealers. He was also on the defence team for the Matrix Churchill trial. In the late 1990s, he was a co-founder of Matrix Chambers (a set of barristers' chambers specialising in human rights cases) with Cherie Booth and Tim Owen. In 2001 he became a recorder (a part-time judge) in the Crown Court. =Director of Public Prosecutions= In August 2003 it was announced that Macdonald would succeed David Calvert-Smith as Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in October of that year. The appointment was immediately denounced by Opposition spokespeople as \\"rampant cronyism\\" and a \\"provocative appointment\\" due to Macdonald's business relationship with Cherie Booth (wife of then prime minister Tony Blair) and his lack of prosecution experience. Government officials, including both the Attorney General and Solicitor General defended the appointment as it had been made by an independent board consisting of First Civil Service Commissioner Usha Prashar; Hayden Phillips, the Permanent Secretary at the Department for Constitutional Affairs; David Omand, the Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary; and Robin Auld, the Lord Justice of Appeal. A few days after the announcement, the press uncovered details of his earlier conviction, sparking fresh controversy. Fellow lawyer David Pannick wrote in The Times to defend Macdonald's appointment and attack the tabloid campaign against him. Macdonald's predecessor also dismissed the relevance of the drugs offence and a report in The Independent also found support for his appointment from within the legal system. As DPP, Macdonald established the Counter Terrorism Division, the Organised Crime Division, the Special Crime Division and the Fraud Prosecution Service. In office, he often took positions which were critical of the government. For example, he opposed ministers' rhetoric around the \\"War on Terror\\", preferring to see terrorist attacks in the UK as law enforcement issues. He was prominent in criticising government attempts to extend pre-charge detention to 42 days, arguing that due process protections should not be undermined and that the reform was unnecessary. Near the end of his term, leaders in The Guardian and The Times strongly supported his record in office. In his last month in office he warned against excessive use of surveillance powers being introduced by the government, saying: \\"We should be careful to imagine the world we are creating before we build it. We might end up living with something we cannot bear.\\" He was awarded a knighthood in the 2007 New Year Honours. =Later career= Macdonald retired as DPP on 31 October 2008, returning to private practice at Matrix Chambers and becoming a regular contributor to The Times, where he writes on law, security and politics. He was succeeded in the office by Keir Starmer. In 2009, he was appointed a Visiting Professor of Law at the London School of Economics. In 2010, he became a Deputy High Court Judge and a member of the Advisory Board of the Centre for Criminology at the University of Oxford. On 14 December 2009, Macdonald wrote an article in The Times about the Chilcot Inquiry into the 2003 Iraq War. This article was more critical than anything that has been said so far by any of the senior civil servants who worked in Whitehall when Blair was prime minister. It attracted media interest also because Macdonald is a member of Matrix Chambers as is Cherie Blair. Macdonald describes Blair's \\"sycophancy towards power\\" and wrote that \\"since those sorry days we have frequently heard [Blair] repeating the self-regarding mantra that 'hand on heart, I only did what I thought was right'. But this is a narcissist's defence, and self-belief is no answer to misjudgment: it is certainly no answer to death.\\" On 28 May 2010, Downing Street announced that Macdonald would be made a Liberal Democrat life peer in the 2010 Dissolution Honours List, which was gazetted on 15 June. The Letters Patent were gazetted on 15 July, dated 12 July granting him the title of Baron Macdonald of River Glaven, of Cley-next-the-Sea in the County of Norfolk. On 13 July 2010, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, announced to Parliament that she had invited Macdonald to oversee a government review of counter terrorism and security powers, to ensure that legislative measures in place were proportionate and consistent with the rule of law. In October 2010, as part of Turkey's accession negotiations to the European Union, and on the recommendation of the Council of Europe, the European Commission invited Macdonald to lead an EU mission to Turkey to assess that country's commitment to free expression and a free press. In January 2011, it was announced that Macdonald was to succeed the late Lord Bingham of Cornhill as the chair of Reprieve, the leading international anti-death penalty and prisoners' rights organisation. In April 2011, he joined the Council of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. In November 2011, he was elected an honorary fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford and in September 2012, he became Warden of Wadham College, Oxford. In 2015, he became Chair of The Orwell Foundation which awards the Orwell Prize for journalism and political writing. Macdonald publicly criticised the Counter- Terrorism and Security Act 2015 in February 2016, saying it was a threat to freedom of academic expression and research. In 2020, he became President of the Howard League for Penal Reform. In October 2020, he said that the Covert Human Intelligence Sources (Criminal Conduct) Bill had \\"gone too far\\" in protecting Government authorities from prosecution: he called for explicit limits on the crimes covered by the bill, so that it would not permit murder, torture or sexual violence. Personal life In 1980 he married Linda Zuck, a television producer for production company Illuminations based in Islington. They have two sons and a daughter, and three granddaughters.

It was located in Belgrade's municipality of Novi Beograd. The settlement was completely evicted and cleared in 2009.U Beogradu raseljen ‚ÄúKarton siti‚Äù  Settlement  Most of the houses in the Cardboard city were built, as its name suggests, from cardboard or other non-building materials, like plywood or nylon bags. The settlement had no communal infrastructure (roads, running water, sewage, electricity). The settlement was located beneath the bridges Gazela and Stari ≈æelezniƒçki. The settlement was just a few kilometers away from the downtown Belgrade, close to the Block 19 and Block 20, and in contrast to five-star hotels Hyatt Regency Belgrade and Continental Hotel Belgrade.

The City Government announced in 2005 that it will evict the population from the settlement into a new one, made of the temporary container houses in the area around the neighborhoods of Dr Ivan Ribar and Blokovi. This decision was not received with approval of the local population. They demanded that the city government should disperse the population on the territory of the entire city, especially in Dedinje, the most affluent neighborhood of Belgrade and that simply moving the population without giving them any jobs or education would not make the difference. They claimed that the action was caused by desire of the city government to free the land for construction. Some NGOs supported the city government, also labeling the protesters being racist, but some pointed out that the solution proposed by the city was not good, economically and socially. After months of verbal clashes and protests, city halted the eviction. In July 2007,Politika daily, July 18, 2007, p.24 city government again announced their wish to relocate an estimated 245 families with 1,500 people from the settlement in spring 2008, due to the planned reconstruction of the Gazela bridge. However, the data on how and where the population will be relocated were not given, but the census of population within the settlement began in August 2007.Politika daily, August 2, 2007, p.8 In May 2009, the decision was made that the Cardboard City should be evicted by the end of June (a total of 176 families). Families were informed that they will be displaced from the settlement within 45 days. Families residing in Belgrade, 112 of them, will be temporarily displaced in containers that will be placed across Belgrade suburbs, while the remaining 62 families will be returned to their area of origin and would become the responsibility of the Government. Families residing in Belgrade would have the right to social assistance, with the only condition being that their children must attend school. It was announced that the reconstruction and repair of the bridge Gazela can begin immediately after the displacement. On August 31, 2009 the Cardboard city was completely evicted, and all families were resettled in five Belgrade municipalities, or returned to their area of origin outside Belgrade.

Modern motorcycles do not require removing a hand from the handlebars to shift gears, using only the fingers for the clutch and the toes of one foot to select gears. In contrast, the fanciful slang \\"suicide\\" was applied to designs where the rider removes one hand to change gears, or cannot put both feet on the ground while using a foot clutch to disengage the transmission. Sometimes the shifter is referred to as a \\"jockey shifter\\" while the foot clutch is called a \\"suicide clutch\\". Suicide clutches were common on mid-20th century Harley-Davidson motorcycles and many custom bikes today still employ this system. Harley-Davidson introduced the hand clutch on the 1952 Panhead. More technically, \\"suicide clutch\\" can refer to clutch controls lacking a detent on the foot clutch, which would otherwise allow the rider to lock the clutch in the disengaged position. Early foot-clutch motorcycles, such as those from Harley-Davidson and Indian, allowed the rider to lock the clutch foot pedal due to its over-center geometry plus a helper spring (aka \\"sissy spring\\"), so they could place both feet on the ground when stopped. These standard clutches are called a \\"rocker clutch\\". If this device was disabled, or a custom foot clutch was installed that had no detent, it was referred to as a \\"suicide clutch\\" because stopping the motorcycle in-gear required the rider to keep his foot on the pedal. Should he lose his balance and put the left foot down, the motorcycle could lurch forward into cross traffic. The suicide clutch, especially on a chopper with no front brake, also made stopping at a red light on a hill especially precarious. The suicide clutch is sometimes incorrectly called a suicide shifter. The suicide clutch is a foot-operated clutch that is mounted on the left side of the motorcycle's forward foot controls. The suicide-clutch moniker has derived from difficulties in operating this form of clutch and shifter. On a motorcycle equipped with a conventional hand clutch and foot shifter, the rider places the left foot on the ground when stopped and holds the motorcycle in place with pressure on the rear brake pedal with the right foot, while engaging the clutch with the left hand. On a motorcycle equipped with a suicide clutch, the clutch is held in with the left foot, requiring the right foot to hold the bike in place, with the right hand applying pressure to the front brake. Early Harley Davidson foot clutches used an over-center spring to hold the clutch pedal in the disengaged position and used a friction disc to allow the rider to adjust the sensitivity of the return. Often riders removed the spring to keep the clutch pedal from returning to the disengaged position while riding. While this spring removal allowed for the clutch to stay engaged better, it also removed the safety feature of the clutch pedal holding itself in the disengaged position. With the pedal not returning to its natural disengaged position, the rider must either shift into neutral or hold the clutch pedal with the left foot when coming to a stop. Early Harley Davidson racers removed the clutch return spring to ensure the clutch stayed in the engaged position throughout the race. This practice soon caught on with other riders. The term \\"suicide clutch\\" was coined by those who could not operate the foot clutch proficiently enough to ride a tank shift (or hand shift) motorcycle in normal traffic. Types of shifters Old-style tank shift. Regular clutch hand Shifter - This is where the shifter is a regular knob either located on the tank, which operates through a linkage to the transmission (tank shifter) or on a lever bolted directly to the top of the transmission (jockey shifter or slap shifter depending on the transmission design) and involves the semi-complex task of foot clutch operation and hand shifting. The foot is used to operate the clutch pedal clutch lever and the second hand is used to shift gears. Clutched Shifter - This shifter has a clutch lever on it allowing one-handed shifting. This design allows the left foot to be free. Technical history Foot clutches with tank shifters were standard on American motorcycles such as Harley-Davidson and Indian up to the mid-20th century and many custom bikes today still employ this system. The system used by Harley-Davidson arranged the controls with the tank shifter on the left side of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the right hand and the shifter, spark control and front brake operated by the left hand. The Harley-Davidson rocker clutch was operated with the left foot with the heel down position to disengage the clutch (with an over-center spring to hold the clutch disengaged) and the toe down position to engage it (\\"Toe-to-go\\"). The right foot operated the rear brake, as is the practice in modern times. Indian, meanwhile arranged things differently. On an Indian, the tank shifter was located on the right side of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the left hand and the shifter, spark control and front brake operated by the right hand. (Indian promoted their system to police departments saying that the officer could fire his service weapon with his right hand while riding) The Indian rocker clutch was also operated by the left foot, but the toe down position disengaged the clutch and the heel down position engaged it. Harley-Davidson introduced the hand clutch on the 1952 Panhead, and simultaneously on the K model, their all- new sport model. The transmissions of the foot shift and the hand shift models were different. The hand shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the \\"jockey top\\" or \\"jockey lid.\\" On this transmission, the gears were selected in a linear fashion with the selector arm moving further and further forward with each successive gear and the gear lever moved in a slotted gate on the side of the tank. When modified to operate as a \\"jockey shifter,\\" The lever would be pushed back for 1st gear and then step by step more forward for each subsequent gear. The foot shift gear selector mechanism was referred to as the \\"ratchet top\\". On this transmission, the gears were selected in a ratcheting motion, returning to its default, central position after each shift. When modified to operate with short, transmission mounted hand lever and a foot suicide clutch, this type of set-up was referred to as a \\"slap shifter\\" or \\"slapper\\". In contrast to the jockey shifter, the slap shifter would always stay in one central position between shifts. Throughout the 50s and 60s on the Panheads and subsequent Shovelheads, foot clutches and hand clutches coexisted, with the hand clutch being progressively more popular over time. After foot clutches had all but disappeared from Harley-Davidson civilian models, the last holdout of foot clutches were the police models up to the early 70's, presumably because the police officers could use their 2-way radio with the left hand while clutching with their foot. The jockey shifter is a gear shifting device used on motorcycles before the use of a foot-operated shift lever. A jockey shifter gets its name from the location of the motorcycle rider's hand when shifting gears. It is under his seat like the position of a jockey's hand while using his riding crop on his horse. This hand shifter lever is directly mounted to the transmission and is just long enough to clear the primary drive cover or belt drive. A motorcycle equipped with this type of shifter requires the use of a foot clutch. The foot clutch comes in one of two configurations; either a rocker foot clutch, which was stock on many early motorcycles, or a suicide foot clutch, which was never available on production motorcycles but was manufactured by daring motorcycle enthusiasts. The suicide foot clutch was usually a very simple lever, more or less a mirror image of the rear brake lever on the other side of the motorcycle; like a standard shift car's clutch lever. The rocker foot clutch is easier to use than the suicide foot clutch because it can be rocked into a position where the clutch is either engaged or disengaged - leaving the rider's foot free to be put down, at a stop, to steady the motorcycle. Sometimes a tank shifter is referred to as a jockey shifter, but this is incorrect due to the rider's hand position being in front of him, not behind him like for a horse jockey. A tank shifter is also connected to the transmission with linkage, which jockey shifters do not use. The earliest known use of a foot clutch and hand shifter, on motorcycles, was with the first multi-geared transmission on the 1915 Harley Davidson.1910 It is a mechanical linkage that is typically mounted to the left side of the motorbike's fuel tank and is held in place by a slotted piece of metal welded to the frame or the tank.Seate, Mike. How to Build a West Coast Chopper Kit Bike. Hong Kong: Motorbooks Inc., 2004. Through a series of linkages, it is connected to the transmission shift selection lever. In terms comparable to a motorcycle of current construction, it is simply a way to relocate the shift lever from the front foot controls to the side of the gas tank. Early motorcycle customizers who were trying to reduce their motorcycle's weight so as to increase its power-to-weight ratio would sometimes replace their stock rocker foot clutch with a hand fabricated suicide foot clutch, and remove the tank shifter's linkage and instead attach a shifter arm directly to the transmission (jockey shifter). This reduced weight not only made the bike accelerate better, but also gave the rider bragging rights of riding a motorcycle which required more skill to operate.

Architect Wirt C. Rowland designed the Buhl in a Neo-Gothic style with Romanesque accents. Constructed in 1925, it stands at 26 stories in the Detroit Financial District across Congress Street from the Penobscot Building and across Griswold Street from the Guardian Building, all of which were designed by Wirt C. Rowland. The Buhl Building stands on the corner of Congress St. West, and Griswold St. in Downtown Detroit. The building stands atop what used to be the Savoyard Creek near its confluence with the Detroit River. In 1836, the creek was covered and turned into a sewer. The Savoyard Club occupied the 27th floor of the Buhl Building from 1928 until its membership dwindled and the club closed in 1994. Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation has its headquarters in the building. Hubbell, Roth & Clark, Inc. (HRC) is a Michigan Civil Engineering firm celebrating 100 years in business. HRC's Detroit Office is located on the 16th floor of the Buhl Building. The Citizen's Bank Building in downtown Saginaw, Michigan was modeled after the Buhl Building. The architectural sculpture on the building was designed by Corrado Parducci. Architect Wirt C. Rowland, designer of the Penobscot Building, Guardian Building, and the Buhl Building was born and raised in Clinton, Michigan. In 1901, he landed a job as an office boy for the Detroit firm of Rogers & MacFarlane, quickly moving on to the prestigious George D. Mason firm. In 1909, he joined the office of Albert Kahn, who had also apprenticed under Mason. In 1910, with the encouragement of both Mason and Kahn, Rowland attended the Harvard Graduate School of Design in Cambridge, MA for a year. The combination of Rowland's natural design talent, Harvard education, and Detroit's healthy economy positioned him to make major contributions to the city's architecture. Rowland is a case study in design attribution. In 1911, in the office of Kahn, he and Ernest Wilby are said to have been primarily responsible for the Hill Auditorium at the University of Michigan. Rowland worked for the local firm of Malcomson & Higginbotham until 1915. He then returned to Kahn's office, contributing to the firm's classic projects, namely the Hatcher Graduate Library at the University of Michigan, the Detroit News Building, the First National Building (1922), and the General Motors Building (1922) renamed Cadillac Place. Rowland's career peaked as Head Designer (1922‚Äì1930) of Smith, Hinchman & Grylls (SmithGroup). There, he designed a dozen major structures in downtown Detroit; among these are a number of the city's most accomplished and evocative buildings. To a large extent, Rowland helped define Detroit's architectural genre. For the Guardian Building, he had assembled a multitude of artisans, mosaicists, sculptors, painters, and tile manufacturers including Corrado Parducci, muralist Ezra Winter, and tile from the Rookwood and Pewabic pottery companies. He thus recreated the architectural synthesis of a medieval cathedral. Hence, Rowland had reached a climax when his Union Trust/Guardian Building became known as \\"the Cathedral of Finance.\\" The Guardian Building opened in 1930. With the onset of the Great Depression, Rowland was laid off from Smith, Hinchman & Grylls. As a result, he formed his own office where his work decreased to a small number of churches, schools and construction projects. Late in life, he returned to a purer, Gothic idiom for his last few projects, notably the Kirk in the Hills church which was built after he died in 1946. During World War II, the Guardian Building would serve as headquarters for war time production. Tenants Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation has its headquarters in the building, and the Consulate of Italy in Detroit is located in Suite 1840.

The character also appeared in the Law & Order episode \\"Charm City.\\" Childhood and early life Born on May 31, 1960 in Baltimore, Maryland, Bayliss had a difficult and often contentious relationship with his family. Growing up he was very close with his cousins Jim and Kurt. In Season 3, after Jim shot and killed a Turkish exchange student, Bayliss tried to shoehorn himself into his partner Frank Pembleton's investigation. Pembleton learned that Kurt was killed during the Persian Gulf War and that Kurt and Jim's father was racist. The case went to a grand jury, which voted not to indict Jim. In Season 4, Bayliss briefly mentioned having a six-year-old niece.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"Work Related\\", originally aired May 17, 1996. His undergraduate minor was in drama.Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"Homicide.com\\", originally aired February 5, 1999. In Season 5, Bayliss revealed to Pembleton that he had been molested as a child by one of his uncles. When he told his father what had happened, the elder Bayliss accused him of lying and the relationship remained hostile until his father's death. Bayliss told Det. Meldrick Lewis that he was once arrested for protesting U.S. policy in El Salvador when he was a teenager, a story idea that Secor reportedly disdained as out of character for Bayliss. It was quickly discarded in favor of the character developments for Seasons 5‚Äì7, including his abuse history and religious journey. Religion Unlike several characters in the series, religion was not important in Bayliss's family background. When asked, he stated he had been raised \\"mutt.\\" In this case that meant his family attended several different denominations, most of which could be termed \\"Mainline Protestant,\\" but they had no attachment to any of them. Bayliss states that he was baptized into the Presbyterian Church and confirmed in the Episcopal Church. He briefly joined Unitarian Universalism for a girlfriend, but seems to have not been particularly sincere about it. He converted to Buddhism in the final season but eventually lost faith.  Adena Watson case  Tim Bayliss had originally worked for the mayor's security, but his ambition had been to work at Homicide. His first case as primary detective was the rape-murder of Adena Watson, and he was never able to close it. This case haunted him throughout the series, but particularly in the first four seasons. At times, it led to friction between himself and his partner, Frank Pembleton, who scolded him for putting too much of himself into his cases. In the Season 4 episode \\"Stakeout,\\" he learns that Risley Tucker (Moses Gunn), an arabber who was the prime suspect, has died of natural causes. Pembleton and Bayliss had put Risley through a long interrogation in hopes of getting him to admit his guilt, but without success. The Season 4 episode, \\"Requiem for Adena\\", centers on the murder of a young black girl that shows similarities to the Adena Watson case. Bayliss becomes obsessed with the idea that the two cases are connected, to the point that his actions begin to jeopardize Pembleton's efforts to get a confession. He learns that many of the people connected with Adena and/or Tucker have moved on from her death much better than he has, and states that he has begun to hate Adena because he cannot do so himself. At the end of the episode, he takes a framed photo of her from his desk (where it had stood ever since that investigation wound down), packs it into an envelope with a carnation from his lapel, and drops the envelope into a trash can. In the Season 6 episode \\"Finnegan's Wake\\", Bayliss wrestles anew with the Watson case when he learns about the longest-running unsolved homicide on the BPD's books, the rape and murder in 1932 of a little girl named Clara Slone. Pembleton tells Tim that the senior detectives all decided to not tell him about the Slone case because it strongly echoed Adena Watson's case, not least because the lead detective in 1932 was a very young cop who saw the case quickly spiral out of his control. Tim is having dreams about the case, and tells the retired cop who helps Det. Falsone solve it that he wondered if he had true evil (the suspect, Risley Tucker) in his sights and let him get away.  Partnership with Pembleton  The partnership with Frank Pembleton would form a core element to the character and the entire show. Pembleton was by turns supportive and hurtful to Bayliss. He wanted to take a hard line on Bayliss's cousin who killed a Turkish exchange student, and also said that Bayliss lacked an understanding of \\"his dark side\\" so would do poorly in his job. Yet Pembleton also saved Bayliss from being charged in an incident that could have been interpreted as robbery, and once told him that he was the only person he trusted other than his wife, Mary. While Pembleton saw the world in strict black and white terms, Bayliss was far more open to accepting the shades of grey present in police work. That said, the two ended their partnership for a time in the fifth season, partly due to Pembleton's stroke. Bayliss stated that Frank's rhythm was \\"off\\" after recovery, but there were also hints that he had come to prefer working without him. In addition, he felt uncomfortable with Pembleton after he told him how he (Bayliss) was sexually abused in childhood. The case in the episode featuring his admission (\\"Betrayal\\") involved a mother who allowed her boyfriend to beat her daughter from a previous marriage and was pregnant with the new boyfriend's child; Pembleton showed some sympathy to the woman's story, while Bayliss repeatedly and forcefully berated the woman for her reluctance to stop the ultimately- fatal abuse. Later, he returned to partnering with Pembleton due to Mary leaving Pembleton for a time. While working on a case in which a teenage girl murdered the stepfather who beat her mother, the two had very different views: while Pembleton is far more sympathetic to her, Bayliss is determined to see her charged with murder. Pembleton sees Tim's personal involvement and assures him that it is not his fault that he was abused. Following his stroke, Bayliss treats Pembleton in the same cold manner, often refusing to listen to his theories and indifferent to any attempts Pembleton made towards repairing their relationship, although this animosity had all but disappeared by the end of the fifth and start of the sixth season. Pembleton left the force shortly after Bayliss was shot by a member of Georgia Rae Mahoney's gang in a gun battle. Pembleton met Bayliss's mother, Virginia, while Tim recovered from surgery. She told Frank what Tim thought of their friendship: \\"He thinks the world of you. He says you're his friend. He says you're not a person who has friends, but he's your friend.\\" Shortly afterwards, Pembleton and Mary say a prayer for Tim, during which Pembleton is visibly distraught (something he is almost never shown to be in the course of the show) and refers to Tim as his friend.  Personal life  In the first two seasons, Bayliss's character had been called a \\"fair-haired choir boy\\" and he stated once that he rejected the idea of having sex for any reason besides love. That started hints at having him \\"lose his innocence,\\" or questions of whether his claimed innocence was even genuine, occurred even then. Starting in the third season, the show's producers stated they wanted to more explicitly have him \\"lose his innocence.\\" Hence in season three he had an affair with crime scene specialist Emma Zoole, who liked having sex in a coffin. She later broke up with him because he \\"wouldn't fight with her.\\" The statement had something of a double meaning as it directly involved his unwillingness to argue with her about their problems, but other aspects of the character implied she also was referring to his disdain for rough sex. The end of the relationship led to his pulling a gun on a store clerk in an irrational rage. In later seasons he explored bisexuality. He did not \\"come out,\\" in the standard sense, until season 7. In the first episode concerning the matter he flatly stated he was \\"not gay\\" and did not formally declare himself to be bisexual until Season 7, but even then he did not want to be deemed \\"a crusader\\" on the matter. This way of treating his sexuality is believed to have made the network uncomfortable.New York Magazine He had a fling with Dr. Cox and a semi-flirtation with Det. Ballard, and briefly dated a closeted uniform cop, but had no serious relationships in the final seasons of the show. During Season 6, Bayliss and Pembleton partnered again, and a drug war sparked by the killing of Baltimore drug kingpin Luther Mahoney led to brutal retaliation against the police department, including Mahoney's nephew, in custody, getting hold of an officer's gun and shooting up the squad room. Bayliss was among the detectives who shot down the gunman, and accompanied Pembleton and other members of the unit in carrying out the ensuing police response. During a gun battle, Pembleton froze when confronted by a suspect and Bayliss, who shoved him aside, was shot and severely wounded. Pembleton, disgusted to find that fellow detective Mike Kellerman had deliberately shot Mahoney and would resign instead of being prosecuted, as well as grief-stricken over Bayliss's wounding, quit the force in disgust in the season finale. Bayliss would return for Season 7, forever changed and foreshadowing his actions in that season. In Season 7, having recovered from being shot, he converted to Zen Buddhism. At the end of the episode \\"Zen and the Art of Murder\\" it is implied he abandoned Buddhism as he feels having to shoot and kill a suspect who pulled a gun made him \\"not a very good Buddhist.\\" Bayliss' sexual orientation and religion had prompted him to develop a website, which was later shut down on request of Homicide Captain Roger Gaffney. In the series finale he is outraged when Luke Ryland, \\"the Internet killer,\\" escapes prosecution as the result of a legal snafu. Bayliss is later shown cleaning out his desk, with the implication that he is quitting the force, despite telling Giardello that he is merely doing some spring-cleaning. Ryland is found shot dead, execution-style, a while later. In Homicide: The Movie (2000), Bayliss was revealed to have taken an extended leave of absence, claiming that he had \\"things to think about\\" and issues (a point on which he is mocked by Meldrick Lewis). He returned to the force to solve Lieutenant Giardello's murder with the help of his old partner Pembleton; afterward, he confessed to Pembleton that he had indeed murdered Ryland, and asked Pembleton to turn him in. Ryland's name is written on the Board in blue to indicate a closed, cold case. The circumstances leading up to that result (Bayliss' arrest or death) are not revealed, but Pembleton later comments that he caught two killers that night. In a Season 3 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, John Munch mentions he once had a partner who took cases too personally and ended up committing suicide; while he does not elaborate further, Munch was briefly partnered with Bayliss during the seventh season of Homicide.

In Bengal, these books were unlike any other book at that time. Writers (Munshis) used to write in Devanagari, Eastern Nagari and Sylheti Nagri. In Greater Chittagong and Arakan, the Perso-Arab script was in use for a short period of time. The pages of Puthis could be leaves, leather, sheets of wood, or barks. This was common before the invention of paper. Usually, they were written on one side and bound with a piece of string. Some sheets were grey or yellow in colour were known as pandulipis meaning pale yellow writing.

Silcrete is an indurated (resists crumbling or powdering) soil duricrust formed when surface sand and gravel are cemented by dissolved silica. The formation of silcrete is similar to that of calcrete, formed by calcium carbonate, and ferricrete, formed by iron oxide. It is a hard and resistant material, and though different in origin and nature, appears similar to quartzite. It is common in the arid regions of Australia and Africa often forming the resistant cap rock on features such as the breakaways of the Stuart Range of South Australia. Silcrete can be found at a lesser extent throughout the world especially England (e.g. Hertfordshire puddingstone), and France. In Australia, silcrete was widely used by Aboriginal people for stone tool manufacture, and as such, it was a tradeable commodity, and silcrete tools can be found in areas that have no silcrete groundmass at all, similar to the European use of flint. Tools made out of silcrete which has not been heat treated are difficult to make with flintknapping techniques. It is widely believed by stone tool experts that the technology to treat silcrete by burying under a hot fire was known 25,000 years ago in Europe. Heating changes the stone structure making it more easily flaked. This process may have been the first use of so-called pyrotechnology by early mankind. In South Africa at Pinnacle Point researchers have determined that two types of silcrete tools were developed between 60,000 and 80,000 years ago and used the heat treatment technique. There is evidence to suggest the technique may have been known as early as 164,000 years ago. The peoples of the African Middle Stone Age (MSA) showed a preference for silcrete tools, sourcing the material from up to 200 km to use in place of more accessible quartz and quartzite. MSA quarries have recently been found in Botswana south of the Okavango Delta. Evidence was found that raw silcrete blanks and blocks were transported prior to heat treating during the MSA. The geochemical signatures of the fragments can be used to identify where many of the individual pieces were quarried.

Today it is urbanistically connected to the neighborhoods of Be≈æanija and Dr Ivan Ribar by the narrow urban strip along Vionogradska and Surƒçinska streets. The settlement itself is built between these two streets, both of which connect Belgrade and Surƒçin and along which a continuous built-up area of Belgrade-Ledine-Surƒçin is being formed.  History  The settlement began to develop in 1961. It was formed as a result of the resettlement of inhabitants from Jatagan Mala, a shanty town in old part of Belgrade, across the Sava river. Jatagan Mala was demolished in the process of city beautification due to the First Summit of the Non-Aligned countries.  Characteristics  Ledine experiences all the problems of the non-planned neighborhoods of Belgrade, mostly concerning communal problems. The population of the settlement was 6,813 in 2011. As the settlement originated on barren meadows outside any urban area, it got the descriptive name ledine, Serbian for the heaths.

Designed in 1944 and operated by two-man crews, it was used by the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) during the closing months of the war, sinking nine merchant vessels and damaging an additional three, while losing 35 boats, mostly attributed to bad weather. The French Navy used four captured boats after the war until 1953. History The origin of the Seehund began with the salvage of the two British X class submarines and which had been lost by the Royal Navy during Operation Source, an attempt to sink the German battleship Tirpitz. Hauptamt Kriegschiffbau subsequently produced a design for a two-man submarine based on inspection of the British boats, designated Type XXVIIA and named Hecht (\\"Pike\\"). =XXVIIA (Hecht)= Like the British X class boats, the Type XXVIIA was designed to carry explosive charges to be laid beneath enemy ships, but it was markedly smaller and had substantial differences from the X class. It dispensed with a dual diesel/electric propulsion system, relying instead solely on electrical power in the form of a AEG torpedo motor, on the basis that since it would operate submerged there was no need for a diesel engine. However, this resulted in a very low endurance of at . Since the boat would need to be able to pass through anti-submarine nets and similar obstacles, it was designed without hydroplanes or fins, her trim being controlled with adjustable weights within the pressure hull. In practice this proved totally ineffective since the weights could not be moved quickly enough, and hydroplanes and fins were subsequently fitted. Submerged control was still poor, since Hecht was not fitted with ballast tanks. Interior of a salvaged Seehund submarine, Bundeswehr Military History Museum, Dresden Salvaged Seehund submarine, Bundeswehr Military History Museum, Dresden Even though Hecht had been designed to transport an explosive charge, Karl D√∂nitz insisted that a torpedo be carried so that attacks could be carried out on vessels in coastal waters. Externally, Hecht resembled the British Welman submarine. The detachable explosive charge was fitted to the nose of the submarine, while the forward section held the battery and a gyrocompass, the first to be fitted to a German midget submarine and considered essential for navigation if the craft was to operate submerged. Behind this was the control compartment with seats for the two-man crew arranged one behind the other on the centerline with the engineer in front and the commander behind him. The commander was provided with a periscope and a clear acrylic dome for navigational purposes. On 18 January 1944, D√∂nitz discussed the new design with Adolf Hitler who expressed his approval, and on 9 March contracts were placed with Germaniawerft of Kiel for construction of a prototype, followed by a further contract for 52 submarines on 28 March. The 53 Hechts were constructed between May and August 1944: in the event, none saw active service but were instead used to train Seehund crews. =Type XXVIIB= As the orders were being placed, Hecht variants were under construction. The first was the Type XXVIIB, which had a greater range, could carry two G7e torpedoes, and had diesel/electric propulsion. The design was completed at the end of June 1944 and resembled Hecht but had a better boat-shaped external casing for improved seakeeping while surfaced, and saddle tanks. Additional room had been made inside the pressure hull by moving the batteries to the keel, while the two torpedoes were slung externally in recesses in the lower hull. A diesel engine was fitted for surface use and was estimated to give a surfaced speed of , with a electric motor providing a submerged speed of . The final variant of the Type XXVII was the Type XXVIIB5, better known as the Seehund (\\"Seal\\") or Type 127. Seehund had a small raised platform midships with the air intake mast, magnetic compass, periscope, and a clear dome which could survive depths of . The submarine's fixed periscope incorporated lenses which let the commander check the sky above for aircraft before surfacing. Production Seehund 075 at the United States Naval Shipbuilding Museum The first contract for Seehund construction was placed on 30 July 1944. Enthusiasm for the submarine was so high that most of the contracts and hull numbers were allocated even before the design was completed. A total of 1,000 boats were ordered, Germaniawerft and Schichau-Werke were to build 25 and 45 boats per month respectively. Other centers involved in Seehund production were CRD-Monfalcone on the Adriatic and Kl√∂ckner-Humboldt-Deutz at Ulm. However, D√∂nitz would not consent to the production of the Type XXVIIA being held up for Seehund construction, while shortages of raw material, labor and transport problems, and conflicting priorities in Germany's economy all combined to reduce Seehund production. In the end Seehund production was undertaken by Germaniawerft at Kiel using a facility which was no longer needed for Type XXI or Type XXIII production. A total of 285 Seehunds were constructed and allocated numbers in the range U-5501 to U-6442. Operational service Captured Seehund submarines, 1945 Seehund midget submarines The first Seehund operation took place on 31 December 1944, when 18 craft set out from IJmuiden in the Netherlands. However, this was a disaster ‚Äì the submarines encountered a storm and only two returned. The first sinking by a Seehund did not occur until February 1945, when a freighter was sunk off Great Yarmouth.Stille, p. 27 Seehunds operated mainly around the German coast and in the English Channel, and could attack on the surface in turbulent weather, but had to be almost stationary for submerged attacks. From January to April 1945 Seehunds performed 142 sorties, and accounted for about 93,000 gross tons of shipping (British sources estimate 120,000 tons).Blocksdorf, p. 135 Administratively, the Seehunds were under the command of Lehrkommandos, which were part of the German Navy's special operations branch. Within each Lehrkommando were subordinate K-Flotilla; K-Flottille 311 was specifically designated to oversee deployment of the Hecht miniature submarine while the Seehund submarines were dispersed between K-Flottille 312, 313, and 314.Kemp, p. From the Allied point of view, the Seehunds small size made it almost impossible for Asdic to get a return from her hull, while her very quiet slow-speed running made her almost immune to detection by hydrophone. As Admiral Sir Charles Little, Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth put it, \\"Fortunately for us these damn things arrived too late in the war to do any damage\\". The last Seehund sorties took place on 28 April and 2 May 1945, when two special missions were performed to resupply the besieged German garrison at Dunkirk with rations. The boats carried special food containers (nicknamed \\"butter torpedoes\\") instead of torpedoes, and on the return voyage used the containers to carry mail from the Dunkirk garrison. The French navy received four units as war reparations, and commissioned them as S 621, S 622, S 623 and S624. They were used until August 1953. Survivors S 622, at the Mus√©e national de la Marine, Brest, France (2004) One of the boats used by the French navy post-war, S 622, is preserved and on display at the Mus√©e national de la Marine in Brest, France.

Credit Island is an island in the Mississippi River on the south west side of Davenport, Iowa within the Quad Cities area. Its name was derived by the use of the island as an early Indian trading post. Credit could be obtained on the promise of hides and skins to be delivered at a later time - hence Credit Island. It was listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties February 3, 1999. War of 1812 On September 4‚Äì5, 1814 the Battle of Credit Island, one of the westernmost battles of the War of 1812 was fought here between Sauk Indians with British support and a regiment under the command of Major Zachary Taylor.Major Taylors battle =Preparations for Battle= Historical reference provided by Sara James Childers British Captain Thomas G Anderson's Journal contains the following entries: Saturday August 27, 1814 ‚Äî At eight the expedition for the Rock river marched. We gave them three shots from the six pounder. At two the Feuille or Leaf (Wabasha) with fifty Sioux arrived on their way to join the expedition. Shortly after, forty Renards arrived for the same purpose. I gave them fifteen loaves of bread and sent to procure a beef that I knew was for sale but the owner sent me word if I would send him two milch cow I might get his ox. I then inquired of Mr Brisbois, from whom I have had every assistance he could possibly give, even to the distressing of his own family. He furnished a pair of two-year-old bulls which I gave to the whole of the warriors. The Feuille brought word that he had met a Renard canoe with two men in it who informed him that a Renard messenger was sent from the Illinois by the Americans with a notice to the Indians that they the Americans were on their way up here mainly to take possession of their fort at Prairie du Chien and not to hurt the Indians, that they the Indians were requested to keep out of the way, that the Americans like hunters in the wood had wounded a deer they had wounded the English and were following the track till they should ruin or destroy the whole. The Feuille heard this report too late to authorize him to take the Renard. The Feuille does not understand the Renard language himself but this was interpreted to him some time after passing the Renard canoe. Sunday August 28 ‚Äî Gave the Feuille ten bushels of wheat to take him with the Renards to the Rock River. A young lad of this place by the name of Antoine du Bois volunteered his service and embarked with the Sioux interpreter. I gave the Feuille a few articles he was absolutely in want of. Fifty Sioux of the Feuille band (The Leaf or Wabasha) with forty-five Renards left this place at two o'clock singing the war song and at six about sixteen puants arrived from above, debarked at the upper end of the village, and walked down to the lower end singing the war-song, then immediately embarked and went off. Wrote a note to Capt Grignon to prepare himself to go off express to Mackinaw to-morrow at ten o'clock. Monday August 29 ‚Äî Finished the dispatches at ten and Capt Grignon being detained in expectation of Mr Antoine Brisbois arriving from below, did not set off till four in the afternoon. Mr Brisbois did not arrive Prairie du Chien Captain Anderson dispatched the following message, addressed to Lieutenant Colonel McDougall from Fort McKay on that same day: > Sir, the command of this post having been left to me by Lieut Col McKay, I > have the honor to communicate to you that on the 27th instant I sent off a > small detachment under the command of Lieut Graham of the Indian department > for the Rock river, consisting of thirty men, one brass three pounder, and > two swivels.

That night, Black Hawk attacked Taylor's pickets and killed two of his men. At dawn, Taylor was preparing to land when three British guns opened fire on his boats. Under heavy fire, Taylor withdrew downstream, with a further loss of 11 men wounded.Gilpin, p. 251 =Black Hawk= The following is Black Hawk's recollection of Campbell's Island. Black Hawk participated in parts of this battle, really a series of small skirmishes on the island and on the river extending from Rock Island to Credit Island; he later wrote about it in his autobiography, perhaps conflating different episodes: > I discovered that one [U.S.] boat was badly managed, and was suffered to be > drawn ashore by the wind.

In May 2010, the city of Davenport received a grant from the State Historical Society of Iowa to conduct an archaeological study of one of the Mississippi River islands near the Iowa shoreline. In 2012, construction began on a bridge on the west side of the island, linking the Mississippi River Trail bike path to Concord Street in Davenport. On May 2, 2013 Credit Island Lodge caught on fire. The lodge was restored in 2015 Previous names for Credit Island =Offerman's Island: 1868 - 1895?= John and Dorothea Offerman had four sons in about 1868 when they moved from a farm between Slopertown road and Harrison street northwest of Davenport, IA and bought the island and renamed it Offerman's Island. In 1894 the county land ownership maps still showed John as the owner of Credit Island. The Mississippi River Commission's Survey of the Mississippi River maps show it called Offerman's Island, survey date August 7, 18951890s Map Plates - Georeferenced Images of Maps Produced by the Mississippi River Commission Offerman's Island was part of Rockingham Township in Scott County, Iowa, United States. Before the purchase it was also named Suburban Island, Grand Island, and Manhattan Island. =Suburban Island: 1904 - 1918? = The island was purchased by private owners, renamed Suburban Island, and was used as a recreational spot for swimming and sports prior to World War I. The city of Davenport bought the island in 1918, and held a naming contest: Credit Island was the clear winner. A golf course eventually replaced the picnic grounds and swimming facilities. In the 1890s, amusement parks opened up on Campbell's Island, Prospect Park, and Black Hawk State Park on the Illinois side and Suburban Island and Schutzen Park on the Iowa side. In the fall of 1904, the name of Credit Island was changed to Suburban Island because of the railroad that ran to the island. In 1918, the City of Davenport bought the island. Davenport Park Board meeting minutes started being documented in 1918, and no mention of the amusement park was made so it likely was gone by then. The island also had a Figure 8 roller coaster from 1905 until an unknown date. The amusement park existed until at least 1917.

He was a professional from 1904 until 1926. In 1919 he became the first rider to wear the yellow jersey of the Tour de France . Eug√®ne Christophe rode 11 Tours de France and finished eight. He never won but he became famous for having to weld together his bicycle while leading. It was one of a series of events that coloured his racing career. Origins Eug√®ne Christophe rode his first race when he was 18 and his last when he was 41 in 1926. He worked as a locksmith until racing took over his life. Tour de France =The 1906 race= The 1906 Tour de France was Christophe's first. He finished in ninth place behind Rene Pottier. =The 1912 race= In the 1912 Tour de France Christophe was denied victory by the system of awarding victory to the winner on points. Throughout the race he was the strongest rider, but the Belgians rode together to win sprints to amass points. Only when Christophe could drop the peloton did he finish ahead of eventual winner Odile Defraye. Christophe won three consecutive stages using this method (including the Tour's longest successful solo break of 315 km to Grenoble). Had the race been decided on time, the result would have been closer - Christophe would have led until the final stage, when he sat up in disgust allowing a group to ride away. As a result, the 1913 race reverted to a time-based classification. =1913 and the Tourmalet incident= Eug√®ne Christophe in trouble on the road In 1913 Christophe was well placed to win when a mechanical failure cost him the race. He rode the first part, from Paris to Cherbourg and then down the coast to the Pyrenees cautiously.Sporting Cyclist, UK, May 1967, p19 He was in second place when the race stopped in Bayonne on the night before the first day in the mountains, when the course featured a succession of cols: the Osquich, Aubisque, Soulor, Tourmalet, Aspin and Peyresourde. The field set off at 3am with Christophe 4m 5s behind Odile Defraye, of Belgium. Christophe rode for Peugeot and his team attacked from the start to demoralise the rival Alcyon riders and, in particular, Defraye. It worked. Defraye was 11 minutes behind at Oloron-Ste-Marie, 14 in Eaux-Bonnes, 60 at Argel√®s. He dropped out at Bar√®ges, at the foot of the Tourmalet, the highest pass in the Pyrenees. Christophe dropped all the field except another Belgian, Philippe Thys, who followed at a few hundred metres. Thys was of no danger, however, because he had lost too much time earlier. The two were five minutes ahead of the rest. Christophe stopped at the top of the mountain, reversed his back wheel to pick a higher gearDerailleur gears were banned in the Tour de France for nearly another 20 years; riders had different-sized cogs on each side of the back wheel. Christophe said: :I plunged full speed towards the valley. According to Henri Desgrange's calculation,Desgrange was organiser of the Tour de France I was then heading the general classification with a lead of 18 minutes. So, I was going full speed. All of a sudden, about ten kilometres from Ste-Marie-de- Campan down in the valley, I feel that something is wrong with my handlebars. I cannot steer my bike any more. I pull on my brakes and I stop. I see my forks are broken. Well, I tell you now that my forks were broken but I wouldn't say it at the time because it was bad publicity for my sponsor. :And there I was left alone on the road. When I say the road, I should say the path. All the riders I had dropped during the climb soon caught me up. I was weeping with anger. I remember I heard my friend Petit-Breton shouting as he saw me, 'Ah, Cri-Cri, poor old lad.'Cri-Cri was Christophe's nickname. It followed the tradition of doubling the first syllable of a name. It is a children's word for a bird and the name became popular when Christophe wore the first yellow jersey, which he and spectators thought made him look like a canary. Christophe was also known as Le Vieux Gallois for the moustache he often had, which made him resemble an Old Gaul, an early resident of France. I was getting angry. As I walked down, I was looking for a short cut. I thought maybe one of those pack trails would lead me straight to Ste-Marie-de-Campan. But I was weeping so badly that I couldn't see anything. With my bike on my shoulder, I walked for more than ten kilometres. On arriving in the village at Ste-Marie-de-Campan, I met a young girl who led me to the blacksmith on the other side of the village. His name was Monsieur Lecomte.McCullagh, James, ed (1976), American Bicycle Racing, Rodale, USA, , p134 It took two hours to reach the forge. Lecomte offered to weld the broken forks back together but a race official and managers of rival teams would not allow it. A rider, said the rules, was responsible for his own repairs and outside assistance was prohibited. Christophe set about the repair as Lecomte told him what to do. It took three hours and the race judge penalised him 10 minutes - reduced later to three - because Christophe had allowed a seven-year-old boy, Corni, to pump the bellows for him. Filling his pockets with bread, Christophe set off over two more mountains and eventually finished the tour in seventh place. The building on the site of the forge has a plaque commemorating the episode. The forks which cost Christophe the race were taken away by Peugeot. He didn't see them again until a dying man bequeathed them to him more than 30 years later.Sporting Cyclist, UK, May 1959 Some reports say that Christophe broke his forks because he ran into a car on the descent. The historian and author, Bill McGann, says: :I have found no mention of a car in Christophe's own retelling of the story. Broken forks were not unusual. I am sure that the poor state of 1913 metallurgy and bad mountain roads caused the disaster. My own theory, based on little information, is that the car story is probably a piece of Peugeot disinformation. It must have been awful for Peugeot to have their famous rider celebrated for having broken a fork. A car crash makes this all easy to explain. The final nail in the coffin of the story is that Christophe said 'I wouldn't have told you then because it was bad publicity for my firm.' If it had been a car crash, there would have been no bad publicity because no one expects a bike to withstand a car crash.McGann, Bill and Carol (2006), The Story of the Tour de France, Dogear, USA, , p42 First world war Christophe became a soldier when France declared war in 1914. He served with a cycling battalion. =1919 race and the yellow jersey= Plaque in the city of Grenoble, celebrating the centenary of the presentation of the first yellow jersey on July 19, 1919. (corner boulevard Gambetta and rue Beranger) In 1919 Christophe became the first man to wear the yellow jersey of race leader, though he was destined not to win the race overall. Christophe was riding with a grey La Sportive jersey when, while leading, Desgrange gave him the first yellow jersey. Christophe said: :So soon after the war, the cycle industry was not yet in action again, and the only marque supplying material was La SportiveA combined team of available riders, its costs shared by the trade to keep alive interest in cycling. and there was little difference between any of the jerseys they supplied. One day - it was on the 482km stage from Les Sables d'Olonne to BayonneThe longest stage the Tour has ever had; it was so long that the race went so slowly that Desgrange abandoned his theory that long distances revealed true champions. \\\\- Monsieur Baug√©, an official,Alphonse Baug√©, charismatic team manager remarked to Henri Desgrange that it was difficult enough for him to pick out the various riders and the public must find it impossible. Couldn't the race leader wear a special jersey? However, Christophe was not at first pleased to wear the yellow jersey as he complained that the spectators laughed and told him that he looked like a canary. By the start of the penultimate stage from Metz to Dunkirk, he was leading by 30 minutes. His fork broke again, this time on the cobbles of Valenciennes and, although being within a kilometre of the nearest forge, he lost more than two and a half hours and the race while he made repairs. On the final stage he had a run of punctures and dropped from second to third overall behind Jean Alavoine. His story captured the public imagination and he was awarded the same prize money as winner Firmin Lambot. His prize - 13,310 francs - came from a subscription opened by L'Auto, the paper which organised the race. Donations ranged from three francs to 500 given by Henri de Rothschild. It took 20 lists in the paper to name every donor.Woodland, Les (2007), The Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France, Yellow Jersey, UK, , p89 Christophe kept the repaired forks in the basement of his home. =1922 race and another broken fork= Placed in the top three and still in with a chance of overall victory, another broken fork on the descent of the Galibier in the Alps forced Christophe to once more walk out of the mountain on foot. =The 1925 race= The 1925 Tour was Christophe's last. He was 40 and finished 18th, 19 years after first riding the race. The anecdote of the race was that the Belgian, Emile Masson, was so tired from long and repeated days of racing that he asked Christophe to punch him in the face to wake him up. Christophe after finishing the 1912 Tour de France. Commemoration The French cycling federation in 1951 placed a plaque on the wall of the building that stands now where the forge once stood at Ste-Marie-de-Campan. Christophe, then 66, re-enacted the day that cost him the Tour de France. He carried his bike on his shoulder, the front wheel in his hand, to the forge. There, wearing race clothes, he played out the way he had repaired his forks. With him were the judge who supervised him that day, and Corni, who as an 11-year-old had helped pump the fire. They were joined by Mme Despiau, the first woman Christope met on entering the village.Sporting Cyclist, UK, undated cutting The plaque on the wall read: :Here, in 1913, Eug√®ne Christophe, French racing cyclist, first in the general classification of the Tour de France, victim of a mechanical accident on the Tourmalet, repaired the fork of his bicycle at the forge. Having covered numerous kilometres by foot, in the mountains, and having lost numerous hours, Eug√®ne Cristophe didn't abandon the race that he should have won, showing a sublime example of willpower. Gift of the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise de Cyclisme \\"under the patronage of L'√âquipe. Christophe's name was spelled the second time, as shown, with a missing H. The plaque stayed there until 2003, when it was replaced to mark the 100th anniversary of the Tour. In 1965, Radio Luxembourg held a party to mark Christophe's 80th birthday. The station announced that he was cycling to the station from Malakoff and, jokingly, said anyone seeing a tiny old man riding a heavy bike through Paris should give him a wave: it would be Eug√®ne Christophe. By the time Christophe reached the studio, he was in a cort√®ge of 100 cycling fans, among them the former world champion, Georges Speicher. The square at Ste-Marie-de-Campan, and a make of toe-clips, are named after him.  1910 Milan‚ÄìSan Remo Christophe is most famous for the broken forks of the Tour de France, but his suffering was far greater in the 1910 edition of Milan‚ÄìSan Remo which was run in dreadful weather with glacial temperatures. There were 71 riders at the start; only four finished in San Remo. Christophe recounted: :The weather had been good at the start of the week but it turned really bad and Alphonse Baug√© [the manager] told us that we'd be going over the Turchino even though the road was bad and covered with snow. Fran√ßois Faber and Louis Trousselier cheered us up by saying 'What does it matter if we've got Lapize and Christophe the two cyclo-cross champions with us?' :The roads were muddy and frozen and we had to bounce along in the ruts, riding on the verges between the posts that were spaced every 20 metres as far as Pavia. We rode the first 32km in 56 minutes, the 53km from Milan to Voghera in 1h 50. There were attacks after attack and it was more like a course des primesA velodrome race in which prizes or points are offered every few laps, producing repeated sprints. than a long-distance race... :We go to the notorious col de Turchino. The clouds were low, the countryside was unattractive and we started to feel the cold more and more. We started to shiver and every turn of the pedals was heavier. The half-melted snow made the race very hard and we were struggling too with a glacial wind. I dropped my friend Ernest Paul to get up to Ganna, whom I could see on the hairpins. I got up and past him without too much trouble because he didn't seem to be standing the cold any better than I was. Not far from the summit I had to get off my bike because I started feeling bad. My fingers were rigid, my feet numb, my legs stiff and I was shaking continuously. I began walking and running to get my circulation back, looking at the countryside. It was bleak and the wind made a low moaning noise. I'd have felt scared if I hadn't been used to bad weather in cyclo-crosses. :Well, I got back on my bike and I got to the top of the col. There's a tunnel at the top and I asked a soigneur how far down I was on the leader. He told me six minutes. I found van Hauwaert at the exit of the tunnel with his bike in his hand and a cloak on his back. He told me he was packing it in. I was beyond feeling happy about it and I just got on with going down through the snow that lay on the road on that side of the mountain. :The view was totally different now. The snow made the countryside beautiful. The sky was really clear. But now it was my turn to have trouble. It was hard to keep going. In places there were 20cm of snow and sometimes more. Each time I was obliged to get off and push. It was cyclo- cross - off, on, riding, walking. I could keep going but it was slowing me right down. Then I had to stop with stomach cramp. Doubled up, one hand on my bike and the other on my stomach, I collapsed on to a rock on the left side of the road. I was bitter with cold. All I could do was move my head a little from left to right and right to left. :I saw a little house not far away but I couldn't get there. I didn't realise just what danger I was in. I just had one thought: to get to San Remo first and I attached no importance to the pain I felt‚Ä¶ I thought too of my contract with the bike factory. I'd get double my wages if I won as well as primes and there'd be my 300 francs for first place. Happily in my misfortune a man chanced to pass by. :' Signor, signor‚Ä¶' Christophe looked at the man and said casa [house]. He took him into the house, undressed him and wrapped him in a blanket. Christophe did physical exercises to get his blood restarted. Then van Hauwaert and Paul came in. \\"They were so frozen that they put their hands into the flames. Ernest Paul had lost a shoe without noticing,\\" Christophe said. :I was there for about 25 minutes. I saw four riders go by, or at least four piles of mud. I decided to press on. Ernest Paul said 'You're crazy.' And the innkeeper didn't want to let me go. I had to trick him by saying I could meet someone who would get me to San Remo by train. I set off and caught Cocchi and Pavesi and I got to the control just behind Ganna, who was setting off as I stopped. I set off again after Baug√© told me I could win and I passed Ganna at the edge of the town. And I caught Albini a few kilometres later. :At the control at Savona (90km) everybody was astonished to see me alone. I didn't stop long and took Trousellier's spare bike, because I knew he and Garrigou had abandoned before Ovada. I was sure of my victory and with only 100km to go I felt a new strength. The idea of crossing the line alone brought back all my energy. I got to San Remo well behind the scheduled time. It was 6pm when I stopped underneath the blowing banner that showed the end of my Calvary.Source uncertain. It comes from a contemporary book with a collection of such firsthand stories, published in English probably about 1915. It took a month in hospital for Christophe to recover from frostbite to his hands and the damage the cold had done to his body. It was another two years before he got back to his original health. Only three riders finished and the result is still uncertain because some reports say van Hauwaert came fourth and others that he was disqualified for hanging on to a car. Cyclo-cross Christophe was national cyclo-cross champion from 1909 to 1914, then again in 1921.An article written by Christophe about riding cyclo-cross is at http://www.blackbirdsf.org/cx/christopheoncx_fr.html Christophe climbing the Col du Galibier at the 1912 Tour de France. Personality Christophe was a short and methodical man who raced with a 20 franc coin, a 10 franc coin, a chain link and a spoke key in a chamois bag hung round his neck. The journalist Jock Wadley, who visited him at Malakoff, said: \\"M. Christophe had a tidy mind. That is why his workshop is tidy, with every tool clean and in its place. His home is equally in order. I had merely to mention some subject and he would go to a drawer, take out an envelope or a file, marked 'Tour 1912' or 'Paris‚ÄìRoubaix 1920' or ' cross-cyclo p√©d√®stre '. Every photograph had a neatly written caption on the back.\\" His race diary dated from the start of the 1920s. A neat, small hand described every race, stage by stage, his impressions, results and expenses.V√©lo, France, September 2000 Christophe said that every night in the race hotel he laid out his kit like a fireman, \\"so that the moment I was called in the morning I didn't waste time looking for my clothes and equipment. Shoes, jersey, goggles, shorts and the rest of it were laid out neatly.\\" Wadley added: :He said not the first time during my visit that he was not a rich man in the monetary sense but had a wealth of happy memories and good health to show from his racing exertions. He still rides a lot, is at most of the touring rallies in the Parisian area, but likes to take it easy. 'I have suffered enough on a v√©lo,' he said, but last year he did 115 miles in 8¬Ω hours, with 12lb of luggage, stopping 10 minutes every two hours to eat biscuits, pears and grapes and drink a glass of Vichy water. Death Eug√®ne Christophe died in the H√¥pital Broussais in Paris. He lived in Malakoff, near Paris, all his life. He was a member of the L'Etoile Sportive de Malakoff cycling club from his first races until his death. Jacques Anquetil awarded him the Tour de France medal at the end of the 1965 race. Christophe was 81.Television pictures are at http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&from;=fulltext#_notice=6&full;=Chapatte%2C+Robert&total;_notices=224 Reputation Christophe never won the Tour, but his stories have become part of the race's mythology. Christophe (like Ren√© Vietto and Raymond Poulidor after him) is celebrated as an eternal second, more famous for his near-misses than his more successful rivals.

The \\"Stott\\" was originally built as a class-A office building located at 1150 Griswold Street (corner of Griswold and State Streets) in Downtown Detroit, Michigan, within the Capitol Park Historic District. It was designed in the Art Deco style by the architectural firm of Donaldson and Meier and completed in 1929. Bedrock Detroit owns and manages the building which began leasing in late 2018 and includes 107 apartment homes and 5 floors of commercial office space. p. 78. History The skyscraper is named after David E. Stott (1853‚Äì1916), an English-born businessman who owned a mill company, the David Stott Flour Mills, and was on the boards of multiple other companies, including the Stott Realty Company. p. 771. pp. 374‚Äì375. First conceived in 1921, the tower was built by the Stott Realty Company in honor of its founder twelve years after his death. Construction began on June 1, 1928, and the tower opened on June 17, 1929; it cost $3.5 million to build.David Stott Building. Historic Detroit. Retrieved January 4, 2014. The advent of the Great Depression brought a halt to all major construction in Detroit: as a result, the David Stott Building was the last skyscraper built in the city until the mid-1950s. p. 41. Architecture The tower stands 38 stories tall, with three additional floors below street level; when it opened, it was the fourth tallest building in downtown Detroit. It was designed by architect John M. Donaldson of Donaldson and Meier in the Art Deco style. The building's design, characterized by a strong sense of verticality, was profoundly influenced by Eliel Saarinen's 1922 Chicago Tribune Tower design. p. 63. Verticality is emphasized by the near absence of ornamentation, and by a relatively small footprint which yields a slender profile. The building rises from a reddish granite base and incorporates buff-colored brick, marble (on the first three floors from the street), and limestone as its surface materials. As with many of the other Detroit buildings of the era, it boasts architectural sculpture by Corrado Parducci. The building features a series of setbacks from the 23rd floor upward. The tower's tiered summit is brightly lighted with uplights on each facade and complements the similarly lighted Westin Book Cadillac Hotel downtown. The David Stott Building neighbors 1001 Woodward to the southeast. SkyBar Detroit opened in 2011 on the 33rd floor of the David Stott Tower but closed in 2015 after the building was purchased by Dan Gilbert's Bedrock Management Services.

He was born in Paris, France. In 1920, says the Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France, he crashed on the stage to Aix-en-Provence and only slowly got back on his bike, dazed and bloody. He could not bend his back and had to turn his handlebars upside down to be able to continue. As his dizziness lessened, he realised that what he thought was concussion was blindness. A flint had gone into an eye. Despite that, he finished not only that day but the Tour, coming eighth despite half-blindness, a broken shoulder and a dislocated wrist. He was carried in triumph at the finish. Nor did he stop racing when he was fitted with a glass eye. Dusty roads made it uncomfortable and he often took it out. The socket would then become infected and he would plug it with cotton. \\"It makes no difference to my sight but it's more comfortable,\\" he said. The glass eye often fell out and in 1924 he had to get down on his knees on the finish line to see where it had gone. He grumbled that he spent more on replacement eyes than he earned in prizes. At the 1921 Tour de France, he finished third overall and won stage 12. He last rode the Tour de France in 1927, abandoning on stage 9. He twice won the marathon Bol d'Or track race in 1925 and 1927.

(more fully Oh, R-i-i-i-n-e-HART!) was a meme of Harvard University student and alumni culture in the early decades of the 20th century. The cry references an unknown undergraduate's call, from ground to dormitory window, for John Bryce Gordon Rinehart (1875‚Äì1954; Harvard class of 1900). His cry of \\"Oh, R-i-i-i-n-e-HART!\\" drifting across Harvard Yard was inexplicably and spontaneously taken up by hundreds of students in the Yard and at open windows of surrounding dormitories. This phenomenon first occurred on June 11, 1900, and for the next forty years cries of \\"Oh, R-i-i-i-n-e- HART!\\" (described as \\"Harvard's rebel yell\\") could be heard at random times and around the world, wherever Harvard men traveled or congregated, sometimes signalling the start of merry revelry. John Barrymore mentioned the \\"Rinehart!\\" cry in the 1939 film The Great Man Votes. The call was included by journalist George Frazier in his 1932 song \\"Harvard Blues\\" (music by Tab Smith), recorded in 1941 by Count Basie and included on the compilation The Count Basie Story, Disc 3 - Harvard Blues (2001, Proper Records). Thomas Pynchon describes the cry in Against the Day: Various legends grew up around the call; for instance, a Harvard man in Africa who was about to be kidnapped by some Arabs supposedly screamed \\"Rinehart!\\" and was rescued because there happened to be another Harvard man nearby in the French Foreign Legion. Origin It is now considered established that the original target of the call was James Bryce Gordon Rinehart (Harvard 1900). A contemporary piece in the Harvard Crimson adds details: As this origin faded from memory, while the cry itself remained current, various false origin stories were circulated. One had Mr Rinehart hiring other students to call his name, to make him appear more popular. These origin stories were collected, and a new one suggested, by Gordon Allport in a prize-winning undergraduate essay.

At the top of the tower is a tall guyed mast for local radio stations WMXD, WLLZ and television station WLPC-CD. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.  History Cadillac Tower was the first building outside New York City and Chicago to have 40 floors, including two below ground. The building also houses the city of Detroit's Planning and Development Department, and its Recreation Department. Cadillac Tower's decorative cornices and parapets are of varying heights. The corner spires rise to a height of , and the spires at the middle fa√ßade rise to the same height of the mechanical penthouse at . From 1994 to 2000, one side of the building featured a 14-story mural of Detroit Lions star player Barry Sanders. The mural was retired after a six-year deal with Nike expired. That mural was then replaced with one of Detroit Red Wings star Steve Yzerman. Currently the building features an ad for the MGM Grand Detroit Casino featuring a lion. In January 2008, the City of Detroit and Cadillac Tower's owner Northern Group, Inc., announced plans for Cadillac Centre, a $150-million mixed-use residential entertainment-retail complex attached to the skyscraper. Designed by architect Anthony Caradonna, the contemporary steel and glass 24-story center would have filled in the currently vacant Monroe Block adjacent to Campus Martius. This project was put on indefinite hold ultimately being replaced by Meridian Health Plan's future headquarters.

He was a three-time NCAA champion and, as a professional, held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, making him a one-time world champion in professional wrestling. Early life Hutton was born in Amarillo, Texas to Bailey and Gladys Hutton. He had one brother, Jerald Hutton. He moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma where he became a two-time state finalist for Daniel Webster High School. later on Dick joined the army and was a veteran of World War II. He attended Oklahoma A&M.; While at Oklahoma A&M; he was the NCAA wrestling champion three times, in 1947, 1948 and 1950 (In 1949 he lost in the finals to Verne Gagne, future professional wrestler). Also while at Oklahoma A&M;, he went to the 1948 Olympic Games. He came 7th in Freestyle wrestling. Professional wrestling career Hutton made his debut in 1952, in a loss against Bill Longson. Hutton left Tulsa, as it was primarily a territory for light- heavyweight wrestlers, and went to Texas. While in Columbus, Ohio, in a territory run by Al Haft, Hutton would wrestle members of the audience. Beating Hutton would've earned the fan $1,000. No one ever won. Hutton developed a friendship with Lou Thesz. Thesz chose Hutton to be the next NWA Champion, winning the title from himself. On November 14, 1957, in Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens 10,000 people saw Hutton beat Thesz for the belt after 35:15, when Thesz submitted to an abdominal stretch. He teamed regularly with Gene Kiniski in Toronto. On January 9, 1959, after a championship reign of 421 days, Hutton dropped the belt to Pat O'Connor. Hutton never really had much other success in professional wrestling. He was criticised by some people for having a lack of charisma with poor drawing ability. However, many other wrestlers praised his wrestling ability.Symkus, Ed and Vinnie Carolan. Wrestle Radio U.S.A.: Grapplers Speak. Toronto: ECW Press, 2004.

History Agonizer formed in 1998 with the six-man line-up of Olli Solitanner on vocals, Mika Heinonen playing the keyboard and providing back-up vocals, J-P Per√§l√§ and Lasse L√∂ytynoja on guitar, Jussi Tikka on bass and Toni Qvick playing the drums, recording their first demo 'Eternal Night' at Studio Jambo in Iisalmi. The demo was received well by Finnish music magazines, and Agonizer followed it up in 1999 with Last Sign of Light, recorded at Astia Studios in Lappeenranta, a studio noted for its favour by Children of Bodom. Shortly after recording, vocalist Olli Solitanner left the band, and was replaced by Pasi K√§rkk√§inen, who lent a distinctly different singing style to the music. The band liked his style enough to return to Astia Studios to re-record the vocals for Last Sign of Light. Shortly after this, they played alongside Children of Bodom, Amorphis and Sonata Arctica at several gigs. In 2001, Agonizer recorded their third demo, Lord of Lies, again at Astia Studios. This demo was also well-received, but it was not until the next year that Century Records in Germany called the band. After negotiating for six months, Agonizer emerged without a contract. Agonizer released Anthems of Agony, a compilation of songs from their previous demos, in 2002. That summer, guitarist Lasse L√∂ytynoja left and Joni Laine stepped in to take his place. Again, the band found a new element to their music. By 2003, their fourth demo, entitled Cain was released. It won 'Demo of the Month' award in Finnish music magazine 'Rumba', and received airplay in England, Brazil, Germany, Greece, Belgium, Peru, The Netherlands, Lithuania, and Spain. World of Fools, their fifth demo EP, was released in March 2004, again to positive reviews. Agonizer were selected to play at the first Finnish Metal Expo, where they reached the finals of a contest to play alongside three other bands after being chosen from a total line-up of 148 bands. However, the expo also heralded the departure of their drummer, Toni Qvick, after what were cited as being 'long- standing differences'. His position was filled by Atte Palokangas. Not so long after Finnish Metal Expo, Mika Heinonen left the band. Band first considered to go on without a keyboardist, but finally informed that Joni's younger brother Patrik had taken the place. In April 2007, Agonizer signed a recording contract with Spinefarm Records. Later on (August 2007) debut album Birth / The End was released with release gig (Heavy Metal Underground +1400) held at Pyh√§salmi Mine, in world record depth (Guinness World Records - Deepest concert underground) of 1410 m. In April 2016 Agonizer was signed to highly regarded German Label 7hard - a Division of 7us media Group - for the worldwide release of their Album \\"Visions of the Blind\\". The Album would be released in June 2016 in Germany and promoted by Derer - Consulting.

The programme was hosted by a variety of presenters, and each episode had around half a dozen guests, often including a member of the public. Guests would be selected to provoke lively discussion; subject matter included \\"the treatment of children, of the mentally ill, of prisoners, and about class, cash and racial and sexual difference\\", as well as \\"matters of exceptional sensitivity to the then Thatcher government, such as state secrecy or the Troubles in Northern Ireland\\"; \\"places further afield...‚Äì Chile, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Nicaragua, South Africa and Russia ‚Äì featured regularly\\" and \\"less apparently solemn subjects ‚Äì sport, fashion, gambling, pop music ‚Äì were in the mix from the start\\".After Dark and the future of public debate, Westminster Institute for Advanced Studies, 3 September 2017, accessed 6 September 2017 Memorable conversations included footballer Garth Crooks disputing the future of the game with politician Sir Rhodes Boyson; MP Teresa Gorman walking out of a discussion about unemployment with Billy Bragg; and Oliver Reed drunkenly kissing Kate Millett during a programme that asked \\"Do Men Have To Be Violent?\\" Other guests included \\"poets and pornographers, spies and solicitors, feminists and farmers, witches and whalers, judges and journalists\\".Enniscorthy Guardian, 31 January 1991 The show ended in 1991 but a number of one-off specials and a BBC revival followed, before the programme finally came to an end in 2003. In 2004 After Dark was characterised as \\"legendary\\" by the Open UniversityNews release by the Open University, accessed 4 June 2014 and in 2014 as \\"the most uncensorable programme in the history of British television\\".Programme notes for the academic conference, 1984: Where Are We Now?, held 23 April 2014 In 2016 The Herald wrote that \\"Unlike reality television live feeds today, After Dark was essential viewing, with some very serious talk enlivened even more by unexpected events.\\"\\"An instinctive look at the world is taken through a glass darkly\\", The Herald, Neil Cooper, 5 January 2016, accessed 13 September 2017 In 2017 the Journal of British Cinema and Television called it \\"an excitingly different and politically adventurous kind of programme\\"David Lee and John Corner, \\"After Dark ‚Äì Channel 4's Innovation in Television Talk\\", Journal of British Cinema and Television, Volume 14 Issue 4, September 2017 and in 2018 an academic history of independent television production in the UK judged it \\"as an 'experiment' that challenged the limitations of television as a medium of intensive and democratic deliberation and discussion it was very successful, and from the vantage of history still seems remarkably fresh to this day.\\"David Lee, Independent Television Production in the UK, Palgrave Macmillan, 2018 From 2010 to 2020 individual programmes were available for online streaming at BFI InView.

In it he selects twenty-six programmes ('a very personal... choice'), including After Dark, which he describes as follows: The programme allowed Isaacs to realise one of his longest-held ambitions. \\"When I first started in television at Granada... Sidney Bernstein said to me that the worst words ever uttered on TV were, I'm sorry, that's all we have time for. Especially since they were always uttered just as someone was about to say something really interesting.\\" After Dark would only end when its guests had nothing more to say.'The talk- masters of television', The Independent, 7 June 1989 From late April in 1987, Channel 4 screened a Nighttime strand, a mixture of films and discussion programmes that ran until 3am on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Channel 4 launched After Dark as an open ended format broadcast on Friday nights (later Saturday nights) as an original piece of programming that would be inexpensive to produce. There was no 'chair', simply a 'host', and the discussion took place around a coffee table in a darkened studio. Due to its late-night scheduling the series was dubbed After Closing Time by the BBC1 comedy series Alas Smith and Jones.The Listener, 21 December 1989 The series was made by production company Open Media. The series editor, Sebastian Cody, talking about the programme in an interview in 2003, said that \\"Reality TV is artificial. After Dark is real in the sense that what you see is what you get, which isn't the case with something that's been edited to give the illusion of being real. Other shows wind people up with booze beforehand, then when they're actually on the programme they give them glasses of water. We give our guests nothing until they arrive on set and then they can drink orange juice, or have a bottle of wine. And we let them go to the loo.\\" Viewer response In 1987, The Guardian wrote: \\"After Dark, the closest Britain gets to an unstructured talk show, is already finding that the more serious the chat, the smaller the audience... Channel 4's market research executive Sue Clench... says that around three million saw some of After Dark in its first slot.\\"Virginia Matthews, The Guardian, 8 June 1987 The audience survey conducted later by Channel 4 reported that After Dark was watched by 13% of all adults, rising to what the research company referred to as a \\"staggering figure\\" of 28% amongst young men.BMRB Survey, 1988 One viewer is quoted in the academic study Talk on Television as follows: Critical response \\"Abortion - Whose Choice?\\", 1 November 1997 After Dark earned a remarkable spread of critical enthusiasm, from the Socialist Worker (\\"my favourite chat show\\") and The Guardian (\\"one of the most inspired and effective uses of airtime yet devised\\"), and The Daily Telegraph (\\"A shining example of late-night television\\"), to more media focussed journals such as the BFI's Sight & Sound (\\"often made The Late Show look like the Daily Mirror\\") and even the US showbiz bible Variety in its review of the year (\\"compulsive for late-night viewers\\"). The Listener magazine called it \\"The programme in which you can see the people think\\".The Listener, 22 December 1988 Guest response Author James Rusbridger wrote in The Listener magazine: \\"When I appeared on a Channel 4 After Dark programme recently my postman, milkman and more than two dozen strangers stopped me in the street and said how much they'd enjoyed it and quoted verbatim extracts from the discussion.\\"The Listener, 27 July 1989 Journalist Peter Hillmore described appearing on After Dark as follows: Notable guests and programmes =Series One= Peter Hain, Clive Ponting, Peter Utley, Colin Wallace and \\"Secrets\\" The first ever After Dark programme (1 May 1987) was described in The Listener: Nancy Banks-Smith wrote in The Guardian: The programme finished with the Beatles singing \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret?\\"'After Kelly', Lobster 55, Summer 2008 The programme is available online here.

Reed drank alcohol during the broadcast; he referred to another member of the panel, who had a moustache, as \\"tache\\" and used offensive language. After one hour Reed returned from the toilet and, getting more to drink, rolled on top of the noted feminist author Kate Millett, who then complained (though she later asked for a tape of the show to entertain her friendsThe Observer, 14 August 1994).

Production =Editorial= The producer wrote: \\"We made programmes about familiar British issues (or 'diseases', as we called them): the treatment of children, of the mentally ill, of prisoners, and about class, cash and racial and sexual difference. Several programmes were concerned with matters of exceptional sensitivity to the then Thatcher government, such as state secrecy or the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Places further afield but just as important ‚Äì Chile, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Nicaragua, South Africa and Russia ‚Äì featured regularly, as did programmes explicitly about the pressures history puts on the present (After Dark noted anniversaries as various as the Second World War and the death of Freud). Less apparently solemn subjects ‚Äì sport, fashion, gambling, pop music ‚Äì were in the mix from the start and turned out to be more serious than viewers might have expected.\\" The main themes of After Dark were listed in an internal memo in 1988: # Lovelessness: the spaces in our society that for whatever reason are cold, empty, formulaic, unfeeling, systematised and filled only with empty rhetoric or silence. # Who owns your body? Do you? Does the State? Your doctor? Your lover? The police? Your parents? This theme covers a variety of apparently unrelated subjects: imprisonment, health care, capital punishment, mental illness, abortion, schooling... # What happens \\"after dark\\"? Sex, crime, astronomy... # Shining light into the shadows we find not only Ralf Dahrendorf's underclass but also the invisible people. Some invisible people are so because they choose to be (criminals, spies, the hidden rich) but others are invisible because we do not want to see them (the homeless, the dispossessed, the mentally confused, the dying...). Among the invisible there is a new slave class: some of those were uncovered by Gunther Wallraff in his documentary \\"The Lowest of the Low\\" (illegal immigrants who are used for clearing up nuclear accidents although the work is known to be fatal). # Do you want to know a secret?

She unionized workers, led strikes, wrote pamphlets in English and Spanish, and convened the 1939 Congreso de Pueblos de Habla Espa√±ola, the \\"first national Latino civil rights assembly\\", before returning to Guatemala in 1950. Early life Moreno was born Blanca Rosa L√≥pez Rodr√≠guez to a wealthy family in Guatemala City, Guatemala. While still a teenager, she organized La Sociedad Gabriela Mistral, which successfully lobbied for the admission of women to Guatemalan universities. Rejecting her elite status, she went to Mexico City in her teens to pursue a career in journalism. While there, she also wrote poetry. She married Angel De Le√≥n, an artist, in 1927, and together they moved to New York City the following year. There, her daughter Mytyl was born. While in New York, the Warner Bros. movie Under a Texas Moon (1930) was protested as anti- Mexican by a group of Latinos led by Gonzalo Gonz√°lez. Police brutalized the picketers, killing Gonz√°lez. The murder sparked a Pan-Latino protest, in which Moreno participated. She later told Bert Corona that the experience \\"motivated her to work on behalf of unifying the Spanish-speaking communities.\\" She was a graduate of the Catholic women's university College of the Holy Names in Oakland, California. Union and civil rights activism The Great Depression struck in 1929, and in order to support her daughter and unemployed husband, Moreno worked as a seamstress in Spanish Harlem. She organized her co-workers, most of whom were Latinas, into a garment workers union. In 1935, Moreno was hired by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) as a professional organizer. She left her husband, who had become physically abusive, and settled with her daughter in Florida, where she unionized African-American and Latina cigar- rollers. She joined the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and became a representative of the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA), becoming the editor of its Spanish-language newspaper in 1940. As UCAPAWA representative, she helped organize workers at pecan-shelling plants in San Antonio, Texas, and cannery workers in Los Angeles. There, she encouraged alliances between workers at different plants. Her leadership was of the type that empowered other workers, especially women, and she strongly encouraged women to take leadership roles in union organizations. In 1937, she settled the Encanto neighborhood of San Diego, which she used as a base for her nationwide activism. In 1939 she was one of the main organizers, alongside Josefina Fierro de Bright and Eduardo Quevedo, of the El Congreso de Pueblos de Hablan Espa√±ola (Spanish-speaking People's Congress). She took a year off from UCAPAWA to travel throughout the U.S., visiting Latino workers on the East Coast, in the Southwest, and allying refugees of the Spanish Civil War to her cause. In 1940, she was asked to speak before the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born (ACPFB). Her speech, which became known as the \\"Caravan of Sorrow\\" speech, eloquently described the lives of migrant Mexican workers. Portions of it were reprinted in Committee pamphlets, creating a legacy that lasted much longer than the duration of the speech itself. In it, she stated, In the same year, she co-founded an employment office in San Diego with her friend Robert Galv√°n. She also organized San Diego-area cannery workers and persuaded employers not to hire scab workers. With the dawn of World War II, the defense industry became a major employer in the United States, particularly in San Diego. Mexicans, however, were forbidden to work in the petroleum industry, shipyards, and other war-related fields, and were relegated to the lowest- paying jobs. Moreno criticized the discrimination, pointing out that \\"California has become prosperous with the toil and sweat of Mexican immigration attending to its number one industry, agriculture. Now they have sustained a true and lasting patriotism to a democratic country that refuses to give them citizenship or even basic civil rights.\\" In 1942, Moreno became involved in the Sleepy Lagoon murder trial, a cause c√©l√®bre for the American left and Mexican-American civil rights activists. Along with longtime friend Bert Corona and attorney Carey McWilliams, she organized the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee to exonerate the indicted youths. In addition to mounting a legal defense, the Committee sought to put to rest rumors about \\"violent gangs\\" of Pachucos and to counter sensationalist reports of urban \\"guerrilla warfare\\" between Pachucos and servicemen. (The press had dubbed the 1943 attacks of Pachucos the \\"Zoot Suit Riots\\".) She also investigated abuses on the part of servicemen in San Diego, advising city councilperson Charles C. Dail on the matter. She invited Admiral David W. Bagley, commandant of the Eleventh Naval District in San Diego, to a meeting of San Diego-area community and labor leaders. Bagley did not respond to the invitation. Continuing to press for an investigation, Moreno collaborated with McWilliams to gather evidence. The investigation outraged California State Senator Jack B. Tenney, who lashed out at Moreno, publicly accusing her of engaging in an \\"anti- American conspiracy.\\" During her Zoot Suit campaigns, she continued to work in the labor movement. In the city of El Monte, she represented walnut pickers, receiving the assistance of the California Walnut Growers Association. One Association representative \\"came to have a high regard for her character, ability and honesty.\\" In 1947, she married Gray Bemis, a navy veteran from Nebraska who had been a delegate to the 1932 Socialist Party of America national convention. Bemis shared Moreno's interest in the civil rights of Mexican Americans, and photographed many of her activities. In the late 1940s, Moreno established a San Diego chapter of the Mexican Civil Rights Committee. In speeches to chapters of the Young Progressives of America, she warned that racial tensions and communist hysteria provoked racial profiling, stereotyping and police brutality against Mexican Americans and other ethnic minorities. Deportation During the 1950s, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) conducted Operation Wetback to forcibly deport Mexicans and Mexican Americans. The operation targeted labor leaders in particular. While she was considered polite and law abiding, her activism earned her enemies. She and her husband began receiving threatening letters for their work against police brutality. Tenney, who labeled her a \\"dangerous alien\\", was instrumental in her deportation. She was offered citizenship in exchange for testifying against Harry Bridges, but refused to be \\"a free woman with a mortgaged soul.\\" On November 30, 1950, Moreno and her second husband, Gary Bemis of Nebraska, left the United States via Ciudad Ju√°rez, slowly making their way to Mexico City. Her warrant of deportation had been issued on the grounds that she had once been a member of the Communist Party.\\"Guatemalan Immigrant Luisa Moreno Was Expelled From the U.S. for Her Groundbreaking Labor Activism,\\" Smithsonian, July 25, 2018. Eventually, the couple settled in Guatemala, but were forced to flee when a 1954 CIA-sponsored coup ousted progressive President Jacobo Arbenz Guzm√°n. After the triumph of the 1959 Cuban Revolution, Moreno spent time teaching on the island. She later returned to Guatemala, where she was interviewed by several historians before she died. Legacy Although Luisa Moreno is a major figure in the pre-Chicano Movement and the American labor movement, her role is often overlooked. Since the 1970s, activists and historians have attempted to reconstruct her role in the movements and give her appropriate credit. Among them are the muralist and professor Judy Baca, who memorialized the organization of Cal San workers in her Great Wall of Los Angeles. The wall, a visual representation of the history of Los Angeles, pays tribute to Moreno by including an image of her face surrounded by images of strikers. Moreno's story has been featured in the National Museum of American History's \\"American Enterprise\\" installation.

Johann Dick lived in Bavaria, and was a former soldier. In his retirement, his hobby was taking tours around the Bavarian border. On September 18, 1986, two Poles attempted to escape from Czechoslovakia into West Germany through the area where Dick was walking (one of the Poles succeeded). Eight guards, who were hunting the escapees, run into Dick, started to fire and wounded him fatally. Later, the guards found out that they had stepped 200 meters into Bavaria, and that the person they had shot was someone else. They dragged Dick into Czechoslovakia, where he died during transport to the hospital. The incident grew into an international scandal. Czechoslovakia first claimed that Dick had crossed the border and that he was shot by Germans, but the evidence confuted that claim. The President of Czechoslovakia, Gust√°v Hus√°k, apologized, Dick's widow was given compensation of 100,000 German marks and the guards were punished, though very leniently (14 days in prison was the longest). In 2001, the case was reopened. The three accused soldiers were eventually let free as it was impossible to prove exactly who had shot the tourist.

The film premiered in the United States on April 20, 2007. Plot Carter Webb (Adam Brody) is a young, soft-core writer living in Los Angeles whose young, starlet girlfriend Sofia (Elena Anaya) breaks up with him. Carter pleads with her to stay, but she leaves. When Carter goes to his mother's home in order to reclaim an item, he sees his mother crying in the living room. She explains that her mentally unstable mother, Phyllis (Olympia Dukakis), claims that she is dying ‚Äì though her doctor cannot find anything fatal. Carter's mother tells him that she will be leaving for Michigan to take care of Phyllis. Carter offers to take his mother's place as caregiver for his grandmother, explaining that he wanted to get out of the life he was currently living and write a biographical story he has been working on for the past eleven years. Though his mother objects to this decision, he ignores her and flies to Michigan. Outside, Carter finally arrives. He knocks on the door with a cheerful remark, and Phyllis, obviously forgetting her own grandson, slams the door on him. After a quick negotiation, she lets him inside. Phyllis reveals that she has been starving herself the past three weeks, and Carter sees that all of the food in her home has gone stale. After a few brief phone calls with his mother and his boss, Carter begins to clean up his grandmother's home. Meanwhile, Paige (Makenzie Vega) and Lucy (Kristen Stewart) Hardwicke, who live across the street from Phyllis, are returning from school. Lucy's mother, Sarah (Meg Ryan), calls Lucy to the kitchen. She hesitantly tells Lucy that she has found a lump in her breast, a possible sign of breast cancer, and is to see a doctor in the coming days. Lucy, shocked, wants to come with her mother when she receives her results, but Sarah quickly refuses. When Carter takes out the trash, Lucy, who is smoking on her roof, watches him. He drops the trash, and Lucy begins to snicker; hearing her laughter, Carter turns toward her, and she hides in the shadow of the roof. Sarah hears the noise and comes outside with her dog, Bozo, and warmly introduces herself to Carter. They have a brief talk before Lucy's friends arrive loudly down the road and Sarah goes back inside. Lucy and Carter meet, and she asks Carter not to tell her parents that she smokes. He agrees, and takes a cigarette from her before she leaves. The next morning, Sarah arrives at Carter's doorstep, bringing cookies and offering for him to walk with her. They walk around the neighborhood, talking about their lives. Carter eventually mentions Sofia, wondering about his love for her. Carter thinks about his relationship, and decides that it really wasn't true love. He explains that he has written love letters for Sofia, pouring out his affection in these epistles. Carter believes that the letters contain his best work. After Sarah returns home, she sees that Carter is heartbroken and needs someone to take his mind off Sofia. She asks Lucy to ask Carter out on a date. Lucy bitterly refuses, calling it \\"lame\\" to ask someone out from across the street that she doesn't even know. Sarah's husband agrees and Sarah abruptly leaves the room, frustrated. She goes to her bathroom, filling a small cup of medicine to subdue her pain. Her husband follows her, trying to assuage the situation by insisting that Lucy will apologize and ask Carter on a date. The next day, Carter decides to go on a run. While running, he has flashbacks of all the memorable times he had with Sofia: their meeting, their first kiss, and so on, until it finally leads to the breakup. When she utters the word \\"goodbye\\" once more, Carter runs into a tree and passes out. When he wakes up, he sees Lucy standing over him. She gives him a ride home and then asks him out. Carter tells her to ask her parents if they would allow her to take him out on a school night, as they normally would not. Lucy, confused, agrees, and goes back inside. Shortly thereafter, Sarah invites Carter on another walk. This time, she leads him into a small patch of forest. She admits that her husband is having an affair and that she does not love him ‚Äì at least not the way Carter loved Sofia. They hug and leave to run errands together. They share an awkward moment of both having something to say to the other; Carter begins with the declaration that Sarah's husband is \\"out of his mind\\". Sarah smiles, and dismisses what she has to say. Eventually, the two deepen their friendship and later, when she tells him she is sick, they kiss each other. Carter also goes to the movies with Lucy and Paige. He finds out that Sofia has been dating Colin Farrell. Afterward, Lucy brings Carter to a football field because he was curious about the typical high school experience. There she confesses that she is sort of dating the high school quarterback Gabe, who is arrogant and cocky, but that they have not kissed yet. They also talk about Gabe's best friend Eric who seems to be the opposite of Gabe; soft and shy. She also confesses that she knows her father is having an affair, but believes her mother does not know. She claims to be more upset with her mother than her father because her mother is cold and more interested in her image than the truth. Lucy later finds out that Gabe could not wait for Lucy and hooked up with her best friend. She convinces Carter to come to a party with her because he is older and mysterious. During the party, Gabe tries to fight Carter, but Eric steps in saying that Gabe is the one who screwed up. After the party, Carter and Lucy share a kiss which Sarah sees. She tells Carter to leave Lucy alone and to never speak to them again. Afterwards, he slips her a letter. Lucy goes to see Carter who tells her that he is not the guy for her and that if she thought about it, she would realize that she would know who is. Sarah gets her cancer treatments and it is revealed that everything will be all right. Sarah and Lucy talk and start to heal their relationship. As Lucy drives home from the hospital, she stops to see Eric who she realizes is the guy Carter was referring to. Sarah finally reads Carter's letter which, though similar to a love letter, winds up being more of a \\"thank you\\" note. Carter comes downstairs to find his grandmother has died but does not immediately call the hospital. Instead, he goes outside for some air and meets up with Sarah. She apologizes and they are able to end their friendship on good terms. The story closes with Carter back in LA at the diner where Sofia broke up with him. He is writing, presumably a script, about his grandmother. He talks to the waitress and seems to be getting on with his life without Sofia.

The six-track EP was originally released as a 12-inch vinyl record through Combat Records in 1987, and later combined with the band's full-length debut, 1986s Game Over, into one CD by Relativity Records. The EP, which is a \\"collection of old and new material,\\" was recorded from December 1986 to January 1987 at the Music Grinder studios in Los Angeles, California with producer Randy Burns. The Plague was originally to be titled \\"Cross of Iron\\" and to have had a cross as the sleeve artwork. However, the band's label Combat Records cited possible objections that may have come from religious organizations.  An ode to M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Vince Neil  Nuclear Assault made fun of Vince Neil's car crash According to Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic, The Plague is probably best known for the controversial song \\"Butt Fuck\\" (later retitled \\"You Figure It Out\\"), which managed to introduce Nuclear Assault's dark sense of humor with an \\"ode\\" to M√∂tley Cr√ºe singer Vince Neil's notorious car crash. The accident occurred on December 8, 1984, when Vince Neil driving while intoxicated hit another car, killing his passenger, drummer Nicholas \\"Razzle\\" Dingley of Hanoi Rocks, and permanently injuring the passengers in the car he hit. Neil, who ironically left the accident unscathed, was found guilty of drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter, but he avoided prison by performing community services and paying a substantial cash settlement to his surviving victims. In an interview with Voices from the Dark Side webzine, the Nuclear Assault's bassist Dan Lilker was asked why the song \\"Butt Fuck\\" is dedicated to Vince Neil, and Lilker stated: > The whole concept of that song was that it was fucked up that he [Vince > Neil] could get away with driving drunk and killing the guy in the car with > him [Razzle]. He didn't do any jail time like you or I would. Just because > he was famous, all he had to do was some community service and do some > public service announcements about drunk driving.

He is one of only eight people who fought in the war to be awarded the Medal of Valor, the nation's highest medal for heroism. He is a former mayor of Ofakim. Biography Zvi (\\"Zvika\\") Greengold was born and raised on Kibbutz Lohamey HaGeta'ot (, founded by Holocaust survivors of underground and partisan combat against the Nazis). His parents were among the founders of the kibbutz. Military career Twenty-one-year-old Lieutenant Greengold was home on leave when Egypt and Syria launched a coordinated surprise attack on two fronts. He was not attached to any unit as he was about to take a course for company commanders. Once he realized war had broken out, he hitchhiked to Nafekh, a command center and important crossroads in the Golan Heights, where he initially helped with the wounded, as no tanks were available. When two damaged Centurion tanks were repaired, Greengold was put in charge of them and, at 2100 hours, was ordered to take hastily assembled scratch crews down the Tapline Road. Greengold's \\"Koah Zvika\\" (Zvika Force) spotted tanks belonging to the Syrian Army's 51st Independent Tank Brigade, which had broken through the line and were advancing unopposed northwest along the road to Nafekh. Greengold's two tanks engaged the opposing T-55s, with Greengold destroying six. His tank was damaged, so he switched tanks and sent his original tank back for repairs. Then he spotted the advancing 452nd Tank Battalion. He engaged the enemy, taking advantage of the darkness and moving constantly to fool the Syrians into thinking the opposition was stronger than it was. Greengold destroyed or damaged ten enemy armoured vehicles before the confused Syrians withdrew, believing they were facing a sizable force. Even Greengold's superiors were deceived; as the fighting wore on, he did not dare report how weak he actually was over the radio for fear it would be intercepted. He could only hint \\"the situation isn't good\\". At a time when Zvika Force consisted of only one tank, Colonel Yitzhak Ben-Shoham, the brigade commander, assumed it to be \\"of at least company strength\\". For the next 20 hours, he fought, sometimes alone, sometimes in conjunction with other tanks, displaying an uncanny knack for showing up again and again at the critical moment to tip the scales of a skirmish. At 2230, he was joined by eight or ten tanks under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Uzi Mor. After being briefed by Greengold, Mor ordered an advance. Most of his tanks were knocked out by a Syrian force; Mor was seriously wounded, Greengold's driver was killed, and Greengold's uniform caught on fire. Greengold took charge of one undamaged tank, while the other two carried away the wounded. He had to change vehicles \\"half a dozen times\\" as his tanks were knocked out. Greengold recalled in a 2015 Jerusalem Post article that at sunrise, he was part of a force of 14 tanks that engaged an entire Syrian armored division, \\"made up of some 100 tanks and 40 armored personnel carriers.\\" When Nafekh itself came under attack from a fresh force of T-62s, he and others rushed over to bolster the defense. In a lull in the fighting, an exhausted Greengold got out of his latest tank and dropped to the ground, murmuring, \\"I can't anymore.\\" Afterward, he claimed 20 enemy tanks destroyed; another estimate places his tally at 60. In 2016, Brig. Gen. (res.) Yair Nafshi told Israeli TV that he had personally concocted the story of Greengold single-handedly destroying a large number of Syrian tanks. Greengold described Nafshi's claim as a \\"blood libel\\". Business career Until 2008, he lived in a Galilee hilltop village. He was one of the founders of the vegetarian food company Tivall and the managing director of Frutarom chemical company. Political career In 2008, he was elected mayor of the Israeli city of Ofakim.

Nikolaus Pevsner, in his book North-west and South Norfolk but the church as probably Anglo-Saxon.Norfolk 2: South & West (1962; 1999) By Nikolause Pevsner (rev. Bill Wilson) the church stands within a circular churchyard with the building on a slight mound which suggest that this could have been a site for pagan worship, later taken over by the Christians in the 7C to curtail pagan worship. The original church may well have been built of wood or wattle and daub. The most recent research has also suggested, like Pevsner, that the current church was built by Saxons but with a Norman influence. This conclusion has been made due to the style and design of the three belfry openings which have all been constructed differently. The east opening has a unique stone frame cut out to form a maltese cross. Within the belfry is one bell which has a Latin inscription which translates to I am called the bell of Virgin exalted Mary, The bell is thought to have been cast by Brasyers of Norwich in the 15th century.

C. Beck for Fawcett Comics. It is led by Mister Mind against their mutual enemy Captain Marvel. The team is significant as one of the first supervillain teams in comics to contain villains that a superhero had fought previously; prior to this, supervillain teams were composed of villains created just for that storyline. In fact, the Monster Society consists of every major enemy Captain Marvel had ever faced. The Monster Society of Evil made its debut in Captain Marvel Adventures #22, and the resulting \\"Monster Society of Evil\\" story arc continued for two years in Captain Marvel Adventures, ending with issue #46 (May 1945). Publication history =Fawcett Comics= \\"The Monster Society of Evil\\" was published in 25 chapters in Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel Adventures comic book. Its serialized format was inspired by the success of the live-action serial adaptation of the Captain Marvel strip, Adventures of Captain Marvel, by Republic Pictures in 1941. Chapter One of \\"The Monster Society of Evil\\" in Captain Marvel Adventures #22 (1943) depicted Captain Marvel learning that a criminal genius known only as \\"Mister Mind\\" - and only heard as a voice over a radio receiver - had gathered many of Marvel's other rogues - including Captain Nazi, Doctor Sivana, Ibac, Nippo, Mister Banjo, and more - to form \\"The Monster Society of Evil\\". After a brief appearance in issue #26, the mastermind Mister Mind is eventually revealed in Captain Marvel Adventures #27 to be a cartoonish alien worm with spectacles and a talkbox around his neck to amplify his voice. \\"The Monster Society of Evil\\" serial concluded with Captain Marvel Adventures #46 (1945), in which Mind is finally captured, tried, and executed. As the first and longest serialized story arc in comic book history, \\"The Monster Society of Evil\\" was hailed as a milestone of the Golden Age of Comics. Individual chapters would later be reprinted, after the Captain Marvel characters were acquired from Fawcett by DC Comics in 1972, in various collections under the trademark Shazam! In 1989, American Nostalgia Library reprinted the serial as The Monster Society of Evil ‚Äì Deluxe Limited Collector's Edition. Compiled by Mike Higgs, the collection was an oversized, slipcased hardcover book strictly limited to 3,000 numbered copies. Fictional team history =Earth-Two version= When Mister Mind came to Earth-Two, he formed the first Monster Society of Evil, which was merely a shadow of what was to come. He gathered known villains like Dummy, Mister Who, Nyola, Oom the Mighty, and Ramulus to make up the Monster Society of Evil. They succeeded in capturing Hawkgirl. Not long after its founding, the other villains tried to kill him and Mister Mind retreated to Earth-S. Without his leadership, the team was quickly defeated in battle by the All-Star Squadron.All-Star Squadron #51-54. DC Comics. =Earth-S versions= First Earth-S version When Mister Mind was transported to Earth-S, recruited supervillains, armies, and entire alien species to aid him in his attempt to conquer the Earth, and first relayed his information from the planetoid Punkus via radio. He began his reign of terror on Earth in 1943, boasting that he and the Monster Society of Evil would give Captain Marvel \\"nightmares from now on\\". This formed the basis of the plot for \\"The Monster Society of Evil\\" serial in Captain Marvel Adventures #22‚Äì46 (March 1943 to May 1945). Mind was not revealed as a worm until Captain Marvel Adventures #26. Mind had many and varied plans to conquer Earth, and to destroy Captain Marvel and/or his teenaged alter-ego, Billy Batson. But Captain Marvel stopped all of Mind's plans, dismantled all of his resources, and arrested, frightened away, or accidentally killed all of his henchmen. Reverse cliffhangers were used in the Monster Society stories, such as Mister Mind about to be crushed under a careless heel or about to be crushed in a paper roller. Finally, a desperate Mister Mind attacked Captain Marvel's alter ego Billy Batson with ether and left him unconscious. But he then realized that without his henchmen, he was practically helpless and unable to kill him. Captain Marvel soon captured the world's wickedest worm and had him tried and executed for killing 186,744 people. Second Earth-S version Mister Mind's alien physiology proved resistant to the high voltage, and he entered a state of suspended animation that was mistaken for death. On the verge of being stuffed for display in a museum, he awakened, hypnotized the taxidermist into creating a duplicate, and escaped. Several future issues of Shazam! depict Mister Mind attempting to recruit new henchmen and reform the Monster Society of Evil, at one point even recruiting a displaced Lex Luthor from Earth-One.Shazam #15 (1974). DC Comics. The Monster Society of Evil was briefly reformed in Shazam! #14 (September‚ÄìOctober 1974). An escaped Mister Mind, hungry for revenge, assembled a new, smaller group which included Doctor Sivana, his evil children Georgia and Sivana Jr, and Ibac. They attempted to attack the Marvel Family - Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr. - with a death ray that created \\"dream\\" monsters using first evil thoughts and later the nightmares of Uncle Marvel. The Marvels end up defeating the Monster Society by convincing Uncle Marvel to dream up \\"dream\\" versions of the Marvels to fight the monsters. Third Earth-S version Mister Mind reformed his Monster Society of Evil one last time in the classic continuity. Their wicked plans were wide-ranging, beginning with an assault on Egypt, expanding to a scheme to reverse the entire Earth's topography, Oggar raising an evil army from the sands and dusts of Egypt for Black Adam to lead, and conquering hundreds of planets and using them to build an army of spaceships. Their plans culminated in a massive assault on the Rock of Eternity, home of the Marvels' benefactor Shazam.World's Finest Comics #264‚Äì267 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1980 to February‚ÄìMarch 1981). DC Comics. =DC Rebirth version= In \\"DC Rebirth,\\" Mister Mind and Doctor Sivana plan to head to the Monsterlands in order to build the Monster Society of Evil from its inhabitants. As King Kid fights the Shazam Family in Philadelphia, Doctor Sivana and Mister Mind are directed to a boat by Dummy who cannot accompany them since he cannot deal with water. When they arrive at the Dungeon of Eternity, Mister Mind states that the inmates of the Dungeon of Eternity were gathered from all over the Magiclands and imprisoned for challenging the Council of Wizards. In addition, Mister Mind stated that the Monsterlands used to be called the Gods' Realm until the day of Black Adam's betrayal which led them to strip the gods of their powers and close the doors to the Magiclands. They find a small prison containing Superboy-Prime in the Monsterlands as Superboy-Prime states that he can hear what Mister Mind is saying. Mister Mind and Doctor Sivana begin their plans to free the Monster Society of Evil from the Dungeon of Eternity.Shazam (vol. 3) #10 (January 2020). DC Comics. Mister Mind senses the fight between the Shazam Family and Mamaragan as he instructs Doctor Sivana to stab his magical eye with a dagger which starts to melt the doors to the cells holding the Monster Society of Evil. Then Mister Mind started to control C.C. revealing to Billy that he is using him as a host and not Doctor Sivana. Mister Mind states to the Shazam Family that he plans to use C.C. to unite the Magiclands under his rule. He then proceeds to summon the Monster Society of Evil leaving Dummy behind who is tricked by Superboy-Prime into freeing him.Shazam (vol. 3) #11 (February 2020). DC Comics. As Shazam fights the Mister Mind-controlled C.C. Batson, King Kull states to the rest of the Monster Society of Evil to leave the women to him while Mister Merry-Go-Round states that he \\"gets the youngest to play with\\" which is what they agreed on. Mary tricks King Kull into attacking the three-headed Crocodile-Man, Freddy fights Jeepers and the Wicked Witch of the West, Darla dodges Evil Eye's attack, and Pedro is in a strength battle with Mister Atom that Mister Atom calls \\"Man vs. Machine.\\" When Red Queen and Scapegoat want a turn, Mister Mind states that they will get their chance once the Magiclands are united. The Monster Society of Evil starts subduing the Shazam Family one by one. The Monster Society of Evil witnesses the spell used to unite the Seven Magiclands being cast.Shazam (vol. 3) #11 (July 2020). DC Comics. As the Monster Society of Evil continues their fight with the Shazam Family, Scapegoat noted to Red Queen that Black Adam was supposed to be part of the group as Red Queen states that Black Adam refused to follow Mister Mind while having plans to get revenge on Alice and Dorothy Gale. When Scapegoat mentions his plans to get revenge on Mayor Krunket, Superboy-Prime crashes the fight where he uses his fists to impale Scapegoat. The rest of the Shazam Family continues fighting the Monster Society of Evil which is watched by Mamaragan. When Shazam punches Mister Mind's talkbox, magic energy is emitted which knocks out the Monster Society of Evil. Once the spell that Mister Mind casted was undone, the Shazam Family had the Monster Society of Evil remanded to a Rock Falls Penitentiary where the Shazam Family built a special section to contain magical threats.Shazam (vol. 3) #12 (September 2020).

The Secret Code of the Monster Society \\"The Secret Code of the Monster Society\\" was frequently referred to in the comic book. As early as the Fawcett comic, readers could mail away for a decoder key for the Monster Society and read the secret messages in the book by translating the messages given to them according to the substitution cipher. The cipher is very basic, in that the ciphertext alphabet is actually the regular English alphabet backwards. During The Power of Shazam! ongoing series in the 1990s, when Mister Mind and the Monster Society of Evil were re-introduced in Post- Crisis continuity, DC Comics had done a similar thing as readers could mail away for a decoder card for the \\"Venusian Language\\" and read the secret messages. Similar to Kryptonian and Interlac, this was a cipher based on an \\"alien\\" alphabet. Various alien characters in DC Comics have been seen using it since. Jeff Smith used the original 1940s Monster Society code in his Shazam!: The Monster Society of Evil miniseries, even titling the miniseries' four chapters with ciphered text. DC Comics' official website provides an on- line tool to cipher and un-cipher the messages. Other versions In Superman #276 (June 1974), an analogy to Captain Marvel from Earth-276 appears named Captain Thunder who is given a compulsion to commit evil acts by his enemies the Monster League of Evil. This League includes Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf-Man, and the Mummy. * In Mark Waid and Alex Ross's 1996 miniseries Kingdom Come, many of the prisoners in Superman's gulag were members of the Pre-Crisis incarnations of the Monster Society of Evil such as Jeepers, Mister Banjo, King Kull, the Crocodile-Men, Ibac, and Goat- Man. In other media The Monster Society of Evil is featured in Batman: The Brave and the Bold. In the episode \\"Mayhem of the Music Meister!\\", Music Meister puts Batman and Black Canary in a death trap where on the walls are names of various DC Comics teams including the Monster Society of Evil. Besides Mister Mind and Doctor Sivana, the Monster Society of Evil consists of Mister Atom, Kru'll the Eternal, Ibac, Jeepers, Oom the Mighty, and an unnamed Crocodile-Man (presumably Herkimer). * The Monster Society of Evil appears in the film Lego DC: Shazam!: Magic and Monsters.https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/lego-dc-shazam-magic-monsters-trailer The roster includes Mister Mind, Doctor Sivana, Oom the Mighty, a Crocodile- Man, Dummy, and Jeepers. The Monster Society of Evil were mostly stealing food to feed Mister Mind. When the Justice League finds the hideout of the Monster Society of Evil, Doctor Sivana uses a chemical to de-age them so that they would be vulnerable to Mister Mind's mind control. With Shazam's and a de-aged Batman's help, the Justice League members were able to fake a capture of Shazam and Batman leading to them defeating the Monster Society of Evil.

Timeline ;1524 Giovanni da Verrazzano explored the East Coast of North America from Florida to presumably Newfoundland in 1524. ;1534 Jacques Cartier made a series of voyages on behalf of the French crown in 1534 and explored the St. Lawrence River. ;1568 Andr√© Thevet's The new found worlde, or Antarctike is an English translation of Thevet's , first published in 1558. Andr√© Thevet was a Franciscan friar who accompanied Villegagnon in 1555 when he went to establish a French colony on the coast of Brazil. He was there for only a few months, but in that time gained a considerable knowledge of the manners and customs of the natives. His observations were considered unreliable by some of his contemporaries and there is still some doubt as to whether or not his accounts can be regarded as accurate. By his translation of Thevet, Thomas Hacket presented the first account in English of a curious American custom ‚Äì the smoking of tobacco by means of burning leaves wrapped in a small cylinder (the cigar), or in a pipe: \\"Their maner to use it, is this, they wrappe a quantitie of this herbe being dry in a leafe of a palme tree which is very great, and so they make rolles of the length of a c√£dle, and than they fire the one end, and receive the smoke therof by their nose and by their mouthe.\\" Thevet's account of this practice is the first clear description of the cigar and its use. ;1576 Sir Humphrey Gilbert published his book, A discourse of a discoverie for a new passage to Cataia. This book, which is an essay to prove the practicality of the Northwest Passage, was written partly in support of Gilbert's still unanswered petition of November 1566 for privileges \\"concerning the discoveringe of a passage by the North west to go to Cataia\\", partly to reassure his elder brother, Sir John, who, having no issue, was adverse to Sir Humphrey embarking personally on such an enterprise. Gilbert had shown his friend, the poet George Gascoigne, \\"sundrie profitable and verie commendable exercises which he had perfected painefully with his owne penne\\"; one of these \\"exercises\\" was the Discourse. Gascoigne edited it and published it in 1576, probably without Gilbert's authority. In 1583 Gilbert landed at Newfoundland and there founded the first British colony in North America. After a voyage of discovery along the south coast he sailed for home, but was lost in a storm off the southern Azores. A year later his patents were renewed in the name of his half-brother, Sir Walter Raleigh.GILBERT, Sir Humphrey. A discourse of a discoverie for a new passage to Cataia.

It has two maps drawn by James Beare, Frobisher's principal surveyor, The rough outline map of the west of Europe, Groenland and \\"the supposed fyrmeland of America\\" wrongly convinced many people in England that the Northwest Passage had actually been discovered. But it was not until the late nineteenth century that the actual existence of a Northwest Passage was proved and only at the beginning of this century that the transit was made. Frobisher discovered Hudson Strait (which he named Mistaken Strait) and returned home with shiploads of fool's gold (iron pyrites) and mica, which finally served as road building material.http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/northwpass/captions1.html ;1577 Richard Eden published in 1577‚Äîthis is not a reprint of the 1555 edition, although, like that, the larger portion is taken up with Peter Martyr d'Anghiera's Decades of the New World, the first formal history of the Americas, and Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo y Vald√©s (Oviedo)' History of the West Indies. It contains a number of important additions not to be found in the earlier edition and appeared after the death of Eden. This is the earliest collection of voyages in the English language and is of great historical importance. It contains the \\"Bull of Pope Alexander\\", in Latin and English, by which the world was divided between Spain and Portugal, as well as translations of the most important parts of the works of Oviedo, Maximilian of Transylvania, Vespuccius, Gomara, and others, pertaining to the maritime discovery of the New World.https://archive.org/stream/referenceguideto030515mbp/referenceguideto030515mbp_djvu.txt ;1581 Augustin de Zarate, the Comptroller of Accounts for Castile, was sent out as Treasurer-General with the first viceroy, Blasco Nu√±ez de Vela, to examine the financial affairs of Peru. During his stay at Lima, he carefully collected notes and materials in his journal and, on his return to Spain, began the compilation of a history of Peru from the discovery of Pizarro to the departure of Gasca. He had access to the best official sources of information, and his work is not without value, though strongly prejudiced. The Historia del descubrimiento y conquista del Peru (The strange and delectable history of the discoverie and conquest of the provinces of Peru) is the foundation of all the subsequent histories of the events to which it refers. This is the first English translation, by Thomas Nicholas, who also translated Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara‚Äôs La conquista de Mexico. Nicholas was employed by the Levant Company in the Canary Islands and spent several years in prison there and in Spain for alleged heresy. On his release and return to England he published his translations of Spanish works which were probably written during his imprisonment. ;1582‚Äì1600 Richard Hakluyt wrote and published his book, The principal navigations, voyages, and discoveries of the English nation.Hakluyt, Richard: The principal navigations, voyages, and discoveries of the English nation. 3 vols. London: George Bishop and Ralph Newberie and Robert Barker, 1598-1600. K.3.2 Hakluyt was a graduate of University of Oxford, where he later lectured on geography. He was a scholar, a collector and a fervent advocate of colonial expansion. Hakluyt sincerely believed that England was obliged to carry the Protestant gospel to the Native American people. To enforce his argument, Hakluyt emphasized the advantages that England would receive if his demand for overseas colonies was met. His first book, Divers voyages touching the discoverie of America, published in 1582, introduced the English-speaking world to the discoveries made in North America by the Cabot's, Verrazano and Ribaut. In 1589, he compiled his principal navigations‚Äîthis is the second, enlarged edition that was published in the following year. Hakluyt's second edition documents a life devoted to the promotion of English colonization and commerce, through an exploration of the less-known or recently discovered parts of the world. The publication has been called \\"the prose epic of the modern English nation\\". The third volume is solely concerned with America and Hakluyt gathered firsthand narratives of exploration for posterity‚Äîits importance in relation to English discovery and colonization in America has been stated.http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Hakluyt_Richard_1552-1616 ;1589 Walter Bigges' is an account of Drake's expedition of 1585-86 against the Spaniards. The king of Spain had laid an embargo on all English ships and goods found in his country, and Elizabeth I had replied by letters of reprisal, and by ordering that a fleet of twenty-five sail be equipped \\"to revenge the wrongs offered her and to resist the king of Spain's preparations\\". The first part of this work was written by Walter Bigges, a soldier officer; he died shortly after leaving Cartagena and the account was continued by Croftes, the lieutenant of Bigges' company. The expedition had been successful in that many Spanish settlements had been plundered and destroyed and a severe blow dealt to Spanish trade, but Croftes describes the difficulties faced by the English fleet, their sufferings from sickness, bad weather, and lack of water. It was only Drake's personal influence, courage and energy that kept them together. This was the voyage on which they brought into England, it is believed for the first time, tobacco and potatoes. ;1596 In 1594, Sir Walter Raleigh, interested in the Spanish legend of the riches of the city of Manoa (Eldorado) in South America, sent out an expedition to Guiana (modern Venezuela). He sailed to Guiana himself the following year and in 1596, after his return to England, sent out a third expedition under Lawrence Keymis. Raleigh's final expedition to South America in 1617 resulted in armed conflict with the Spanish and this in turn led to his execution in 1618. , written to refute those who claimed that Raleigh had never been to Guiana, is a storehouse of first-hand impressions and its influence can be traced in the works of Chapman, Shakespeare and Milton.

Nicolas Monardes was one of the most distinguished Spanish physicians of his time. He studied medicine at Alcal√° de Henares, where Cardinal Ximenez de Cisneros had founded schools of medicine and botany, and which was famous as a centre of medical research at a period when Spain had a high reputation in Europe as a leader of medical science. At the time Monardes wrote his book he had been practising in Seville for forty years; new medicines, still untried in Europe, but by reputation in the Indies, possessing almost magical properties, were constantly being placed before him, with stories of their curative virtue and detailed accounts of their wonderful healing powers, plants and herbs which, according to the title page of the English edition, \\"bring such present remedie for all diseases, as may seeme altogether incredible: not withstanding by practice found out to be true.\\" Monardes was enthusiastic over the medical properties he thought inherent in tobacco and his account rapidly superseded that of Li√©bault whose work had hitherto been the chief source of information on the subject in Europe. Monardes made tobacco a household remedy throughout Western Europe and his gospel was accepted by the majority of European physicians for more than two centuries.

Farrell's biggest chart hit as a composer ‚Äì the McCoys' 1965 US #1 single \\"Hang On Sloopy\\" (a reworking of \\"My Girl Sloopy\\", co-written with Bert Russell) ‚Äì remains one of the most performed songs in the history of popular music, according to the RIAA. Other Farrell pop hits include the Animals' UK debut single \\"Baby Let Me Take You Home\\" (co-written with Bert Russell, #21, 1964) and two 1964 releases for Jay and the Americans: \\"Come a Little Bit Closer\\" (co-written with songwriters Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, US #3) and \\"Let's Lock the Door (And Throw Away the Key)\\" (with Roy Alfred, US #11 in early 1965). Farrell also co-wrote \\"Come and Take a Ride in My Boat\\" (with Jerry Goldstein), slightly reworked in 1967 to provide Every Mother's Son with their signature hit \\"Come on Down to My Boat\\" (US #6). He also co-wrote (with Larry Kusik and Ritchie Adams) the song Happy Summer Days, a hit for Ronnie Dove in 1966. Farrell's Top 40 hit \\"Look What You've Done\\" ‚Äî first recorded in 1966 by the Pozo Seco Singers ‚Äî appears on Carla Olson's 2013 album Have Harmony, Will Travel as a duet with Rob Waller (of I See Hawks in LA). In 1966, Farrell wrote the theme song for Gammera the Invincible (aka Gamera), the American cut of the first Gamera film . Success as a producer came in 1968 when Farrell produced \\"Indian Lake\\" for the Cowsills. The recording of that song written by Tony Romeo was a top ten hit. He produced three other tracks for that family band, including \\"Poor Baby\\" and \\"The Path of Love\\", also written by Romeo. His association with them continued, to some extent, when he was hired to produce the music for the recordings associated with the television show that was loosely based on their life and career. That show, which aired from 1970-1974, \\"The Partridge Family\\", featured the theme song, \\"C'mon Get Happy\\" which was written by Farrell (with Danny Janssen). Seven studio albums connected with the show were produced by Farrell. They included 30 songs which Farrell also co-wrote. Among those songs were \\"Doesn't Somebody Want to Be Wanted\\" (with Jim Cretecos and Mike Appel), and \\"I'll Meet You Halfway\\" (with Gerry Goffin), which were both top ten U.S. hits. Unlike the Cowsills, who were actually featured on their own records, the albums produced under the name of the Partridge Family mostly featured session musicians now known as the Wrecking Crew with backing vocals by the Ron Hicklin Singers. The only cast members who contributed to the recordings were David Cassidy and to a much lesser extent, Shirley Jones. Other recording artists Farrell produced were Elephant's Memory (whose songs \\"Jungle Gym at the Zoo\\" and \\"Old Man Willow\\" appeared in the movie Midnight Cowboy) and singer Lulu (two 1970s albums). Farrell founded Chelsea Records in 1972. Personal life Farrell was born in 1939 in New York City, New York. In 1965 he married Joan Arthurs, and they had a daughter, named Dawn. Farrell and Arthurs divorced in 1972. He was married to actress/singer Tina Sinatra (daughter of Frank) in 1974, and to actress Pamela Hensley in 1979; both marriages ended in divorce. Farrell was later married to real estate mogul Jean Inman and had two children, named Wesley and Sky. (Sky, a collage artist, died 29 Apr 2014 at age 28.) Farrell died of cancer aged 56 in 1996 in Coconut Grove, Florida.

In Lebanon, English and/or French with Arabic are taught from early years in schools. English or French are the mandatory media of instruction for mathematics and science for all schools. Education is compulsory from age 6 to 14. According to a 2013 World Economic Forum report, Lebanon was ranked 10th in overall quality of education, and 5th in science and mathematics. However, these rankings are based on the Executive Opinion Survey, in which business leaders of each country give their opinion on the educational system in their own country. This survey is carried out as part of the WEF's Global Competitiveness Report. According to Muhammad Faour, a nonresident senior associate at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, \\"this assessment is a significant departure from the results of student achievement tests in every international test Lebanon and Qatar have participated. the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and compiled from an amalgamation of international assessments, including the OECD's Pisa tests, the TIMSS tests run by US-based academics as well as the TERCE tests in Latin America, Lebanon ranked 58th globally in mathematics and sciences. In the international student achievement tests in math and sciences (TIMSS) in 2007 and 2011 for grade 8, Lebanese students scored well below the international average of 500. In math, Lebanon scored 449 in both 2007 and 2011. Lebanon's adult literacy rate was 93.9% in 2014 according to the UN Human Development Index, ranking it 65th globally. The percentage of the population as a whole with at least some secondary education (aged 25 and above) is 54.2%. For the percentage of the female population with at least some secondary education, the figure drops to 38.8%.http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/LBN Education System The Lebanese educational system consists of 5 cycles, which are divided among 3 main subdivisions: the preschool, basic, and secondary stages. The stage of preschool education (cycle 1) begins at the age of 3 or 4. Basic education, which is considered compulsory, continues from the age of 6 to the age of 14. It includes two levels: the elementary and intermediate level. The elementary phase includes grades 1 to 3 (cycle 2), and grades 4 to 6 (cycle 3). The intermediate level comprises grades 7 to 9 (cycle 4). Finally, the stage of secondary education continues from grades 10 to 12 (cycle 5). It is usually completed at the age of 18, and ends with a Baccalaureat or professional certificate, of which either can give access to tertiary education. It is worth noting that an estimated two-thirds of Lebanese students attend private schools. In April 2015, the Minister of Education, Elias Bou Saab, acknowledged the myriad challenges and gaps that exist in the Lebanese school system, and the public schools, particularly. While the Lebanese law stipulates that the national curriculum should be updated every four years, it has not been updated since 2000. Plus, because of the national disagreement over Lebanon's modern history, history textbooks cover historical events before 1943 only. The national exams (Grade 9 Brevet and Grade 12 Baccalaureate) were not graded in 2014. =Preschool Education= Preschool education aims to initiate children into the school environment. The goal of pre-school education is to create a favorable climate for children to communicate with others, develop their physical capacities, limb control and coordination of their movements, and educate their senses. Preschool education also takes into account the physiological, moral, and intellectual development of children. According to the World Bank database, the gross enrollment rate of preschool education is 62.5 percent for male, 68.3 percent for female, and 64.4 percent for total in 2006. Also, the private enrollment share for preschool education marked 80.3 percent in 2008. =Basic education= Elementary Level According to the Worlds database, gross enrollment rate of elementary level of basic education is for 96.8 percent for male, 93.9 percent for female, and 95.4 percent for total in 2007. Private enrollment share in elementary level is 67.6 percent in 2007. Intermediate level Primary completion rate of Lebanon (US$6,000 GNI per capita in 2007) is lower than that of Tunisia, Jordan, Iran, Algeria, West Bank and Egypt (all of which have lower GNI per capita). Primary completion rates have not improved during the period 1995/96 to 2003/04. In 2007, Primary completion rate is 79.8 percent for male, 83.3 percent for female, and 81.5 percent for total. According to UIS database, technical and vocational enrollment as percent of total enrollment in intermediate level is 5.1 percent in 2008. Private enrollment share of general education in intermediate level is 60.2 percent and that of technical and vocational education is 56.8 percent in 2008. =Secondary education= Secondary education is three years education, the first year is common for all students, and the second year is either scientific or literature whereas the third year composes of (humanities, economics, life sciences, general sciences) and technical education (about 55 different fields of study). Most schools, however have deviated from this system. They usually do not offer Humanities education, citing socio-economics as a better and more efficient alternative School principals decide students‚Äô path based on students‚Äô aptitude as shown by the first secondary and second secondary years. When students complete three years education, they take official Lebanese Baccalaureate exams in their respective tracks (four in all). Students who finish examinations successfully obtain the Lebanese Baccalaureate Certificate of Secondary Education (Shahaadat Al-Bakaalouriya al Lubnaaniya l‚Äôil-ta ‚Äòliim al-Thaanawi) or the Technical Baccalaureate (Al-Bakaalouriya al-Finniya) In 2014, the Minister of Education passed all students who took the exam, regardless of their score. According to the United Nations Human Development Index, the gross enrollment rate for secondary school is 74%. Palestinian refugees in Lebanon have limited access to public secondary education. Most of them are not able to afford the high cost of private secondary education. UNRWA operates three secondary schools in Beirut, Saida and Tyre. School operated by UNRWA partially offset the absence of available educational opportunities at the secondary school level. (UNRWA website) According to the World Bank database, gross enrollment rate of secondary education is 69.8 percent for male, 80.2 percent for female, and 74.9 percent for total. According to UIS database, technical and vocational enrollment as percent of total enrollment in secondary level is 27.8 percent in 2008. Private enrollment share of general education in intermediate level is 49.8 percent and that of technical and vocational education is 56.9 percent in 2008. Lebanon participated in TIMSS in 2003 and 2007. Score of mathematics at 8th grade is 433 in 2003 and 449 in 2007. Score of science at 8th grade is 435 in 2003 and 404 in 2007. At the end of middle school, each student has to enter the official exams. =Tertiary Education= Tertiary education in Lebanon is composed of Technical and Vocational Institutes, University colleges, University Institutes and Universities. The Lebanese University is the only public institution. The Ministry of Education and Higher Education administrates the private and public sectors and Technical and Vocational Institutes are under the Directorate General of Technical and Vocational Education Directorate General of Higher Education has responsibility for University Colleges, University Institutes and Universities). According to the World Bank database, gross enrollment rate of tertiary education (the percentage of students who go on to tertiary education within five years of completing secondary education) was 48% in 2013. With university graduates making up 30% of people seeking a job,Youth Economic Forum, Youth Employment: Towards an Improved Regulation of the Labor Market, 2012 it is clear that the Higher Education system needs to play a key role in resolving the problem of youth unemployment in Lebanon. The key issue related to this sector is the mismatch between the highly skilled graduates that universities supply and the skills and professionals the labor market demands; these supply-demand failings in the labor market are increasingly preventing young people from finding a job in their country that fits their qualifications.Di Bartolomeo, Anna, Tamirace Fakhoury, and Delphine Perrin. CARIM ‚Äì Migration Profile. European University Institute ‚Äì Robert Schuman Centre For Advanced Studies, 2010 In order to address these issues, universities can implement policies to reform the curricula to better prepare graduates for their professional life, improve career guidance structures and activities, and invest in relevant research, statistics and data gathering. Lebanon has 41 nationally accredited universities, several of which are internationally recognized. The American University of Beirut (AUB) and the Universit√© Saint-Joseph (USJ) were the first Anglophone and the first Francophone universities to open in Lebanon respectively. The majority of the forty-one universities, both public and private, largely operate in French or English, the two most widely used foreign languages in Lebanon. At the English universities, students who have graduated from an American-style high school program enter at the freshman level to earn their baccalaureate equivalence from the Ministry of Education and Higher Education. This qualifies them to continue studying at the higher levels. Such students are required to have already taken the SAT I and the SAT II (Subjects Test) upon applying to college, in lieu of the official exams. On the other hand, students who have graduated from a school that follows the Lebanese educational system are directly admitted to the sophomore year. These students are still required to take the SAT I, but not the SAT II. The highest-ranked universities in Lebanon include the American University of Beirut (AUB), the Lebanese American University (LAU), the Universit√© Saint- Joseph (USJ), the Lebanese University (LU), the University of Balamand (UOB), the Universit√© Saint-Esprit de Kaslik (USEK), Beirut Arab University (BAU), the American University of Science and Technology (AUST), the Lebanese international university (LIU) , and the Notre Dame University - Louaize (NDU), QS Top Universities ranks AUB second in the Arab region (the only Lebanese university to rank among the region's top 10), and 268 globally. The THE (Times Higher Education) World University Rankings 2015-2016 place the American University of Beirut between 501 and 600 in its rankings, while the Center for World University Rankings places AUB at 682 in its global rankings; AUB is the only Lebanese university to make either of these lists. Not all private higher educational institutions in Lebanon consider SAT I or SAT II for undergraduate admissions. The majority require a local entrance test prepared by these individual higher educational institutions. In most times, the entrance test is a placement test. The main requirement for undergraduate admissions for Lebanese students is the secondary-school leaving certificate called the Baccalaureate II or more recently the International Baccalaureate. However, students with a foreign nationality are admitted to private higher education institutions that pattern after the American system of higher education as Freshman students in case they do not have an equivalence to the Baccalaureate II. In case they obtain an equivalence from the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, they are admitted as sophomore students. As for the Lebanese University, which is the only public higher educational institution in Lebanon, students are admitted to undergraduate programs based on the Baccalaureate II certificate. A number of faculties at the Lebanese University, such as the Faculty of Sciences, require further testing for selectivity based on entrance tests (concours) prepared and administered by this faculty.

Education Management The Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MOEHE) regulates all education institutes in the public sector through a regional education system. The education system in Lebanon is centralized, and this regulation is not direct. The education system is managed through regional education bureaus. Public schools are monitored by the regional education bureaus in the governorates. The regional education bureau serves as liaisons between the public school and the directorates of education at the ministry's headquarters. Private schools have their own organization, but private schools are still subject to the authority of the MOEHE. The Center for Educational Research and Development (CERD) is an autonomous staff organization under the trusteeship of the MOEHE. CERD's tasks are 1) to draft curricula of academic and vocational education for the pre-university education stage, 2) to revise and modify the curricula according to the necessity, 3) to prepare all means and ways for applying these curricula, 4) to do educational research, 5) to secure training for pre- university teachers, 6) to prepare the curricula in all subject areas, 7) to provide teacher training, 8) to write textbooks, and 9) to conduct evaluations, etc. Education Finance According to the United Nations Human Development Index 2014, public education expenditure as percentage of GDP is 1.65 in 2014. Public schools are financed by the Ministry of Education and private schools are financed by students' fees. The processes involved curricula draft and modification, and teacher training are mainly financed by nongovernment funds such as private companies or international bodies which include the World Bank and the UNDP. Curriculum The Lebanese curriculum is used at all public and private schools in Lebanon. Schools have to apply both the Lebanese and foreign schemes at the same time when they will implement a foreign curriculum (French, English, or international) in a school. Syrian Refugees in Lebanese Schools The Syrian crisis has placed a large burden on Lebanese public schools. There are nearly 400,000 school-aged refugee children in Lebanon, which is roughly 25% more than the number of Lebanese students in Lebanese public schools. Only an estimated 30% of the Syrian refugee school- aged children are receiving an education. In addition to barriers to access and other challenges, a significant barrier to integration is language: Syrian schools are taught in Arabic, while Lebanese public schools incorporate both French and English.file:///C:/Users/Luc/Downloads/6-EducationUNHCRMonthlyUpdate- December2014.pdf In 2014, 104,000 Syrian refugee students were taught in Lebanese schools. In 2015, the Ministry of Education aimed to double the number of Syrian children in public schools to 200,000 students.

He married D'Oyly Carte chorister Geraldine Thompson. Life and career Thorne was born in Chertsey, Surrey, England. His father was Richard Samuel Thorne, who managed the Surrey Theatre. His elder brother, Thomas Thorne, was an actor and theatre manager, best known as a founding manager of London's Vaudeville Theatre. His nephew was the actor Frank Gillmore, and his great-nieces were the actresses Ruth Gillmore and Margalo Gillmore. =Early career= Thorne began his stage career at the age of two, when he was carried on at the Theatre Royal, Margate, in the burlesque Medea. Early engagements followed with his sister, Sarah Thorne's, company, (1870-73); John Coleman's stock company in Leeds (1873); the Covent Garden pantomime (1874-75); and at the Corinthian Theatre, Calcutta, where he reportedly played 104 parts in six months in 1876. =D'Oyly Carte years= as Robin in Ruddigore Thorne joined a D'Oyly Carte touring company in 1881, playing Captain Felix Flapper in Billee Taylor. Later in 1881, back in England, he toured as Reginald Bunthorne in Patience. In 1882-83, he toured as Blood-red Bill in Edward Solomon and Henry Pottinger Stephens's Claude Duval and then as Bunthorne. In 1883, Thorne married actress Beatrice Thomas, who toured with Thorne as a chorister in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company under the stage name Geraldine Thompson.\\"Judy, or the London serio-comic journal\\", Volume 33, p. 205, 31 October 1883Stone, David.

George Thorne, Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 August 2001, accessed 17 May 2018 In 1885, Thorne traveled to New York to present The Mikado at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, where the company played until 1886. This production also included Geraldine Ulmar as Yum-Yum, Courtice Pounds as Nanki-Poo, and Fred Billington as Pooh-Bah. While in New York, Arthur Sullivan wrote a special comic orchestration for Thorne (stressing the bassoon part) as an encore to \\"The Flowers that Bloom in the Spring\\" (preserved in Sullivan's autograph score), performed in pantomime. Later, other D'Oyly Carte artists performed a pantomime encore.DeOrsey, Stan. \\"Gilbert & Sullivan: Of Ballads, Songs and Snatches ‚Äì Lost or seldom recorded\\", Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 2003, accessed 7 January 2018 Returning from America in 1886, Thorne toured the British provinces and Europe as Sir Joseph and Ko-Ko until 1887. He then returned to England to rehearse the new opera, Ruddigore. He gave two matinee performances as Robin Oakapple at the Savoy Theatre and then traveled to New York again to play Robin there with substantially the same troupe that had played in The Mikado in New York in 1885‚Äì86. From 1887 to 1890 (with a break in late 1889 to early 1890, when he contracted typhoid fever), he toured playing Bunthorne, Ko-Ko, Sir Joseph, and later the Major General and Jack Point in The Yeomen of the Guard. Thorne originated the tragic ending for that character, which was later adopted by most portrayers of the role. He said that Point was his favourite of the roles.Jones, pp. 59-62 From 1890 to 1896, Thorne was the principal comedian with a D'Oyly Carte touring company, playing John Wellington Wells in The Sorcerer, Sir Joseph, the Major General, Bunthorne, the Lord Chancellor, King Gama in Princess Ida, Ko-Ko, Jack Point, and the Duke of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers. He also played Bumbo in The Nautch Girl (1892). From 1896 to 1897, he was on the first D'Oyly Carte tour of South Africa, playing his usual roles, as well as Scaphio in Utopia Limited and Rudolph in The Grand Duke. He then toured in Britain in 1898 to 1899. Thorne says, in his memoir Jots (1897), that he had occasions to play the Judge in Trial by Jury, which would mean that he played the leading comic role in all 13 extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas, but he doesn't say when or where.Thorne, p. 87 Thorne died in Edlesborough, Bedfordshire at the age of 66. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London. =Playwright and author= Thorne wrote several pantomimes, some burlesques, two comic operas, and adaptations of several of Charles Dickens's novels for the stage.

While there, he became part of the Romanian revolutionary circles. In 1853 he has his first display at the Salon in Paris, showing his Autoportrait. While in Paris, he became friends with other like- minded artists and Romanian revolutionaries such as Nicolae BƒÉlcescu, and the writers Dimitrie Bolintineanu, and Cezar Bolliac. In this environment, influenced by revolutionary ideas, Aman completed the historical themed painting ‚ÄúMihai VIteazul‚Äôs First Night‚Äù, which was inspired by the writings of Bolintineanu. As a result of his strong patriotic sentiments, he participated in the Romanian Revolution of 1848 along with Ioan Maiorescu, Eugeniu Carada, and other revolutionaries. After that, he went to Istanbul in an effort to sell some paintings to the Sultan and visited Sevastopol during the Crimean War, creating history paintings with themes related to Romania's nationalist aspirations. In 1855, he presented one of his best-known works, depicting the Battle of Alma, at the Exposition Universelle. He returned to Romania in 1857, settling in Bucharest where he starts the foundation of his school the Bucharest National University of Arts. When he returned home, he was knighted by Prince Barbu Dimitrie »òtirbei and presented with a scholarship to continue his studies in Paris, where he came under the influence of the Barbizon school. After a brief stay in Rome, he returned to Bucharest.

Designed in the Neo-Renaissance style, and constructed as the Book-Cadillac, it is part of Westin Hotels and embodies Neo-Classical elements and building sculpture, incorporating brick and limestone. Among its notable features are the sculptures of notable figures from Detroit's history‚ÄîGeneral Anthony Wayne, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, Chief Pontiac, and Robert Navarre along the ornate Michigan Avenue fa√ßade and copper-covered roof elements. The flagship hotel is tall with 31 floors, and includes 65 exclusive luxury condominiums and penthouses on the top eight floors. It reopened in October 2008 after completing a $200-million reconstruction project and contains the Roast restaurant and 24 Grille. History Old Cadillac Hotel, c. 1915 The Book Cadillac Hotel in an old postcard The hotel was developed by the Book Brothers‚ÄîJ. Burgess, Frank, and Herbert. The brothers sought to turn Detroit's Washington Boulevard into the \\"Fifth Avenue of the West.\\" Part of that vision was the creation of a flagship luxury hotel to compete against the Detroit Statler Hotel three blocks to the north. They commissioned architect Louis Kamper, who designed their Book Building in 1917, to design the building. In 1917, the brothers bought the old Cadillac Hotel at the northeast corner of Michigan and Washington Blvd., but World War I material shortages delayed the start of work on their new hotel. Construction finally began in 1923, and the building, which bore part of the name of the old structure, was the tallest in the city and the tallest hotel in the world when it opened in December 1924. The hotel cost $14 million to build and contained 1,136 guest rooms. Public spaces on the first five floors included three dining rooms, three ballrooms, a spacious lobby, and a ground floor retail arcade. On the hotel's top floor was radio station WCX, the predecessor to WJR. The hotel operated successfully until the Great Depression, when banks foreclosed and the Book brothers lost control in 1931. For much of the period after the Books lost ownership, the hotel was run by hotel industry pioneer Ralph Hitz's National Hotel Management Company. On May 2, 1939, a meeting took place in the hotel lobby between New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig and team manager Joe McCarthy in which Gehrig told McCarthy to leave him out of the starting line-up from that day's game, ending his 2,130 consecutive games streak. In 1951, Sheraton bought the hotel, renamed it the Sheraton-Cadillac Hotel, and undertook massive renovations. All public spaces except the ballrooms and Italian Garden were redone and escalators replaced the grand staircase. In 1975, with business declining and the hotel in need of another renovation, Sheraton sold the building to Herbert R. Weissberg and it became the Detroit-Cadillac Hotel. Ownership changed again in 1976, and it became the Radisson-Cadillac Hotel. In 1979 the Radisson chain sold the property, and it became the Book-Cadillac once again. Though it had been considered the city's top hotel for many years, the owners announced that the hotel would close due to declining occupancy. The city of Detroit, scheduled to host the 1980 Republican National Convention, did not want to face the prospect of losing more downtown hotel space, so in late 1979 the city entered into a partnership through the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation with the owners to keep the hotel open. By 1983, it was decided that the only way to bring the hotel back to profitability was to convert it into a mixed-use property. The hotel's 1100 rooms were deemed too numerous to fill and were too small by modern standards. The plan would turn the building into the Book-Cadillac Plaza, a 12 floor, 550-room hotel and 11 floors of office space. The hotel closed its doors in October 1984 for the renovation, but those plans were quickly dashed as proposed construction cost soared, and Detroit's economic situation continued to deteriorate. For the next two years developers came and went. But with no one able to take on the increasingly complex renovation, in 1986 the contents were liquidated. After the sale, the hotel's retail tenants who had planned to stay through the renovation moved out and the building was shuttered, a state in which it would remain for the next 20 years. Time passed and the unmaintained property fell victim to time, the elements, vandalism, and urban scavengers. Restored interior In July 2003, after years of legal battles to fully acquire the building and to find a developer, the city of Detroit announced a $150 million renovation deal with Historic Hospitality Investments a subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark to turn the building into a Renaissance Hotel. Work started shortly after the announcement but came to a halt in November when construction crews discovered more damage than anticipated. The associated cost overrun caused Kimberly-Clark to back out of the deal. A new renovation plan through the Cleveland-based Ferchill Group was announced in June 2006, with the Book-Cadillac to become a Westin Hotel and Residences. Kaczmar Architects Inc. of Cleveland and interior design firm ForrestPerkins of Dallas completed design and historic renovation work on the project from August 2006 through to completion in the fall of 2008, with a grand opening celebration held on October 25, 2008. Architecture Architect Louis Kamper designed the hotel in the Renaissance Revival style at the corner of Washington Boulevard and Michigan Avenue. Abutting the hotel on the north was the headquarters of the Detroit Edison Company. The structure is a steel skeleton faced with beige brick and limestone accents. Detail of the Michigan Avenue fa√ßade The lower six floors are clad in limestone. On the ground floor it is carved into wide horizontal bands while floors two through five are smooth. Corinthian pilasters and columns separate the windows of the public rooms from the second to fifth floors with windows for the second and third floors contained in large arches. Windows on the fourth floor are framed by small balconies. Above the sixth floor, the exterior is beige brick with cornices at floors 7, 16 and 21. Ionic columns frame windows on floors 23 through 25. A large cornice encircled the 27th floor and was removed during an earlier renovation. Limestone quoins accent three corners of the building which are capped with copper-clad ziggurats. The north and south sides have penthouse towers that extend to the 31st floor. When the north penthouse was reconstructed, it was built shorter to make the zigurrats the highest points of the building. The building sits atop three basements, which contain some inoperable mechanical equipment too large to remove during renovation. On June 27, 2006, the Ferchill Group agreed to renovate the structure into a mixed-use hotel and condominium building including a 453-room Westin Hotel, and 65 condominium units priced above $280,000. ForrestPerkins completed interior designs for the project which cost $176 million and was completed in fall 2008. As part of the renovation some of the original decor of the Grand Ballroom (renamed the Venetian Ballroom) and Italian Garden was recreated. A three-story addition containing a new ballroom, pool, hot-tub, fitness center, spa, and additional conference space was built north of the hotel on the site previously occupied by the Detroit Edison Headquarters. Across Shelby Street from the hotel, the Peoples' Outfitting building, also known as the Detroit Commerce Building, was demolished and replaced with a 10-story parking garage for hotel guests and residents. In 2017, apartments were built above the parking garage. In popular culture The Book-Cadillac was Detroit's tallest building, and the tallest hotel in the world, when it opened in 1924. The bar and coffee shop played court to Detroit's notorious Purple Gang, whose leader Abe Bernstein maintained a residence on the top floor until his death in 1968. On May 2, 1939, New York Yankee first baseman Lou Gehrig collapsed on the hotel's grand staircase. Gehrig, who would later be diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, decided to sit-out that afternoon's game against the Detroit Tigers, ending his consecutive games played streak. The 1947 Frank Capra movie State of the Union featured scenes that were filmed at the hotel. Scenes in the 1973 cult movie Detroit 9000 were shot at the hotel. The HGTV show House Hunters aired an episode entitled \\"Settling Down in Detroit\\" in which a couple searches for a historic home in Detroit. They end up choosing one of the newly restored condos in the hotel. Michael Symon, who has appeared on four Food Network/Cooking Channel shows as a host and a judge, owns and operates the Roast restaurant at the Westin Book Cadillac Hotel in Detroit. He has hosted the shows Food Feuds and Cook Like an Iron Chef. The hotel, or rather, its 28th penthouse suite was mentioned in restaurant critic Gael Greene's biography, entitled \\"Insatiable\\" as the place where she, inter- alia, interviewed the then 22 year old Elvis Presley after the second of his two shows at the Olympia Stadium on March 31, 1957.

He succeeded his father, Anak Agung Putu Djelantik, in 1944. On the last page of Pandji Tisna's book, I Made Widiadi, written in 1955, he wrote his life story in chronological order. He was a writer and a novelist. He refused to be the king of Buleleng, but being the eldest son, the Japanese occupancy troops forced him to be \\"syucho\\" after the death of his father in 1944. During his reign, he became the leader of the Council of Kings of all of Bali from 1946 to 1947 (Paruman Agung) and the Regent of Buleleng. In 1947, because his uniquely Christian faith did not fit in with the predominant Hindu religion, Pandji Tisna surrendered the throne to his younger brother, Anak Agung Ngurah Ketut Djelantik or I Gusti Ketut Djelantik, also known as Meester Djelantik, until 1949. He died 2 June 1978 and was buried in the graveyard on the eastern side of his land near the chapel he built years before. Early years Anak Agung Pandji Tisna was born to Anak Agung Putu Djelantik and his wife Jero Mekele Rengga. Pandji Tisna received his formal education in a primary school in Singaraja and continued his education in a middle school in Batavia. Career Pandji Tisna is best known as a novelist. His novels, all of which are placed in Bali, especially in Singaraja, his birthplace, were published by Balai Pustaka. Many of his short stories were published in the Terang Bulan magazine in Surabaya. He also wrote poems, such as Ni Poetri, which was published by Sutan Takdir Alisyahbana in Poedjangga Baroe magazine in Jakarta. Pandji Tisna had a varied career as a merchant, secretary to his father, headmaster of elementary school, editor of Jatayu magazine, and farmer, before succeeding to the throne on the death of his father on 25 July 1944. He was Chair of the Balinese Council of Kings from 1946‚Äì1947, but abdicated in favour of his brother, Meester Djelantik, in 1947. He was a member of the Provisional Parliament of the State of East Indonesia from 1946‚Äì1948. Development of the Balinese tourist industry Pandji Tisna is also remembered as a pioneer of Balinese tourism, especially in the northern beach district. In 1953, he chose Desa Tukad Cebol (now Desa Kaliasem [Kaliasem Village]) as his holiday home. There he wrote and received both local and foreign guests. He named his holiday home Lovina, which is an abbreviation of words Love Indonesia. He then built several guest houses in the western coast in Buleleng. The whole area then became known as Pantai Lovina, or Lovina Beach in English. For this reason, he is accredited as \\"The Father of Balinese Tourism\\". In 2003, the Balinese government posthumously awarded him the Karya Karana Award in recognition of his services to the development of Balinese tourism. Family Pandji Tisna had four wives, Anak Agung Istri Manik, with whom he had two sons; Ni Ketut Mayas (Jero Mekele Seroja), with whom he had two sons and 1 daughter; Luh Sayang (Mekele Sadpada), with whom he had two sons ; and Jro Mekele Resmi, with whom he had 4 sons and two daughters.

The organization claims that the protection is necessary due to damages caused by unauthorized border crossers, which it characterizes as terrorist. It also claims that the government has willfully and intentionally failed to protect property owners. At one time, Ranch Rescue featured a web site with links to news articles and opinion pieces regarding the U.S.-Mexico border. It also served as a recruitment tool for future members of the group. Ranch Rescue has had chapters in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Kentucky, New Mexico, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia. As of 2003, its largest chapter in Arizona had disbanded. Generally, Ranch Rescue operates on private property at the behest of the owners. When a landowner requests protection from the organization, Ranch Rescue operatives set up a military-style operation on the property and terms it as such. The operatives use electronic surveillance equipment, binoculars, flares, two-way radios, trained dogs, and firearms and other weapons. Legal issues An operation at Sutton Ranch in Jim Hogg County, Texas, was termed \\"Operation Falcon\\". On March 18, 2003, Fatima Del Socorro Leiva Medina and Edwin Alfredo Mancia Gonzales, illegal immigrants from El Salvador, alleged that they were chased, detained, threatened, robbed and assaulted by Ranch Rescue operatives after being caught trespassing on the property. One operative, Henry Mark Conner, allegedly aimed a rifle at Leiva and Mancia during the incident. He and Casey James Nethercott, another operative, were indicted on charges of aggravated assault and unlawful restraint. Nethercott was additionally indicted on charges of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. In 2011 the New York Times reported that Nethercott \\"has a string of assault and weapons convictions, and was once mentioned in Congressional testimony on abuses by bounty hunters for detaining at gunpoint two Southern California high school students on their way home from a football game.\\" Subsequent to the attacks, Leiva and Mancia sued the Texas chapter of Ranch Rescue. They were represented by attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, among others. They sued for damages relating to their physical injuries and emotional distress. The judge in the case ruled in their favor. Joseph Sutton settled for $100,000, but neither Nethercott nor Ranch Rescue leader Jack Foote defended themselves in court. Nethercott was ordered to pay a default settlement of $850,000. Unable to pay the settlement, Nethercott was ordered to surrender his only asset a ranch near the Arizona-Sonora border. In an action considered by some to be in response to this civil award, Arizona voters passed, in a favorable vote of 74.2% of votes cast, the Arizona Standing in Civil Actions, Proposition 102 (2006), preventing illegal immigrants from collecting punitive damages. This law, however, did not aid Ranch Rescue and, in 2011, Nethercott was quoted as saying, \\"If something happens with an illegal, and they try to sue you and get visas and amnesty, it won't work anymore. Nobody else will lose their home. That's what's important.\\" See alsoAmerican Patrol Report *Minuteman Project *Minuteman Civil Defense Corps *Save Our State References  External links Secrets on the Texas-Mexico Border: Leiva et al. v.

In 1948, he was elected corresponding member of the Romanian Academy, and in 1955, he was promoted to titular member of the Academy. In 1956, he became President of the Union of Romanian Plastic Artists. In 1966, he was awarded the Order of Cultural Merit, first class, for the sculpture Hercules and the Centaur. In 1962, he was awarded the Order of the Star of the Romanian People's Republic, first class, while in 1971, he was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labour and the \\"Hammer and Sickle\\" medal.  Legacy  The Ion Jalea Museum of Sculpture is located in Constan»õa, close to the Casino. The building, designed by the architect after World War I, was turned in a museum in 1968, when Jalea donated to the city part of his private art collection. After his death, the collection was completed with sculptures donated by his family, arriving at a total of 227 works of art.

Synopsis A king had his castle shadowed by a great oak tree, and had no well that held water year round. He declared that whoever cut down the oak and dug the well would have the princess and half the kingdom. Three brothers, who had set out because their father was too poor to give them anything, were going to his palace. The youngest son heard something hewing, and went off. He found an axe that was hewing by itself, and it said that it had been waiting for him. He took it and went back, telling his brother that it had been an axe, and endured their ridicule. Again, he heard something digging, found a shovel digging by itself, and took it as well; then he wondered where a brook came from, and found not a spring but a walnut, which he stopped up with moss. When they reached the king, he had decreed that whoever tried and failed would have his ears clipped off and be put on a deserted island. The two older tried, failed, and suffered the punishment. The youngest set the axe to cut down the tree, the spade to dig the well, and the nut to fill it. The story says that it was just as well that the brothers lost their ears, because it spared them hearing people's comments that their youngest brother had not been a fool to wonder.

Background  Dowdall was the daughter of Thomas Southwell and his wife the poet Anne Southwell. Her parents were married at St Clement Danes in London on 24 June 1594, so it seems likely that Elizabeth was born in England in the mid 1590s. After her father was knighted in June 1603, the family moved to occupy land at Poulnelong, near Bandon, county Cork in Ireland as part of the Plantation of Munster.Marie-Louise Coolahan (2019), Dowdall (n√©e Southwell), Elizabeth, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

He then joined the Parliamentary forces in England, and was later to become one of the regicides of Charles I. After the Restoration of Charles II her husband was convicted of regicide and sentenced to death. He was reprieved and died in prison in 1666.

She holds the record for winning the most medals of any athlete at the British Athletics Championships, standing at 22 medals to date, including being the 100 metres champion six times, and the 200 metres champion a further three times. Athletics career =1998= She represented England and won a bronze medal in the 4 x 100 metres relay event, at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. =2000= She represented Great Britain in the 2000 Summer Olympics. =2002= A second Commonwealth Games appearance in Manchester resulted in a second bronze medal in the 4 x 100 metres relay. =2004= She represented Great Britain again at the 2004 Summer Olympics. =2006= As women's sprinting in Britain began to develop again, Maduaka was faced with domestic challenges from athletes such as Abi Oyepitan. In 2006 Maduaka was not selected for the Commonwealth Games, but instead ran in the World Indoor Athletics Championships. In late 2006, she burst back onto the scene, setting new personal bests. She went on to represent Great Britain at the 2006 European Championships in Athletics, finishing 4th in the final of the 100 m and finishing 2nd in the 4 x 100 m relay. Maduaka became the British champion over 100 m and 200 m at the British Championships in 2006, beating her opposition by a considerable margin. At the end of the year Maduaka was ranked as the fastest British athlete over 100 m and the second fastest over 200 m. =2007= At the 2007 AAA Championships she failed to defend her 100 m crown, finishing third behind Jeanette Kwakye, and also had to pull out of the final of the 200 m, despite winning her heat very convincingly, due to illness. The 200 m was also won by Kwakye. At the 2007 European Cup first division, Maduaka finished 2nd in the individual 100 m, 1st in the 200 m and anchored the British team home to first place in the relay, winning 23 points altogether, for her team. This is the most any British athlete has ever done for their country at these championships. Joice Maduaka was later chosen to represent her country at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics. She was excluded from the 100 m list, as Montell Douglas was the only British athlete who had obtained the A-standard whilst, Laura Turner had been selected as an improving athlete. Maduaka and Jeanette Kwakye were to be the only British representatives in the 200 m. However, Turner went on to achieve the A standard for the 100 m, meaning that GBR were permitted another athlete in the event. The committee chose Kwakye, and then replaced her in the 200 m with Emily Freeman. Controversy In late 2006 Maduaka and the rest of the British Women's Relay Team, represented the Europe team at the 2006 World Athletics Cup. However, the officials had placed the Europe team and the USA team in the wrong lanes, so when it came to pass the baton, they would have been passing them to the opposition. Team USA passed the batons, but team GBR (Europe) were unsure, but in the end did make a change. Both teams finished. USA was disqualified, but Europe wasn't. The race was not rerun, despite being rescheduled.

Developing from the use of allegory in the Middle Ages, Renaissance literature exhibits an increased emphasis on courtly love,C. S. Lewis, The Allegory of Love, 1936. sometimes abandoning intelligibility for deliberately unintelligible allegories.I. Ousby ed, The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (1995) p. 16 The early modern theory of allegory is discussed in Sir John Harington's Apology for Poetry (included in his translation of Ariosto's Orlando furioso, 1591). Continuous/intermittent Renaissance allegories could be continuous and systematic, or intermittent and occasional.Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (1971) p. 90-1 Perhaps the most famous example of a thorough and continuous allegorical work from the Renaissance is the six books of Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene. In book 4, for example, Agape has three sons: Priamond (from one), Diamond (from two), and Telamond (from t√©leios, perfect, but emended by Jortin to 'Triamond' in his 1734 edition). The three sons correspond to the three worlds, born of love. Cambell's battle with the three sons is an allegory of \\"man's battle with the three worlds to find his place in the universe, to establish harmony in God's creation, and ultimately to achieve salvation\\".Thomas P. Roche: The Kindly Frame, 1964, excerpted in Paul. J. Alpers (ed): Elizabethan Poetry. Modern Essays in Criticism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967: 418 Furthermore, since any triad may be an analogue of another, the three brothers could also be an allegory of the three worlds of man's soul: the vegetative, the sensitive, and the angelic\\". Spenser's (multi- layered) allegory is similarly worked out through all six books.I. Ousby ed, The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (1995) p. 318 Torquato Tasso also wrote continuous allegory, as opposed to the intermittent allegory of an Ariosto, for example.Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (1971) p. 90-1 Three-world theory By the 16th century, allegory was firmly linked to what is known as the Elizabethan world picture, taken from Ptolemy and Pseudo- Dionysius the Areopagite. This theory postulates the existence of three worlds: * the sublunary world we live in, subject to change. * the celestial world, the world of the planets and stars, unchanging. * the supercelestial world, where angels and the Godhead are. Pico della Mirandola discusses the interrelations between these three worlds in the introduction to his Heptaplus: 'For euen as the...three worlds being girt and buckled with the bands of concord doe by reciprocall libertie, interchange their natures; the like do they also by their appellations. And this is the principle from whence springeth & groweth the discipline of allegoricall sense' (translated by Pierre de la Primaudaye in The French Academie, London, 1618, p. 671).

The Dublin Suburban Rail () network, branded as DART/Commuter, is a railway network that serves the city of Dublin, Ireland, most of the Greater Dublin Area and outlying towns. The system is made up of five lines: * Northern Commuter - Dublin Pearse to Dundalk (with one peak time train to Dublin in the morning and an evening train back to Newry) every weekday. * South Eastern Commuter - Dublin Connolly to Gorey. * South Western Commuter - Dublin Heuston to Port Laoise. * Western Commuter - Dublin Pearse / Docklands to Longford/M3 Parkway. * Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) - Bray Daly/Greystones to Howth/Malahide. In 2018, Commuter services carried 14.6 million passengers, with DART carrying 20 million. Apart from the service to Newry, the lines are owned and operated by Iarnr√≥d √âireann. The Luas light rail system is not part of this network and is not operated by Iarnr√≥d √âireann. As of 2018, the Luas Red Line between Connolly and Heuston Stations is the only one featured on DART network maps, although the Green Line terminates at Broombridge station since late 2017. Since 2015, Iarnr√≥d √âireann has conducted an extensive crackdown on fare evaders by increasing ticket checks on all services in the Greater Dublin Area. These include members of staff checking tickets and smartcards both on-board its trains or at the stations. Service frequency Services run from 05:40 to 01:11 from Monday to Saturday and 07:55 to 01:05 on Sunday. However, frequency varies by line, with the DART service being more frequent (every 10 minutes off peak, every 4 minutes peak) and services to outer stations being less frequent (up to one every hour off peak). Fewer trains run on Sunday than any other day, and special timetables may be made for public holidays. There are no services on Christmas Day or St Stephen's Day. Rolling stock 22059 passing Malahide in September 2015 A 2800 Class unit (2810) at Dublin Connolly in 2008 As of 2018, the majority of rolling stock used on the non-DART services are 29000 Class diesel multiple units, with 22000 Class DMUs also in use for some services on the Maynooth line. The 29000 Class DMUs are fitted with interior LEDs and automated information systems. 8100 Class electric multiple units form the backbone of the DART services, with 8500, 8510 and 8520 Classes also in use. Locomotive hauled services are no longer used on any DART/Commuter services, although these (typically Cravens trains) were a feature before the delivery of the 2800 Class DMUs in the year 2000. Currently, all Kildare Commuter services are operated by 22000 Class railcars. Routes =Northern Commuter= Fleet: 29000 Class and 22000 Class DMUs. : Stations served - Dublin Pearse, Tara Street, Dublin Connolly, Howth Junction, Clongriffin, Portmarnock, Malahide, Donabate, Rush and Lusk, Skerries, Balbriggan, Gormanston, Laytown, Drogheda, Dundalk and (limited service). and/or Dundalk South have been mooted as possible additional stations. The track is shared with the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise service, and DART services as far as Malahide. The bridge at Drogheda is single track which may hinder high frequency services in the long term. The halt at Mosney is no longer used due to the closure of the holiday camp there. Iarnr√≥d √âireann envisages electrification as far as Drogheda by 2030, with the stations between Balbriggan and Malahide incorporated into a new DART service between Balbriggan and Hazelhatch by 2022 (see below). =South Eastern Commuter= Fleet: 29000 Class and 22000 Class DMUs. Stations served - Dublin Connolly, Tara Street, Dublin Pearse, Lansdowne Road, Sydney Parade, Blackrock, D√∫n Laoghaire, Bray, Greystones, Kilcoole, Wicklow, Rathdrum, Arklow and Gorey. The services share track with the mainline service to Rosslare and the DART service as far as Greystones. The line is single track from Bray onwards. This is the least frequent DART/Commuter service, with only one train daily. =South Western Commuter= Sometimes called the Portlaoise Commuter or the Portlaoise Commuter Line. Previously known as the Arrow service which served stations as far as Kildare. This service was extended in January 2013 to include more of Ireland's fastest growing commuter towns including Portarlington and a new commuter terminus in Portlaoise. Fleet: 22000 Class DMUs. Stations served - City branch: Dublin Heuston, Park West & Cherry Orchard, Clondalkin & Fonthill, Adamstown, Hazelhatch & Celbridge, Sallins & Naas, Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin, Portarlington and Portlaoise. Grand Canal Dock branch: Grand Canal Dock, Dublin Pearse, Tara Street, Dublin Connolly, Drumcondra, Park West & Cherry Orchard, Clondalkin & Fonthill, Adamstown, Hazelhatch & Celbridge, Sallins & Naas and Newbridge. This service is the newest Dublin DART/Commuter line. It was launched in 1994 as the Arrow service, shortly after the delivery of the then Arrow-branded 2600 Class railcars. Cherry Orchard, Clondalkin, Hazelhatch and Celbridge and Sallins and Naas stations were opened on the same day, although stations had previously existed on some of these sites. Newbridge station had previously been an InterCity station, though Commuter trains now mainly serve it. The stations on the line were at the time of launch all \\"Arrow\\" branded also, though this branding has now been removed. This line is connected directly with the rest of the network, despite being operated out of the Dublin Heuston terminus, by the Phoenix Park Tunnel, the Luas and Dublin Bus route 90. In 2013 due to increased demand from commuters in the North East Laois commuter zone the service was extended to Portlaoise with first trains departing Portlaoise at 5.40 and last train from Heuston 22:10 to Portlaoise with a later 23:10 serving to Kildare. Trains run every hour with extra trains on Monday-Friday in the mornings and in the evenings: 18:10, 18:25, 18:55. A station used only occasionally for \\"special\\" trains also existed at the Curragh, until it was closed in 1999. The station at Cherry Orchard was relocated to Park West & Cherry Orchard in July 2008 and Clondalkin was located further west as Clondalkin & Fonthill on the Fonthill Road in October 2008. This work was part of the Kildare Route Project, which included quadruple-tracking the line between Le Fanu Road (east of the former Cherry Orchard station) to just beyond Hazelhatch. Another new station was built between Adamstown and Clondalkin at Kishoge, which is located adjacent to the Lucan Outer Ring Road. This station was completed in 2009, however no funding was available in order to construct an access road and adjacent car park. On 21 November 2016 the first trains ran from Grand Canal Dock through the Phoenix Park Tunnel serving Newbridge. The National Transport Authority envisages electrification as far as Hazelhatch by 2022. Under I√â's DART Underground project, upon electrification of this line and opening of the DART Underground, the existing Kildare line service, as far as Hazelhatch & Celbridge would be replaced by one of two DART lines, running via the DART Underground from Hazelhatch to Balbriggan/Howth. The service would also be directly connected to the rest of the DART/Commuter network at Dublin Pearse. On 22 September 2015, the DART Underground project was rumoured to have been cancelled, but was actually delayed. However, the electrification of the line and the DART Underground will go ahead at some point. =Western Commuter= Fleet: 29000 Class and 22000 Class DMUs. Stations served - City branch: Dublin Pearse, Tara Street, Dublin Connolly, Drumcondra, Broombridge, Ashtown, Navan Road Parkway, Castleknock, Coolmine, Clonsilla, Leixlip Confey, Leixlip Louisa Bridge, Maynooth, then continuing onto Kilcock, Enfield, Mullingar, Edgeworthstown and Longford. Docklands branch: Docklands, Broombridge, Ashtown, Navan Road Parkway, Castleknock, Coolmine, Clonsilla, Hansfield, Dunboyne, and M3 Parkway. This service had been operated as a limited service from November 1981 until 1990, serving Ashtown (opened January 1982), Clonsilla, Leixlip (now Leixlip Louisa Bridge) and Maynooth. In 1990, new stations were opened at Broombridge, Castleknock, Coolmine and Leixlip Confey. Another station at Drumcondra was re-opened in March 1998. Most of the station buildings on this line were a mixture of small block built booking offices and converted steel cabins and there was still a limited service owing to the single track between Clonsilla and Maynooth. In 2001, a major upgrade project took place, with the upgrading of the line between Clonsilla and Maynooth to double track, the entire line being upgraded to continuous welded rail, the building of permanent station buildings at all stations except Broombridge, the replacement of the semaphore signalling with computerised traffic control, and the provision of real time information displays at stations. These, however, apart from the ones at Drumcondra, were not in use until February 2012. From 12 March 2007, several additional weekday services operate on the Maynooth line. However these only operated from Clonsilla, serving the existing stations to Broombridge, and then terminate at the new Docklands railway station. These did not serve either Drumcondra or the central Dublin stations, or the stations beyond Clonsilla. On 3 September 2010, the first trains ran from Docklands onto the Dunboyne branch serving Dunboyne and M3 Parkway. In June 2013, another station opened on this branch called Hansfield serving Ongar and Clonee areas. It is planned that these services will run eventually to Navan, becoming the proposed Meath Commuter. On 21 January 2008, the then named Phoenix Park railway station opened. This station is located beside the R147 dual carriageway in Ashtown, and despite its former name is not located in the Phoenix Park, but was built to serve the Phoenix Park Racecourse Apartments constructed on grounds of the former racecourse adjacent to the park. To avoid confusion, this station was renamed Navan Road Parkway in 2011.http://www.irishrail.ie/cat_news.jsp?i=4292 The National Transport Authority envisages electrification as far as Maynooth by 2027. Under I√â's DART Underground project, upon electrification of this line and opening of the DART Underground, the existing Maynooth line service would be replaced by one of two DART lines, running from Maynooth to Bray. In February 2014, Iarnr√≥d √âireann announced a massive improvement programme for the Western Commuter line, which includes the removal of level crossings at Ashtown, Coolmine, Porterstown and two crossings at Clonsilla. The level crossing on the Ratoath Road has been replaced by an overbridge which was completed in February 2015. It also includes a full resignalling of the line between Maynooth and Dublin Connolly. This project is expected to begin in 2021. =Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART)= See separate Dublin Area Rapid Transit article.

He is the illegitimate son of Kraven the Hunter, the nephew of Chameleon, and the half-brother of Vladimir Kravinoff and Ana Kravinoff. Publication history Alyosha Kravinoff first appeared in the pages of Spectacular Spider-Man #243 (February 1997) and was created by J.M. DeMatteis and Luke Ross. Fictional character biography Alyosha Kravinoff is an illegitimate mutant son of the supervillain Kraven the Hunter. Unlike Alyosha's half-brother Vladimir (the Grim Hunter), Alyosha was separated from his family and raised in an African jungle. After Kraven the Hunter's suicide, Alyosha came to New York City to investigate the father he barely knew. Dressed as Kraven, Alyosha confronted his uncle Dmitri Smerdyakov (AKA Chameleon). Believing his abusive half- brother had returned from the dead, Chameleon revealed to Alyosha much about the dysfunctional Kravinoff family. Kraven's former lover Calypso Ezili did actually return from the dead and she mistook Alyosha for Kraven the Hunter. She seduced Alyosha, but afterwards he spurned her affections. Later, riding a bull elephant atop Manhattan's rooftops, Alyosha attacked Spider-Man. He poisoned him with a hallucinogenic dart, but then set him free. While at the Kravinoff estate, Alyosha was learning about his father from Spider-Man when Calypso returned with Kraven's tribesmen. She set the home ablaze and killed all but Gulyadkin the Lion. Calypso poisoned Alyosha and Spider-Man and used her hypnotic powers to force the two to fight to the death. Spider-Man resisted and injured Calypso, while Alyosha subdued her with his lion. Despite asking for her forgiveness, Alyosha savagely killed Calypso and all the tribesmen with her.Spectacular Spider-Man #243 He was later hired by the city of New York to help capture the Fantastic Four's enigmatic enormous canid Puppy. Next, he was hired by White Wolf, head of the deposed Wakandan secret police, to capture the Black Panther. The Black Panther turned the battle around, nearly killing Alyosha. Sandman later invited Alyosha to join Sandman's Sinister Six to hunt Doctor Octopus and Senator Ward (the host body for the alien Z'nox). Venom, slighted at his rejection by the Six, hunted each of the team members. Refusing to be \\"the hunted,\\" Alyosha trapped Venom with fire, but Venom seriously injured him and escaped.Peter Parker: Spider-Man #22 Alyosha then adopted a more relaxed personality as a suave, witty ladies' man. As \\"Al,\\" he began dating Timber Hughes, an aspiring actress who worked as a waitress at an all-villain bar. Al sought to help Timber's career in Hollywood by becoming a director. Despite celebrity connections, Al's efforts were stonewalled by arrogance, greed, and corruption within the Hollywood elite. Forced out of Hollywood by the powerful Rothstein brothers, Al is beaten while Timber was brutally raped. Both Al and Timber exacted vengeance which involved defeating another half-brother Ned Tannengarden (who was later killed by Chameleon), and left Hollywood to pursue heroics in New York City. Alyosha is one of few mutants that retained their superhuman powers after the M-Day. He is one of the superpowered beings recruited within the Beyond! miniseries by Stranger posing as the Beyonder.Beyond! #1-6 Alyosha Kraven later eventually becomes fully deranged from experimenting with his father's potions, and in his madness began collecting a zoo of animal-themed superhumans, including Bushmaster II, Gargoyle II, Tiger Shark, Kangaroo II, Aragorn (the version that was owned by the Vatican Black Knight), Vulture, Mongoose, Man-Bull, Dragon Man, Swarm, Mandrill, Grizzly III, Frog-Man, and Rhino. In the end, the Punisher (whom Kraven referred to as \\"Tiny Monkey\\") managed to sabotage this zoo. Kraven himself escapes to the Savage Land.The Punisher War Journal vol. 2 #13‚Äì15 During The Gauntlet storyline, Alyosha returned to New York to help his half-sister Ana and stepmother Sasha in the Grim Hunt by hunting Kaine. They then witness Spider-Man's fight with the Lizard.The Amazing Spider-Man #631 He was present at the ritual where Sasha sacrificed Mattie Franklin as part of a revival ritual that resurrects his half-brother Vladimir as a humanoid lion- like creature.The Amazing Spider-Man #634 After the Kravinoff Family was defeated, Alyosha alongside the other Kravinoff Family members escaped to the Savage Land. Alyosha soon abandoned his family after Kraven killed Sasha and Vladimir. In an attempt to impress Kraven, Ana pursued Alyosha with the intent of killing him in exchange that he trains her in order to rebuild the Kravinoff Family.The Amazing Spider-Man #637 Alyosha was later confirmed to have been killed in the Savage Land by his sister Ana when she and their father returned from the Savage Land to hunt down Kaine in Houston, Texas.Scarlet Spider Vol. 2 #6 Powers and abilities Alyosha is a mutant who has superhuman strength, speed, agility, dexterity, reflexes/reactions, coordination, balance and endurance, and a healing factor. His five senses are extraordinarily heightened, and when enraged, he may shift into a bestial fury. He inherited these from his father Kraven, who mutated himself through the constant use of mystical potions. Alyosha revealed to Spider-Man in his limited series that his mother was a natural-born mutant from whom he inherited the ability to communicate with and have control over animals. Additionally, he is an expert in weaponry such as poisons, guns, darts, axes, spears, whips, and nets, and is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant. He wore his father's lion vest, with embedded electroshock circuitry. He travels with his pet wolf Nickel and occasionally other exotic animals.

The Soras are a prominent tribal community with a patriarchal society in the Rayagada district of Odisha and specific pockets of Koraput and Gajapati districts. They are also present in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts. They inhabit blocks of Gunupur, Padmapur and Gudari. Their highest concentration is found in the Puttasingi area, approximately 25 km away from Gunupur NAC. Although, they are close to the assimilation process, yet some interior GPs like Rejingtal, Sagada and Puttasingi have Soras who still retain their traditional tribal customs and traditions. They are known by various names such as Savara, Sabara, Sora, and Soura. They are concentrated in parts of Gunupur adjoining to the blocks of Gumma, Serango of Gajapati district. The Soras speak Sora, a Munda language. However, written language in Sora is not followed by all. They practice shifting cultivation, with a few gradually taking up settled agriculture. They are of medium or short stature. The Savara villages consist of houses with mud walls and sedge grass roofs, usually situated in foothills. The adult males dress with a gavancha and the women with saris. They are also sometimes called Lanjia Souras due to their dress pattern of wearing a loin cloth hanging from behind and which could be mistakenly identified as a tail by a stranger. They are endogamous and the clan, although absent, is related to Birinda, which is exogamous. Families are nuclear although joint or extended families are also found. Marriages are made by bride capture, elopement, and by negotiations. The Sora people are a dwindling jungle tribe with a distinctive shamanic culture. According to an article in Natural History, \\"a shaman, usually a woman, serves as an intermediary between the two worlds [of the living and the dead]. During a trance, her soul is said to climb down terrifying precipices to the underworld, leaving her body for the dead to use as their vehicle for communication. One by one the spirits speak through her mouth. Mourners crowd around the shaman, arguing vehemently with the dead, laughing at their jokes, or weeping at their accusations.\\"Piers Vitebsky. Dialogues with the dead. Natural History Magazine, Inc. March 1997 Culture Instead of clan organization they have their extended families called Birinda, which consists of descendants from a common ancestors of four to five generation. The Soras' religion is very elaborate and deep rooted. They are polytheist and believe in large number of deities and ancestral spirits. Dance and music constitute part and parcel of their rich aesthetic life. The Sora family is polygamous. The total household economy revolves around the woman member who is hardworking and who helps her husband in ploughing and harvesting crops in addition to attending household chores exclusively. The Sora people are the most prevalent practitioners of the podu cultivation system in Srikakulam district. Living high in the hills, they have little level land available and so cannot usually plough. They slash-and-burn forested land, planting millet and pulses between the tree stumps that are left and which limit the effects of erosion. After a couple of years of use, they allow the land to recover by cultivating a different area; in due course, they return to the original plot. In addition to podu, the Sora also construct irrigated terraces where it is feasible and upon those they grow rice. Religion The Soras are highly religious with each and every natural phenomenon attributed to the works of some Gods, deities or spirits of traditional belief . Therefore, the customary law, values, norms are highly respected by all members of the society for the fear of inviting personal or communal harms. They believe that spirits guide their destiny, worshiping mainly the deities Sandhidemudu and Jakaradevatha. According to the legend, Lord Nrusimha was being worshipped at Neelagiri (Puri) along with Neelamadhaba. As mentioned earlier, Lord Nrushimha is being worshiped in a separate temple adjacent to Muktimandapa/ Muktamandapa. According to the legend, the image of Neelamadhaba was made of Neelakanta mani (emerald). However, the present image of the deity is made of neem wood. Legend further says that Lord Jagannath was originally worshiped by a Savara raja (an aboriginal tribal chieftain) named Viswabasu. Having heard about the glory of the deity, Raja Indradyumna sent a Brahmin priest called Vidyapati to discover the exact location of the deity who was then secretly worshipped by Viswabasu inside the cave of a dense forest. Vidyapati tried his best, but could not locate the place of worship. Finally, he could manage to marry Lalita, the daughter of Viswabasu. At repeated request of Lalita, Viswabasu took his son-in-law blind-folded to a cave wherein Lord Neelamadhaba was being worshipped. Vidyapati was a very intelligent man. He dropped mustard seeds on the ground on his way. After a few days, the seeds germinated which helped Vidyapati to locate the cave wherein the deity was being worshiped hiddenly.On hearing from Vidyapati subsequently, Raja Indradyumna immediately rushed to Odra desa (Odisha) to have a darshan of the deity.The king was disappointed at the sudden disappearance of the deity. The deity was hidden in sand. Raja Indradyumna was determined not to return without having a darshan of the deity and observed fast onto death at Neelagiri. The deity was pleased with the king. Thereafter, the king performed a horse sacrifice and built a magnificent temple for the deity. However, in the last many decades many of the traditional Sora beliefs have been superseded by Christianity that was introduced by missionaries.Piers Vitebsky, Living Without the Dead: Loss and Redemption in a Jungle Cosmos, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 2017. In many areas the shamanic and animist beliefs are distant memories, and in some areas, particularly around Puttasingh the graveyards of the ancestors have been destroyed. There is nowadays a move by nationalist Hindu groups to convert the Sora to Hinduism. This conflict has given rise to great tension in the area. Social life Lanjia Sora house at Odisha State Tribal fair, Bhubaneswar The Sora have a traditional political organization at each village and region, having hereditary post of Gomango (or Gamong; secular head), Buyya (or Buya; religious head), Mondal, Raito, and Barik (messenger). The Soras have made history in pre-British and British period and post independence as a community known for their economic and political integrity. They practice shifting cultivation and the men hunt. A weekly market, called shandies, is an important role in the society, in the economy and in culture exchanges with other tribes and Western culture. Notable people Padala Bhudevi is from the Sora people. She married at eleven and was soon a single parent of three children.

Synopsis In those days when Jesus and St. Peter wandered upon earth, they came to a house where lived a woman named Gertrude. They were both hungry and asked for a taste of lefse. She took a tiny piece of dough, but it covered the whole griddle just the same, and she thought it too large to give to them. She tried twice more, each time with less dough, but could not make a lefse small enough. So she refused to give them anything. Our Lord punishes her by transforming her into a bird that immediately flies up through the chimney. The bird, later known as the woodpecker, can be seen with a black body and a red hat, where it pecks for food between bark and wood and beeps thirsty against the rain.

Biography Born in Faenza, then part of the Papal States, Tamburini studied the orchestral horn with his father and voice with Aldobrando Rossi, before making his debut as a singer, aged 18, in La contessa di colle erbose (Pietro Generali). He went on to become one of the finest baritones of his age. He had a beautiful, smooth and flexible voice the quality of which is indicated by the bel canto music written for him. Castil-Blaze described his voice in The Harmonicon of May 1833: :His voice is a fine baritone, well defined, extending from A to F, occasionally reaching G#, and sometimes descending to Gb. I might have allotted to him the two full octaves without reserve, but I prefer to retrench the semitone, above and below, that I may give to his voice and tone the full praise it merits. It is round, rich, and clear, of wonderful flexibility, and such astonishing firmness, that it is impossible to suspect any note is passed over unperceived. He has the neatness and precision of execution that Ber and Barizel have acquired on the clarionet or bassoon. The tone is equal in its whole extent, taking and holding F# with as much ease as a tenor voice would do, or running over the notes with a vivacity unheard of till now.Castil-Blaze (1833) p. 126 However, it is apparent from several comments in the English and Irish press that, certainly by 1847, he had acquired a vibrato. For example, the Hampshire Telegraph noted in April 1847 that \\"Tamburini‚Äôs voice exhibits some of the effects of time for his upper notes have lost power, and the tremulousness, which was always his defect, has increased\\". He was renowned also for his good looks and impressive stage presence, often working with the tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini and soprano Giulia Grisi. Tamburini is famous for his association with the operas of Bellini such as I Puritani. Indeed, he was one of the so-called \\"Puritani Quartet\\" of leading international singers, along with Grisi, Rubini and the bass Luigi Lablache. The quartet was reunited on stage, albeit with Giovanni Mario replacing Rubini, in 1843 at the premiere of Donizetti's Don Pasquale. A particular favourite with London and Paris audiences, Tamburini was married to the contralto Marietta Gioia-Tamburini. They often sang together. He died at Nice in 1876, aged 76.

The original film is about an American girl and a French criminal in Paris, while in the remake is vice versa in Los Angeles. Plot Jesse Lujack (Richard Gere) is a cocky, nihilistic drifter, and small time car thief, in Las Vegas. He‚Äôs obsessed with Silver Surfer comic books, the rock and roll music of Jerry Lee Lewis, and Monica Poiccard (Val√©rie Kaprisky), a UCLA architecture undergraduate whom he knows only from a weekend fling while she visited Vegas. Leaving Las Vegas, Lujack steals a Porsche, intending to drive to Los Angeles. As he speeds down the highway and looks through the owner's possessions, Lujack discovers a handgun in the vehicle's glovebox, which he briefly toys with. He comes upon a highway construction roadblock and evades it. Seeing his reckless driving, a Patrolman gives chase and the fleeing Lujack runs off the road and becomes stuck. When the Officer spotlights him and orders him to step away from the car, Lujack impulsively grabs the gun, and blindly shoots through the back window of the car, inadvertently mortally wounding the Patrolman. The remorseful Lujack pads the dying Officers head with his coat, and flees on foot. Arriving in Los Angeles, Lujack finds his picture splashed all over the newspaper and TV news as the \\"cop killer.\\" On the run, but unable to immediately leave LA while arranging to get paid for a previous car theft, under the alias of Jack Burns, Lujack breaks into Monica's apartment and waits for her to return home. Monica discovers him naked in her bed and initially declines his advances but later has sex with him in the shower. Lujack attempts to convince Monica to abscond to Mexico with him. However, Monica is a star architectural student with big plans and reluctant. Lujack shows up at her college and intrudes on her presentation of a project to her professors, initially exasperating her, but he continues to pursue her, showing up in various stolen cars to offer her rides. He eventually wears down her defenses and she succumbs to his charms once again, although still ambivalent to his insistence on accompanying him to Mexico. After Lujack's photograph appears in the newspaper, he is recognized on the street right after dropping Monica off at a groundbreaking ceremony downtown. The police find Monica and question her on the street but Monica, once again under Jesse‚Äôs spell, refuses to turn him in. When the police start following her right before Lujack comes back to pick her up, she finally accepts his offer to flee to Mexico together. On the way out of LA, Lujack and Monica stop in order for Jesse to repair his latest stolen car. Monica walks to a nearby store and finds that her picture is on the front page of the national newspaper alongside Lujack's. Realizing the impossibility of her romantic fantasy, Monica phones the police, but then returns to tell Lujack she did so. Jesse asks her if she loves him, and she says no. He laughs and says ‚Äúliar‚Äù. He then runs up the road to meet an accomplice he has arranged to bring his payment for the previous car theft, who throws a gun to him as well, which Lujack refuses and allows to drop to the street.

Once activated, about 12-18 molecules of C9 polymerize to form pores in target cell membranes, causing lysis and cell death. C9 is one member of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC), which also includes complement components C5b, C6, C7 and C8. The formation of the MAC occurs through three distinct pathways: the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways. Pore formation by C9 is an important way that bacterial cells are killed during an infection, and the target cell is often covered in multiple MACs. The clinical impact of a deficiency in C9 is an infection with the gram-negative bacterium Neisseria meningitidis.  Structure  C9 genes include 11 exons and 10 introns when found in fish. In fish, the liver is the site where the majority of complement components are produced and expressed, but C9 can also be found in other tissues. It is a single-chain glycoprotein with a four domain structure arranged in a globular bundle.  Pore formation  MAC formation starts with the assembly of a tetrameric complex with the complement components C6, C7, C8, and C5b. The final step of MAC on target cell surfaces involves the polymerization of C9 molecules bound to C5b8 forming C5b-9. C9 molecules allow cylindrical, asymmetrical transmembrane pores to form. The overall complex belongs to MAC/perforin-like (MACPF)/CDC superfamily. Pore formation involves binding the C9 molecules to the target membrane, membrane molecules forming a pre-pore shape, and conformational change in the TMH1, the first transmembrane region, and TMH2, the second transmembrane region. The formations of pores leads to the killing of foreign pathogens and infected host cells.

His compositions combine jazz, classical, and traditional Arabic music.  Biography  ElSaffar was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1977. His mother, Ruth Anthony El Saffar, an American, was a Cervantes scholar and Jungian analyst. His father, Zuhair El Saffar, is an Iraqi immigrant and physicist. He studied classical music at Depaul University in Chicago. In 2001, he won the Carmine Caruso Jazz Trumpet Competition and the International Trumpet Guild Jazz Improvisation Competition. He studied Iraqi maqam music in Baghdad and learned to play an Iraqi instrument, the santur. He began to weave traditional Arabic music into modern jazz trumpet. In 2007, he released his debut album, Two Rivers, for Pi Recordings. For the 2020-2021 school year, he is a Hodder Fellow at Princeton University. ElSaffar has created new techniques to play microtones and ornaments that are idiomatic to Arab music but are not typically heard on the trumpet. As a composer, ElSaffar has used the microtones found in maqam music to create a unique approach to harmony and melody. In 2002 he began studying the maqam tradition of music composition in Baghdad and London, with Hamid al-Saadi, one of the most renowned maqam singers in Iraq and is currently an acknowledged performer of the classical Iraqi maqam tradition. He performs actively as a vocalist and santur player with his group, Safaafir, the only ensemble in the US performing Iraqi Maqam in its traditional format. In 2006, ElSaffar received commissions from the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia and from the Festival of New Trumpet Music (FONT), to compose Two Rivers, a suite that invokes Iraqi musical traditions and frames them in a modern jazz setting. ElSaffar has since received commissions from the Jerome Foundation, the Jazz Institute of Chicago, and Chamber Music America and has continued developing a singular approach to integrating Middle Eastern tonalities and rhythms into an American jazz context, releasing three albums; Two Rivers (2006), Radif Suite (2010), and Inana (2011) to critical acclaim. He has also composed for theater projects and film soundtracks, and appeared in Jonathan Demme‚Äôs Oscar- nominated film, Rachel Getting Married. As a sideman, ElSaffar has performed with Cecil Taylor, Simon Shaheen, Randy Brecker, Miya Masaoka, Rudresh Mahanthappa, Vijay Iyer, and Samir Chatterjee. In addition to his busy performance schedule, ElSaffar curates a weekly concert series at Alwan for the Arts, New York's premiere center for Middle Eastern arts and culture.

Molluscum contagiosum affects about 200,000 people a year, about 1% of all diagnosed skin diseases. Diagnosis is based on the size and shape of the skin lesions and can be confirmed with a biopsy, as the virus cannot be routinely cultured. Molluscum contagiosum virus is the only species in the genus Molluscipoxvirus. MCV is a member of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae of family Poxviridae. Other commonly known viruses that reside in the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae are variola virus (cause of smallpox) and monkeypox virus. The poxvirus family uniquely contains both non-enveloped particles (mature virions), and enveloped particles (extracellular virions). The structure of the virions is consistent with that of others in the poxvirus family: they are composed of a nucleocapsid, core envelope, lateral body, and an extracellular envelope. Like other poxviruses, MCV is a DNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus. Because of this, the virus must bring all necessary enzymes for replication with it or encode the enzymes in its genome.  Structure  The Molluscum contagiosum virus virion is described as oval-shaped and has the dimension of approximately 320 nm √ó 250 nm √ó 200 nm. The virus has two distinct infectious particles called the mature virion (MV) and the enveloped virion (EV), which differ in that the EV contains a second outer cellular membrane. Poxviridae is the only virus family that contains both enveloped and non-enveloped infectious particles. Other structures of the EV and MV virion include the nucleocapsid, core wall, and two lateral bodies. Before the virion is released into the cytosol, the lateral bodies are associated with the virion core through boding interactions. However, during virion release into the cytoplasm, the virion core wall expands and forces the lateral bodies to dissociate. The lateral bodies function to transport one or more vital virion proteins needed for genome replication or expression.  Genome  The genome consists of a linear double stranded DNA molecule that is approximately 190 kilobases in length. The genome is unique in that the two ends of the double stranded DNA sequence are inverted repeats of each other. This inverted terminal sequence is 4.7 kilobases in length, but can vary from 0.7-12 kilobases among poxviruses. There are 182 genes that are encoded by Molluscum contagiosum virus. Over 100 of these genes are conserved in other viruses from the poxvirus family, such as Variola virus and Vaccinia virus. The inverted terminal sequence of MCV differs from the sequences of others in the poxvirus family because it contains genus-specific host response evasion genes. The genome contains 64% GC bases, and thus encodes a lesser amount of the stop codons UAA, UGA, and UAG compared to other poxviruses. Further gene analysis has shown the MCV genome contains many long and overlapping open reading frames.  Replication cycle  = Entry into cell = Molluscum contagiosum virus, similar to all poxviruses, produces two infectious particles mature virions (MV) and extracellular virions (EV), with the EV differing from the MV in that they possess an extra cellular membrane. To enter the cell, the membrane of MV fuses to the plasma membrane, specifically glycosaminoglycans, of the host cell and then enters via macropinocytosis. This process is initiated by the presence of phosphatidylserine molecules exposed on the MV cellular membrane. Similarly, the outer membrane of EV fuses to the plasma membrane, specifically glycosaminoglycans, of the host cell and also enters via macropinocytosis. After macropinocytosis, H+ is pumped inside the internalized vacuole containing EV and this acidification breaks down the outer membrane, exposing a MV like particle. For both MV and EV, the cellular membranes then fuse with the vacuole allowing the release of the virus core into the cytosol. The virion is then uncoated, exposing the DNA to commence replication. = Replication and transcription = Molluscum contagiosum virus, like other poxviruses, replicates entirely in the cytoplasm of the host cell. This is a property unique to poxviruses, as all other DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus. Therefore, because the host cell proteins for DNA replication are present inside the nucleus, this virus has to bring or encode for all of the proteins needed for replication. Each virion sets up a region in the cytoplasm, called a 'viral factory' where DNA replication, transcription, and translation all occur sequentially. There are three phases of DNA transcription. During the early phase, genes that encode for transcription factors, viral DNA and RNA polymerases, and proteins that stimulate host cell mitosis are transcribed by DNA dependent RNA polymerase that the virion carries with it. The mRNA produced in the early phase is then translated by viral transcriptase that the virion also carries with it. Then during the intermediate phase, the proteins encoded for in the early phase are used to replicate the viral DNA. Additionally, more transcription factors are produced to help transcribe the late phase mRNA. During the late phase, the genes encoding for structural proteins and enzymes needed for future infection are transcribed and then translated. Gene expression is sequential from early to intermediate to late phase of transcription, and it is temporally regulated. = Assembly and release = The virion cytoplasmic factories serve as the place where mature virions are assembled for future infection. Mature virions are released via cell lysis and aid in host to host transmission of the virus. Extracellular virions are made when the MV acquires a second membrane via the Golgi apparatus and then buds out of the cell. Extracellular virions aid in spreading the virus within the epithelial tissue.  Tropism  Molluscum contagiosum virus only infects human epidermal cells. It is not spread throughout the body, which explains why the virus cannot be transmitted through coughing or sneezing. People have attempted to grow the virus in cell culture to study its molecular properties, but have been largely unsuccessful due to it only infecting epidermal cells. However, there is evidence that it has the ability to adapt and survive in different types of cells in humans with severely compromised immune systems. Using qPCR analysis, it was determined that there was significant Molluscum contagiosum virus in the plasma of one patient who had a large t-cell deficiency. The patient was given CMX-001 antiviral agent as a treatment because of her severe molluscum contagiosum symptoms. Before administering the CMX-001 drug, Molluscum contagiosum virus DNA was found in 50% of her plasma samples, whereas DNA was found in 20% of samples after administering the drug. This is the first time molluscum contagiosum DNA was ever detected in the blood of a patient.  Modulation of host cell processes  Several proteins produced mRNA in the intermediate phase of transcription modulate host cell processes to promote an ideal environment for the viral replication and transcription. Molecular analysis has shown that 77 MCV proteins may potentially interfere with host cell processes. However, only 7 MCV proteins have confirmed host cell functions. These proteins include MC007, MC054, MC066, MC132, MC148, MC159, and MC160. The following list will give an overview of how these proteins modulate host cell processes. * The MC007 protein sequesters retinoblastoma protein (pRb) on the mitochondria membrane, inactivating it. The pRb protein is essential in controlling cellular proliferation and the deregulation of this protein leads to tumor pathogenesis. * The MC054 long protein binds Interleukin 18 which blocks its two binding sites. Interleukin-18 a pro- inflammatory cytokine involved in innate and adaptive immunity and inhibition of interleukin-18 weakens the immune system. * The MC066 protein is homologous to human glutathione peroxidase. This protein protects against cellular apoptosis caused by UV radiation and hydrogen peroxide. This shows a mechanism in which the virus can defend itself against environmental stressors. * The MC132 protein interacts with the NF-Œ∫B subunit p65 and causes p65 degradation. NF-Œ∫B is a transcription factor that is immediately activated following virus entry into cells and is important for virus detection, antiviral signaling, inflammation, and clearance of viral infection. Inhibiting and degrading this transcription factor allows the virus to further replicate without attack by the host cell. * The MC148 protein acts like a chemokine-like protein and displaces actual chemokines from their G-protein coupled receptors. Chemokines are small proteins of 70-100 amino acid residues which are involved in attracting and activating distinct leukocyte subsets. MC148 blocks this process by being an antagonist to CxC12a and CCR8 receptors. * The MC159 protein inhibits TNF-R1‚Äìinduced NF-Œ∫B activation. NF-Œ∫B is a transcription factor that is activated in the cytoplasm and translocates to the cell nucleus. It plays a crucial role in regulating the immune response, the cell cycle and apoptosis. * The MC160 protein binds heat shock protein 90, keeping it from stabilizing I Kappa Kinase (IKK). IKK is a protein that phosphorylates and inactivates the inhibitor of NF-Œ∫B, allowing NF-Œ∫B to be activating. When MC160 binds heat shock protein 90, IKK is degraded and the inhibitor remains bound to NF-Œ∫B, thus making NF-Œ∫B not functional.  Related disease  = Molluscum contagiosum = Figure 1. Round, hard, flesh colored bumps that are the symptom of Molluscum contagiosum virus infection. This is a viral infection of the skin that usually presents in children ages 1‚Äì10 and immunocompromised patients. The main symptom of this disease is round, hard, flesh colored, painless bumps, with sunken centers that are apparent on the surface of the skin (Figure 1). The bumps are generally less than 6 millimeters and can become red and inflamed or itchy if a person rubs them. They are generally found on the face, neck, armpits, and hands. However, the bumps may also be found on the genitals of adults if the disease was spread through sexual contact. The virus can be spread directly from person to person through skin to skin contact or through fomites, which are inanimate objects contaminated with the virus. The most common fomites for molluscum contagiosum transmission are clothing, towels, bathing sponges, toys, and sports equipment. Additionally, the virus can spread to other skin areas of one's body through itching or rubbing the virus. It can also be spread in adults through sexual contact. The virus is not circulated throughout the body, and thus, cannot be spread by coughing or sneezing. The transmission of this virus can be prevented by washing hands, not sharing items, refraining from sexual contact and shaving, and by keeping the bumps clean and covered. Generally, if one has a functioning immune system no treatment is needed and the bumps and virus will go away within 6‚Äì12 months of contraction. However, treatment is suggested if the bumps are on the genital area or if the person affected is immunocompromised. In healthy (non-immunocompromised) individuals, cryotherapy, curettage, laser therapy, oral therapy, or a topical therapy is suggested to treat the lesions. Cryotherapy involves freezing the lesions with liquid nitrogen, whereas curettage involves piercing the core and scraping the lesion with sterile equipment. Laser therapy involves destroying the lesion with a laser. It is a good idea to not try removing the lesions yourself, as the skin can become infected and the virus can spread to other parts of the body. A commonly prescribed oral medication used to treat the lesions is cimetidine and a topical therapy is Podophyllotoxin cream (0.5%). People with severely weakened immune systems and molluscum contagiosum may have bumps or lesions that are greater than 15 millimeters and look different than normal. Most typical therapies are ineffective in treating these people. The recommended treatment in this case are therapies that help boost the immune system.

The protein encoded by this gene is part of the classical pathway of the complement system, acting as a multi-domain serine protease. Deficiency of C2 has been associated with certain autoimmune diseases.  Function  In the classical and lectin pathways of complement activation, formation of the C3-convertase and C5-convertases requires binding of C2 to an activated surface-bound C4b in the presence of Mg2+; the resultant C4bC2 complex is then cleaved by C1s or MASP2 into C2a and C2b. It is thought that cleavage of C2 by C1s, while bound to C4b, results in a conformational rotation of C2b whereas the released C2a fragment may retain most of its original structure. C2b is the larger, enzymatically active fragment which is incorporated into the C3 convertase in this pathway, C4b2b (NB: some sources now refer to the larger fragment of C2 as C2b, making the C3 convertase C4b2b, whereas older sources refer to the larger fragment of C2 as C2a, making the C3 convertase C4b2a).

His piratical career lasted just 11 months, from 11 July 1718 to 19 June 1719, when he was ambushed and killed. His ships were the Cadogan, Buck, Saint James, and Rover. Davis captured 15 known English and French ships. A short career Born in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, Wales, Davis started out in piracy on 11 July 1718 when the slave ship Cadogan, on which he was serving as a mate, was captured by the pirate Edward England. Deciding to join the pirates, Davis was given command of the Cadogan and set out for Brazil on 18 July 1718. However, his crew mutinied and sailed to Barbados instead. Here Davis was imprisoned on the charge of piracy, but was eventually released and sought shelter in the pirate den of New Providence in the Bahamas. With New Providence being cleaned out by Governor Woodes Rogers, Davis left on the sloop Buck and conspired with six other crew members, who included Thomas Anstis and Walter Kennedy, to take over the vessel off Martinique. Davis was elected captain and conducted raids from his base at Coxon's Hole. Subsequently, he crossed the Atlantic to terrorize shipping in the Cape Verde Islands. One of the prizes he took there became the new flagship of Davis' pirate fleet, the 26-gun Saint James. He then formed a partnership with a French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as La Buse, and another pirate captain, Thomas Cocklyn, which lasted until they fell out in a drunken argument. Transferring to the 32-gun Rover, Davis sailed south and captured more rich prizes off the Gold Coast. One of his prisoners was fellow Welshman Bartholomew Roberts, who was destined to become even more famous as a pirate, as well as Thomas Sutton, who would sail alongside Roberts for his entire pirate career. Trickery and Deception Howell Davis, Taking a Dutch Treasure Ship, from the Pirates of the Spanish Main series (N19) for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes MET DP835011 The death of Captain Davis in an ambush on Principe A clever and charming man as he was, Davis pretended to be a legitimate privateer to deceive the commander of a Royal African Company slaving fort in Gambia. After capturing the commander at a welcoming dinner, Davis held him for ransom and gained 2,000 pounds in gold. He once seized a more powerful French vessel by flying a black pirate flag from another large but lightly armed ship he had recently taken. The French ship quickly surrendered, thinking she was outgunned. However, when he tried his pretence of being a Royal Navy pirate hunter in order to kidnap the governor of the Portuguese island of Pr√≠ncipe, the governor saw through it. Davis was invited to call at the fort for a glass of wine. On the way there, the pirates were ambushed and Davis shot dead on 19 June 1719. Bartholomew Roberts was elected to succeed him and raided the island in retaliation later that night. Character Captain William Snelgrave, the master of the Bird, a vessel captured by the pirates in 1719, later wrote an account of his experience. His ship was taken by Thomas Cocklyn's men, who abused him. However, when informed of this, Davis protected Snelgrave and obviously made a favourable impression on him. Snelgrave concluded that Davis was a man \\"who (allowing for the Course of Life he had been unhappily engaged in) was a most generous humane Person\\".Breverton p. 252  In popular culture  The legend of Howell Davis has inspired recent works of fiction such as The Noble Pirates by R. L. Jean. Howell Davis makes a minor appearance in Ubisoft's 2013 game Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, where his ship is tracked by protagonist Edward Kenway, who is seeking Bartholomew Roberts. When Kenway arrives in Pr√≠ncipe, he discovers Davis' shot corpse, and then makes a partnership with Roberts and kills the two corsairs responsible for Davis' death, John Cockram and Josiah Burgess. Later in the game, Roberts wears Howell's costume. References ;General *Breverton, Terry (2003) The book of Welsh pirates and buccaneers. Glyndwr Publishing. *Pickering, David. \\"Pirates\\".

It is cleaved into C5a and C5b: * C5a plays an important role in chemotaxis. * C5b forms the first part of the complement membrane attack complex. Deficiency is thought to cause Leiner's disease.  Function  Complement component 5 is the fifth component of complement, which plays an important role in inflammatory and cell killing processes. This protein is composed of alpha and beta polypeptide chains that are linked by a disulfide bridge. An activation peptide, C5a, which is an anaphylatoxin that possesses potent spasmogenic and chemotactic activity, is derived from the alpha polypeptide via cleavage with a C5-convertase. The C5b macromolecular cleavage product can form a complex with the C6 complement component, and this complex is the basis for formation of the membrane attack complex, which includes additional complement components.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene cause complement component 5 deficiency, a disease where patients show a propensity for severe recurrent infections. Defects in this gene have also been linked to a susceptibility to liver fibrosis and to rheumatoid arthritis.

It is located on Serrano Street beside the Plaza de Col√≥n (Columbus Square), sharing its building with the National Library. The museum was founded in 1867 by a Royal Decree of Isabella II as a depository for numismatic, archaeological, ethnographical and decorative art collections of the Spanish monarchs. The museum was originally located in the Embajadores district of Madrid. In 1895, it moved to a building designed specifically to house it, a neoclassical design by architect Francisco Jare√±o, built from 1866 to 1892. In 1968, renovation and extension works considerably increased its area. The museum closed for renovation in 2008 and reopened in April 2014.Official website (in Spanish), plus information from Madrid Tourist Office etc, as at November 24, 2013. The remodelled museum concentrates on its core archaeological role, rather than decorative arts. Its collection is based on pieces from the Iberian Peninsula, from Prehistory to Early-Modern Age. However, it also has different collections coming from outside of Spain, especially from Ancient Greece, both from the metropolitan and, above all, from Magna Graecia, and, to a lesser extent, from Ancient Egypt, in addition to \\"a small number of pieces\\" from Near East.

Murrine can be made in infinite designs from simple circular or square patterns to complex detailed designs to even portraits of people. One familiar style is the flower or star shape which, when used together in large numbers from a number of different canes is called millefiori. Murrine production first appeared in the Middle East more than 4,000 years ago and was revived by Venetian glassmakers on Murano in the early 16th century.Carl I. Gable, Murano Magic: Complete Guide to Venetian Glass, its History and Artists (Schiffer, 2004), p. 37. . Once murrine have been made, they can be incorporated into a glass vessel or sculpture in several ways. A number of murrine may be scattered, more or less randomly, on a marver (steel table) and then picked up on the surface of a partially-blown glass bubble. Further blowing, heating, and shaping on the marver will incorporate the murrine completely into the bubble, creating a random arrangement of murrine in the vessel or sculpture being blown. Alternatively, the murrine can be arranged in a compact pattern on a ceramic plate and then heated in a furnace until they fuse into a single sheet. The sheet can be formed over a mold (such as an inverted bowl shape) and further heated so that the murrine are slumped to take the desired form. Picking up a murrina sheet onto a blowpipe while blowing glass. Another technique using a sheet of murrine made as above is to make a small disc (collar) of molten glass on the end of a blowpipe, and then roll the disc along one edge of the sheet, picking up the sheet on the blowpipe in the form of a cylinder. The end of the cylinder opposite the blowpipe can be squeezed together and sealed. With further heating, the sealed cylinder can be blown and formed into any shape a glassblower can make. Many notable glass artists regularly utilize murrine in their work.

Together with Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (1656‚Äì1723) and his rival Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt (1668‚Äì1765), Steinl may be considered one of the most influential architects to introduce the High Baroque style to Austria. Pulpit of the Dominican Church in Vienna He probably originated from the area round Salzburg and probably trained as a craftsman and artist in Austria, although he may have learned to sculpt in the Netherlands and in Prague. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has one of his earliest identified sculptures, an ivory statuette of a triton (c.1670-1675). He was definitely employed in the 1670s as a sculptor in Leubus Abbey (now LubiƒÖ≈º) in the Lower Silesian Voivodship, where he took over the workshop of the deceased sculptor Matthias Knote, whose widow he married in 1677. Most of his works here (the main altar, side altars, the pulpit and the choir stalls) were destroyed after World War II. Steinl directed this workshop till 1682, when he moved to Breslau, where the prince-bishop recommended him to the court in Vienna. During his stay in Breslau he provided the sculptures on the high altar of Heinrichau Abbey (now Henryk√≥w). He also started as a designer sketching cartouches, garlands and tendrils.some of these designs are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London In 1688 in Vienna he became the ivory engraver for the emperor. From this period dates the exceptional carving Allegory of the elements water and air, made out of a walrus tusk (c. 1688-1690); and the ivory equestrian statues of Leopold I (1690‚Äì1693) and Joseph I (dated 1693) From the 1690s Steinl also directed an important sculpture workshop in Vienna that produced many religious objects, among them the following: * the interior decoration for the chapel of the Hofburg (now destroyed); * the Dominican church in Vienna: the pulpit (1700); * the Peterskirche in Vienna: the pulpit, side altars, pews and confessionals (1726) (he had already designed the dome of this church in 1715-16); * the Franciscan church in Vienna: the altar; * the pilgrimage church of Hietzing, Vienna: the high altar and two side altars (1698); * the statue Immaculata (1688), now at the Liebighaus in Frankfurt am Main; * St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna: two altars (1700 and 1708) with stone sculptures. Around 1688, Steinl became more interested in architecture. The Swedish National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm has a design by him of a belvedere for Sch√∂nbrunn Palace in Vienna. He also worked on a design for Starhemberg Palace (1702), also near Vienna. He was one of the first to use the Late Baroque style, in the manner of Francesco Borromini, in Austria, as architect of the church of Laxenburg, close to Vienna, although the level of his contribution here has been disputed. This church was the first building north of the Alps to contain swung fa√ßade elements characteristic of the High Baroque. It was built between 1693 and 1703 by Carlo Antonio Carlone and continued between 1703 and 1724 by Steinl. The rich Baroque fa√ßade of the Carmelite church in Sankt P√∂lten, Austria, was built by the famous Baroque architect Jakob Prandtauer (c. 1708), but Steinl seems to have been involved in the design. His tower fa√ßade of the Dorotheakirche (1702‚Äì1704) in Vienna no longer exists. His architectonic designs were mostly realised by Josef Munggenast (1680‚Äì1741), nephew of Jakob Prandtauer. Around this period Steinl seems largely to have ceased his direct participation in his sculpture workshop, but he still produced the occasional piece, as attested by the statues for the crypt altar of the Capuchin church in Vienna (c. 1715). He also continued to work as imperial ivory engraver until at least 1712, producing two further major works : the equestrian statuette of Emperor Charles VI (now in the Schatzkammer (Vienna) and the portrait relief of the Bishop of Breslau Franz Ludwig von Pfalz-Neuburg (now at the Bavarian National Museum, Munich). After being appointed imperial engineer for buildings and gardens (Kaiserlicher Bau-und-Hof-Ingenieur) he applied himself to the design of interior decorations for monasteries and churches, including the following: * Vorau Abbey: the high altar (created by the sculptors J. F. Caspar and G. Niedermayr) and the entire interior (1699‚Äì1704); pulpit (1706) (this work is considered as the first High Baroque decoration in Austria with a stylistic and iconographic unity); * Klosterneuburg Priory: a monstrance (1710); the triumphal arches, choir decorations (together with Donato Felice d'Allio) and an altar (1714); the Baroque refurbishment of the main hall (1725‚Äì27) * Herzogenburg Priory: a monstrance (1722). Steinl also made the designs for the reconstruction of the church here c. 1700;the church was rebuilt in the 1740s by Franz Munggenast * Zwettl Abbey: choir decorations. Among Steinl's later creations as architect were the tower of the Augustine church at D√ºrnstein (1721‚Äì1725) and the tower of the monastery church of Zwettl Abbey (1722‚Äì1728). These were constructed in somewhat altered form by Josef Muggenast, after Steinl's death in 1727. Tower at D√ºrnstein Steinl also created many altars, pulpits and portals in churches in Vienna and other places in Austria, such as Lambach and Gutenstein.Gutenstein has some wooden statues carved by Steinl Notes Category:Austrian Baroque architects Category:Austrian Baroque sculptors Category:Austrian male sculptors Category:Polish Baroque sculptors ","title":"Matthias Steinl"},{"id":"5989427","text":"Clansman is the name of a combat net radio system (CNR) used by the British Army from 1976 to 2010. Clansman was developed by the Signals Research and Development Establishment (SRDE) in the 1960s, to satisfy a General Staff Requirement (GSR) laid down in 1965. Clansman represented a considerable advance over existing Larkspur radio system, and proved to be more flexible, reliable and far lighter. The technological advances in the design of Clansman allowed the introduction of Single SideBand (SSB) operation and NarrowBand Frequency Modulation (NBFM) to forward area combat net radio for the first time. Most Clansman radio equipment was built by Racal, Mullard Equipment Ltd (MEL) and Plessey, although headsets and ancillaries were also produced by Amplivox, Marconi and others. Clansman was in use by British forces from the late 1970s and saw service in most UK military operations. It was replaced in the mid-2000s by the Bowman communication system.  Family  The Clansman family of military radio sets comprised nine main radio units, operating in the High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF) and the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Bands. Models were designated \\"UK/PRC\\" or \\"UK/VRC\\", which stand for \\"United Kingdom / Portable Radio Communications\\" and \\"Vehicle Radio Communications\\" respectively. The radios first came into service in the late 1970s; at that time the main advantage of the Clansman radios was that they were frequency synthesised (using switched channels, as opposed to using a variable tuning scale). This provided frequency stability, obviating the need to tune the radio again, once a frequency was set. Previous UK military radios were much less stable, and had to be frequently tuned, with receiver tuning needing to be tweaked to \\"pull in\\" a weak signal.  Clansman HF radio sets  =UK/PRC 316= A late introduction to the Larkspur range, its original designation was A16 Lightweight HF Radio Station. Deployed in tropical or high temperature climates, it was powered by either a standard 12V battery that connected directly to the set or if issued, a Leclanche Battery that connected directly to the set. It was compatible with most D10 or R4 copper stranded antenna systems that were fielded at that time, examples being the Shirley, Jamaica, Half Jamaica and Yagi. Despite not being of the Clansman family, its late introduction to service coupled with its Clansman equivalent, the PRC/RT320 not being ready, meant the PRC 316 survived for just over five years after Clansman was introduced. Once the PRC/RT320 was completed and fully fielded, the PRC 316 was rapidly withdrawn. Another reason cited for its retention was that it was relatively easy to operate and was inter-operable with the other HF Radios in the Clansman family. =UK/PRC 319= Special Forces and STA Patrol man-portable, patrol level radio HF / VHF, half-duplex transceiver capable of burst transmission which was built in the United Kingdom by MEL. Features include key-pad entry of frequency, mode and data with digital LCD display; 10 pairs of pre-programmable channels; half-duplex operation with the option of transmitting and receiving on different channels; the option of using the removable pocket-sized BA-1304 electronic message unit (EMU) to transmit and receive short data communications; fully automatic antenna tuner which can be remoted up to 50m from the set using standard co-ax cable; self-test facility. power output of 50 watts PEP on high power setting with an adjustable low power of 2‚Äì5 watts. Frequency range 1.5‚Äì40 MHz with upper sideband, data, or CW modulation. =UK/PRC 320= An HF/USB/AM/CW transceiver built by Plessey and issued down to company level. The set operates in the 2‚Äì29.9999 MHz range with a possible 280,000 channels. RF power output is a selectable 3 or 30 watts. Derived from an earlier prototype known as the B20,Plessey Electronics Radio Systems Division the PRC 320 can be used as a manpack (backpack) or vehicular radio and replaced the Larkspur Station Radio (SR) A13 SR C13 and other HF radios in service with the British Army. The PRC320 can be used with a number of different Clansman antennas that are supplied with the set; a 2.4m whip antenna is supplied for portable manpack operation using HF groundwave communication. Alternatively a dipole antenna can be used for HF skywave operation. See VRC 321 below for typical ranges achievable using these modes of propagation. The set includes a built-in Antenna Tuning Unit (ATU) which electrically matches the whip antenna length to the radio frequency in use. The ATU can also match any other wire antenna to the operating frequency. The set together with its ancillaries (batteries, cables, audio gear and antenna parts) together make up the complete equipment schedule (CES). The use of morse code and later data transmission and reception could extend the range and add to the versatility of the UK/PRC 320. A number of data entry devices were produced as add-ons such as MEROD, TDED and Kipling. Clansman HF sets continued in use by the UK's Cadet Forces until c. 2015. Many of the sets found their way into amateur service after the Clansman system became obsolete. =UK/VRC 321= A vehicle-borne high- frequency (HF) transmitter-receiver used for inter-company communications outside of the normal working range of the VHF forward area nets; it can also be used dismounted from a vehicle as a ground station with an external power supply or batteries and antenna system. It was also used for rear link communications up to brigade level and administrative radio nets. The set uses USB/AM or CW with an RF output of 20‚Äì30 watts. It was manufactured by MEL at Crawley in Sussex and replaced the Larkspur SR C13 and C11 R210 HF Vehicle Stations. The radio is issued together with ancillaries to make up the operating station, including a power cable, antenna tuner unit, coaxial cables and antenna wires. Other accessories such as the selector unit radio frequency (SURF) were available. The SURF, when tuned, allowed more than one set to be operated from the same position without interfering with each other. The standard antenna tuning unit used with the UK/RT 321 is the Tuning Unit Radio Frequency (TURF) 25 watts. This could be used either attached to the set, or remotely, depending on which antenna configuration was used. =UK/VRC 322= A VRC321 station with the addition of a 300 Watt peak envelope power (PEP) linear amplifier (ARF 250W) and appropriate high power antenna tuning unit (TURF 250) manufactured by MEL of Crawley, Sussex.  Clansman VHF radio sets  =UK/PRC 349= An intra-section level portable VHF FM transceiver. Built by Racal BCC. RF power output is 0.25 watts. Units supplied to the British Army operate in the 37‚Äì46.975 MHz range, voice (FM) transmission Mode and 25 kHz channel separation. A high power (2 Watts) output version was also available and any 10 MHz block in the range 30‚Äì76 MHz could be supplied. Worn in a holster on the chest or back. The PRC349 was added to the Clansman family in 1972. =UK/PRC 350= A short-range VHF set covering 30 to 59.975 MHz. =UK/PRC 351/352= An intra-platoon level backpack VHF FM transceiver. Built by Racal BCC. The PRC 351 has 4 watt RF power output, and operates in the 30‚Äì75.975 MHz range with a possible 1840 channels spaced 25 kHz apart. This radio is also capable of being mounted on a vehicle in conjunction with the TUAAM. The PRC 352 is identical, with the addition of a 20 watt RF amplifier and can be used as a ground station. =UK/VRC 353= A vehicle-mounted VHF FM transceiver built by Marconi Space and Defence Systems. The frequency range and channel separation is the same as the 351/352 with power settings up to 50 W. Antenna systems are provided to provide improved performance in semi-static situations such as an elevated broadband vertical dipole mounted on an 8-metre mast. The VRC is also capable of data transmission and when used in conjunction with an add-on unit (Digital Master Unit) provides a medium level secure speech network. =UK/PRC 346= A portable backpack or vehicle mount VHF to UHF transceiver built by Raytheon. The frequency range is 30Mhz to 390Mhz. AM and FM modes enabling compatibility with airborne units. Unusually for a military radio, it can also work in duplex modes. Power settings are 2 watts on low power and 7 watts on high. It has interfaces for GPS.  Clansman UHF radio sets  =UK/PRC 344= A forward air control UHF AM transceiver. Built by Plessey. Operates in 225‚Äì399.9 MHz range with 50 kHz steps for a possible 3500 channels. RF power output is rated at 2.5 watts.  Batteries and charging  Manpack and Portable Stations. Re-chargeable batteries were supplied for all of the portable range of radios. The PRC 344, PRC 351, 351/2 and PRC 320 all shared the same common battery ‚Äì the 24 Volt 3.3 ampere hour Nickel Cadmium (NICAD) type later upgraded to 4 ampere hour (or Ah). Each radio would be issued with three batteries, and a range of battery chargers was available for this common battery. With the exception of the PRC 349 and UK RT 350 which are 12 Volt (nominal), The Manpack and Portable sets and their chargers were almost all nominally rated 24V DC (Direct Current) to match the British Army's choice of 24 Volts to power its vehicle systems. The Direct Current Charging Units (DCCU) was used to float charge (provide a top up charge while the set was in use) the manpack battery, while it was mounted in a vehicle, using a clip in kit for example. It could also provide a full charge cycle over 4.5 Hours from flat, switching itself out of circuit when complete. (A clip-in kit locked the radio in a convenient frame for rapid deployment when dismounting, and had the charger as part of the installation.) There were a few exceptions where 24 Volts was not used in vehicles, such as in the General Service (GS) Landrover where a 12v system was used for example. A 12 Volt DCCU was provided. The Clansman 24V 4Ah Nickel Cadmium Battery was prolific and for convenience an Alternating Current Charging Unit (ACCU) was provided for use in barracks where up to sixteen batteries could be charged simultaneously or singularly. All of these chargers worked the same, basically providing an appropriate charging current while sensing the battery temperature to detect when charging was complete, achieved by measuring the voltage across two sets of a series pair of silicon diodes in the battery itself, one series pair would sense the internal temperature of the cells the other series pair fitted close to the outer case of the battery to sense ambient temperature, the difference in temperature being used to determine the state of charge. One drawback of the Clansman 24V 4Ah NICAD is that failure of these diodes makes batteries unserviceable. Also due to partial charge cycles due to the 'memory effect' of the Nicad cells. A discharge process could have prevented such failures, but was not provided for in either the DC or ACCU. Specialists can rebuild the unserviceable Clansman NICAD battery. Later an intelligent battery management system (IBMS) was provided which automatically conditioned one or more batteries, a process which ensured only complete charge cycles were applied, in order to avoid the NICAD memory effect. The PRC 349 was originally intended for use with 1.5V AAA Alkaline batteries and provided with a cassette to hold them. As these became more expensive a variety of mains adapters, nickel cadmium batteries and Lithium batteries came into service. The PRC 350 had its own 14V 4Ah NICAD and a battery cassette holding 14 primary Alkaline or Dry Cells giving a nominal rated voltage of 21V. A lithium version was later introduced as a lightweight replacement for the 24V 4Ah NICAD. Vehicle Sets. These were nominally 24 Volt and were powered by lead acid batteries which were charged by the vehicle alternator, an auxiliary engine fitted to the vehicle, or a charging engine or generator ‚Äì particularly when ground mounted or static. AC Adapters, Transformers and Switched Mode Power Supplies. A number of AC Mains units were provided so that sets could be used in barracks. Later ‚Äì a series of adaptors such as the ADAPTER CHARGER DC 14.4/24.V. came into service which when added to the DCCU could be used to charge multiple and various batteries ‚Äì charging 2x 14V or 2x 24V NICADS for example. Clansman Control Harness and accessories Clansman Control Harness refers to a range of accessories which were fitted into vehicles for the purpose of controlling the set(s) and providing other features such as loud speakers, a vehicle intercom system, and switching between two radio sets. Control boxes provided the switching and facilities to plug the audio gear into. Green or black faced control boxes were the standard type. Later, yellow faced boxes were introduced that supported Automatic Noise Reduction (ANR) functionality. These required new headsets to be used with them to work properly, although the older ones were still compatible. Red faced control boxes were used for encrypted systems.  Clansman audio gear  A range of audio gear for use in various roles are commonly provided such as the Lightweight 'B' Vehicle and Infantry Headset (Headset BV and I), the Clansman Handset, a Pressel (Press to Talk or PTT) switch and the Audio Gear Staff User (AGS). The AGS featured Sonovalve technology ‚Äì a feature designed to allow background noise into the headset through a special valve. In armoured fighting vehicles an Electronic Automatic Noise Reducing System was provided.  Clansman accessories  =IBRU (Interconnecting Box Radio- rebroadcast Unit)= Used in conjunction with the \\"Harness\\" point on VRC 353 and VRC 321 units, to operate 2 or more sets as a ReBroadcast (\\"rebro\\"). This allows two or more networks, on different frequencies, to be combined, effectively increasing the ground size of the net. For instance, a vehicle using whip antennas may only be able to communicate 30 km; though placing a rebro vehicle 30 km away could extend this to 60 km by re-broadcasting the signal on a second net. =DMU= A Digital Master Unit or DMU is used to provide digital communications and to provide secure encrypted communications on a VHF network, when working to similarly equipped radios. This required additional equipment such as the BID 250 and associated Crypto key material. =SURF= A SURF (Selector Unit Radio Frequency) is used to prevent interference to operation of the radio sets. The SURF is an electrical filter, designed to reject unwanted interference from other radios when operating in close proximity to each other. The SURF is tuned using a manual control on the front of the unit, so that only the frequency in use, and those close to it, are accepted by the set. A Range of SURFs were provided for attachment to the VHF PRC350, PRC351/2 (SURF 4 Watt) and also the HF PRC320 (SURF 12 Watt) and VRC 321 (SURF 25 Watt).  Antenna tuning and matching  =TURF= A TURF (Tuning Unit Radio Frequency) is an Antenna Tuning Unit or ATU. It is used to artificially lengthen the antenna (or tune it) Often at HF wavelengths for example an antenna would be physically too long to attach to a radio without affecting portability and manoeuvrability. A shorter vehicle whip was more practicable and also field antennas were constructed with for example, vertical radiators constructed using the Racal 8 or 12 metre masts. Because these were an electrical compromise, they had to be tuned by use of a TURF (or electrically matched to the set). The TURF 25 Watt (a separate unit to the radio) is considered mandatory when using the VRC321: it tunes both unbalanced, end fed wires and whips and also balanced antennas such as the dipole. An antenna tuning unit is built into the manpack PRC 320. The TURF requires users to manually tune the antenna, unlike the VHF TUAAM which is an Automatic Tuning Unit. =TUAAM= A TUAAM (Tuning Unit Automatic Antenna Matching) is an ATU which matches the antenna at VHF and which is used mainly with the VRC 353 and PRC 351/2 (when used with the clip-in kit and mounted in a vehicle). The TUAAM automatically tunes the antenna, and artificially shortens it rather than lengthening it, but essentially it performs the same function as a TURF. Clansman antenna A Range of antennas specially manufactured for use with Clansman Radio: = Elevated VHF Antenna (EVHF) = An elevated end fed dipole for use with the VHF Radio to extend the range when mounted on an 8 or 12 metre Mast.

It consisted of 19 self-contained episodes, and was later released on DVD as a full-length movie.  Background  Soup of the Day debuted in May 2006. Its episodes varied from 3 to 8 minutes in length, and were posted on each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to video sites including YouTube and Break.com. Sometimes episodes were posted only hours after editing was completed. The 19 episodes reportedly received a total of over 6 million views as of October 2006. As the story unfolded online, the audience was encouraged to interact with Brandon on MySpace. The character maintained a real-time profile page at MySpace, and received advice from viewers as to which girl he should pick, which could influence the plot. This interactive element of the series came from director Scott Zakarin, creator of the internet's first episodic series The Spot in 1995. The entire series was originally viewable at SoupMovie.com, but was later revised to simply direct users to where they can buy the series on DVD. The DVD was released in February 2007 by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment, and features the original 19 episodes, a re-cut film-length version of the series, and hours of bonus materials including bloopers, deleted scenes, filmmaker commentary, cast interviews, and an alternate ending.

A right- handed-hitting infielder born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Baumer was a graduate of Broken Arrow Senior High. During his active career, he stood tall and weighed . Baumer had a highly unusual Major League playing career. A power-hitting shortstop, he was signed by the Chicago White Sox for $50,000 as a \\"bonus baby\\" at the age of 18 in 1949, days before the New York Yankees signed fellow Oklahoma prospect Mickey Mantle for $1,500. The bonus rule at the time forced Baumer to start his career in the major leagues with Chicago, where he hit .400 (four hits in 10 at bats in 1949, including a double and a triple). He then disappeared into the minor leagues for the decade of the 1950s, and did not return to MLB until, as a 30-year-old, he had a brief trial with the Cincinnati Reds. Baumer appeared in ten of Cincinnati's first 13 games, eight as the Reds' starting second baseman, but collected only three singles and batted .125. The day of his last MLB game, April 27, 1961, the Reds acquired second baseman Don Blasingame in a trade with the San Francisco Giants. Baumer was traded to the Detroit Tigers for first baseman Dick Gernert on May 10, and returned to the minor leagues. Overall, Baumer batted .206 in 18 MLB games and 34 at bats, with two runs batted in. After his big league career, Baumer played for the Nishitetsu Lions in Japan from until . When his playing career ended, Baumer became a scout with the Houston Astros and Milwaukee Brewers, and was promoted to Milwaukee's director of scouting in . The following season, he succeeded Jim Wilson as the Brewers' general manager. Baumer's most successful transaction during his three-year tenure as GM was his acquisition of first baseman Cecil Cooper from the Boston Red Sox following the season. However, the Brewers struggled on the field, and after their eighth straight losing season in Milwaukee in , Baumer was fired and replaced by Harry Dalton. He then joined the Philadelphia Phillies as a scout, and was promoted to director of the Phils' scouting and farm system operations in 1981. Two laters later, Baumer was named a team vice president. His role diminished after a front-office purge in , but he remained with the Phillies as an area scout. Baumer died at age 65 in the Philadelphia suburb of Paoli, Pennsylvania.

He was the first English king to receive a Christian baptism and education before his succession and the first to abdicate in order to enter the monastic life. The principal source for Sigeberht is Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, which was completed in the 730s. Sigeberht was probably either a younger son of R√¶dwald of East Anglia, or his step-son from R√¶dwald's marriage to a pagan princess from the kingdom of Essex. Nothing is known of his life before he was exiled to Gaul, which was possibly done in order to ensure that R√¶dwald's own descendants ruled the kingdom. After his step-brother Eorpwald's assassination in about 627, Sigeberht returned to East Anglia and (perhaps in the aftermath of a military campaign) became king, ruling jointly with Ecgric, who may have been either a son of R√¶dwald's, or his nephew. During Sigeberht's reign the cause of Christianity in East Anglia was advanced greatly, even though his co-ruler Ecgric probably remained a pagan. Alliances were strengthened between the Christian kingdoms of Kent, Northumbria and East Anglia, with Sigeberht playing an important part in the establishment of the Christian faith in his kingdom: Saint Felix arrived in East Anglia to assist him in establishing his episcopal see at Dommoc, he started a school for teaching Latin and he granted the Irish monk Saint Fursey a monastery site at Cnobheresburg (possibly Burgh Castle). He eventually abdicated his power to Ecgric and retired to his monastery at Beodricesworth. At an unknown date, East Anglia was attacked by a Mercian army led by its king, Penda. Ecgric and the East Anglians appealed to Sigeberht to lead them in battle, but he refused and had to be dragged from his monastery to the battlefield. He refused to bear arms during the battle, during which both kings were slain and the East Anglian army was destroyed. Family background, exile, conversion and education Sigeberht ruled the kingdom of East Anglia (), a small independent Anglo-Saxon kingdom that comprised what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps the eastern part of the Cambridgeshire Fens. It is not known when Sigeberht was born and nothing is known of his life before he was exiled from East Anglia prior to becoming king, as few records have survived from this period of English history. The most reliable source for Sigeberht's background and career is Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People (produced in 731), in which Bede stated that Sigeberht was the brother of Eorpwald and the son of R√¶dwald, who ruled the kingdom of East Anglia from about 599 to 624, but William of Malmesbury described him as R√¶dwald's stepson.'His son, Eorpwald, embraced pure Christianity, and poured out his immaculate spirit to God, being barbarously murdered by the heathen Richbert. To him succeeded Sigebert, his brother by the mother's side.' William of Malmesbury's Chronicle of the Kings of England chapter 5 p.89 (a 1904 translation). The stepson theory is strengthened by the fact that the name Sigeberht is without comparison in the East Anglian Wuffingas dynasty, but closely resembles the naming fashions of the East Saxon royal house. If this identification is correct (and Charles Cawley warns that it should be treated with scepticism,), R√¶dwald's wife had previously been married to an East Saxon prince or ruler. R√¶dwald's own principal heir was R√¶genhere (a youth of warrior age in 616, when he was slain in battle) and his second heir was Eorpwald, slain by the heathen Ricberht in about 627.Uerum Eorpuald non multo, postquam fidem accepit, tempore occisus est a uiro gentili nomine Ricbercto (Bede). (There is no ancient record that Ricbehrt was a son of R√¶dwald's, nor that he was a king.) R√¶dwald was personally and baptised before 616 and a Christian altar existed in his temple, but his son Eorpwald was not himself a convert when he succeeded R√¶dwald in about 624. Since it is known that R√¶dwald's wife (who was Sigeberht's mother) did not become a Christian, Sigeberht must have received limited encouragement to convert to Christianity before being sent to Gaul and remaining there as an exile for many years during the lifetime of Eorpwald, \\"while fleeing from the enmity of R√¶dwald\\", as Bede reports.Bede, Historia iii. 18. His exile supports the stepson theory, if R√¶dwald was protecting Eorpwald's succession against a possible claim by a son who was not of the Wuffingas line. Whilst living in Gaul as an exile, Sigeberht was converted and baptized and became a devout Christian and a man of learning. He was strongly impressed by the religious institutions and schools for the study of reading and writing which he found during his long exile. King of the East Angles =Accession= A map showing the general locations of the Anglo-Saxon peoples around the year 600 After an interregnum prompted by Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from Gaul to become ruler of the East Angles. It is likely that he gained the kingdom by military means, because his prowess as a commander was later remembered. During his reign, part of the kingdom was governed by Ecgric his 'kinsman', a relationship described by the Latin term cognatus.Tantumque rex ille caelestis regni amator factus est, ut ad ultimum, relictis regni negotiis, et cognato suo Ecgrice commendatis, qui et antea partem eiusdem regni tenebat, (Bede iii, 18). This may mean that Ecgric was a son of R√¶dwald. However, the historian Steven Plunkett is amongst those that consider Ecgric to be the same person as √Üthelric, named in the East Anglian tally (in the Anglian collection) as a son of Eni, R√¶dwald's brother. Whoever the pagan Ecgric was, Sigeberht had equal or senior power while he ruled, because the influence of his religious patronage was felt throughout his kingdom. Sigeberht's Christian conversion may have been a decisive factor in his achieving royal power, since at that time Edwin of Northumbria (616‚Äì632 or 633) was the senior English king and he and Eadbald, who ruled Kent, were Christian. Eadbald certainly had contacts with the Frankish rulers. After Dagobert succeeded Clothar II in Francia in 628, Sigeberht's emergence helped to strengthen the English conversion upon which Edwin's power rested. Sigeberht is likely to have encouraged the conversion of Ecgric, if he was not already Christian. Edwin's encouragement took shape in the marriage of his grand-niece Hereswitha, sister of Hilda of Whitby, to √Üthelric, R√¶dwald's nephew. Hereswith and Hilda were under Edwin's protection and were baptised with him in 626. =Foundation of the East Anglian bishopric= The kingdom of East Anglia during the early Saxon period Bede relates that the East Anglian apostle Saint Felix came to England from Burgundy as a missionary bishop and was sent by Honorius, Archbishop of Canterbury, to assist in establishing Christianity in Sigeberht's kingdom. William of Malmesbury had the later story that Felix accompanied Sigeberht to East Anglia. In either case, this dates Sigeberht's accession to around 629‚Äì630, because Felix was bishop for seventeen years, his successor Thomas for five and Thomas' successor Berhtgisl Boniface for seventeen ‚Äì and Berhtgisl died in around 669. Sigeberht established the bishop's seat of his kingdom for Felix at Dommoc,Bede, ii., 15. claimed variously for Dunwich or Walton, Felixstowe (both coastal sites in Suffolk). If the seat was at Walton (as Rochester claimed during the 13th century), the site of Dommoc may have been within the precinct of a Roman fort which formerly stood there. =Foundation of the East Anglian school= Sigeberht secured the future of the Church in East Anglia when he established a school in his kingdom so that boys could be taught reading and writing in Latin, on the model that he had witnessed in Gaul. Felix assisted him by obtaining teachers of the kind who taught in Kent. According to the Life of Gregory the Great, Paulinus of York, who from 633 to 644 was the Bishop of Rochester in northern Kent, had been connected with R√¶dwald's court during the exile of Edwin.The 8th-century Life of Gregory the Great was written at Whitby. The passage (in Latin) that describes Paulins' connection with R√¶dwald's court can be found at the Internet Archive. =Foundation of Cnobheresburg= The allegiance of Felix to Canterbury determined the Roman basis of the East Anglian Church, influenced along continental lines, though Felix's training in Burgundy may have been coloured by the teaching of the Irish missionary Saint Columbanus in Luxeuil. In around 633, perhaps shortly before Saint Aidan was sent to Lindisfarne from Iona, the Irish royal hermit and missionary Saint Fursey came to East Anglia from the Athlone area, along with his priests and brethren. Sigeberht granted him a monastery site in an old Roman fort called Cnobheresburg, usually identified as Burgh Castle, near Great Yarmouth. Felix and Fursey both effected a large number of conversions and established many churches in Sigeberht's kingdom. Bede records that Archbishop Honorius and Bishop Felix much admired the work of Saint Aidan of LindisfarneBede, iii., 25. and it is therefore likely that they also appreciated the tasks accomplished by Saint Fursey, whose community also lived according to the ascetic principles of Irish Christianity. Abdication and martyrdom At some point during his reign, Sigeberht abdicated his power to Ecgric and retired to lead a religious life within a monastery he had built for his own use. Bede does not name the location of Sigeberht's monastery, but later sources name it as Beodricesworth, afterwards called Bury St Edmunds. If that identification is accepted, the likely site was in the original precinct of the mediaeval abbey at Bury St Edmunds, probably the 'worth' or curtilage of Beodric after whom the place was originally named. The site occupied a strong position on the upper reaches of the Lark valley, which drains north-west into the Great Fen through important early settlements at Icklingham, Culford, West Stow and others. This was a line of access towards Ely, where a foundation of Saint Augustine may already have existed, and towards Soham, where Saint Felix is thought to have founded a monastery. At an unknown date, which may have been in the early 640s, East Anglia was attacked by a Mercian army and Ecgric was obliged to defend it with a much smaller force, though one that was not negligible. The East Angles appealed to Sigeberht to leave his monastery and lead them in battle, hoping that his presence and the memory of his former military exploits would encourage the army and make them less likely to flee. Sigeberht refused, saying that he had renounced his worldly kingdom and now lived only for the heavenly kingdom. However, he was dragged from the monastery to the battlefield where, unwilling to bear arms, he went into battle carrying only a staff. The Mercians were victorious and Sigeberht, Ecgric and many of the East Angles were slain and their army was routed. In this way Sigeberht became a Christian martyr.Bede, iii., 18. He is among the names of the kings who according to an ancient saying, were avenged by the slaying of Penda in 654.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p.115: 'Thus came about the saying, that the slaying of Anna, of Sigeberht and Ecgric, and of Oswald and Eadwine, in Winwed amne vindicata est.' The Church that Sigeberht had done so much to establish in East Anglia survived for two centuries, enduring 'evil times' (such as the period when the kingdom was under attack by the armies of Penda of Mercia). It lasted continuously under a succession of bishops until the Danish Great Heathen Army invaded East Anglia in the 860s. Lives of the English Saints, written by John Henry Newman in 1843, is amongst the texts that gives Sigeberht's feast day as being observed on 29 October.Sigeberht's feast date can be found in both Newman Reader and Lives of Saints.

He won numerous prizes throughout his lifetime and had his paintings exhibited posthumously at the Paris International Exhibition and the Venice Biennale. He was the brother of N. Petra»ôcu, a literary critic and novelist. In 1936, Petra»ôcu was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy. Membrii Academiei Rom√¢ne din 1866 p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent at the Romanian Academy site He was born in Tecuci, Romania, in a family with cultural traditions. His parents were small owners from FƒÉlciu County, Costache Petrovici-Rusciucliu and his wife Elena, maiden name Bi»õu- Dumitriu. Brother of the diplomat, writer and literary and art critic Nicolae Petra»ôcu, Gheorghe Petra»ôcu shows artistic inclinations as a young man, doing his first studies at the National University of Arts in Bucharest. At the recommendation of Nicolae Grigorescu, he receives a scholarship to improve abroad. After a short time in Munich, he left for Paris, where he enrolled at the Acad√©mie Julian and worked in Bouguereau's studio (1899-1902). From his first personal exhibition at the Romanian Athenaeum (1900), he was noticed by the writers Barbu »òtefƒÉnescu Delavrancea and Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ, who bought him a work. With unbridled passion, he paints landscapes, both in the country (Sinaia, T√¢rgu Ocna, C√¢mpulung-Muscel), and in France (Vitr√©, Saint-Malo), Spain (San Martin Bridge in Toledo) and especially in Italy (Venice, Chioggia, Naples). In his landscapes, light does not erase the contours as in the Impressionists, on the contrary, the rectilinear architectures are imposed by an impression of solidity. From this point of view, the Venetian landscapes best demonstrate Petra»ôcu's anticonformism. The artist resists traditional interpretations, in which the landscape of the city on the lagoon was only a pretext to analyze the interference of light vibrations, in eternal change on water, on colored walls and in the pure air. For Petra»ôcu, Venice possesses a dramatic nobility, a tragic and magnificent grandeur, \\"with the brilliance of ancient relics, evoking the history of ancient palaces, with their serious and fascinating poetry.\\" In an outburst of harsh tones, Petra»ôcu creates a mass of tumultuous colors, through an unusual juxtaposition of faded red, with shades of blue, gray and brown. This successive overlap gives Petra»ôcu's paste an almost sculptural structure, the roughness of the color influences the regime of shadows and light as the accents of a relief. The portraits - especially those painted between 1923 and 1927 - produce an impression of majestic austerity. The self-portrait in the \\"Zambaccian Museum\\" seems to descend from the Italian Renaissance, of a solemn gravity but also with a note of sensuality. In personal exhibitions, between 1903 and 1923 at the Romanian Athenaeum, then at the \\"Home of Art\\" (1926-1930), culminating with the two retrospectives at the \\"Sala Dalles\\" in 1936 and 1940. He participated in the Venice Biennale (1924, 1938 and 1940); he received the \\"Grand Prize\\" of the \\"International Exhibition\\" in Barcelona (1929) and the one in Paris (1937).  Memorialistic, general considerations  Once the time have passed, the work that Gheorghe Petra»ôcu left to posterity, about three thousand paintings and many graphic works, became a dowry of fine art on which all sorts of observations were made, being different all of them.Vasile Florea... pag. 5 Those who studied his work and valued his creation found that there is a lot of confusion and erroneous appreciation in his biography. There were minimizations, invectives and unjust criticisms, many persiflages but also truisms, benevolent platitudes, exaggerations and praise of circumstance. Critical analyzes have made essential and judicious references, often definitive. It is noteworthy that the early assessments that were validated by the late contemporaneity, remained equally valid today. The pertinent, sometimes subtle, remarks made by »òtefan PeticƒÉ are telling in the conditions in which he did not have an overview of the Petrascian work. In the period before the First World War, there were penetrating comments by Apcar Baltazar, B. BrƒÉni»ôteanu (the literary pseudonym of Bercu Braunstein), N.D. Cocea, Marin Simionescu-R√¢mniceanu, Tudor Arghezi, Theodor Cornel (the literary pseudonym of Toma Dumitriu), Iosif Iser, Adrian Maniu, etc. During the interwar period, Francisc »òirato, Nicolae Tonitza, Nichifor Crainic made significant contributions, followed by George Oprescu, Oscar Walter Cisek, Alexandru Busuioceanu, Petru Comarnescu, Ionel Jianu, Lionello Venturi and Jacques Lassaigne. All of them made the effort to explain and understand the creation of the Romanian artist. It is noteworthy that in the press chronicle during the painter's lifetime, the same observations were made, repeated to satiety by dozens of commentators. The art historian Vasile Florea opined that even today the same appreciations are made by those who study Petra»ôcu's work, without knowing that they do it by rediscovering certain aspects that others have stated decades before. Florea was also has an opinion that the process of revealing the meanings of the artist's creation will be completed with great difficulty due to the vastness of the work and its rich meanings. In support of this opinion are the synthesis studies and monographs published after 1944 by Ionel Jianu, George Oprescu, Krikor Zambaccian, Tudor Vianu, Aurel Vladimir Diaconu, Eleonora Costescu, Eugen CrƒÉciun and Theodor Enescu. According to Vasile Florea, the analysis of the artist's creation must be made on two levels: one of a Petra»ôcu in a continuous evolution through a slowness of movement and a steady one, characterized by immobility, which summarizes the first \\"... as ontogeny summarizes phylogeny\\".  Socio-cultural affiliation  Gheorghe Petra»ôcu was born in Tecuci, Moldova. Tecuci was first mentioned in Iancu Rotisiavovici's deed in 1134.A. Costin: Ora»ôul Tecuci, √Æn LiteraturƒÉ »ôi artƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ, a. XIII, nr. 4, 5, 6/1909, pag. 112-121 In Descriptio Moldavie, Dimitrie Cantemir mentioned the locality as \\"... the poor seat of two parishioners who are given the responsibility of this land\\". The geographical area in the middle of which it was established as a settlement gave it a distinct shape and a social and economic life that was defined over time as a separate entity.Vasile Florea... pag. 7 :\\"...Nothing has changed; nothing was ruined, nothing was added to the old town that sleeps shrouded in fog on the banks of the peaceful B√¢rlad. The same wide streets covered with gray pebbles stretch silently, in the dust that rises thin as a shadow of incense smoke spread in a ruined church. The same large and spacious courtyards, courtyards made for abundance and living life to the fullest, are pampered in their patriarchal appearance and the same small and simple houses resembling the comforting smile of old women show their modest faces under rustic roofs.\\" \\\\- »òtefan PeticƒÉ: Tecuciul removed. Autumn Notes, in Works, 1938, pp. 243-251 In a brief analysis of Petra»ôcu's work, it seems that he did not feel the rooting of the environment where he was born because the paintings, which he painted during trips through Romania, Europe or Egypt (Africa), do not lead to the birthplaces, although a few remained there. Without subscribing to the theory of geographical determinism supported by Hyppolyte Taine and Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, who stated the thesis according to which an artist owes to the space where the main features of his creation were born, one can discern in Gheorghe Petra»ôcu's works. Regarding the composition of the personalities of Tecuci and the neighboring areas gave to the Romanian spirituality, Gheorghe Petra»ôcu was part of a socio-cultural enclave formed by many writers like Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ, Theodor »òerbƒÉnescu, Dimitrie C. OllƒÉnescu-Ascanio, Alexandru Lascarov‚Äì Moldovanu, Nicolae Petra»ôcu (the artist's brother), Ion Petrovici, »òtefan PeticƒÉ, Duiliu Zamfirescu and Dimitrie Anghel. All these writers differ from the exponents of the great Boerism who created junimism. They were closer to the ideals of the bourgeoisie and some like Stefan Petica or Dimitrie Anghel were ready to adopt radicalist doctrines. With PeticƒÉ and Dimitrie Anghel, Petra»ôcu had a lot in common, all three being good friends. There is not much information about the places where he was born and where he lived until adolescence. At the exhibition events that took place until 1916, the artist presented only a few landscapes that he painted in Nicore»ôti and Coasta Lupii. Even in the evocations he made in the press of the time, he mentioned only essential biographical data. This syncope from the painter's biography can be supplemented by reading the writings by which »òtefan PeticƒÉ, Calistrat Hoga»ô, Nicolae Petra»ôcu, Ioan Petrovici or Alexandru Lascarov- Moldovanu evoked the so-called \\"city of long sleep\\" invoked by PeticƒÉ.Vasile Florea... pag. 8  Family  Elena Bi»õu‚ÄìDumitriu, bust made by Dimitrie Paciurea Gheorghe Petra»ôcu and his wife Gheorghe Petra»ôcu, Iorgu as his relatives called him, was born into a wealthy family on December 1, 1872. As Nicolae Petra»ôcu stated, their parents were \\"... people without any education, not knowing how to speak Romanian, but, in their midst, important people, recognized by an exemplary morality.\\"Nicolae Petra»ôcu: Biografia mea... pag. 105 Nicolae Petra»ôcu: Icoane... pag. 1 The father, Costache Petrovici, was nicknamed the Prophet by friends because he foresaw the weather. He was originally from Foc»ôani and had settled in Tecuci as a result of his marriage to Elena, born Bi»õu-Dimitriu. \\"...

In order to find out the artist's more distant origin, research must be done in the south Danube regions, George CƒÉlinescu stated that the painter's father's name was Costache Petrovici- Rusciucliu. A cousin of his Romanianized his name by calling him Petra»ôin, so that the last modification would be made by Nicolae, Gheorghe's brother, in Petra»ôcu.Nicolae Petra»ôcu: Biografia mea... pag. 1 The linguist Iorgu Iordan, also born in Tecuci, seems to have known, in Vasile Florea's opinion, that the primary doctor of the city was Petrovici and has changed his name to Petra»ô.Iorgu Iordan: Dic»õionar al numelor de familie rom√¢ne»ôti, Editura »òtiin»õificƒÉ »ôi pedagogic, Bucure»ôti, 1983, pag. 13 Gheorghe Petra»ôcu did not know his father because the latter died shortly after the artist was born. Thus, her mother became a widow at the age of 36. Nicolae describes her as \\"... sensitive to music [her own property and that of her father, n.a. Vasile Florea], singing the lance whenever he passed from our room through the hall, to the living room, and with a kind of philosophy of it, spoken in short Romanian words, whose beauty sometimes amazes you.\\"Nicolae Petra»ôcu: Biografia mea... pag. 2-3 In old age, she was evoked by her cousin Ion Petrovici (probably the primary care physician, not Vasile Florea) who said that she was \\"... a weak and prematurely bleached old woman, funny almost unwittingly and who liked to hum, taking forced breaks only when he was with the world, so that when he was left alone for a moment, he would instantly resume a fashionable area.\\"Ion Petrovici...

This was Carol Davila's favorite student. Constantin pursued a career as a politician, he was elected deputy and was appointed prefect. Due to his progressive beliefs, he was dismissed by the Conservative party of which he was a member. Gheorghe Petra»ôcu married in 1913 Lucre»õia C. Marinescu.

Petra»ôcu Also in 1920, Petra»ôcu visited the city of T√¢rgovi»ôte for the first time and as a result, between 1921 and 1922, he built a holiday residence where he came to paint. The house in T√¢rgovi»ôte had two rooms on the ground floor, the largest being reserved for the studio, and two rooms upstairs. From 1922 to 1940, the artist had a prodigious artistic creation activity in the studio of this house. The house in T√¢rgovi»ôte was inaugurated on April 12, 1970 as House-Studio of Gheorghe Petra»ôcu and entered the museum circuit of Romania. The museum thus created, exhibits photographs, memorial objects, paintbrushes, letters, easel, personal items, etc. In 1970, the museum had a collection of 51 works in oil and graphics approaching all the topics raised by the artist: portraits, landscapes, static natures and even an early painting from the cycle of Interiors. = Specification of the vocation = In 1872, when Gheorghe was born, Vasile (b. 1863) had not finished primary school and Nicolae (b. 1856) was at the colleague of Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ at Wriad High School. The latter two were good friends and sometimes spent their holidays in Tecuci. The historian Vasile Florea opined that Gheorghe Petra»ôcu would have learned to read and write until he entered primary school at the age of eight. Then followed the gymnasium from Tecuci. The drawing teacher Gheorghe Ulinescu noticed the artistic inclinations of his student. Nicolae Petra»ôcu returned to Tecuci in 1887 from a trip to Constantinople where he worked as secretary of the legation. At that moment \\"...Looking out the window, I saw my brother lying on a bark under the acacia tree in the middle of the yard, singing a song. Then, passing into the room on the left, he saw a Christ's Head with a crown of thorns, made of pencil, next to a closet on the wall. This attempt seemed very beautiful to me, revealing in the black of the pencil of the future colorist. I called my brother from the yard and asked him if that head belonged to him. Answering me in the affirmative, you then advised him to learn painting for the first time. Iorgu, who was still a child, looked at me with eyes full of love and obedience, happy with what I recommended. He loved drawing so much that my words and praises watered his eyes.\\"Nicolae Petra»ôcu: Biografia mea... pag. 40  Education  = Lyceum courses = The real high school \\"Nicolae BƒÉlcescu\\" from BrƒÉila - postcard from 1909 After finishing the high school, Petra»ôcu had to choose between attending high school in B√¢rlad or the real high school in BrƒÉila, in Ia»ôi or Bucharest. As the Royal High School in BrƒÉila was the first high school in Romania that had been established a year before, in 1888, Petra»ôcu decided to dedicate himself to science without thinking.Vasile Florea... pag. 10 So, he entered high school in 1889 and graduated in 1892, in his second promotion.Vasile Coco»ô: Liceul Nicolae BƒÉlcescu BrƒÉila 1863-1963 In BrƒÉila, as in Tecuci, he was advised to follow the path of painting. He was not guided by the drawing teacher, a some Gheorghe Thomaide, nor by the painter Henryk Dembi≈Ñski, who was a calligraphy teacher, but by Theodor Nicolau, a natural science teacher who was amazed by Petra»ôcu's drawings for zoology and botany. He spent his holidays in Tecuci where he read foreign and Romanian literature and various magazines he had inherited from his father, such as Cezar Bolliac's Trumpet of the Carpathians and Valintineanu's Reformation. Nicolae Petra»ôcu: Biografia mea... pag. 8 In his cousin's library, Dr. Constantin Petra»ôcu, he found La Grande Encyclop√©die, Revue Bleue (Revue politique et litt√©raire), Revue des deux Mondes, La Revue scientifique and many Romanian magazines such as Convorbiri literare.Ion Petrovici... De-a lungul unei vie»õi... pag. 58 Access to culture was, in fact, facilitated by his brother Nicolae. He had been attending Junimea evenings since 1888. He was an intimate of the artistic circles of the time, which included George Demetrescu Mirea, Ioan Georgescu and Ion Mincu. The three had just arrived from Paris and together with Duiliu Zamfirescu, Barbu Delavrancea and Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ founded the Intimal Club Literary Artistic Circle. = Bucharest School of Fine Arts = As provided by the school regulations, after finishing high school, Gheorghe Petra»ôcu passed the baccalaureate exam in Bucharest. After graduation, he did not take into account the advice he received regarding his academic career. As a result, he was enrolled in the Faculty of Natural Sciences. In 1893, when he was a second-year student, he was enrolled at the School of Fine Arts in Bucharest and for a time attended the courses of both higher education institutions. Eventually he gave up the natural sciences to devote himself to the fine arts. Constantin I. StƒÉncescu As it is known, in 1893, when he entered Belle-Arte as a student, the school was going through a period of great convulsions. Theodor Aman had died in 1891, Gheorghe Tattarescu had retired in 1892 and Constantin I. StƒÉncescu had come to lead the institution, even though he had Nicolae Grigorescu as his opponent. At that time, the school principal directed the entire artistic life of Bucharest. He was the one who organized the Exhibitions of living artists and in 1894 he irritated all the artists, who complained to Minister Take Ionescu. However, he was the one listened to by the authorities, which is why in 1896 the Romanian secession in the visual arts took place after the model of similar events in Western Europe. The secessionists had in front of them »òtefan Luchian who had the endorsement of Nicolae Grigorescu. They launched a fulminating manifesto revealing the idea of emancipating artists under the tutelage of official art.Theodor Enescu...

Gheorghe Petra»ôcu was also mentioned together with A.C. Satmari, Pan Ioanid, Theodor Vidalis and many others. The director's retaliation did not take long to appear, and he decided to suppress \\"... the rewards ‚Äî medals or mentions ‚Äî which they obtained at the last competition held in December 1895\\". Petra»ôcu's 3rd class bronze medal was withdrawn from the Perspective competition.Raoul »òorban... 100 de ani de la... Capitolul I, pag. 4 In this way, the students became radicalized, following the example of independent artists and a month before the Exhibition of Independent Artists in 1896, several students entered the hall where the works for the jury were gathered and destroyed them.

He was always satisfied with the bronze medal and the honorable mentions. Camil Ressu, who entered the School of Fine Arts in 1897, remembered that Petra»ôcu was considered Mirea's weakest student.. After mentioning Alexandru Hen»õia, Pan Ioanid, Ion Theodorescu-Sion's colleagues and Jean Alexandru Steriadi, Ressu mentioned that Petra»ôcu worked with double glasses and that he had a vision damaged by some optical disorders. That is why he used a lot of black in his creations. This feature can be seen in most of the painter's achievements regardless of the period in which they were created.Camil Ressu:\\"√énsemnƒÉri‚Äô\\", Editura Meridiane, Bucure»ôti, 1967, pag. 23 Gheorghe Petra»ôcu did not follow the teachings that the teachers prescribed for him at both the Bucharest and the Parisian schools.  Disciple of Nicolae Grigorescu  Nicolae Grigorescu Gheorghe Petra»ôcu told while studying in Paris that he attended in parallel with the School of Fine Arts in Bucharest, a training program on his own with Nicolae Grigorescu. In an interview that Petra»ôcu gave to Rampa magazine, he stated that the Bucharest school had two teachers, Mirea and Grigorescu.Liviu Artemie: Cu d. Gheorghe Petra»ôcu despre el »ôi despre al»õii, √Æn Rampa din 23 decembrie 1929 Today it is known that Nicolae Grigorescu was never a professor at Belle-Arte. Vasile Florea considered that the artist made this statement because he truly considered himself a disciple of the master from C√¢mpina. The reality is that Petra»ôcu visited Grigorescu very often, starting from 1894-1895, at his home, above the Alt√¢n pharmacy in PolonƒÉ Street, corner with Bati»ôtei. At the first visit, the painter was accompanied by Ipolit Str√¢mbulescu and often, after that, they helped the master to varnish the paintings for the preparation of some exhibitions.Gheorghe Petra»ôcu: Grigorescu, √Æn Duminica Universului, 3-10 mai 1931, pag. 282-285 »ôi 294-295Ionel Jianu: Noul academician G. Petra»ôcu, primul pictor membru al Academiei vorbe»ôte Rampei, √Æn Rampa din 1 iunie 1936 Grigorescu showed the Romanian painter a lot of friendship, helped him receive a scholarship and was a good friend of Nicolae Petra»ôcu who wrote him a biography. Grigorescu and Gheorghe had a lasting friendship also due to the meetings in C√¢mpina, Agapia or Paris. Consequently, the artist published several biographical details about Grigorescu under the pseudonym Sanzio.Vasile Florea... pag. 79 From the data that art criticism analyzed up to the level of 1989, it is not clear if Petra»ôcu would have seen how Nicolae Grigorescu was painting. Even Gheorghe Petra»ôcu contradicted himself in all his stories that remained to posterity. Thus, in 1929, he stated that \\"... we also looked respectfully at the canvases scattered through the rooms or watched the master in his work in front of the easel.\\" In his 1931 interview, he stated the opposite. \\"...I've never seen him painting. I have been to him so many times, but whenever I get there he left pallet apart.\\" In the interview taken by Ionel Jianu, Petra»ôcu stated that he showed Grigorescu the works he was doing and he made a critique full of sincerity.Vasile Florea... pag. 78 The historian Vasile Florea expressed the opinion that it was not necessary for the disciple to witness the way Grigorescu painted in order to consider the latter as a mentor. The reality was that Gheorghe Petra»ôcu kept Grigorescu with a living admiration for the rest of his life. Admiration was also doubled by imitation, because the disciple was interested in the fresh creation of the mentor that contrasted blatantly with everything that was taught at that time at Belle-Arte in Bucharest. Petra»ôcu learned much more from Grigorescu than from any of the other Romanian artists. It is known that Petra»ôcu had several copies after Grigorescu, such as the Woman's Head and the Shepherd with the Sheep dated 1897. It was verbally said that he together with Ipolit Str√¢mbulescu made copies, which they sold at good prices.Petre Oprea: Cronicari »ôi critici de artƒÉ √Æn presa bucure»ôteanƒÉ din primul deceniu al secolului XX, Editura Litera, Bucure»ôti, 1982, pag. 6  Nicolae Grigorescu and obtaining a scholarship in Paris  Spiru Haret In 1898, Gheorghe Petra»ôcu graduated from the School of Fine Arts in Bucharest.Vasile Florea... pag. 12 As the school results did not allow him to obtain a scholarship abroad, granted through the school, Nicolae Petra»ôcu asked Nicolae Grigorescu to contribute to such an endeavor. As a result, Grigorescu spoke with Spiru Haret, who was the Minister of Public Instruction that year, who responded positively to the request. The scholarship that the ministry granted to Petra»ôcu, of 1200 lei (1898), was part of the Iosif Niculescu fund.Petre Oprea: Un aspect inedit al mi»ôcƒÉrii artistice bucure»ôtene din anii 1892-1911, √Æn Revista muzeelor »ôi monumentelor nr. 9/1986, pag. 76-81 Consequently, on November 19, 1898, Gheorghe Petra»ôcu sent Grigorescu a letter of thanks from Paris, 29 Rue Gay Lussac.Analecta, 1944, pag. 87-88 Grigorescu's interventions with Spiru Haret were repeated in 1901, as evidenced by another letter of thanks that Petra»ôcu sent him. During this period, the artist met at least twice, probably in the summer of 1900, with Grigorescu at Agapia where the master was with Barbu Delavrancea and Alexandru Vlahu»õƒÉ. From Petra»ôcu's confessions, he presented to the master some works he had done, Grigorescu appreciating the one entitled After the rain at Agapia. As a result, Delavrancea, relying on Grigorescu's expertise, bought him the painting for the Bucharest City Hall from the first personal exhibition that Petra»ôcu organized. The second meeting between Petra»ôcu and Grigorescu took place in Paris on the occasion of the International Exhibition. Grigorescu visited him at the workshop and studied his works, after which they walked through exhibitions, through the Grand Palais. A third meeting took place in 1903 when the painter visited Grigorescu in C√¢mpina. The memories of Grigorescu followed him all his life and he evoked them repeatedly. The highest homage he paid to Nicolae Grigorescu was on the occasion of his reception in the Romanian Academy in 1937.Vasile Florea... pag. 79 = Moment 1900 in Paris = In 1900 in the French capital presupposes an in-depth analysis of the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century. The triumph of the innovations presented at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1889 had as its first landmark the construction of the Eiffel Tower, when iron was first introduced in architecture. The second indisputable landmark was the outbreak of World War I. Artistically, another landmark was the great exhibition of Paul C√©zanne's work opened by art dealer Ambroise Vollard in 1895. Through temporal symmetry, in 1907, after C√©zanne's death in 1906 and starting from his work, Cubism was inaugurated, a current that had extensive artistic consequences in the history of the arts (Misses of Avignon by Pablo Picasso). Similar to the secessionist events in Paris, the 1896 Exhibition of Independent Artists in Bucharest was a start-up event for a new stage in the Romanian arts. On this occasion, the idyllic dreams of Grigorescu's descendants began to fade. The volume of memoirs entitled The Two-Century Riding of the memorialist Sextil Pu»ôcariu is telling, an analysis that was also limited to a symmetrical period, 1895-1905. Gheorghe Petra»ôcu arrived in Paris after a short stop in Munich. He is the one who stopped the least in the Bavarian capital of all Romanian artists.Vasile Florea... pag. 13 There is no information or trace left to posterity that the painter left in Munich. The power of attraction of Paris has been steadily rising over the years, so that the notoriety which Munich had enjoyed had declined. Munich's vogue had historically been due to the extinction of Forty-Eighters echoes and the growing assertion of the Junimea ideology. Exponents of ideological prosperity were Ioan Slavici, Mihai Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale, Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol and many others. The first to change his orientation was Alexandru Macedonski who lived and wrote in Paris and then Dimitrie Anghel from 1893 lived enthusiastically \\"the new religion of symbolism\\". Petra»ôcu was preceded in Paris by Theodor Cornel,Tudor Arghezi: Th. Cornel, √Æn Via»õa socialƒÉ nr. 2/1911 Alexandru Bogdan-Pite»ôti, but also by »òtefan Luchian five years earlier, and even Theodor Aman, Ion Andreescu and George Demetrescu Mirea in ancient times. Others found Petrascu in Paris. Such were »òtefan Popescu, Ipolit Str√¢mbulescu, Kimon Loghi, Constantin Artachino, Eusta»õiu Stoenescu, Ludovic Bassarab, the engraver Gabriel Popescu and Dimitrie Serafim. With Serafim, Stoenescu and Artachino, Petra»ôcu was a colleague at the Acad√©mie Julian.  Student at the Acad√©mie Julian  Rodolphe Julian (1839-1907), the founder of the Acad√©mie Julian Gheorghe Petra»ôcu attended the Acad√©mie Julian, but without much determination. As is well known, he worked at Stefan Luchian in William-Adolphe Bouguereau's studio. He also had teachers Benjamin- Constant, Jean-Paul Laurens and Gabriel Ferrier.George Oprescu: G. Petra»ôcu, Editions Ramuri, Craiova, 1931, pag. 10 The artist did not have much to learn from these representatives of official Parisian art, especially from Bouguereau who was a champion of academism. In all the evocations that Petra»ôcu made, he passed very quickly over the years of plastic training. He stated that he went more to drawing classes and through the exhibitions and museums on Rue Laffite where he could see the works exhibited by the Impressionists. Of his obligations to the Acad√©mie Julian, only Orpheus in Hell and The Fall of Troy are known. During Nicolae Grigorescu's visit to Paris in 1900, he saw the two compositions and was disappointed. Instead, he saw some works by nature made by Petra»ôcu in the Fontainbleau forest and encouraged him to go in that direction of art.Conform arhitectului Gheorghe Petra»ôcu: Petra»ôcu »ôi literatura, √Æn Rom√¢nia literarƒÉ 7 decembrie 1972  Parisian Bohemia  If his relationship with the Acad√©mie Julian suffered from a reserved attitude, on the other hand Gheorghe Petra»ôcu lived in Paris in an atmosphere full of effervescence in the community of Romanians who were there. He has established connections with most of the writers and artists mentioned above. From their accounts in which his name also appears, there is a moderate manifestation. A participant in the bohemian movement through the cafes in Montmartre, Petra»ôcu did not have any theoretical subtleties like »òtefan Popescu and he was not a passionate interlocutor like Dimitrie Anghel, but he always had a categorical reply. In Paris, Romanians passed by the Cluny cafes, La caf√© Vachette, the Chatelet brasserie, La Bullier, similar to the Moulin Rouge in the Latin Quarter or the Closerie de Lilas. Petra»ôcu's presence at such meetings was picturesquely evoked by Sextil Pu»ôcariu together with »òtefan Octavian Iosif, Dimitrie Anghel, »òtefan Popescu, Ipolit Str√¢mbulescu and Kimon Loghi: \\"...With his tie tied in an artistic bow, you swore that Petra»ôcu was coming down from Montmartre, if his word, which was answered by the Moldavian, had not betrayed another homeland\\".Sextil Pu»ôcariu: CƒÉlare pe douƒÉ veacuri, Editura pentru literaturƒÉ, Bucure»ôti, 1968, pag. 177 The meetings at Closerie de Lilas were not idyllic, even if Pu»ôcariu found a special charm. He acknowledged that due to the fact that the group of Romanians had become too large, with all kinds of people who were not to the liking of others, it was often not possible to achieve a cohesion and an atmosphere characterized by intimacy. Restricting himself to a group of six people: Dimitrie Anghel, »òt. O. Iosif, Virgil Cioflec, Sextil Pu»ôcariu, Kimon Loghi and Gheorghe Petra»ôcu, the new group moved its headquarters from Closerie de Lilas to a cafe in front of Montparnasse station. From here, the group then took refuge in Kimon Loghi's studio, where Turcu (nicknamed Loghi) made tea or coffee. La Closerie des Lilas in 1909 At the Turk's studio, social or political events were debated, especially since »òtefan Popescu, who corresponded with Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea and Dimitrie Anghel had socialist affinities. Also at Turcu, the discussions around arts and literature became exciting. Here he came into contact with symbolist ideas, considered by some to be decadent. Paul Verlaine and Albert Samain as well as the painters of the Les Nabis group were on everyone's lips. Petra»ôcu listened and at the end \\"he saved a controversy with a loud and pressing word, like the thick lines and pasty colors he used in his canvases.\\"Sextil Pu»ôcariu... CƒÉlare... pag. 178 Here, the poems of »òtefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel were recited before they were sent by Petra»ôcu to Romania for publication in the magazine LiteraturƒÉ ≈üi artƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ, whose leader was Nicolae Petra»ôcu. These meetings were evoked by Iosif and Anghel later under the pseudonym A. Mirea: \\"‚Ä¶ We lived in Paris, at that time, a group of young people whom the story had gathered and each brought his own special note once a week, in one cafe or another, and we sat on jokes and stories until late. I recall the past and see around the marble table the nice faces‚Ä¶ Petra»ôcu with his healthy Moldovan humor, rich in anecdotes and cheerful approaches‚Ä¶\\"A. Mirea: Trei arti»ôti: Kimon Loghi, Luchian, Oscar Spaethe, √Æn SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul din 1 ianuarie 1908, pag. 4  The last two years in Paris  In the last two years in which he stayed intermittently in Paris, to finish his studies, the group of Romanians from Closerie de Lilas broke up, because most of them returned to Romania.Vasile Florea‚Ä¶ pag. 14 Of course, these were not all those with whom Petra»ôcu communicated in the French capital. Among the other characters is the art critic Theodor Cornel, named Toma Dumitriu. He spent his childhood in Iasi and was of the same generation as the artist. Also, an important difference is that he did not belong to the category of those from whom Petra»ôcu came and he always struggled in insurmountable material deficiencies, he constantly living in a lucid poverty. Because of this, he probably chose the pseudonym Tristis, with which he signed the chronicles he wrote for the newspaper Evenimentul. Cornel had been in Paris since 1896 and was a regular at cafes where, as he stated, one could write \\"‚Ä¶the history of Romanianism in Paris\\".Theodor Cornel: Scrisori din Paris, √Æn Evenimentul din 31 octombrie 1896 It seems that Petra»ôcu was in a cordial relationship with Cornel because he was supposed to be one of those who collaborated in publishing bilingual magazines Revue franco-roumaine. As it is known, the magazine was founded by Stan Golestan together with Theodor Cornel in 1901, as an exaltation of Le cercle d'accier, an artistic circle founded at the initiative of Cornel in 1899. The circle brought together French painters Gilbert Dupuis, Bernard Naudin, Bouquet and engraver Victor Vibert.Amelia Pavel: OrientƒÉri √Æn critica rom√¢neascƒÉ de artƒÉ: Th. Cornel, √Æn SCIA nr. 2/1965, pag. 291 Cecilia Cu»õescu-Storck The historian Vasile Florea stated that looking through the prism of the experience he gained, helping Nicolae Petra»ôcu in editing The Romanian Literature and Art magazine.Vasile Florea‚Ä¶ pag. 15 Gheorghe would have been interested in Theodor Cornel's publication, because he appears in the editorial team. On the other hand, in the only few issues of the magazine, Petra»ôcu has no published article. What is certain is that he remained on good terms with Theodor Cornel. A bizarre thing is that Theodor Cornel, although it is known that he attended the workshops of several Romanian artists in Paris, such as Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Frederic Storck, Nicolae Gropeanu, Cecilia Cu»õescu-Storck, it seems that he never visited Petra»ôcu because only in 1908, writing a chronicle about an exhibition of artistic youth, stated that \\"...today I see for the first time the painting of this artist and what a celebration in my soul!...\\"Theodor Cornel: Expozi»õia societƒÉ»õii Tinerimea artisticƒÉ III, √Æn Ordinea din 3 aprilie 1908 From Petra»ôcu's relationship with Cecilia Cu»õescu-Storck, which also had epistolary connotations under the sign of Cupid, shows that he did not accept visits in the privacy of his workshop. Cecilia Cu»õescu stated that \\"...Gheorghe Petra»ôcu and »òtefan Popescu visited me from time to time, and I also sometimes went to see their works. What special natures these friends had; Popescu gladly showed me his paintings, while Petra»ôcu, although we valued each other, was darker, he didn't want to see what he was working on. As far as I know, this feature remained in the end; he never liked to show you the paintings before exhibiting them.\\"Cecilia Cu»õescu-Storck: O via»õƒÉ dƒÉruitƒÉ artei, Editura Meridiane, Bucure»ôti, 1966, pag. 49 It is also known that Petra»ôcu never exhibited at the Official Salon in Paris. He sent two paintings but was not accepted. Cecilia Cu»õescu mentioned one of the refusalsCecilia Cu»õescu-Storck: O via»õƒÉ dƒÉruitƒÉ‚Ä¶ pag. 46 and also admitted.Petru Comarnescu‚Ä¶ interviu He exhibited, instead, at exhibitions in Bucharest with paintings made in Paris in 1900, 1903 and later. In 1902, the artist returned to Bucharest forever.  Tendencies and trends  = Tendencies - The moment in 1900 in Romania = Gheorghe Petra»ôcu's artistic training and the beginnings of his prominence as a painter coincided with a great turning point in Romanian art and culture. It was characterized by an acute need for change after many decades of struggle between the last bastions of Pasoptism and political junimism. The young, but robust, socialist movement positioned itself in the immediate vicinity of the latter. By simplifying the phenomenon, it can be said that the struggle was between the national current and modernism. The moment 1900, understood in Romania by extension, from the mid-90s of the nineteenth century until the beginning of the First World War, was called the so-called national moment. Those who studied and analyzed this period,Ex. Zigu Ornea  autorul monografiilor: Junimismul, SemƒÉnƒÉtorismul, Poporanismul substantiated its historical motivation starting from theoretical bases. Thus, the failure to fully realize the demands of the bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1848, corroborated by the unsatisfactory nature of the reforms of the 1960s, led to the degradation of the peasantry situation, which represented over 90% of the country's population. This was a first goal to be achieved and called for an immediate and radical solution. With the formation of the modern Romanian state, the second desideratum appeared, which presupposed the integration of the new state with the Romanian territories outside the existing borders. Thus, all the instruments for bringing Transylvania to the borders of Romania were activated on a literary-artistic, cultural and political level. The two desideratum‚Äôs manifested themselves in the field of art, culture and literature, in the form of a strong national current of a social-romantic nature, a fact confirmed by researchers in the field. The exponent of this current was SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorism that defined itself as a romanticism degraded by anachronism and exaggeration. Ovid Densusianu characterized it as a minor romanticism and George CƒÉlinescu as a small provincial and rustic romanticism. Both SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorism and Junimism, as well as Poporanism, which is no stranger to socialist ideas, were currents that followed the interests of small producers and landowners. They criticized capitalism, blaming it, and wanted Romania to bypass it by expressing its option for an eminently agrarian development. For these reasons, there has been an unparalleled orientation towards ethnicism and especially towards the repulsion displayed for the city, urbanization, as places of loss, collapse and alienation. The magazine LiteraturƒÉ »ôi artƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ ‚Äì 1899 The magazine SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul ‚Äì September 19, 1904 Although the most stubborn sowers had the best intentions, \\"...the tradition turned into traditionalism, the evocation of the historical past, into passeism, compassion for the fate of the peasantry into a peasant mysticism that ‚Äî paradoxically ‚Äî eludes the social aspect of the action, the evocation of the state in it idealization, the national specificity in nationalism and chauvinism, the containment of the excess of translations, in severe cultural protectionism.\\"Zigu Ornea: Poporanismul, Editura Minerva, Bucure»ôti, 1972, pag. 395 By contrast with the agrarian currents, the symbolist movement has shyly appeared at first and then very vigorously and later was called as Art 1900. The symbolists campaigned for the synchronization of local art with Western art, for emancipation from the conservative formulas of tradition.Vasile Florea‚Ä¶ pag. 16 Appearing as a reaction to the dissatisfaction generated by the defeat of the Paris Commune, as a decadent depressive state, the symbolist movement arrived in Romania as an explosive state that lacked the spark for detonation. Romania was prepared to receive symbolism, with Western models playing the role of promoter. An important role for SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorism aesthetics was played by the magazine LiteraturƒÉ ≈üi artƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ led by Nicolae Petra»ôcu, which through ideas, feeling and form made the transition from Junimea to SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul.Ilie Torou»õiu: Studii »ôi documente literare, vol. VI, Bucure»ôti, 1936, pag. XLIX Thus, Ilie Torou»õiu pointed out that he had a pre-similar rumor in the program in which Maiorescian cosmopolitanism was a reason for launching some and withdrawing others. The magazine's tendency was categorical in support of local art and literature, but it allowed, using ambiguous terms, the opening of a path to some modernizations of expression and renewal. On the other hand, taking into account its main tendency, which was a national one, Nicolae Iorga praised her, as there were reservations for the concessions he made to the modernist spirit. By comparison with the magazine SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul, Romanian Literature and Art proved an appetite for the new artistic currents. Because the magazine was fashionable and reflected the progress of things, it received the golden medal at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1900. An argument for this critical analysis is the cover of the magazine, which has a neoclassical handcuff from which rise stylized flames in Secession ‚Äì Art Nouveau style, compared to that of SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul who was as characterized by Nicolae Iorga \\"‚Ä¶ modest magazine in white minority dress, without an appeal, without ornaments.\\" Gheorghe Petra»ôcu lived in Nicolae Petra»ôcu's house and knew too well the guidelines of the magazine run by him.Vasile Florea‚Ä¶ pag. 17 Between 1906 and 1907, he himself published chronicles about art under the pseudonym Sanzio. He saw the need for change in art, just as in literature the less obedient spirits of traditionalism sought new methods and ways to get out from under the shadow of Mihai Eminescu. He noticed that in art it manifested itself in a sowing spirit, a reaction to the sweetened and tasteless idyllicness of Nicolae Grigorescu's descendants, as well as an attitude to mortified academism in rigid forms. Petra»ôcu also knew the Parisian symbolist experiences and is known to have been friends with Dimitrie Anghel. The extent to which symbolism contaminated Petra»ôcu was revealed by Theodor Enescu, who defined the impact that this current had on local art.Theodor Enescu: Simbolismul √Æn picturƒÉ, √Æn Pagini de artƒÉ modern rom√¢neascƒÉ, Editura Academiei, Bucure»ôti, 1974, pag. 9 As is well known, symbolism could never be precisely defined in art, as it has been in literature. The concept came closest to the variations of the 1900 Art style, ie Art Nouveau, Modern Style, Mir iskusstva, Secession, etc. The perfect overlap was only with the Nabi group. Expanding its scope a lot at European level, many artists who are followers of the current can be listed. The same can be done in Romania: »òtefan Luchian, Aurel Popp, Apcar Baltazar and even Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi and Dimitrie Paciurea.Vasile Florea‚Ä¶ pag. 18 Of course, symbolism has two directions depending on what is actually meant by it. The first direction is that of the so-called cultured proletarian artists who were decimated by misery and phthisis and as a result, were prey to despair and skepticism, in which symbolism was the evil of the turn of the century. In this case, the artist appealed to the occultism, esotericism and all kinds of bizarreness. The second direction was that of artists who had no material deficiencies. Their symbolism was one without anxieties, turmoil or drama, and they lived their lives without worries. Unlike Traian Demetrescu, »òtefan PeticƒÉ or Iuliu Cezar SƒÉvescu, they were willing \\"to look at life from a contemplative angle ...; they show aesthetic inclinations, often gratuitous delight, not infrequently hedonistic. That is why they will be receptive especially to the atmosphere of f√™te galante ... tasting of symbolism especially the sets and attitudes of refinement, the thin emotion ...\\".Lidia Bote: Simbolismul rom√¢nesc, Editura pentru literaturƒÉ, Bucure»ôti, 1966, pag. 40 By relating Petra»ôcu to symbolism, it is easy to see that he is part of the second direction, because he cannot be assimilated to PeticƒÉ who said that \\"the cafes and the mess ate me fried\\". He was a robust character and by no means had neuroses, spleen or languor. Petra»ôcu did not revolt, he came from his own vineyards and as a result he had nothing to repudiate. Feeling the routine of the old ways of expression, he understood that the time had come for art to flourish. Having a deep respect for the values of Romanian and universal art, he perceived them as landmarks and fixed them as beacons of orientation.Referirea la faruri apar»õine lui Gheorghe Petra»ôcu, vezi: Theodor Enescu: Sentimentul permanent al marii tradi»õii picturale, √Æn SCIA, tom 20/1973, pag. 95 = Influences, suggestions and options = Gheorghe Petra»ôcu's artistic education also presupposed the existence of some of the most diverse artistic phenomena and factors that depended on it. It is obvious that there were influences of some foreign and Romanian painters that manifested themselves from the earliest artistic manifestations of the Romanian painter. The historian Theodor Enescu meticulously revealed Petra»ôcu's formative years and revealed art critics, all the twists and turns of the path followed by the artist, as well as all the alluvium that his work led to its becoming unique. In this sense, the statements that Petra»ôcu made regarding the examples, so the foreign influences, which affected him during the plastic education, were particularly clear and direct.Vasile Florea‚Ä¶ pag. 19 The interview from 1937 is telling when he acknowledged that \\"for a painter, the first way to expand his possibilities of expression is to visit museums where a large part of the spiritual treasure of humanity has been accumulated. From this point of view I must recognize as masters the Venetian Titian, the Florentines Boticeli and Veronese, the Flemish succulents, the Spanish colorists and of course the Impressionists Renoir, Sisley and Pissaro.\\"V. Cristian: De vorbƒÉ cu maestrul Petra»ôcu, √Æn AdevƒÉrul din 3 iunie 1937 Gheorghe Petra»ôcu in his house in Bucharest Gheorghe Petra»ôcu in 1925 In the opinion of the historian Vasile Florea, the fact that Petra»ôcu recognized some artists as masters does not mean that he perceived this attitude as an obedient one and the lesson they gave him as a direct, unassimilated influence. He stated that \\"...I saw many beautiful things, but I always avoided influences.\\" Taking the resonances of Podgorica as an example, he said \\"...I prefer my glass as small as it is mine.\\" As a result of such statements and of the work left to posterity, it is found that Petra»ôcu had an active attitude regarding the universal artistic heritage, selecting both from the great tradition of painting and from the modern phenomena of his contemporaneity. He chose everything that molded his temperament and his conception of art. Petra»ôcu's way of paying homage to the great predecessors of universal painting consisted in making children according to their works. This fact is also a working method used in art education around the world. Copying works was for Gheorghe Petra»ôcu an activity that he practiced all his life and which he recommended to others, saying that \\"‚Ä¶Copying good paintings teaches the artist the craftI. Masof: De vorbƒÉ cu pictorul George Petra»ôcu, √Æn Rampa din 30 noiembrie 1924... a piece of advice of great importance for young painters it is to make children after the great works of the past. I consider this exercise as a means of experimental knowledge of masterpieces.\\" Petra»ôcu did not understand by copying the obtaining of an identical work, made mechanically, but the recreation of the work making a free interpretation for fixing the light, shadow and color relationships, all aiming at the expressiveness of gestures and revealing the essence in volumes. As it is known, the artist made many copies after Nicolae Grigorescu and, certainly, many after works exhibited at the Louvre. His habit of making sketches, sometimes fleeing from paintings in museums, as well as the habit of making documentary trips, is known as the journey of 1902 with Ferdinand Earle in Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and England or in 1904 in Florence and Naples where he befriended Emile Bernard. He visited Spain, so the Prado Museum, where he saw Francisco de Goya, made charcoal drawings after Tadea Arias de Enriquez with Portrait of a woman and Portrait of Queen Maria Luiza and after Velazquez with Prince Baltazar Carlos in a hunting suit, King Philip IV, Buf√≥n don Sebasti√°n de Morra, etc.Vasile Florea‚Ä¶ pag. 20 With the exception of Grigorescu, Petra»ôcu also had made copies after Anton Chladek, Mihail Lapaty and George Demetrescu Mirea. After Lapaty he made three color drawings of Mihai Viteazu on horseback (at the National Military Museum, Romania) and after Mirea he replicated the composition of Szekler Peasants presenting to Mihai Viteazu the head of Andrew B√°thory. Being secretary of the State Pinacoteca in Bucharest, Petra»ôcu permanently made drawings after the works of minor foreign painters or after the anonymous people who were in the Pinacoteca. Diana and Endymion were identified after Pietro Liberi, The Death of Seneca after Giuseppe Langetti, The woman with red hair after Jean-Jacques Henner, etc.Vasile Florea‚Ä¶ pag. 21 Incomprehensible to the historians who studied his activity, the fact remained that Petra»ôcu soldVasile Florea... pag. 81 through his personal exhibitions the drawings and copies he made.Theodor Enescu: Sentimentul permanent al marii tradi»õii picturale, √Æn SCIA, tom 20/1973, pag. 118, note File:Gheorghe Petrascu - Baltazar Carlos in costum de vanatoare - dupa Velazquez.jpgBaltazar Carlos in a hunting suit by Velasquez File:Gheorghe Petrascu - Danae - dupa Titian.jpgDanae - by Titian File:Gheorghe Petrascu - Femeia cu ulciorul - dupa Goya.jpgThe women with a jar by Goya File:Gheorghe Petrascu - Blana - dupa Rubens.jpgThe Fur by Rubens File:Gheorghe Petrascu - Infanta Margarita - dupa Velazquez.jpgInfant Margarita ‚Äì by Velasquez File:Gheorghe Petrascu - Mihai Viteazul privind capul lui Adrei Bathory - dupa G.D.

Mirea As a result of the copies he made, echoes of the influence that Corot, Millet, Goya, Daumier, Courbet, Adolphe Monticelli, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, etc., had on Petra»ôcu's work can be discerned. Following Whistler's example, the Romanian painter began in 1915 to name works with Silver and Black, Black and Green, Rose and Black, Violet and Gold, Green and Gray, etc.Apcar Baltazar √Æn Voin»õa na»õionalƒÉ din 20 decembrie 1903 Analyzing the painter's experiments after 1900, one can see the influences of Pierre Bonnard and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley and Claude Monet, whom he indicated as his favorite master.Nicolae Petra»ôcu: A doua expozi»õiune a Tinerimei artistice, √Æn LiteraturƒÉ »ôi artƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ, 1903, pag. 29 He stated that he liked the works of Marcel Iancu, Picasso and even Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi at that time when he was viewed with hostility. An important advice that Petra»ôcu gave to the engineer Roma»ôcu for the acquisition of the Goodness of the Earth (Cumin»õenia pƒÉm√¢ntului), a fact that happened later.Barbu Brezianu: Br√¢ncu»ôi √Æn cultura »ôi critica rom√¢neascƒÉ 1898 ‚Äì 1914, √Æn Pagini de artƒÉ modernƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ, Editura Academiei, 1974, pag. 72-73 On the other hand, it cannot be considered that Gheorghe Petra»ôcu was an ardent follower of modernism. He sincerely admired the Impressionists and used some formulas adapted to his style, but he was also a traditionalist, a moderate and a circumspect in applying the new innovations, especially the most radical ones that manifested in those times in plastic art. Thus, he observed the best symbolist experiences and even followed this current, but soon gave up on it. Futurism, cubism, fauvism and other isms did not incite him even on a theoretical level. Significant are the statements he made regarding Marcel Iancu's work: \\"‚Ä¶I can't disapprove of modernists, even if they are so radical and even if I don't understand them ...\\" or about modernists \\"‚Ä¶how much about modern painting with all sorts of names, only those where the essential qualities of good painting dominate. The talented man in all the manifestations of art, as they will be called, does not matter, he will make outstanding works; the helpless will make banging and noise.\\" = Identity searches = As it is known, Gheorghe Petra»ôcu had throughout his artistic career fifteen personal exhibits that were scheduled with some regularity, that is a unique case in Romania. In 1900, in December, at the Romanian Athenaeum, the first personal exhibit took place. On this occasion, Petra»ôcu presented, on cymas, 60 paintings that he had made three or four years before. As a consequence, according to the art critic 1900 was for Petra»ôcu one that belonged to the 19th century and not to the next one. He also motivated this statement by the fact that most of the paintings he exhibited belonged to the spirit and conception of the previous century. Only thirteen paintings were made in France, being landscapes of Montreuil, the rest having gender, urban, marine, mountain or rural landscapes topics. There were also self-portraits, pastel or oil portraits, but no interiors, still life or flowers.Vasile Florea... pag. 22 Country house also known as the House of Nicore»ôti - postcard (1966) The exhibition of 1900 represented for the art critic the defining element in following the artistic evolution of the Tecuci painter. The topic he displayed at the first exhibit represented for Petra»ôcu the strength of his subsequent artistic creation. The landscapes' topics were taken throughout life, from a geographical area of a size rarely reached by any other Romanian artist, the number of places found by art historians exceeding seventy. At the level of this year of the first personal exhibitions, the artist did not clarify his vision and did not find the most appropriate formulas of expression. There were many works left in the sketch stage, some of which were tired of too many executions, which led to an awkward impression of helplessness. Nicolae Grigorescu and sƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorism esthetics were the main factors influencing Petra»ôcu's art for the beginning of the 20th century. Grigorescu's shadow hovered tutelage even if the artist painted at Vitre, Montreuil or T√¢rgu Ocna. But, from this period it was found by the art critics that there were differences between the emul and the master from C√¢mpina more and more important with the passage of time, so that the Grigorescian residues with time faded, finally leaving free the uniqueness of Petra»ôcu‚Äôs work. His painting became more rocky and with a more pronounced material consistency. Unlike Grigorescu whose landscapes displayed a perspective that is lost in the distance, the landscapes designed by Petra»ôcu have limited spaces of all kinds of objects or obstacles (trees, houses, etc.) that close the horizon, so limit the perspective in one linear. As a result, neither the linear nor the aerial perspective have anything in common with the plein air conception, but they have both been transformed into one full of modernity that brings it closer with great strides to decorativism. This feature later evolved in the art of the Romanian painter and became a feature that individualized him as a style, from all the rest of his confreres.Vasile Florea... pag. 23 However, there is another important feature present in Petra»ôcu's paintings. This can be defined by the unfinished aspect of the works, which shocked the artist's contemporaneity. Perceived as a critique of Nicolae Grigorescu's work, the definition of the non-finite made an epoch in those times. However, Gheorghe Petra»ôcu went even further. He pushed the technique to the point of creating an impression of negligence in the work. Nicolae Iorga stated that Petra»ôcu's landscapes have harsh colors, that they appear violently, are bitter and that his paintings can only be admired with a certain mood and only in certain circumstances. The style used by the artist was easily confused with Impressionism, which was exactly what he did: he had a contempt for form and smooth painted surfaces. »òtefan PeticƒÉ was the first to classify Petra»ôcu as an impressionist in 1900. The critic Vasile Florea considered that this fact is not surprising because in those years, the impressionism in music and plastic art was subsumed to the symbolism that was understood as modernism, as opposed to academicism and traditionalism. Florea also stated that when PeticƒÉ said impressionism, he was actually thinking of symbolism.Vasile Florea... pag. 24 Petra»ôcu - portrait of Nicolae Petrescu- GƒÉinƒÉ Other commentators on Petra»ôcu's work often called him an impressionist, with a pejorative meaning. Thus, Olimp Grigore Ioan, the editor of LiteraturƒÉ »ôi artƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ, wrote that: \\"...By his way of execution, this artist belongs entirely to the Impressionist school... Petra»ôcu indulged in a kind of hard impressionism that did not allows you to make a work of greater extent and power; In the genre he has adopted, he will always be condemned to do small works, a kind of sketch that can provoke the admiration of art enthusiasts when they indicate the steps of an artist in the execution of a powerful work, but which, in isolation, will always make you think of a certain impossibility of conception or execution.\\"Olimp Grigore Ioan: Note de artƒÉ, Expozi»õia d-ului G. Petra»ôcu, √Æn LiteraturƒÉ »ôi artƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ, 1907, pag. 107 - 109 That is, in the sense of Vasile Florea, the commentators could not forgive the painter the sketch character he gave to his works, which led to confusion with the techniques of the Impressionist current. Like Olimp Grigore Ioan was Mihail Dragomirescu who commented and stated that Petra»ôcu was in fact a direct descendant of the impressionism displayed by Grigorescu at the end of his career and that the sincerity of the impression resulting from his work is limited only to visuality. He also opined that this effect is characteristic of Impressionism and that art, as a result, is imperfect in its very essence.M.D. (Mihail Dragomirescu): Mi»ôcarea artisticƒÉ, √Æn Convorbiri, an I, nr. 8 - 10, din 15 aprilie - 15 mai 1907 Virgil Cioflec mocked the chronicler for these opinions,Virgil Cioflec: Mihalachemania clasificƒÉrii, √Æn Via»õa literarƒÉ »ôi artisticƒÉ din 20 mai 1907 for which reason in 1908, Dragomirescu returned with a more explicit argument \\"...Here is a painter whose deeply pictorial vision could take him very far, if he would be haunted beyond measure by the manner of impressionism whose leading representative in our country he is. His colored spots live; but their contours do not live long enough, of which he seems to have an instinctive horror.\\"Mihail Dragomirescu: Revista criticƒÉ, √Æn Convorbiri critice, an II, nr. 10, 15 mai 1908, pag. 421 As Dragomirescu was a follower of academism, he categorized any freedom of expression as impressionism. Petra»ôcu's annexation to Impressionism eventually became an art chronicle. This fact lasted until late, when Petra»ôcu already had a typical post-impressionist formula, as opposed to the current that appeared in France in the years 1860-70. A columnist from the magazine Contimporanul considered the painter a neo-impressionist, ie a pointillist who was a follower of Paul Signac and Georges Seurat.Vasile Florea... pag. 25 This happened in 1923, when Petra»ôcu had already made the Self-Portrait that is today in the Zambaccian Museum. The comments are fair but the misclassification \\"...Our only neo-impressionist has the quality of not being a virtuoso. It renders not impressions, but visions, dematerializing the aspects, deepening and achieving mystical harmonies, with the help of a fantastic color, of a hypersensitive paste.\\"Da (?): Expozi»õii, √Æn Contimporanul, an II, nr. 33 din 3 martie 1923  Opera  The last two decades of Gheorghe Petra»ôcu's artistic career are those that gave to the plastic art in Romania a work characterized by a full stylistic maturity, fact for which the paintings he made during this period gave the art critic the possibility to define and decipher most of the aesthetic coordinates that displayed the entire measure of Petrascian genius. As such, 1933, the year in which the artist opened a large retrospective exhibition at the Dalles Hall, where he presented to the Bucharest public over 300 works executed in oil technology and over 100 engravings, drawings and watercolors, can be considered a reference year in his creation. Starting with 1933, Petra»ôcu was seen as a painter deeply anchored in some unitary coordinates that led to a remarkable consistency in the use of pictorial material. Of course, the critical analysis of his work can be made at the level of 1936 when he was received as a member of the Romanian Academy, year in which he made another great exhibition or with the last great exhibition in 1940.Vasile Florea... pag. 47 On the other hand, making an analysis of the work at a time of maturity would actually lead to a critical rigidity, because the diachronic slips towards the formation period of his artistic past are inherent. The edifying examples begin with the self-portraits, which must be approached starting with the first ones he made, or with the means of expression used, starting from romanticism, passing through impressionism. In order to reach a state of grace of maturity, Petra»ôcu went through a difficult and slow evolution that required his tenacity and patience. As presented above, in his youth he oscillated between contradictory tendencies such as sƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorism and modernism, especially symbolism. The artist tried to reconcile the two directions, which later translated into his own intimate art formula. The intimate nature of the new style brought by Gheorghe Petra»ôcu is argued, in the opinion of the art critic Vasile Florea, by the continuous increase of the number of works with still lifes, interiors and flowers. = Sources of style = An obvious feature in Petrascian‚Äôs work is the mutation that occurred in the artist‚Äôs relationship to romanticism, which translates as a constant feature in his creation. If at the beginning of his career, he found his expression in choosing the motive, later, as he evolved, he was included in the deep drama of the work. It is unlikely that Petra»ôcu would have had something in common with the literary-artistic romanticism that historically crossed the Europe of the 19th century and so widespread in Romania. Gheorghe Petra»ôcu belongs as an attitude and temperament to the romantic type, as defined by George CƒÉlinescu in the essay Classicism, romanticism, baroque, which also gave a recipe for identifying the behavior, the hero or the type of romantic author. Just as CƒÉlinescu also mentioned that the two types romantic and classical do not exist in a pure state, but only as mixtures and compromises,George CƒÉlinescu: Clasicism, romantism, baroc, √Æn volumul Impresii asupra literaturii spaniole, Editura pentru literaturƒÉ universalƒÉ, 1965, pag. 16-26 neither can Petra»ôcu be classified as a pure romantic. The prevalence of romantic elements can be seen in it, as the romantics Rembrandt, Goya and Delacroix showed it. Petra»ôcu's intellectual tendency towards romanticism is demonstrated by the admiration he had in his youth for Mihai Eminescu, which he also paid homage to in his own way. Those familiar with Petra»ôcu's artistic career know that he was passionate about Byron at one point,George Petra»ôcu (fiul): Petra»ôcu »ôi literatura, √Æn Rom√¢nia literarƒÉ, 7 decembrie 1972 while admiring the works of the romantics Delacroix, Titian, Goya, Diego Vel√°zquez and Rembrandt.Vasile Florea‚Ä¶ pag. 48 He made children after them, as well as after the Romanians Mihail Lapaty, a student of Ary Scheffer, and G. D. Mirea, his drama being a basic element of romanticism. Another existing element in Petrascian's work is the appetite he had for the night landscape, which in romanticism is a selenary one compared to the one displayed by classicism as a solar one. Similar to the romantic poets, Eminescu being one of them, Gheorghe Petra»ôcu was a follower of the moonlight, even if Nicolae Grigorescu, seeing the exaggerated tendency towards the mysteries of the night and the poetic twilights, told him that \\"...my dear , it is so hard to paint during the day, let alone at night.\\" At such a remark, the artist replied with \\"...Master, for me painting means poetry. Especially the evening, the starry sky, the mysteries of the night disturb me deeply and I feel the need to transpose them on the canvas.\\" The spell of the moon flooding a world of mysterious shadows is not a setting on which Petra»ôcu projected his melancholy, as it was for the English Lakers, Mihai Eminescu or for Caspar David Friedrich, Leopardi or Chateaubriand, but it was a propensity for the esoteric symbolist. On the other hand, it is also true that symbolism is somehow a form of romance. The artist's appetite for black and a dark color range, especially in its early stages, can be explained by his preference for the effects of the night. That is why the statement is revealing that being haunted by the mystery of black \\"...Petra»ôcu sometimes brings the brilliance of the precious color, I don't know how deaf, imperceptible goyish pleasure for the ugly\\".Un secol de artƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ, √Æn Contemporanul, 10 noiembrie »ôi 1 decembrie 1961 Because as Vasile Florea says \\"...and the ugly is also a romantic category, the classics simply not being able to conceive it. And with the abundance of black in his canvases, Petra»ôcu certainly remembers Goya. With one difference, however: while the Spanish painter is radiant in his youth, gradually darkening towards the age of old age - see some paintings in \\"Quinta del sordo\\" - with the exception of The Milkmaid of Bordeaux, his swan song, Petra»ôcu traverses the road in the opposite direction, that is, from darkness to light. And what a drama in this change of face!\\"  In memoriam  in Tecuci there is a Gymnasium School no. 2 is named in honor of Gheorghe Petra»ôcu; * a street in Tecuci and one in Bucharest are named in honor of Gheorghe Petra»ôcu; * a park in sector 3 of Bucharest is called in honor of artist, Gheorghe Petra»ôcu Park; * The \\"Gheorghe Petra»ôcu\\" Biennial of Fine Arts Competition, which has a national character, was founded in 1992 in T√¢rgovi»ôte.

It contains 25 verses of skaldic poetry attributed to the main characters.\\"The Saga of Gunnlaug Serpent-tongue\\", Penguin Classics, (Penguin, 2015), inside the front cover It is an important work in both Norwegian and Icelandic literary history. Gunnlaugur is sometimes Anglicized as Gunnlaug. The cognomen can also be translated as Worm-Tongue or Snake-Tongue. The saga has similarities to earlier sagas of poets, such as Korm√°ks saga and Bjarnar saga, but it is more refined and elegant with strong characterization and emotional impact. Long considered a masterpiece, the saga is often read by beginning students of Old Norse literature.Poole, Russell (2001) Skaldsagas: Text, Vocation, and Desire in the Icelandic Sagas of Poets. Walter de Gruyter. Printed with a Latin translation and commentary in 1775, it was the first of the Icelanders' sagas to be published in a scholarly edition.Hansen, Anne Mette et al. (2005) The Book As Artefact: Text And Border. Rodopi.  Story  The saga, said to have taken place around the introduction of Christianity in Iceland, tells the story of two Icelandic poets, Gunnlaugr Ormstunga and Hrafn √ñnundarson, and their love of Helga the Fair, granddaughter of Egill Skallagr√≠msson, which results in a competition leading to a deadly duel of honor. The story opens with a prophetic dream of two eagles who fight over a swan before killing each other. A hawk then arrives to comfort the swan, foreshadowing the rest of the saga and the love triangle element of the story. The saga then transitions to Gunnlaugr and his upbringing. After Gunnlaugr has an altercation with his father, Illugi the Black, Gunnlaugr rides away to Borg where he meets a farmer, Thorstein, son of Egil Skallagr√≠msson. Gunnlaugr accepts Thorstein's gracious invitation to stay with him, and he spends a year there studying law. During this year, Gunnlaugr and Helga, Thorstein's daughter, begin a friendship which culminates in them taking a liking for one another. Gunnlaugr then decides to travel abroad, but first asks Thorstein for Helga's hand in marriage‚Äîa customary practice in that day. Thorstein quickly rejects Gunnlaugr's proposal because of his decision to travel abroad, but after he and Illugi discuss the matter further they agree that if Gunnlaugr returns in 3 years he can have Helga as his wife. Despite his feelings for Helga, Gunnlaugr travels to the courts of Northern kings to recite his poetry. He first visits Norway and earl Eric Haakonsson, where his initial poem is received indifferently. Gunnlaugr eventually is banished from the country after Gunnlaugr replies to the Earl's followers with disrespect, further cementing his nickname of \\"Serpent-Tongue‚Äù. Gunnlaugr quickly leaves Norway and heads to England, where King √Üthelred rewards Gunnlaugr handsomely for his poem with a cloak of scarlet and requests that he return next autumn. After this, Gunnlaugr travels to Ireland and the court of Sigtrygg Silkbeard. The king has no idea what the proper reward for a poem is, and initially offers a lavish prize before he is counseled to give a more reasonable gift of scarlet clothes, an embroidered tunic, a cloak lined with exquisite furs, and a gold bracelet. Next to be visited is the Orkneys, where Gunnlaugr receives an axe from Earl Sigurd Hlodvirsson. After this comes Sweden, where Gunnlaugr recites a poem in praise of the Norwegian earl Eir√≠kr, who finally appreciates Gunnlaugr's verses. To cement his relationship with √Üthelred Gunnlaugr returns to England. He is delayed for the winter before heading to Sweden to visit King √ìl√°fr Sk√∂tkonung. Here Gunnlaugr meets Hrafn √ñnundarson‚Äîthe antagonist of the saga. Each of them recites a poem for the king. and is told to discuss the other's poem. They both respond by making back-handed comments, resulting in a falling out. Hrafn then returns to Iceland, where he discusses with Skafti the Lawspeaker the possibility of asking Thorstein for Helga's hand in marriage. Skafti references the agreement between Gunnlaugr and Throstein previously made, but Hrafn ignores the objection and says that Gunnlaug is so proud these days that he \\"won‚Äôt take any notice of this or care about it at all‚Äù. After Hrafn and Skafti discuss the issue with Illugi and Thorstein, they agree that if Gunnlaugr breaks his vow of returning after three years to claim his wife, Hrafn then has permission to marry Helga. The story then transitions back to Gunnlaugr and his adventures abroad, where he fulfills his oath to King √Üthelred and returns to England. At the king's insistence, Gunnlaugr stays an extra summer in England, which ultimately causes his original agreement with Thorstein to be void. Gunnlaugr returns to Iceland too late to stop the marriage, and consequently Gunnlaugr and Hrafn become embroiled in a bitter rivalry. It is apparent throughout the wedding that Helga still possesses feelings for Gunnlaugr. After the ceremony, Gunnlaugr approaches Helga and they talk for a while. Their talk concludes with Gunnlaugr giving the cloak King √Üthelred gave to him to his beloved Helga. With Gunnlaugr returning to Iceland, Helga loses all interest in Hrafn, causing him increasing disdain for the tragic hero. They first compete in verse and later in battle. After their first altercation ends anticlimactically, Hrafn and Gunnlaugr agree to travel to Norway to end their dispute once and for all. Dueling became outlawed after their first physical altercation. Their feud in Norway continues, with Gunnlaugr cutting off Hrafn's leg. Hrafn, in one final act of spite, tricks Gunnlaugr into lowering his guard and mortally wounds Gunnlaugr before he is ultimately defeated. Gunnlaugr dies a short time later and Helga is married off to another poet named Thorkel, fulfilling the prophecy. Helga dies a little later, gazing at the cloak that Gunnlaugr gave her.  Court Culture and Gift-Giving  The Saga of Gunnlaugr Serpent-Tongue is the strongest example among the Icelandic sagas of court culture and the culture of gift giving in the late Viking age. The exchange of gifts was common in many parts of Viking society outside of court culture as a means of settling disputes and showing respect, but gift- giving in a court context had a special significance in Viking culture. Making expeditions from Iceland to Norway and England traveling to the courts of wealthy and powerful men and offering them gifts was a way to gain favor with influential people and make a name for one's self. Honor was a crucial part of one's character in this society, and most interactions were based on people's reputations and the honor that they had accrued over their lifetime, so it was a constant struggle to increase one's honor to make one's life easier. By giving gifts to an earl or a king, the honor of both the giver and the receiver are increased. When a visitor to a court comes bearing a gift, it is usually something unique or significant that is intended to catch the eye of both the receiver and anyone who enters their court. In Gunnlaug's saga, Gunnlaug gives the gift of poetry to the leaders of the courts he visits. Poetry was greatly respected during this time because it was not only an art form that could be dedicated to a specific person, but if the poem was good enough and happened to speak well of its subject, then there was a chance that it would be remembered and recited for generations, carrying on the story of the person for whom it was written. In another saga, Audun of The West Fjords, Audun brings the gift of a polar bear from Greenland to a Danish king, and gains much honor as well as material wealth because of the rarity and extravagance of his gift. Because honor played such a large role in these transactions, the heads of court who would be receiving these gifts were obliged to reciprocate these gifts in one form or another for a number of reasons. In Viking culture, people in power often maintained their positions of power by maintaining favor with their subjects, usually by hosting large feasts and ensuring their well-being in terms of food and shelter. The most important part of this was being willing to be conspicuous with one's wealth, sharing it with the people who supported you, and if a visitor comes from far away with a specific gift to pay tribute to you, it would be in the leader's best interest to repay their gift, showing that not only were they being honorable by repaying a gift, but these leaders would often attempt to go above and beyond in their gift-giving in order to bolster their reputation and forge strong relationships with new people. The remnants of this culture can still be seen in Iceland todayRice, James G.. \\"Icelandic Charity Donations: Reciprocity Reconsidered\\". Ethnology 46.1 (2007): 1‚Äì20.

Function  The Ra-reactive factor (RARF) is a complement-dependent bactericidal factor that binds to the Ra and R2 polysaccharides expressed by certain enterobacteria. Alternate splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding two RARF components that are involved in the mannan-binding lectin pathway of complement activation.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Novi Beograd. In wider sense, the term is used for the entire right bank of the Sava on the territory of the New Belgrade, which is partially being arranged as the pedestrian \\"Sava quay\\" (Savski kej). Since early 2010s, the term was colloquially attached to the westernmost section of the bank, the riparian zone which is threatened by the illegal construction of weekend houses in the forbidden zone.  Location  Savski Nasip covers an area of the western part of the Block 18-a and eastern part of the Block 69, located between Savski nasip street to the north and the Sava river to the south. The old and new railway bridges pass above the neighborhood. Savski Nasip is located across the complex of the Belgrade Fair on the opposite bank of the Sava. It also encompasses the peninsula of Mala Ciganlija and the bay of Zimovnik.  Sections  = Savski Nasip industrial area = Savski Nasip is entirely industrial area, beginning with the dockyard facilities of the Belgrade dockyard on the west, through the whole cluster of construction, gravel selling and treatment companies (Brodoremont, Rad, Mostogradnja, Partizanski put, Crna Trava, Inkop, Gemax). Heating plant \\"Novi Beograd\\" is also located in the neighborhood. Ada Bridge, opened for traffic in 2012, crosses over the eastern section of the neighborhood. The shipyard, once named Marshal Tito, being the pride of the former Yugoslav socialist economy, is now completely defunct. The shipyard hangars are now used as a storage space, currently owned by a prominent cargo transportation company Mil≈°ped. The space is rented to many other international trade companies, including Gatariƒá, Mercedes Benz and Porsche. The name of the neighborhood, Savski nasip, simply means the Sava embankment. During the high levels of the Sava waters, the area is flooded, which affects the operation of the gravel treatment companies. = Sava Quay = Prior to 1968, the land along the river was a thick forest while the inland was a swamp which was drained and filled with sand. The area was known for its wildlife, especially the water birds. The residential complexes were built from 1968 to 1972, when the first tenants moved in. The block was fully settled in 1973 and 1974, when the long promenade along the bank was finished, too. By the late 2010s, the quay became synonymous for the \\"ravaging of the investors\\". Disregarding laws and regulation, they crammed floating restaurant-barges (splavovi) clogging the river bank and obstructing the view on the river, concreted green areas, ruined the promenade with heavy equipment and machinery, illegally connected to communal systems and drilled the embankment wherever they liked. Citizens organized in groups against this, organized petitions, protests and traffic blockades, but the authorities (municipal, city, state) refused to intervene for years. In July 2020, along the long promenade, there were 89 barges, which blocked 80% of the river's bank. According to the official regulations, one barge can't be longer than and the distance between them must be , which gives a total of no more than 45 barges. In March 2020, it was announced that the construction of the first pedestrian-cyclist bridge in Belgrade will commence in 2021. It will connect New Belgrade with the island of Ada Ciganlija across the Sava, as the continuation of the Omladinskih Brigada street in Block 70. Public, partially underground garage with 300 parking spots will be built at the end of the street. This is the second part of the project city administration alleged is the result of citizens' online voting (first part is relocation of the Old Sava Bridge on dry land, in the Park U≈°ƒáe to become an \\"attraction\\"). Reporters and public distanced from the voting or debunked it as being rigged. Citizens also protested because of the project, as it anticipates the cutting of the forested area and linden tree avenues along the street, planted by 1974, in order to build the parking lot and the access to the bridge. Also, the expanded street and parking lot will increase the traffic which is descried as 'unbearable\\" as it is. Some architects and urbanists supported the notion of blocking the projects, as it was envisioned on the New Belgrade side. With several neighboring residential blocks of New Belgrade, Savski Nasip forms a sub-municipal administrative local community of Savski Kej (\\"Sava quay\\"). It had a population of 7,560 in 1991 and 7,161 in 2002. It was later merged with the local community of Block 70 but the new local community preserved the Sava quay name and had a population of 20,993 in 2011. = Savski Nasip riparian zone = Shipyard in the eastern, industrial section A zone in the southwestern extension of New Belgrade, west of the Blocks 45 (Sava Blocks neighborhood) and 72 (Dr Ivan Ribar neighborhood). It is on the opposite side of the municipality from the neighborhood of the same name and makes a continuation of the Sava quay, extending into the municipality of Surƒçin. Lower green riparian zone is below the higher embankment with a pedestrian and bicycle path on its crown. Any construction in the zone is explicitly banned and the embankment road is allowed only for the cars with special permits (locals who have arable land in the area behind the embankment), while use of trucks and heavy equipment is also banned. The forests which developed along the bank covered by 2010. The embankment was built concurrently with the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station, which was finished in 1972, and was based on the highest water level in the Danube, to which Sava flows in shortly after this zone. The Danube's level was primary point as when the level of the Danube is high, it lifts the level in the Sava, too. Since then, the embankments were getting higher in all the upstream countries of the Danube's watershed, hence worsening the high level regime of the waters in the river because as the embankments gets higher, the water during the high levels is lifted also: the tidal waves are bigger, stronger and with the larger destructive power. Since the early 2000s, Belgrade plutocracy began building summer houses on the bank, in the protected zone despite the ban. Originally those were smaller, wooden houses but in time, as there was no official reaction, the construction of the proper multi-floor houses and villas with private peers on the river began. Owners of the villas include politicians, judges, managers of the state owned companies and known criminals. Use of heavy building machinery and trucks deteriorated the embankment itself, while the forests in the riparian zone were cut in order to fill the building ground with additional earth and gravel. That way, the riparian zone was elevated, stultifying its existence, as the area ready to accept the excess waters during floods was reduced. Another problem caused by the houses is possible contamination of 16 Ranney collectors in this area, which are part of Belgrade's water supply system. The houses also physically obstruct access to the wells for the communal services. None of the floods that hit Serbia since then, including the massive 2009 European floods and 2014 Southeast Europe floods, prompted authorities to stop the destruction of the zone. Dragan ƒêilas, mayor of Belgrade 2008-13, publicly stated that city has no money to tangle the problem, thus allowing the continued construction. After the 2012 elections and the political change, it turned out that some of the highest officials of the new political elite have villas on the Savski Nasip, including the President of Serbia Tomislav Nikoliƒá, his sons and his son's father-in-law, government minister and ambassador Milan Baƒçeviƒá. The Minister for Construction until 2014, Velimir Iliƒá publicly refused to demolish the illegal houses, saying that everything should be legalized. His successor, Zorana Mihajloviƒá, addressed the issue several times, but didn't say or do anything to fix the problem. She was always talking about the legalization of the houses, like Iliƒá, but the law says that the constructions in the forbidden zone can't be legalized at all. Number of houses, in New Belgrade section only, grew to over 120 by 2017, so the path on the embankment was de facto turned into the street. That caused frequent clashes with the pedestrians, joggers and bicyclists as the majority of the proprietors of the illegal houses are wealthy and drive too fast over the embankment in powerful cars and SUVs. Since 2016, citizens began to gather at the entry point, protesting and blocking the illegal traffic. Protesters organized in several associations (\\"Streets for the bicyclists\\", \\"Savski Nasip\\") and even though the protests became regular, neither the city or state authorities have done anything to solve even the path problem, instead it appears as if they are enabling it. Serbian Academy of the engineering sciences issued a warning in November 2017 saying that the usurpation of the riparian zones is widespread in Serbia, but that Belgrade is the most endangered. They stated that construction is against several legislative acts (Spatial plan of Serbia, Law on waters, Criminal Law of Serbia) and described it as something \\"unheard in the civilized world\\". They pointed out that the \\"terrifying irresponsible destruction\\" is also colliding with the European Union floods directive which is binding for Serbia even though it is not an EU member and pleaded the state saying that costs of the protection are way less that the costs of damage repair after the floods. The settlement also became unofficially known as Sojenice (\\"stilt houses\\"). As of April 2017, houses are still being built and the illegal proprietors even paved the access roads so that they can easily reach their summer houses. Minister Mihajloviƒá stated that if the case of paving the embankment road is a matter for the state, the government will react. In May 2017 president of the municipality of New Belgrade Aleksandar ≈†apiƒá announced his candidacy for the mayor of Belgrade. Immediately a smear campaign against him, headed by the city manager Goran Vesiƒá began, including a matter of an illegal object in the neighborhood of Studentski Grad, built by ≈†apiƒá's uncle. Vesiƒá also mentioned a house of ≈†apiƒá's uncle on Savski Nasip, which prompted ≈†apiƒá to publicly announce that the municipality will demolish all 120 objects, even though it was the city administration which was dragging out with the proper documentation for the demolition. A group of 23, mostly abandoned objects, was demolished from 6 to 12 June 2017. Minister for the environmental protection, Goran Trivan, stated in January 2018 that building in the zones of protection is inadmissible and that the best solution would be to demolish everything that was built. He added that there are certain modern technologies which could be applied to protect the water extracting Ranney collectors, but that it is way too expensive. However, further undisturbed construction and degradation of the embankment continued.

The term can refer to a general category of dishes that involve the same process, and one particularly well-known version is the back-of-the- box recipe on thin and dark Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers. History The icebox cake is derived from similar desserts such as the charlotte and the trifle, but made to be more accessible for housewives to prepare. It was first introduced to the United States in the 1930s, as companies were promoting the icebox as a kitchen appliance. Its popularity rose in the 1920s and 30s, as it used many commercial shortcuts and pre-made ingredients. In response to the dish's popularity, companies that manufactured ingredients for the cake, such as condensed milk and wafer cookies, began printing recipes on the backs of their boxes. Regional variations =American= The Nabisco version of the icebox cake indicates that the wafers are stacked to form a log with whipped cream cementing them together, and then the log is laid on its side. A second log is formed and the two are set side-by-side and more whipped cream covers the exterior. The cake is then left overnight in the refrigerator (or icebox). The wafers absorb moisture from the whipped cream and the whole can be served in slices. The dessert is usually served by cutting it into slices at a 45-degree angle, so bands of chocolate and cream are visible across each slice. A variation of icebox cake is made using pudding (usually chocolate) and graham crackers or vanilla wafers layered in a square or rectangular baking dish. Additional variations include alternating layers of chocolate and vanilla pudding, or the addition of sliced bananas or pineapples between the layers. While this can be done with cold instant pudding, if given ample time in the refrigerator, the best results come from assembling the dessert with still-hot stove-cooked pudding, and then refrigerating overnight. =Australian= In Australia the cake is made from Arnott's Chocolate Ripple biscuits, hence the name in that country of Chocolate Ripple cake. The biscuits are covered in sweetened whipped cream, and placed in a log formation. It is often decorated with crumbled chocolate, fresh berries or grated Peppermint Crisp. =Philippine= Mango float from the Philippines, an icebox cake variant of crema de fruta In the Philippines, mango float is a popular icebox cake variant of the traditional crema de fruta layered dessert. It is made with graham crackers or broas (ladyfingers) in between layers of whipped cream, condensed milk, and fresh mangoes. =United Kingdom= A biscuit cake is an icebox cake commonly served as a tea cake in the United Kingdom. At the request of Prince William a chocolate biscuit cake was served as a groom's cake at his wedding. It is made by heating butter and chocolate and whisking in eggs or condensed milk.

We are given a graph G, and the goal is to find a matching containing as many edges as possible, that is, a maximum cardinality subset of the edges such that each vertex is adjacent to at most one edge of the subset. As each edge will cover exactly two vertices, this problem is equivalent to the task of finding a matching that covers as many vertices as possible. An important special case of the maximum cardinality matching problem is when G is a bipartite graph, whose vertices V are partitioned between left vertices in X and right vertices in Y, and edges in E always connect a left vertex to a right vertex. In this case, the problem can be efficiently solved with simpler algorithms than in the general case.  Algorithms for bipartite graphs  The simplest way to compute a maximum cardinality matching is to follow the Ford‚ÄìFulkerson algorithm. This algorithm solves the more general problem of computing the maximum flow, but can be easily adapted: we simply transform the graph into a flow network by adding a source vertex to the graph with an having to all left vertices in X, adding a sink vertex having an edge from all right vertices in Y, keeping all edges between X and Y, and giving a capacity of 1 to each edge. The Ford‚ÄìFulkerson algorithm will then proceed by repeatedly finding an augmenting path from some to some and updating the matching M by taking the symmetric difference of that path with M (assuming such a path exists). As each path can be found in \\\\ O(E) time, the running time is \\\\ O(V E), and the maximum matching consists of the edges of E that carry flow from X to Y. An improvement to this algorithm is given by the more elaborate Hopcroft‚ÄìKarp algorithm, which searches for multiple augmenting paths simultaneously. This algorithm runs in O(\\\\sqrt{V}E) time. The algorithm of Chandran and Hochbaum for bipartite graphs runs in time that depends on the size of the maximum matching k, which for X<Y is O\\\\left(\\\\min\\\\\\\\{Xk,E\\\\\\\\}+ \\\\sqrt{k} \\\\min \\\\\\\\{k^2,E\\\\\\\\}\\\\right). Using boolean operations on words of size \\\\lambda the complexity is further improved to O\\\\left(\\\\min \\\\left\\\\\\\\{Xk, \\\\frac{XY}{\\\\lambda}, E\\\\right\\\\\\\\} + k^2 + \\\\frac{k^{2.5}}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right). More efficient algorithms exist for special kinds of bipartite graphs: * For sparse bipartite graphs, the maximum matching problem can be solved in \\\\tilde{O}(E^{10/7}) with Madry's algorithm based on electric flows. * For planar bipartite graphs, the problem can be solved in time O(n\\\\log^3 n) where n is the number of vertices, by reducing the problem to maximum flow with multiple sources and sinks.  Algorithms for arbitrary graphs  The blossom algorithm finds a maximum-cardinality matching in general (not bipartite) graphs. It runs in time O(V^2 \\\\cdot E). A better performance of for general graphs, matching the performance of the Hopcroft‚ÄìKarp algorithm on bipartite graphs, can be achieved with the much more complicated algorithm of Micali and Vazirani.. The same bound was achieved by an algorithm by Blum (de) and an algorithm by Gabow and Tarjan. An alternative approach uses randomization and is based on the fast matrix multiplication algorithm. This gives a randomized algorithm for general graphs with complexity O(V^{2.376}). This is better in theory for sufficiently dense graphs, but in practice the algorithm is slower.. Other algorithms for the task are reviewed by Duan and Pettie (see Table I). In terms of approximation algorithms, they also point out that the blossom algorithm and the algorithms by Micali and Vazirani can be seen as approximation algorithms running in linear time for any fixed error bound.  Applications and generalizations  By finding a maximum- cardinality matching, it is possible to decide whether there exists a perfect matching. * The problem of finding a matching with maximum weight in a weighted graph is called the maximum weight matching problem problem, and its restriction to bipartite graphs is called the assignment problem. If each vertex can be matched to several vertices at once, then this is a generalized assignment problem. * A priority matching is a particular maximum-cardinality matching in which prioritized vertices are matched first. * The problem of finding a maximum-cardinality matching in a hypergraph is NP-complete even for 3-uniform hypergraphs.

It is a sequel to Wild Things (1998) and the second film in the Wild Things series. The film was released on DVD on April 20, 2004. Plot Brittney Havers, a South Florida high school senior, lives with her wealthy stepfather, Niles Dunlap, after her mother ran her car off the road in \\"Gator Alley\\" and was presumably eaten by alligators a year earlier. When Dunlap is killed in a private plane crash, his will calls for Brittney to receive a small stipend until she finishes college, after which she will receive only $25,000 a year for life from the estate. The rest of Dunlap's assets, totaling $70 million, are to be left to a corporate trust, unless a blood heir can be found. Brittney's brash, relatively poor classmate Maya King suddenly claims to be Dunlap's illegitimate daughter as the result of her mother's extramarital affair. She is ordered by a judge to submit to a DNA test, the result of which proves she is Dunlap's child. At the Dunlap home, Brittney hears a noise on her way to the wine cellar but it turns out to just be rats. Suddenly Maya appears and the girls reveal they are lovers before being joined by Dr. Julian Haynes, who had arranged the DNA test. The trio are in cahoots, running a scam to secure and share Dunlap's fortune. Insurance investigator Terence Bridge, investigating the circumstances of the plane crash, finds out from Dunlap's medical records that Dunlap had scarlet fever as a child, one of the side effects of which can be sterility, and asks Dr. Haynes how Dunlap could have fathered a child. Dr. Haynes gets nervous about the plot unraveling and contacts Maya. He agrees to meet her and Brittney that night at the docks, where Maya shoots him. The two girls dispose of his body in Gator Alley. After Bridge learns the entire affair was planned, he shows up at the Dunlap home and demands half the money in return for not going to the police. Brittney, refusing to give up any of the money, gets a gun and points it at Bridge, but instead kills Maya. She tells Bridge that he has to earn his half. He loads Maya's body into the trunk of his car and he and Brittney drive off to dispose of it. When they stop at a traffic light, Brittney gets out of the car and walks away as a police car pulls up behind them. Bridge can do nothing but drive away when the traffic light turns green and the police car honks at him to get moving. Brittney phones in an anonymous tip that Bridge's car trunk has Maya's body in it. He is soon arrested and jailed. A videotape from the Dunlap home security system shows Bridge demanding half of the inheritance money from Brittney and Maya. Later, Brittney flies off in a private plane with the very much alive Dunlap, who had faked his own death to escape prosecution for misappropriating millions of dollars of corporate funds to pay his gambling debts, and also to avoid the Cuban gambler Cicatriz, to whom he still owed millions. Brittney and Dunlap don parachutes, planning to bail out over swampland and disappear together. As Dunlap is poised to bail out, Brittney reveals that she packed his chute with newspaper and pushes him from the plane to his death. She then bails out, landing safely in the swamp, where her mother, also very much alive, is waiting for her in a swamp boat. It is revealed that Brittney and her mother orchestrated everything, including the deaths of Brittney's co-conspirators, in order to steal Dunlap's fortune, and they relax in the sun on a tropical island. Brittney comes down the stairs of their villa overlooking the ocean with two drinks and hands one to her mother. As Brittney watches intently, her mother takes a sip and remarks that the drink is strong. Brittney replies, with a wry smile, \\"They do make them strong here, don't they?\\" With that, it is left to the audience to decide whether or not Brittney has poisoned the drink.

The Cork Suburban Rail (Irish: Iarnr√≥d Fobhailteach Chorca√≠) network serves areas of County Cork, in Munster in Ireland. There has been a suburban rail system in Cork since the middle of the 19th century; however, it suffered line closures in the 20th century. The city also had a tram network - a short-lived horse-tram service in the 1870s and an electric tram system between 1898 and 1931. The Cork Suburban Rail network operates on three lines, and is served by 10 stations. In 2018, there were 3.46 million passenger journeys on the Cork to Dublin line (up 10% from 2017), 908,000 on the Cork to Cobh line, and 437,000 on the Cork-Midleton line (up 5.8%). Cork to Mallow Three services run from Cork Kent to Mallow. Dedicated commuter services using 2600 class railcars supplement stops at Mallow and Cork by 22000 class railcar operated services from Cork to Tralee and Mark 4 locomotive hauled coach services from Cork to Heuston Station, Dublin. Mallow is served by seven commuter trains, three intercity trains from Cork to Tralee, and 14 intercity trains from Cork to Heuston per day. A single weekday service, the 06:15 Cork-Heuston express, does not stop at Mallow. Cork to Cobh Services run from Cork Kent to Little Island, Glounthaune, Fota, Carrigaloe, Rushbrooke, Cobh. The Cork-Cobh journey takes 24 minutes, stopping at all stations. There are 23 services in each direction on weekdays, running hourly for most of the day and half-hourly at peak times. The service is provided by two-coach 2600 Class diesel railcar sets, although trains of two sets are used when to service the arrival of international cruise liners in Cobh. Fota station is especially busy during summer months, as the station serves visitors to Fota Wildlife Park. Cork to Midleton Services run from Cork Kent to Little Island, Glounthaune, Carrigtwohill and Midleton. There are 22 trains a day each way - Hourly off peak and half-hourly during peak times. The journey time between Cork and Midleton is 23 minutes, and together with the existing Cork - Cobh services there are 45 trains a day from Glounthaune & Little Island to Cork. This project was funded under the Irish Government's Transport 21 investment programme and opened on 31 July 2009. It involved the provision of a 10 km (6.25 miles) single track railway to Midleton with a passing loop at Carrigtwohill, new bridges to replace level crossings, improving existing bridges, new signalling systems and the reopening of Carrigtwohill and Midleton stations. The former Cork-Youghal rail line east of Glounthaune was closed to scheduled rail traffic in the mid 1970s. The line to Youghal railway station had irregular freight and \\"special\\" passenger train traffic up until 1988 when it was fully closed and became derelict. After calls and political pressure for its re-opening, it was proposed under Transport 21 to renew the line as far as Midleton. After numerous delays, construction finally began in early 2008, and it opened in July 2009.Irish Times - Cork-Midleton rail line to open - 30 July 2009 Future The Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy 2040 proposes the electrification of the suburban rail and the addition of new stations on the Cork-Cobh line at Tivoli, Dunkettle, Ballynoe, Carrigtwohill West and Water Rock, and at Blarney, Monard, and Blackpool on the Mallow line. A proposal to reopen the Tivoli station was included in a planned urban regeneration scheme driven by the relocation of the Port of Cork from Tivoli to Ringaskiddy.

Factor D is involved in the alternative complement pathway of the complement system where it cleaves factor B.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the trypsin family of peptidases. The encoded protein is a component of the alternative complement pathway best known for its role in humoral suppression of infectious agents. This protein is also a serine protease that is secreted by adipocytes into the bloodstream. Finally, the encoded protein has a high level of expression in fat, suggesting a role for adipose tissue in immune system biology. Alternative pathway. ( 4. Is factor D cleaving B to Bb and Ba) Factor D is a serine protease that stimulates glucose transport for triglyceride accumulation in fats cells and inhibits lipolysis.  Clinical significance  The level of Factor D is decreased in obese, this reduction may be due to high activity or resistance but exact cause is not totally known.  Structure  All members of the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases have very similar structures. In all cases, including factor D, there are two antiparallel Œ≤-barrel domains with each barrel containing six Œ≤-strands with the same typology in all enzymes. The major difference in backbone structure between Factor D and the other serine proteases of the chymotrpsin family is in the surface loops connecting the secondary structural elements. Factor D displays different conformations of major catalytic and substrate-binding residues typically found in the chrotrypsin family. These features suggest the catalytic activity of factor D is prohibited unless conformational changes are induced by a realignment.  Mechanism of Action  Factor D is a serine protease present in blood and tissue in an active sequence but self-inhibited conformation. The only known natural substrate of Factor D is Factor B, and cleavage of the Arg234-Lys235 scissile bond in Factor B results in two Factor B fragments, Ba and Bb. Before cleavage of the scissile bond in Factor B can occur, Factor B must first bind with C3b before to form the C3bB complex. It is proposed that this conformational change of Factor B in the C3bB complex allows Factor B to fit into the binding site of Factor D. The catalytic triad of Factor D is composed of Asp102, His57 and Ser195. Other key components of Factor D are an Asp189-Arg218 salt bridge that stabilizes a self-inhibitory loop (amino acid residues 212 to 218) and His57 side chain in the non-canonical conformation. In its inhibited form, the self-inhibitory loop prevents access of Factor B to Factor D. When the self-inhibited conformation of Factor D is approached by the C3bB complex, C3bB displaces the salt bridge in Factor D and results in a new salt bridge between the Arg234 of Factor B and Asp189 of Factor D. The displacement of the Factor D salt bridge results in a realignment of the self- inhibitory loop and a rotation of the active site histidine side chain, creating the canonical form of Factor D. Cleavage of the scissile bond in Factor B then ensues, releasing fragment Ba and forming C3bBb, the alternative pathway C3-convertase. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  The non-canonical conformation of Factor D is inhibited by the self-inhibitory loop (blue). The Asp-Arg salt bridge (purple and orange side chains, respectively) stabilizes the self-inhibitory loop. The catalytic triad is shown in green.  The canonical conformation of Factor D is not self-inhibited. The Asp-Arg salt bridge (purple and orange side chains, respectively) has been displaced resulting in a shift in the self inhibitory loop (blue). The catalytic triad is shown in green. }  Regulation  Factor D is synthesized by the liver and adipocytes with the latter being the major source. The pro-form of Factor D that is secreted is cleaved by MASP-3 to form the active sequence that circulates in the body. Factor D maintains an extremely high substrate specificity, and as a result has no known natural inhibitors in the body. However, most of Factor D remains in the self-inhibited form that limits substrate access to the catalytic site. Factor D has a molecular weight of 23.5 kD and is present at a concentration of 1.8 mg/L of blood in healthy humans. The synthesis rate of Factor is approximately 1.33 mg/kg/day, and most of Factor D is eliminated through the kidney after catabolism in proximal tubules after re-absorption. The net effect is a high fractional metabolic rate of 60% per hour. In patients with normal kidney function, no Factor D was detectable in urine. However, in patients with renal disease, Factor D was found at elevated levels. The alternative pathway is capable of operating even at low levels of Factor D, and deficiencies in levels of Factor D are rare.  Role in Diseases  A point mutation resulting in the replacement of a serine codon (Ser42 in the unprocessed methionine form of Factor D) with a stop codon (TAG) in the Factor D gene on chromosome 19 has been documented as a cause of Factor D deficiency. Deficiency in Factor D may cause an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, specifically Neisseria infections. The mode of inheritance of Factor D deficiency is autosomal recessive, and individuals with a mutation on only one allele may not experience the same susceptibility to reoccurring infections. In a patient with reoccurring infections, complete improvement in the condition was obtained by introducing purified Factor D. Diseases with excessive complement activation include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and inhibitors of Factor D may have utility in the treatment of PNH. Small molecule inhibitors of Factor D are under development for the treatment of PNH, and one small molecule inhibitor, ACH-4471, has shown promise in a Phase 2 clinical trial for Factor D inhibition when combined with eculizumab. Patients treated with Factor D inhibitors must be immunized against infections in order to avoid reoccurring infections as in patients with Factor D deficiency.

From West to East it consists of: * Two southward lanes * The pedestrian walk * A southward Bus lane * Three southward lanes * Three northward lanes * A median strip lined with trees, flowerbeds, etc. * Two northward lanes * A northward Bus lane.  History  The after a snowfall in January 1907, by Go√±i. First stretch of the walk. By the end of the 18th century architect Jos√© de Hermosilla was entrusted by King Charles III to urbanize the area of the old Bajo Abro√±igal (or Valnegral) river, which flowed from Chamart√≠n to Plaza Atocha. This gave birth to Paseo del Prado as well to Paseo de Recoletos. The name \\"Recoletos\\" was taken from an old convent of Augustinian Recollect friars built in 1592 in the area. The boulevard originally ended in the old Puerta de Recoletos, a baroque gate built under Ferdinand VI in 1756 and dismantled in 1863. During the Peninsular War this gate (and others of the area) was fortified to fend off the Napoleonic troops. On 3 December 1808 Napoleon I personally directed the attacks against Madrid from the Fuente Castellana (today Plaza de Emilio CastelarMADRID HIST√ìRICO - Enciclopedia). The Bater√≠a de Veterinaria (commanded by artillery official Vasallo) held off the troops that were trying to breach Recoletos Gate to surround the Alcal√° Gate defenders. The French troops managed to break through El Retiro, outflanking the gates of Recoletos, Alcal√° and Atocha, leading to Madrid's capitulation the following day.Guerra de Independencia espa√±ola 1808-1814 During the Civil War the statues and fountains along the Paseo de Recoletos and El Prado were hidden under protection sacks, which led the area to be nicknamed \\"of the twilight of the gods\\".Madrid en guerra  Pedestrian boulevard  The center part of the boulevard is a pedestrian walk, lined with gardens, trees, statues, fountains and varied street furniture. Monument to migrants and refugees located at one of the water ponds of the boulevard. The first and largest stretch of the boulevard (from Plaza Cibeles to Calle de Prim) has a row of eight ponds lined with white double doric columns. The ponds, which are lighted at night, are situated one slightly above the next one, forming tiny water falls in between. The first and last of these ponds have little jet fountains. The Terraza Recoletos (an outdoor caf√©-restaurant) and an Equatorial Sundial are nearby. Relojes de sol de Madrid The second and shortest stretch (from Calle Prim to Calle Almirante/Recoletos) contains the Caf√© Gij√≥n (number 21), an historic literary caf√© founded in 1888 with an outdoor terraza on the boulevard. On the fourth and last stretch (from Calle B√°rbara de Braganza/Villanueva to Plaza de Col√≥n) is the Caf√© El Espejo (number 31), another quaint caf√© with an impressive glass pavilion influenced by Art Nouveau. It also has a monument dedicated to Spanish author Juan Valera and one of his best known works, Pepita Jim√©nez, a statue of Ram√≥n del Valle- Incl√°n and a drinking fountain. Near the northern corner of the stretch is the entrance to a pedestrian underground passage leading to the eastern median strip of the boulevard. This tunnel appears in Carlos Saura's film Taxi (1996).  Eastern median strip  This strip is divided into four stretches, the same as the pedestrian walk. The northern stretch is not wide enough to allow a walk, but it contains a green area commemorative stone for the 30th Anniversary of the Children's Rights declaration, and a little iron sculpture of two reading kids \\"to the Book and its creators\\" (this sculpture is in front of the National Library). The other three stretches are lined with trees, bushes and ornamental flowerbeds, and a path for pedestrians.

The first building next to the Jardines del Descubrimiento is the Casa del Tesoro (numbers 20/22 of the boulevard), built around 1568 and occupied since 1711 by the Biblioteca Nacional (Recoletos side) and the National Archeological Museum (Serrano street side). In number 10 lies the Marqu√©s de Salamanca Palace, built between 1846 and 1855 by architect Narciso Pascual y Colomer in a Renaissance style. The Marquis sold it in 1876 to the Banco Hipotecario, which installed its headquarters in it and enlarged it in 1905, 1919 and 1945/1948 with two new pavilions and two lateral wings. In 1991 it was acquired by Banco Argentaria and it currently houses the BBVA Foundation. Right next to the Plaza Cibeles (in Recoletos, 2) lies the Marqu√©s de Linares Palace (Palacio de Linares), built in 1873 by architect Carlos Colub√≠. In that terrain had stood since the 17th century the P√≥sito de la Villa, a big cereal warehouse with reserves to be used in times of shortage. During the 20th century it was sold to the Transmediterranean Company and later to the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks. In 1976 it was declared \\"Historical-Artistic Monument\\", saving it from ruin and speculation. In 1989 it was sold by magnate Emiliano Revilla for 3,6 million Euro to the Instituto de Cooperaci√≥n Hispanoamericana, the Town Hall and Madrid Autonomous Community to rehabilitate it (on a budget of more than 12 million Euro) and establish the Casa de Am√©rica on it, where it currently resides.  Buildings along the West side of the Paseo (odd numbers)  In Recoletos (number 3) and right in front of the Palacio de Linares lies a six-storey office building built in 1975 and renovated in 2000 bought in July 2006 by Grupo Ballester.http://es.biz.yahoo.com/06072006/4/economia-empresas-grupo- ballester-compra-antigua-sede-caja-postal-madrid.html Numbers 7 and 9 consist of a building owned by magnate Alicia Koplowitz that currently houses the British Consul General among others. Next to it stands the Convent of San Pascual (or San Pascual Bail√≥n), founded in 1683 by the Admiral of Castile, Juan Gaspar Enr√≠quez de Cabrera for the Franciscan order of San Pedro de Alc√°ntara. In 1836 during the Desamortizaci√≥n of Mendiz√°bal the convent was transformed into a wood warehouse, until 1852, when the Franciscan nuns came back under the protection of Mariano T√©llez Gir√≥n Beaufort, duke of Osuna and Medina de Rioseco. Every Tuesday -19'00 h- is celebrated a service in the old Spanish liturgy (Gothic-Hispanic or Mozarabic Rite). Nine years later it was expropriated by the Town Hall and demolished to enlarge the Paseo. In 1866 the current building was built by architect Juan J. Urquijo, and is inhabited by the nuns. Number 13 is occupied by the Palace of Alca√±ices or Duque de Sesto. It was built in 1865 by architect Francisco de Cubas, a typical palatial residence of the high class of 19th century Isabelian Madrid. Seven years later the same architect built the next building (number 15), known as the Palace of L√≥pez D√≥riga, in the same style. And the block ends with the Houses of the Asociaci√≥n Mutua Ben√©fica, built in 1869 also following the Isabelino style. It currently belongs to the Ministry of the Navy. A modern crystal building stands out in number 19; it's Banco Pastor's headquarters, built by Corrales and Molez√∫n (1973/1975).S√≥lo Arquitectura The Palace of Duchess of Mediana de las Torres stands in number 23, built on the terrain where it once was the Circo de Price (burned down in 1876, four years before). The two towers at both sides of the building were added in 1910. The Palace of Elduayen (one of the last ones of this period) was built next to it (number 25) and currently belongs to the Mapfre Insurance Company.

Background Medical services of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire were mainly imports from the civilization of Ancient Greece, at first through Greek-influenced Etruscan society and Greek colonies placed directly in Italy, and then through Greeks enslaved during the Roman conquest of Greece, Greeks invited to Rome, or Greek knowledge imparted to Roman citizens visiting or being educated in Greece.Antiqua Medicina, Health Sciences Library A perusal of the names of Roman physicians will show that the majority are wholly or partly Greek and that many of the physicians were of servile origin.Names can be located by a search under \\"physician\\" of classical encyclopedias and dictionaries available on the Internet, such as are presented by the Perseus site The servility stigma came from the accident of a more medically advanced society being conquered by a lesser. One of the cultural ironies of these circumstances is that free men sometimes found themselves in service to the enslaved professional or dignitary, or the power of the state was entrusted to foreigners who had been conquered in battle and were technically slaves. In Greek society, physicians tended to be regarded as noble. Asclepius in the Iliad is noble. Importation from Greece =Public medicine= Tiber Island today, site of the first Aesculapium in Rome A signal event in the Roman medical community was the construction of the first Aesculapium in the city of Rome, on Tiber Island.Several ancient sources mention it; for one, Livy, History of Rome, 10.47 In 293 BCE some officials consulted the Sibylline Books concerning measures to be taken against the plague and were advised to bring Aesculapius from Epidaurus to Rome. The sacred serpent from Epidaurus was conferred ritually on the new temple, or, in some accounts, the serpent escaped from the ship and swam to the island. Baths have been found there as well as votive offerings (donaria) in the shape of specific organs. In classical times the center covered the entire island and included a long-term recovery center. The emperor ClaudiusSuetonius, Claudius, 25 had a law passed granting freedom to slaves who had been sent to the institution for cure but were abandoned there. This law probably facilitated state disposition of the patients and recovery of the beds they occupied. The details are not available. It was not the first time a temple had been constructed at Rome to ward off plague. The consul, Gnaeus Julius Mento, one of two for the year 431 BCE, dedicated a temple to Apollo medicus (\\"the healer\\").Livy, Book IV, 25, 29. There was also a temple to salus (\\"health\\") on the Mons Salutaris, a spur of the Quirinal. There is no record that these earlier temples possessed the medical facilities associated with an Aesculapium; in that case, the later decision to bring them in presupposes a new understanding that scientific measures could be taken against plague. The memorable description of plague at Athens during the Peloponnesian War (430 BCE) by Thucydides does not mention any measures at all to relieve those stricken with it. The dying were allowed to accumulate at the wells, which they contaminated, and the deceased to pile up there. At Rome, CiceroDe Natura Deorum 3.63 criticized the worship of evil powers, such as Febris (\\"Fever\\"), Dea Mefitis (\\"Malaria\\"), Dea Angerona (\\"Sore Throat\\") and Dea Scabies (\\"Rash\\"). The medical art in early Rome was the responsibility of the pater familias, or patriarch. The last known public advocate of this point of view were the railings of Marcus Cato against Greek physicians and his insistence on passing on home remedies to his son. The importation of the Aesculapium established medicine in the public domain. There is no record of fees being collected for a stay at one of them, at Rome or elsewhere. The expense of an Aesculapium must have been defrayed in the same way as all temple expenses: individuals vowed to perform certain actions or contribute a certain amount if certain events happened, some of which were healings. Such a system amounts to gradated contributions by income, as the contributor could only vow what he could provide. The building of a temple and its facilities on the other hand was the responsibility of the magistrates. The funds came from the state treasury or from taxes. =Private medicine= A second signal act marked the start of sponsorship of private medicine by the state as well. In the year 219 BCE (Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Marcus Livius Salinator were consuls), a vulnerarius, or surgeon, Archagathus, visited Rome from the Peloponnesus and was asked to stay. The state conferred citizenship on him and purchased him a taberna, or shop, near the compitium Acilii (a crossroads), which became the first officina medica.The use of the uncontracted opificina by Plautus gives a clue that it was the workplace of an opifex, or \\"manufacturer\\" rather than the officium or \\"office\\" of a functionary. This label comes from the manufacture and sale of medicines at the opificina. For the story refer to Pliny, Historia Naturalis, Book 29.6. The doctor necessarily had many assistants. Some prepared and vended medicines and tended the herb garden. There were pharmacopolae (note the female ending), unguentarii and aromatarii, all of which names are easily understood by the English reader. Others attended the doctor when required (the capsarii; they prepared and carried the doctor's capsa, or bag.). Jerome Carcopino's study of occupational names in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum turned up 51 medici, 4 medicae (female doctors), an obstetrix (\\"midwife\\") and a nutrix (\\"nurse\\") in the city of Rome. These numbers, of course, are at best proportional to the true populations, which were many times greater. At the bottom of the scale were the ubiquitous discentes (\\"those learning\\") or medical apprentices. Roman doctors of any stature combed the population for persons in any social setting who had an interest in and ability for practicing medicine. On the one hand the doctor used their services unremittingly. On the other they were treated like members of the family; i.e., they came to stay with the doctor and when they left they were themselves doctors. The best doctors were the former apprentices of the Aesculapia, who, in effect, served residencies there. The practice of medicine =Medical values= The Romans valued a state of valetudo, salus or sanitas. They began their correspondence with the salutation si vales valeo, \\"if you are well, I am\\" and ended it with salve, \\"be healthy\\". The Indo-European roots are *wal-, \\"be strong\\", a wholeness were to some degree perpetuated by right living. The Hippocratic oath obliges doctors to live rightly (setting an example). The first cause thought of when people got sick was that they did not live rightly. Vegetius' brief section on the health of a Roman legion states only that a legion can avoid disease by staying out of malarial swamps, working out regularly and living a healthy life. Despite their best efforts people from time to time did become aeger, \\"sick\\". They languished, had nausea (words of Roman extraction) or \\"fell\\" (incidere) in morbum. They were vexed and dolorous. At that point they were in need of the medica res, the men skilled in the ars medicus, who would curare morbum, \\"have a care for the disease\\", who went by the name of medicus or medens. The root is *med-, \\"measure\\". The medicus prescribed medicina or regimina as measures against the disease.The Oscan official, meddix, appearing in inscriptions, was only a man who rendered judgements of a non-medical nature. The inscriptions also testify to a goddess in Republican Rome, Meditrina, celebrated in the Meditrinalia, who was a goddess of healing. =The physician= The next step was to secure the cura of a medicus. If the patient was too sick to move one sent for a clinicus, who went to the clinum or couch of the patient. Of higher status were the chirurgii (which became the English word surgeon), from Greek cheir (hand) and ourgon (work). In addition were the eye doctor, ocularius, the ear doctor, auricularius, and the doctor of snakebites, the marsus. That the poor paid a minimal fee for the visit of a medicus is indicated by a wisecrack in Plautus:Aulularia 448 \\"It was less than a nummus.\\"A coin, usually one sestertius, made of about 1.125 g. of silver in Plautus' time. The price of silver is a variable. If silver is valued at $11.50 an ounce, one sesterce is about fifty cents. Many anecdotes exist of doctors negotiating fees with wealthy patients and refusing to prescribe a remedy if agreement was not reached. Pliny says:Pliny, Book 29.8 :\\"I will not accuse the medical art of the avarice even of its professors, the rapacious bargains made with their patients while their fate is trembling in the balance, ‚Ä¶\\" The fees charged were on a sliding scale according to assets. The physicians of the rich were themselves rich. For example, Antonius Musa treated Augustus' nervous symptoms with cold baths and drugs. He was not only set free but he became Augustus' physician. He received a salary of 300,000 sesterces.By the standard of the previous note, that would be a relatively inexpensive $150,000 per annum, but the number does not take into consideration any economic standards. There is no evidence that he was other than a private physician; that is, he was not working for the Roman government. =Legal responsibility= Doctors were generally exempt from prosecution for their mistakes. Some writers complain of legal murder. However, holding the powerful up to exorbitant fees ran the risk of retaliation. Pliny reports that the emperor Claudius fined a physician, Alcon, 180 million sesterces and exiled him to Gaul, but that on his return he made the money back in just a few years. Pliny does not say why the physician was exiled, but the blow against the man was struck on his pocketbook. He could make no such income in Gaul. This immunity applied only to mistakes made in the treatment of free men. By chance a law existed at Rome, the Lex Aquilia,Sponsored by the tribune, Aquilius passed about 286 BCE, which allowed the owners of slaves and animals to seek remedies for damage to their property, either malicious or negligent. Litigants used this law to proceed against the negligence of medici, such as the performance of an operation on a slave by an untrained surgeon resulting in death or other damage. =Social position= While encouraging and supporting the public and private practice of medicine, the Roman government tended to suppress organizations of medici in society. The constitution provided for the formation of occupational collegia, or guilds. The consuls and the emperors treated these ambivalently. Sometimes they were permitted; more often they were made illegal and were suppressed. The medici formed collegia, which had their own centers, the Scholae Medicorum, but they never amounted to a significant social force. They were regarded as subversive along with all the other collegia. Doctors were nevertheless influential. They liked to write. Compared to the number of books written, not many have survived; for example, Tiberius Claudius Menecrates composed 150 medical works, of which only a few fragments remain. Some that did remain almost in entirety are the works of Galen, Celsus, Hippocrates and the herbal expert, Pedanius Dioscorides who wrote the 5-volume De Materia Medica. The Natural History of Pliny the Elder became a paradigm for all subsequent works like it and gave its name to the topic, although Pliny was not himself an observer of the natural world like Aristotle or Theophrastus, whose Enquiry into Plants included a book on their medicinal uses. Military medical corps =Republican= The state of the military medical corps before Augustus is unclear. Corpsmen certainly existed at least for the administration of first aid and were enlisted soldiers rather than civilians. The commander of the legion was held responsible for removing the wounded from the field and insuring that they got sufficient care and time to recover. He could quarter troops in private domiciles if he thought necessary. Authors who have written of Roman military activities before Augustus, such as Livy, mention that wounded troops retired to population centers to recover. =Imperial= The army of the early empire was sharply and qualitatively different. Augustus defined a permanent professional army by setting the enlistment at 16 years (with an additional 4 for reserve obligations), and establishing a special military fund, the aerarium militare, imposing a 5% inheritance tax and 1% auction sales tax to pay for it. From it came bonus payments to retiring soldiers amounting to several years' salary. It could also have been used to guarantee regular pay. Previously legions had to rely on booty. If military careers were now possible, so were careers for military specialists, such as medici. Under Augustus for the first time occupational names of officers and functions began to appear in inscriptions. The valetudinaria, or military versions of the aesculapia (the names mean the same thing) became features of permanent camps. Caches of surgical instruments have been found in some of them. From this indirect evidence it is possible to conclude to the formation of an otherwise unknown permanent medical corps. In the early empire one finds milites medici who were immunes (\\"exempt\\") from other duties. Some were staff of the hospital, which Pseudo-Hyginus mentions in De Munitionibus Castrorum Section 4 as being set apart from other buildings so that the patients can rest. The hospital administrator was an optio valetudinarii. The orderlies aren't generally mentioned, but they must have existed, as the patients needed care and the doctors had more important duties. Perhaps they were servile or civilians, not worth mentioning. There were some noscomi, male nurses not in the army. Or, they could have been the milites medici. The latter term might be any military medic or it might be orderlies detailed from the legion. There were also medici castrorum. Not enough information survives in the sources to say for certain what distinctions existed, if any. The army of Augustus featured a standardized officer corps, described by Vegetius. Among them were the Ordinarii, the officers of an Ordo or rank. In an acies triplex there were three such ordines, the centuries (companies) of which were commanded by centurions. The Ordinarii were therefore of the rank of a centurion but did not necessarily command one if they were staff. The term medici ordinarii in the inscriptions must refer to the lowest ranking military physicians. During his reign, Augustus finally conferred the dignitas equestris, or social rank of knight, on all physicians, public or private. They were then full citizens (in case there were any Hellenic questions) and could wear the rings of knights. In the army there was at least one other rank of physician, the medicus duplicarius, \\"medic at double pay\\", and, as the legion had milites sesquiplicarii, \\"soldiers at 1.5 pay\\", perhaps the medics had that pay grade as well. Augustan posts were named according to a formula containing the name of the rank and the unit commanded in the genitive case; e.g., the commander of a legion, who was a legate; that is, an officer appointed by the emperor, was the legatus legionis, \\"the legate of the legion.\\" Those posts worked pretty much as today; a man on his way up the cursus honorum (\\"ladder of offices\\", roughly) would command a legion for a certain term and then move on. The posts of medicus legionis and a medicus cohortis were most likely to be commanders of the medici of the legion and its cohorts. They were all under the praetor or camp commander, who might be the legatus but more often was under the legatus himself. There was, then, a medical corps associated with each camp. The cavalry alae (\\"wings\\") and the larger ships all had their medical officers, the medici alarum and the medici triremis respectively. =Practice= As far as can be determined, the medical corps in battle worked as follows. Trajan's Column depicts medics on the battlefield bandaging soldiers. They were located just behind the standards; i.e., near the field headquarters. This must have been a field aid station, not necessarily the first, as the soldiers or corpsmen among the soldiers would have administered first aid before carrying their wounded comrades to the station. Some soldiers were designated to ride along the line on a horse picking up the wounded. They were paid by the number of men they rescued. Bandaging was performed by capsarii, who carried bandages (fascia) in their capsae, or bags. From the aid station the wounded went by horse-drawn ambulance to other locations, ultimately to the camp hospitals in the area. There they were seen by the medici vulnerarii, or surgeons, the main type of military doctor. They were given a bed in the hospital if they needed it and one was available. The larger hospitals could administer 400-500 beds. If these were insufficient the camp commander probably utilized civilian facilities in the region or quartered them in the vici, \\"villages\\", as in the republic. A base hospital was quadrangular with barracks-like wards surrounding a central courtyard. On the outside of the quadrangle were private rooms for the patients. Although unacquainted with bacteria, Roman medical doctors knew about contagion and did their best to prevent it. Rooms were isolated, running water carried the waste away, and the drinking and washing water was tapped up the slope from the latrines. Within the hospital were operating rooms, kitchens, baths, a dispensary, latrines, a mortuary and herb gardens, as doctors relied heavily on herbs for drugs. The medici could treat any wound received in battle, as long as the patient was alive. They operated or otherwise treated with scalpels, hooks, levers, drills, probes, forceps, catheters and arrow-extractors on patients anesthetized with morphine (opium poppy extract) and scopolamine (henbane extract). Instruments were boiled before use. Wounds were washed in vinegar and stitched. Broken bones were placed in traction. There is, however, evidence of wider concerns. A vaginal speculum suggests gynecology was practiced, and an anal speculum implies knowledge that the size and condition of internal organs accessible through the orifices was an indication of health. They could extract eye cataracts with a special needle. Operating room amphitheaters indicate that medical education was ongoing. Many have proposed that the knowledge and practices of the medici were not exceeded until the 20th century CE. Regulation of medicine By the late empire the state had taken more of a hand in regulating medicine. The law codes of the 4th century CE, such as the Codex Theodosianus, paint a picture of a medical system enforced by the laws and the state apparatus. At the top was the equivalent of a surgeon general of the empire. He was by law a noble, a dux (duke) or a vicarius (vicar) of the emperor. He held the title of comes archiatorum, \\"count of the chief healers.\\" The Greek word iatros, \\"healer\\", was higher-status than the Latin medicus. Under the comes were a number of officials called the archiatri, or more popularly the protomedici, supra medicos, domini medicorum or superpositi medicorum. They were paid by the state. It was their function to supervise all the medici in their districts; i.e., they were the chief medical examiners. Their families were exempt from taxes. They could not be prosecuted nor could troops be quartered in their homes. The archiatri were divided into two groups: * Archiatri sancti palatii, who were palace physicians * Archiatri populares. They were required to provide for the poor; presumably, the more prosperous still provided for themselves. The archiatri settled all medical disputes. Rome had 14 of them; the number in other communities varied from 5 to 10 depending on the population.

The film is based on the novel, The Prostitute and the Postman by Bhupen Hazarika. Film was Fourth Negative role of Mithun Chakraborty after Jallaad (1995), Elaan (2005 film) and Classic Dance of Love (2005). The film is a commentary on the abuse of power and in particular discusses the injustices of the priests in India. Beneath the love triangle between the main characters, there is an age-old story that shows that not even \\"holy men\\" are exempt from the corruption of power. Later it was dubbed in Tamil as Peyar Sandhya Thozil Dhasi Chingari was critically successful but declared a flop at box office however critic highly praised the performance of Sushmita Sen and Mithun Chakraborty.  Plot  Basanti (Sushmita Sen) is a prostitute with a child, Titali, working with Ila Arun. Chandan (Anuj Sawhney) is a newly recruited postman. Upon his arrival in the village, he is moved by Basanti's sufferings. The third part of the love triangle is Bhuvan Panda (Mithun Chakraborty), the village priest of the goddess, Kali. He thinks of himself as a god and bends religion as per his will. In the movie, the priest follows some of the aghori rituals and is one of Basanti's regular customers. Bhuvan Panda has a fetish for sadism. Meanwhile, Chandan befriends Titali and Basanti and it is here that Basanti discloses that she wants a better life for her daughter, Titali. Chandan falls in love with Basanti and promises to give her and Titali a better life. The priest does not approve of the marriage, for obvious reasons. Bhuvan Panda plans to kill Basanti. Chandan tries to stop him and is killed. As this is happening, Basanti awaits her lover at the altar. When he does not arrive, Basanti leaves broken-hearted. In her despair, Basanti returns to her life of prostitution. When the news of what happened to Chandan reaches Basanti, she and all the villagers attack the temple.

He has testified as an expert for the United Nations Security Council, the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs with NATO, the National Counterterrorism Center, and Special Operations Command Central and he is an external expert with the Joint Staff SMA for CENTCOM Command Staff. He has also appeared on media outlets such as CNN , CBC , ABC , and NBC MSNBC, on matters related to extremism and terrorism. Mubin Shaikh is a member of the Memphis-based organization Parents For Peace. Career Shaikh's operational experience originates with his role as an undercover counter-terrorism operative for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) in the 2006 Toronto terrorism case . He was active with CSIS for some years domestically, but the details of his activities are subject to national security restrictions and so cannot be disclosed to the public.. Shaikh moved on to become a Royal Canadian Mounted Police agent with the Integrated National Security Enforcement Teams when one of the Service investigations uncovered a group of young Muslim men, of various ethnic backgrounds, intending to engage in criminal offences regarding terrorism. It is clear from court evidence that the plot was well underway before CSIS had assigned Shaikh to the investigation. The investigation was formally moved from CSIS to the RCMP after Shaikh had verified the information that had been disclosed to him by the subjects of the investigation. After several public hearings (youth preliminary hearings in January 2007, adult preliminary hearings in September 2007, and a youth trial by judge in 2008) and despite allegations of entrapment, Judge John Sproat, in March 2009, dismissed claims of entrapment and wrote in his ruling that Shaikh was cleared of any wrongdoing and \\"displayed a great number of the hallmarks of a truthful and credible witness\\" and that the group's plans were already underway prior to Shaikh's involvement and so could not have been the result of the state abusing its authority. In total, seven people had charges \\"stayed\\" because of the sympathetic testimony of Shaikh. A prosecutor in the case even accused Shaikh of lying to protect the youth accused. The judge, in his ruling, once again sided with Shaikh.. At the end of the adult trial by jury of the remaining three persons in June 2010, after several others had pleaded guilty, a comprehensive presentation of previously-restricted information including court exhibits entered as evidence, complete with transcripts and video, was put forward by Isabel Teotonio of the Toronto Star. Zakaria Amara wrote a letter of apology and Faheem Ahmad gave an interview on his radicalization. He also had discussions with Abu Huzaifa al-Kanadi. Shaikh is a co-author of the book Undercover Jihadi. Education Shaikh has a Master of Policing, Intelligence, and Counter-Terrorism from Macquarie University, Australia. *Degree conferment: 2011. Search using Mubin Shaikh: Personal life Shaikh was born at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. He attended Quran school as a child as well as public school. At age 14, he joined the Royal Canadian Army Cadets attaining the rank of Cadet Warrant Officer. After an identity crisis because of a house party he went to Pakistan, where a chance encounter with the Taliban propelled him into extremism. The 9/11 attacks made him reconsider his views and he then spent 2 years in Syria augmenting previous private study of Islamic Studies where he went through a period of deradicalization, rejecting extremism and terrorism as anathema to Islam. He then returned to Canada and began his national security operations work. Shaikh is a Sunni Sufi Muslim.

It is situated on the border with the Czech Republic, adjoining the Czech village B√≠l√° Voda. The town is the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Z≈Çoty Stok, and lies approximately south of ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie and south of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. History One of the streets of the historic city center, filled with old townhouses The name Z≈Çoty Stok means \\"golden hillside\\" in Polish and is a reference to the fact that a gold deposit was mined here in the Middle Ages. Its Czech name is applied to the neighbouring mountain range, the Rychleby Mountains (). The corresponding Polish name is G√≥ry Z≈Çote (Golden Mountains). This range is part of the eastern Sudetes. The area became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century under first historic ruler Mieszko I of Poland of the Piast dynasty, and after the fragmentation of Poland it was located in the duchies of Silesia, ≈öwidnica-Jawor, Ziƒôbice and ≈öwidnica-Jawor again, still ruled by the Piasts, until 1392. During this period, the settlement was first mentioned and town rights were granted. Afterwards it came under the suzerainty of the Bohemian (Czech) Kingdom. In 1428 it was destroyed by the Hussites. From 1469 to 1490 it was under Hungarian suzerainty and afterwards it was under Bohemian suzerainty again. The first evidence of mining in Z≈Çoty Stok dates from the first millennium AD. In 1491, Duke Henry I of the Czech Podiebrad family granted the town the coat of arms, banner and the title of a \\"Free Mining City\\". Many German and Czech miners settled there. At the beginning of the 16th century the town, called Reichenstein (literally \\"Richstone\\") by the Germans and Rychleby by the Czechs, began to flourish thanks to the mining and working of gold. The search for this precious ore continued until the closing of the mine in the late 1960s, even though it had not fully rendered all its wealth. In 1742 the town was annexed by Prussia and from 1871 to 1945 was located in Germany. Z≈Çoty Stok, then Reichenstein, was, for many prisoners of war, a stopping place on 'The Long March' during the final months of the Second World War in Europe. About 30,000 Allied PoWs were force-marched westward across Poland, Czechoslovakia and Germany in appalling winter conditions, lasting about four months from January to April 1945.The Long March - Lamsdorf: Stalag VIIIB 344 Prisoner of War Camp 1940 - 1945 After World War II it became part of the Polish Recovered Territories.

It is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Pieter Bruegel the Elder enjoyed painting peasants and different aspects of their lives in so many of his paintings that he has been called Peasant- Bruegel, but he was an intellectual, and many of his paintings have a symbolic meaning as well as a moral aspect. Scene The bride is in front of the green textile wall-hanging, with a paper-crown hung above her head. She is also wearing a crown on her head, and she is sitting passively, not participating in the eating or drinking taking place around her. The Bridegroom is not in attendance of the wedding feast in accordance to Flemish custom. The feast is in a barn in the summertime; two sheaves of grain with a rake recalls the work that harvesting involves, and the hard life peasants have. The plates are carried on a door off its hinges. The main food was bread, porridge and soup. Other features of the scene include two pipers playing the pijpzak, an unbreeched boy in the foreground licking a plate, the wealthy man at the far right feeding a dog by putting bread on the bench, and a mysterious extra foot seen under the load of dishes being carried by the two men in the right foreground. The scene is claimed to depict an accurate portrayal of the 16th-century way of celebrating a peasant wedding. The groom There has been much conjecture as to the identity of the groom in this painting. Gilbert Highet has argued that the groom is the man in the centre of the painting, wearing a dark coat and seen in profile,Gilbert Highet. 1945. Bruegel's Rustic wedding. American Magazine of Art 38. 274-276.Gilbert Highet. 1967. Where is the Bridegroom? Horizon: A Magazine of the Arts. 9.2:112-115. or the ill-bred son of a wealthy couple, seen against the far wall, to the right of the bride, eating with a spoon, same as Gustav Gl√ºck.Gustav Gl√ºck, ed. 1937. Bilder aus Bruegels Bildern. Vienna: Verlag Von Anton Schroll & Co. It has also been suggested that according to contemporary custom, the groom is not seated at the table but may be the man pouring out beer. Or he may be according to the same custom serving the food instead. According to this theory, the groom is the young man wearing a red cap, who is serving his guests the food, handing out plates to his guests. In a Freudian vein, Rudy Rucker speculates: Some authors have even suggested that the groom is not even included in the painting. Van der Elst speculated that this could be the depiction of an old Flemish proverb, like some of \\"There is an old Flemish proverb: 'It is a poor man who is not able to be at his own wedding.' That seems to be the case here.\\"Joseph van der Elst. 1944. The last flowering of the Middle Ages. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Doran & Company. Some argued that it is a presentation of the mystical Wedding of Cana. Lindsay and Bernard Hupp√© speculated that the painting was a Christian allegory, symbolizing corruption, depicting the corrupted Church, which was supposed to be the bride of Christ, but the groom has not appeared to claim his corrupt bride.K.

Natural landscaping, also called native gardening, is the use of native plants, including trees, shrubs, groundcover, and grasses which are indigenous to the geographic area of the garden. Natural landscaping with pine leaf litter mulch Benefits =Maintenance= Natural landscaping is adapted to the climate, geography and hydrology and should require no pesticides, fertilizers and watering to maintain, given that native plants have adapted and evolved to local conditions over thousands of years.Tallamy, p. 12 However, these applications may be necessary for some preventive care of trees and other vegetation in areas of degraded or weedy landscapes. Native plants suit today's interest in \\"low-maintenance\\" gardening and landscaping, with many species vigorous and hardy and able to survive winter cold and summer heat. Once established, they can flourish without irrigation or fertilization, and are resistant to most pests and diseases. Many municipalities have quickly recognized the benefits of natural landscaping due to municipal budget constraints and reductions and the general public is now benefiting from the implementation of natural landscaping techniques to save water and create more personal time. =Ecology and habitat= Banksia spinulosa, a Sydney local plant which attracts wildlife Native plants provide suitable habitat for native species of butterflies, birds, pollinators, and other wildlife. They provide more variety in gardens by offering myriad alternatives to the often planted introduced species, cultivars, and invasive species. The indigenous plants have co-evolved with animals, fungi and microbes, to form a complex network of relationships. They are the foundation of their native habitats and ecosystems, or natural communities. Such gardens often benefit from the plants being evolved and habituated to the local climate, pests and herbivores, and soil conditions, and so may require fewer to no soil amendments, irrigation, pesticides, and herbicides for a beautiful, lower maintenance, and more sustainable landscape. Habitat challenges However, while local provenance plants have adapted to local conditions (which includes climate, soil, and other native plants and animals), there will often be instances, especially in cities, where one or more of these will have been radically altered. Examples include: *Building rubble used as landfill may raise soil pH (i.e. create alkaline soil), which can be problematic in regions of acidic soils (with local plants adapted to acid soils). *Buildings cast a substantial shade, this may give rise to conditions substantially shadier than needed by local plants. *Soil which is high in organic material and nutrients is often introduced into gardens, or many gardeners will have used fertilizers. Plants from some areas may not thrive under these conditions. For example, many Australian plants are particularly sensitive to phosphorus. *Many native plants are adapted to, and benefit from, periodic wildfires that occurred before and during pre-modern settlement. These fires can be simulated in the garden by either \\"high mowing\\" or a controlled burn every few years. Many weeds in an area are usually the result of imported plants. These plants become invasive because there are no natural controls such as disease, weather, or fauna in their new environment. They take over native habitats, reducing shelter and food for local fauna. Using local provenance plants increases the biodiversity of and is important for the health of a region's overall ecology. Much of the wild areas have been destroyed to make room for urban development. Housing developments have replaced native habitats with ornamental plants and lawns, pushing the wildland‚Äìurban interface further out. While development won't be stopped, gardeners can keep wild areas and green spaces filled with native species on their lots and in their communities. Despite this, there are usually plenty of indigenous or native plants which will grow and thrive in the area one is trying to establish a native garden. Native plants The use of native plants in a garden or landscape can both preserve and protect natural ecosystems, and reduce the amount of care and energy required to maintain a healthy garden or landscape. Native plants are adapted to the local climate and geology, and often require less maintenance than exotic species. Native plants also support populations of native birds, insects, and other animals that they coevolved with, thus promoting a healthy community of organisms. Plants in a garden or maintained landscape often form a source population from which plants can colonize new areas. Avoiding the use of invasive species helps to prevent such plants from establishing new populations. Similarly, the use of native species can provide a valuable source to help these plants colonise new areas. Some non-native species can form an ecological trap in which native species are lured into an environment that appears attractive but is poorly suited to them. However, in Britain research by the University of Sheffield as part of the BUGS project (Biodiversity in Urban Gardens in Sheffield) has revealed that for many invertebratesthe majority of wild animals in most gardensit is not just native plants which can sustain them. The findings were published in popular form in Ken Thompson's book 'No Nettles Required: The truth about wildlife gardening' He confirms the approach which Chris Baines had promoted in 'How to Make a Wildlife Garden'.http://www.franceslincoln.co.uk/en/C/0/Book/213/How_to_Make_a_Wildlife_Garden.html Some ecosystems may benefit from any increase in biomass, from the introduction of certain non-native species, or any increase in biodiversity. In the case of disturbed areas some exotic/non-native plants may fare better than the displaced, native inhabitants, in the process increasing the biodiversity and biological biomass.

Native gardens include the following kinds: * Fully forested with leaf debris on the forest floor, including coarse woody debris if possible; * Desert with arid loving plants and succulents; * Grassy meadow with a variety of wildflowers and water features; * Lowland savanna with grasses and native trees; and * Oceanic dunescape with tall, salt tolerant grasses. =Wildflower gardens= \\"Wildflower\\" in some nations denominates the numerous showy flowers from some drier climates, most notably southwest Western Australia, southern Africa, and North America. Some wildflower gardens attempt to recreate a prairie, including native grasses along with flowering plants, i. e. forbs. Such gardens benefit the local wildlife, often attracting birds, butterflies, and small mammals. By carefully choosing the plants for the garden, some of these animals can be encouraged to visit the garden. One popular type of wildflower garden specializes in attracting butterflies and is thus denominated a \\"butterfly garden\\". The native plants cultivated in wildflower gardens often have deep roots, and therefore are effective selections for absorbing surface runoff and allowing the water to infiltrate into the local water table. Wildflower gardens cultivated for capturing runoff in this mode are denominated \\"rain gardens\\". =Rain gardens= Rain gardens absorb rainwater from gutters & impervious surfaces and function much better when planted with native plants which tolerate the alternation of flooding and drying.  Advantages  no fertilization required * no additional water * more water available for other uses and other people * zero to near zero work needed for maintenance * no lawn mowing * erosion reduced to a minimum * natural landscaped plants take full advantage of rainfall * when water restrictions are implemented, natural landscaped plants will survive, while more traditional plants may not * increased habitat for native flora and fauna * increased beneficial insect population reduces pests * where heavily forested, provides shade on homes and businesses saving energy * native plants rarely become invasive  Disadvantages  not good for outdoor games that require a manicured turf. * in certain areas, wildfires or brushfires may be of great concern. * may look less attractive due to reduced available range of plants to choose from. * may be hard to find native plants which produce adequate quantities of edible matter.  Effect of new construction  In new construction, builders can either avoid clear cutting or clearing an entire property and disturbing other large flora or builders can completely clear an area of all flora to save construction time and replace the clearing with juvenile specimens once the job is complete. The downside to this is additional costs involved with purchasing replacements. The builder may also choose to plant additional native trees and other flora after construction to help the property blend with natural surroundings. In some planned developments, natural landscaping is the requirement. Builders may not remove trees larger than a specific diameter and owners may not arbitrarily cut trees without a permit.  Land reclamation  Throughout the world, forested areas were turned into cattle grazing or farmland. Often this land is then turned into residential or commercial use property. By returning the land back to its original state prior to human disturbance, vast amounts of energy usage and increasing pollution can be reduced. Natural landscaping costs less to install than traditional landscaping and, after the initial few years, reduces maintenance costs, combats erosion, and accommodates storm and flood waters better. Native plant societies In many parts of the world there are societies, clubs or local groups, such as Bushcare or ASGAP in Australia, the North American Native Plant Society, or the California Native Plant Society, which are made up of gardeners interested in growing plants local to their area, state or country. In the United States, Wild OnesNative Plants, Natural Landscapes is a national organization with local chapters in many states. New England Wildflower Society, and Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center. provide information on native plants and promote natural landscaping. These organizations can be the best resources for learning about and obtaining local native plants. Many members have spent years or decades cultivating local plants or bushwalking in local areas.

I, p. 854 (\\"Cornelia\\", Nos. 2, 3). A daughter of Lucius Cornelius Cinna, Cornelia was related by birth or marriage to many of the most influential figures of the late Republic.Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd Edition, s. v. \\"Julia\\", No. 2. Biography =Early life= Cornelia was the daughter of Lucius Cornelius Cinna, one of the most influential politicians at Rome during the conflict between the generals Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius Sulla. He held the consulship for a term of four consecutive years, from BC 87 to 84, when he was slain in a soldiers' mutiny. During this period, he espoused the side of Marius, leaving his family exposed to Sulla's wrath on the latter's return in 82.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 754, 755 (\\"Cornelius Cinna\\", Nos. 2, 3). By his wife, Annia, Cinna had a son, Lucius, and two daughters, conventionally known as Cornelia Major, who married Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, and Cornelia Minor, the wife of Caesar. The designations Major and Minor were not really part of their names, but were used to distinguish between sisters, who bore the same nomen. Since there were a great many Corneliae at Rome, Caesar's wife is occasionally referred to as Cornelia Cinnae, or \\"Cinna's Cornelia\\". =Marriage= Suetonius reports that Caesar and Cornelia were married in the consulate occurring after Caesar lost his father, which occurred in his sixteenth year. In Suetonius' chronology, Caesar was born in 100 BC, placing the death of his father in 85 or 84. Thus, he probably married Cornelia in 83, when he was about seventeen years old, and she perhaps a little younger.Deutsch, \\"The Women of Caesar's Family\\", p. 505.Goldsworthy, Caesar, p. 58. Their daughter, Julia, was Caesar's only legitimate child, and the only one he acknowledged. The young Caesar was one of those to whom Sulla turned his attention after returning to Rome. Although he had taken no part in the government of Marius and Cinna, and done nothing to oppose Sulla's return, Caesar's aunt, Julia, was the wife of Marius; his cousin was the younger Marius, who as consul in 82 was defeated by Sulla, and had taken his own life as the city fell. Marius and Cinna had appointed the young Caesar to an important priesthood, and by marrying Cinna's daughter, Caesar gained control of a substantial dowry. Sulla regarded Caesar as a potential rival, and commanded him to divorce Cornelia. However, neither the deprivation of his priesthood, Cornelia's dowry, and his own inheritance, nor the threat of violence, would induce Caesar to forsake his wife. He was proscribed, and escaped Rome in disguise, evading capture by regularly changing his place of concealment, and on at least one occasion by bribing the commander of a patrol sent to search for Sulla's enemies. Eventually Sulla relented, following the intercession of Caesar's numerous friends and kinsmen, and Caesar returned home to Cornelia. =Death= After about thirteen years of marriage, Cornelia died early in her husband's quaestorship, which occurred in BC 69 or 68.Broughton, vol. II, pp. 132, 136 (note 7). Caesar was due to depart for Spain, and had already pronounced the funeral oration of his aunt, Julia, from the rostra, as was customary for elderly Roman matrons. He then gave an oration in honour of Cornelia, which was extraordinary in the case of a young woman, although it later became commonplace.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 640, 641 (\\"Julia\\", Nos. 1, 5).Gelzer, Caesar: Politician and Statesman.

DAF regulates the complement system on the cell surface. It recognizes C4b and C3b fragments that are created during activation of C4 (classical or lectin pathway) or C3 (alternative pathway). Interaction of DAF with cell-associated C4b of the classical and lectin pathways interferes with the conversion of C2 to C2b, thereby preventing formation of the C4b2a C3-convertase, and interaction of DAF with C3b of the alternative pathway interferes with the conversion of factor B to Bb by factor D, thereby preventing formation of the C3bBb C3 convertase of the alternative pathway. Thus, by limiting the amplification convertases of the complement cascade, DAF indirectly blocks the formation of the membrane attack complex. This glycoprotein is broadly distributed among hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. It is a determinant for the Cromer blood group system. Structure DAF is a 70 kDa membrane protein that attaches to the cell membrane via a glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. DAF contains four complement control protein (CCP) repeats with a single N-linked glycan positioned between CCP1 and CCP2. CCP2, CCP3, CCP4 and three consecutive lysine residues in a positively charged pocket between CCP2 and CCP3 are involved in its inhibition of the alternate complement pathway. CCP2 and CCP3 alone are involved in its inhibition of the classical pathway. Pathology =Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria= Because DAF is a GPI- anchored protein, its expression is reduced in persons with mutations that reduce GPI levels such as those with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In PNH disorder, red blood cells with very low levels of DAF and CD59 undergo complement-mediated hemolysis. Symptoms include low red blood cell count (anemia), fatigue, and episodes of dark colored urine and other complications. =Infectious diseases= DAF is used as a receptor by some coxsackieviruses and other enteroviruses. Recombinant soluble DAF-Fc has been tested in mice as an anti-enterovirus therapy for heart damage; however, the human enterovirus that was tested binds much more strongly to human DAF than to mouse or rat DAF. Echoviruses and coxsackie B viruses that use human decay- accelerating factor (DAF) as a receptor do not bind the rodent analogues of DAF. and DAF-Fc has yet to be tested in humans. Binding of DAF to human HIV-1 when the virons are budding from the surface of infected cells may protect HIV-1 from complement mediated lysis.

Also known as 'Our Lady's Well', Glasgow's Ladywell is an artesian spring noted on early city maps and can be reliably assumed to predate the city. It lay just outside the city wall and Drygate Port in medieval times and will have refreshed Romans travelling the old Carntyne Highway east-west between forts along the Antonine Wall. Today it is erroneously believed to have been sunk for use of commoners denied access to a nearby Priest's Well, and/or to have been capped in the early 19th century out of fears of pollution or plague. In fact, its wellhead was jointly rebuilt by the Merchants House and City Council in 1835-6 for enclosure in a new wall when the Fir Park behind it was turned into a gardened burial ground. The Ladywell was still in public use while most wells in Glasgow were closed, after fresh water piped from Loch Katrine transformed the city's health and sanitation in the 1860s. An old article says the Ladywell was the last public well to be closed but gives no date. The classical wellhead installed by the 1836 restoration bears no resemblance to the original - an open round one - and remains there today. The current lintel stone (its second) notes the 1836 rebuild and another by the Merchant's House in 1874. A plaque commemorates its most recent refurbishment by Tennent Caledonian Breweries in 1983.

He was a church planter and pastor in Texas for ten years. He then served as an assistant to D. James Kennedy at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church and taught at Knox Theological Seminary. Following his move to Tennessee in 1991, Grant founded the King's Meadow Study Center and Franklin Classical School in Franklin.King‚Äôs Meadow Study Center web site In 2006, he helped found New College Franklin, a Christian liberal arts college. Grant has also founded several Christian schools in northern Iraq. He is \\"a prolific author of Christian books.\\" He is currently involved in church planting in Middle Tennessee and serves as the pastor of Parish Presbyterian Church in Franklin, Tennessee. Grant is an anti- abortion advocate. Grant is a prominent figure in the Christian reconstructionist movement in the United States, and has been noted for his extreme conservative views, particularly on the topic of homosexuality. Education Grant has degrees in Political Science from the University of Houston (B.A.), Philosophy from Whitefield Theological Seminary (M.A., D. Litt, PhD.), Humanities from Belhaven College (D. Hum.), and Theology from Knox Theological Seminary (D. Min. Cand.). Career Grant is a former vice president of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, a Florida megachurch, and has been a lecturer at Knox Theological Seminary. Grant became Executive Director of the Coral Ridge ministry on February 1, 1990; the ministry had a $17 million annual budget in 1990. Grant planted Parish Presbyterian Church in Franklin, Tennessee in 2006. He continues to be Pastor. Grant is the founder of Franklin Classical School, a K - 12, college preparatory, classical school in Franklin, Tennessee. Political activity In 1991 Grant was one of the founders of the U.S. Taxpayers' Party, which sought to outlaw abortion, end government funding for the Department of Education and the National Endowment for the Arts, and replace government funded welfare benefits with private charity. Beliefs Grant is a notable Christian reconstructionist; Reason magazine in 1998 quoted him as saying \\"World conquest. It is dominion we are after....\\" Grant appeared in the 2017 creationist documentary film Is Genesis History?, in which he advocates for young Earth creationism. In his 1993 book Legislating Immorality: the Homosexual Movement Comes out of the Closet, Grant wrote positively about past executions of gay people. He criticized the abandoning of the death penalty for homosexuality, writing that \\"[s]adly, the 20th century saw this remarkable 2,000-year-old commitment suddenly dissipate.\\" In 2016, Grant was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against a Tennessee county clerk and the state attorney general arguing that legalization of same- sex marriage infringed on their rights as voters. The suit was dismissed by the county and again by the appellate court, who found the plaintiffs suffered no harm and lacked legal standing. In his 1987 book The Changing of the Guard: Biblical Principles for Political Action, Grant wrote \\"Christians have an obligation, a mandate, a holy responsibility to reclaim the land for Jesus Christ, to have dominion in civil structures just as in every other aspect of life and godliness. But it is dominion we are after, not just a voice. It is dominion we are after, not just influence. It is dominion we are after, not just equal time. It is dominion we are after. World conquest, that's what Christ has commissioned us to accomplish. We must win the world with the power of the Gospel, and we must never settle for anything less. Thus Christian politics has as its primary intent the conquest of the land, of men, families, institutions, bureaucracies, courts, and governments for the kingdom of Christ.\\" Published books =Author or co-Author=The American Vision, 1984 *Bringing in the Sheaves: Replacing Government Welfare with Biblical Charity, 1985, '89, '95 *In the Shadow of Plenty: Biblical Principles for Welfare, 1986, '98, 2009 *The Dispossessed: Homelessness in America, 1986 *To the Work: A Handbook for Church Diaconal Ministry, 1986 *The Changing of the Guard: The Vital Role Christians Play in America‚Äôs Unfolding Cultural Drama, 1987, '95 *The Catechism of the New Age: A Response to Dungeons and Dragons, with Peter Leithart, 1987 *Rebuilding the Walls: A Biblical Strategy for Restoring America's Greatness, with Peter Waldron, 1987 *Grand Illusions: The Legacy of Planned Parenthood, 1988, 1993, 1998, 2000 *Trial and Error: The American Civil Liberties Union and Its Impact on Your Family, 1989, '93 *The Legacy of Planned Parenthood, 1989 *Third Time Around: The History of the Pro- Life Movement from the First Century to the Present, 1990, 2010 *Clean Air: A Citizen's Handbook for Media Accountability, with Peter Leithart, 1990 *In Defense of Greatness: How Biblical Character Shapes A Nation's Destiny, with Peter Leithart, 1990 *The Walls Came Tumbling Down: The Fall of Communism in Our Time, with Peter Leithart, 1990 *The Blood of the Moon: Understanding the Conflict between Islam and Western Civilization, 1991, 2001 *The Quick and the Dead: RU-486 and the New Chemical Warfare Against Your Family, 1991 *Homelessness In America: Its Causes and Its Cures, 1991 *Unnatural Affections: The Impuritan Ethic of the Modern Church, 1991 *The Last Crusader: The Untold Story of Christopher Columbus, 1992 *: The Wacky Wit, Wisdom, and Wonderment of Hillary Rodham-Clinton, 1992 *Perot: The Populist Appeal of Strong-Man Politics, 1992 *The 57% Solution: A Conservative Strategy for the Next Four Years, 1993 *Where Do We Go From Here: An Agenda for Conservatives During Cultural Captivity, 1993 *Legislating Immorality: The Homosexual Movement Comes Out of the Closet, with Mark Horne, 1993 *The Family Under Siege: What the New Social Engineers Have in Mind for Your Children, 1994 *The Micah Mandate: Balancing the Christian Life, 1995, '99, 2010 *Killer Angel: A Biography of Margaret Sanger, 1995, 2000, 2010, 2014 *The Dittohead‚Äôs Little Instruction Book, 1996 *You Might Be a Liberal If, 1996 *Our Character, Our Future: Reclaiming America‚Äôs Moral Destiny, with Alan Keyes, 1996 *Immaculate Deception: The Shifting Agenda of Planned Parenthood, 1996 *Buchanan: Caught in the Crossfire, 1996 *Moral Earthquakes, with O.S.

The romantic guitar eventually led to Antonio de Torres Jurado's fan- braced Spanish guitars, the immediate precursors of the modern classical guitar. From the late 18th century the guitar achieved considerable general popularity though, as Ruggero Chiesa stated, subsequent scholars have largely ignored its place in classical music.Quoted at the \\"Early Romantic Guitar\\" website It was the era of guitarist-composers such as Fernando Sor, Ferdinando Carulli, Mauro Giuliani and Matteo Carcassi. In addition several well-known composers not generally linked with the guitar played or wrote for it: Luigi Boccherini and Franz Schubert wrote for it in several pieces,See Ars Classical website Hector Berlioz was a proficient guitarist who neither played keyboards nor received an academic education in music, the violin virtuoso Niccol√≤ Paganini played guitar informally and Anton Diabelli produced a quantity of guitar compositions (see List of compositions by Anton Diabelli).  History  The first known guitar built to be strung with single strings rather than pairs of strings was built in 1774 by Ferdinando Gagliano in Naples. This guitar, which was displayed in the Heyer Museum, Cologne before that museum was dispersed, showed some important differences from the modern classical guitar. It had 5 single strings, inlaid brass frets, a long neck relative to string length (the fretboard meeting the body at the 11th fret), a pegged bridge and a characteristic figure-8 shaped tuning head. It lacked only a sixth string to make it identical with the early romantic guitar. The earliest extant six-string guitar was built in 1779 by Gaetano Vinaccia (1759 ‚Äì after 1831)The Classical Mandolin by Paul Sparks (1995), page 225, quote: \\"Vinaccia, Gaetano (1759‚Äìafter 1831)\\" in Naples, Italy. The Vinaccia family of luthiers is also known for developing the mandolin. This guitar shows no sign of modification from a double-course guitar. while the authenticity of guitars before the 1790s is often in question. Moretti's 6-string method appeared in 1792. Around the same time France also began to produce guitars with six single courses and Spain soon followed. Italian, French, and Spanish six- string guitars differed from the baroque guitar in similar ways. In addition to the advances already mentioned the guitar was gradually given more pronounced curves and a larger body while ornamentation was more restrained, remaining mostly around the edges of the body and the sound hole, which lacked a decorative rose to allow more volume. Frets were no longer of tied gut but fixed strips of some harder material, first ebony or ivory then metal. Wooden pegs were later replaced by metal tuning machines.Harvey Turnbull, P. Sparks. \\"The Early Six String Guitar.\\" from the Groves Online Dictionary article: \\"Guitar\\", last updated December 2009\\"Early Six String Guitars\\" from Darcy Kuronen, Dangerous Curves: The Art of the Guitar, Boston: The Museum of Fine Arts, 2000.  Technique  The many instructional books of the time show no standard playing technique but rather a reliance upon earlier traditions. For example, they often recommend that the right hand be supported on the guitar's table although the Spanish guitarist Nicario Juaralde took the modern view, warning against a loss of right-hand freedom. The thumb and first two fingers were mainly used for plucking with, in the 19th century, a free stroke (tirando) more commonly than the rest stroke (apoyando) that was favoured in the 20th century. Unlike most classical guitarists today, players were divided as to whether or not use fingernails. Fernando Sor, for example, did not use them while his compatriot Dionisio Aguado did.See also Neil Caulkins, \\"Flesh or Nails: An Historical Issue,\\" Guitar International, October 1987: 11-12. The narrower fretboard of the romantic guitar allowed the left-hand thumb to be used by some guitarists to fret the sixth string although Fernando Sor deprecates this in his method, recommending that the left-hand thumb remain at the rear centre of the neck and noting that the \\"high\\" thumb position aids neither bass-string fingering nor support of the guitar. Romantic guitars often had a neck-strap around the player's neck while Dionisio Aguado invented a \\"tripodion\\" for holding the instrument. Aguado also advocated a relaxed posture, leaning back in a chair with both feet solidly on the ground rather than using a footstool to achieve the later conventional posture, the edge of the chair being used to keep the guitar from sliding down to the right, bringing the neck upward, closer to the player's torso, rather than projecting to the left.Thomas Heck, \\"A Relaxing Way to Hold the Guitar: Variation on a Theme by Aguado?\\" from Soundboard magazine, 2004.

It was originally the site of a Lazarist hospice in the eighteenth century. History The origin of the name Vieux Lazaret dates back to the 18th century, when a hospice (or Lazaret) existed in the village of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape. This hospice, provided by the Lazarists, offered comfort and shelter for the poor and infirm. The Lazarists were a silent order of monks, which were founded in 1625 by St Vincent de Paul to look after the sick and the needy in the French countryside. The buildings eventually fell into disuse, and were sold by the commune during the 19th century to the Quiot family. Afterwards, the Quiot family used the structures as agricultural buildings. =Modernization= While originally situated in the village of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape in close proximity to other properties owned by the Quiot family, these original buildings have today been extended and modernized, and now form the main center of the agricultural activities of Vignobles J√©r√¥me Quiot.

She is an inn-keeper, who runs the Boar's Head Tavern, at which Sir John Falstaff and his disreputable cronies congregate. The character appears in four plays: Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2, Henry V and The Merry Wives of Windsor. Character and role In all the plays Quickly is characterised as a woman with strong links to the criminal underworld, but who is nevertheless preoccupied with her own respectable reputation. Her speech is filled with malapropisms, double entendres and \\"bawdy innuendo\\". Her name may be a pun on \\"quick lay\\", though \\"quick\\" also had the meaning of \\"alive\\", so it may imply \\"lively\\", which also commonly had a sexual connotation.J. Madison Davis, The Shakespeare Name and Place Dictionary, Routledge, 2012, p.406. Quickly's character is most fully developed in Henry IV, Part 2 in which her contradictory aspirations to gentility and barely concealed vulgarity are brought out in her language. According to James C. Bulman, she \\"unwittingly reaveals her sexual history\\" by her blithe malapropisms and \\"her character is both defined and undone by her absurdly original speech\\".James C. Bulman \\"Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2\\", The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's History Plays, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 170. Though her age is not specified, the comment that she is \\"pistol proof\\" has been interpreted to mean that she is past childbearing age,Melchiori, G. (ed.). The Second Part of King Henry IV, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. l126. and she says she has known Falstaff for 29 years.Henry IV, Part 2, Act 2, Scene 4. =Role in the plays= In Henry IV, Part 1, Mistress Quickly is described as the proprietor of the Boar's Head Tavern in the London neighbourhood of Eastcheap. She is married, as Prince Hal asks after her husband, referring to him as \\"an honest man\\"; he does not appear in the play. She participates in the mock-court scene in which Falstaff pretends to be the king. In Henry IV, Part 2, she asks the authorities to arrest Falstaff, accusing him of running up excessive debts and making a fraudulent proposal of marriage to her (implying that she is now a widow). Mistress Quickly has a friendship of long standing with Doll Tearsheet, a prostitute who frequents the tavern, and protects her against aggressive men she calls \\"swaggerers\\". At the end of that play, Mistress Quickly and Doll Tearsheet are arrested in connection with the beating to death of a man by Ancient Pistol. In The Merry Wives of Windsor she works as nurse to Caius, a French physician, but primarily acts as a messenger between other characters, communicating love notes in a plot largely concerned with misdirected letters. At the end she takes the role of the queen of the fairies in the practical joke played on Falstaff. In Henry V, she is referred to as Nell Quickly. She is with Falstaff at his deathbed, and describes his death to his friends. She marries Falstaff's ensign, Ancient Pistol, despite having previously been engaged to Corporal Nym. While Pistol is away in France, he receives a letter from which he learns that \\"my Doll is dead\\", having succumbed to the \\"malady of France\\" (syphilis). Many editors take the name Doll to be a misprint for \\"Nell\\", but it has also been interpreted as a reference to Doll Tearsheet rather than Quickly.Dr Andrew Griffin, Locating the Queen's Men, 1583‚Äì1603, Ashgate, 2013, p. 142F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion, 1550‚Äì1950, Funk & Wagnalls, New York, 1952, p. 525. =Continuity issues= The earliest depiction of Mistress Quickly (labelled \\"hostes[s]\\") with Falstaff, in a print from 1662 depicting popular stage characters of the time. Quickly's role in The Merry Wives is sufficiently different from her role in the other plays that some critics have suggested that she cannot be the same character. Nothing suggests that she already knows Falstaff (or Bardolph and Pistol), and there is no explanation of how she comes to working for Dr. Caius. However, there are also many other continuity problems with other characters in the play. For example, the play is set at an unspecified period in the reign of Henry IV, but Shallow is feuding with Falstaff from the beginning, even though in the Henriad plays he only realises his mistake in trusting him after Henry V is crowned. These oddities may have arisen because the play was written rapidly for a specific occasion.T. W. Craik (ed.), The Merry Wives of Windsor (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), 1‚Äì13. See also H. J. Oliver (ed.). The Merry Wives of Windsor (London: Arden, 1972), lv and Leslie Hotson, Shakespeare versus Shallow (London: Kessinger, 2003), 111‚Äì122. There are some signs of attempts to make the events fit the action of the Henriad plays, for example the brief scene in which Pistol expresses his attraction to her and says \\"she is my prize\\". This fits with his marriage to her in Henry V. There is no further reference to his pursuit of her in the play, but he plays the part of her consort in the fairy masque at the end. There are similar, less glaring problems with the Henriad plays. In Henry IV, Part 1 she is evidently a married innkeeper. No reference is made to the death of her husband in Part 2, just that Falstaff promises to marry her. Likewise, the tavern seems to evolve into a reputed brothel by the beginning of Henry V. In other literature Mistress Quickly appears along with Falstaff's other cronies in the play Falstaff's Wedding (1766), a comedy by William Kenrick, which is set in the period between the end of Henry IV, Part 2 and the beginning of Henry V. Mistress Quickly and Doll Tearsheet, having bribed their way out of prison, appear in the first act explaining to Falstaff how they were arrested. They later plot to disguise themselves as gentlewomen to find rich husbands, targeting Robert Shallow and his young cousin Abraham Slender. Quickly intends to marry Shallow, and Doll to marry Slender. The plan appears to succeed, but Shallow and Slender find out their true identities and switch places at the weddings with Ancient Pistol and Corporal Nym, so she ends up married to Pistol, as in Henry V. James White's book Falstaff's Letters (1796) purports to be a collection of letters written by Falstaff and his associates, provided by a descendant of Mistress Quickly's sister. She had inherited them from Mistress Quickly herself, who kept them in drawer in the Boar's Head Tavern until her death in \\"August 1419\\". The collection includes letters written by Mistress Quickly to Falstaff complaining of his behaviour.White, James, Falsteff's Letters, London, Robson, 1877. Alan Skinner's novel Master Quickly (2013) attempts to fill in the gaps in Shakespeare by revealing the truth about her neglected husband.

The lettering convention is Avcon for the company and AVCON (capitals) for the EV charging head. The AVCON conductive interface was used by the Ford Ranger EV truck and the Honda EV Plus. The AVCON conductive EV charging system consists of a rectangular charging head (the male handle) which plugs into an AVCON inlet (the female receptacle) mounted on the vehicle. It is compatible with the November 2001 version of the SAE J1772 \\"SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler\\" recommended practice for surface vehicles. The American and Japanese plug-in vehicles that came to market in 2011 such as the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf use a round connector based on the 2009 revised SAE J1772 specification for level 2 charging. Conductive versus inductive charging systems ‚Äì the historical battle The AVCON conductive interface was the primary competitor to the Magne Charge inductive charging paddle used by the General Motors EV1 and Chevy S10 EV, plus the 2002 Toyota RAV4 EV. Ford and Honda chose AVCON as a more cost effective EV charging solution to transfer the same 6KW AC power to the EV's on-board charging system (208 to 240 VAC, 40 amp circuit into the charging head). Many public EV charging installations funded by the California Air Resources Board (CARB ‚Äì money came from DMV fees) had to have both an inductive and a conductive AVCON charging head. This meant twice as much money was spent because the simple, cost-effective AVCON was not adopted by all Automakers. These public EV charging installations did not use Avcon model charging heads; they used the more expensive EVII ICS-200 model AVCON charging heads. Automakers abandoned their promise to CARB to produce production EVs for public purchase by using a CARB mandate loophole (selling slow neighborhood EVs or carts to obtain their CARB credits) and very few production EVs were actually sold to the public (either inductive or conductive). Success of the conductive system CARB now endorses SAE J1772 (SAE J1772-2009), the evolutionary conductive charging successor to the AVCON based on the SAE J1772-2001 standard.SAE J1772 Previously in 2002, AVCON was ultimately endorsed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) over Magne Charge, which caused GM to retire inductive paddle technology.\\"GM Pulls the Plug on Inductive Charging: Letter from General Motors Advanced Technology Vehicles.\\" (Website). EV1 Club. (Letter dated) 2002-03-15. Retrieved on 2007-08-23. Since conductive EV charging AVCONs can be used by all EVs by using an AVCON adapter box that provides a 240 V NEMA 14‚Äì50 outlet, and inductive EV charging cannot, some RAV4 EV drivers have taken to bringing their SPI TAL inductive charger with them. This allows RAV4 EVs with an inductive charging system to recharge from public, conductive, AVCON EV charging heads. This practice will fade away since virtually all 2011 and later production Electric Vehicles are equipped with a SAE J1772 charge port. Drivers of the few 2011 and later or conversion vehicles are either using SAE J1772 adapters that connect to their chargers or are putting SAE J1772 charge ports in their vehicles.Plug In America list of current and future Electric Vehicles and their charge port standards (Website). Retrieved on 2011-04-15. Charging stations With no current production EVs available using the AVCON standard, EV charging station hosts (the companies giving the free electric power: Costco, shopping malls, etc.) withdrew their support for the cost of repairs of their public AVCON EV charging stations. The Electric Auto Association (501.3c nonprofit) members have stepped up by having EV charging funds the public can donate to so these EV charging stations can be repaired after vandals damage them. This keeps the EVs on the road by extending their range for very little electricity cost to the host.

The road forms part of European route E01. History Originally planned in 1964 as the Belfast Urban Motorway,.Northern Ireland Roads Site - Belfast Urban Motorway URL accessed 17 July 2006 the route was to have been fully grade-separated and would have completely encircled the city centre. Due to lack of money and public opposition only the western portion was completed and this was originally not fully grade-separated. The entire road was built to dual two- lane standard. The southbound section from Grosvenor Road to Broadway was widened to three lanes in 2002. Major upgrade work completed in 2009 extended the third lane to the newly completed Broadway underpass, where the road now seamlessly merges into the M1 Motorway. The underpass opened on Friday 4 July 2008. On Saturday 16 August 2008 it completely filled with water due to several hours of torrential rainfall. This earned it the nickname 'The Wetlink'. The Westlink was built in two phases. Phase 1, connecting the M1 at Broadway to Grosvenor Road opened in February 1981..Northern Ireland Roads Site - Westlink URL accessed 17 July 2006 Both of these junctions were built as at-grade roundabouts, with a traffic-light junction serving Roden Street and Mulhouse Road half way between. Phase 2, extending the scheme from Grosvenor Road to York Street, was completed in March 1983. This section has two grade-separated junctions at Divis Street and Clifton Street and passes under Peter's Hill. The York Street terminus is at-grade and links to the M2 and, since its opening in January 1995, to the M3. Criticism / Future plans The Westlink has garnered much negative publicity over the years, owing to rush-hour traffic bottlenecks at its major intersections. The major renovation work from 2006-2009.Northern Ireland Roads Site - Westlink Upgrade URL accessed 17 July 2006 has seen the full grade-separation of the Broadway and Grosvenor Road junctions via underpasses and a third traffic lane is being added in both directions between Broadway and Divis Street. Left-in/left-out sliproads provided at Mulhouse Road (for access to the Royal Victoria Hospital), the closure of access to Roden Street and the provision of a segregated busway from Broadway into the Europa Buscentre were also completed. Detractors of this scheme point out that it will merely cause additional bottlenecks at the entry/exit point at York Street. However, plans to upgrade this junction to a fully free-flowing interchange have progressed (as of 16 March 2016) to the point where the scheme has been tendered.¬£130m York Street, Belfast, traffic scheme out to tender Accessed 17 March 2016 Provided funding is made available, construction is expected to run from November 2017 to December 2020.Assembly Questions - York Street Interchange: Update Accessed 2 February 2016 References Category:Roads in Northern Ireland Category:Roads in Belfast Category:Ring roads in the United Kingdom ","title":"Westlink (road)"},{"id":"5990109","text":"Jean-Baptiste-√âric Dorion (September 17, 1826 - November 1, 1866) was a journalist and political figure in Canada East.

The abolishment of district public offices is an ongoing reform to remove an extra level of administration from between the county and township levels. There have also been calls to abolish the prefecture level, and some provinces have transferred some of the power prefectures currently hold to the counties they govern. There are also calls to reduce the size of the provinces. The ultimate goal is to reduce the different administration levels from five to three, (Provincial, County, Village) reducing the amount of corruption that goes on in between and reducing the number of government workers to reduce budget. Although actual proposals differ in their details, many of the proposals contain the following points: Redrawing the provinces The current province boundaries of China were mostly drawn during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, and are criticized by some as relics of a divide and rule policy that prevailed during those times. Current provinces frequently transcend major cultural and geographical divides, encompassing areas that have little in common. On the other hand, many cultural blocs, such as the Yangtze delta, the Huai watershed, or the Hakka lands, are divided along boundaries that do not actually indicate any geographical or cultural divide. Proponents for redrawing province boundaries believe that boundaries should be redrawn to better reflect cultural and geographical divides, which would in turn help to reduce conflict within provinces, promote regional cooperation, and increase administrative efficiency. Opponents of this, on the other hand, point to the fact that despite disparities within provinces, these boundaries have remained more or less stable for many centuries, and form an important part of identity for all Chinese. Opponents also doubt whether realigning province borders to cultural boundaries would really help in promoting regional cooperation, or simply lead to increasing regionalism. Making the provinces smaller Proponents point to the size of current provinces, such as Henan, Shandong, and Sichuan, all of which have populations of close to 100 million people. It is said that such enormous size puts a staggering burden on provincial governments, resulting in inefficiency and poor responsiveness to grassroots needs and desires, as well as inability to concentrate on specific areas of development. In addition, some proponents of province shrinking believe that the current size of larger provinces has given them too much bargaining power with the central government, and is a negative influence on the territorial integrity of China. Opponents of province shrinking believe that increasing the number of provinces would simply increase the inefficiency of governmental bureaucracy. They also believe that smaller provinces would make the coordination of pan-regional efforts more difficult and, consequently, affect economic development. Moreover, they believe that current provinces are important parts of identity for individual Chinese and should not be tampered with. A variation on this theme is a call to increase the number of municipalities by carving major cities out of the provinces, which would basically achieve the same effect. The recent establishment of Hainan province (out of Guangdong) and Chongqing municipality (out of Sichuan) can be seen as experiments along this vein. Proposals have been made for the municipality status of cities such as Guangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Chengdu. Abolishing the prefecture level This proposal has recently gathered quite a lot of popularity. The reasons are based on the history of prefectures. By the constitution of China, provinces are supposed to govern counties directly‚Äîand prefectures (autonomous ones excepted) are neither mentioned nor endorsed. So when prefectures were originally being set up, they were an unofficial quasi-level to help provinces govern very large numbers of counties. As a result, prefectures are (unlike provinces or counties) often seen as nothing more than bureaucratic institutions. However, the constitution does allow for some cities, which are a constitutionally guaranteed level of administration, to be \\"prefecture-level\\" (in the sense that they can take surrounding counties under them), though the original intention was likely to have just a few very large cities in each province be prefecture-level cities that govern only the counties in their immediate suburbs. The rest of each province would still consist of counties under unofficial prefectures. (This was, in fact, the general situation before the 90's.) In recent years, however, there has been a trend to replace prefectures wholesale with prefecture-level cities. This takes advantage of the ambiguous wording in the constitution, and basically turns unofficial prefectures overnight into official levels endorsed in the constitution. This process took place very fast‚Äîmost provinces now govern all or most of their counties through only prefecture-level cities. In other words, an extra level of government has been \\"inserted\\" into the administrative structure. Proponents of reform say that this twist in events undermines the entire administrative structure of China by \\"sneaking in\\" an extra level \\"out of nowhere\\". More levels, they argue, lead to more corruption, more government spending, more inefficiency and idleness, and greater distance between the grassroots and the government. In addition, they claim that this arrangement over-emphasizes prefecture capitals (now they can claim, nominally and legally, to \\"be\\" the entire prefecture), and they argue that this has given prefectures license to sap resources that would otherwise go directly to counties. This in turn accentuates regional conflicts and the rich-poor gap. Also, if provinces are shrunk as well (see the proposal above), then there is even less need left for any prefectures at all to exist‚Äîafter all, they only exist because provinces are too large. (Autonomous prefectures, which are guaranteed in the constitution, are mostly exempted from such proposals.) Opponents of this change believe that it is unrealistic to expect any change to come to current provincial boundaries, and hence prefectures are here to stay, at least in the short term. Moreover, they claim that the sheer size of provinces (which, according to them, do not need to be shrunk) means that prefectures are needed as an intermediary level. Finally, they defend the establishment of prefecture-level cities by arguing that it helps in encouraging urbanization, and cooperative development of entire regions. Hainan and Chongqing, already mentioned above as apparent experiments in province shrinking, can also be seen as experiments in the abolishment of prefectures. Hainan has two prefecture-level cities, but those control only districts (i.e. their own urbanized area); all the counties of Hainan are under the direct charge of the province, with no prefecture-level intermediary. Chongqing, which is province- sized (despite its status as a municipality), has no intermediate prefecture- level subdivisions of any sort. In addition, the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Hubei, and Henan have initiated a number of reforms, giving counties a wide range of rights currently held by prefectures. Increasing the size of counties and townships The abolishment of district public offices is part of this reform; originally set up as an intermediate level to help counties deal with very large numbers of towns and township, they are now being phased out, and towns and townships are being enlarged to partially fill their place. In effect, this reform is already being carried out in most parts of the country. In addition, there are proposals to merge smaller counties as well. Proponents of this believe that the sheer size of the Chinese bureaucracy (and hence, the sheer amount of resources that it consumes) is due to the extraordinary number of counties and townships‚Äîand they believe that the number can be reduced. Opponents of this believe that the population density of China means that tiny counties and townships are needed for effective government. They also claim that any drastic change to grassroots-level government would have adverse effects on social stability. Bypassing the provincial hierarchy Another reform is to have certain institutions of the central government form institutions which completely bypass the number provincial hierarchies. The model for this is federal institutions of the United States of America and the purpose is to prevent provincial and local interference in some functions of the central government. The Military Area Commands of the People's Liberation Army have long been administered in this fashion precisely to prevent local officials from exercising control and influence over the military. One recent example of this reform has been the People's Bank of China which in 1999 abolished all provincial and local branches creating regional districts which do not correspond to provincial boundaries. A similar reform has been suggested for the judicial system creating circuit and district courts which do not correspond to provincial boundaries to reduce corruption and government payroll.

Service history The fate of U-2342 was not unusual, as the seas around the German coastline were subject to very heavy allied air attack during the final two years of the war, with the Royal Air Force seeking to restrict German movement by sowing thousands of air-dropped naval mines. This tactic delayed the production and training of new boats and disrupted coastal shipping. It also wrecked a number of new boats, including U-2342, before they had a chance to enter the Battle of the Atlantic. U-2342 was travelling in a convoy of ten boats taking essential supplies and personnel to Norway on Boxing Day 1944. The operation was highly secret, and submarines were used to disguise it from any prying reconnaissance aircraft. Whilst just north of Swinem√ºnde, U-2342 activated an air-dropped mine and fell out of the convoy, slowly sinking as the other boats carried on their passage northwards. Rescue vessels found some of the crew, but seven sailors, including the boat's captain were not found, lost in the explosion. Demolition experts blew up the wreck in 1954 to clear the seaway, and parts were taken to shore, where they were broken up for scrap.

Construction began on the Italian Renaissance-style building in 1916 as an addition to the original Book Building, and finished a decade later. Designed in the Academic Classicism style, in addition to the 38 rentable floors, it has two basement levels and two mechanical floors beneath the green copper roof, a roofing style shared by the nearby Westin Book Cadillac Hotel. Retail and gallery floors used to reside on the first and second floors, with businesses previously occupying the rest. The building is currently unoccupied but is under renovation by Bedrock Real Estate Services and is planned to open again. History Named after the famous Book Brothers of Detroit, it was briefly the tallest building in the city until the completion of the Penobscot Building in 1928. A taller Book Tower of 81 stories was to be built at the opposite end of the Book Building, but the Great Depression cancelled those plans. The building contains a cartouche by the Detroit architectural sculptor Corrado Parducci. From its opening through the mid-1970s the Book Tower remained a prestigious address on Washington Boulevard. Like many structures in the city, its fortunes declined until 1988 when the owners defaulted on the mortgage. In 1989, Travelers Insurance, the principal mortgage-holder, took possession and sold the building to developer John Lambrecht who previously purchased and renovated the Cadillac Tower a few blocks east. Lambrecht had similar plans for the Book Building and Tower; however, his untimely death later that year brought things to a halt. Lambrecht's widow attempted to manage the property and made some improvements, but she was unable to maintain momentum. On July 25, 2006, she sold the Book Tower to the Pagan Organization, a New York-based investment group. Pagan's plans were for a renovation and conversion of both the Book Tower and Book building into a mix of retail, residential, and office units. The Pagan Organization created the Northeast Commercial Services Corp. to manage the building. Northeast Commercial Services Corp. filed for Chapter 11 protection Wednesday, May 24, 2007, after defaulting on its mortgage loan. The last tenant, Bookie's Tavern, closed its doors January 5, 2009, and moved to a new location downtown, leaving the entire building vacant. In November 2009, Key Investment Group of Clinton Township, Michigan announced intentions to buy and renovate the building as a mixed-use development with high rise residential units, office space, and retail. Weeks earlier, the investors revealed that they were looking to purchase the building from AKNO Enterprises of Vancouver for a green renovation. In January 2010, Rosemarie Dobek, CFO of Key Investment Group, reported that the group was pursuing plans for a US$320 million green renovation to include the Book Tower and four other Detroit buildings. In August 2013, Book Tower owner ANKO Enterprises of Vancouver, British Columbia, filed a tax abatement for a future renovation of the building; however, specific plans were not disclosed. On August 28, 2015, Bedrock Real Estate, owned by Dan Gilbert, announced it would purchase the ¬±Book complex, including the Book Tower. The purchase price was reported to be about $30 million. Since that time, work has been on-going to renovate and restore the building into mixed-use retail, commercial and residential.

The Sui Dynasty annals describe an advanced kingdom called Chi Tu in 607, when Chang Chun was sent as an ambassador there. The location of Chi Tu was disputed to be around Kelantan or Pahang state in Malay Peninsula, or in Songkhla and Pattani Province of southern Thailand. The best evidence to support the Kelantan theory was when the envoys left Chi Tu, the sail took 10 days to reach Champa, this indicates the kingdom was located somewhere 'red earth' around the main river of Kelantan. The inscribed Buddhagupta Stone found in Kedah mentioned a Raktamrttika, meaning \\"red earth land\\". History Replica of Buddhagupta stone on display at the National History Museum, Kuala Lumpur. The Chi Tu kingdom is believed to have existed as early as 100 BC to the 6th century AD. The royal family's name was Chu-dan (which means Gautama Buddha) and the king was Li-fo-duo-se. According to Chinese records, Chi Tu was built by kit mow (Mon-Khmer) peoples who sailed from the coast of Funan (southern Indochina). Centuries later, the local inhabitants, replaced Funan peoples. \\"... Chi Tu is a derivation nation of Funan, located in within the southern sea, sailing hundred days to reach, the majority terrain was red, thus named Red Earth Kingdom (Chi means red, Tu means earth). East bordering Po-Lo-La, West bordering Po-Lo-So, South bordering Ho Lo Tan, thousands of square miles in land area. The king has three wives and the kingdom embraced Buddhism ...\\". Chi Tu kingdom along with Langkasuka, Kedah and others were early important trade centers (approximately 100 BC to 700 AD). During this period, ships coming from China and Funan (from Indian Ocean as well) stop at the coast of Malay Peninsula. They get the local porters to transport the goods, using rafts, elephants and manpower along the Early transpeninsular routeway and part of the ancient Spice Route (Sea Route). By the 800 AD, the Chi Tu kingdom went into decline. Location Scholars do not agree on the location of Raktamaritika. While some consider it in the area of Phatthalung / Songkhla area, or Kelantan. The ruins around the Songkhla lake such as Bang Kaeo in Phatthalung or Sathing Phra in Songkhla then might be one of the cities of Raktamaritika. =Sources from Indian scholars= J.L. Meons (1937) believed that early Srivijaya was located in Kelantan and K.A. Nilakanta Sastri (1949) supported the idea. The Kelantan theory may not be far-fetched, since Chinese Sui Dynasty annals of the 7th century describe an advanced kingdom called Chi Tu or Raktamrittika (as in Kelantanese history) as being in Kelantan, which the name was later changed to \\"Sri Wijaya Mala\\". The founding of Sri Wijaya Mala was 667 BC with its capital called \\"Valai\\", and it was situated along the upper Kelantan river of Pergau, known for its rich gold mines. It was until 570 BC that the kingdom changed its name to Sri Wijaya. =Songkhla vicinity theory= The inscription of the Buddhagupta Stone found in Kedah mentioned a Raktamaritika, the meaning is red earth land, to be the home town of a seafarer named Buddhagupta. The old name of Songkhla is Singgora (City of Lions), which coincides with the fact that according to the Chinese chronicles the capital of Chitu was Sing-Ha (means lion) and also the nearby Singhanakhon district. This name may also be related to Tambralinga because there is \\"Tam\\" (means red) in this name as same as Raktamaritika and Tampapanni. And this state has appeared in 642, the same area of the central Malay peninsula after Chitu has already faded away from the history. The best evidence supporting this theory is the mention that when the envoys left Chitu, the sailing took 10 days to reach Champa, which indicates the kingdom was located at the 'red earth' areas such as Rattaphum because Rattaphum means red earth as well.
