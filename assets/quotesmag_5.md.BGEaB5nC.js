Personal Ravelo currently resides in Newark, New Jersey, with his son Jerson Jr. While many fighters pressure their children, particularly their namesakes, into following their fistic footsteps, Ravelo doesn't want that for his son. \\"I'm doing this for my son and my family. As of right now, he doesn't even show no interest in boxing, which is good.\\" Ravelo's favorite fighter is Roy Jones Jr. \\"The way he fights, the things that he's done are incredible\\" says Ravelo. \\"A lot of people don't give him credit. They talk about he never fought anybody, but like he said in his song, he just made them look like nobodies.\\" Amateur career Ravelo was the 1998 National Golden Gloves Middleweight champion. Ravelo also represented the Dominican Republic as a Middleweight at the 2000 Sydney Olympic games, he was eliminated in the opening round by Paul Miller of Australia, on an 8-7 decision. Professional career Upon turning professional, Ravelo signed a promotional deal with Lou Dibella's Dibella Entertainment. He made his debut as a professional on January 27, 2001, in Madison Square Garden in New York City, where he defeated America's Miguel Gutierrez. He became the first 2000 Olympian to reach double digit wins as a pro. In 2004 Ravelo was upset by David Alfonso Lopez by TKO. Ravelo says, \\"Before that fight I didn't want to fight anymore. I didn't have no confidence because that was prior to me getting the surgeries and that was when I was coming back. It helped me come back to get my confidence back up and come back to reality. Before that fight, I was walking on a cloud.\\" Numerous injuries to his back and right hand hampered his career, and he didn't see any action in the year 2005 as a result. In that time period, things soured with Jerson's promotional situation. The contract contained a clause stating that if Jerson was injured for over a year, Dibella Entertainment could terminate the contract. Ravelo was subsequently released by Dibella. \\"Once a fighter has back problems\\", says Ravelo, \\"he's always going to have back problems. I can go 6 months, a year without feeling my back at all. But I can wake up one day and for a week my back will be hurting me.\\" In 2006, Jerson signed a promotional contract with The Contender Group. \\"They care about their fighters,\\" Ravelo said. \\"They're not trying to make a quick buck out of a fighter, they're looking long term.\\" Returning from substantial layoffs, Ravelo reeled off three consecutive first round knockouts. The next order of business was a showdown with then-undefeated Allan Green of Tulsa, Oklahoma on October 14, 2006. Jerson was stopped in the eighth round. In that fight, Ravelo suffered another injury to his right hand. Ravelo rebounded in 2007 with a unanimous decision over England's Paul Buchannan, whom he knocked down in the third round. That fight was a part of The Contender's USA versus UK special. Ravelo has gone through a who's who of trainers in his career, including Mark Breland, Tommy Brooks, Tommy Parks, Charles Murray, Anthony Ham, Bouie Fischer and Oscar Suarez. He is currently trained by Nettles Nasser, who also guides Henry Crawford and Omar Sheika. Of Nasser, Ravelo says, \\"He's a good trainer. He teaches the right things. He tells you what to do. He motivates his fighters. I know he don't get a lot of credit because he's young. I think he's one of the better coaches out there.\\" Ravelo's current record stands at 21-5.

The log stockade was square in shape and covered . It contained 20 log cabins and was protection for the settlers against wild animals and Indians. Today, a reconstructed fortification, maintained by Nashville Parks and Recreation, stands near the site of the original structure. Background The American Revolution broke out one month after Richard Henderson's purchase agreement with the Cherokee for the lands of the proposed Transylvania settlement was signed. Most Cherokee towns wished to stay neutral in the growing contest between the colonists and Britain, but Chief Dragging Canoe considered the war an opportunity to resist the continual encroachment by frontiersmen on traditional Cherokee territories. American retaliatory raids against his Cherokee towns in eastern Tennessee eventually forced Dragging Canoe to move his people farther to the south and west -down the Tennessee River. In 1779 they settled along Chickamauga Creek (near present-day Chattanooga, Tennessee), becoming known as the Chickamauga Cherokees. Later they were forced to move even further west and southwest, where they established the \\"Five Lower Towns\\", and were often thereafter referred to as the \\"Lower Cherokee\\". Dragging Canoe had promised to make any white settlers pay a \\"heavy price\\" if they moved into the Cumberland River valley, and he was to make good his word. Preparations Aside from a short- lived trading post established in 1689 by fur trader Martin Chartier,Robert Trail, \\"Livingston County, Kentucky: Stepping Stone to Illinois,\\" The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society, Vol. 69, No. 3 (July, 1971), pp. 239-272.Chartier Family Association family tree Martin Chartier Historical MarkerSherman Day, Historical Collections of the State of Pennsylvania: Containing a Copious Selection of the Most Interesting Facts, Traditions, Biographical Sketches, Anecdotes, Etc., Relating to Its History and Antiquities, Both General and Local, with Topographical Descriptions of Pennsylvania county and regional histories, G. W. Gorton, 1843; p. 391.Martin Chartier, Nashville's First White Person no attempt had previously been made to permanently settle the area then known only as French LickFrench Lick History along the banks of the Cumberland River. In 1779, John Buchanan Sr. migrated with his family from Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, to North Carolina. He first went to the \\"over-mountain\\" area of Virginia (modern day eastern Kentucky) in order to leave the party's women and small children in a secure area. The settlers then headed down the Cumberland River and, in early 1779, built a fortified station at French Lick (later to be called Fort Nashborough). In February 1779, Overmountain leader James Robertson set out with a nine-man exploration party to the same area. Robertson had been a member of the Regulator Movement, as well as a founding leader of the Watauga settlement. A 3,000 acre (12 km¬≤) land grant was negotiated with Richard Henderson, and arrangements were made for the movement of the group's families to the area. The colonists agreed to pay Henderson 26 pounds of silver per hundred acres, which was then considered an expensive price (equal to approximately $6.20/acre). Robertson charged three of his men to stay behind and plant corn in preparation for the arrival of the much larger group, which had remained behind in the Washington District. Robertson then journeyed to the Illinois Country (an area claimed by Virginia at the time) to meet with General George Rogers Clark (a land agent of Virginia), who was dispensing \\"cabin rights\\" on very favorable terms. Robertson, whose 1772 Watauga settlement had originally been opposed to the control of the area by the Province of North Carolina, thought it possible that the yet-to-be established extended border between the Virginia and North Carolina frontiers might throw control of any new Cumberland River settlement to Virginia. Therefore, he wished to get secure and clear land titles to eliminate any future complications over ownership. After making provisional arrangements with General Clark, Robertson prepared for the colonization of the Cumberland country. Robertson by land On 1 November 1779, Robertson led some 200 settlers from Fort Patrick Henry, on Long Island, Kingsport, Tennessee toward Fort Nashborough. These settlers were to prepare for the later arrival of the party's women and children and were led by John Donelson out of the east over waterways. Robertson's brothers, Mark and John, were in the party, as well as his oldest son, 11-year-old Jonathan, who drove the sheep. The men were joined en route by John Rains and a number of his friends and allied families. This group decided to settle at French Lick, rather than continue upriver into that area which later became Kentucky. Their journey ended on Christmas Day, due to delays caused by the winter (described as the coldest one any of them had ever known).Founders Museum Donelson by river Starting out in early 1780, Donelson's group was halted after traveling only three miles on their river voyage. Ice, snow and cold had set in and the frozen river made progress impossible. There was no further movement until mid-February, and when the boats were eventually cut loose, they were hampered again by the swell of the river due to incessant heavy rains. Donelson's group also suffered greatly from Dragging Canoe's promise of vengeance. On their way to French Lick they had to pass the Chickamauga towns on the westward flow of the Tennessee River. When the Donelson party had succeeded in that, however, and made the turn to the north (in what is today Hardin County, Tennessee), the natives attacked them as they went past the Tennessee River's \\"Big Bend\\" (at Cerro Gordo). The war party captured one boat with 28 people on board. On March 20, 1780, they arrived at the mouth of the Tennessee River and set up camp on a lowland which is now the site of Paducah, Kentucky. Weary, hungry and low on provisions, they were confronted by new difficulties. Their boats, having been constructed to float downstream, were scarcely able to ascend the rapid current of the Ohio, which due to heavy spring rains was particularly high and fast. They were also ignorant of the distance yet to be traveled, and the length of time which would be required to reach their final destination. Some of the company decided to abandon the journey to French Lick. A part of them floated down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to Natchez, the rest settling at points in Illinois along the Ohio. The others, however, were determined to pursue their course up the Ohio from Paducah to the mouth of the Cumberland River, a distance which turned out to be only fifteen miles (24 km). Upon seeing it, they were unsure it was the Cumberland, because it seemed very much smaller in volume than they had expected to find. However, they had heard of no stream flowing into the Ohio between the Tennessee and Cumberland, and, therefore, decided to make the ascent. They were soon assured by the widening channel that they were correct in their conjectures. In order to make progress upstream, Donelson rigged his boat, the Adventure, with a small sail made out of a sheet. To prevent ill effects from any sudden gust of wind, a man was stationed at each lower corner of this sail with instructions to loosen it when the breeze became too strong. =Settled= Upon reaching their destination, Donelson reunited with Robertson, and the group cleared the land, building a settlement which they named in honor of General Francis Nash, who had won acclaim fighting in the American Revolution. Together these frontiersmen built other fortified \\"stations\\" in the vicinity which were named for members of the party; among these were Eaton's Station (on the east side of the Cumberland); Clover Bottom Mansion (the Donelson family plantation on the Stones River); Freeland's Station; Mansker's Station; Thompson's Station; and Buchanan's Station‚Äîmany still remembered as neighborhoods or towns in the modern Nashville area. Political significance Robertson drew up a constitution, called the Cumberland Compact, and the area began a new phase of autonomy from the government of North Carolina. Fort life Buffalo, black bear, wild turkeys, white tail deer, beaver, raccoon, fox, elk, wolf, cougar, mink, and otter were abundant in the untamed forests. The pioneer family's most treasured possessions were their guns for hunting, axes for wood-cutting, seeds, and hoes for cultivating. Frontier life was a constant struggle, and without these necessities, survival was at risk. Corn was the most important crop for their daily diet, and corn whiskey was the remedy for all health problems. Henderson, ever the profiteer, arranged to have corn shipped from Kentucky at a cost of $200 a bushel for that first winter in Nashville. Linen, made from flax, or cotton was used for clothes. Animal skins and hides supplemented their wardrobes. The first white child born in the new settlement was James Robertson's son, Felix, on January 11, 1781. He eventually became one of the most influential physicians of the era. The Land Grab Act of 1783 offered lots in tracts for the price of about five dollars. Much property was awarded for honorable military service. Native American lands reserved by treaties and previous claims were not legally available, but in the haste, confusion and greed, there were many squatters and boundary disputes. Native American attacks The largest and most numerous tribes in the region were the Cherokee, who were originally peaceful to the eastern British colonials. But from the beginning, the Cumberland settlement had very little peace, and was continually attacked. The tribes resented past concessions, broken treaties and further encroachment on their hunting grounds. Because of political pressures, the Chickasaw decided to make peace with the Cumberland settlers. Piomingo, an influential leader, considered the pioneers to be less of a threat than the Spanish government. Dragging Canoe's Cherokee, and their Muscogee allies, continued attacks on the frontier settlements for the next fourteen years. The settlers had to be on guard against Indian attacks at all times. On April 2, 1781, a force of Chickamauga Cherokee led by Dragging Canoe attacked the fort at the bluffs. In the attack, known as the \\"Battle of the Bluffs,\\" the Indians succeeded in luring most of the men out of the fort, then cutting them off from the entrance. But the settlers managed to escape back to the fort while the Cherokee captured their horses. They also had help from the fort's dogs, turned loose by the women. The attacks decreased the following year. The Battle of Fort Nashborough (also known as Battle of the Bluff) was fought between the Washington District Regiment of the North Carolina militia and the Chickamaugans Cherokees on April 2-3, 1781 at this fort. Replica A small replica of the fort, located in Downtown Nashville along First Avenue North, several hundred meters from the original site of the fort, was built in the 1930s (out of retired telephone poles) as one of the public works relief projects growing from the Roosevelt Administration's efforts to deal with the massive increase in unemployment caused by the Great Depression, and was subsequently repaired and renovated several times. In recent decades, the facility was not usually manned but allowed self-guided tours in daylight hours. After suffering considerable damage in the 2010 Tennessee flood the facility was closed, and has been slated for demolition and replacement by a memorial plaza. On July 13, 2017 a ribbon-hacking ceremony was held at the site of the newly renovated Fort Nashborough History Center, where families from Nashville and around the world can learn about Nashville's story. The new History Center is a more inclusive representation of the past, and includes a plaza dedicated to Native American history.

It was the first digital camera in the EOS-1 line, succeeding Canon final flagship film camera, the 1V. It was also the first professional-level digital camera developed and released entirely by Canon, the previous D2000 being a collaborative effort with Kodak. It has a 1.3x crop factor with a image sensor sourced . The camera shares its body design with the Canon EOS-1V 35mm camera (with the additional battery grip attached). It was complemented by the slower, higher-resolution 1Ds in 2002 and succeeded by the 1D Mark II in April 2004. Features The 1D was seen as a major breakthrough for a professional news and sports camera after its predecessors, the Canon EOS DCS series and EOS D2000, which had both been produced in co-operation with Kodak. In comparison with those cameras, the 1D had faster image processing speed, much cleaner high ISO speeds, realtime JPEG encoding, and it could shoot at eight frames per second, something which was then unheard of in the world of digital cameras. In addition to offering a wide range of image settings, it had many features that are not present in its successors: * Features a CCD sensor instead of a CMOS sensor. * The only Canon SLR (film or digital) to have an X-sync speed of up to 1/500 of a second. * The only Canon SLR (film or digital) to have a shutter speed of up to 1/16000 of a second. * The only PC connectivity was provided via an IEEE 1394 (FireWire) connection, as USB was still only on version 1.1, which was far too slow for transferring large amounts of high-resolution image files. * While not a feature, it was the only 1D Pro Digital camera from Canon to have no magnify in playback. The 1D also included a microphone for voice annotation.\\"Canon EOS-1D Review\\" by Phil Askey at dpreview.com Nov 2001. Retrieved 16 Oct 2010. This feature had been present in the earlier DCS and D2000, and was retained on later models. It was added to the 5D line on the 5D Mark II, though this was mainly intended to be used with the camera's video recording mode. In addition the camera used an externally mounted white balance sensor, another feature which had earlier appeared on the D2000. The 1D is the first Canon DSLR to store 9,999 images to one folder - a feature that eventually became the standard for subsequent Canon products (from its compact point and shoots to its DSLR cameras).

It undertakes to guarantee work for every citizen.\\" For the carrying out of this decree, Louis Blanc wanted the formation of a ministry of labor, but this was shelved by his colleagues, who as a compromise appointed a government labor Commission, under the presidency of Louis Blanc, with power of inquiry and consultation only. The implementation of the February decree was entrusted to the minister of public works, M. Marie, and various public works were immediately started. The initial stages of the national works prompted the following account: The workman first of all obtained a certificate from the landlord of his house, or furnished apartments, showing his address, whether in Paris or the department of the Seine. This certificate was visaed and stamped by the police commissary of the district. The workman then reported to the office of the maire of his ward, and, on delivering this document, received in exchange a note of admission to the national works, bearing his name, residence and calling, and enabling him to be received by the director of the workplaces in which vacancies existed. All went well while the number of the unemployed was less than 6000, but as soon as that number was exceeded, the workmen of each arrondissement, after having visited all the open works in succession without result, returned to their mayor‚Äôs offices tired, starving and discontented. In June 1848, the Workshops were closed down, leading to the June Days uprising.

() was founded in Taipei in 1954 by Huang Chi-Chun and Chang Kuo An. The company's headquarters is established in Hsinchu County, Taiwan and sells its two-wheeled products under the brand name SYM. Sanyang's three major production bases are in Taiwan, China and Vietnam. The company manufactures and sells scooters, motorcycles and ATVs under the SYM brand, while it also manufactures automobiles and mini-trucks under the Hyundai brand. Since it began, the company has produced more than 800 thousand automobiles and 16 million scooters and motorcycles. The annual sales revenue of the company exceeds 1 Billion US dollars and it produces about 600,000 units of motorcycles and 20,000 automobiles per year. SYM currently employs around 2,300 people in its Taiwan manufacturing plants.http://www.sanyang.com.tw/filehub/upload/34.pdf History In 1954 Sanyang Electrics was formed to manufacture dynamoelectric light sets for bicycles. It was restructured into Sanyang Industry Co. Ltd. and entered a technical agreement with Honda in 1961 to begin local assembly of motorcycles, the first motorcycle manufacturer in Taiwan (30% local content). In 1969 assembly of small Honda cars (N600, TN360) began. As Sanyang's own motorcycles entered direct competition with Honda's products worldwide, the relationship was terminated in January 2002 and Honda began building cars themselves as Honda Taiwan Co. Ltd. Sanyang instead signed a contract with Hyundai and currently assembles much of their lineup for the domestic Taiwanese market. Sanyang Industry was renamed as Sanyang Motor Co. Ltd. in January, 2015. The Company has its main office in the Hsinchu Industrial Park in Hsinchu County, Taiwan. It has a subsidiary in Xiamen city, China, named Xiamen Xiashing Motorcycle Co., Ltd., and another subsidiary in Bien Hoa, Dong Nai, Vietnam, named Vietnam Manufacturing & Export Processing Co., Ltd. (VMEP). Global operations Sanyang is a strategic partner of the Hyundai Motor Company and manufactures Hyundai automobiles and mini-trucks in Taiwan. Sanyang also has ties with international companies like International Truck, Bombardier Recreational Products and Mahindra & Mahindra Limited in India. In July 2005, Sanyang launched a new range of two-wheelers for sale in the European market. The range includes the GTS scooter (available with 125 cc, 200 cc and 250 cc engines), the MIO scooter (50 cc and 100 cc), and two ATV models: the Trackrunner leisure ATV (200 cc engine), and the 250 cc Quadlander off-roader. In January 2006, Sanyang signed an agreement with the Kinetic Motor Company of India for a purchase of 2,065,000 equity shares and technical collaboration, which will amount to Sanyang holding an 11.1% (approx.) stake of the enhanced capital of Kinetic Motor Company Limited. With Sanyang taking a minority stake, the management control will be retained with the Kinetic Group. In 2008, the two-wheeler division of The Kinetic Group was taken over by Mahindra, a leading manufacturer of utility vehicles in India. In 2002, SYM scooters began appearing in the US courtesy of a grey market importer SYM USA from West Palm Beach, Florida. Several hundred units were imported from the UK that were non-EPA, non-DOT certified and a rogue US distribution network developed. In 2003 an official importer, SYM America, organized by the Malaguti USA importer, began operations selling in the Southeast and Puerto Rico. In 2004 Tomos USA negotiated with Sanyang for exclusive sales in the US, but the deal was called off later due to some disagreement on contact details. Sanyang later cooperated with Carter Brothers Mfg. Co. Inc for its sales in the US. Malaguti USA ceased and became Martin Racing Performance and still carried some parts for the DD 50 and Jet Euro 50. In an agreement reached with Carter Brothers Mfg. Co. Inc. the company abandoned the SYM scooter distribution project for the US in exchange for assistance in developing the after-market go kart product and stocking the SYM upgrade lines for Carter Brothers Mfg. Co. Inc. In January 2006, SYM signed a partnership agreement with Carter Brothers Mfg. Co. Inc. for exclusive distribution rights in the United States of America. Operating out of a office-production-and-warehouse facility in the small town of Brundidge, Alabama, south of Montgomery, Carter Brothers claims to be the oldest and largest continually operating manufacturer of go-karts and off-road buggies in the world. Established in 1936 by the brothers W.W. Carter and Charlie Carter, the company initially specialized in manufacturing agricultural machinery, lawnmowers and personal gardening equipment. On 12 July 2010, a fire destroyed Carter Brother's main warehouse and manufacturing facility, resulting in the loss of approximately 3,000 unsold SYM scooters. A subsequent investigation by the Alabama State Fire Marshal's Office determined that the cause of the fire was arson. In March 2011, an official at Carter Brothers Mfg. Co. Inc. made it known to the editor of the Team Symba web blog that the partnership agreement between SYM and Carter Brothers would end as of 1 April 2011. Also in March 2011, Alliance Powersports, Inc. (a subsidiary of Lance Powersports, Inc.) of Mira Loma, California, notified existing SYM dealers that it had signed an exclusive distribution agreement with SYM for the western half of the US. In October 2006, SYM opened a second manufacturing facility in Nagoya, Japan. They are known for their parody advertisements on Japanese subways, taxis and cars. Their slogan, reading \\"ÂêçÂè§Â±ã„Å´„Åì„ÅÑ„ÇÑ!\\", literally meaning \\"Come down to Nagoya!\\", is known by many locals. In July 2014, Walter H. C. Chang was appointed Chairman of Sanyang Motor.

The inaugural conference was intended to provide a set of regulations for North Sea fisheries. The High Contracting Parties, which included Great Britain, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium and France, entered the convention for a period of five years. The convention, which operated only outside the three- mile limit from land, was defined as follows: *The fishermen of each country shall enjoy the exclusive right of fishery within the distance of 3 (nautical) miles (5.56 km) from low-water mark along the whole extent of the coasts of their respective countries, as well as of the dependent islands and banks. *As regards bays, the distance of 3 miles (5.56 km) shall be measured from a straight line drawn across the bay, in the part nearest the entrance, at the first point where the width does not exceed 10 miles (18.5 km). *The present article shall not in any way prejudice the freedom of navigation and anchorage in territorial waters accorded to fishing boats, provided they conform to the special police regulations enacted by the powers to whom the shore belongs. A supplementary convention was signed at The Hague on November 16, 1887 among the same High Contracting Parties, relating to the liquor traffic in the North Sea. It applies to the area set out in article 4 of the Convention of IV May 6, 1882, and forbids the sale of spirituous liquors within it to persons on board fishing vessels. A reciprocal right of visit and search is granted under this convention to the cruisers entrusted with carrying out of its provisions.

They are usually analysed by division into the following categories: *Fatal offences *Sexual offences *Non-fatal non-sexual offences They can be further analysed by division into: *Assaults *Injuries And it is then possible to consider degrees and aggravations, and distinguish between intentional actions (e.g., assault) and criminal negligence (e.g., criminal endangerment). Offences against the person are usually taken to comprise: *Fatal offences Murder Manslaughter *Non-fatal non-sexual offences  Assault, or common assault  Battery, or common battery  Wounding or wounding with intent  PoisoningOften referred to as administration of a noxious substance in legal parlance.  Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (and derivative offences)  Inflicting grievous bodily harm or causing grievous bodily harm with intent (and derivative offences)Some legal systems have two separate crimes: occasioning grievous bodily harm, and intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm. The crimes are usually grouped together in common law countries as a legacy of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. Although most sexual offences will also be offences against the person,For example, it would be legally impossible to rape another person without also committing a battery against them for various reasons (including sentencing and registration of offenders) sexual crimes are usually categorised separately.

The Roman Empire had reached the Danube as early as 14 AD, when the commander Aelius Catus conducted an expedition beyond the river in order to keep away the restless Dacians and their new allies, the Sarmatians. But the legions deployed their troops only up to Durostorum, as modern northern Dobruja was left to the forces of the kings of the Sapaei, the allies of the Romans, helped by the forces commanded by a Praefectus orae maritimae (commander of the seashore). There has been some debate both on the identity of Aelius Catus and on the date of this action. Some historians identified Aelius Catus with Sextus Aelius Catus, a consul in 4 AD.

Johnson, D.V.M. and Richard E. Hess, Weatherhill, Shambala Publications, Inc., 2006. - Its body is round and similar to a golf ball. The finnage may be long or short. Pearlscales can reach up to 8 inches long and grow up as large as an orange. Pearlscale goldfish are susceptible to swimbladder disorders which affect the ability to maintain normal position in the water. This is attributed to the selective breeding process of fancy goldfish to achieve particular body forms, such as that of the Pearlscale's roundness, which results in the alteration of the appearance of the shape and function of the swimbladder. The Pearlscale can also known as the Ping Pong Pearlscale and Golfball Pearlscale. = Breed standard = The Pearlscale standard is as follows: * Depth of body to be greater than 2/3 of body length * Scales to be domed * Dorsal fin to be single, all other fins to be paired * Caudal fin to be divided and forked and held above the horizontal * Extremities of fins to have a slightly rounded appearance * Minimum length of body to be 5.5 cm (2¬º inches) The fish should be bright and alert and displaying well developed domed scales all over the body area. The body should be short and rounded (not elongated). The caudal fin should be held high without signs of drooping and well divided. Quality fish will have high color intensity extending into the fins.Article on Pearlscale Goldfish from bristol-aquarists.com File:Pearlscale.jpgOrange and white fancy Pearlscale goldfish File:Ping pong pearlscale.JPGPearlscale before wen and domed scales have developed File:Large Pearlscale Goldfish.jpgPearlscale goldfish in a hand Coloration Pearlscales come in every fancy goldfish color variety. The color may be metallic (ideally self- colored or variegated in a pleasing pattern and similar on each side), orange or calico. The Pearlscale may also be fully black in color. Metallic colors should appear as burnished metal, extending into the fins. Calico fish should have a blue background with patches of violet, red, orange, yellow and brown, spotted with black. alt= Variants Pearlscales are found without headgrowth (wen), with Oranda-like headgrowth, or with two large bubble domes. The bubble-domed Pearlscales are known as High-head Pearlscale, Crown Pearlscale or Hama Nishiki. Special requirements Like many fancy goldfish, Pearlscales are egg-shaped with internal organs crowded in a compacted body, therefore overfeeding should be avoided. Pearlscales are very sensitive to cold water and should not be exposed to temperatures below 55¬∞F (13¬∞C). They are also quite vulnerable to pH changes and should not be exposed for long periods to overly acidic or alkaline environments.

The song is sung by the character of Marcellus Washburn, a friend of con man \\"Professor\\" Harold Hill. It occurs in act 2 of the play during the dance committee's rehearsal which the town kids interrupt. The dialogue surrounding the song does not explain the meaning of the term shipoopi, which Willson said that he invented for the song. When the high school kids want to dance, Marcellus asks which song they want to hear; Tommy Djilas replies \\"The Shipoopi\\", which seems to indicate that \\"shipoopi\\" is a dance. The chorus implies that it means a \\"girl who's hard to get\\", and the first stanza says a woman who waits until the third date to kiss is \\"your shipoopi\\". In the original 1957 Broadway production, the song was performed by actor Iggie Wolfington, who portrayed Marcellus Washburn. In the 1962 film version of The Music Man, Marcellus is played by Buddy Hackett. According to the film documentary included with the extended DVD release, choreographer Onna White was able to take Hackett, not known as a dancer, and make him into a dancer for this number. In popular culture *In \\"Patriot Games\\", the 20th episode of the fourth season of the animated TV series Family Guy, Peter Griffin leads the crowd in a full rendition of \\"Shipoopi\\" after he scores a touchdown as a member of the New England Patriots football team. *In the TV series LateLine, the song was featured in an episode about a false report of the death of Buddy Hackett. *Vern Fonk, an auto insurance provider in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, known for off-color and humorous commercials, uses the phrase shipoopi in his commercial \\"Dance\\".

Its local government area is the City of Greater Bendigo. At the 2016 Census, Golden Square had a population of 8,820. History Gold was discovered in the bed of the Bendigo Creek in the spring of 1851, about 200 metres from where the Golden Square Hotel now stands, sparking the gold rush that established the Australian city of Bendigo. Two women, Mrs Kennedy and Mrs Farrell, are commonly credited with having made the discovery.Historical marker on west bank of the Bendigo Creek, Wade Street, Bendigo The Post Office opened on 10 January 1863. The local swimming pool was built in 1918 originally called the Golden Square Baths, later renamed to Golden Square Swimming Pool. Today Golden Square is home to The Bulldogs Football and Netball Team competing in the Bendigo Football League, Golden Square Secondary College (which has since been closed), Golden Square Primary School, (Laurel Street Primary School) Maple Street Primary School and the Golden Square Shopping Centre.

The first issue of the series was called Evroniani, and featured Paperinik's new alien enemies, the Evronians. Introduced in the same issue were Paperinik's two new allies, the A.I. Uno (One), who resides in the skyscraper Ducklair Tower, and Lyla Lay, a journalist and robot utilized by a time police organization based in the 23rd century. The series was extremely well received at the beginning of its run, and saluted as an unexpectedly innovative project for Disney. In 2016, IDW Publishing announced plans to start publishing an official English translation of the series written by Jonathan Gray under the title \\"Duck Avenger\\".http://www.previewsworld.com/Catalog/JUN160503 Themes The PKNA writers developed more adult themes than the classical Disney stories published in the Italian magazine Topolino. Throughout the series' run, they used themes such as: the relationship between man and robot; the struggle between what is right and what is logical; the essence of true love; the difference between mankind and other alien races; the essence of being a superhero; the relationship between knowledge and power; the importance of History and past historical events. Among the writers of the Pk Team, were many talented and generally young authors: Francesco Artibani, Davide Catenacci, Gianfranco Cordara, Bruno Enna, Tito Faraci, Augusto Macchetto, Alessandro Sisti, Simone Stenti, Ezio Sisto. The PK project was seen as a testbed for a generation of new authors, who were given ample freedom to innovate, leaving behind many of the typical storytelling conventions of the company and creating a blend of the \\"classical\\" Disney comics and the American superhero comic books, which were a primary and acknowledged source of inspiration. Despite this, both the company and the public were deeply used to Disney characters being used for kid-friendly stories, so that a slow transition towards edgier storytelling and graphic depictions was required. Especially in the first issues, there is a contrast between the harsh themes hinted at or explicitly introduced by the narrative and the depicted events. It is made clear since the beginning that the Evron empire has depopulated a number of worlds, killing or enslaving billions of intelligent aliens, and a main character clearly announces to have sworn to destroy the entire Evronian race in revenge: but the fights with the Evronians mostly feature the usual Disney slapstick violence, with no graphic depictions of any hero killing or realistically wounding an enemy (while entire starships could be destroyed in the background). Despite this, the Italian readers didn't decry the restraint but were content with scenes they deemed already audacious for a conservative comics company like Disney. The character of Paperinik was firmly based in the established Topolino continuity as the superheroic secret identity that Donald Duck had already assumed long before the start of the series: but connections with the \\"classic\\" Paperinik stories was cut short since the first number, giving Donald completely new allies, weaponry and occupations. The appearances of the other Disney Club characters was reduced to a minimum, and many of them (like Gyro Gearloose and Huey, Dewey & Louie) were written off the story even if they were featured prominently in the previous Paperinik adventures. This reinforced the notion that PK was meant to be a \\"real superhero\\", existing in its own world, related to but fundamentally different from the mostly parodic and humorous Paperinik. Short stories PKNA is also famous for its short side-stories that follow the main story in most issues. All of those short stories are more artistic than the regular main story. =Angus Tales= The first series of short 8-page stories are Angus Tales and the main character is Angus Fangus. This series consist of 7 stories. All of those stories where mostly colored with yellow, orange, brown, gray and black ink, giving it a little \\"vanishing\\" atmosphere. The plot of those stories is usually about how Angus gets into trouble (there is usually a gangster or more involved), and how he gets out of it. All of the stories is drawn by Silvia Ziche. =Arriva Trip (Trip incoming)= The second series of the short 8-page stories are about Trip, Razziatore's (Raider) son. This is the first of two series about Trip. The plot of this series is to introduce Trip. =Starring the great Burton La Valle= The third series is of 8-page short stories is \\"Starring the great Burton La Valle\\". Burton La Valle is an actor from the 23rd century, and those stories is about Burton and what he does at work. This series is also experimenting with different styles of art. This series is one of the more artistic/experimental of all the short story series. =Vedi alla voce Evron (See under Evron)= The fourth series is about Evronians, and it's named \\"Evron - Extracts from the infoguide\\". There is not really a story or plot in this series, but the series gives information about the Evronian empire in an illustrated way. =5Y= The fifth series of the 8 page stories is about the Class 5Y Droid; Lyla Lay. Some of the stories are about some of her minor problems, and the rest of them is about her normal life. =Io sono Xadhoom (I am Xadhoom)= The sixth series of short stories somewhat differ from the other series (except the third one) with the fact that there is no black outlines between different colored objects. Those short stories are about short happenings in Xadhoom life. =Fuori... onda (Off... the air)= The seventh series of short stories is about \\"Behind the screens\\" at Chanel 00. =Trip's strip= The eighth series of short stories is the second series about Trip. This series is introduced by the short story of issue #34, what is a side story of the main story in I PKNA #34. In this series, Trip has to draw its own super-hero comic, and he ends up with a character named \\"Time-Boy\\". Time-Boy is Trips Alter-Ego. =Lo zen e la fisica dei quanti (Zen and quantum physics)= The ninth series is the last series of 8 page stories. This series is about Everett Ducklair's normal life at a monastery in Tibet. The Art of PKNA *PKNA represented a change from the classic Disney comics style, such as Italian Topolino. The format of each PKNA issue was bigger and similar to that of American comics. The size and the order of the panels break the traditional six panels order, alternating splash pages, longer or flattered panels. Strong colorization, with monochromatic panel, is used to mark emotional moments or action. Inspiration also comes from Japanese manga and American comics, with the use of kinetic lines, eyes representation, and muscular characters drawn in an oblique way in the panels. *The comic was a showcase for the talent of so many young, at the time, comic artists: Graziano Barbaro, Alessandro Barbucci, Fabio Celoni, Andrea Ferraris, Andrea Freccero, Francesco Guerrini, Ettore Gula, Stefano Intini, Alberto Lavoradori, Corrado Mastantuono, Paolo Mottura, Lorenzo Pastrovicchio, Manuela Razzi, Claudio Sciarrone, Stefano Turconi, Silvia Ziche and many others. They were almost all scholars of the great Giovan Battista Carpi. *PKNA, with its revolutionary style, set the basis for other great Disney comics, such as MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine, W.I.T.C.H., Monster Allergy and many others. *There are several quotes from famous books or movies, such as Blade Runner. End of PKNA Due to a decrease in sales, together with a lack of fresh ideas and many continuity errors, the authors believed that it was better to end the series. After issue #30, some short arcs were created, focusing on Xadhoom, Razziatore (Raider), Lila Lay, Due (Two) and other characters to finish their stories. The last issue is a double issue, in which Everett Ducklair appears, in the Dhasam-Bul monastery, with a Book of Destiny. He changes past events to create several new timelines, but all of them create new problems so he ends up restoring the original timeline. The following series, PK2, got a mixed response from fans.

History Blankenburg Castle, seat of the Bernese administrator 1386-1798 Ruins of the Lower Mannenberg Castle Zweisimmen is first mentioned in 1228 as Duessimenes. In 1257 it was mentioned as Zweinlixhenun. The oldest trace of a settlement in the area are some scattered mesolithic artifacts from Mannenberg-Riedli. The remains of a Roman era settlement were found at Mannried. During the Middle Ages a significant trade route over the Alps to Valais and Lake Geneva passed through the Zweisimmen region. A number of farming villages probably existed in the area during the Middle Ages. In the 13th and 14th centuries, local nobles built several castles, Upper Mannenberg and Lower Mannenberg, Reichenstein- Terenstein, Blankenburg and Steinegg Castles, to protect and collect taxes from the roads. The villages and castles passed through several noble families until 1378 when the Lord of D√ºdingen sold the lands to Fribourg following an uprising. After the Battle of Sempach in 1386, Bern conquered the Simmen river valley (Simmental) and acquired Zweisimmen. The Bernese administrator over the upper Simmen valley was installed at Blankenburg Castle. Reichenstein- Terenstein Castle and estates were acquired by the Bubenberg family in 1456, and sold to Bern in 1493. Blankenburg village remained the political center of the Obersimmental district through the 1798 French invasion and the Act of Mediation in 1803. It remained the capital until the district was dissolved in 2009. The village St. Mary's Church was probably built in the Early or High Middle Ages. It first appears in a historical record in 1228. It was rebuilt and expanded several times in the 13th to 15th centuries. The murals and stained glass date from the same period. The carved wooden ceiling was added around 1456. An ossuary was built under the church in 1481. In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and spread it throughout its land. Zweisimmen, along with much of the Bernese Oberland initially resisted the new faith, but were forced to convert in the same year. The church was secularized and used for storage and meetings. In 1866 it became the Blankenburg village school. During the Middle Ages Zweisimmen grew into a local center for trade and government. In 1644 the annual fair was moved to Zweisimmen and brought cattle and cheese buyers from Italy and Germany to the municipality. In the 1750s a trade route from Thun to Montreux was built into Zweisimmen. The Simmental road was built from Saanen into the Simmen valley in 1816-45. The new road brought additional trade and eventually tourists to the municipality. A hotel was built in 1881. The completion of the Spiez- Zweisimmen-Montreux railroad in 1905 opened the villages up to many additional tourists. The hotel became a spa and resort in 1912 and included winter sports in 1920. The municipal tourism industry was devastated by the Great Depression and World War II. However, it began to recover in the 1950s with many new cable cars and ski lifts. Zweisimmen cooperated with the neighboring tourist municipalities of Gstaad, Lenk im Simmental and Adelboden to build extensive ski resorts along with an airfield. A regional hospital opened in 1908 and today provides a number of jobs. A federal armory operated in the village until 2002. One of the major employers in the municipality is the Center Air Defence facility of RUAG Aviation which maintains and develops air defense systems for the Swiss military.

The hotel was built in 1929 by the Farrell Hotel Company at an approximate cost of $1,000,000. It was designed by architect Eugene John Stern in the Italian-Spanish Revival style. The two main wings are eight stories each, and extend out towards Scott Street. These two wings are connected across the back by a ten-story cross section. Decorated stone pediments extend above the roof line in the center of each wing. The cloister type porch graces the main entries which are flanked by triple arched leaded-glass windows. Above the entries are terra cotta medallions featuring heraldic shields with the initials \\"AP\\". The elaborate decor includes detailed stenciling, leaded and stained glass windows, extensive decorative tile, iron work, and ornate light fixtures. The coffered ceiling in the two story main lobby is overlooked by an open mezzanine floor that contains fine antique furnishings, including a custom made Hazelton Bros. grand piano, designed to match the building's interior structural features. The hotel is named after one of Arkansas' leading historical figures, Albert Pike, a teacher, attorney, newspaperman, Confederate Brigadier General, and later a judge of the Arkansas Supreme Court. Pike was also a prominent member of the Freemasons, and his writings were officially embraced by the Scottish Rite appendant branch of that fraternity throughout much of the U.S. The building was a hotel from its construction in 1928 (opening in 1929) until December 1971, when the Second Baptist Church assumed ownership and began its Albert Pike Residence Hotel ministry. The purpose was to provide a family retirement community that was happy and uplifting. In 1976 the hotel secured a Section 231 loan for $2,400,000 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This made possible the renovation of the hotel infrastructure bringing it up to current fire and safety standards. The Albert Pike Hotel was entered into the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior in 1978. A grant from the Historical Preservation Society helped to restore the public and community areas to their original condition. In late 1985, the hotel was purchased by a privately held corporation in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Since that time continuous upgrades, such as the addition of kitchen facilities, were made in efficiency, one, and two bedroom apartments. The apartments were created where two hotel rooms had connecting doors. Non connecting rooms are studio apartments with microwave-refrigerator combo units. The North Lounge was restored in 1994 and was made a smoke-free environment. It provides a common activities room, television lounge, post office boxes, and library. Regular events are held to inform residents of health and community services available in the area, as well as weekly bingo, monthly birthday parties, and special occasion and holiday parties.

The film is based on Jay Anson's 1977 book of the same name. The story is based on the alleged experiences of the Lutz family who bought a new home in Amityville, New York, where a mass murder had been committed the year before. It is the first film based on the Amityville horror. Upon its release in the summer of 1979, The Amityville Horror was a major commercial success for American International Pictures, grossing over $80 million in the United States and going on to become one of the highest-grossing independent films of all time. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, though some film scholars have considered it a classic of the horror genre. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score by composer Lalo Schifrin and Kidder also earned a Saturn Award nomination for Best Actress. A remake was produced in 2005. Plot In the early morning hours on November 13, 1974, Ronald DeFeo Jr. murders his entire family with a shotgun at their home in Amityville, New York. One year later, George and Kathy Lutz, a young married couple, move into the property. George appears not to be strong of faith, but Kathy is a Catholic in name at least. She has three children from her prior marriage: Greg, Matt, and Amy. The couple turn to Father Delaney to quickly bless the home, but Delaney encounters troubles in trying to bless the home, including a room full of flies, out of season; violent stomach sickness; and later, blisters on his palm when trying to make a phone call to Kathy at their home. The experience eventually stops when a door is opened, then a voice whispers \\"get out\\". He rushes out of the house when the voice yells at him, and he decides to continue helping the Lutz family. Delaney is later involved in a car accident resulting from mysterious malfunctions, and he becomes frustrated at the lack of support from his superiors in the diocese. He ultimately appears to lose faith, becoming blind and having a breakdown. Kathy's aunt, a nun, comes by the house one afternoon, but becomes violently ill. George begins to be more sullen and angry over perceived cold in the house, and obsesses with splitting logs and keeping the fireplace stoked. Before Kathy's brother's engagement party one night, $1,500 to be used for the caterer inexplicably goes missing in the house. Meanwhile, the babysitter watching Amy for the evening is locked inside a bedroom closet by an unseen force. Further unexplained incidents occur with one of the two boys suffers a crushed hand when a sash window falls on it, and Amy having an imaginary friend, Jody, who seems to be of a malevolent nature. Kathy catches a glimpse of two red, swine-like eyes outside the daughter's second-story bedroom window. Even the family dog, Harry, obsesses over a secret room in the basement. George's land surveying business begins to suffer with his lack of attendance, and his partner grows concerned. His business partner's wife, very sensitive to the paranormal, is both repulsed and intrigued by the things she feels when at the house. While in the basement of the house, Carolyn begins demolishing a wall with a hammer, revealing a small room behind the wall. Discovering the damage, George takes down the rest of the wall, observing a small room with red walls. Carolyn, in terror, shrieks that they have found \\"the passage... to hell!\\" ‚Äì only her voice now sounds like Father Delaney's voice. Throughout the strange incidents, Kathy observes George's persistent waking up at 3:15 a.m., feeling he must go check on the boathouse. She also has nightmares, in which she is given details about the killings of the home's prior family. Research at the library and county records office suggest that the house is built atop a Shinnecock burial ground and that a known Satanic worshipper named John Ketchum had once lived on the land. She also discovers the news clippings about the DeFeo murders and notices Ronald DeFeo's striking resemblance to George. Finally, the paranormal events culminate one stormy night. Blood oozes from the walls and down the staircase; Jody, appearing as a large, red-eyed pig, is seen through a window; and George attempts to kill the children with an axe, but regains his wits after Kathy disrupts him. After falling through the basement stairs into a pit of black sludge while rescuing Harry, George and the rest of the family drive away, abandoning their home and belongings. A final intertitle reads: \\"George and Kathleen Lutz and their family never reclaimed their house or their personal belongings. Today they live in another state.\\" CastProduction=Conception= Producer Samuel Z. Arkoff purchased the rights to the Anson novel by Jay Anson, which was a commercial success upon its publication in 1977. Anson himself wrote a screenplay based on his work, but the script was rejected by Arkoff, and screenwriter Sandor Stern was assigned to write an entirely new script. Initially, the film had been conceived as a made-for-television film. =Casting= The house exteriors were shot at a home in Toms River, New Jersey after public officials refused to allow filming at the real home (pictured here). Brolin was hesitant when first offered the role of George Lutz. At the time of his casting, the script was unfinished, and so Brolin obtained a copy of Anson's novel to read. Brolin started the book and read until two o'clock in the morning. He had hung up a pair of his pants in the room earlier and during an especially tense passage of the book, the pants fell to the floor. Brolin jumped from his chair in fright. It was then that Brolin decided to do the film, convinced that the material would make an effective film. Kidder was cast in the role of Kathy Lutz after her breakthrough performance as Lois Lane in Superman the year prior. =Filming= The on-location scenes of The Amityville Horror were filmed at a private residence in Toms River, New Jersey, which had been converted to look like the 112 Ocean Avenue home after authorities in Amityville denied permission for filming on the actual location. Exterior scenes were also filmed in Toms River and Point Pleasant Beach. Local police and ambulance workers would play extras in the film, while the Toms River Volunteer Fire Company was used to provide the rain during several scenes. Indoor shots were filmed at the MGM studio lot in Los Angeles, California. The film shoot was widely publicized in national media when the studio attempted to concoct stories of \\"unusual\\" occurrences on the set (not dissimilar from what was claimed to have occurred during the filming of The Exorcist). According to Brolin, he and Kidder were both asked by the studio and the press, \\"'Is there weird stuff going on?'... and we were looking for stuff now. We'd have liked to tell them, 'Oh yeah, you wouldn't believe the stuff that happened yesterday‚Äîmy lunch fell off the table in my lap.'\\" =Music= Lalo Schifrin's score for The Amityville Horror was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score, but lost out to the score for A Little Romance by Georges Delerue. It is sometimes claimed that this score was the one rejected in 1973 for The Exorcist, but Schifrin has denied this in interviews. Release The Amityville Horror had an invitational premiere at the Museum of Modern Art in New York on July 24 and was released in Los Angeles and New York on July 27, 1979. =Publicity and promotion= In promotion for the film's premiere, stars James Brolin and Margot Kidder visited the actual home at 112 Ocean Avenue, accompanied by the press. Brolin would later reflect that the actual home was much more \\"condensed\\" than the location where the film was shot. Both Brolin and Kidder were skeptics of the claims made in the book; \\"I didn't buy that this really had happened,\\" Kidder would say in a 2005 interview. During the press junkets promoting the film, when asked whether she believed the Lutzes' claims, Kidder purportedly turned to the producers, who responded: \\"We'll never tell.\\" =Reception= The Amityville Horror premiered in the United States on July 27, 1979. It was one of the most successful films produced by an independent studio at the time and was the most profitable AIP release since The Born Losers (1968). The film opened in 748 theatres, grossing $7,843,467 for the weekend. It grossed over $13.3 million for the week from 810 theatres, the second best opening week of the year (to that date) after Moonraker's $14.7 million and AIP's largest ever. The film grossed a total of $86,432,520 at the U.S. and Canadian box office, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1979. It was the highest-grossing independent film of all time until 1990, when it was surpassed by Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In his review at the time, Roger Ebert described the film as \\"dreary and terminally depressing\\". An anonymous review in People said Rod Steiger was overacting and that the film was \\"ridiculous.\\" Tim Pulleine of the Monthly Film Bulletin declared that the film \\"proves the most satisfying excursion into no-frills spine-chilling for some time.\\" and that \\"The film is constantly well played and provides Rod Steiger with his best opportunity in ages for all-stops-out bravura.\\" The film resulted in several lawsuits. From a retrospective review historian James F. Broderick praised it, writing: \\"Director Stuart Rosenberg crafted an effective horror movie that succeeds largely because the performers take the over-the-top material seriously... The film is taut, tense, and filled with the bizarre, unsettling events chronicled in the book.\\" In a 2013 assessment, John Kenneth Muir called The Amityville Horror a \\"blunt and effective horror film,\\" also noting author Stephen King's analysis of the film's subtext revolving around financial turmoil among the family: \\"If one follows King's lead, it's easy to contextualize The Amityville Horror as a financial nightmare... Similarly, the movie's dialogue constantly references financial matters. \\"Bills have to be paid,\\" says one character. \\"The IRS is calling,\\" warns another. 'They'll nickel and dime you to death\\" is a mantra not just about the bill collectors, perhaps, but a warning about the demons in the house.\\" Accolades *Nominated - Academy Award for Best Original Score (Lalo Schifrin) *Nominated - Saturn Award for Best Actress (Margot Kidder) *Nominated - Saturn Award for Best Horror Film See also * List of ghost films NotesReferencesWorks cited   * External links   Category:Amityville Horror films Category:1979 films Category:1979 horror films Category:1979 independent films Category:1970s psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:American haunted house films Category:American independent films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:American International Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Lalo Schifrin Category:Films based on horror novels Category:Films directed by Stuart Rosenberg Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:Films set in 1974 Category:Films set in 1975 Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Horror films based on actual events Category:Religious horror films Category:1970s supernatural horror films Category:American supernatural films ","title":"The Amityville Horror (1979 film)"},{"id":"3954920","title":"Khan Na Yao District"},{"id":"3954921","text":"Duncraig Senior High School is an independent public co-educational high day school, located in the suburb of Duncraig, north of Perth, Western Australia. The current principal is Peter Lilywhite.  History  The school opened in 1979 with 850 students from various primary schools in the surrounding area. It currently has an average of 1642 students. The opening of Padbury Senior High School in 1987 reduced the number of contributing primary schools. At the closure of Craigie Senior High School in 2004 Duncraig took in year nine and ten students belonging to Craigie's Academic Talent Program.

History The original Sphere Books was launched in 1966 by Thomson Corporation. Sphere was sold to Pearson PLC in 1985 and became part of Penguin. The name was retired in 1990. In 1976, Sphere paid $225,000 for the British publishing rights from Ballantine Books for the novelisation of a forthcoming science fiction film, Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker by George Lucas (ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster). The book, like the film Star Wars released the following year, was an enormous success and sold out its initial print run. Sphere also published the UK editions of Conan fantasy series by Robert E. Howard. The occult writer Dennis Wheatley edited a series of books published under the umbrella title of The Dennis Wheatley Library of the Occult, which included titles such as Dracula by Bram Stoker, Moonchild by Aleister Crowley, Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Sphere's involvement in science fiction was furthered with its Sphere Science Fiction Classics series published throughout the 1970s, which included The World of Null-A and The Pawns of Null-A by A. E. van Vogt, Arthur C. Clarke's The Sands of Mars and Larry Niven's Neutron Star.

Its plot follows a woman who, having committed a double-murder of her husband and his lover decades prior, is suspected of a series of axe murders following her release. Released by Columbia Pictures in January 1964, the film was the first of two written for Castle by Robert Bloch, the second being The Night Walker (1964). Strait-Jacket marks the first big-screen appearance of Lee Majors in the uncredited role of Crawford's husband. The film's plot makes use of the psychological abuse method known as gaslighting. Plot After finding her husband asleep in bed with his mistress, Lucy Harbin decapitates them both with an axe. Her three-year-old daughter, Carol, witnesses the murders. Lucy is committed to a psychiatric hospital and deemed criminally insane. Twenty years later, after she is found to be mentally sound and reformed, Lucy is released from the institution. She takes up residence at the farm of her brother Bill Cutler and sister-in-law Emily. Carol, now an artist and sculptor, also lives on the farm, having been adopted by the Cutlers after Lucy was committed. Carol swiftly makes attempts to bond with Lucy, encouraging her to dress and act the way she did in the past. When Carol attempts to introduce her wealthy fianc√©, Michael Fields, however, Lucy is evasive. Lucy's stress is compounded by apparent auditory hallucinations in which she hears children singing a nursery rhyme comparing her to Lizzie Borden, as well as disturbing nightmares in which she finds herself lying in bed with her husband and his lover's severed heads. Lucy eventually meets Michael at a dinner party, and Carol is angered when Lucy is overtly flirtatious with him. When Lucy has a subsequent emotional breakdown, her sanity is questioned by Dr. Anderson, the psychologist following her. Later that night, Dr. Anderson is brutally murdered and dismembered in the Cutlers' barn after visiting with Carol to discuss Lucy's mental health. When Dr. Anderson is reported missing, Carol hides his car on the farm, as Lucy fears she may have killed him during a blackout episode. Leo, the handyman on the Cutler farm, witnesses Carol hiding the car, and subsequently takes it for himself, threatening Carol with blackmail. He is subsequently decapitated in the barn. Lucy and Carol visit Michael's parents' home for a dinner, during which Lucy is harshly judged by Michael's mother, Allison, who believes Carol is of a low class and is not fit to marry into the family. This results in a confrontation, after which Lucy storms out of the house in a rage. She is pursued by Carol and Michael, leaving Michael's parents alone at their home. Michael's father, Raymond, is butchered by the killer while alone in his closet. Allison is subsequently confronted by the killer upstairs, donning a latex mask and dressed like Lucy‚Äîat this moment, Lucy herself also enters the room, having returned to the house. Lucy fights with the killer, removing the mask and revealing the murderer as Carol, who has been impersonating Lucy while committing the murders. Michael appears, and Carol admits to the killings, which were driven by a love-hate relationship with her mother. Carol hoped to murder Michael's parents and frame Lucy for the crimes, effectively allowing her to marry Michael. Some time later, Lucy, accepting responsibility for her daughter's mental illness and hatred, looks on at various props Carol created in an attempt to drive her mad, including a tape-recorded nursery rhyme, and fake severed heads she sculpted and placed in Lucy's bed. Lucy departs to visit Carol in the psychiatric hospital where she is now confined. CastProduction=Development= After the success of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962), Joan Crawford and other older actresses, including Bette Davis and Barbara Stanwyck, made numerous horror movies throughout the 1960s. Strait-Jacket is one of the more notable examples of the genre sometimes referred to as psycho-biddy or Grande Dame Guignol. =Casting= Crawford replaced Joan Blondell in the role of Lucy Harbin after Blondell was injured at home prior to shooting and could not fulfill her commitment. Crawford's negotiations included script and cast approval, a $50,000 salary, and 15 percent of the profits. Anne Helm, who was originally cast in the role as Carol, was replaced by Diane Baker, reportedly at Crawford's insistence. Baker and Crawford had appeared together in the film The Best of Everything (1959). Baker asserted that the original actress for her part, Anne Helm, had numerous problems with Crawford. According to Baker, Crawford said, \\"it wasn't working out, her timing was off, she wasn't getting it, she wasn't seeing eye-to-eye, or she wasn't working the way Crawford wanted to work\\" on the 'making-of' featurette on the DVD of the film.Battle Axe: The Making of Straight-Jacket, documentary, √ß2002, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment DVD =Promotion= During the film's original release, moviegoers were given little cardboard axes as they entered the theater. At the end of the closing credits, the Columbia logo's torch-bearing woman is shown in her traditional pose, but decapitated, with her head resting at her feet on her pedestal. Reception Critics disliked the film but praised Crawford's performance, the general critical consensus being that she was better than the material. Variety noted, \\"Miss Crawford does well by her role, delivering an animated performance.\\" Judith Crist commented in the New York Herald Tribune that \\"it's time to get Joan Crawford out of those housedress horror B movies and back into haute couture ... this madness-and-murder tale ... might have been a thriller, given Class A treatment.\\" Elaine Rothschild in Films in Review wrote, \\"I am full of admiration for Joan Crawford, for even in drek like this she gives a performance.\\"Lawrence J. Quirk, The Films of Joan Crawford (The Citadel Press, 1968) Bosley Crowther, however, wrote a scathing review of both the film and Crawford's performance in The New York Times, declaring, \\"Joan Crawford has picked some lemons, some very sour lemons, in her day, but nigh the worst of the lot is \\"Strait-Jacket\\". He goes on to call the film a \\"disgusting piece of claptrap.\\"Bosley Crowther, The New York Times (January 23, 1964) Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post also hated the film, calling it \\"likely to stand as the worst picture of the year ... Apart from the absurdity of the plot and the chilling predictability of lines and situations, 'Strait-Jacket' is inexcusable for its scenes of violence.\\" The film has reasonably high reviews on the Internet Movie Database, with a score of 6.8 out of 10, based on 3,706 votes (February 2018). The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

It was originally proclaimed as the Government Town of Tregu on July 2, 1891 but the name was changed to Nackara in 1940 to match the name of the railway station. History The Nackara 'township' was created as a railway siding on the Peterborough (South Australia) to Broken Hill (New South Wales) train line which was completed in approximately 1888, mainly to transport the ore from the Broken Hill mines to the South Australian port(s). The town was planned to have several streets with suburban style yards, however this never eventuated. The Nackara township never consisted of more than a few railway cottages, a town store/post office (part of a house), a community hall ('The Nackara Institute'), a Catholic church, a Presbyterian Church, a school, the railway platform, cattle yards and cemetery. The planned roads didn't ever eventuate, with only dirt tracks through the very dry paddocks. The community consisted of families from the surrounding grazing land, and the railway workers. While the township never grew as planned, the community did have many social events such as picnics, town dances and concerts, annual horse races, and car races. The town also competed against the other local towns in at least rugby and cricket. The local population were mainly immigrants (many Catholics from Ireland and several Polish families), and mainly worked as sheep and cattle graziers, railway workers, wood carters, shearers and labourers. There was a vibrant local Catholic community who had annual Catholic Picnics to raise money to erect a Catholic church. The church (St. Patrick's) was a small church built of stone on the top of the hill overlooking the Nackara township. Current The area is too dry to support much livestock, so Nackara never grew beyond around 20 families and the township didn't develop. After the railway was realigned several kilometres to the south around the 1960s, the town practically died. There are only several graziers left in the area now. Nackara School and the disused Nackara Institute (community hall) are all that remain standing within the Nackara township. The school is now a private residence. The (corrugated iron) Presbyterian church has gone, the Catholic Church was demolished (around the 1960s), the main store (home and post office) is now stone rubble with a chimney.

The once extensive megalithic site at Le Crocq now consists mainly of two menhirs, although the hedge boundaries in the area contain many of the stones from the destruction of the monument a couple of hundred years previously. At Le Catioroc again there is a lot less than historically; this area featuring more than any other in the witchcraft trials of the 16th and 17th century and appears to have suffered some deliberate destruction, though Le Trepied Dolmen remains.

The square was inaugurated when Gothenburg held a major international industrial exhibition, 1923, celebrating the city's 300th anniversary. G√∂taplatsen is Gothenburg's cultural hub, enclosed by the Gothenburg Concert Hall (where the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra resides), the Gothenburg Museum of Art, the Gothenburg City Theatre and the City Library. At the centre of the square presides the Poseidon statue by Carl Milles‚Äîthe statue has become one of the symbols of the city. On the city's annual culture festival different Swedish musical artists usually perform free at the square, bands like Hardcore Superstar, Mustasch and Teddybears have all performed at this occasion.  History  G√∂taplatsen got its name in 1914, but until 1923 the area was strictly rural. G√∂taplatsen was designed by the architects Sigfrid Ericson and Arvid Bjerke and construction began in 1921. The Gothenburg Museum of Art was completed just in time before Gothenburg‚Äôs 300th anniversary in 1923, the Gothenburg Exhibition. Much of the southern part of G√∂taplatsen is terraced in stone with wide stairs leading up to the Gothenburg Museum of Art's seven high arches. Until the 1980s, the museum of art¬¥s entrance was positioned at the top of the archway. Today however, the entrance has been moved a number of levels further down, closer to the street level, where the Hasselblad Centre is also located. Across the gallery, which is located as a side-house to the Gothenburg Museum of Art at G√∂taplatsen‚Äôs southeastern corner, stood a triumphal arch which was the entrance to the exhibition area during the Gothenburg Exhibition. This triumphal arch was demolished in 1928. In 24 September 1931 the statue Poseidon was inaugurated. The Gothenburg City Theatre was opened on 29 September 1934. The following year, in 1935, the Gothenburg Concert Hall was built on the other side of G√∂taplatsen. In 1967 the Gothenburg Public Library was opened.

Ostensibly a biopic, based on the life of Franz Kafka, the film blurs the lines between fact and Kafka's fiction (most notably The Castle and The Trial), creating a Kafkaesque atmosphere. It was written by Lem Dobbs, and stars Jeremy Irons in the title role, with Theresa Russell, Ian Holm, Jeroen Krabb√©, Joel Grey, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Alec Guinness. Released after Soderbergh's critically acclaimed debut Sex, Lies, and Videotape it was the first of what would be a series of low-budget box-office disappointments. It has since become a cult film, being compared to Terry Gilliam's Brazil and David Cronenberg's Naked Lunch.  Plot Set in the city of Prague in 1919, Kafka tells the tale of an insurance clerk who gets involved with an underground group after one of his co-workers is murdered. The underground group, responsible for bombings all over town, attempts to thwart a secret organization that controls the major events in society. He eventually penetrates the secret organization in order to confront them.

Alternate version In a 2013 interview with Vulture, Soderbergh stated that the rights to the film had reverted to him and executive producer Paul Rassam, and that work had begun on a \\"completely different\\" version of the movie. Soderbergh reported that he and Lem Dobbs did some rewriting, inserts were shot during the making of Side Effects, and he plans to dub the film into German and release both the original and new version together.

They were founded by singer-songwriter Sean O'Hagan, formerly of Microdisney, with drummer Rob Allum and ex-Microdisney bassist Jon Fell. O'Hagan has led the group since its formation. Their music is often compared to the Beach Boys, a band he acknowledges as an influence, although more prominent influences were drawn from bossa nova and European film soundtracks. O'Hagan formed the High Llamas after the breakup of his group Microdisney. The band initially played in a more conventional acoustic pop style, but after he joined Stereolab as a keyboardist, he was inspired to revamp the group's music closer to the electronic and orchestral sound he preferred. Their second album, Gideon Gaye (1994), anticipated the mid 1990s easy-listening revivalist movement, and its follow-up Hawaii (1996) nearly led to a collaboration with the Beach Boys. Since then, the High Llamas' albums have been more electronic and stripped-down. History=Formation= In 1988, the Irish band Microdisney, led by Sean O'Hagan and Cathal Coughlan, broke up. To support himself, O'Hagan briefly worked as a rock music journalist, and in 1990, released a solo album titled High Llamas. The name came from a picture of a Victorian era hot-air balloon that he saw in a magazine. Around 1991 or 1992, the name was recycled for a new band formed by Sean O'Hagan, Marcus Holdaway, Jon Fell and Rob Allum. They could not afford to record a full album, and instead released an EP, titled Apricots. Under a French label, the EP was reissued with two additional tracks, which became the LP Santa Barbera. At this point, the band's style was conventional guitar pop, O'Hagan said, \\"I was quite happy with what we were doing, [but] there wasn't really anything remarkable about it, and it wasn't really the kind of music that I enjoyed listening to ... [which was] the Beach Boys ... the Left Banke, Van Dyke Parks ... a lot of soundtrack music like John Barry, and electronic experimental music like Kraftwerk and Neu!.\\" He also mentioned his frustration with the state of modern rock music, calling it \\"the most conformist, corporate thing out there.\\" For \\"years\\", he said, he \\"was bored shitless by guitar rock ... From looking at the Beach Boys, I saw the Martin Denny thing [and] the early Yellow Magic Orchestra thing. These people were investigating harmonies in really interesting, nearly orchestral ways, but they were using subversive sounds to do it.\\" The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray remarked that without the Beach Boys' 1968 album Friends, \\"the High Llamas probably wouldn't exist.\\" Stereolab performing in London, 1994 (O'Hagan not present) After attending a Stereolab concert in the early 1990s, O'Hagan met the band's founders Tim Gane and L√¶titia Sadier. He became their keyboardist, initially as a temporary replacement, but O'Hagan was \\"allowed to make suggestions and the fun started.\\" His first record appearance was on the EP Space Age Bachelor Pad Music (1993), and he remained a full-time member of the band until Mars Audiac Quintet (1994). Influenced by his time with Gane, O'Hagan decided to revamp his creative aspirations for the High Llamas. In a 1997 article, O'Hagan spoke of the Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds as \\"the beginning of the great pop experiment, [before] rock and roll got hold of the whole thing and stopped it,\\" and intended his new band to carry on in a similar tradition. He continued to make guest appearances on later Stereolab releases. Visser departed the group and was replaced by guitarist John Bennett. =Gideon Gaye‚ÄìSnowbug= In 1994, the High Llamas released Gideon Gaye, an album that reached 94 on the UK Albums Chart for a one-week stay. It was recorded with a ¬£4000 budget in the span of a few months, and anticipated the mid 1990s easy- listening fad. The album received press coverage from magazines such as Q, Mojo and NME, but only received substantial sales and acclaim after being rereleased a year later. It was first reissued on the band's Alpaca Parks imprint, then by Delmore Recordings in the United States, and once more by the major label Epic Records. British music journalists praised Gideon Gaye, but AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger stated that the album was released \\"almost as an afterthought [in the US], with virtually no fanfare.\\" Also in 1994, the High Llamas accompanied Arthur Lee, co-founder of the 1960s band Love, as his backing band for a brief concert tour. Gideon Gaye was well-received from within the record industry, and it became a commonly recommended album among British A&R; label representatives. The band were soon tagged as part of the nascent \\"ork-pop\\" movement, described in a 1996 Billboard piece as \\"a new breed of popsmiths going back to such inspirations as Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach, and Phil Spector in the quest for building the perfect orchestrated pop masterpiece.\\" O'Hagan responded to the Beach Boys comparisons that the album had drawn: \\"[Wilson] has been the biggest influence in my career to date. I was always shy [about] how much I liked him, but this time I decided to be blatant about it.\\" He was also hesitant to be associated with the ork- pop movement, saying that the group's \\"music is a hybrid of stuff from the last 50, 20 or 30 years ... It's definitely about making music for tomorrow.\\" O'Hagan recalled that \\"we had everybody knocking the door down saying, 'here take the money and make the [next] record.'\\" The follow-up to Gideon Gaye, Hawaii (1996), was released on Alpaca Park, and reached number 62 in the UK, again for a one-week stay. He described the work as a fusion between the music of the \\"post mid-European Stockhausen era\\" and the \\"really screwed up West Coast American sort of music, of the Wrecking Crew variety\\". It incorporated more electronic sounds than Gideon Gaye, while its lyrics loosely address themes of \\"nomadism, nostalgia, film and musical theatre, and the effects of colonialism\\". In the US, the album was issued with a 40-minute bonus CD containing material that was previously unreleased in that region. Dominic Murcott then joined the group on vibraphone and marimba. The High Llamas' American and British fanbase continued to grow. Cold and Bouncy (1998) pushed the band further into electronics. According to O'Hagan, it was named for electronica's \\"paradoxical\\" combination of \\"chill\\" or digital sounds and \\"boisterous\\" rhythms. It was accompanied by Lollo Rosso (1998), an album consisting of seven remixed Cold and Bouncy tracks created by Mouse on Mars, Cornelius, Schneider TM, Jim O'Rourke, Kid Loco, Stock, Hausen & Walkman, and the High Llamas. Snowbug (1999) featured Stereolab vocalists L√¶titia Sadier and Mary Hansen. The album was met with poor sales, and was their last before departing V2 Records. A two-disc compilation, Retrospective, Rarities & Instrumentals (2003), collected tracks from their main discography up to this point. Additionally, it included rarities that had been released as B-sides or bonus tracks on Japanese and American editions of their albums, while one song, \\"Vampo Brazil\\", was a previously unreleased outtake from the Cold and Bouncy sessions. =2000s‚Äìpresent= O'Hagan performing with the High Llamas in Spain, 2011 The High Llamas started recording for the Duophonic and Drag City record labels with Buzzle Bee (2000), which saw the band experimenting more with their sound, while Beet, Maize & Corn (2003) eschewed electric guitars and synthesizers in favor of string and brass arrangements. The latter marked the arrival of an additional member, Pete Aves, on guitars and banjo. Unterberger referred to Beet, Maize & Corn as \\"a high achievement for the Llamas with both critics and fans.\\" In The Rough Guide to Rock (2003), music critic Nig Hodgkins commented that despite \\"adventurous breakthroughs by previously obscure American bands such as Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips,\\" the High Llamas failed to attract a comparative following and were seen as \\"a little too esoteric and experimental to threaten a mainstream that had once warmed to the strong melodies of Gideon Gaye.\\" Can Cladders (2007) received generally favourable reviews. Pitchfork reviewer Eric Harvey wrote that the album \\"emerge[d] as the most enjoyable High Llamas record in over a decade. ... with a bounce and sway nearly absent from its largely rhythmless predecessor.\\" Another four years went by until their next release, Talahomi Way (2011), described by O'Hagan as a \\"spring album\\". He said that the band's slowed output was due to low finances, and that he could only sustain a career in music through arrangement commissions. He could not afford commercial studios and recorded in improvised spaces \\"as much as possible, which allowed the budget to go on strings and brass. But I also wanted to create more space on the records. I was tired of density.\\" In 2013, the group contributed a song, \\"Living on a Farm\\", to an episode of the children's television programme Yo! Gabba Gabba. In 2014, the High Llamas premiered a theatrical play, Here Come the Rattling Trees, at the Tristan Bates Theatre in London's Covent Garden. Pitchfork critic Robert Ham summarized the plot as \\"extended anecdotes [used] to comment on the rapid changes happening in London, particularly in Peckham, a region in the southeastern part of the city where O'Hagan has lived for over 20 years.\\" The play originally featured a cast of actors and actresses, but when a studio album adaptation was released in 2016, the record only featured instrumental performances. O'Hagan explained that this was because the label felt that its promotion \\"would be difficult as the record would appear to be from a different medium.\\" In 2019, Drag City released O'Hagan's second solo album, Radum Calls, Radum Calls. During an interview to promote the record, he commented that the High Llamas were not defunct and that he was attempting to secure the rights to the band's work from Universal Music Group, \\"who are extremely reluctant to do anything with our catalog, and I‚Äôve really been wanting to get them remastered and pressed on vinyl, and maybe do an expanded series like Stereolab have done. If we can get that to happen, we‚Äôll tour. ... Then we might use that as an opportunity to officially retire‚Äîit would be a great way to close that book, don‚Äôt you think?\\" Members Current * Sean O'Hagan ‚Äì lead vocals, keyboards, guitar * John Fell ‚Äì bass * Rob Allum ‚Äì drums * Marcus Holdaway ‚Äì keyboards, vibraphone * Dominic Murcott ‚Äì vibraphone, marimba * Pete Aves ‚Äì guitar Former * Anita Visser ‚Äì lead vocals, guitar * John Bennett ‚Äì guitar Discography Studio albums { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Release - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Santa Barbara  * Released: 1992 * Label: JBM - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Gideon Gaye  * Released: 1994 * Label: Target - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Hawaii  * Released: 1996 * Label: Alpaca Park - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Cold and Bouncy  * Released: 1998 * Label: V2 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Snowbug  * Released: 1999 * Label: V2 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Buzzle Bee  * Released: 2000 * Label: Duophonic - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Beet, Maize & Corn  * Released: 2003 * Label: Drag City - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Can Cladders  * Released: 2007 * Label: Drag City - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Talahomi Way  * Released: 2011 * Label: Drag City - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Here Come the Rattling Trees  * Released: 2016 * Label: Drag City } Compilation { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Release - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Retrospective, Rarities and Instrumentals  * Released: 2003 * Label: V2 } Remix EP { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Release - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Lollo Rosso  * Released: 1998 * Label: V2 } ReferencesExternal links  Category:Avant-pop musicians Category:Chamber pop musicians Category:Drag City (record label) artists Category:Musical groups from London Category:Musical groups established in 1991 Category:Stereolab Category:V2 Records artists ","title":"The High Llamas"},{"id":"3955071","text":"Franso Hariri Franso Toma Hariri (1937 ‚Äì February 18, 2001), an Assyrian politician, was a high-ranking and long-standing Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq member and head of the KDP block of Iraqi Kurdistan National Assembly.

It is one of the fastest eSTREAM candidates at around 2.6 cycles per byte on some platforms. It has a structure a little like RC4, but adds an array of 260 32-bit words which are indexed using a permutation of bytes, and produces 64 bits in each round. The authors assert that the name be pronounced \\"Roo\\", a reference to the cipher's Australian origin, by reading the letters \\"Py\\" as Cyrillic (–†—É) rather than Latin characters. This somewhat perverse pronunciation is understood to be their answer, in jest, to the difficult-to- pronounce name Rijndael for the cipher which was adopted as the Advanced Encryption Standard. * The original April 2005 proposal included the cipher Py, and a simplified version Py6. The latter reduces the size of some internal tables, providing greatly reduced key scheduling cost, at the expense of a shorter maximum output length. * In June 2006, the authors described Pypy (even more confusingly, half-Cyrillic Py—Ä—É and thus pronounced \\"Pyroo\\") as an optional stronger variant. This omits one of the output words from each iteration of Py, and thus operates at slightly over half the speed of Py. (Actually about 0.6√ó.) * In January 2007, the key schedule algorithm was changed, producing \\"tweaked\\" variants TPy, TPypy and TPy6. To be precise, the first (key-dependent) phase is unmodified, but the second (IV setup) phase has an error corrected. The round functions used to produce output are identical. * At Indocrypt 2007, Gautham Sekar, Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel proposed two new ciphers RCR-32 and RCR-64 based on the design principles of Pypy and Py, respectively. These replace a variable rotate in Py with a fixed rotate, eliminating an attack and speeding up the cipher slightly. The TPy key schedule is used unmodified. Attacks on the Py-family  , the best cryptanalytic attack on Py (by Hongjun Wu and Bart Preneel) can under some circumstances (e.g. where the IV is much longer than the key) recover the key given partial keystreams for 224 chosen IVs . In a more difficult scenario from the point of view of attacker, given only known plaintext (rather than chosen plaintext), there is also a distinguishing attack on the keystream (by Paul Crowley) which requires around 272 bytes of output and comparable time. This is an improvement on an attack presented by Gautham Sekar, Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel which requires 288 bytes. There is a still a debate whether these attacks constitute an academic break of Py. When the attackers claim that the above attacks can be built with workload less than the exhaustive search under the design specifications of Py and therefore, it is clearly a theoretical break of the cipher, the designers rule out the attacks because Py's security bounds limit any attacker to a total of 264 bytes of output across all keystreams everywhere. A recent revision of the Paul, Preneel, and Sekar paper includes a detailed discussion of this issue in section 9. There are no doubts about the legitimacy of the Wu and Preneel attack. Py was selected as Phase 2 Focus Candidate for Profile 1 (software) by the eSTREAM project but did not advance to Phase 3 due to the Wu and Preneel chosen IV attack. . In January 2007, three new ciphers namely TPy, TPypy and TPy6 have been proposed by the designers of Py to eliminate the above attacks. The TPy is still vulnerable against the above distinguishing attacks by Paul et al. (complexity 288) and Crowley (complexity 272), which do not depend on the key schedule. The best attack so far on the TPypy, which is conjectured to be the strongest of the Py-family of ciphers, is by Sekar et al. which is a distinguishing attack with data complexity 2281. This attack is only meaningful if the key-size of TPypy is longer than 281 bits. To remove attacks on TPy and TPypy, Sekar, Paul and Preneel at Indocrypt 2007 gave proposals for two new ciphers RCR-32 and RCR-64. So far there are no attacks against the RCR-32 and RCR-64. Round functions Py is based on the idea of \\"sliding arrays\\": arrays are indexed relative to a start pointer, which is advanced by one word each round. Where modulo indexing is available (hardware, and many digital signal processors), these can be implemented as circular buffers. In software, these are most easily implemented as large arrays. When the end of the array is reached, the working portions are copied back to the beginning and operations continue. The 256-byte P array contains a 256-entry permutation (each byte appears exactly once), while the Y array contains 260 32-bit words. #include #define ROTL32(x, s) ((x)<<(s)  (x)>>(32-(s))) uint8_t *P; // P[0] through P[255] are active uint32_t *Y; // Y[-3] through Y[256] are active uint32_t s; uint32_t *output; while (output_words) { int i = Y[185] % 256; P[256] = P[i]; // This effectively swaps P[0] and P[i] P[i] = P[0]; // Then copies P[0] to P[256] P++; // Prior P[1] is new P[0], just-written P[256] is new P[255] s += Y[P[72 - Y[P[239 ; s = ROTL32(s, (P[116] + 18) % 32); *output++ = (ROTL32(s, 25) ^ Y[256]) + Y[P[26 ; // This line omitted from Pypy & TPypy *output++ = ( s ^ Y[-1] ) + Y[P[208 ; Y[257] = (ROTL32(s, 14) ^ Y[-3] ) + Y[P[153 ; Y++; // Prior P[-2] is new P[-3], just-written P[257] is new P[256] } When byte output is required, Py specifies that the output words are converted little-endian. Line 17 is omitted from Pypy, Tpypy, and RCR-32. RCR-32 and RCR-64 are identical to the above, except that line 15 is changed to a fixed left-rotate of 19 bits. Py6 has the same structure, but the P and Y arrays are shortened to 64 bytes and 68 words, respectively. P entries are only 6 bits long, a savings that could be exploited in dedicated hardware. The various offsets into \`P[]\` and \`Y[]\` are, of course, modified, making the inner loop: while (output_words) { int i = Y[43] % 64; P[64] = P[i]; P[i] = P[0]; P++; s += Y[P[18 - Y[P[57 ; s = ROTL32(s, (P[26] + 18) % 32); *output++ = (ROTL32(s, 25) ^ Y[64]) + Y[P[8 ; *output++ = ( s ^ Y[-1]) + Y[P[21 ; Y[65] = (ROTL32(s, 14) ^ Y[-3]) + Y[P[48 ; Y++; } External links * Eli Biham, Jennifer Seberry, Py specification (PostScript) * Eli Biham, Jennifer Seberry, Tweaking the IV Setup of the Py Family of Stream Ciphers  The Ciphers TPy, TPypy, and TPy6 * eStream page on Py * Paul Crowley,Cryptanalysis of Py * Souradyuti Paul, Bart Preneel, Gautham Sekar, Distinguishing attacks on the stream cipher Py, FSE 2006. * Gautham Sekar, Souradyuti Paul, Bart Preneel, Weaknesses in the Pseudorandom Bit Generation Algorithms of the Stream Ciphers TPypy and TPy, IACR-ePrint report. * Souradyuti Paul, Bart Preneel, On the (In)security of Stream Ciphers Based on Arrays and Modular Addition (Full Version) , Asicrypt 2006. * Gautham Sekar, Souradyuti Paul, Bart Preneel, Related-key Attacks on the Py-family of Ciphers and an Approach to Repair the Weaknesses, Indocrypt 2007. * The Rijndael page - the \\"Rijndael FAQ\\" is gently parodied in Appendix B of the Py specification.

Designed in the mid 19th century as the first middle-class residential district outside the bastions of the fortified heart of the city, the design of Avenyn was inspired by established formal European streets like the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris and the Ringstra√üe in Vienna. The layout is as a result of an international town planning competition. With a total length of about 1000 meters, it stretches from the moat at the edge of the oldest part of Gothenburg, and ends at the G√∂taplatsen square, where the Gothenburg Museum of Art and other prime cultural institutions are located. At the moat, it connects to the narrower street √ñstra Hamngatan (formerly a canal), and the Avenue takes its it full name after Kungsporten, the \\"King's Gate\\" which was located at the point in the fortifications where √ñstra Hamngatan ends (see Kungsportsplatsen). The gate and the rest of the fortifications were demolished in the 19th century and replaced by a park. Initially a residential street for the wealthy businessmen of the city, Avenyn passes the Stora teatern, the Neo-Renaissance theatre and opera building from 1859, and today has a major concentration of pubs, clubs and restaurants.

It is found in forest understory and bushes in eastern Brazil from Rio Grande do Sul north to central Brazil. Its range also extends into eastern Paraguay and north-eastern Argentina and it has recently been recorded in Uruguay. It is often elusive and hard to see, but is commoner and less shy than other gnateaters. Description It is a small, rounded bird, 13 cm in length with a short tail and fairly long legs. The plumage is mostly reddish brown. There is a white stripe above the eye (grey in the female) which ends in a tuft of feathers which can be hidden. The call is a series of quiet cheeps which become faster and higher-pitched. At dusk and dawn the males make a buzzing sound with their wing feathers as they fly around their territory. The rufous gnateater feeds by moving quickly from one perch to another through undergrowth close to the ground. When it sees an insect it makes a short flight down to the ground or to overhead leaves to catch it. The cup-shaped nest is built in a tree and made of sticks and moss. The female lays two buff-coloured eggs, oval or slightly conical in shape.

History The Imperial Bank of Persia (Persian: ÿ®ÿßŸÜ⁄© ÿ¥ÿßŸáŸÜÿ¥ÿßŸá€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ‚Äé; Bank-e ≈†√¢han≈°√¢hi-ye Ir√¢n) was a British bank that operated as the state bank and bank of issue in Iran (formerly known as Persia until 1935) between 1889 and 1929. It was established in 1889 with a concession from the Persian government to Baron Julius De Reuter (born Israel Beer Josaphat), a German Jewish banker and businessman who later became a Christian and a British subject. The bank was the first modern bank in Iran and introduced European banking ideas to a country in which they were previously unknown. The legal centre of the bank was in London and whilst it was subject to British law, its activities were based in Tehran. It also had operations in other Middle Eastern countries. In 1952, the bank abandoned the Iranian market and it was later renamed British Bank of the Middle East (BBME). In 1959, BBME was acquired by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited. In 1994, the bank‚Äôs head office was moved to Jersey, and subsequently changed its name to HSBC Bank Middle East (HBME) in 1999. In June 2016, the bank transferred its place of incorporation and head office from Jersey to Dubai International Financial Centre, Dubai, UAE.

Biography  Isa Khan Niazi was born in 1453 and his last brother was born in 1478. He died in Delhi in 1548 at the age of 95. The time of 1451 ‚Äì 1525 was the golden period for these khans. It was the time when Lodhis completely dominated the subcontinent (Hindustan). Isa Khan Niazi was a prominent member among the ruling family. He was in the same tribal unit of nobles as Ibrahim Lodhi, Sher Shah Suri. Most of these families were attached with the Delhi sultanate. There, a contention arose between Isa Khan Niazi and Sher Shah Suri which ended in mutiny. Isa Khan's tomb complex Isa Khan Niyazi's tomb Isa Khan's mosque, across his tomb in the Humayun's Tomb complex. = Tomb = Isa Khan's tomb was built during his lifetime (ca 1547-48 AD). It is situated near the site of the Mughal Emperor Humayun's Tomb complex in Delhi which was built later (between 1562-1571 AD). This octagonal tomb has distinct ornamentation in the form of canopies, glazed tiles and lattice screens, and a deep veranda surrounding it, which is supported by pillars. It stands to the south of the Bu Halima garden at the entrance of the complex. An inscription on a red sandstone slab indicates that the tomb is that of Masnad Ali Isa Khan, son of Umar Khan, the Chief chamberlain, and was built during the reign of Islam Shah Suri, son of Sher Shah, in 1547-48 A.D.World Heritage Sites - Humayun's Tomb: Tomb Complex Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). On 5 August 2011, restoration work on this tomb led to the discovery of India's oldest sunken garden. Isa Khan‚Äôs garden tomb is considered the earliest example of an Indian sunken garden attached to a tomb. This concept was later developed at Akbar‚Äôs Tomb and at the Taj Mahal.http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and- culture/article2324453.ece = Mosque = At the edge of the complex, across from the tomb, lies a mosque with noticeable mihrabs. It is known as Isa Khan's Mosque. It was built at the same time as the tomb. Many of the architectural details present in these structures (such as the tomb being placed in a walled garden enclosure) can be seen evolved to a grander scale in the main Humayun's tomb.Isa Khan Niyazi Tomb Complex archnet.org. Ancestry Isa Khan belonged to a Pashtun tribe, Niazi. His descendants are still living in Qila Niazi, Paktia Province, Afghanistan, and in Isakhel, Mianwali, Pakistan. The town of Isakhel was founded about 1830 by Ahmad Khan, ancestor of the present Khans of Isakhel, who were the acknowledged heads of the trans- Indus Niazai; and it takes its name from Isa Khan.Isa Khel Town - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 13, p. 371. The municipality was created in 1875.

He is especially known for his textual criticism of diverse Greek authors.  Life  Rudolf Hercher was born in Rudolstadt to the grammar schoolmaster and later financial advisor Johann Andreas Hercher. He attended grammar school in his home city from 1830 until 1838, where he especially came under the influence of the Latin teacher Lobegott Samuel Obbarius and of the Greek teacher Christian Lorenz Sommer. Before tertiary education, he deepened his education even further, according to his father's wish with a year in the senior class of the Grammar school. He particularly focussed further on German literature, drawing, and English. In the Summer semester of 1839, Hercher moved to Leipzig University, where he studied for three years alongside Gottfried Hermann and Moriz Haupt. In 1842 he went for two further semesters at Humboldt University of Berlin, where the celebrated textual critic, Karl Lachmann instructed him. After gaining his doctorate at Friedrich Schiller University of Jena (1844) Hercher became house teacher to Hartwig Julius Ludwig von Both, member of the Oldenburg bundestag, later in the same year. After a year, he quit this position and traveled for many months to relatives in Manchester and London; after a short stay in Rudolstadt, he worked from Easter till Autumn 1846 as house teacher to an Irish family in Dublin. Subsequently, he travelled for a month in London and in the Netherlands. After his summer teaching position of 1846 was over, Hercher was offered a position as a Collaborator at the Grammar school in Rudolstadt in December of the same year, which he took up in 1847. After seven years of employment he became a schoolmaster in 1854. In the following years, Hercher repeatedly received the opportunity to go on long sabbaticals: He spent further months in Paris and went to Italy for a year in 1859; this stay was extended for a further year because of an eye illness. He owed a call to the local Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium in Berlin to his friendship with Immanuel Bekker and Gustav Parthey (1798‚Äì1872), which he took up in Autumn of 1861. Soon thereafter he was enrolled as a Member of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome, entering its central governance in 1865. He undertook further sabbaticals to Ithaca and Corfu (1863) and to Paris (1867). In Berlin, Hercher interacted with the leading ancient scholars, including Moriz Haupt, Immanuel Bekker, and August Meineke; with Theodor Mommsen and Adolf Kirchhoff he founded the journal Hermes: Zeitschrift f√ºr classische Philologie (Hermes: Journal of Classical Philology) in 1866, which continues to this day. The interaction with his colleagues was so important to Hercher, that he rejected three job offers from foreign universities. On 14 July 1873 he was enrolled as an ordinary member in the Prussian Academy of Sciences, on 19 December 1875 as a corresponding member in the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. In his later years, Hercher came to suffer from neurasthenia, which developed into a serious affliction at the beginning of 1878. On 26 March of that year he died in , Berlin after a brain haemorrhage, aged 58.  Works  Rudolf Hercher is especially known for his works on textual reconstruction. He mainly worked with Greek prose authors of the post-classical period, but also strayed into Homer, Herodotus and Latin authors. His first publication was a critical edition of the work On the Names of Rivers and Mountains (œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÄŒøœÑŒ±Œº·ø∂ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÄœÅ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºêœÄœâŒΩœÖŒºŒØŒ±œÇ), in which he not only produced the text, but also established that the work's attribution to Plutarch was incorrect. He focussed on Arrian's On Hunting(De Venatione), Michael Psellos, Nikephoros Gregoras, the Dreambook of Achmet, Ptolemaios Chennos and Philo of Byzantium. Especially his edition of the erotic authors (Erotici Graeci, two volumes, Leipzig 1858‚Äì1859), his first edition Astrampsychi oraculorum decades (Berlin 1863), his two volume edition of Aelian (Leipzig 1864‚Äì1866) and the Epistolographi Graeci (Paris 1873) attracted attention. In his edition of Aineias Taktikos (Berlin 1870) it first occurred to him, to restore the text which was distorted by many interpolations and to stress the Atticising style of the Late Antique prose author. Of his edition of Plutarch's Moralia, only one volume appeared (Leipzig 1872). As well as these and other monographs, Hercher wrote hundreds of shorter articles on textual criticism and exegesis. He especially discussed the Homeric Epics often. After his death, Carl Robert's archaeology and philology division published these papers under the title Homerische Aufs√§tze von Rudolf Hercher (Berlin 1881). =List of works= *On the Names of Rivers and Mountains *Arriani Nicomediensis Scripta Minora (1854) *Erotici Graeci, two volumes, (Leipzig 1858‚Äì1859) *Aelian (1858) *Astrampsychi oraculorum decades (Berlin 1863) *Aineias Taktikos (Berlin 1870) *Plutach's Moralia, only one volume appeared (Leipzig 1872) *Epistolographi Graeci (Paris, 1873) *Homerische Aufs√§tze (Berlin, 1881) Category:1821 births Category:1878 deaths Category:German classical scholars ","title":"Rudolf Hercher"},{"id":"3955361","text":"The Soviet Union national bandy team represented the Soviet Union in bandy.

He was right-arm medium pace bowler and a lower order batsman. Cricketing career Banerjee made his debut in first class cricket at the age of nineteen and played for an \\"Indians and Anglo-Indians in Bengal\\" team against the touring MCC in 1933‚Äì34. He took 5 for 53 for a joint Bengal and Assam side against Jack Ryder's Australian team in 1935‚Äì36 following which he was selected for the third unofficial test against the same side (which made him miss the first ever Ranji Trophy match for Bengal) and the team to tour England in 1936. The presence of the fast bowlers Mohammad Nissar, Amar Singh and Jahangir Khan meant that Banerjee did not play in any of the Test matches. For Bengal in the Ranji Trophy in 1937‚Äì38, he took 5 for 33 against Central India and a crucial 47 not out against Hyderabad in the semifinal. Just before the final against Nawanagar, he accepted a job in the state service of Jamnagar. This made him ineligible for both teams for the final. When invited to play for Cricket Club of India against the Lord Tennyson's XI, he took 6 for 89 in the inaugural match in the Brabourne Stadium. Three caps in the unofficial Tests against the same side were followed by ordinary performances. Banerjee's career best bowling figures were for Nawanagar against Maharashtra in November 1941. He took 8 for 25 in little over an hour and top scored in both innings. He joined Tatas in Jamshedpur in the next year and the rest of his career was spent with the Bihar. A single appearance in the unofficial test against the Australian Services XI in 1945‚Äì46 led to eight wickets and a surprise selection in the Indian team to England in 1946. Unlike 1936 when there were several fast bowlers, India in 1946 included only Banerjee and Ranga Sohoni. Sohoni appeared in two Tests, Banerjee in none. Banerjee made 315 runs and took 31 wickets in the tour matches. Against Lancashire and Middlesex, he took four wickets and both contributed significantly to Indian victories. At the Oval against Surrey, Banerjee went in last to join Chandu Sarwate with the score at 205 for 9. Sarwate went on to score 124 not out and Banerjee 121.Indians v Surrey, 1946 It is the only instance of the No.10 and No.11 scoring hundreds in the same innings and as of 2009, their partnership of 249 is the second highest for the last wicket in first class cricket.Partnership records Back in India in 1948‚Äì49, Banerjee took 7 for 67 in an innings for East Zone against West Indians on a matting wicket at Allahabad and later scored the final runs in a ten wicket victory. This was the only defeat for West Indies in the tour. This led to his selection, at the age of 37, for the last Test of the series at the Brabourne Stadium. He took four quick wickets in the second innings and a hit six over midwicket as India nearly chased down a target of 361. India played no Test cricket in the next three years and the Brabourne Test turned out to be only one of Banerjee's career. At Jamshedpur in 1949, Delhi went into the third day requiring 46 runs with eight wickets in hand. Banerjee took a hat-trick and bowled them out in thirty nine minutes.Bihar v Delhi 1948‚Äì49 Later in the year against Orissa, he scored 43 and 110, top scoring in both innings, and took 6 for 37. Banerjee continued in the Ranji Trophy for another decade but in the later years it involved \\"more moral than material support\\".Between Indian Wickets, p.159 He also gave up the captaincy that he had held since joining Bihar. Bihar were knocked out fairly regularly by Bengal in the 1950s in the early rounds of the Ranji Trophy and Banerjee made his highest first class score of 138 in one such match. He moved to Bhilai in the late fifties and appeared for Madhya Pradesh in his final season (1959‚Äì60) . Banerjee's stock delivery moved in to the batsman on and off the wicket. He developed the inswing after the first tour of England in 1936. He occasionally bowled the outswinger and had a slower ball in the form of a leg break. Banerjee batted in several positions over the course of his career. Though predominantly a tail-end batsman, he occasionally batted early in the order and opened the innings.

Career Sabia held a number of senior positions in Canada's federal public service during the 1980s and early 1990s, including Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet of the Privy Council Office. Sabia's supervisor, Clerk of the Privy Council Paul Tellier, left the public service to assume the presidency of Crown corporation Canadian National Railway in the early 1990s and subsequently persuaded Sabia to follow him to help in privatizing the company. Sabia held a number of executive positions at Canadian National Railway during the 1990, including the position of chief financial officer.

It is native to Mexico, the West Indies, Central America, South America (as far south as Paraguay) and the southeastern United States (Texas to Florida and as far north as Iowa).Biota of North America Program Image Ecological aspects Found in marshes, swamps, ditches and ponds. Blooms in the late summer to early fall. Description Herbs, perennial, stout, to 100 cm; rhizomes present. Leaves emersed, submersed leaves mostly absent; petiole 56-ridged, 17.545 cm; blade with translucent markings distinct lines, ovate to elliptic, 6.532 ¬¥ 2.519.1 cm, base truncate to cordate. Inflorescences racemes, of 39 whorls, each 315-flowered, decumbent to arching, to 62 ¬¥ 818 cm, often proliferating; peduncles terete, 35‚Äì56 cm; rachis triangular; bracts distinct, subulate, 10‚Äì21 mm, coarse, margins coarse; pedicels erect to ascending, 2.1 7.5 cm. Flowers to 25 mm wide; sepals spreading, 10‚Äì12-veined, veins papillate; petals not clawed; stamens 22; anthers versatile; pistils 200‚Äì250. Fruits oblanceolate, plump, 34-ribbed, abaxially 1-keeled, 23.5 ¬¥ 0.91.5 mm; glands 34; beak terminal,11.3 mm. 2n = 22. Echinodorus cordifolius is very easily recognized, as it is the only species with arching to decumbent inflorescences. In addition, it is the only one with papillate veins on the sepals. Cultivation Easily cultivated in neutral to soft water and tropical to sub-tropical temperatures. Rich substrate and good light. Common in the cultivated aquarium trade. Emersed plants readily produce flowers and seeds but it can be grown submersed as well. Most plants sold are grown emersed on plant farms. Once submerged, leaves may die off before underwater leaves develop. In the aquarium grow in the background as a specimen plant. Will soon outgrow a smaller aquarium but removing the floating leaves will help keep it smaller and submerse. Needs a large, deep aquarium to grow properly. CO2 infusion helps stronger growth. A heavy feeder and for optimum growth a rich substrate is needed, including clay. If grown emerse it is prone to attacks by aphids. Not fussy as to water conditions, tropical aquarium temperatures. Can be grown outdoors in warmer countries, won't tolerate frost. Likes a lot of light.. Brown, Phillip. \\"The Mud King : Echinodorus cordifolius\\", Tropical Fish Hobbyist, October 2007, vol LVI (2) #619 Can be grown in or by the pond in warmer climes. The seeds can be sown in shallow water. Forms Tropica Marble, Marble Queen has an attractive marbled leaf surface which tends to be lost in low light conditions. Tends to remain as a submerged plant longer than the type plant. Likes good substrate, CO2 and a strong light. Cultivated by Oriental Aquarium in Singapore. ovalis is a small, orbiculate plant whose low, wide growth makes it suitable for small aquariums. Reaches a height of about 35 cm with a width of about 30 cm. ssp. fluitans is fast-growing, suitable for large aquariums. Less likely to grow up above the water surface. If it grows large enough, it forms large leaves just under the surface instead. Reaches a height of about 40 cm.

On 31 March 1811, Ajax and HMS Unite encountered a French squadron comprising the frigates Adrienne and Am√©lie, and the armed transport French corvette Dromadaire. Ajax captured Dromadaire, while the frigates managed to escape to Portoferraio. Captain Otway of Ajax reported that Dromadaire was frigate-built and sailed remarkably well. Her cargo consisted of 15,000 shot and shells of various sizes and 90 tons of gunpowder. Apparently Napoleon Bonaparte intended them as a present for Hammuda ibn Ali, the Bey of Tunis.Marshall (1823), Vol. 1, Part 2, p.700. Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, commander in chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, decided to buy her and her stores for the Royal Navy. On 17 March 1814, Ajax captured the French 16-gun brig Alcyon near the Lizard. Alcyon was armed with sixteen 24-pounder carronades, and had a crew of 120 men.

The village is named after the bridge over the River Eamont and straddles the boundary between the historic counties of Cumberland and Westmorland. One of the houses in the village is called the \\"Welcome Inn\\" and was at one time the \\"Welcome into Cumberland Inn\\". Features There are two ancient sites in the village, namely the earthwork known as King Arthur's Round Table and the much better preserved Mayburgh Henge which is situated between the rivers Lowther and Eamont. Mayburgh Henge was built using stones from one or both rivers. The location between the rivers was probably important when it was built 3000 or 4000 years ago, which protected it from invasion. Both sites are under the protection of Historic England. There was another henge close to King Arthur's Round Table, which is now obliterated. A cup was reputed to have been found at the centre of the King Arthur's Round Table Henge. The gateway from Mayburgh Henge points in the direction of King Arthur's Round Table, which was probably a convenient meeting place for millennia. There are several more henges in the area, with at least two towards the north-east, towards Brougham, visible. There is a splendid example of vernacular architecture in the centre of the village. The southern or Westmorland half of the village lies within the civil parish of Yanwath and Eamont Bridge, and the northern part (Skirsgill Lane and Kemplay Bank) is within the civil parish of Penrith. For other local government matters, Eamont Bridge lies within the Eden District wards of Eamont, Penrith South and Penrith Pategill and the Cumbria county council electoral divisions of Penrith Rural, Penrith West and Penrith East. There are two pubs opposite each other at the southern end of the village. A nearby cave called Giant's Cave is associated with several legends. It is variously said to have been the home of a giant named Isir, or an evil knight named Tarquin, who imprisoned 64 men in the cave, or Uther Pendragon. Bridge : The village lies on the A6 road. Until the opening of the M6 motorway, it was a notorious bottleneck because of the narrow bridge over the River Eamont which is still today controlled by traffic lights. The Grade I listed bridge crosses the old county boundary between Cumberland and Westmorland and is one of the oldest bridges in the country still in daily use. It probably dates from the 15th century but was widened in the 19th and the 20th centuries. History On 12 July 927, Eamont Bridge was the scene of a gathering of kings from throughout Britain as recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the histories of William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester. Present were Athelstan, Constant√≠n mac √Åeda, Owain ap Dyfnwal, Hywel Dda, and Ealdred son of Eadulf. This is generally seen as the date of the foundation of the Kingdom of England.

These interactions are mediated by the boson. The discovery of weak neutral currents was a significant step toward the unification of electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force, and led to the discovery of the W and Z bosons.  In simple terms  The weak force is best known for its role in nuclear decay. It has very short range but (apart from gravity) is the only force to interact with neutrinos. The weak force is communicated via exchange particles like other subatomic forces. Perhaps the most well known of the exchange particles for the weak force is the W particle which is involved in beta decay. W particles have electric charge - there are both positive and negative W particles - however the Z boson is also an exchange particle for the weak force but does not have any electrical charge. Exchange of a Z boson transfers momentum, spin, and energy, but leaves the interacting particles‚Äô quantum numbers unaffected - charge, flavor, baryon number, lepton number, etc. Because there is no transfer of electrical charge involved, exchange of Z particles is referred to as ‚Äúneutral‚Äù in the phrase ‚Äúneutral current‚Äù. However the word ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù here has nothing to do with electricity - it simply refers to the exchange of the Z particle.  Definition  The neutral current that gives the interaction its name is that of the interacting particles. For example, the neutral-current contribution to the ‚Üí elastic scattering amplitude :\\\\mathfrak{M}^{\\\\mathrm{NC}} \\\\propto J_{\\\\mu}^{\\\\mathrm{(NC)}}( u_{\\\\mathrm{e}}) \\\\; J^{\\\\mathrm{(NC)}\\\\mu}(\\\\mathrm{e^{-}}) ~, where the neutral currents describing the flow of the neutrino and of the electron are given by :J^{\\\\mathrm{(NC)}\\\\mu}(f) = \\\\bar{u}_{f}\\\\gamma^{\\\\mu}\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(g^{f}_{V}-g^{f}_{A}\\\\gamma^{5}\\\\right)u_{f}, with g^{f}_{V}=T_3(f)-2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta_W ~ Q(f) and g^{f}_{A}=T_3(f) are the vector and axial vector couplings for fermion f. These couplings amount to essentially left chiral for neutrinos and axial for charged leptons. The boson can couple to any Standard Model particle, except gluons and photons. However, any interaction between two charged particles that can occur via the exchange of a virtual boson can also occur via the exchange of a virtual photon. Unless the interacting particles have energies on the order of the boson mass (91 GeV) or higher, the virtual boson exchange has an effect of a tiny correction (~(E/M_Z)^2~) to the amplitude of the electromagnetic process. Particle accelerators with energies necessary to observe neutral current interactions and to measure the mass of boson weren't available until 1983. On the other hand, boson interactions involving neutrinos have distinctive signatures: They provide the only known mechanism for elastic scattering of neutrinos in matter; neutrinos are almost as likely to scatter elastically (via boson exchange) as inelastically (via boson exchange). Weak neutral currents were predicted in 1973 by Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg, and confirmed shortly thereafter in 1973, in a neutrino experiment in the Gargamelle bubble chamber at CERN.

It was founded in 1866 by Mother Mary Ward for the education of girls. The Delhi and the Lucknow campuses are co-educational. The college was founded to provide an education to all sections of society, regardless of caste, creed or financial status. The children are prepared for the ICSE Examination at the class 10 level, the ISC at the +2 level conducted by the CISCE Delhi. The institution, established and administered by the Christian Society, comes under articles 29 and 30 of the Indian Constitution and for Religious Jurisdiction it comes directly under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Allahabad . The principal of the school is Sister Jyoti CJ .The school includes the Teachers Training Center, a school for would-be-teachers. It also runs a school for underprivileged children called Asha Deep. The motto of the school is \\"Hope Lightens Work\\" (from the Latin version - Spe Labor Levis'). Members of the student council are selected each year, including the Head Girl, Vice Head Girl, House Captains, House Vice Captains, Student Editor and Sub-Editor, USM President and vice-president, Games Captain, Games Vice Captain. History The history of St. Mary's Convent Inter College, Allahabad, rests on the foundation of the Congregation of Jesus by venerable Mary Ward (nun) who founded the Institute in 1609, to cater to the education of girls, with the special emphasis on moral and spiritual foundation . Inspired by her zeal and enthusiasm, the CJ sisters came to India at an invitation from Bishop Anastasius Hartmann, to the then Superior General of the CJ sisters, Mother Catherine de Graccho, in Nymphenburg Germany.The pioneers to India, a group of five young sisters from Germany set out in 1853 across the oceans to the unknown strange land of India. After reaching Bombay by ship, they embarked upon a perilous journey across the vast peninsula of India in a bullock cart and reached Patna, where they founded the first house and school in India, St. Joseph's Convent High School, Patna. In the years that followed, these brave women and others who followed them worked whole heartedly to spread God'sKingdom in the Indian subcontinent , establishing new convents and reaching out to the poor and needy in the northern parts of India through the ministries of education , health care , care of youth and orphans . In the year 1866 ,Bishop Anastasius Hartmann intended to open a new Convent of the IBMV ( Sisters of Loreto ) in Allahabad and appealed to Mother General for more sisters . By the time the 8th Party of sisters arrived in India , the Convent and Boarding school at Phaphamau was almost ready . The sisters moved into the Convent of January 1ih , 1866. On January 15th , 1866 , the boarding school was opened with two pupils , Mary Elise and Nina Frizzone . Though the number of students increased gradually , since the sisters had to face endless problems in Phaphamau , they first shifted to Elgin Road in Allahabad , then temporarily to Lowther Castle and finally in February 1888 (or 1886), to 32 Thornhill Road (Maharishi Dayanand Road), where the school is situated today. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Allahabad had offered a piece of leased land, within the campus of St. Joseph's Cathedral, Allahabad to the sisters to build their school, where a spacious red - brick building had been erected. The original building exists to this day, and is considered one of the heritage buildings of the city on account of its unique architectural style. Around it many other structures have been constructed in the course of years to accommodate the ever increasing number of students. DELVING INTO THE PAST St. Mary's Convent is a name synonymous with education, values, culture and sense of responsibility. Notable alumni Throughout its history a sizable number of alumni have become notable in various fields. * Indira Gandhi, a key 20th- century stateswoman, a central figure of the Indian National Congress party, and to date the only female Prime Minister of India intermittently attended this premier institution until her matriculation in 1934. * Shubha Mudgal, a well-known Indian singer of Hindustani classical music. * Dr.Deepali Pant Joshi, executive director of Reserve Bank of India. * Neelum Saran Gour, an author, translator, academic and chronicler of various facets of Allahabad city. * Shahnaz Husain an Indian entrepreneur. * Leema Dhar, a novelist and poet. * Nidhi Singh , an Indian Television and Film actor. * Rita Bahuguna Joshi an Indian politician and ex-cabinet minister in the Government of Uttar Pradesh. * Aradhana Mishra also known as Mona Misra, an Indian politician and member of 17th Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh also studied here. Lucknow Another branch of St. Mary's is in RDSO Colony, Manak Nagar, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The principal of the school is Sr. Lissy CJ and the manager is Sr. Mariette CJ. The motto of the school is \\"Efforts Spell Success\\". Unlike the Allahabad branch, this branch happens to be a co- educational institute. The office bearers in this branch include the Head Boy, Head Girl, House captains, Games captains, and class monitors. The class monitors of year 12 acts as the prefects of the college.

Details Prior to the Environmental Modification Convention signed in Geneva in 1977, the United States used weather warfare in the Vietnam War. Under the auspices of the Air Weather Service, the United States' Operation Popeye used cloud seeding over the Ho Chi Minh trail, increasing rainfall by an estimated thirty percent during 1967 and 1968. It was hoped that the increased rainfall would reduce the rate of infiltration down the trail.Transcript of the US Senate Hearing on Weather Modification of March 20, 1974 With much less success, the United States also dropped salt on the airbase during the siege of Khe Sanh in an attempt to reduce the fog that hindered air operations. A research paper produced for the United States Air Force written in 1996 speculates about the future use of nanotechnology to produce \\"artificial weather\\", clouds of microscopic computer particles all communicating with each other to form an intelligent fog that could be used for various purposes. \\"Artificial weather technologies do not currently exist. But as they are developed, the importance of their potential applications rises rapidly.\\" Weather modification technologies are described in an unclassified academic paper written by air force officer-cadet students as \\"a force multiplier with tremendous power that could be exploited across the full spectrum of war-fighting environments.\\" The Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (Geneva: May 18, 1977, Entered into force: October 5, 1978) prohibits \\"widespread, long-lasting or severe effects as the means of destruction, damage or injury\\". However, it has been argued that this permits \\"local, non-permanent changes\\". In contrast, the \\"Consultative Committee of Experts\\" established in Article VIII of the Convention has stated in their \\"Understanding relating to Article II\\" that any use of environmental modification where this is done \\"as a means of destruction, damage or injury to another State Party, would be prohibited.\\". Furthermore, they conclude in the same paragraph that \\"military or any other hostile use of environmental modification techniques, would result, or could reasonably be expected to result, in widespread, long-lasting or severe destruction, damage or injury.\\", meaning that all signatories are expected to abstain from using weather modification to cause harm at any scale. Importantly, the language of the treaty does not overtly condemn military use of weather modification when it does not directly cause harm, such as the United States' use of weather modification in the siege of Khe Sanh, discussed above. Because of the limitations of the treaty, and the fact that it applies only to signatory states, weather warfare is not a thing of the past, and may continue to play a role in warfare throughout the twenty-first century.

He was elected to the office of the president of the Cricket Club of India in 1989. He afterwards served as the president of the Club's Legend's Club and was the chairman of his family's company, Apte Group. His brother Arvind Apte was also a cricketer. He is a former Sheriff of Mumbai.  Early life  Apte was born on 5 October 1932 into the Chitpavan Brahmin household of Laxmanrao Apte. His paternal grandfather had set up textile mills and sugar factories as the family business. He attended the Children's Academy before it was taken over by the Government of India, after which he moved to the Scottish Presbyterian Wilson High School, where he was encouraged to play cricket. Apte finished his Bachelor of Arts degree at Mumbai University and finished his graduate degree in fine arts at Elphinstone College. Career Apte, although a right-hand batsman by trade, began his career in 1948 as a leg spin bowler under the coaching of Vinoo Mankad while he was a student at Elphinstone College. In 1951, at the age of 19, he made his first-class debut playing for Indian Universities against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club. In 1952, at the age of 20, he played his first Ranji trophy against the Saurashtra cricket team after Vijay Merchant dropped out due to injuries. That same year, he was selected as a replacement to the Bombay team after Pankaj Roy, and made his national cricket debut against the Pakistan team that season. He also played one season for the Bengal cricket team. In 1953, Apte was selected for India's tour to West Indies, where at Port-of-Spain, he finished as the second highest scorer for India after Polly Umrigar. He played in only one first-class match in 1954, after which he was never selected on the national Indian team again. He maintains that his being dropped was \\"an unsolved mystery\\". Later on, in his autobiography, he states that soon after his run in the West Indies, his father was approached by chief selector Lala Amarnath for a share of the New Delhi base of their family's business, Kohinoor Mills. After his father politely declined the selector, Apte was never selected to represent India again. He joined his family's business and officially retired from international cricket at the age of 34, although he continued to play first class cricket. His last first-class game was the 1967-68 Ranji Trophy final between Bombay and Madras. Apte is the only cricket player to have played alongside D. B. Deodhar and Sachin Tendulkar. In 1989, he became the president of the Cricket Club of India and awarded Tendulkar playing membership, and in 2016, argued that the Cricket Club of India was a founding member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India after the controversial Lodha Committee report proposed to consign the Club as an associate member of the Board, and thus taking away the voting rights of the former's members as part of the reformation process at the latter. He was the president of the Club's Legends Club, and in 2014, urged the Club to make the Anandji Dossa reference library available to the public. In December 1983, Apte was selected to become the Sheriff of Mumbai. In 2011, he inaugurated the 26th Sportstar Trophy. In 2015, at the age of 82, he published his autobiography titled As Luck Would Have It at Wankhede Stadium at the hands of Sunil Gavaskar. In business, Apte served as the president of the Mumbai Chamber of Commerce. He served as the chairman of the Apte Group.  Personal life  Apte's younger brother Arvind Apte, also played first-class cricket for Bombay, Rajasthan and Indian Universities. While his son, Vaman Apte represented India in squash and Mumbai University in cricket, and his daughter was an inter-school badminton champion.

Early life and education Stephen Green was born on 7 November 1948 to Dudley Keith Green and Dorothy Rosamund Mary Green (n√©e Wickham). After a private education at Lancing College, near his family home in Brighton, he attended Exeter College, Oxford, obtaining a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) in 1966. Green's parents were active churchgoers and influenced his religious activities both as a young man and later in life; after graduating he spent a year volunteering in the East End of London at a hostel for recovering alcoholics, a move also reputedly influenced by a visit from a Church of England vicar. It was during his time at the hostel that he met Janian Joy, a fellow volunteer, whom he married in 1971. In 1975 (during a Harkness Fellowship, on secondment from the Overseas Development Administration) Green also obtained a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Career In 1971, Green began his professional life as a civil servant in the British government's Ministry of Overseas Development (now the Department for International Development), where he spent the next six years. In 1977, he joined McKinsey & Co Inc. management consultants, with whom he undertook assignments in Europe, North America and the Middle East. As a result of being headhunted, Green joined the then Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1982, initially on a two-year contract, with responsibility for corporate planning activities. In 1985 he was put in charge of the development of the bank's global treasury operations, and in 1992 became group treasurer of HSBC Holdings plc with responsibility for the HSBC Group's treasury and capital markets businesses globally. In March 1998 Green was appointed to the Board of HSBC Holdings plc as executive director of Investment Banking and Markets, responsible for the investment banking, private banking and asset management activities of the Group. He assumed additional responsibility for the Group's corporate banking business in May 2002. As executive director, Green cancelled all executive bonuses in both 2001 and 2002, telling The Wall Street Journal in March 2003: \\"We took the view that a business that had not performed for the shareholder couldn't expect to receive bonuses\\". The decision saw some key staff leave in protest but it also won the company some praise; Institutional Investor magazine quoted HSBC's then chairman, Sir John Bond, as saying: \\"We had corporate clients come up to us and say, 'Thank God you've taken a stand'\\". In the year before becoming chief executive, Green earned below ¬£1m; HSBC's annual report for the period showed that none of the company's five top-earning employees was a board member. Green told The Guardian in October 2003: \\"Plenty of people in this organisation earn more than me. I genuinely don't care. I can hardly be described as lowly paid. Since when was money the be-all and end-all?\\" Asked by the newspaper's reporter Jill Treanor how he reconciled the organization's high salaries and bonuses with his religious faith, he replied: \\"Do I personally feel some kind of incompatibility between what I believe and being in financial services markets? I can only say no\\". His appointment as group chief executive took effect on 1 June 2003. Shortly afterwards, in October 2003, HSBC announced that it would offshore the work done by its UK finance processing centres in Birmingham, Sheffield, Brentwood and Swansea to India, Malaysia and China within two years. The move, which represented the largest such offshoring in the financial services sector at that time and would lead to the loss of 4,000 British jobs, led the UK trade union UNIFI to warn Green that the \\"gloves were off\\". He defended the decision, telling The Guardians Jill Treanor: > \\"If you are a responsible company like us we do need to think about this on > a global basis. We have to approach this in a responsible and human way. I > also have to bear in mind that people are going to get jobs in India (and > elsewhere). It's wrong to pretend you can protect the existing jobs and > wrong to pretend there isn't going to be change. It can't be the right > response to say that emerging markets have no right to jobs.\\" He added: > \\"Cost minimisation cannot be the only driver of this. There is no way we > want to jeopardise the quality of customer service\\". Green also oversaw HSBC's acquisition of Household International, a US subprime lender, as well as its integration into the parent company. He later came to regret the deal, which was the largest acquisition in a series conducted by HSBC in the five years leading up to his appointment as its chief executive. In January 2005, Green became chairman of HSBC Bank plc, the group's UK clearing bank subsidiary, and group executive chairman in June 2006. In its July 2005 issue, Bloomberg Markets magazine reported that HSBC was allowing money laundering by drug dealers and state sponsors of terrorism; the magazine alleged that this had included a transfer of $100,000 in April 2000 to the Taliban in Afghanistan which had subsequently resulted in a fine levied by the US Treasury Department. Green denied the allegations, calling them \\"a singular and wholly irresponsible attack on the bank's international compliance procedures\\". Subsequent investigations however, confirmed that money laundering had taken place at HSBC for several years throughout Green's tenure as chief executive and chairman, chiefly for the Sinaloa Cartel. Green earned well over ¬£25 million per year at the time. Green's successor as the top of HSBC, Stuart Gulliver, said \\"between 2004 and 2010, our anti-money laundering controls should have been stronger and more effective and we failed to spot and deal with unacceptable behaviour.\\" =Minister of State for Trade and Investment= In September 2010, it was announced that Green would join the UK's Conservative‚ÄìLiberal Democrat coalition government in early 2011 as an unpaid Minister of State for Trade and Investment. In order to take up his ministerial position, he stepped down as Group Chairman of HSBC on 3 December 2010 and was replaced by Douglas Flint. To enable him to be accountable to Parliament, he was created a life peer on 16 November 2010 as Baron Green of Hurstpierpoint, of Hurstpierpoint in the County of West Sussex, and was introduced in the House of Lords on 22 November. He was Minister of State for Trade and Investment in both the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from 11 January 2011 until 11 December 2013. =Aftermath= After Green's retirement from HSBC, the questions that had begun to be asked about the bank's behaviour under his leadership continued. On 23 July 2012, the US Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a 335-page report setting out HSBC's compliance failures over a ten year period. In the report, Senate investigators said the bank had bypassed the USA's sanctions against Iran, enabled money laundering by Mexican drug lords (chiefly for the Sinaloa Cartel), and had conducted business with companies with links to terrorism. The report quoted emails copied to Green detailing such dubious transactions and alleged that the bank had continued to allow them to continue even after he and his colleagues had promised to act. Green told Sky News that he had \\"no case to answer\\" over the money laundering scandal, saying: \\"As and when issues were drawn to our attention, as we were seeking to grapple with the issues, we took action. I think we must acknowledge there were some failures of implementation. HSBC has expressed its regret for that. I share that regret.\\" Defending Green, Lord Oakeshott, a former Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: \\"Stephen Green was a thoughtful banker in holy orders. But if even he couldn't stop these scandals, banks like HSBC and Barclays aren't just too big to fail, they are clearly too big to control\\". The Senate report prompted shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, Chris Leslie, to write to Green asking him to \\"place on the record ‚Äì at the earliest opportunity ‚Äì an assurance that you took every appropriate step if and when you became aware of the issues raised by this report\\" and asking a number of specific questions. Leslie was unconvinced by Green's reply, in which he had written: \\"With regards [sic] to the bank's efforts to address its AML (anti-money laundering) and OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) compliance issues, HSBC has expressed its regret that there were failures of implementation in these areas, and I share that regret\\". Leslie maintained that Green's letter failed to: > address the detailed questions about what he knew and when about these very > serious issues. As a British Minister, an adviser to George Osborne on > banking and a member of the Cabinet committee on banking reform, he is > accountable first and foremost to Parliament. He cannot and should not hide > behind \\"continuing discussions between HSBC and the US authorities\\" as a > reason for failing to answer questions. Shortly afterwards, Green failed to attend the House of Lords to answer a Labour question about the affair. The Leader of the House of Lords, Lord Strathclyde, defended Green, saying that his earlier employment with HSBC did not affect his ability to carry out his duties. In February 2015, there was further criticism of Green and his leadership of HSBC after BBC Television broadcast a Panorama programme entitled The Bank of Tax Cheats exposing the complicity of HSBC's Swiss private bank, HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA, in helping more than 100,000 clients from over 200 countries evade tax worth hundreds of millions of pounds. At the time of the alleged offences Green was the Swiss bank's chairman. BBC presenter Richard Bilton confronted Green, who refused to discuss the issue saying only: \\"As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present\\". Chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge MP, said: \\"Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices. Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer\\". A few days after the Panorama broadcast, Green resigned as chairman of the advisory council for banking industry body, The City UK, saying that he did not want to damage the effectiveness of the organisation in promoting good governance and doing the right thing. Other Some of his prior directorships included the Bank of Bermuda Limited, HSBC Mexico, SA and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited. He was also chairman of HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) SA and HSBC North America Holdings Inc., deputy chairman of HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG and was a board member of HSBC France. In 2005 he was appointed a trustee of the British Museum, a position from which he resigned before his appointment as Minister of State. In 2014 he was appointed a trustee of the Natural History Museum by the Prime Minister David Cameron for a period of four years, and was elected chair by the board of trustees from 1 April 2014. =Awards= Green was shortlisted for the Grassroot Diplomat Initiative Award in 2015 where he remains in the directory of the Grassroot Diplomat Who's Who publication. Personal life Green is an ordained priest in the Church of England, having studied theology at Manchester University's Northern Ordination course while in Hong Kong,Crockford's Clerical Directory under \\"The Reverend Prebendary The Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint\\" and he is the author of the book Serving God? Serving Mammon? He has since described the book as \\"out of print and out of date\\". During his time as a senior banking executive, he was known to compose his sermons while travelling around the world on business. Green was awarded an honorary doctor's degree from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London in 2010. He is married to Janian and has two daughters, Suzannah and Ruth. He has a sister, Elizabeth, who lives in the US and a brother, George Francis Green, who is professor of Labour Economics and Skills Development at the Institute of Education, University of London.

Together with the nearby Russell Offices, they house the headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Department of Defence. History By the mid 1960s it was clear that the Department of Defence needed more space than was available at the Russell Offices site, and a search for a suitable location that could house thousands of personnel began. In 1968 the site in the wooded area at the south east foot on Mount Ainslie was decided on, which despite its relative isolation was felt to be able to provide good connection to the Russell offices site, along a new road, now known as Northcott Ave. Some Canberrans on the other hand feel that it has been somewhat hidden away on purpose. The site's location adjacent to the airport meant that Defence had to accept a long low building rather than the preferred high-rise option. The job was given to the ACT Branch of the Federal Department of Works (later the Department of Housing and Construction), their first such large scale project in Canberra. The Principal Architect in the Branch was James McCormick, who in turn appointed the young graduate Theo Hirsch as the principal designer of the project, along with Max Barham and Bill Adamson, beginning work in 1969. After the adoption of the design concept of long wings separated by service towers, with a finish of off-form concrete, considerable effort was put into achieving a warm colour by choosing an aggregate from Cooma rather than the standard black aggregate from Mt Mugga. The complex was built in three stages, with the first stage comprising the southern two wings completed in 1973, and the last wing completed in 1976. Two more sections were planned at the northern end, bending back towards the hill, making an S shape. The north end of Node E features protruding reinforcing bars at the floor levels, and the corridor ends can clearly be seen. It is said that the discovery of instabilities in the earth caused the plans to be shelved, but it is likely that funding just ceased. It was built during the second decade of the expansion of Canberra under the National Capital Development Commission, an authority that oversaw the construction of very large office complexes and other buildings in the 1970s that are amongst the most dramatic examples of the Brutalist style in Australia, buildings that displayed the bold sculptural and structural possibilities of concrete. These include John Andrew's Cameron Offices, Belconnen, 1970-76 (partly demolished), and his Callam Offices in Woden (1977‚Äì81), the Canberra School of Music by Daryl Jackson and Evan Walker (1970‚Äì76), the Edmund Barton Building by Harry Seidler (1970‚Äì74), and the High Court (1975-1980) and the National Gallery of Australia (1973-1982) both by Edwards Madigan Torzillo & Briggs. The Campbell Park Offices is the least known of this group due to its isolated location, and is one which is \\"more rugged and uncompromising\\". In 1975 it won the Concrete Institute of Australia's Principal Award for Excellence in Concrete. In 2002, along with many defense properties, the Campbell Park Offices were sold and leased back from the private sector. Description The building is accessed from Northcott Drive, which passes the Australian Defence Force Academy and the Royal Military College, Duntroon to the south then on to the Russell Offices. It crosses Fairbairn Avenue that runs between the airport (formerly the Royal Australian Air Force Fairbairn base) and the Australian War Memorial. Northcott Drive runs along part of the uphill side of the building, and there is a drive on the down-hill side which leads to the extensive car parking areas. Campbell Park Offices from Northcott Drive Aerial view from north east The building houses 2200 personnel in four long sections running generally north‚Äìsouth, numbered CP1-CP4 from the south end, and the vertical nodes where they join are lettered A-E. Access is by main security entrances at B and D Nodes. A commercial cafeteria and banking facilities are at Node C, Ground level. Personnel must exit the building to use these. Underground document storage and a gym is below part of the building. The building looks eastward across the Majura Valley and Canberra Airport and backs onto Mount Ainslie, with seven floors of varying width, staggered back to the west to blend with the profile of the hill, and shade most floors from the afternoon sun. The cross section is complex, with the office floors elevated above various service rooms, the cafeteria, entries and walkways, most floors being 13.3m wide, except levels 5 and 7 which are wider, creating 3 setbacks on the front, and four on the rear. All floors are accessed by central corridors, which also stagger back in, in a sequence matching the front setbacks. The first three sections each bend slightly away from each other towards the east, with Nodes B and C being triangular in plan, while D is squarer, and the last, northernmost section runs in a straight line from the third section. The last Node is triangular in the opposite direction to the others, as part of the original concept that further sections would have bent back towards the hill, creating an S shape. The Nodes contain lifts, stairs and toilets, and all Nodes except A have striking open spiral stairs. The vertical structure consists of the Nodes, and evenly spaced supports formed as fin-like walls, which are expressed as tall piers on the rear, breaking up the space under the overhanging floors in a rhythm of thicker and thinner walls, while on the front the floors are partly cantilevered, thrusting forward on the first three floors to support only the spandrel beams, then as vertical walls for the next three floors, then as spandrel supports again for the final two floors. All concrete surfaces are in off-form concrete, with the spandrels, some columns and the underside of the floors smooth finished, while all other surfaces are vertically ribbed and bush hammered. This finish was achieved by placing vertical timber rods in the formwork, resulting in smooth semi-circular grooves 50mm deep and protruding nibs, which were then hammered every 100mm vertically, resulting in a \\"random but consistent pattern [that] is a remarkably successful marriage of an ancient building material and patient handiwork\\". It was the largest example of the technique in Australia at the time.

As a young man living in Caserta, Pellegrini Giampietro founded a nationalist legion named Sempre pronti (\\"Always Ready\\"). He was a decorated infantry lieutenant in World War I, and joined the Fascist movement in 1922, as a member of the Benito Mussolini's Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF), and took part in the March on Rome. In the period, Pellegrini Giampietro became associated with certain clubs of the Freemasonry. A major figure of Campanian-elected fascists (together with Alfredo Rocco, Bruno Spampanato, and the economist Alberto Beneduce), he received a diploma in Law in 1926, and became lawyer for the next eight years. He was one who took Fascism into academia, lecturing on Comparative public law and doctrinary history of Fascism at Naples University. He also worked in several credit unions. Pellegrini Giampietro was a volunteer infantry captain on Francisco Franco's side in the Spanish Civil War, and was twice decorated. Upun his return, he received numerous political appointments ‚Äì notably, he was a counsellor for the Corporazioni and the Fasci, and deputy- secretary in the Ministry of Finance in 1943. He joined Mussolini in Northern Italy after the latter's ousting and Italy's commitment to the Allies in World War II, becoming an official of the Nazi German-controlled Italian Social Republic (the \\"republic of Sal√≤\\"). As finance minister, he also set up, in 1944, its infamous Brigate Nera paramilitary force. At the end of the war, Pellegrini Giampietro was arrested and charged with collaborating with the enemy. He escaped and in 1949, he took refuge in Brazil, then Argentina, and finally Uruguay. He kept on working as a banker, and edited the magazine Sintesi. Domenico Pellegrini Giampietro wrote on the theory of Fascism: his 1941 volume Aspetti spirituali del fascismo (\\"Spiritual Aspects of Fascism\\") dealt with the more mystical qualities of the dogma, while L'oro di Sal√≤ (\\"The Gold of Sal√≤\\") attempted to explain his actions as planner for the Republic's economy (notably, in early 1945 he had printed only 10,881 million although the print of 137,840 million had been authorized), as well as launching accusations at people who would have been responsible for plundering the wealth amassed by Mussolini's government.

The drama is considered a classic example of Italian neorealism. Plot Bergman plays Karin, a displaced Lithuanian in Italy, who secures release from an internment camp by marrying an Italian ex-POW fisherman, (Mario Vitale), whom she meets in the camp. He promises her a great life in his home island of Stromboli, a volcanic island located between the mainland of Italy and Sicily. She soon discovers that Stromboli is very harsh and barren, not at all what she expected, and the people, very traditional and conservative, many fishermen, show hostility and disdain towards this foreign woman who does not follow their ways. Karin becomes increasingly despondent and eventually decides to escape the volcano island. The film also features documentary-like segments about fishing and an actual evacuation of the town after an eruption of the volcano. Cast * Ingrid Bergman as Karin * Mario Vitale as Antonio * Renzo Cesana as The Priest * Mario Sponzo as The Man from the Lighthouse * Gaetano Famularo as Man with Guitar * Angelo Molino as Baby, uncredited Most villagers are played by actual people from the island, as is typical of neorealism. Background The film is the result of a famous letter from Ingrid Bergman to Roberto Rossellini, in which she wrote that she admired his work and wanted to make a movie with him. She and Rossellini set up a joint production company for the film, Societ per Azioni Berit (Berit Films, sometimes written as Bero Films), and she also helped Rossellini to secure a production and distribution deal with RKO and its then owner, Howard Hughes, thus securing most of the budget together with international distribution for the film. Originally, she had approached Samuel Goldwyn, but he bowed out after having seen Rossellini's film Germany, Year Zero.TCM: Stromboli ‚Äì Notes Linked 2013-10-20 The terms of Rossellini's contract with RKO stated that all footage had to be turned over to RKO, who would edit an American version of the film, based on Rossellini's Italian version. However, the US version was eventually made without the director's input. Rossellini protested, and claimed that RKO's 81 minute version was radically different from his original 105 minute version. Rossellini obtained support from Father F√©lix Morli√≥n, who had been involved in the screenwriting. He sent a telegram to Joseph Breen, director of MPPDA's Production Code Administration, urging him to compare the original script with the RKO version, as he felt that the religious theme he had written into the screenplay had been lost.AFI Catalog of Feature Films: Stromboli ‚Äì Notes Linked 2013-10-20 The conflict eventually led to Rossellini and RKO taking legal action against each other over the international distribution rights to the film. The exact outcome is unknown, but it can be noted that the unrestored RKO version of the film, as distributed, is 102‚Äì105 minutes long. It lists credits that were missing in the first RKO version, but it still has 1950 as the production year, and the same MPAA number as the 81 minute version. This indicates that the differences were resolved rather quickly. Some confusion surrounds the Italian release date of the film. Modern sources list the release year as either 1949 or 1950, but an Associated Press article dated March 12, 1950 reported that the film had not yet been shown publicly in Italy. It appears that few Italians had a chance to see the film until it was screened at the 11th Venice International Film Festival on August 26, 1950.Dagrada, Elena. \\"A Triple Alliance for a Catholic Neorealism: Roberto Rossellini According to Felix Norton, Giulio Andreotti and Gian Luigi Rondi.\\" Moralizing Cinema: Film, Catholicism, and Power. Eds. Daniel Biltereyst and Daniela Treveri Gennari. Routledge, 2014. Stromboli is perhaps best remembered for the extramarital affair between Rossellini and Bergman that began during the production of the film, as well as their child born out of wedlock a couple of weeks before the film's American release. In fact, the affair caused such a scandal in the United States that church groups, women's clubs and legislators in more than a dozen states around the country called for the film to be banned, and Bergman was denounced as \\"a powerful influence for evil\\" on the floor of the US Senate by Colorado Senator Edwin C. Johnson. Furthermore, Bergman's Hollywood career was halted for a number of years, until she won an Academy Award for her performance in Anastasia. Critical reception In Italy, Stromboli was awarded the Rome Prize for Cinema as the best film of the year. Initial reception for Stromboli in America, however, was very negative. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times opened his review by writing: \\"After all the unprecedented interest that the picture 'Stromboli' has aroused ‚Äî it being, of course, the fateful drama which Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini have made ‚Äî it comes as a startling anticlimax to discover that this widely heralded film is incredibly feeble, inarticulate, uninspiring and painfully banal.\\" Crowther added that Bergman's character \\"is never drawn with clear and revealing definition, due partly to the vagueness of the script and partly to the dullness and monotony with which Rossellini has directed her.\\" The staff at Variety agreed, writing, \\"Director Roberto Rossellini purportedly denied responsibility for the film, claiming the American version was cut by RKO beyond recognition. Cut or not cut, the film reflects no credit on him. Given elementary-school dialog to recite and impossible scenes to act, Ingrid Bergman's never able to make the lines real nor the emotion sufficiently motivated to seem more than an exercise ... The only visible touch of the famed Italian director is in the hard photography, which adds to the realistic, documentary effect of life on the rocky, lava-blanketed island. Rossellini's penchant for realism, however, does not extend to Bergman. She's always fresh, clean and well-groomed.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote: \\"As entertainment, it does have a few moments of distinction, but on the whole it is a dull slow-paced piece, badly edited and mediocre in writing, direction and acting.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker found that there was \\"nothing whatsoever in the footage that rises above the humdrum\\", and felt that Bergman \\"doesn't really seem to have her heart in any of the scenes.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post lamented, \\"It's a pity that many people who never go to foreign-made pictures will be drawn into this by the Rossellini-Bergman names and will think that this flat, drab, inept picture is what they've been missing.\\" In Britain, The Monthly Film Bulletin was also negative, writing that Rossellini's \\"extempore method is sadly out of place in a film dealing with personal relationships and, although there are indications that Karin is intended to be a complex and interesting character, these are never developed, and her motives and actions remain unpredictable. Other characters have no real identity, and hardly begin to come alive ... Ingrid Bergman makes a gallant effort with a part ill-conceived and scripted, and calling for a personality and quality which she cannot command.\\" Recent assessments have been more positive. Reviewing the film in 2013 in conjunction with its DVD release as part of The Criterion Collection, Dave Kehr called the film \\"one of the pioneering works of modern European filmmaking.\\" In an expansive analysis of the film, critic Fred Camper wrote of the drama, \\"Like many of cinema's masterpieces, Stromboli is fully explained only in a final scene that brings into harmony the protagonist's state of mind and the imagery. This structure...suggests a belief in the transformative power of revelation. Forced to drop her suitcase (itself far more modest than the trunks she arrived with) as she ascends the volcano, Karin is stripped of her pride and reduced ‚Äî or elevated ‚Äî to the condition of a crying child, a kind of first human being who, divested of the trappings of self, must learn to see and speak again from a personal \\"year zero\\" (to borrow from another Rossellini film title).\\"Camper, Fred. Volcano Girl, film analysis and review. Chicago Reader, 2000. Last accessed: December 31, 2007. The Venice Film Festival ranked Stromboli among the 100 most important Italian films (\\"100 film italiani da salvare\\") from 1942‚Äì1978. In 2012, the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound critics' poll also listed it as one of the 250 greatest films of all time. Box office The film opened Feb. 15, 1950 in the United States and was a box office bomb but did better overseas, where Bergman and Rossellini's affair was considered less scandalous. In all, RKO lost $200,000 on the picture.

It was commissioned in 1660 by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the memory of his first and chief wife Dilras Banu Begum (posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani) and is considered to be a symbol of Aurangzeb's 'conjugal fidelity'. It bears a striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal, the mausoleum of Aurangzeb's mother, Mumtaz Mahal. Aurangzeb was not much interested in architecture though he had commissioned the small, but elegant, Pearl Mosque at Delhi. Bibi Ka Maqbara is the largest structure that Aurangzeb has to his credit. The comparison to the Taj Mahal has often obscured its very own considerable charm. Due to the strong resemblance, it is also called the Dakkhani Taj (Taj of the Deccan). Bibi Ka Maqbara is the \\"principal monument\\" of Aurangabad and its historic city. An inscription found on the main entrance door mentions that this mausoleum was designed and erected by Ata-ullah, an architect and Hanspat Rai, an engineer respectively. Ata-ullah was the son of Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the principal designer of the Taj Mahal. Aurangzeb's son, Azam Shah, was in later years put in charge of overseeing the repair-work of the mausoleum by Aurangzeb.  History  The tomb in the 1880s Dilras Banu Begum was born a princess of the prominent Safavid dynasty of Iran (Persia) and was the daughter of Mirza Badi-uz-Zaman Safavi (titled Shahnawaz Khan), who was the viceroy of Gujarat. She married Prince Muhi-ud-din (later known as Aurangzeb upon his accession) on 8 May 1637 in Agra. Dilras was his first wife and chief consort, as well as his favourite. She bore him five children ‚Äî Zeb-un-Nissa, Zinat-un-Nissa, Zubdat- un-Nissa, Muhammad Azam Shah and Sultan Muhammad Akbar. After giving birth to her fifth child, Muhammad Akbar, Dilras Banu Begum possibly suffered from puerperal fever, due to complications caused by the delivery and died a month after the birth of her son on 8 October 1657. Upon her death, Aurangzeb's pain was extreme and their eldest son, Azam Shah, was so grieved that he had a nervous breakdown. It became Dilras' eldest daughter, Princess Zeb-un-Nissa's responsibility to take charge of her newborn brother. Zeb-un-Nissa doted on her brother a lot, and at the same time, Aurangzeb greatly indulged his motherless son and the prince soon became his best-loved son. In 1660, Aurangzeb commissioned a mausoleum at Aurangabad to act as Dilras' final resting place, known as Bibi Ka Maqbara (\\"Tomb of the Lady\\"). Here, Dilras was buried under the posthumous title of 'Rabia-ud-Daurani' (\\"Rabia of the Age\\"). In the following years, her tomb was repaired by her son Azam Shah under Aurangzeb's orders. Bibi Ka Maqbara was the largest structure that Aurangzeb had to his credit and bears a striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal, the mausoleum of Dilras' mother-in-law, Empress Mumtaz Mahal, who herself died in childbirth. Aurangzeb, himself, is buried a few kilometers away from her mausoleum in Khuldabad. =Construction= Bibi Ka Maqbara is believed to have been built between 1668 and 1669 C.E. According to the \\"Tarikh Namah\\" of Ghulam Mustafa, the cost of construction of the mausoleum was Rs. 668,203-7 (rupees six lakh, sixty-eight thousand, two hundred three and seven annas) ‚Äì Aurangzeb allocated only Rs. 700,000 for its construction. An inscription found on the main entrance door mentions that this mausoleum was designed and erected by Ata-ullah, an architect and Hanspat Rai, an engineer respectively. The marble for this mausoleum was brought from mines near Jaipur. According to Tavernier, around three hundred carts laden with marble, drawn by at least 12 oxen, were seen by him during his journey from Surat to Golconda. The mausoleum was intended to rival the Taj Mahal, but the decline in architecture and proportions of the structure (both due to the severe budgetary constraints imposed by Aurangzeb) had resulted in a poor copy of the latter.

It stands at the centre of a huge enclosure measuring approximately 458 m. N-S X 275 m. E-W. Baradaris or pillared pavilions are located at the centre of north, east and western part of the enclosure wall. The high enclosure wall is crenellated with pointed arched recesses and bastions at regular intervals. The recesses are divided by pilasters, crowned with small minarets. The mausoleum is built on a high square platform with four minarets at its corners, which is approached by a flight of steps from the three sides. A mosque is found to the west of the main structure, a later addition by the Nizam of Hyderabad, resulting in closure of the west entrance. Entry to the mausoleum is through a main entrance gate on its south, which has foliage designs on brass plate on wood covering from the exterior. After passing through the entrance a small tank is provided and a low profile screen wall leads to the main structure. The screened pathway has a series of fountains at its centre. The mausoleum is encased with marble up to the dado level. Above the dado level, it is constructed of basaltic trap up to the base of the dome; the latter is again built of marble. A fine plaster covers the basaltic trap and given a fine polished finish and adorned with fine stucco decorations. The mortal remains of Rabia Daurani are placed below the ground level surrounded by an octagonal jali pierced marble screen with exquisite designs, which can be approached by a descending flight of steps. The roof of this chamber that corresponds to the ground level of the mausoleum is pierced by an octagonal opening and given a low barricaded marble screen. This makes the tomb viewable from the ground level through this octagonal opening. The mausoleum is crowned by a dome pierced with trellis works and accompanying panels decorated with flower designs. The structure is in the form of a hexagon, its angles ornamented with minarets.Qureshi Dulari,\\"Tourism Potential in Aurangabad\\", p.50  Gallery  File:Bibi Ka Maqbara - The Taj Of Deccan.jpgThe tomb at dusk File:Bibi Ka Maqbara By Swapnil Bhiungade.jpgthumbThis picture was captured by Swapnil Bhiungade in the Winter Season.

Life  Margaret George was born in Nashville, Tennessee. Her father joined the U.S. Foreign Service when she was four, and she lived overseas- Taiwan, Israel, and Germany-before she was thirteen. So she was exposed early to historical sites and learned that legends might have historical bases. She graduated from Tufts University with a B.A. and Stanford University with an M.A., co-majoring in biological science and English literature. She worked as a science writer for several years at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland before moving to Madison, Wisconsin with her husband.  Writing career  George speaks in 2020 She began writing at a very early age, composing on yellow lined tablets and illustrating them herself. By middle school, she had begun writing novels, but did not show them to anyone except a few close friends. Only when a book was completely finished did she try for publication. Although she is now known exclusively for historical tomes, she wrote in many genres as she was teaching herself to write. Her first published novel, The Autobiography of Henry VIII (1986), set the pattern. It drew a sympathetic portrait of the notorious king without whitewashing the dishonorable episodes of his life. Almost thirty years after its publication, it is still influential and was at the top of the fans' recommended Henry VIII fiction list for \\"The Tudors\\" miniseries.http://www.thetudorswiki.com/page/Henry+VIII+and+his+Court+-+Fiction+Shelf Her other books show the same key characteristics: careful research almost qualifying for non-fiction standards, enough length to give perspective to the subject's life, and colorful imagery. She says she aims to be on paper what David Lean's films are in visual terms: elegant, detailed, and panoramic. Mary, Called Magdalene (2002) was published a year before Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and was based on the historic facts as far as we know them. Both books struck a chord with a public eager to know more about the enigmatic Mary of Magdala, a close companion of Jesus.Seeing Mary Magdalene as one of the Apostles\\". New York Times.

Premise=Season 1= At the start of the 2005 Australian Football League season, this one-hour panel show was created to air between the Sunday Footy Show and Nine's Sunday AFL game. The panel consisted of Garry Lyon, James Brayshaw and Sam Newman, and in a way it was a sports wrap show in the vein of Wide World of Sports, however the sports results took a back seat to the humour of Sam Newman and James Brayshaw in particular. =Season 2= At the start of 2006, due to Eddie McGuire being appointed CEO of the Nine Network, circumstances meant that the regular team of Brayshaw, Lyon and Newman would be appearing on the revamped Footy Show, meaning that a Sunday-morning show with a similar lineup would be redundant. The show returned in Round 2 of the 2006 season with a different lineup, consisting of comedian Mick Molloy, former swimmer and Nine Network commentator Nicole Livingstone and a rotating third panel member. The first of which was Dermott Brereton. Despite the fact that the show discussed all sorts of sports from around the world, its main focus remained AFL, as it previewed the Sunday matches. It always crossed to a commentator for a live AFL match on Nine. The show was cancelled soon after the 2006 AFL Season.

History Porthmadog has had a number of stations using this name, or the now-archaic anglicised form of Portmadoc. The present station was opened by the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway as Portmadoc on 12 September 1867, and renamed Porthmadog on 5 May 1975. The Festiniog Railway's Porthmadog Harbour railway station was originally only a shunting yard, but was upgraded to a full station on 6 January 1865. It was renamed to Portmadoc Old on 8 June 1923, and then to Portmadoc on 23 July 1955. It was renamed to Porthmadog on 10 March 1973. The Welsh Highland Railway (WH) run a station known as Porthmadog, which opened on 2 August 1980. Although located on High Street, is also (incorrectly) referred to as Tremadog Road. Additionally there were two interim stations either side of, what is now, the Network Rail / WH crossing. These were referred to as Portmadoc New, with the original Festionig Railway station becoming Portmadoc Old. The Festiniog Railway station opened on 8 June 1923 and closed on 16 September 1939, while the WH station opened in May 1929 and closed on 28 September 1936. In 2014, main line services were suspended due to structural problems with the Pont Briwet viaduct near . Network Rail and Gwynedd County Council were carrying out work to build a ¬£20 million replacement for the current bridge a few metres downstream, but in doing so had caused the old one to sink and thus made it unsafe for both rail & road traffic. A replacement bus service operated during the railway's closure. Services Until the line between Bangor and Afonwen closed in 1964 there was a through service in the summer to and from London Euston via Crewe, Chester, Llandudno Junction and Caernarvon; the Pwllheli portion was detached at Afonwen and the forward coaches proceeded to Portmadoc (as it was then known). There was also a summer service between London Paddington and Pwllheli, via Birmingham Snow Hill, Shrewsbury and Machynlleth. Trains currently call at Porthmadog roughly once every two hours Monday - Saturday, with a solitary train stopping in each direction on Sundays during the winter and two additional services each way in the summer (May - mid-September). During the daytime, trains run through to/from and (joining or splitting from a portion to/from ), but in the evening they start/terminate at .

Vasant Ranjane was a 'slightly built, unlikely looking figure for an opening bowler' who relied more on line and length than speed for his wickets,Sujit Mukherjee, Playing for India, Orient Longman (1988) but could 'swing both ways and cut the ball off the seam'.Christopher Martin-Jenkins, The Complete Who's Who of Test cricketers As a young boy, Ranjane used to frequent the grounds of the Shivaji Preparatory School grounds in Poona where Madhusudan Rege used to coach. He put this to practice at the Sangam Wadi Union Club, from where he was picked by the talent scouts of the Vilas Club. This paved the way for playing in the first division and first class cricket.G. Viswanath, The Forgotten Figure, Sportstar, 29 September 1984 Ranjane had a fabulous start to his first class career when he took nine wickets for 35 in an innings on his debut (13 for 71 in the match) including a hat-trick for Maharashtra against Saurashtra in 1956‚Äì57.Scorecard of Maharashtra v Saurashtra, 1956‚Äì57 The role was reversed when he played his first Test two years later against West Indies at Green Park, Kanpur, when his only wicket was the one missed by Subhash Gupte who took 9 for 102. He was recalled to the Test side three years later against England where he took ten wickets in three Tests. This was followed by the tour to West Indies in 1961‚Äì62. Partly due to the presence off too many all- rounders in the side, Ranjane played only in the final Test where he took the wickets of Conrad Hunte, Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers and Frank Worrell. Ranjane came from a very poor background. After his father, who was a factory worker, died when Ranjane was ten, his mother worked as a maid in a hospital to support the family. Ranjane dropped out of the school after the seventh standard. He managed to find a job as a fitter in the Indian Railways where he continued till 1994, but it was hardly sufficient to maintain his six children.Richard Cashman, Patrons, players and the crowd, Orient Longman (1980), p. 92 When his sufferings got exposure in the media in the early 1980s, the Board of Control for Cricket in India allotted him a benefit match at Nagpur between India and the touring West Indies side in 1983. He also received an ex gratia payment from the BCCI when his house was damaged in the floods in Poona in the 1960s. His son Subhash played cricket for Maharashtra.

He was primarily a medium-pace swing bowler, who enjoyed a particularly successful tour of England in 1959. An army officer, he played his domestic cricket for Services in a career that extended from 1955‚Äì56 to 1968‚Äì69.Wisden 2013, p. 241. He came to national prominence in 1958‚Äì59 when, playing for Services, he dismissed the first three West Indian batsmen in a tour match. He followed that up with 6 for 10 against Patiala, and was selected for the Third Test. He took 2 for 168 in the only West Indies innings, the only Indian bowler to take more than one wicket. He then took 7 for 14 and 6 for 62 against Railways,Railways v Services 1958‚Äì59 and retained his position for the Fourth Test. This time he took no wickets in another big West Indian victory, and he lost his place for the Fifth Test. On the tour of England in 1959 he opened the bowling with Ramakant Desai in all five Tests, and took 16 wickets at 26.62 to lead the Indian bowling averages. In the Fourth Test he took 5 for 115 off 47.1 overs in the first innings,England v India, Manchester 1959 and in the Fifth he took 5 for 75 off 51.3 overs in England's only innings, as well as making his highest Test score of 27, adding 58 for the eighth wicket with Naren Tamhane after India had been 74 for 7 in their first innings.England v India, The Oval 1959 \\"For one not too well endowed physically he stood up well to many long spells of bowling,\\" noted Wisden, but he \\"spent hours bowling down the leg side\\" to a packed leg-side field; \\"this happy cricketer would help the game if he developed his attack on the off-stump instead of outside the leg- stump\\".Wisden 1960, p. 265. He played the first two Tests against Australia in 1959‚Äì60 but took only two wickets and was omitted from the Test side.

Cricket career A. K. Sengupta's Test appearance came in the middle of a major controversy in Indian cricket. Ghulam Ahmed announced his retirement a few days before the Madras Test against the West Indies in 1958-59, and Vijay Manjrekar dropped out due to an injury. This led to a confusing situation where Jasu Patel, A. G. Kripal Singh, Manohar Hardikar and Sengupta were all considered. The captain Polly Umrigar wanted Hardikar but when the President of the BCCI insisted that he pick Patel, Umrigar resigned during the night before the match. In the end, Sengupta and Kripal Singh played. Sengupta was dismissed for 1 and 8 by Wes Hall and Roy Gilchrist.Mihir Bose, A History of Indian Cricket, Andre-Deutsch (1990), pp. 213-214 Sengupta was a 'very good allrounder, right hand opening batsman, leg-break and googly bowler and slip field'.Christopher Martin- Jenkins, Who's who of Test cricketers He had made his first-class debut earlier in that season against West Indies. Playing for Services, he scored 32 & 100 not out. Two months later he took 6 for 32 against Delhi on his first appearance in the Ranji Trophy. These two performances had led to the selection for the Test match. He continued to play first-class cricket for ten years. His only other hundred was a 146 not out scored against Bombay in the 1959-60 Ranji Trophy semi-final. Military career He served as an officer in the Indian army and was awarded PVSM and AVSM.

In a career spanning 21 years, he scored 12,367 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 34.16. He coached the Indian cricket team during its tour to Australia in 1991‚Äì92 and the 1992 Cricket World Cup. Biography Born in Hyderabad, British India, Baig made his first-class during the 1954‚Äì55 Ranji Trophy, against Andhra Pradesh. In his next match against Mysore, he scored 105 and 43 not out. At the end of the tournament, he ended up as his team's second-highest run scorer, scoring 187 runs at an average of 62.33. In the late 1950s, Baig moved to England and went up to University College, Oxford. In 1959, he played 15 first-class matches for the university team. During this time, he scored 221 not out and 87 against Free Foresters and broke Derrick De Saram‚Äôs aggregate of 283 runs‚Äî208 and 75‚Äîto become the highest run scorer for the team in a first-class match. It was during this time India toured England. In the fourth match of the series, Baig was \\"summoned\\" to play for India, replacing the injured Vijay Manjrekar. Aged 20 years and 131 days, Baig became the youngest Indian cricketer to score a century on debut when he made 112 in India's second innings. It was also the first century by an Indian debutant outside India. Despite another century from Polly Umrigar, India lost the match. However, Baig retained his place in the team for the final match of the series. He also set the record for becoming the first batsman to score a century in the 4th innings of a test match on test debut. Following the series in England, Baig was included in the Indian squad for the home series against Australia later that year. In the second Test at Kanpur, he scored 19 and 36 runs in both the innings. The match marked India's first Test victory against Australia. In the first innings of the next match at Bombay, he scored 50 and was involved in a crucial 133-run partnership with Nari Contractor. Baig followed that with another half-century in the second innings when he made 58. His half-centuries were helped India secure a draw. During a break in India's second innings, when Baig walked to the pavilion along with Ramnath Kenny, he was kissed on his cheek by a young woman spectator, becoming the first Indian cricketer to be kissed on the field. Vijay Merchant who was commentating then remarked \\"I wonder where all these enterprising young ladies were when I was scoring my hundreds and two hundreds.\\" A painting called \\"The Kissing of Abbas Ali Baig\\", depicting the incident was featured in Salman Rushdie‚Äôs novel The Moor's Last Sigh (1995). Baig's success in the 1959/60 season led to him being named as one of Indian Cricket 's five \\"Cricketers of the Year\\". In the following season, Baig had an unsuccessful outing against Pakistan, managing to score just 34 runs in four innings. This led to him being dropped from the side for the subsequent series. During this time, it was said he received hate mail for under-performing against fellow Muslims. However, he was impressive in the domestic circuit, scoring heavily in the Ranji and Duleep Trophy tournaments. In 1966, he was included in the team for the home series against West Indies. Baig scored 48 runs in two of the Tests he played in the series. He was dropped again and never played Test cricket again. He almost made it to the squad for the 1971 tour of West Indies before being dropped. He was selected in the Indian team that toured England in 1971. However, he was not included in the playing eleven for any of the Tests; Ashok Mankad was preferred to Baig. Baig's three younger brothers‚ÄîMurtuza Baig, Mazhar Baig, and Mujtaba Baig‚Äîall played professional cricket. Murtuza played first-class cricket for Hyderabad but was less successful than Abbas.

Prior to this there was a through service in the summer between Criccieth and London and Birmingham. Services included London Euston via Crewe, Chester, Llandudno Junction and Caernarvon; the Pwllheli portion was detached at Afonwen and the forward coaches proceeded to Portmadoc (the spellings are those used at the time). There was also a summer Saturday service between London Paddington and Pwllheli, via Birmingham Snow Hill, Shrewsbury and Machynlleth. The station originally had two platforms with a passing loop; this was taken out of use when the signal box closed on 16 October 1977, though the redundant track remained in place for several years. The station is now a single-platform, unstaffed halt. The platform is accessible from the High Street, and there is a car park. The main station building is in private use.

Allison's career was overshadowed by the arrival of Don Budge, although he was both a fine singles player and, along with his frequent partner, John Van Ryn, a great doubles player. At the University of Texas at Austin, Allison was the Intercollegiate tennis champion in 1927. One of Allison's earliest tournament wins was the 1928 Canadian Championship, where he won the final over doubles partner Van Ryn 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì3. Career Right-handed, Allison's greatest triumph was winning the 1935 U.S. Championship singles, defeating Fred Perry in the semifinals and Sidney Wood in the finals, both in three sets. He had previously lost to Perry 8‚Äì6 in the fifth set in the 1934 finals. He was ranked U.S. No. 1 both years and World No. 4 in 1932 and again in 1935 by A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph. At the Wimbledon Championships his best results in singles came in 1930 when he finished runner-up to Bill Tilden, losing the final in straight sets. En route to the final he defeated reigning champion and first-seed Henri Cochet in straight sets in the quarterfinals. As a doubles player with partner John Van Ryn, Allison won the 1929 and 1930 Wimbledon and 1935 U.S. doubles championships. Allison's last major tournament was a 1936 quarterfinal loss to Bunny Austin. =Davis Cup= Allison played a total of 44 matches, 29 in doubles with Van Ryn, in Davis Cup for the United States, the third most of any player behind John McEnroe and Vic Seixas. He won 32 of those matches but never the cup. =Playing style= In his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer, who had a fine volley himself, devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He writes: \\"FOREHAND VOLLEY ‚Äî Wilmer Allison of Texas, who won the 1935 Forest Hills, had the best I ever saw as a kid, and I've never seen anyone since hit one better. Budge Patty came closest, then Newcombe\\". George Lott, who himself won five U.S. doubles titles as well as two at Wimbledon, wrote an article in the May 1973, issue of Tennis Magazine in which he ranked the great doubles teams and the great players. He called the team of Allison and Van Ryn the ninth best of all time. Allison was a colonel in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II. He coached tennis for the varsity team of his alma mater from 1946 through 1972 and was head coach from 1957.

Born in Bangalore, Mysore, Muddiah came up through the Mysore University and Mysore State 'B' team. He studied in the Malleswaram Middle and High School and Central College, Bangalore. He later played club cricket for Malleswaram Gymkhana and Friends Union CC. He joined the Indian Air Force in 1948, but was soon found 'unfit for flying'. He left the Air Force and represented Mysore in 1951‚Äì52 but was recalled to the IAF as an Air Traffic Controller in the next year. He went on to become a Wing Commander before taking voluntary retirement in 1979. Muddiah started off a batsman, became a medium pacer and finally an off-spinner. He retained his fifteen step runup even while bowling spin. He had a great start to his first class career when he took 8 for 54 for Services against Southern Punjab in 1949. But for most of his career he had to live in the shadow of Ghulam Ahmed who was the primary Indian off spinner at the time. Muddiah was not selected to the Indian team till Ghulam retired in 1959. Muddiah toured England in 1959, took thirty wickets in first class matches but did not appear in a Test. He failed to take a wicket on Test debut against Australia at Delhi in 1959-60. In his only other appearance, against Pakistan a year later, he took the wickets of Mushtaq Mohammad, Hanif Mohammad and Imtiaz Ahmed and had Wallis Mathias dropped at short-leg by Polly Umrigar. Another chance came against the visiting England team in 1961‚Äì62. Muddiah took 6 for 71 for the North Zone, all the wickets were top-order batsmen. But after an unsuccessful match for Services against MCC on the eve of the fourth Test he was not selected. He retired soon after. Muddiah took 175 wickets in his first class career that lasted until late 1962. One of his more notable performances was for Mysore in the 1951-52 Ranji semifinal against Bombay. After Mysore made 170, Bombay finished the first day on 163 for 1. It rained overnight and Muddiah took six wickets in eight overs to bowl Bombay out for 205 on the second day. Mysore still lost by an innings. He also took 5 for 2 against Jammu and Kashmir in 1961-62. Muddiah had his benefit match in 1980. The Government of Karnataka provided him with of land outside Bangalore where he ran a farm. He had two daughters and a son who is a lieutenant colonel in the Army.

Tim Jeal's work, researched over five years, was first published by Hutchinson in the UK and Yale University Press. It was reviewed by The New York Times. James Casada wrote in a review for Library Journal that it is \\"a balanced, definitive assessment which so far transcends previous treatments as to make them almost meaningless.\\" Sources Although Jeal's earlier biography of David Livingstone had been highly critical, establishing that he had only made a single convert and had failed in many important geographical objectives, Jeal defended Baden-Powell not just against accusations of racism, militarism, but of having starved the Africans at Mafeking and stolen the basic idea for the Boy Scouts. Jeal relied on material from the archives of established Scout organizations and from Baden-Powell's own writings, diaries and private correspondence. He also interviewed Baden-Powell's daughters and traced, along with Scouting colleagues, his last serving private secretary and many members of his domestic staff still alive in the 1980s. His use of the letters written to Olave Baden-Powell by her favourite niece, Christian Davidson, (who lived with the Baden-Powells after her mother's death) enabled him to write in detail about Baden-Powell's relationship with his wife and with his three children. Jeal gives the only detailed account of Baden-Powell's marriage and his tragic relationship with his only son Peter and his disagreements with his daughters about their marriages. Reviews Although Jeal's Baden-Powell \\"transcends previous treatments\\" and is exceptionally well referenced, as a \\"balanced, definitive assessment\\" it has come under criticism from academics who had earlier charged Baden-Powell with militarism. Several of their books and articles on Baden-Powell had become critical and negative since the 1960s, culminating in Michael Rosenthal's The Character Factory (1986), which added to the charge of militarism one of antisemitism. Jeal rebutted these in his chapters 'Character Factory or Helping Hand' (409-415) and 'Baden-Powell and the Dictators' (543-553). The leading scholar and critic, Ian Buruma (international Erasmus Prize Winner 2008), assessed the relative merits of Jeal's and Rosenthal's arguments in the New York Review of Books; and on the charges that the Boy Scouts had been primarily militaristic in inspiration, and Baden-Powell antisemitic in the 1930s, came down on the side of Jeal's vindications both in his original article 'Boys Will be Boys' and in his response to Rosenthal's reply.New York Review of Books 'Boys will be Boys' Ian Buruma 15 March 1990. Michael Rosethal's reply: 'A Bad Scout?' and Buruma's response to this (same newspaper) both 28 June 1990 Allen Warren, a historian, and former provost of Vanbrugh College, York University, also supported Jeal's arguments in both fields in a four-page review.Scouting Magazine December 1989 Paul Fussell in reviewing Jeal's book in the Times Literary Supplement wrote stressing the civic rather than the military motivation behind Baden-Powell's Boy Scouts and opining that Jeal had done 'full justice to Baden-Powell's complexity and contradictions, his military delight and his pacifism, his fondness for groups and his stress on the individual...[and his dictum that] 'the real way to get happiness is giving out happiness to other people.'Fussell, Paul. 'A radical road to happiness' Times Literary Supplement 13 October 1989 =Sexuality= Particular attention in reviews has been given to Jeal's analysis of whether Baden-Powell was homosexual. Nelson Block states: \\"While the professional history community generally considers Jeal's conclusions on this topic to be speculative, the mainstream press seems to have taken them as fact\\". He then notes that there has been no published scholarly critique of Jeal. But Jeal devoted the whole of Chapter Three \\"Men's Man\\" to the subject of his sexuality and quotes from Baden-Powell's own account of his dreams and also considered many other intimate papers before reaching his conclusion that Baden-Powell had been a repressed rather than an active homosexual. Content The book comprises 18 introductory pages, and 670 editorial pages. It has 19 chapters, covering Baden-Powell's life from birth and home, to his Indian and African periods, the work he did on Scouting for boys, and his marriage.

On the traditional 19√ó19 board the opening phase of the game usually lasts between 15 and 40 plies. There is some specialised terminology for go openings. The precise meanings of Japanese language terms is often misunderstood. A go whole-board opening refers to an opening sequence of plays, almost always laid out the standard 19√ó19 go board. Because of the symmetry of the board (eight-fold), there are certain conventions about displaying opening moves traditional in Japan. These do not necessarily apply in China or Korea, but naturally in speaking of an 'opening' one never needs to distinguish openings related by symmetry. The Japanese term for the opening phase of the game is joban, but this is not used in English. Instead it is very common to use fuseki, a Japanese term that has a literal meaning of 'scattering of stones'. This really refers, therefore, to the way the initial plays are distributed around the sides and corners. If the game begins just in one corner, which is rare for high-level play but more common with novices, this is not really fuseki. Also, fuseki may be commonly used as a description for the pattern adopted by Black, the first player, for example for Black 1-3-5. This ignores White 2 and White 4, and so is really a name for a side formation (for example Chinese opening) or perhaps a diagonal formation (for example tasukiboshi, where Black 1 and Black 3 are at 4-4 points in the north-east and south-west corners). The Korean-language term equivalent to fuseki is poseok. There are also go corner openings. There are many thousands of these standard variations known, related to developments in just one 10√ó10 corner of the board. In English, they are almost always called joseki, but one should be aware that joseki is not a synonym of corner opening, but of standard sequence. That is because the literal meaning in Japanese is of set (i.e. fixed or settled) stones. There are joseki in Go that do not relate to the corner openings. The Korean term equivalent to joseki is jeongseok, often transliterated jungsuk. In Japanese the 10-10 point on the board (i.e. the center) is called tengen. An opening play at tengen is a kind of experimental opening, and has at times in history been controversial. It may lead to what is called mirror go, in Japanese manego, in which Black imitates White by playing diagonally opposite with respect to the centre stone. There is another style, also called mirror go, where from the beginning of the game White imitates Black in a diagonally- opposite way. The first kind was interesting, for strong players, before the introduction of komidashi, i.e. compensation points for second play. The second kind became interesting only after the introduction of komidashi. Go opening strategy is the strategy applied in Go opening. There are some conventional divisions that are applied. Firstly there is the distinction that may be drawn between go opening theory, the codified variations that resemble chess openings in the way that they occur repeated in games, and go opening principles. Since there is great freedom of choice, the fundamental opening principles are more useful for all players before they reach dan player level. Basic principles Examples of principles that are generally useful are comments such as 'corner-side-centre', which says that the corner areas of the board are more valuable than the sides (points near an edge but away from the corners). Occupying points in the centre may be good for early fighting, but these points are weaker from the aspect of developing one's territory. Developments over the last century The opening strategy in Go can be said to have undergone some major changes in the twentieth century. Not only have new joseki been developed, but some important shifts in thinking have occurred. For example: *from 1900 to 1930 the strategy was traditional, the so-called Shusaku style *in 1933 and for a few years afterwards, a very different and experimental style called shinfuseki dominated professional go, at least for the younger players *from around 1936 there was a compromise of styles, sugou fuseki, which mixed some of the more successful ideas from shinfuseki with older techniques for a more balanced approach, forming the basis of modern professional play *the introduction of komidashi of 4.5 points in most top tournaments of the 1950s led to a tighter, territorial style for Black, for example in Sakata Eio, with greater use of the 3-3 point for White also. *the Chinese opening dominated thinking from the early 1970s, and many further ideas were tried, for example the mini-chinese formation which is a side opening, rather than a corner opening or whole-board opening *the entry of South Korean professionals into international competitions in the early 1990s saw the use of 'prepared variations' of whole-board openings, in a way not seen before. Contemporary ideas Contemporary Go opening strategy is more complicated than the old corner opening/whole-board opening distinction suggests. The 4-4 point is used by professionals in about 70% of corners. Corner openings for the 4-4 point are still being developed, but it is more accurate to say that almost all contemporary opening theory is implicated in the patterns around the 4-4 point. Fuseki The Japanese term fuseki is sometimes taken as synonymous with 'whole-board strategy'. More accurately, it means the 'scattering' or thin distribution of stones that occurs in the early part of the game. In the game of Go, opening theory is the strategy of where, why, in what order, and in what shapes the first several moves are played in Go opening.The opening is normally around 20 ply long. The middle game typically begins once the basic foundational areas called frameworksFramework in English translates to moyo in Japanese. are established and \\"fighting\\" begins.This occurs when moves directly attack an opponent's weak groups, with the serious possibility of killing it. The opening is conceptually and traditionally divided for study into the sequences that are whole board openings The Japanese term fuseki is also current in English. and those that are corner openings.Joseki in Japanese, meaning 'set pattern', is current in English usage. Each type constitutes a series of plays which have been studied for their balance (with the other) as well as for countermoves. For a standard board,I.e. a 19x19 line goban; essentially no theory for smaller boards gets into print. the most basic single concept for the opening is that plays in the corners are more efficient for making territory than plays on the sides or in the center. Only a relatively small proportion of openings have a recognised name. These include the Three stars opening (sanrensei), Two stars opening (nirensei), \\"Pinwheel\\" or Shusaku opening and Chinese opening (Chinese fuseki). To be more precise, these are names for the moyo (framework) formations which Black makes on one side of the board. Since White has a choice of perhaps two dozen legitimate variations on the other side, these are in fact large complexes of openings. The Chinese opening has an intricate history. According to several historical accounts (both Chinese and Japanese), it was actually first developed by Japanese players, but later was heavily researched and developed by Chinese players. It was very popular from about 1970 onwards, and has by Go standards a thoroughly-researched theory.  J≈çseki  Joseki are \\"sequences\\" of moves which have been * played and documented in high-level play, and * studied and deemed as consisting of optimal (balanced) moves for both sides. Joseki is a Japanese word (ÂÆöÁü≥) (Korean jeongseok), where jo (ÂÆö) means \\"fixed\\" or \\"set\\", and seki (Áü≥) means stone(s). It thus literally means \\"set stones\\", as in \\"set pattern\\". Variations are shown to lead to different positional advantages and disadvantages for the two players in certain overall game situations. If Black and White both play the joseki correctly, they should achieve a balanced result within that particular corner; neither should have a large advantage, unless the opponent makes a mistake.On the other hand, the evaluation of the result as fair has to take into account both who started in the corner, and who ended the sequence. The first player in a corner expects some advantage; the last player loses the initiative. \\"Balance\\" typically refers to an equitable trade-off between securing territory in the corner versus making good thickness toward the sides and center. The assessment also takes into account who started and ended the corner sequence: if Black has played one more stone than White in the corner, for example, Black's result should be objectively better than White's, to reflect the extra investment of a play. In application these concepts are in fact very dynamic, and often joseki are deviated from depending on the needs of the situation, and the opportunities available. While learning joseki is a tool to defend against a local loss, players can seek to take advantage by deviating from the joseki, or \\"pausing\\" it. Usually joseki as a term (in literature in English) is applied to a set sequence happening in one corner in the opening stage. These sequences are not the only set sequences in the game, however. There are also joseki seen in the middle game: these include standard follow-ups to earlier joseki. Other examples are common techniques for invading or reducing frameworks. Learning to apply these so-called \\"middle game joseki\\" is one of the steps to becoming strong.See Sakata Eio, The Midde Game of Go: Chubansen for examples. \\"Middle game joseki\\" may not correspond to any definite concept translated from the Japanese technical vocabulary, however, since they may simply be classified as known \\"techniques\\". The current body made up of joseki is not fixed, but consists of patterns that have gained acceptance in professional games. That is, they form a consensus judgement that might change in the future, or with certain caveats. Hence the basic definition may be misleading for new players in that joseki can be misconstrued as foolproof and unalterable, and are otherwise optimal for all situations. Some joseki are in fact useful only for study within an artificially confined corner, and in real play are only considered good form when used in proper combination with other plays on the board (i.e. other joseki and fuseki moves). Knowing a particular joseki simply means that one knows a sequence of moves, resulting in a balance or fair trade-off between their positions. This is in practice much easier than appraising how joseki relate to the rest of the board hence knowledge of joseki is regarded as shallow, when compared with the ability to integrate a strategy into a complex game landscape. There is a go proverb that states that \\"learning joseki loses two stones in strength,\\" meaning that rote learning of sequences is not advantageous. Rather learning from joseki should be a player's goal. Hence the study of joseki is regarded as a double-edged sword and useful only if learned not by rote but rather by understanding the principles behind each move. Every joseki should be used as a specific tool that leaves the board in a particular shape. Just as using an improper tool in machinery can be devastating, choosing the wrong joseki can easily be worse than improvising one's own moves. In his book A Way of Play for the 21st Century, Go Seigen compared choosing the proper joseki to choosing the proper medicine pick the right one, and you feel better. Pick the wrong one and you die.(par.) Rui Naiwei similarly remarked that playing joseki is easy [but] choosing the right one [in a game] is hard.(par.) A joseki may fall out of use for various reasons, some of which may often seem minor to the amateur player, and professionals may consider one variation suboptimal for a very specific reason. There is no definitive guide to what is joseki; the situation with joseki dictionaries is similar to that of natural language dictionaries, in that some entries are obsolete and the listing is not likely to be complete. Studying joseki is only an important part of developing one's strength as a player at some levels; the study of life and death and middle- game fighting are considered to be more important.  Concepts  Opening theory is less dominant in terms of study for those wanting to reach a good amateur level, than in chess or shogi. It is, however, an important component of Go knowledge, though there is no single, codified source for it.There are 'joseki dictionaries' and 'fuseki dictionaries'. The largest joseki dictionaries contain around 50000 variations; the usual estimate is that a professional player would know about 10% of that number of corner opening lines. Fuseki dictionaries have never been produced in any comparable degree of comprehensiveness; the Large Fuseki Dictionary (Â∏ÉÁü≥Â§ß‰∫ãÂÖ∏) of the Nihon Ki-in has around 1000 representative openings. The standard sequences for the joseki in many cases come to a definite end, after which both players should move elsewhere. In some cases a sharp local struggle breaks out, which neither player should neglect. For those cases, the result of the opening may develop out of a 10√ó10 corner area into the rest of the board. Analysis without taking into account what other stones are in place then becomes somewhat meaningless. The longest 'book' corner openings are about 50-ply.There are some localised variations of this length in the kado variation of the nikkentakabasami, and in the taisha, where in fact a ko fight may arise. Most corner openings do not have special or picturesque names. A few that do are known by Japanese names: the taisha, the nadare (avalanche), the Magic sword of Muramasa. These are among the most complex, and are contraindicated for novices.  History  Go openings have been studied in depth for many centuries, and center upon concepts of finding balance with the opponent. Because black moves first, opening moves for black are based on the concept of exploiting that first-move advantage (along with sente) to gain influence (or strength) and thus establish areas of territory. There is no complete theory of go, simply because the number of possible variations makes any literal study impossible. Hence even the opening is subject to changes of fashion, and also some notable periods of innovation. Certain professional players are known for their use of specific or innovative types of openings, and their ability to combine their use of those openings with other strengths in competitive play. The 10-10 point Go Seigen played his third move (Black 5) on tengen, in a 1933 game against Honinbo Shusai, the top player of the time. Go lost the controversial 4-month game, which was played over 14 sessions in a ryokan in Tokyo from 16 October 1933 to 19 January 1934.http://senseis.xmp.net/?GameOfTheCentury References ","title":"Go opening"},{"id":"3955720","text":"Vaman Viswanath Kumar , often known as V.

It can also refer to the occipital operculum, part of the occipital lobe. The insular lobe is a portion of the cerebral cortex that has invaginated to lie deep within the lateral sulcus. It sits like an island (the meaning of insular) almost surrounded by the groove of the circular sulcus and covered over and obscured by the insular opercula. A part of the parietal lobe, the frontoparietal operculum, covers the upper part of the insular lobe from the front to the back. The opercula lie on the precentral and postcentral gyri (on either side of the central sulcus). The part of the parietal operculum that forms the ceiling of the lateral sulcus functions as the secondary somatosensory cortex.  Development  Normally, the insular opercula begin to develop between the 20th and the 22nd weeks of pregnancy. At weeks 14 to 16 of fetal development, the insula begins to invaginate from the surface of the immature cerebrum of the brain, until at full term, the opercula completely cover the insula., as cited in note 3 of This process is called opercularization.Cheng-Yu Chen, Robert A.

For instance, the purchase of a ski mask, which can conceal identity, is generally a legal act but may be an overt act if it is purchased in the planning of a bank robbery. The term is more particularly employed in cases of treason, which must be demonstrated by some overt or open act in some jurisdictions.

From time to time, proposals were made to reintroduce in the English parliamentary system a practice that was almost universally adopted in other countries, that of paying a state salary to members of the legislative body. In the earlier history of the English parliament the payment of commoners or representatives of the people was for long the practice. They had first been summoned to the great council of the realm in 1265 in the reign of Henry III. The shires and boroughs they represented paid them for their services, and reimbursed the expenses they were put to in journeying to and from the place of meeting. In 1322, by a statute of Edward II, the salary of a knight was fixed at 4 shillings a day, and that of a citizen or burgher at 2 shillings a day. These payments could be enforced by writs issued after the dissolution of each parliament, and there were many instances of the issue of such writs down to the reign of Henry VIII; while the last known instance is that of one Thomas King, who in 1681 obtained a writ for his salary against the corporation of Harwich. The practice of the payment of members of parliament gradually fell into desuetude, and in the second parliament of Charles II, strong disapproval was expressed of the practice. Its gradual abandonment was due first to the difficulty of securing representatives in the early parliaments. Men of business were unwilling to detach themselves from their affairs, as travel was slow and dangerous; in addition to the perils of the journey there was the almost certain knowledge that a safe return from parliament would be followed by the ill-will of the member's neighbours, for every meeting of parliament was but a device on the part of the sovereign for inflicting some new form of taxation, and a refusal to vote such taxation was but to incur the royal displeasure. The towns themselves were equally disinclined to bear the burden of their members maintenance. In the United Kingdom, the House of Commons had on various occasions carried resolutions in favour of the principle, more especially on the 24 March 1893 (by 276 votes to 229), and on 22 March 1895 (by 176 to 158). On these occasions, the resolutions simply specified an adequate allowance; but on 7 March 1906, a resolution was carried (by 348 votes to 110) in favour of an allowance at the rate of ¬£300 per annum, prior to that, the amount was 40 guineas per annum.

A taxonomic system is a coherent whole of taxonomic judgments on circumscription and placement of the considered taxa. It is only a \\"system\\" if it is applied to a large group of such taxa (for example, all the flowering plants). There are two main criteria for this list. A system must be taxonomic, that is deal with many plants, by their botanical names. Secondly it must be a system, i.e. deal with the relationships of plants. Although thinking about relationships of plants had started much earlier (see history of plant systematics), such systems really only came into being in the 19th century, as a result of an ever-increasing influx from all over the world of newly discovered plant species. The 18th century saw some early systems, which are perhaps precursors rather than full taxonomic systems. A milestone event was the publication of Species Plantarum by Linnaeus which serves as the starting point of binomial nomenclature for plants. By its size this would qualify to be on this list, but it does not deal with relationships, beyond assigning plants into genera. Note that a system is not necessarily monolithic and often goes through several stages of development, resulting in several versions of the same system. When a system is widely adopted, many authors will adopt their own particular version of the system. The Cronquist system is well known for existing in many versions.

This railway station is an unstaffed halt on the Cambrian Coast Railway with passenger services to Pwllheli, Porthmadog, Harlech, Barmouth, Machynlleth and Shrewsbury. For many years the station served the large Butlins Holiday Camp at Penychain. History The station opened on 31 July 1933 as a halt. Butlin's built the adjacent camp in 1940 at the request of the Admiralty to serve as HMS Glendower, a Royal Navy training base.The National Archives, Kew. ADM 1/10431 After the end of the war the camp opened in March 1947 as Butlin's Pwllheli holiday camp and the halt was upgraded to a station on 3 April 1947. The station was particularly busy in the 1950s and early 1960s when most holidaymakers arrived at the camp either by train or coach. Following the closure of the railway line from Caernarfon to Afonwen Junction (about two miles east of Penychain) and the growing popularity of the motor car, fewer campers arrived by train from the mid-1960s onwards. The station was almost universally referred to as 'penny-chain' by non-Welsh speaking holidaymakers. Meanwhile, Butlins had their own road-going 'Puffing Billy' train to ferry Campers to/from the main railway station on Saturdays. This was also used for trips around the camp on other days. The holiday camp was divided into two halves by the railway. A single-span over-bridge connected the South Camp to the West, Middle, and East Camp areas which were located to the north of the railway line. Penychain station also had its own signal box located just beyond the end of the platform - in the picture shown here. Although much reduced in size, and now with only a single platform, it is still open and now serves the Haven Holiday Park and caravan park on the former Butlins site. The station was destaffed in 1960s and trains only call by request. Facilities An electronic departure board, with announcements of incoming trains, was installed in 2012. Services Trains call every two hours each way, with most southbound services running through beyond to and Birmingham New Street. A limited service (3 each way in summer, just one in winter) operates on Sundays.

It comes from the Latin gerundive , plural , \\"that which is to be added,\\" from Cassell's Latin Dictionary ed. Marchant & Charles (). (Cf. memorandum, agenda, corrigenda). Specific uses=In books= An addendum may explain inconsistencies or expand the existing work or otherwise explain or update the information found in the main work, especially if any such problems were detected too late to correct the main work. For example, the main work could have had already been printed and the cost of destroying the batch and reprinting it deemed too high. As such, addenda may come in many forms‚Äîa separate letter included with the work, text files on a digital medium, or any similar carrier. It may serve to notify the reader of errors present, as errata. =In contracts and other legal documents= In other documents, most importantly in legal contracts, an addendum is an additional document not included in the main part of the contract. It is an ad hoc item, usually compiled and executed after the main document, which contains additional terms, obligations or information. An Additional Agreement to a contract is often an addendum to a contract and is simply referred to as being an extension or addition to a main contract. In today's business world additional authorisation subjects such as company seals are not usually required unless stipulated in the original agreement. It is to be distinguished from other appendices to a contract which may contain additional terms, specifications, provisions, standard forms or other information which have been separated out from the main body of the contract. These are called: an appendix (general term), an annex (which includes information, usually large texts or tables, which are independent stand-alone works which have been included in the contract, such as a tax table, or a large excerpt from a book), or an exhibit (often used in court cases), Similarly an attachment is used usually for e-mails, while an enclosure is used with a paper letter. Addenda are often used in standard form contracts to make changes or add specific detail. For example, an addendum might be added to a contract to change a date or add details as to delivery of goods or pricing. The addendum should be referenced in the contract, or the contract should be referenced in the addendum, so that it is clear which contract the addendum is modifying. A rider is often used to add specific detail and especially specific conditions to a standard contract such as an insurance contract. A rider may also be added to a piece of legislation. Schedules and exhibits are sub-categories of addenda, with schedules being related to numerical and time information, such as pricing and time-schedules, and exhibits used for examples of standard forms or additional information necessary for the parties to understand and/or comply with their contractual obligations. Outside of contract law, exhibits are often used in legal documents filed with a court as part of judicial proceedings such as motions, briefs and the submission of different types of evidence for inclusion in the record of trial of a particular case. =In legal judgments= Juries in inquests or trials may amplify or explain their decisions by issuing a commentary known as a rider, as in the prosecution of Harold Greenwood and the inquest of Jean Charles de Menezes. =In medical transcription= Addendum is also used if the medical care staff is inserting additional information about the patient. =In engineering= The addendum is the radial distance from the pitch circle of a cogwheel, worm wheel, etc., to the crests of the teeth or ridges.

History Opened by the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway, then run by the Cambrian Railways, it became part of the Great Western Railway. The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways until the Privatisation of British Railways. It was upgraded in 1933 to station status but in 1956 reverted to an unstaffed halt. The station was host to a GWR camp coach from 1936 to 1939.McRae (1997), page 31Fenton (1999), pages 83-85 From 1952 to 1964 there was a British Railways Camping coach located in the small siding on the northern side of the railway line; on the right-hand (west) side of the level-crossing when approaching the beach. The single-carriage Camping Coach was usually only located here during the summer months and would be rented out to families for holidaying purposes. Timber access stairways were provided to the coach from the side away from the railway line as there was no permanent platform associated with this siding.McRae (1998), pages 112 & 123 Abererch Halt, as it was referred to, did possess a timber constructed 'Waiting Room' up to the mid-1960s but this was destroyed by fire one evening when the felted roof (allegedly) caught fire from the hot-ashes discharged by a passing steam-hauled train. Other incidents witnessed at the station include severe damage to the railway crossing gates by locomotives when the gates had been left 'open' to vehicular traffic - usually overnight. There used to be a crossing-keeper's cottage on the northern side of the railway line. The crossing-keeper would open and close the level-crossing gates between each train; principally to let holiday makers to/from the sandy Abererch beach and the adjacent caravan/camping site. The single-storey cottage was externally slate-clad throughout and was situated on the left-hand (east) side when approaching the beach from the A497 Pwllheli - Porthmadog road. British Rail requested the permission of the Secretary of State for Transport to close Abererch and three other Cambrian Coast stations (namely Llandecwyn, Tygwyn and Tonfanau) during the mid-1990s. Their winter 1995/96 timetable featured only two northbound and three southbound trains Mondays to Saturdays, with a note that the service may be withdrawn before 1 June 1996.Regional Railways Central: \\"Cambrian Coaster Train Times\\", September 1995 The station was retained and service levels have since increased. Since 22nd June 2020, trains have not called at the station due to the short platform and the inability to maintain social distancing between passengers and the guard when opening the train door.https://tfwrail.wales/covid-19/changes-train-times  Services  This railway station is an unstaffed halt on the Cambrian Coast Railway with passenger services every 2 hours (Mon-Sat) calling at all stations between Machynlleth and , including Tywyn, , Harlech and Porthmadog.

Kingscote also competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.Algernon Robert Fitzhardinge Kingscote, British Olympic Association. He was born in Bangalore, India, in 1888. Tennis career Algernon Kingscote learned playing tennis on the courts of the Ch√¢teau-d'≈íx Club in Switzerland, where he won numerous championships. In his early years he trained with American teenager player R. Norris Williams.Tilden (1921), p. 189 He was crowned Swiss champion in 1908 and champion of Bengal in 1913. He held the Kent Championships title for four consecutive years between 1919‚Äì1922 and in total won the title six times. At Wimbledon 1919, Kingscote beat William Laurentz, Max Decugis and Pat O'Hara Wood before losing in the all comers final to Gerald Patterson. He won the singles title at the 1919 Australasian Championships, along with the first Anthony Wilding Memorial Medal, beating Eric Pockley of New South Wales in the final in straight sets. In the 1920 Wimbledon Championships he reached the doubles final alongside James Cecil Parke but eventually lost to the team of Garland‚ÄìWilliams. In 1921 Kingscote was a runner-up at the Monte-Carlo Championships losing to fellow countryman Gordon Lowe in four sets. He represented Great Britain in the Davis Cup seven times between 1919 and 1924 compiling a 9‚Äì8 win-loss record. In the 1922 Wimbledon Championships first round against Leslie Godfree they established the routine of saluting the Royal Box by bowing in front of it, a tradition that was in effect to 2003. He won the Queen's Club Championships in 1924 beating Gordon Lowe in four sets in the final. =Playing style= U.S. Championships quarterfinalist American Dean Mathey described his style as \\"well rounded\\" in 1920 at the time when he was considered the best British outdoors player. He favored volleying and had good ground strokes. His service was fair but his game lacked speed and strength. The next year professional world number one player Bill Tilden agreed with Mathey that his game is well rounded but lacks speed. He described his hitting as well-paced,Tilden (1921), p. 14 his service as a fast sliced, well placed, paced, twisted and cleverly disguised and his style as a defensive one relying mostly on his half-volley baseline returns.Tilden (1921), p. 42 He dedicated Kingscote's court positioning and good volleying skills as a compensation for Kingscote's rather short appearance.Tilden (1921), p. 45 Kingscote adapted to the combination of net attack and baseline game, which Tilden praised as a key factor of successful tennis style.Tilden (1921), p. 103-104 His favorite shot was the cross court forehand shot. His backhand was steady, accurate and deceptive. Personal life Algernon Kingscote was born on 3 December 1888 to Lieutenant-Colonel Howard Kingscote (b. 29 Apr 1845, d. 17 Mar 1917) and famous novelist Adeline Wolff known as Lucas Cleeve. He had two siblings, Henry Robert Fitzhardinge Kingscote (b. 1 Oct 1887) and Iris Adeline Harriett Augusta Kingscote (b. 5 Aug 1886, d. 8 Jun 1970). Like his father he joined the army in 1910 serving for the Royal Garrison Artillery. He was a Second Lieutenant when stationing at Plympton, Devon in 1911. He was engaged in World War I where he fought at the First Battle of the Aisne earning the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and the award of Military Cross. After the war he went back competing in tennis tournaments and was appointed the captain of the Great Britain Davis Cup team, while still serving in the army as a colonel. He married Marjorie Paton Hindley, daughter of Douglas C. P. Hindley, on 9 September 1919, and had two daughters Rachel and Marjorie and later a son David, who died on 5 September 1945 at age 20 at Burma, killed in action. At the age of 52 at the outbreak of World War II he was sent back to action again. He died on 21 December 1964 Woking, Surrey, Great Britain.

The ability to control distractions and stay focused is essential to produce higher quality results. A research conducted by Stanford shows that single-tasking is more effective and productive than multi-tasking. Different studies have been conducted in using Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for supporting attention, and in particular, models have been elaborated for supporting attention.  Background  The scarcity of attention is the underlying assumption for attention management; the researcher Herbert A. Simon pointed out that when there is a vast availability of information, attention becomes the more scarce resource as human beings cannot digest all the information.The Economist profile on Herbert Simon (20th of march, 2009). Accesssed May 13th, 2017. http://www.economist.com/node/13350892 Fundamentally, attention is limited by the processing power of the brain. Applying information theory, estimates from Hungarian-American psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and engineer Robert Lucky expect the processing capacity of the human conscious mind to be around 120 bits per second; listening to a person speak requires about 60 bits per second of processing; this implies you can barely comprehend two people speaking at the same time. According to German physiologist Manfred Zimmermann, the human sensory system can pick up information at a much higher rate: he estimates a channel capacity of 10 million bits/s for the eyes alone, 1 million bits/s for the skin and 100 000 bits/s for the aural channel while conscious perception can cover only a small fraction of this. Consequently, the brain needs to employ mental filters to determine the most important information needing to be processed. Most of these filtering processes happen automatically and beyond conscious awareness. Limitations of attention capacities are revealed in many contexts, for example when speaking on a telephone while driving. The resulting high-frequency switching between processing of visual and auditory input is proven to constrict recognition of important information; driver‚Äôs reactions to cars breaking in front of them are affected, so is recollection of roadside billboards. Attention is also limited by the resources available to the neurons in the brain that enable humans to maintain focus as all processed information contributes to mental fatigue. Estimates suggest that the daily information input of an American in 2011 was five times as high as that in 1986. Therefore, according to Maura Thomas, attention management is the most important skill for the 21st century. With digital revolution and the advent of internet and communication devices, time management is no longer enough to guarantee a good quality of work. Allocating time to perform one activity does not mean that it will receive attention if constant interruptions and distractions come across. Therefore, people should stop worrying about time management and focus on attention management. Beside the implications on work and productivity, attention management can also be applied with regard to other areas such as happiness. British behavioral scientist Paul Dolan identifies the allocation of attention as a key component in improving personal well-being. Life events only affect the individual to the extend he or she is attending to it; illnesses are perceived as worse if they are more salient and repeatedly expose a person to new negative stimuli. Consequently managing attention and focusing on things that make the individual happy is one of Dolan‚Äôs approaches towards greater happiness.  Attention Problems  Supporting the management of attention the objective is to bring a certain number of solutions to attention problems. A selection of these problems are: *people perception cognitive limitations - Such as the limited capacity of the human short-term memory (an average number of 4 items can be managed at a given time), or the theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships (the Dunbar's number of 150). *information overload - The process of taking in too much information in ways that inhibit decision making. *social interaction overload - (that may for instance originate from the online social networking services from which people get a lot of solicitations) *interruption - This takes a significant toll on attention. According to Tabboush, people who are interrupted or distracted by chronic pain do significantly worse on attention tasks. *multitasking \\\\- Multitasking is a very important subject to attention and there seems to be conflicting evidence on both sides of the argument. These arguments go back and forth because there are many variables involved with multitasking. In some instances, multitasking two activities such as walking and breathing are second nature, and if someone has had practice performing several tasks simultaneously, multitasking would also increase productivity. However, a meta-analysis has been performed by Caid, Johnston, Willness, Asbridge, and Steel indicating that multitasking texting and driving results in poorer attention. *Attention Residue ‚Äì An individual needs to completely abandon a task in order to fully focus on a secondary task. However, humans experience difficulties switching and moving their attention between multiple activities  Applications = Distracting from pain = Attention management can play a key role in helping people manage pain by focusing their attention elsewhere while experiencing acute pain. However, this must be done strategically, as the most important factor in being a good distractor seems to be that the activity is engaging and interesting for an individual. This changes on a case-by-case basis and must be tailored to the patient. For example, if a person routinely struggles with reading and it routinely disinterests them, giving that person a book would not be a good distractor for when they are suffering from pain. According to a study by Jameson, Trevena, and Swain, participants who were subjected to pain by submerging one of their hands into ice-cold water were able to deal with the pain longer, reported less pain, and less anxiety when they were playing video games than if they were watching television or doing nothing. This study helps the assertion that participating in something engaging and interesting will help to distract from a painful or uncomfortable stimulus. = Mindfulness training = Mindfulness training can be helpful in attention management. Made famous in the 1970s by Professor Jon Kabat-Zinn‚Äôs Mindfulness-based stress reduction. Mindfulness-based stress reduction is an intense program of training to help students understand and regulate emotions and patterns of behavior. This kind of training is helpful for people to be more aware of what they are focusing on. According to a study by Jensen, Vangkilde, Frokjaer, and Hasselbalch, mindfulness training is much more effective at reducing stress than nonmindfulness training, i.e. relaxation training. The study also found that those who had participated in mindfulness-training tended to perform better at attentional tasks. Thus, mindfulness training may have a positive effect on attention management.  Strategies  Tools can be designed for supporting attention * at the organizational level, by supporting organization processes. * at the collective level * at the individual level, for instance using attentive user interfaces. * at the individual level by helping people to assess and analyze their attention related practices (for instance with the tool AttentionScape ). These tools are often adaptive hypermedia, and often rely on profiling the user in order determine how to better support people's attention. Research distinguishes between autonomous reactions to sensory stimuli (stimulus-driven) and deliberate direction of attention (goal-driven). Correspondingly, attention management can focus on the alteration of external and internal factors. = External Factors = Attention management strategies commonly include the minimization of interruptions as a variety of evidence suggests that eliminating distractions increases productivity. For example, a series of studies has demonstrated that productivity at the workplace is generally higher on days with bad weather due to the absence of distracting thoughts about outdoor activities experienced in good weather. Diverted attention can result in reduced performance and stress; research has shown that interruption can cause higher completion time, double task error rate as well as increase the annoyance of the individual. Interruptions are also proven to contribute to higher anxiety. Notifications from electronic devices are some of the most common external stimuli causing distraction and studies indicate that social pressure frequently leads to immediate handling of these interruptions. Thus, attention management is considered a field of rising importance in ubiquitous computing and application design. Digital attention management systems utilizing machine learning recognize phases in which interruptions are counterproductive for the user and delay notifications. Beside utilizing digital systems, strategies minimizing interruptions and irrelevant information can also incorporate human resources in form of secretaries, consultants and other assisting employees; this is common practice observable in higher executive levels of companies and in politics. = Internal Factors = A goal of attention management is to reach the highest level of unobstructed attention and focus, at state widely referred to as flow. The term, coined by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, describes a state of full involvement in a task, essentially a level of absorption where the individual forgets about everything but the current activity, even the own existence; all conscious processing capacity is devoted to the task. Characteristic for that state is the underlying intrinsic motivation; staying focused seemingly doesn‚Äôt require any additional energy and one experiences motivation to pursue the activity purely for the sake of the activity itself. Correspondingly, psychologist Adam Grant views inducing motivation as an integral part of attention management.

Generally the term refers to an overall sense of social space typical of a time, place or culture. Cognitive maps are one aspect of spatialization, which also includes everyday practice, institutionalized representations (i.e., maps, see cartography) and the imagination of possible spatial worlds (as in the visual puns of the work of the Surrealist painter, Ren√© Magritte). See also geographical space, Henri Lefebvre. The origins of the term are in Rob Shields's 1985 Introduction to a Pr√©cis of Henri Lefebvre's La Production de l'espace.Shields, Rob A Pr√©cis of La Production de l'espace University of Sussex Urban and Regional Studies Working Paper. Introduction where social spatialization is proposed as an English translation of Henri Lefebvre's French term \\"l'espace\\". However, Shields embues the concept with a sense of being a general, socio-cultural attribute, as in the work of Michel Foucault who makes one mention of the term but does not theorize it) rather than a spatial regime that is dialectically produced as part of a Marxist mode of production.Lefebvre, Henri La Production de l'espace, Ed. Anthropos, 1974. Social spatializations are virtual but manifestly material, in discourse and as frames through which problems are understood.Shields, Rob The Virtual Routledge 2003. Following Foucault they are cultural formations relevant at many scales, from gestures and bodily comportment to geopolitical relationships between States (see also Critical geopolitics). On one hand, spatializations are achieved, hegemonic regimes which place and space activities in sites and regions. But on the other hand, spatializations are continually in change as they depend on and reflect peoples' ongoing performative actualizations of these spatial orders or regimes. However they are contested and the focus of struggles over the meaning of places, or manners, or over the reputation of neighbourhoods. Spatializations are therefore both ways of fixing in place cultural values and important social meanings, but also change over time. Globalization is an example of the changing spatialization of the world. Examples might include cases where a region becomes stereotyped and idolized as part of the identity of a nation state or culture: the Canadian North (Arctic) and Canadian identity; Karelia and Finnish identity. These are often taken up in the media, for example the British North and late 20th-century British working class identity portrayed in the long-running television series Coronation Street. These place-images and regional- and place-myths take on meanings through their similarity or difference from other places people know. Spatialization is argued to be a regime of \\"spacings\\" and \\"placings\\" of people and activities. Given activities or behaviours are related to \\"places-for-this\\" and \\"places-for-that.\\" Several typical spatializations can be detected: centre-margin, mosaics of different identities, binary divisions (black-white, civilized-barbarian, etc.), near-far continua (local-foreign). Spatialization offers a way of talking about how place-images and regional- and place-myths, cognitive mappings and so on are part of wider \\"formations\\" and come to have an economic impact by being put into practice, such as through the marketing of tourism destinations, and the way that the reputations of places and regions becomes a conceptual shorthand which lends credibility to claims and beliefs, such as the truthfulness of a scientific finding (e.g., \\"Cambridge\\" - whether USA or UK), the believability of a religious claim or an event (e.g., \\"Mecca\\"), or the trustworthiness of a product (e.g., \\"Swiss\\" watches). For these reasons, the identities of places are durable and city-marketing fails, place-marketing does not work or city-branding is unsuccessful: the entire network of place-myths has to be reworked if one place-myth is to be altered relative to others. Spatializations are important for governance by linking affect and emotion to place and region. They can be referenced in architecture and interior design, for example, in escapist consumer environments such as the West Edmonton MallSocial Spatialisation and the Built Environment: The Case of the West Edmonton Mall, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 7:2 (Summer) 1989. pp. 147‚Äì164.

Best known for his humor and pragmatism, Dinadan is a close friend of the protagonist Tristan.  In medieval literature  Dinadem's left Like Palamedes and Lamorak, Dinadan was an invention of the Prose Tristan (a variant of the legend of Tristan and Iseult), and appeared in later retellings including the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. He is the son of Brunor senior (the Good Knight without Fear), a brother of his fellow Knights of the Round Table, Breunor le Noir and Daniel. Unlike most other knights in Arthurian romance, the practically-minded Dinadan prefers to avoid fights and considers courtly love a waste of time, though he is a brave fighter when he needs to be. King Mark made came Eliot the harper and sang the lay that Dinadan had made.\\" Arthur Rackham's illustration for The Romance of King Arthur (1917), abridged from Le Morte d'Arthur by Alfred W. Pollard Dinadan is well known for his cynical humor and joking nature, and for his mockery of chivalry. In Le Morte d'Arthur, he is visiting the court of Cornwall seeking his friend, the young hero Tristram (Tristan), and has supper with Queen La Beale Isoud (Iseult) where he reveals that he has, by his own desire, no lady-love or paramour in whose name to do great deeds. Dinadan is also often portrayed as the wittiest of all of Arthur's knights, and a source and target of practical jokes. In Le Morte d'Arthur, he is one of the few knights to be able to recognise his fellows from their faces in addition to their shields; in one instance Tristan does not recognise his own King until Dinadan tells him who it is. In one notable exploit, he writes an insulting ballad about King Mark and sends a troubador to play it at Mark's court. In another episode, he loses a joust when Lancelot catches him off guard by wearing a dress over his armour; Lancelot then puts the dress on his unconscious opponent. As summarized by to Joyce Coleman, \\"Margaret Schlauch hails the 'courtly realism' of Sir Thomas Malory's Morte Darthur and, in particular, 'the comically realistic Sir Dinadan', whose jokes about his fear of jousting have his listeners laughing so hard they can barely keep their seats. 'Sir Dinadan, the realist' (Elizabeth Edwards), the 'rational moralist' ruled by a 'pragmatic creed' (Donald Hoffman), remains a standard figure of Malorian analysis.\\" However, some like Eugene Vinaver and Harold Livermore regard the humor of Malory's Dinadan as inferior to that of the French original in which Dinadan's jokes are more offensive and subversive (targeting even religion). In Le Morte d'Arthur, following the Prose Tristan narrative, Dinadan dies when he returns from Cornwall, hoping to persuade King Arthur to reverse his ruling which had again set Mark on the throne. However Dinadan, still wounded from his fight with Brehu the Merciless, is treacherously ambushed and murdered by two other Round Table knights, the brothers Mordred and Agravain, who hated him due to his closeness to their enemy Lamorak from the rival clan of King Pellinore. Hector finds Dinadan mortally wounded and takes him to Camelot, where he dies in Lancelot's arms. In the Italian Tavola Ritonda, Dinadan (Dinadano) himself attempts to murder the captured Marco in revenge for the death of Tristano, and Breus sanz Piet√† is actually his cousin. This version of Dinadan is characterized differently, as a violent misogynist who hates Tristano's beloved Isotta as \\"a whore\\". Dinadan also appears in some other romances, such as in Escanor, where his strong distrust of women is a theme of comedy, and in some variants of the Prophecies de Merlin.  In modern fiction  Dinadan's modern appearances included the stage version and film adaptation of the musical Camelot, portrayed by John Cullum, Christopher Sieber, and (in the film) Anthony Rogers. He is protagonist of Gerald Morris' 2003 novel The Ballad of Sir Dinadan as well as subject of the chapter \\"Sir Dinadan the Humorist\\" in Mark Twain's 1890 A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.

Early life Garfield Bromley Oxnam was born in Los Angeles in August 14, 1891. His father was a mining engineer and instilled in his son a conservative theology. Oxnam embraced these beliefs in his youth, even describing socialism as \\"the biggest idiocy ever presented to the public.\\" However, in his early 20s Oxnam gravitated towards Dana W. Bartlett and the movements of the Social Gospel.Sitton, Tom (August 2011). Metropolis in the Making: Los Angeles in the 1920s. University of California Press. Oxnam's political tendencies moved further left at the University of Southern California. Under the tutelage of Progressive teachers Emory S. Bogardus, Rockwell D. Hunt, and James Main Dixon, Oxnam was encouraged to apply his knowledge of social issues in real life settings in Los Angeles. Oxnam became a volunteer Housing Inspector for the Los Angeles Housing Commission and ventured through the poorest districts of Los Angeles, a city that falsely proclaimed to have no slums. He took copious notes from his field work and vowed to use the power of the Church to eradicate the slums in Los Angeles. Social reform in Los Angeles He graduated from the University of Southern California in 1913 and from the Boston University School of Theology in 1915. He was ordained in 1916 and then headed west to briefly run a church in California's Central Valley. However, he felt a strong desire to return to his hometown Oxnam, G. Bromley (1954). I Protest. Harper & Brothers Publishers. and eventually presided over the Church of All Nations, a multiethnic Church in Downtown Los Angeles. Through Oxnam's personal surveys, the Church of All Nations was comprised more than 46 nationalities.Laslett, John H.M. (2012). Sunshine Was Never Enough: Los Angeles Workers 1880-2010. University of California Press. Oxnam's unprecedented fight for racial inclusion spearheaded the fight for immigrant worker rights in the ethnically diverse Los Angeles. He said the Methodist Church, which preached for greater racial integration, did not do enough in practice to further this cause.https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.95955 Oxnam advocated for the Americanization of immigrants, but he fought with local Los Angeles organizations like Colonel Leroy Smith and the Better America Foundation over what Americanization truly meant. To Oxnam, the concept of Americanization went far beyond the Better America Foundation's narrow patriotic rhetoric, it embodied the education for citizenship based on social justice and workers' rights. This idea meant great potential strength for unions and collective bargaining rights because it would reduce the ethnic divisions between workers. Oxnam, seeing an opportunity to improve the lives of Los Angeles citizens, ran to be on the Los Angeles Board of Education in what became an intense symbolic battle between the workingman of Los Angeles and its conservative business owners. Oxnam was even accused of instigating a plot to \\"sovietize the public schools\\" in response to his declaration that teachers' opinions should be involved when they were making policy decisions. He ultimately lost the election as a result of slanderous accusations by the Los Angeles Times and the Better America Foundation, which were later used as evidence by the House Un-American Activities Committee.https://archive.org/stream/testimonyofbisho00unit/testimonyofbisho00unit_djvu.txt After Los Angeles Oxnam left Los Angeles to be a professor of social ethics at Boston University in 1927. One year later he became president of De Pauw University, Greencastle, Indiana, where he was popular among students because he permitted dancing. As President he achieved a high level of national and international recognition, bringing DePauw unprecedented public attention. He stepped down as president upon his election as bishop in 1936, but still remained a prominent public figure. He advocated for progressive Church measures like Christian unity. He said on national television: :One of the principles we've got to insist upon is diversity in unity. In a word, we've got to conserve all the values of the many different searches for the eternal. Oxnam also took slightly controversial positions against the Cold War. He opposed compulsory military training and the military reserves in peacetime for fear of how the rigors of military training and life can affect a man's thinking and philosophy. He also opposed the use of the atomic bomb by saying ‚ÄúThere is something morally wrong with a weapon who destroys humanity.‚Äù He was accused of being a communist by Donald L. Jackson and appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee on July 21, 1953. He was extensively questioned about his communist sympathies and his relations with other accused communists. At this time, many of the false accusations from his campaign for the Los Angeles School Board resurfaced as evidence against him. Oxnam repudiated these accusations and offered counter evidence to disprove accusations that he was related with the Industrial Workers of the World and had spoken at rallies with various radicals. In 1958, Bishop Oxnam was successful in helping to found the School of International Service (SIS) at American University, the national Methodist university in Washington, D.C. In that effort, Oxnam was able to convince the General Conference of The Methodist Church to contribute over $1 million for the school's creation. The founding of the SIS was part of a vision held by Oxnam to create an academic institution \\"pledged to the study, proclamation and practice of the principles of freedom and the maintenance of civil, economic, and religious liberty by training competent and consecrated men and women for the international service of the state, the community and the church.\\" Bishop Oxnam was also responsible for the relocation of Westminster Theological Seminary from Westminster, Maryland to a location in Washington, D.C. on land belonging to American University. Once relocated, the seminary was renamed Wesley Theological Seminary. After Oxnam's death in 1963, his ashes were interred at Wesley Seminary in the chapel that bears his name. His son, Robert Fisher Oxnam, was also president of a Methodist-founded university, Drew University, from 1961 to 1974.

He is best known for creating a number of films, critical of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), linking them to terrorist attacks during the Cold War in Africa, South America and Europe. The most notable of these are the Gladio (1992) series about Operation Gladio which featured on BBC's Timewatch and The Maltese Double Cross ‚Äì Lockerbie (1994) about Pan Am Flight 103. Background Francovich was born in New York City, to a Jewish engineering family. His father, Aldo Francovich, worked as a mining engineer for Cerro de Pasco mining company in Peru; as a child he lived in high altitude mining towns and witnessed the extreme poverty of the miners. He attended an elite preparatory school in Lima then came to the U.S. to attend Notre Dame University, where he completed a B.A. He lived in Paris for several years, studying freelance at the Sorbonne before coming to Berkeley. There he finished an M.A. in Dramatic Arts at UC, Berkeley; he also studied film briefly at Stanford and received a grant to study film from the American Film Institute in 1970. He and translator and writer Kathleen Weaver were married in 1970; the two separated amicably and were divorced in 1986. She collaborated on his films during the time of their marriage. Lockerbie bombing Allan Francovich produced, wrote and directed The Maltese Double Cross - Lockerbie, a documentary which challenged the official view that Libya was responsible for the sabotage of Pan Am Flight 103. Instead, an unwitting drug mule, with links to Hezbollah and to both the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the CIA, was argued to have carried the bomb on board the aircraft. The documentary was funded by Tiny Rowland. When his British production company, Hemar Enterprises, released the film in November 1994, it was immediately threatened with legal action by lawyers acting for a US government official (believed to have been the DEA's Michael Hurley). Screenings of the film at the 1994 London Film Festival, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and at several universities were prevented. But Labour MP Tam Dalyell ignored libel warnings and went ahead and showed the film at the House of Commons on November 16, 1994. Channel 4 television decided to broadcast the film in Britain on May 11, 1995. A spokeswoman responded to critics of the decision by saying that \\"it needed to be shown to a wider public\\". =Letter to The Guardian= The day after the Channel 4 broadcast, The Guardian published a letter from Francovich headed \\"The Lockerbie smears\\": > The attacks by the UK and US authorities on my film The Maltese Double Cross > (UK and US scorn Lockerbie film, May 11) are exactly what we predicted would > happen. The aim is to smear people in the film in order to divert attention > from the mass of evidence that supports our claims. The film shows how > Lockerbie was masterminded by Iran and Syria, not Libya, and that the bomb > got on the plane through a botched US intelligence operation based on Middle > East drugs and hostages.

Because of the likelihood of legal action, The Maltese Double Cross - Lockerbie has never been publicly screened in America. It can however be viewed here on the internet, by scrolling down to Allan Francovich - The Maltese Double Cross.Internet version of The Maltese Double Cross Death Francovich suffered a fatal heart attack in a Customs area at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, on April 17, 1997 whilst entering the United States from England; he was 56. His films and papers are archived by the Pacific Film Archive, in Berkeley, California. Reception John Pilger described Francovich's films as \\"extraordinary\\" political documentary films, with particular praise for The Maltese Double Cross - which \\"destroyed the official truth that Libya was responsible\\". Lee Kreindler, the head of a legal team for American families of Pan Am 103 victims, alleged that Francovich approached the American families and misrepresented himself by not mentioning the Libyan financing of the film and by saying he was a friend of John Merritt, a journalist from The Observer who had the respect of the American families. Daniel Cohen, the father of Pan Am 103 victim Theodora Cohen, said that in his eyes Francovich was \\"completely discredited\\" since Francovich did not mention the Libyan financing.

Family Grose was born on 14 July 1869 in Nicholas County, West Virginia, the eldest son of Andrew Dixon and Mary Estaline (n√©e Harrah) Grose. His grandfather, William Grose, was a licensed exhorter in the Methodist Episcopal Church, and an earnest, forceful speaker. He was encouraged to obtain a license to preach, but he preferred to remain an exhorter and a local worker in the church. Grose married Lucy Dickerson of Cadiz, Ohio, on 28 June 1894. They had five children: Wilbur Dickerson, Mary Frances, Helen, William and Virginia. Education Grosee taught school for a few years in Fayette County, West Virginia, then graduated in 1894 from the Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, Ohio, with the degree of A.B.. He went on to the Boston University School of Theology, where he earned the degrees of S.T.B. (1896) and M.A.. Ohio Wesleyan awarded him the honorary doctorates D.D. in 1908 and LL.D. in 1916. Ordained ministry Grose served as a pastor of the Cherry Valley Church, Leicester, Massachusetts from 1896 to 1897. He then went to Boston where he served for three years as the pastor in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. Then he was appointed to the First Methodist Church of Newtown, Massachusetts, (1900‚Äì05), then the First Methodist Church of Lynn, Massachusetts, (1905‚Äì08). Grose then accepted the pastorate of Grace Methodist Church in Baltimore (1908‚Äì12). From Baltimore he was called to the Presidency of DePauw University, Greencastle, Indiana, in 1912. He served in this position for eleven years. During a period of growth at the University, his term as president brought stability and financial strength. He also transferred his conference membership to the North Indiana Annual Conference. He stepped down as president on his election to the episcopacy.

The liberty of the press has always been regarded by political writers as of supreme importance. Give me liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all other liberties, says Milton in the Areopagitica. Before the invention of printing, the Church assumed the right to control the expression of all opinion distasteful to her. When the printing press was invented, German printers established themselves at various important centres of western Europe, where already numbers of copyists were employed in multiplying manuscripts. In 1473 Louis XI granted letters patent (giving the right of printing and selling books) to Uldaric Quring (Ulrich Gering), who three years earlier had set up a press in the Sorbonne (the theological faculty of the university at Paris), and before long Paris had more than fifty presses at work. The Church and universities soon found the output of books beyond their control. In 1496 Pope Alexander VI began to be restrictive, and in 1501 he issued a bull against unlicensed printing, which introduced the principle of censorship. Between 1524 and 1548 the Imperial Diet in Germany drew up various stringent regulations; and in France, prohibited by edict, under penalty of death, the printing of books, This was too severe, however, and shortly afterwards the Sorbonne was given the right of deciding, a system which lasted to the Revolution.  Censorship  Censorship was either restrictive or corrective, i.e., it interfered to restrict or prevent publication, or it enforced penalties after publication. Repression of free discussion was regarded as so necessary a part of government that Sir Thomas More in his Utopia makes it punishable with death for a private individual to criticize the conduct of the ruling power. Under Mary, printing was confined to members of the Stationers Company, founded by royal charter in 1556. Under Elizabeth the Star Chamber assumed the right to confine printing to London, Oxford and Cambridge, to limit the number of printers and presses, to prohibit all publications issued without proper licence, and to enter houses to search for unlicensed presses and publications.

Samuel Hume was born in San Francisco, California in 1885, the son of James B. Hume, a famous Wells Fargo detective. He attended Berkeley High School, graduating in 1904, and then the University of California at Berkeley, where he played leading roles in student drama productions and received a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1908. He then traveled in Europe and studied modern European theater practices with Edward Craig in Florence. Returning to the U.S., he attended Harvard College in 1912-14, where he studied in the playwriting workshop of George Pierce Baker, earned a master's degree, and organized the first exhibition of stagecraft in the U.S. The exhibition was presented in Cambridge, New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland. From 1916 to 1918 Hume was director of the newly formed Arts and Crafts Theater in Detroit, Michigan, part of the Little Theatre Movement. He brought Sheldon Cheney, an old friend from Berkeley, to Detroit to launch Theater Arts magazine out of the Arts and Crafts Theater. In 1918 Hume returned to California to become assistant professor of dramatic literature and art at the University of California where, in addition, he directed the Greek Theatre until 1924. In 1924‚Äì1925 he commissioned and produced Lexington, a left-leaning play by Sidney Coe Howard, in Lexington, Massachusetts. He then went to Europe and collaborated with Parisian architect and set designer Walter Ren√© Fuerst on the book Twentieth Century Stage Decoration. In 1927 in Paris he met and married Portia Bell, a fellow Berkeley graduate who was studying sculpture with Antoine Bourdelle. This was a second marriage for both. After returning to Berkeley, the couple hired John Hudson Thomas to design a home in the Berkeley hills modeled after a medieval French cloister. It was named a Berkeley Landmark in 1985 and has been known as Hume Cloister or Hume Castle. Its 30-year owners placed it on the market for $5 million in April 2016.\\"Magnificent Hume Castle in Berkeley hits market at $5 million\\", San Francisco Chronicle, April 7, 2016. Samuel Hume was the director of the Berkeley Art Association and its Berkeley Art Museum from 1928 to 1932. At the same time he held the title of Director of Avocational Activities in the State of California Department of Education. In that role, he was quoted as saying that experience of the arts could help reduce juvenile delinquency. From about 1928 to 1936 he served as executive secretary for the California Council on Oriental Relations, advocating for immigration reform. He established At the Sign of the Palindrome, a rare book business specializing in books on art and theater and also selling art reproductions, first in his home and in a shop in downtown Berkeley in 1949. He coauthored Twentieth Century Stage Decoration (1928) and Theater and School (6 editions, 1932‚Äì47). Portia Bell Hume became a psychiatrist, taught at the University of California, San Francisco and Berkeley, and established psychiatry clinics in both cities.

It involved the derailment of a long passenger train at Shipton-on-Cherwell near Kidlington, Oxfordshire, England, on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1874, and was one of the worst ever disasters on the Great Western Railway. Colonel William Yolland of the Railway Inspectorate led the investigation and chaired the subsequent Court of Enquiry of the Board of Trade. Its report highlighted several safety problems including wheel design, braking and communications along trains. The accident came in a decade which saw many terrible accidents on the rail network, and which culminated in the Tay Rail Bridge disaster of 1879. Accident The accident happened a few hundred yards from the village of Hampton Gay and close to Shipton-on- Cherwell. The train with 13 carriages and two engines had left Oxford station for Birmingham Snow Hill at 11:40.\\"Terrible Railway Accident.\\" Times [London, England] 25 Dec. 1874: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 1 Dec. 2013. The train was about half an hour late and going about 40 miles an hour when after six miles the tyre of the wheel on a third-class carriage broke. The carriage left the track for about 300 yards including the bridge of the River Cherwell. After the bridge and before a similar bridge across the Oxford and Birmingham canal the carriage went down an embankment taking other carriages with it, breaking up as they crossed the field. Three carriages and a goods carried on over the canal bridge, and another fell into the water. The front section of the train carried on for some distance. The owner and men from the Hampton Gay paper mill close to the accident site tried to assist the injured in the snow. Telegrams were sent to local stations to summon medical help but it took an hour and a half before a doctor appeared. A special train was used to move the injured back to hospitals in Oxford. At least 26 died at the scene while four others were dead by the time the special train had arrived at Oxford station. At least one other died in hospital. The canal was dragged but no bodies were found. Causes The bridge over the canal near the site of the accident The basic cause was found to be a broken tyre on the carriage just behind the locomotive, but that failure was worsened by the poor braking system fitted to the train. When a passenger warned the fireman of the problem, by waving from the carriage window, it was still being pulled along intact along the rails. However, the driver braked immediately, before the brake at the rear of the train in the guards van could be applied. The engine brake caused the failed carriage to be crushed, and the carriages behind derailed near the Oxford Canal. There were 34 deaths and 69 seriously injured in the carriages which fell from the bridge over the canal. Inquiry The inquiry that followed quickly established the root causes. The tyre was on an old carriage and was of an obsolete design. The fracture started at a rivet hole, possibly by metal fatigue, although it was not recognised as such by the Inquiry. The weather was very cold that day, with snow blanketing the fields and very low freezing temperatures, another factor that hastened the tyre failure. The Railway Inspectorate recommended that the railway companies adopt Mansell wheels, a type of wooden composite wheel, as the design had a better safety record than the alternatives. There had been a long history of failed wheels involved in serious accidents, especially in the previous decade. The problem of broken wheels was not resolved until cast steel monobloc wheels were introduced. The disaster led to a reappraisal of braking methods and systems, and the eventual fitting of continuous automatic brakes to trains, using either the Westinghouse air brake or a vacuum brake. The Inspectorate was also critical of the communication method between the locomotive and the rest of the train using an external cord and gong, suggesting that a telegraphic method should be adopted instead. Inquest An inquest was opened on 26 December 1874 using the manor house at Hampton Gay; the 26 bodies found at the scene were laid out in two rows in a large paper store in the paper mill for the court to view and seek formal identification and the wreckage was also examined.\\"The Shipton Railway Accident.\\" Times [London, England] 28 Dec. 1874: 9. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 1 Dec. 2013. The coroner and jury decided to re-convene in Oxford and permission was given to move the wreckage but only one carriage would be moved to Oxford for further investigation and examination. The following week the coroner returned to Hampton Gay to further identify bodies and also those which had been kept in the third class waiting room at the Oxford Railway Station and one at Radcliffe Infirmary.\\"The Shipton Accident.\\" Times [London, England] 29 Dec. 1874: 8.

As the two villages are 9 km (over 5 miles) from each other and there was traditionally poor communication in the snowy months of the year, these villages' dialects diverged and are still markedly different both from each other and from the language spoken further down the mountains (Friulian). According to studies by some institutions (examples to follow) which study Ladin languages these two dialects moved away from Friulian to become 'Raetic-Dolomitic-Ladin' similar to Ladin languages spoken in Grijun Switzerland, while keeping Friulian characteristics. To give one of many examples, the word 'sheep' (plural) translates as 'las minas' in Forni di Sopra 'lis fedis' in Forni di Sotto, and 'lis pioris' in Friuli.

The robot, standing 140 cm tall and weighing 20 kg, walks at a pace of two steps per second. It was satirized in Japan, where, known as , it became an internet phenomenon; one article described the protruding joints near the robot's crotch as a \\"cannon\\", resulting in internet games based on the concept.  Development  China's robotics research began during the 1980s, and their resources at the time were primitive compared to other countries'. Nonetheless, the National University of Defense Technology was determined to make a robot for China, after seeing Japan's and America's robots in the Expo '85 world fair in Tsukuba, Japan. On 31 December 1987, the Chinese robot's legs were successfully programmed. By 1989, the team moved onto the robot's synchronization of the hands, nervous system, and visual sensors, thus steering the project into the direction of making a humanoid robot. On 29 November 2000, the robot was complete, and the team named it \\"Xianxingzhe\\", meaning forerunner, as the robot was hailed as a major technological breakthrough in China.  Parody  Though a significant advance in robotics in China, the robot was also known for the spoof that was made on it. On 3 March 2001, the Japanese website posted a page ridiculing the Senkousha (Japanese reading of the Chinese characters for Xianxingzhe) in response to the Chinese enthusiasm. In that page, Samurai Damashii exaggerated the Senkousha as \\"the crystallization of China's four thousand years of scientific knowledge\\", commented on the crude design (e.g. the \\"Chinese Cannon\\" on its crotch), and put its image among images of Honda's ASIMO and Sony's QRIO SDR-3X for juxtaposition. Later, in a separate article, the site \\"revealed\\" that the Senkousha was actually a military weapon, and elaborated on the protruding joint on the robot's crotch. According to the page, the Senkousha would first rattle the ground with its feet to stir the energy resting on the ground, then it will do squats to harness that energy and transfer them to its crotch cannon, then finally fire that energy in a massive white beam with a pelvic thrust. In conclusion, the author of the article expressed his worries about world peace, seeing the destructive power that the robot possesses (including the ability to make people die laughing). With the article, Samurai Damashii exceeded 10,000 pageviews per day, which is rare in personal webpages. It was said that a peak level of 200,000 pageviews per day was recorded. (In Japan, in the past, a personal webpage with 1,000 pageviews per day was considered successful . Now, because of Senkousha, that standard has risen to 10,000. ) The articles officially started the Senkousha craze in Japan, and later Taiwan.  Influence  The Senkousha craze quickly spread into Japanese internet forums like 2channel, achieving meme stature. Using the plot from the games, fans even wrote a theme song for Senkousha, and subsequently used the song to make a fake tokusatsu opening animation, spreading the meme even further. Other appearances include: * Netrunner, a Japanese magazine, quick to respond to internet culture, made models of the Senkousha for sale. The magazine also featured Senkousha in its anime OVA, Netrun-mon. * Hyper Octagon Station, a d≈çjin circle, created a 3D Senkousha online game, with robots dueling each other in the Yokohama Chinatown. * The robot is depicted in the anime Puni Puni Poemy dancing past the Aasu's house. * In the anime and manga Yakitate!! Japan, Azuma and Kawachi thought of a robot that looked awfully similar to the Senkousha when told that they are only bread-making machines. * In episode 14 of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, there is an android related to the Chinese mafia named Pioneer which has a cannon protruding out of its groin area. * In the first episode of Negima!?, a model of Senkousha is seen standing on Chao Lingshen's desk. * In the twenty-third episode of Rizelmine, Lan-lan, the artificial human from China is seen riding on top of a robot who looks like Senkousha during the chase scene. * Norikuni Iwata from Excel Saga received a Senkousha figurine from his co-worker, Daimaru Sumiyoshi, out of pity in Volume Eight of the manga. It appears on pages 76 and 83 of both the Japanese and American version. * A modification called Parallel Worlds for Battlefield 1942 features the Senkousha as an operable vehicle, complete with crotch mounted cannon. * In episode 3 of R-15, there is a robot with a crotch drill in one of Takuto's day dreams.

The Via Amerina traverses it. At the Riserva S. Silvestro, walls exist. At Corchiano itself, however, similar walls may be traced, and the site is a strong and characteristic triangle between two deep ravines, with the third (west) side cut off by a ditch. Here, too, remains of two bridges may be seen, and several rich tombs have been excavated. The term Fescennine Verses refers to a certain kind of drinking song popular at festivals in ancient Rome and elsewhere. According to Festus, these songs were introduced from Fescennia, but others have thought that there is no reason to assume that any particular town was especially devoted to the use of such songs. Fescennia's warriors are also mentioned in Book VII of Virgil's Aeneid as following Messapus, the 'Steed Tamer' in the war waged by Turnus against Aeneas.

The network was operated by The Radio Network (TRN). Established in June 1998, each radio station in the network retained its local name and broadcast a live breakfast show from the centre in which it was based and then during the day and overnight would pick up the network feed broadcast from Taupo. (Programme would be fed from Huka Falls Road Taupo to The Radio Network's Auckland Street premises for upload to the Optus Satellite where it was then received in the various markets). The network on-air line up originally included: *Mark Bramley (10a - 2p) *Aaron Gillions (2p - 7p) *Peter Gosney (7p - 12a) In late 1998, the lineup would change to: *Mark Bramley (10a - 2p) *Scott Armstrong (2p - 7p) (Brian Gentil in 2000) *Peter Gosney (7p - 12a) (Corey K and Duncan Allen in 2000) Other voices heard on the network included Geoff Bargas, Rebecca Ali, Nadine Christiansen, Sarah McMullan, Chris Auer, Marke Dickson and Paul Frost. On 1 December 2000, CRN stations joined the Classic Hits programme fed from Cook Street Auckland, also operated by TRN. Where the station had both an FM and AM frequency the FM frequency was usually used to broadcast a localised version of Classic Hits while the AM frequency was used to broadcast Newstalk ZB. CRN as a division of TRN remained, providing creative services, writing and producing commercials for each of the stations. CRN was later renamed to 'The Provincial Group'.

Brianza (, ) is a geographical, historical and cultural area of Italy, at the foot of the Alps, in the North-West of Lombardy, between Milan and Lake Como. Geography Brianza extends from the Canzo area, North of Monza (approximately 14 km from Milan), to the Seveso River on the West and to the Adda River on the East. The southern and western parts are mostly flat, while the northern and eastern parts are mountainous. Brianza encompasses a part of the administrative area of the Province of Monza and Brianza, a part of the administrative area of the Province of Lecco, a part of the administrative area of the Province of Como and some municipalities of the administrative area of the province of Milan bordering the Province of Monza and Brianza. The main language spoken in this area is Italian and to a lesser extent a dialect of the Lombard language. Brianza is densely populated, with approximately 1.372 inhabitants/km2, yet remains remarkable fertile for farming. Due to its hilly nature, it is a favorite summer resort for the people of Milan. Its economy includes the production of furniture and tools. The agro-industrial technology and high-tech economies have expanded in recent years. Geographic boundaries *To the northeast: hills and valleys from Lake Garlate, up to the beginning the Lambro River on Monte San Primo. To the northwest: hills surrounding the source of the Lambro back down to Tavernerio (which is above Lake Montorfano), continue along the line Lipomo-Capiago Intimiano-Senna Comasco-Casnate con Bernate and end where the Seveso River takes its source on Sasso di Cavallasca. *Southern borders: beginning of Limbiate, the municipalities along the Canale Villoresi to its confluence in the Adda River. *Eastern borders: the Adda,Adda park after the lakes of Garlate and Olginate, which receives the waters of the Canale Villoresi. *Western borders: the Seveso River from its source on Sasso di Cavallasca to Paderno Dugnano where it crosses the Canale Villoresi, and the Oltreseveso (\\"beyond the Seveso\\") consisting of the municipalities of Cermenate, Lazzate, Misinto, Cogliate, Ceriano Laghetto, Solaro and Limbiate. History The area of the modern day Brianza was originally settled in the 2nd millennium BC or even earlier. Brianza is in Lombardy, the region named after the Longobards, who arrived around the 570s, after the Celtic and the Roman expansion. The spread of Christianity in Brianza dates back to the 3rd century, owing much to Saint Ambrose. There, St. Augustine of Hippo (as documented by himself in his Confessions) had lived at Rus Cassiciacum (now Cassago), during the period after his conversion and just before his baptism by Bishop Ambrose. In the Middle Ages the Cathars, the Humiliati and the Pataria religious movement rose and fell in several towns of Brianza. The Franciscans flourished instead and remain to the present day. Most of the region follows the Ambrosian Rite of the Catholic Church in communion with the Pope in Rome. Brianza was home to many distinguished figures in poetry, philosophy and history of medicine among them are: *Cesare Cant√π *Piero Corti *Luigi Giussani *Giuseppe Parini *Giovanni Battista Scalabrini *Alberto da Giussano *Aribert, Archbishop of Milan *Pope Pius XI *Filippo Turati *Andrea Dell'Orto *Simona Brambilla *Sergio Sala Names In Italian, lower Brianza is referred to as and upper Brianza is . The name Brianza may be derived from the Celtic word (\\"hill\\"), or the Latin name which originated from some colonies of the Brigantes, or Brigantii, a Celtic sub-tribe of Alps and Prealps that were Romanized and after the Barbarian invasions emigrated. According to another tradition, when the Celtic leader Bellovesus founded Milan, his chief lieutenant Brianteo conquered a surrounding geographical area, which was thenceforth named Briantia or Brianza. Brianteo/Briantea/Briantei/Briantee, Briantino/Briantina/Briantini/Briantine, and Brianz(u)olo/Brianz(u)ola/Brianz(u)oli/Brianz(u)ole are all terms for the people of the Brianza. Briantitudine is a name that claims the identity of the Brianza with its population and its culture. ReferencesBibliography * Antonini A.

Biography Born in St. Louis, United States, the son of Italian and British immigrants, Amerigo Dumini moved to Italy and in 1913 he joined the army renouncing his US citizenship. During the First World War he was an assault trooper and was severely wounded and decorated. Then he became active in the Fascio of Florence organized by supporters of Benito Mussolini, taking pride in being referred to as \\"Sicario del Duce\\" (\\"Il Duce's hitman\\"). He participated in the Sarzana incident on 21 July 1921, leading a column of 300 \\"squadristi\\" (Blackshirts) to Sarzana with demands for the liberation of Renato Ricci. Ricci and other fascists had been arrested following armed confrontation with the Arditi del Popolo, an antifascist organization created in 1921 by the anarchist Argo Secondari as an offshoot of the \\"Arditi\\" movement. In 1924 Dumini entered the ranks of Ceka, the secret police which Mussolini based on the Soviet Cheka. Shortly thereafter, on 10 June, he headed the group (Albino Volpi, Giuseppe Viola, Augusto Malacria and Amleto Poveromo) that carried out the killing of Giacomo Matteotti, possibly on the orders of Cesare Rossi, to whom he was assistant at the time. Following the political murder, he was abandoned by the fascist leadership, with the exception of Roberto Farinacci, who defended him during his trial. While Farinacci declared himself \\"honored\\" by the task, he could not prevent Dumini from receiving a five-year prison sentence, of which he only served eleven months, benefiting from an amnesty ordered by Mussolini. Once out of jail, he tried his hand at blackmailing the fascist leadership, trying to obtain rewards and the payment of his legal fees. Ostentatiously, he sought a meeting with Mussolini at the Italian Council of Ministers. He justified his entitlement with the words \\"I am here in order to wash Matteotti's blood off my hands\\". Arrested, he was put on trial for \\"offending Il Duce\\" and sentenced to eight years in prison substantially more than for the previous crime. Freed in 1927, Amerigo Dumini left for Italian Somaliland, having been awarded a large state pension (5,000 lire). Apparently, he was still viewed as troublesome, since he was detained and interned on the Tremiti Islands. Meanwhile, he warned General Emilio De Bono that he had filed a manuscript detailing Matteotti's murder with notaries in Texas. This claim led to his release and an increase in pension to as much as 50,000 lire. He left for the Italian colony of Libya, where his pension was further increased by 2,500 lire (together with a single payment of 125,000 lire). He remained in the region for more than a decade and was captured by the British Army at Derna during the North African Campaign of World War II. Sentenced to death as a spy, he was hit by 17 bullets from a firing squad and still managed to remain alive, escaping to safety in Tunisia during the night.Artieri, Giovanni (1968). Quattro momenti di storia fascista. A. Berisio, p. 87. As Dumini returned to Italy, he was received with astonishment and offered yet another generous pension. He went into business as a transporter and bought a villa in a residential area of Florence. With the 1943 fall of fascism in southern Italy, he joined the German-backed Italian Social Republic. After the Allied occupation of that region, Dumini was arrested in Bologna and placed on trial for Matteotti's murder. He was given a life sentence, but spent no more than eight years in prison and, following more than a decade in quiet retirement, died at the age of 73 at Rome as the result of a domestic accident. In the Florestano Vancini's film The Assassination of Matteotti (1973), Dumini is played by Umberto Orsini.

Backmarking works like backtracking by iteratively evaluating variables in a given order, for example, x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n. It improves over backtracking by maintaining information about the last time a variable x_i was instantiated to a value and information about what changed since then. In particular: An example, in which search has reached xi=d the first time. # for each variable x_i and value a, the algorithm records information about the last time x_i has been set to a; in particular, it stores the minimal index j such that the assignment to x_1,\\\\ldots,x_j,x_i was then inconsistent; # for each variable x_i, the algorithm stores some information relative to what changed since the last time it has evaluated x_i; in particular, it stores the minimal index k of a variable that was changed since then. The first information is collected and stored every time the algorithm evaluates a variable x_i to a, and is done by simply checking consistency of the current assignments for x_1,x_i, for x_1,x_2,x_i, for x_1,x_2,x_3,x_i, etc. When search reaches xi=d for the second time, part of the path is the same as the first time. The second information is changed every time another variable is evaluated. In particular, the index of the \\"maximal unchanged variable since the last evaluation of x_i\\" is possibly changed every time another variable x_j changes value. Every time an arbitrary variable x_j changes, all variables x_i with i>j are considered in turn. If k was their previous associated index, this value is changed to min(k,j). The data collected this way is used to avoid some consistency checks. In particular, whenever backtracking would set x_i=a, backmarking compares the two indexes relative to x_i and the pair x_i=a. Two conditions allow to determine partial consistency or inconsistency without checking with the constraints. If k is the minimal index of a variable that changed since the last time x_i was evaluated and j is the minimal index such that the evaluation of x_1,\\\\ldots,x_j,x_i was consistent the last time x_i has been evaluated to a, then: # if j, the evaluation of x_1,\\\\ldots,x_j,x_i is still inconsistent as it was before, as none of these variables changed so far; as a result, no further consistency check is necessary; # if j \\\\geq k, the evaluation x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k,x_i is still consistent as it was before; this allows for skipping some consistency checks, but the assignment x_1,\\\\ldots,x_i may still be inconsistent. Contrary to other variants to backtracking, backmarking does not reduce the search space but only possibly reduce the number of constraints that are satisfied by a partial solution.

Arcellinida species produce shells or tests from mineral particles or biogeonic elements (e.g. diatom frustules) and are thus commonly referred to as testate amoebae or shelled amoebae. Difflugia are particularly common in marshes and other freshwater habitats.  History  The genus Difflugia was initially discovered in 1815 by L, Leclerc , but its infra-generic classification as a group is still unclear. The genus Difflugia is the oldest and most diverse of the testate amoebae. It contains more than 300 species and countless subspecies since even minor differences in morphology result in classification as a new species. In 1958, Gauthier-Li√®vre and Thomas divided the genus into 10 groups depending on difference in shell morphology. These 10 groups are based on a survey conducted of the African species of Difflugia The 10 shell shape classifications are lobed, collared, compressed, urceolate, globose, ovoid-globose, elongate, acute angled, horned and pyriform. WIkiwiki Difflugia was initially discovered in 1815 by L, Leclerc [2], but its infra-generic classification as a group is still unclear. The genus Difflugia is the oldest and most diverse of the testate amoebae. It contains more than 300 species and countless subspecies since even minor differences in morphology result in classification as a new species. In 1958, Gauthier-Li√®vre and Thomas divided the genus into 10 groups depending on difference in shell morphology. These 10 groups are based on a survey conducted of the African species of Difflugia [3] The 10 shell shape classifications are lobed, collared, compressed, urceolate, globose, ovoid-globose, elongate, acute angled, horned and pyriform.  Taxonomy  There have been issues coming to a specific consensus about the taxonomy of the genus Difflugia. In 1988, an attempt to characterize and create a phylogenetic tree based upon the composition of the shell . However, with additional evidence it was found that this is not actually a useful characteristic to evaluate by. In addition, most initial descriptions of Difflugia speciation were completed using light microscopy and therefore lacked the technology to show the details of test structure and composition. The invention of scanning electron microscopy allows for more detail and improved the taxonomic work surrounding Difflugia. Studies surrounding Difflugia have been centered around species found mostly in Europe and Africa. Molecular phylogenetic analyses have revealed that the genus Difflugia, as traditionally defined, is not a monophyletic group. As a result, several globular and oviform species have been transferred to the genus Netzelia.  Structure  Difflugia are testate amoebae with an agglutinate shell. The test can be composed of various different mineral particles depending on the varying environment. These mineral particles are collectively called xenosomes. All species of the genus Difflugia acquire their xenosomes, from the environment in which they inhabit. Difflugia often have species specific tests, which are arranged based on the specific shape and size. Most species of Difflugia only contain one nucleus but there are a select few that are multinucleated. In the larger species the nucleus can be vesicular as opposed to the regularly ovular nucleus. All species also contain an epipodium which is a terminal aperture in the protist's structure. The size of Difflugia is found to range from 15Œºm all the way up to 500Œºm. During cell division, the particles collected that have been used to produce the test are directly passed on to the daughter cell. Strength of the test is quite variable between the Difflugia species and the strength of the test can be separated into three categories; robust, intermediate and fragile. Robust tests are found to result in a shell with an irregular shape in comparison to the rest of the genus. Shells which are a part of the fragile category are most likely to be constructed from diatom crystals.  Habitat and ecology  The environment conditions in which Difflugia lives is important to consider as it greatly influences shell morphology of the species. Shell composition depends on environmental pH and what materials are available. Difflugia can be found living in a large variety of habitats such as freshwater sediments, dry mosses and soil, or lakes. Some species are planktonic and switch to a benthic phase during the winter in which they stay immobile near the bottom of the body of water. One way environment can influence characteristics of Difflugia is that there are several freshwater species, which have green endosymbionts or zoochlorellae. The species Difflugia that contain endosymbionts are not considered to be heterotrophs, but instead mixotrophs because they combine being autotrophic and heterotrophic. The source of food depends on the environment but across the genus it is found to be mainly algae and fungi. Smaller species of Difflugia are found to consume bacteria as well as algae and fungi.  Fossil history  The presence of a test in Difflugia allowed them to be extremely well-preserved in fossils . Difflugia are part of one of the oldest lineages of eukaryotes based on fossile records which date back 750Mya. The only structure of the organisms that was able to be preserved in the fossils was the test. Therefore there have been issues differentiating genera such as Cryptodifflugia from Difflugia based on fossil record alone . Another problem arise from the distortion of test and changes to the xenosomes that makes genera difficult to identify from the testate amoebae fossil specimen alone.

History Side view Carved lion Front entrance Ministry of Antiquities sign, May 2005 Although little is known for definite about the history of Qasr al-Abd it is widely believed to have been built by a Tobiad notable, Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, head of the powerful Tobiad family and governor of Ammon. Credence for this theory is gained from the fact that the Hebrew name 'Tuvya' or 'Toviyya' (Tobias) is engraved (◊ò◊ï◊ë◊ô◊î but in a more Aramaic script) above the adjacent burial caves of Iraq al-Amir, which share their name with the nearby village. In another of these caves there is a carving of a lioness sheltering a cub at the palace. According to a local legend, Tobias was a commoner who fell in love with the daughter of a nobleman. When he asked for her hand in marriage, the nobleman said that Tobias could only have her hand if he built the so-called \\"Castle of the Slave.\\" After completing the castle, the nobleman had Tobias killed as he did not want his daughter marrying a commoner. It is known that the structure was originally surrounded by a large excavated reflecting pool, leading the first- century AD Jewish historian Flavius Josephus to suppose that this was a moat and the building a fortress. However, more recent evidence for the building's original function being as a country pleasure palace has been presented by the contemporary Israeli archaeologist Ehud Netzer. It has also been suggested that the site was in fact intended to serve as a mausoleum of the family of Tobias, the Tobiads. In any case, it was never completed. The name Qasr al-Abd can be translated as Castle of the Slave or Servant, a title which may refer to Hyrcanus himself, who, as governor, was a \\"servant of the king\\". The biblical Book of Nehemiah mentions \\"Toviyya, the Servant, the Ammonite\\" (). According to Josephus, Hyrcanus left Jerusalem after losing a power struggle, and established his residence east of the Jordan, apparently on the ancestral lands of the Tobiad dynasty. The area was then a border zone between Judea and Arabia, and Josephus mentions that Hyrcanus was in constant skirmishes with Arabians, killing and capturing many. He took his own life in 175 BC, following the ascent to power in Syria of the strongly anti-Jewish Seleucid king Antiochus Epiphanes, fearing the latter's revenge for his support for the Egyptian Ptolemies against the Syrian Seleucids. The building was unfinished at the time of his death (as indicated by several incomplete carvings and columns on site), and was seized by Antiochus Epiphanes. Josephus mentions the \\"beasts of gigantic size carved on it\\" (Antiquities of the Jews, Book XII, 230), and carved tigers or lions are still perfectly preserved on the remains visible today. The palace was badly damaged by a great earthquake that hit the region in 362 AD. The building preserved its original two stories due to the fact that was reused as a church during the Byzantine period. Architecture The heavily decorated two-storey stone structure (measuring about 40 metres by 20 metres, and 13 metres high) is a rare example of Hellenistic architecture in Jordan. In the 1st century AD, Flavius Josephus described it as, \\"A strong fortress, which was constructed entirely of white marble up to the very roof and had beasts of gigantic size carved on it; and he enclosed it with a wide and deep moat\\". The castle is built from some of the largest single blocks of any building in the Middle East, with the largest block measuring seven by three metres. However, these blocks were at most only 40 centimetres wide, making the building relatively vulnerable to the earthquake which eventually destroyed it. Archaeologists have established that Qasr al-Abd once stood in a much larger estate, which was originally surrounded by a wall and included a park with trees and shrubs. A large stone olive press has been found on the site, suggesting the estate was partially self-sufficient in agricultural produce. Much of the estate now stands beneath the village of Iraq al-Amir. Restoration The ruins of Qasr al-Abd have been partially restored, due to the efforts of a French team directed by Ernest Will and the architect Fran√ßois Larch√© in collaboration with Fawzi Zayadine of the Jordanian Archaeological Service. The team spent the years 1979 to 1985 making detailed drawings of the fallen stones and on the subsequent reconstruction. References *Iraq al-Amir, le ch√¢teau du Tobiade Hyrcan par E. Will et F.

It lies on the Bandama River in the center of the country. It is an artificial lake, created in 1973 by damming the Bandama River at Kossou (the Kossou Dam). Some 75,000 Baoul√© people were displaced by the lake. Map of C√¥te d'Ivoire showing the centrally located Lake Kossou History Lake Kossou was formed after construction of the Kossou Dam across the Bandama River which was completed in 1973. The Kossou Dam Project was completed under the auspices of the United Nations Development Program, the agency involved being the Authorite de Valle du Bandama (ADV). It involved relocating about 75,000 people from 200 settlements, into 54 new villages which were built by ADV, 32 in the forest zone and 22 in the savanna zone. 22,000 people were resettled before water started to be impounded in 1971. The dam is constructed of earth with rockfill, and is about long. The impounded water powers a hydroelectric power plant with a capacity of 174 megawatts. When full, the lake will have a surface some above sea level, a length of and a width of , an area of and a capacity of . Besides the generation of power, the creation of the lake was intended to encourage the local population to remain in the area and use the water for irrigating their crops, and it was also hoped that a fishing industry would develop. In 1975 the lake reached its greatest height above sea level of , at which point its surface area was about 50% of its full potential. By 1994 it had not enlarged further due to a decrease in rainfall in its catchment area, and some extraction of water through dikes upstream. Rainfall in the catchment area continued to be lower than the long term average, and the surface area of the lake remained at about 50% of what had been expected; many dispossessed farmers who had been relocated claimed back their land. In 1983, a serious drought and extensive wildfires devastated the crops and the coffee and cacao plantations near the lake, causing great economic loss. In 2019, a project to create a floating solar photovoltaic scheme on the surface of the lake was being considered. It would have an installed capacity of between 10 and 20 megawatts. Wildlife An early feature of the lake was the development of large populations of the invasive water cabbage (Pistia stratiotes) on the surface of the water. There are hippopotamuses and other aquatic animals at the lake, and an increasing number of birds have been recorded being resident here or visiting the area. Before the dam was constructed, the dominant fish species found in the river had been Labeo coubie and Alestes rutilus, with Tilapia zillii being found in quiet backwaters. By 1975, species caught in the lake included the Nile perch (Lates niloticus), Distichodus rostratus, Alestes baremoze, Brycinus nurse, Labeo senegalensis, Pellonula afzeliusi, the African butter catfish (Schilbe mystus) and the mudfish (Clarias anguillaris).

Klorer. It stars Richard Basehart, Audrey Totter, Cyd Charisse and Barry Sullivan. Plot Police Lieutenant Collier Bonnabel (Barry Sullivan) of the homicide department explains that he only knows one way to solve a case: by applying pressure to all the suspects, playing on their strengths and weaknesses, until one of them snaps under the tension. He then cites a murder case involving Warren Quimby (Richard Basehart). In flashback, the bespectacled Quimby, night manager of the 24-hour Coast-to-Coast drugstore in Culver City, is married to the sluttish Claire (Audrey Totter). Saving and doing without, he is able to afford a nice house in the suburbs, but she is utterly unimpressed, refusing even to look inside. She eventually leaves him for the latest of her conquests, rich Barney Deager (Lloyd Gough). Quimby goes to Deager's Malibu beachfront house to try to get his wife back, but she wants nothing to do with him. When Quimby persists, Deager beats him up. He tells his sympathetic employee, Freddie, what happened. Freddie remarks that if it had been him, he would have killed the man. Deeply humiliated, Quimby takes up Freddie's idea. He constructs a new identity, cosmetics salesman Paul Sothern, buys contact lenses and flashier clothes, and rents an apartment in Westwood. As he is moving in, he meets his new neighbor, beautiful, sweet Mary Chanler (Cyd Charisse), whom he starts dating. One night Quimby, identifying himself as Paul Sothern, makes a phone call, leaving a message with Narco (Tito Renaldo), Deager's servant, that he will get Deager for some unspecified wrong. On a later night, he hitchhikes to Deager's place, grabs a barbecue prong and walks through the open patio door. He finds Deager asleep in a chair, but cannot go through with the killing. When he drops his weapon, Deager awakes. Quimby grabs the prong and holds it to Deager's neck, explaining that he came to kill him, but suddenly has realized that Claire is not worth it. Then, seeing that his wife is absent, he mocks Deager, guessing that Claire has said she was going to the moviesthe excuse she used while cheating on him. After Quimby leaves, Deager ponders his situation. Claire later surprises Quimby by returning to him in their Culver City apartment. When he refuses to believe she has come back out of love, she tells him Deager has been murdered. Before Quimby has time to absorb the news, Bonnabel and his partner Lieutenant Gonsales (William Conrad) arrive to question them. They know that Claire left the murder scene before they were called. She says that she only went to Deager's place as a day guest to swim regularly and that she and her husband were Deager's friends. Quimby is forced to play along to avoid suspicion. The police are looking for Paul Sothern, the prime suspect. However, following his stated policy, Bonnabel leads Claire on, pretending he is attracted to her. The police get a break when Mary goes to the Bureau of Missing Persons, concerned about Sothern's disappearance. She brings a photograph. Bonnabel eventually realizes Sothern and Quimby are the same man. However, Deager was shot, and they do not have the gun. Bonnabel maneuvers Mary to Quimby's workplace to identify him, but she refuses to do so, and states that her faith in Sothern is unshaken. The police arrest Quimby anyway. Under questioning, he tells them his story, but they find it hard to believe. Later, Bonnabel tells Claire that they had to release her husband due to insufficient evidence; he plants the idea that the gun is the vital clue they need to convict Quimby. Claire retrieves the gun from its hiding place under a rock and plants it in Sothern's apartment. Quimby arrives, followed very shortly by the police. Claire claims she was searching for the gun, and Bonnabel encourages her to continue; she \\"finds\\" it under a chair cushion, but then Bonnabel explains that all the furnishings had been replaced and that Claire has incriminated herself. Claire is resigned to her fate, but defiantly walks out in the custody of Gonsales. Mary protests that nothing in the apartment has been changed; Bonnabel replies that it would have been too much work. Quimby and Mary are free to resume their relationship. Cast * Richard Basehart as Warren Quimby, aka Paul Sothern * Audrey Totter as Claire Quimby * Cyd Charisse as Mary Chanler * Barry Sullivan as Police Lt. Collier Bonnabel * Lloyd Gough as Barney Deager * Tom D'Andrea as Freddie, the counter man at Coast to Coast drugstore * William Conrad as Police Lt. Edgar \\"Blackie\\" Gonsales * Tito Renaldo as Narco, Deager's houseboy Production Fifty minutes into the film is a humorous nod to Conrad's girth. His character and Sullivan's question a witness, a movie theater employee; as they leave the theater, Conrad's character buys a bag of popcorn. As he begins to open the bag, Sullivan's character snatches it from his hands and passes it off to a little boy entering. As they exit, Conrad's character looks back at the popcorn longingly while Sullivan's character taps Conrad's character on the belly. Reception According to MGM records the film earned $506,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $270,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $229,000. =Critical response= Film critic Walter Addiego, staff critic at the San Francisco Examiner, wrote of the drama, \\"They aren't making 'em anymore like this 1949 melodrama by John Berry, and that's too bad... What sticks with you about the film is what a classic, prize-winning sap the Basehart character is, how pathetic and ill-considered are his dreams of domestic bliss, and how easily he's able to shift into a new and quite different identity. All in all, a good example of noirish post-war disillusionment ‚Äî and it has Cyd Charisse and William Conrad to boot.\\"Addiego, Walter. San Francisco Examiner, film review, April 25, 1998.

The home venue is the Woodlands Memorial Ground on Blackpool Road in Ansdell and the first team play in English rugby's National League 2 North, the fourth tier of the English rugby union system, following their relegation from National League 1 at the end of the 2017-18 season. There are another three senior teams, the Wanderers, the Saracens and the Vandals who play in the English North West Leagues; respectively in the NW Premiership, NW1 North and NW4 North. There is currently no Colts team. In previous seasons the Colts have played in the Lancashire & Cheshire regional leagues. In the past, Woodlands Memorial Ground was shared by Blackpool Rugby League Club. History=Overview= Fylde Rugby Club was founded on 25 July 1919, literally on the toss of a coin when a group of Manchester businessmen met at Ansdell Institute to discuss the formation of either a rugby union or a football club. A coin was tossed and it fell in favour of rugby union. The club grew steadily and achieved a strong fixture list by the 1960s and has been in the National Leagues since the leagues inception in 1987. It takes its name from The Fylde, a roughly 13-mile (20-kilometre) square-shaped peninsula, bounded by Morecambe Bay to the north, the Ribble estuary to the south, the Irish Sea to the west, and the Bowland hills to the east, with Blackpool to the west and Preston to the south-east. =Formative years= In May, 1920 the present Woodlands site was first used for rugby. The admission was 5d and the first yearly gate receipts amounted to just over ¬£57. In 1922, Harold Brooks was elected President and through his efforts Fylde progressed. He also provided the present stand. In 1924 the club was represented in the Lancashire team by players such as \\"Ham\\" Neville, who was capped 33 times, and \\"Pop\\" Ogden. The club was strengthened by the merger with Blackpool Old Boys in the 1934‚Äì35 season. During the World War II, Fylde, along with many other clubs, had to close as the Army took over the ground. In 1946 the President, G.W. Parkes, welcomed back members from the war and by this time the ground had been purchased and named the Woodlands Memorial Ground in recognition of those members who gave their lives during the war. =Post-war years= In the 1950s, the dressing rooms were built and Pop Ogden was elected President of Lancashire. Arthur Bell and Rothwell Bamber were given life memberships for their work with the club. Bell served for 34 years as the Honorary Secretary. In 1964 the second England trial was held at Fylde and Sir Laurie Edwards opened the new pavilion extension and presented the club with a rugby union shield which is still on the clubhouse wall. 1969 was Fylde‚Äôs jubilee year, when they were fielding six or seven teams every Saturday. The club's two most famous players were home grown, Malcolm Phillips and Bill Beaumont. Phillips, who attended Arnold School in Blackpool, won 25 England caps at centre between 1958 and 1964. He was President of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) from 2004 to 2005 and has served on the International Rugby Board (IRB) for a number of years. Beaumont was also a one club man having joined Fylde as a 17-year-old in 1969 and stayed with the club until injury forced him to retire in 1982. His father had also played for Fylde and he wrote suggesting that his son be given a trial. His first game was in the sixth team as fullback. With his size and his 6'3\\" height, he was very quickly made into a forward to play for the first team. He earned 34 England caps between 1975 and 1982, 21 of them as captain. This included leading the side to the Grand Slam in 1980, as well as skippering the 1980 British Lions tour to South Africa. In retirement he has remained in the public eye as a broadcaster and columnist. He is still a regular face at Fylde. He has also made major contribution to rugby administration in the United Kingdom and internationally as an IRB Member, with the RFU and he was manager of the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. In the same era, a young Roger Uttley, subsequently to skipper and then manage England, and Brian Ashton, England's Head Coach, also played for Fylde. Other more recent internationals associated with Fylde include England wingers Tony Swift and Simon Smith, who were capped in the 1980s after leaving the club and locks Steve Bainbridge and Wade Dooley, established internationals who won further caps whilst with Fylde. England 'A' winger Mark Preston had a record of scoring 98 tries in 131 appearances. He subsequently made a similar impact in rugby league with Wigan and Halifax. =Present day= As with so many former top-flight clubs outside the Guinness Premiership, attendances at home matches have fallen in recent years. In the early 1990s, 2,000 spectators would watch local derbies with Preston Grasshoppers and as many as 5,000 attended in 1982 to see Bill Beaumont's XV play Lancashire, staged when he retired through injury. But the club still stages representative games such as the England v Scotland Under 19 international in January 2004 which attracted 2,500 spectators. There were 1,500 people at the Fylde v Preston Grasshoppers league match in December 2006. Today, the teams still go onto the field wearing the colours of claret, gold and white, which were originally the colours of the Huddersfield Old Boys. It has never been resolved why the colours were chosen. The colours have not changed, although the design is now rather different. Recent seasons have seen Fylde move between National Division One, National Division Two and more recently National Division Three North (from which the club gained promotion during the 2010/11 season). The club ran up significant debts in trying to compete in National One from 1997 to 1999 and had to sell a small portion of the Woodlands' grounds in order to re-establish financial health. With the receipts of the sale, a period of redevelopment of various facilities at Woodlands began in January 2005. The new clubhouse opened in October 2005 and houses 500 people. The club finished in sixth place in National Division Three North in the 2003‚Äì04 season, fourth in 2004‚Äì05 and seventh in 2005‚Äì06. The club's rugby management, including coaches Stuart Connell, who used to play for Fylde and Cumbria), Martin Scott, who played for Orrell, Fylde and Scotland, as well as Alistair Atkinson who played for Orrell and Sedgley Park. They are planning a promotion bid back to National Division Two. Leading scorers in the 2005‚Äì06 season included skipper and fly-half Mike Scott with 300 points, and one of the top goal kickers in national rugby, winger Nick Royle with 16 tries and flanker Andy Atkinson with 11 tries. The Players' Player of the Season was Paul Newton who was appointed skipper for the 2006‚Äì07 season. Like so many clubs, Fylde has struggled in the professional era to maintain a balance between a members' club, based on traditional local community values and structures, and a professional outfit able to compete for players, regionally and nationally. The club has reasserted itself as a community-oriented members' club, basically amateur, bringing together experienced players in the area, together with nurturing considerable local talent and a sprinkling of overseas players. The club fields ten mini/junior sides, a Junior Colts squad and four other senior teams, the Wanderers, the Saracens, the Vikings and the Vandals. Apart from a new clubhouse completed in September 2005, the club's strategic plan to 2011 envisages an expansion of community multisports facilities including an all-weather pitch and floodlighting. Midway through the 2007‚Äì08 season the coaches Stuart Connell and Martin Scott were replaced with Mark Nelson the Lancashire coach who has previous experience of coaching at the club along with a successful spell as backs coach at Sale. Nelson has recruited a number of high calibre players including England Counties' Steve Nutt, Craig Aikman and David Wilks. He has also rekindled the club's relationship with Sale which has allowed him to call on some of the Premiership club's young players whilst Sale have also given game time to Fylde's Nick Royle. Roger Banks is the current 1st XV captain. In June 2010, it was announced that former manager Brian Ashton would be a coaching consultant for his former club. On the 26 July 2010, it was announced that former international Jason Robinson would be making his comeback at the club. In June 2012, Sam Beaumont stepped down from his role as the skipper of Fylde.

The festival's first incarnation existed from 1995 to 2000. In 2012, a group of scholars saw an opportunity to revive the free outdoor festival at the award-winning Cascades Park.  History  The Southern Shakespeare Festival was founded by American entrepreneur Michael J Trout in November 1994 as the Florida Theater Project. In the summer of 1995, Michael Trout organized a touring company, led by David Klein. Words...Words...Words: An Evening of Shakespeare toured local theaters, regional high schools, and community arts centers. Trout then approached Florida State University Dean Emeritus Richard G. Fallon for his help to establish a free Shakespeare in the park festival, which Trout modeled after Joseph Papp's New York free Shakespeare-in-the-park. The Tallahassee festival and Renaissance fair ran from 1996 to 2000 as an open-air, free festival and Renaissance fair located in the downtown area behind Tallahassee's City Hall in Kleman Plaza. The inaugural Shakespeare-in-the-park production in 1996, A Midsummer's Nights Dream, directed by Russian director Irina Brown, drew over 30,000 spectators according to the local newspaper, the Tallahassee Democrat. It is recognized as one of the most successful free-theater festivals in Tallahassee with over 80,000 spectators and over 20,000 students benefitting from its educational programming during its 1996‚Äì2000 existence. In 2012, the Southern Shakespeare Festival was revived thanks to Dr. Kevin Carr, Dr. Brent Griffin, and a dedicated group of Tallahassee theater artisans, most notably Laura W. Johnson, Catherine Leonard, and Lanny Thomas. The Capital City Amphitheater at Cascades Park is the new home of the revitalized festival and appropriately, its first production, which ran April 17‚Äì19, 2015, was A Midsummer Night's Dream, directed by Lanny Thomas, and starring special guest AEA artist Jef Canter as Nick Bottom.

Protein folding and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Proteins that are destined for the plasma membrane or export to the extracellular environment in eukaryotic cells are translated on ribosomes that sit on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Most proteins are co- translationally transported into the ER (i.e., while the ribosome is translating the mRNA code into a polypeptide, the polypeptide is simultaneously inserted via the translocon pore into the ER). The ER provides an environment that helps nascent polypeptides fold into and become functional or partially functional proteins. The ER provides an oxidizing environment (for formation of disulfide bonds) and the necessary chaperones (folding assisting agents that are not part of the final protein). Numerous exported proteins form disulfide bonds‚Äîcovalent bonds that stabilize the protein structure in harsh extracellular environments. A classic example are the disulfide-linked heavy and light chain polypeptides of antibodies secreted by B-cells of the immune system. Another key event that takes place in the ER is N-linked glycosylation. In this process, polypeptides that have a unique stretch of 3 amino acids (asparagine - X - serine/threonine, where X represents any amino acid except proline) are modified with a complex sugar moiety on the amide group of asparagine. Other types of glycosylations include S-linked (via cysteine residues), C-linked (via tryptophan) and O-linked (via serine or threonine). By far, N-linked glycosylation is the most abundant post-translational modification found in eukaryotic cells. Protein export from the ER and the COP II coat Once proteins have folded and are ready to be transported out of the ER it is thought that they assemble at specific site within the ER called \\"ER exit sites\\". These sites can be transient but are most likely situated in the ER where the ER is close to the next transport compartment, the vesicular-tubular cluster (VTC) (also referred to as the ER- Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC)). The details of how proteins are concentrated or localized to the exit site is unclear (some aspects are emerging!) but the actual process of budding a vesicle containing these proteins start with a protein called Sec12. This protein recruits a small GTPase called Sar1 (think of Sar1 as a switch, it is active when bound to GTP and inactive when it hydrolyses the GTP to GDP). This in turn leads to the recruitment of a protein complex, the Sec23/Sec24 and the Sec13/Sec31 complex (also known as the COPII coat). In a nutshell what these proteins do is form a mesh at the ER exit site and the mesh through mechanical curvature forms a little \\"blob\\" that pinches off from the ER with proteins inside (think, playdough as the ER and your hand as the Sec complex pinching off little bits). The mesh disassembles off the budded vesicle when Sar1 hydrolyses the GTP to GDP. This activity of Sar1 is enhanced by Sec23/24. Vesicle transport and tethering Once the vesicles pinch off from the ER they are transported passively (by diffusion) or actively (by intracellular motors that run on cytoskeletal tracks). The mode of transport seems to be influenced by distance. Short distances may tend towards passive transport, whereas longer distances tend towards active transport. Once these vesicles reach their destination, they need to be first physically linked with their acceptor compartment (else they may float away). This process is facilitated by \\"tethers\\". Tethers come in two \\"flavors\\": long protein(s) with domains called \\"coiled-coil,\\" or complexes of many subunits which are for the most part globular. The tether that functions to tether ER derived vesicles to the VTC (or Golgi apparatus in case of lower eukaryotes), the next compartment in the transport pathway, is the Transport Protein Particle (TRAPP). TRAPP as a tether TRAPP also comes in two \\"flavors\\", TRAPP I & II. TRAPP I is a multisubunit complex that consists of seven subunits (Bet5, Bet3, Trs20, Trs23, Trs31, Trs33, Trs85). TRAPPII has three additional subunits (Trs65, Trs120 and Trs130) and functions as a tether at latter stages of the transport pathway. TRAPP I binds these ER derived vesicles and brings the vesicle closer to the acceptor membrane. This close juxtapositioning of the two membranes allows the interaction between SNARE's (soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive Factor) attachment protein receptor) on both compartments. The interacting SNARE's then pull the membranes close and allow for fusion. A recent reportCai et al., has shown that the initial interaction between TRAPP and the ER derived vesicle is mediated via the interaction between the TRAPP subunit Bet3 and the COPII coat subunit, Sec23. The conventional view of tethering/fusion assumed that the vesicle coat is shed prior to tethering and fusion but this report argues for a model where the initial tethering step takes place on a coated or partially coated vesicle. The TRAPPI complex minus the subunit Trs85 was recently crystallized as two subcomplexes that were then modelled on EM etch data to reveal a possible crystal structure for the entire complex. A putative ypt/rab binding site was indicated on the crystal structure involving the subunits Trs23 and Bet5. Incidentally, all 5 essential small subunits (Trs31, Trs20, Bet3, Bet5 and Trs23) are required to reconstitute efficient exchange activity on ypt1 in vitro. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether the interface between ypt1 and TRAPPI is only confined to Trs23 and Bet5 and how the other subunit influence exchange activity. Clinical significance Mutations in the TRAPP system have been associated with neurological deficits.Van Bergen NJ, Guo Y, Al-Deri N, Lipatova Z, Stanga D, Zhao S, Murtazina R, Gyurkovska V, Pehlivan D, Mitani T, Gezdirici A, Antony J, Collins F, Willis MJH, Coban Akdemir ZH, Liu P, Punetha J, Hunter JV, Jhangiani SN, Fatih JM, Rosenfeld JA, Posey JE, Gibbs RA, Karaca E, Massey S, Ranasinghe TG, Sleiman P, Troedson C, Lupski JR, Sacher M, Segev N, Hakonarson H, Christodoulou J (2019) Deficiencies in vesicular transport mediated by TRAPPC4 are associated with severe syndromic intellectual disability.

The nerve emerges from the psoas major in the outer part of its upper border, and crosses in front of the quadratus lumborum to the iliac crest, running behind the kidneys. Near the iliac crest the iliohypogastric nerve then pierces through the transversus abdominis and divides between that muscle and the internal oblique muscle into a lateral and an anterior cutaneous branch. Branches The iliohypogastric nerve originates from the superior branch of the anterior ramus of spinal nerve L1 after this nerve receives fibers from T12 via the subcostal nerve. The inferior branch is the ilioinguinal nerve. =Lateral cutaneous branch= The lateral cutaneous branch (\\"iliac branch\\") pierces the internal and external oblique muscles immediately above the iliac crest and is distributed to the skin of the gluteal region, behind the lateral cutaneous branch of the subcostal nerve; the size of this branch bears an inverse proportion to that of the lateral cutaneous branch of the subcostal nerve. When harvesting bone from the anterior iliac crest (AICBG), the lateral cutaneous branch of the Iliohypogastric nerve (L1) is most likely to be injured.

But he is more known as a historian, writer and poet. He wrote exclusively in Persian. Born in the Garmrood village, in central Iran, between Arak and Qom, at a young age he was sent to the Safavid's court and obtained his education there. He is the author of Sharafnama, one of the most important works on medieval Kurdish history, written in 1597. He created a good picture of Kurdish life and Kurdish dynasties in the 16th century in his works. Outside Iran and Kurdish-speaking countries, Sharaf Khan Bidlisi has influenced Kurdish literature and societies through the translation of his works by other scholars. He was also a gifted artist, and a well-educated man excelling as much in mathematics and military strategy, as he did in history. Early life Sharaf Khan Bidlisi was born on February 25, 1543, in the Markazi province, Iran in the Garmrood village, during the exile of his father. The Rojaki dynasty, which had ruled intermittently as an independent emirate from their capital of Bitlis since at least the 9th century, and therefore, he never took up the common tribal title of \\"Khan\\", preferring instead the royal title of emir or mir, \\"prince.\\" He was most commonly known as, Mir Sharaf (Prince Sharaf). Later his family was taken under protection of the Safavid dynasty. He was schooled at Tahmasb's court, and wrote in 1596: Bedl√Æs√Æ speaks of his education entailing instruction in the Quran, readings in on the principles of the shari'a, a piety and purity. Due to Shah Tahmasb's religious disposition, Bidlisi was introduced to religious scholars, who warned him against evil people, and instead encouraged friendship with the virtuous. And once Bidlisi attained maturity, he was thought the martial arts (sipahigira), archery, polo, racing, swordsmanship, and the precepts of chivalry ‚Äì humanism and generosity. In 1576 Tahmasb of the Safavids gives him the title the Mir of Mirs; appoints him leader of all Iranian Kurdish tribes. He accepts his title, but only two years later, Sharafkhan abandons his previous stand, and supports the Ottomans in their war against the Iranians, offering them 400 soldiers. In 1578, Sultan Murad III, the Ottoman Sultan, grants Sharafkhan the title of Emir and he becomes the Mir of the Emirate of Bitlis. Between 1578 and 1588, Sharafkhan virtually led all the Ottoman wars against the Persians. In 1597, Sharafkhan gave the authority of his dynasty to his son ≈†ams-al-Dƒ´n. Sharafnama He was thinking for a long time to write a book about Kurdish history, and finally in 1597 Sharaf Khan Bidlisi started his composition of his epic, Sharafnama.The Sharafnama divides its history into four parts. The first one deals with the five Kurdish dynasties that have enjoyed status as royalty (Saltant): the Marwanids of Amed, the Hasanwayhids of Dinavar and Sharizur, the Fadluyids of the Great Lur, the princes of little Lur, and finally, Saladin the Great and the Ayyubids. The second part lists dynasties that have had coin struck and the khutba recited in their names. (The Khutba is a religious invacation pronounced at the Friday day prayers meeting that mentions the Prophet, the first four caliphs and the current rulers). The third part numbers the families of the hereditary governors, while the fourth details the history of the mirs of Bitilis. He wrote his works in Persian, and it was not until 1879 that it was translated into Kurdish (Kurmanji) by the Kurdish polymath Mahmud Bayazidi (1797‚Äì1859). Its hand-written version is preserved in the Russian National Library, and was published for the first time in 1986. In 1972, the Sorani version of Sharafnama was written for the first time by the late Kurdish scholar Abdurrahman Sharafkandi (1920‚Äì1991), also known as Mamosta Hajar. In 1873‚Äì1875, the French scholar Fran√ßois Charmoy translated Sharafnama from Persian into French and published it in Saint Petersburg, in Russia. Among many other languages, Sharafname has been translated into Arabic, English, Turkic languages, Russian, Greek and Armenian. Death He died in his own principality (Emirate of Bitlis) in 1603 at the age of 60, and left thousands of writings. Legacy The creation of Sharafnama, one of the oldest books ever written by a Kurd, is a turning point in the history of Kurds and their rich culture. The fact that a Kurd, for the first time, put Kurdish culture under a spotlight is of special importance in contrast to other studies that were done before Sharafnama. Bidlisi has a unique place in Kurdish history. After his Sharafnama, a number of copies and other works similar in nature surfaced over the centuries within the cultural sphere on rich Kurdish history. In the text of the Sharafnama, the empires of the Kurds parallel those of the Arabs, Persians and Turks, some, according to Bitlisi, reaching back over 4,000 years. Sharaf khan's Sharafnama is today safely kept in Oxford.

Besides being the drummer for the band, Heaton was also responsible for much of the band's songwriting both lyrically and musically, the musical content of NMA album Thunder and Consolation is essentially exclusively his creation. He was probably the first person to play a synchronous drum and harmonica solo, doing so in the song 'Shot 18' on the No Rest for The Wicked tour. He was the second drummer in NMA but the band's first touring and recording drummer. Biography=Early years= Heaton was born in Knutsford, Cheshire and lived in Canada and Belgium as a child. He was musically gifted, eventually mastering the guitar and harmonica as well as the drums, for which he is better-known, and also played keyboards and fiddle. Heaton began playing guitar and drumming along to his dad's collection of trad jazz recordings. He developed a very eclectic musical taste, taking in obvious rock influences like Led Zeppelin and ZZ Top but also but also the country music of Johnny Cash and classical composers - Beethoven, Mozart Tchaikovsky and Vivaldi. =New Model Army= Heaton's arrival marked the start of New Model Army's professional era, the band has previously had Phil Tompkins on drums, but had released no music during this time. Having spent several years as back line roadie and tour manager for several other bands, including Hawkwind, he brought professional experience to the band's touring life and was responsible for their hiring of their long-term tour manager 'Tommy T' Walker, a fellow member of the Bradford St George's and Bradford Univ TSA stage crew. Together with frontman Justin Sullivan, Heaton was the core of the Bradford-based New Model Army, originally alongside Stuart Morrow on bass and then later with Jason 'Moose' Harris. Heaton's wide-ranging musical interests are manifested in the music for the anthemic \\"Green and Grey\\" as well as co-writing with Sullivan the New Model Army singles \\"Better Than Them\\", \\"Brave New World\\", \\"51st State\\", \\"Poison Street\\", \\"White Coats\\", \\"Space\\" and \\"Here Comes the War\\". He was responsible for many of NMA's best-known compositions, which are still played nowadays at their gigs. He left NMA in 1998 due to health reasons - he had long suffered from sarcoidosis, undergoing repeated surgery, and was then diagnosed with a brain tumour - and was replaced on drums by his roadie Michael Dean. Though the surgery on his brain tumour was successful, he was advised by his surgeons that he would be unlikely to play musical instruments professionally for several years, which ultimately resulted in the end of his career with New Model Army. =Work outside New Model Army= Following his illness Heaton began a successful landscape gardening business and eased himself back into music, initially as a New Deal adviser, then producer and recorder of local bands in Bradford under the 'Fresh Milk' project, eventually launching a touring and recording band - 'the Gardeners of Eden' - shortly before he died. The demo recording for the Gardeners of Eden remains unreleased, but copies are held by his family. Heaton had worked as a drum technician for Hawkwind from 1981 through to 1983. He performed with the band at 1983's Stonehenge Free Festival, deputising for Andy Anderson, and recorded the \\"The Earth Ritual Preview\\" EP.

Wales  Frederic Seebohm has called our attention to the interesting surveys of Welsh tracts of country made in the 14th century, soon after these regions passed into the hands of English lords. The fragments of these surveys published by him and his commentary on them are very illuminating, but further study of the documents themselves discloses many important details and helps to correct some theories propounded on the subject. The description of Astret Canon, a trev or township (villata) of the honour of Denbigh, surveyed in 1334 was the time of the native Welsh princes. It was occupied entirely by a kindred (progenies) of free tribesmen descended from a certain Canon, the son of Lawaurgh. The kindred was subdivided into four gavells or bodies of joint-tenants. On the haif-gavell of Monryk ap Canon, e.g. there are no less than sixteen coparceners, of whom eight possess houses. The peculiarity of this system of land tenure consists in the fact that all the tenants of these gavells derive their position on the land from the occupation of the township by their kindred, and have to trace their rights to shares in the original unit. Although the village of Astret Canon was, occupied under the Survey by something like fifty-four male tenants, the majority of whom were settled in houses of their own, it continued to form a unit as well in regard to the payment of tungpound, that is, of the direct land tax and other services and payments, but also in respect of the possession and usage of the soil. On the other hand, movable property is owned in severalty. Services have to be apportioned among the members of the kindreds according to the number of heads of cattle owned by them. From the description of another township, Pireyon we may gather another important feature of this tribal tenure. The population of this village also clitistered in gavells, and we hear that these gavells ought to be considered as equal shares in respect of the Arabic, the wood and the waste of the township. If the shares were reduced into acres there would have fallen to each of the eight gavells of Pireyon ninety-one acres, one rood and a half and six perches of arable and woodland, and fifty-three and one-third of an acre and half a rood of waste land. But as a matter of fact the land was not divided in such a way, and the rights of the tenants of the gavell were realized not through the appropriation of definite acres, but as proportionate opportunities in regard to tillage and as to usages in pasture, wood and waste. Pastoral habits must have greatly contributed to give the system of landholding its peculiar character. It was not necessary, it would have been even harmful, to subdivide sharply the area on which the herds of cows and the flocks of sheep and goats were grazing. Still Welsh rural life in the 14th century had already a definite though subordinate agricultural aspect, and it is important to notice that individual appropriation had as yet made very slight progress in it.  Slavonic  Let us now compare this description of Celtic tribal tenure with Slavonic institutions. The most striking modern examples of tribal communities settled on a territorial basis are presented by the history of the Southern Slays in the Balkan Peninsula and in Austria, of Slovenes, Croats, Serbs and Bulgarians, but it is easy to trace customs of the same kind in the memories of Western Slays conquered by Germans, of the Poles and of the different subdivisions of the Russians. A good clue to the subject is provided by a Serb proverb which says that a man by himself is bound to be a martyr. One might almost suggest that these popular customs illustrate the Aristotelian conception of the single man seeking the autarkeia, a complete and self-sufficient existence in the society of his fellow-men, and arriving at the stage of the tribal village, the yivoc, as described in the famous introductory chapter of the Greek philosophers Politie. The Slays of the mountainous regions of the Balkans and of the Alps in their stubborn struggle with nature and with human enemies have clustered and still cluster to some extent (in Montenegro) in closely united and widely spreading brotherhoods (bratstva) and tribes (plemena). Some of these brotherhoods derive their names from a real or supposed commoun ancestor, and are composed of relatives as well as of affiliated strangers. They number sometimes hundreds of members, of guns, as the fighting males are characteristically called. Such Kovacevii, as one might say in Old English the Vukotings or Kovachevings, of Montenegro. The dwellings, fields, and pasturages of these brotherhoods or kindreds are scattered over the country, and it is not always possible to trace them in compact divisions on the map. But there was the closest union in war, revenge, funeral rites, marriage arrangements, provision for the poor and for those who stand in need of special help, as, for instance, in case of fires, inundations and the like. And corresponding to this union there existed a strong feeling of unity in regard to property, especially property in land. Although ownership was divided among the different families, a kind of superior or eminent domain stretched over the whole of the brat stvo, and was expressed in the participation in common in pasture and wood, in the right to control alienations of land and to exercise pre-emption. If any of the members of the brotherhood wanted to get rid of his share he had to apply first to his next of kin within the family and then to the further kinsmen of the brat stvo.  Russia  Attention however, should be called more particularly to the parallel phenomena in the social history of the Russians, where the conditions seem to stand out in specially strong contrast with those prevailing among the mountain Slays of the Balkans and of the Alps. In the enormous extent of Russia we have to reckon with widely different geographical and racial areas, among other, with the Steppe settlements of the so-called Little Russians in the Ukraine and the forest settlements of the Great Russians in the north. In spite of great divergencies the economic history of all these branches of Slavonic stock gravitates towards one main type, viz, towards rural unions of kinsmen, on the basis of enlarged households. In. the south the typical village settlement is the big court or hamlet consisting of some four to eight related families holding together; in the north it is the big oven, a hamlet of somewhat smaller size in which three to five families are closely united for purposes of common husbandry.  Germany  The Saxon or Ditmarschen portion of this region gives us an opportunity of observing the effects of an extended and highly systematized tribal organization on Germanic soil. The independence of this northern peasant republic, which reminds one of the Swiss cantons, lasted until the time of the Reformation. We find the Ditmarschen organized in the 15th, as they had been in the 10th century, in a number of large kindred~, partly composed of relatives by blood and partly of cousins who had joined them. The membership of these kindreds is based on agnatic ties that is, on relationship through males or on affiliation as a substitute for such agnatic kinship. The families or households are grouped into brotherhoods, and these again into clans or Schlachten (Geschlechter), corresponding to Roman gentes. Some of them could put as many as 500 warriors in the field. They took their names from ancestors and chieftains: the Wollersmannen, Hennemannen, Jerremannen, etc.; that is, the men of Woll, the men of Refine, the men of Jerre., In spite of these personal names the organization of the clans was by no means a monarchical one: it was based on the participation of the full-grown fighting men in the government of each clan and on a council of co-opted elders at the head of the entire federation. We need not repeat here what has already been stated about the mutual support which such clans afforded to their members in war and in peace, in judicial and in economic matters.  Scandinavia  We must point out some facts from the range of Scandinavian customs. In the mountainous districts of Norway we notice the same tendency towards the unification of holdings as in the plains and hills of Schleswig and Holstein. The bonder of Gudbrandsdalen and Telemarken, the free peasantry tilling the soil and pasturing herds on the slopes of the hills since the days of Harold Hrfagr to our own times, sit in Odalgaards, or freehold estates, from which supernumerary heirs are removed on receiving some indemnity, and which are protected from alienation into strange hands by the privilege of pre-emption exercised by relatives of the seller. Equally suggestive are some facts on the Danish side of the Straits. Here again we have to do with normal holdings independent of the number of coheirs, but dependent on the requirements of agricultureon the plough and oxen, on certain constant relations between the arable of an estate and its outlying commons, meadows and woods. The bl does not stand by itself like the Norwegian guard, but is fitted into a very close union with neighboring bids of the same kind. Practices of coaration, of open-field intermixture, of compulsory rotation of lot-meadows, of stinting the commons, arise of themselves in the villages of Denmark and Sweden. Laws compiled in the 13th century but based on even more ancient customs give us most interesting and definite information as to Scandinavian practices of allotment.  Conclusion  In conclusion, it seems that they may be stated under the following heads: # Primitive stages of civilization disclose in human society a strong tendency towards mutual support in economic matters as well as for the sake of defence. # The most natural form assumed by such unions for defence and co-operation is that of kinship. # In epochs of pastoral husbandry and of the beginnings of agriculture land is mainly owned by tribes, kindreds and enlarged households, while individuals enjoy only rights of usage and possession. # In course of time unions of neighbors are substituted for unions of kinsmen. # In Germanic societies the community of the township rests on the foundation of efficient holdingsbids, hides, hufenkept together as far as possible by rules of united or single succession. # The open-field system, which prevailed in the whole of Northern Europe for nearly a thousand years, was closely dependent on the customs of tribal and neighborly unions. # Even now the treatment of commons represents the last manifestations of ancient communal arrangements, and it can only be reasonably and justly interpreted by reference to the law and practice of former times.

She married the Austrian conductor Clemens Krauss in Frankfurt during her time there. She was Richard Strauss's favorite soprano, and he called her (\\"the most faithful of all the faithful\\"). She sang in the world premieres of four of his operas: Arabella (1933), Friedenstag (which was dedicated to Ursuleac and Krauss, 1938), Capriccio (1942), and the public dress-rehearsal of Die Liebe der Danae (1944). She appeared at the Salzburg Festival (1930‚Äì34 and 1942‚Äì43) and in one season at Covent Garden (1934) where she sang in the first performances in England of Jarom√≠r Weinberger's Schwanda the Bagpiper and Arabella (her favorite role). She also appeared as Desdemona in Verdi's Otello at the Royal Opera, with Lauritz Melchior in the name part, and Sir Thomas Beecham conducting. Ursuleac sang at La Scala in Strauss's Die Frau ohne Schatten (as the Empress), and Elektra (as Chrysothemis), Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte, and Wagner's Die Walk√ºre (as Sieglinde). Her only American appearances were at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, as Brang√§ne in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, opposite Kirsten Flagstad, in 1948. Also in her repertory were the Countess Almaviva (The Marriage of Figaro), Donna Elvira (Don Giovanni), Leonore (Fidelio), Senta (Der fliegende Holl√§nder, with Hans Hotter), Amelia Grimaldi (Simon Boccanegra), Amelia (Un ballo in maschera), Leonora (La forza del destino), √âlisabeth de Valois (Don Carlos), Tosca, Minnie (La fanciulla del West), Suor Angelica (opposite Luise Willer), Turandot (opposite Erna Berger's Li√π), Der Rosenkavalier, Ariadne auf Naxos (first as the Composer, then as Ariadne), Die √§gyptische Helena, etc. She was awarded the title of an Austrian Kammers√§ngerin in 1934, a Prussian Kammers√§ngerin in 1935. She gave her farewell in 1953 in Wiesbaden in Der Rosenkavalier. She was appointed professor at the Salzburg Mozarteum in 1964. The soprano recorded for Deutsche Grammophon in 1933, 1936, and 1943, with excerpts from Arabella, Le nozze di Figaro, Tosca, Turandot, Der Rosenkavalier, Il trovatore, and Capriccio, as well as two Lieder of Strauss. Ursuleac's voice was not of great beauty, at least as recorded, but she was reckoned a great musician and actress. In the words of one colleague, the soprano Hildegard Ranczak, \\"Although she had a lovely, facile top, I was constantly amazed at the two hours' vocalizing she went through before each performance. Hers was, in my opinion, a marvelously constructed, not really natural voice which she used with uncanny intelligence\\". Ursuleac died at the age of ninety-one in the village of Ehrwald in Tyrol where she had resided since before the death in 1954 of her husband, Clemens Krauss.

It separates from the first lumbar nerve along with the larger iliohypogastric nerve. It emerges from the lateral border of the psoas major just inferior to the iliohypogastric, and passes obliquely across the quadratus lumborum and iliacus. The ilioinguinal nerve then perforates the transversus abdominis near the anterior part of the iliac crest, and communicates with the iliohypogastric nerve between the transversus and the internal oblique muscle. It then pierces the internal oblique muscle, distributing filaments to it, and then accompanies the spermatic cord (in males) or the round ligament of uterus (in females) through the superficial inguinal ring. Its fibres are then distributed to the skin of the upper and medial part of the thigh, and to the following locations in the male and female: * In the male (\\"anterior scrotal nerve\\"): to the skin over the root of the penis and upper part of the scrotum. * In the female (\\"anterior labial nerve\\"): to the skin covering the mons pubis and labia majora. The ilioinguinal nerve does not pass through the deep inguinal ring, and thus only travels through part of the inguinal canal. It mediates the cremasteric reflex. Variations The size of this nerve is in inverse proportion to that of the iliohypogastric. Occasionally it is very small, and ends by joining the iliohypogastric; in such cases, a branch from the iliohypogastric takes the place of the ilioinguinal, or the latter nerve may be altogether absent.  Ilioinguinal nerve block  The ilioinguinal nerve is clinically important when considering an ilioinguinal or iliohypogastric nerve block. The indications for nerve block include anaesthesia for procedures involving the abdominal region such as inguinal herniorrhaphy or pain relief for procedures such as a c-section.

Biography  The actor and scriptwriter Ernest Dudley was the creator of the hit BBC radio crime series Dr Morelle and also the television series The Armchair Detective. The Dr Morelle ‚Äî 'the man you love to hate!' ‚Äî series which was hugely popular during the 1940s and 1950s and originally starred Dennis Arundell in the title role. In the fifties the role was given to Cecil Parker, who co-starred with Sheila Sim. He was born in Dudley, Worcestershire, and educated at Taplow School. He began his theatrical career acting in repertory in Ireland, later joining Charles Doran's Shakespeare company. He met and married the actress Jane Graham, while they were on tour in 1930. Dudley created Dr Morelle for a BBC Radio anthology programme Monday Night at Eight during the Second World War. He featured the character in many short stories and numerous novels as well as a stage play Dr Morelle, which he co-wrote with Arthur Watkyn. He appeared in the West End in numerous small parts, before taking a job with The Daily Mail during the late 1930s as a society reporter. He also began writing plays and crime series for BBC Radio. His popular radio series The Armchair Detective attracted more than ten million listeners a week. A TV series followed, as well as a film in 1952. In 1956 he bought a Jowett Jupiter with an unusual special body by Harold Radford. This had the merit (to Dudley) of being completely unlike any other car, and therefore unidentifiable. He and his wife had a daughter together. He was widowed in 1981 and remained working on novels, stories and scripts until his death, aged 97.

History The parish of Chippenham covers at the eastern end of Cambridgeshire. It is bordered by Suffolk to both the north (where the border follows the River Kennett) and the south (where the border follows the Icknield Way). To the east it is separated from Kennett, and to the west there are borders with Fordham and Snailwell, and a short border with Isleham. The present parish incorporates both the smaller medieval parish and the hamlet of Badlingham. Listed as Chipeham in the Domesday Book of 1086, the name \\"Chippenham\\" probably means \\"river meadow of a man called Cippa\\". Chippenham Park is a large country estate created by Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford. Church St Margaret's Church There has been a church in Chip since at least the 12th century which served both Chippenham and Badlingham. The present parish church has been dedicated to Saint Margaret of Antioch since 1279, and consists of a chancel with south chapel and north vestry, an aisled nave of seven bays, and a rectangular west tower. The oldest parts of the building date from the wer was rebuilt in the 15th century. The church has four 15th century wall paintings that were plastered over with psalms in the 17th century and rediscovered in the late 19th century. John Gauden, later Bishop of Exeter and Worcester, was vicar of Chippenham in the 1630s. Village life The village has one pub, The Tharp Arms, which was opened in 1704 on the High Street. In the 18th century it was known as the New Goat Inn after which it was renamed The Angel and then The Hope Inn before receiving its present name in 1910. There was also an outdoor beer tent listed in the village in the 1850s. Lord Orford founded the village's first school in 1708 and by 1712 a school building had been completed opposite the church (which survives today as a house). In 1821 additional space was added for junior children and children also attended from neighbouring Snailwell. In the mid-19th century the attendance was around 36, and after 1875 it rose steadily until there were 100 pupils in 1910. This then fell to 77 in 1919 and under 40 by the 1930s. In 1954 senior children were moved to Burwell and when numbers had fallen to only 25 juniors in 1978 the school closed, with the remaining children transferred to Isleham.Chippenham School A playground was built behind Tharp Way in 1980.

It lies on the Irish Sea shore near Ardglass, five miles southeast of Downpatrick. It is notable for its sycamore-lined main street. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 845 people.http://www.ninis.nisra.gov.uk/ NI Neighbourhood Information Service History In the 17th century Ulster ports began to rise in prominence. In 1625 William Pitt was appointed as Customer of the ports of Newcastle, Dundrum, Killough, Portaferry, Donaghadee, Bangor and Holywood. The village was originally known as St Anne's Port. The harbour was built in the 18th century by the Wards of Castle Ward house, just outside Strangford. A straight road still runs from Castle Ward to Killough. Killough was formerly in Rathmullan parish then transferred to Bright parish. The population in 1659 was 21. By 1821 it was 1,140 and in 1846 it was 1,148 with 224 houses, 51 families employed in agriculture; 126 in manufacturing or trade; 21 in professions; 118 in labouring jobs and 68 directing labour. In 1836 there was a Church of Ireland, two Methodist and a Catholic church. There were also some schools and an ancient well, St. Scordon's. The proprietor was Lord Bangor. Killough was full of bustling life in the 18th century. The village and port were the creation of Michael Ward of Castleward, the father of the first Lord Bangor and a justice of the King's Bench. From Norman times the Catholic Russell family held the manor of Killough, but they had been deprived of it after the rising of 1641. It was a place of little consequence, however, until Michael Ward turned his attention to it. He renamed it Port St. Anne, in honour of his wife, established a salt works and made a number of improvements to the harbour. The principal trade was the export of barley with fifteen ships and twenty boats engaged in fishing. After the outbreak of war between Great Britain and France in 1793 the growing of cereals increased in Lecale and Killough, as one of the ports of export, expanded to deal with it, until its population was almost double what it is today. The existing harbour facilities were soon inadequate and between 1821 and 1824, Michael Ward's son, the first Lord Bangor, employed the engineer Alexander Nimmo, to build new quays at a cost of ¬£17,000. The piers, a long one of nearly 600 ft on the Killough side and a short one of 100 ft on the Coney Island side, enclosed a fine harbour. The village prospered and the grain merchants built their imposing houses in Castle Street, and their stores on the narrow lane leading to the quays. For a brief period in the early 19th century, Killough was the busiest of the seaside villages of East Down and with its tree-lined main street, in many ways the most attractive. But when the post-war depression of the 1830s brought a fall in grain prices, merchants who had expanded in many fields during the inflationary period, soon found themselves in difficulty. For a time their reserves enabled them to keep going, but soon Killough saw one grain store after another close and its once busy harbour lay idle. The decline of the village was reflected in the population which fell from 951 in 1851 to 380 in 1937.http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rosdavies/PHOTOSwords/BrightAll.htm Ros Davies' Co.

The N√∫cleo Habitacional Novo Gama was created in t1980, by a real estate group called Economisa. With the fast population growth Luzi√¢nia recognized the necessity of dividing the space in districts, and the place was called district of Novo Gama. In 1995 it became independent of Luzi√¢nia.

It was a limited and CD only release to only 1,000 copies (some accounts suggest 1,200). Bitzcore Records re-released the album remastered and with a new \\"Derrick-style\\" cover artwork in 1999. This album - \\"a tribute to Blue √ñyster Cult\\" as claimed by the band themselves - is an attempt to dissociate from the Lo-Fi estethics of the garage scene: \\"When the rest of the punk oriented world tried hard to be lo-fi and 'real', Turbonegro as usual went the opposite way, creating a miniature suburban deathpunk opera. Seldom have pop culture, darkness and desperation blended so well.\\" Four songs from the Grunge Whore EP are also included here. On the CD-version there are three hidden tracks in the end of the final track: Bingo singing Staten och kapitalet, a 1970s radical left-wing progressive rock tune by Bl√• T√•get made into a national hit song in Sweden in 1980 by punk rock band Ebba Gr√∂n, Evel Knievel performing a poem named Why? and John Culliton Mahoney performing his song The Ballad of Evel Knievel.

The village is approximately north- east of Aberystwyth. The village has expanded since the 1970s with several housing estates being built. There are around 480 houses and an estimated population of 1,037 (2005). Most of the working population is employed in Aberystwyth or at the nearby Aberystwyth University, Institute of Biological and Environmental Research.  Facilities  Penrhyn-coch has a range of facilities including a school, post office, petrol station, social club, tennis courts, children's playground, two places of worship St. John's parish church and Horeb Nonconformist chapel, three halls and a nursery. Just outside the village is a Natural Resources Wales (formerly Forestry Commission) site named Gogerddan Allt Ddel, with hillwalking and picnic facilities. Penrhyncoch F.C. of the Cymru North league play at Cae Baker in the centre of the village.  History  The village of Penrhyn-coch is a recent development; in the 18th century there was no village, the land formed part of the Gogerddan Estate owned by the Pryse family. The village started to develop at the end of the 18th century, but major growth did not occur until after the break-up of the Gogerddan Estate in the 1940s. A memorial to the fallen of both World Wars who came from the village and surrounding area can be found outside the post office. The large block of quartz used for the memorial, according to a thesis published in 1939,The Modern Antiquarian  Penrhyn-Coch War Memorial (Banc Troed Rhiw Seiri Stone) (Standing Stone / Menhir) is an ancient standing stone. =Notable residents= Penrhyn-coch was the birthplace of the great 14th-century poet Dafydd ap Gwilym and home for a period in the 1750s to hydrographer and scholar Lewis Morris. Revered national librarian David Jenkins lived there since childhood. It is the chosen home of novelist Niall Griffiths.

Performed astounding feat of literary detective-work by discovering a fourth Bront√´ sister, Doreen Bront√´, and ghostwrote the autobiography of General \\"Tiger\\" Nidgett, but, as always, never received the recognition or payment he deserved. Finally retired to a disused lead mine in Derbyshire to work on a biography of Stephen Spender with only his pet toad, Amiel, for company. Mr Shuttleworth, a poultry farmer and part-time literary agent, is Birdbath's nearest neighbour, and sometimes relays items of literary news by shouting down the mineshaft. * Trevor Dimwiddie  \\"underwater motorcycling ace\\" of varying age, appearance and origins. See also Sir Sid Ballpoint. * Neville Dreadberg  avant-garde artist and self-publicist and husband of Pippa.

Named after the communists Palme Dutt and Ana Pauker, she is based on leftist pundits such as the Toynbee family. She anticipated Margaret Hodge. The running joke of the character is that she is, in reality, a bourgeois snob, for example \\"many of her friends who felt deeply about the future of the world had pointed out that the white Rhodesians as a whole were not merely white and reactionary but rather common as well\\".The Daily Telegraph, page 16, 9 September 1964 * Alderman Jabez Foodbotham  \\"the 25-stone, iron-watch-chained, crag-visaged, grim-booted\\" Lord Mayor of Bradford and \\"perpetual chairman of the Bradford City Tramways and Fine Arts Committee.\\"Peter Simple's World (1988), p. 31.

Many of the university's 77,000 alumni are working in key positions. Graduates also have the benefit of 'Watt Club' membership. This offers social events and networking opportunities. One unusual feature of many of the degree programmes is the option of inter-campus transfers to Heriot-Watt University's other campuses. Under the banner of the 'Go Global' scheme, students who commence their studies with Heriot-Watt University in Dubai can choose to spend a semester or a year at the one or more of the university's other campuses in Scotland or Malaysia. Students starting courses in Scotland or Malaysia can also transfer to Dubai. This is possible because Heriot-Watt University degree programmes are exactly the same at each campus.

They are divided into posterior and anterior divisions. Structure The lumbar nerves are five spinal nerves which arise from either side of the spinal cord below the thoracic spinal cord and above the sacral spinal cord. They arise from the spinal cord between each pair of lumbar spinal vertebrae and travel through the intervertebral foramina. The nerves then split into an anterior branch, which travels forward, and a posterior branch, which travels backwards and supplies the area of the back. = Posterior divisions = The middle divisions of the posterior branches run close to the articular processes of the vertebrae and end in the multifidus muscle. The outer branches supply the erector spinae muscles. The nerves give off branches to the skin. These pierce the aponeurosis of the greater trochanter. =Anterior divisions= The anterior divisions of the lumbar nerves () increase in size from above downward. The anterior divisions communicate with the sympathetic trunk. Near the origin of the divisions, they are joined by gray rami communicantes from the lumbar ganglia of the sympathetic trunk. These rami consist of long, slender branches which accompany the lumbar arteries around the sides of the vertebral bodies, beneath the Psoas major. Their arrangement is somewhat irregular: one ganglion may give rami to two lumbar nerves, or one lumbar nerve may receive rami (branches) from two ganglia. The first and second, and sometimes the third and fourth lumbar nerves are each connected with the lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk by a white ramus communicans. The nerves pass obliquely outward behind the Psoas major, or between its fasciculi, distributing filaments to it and the Quadratus lumborum. As the nerves travel forward, they create nervous plexuses. The first three lumbar nerves, and the greater part of the fourth together form the lumbar plexus. The smaller part of the fourth joins with the fifth to form the lumbosacral trunk, which assists in the formation of the sacral plexus. The fourth nerve is named the furcal nerve, from the fact that it is subdivided between the two plexuses. Divisions=First lumbar nerve= The first lumbar spinal nerve (L1)American Medical Association Nervous System  Groups of Nerves originates from the spinal column from below the lumbar vertebra 1 (L1). The three terminal branches of this nerve are the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, and the genitofemoral nerves. L1 supplies many muscles, either directly or through nerves originating from L1. They may be innervated with L1 as single origin, or be innervated partly by L1 and partly by other spinal nerves.

It is in the centre of the town just east of the market place. It is a member of the Greater Churches Group. The church has the status of collegiate church as it had a college of secular canons. In governance and religious observance it was similar to a cathedral (although not the seat of a bishop and without diocesan responsibilities). There is a Bishop of Warwick, but this is an episcopal title used by a suffragan bishop of the Diocese of Coventry. History The tower in 2016 =Foundation and early years= The church foundations date back nearly nine hundred years, being created by Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick, in 1123. In addition to founding the church, de Beaumont established the College of Dean and Canons at the church. The only surviving part of the Norman church which de Beaumont had built is the crypt. The chancel vestries and chapter house of the church were extensively rebuilt in the 14th century by a later Earl of Warwick, Thomas de Beauchamp (later pronounced Beecham), in the Perpendicular Gothic style. His descendants built the Chapel of Our Lady, commonly known as the Beauchamp Chapel. It contains the effigial monuments of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, and Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. Buried in the chancel of the church is William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton, the brother of Queen consort Catherine Parr.\\"Warter - Warwick-Bridge\\", A Topographical Dictionary of England (1848), pp. 475-482. Date accessed: 28 May 2011. =Sixteenth century to present= The college was dissolved in 1546, and the church was granted by the crown to the burgesses of Warwick. Before their destruction in the Civil War, Wencelaus Hollar copied many of the stained glass windows in the Beauchamp Chapel, showing heraldry of the Beauchamp family. The church, along with much of Warwick, was devastated by the Great Fire of Warwick in 1693. The nave and tower of the building were completely destroyed. In 1704, the rebuilt church was completed in a Gothic design by William Wilson (appointed by the Crown Commissioners). Sir Christopher Wren is also said to have contributed to the design, but that is disputed. The tower rises to the height of 130 feet. The design was described by John Summerson as being \\"as remarkable for its success as for its independence in style from other seventeenth-century English Gothic\\". =Deans of the College= *Robert Plesset, 1282 *Thomas de Sodynton, 1290 *William de Apperley, 1297 *Robert Tankard, 1306 *Richard de Alcester, 1313 *Robert de Geryn, 1314 *Robert de Lee, 1321 *Thomas Lench, 1338 *Robert de Endredeby, 1340 *Nicholas Southam, 1361 *Thomas Yonge, 1395 *John Porter, 1432 *Robert Cherbury, 1443 *William Berkswell, 14 *John Southwell, 1469 *Edmund Albone, M.D., 1481 *Richard Brackenburgh, 1485 *William Stokedale, 1498 *Edward Haseley, 1498 *Ralph Colingwode, 1507 *John Allestre, 1510 *John Carvanell, 1515 *John Knightley, 1542 Music=Organs= There are two organs in St. Mary's, the transept organ and one at the west end.

Structure The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh is a nerve of the lumbar plexus. It arises from the dorsal divisions of the second and third lumbar nerves (L2-L3). It emerges from the lateral border of the psoas major at about its middle, and crosses the iliacus muscle obliquely, toward the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). It then passes under the inguinal ligament, through the lacuna musculorum and then over the sartorius muscle into the thigh, where it divides into an anterior and a posterior branch. The anterior branch becomes superficial about 10 cm below the inguinal ligament, and divides into branches which are distributed to the skin of the anterior and lateral parts of the thigh, as far as the knee. The terminal filaments of this nerve frequently communicate with the anterior cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve, and with the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve, forming with them the peripatellar plexus. The posterior branch pierces the fascia lata, and subdivides into filaments which pass backward across the lateral and posterior surfaces of the thigh, supplying the skin from the level of the greater trochanter to the middle of the thigh. Entrapment is caused by compression of the nerve near the ASIS and inguinal ligament and is commonly known as Meralgia paraesthetica or Bernhardt-Roth syndrome.

Illegal opcodes were common on older CPUs designed during the 1970s, such as the MOS Technology 6502, Intel 8086, and the Zilog Z80. On these older processors, many exist as a side effect of the wiring of transistors in the CPU, and usually combine functions of the CPU that were not intended to be combined. On old and modern processors, there are also instructions intentionally included in the processor by the manufacturer, but that are not documented in any official specification. Overview While most accidental illegal instructions have useless or even highly undesirable effects (such as crashing the computer), some can have useful functions in certain situations. Such instructions were sometimes exploited in computer games of the 1970s and 1980s to speed up certain time-critical sections. Another common use was in the ongoing battle between copy protection implementations and cracking. Here, they were a form of security through obscurity, and their secrecy usually did not last very long. A danger associated with the use of illegal instructions was that, given the fact that the manufacturer does not guarantee their existence and function, they might disappear or behave differently with any change of the CPU internals or any new revision of the CPU, rendering programs that use them incompatible with the newer revisions. For example, a number of older Apple II games did not work correctly on the newer Apple IIc, because the latter uses a newer CPU revision 65C02 that does away with illegal opcodes. More recent CPUs, such as the 80186, 80286, 68000 and its descendants, do not have illegal opcodes that are widely known/used. Their manufacturers guarantee that the CPU will behave in a well-defined way when it finds an unknown opcode in the instruction stream; Usually this means triggering a certain exception or fault condition. The operating system's exception or fault handler will then usually terminate the application that caused the fault. Another, less common way of handling illegal instructions is by defining them to do nothing except taking up time and space (equivalent to the CPU's official NOP instruction); this method is used by the TMS9900 and 65C02 processors, among others. Alternatively, unknown instructions can be emulated in software (e.g. LOADALL), or even \\"new\\" pseudo- instructions can be implemented. Some BIOSes, memory managers, and operating systems take advantage of this, for example, to let V86 tasks communicate with the underlying system (\\"bop\\"). In spite of this manufacturer guarantee against such instructions, research using techniques such as fuzzing has uncovered a vast number of undocumented instructions in modern x86 processors. Some of these instructions are shared across processor manufacturers, indicating that Intel and AMD are both aware of the instruction and its purpose, despite it not appearing in any official specification. Other instructions are specific to manufacturers or specific product lines. The purpose of the majority of x86 undocumented instructions is unknown. Today, the details of these instructions are mainly of interest for exact emulation of older systems.

Primarily responsible for organising display jumps and representing the Singapore Armed Forces in competitions, the team adopted the name Red Lions in 1996 as part of its team identity. In 2014, Third Warrant Officer Shirley Ng became the first female Red Lion parachutist to jump at the National Day Parade in Singapore. They made their latest appearance at NDP 2020 during the pre-parade segment after bad weather during NDP 2015 and security reasons parachuting through the national stadium in NDP 2016 prevented them from doing so. Organisation The SAFPT comprises two entities: the display jumpers themselves, and the \\"central nucleus\\". Basic qualification for a display jumper is a minimum of 500 jumps, with its members drawn only from amongst the Commandos and the Naval Diving Unit as they are the only formations which are operationally trained in military free-fall. Training is usually conducted on weekends to avoid affecting operational responsibilities during the work week, as all free-fallers are also full-time servicemen. The central nucleus supports the display team's logistical and administrative needs, and plan and co-ordinate their training programme. As such, most of them are Parachute Jump Instructors from the Parachute Training Wing. Competitions As representing the SAF is one of the team's two main responsibilities, the SAFPT has participated and won awards in various competitions such as the Malaysia Prime Minister Challenge Trophy for Accuracy and the Australian Defence Force Parachuting Championship for Accuracy. The SAF's Red Lions Parachuting Team from the Commando Formation defeated 16 teams from 11 countries to set the new Asiania Four-way FS record and clinch the top award in the 12th Asiania Four- Way Formation Skydiving Championship, held from 29 October to 7 November at Fujairah, United Arab Emirates. The team, from the Commando Formation, also achieved the 1st Runner's Up position behind a team from Russia in the 1st Fujairah International Open Category Four-Way Formation Skydiving Championships in 2008. Safety Attention paid towards training safety has resulted in few incidents affecting team members, although a bad fall during a full-dress rehearsal for the 2005 National Day Parade by Master Sergeant Chua Koon San raised concerns and speculation that the free-fall performances may be cancelled. The Ministry of Defence however issued a reassurance that the show would carry on.

P. 409 Political turmoil The autonomous republic was proclaimed amid political turmoil in Azerbaijan. In June 1993 a military rebellion against president Abulfaz Elchibey broke out under the leadership of Colonel Surat Huseynov. Colonel Alikram Hummatov (Alikram Gumbatov), a close associate of Huseynov, and the leader of the Talysh nationalists, seized power in the southern part of Azerbaijan and proclaimed the new republic in Lankaran, escalating violence. However, as the situation settled and Heydar Aliyev rose to power in Azerbaijan, the Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic, which failed to gain any significant public support, was swiftly suppressed.Vladimir Socor. ¬´Talysh issue, dormant in Azerbaijan, reopened in Armenia¬ª, The Jamestown Foundation, May 27, 2005 Alikram Hummatov had to flee Lenkoran, when an estimated 10,000 protesters gathered outside his headquarters in the city to demand his ouster.The New York Times, 24.08.1993. Pro-Iranian is ousted According to Professor Bruce Parrott, Some observers believe that this revolt was part of a larger conspiracy to bring back to power the former president Ayaz M√ºtallibov.Humbatov received the support of former defense minister Rahim Gaziev and swore loyalty to former president Mutalibov. This revolt, which collapsed in August with almost no bloodshed, appeared to be part of the same larger design as Hussienov‚Äôs rebellion in Ganje. Thomas De Waal, Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through Peace and War, NYU Press, 2004One likely scenario is that this episode was another example of a powerful local warlord attempting to take advantage of the internal instability within Azerbaijan, on this occasion by appealing to ethnic Persian sentiment. Gummatov had previously benefited under Mutalibov and appears to have borne a grudge against Aliev. There are reports that the rebel colonel had at one time demanded as a price for the end of his rebellion the resignation of Aliev and the return to power of Mutalibov. Alvin Z. Rubinstein, Oles M. Smolansky. Regional Power Rivalries in the New Eurasia: Russia, Turkey, and Iran. M.E. Sharpe, 1995. , Hummatov was arrested and initially received death sentence which was subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. In 2004 he was pardoned and released from custody under pressure from the Council of Europe. He was allowed to immigrate to Europe after making a public promise not to engage in politics. However, those who were involved in proclamation of the autonomy say they always envisaged the autonomous republic as a constituent part of Azerbaijan. Ethnic status According to some, the Azerbaijani government has also implemented a policy of forceful integration of some minorities, including Talysh, Tat, Kurds and Lezgins.Christina Bratt (EDT) Paulston, Donald Peckham, Linguistic Minorities in Central and Eastern Europe, Multilingual Matters. 1853594164, pg 106 However, according to a 2004 resolution of Council of Europe: The above quote by the Council of Europe was only in reference to the improvements done by the government of Azerbaijan since 2003. The Communique, however, goes on to say: IFPRERLOM appealed to the Commission on Human Rights for the purpose of adopting a resolution, which urges Azerbaijan to guarantee the preservation of the cultural, religious and national identity of the Talysh people in light of repeated claims of repression.

She began her career as a soprano in 1942 and soon after began a lengthy and fruitful relationship with the Metropolitan Opera that spanned from 1944 until 1983. Under the advice of conductor Clemens Krauss, she began retraining her voice in the mezzo-soprano repertoire in 1953 and by 1956 had completely removed soprano literature from her performance repertoire. While the Met was Resnik's artistic home, she worked regularly as a guest artist with other major American opera companies and with the top European opera houses, including La Scala, the Paris Opera, the Royal Opera, London, the San Francisco Opera, and the Vienna State Opera. After the mid 1980s her performance career transitioned away from opera towards musical theater. In addition to performing, Resnik worked as a stage director at several European opera houses during the 1970s and 1980s, usually in collaboration with her husband, scenic and costume designer Arbit Blatas. She was also highly active as a voice teacher, teaching on the voice faculties of several music conservatories, including the Juilliard School. Early life and education Regina Resnick was born in The Bronx, New York City, on 30 August 1922 to impoverished Ukrainian Jewish immigrants who had just arrived in New York. Resnik dropped the \\"c\\" out of \\"Resnick\\" at an early age. At the age of 10 she volunteered to sing a solo in a concert at her local school. At the age of 13 she took her first lessons from Rosalie Miller, and soon afterwards won $10 appearing on Major Bowes Amateur Hour on public radio. A gifted student academically, Resnick skipped several school grades. She attended Herman Ridder Junior High School and then James Monroe High School in the Bronx where she had her first experience performing on the stage, singing leading roles in school productions of operettas and performing in her school's glee club. Resnick stated that \\"I owe my awareness of having a voice to the New York School system\\". After graduating from high school in 1938, she studied singing with Giuseppe Danise at Hunter College where she earned a B.A. in Music in 1942.  Performance career  Resnik made her professional singing debut at the age of 22 on October 27, 1942 giving a recital of art songs at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Just two months later she made her professional opera debut with Fritz Busch's New Opera Company at the Broadway Theatre in Manhattan as Lady Macbeth in Giuseppe Verdi's Macbeth with Jess Walters in the title role. In February and March 1943 she sang Leonore in Fidelio and Micaela in Carmen at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City under Erich Kleiber. In the Spring of 1944 she portrayed both Frasquita and Micaela in Georges Bizet's Carmen in the New York City Opera's (NYCO) first season with Dusolina Giannini in the title role. She was also seen at the NYCO that season as Santuzza in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. In April 1944 Resnik won the Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air, performing \\"Ernani, involami\\", and was offered a contract with that company for the 1944/45 season. Her debut at the Met was doubly dramatic ‚Äì on one day's notice she substituted on December 6, 1944, for Zinka Milanov as Leonora in Il trovatore eliciting acclaim from the public, the critics noting that all the vocal \\"virtuosity\\" and her stage presence as an actress were very impressive. During the next decade, she offered twenty heroines: Donna Elvira and Donna Anna (Don Giovanni), Fidelio, Sieglinde (Die Walk√ºre), Gutrune (G√∂tterd√§mmerung), Chrysothemis (Elektra), Rosalinda and Eboli (Don Carlos), Aida, Alice Ford (Falstaff), Tosca, Madama Butterfly and Musetta (La boh√®me). She was the Met's first Ellen Orford in Peter Grimes and created Delilah in the world premiere of Bernard Rogers' The Warrior. She then also began a long association with the San Francisco Opera. As for the voice, it was a dramatic soprano which invited comparison with Rosa Ponselle. During these years, her teacher was Rosalie Miller and her life began with the legendary conductors Otto Klemperer, Bruno Walter, George Szell, Fritz Reiner, William Steinberg and Erich Leinsdorf. In 1953, while singing Sieglinde at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the conductor Clemens Krauss was to forecast her future, suggesting her voice was actually a mezzo-soprano. Despite her great success as a soprano, she realized that her entire voice was constantly darkening in color. In 1955 she began a year of restudy with the celebrated baritone Giuseppe Danise. Her first two roles were Amneris in Aida and Laura in La Gioconda. On February 15, 1956, she debuted as a mezzo-soprano at the Metropolitan in a brilliant portrayal of Marina in Boris Godunov under Dimitri Mitropoulos. October, 1957, was the beginning of a long career in London at the Royal Opera House. Her debut as Carmen was a success and, in time, she was heard as Amneris (Aida), Marina (Boris Godunov), Ulrica (Un ballo in maschera), the Nurse in Die Frau ohne Schatten and the Old Prioress in Dialogues of the Carmelites. In the Zeffirelli-Giulini production of Falstaff, her Mistress Quickly became the model for this role. Carmen, Klytemnestra (Elektra), Mistress Quickly and the Pique Dame (The Queen of Spades) became her signature parts. From the French Press ‚Äì \\"Hers was the most skillfully inflected Carmen with every nuance of the role and every syllable of her French set forth in a masterly manner. It was also the most beautifully sung performance of the role. From the dramatic standpoint, this was the ideal Carmen ‚Äì ferocious, sultry, unpredictable; never banal, never vulgar.\\" But with Klytemnestra, Resnik met her greatest challenge ‚Äì \\"a dramatic conception that is unforgettable and a vocal prowess without limit.\\" Surely among the happiest memories are three comic masterpieces ‚Äì her Orlovsky in Die Fledermaus, the Marquise in La fille du r√©giment (with Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti) and her Mistress Quickly in the Bernstein-Zeffirelli Falstaff of 1964. Fluent singing in six languages, Resnik crossed stylistic lines from the classic to the romantic, the Wagnerian to the modern. As the years passed, Resnik developed a steady network of international performances: La Scala, La Fenice, the Paris Op√©ra (hailed as Carmen), Salzburg, Naples, Vienna, Lisbon, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Munich, Berlin, Brussels, Marseilles, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Chicago, Edinburgh, Santiago and a return to Bayreuth. The Met, however, remained her base and among her triumphs there was the new Elektra (with Birgit Nilsson and Leonie Rysanek) and The Queen of Spades. Outside the Met, she appeared in works by Poulenc (an unforgettable portrait of the Old Prioress in Dialogues of the Carmelites), Menotti (The Medium), Gottfried von Einem (The Visit of the Old Lady), Walton (The Bear), Weill (Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny), Britten (The Rape of Lucretia ‚Äì both Female Chorus and Lucretia) and Barber (her Baroness in Vanessa). She recorded all her great signature roles: Carmen (Thomas Schippers), Klytemnestra (Georg Solti), Mistress Quickly (Leonard Bernstein), Orlovsky (Herbert von Karajan), \\"Pique Dame\\" Countess (Mstislav Rostropovich) and Sieglinde (Clemens Krauss), among many others. She became the only singer in operatic history to have sung both the soprano and mezzo leads in much of her repertory. In the United States and Canada she has also appeared in countless regional companies. From 1971 until 1981, she distinguished herself as a stage director with Arbit Blatas, the Lithuanian-born painter and sculptor, as designer. Carmen (Hamburg; which became the film The Dream and the Destiny), Falstaff (Venice, Warsaw, Madrid, Lisbon), The Queen of Spades (Vancouver, Sydney), The Medium and The Bear (Lisbon), Elektra (Venice, Strasbourg, Lisbon) and Salome (Lisbon, Graz). In 1987, Resnik made a transition to the American musical theatre as a singing actress. Her Mrs. Schneider in Cabaret on Broadway earned her a Tony nomination and her Mme.

The join/meet of a maximal/minimal element and another element is the maximal/minimal element and conversely the meet/join of a maximal/minimal element with another element is the other element. Thus every pair in this poset has both a meet and a join and the poset can be classified as a lattice (order theory). In mathematics, specifically order theory, the join of a subset S of a partially ordered set P is the supremum (least upper bound) of S, denoted ‚ãÅS, and similarly, the meet of S is the infimum (greatest lower bound), denoted ‚ãÄS. In general, the join and meet of a subset of a partially ordered set need not exist. Join and meet are dual to one another with respect to order inversion. A partially ordered set in which all pairs have a join is a join-semilattice. Dually, a partially ordered set in which all pairs have a meet is a meet-semilattice. A partially ordered set that is both a join-semilattice and a meet-semilattice is a lattice. A lattice in which every subset, not just every pair, possesses a meet and a join is a complete lattice. It is also possible to define a partial lattice, in which not all pairs have a meet or join but the operations (when defined) satisfy certain axioms. The join/meet of a subset of a totally ordered set is simply its maximal/minimal element, if such an element exists. If a subset S of a partially ordered set P is also an (upward) directed set, then its join (if it exists) is called a directed join or directed supremum. Dually, if S is a downward directed set, then its meet (if it exists) is a directed meet or directed infimum. Partial order approach Let A be a set with a partial order ‚â§, and let x and y be two elements in A. An element z of A is the meet (or greatest lower bound or infimum) of x and y, if the following two conditions are satisfied: # z ‚â§ x and z ‚â§ y (i.e., z is a lower bound of x and y). # For any w in A, such that and , we have (i.e., z is greater than or equal to any other lower bound of x and y). If there is a meet of x and y, then it is unique, since if both z and z‚Ä≤ are greatest lower bounds of x and y, then and , and thus z = z‚Ä≤. If the meet does exist, it is denoted . Some pairs of elements in A may lack a meet, either since they have no lower bound at all, or since none of their lower bounds is greater than all the others. If all pairs of elements from A have a meet, then the meet is a binary operation on A, and it is easy to see that this operation fulfils the following three conditions: For any elements x, y, and z in A, :a. x ‚àß y = y ‚àß x (commutativity), :b. x ‚àß (y ‚àß z) = (x ‚àß y) ‚àß z (associativity), and :c. x ‚àß x = x (idempotency). Joins are defined dually, and the join of x and y in A (if it exists) is denoted by x ‚à® y. If not all pairs of elements from A have a meet (respectively, join), then the meet (respectively, join) can still be seen as a partial binary operation on A. Universal algebra approach By definition, a binary operation ‚àß on a set A is a meet if it satisfies the three conditions a, b, and c. The pair (A, ‚àß) is then a meet-semilattice. Moreover, we then may define a binary relation ‚â§ on A, by stating that if and only if x ‚àß y = x. In fact, this relation is a partial order on A. Indeed, for any elements x, y, and z in A, * x ‚â§ x, since x ‚àß x = x by c; * if x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ x, then x = x ‚àß y = y ‚àß x = y by a; and * if x ‚â§ y and y ‚â§ z, then x ‚â§ z, since then x ‚àß z = (x ‚àß y) ‚àß z = x ‚àß (y ‚àß z) = x ‚àß y = x by b. Note that both meets and joins equally satisfy this definition: a couple of associated meet and join operations yield partial orders which are the reverse of each other. When choosing one of these orders as the main ones, one also fixes which operation is considered a meet (the one giving the same order) and which is considered a join (the other one). Equivalence of approaches If (A, ‚â§) is a partially ordered set, such that each pair of elements in A has a meet, then indeed x ‚àß y = x if and only if , since in the latter case indeed x is a lower bound of x and y, and since clearly x is the greatest lower bound if and only if it is a lower bound. Thus, the partial order defined by the meet in the universal algebra approach coincides with the original partial order. Conversely, if (A, ‚àß) is a meet-semilattice, and the partial order ‚â§ is defined as in the universal algebra approach, and z = x ‚àß y for some elements x and y in A, then z is the greatest lower bound of x and y with respect to ‚â§, since :z ‚àß x = x ‚àß z = x ‚àß (x ‚àß y) = (x ‚àß x) ‚àß y = x ‚àß y = z and therefore . Similarly, , and if w is another lower bound of x and y, then w ‚àß x = w ‚àß y = w, whence :w ‚àß z = w ‚àß (x ‚àß y) = (w ‚àß x) ‚àß y = w ‚àß y = w. Thus, there is a meet defined by the partial order defined by the original meet, and the two meets coincide. In other words, the two approaches yield essentially equivalent concepts, a set equipped with both a binary relation and a binary operation, such that each one of these structures determines the other, and fulfil the conditions for partial orders or meets, respectively. Meets of general subsets If (A, ‚àß) is a meet-semilattice, then the meet may be extended to a well-defined meet of any non-empty finite set, by the technique described in iterated binary operations. Alternatively, if the meet defines or is defined by a partial order, some subsets of A indeed have infima with respect to this, and it is reasonable to consider such an infimum as the meet of the subset. For non-empty finite subsets, the two approaches yield the same result, and so either may be taken as a definition of meet. In the case where each subset of A has a meet, in fact (A, ‚â§) is a complete lattice; for details, see completeness (order theory).

SUBSAFE covers all systems exposed to sea pressure or critical to flooding recovery. All work done and all materials used on those systems are tightly controlled to ensure the material used in their assembly as well as the methods of assembly, maintenance, and testing are correct. They require certification with traceable quality evidence which track the item from the point of manufacture (including all records of the creation of the product, i.e. source materials as well as smelting and hardening process for metals) to the point of installation within a SUBSAFE boundary. These measures increase the cost of submarine construction and maintenance. SUBSAFE addresses only flooding; mission assurance is not a concern, simply a side benefit. Other safety programs and organizations regulate such things as fire safety, weapons systems safety, and nuclear reactor systems safety. From 1915 to 1963, the United States Navy lost 16 submarines to non-combat related causes. Since SUBSAFE began in 1963, only one submarine, the non-SUBSAFE-certified , has been lost. History On 10 April 1963, while on a deep test dive about 200 miles off the northeast coast of the United States, was lost with all hands. The loss of the lead ship of a new, fast, quiet, deep-diving class of submarines led the Navy to re-evaluate the methods used to build its submarines. A \\"Thresher Design Appraisal Board\\" determined that, although the basic design of the was sound, measures should be taken to improve the condition of the hull and the ability of submarines to control and recover from flooding casualties. It included addressing the following issues on Thresher: * Some silver-brazed joints could have been sub-standard. One or more of these joints is believed to have failed, resulting in flooding in the engine room. * The crew was unable to access vital equipment to stop the flooding. * Saltwater spray on electrical components caused short circuits, reactor shutdown, and loss of propulsion power. * The main ballast tank blow system failed to operate properly at test depth. Various restrictions in the air system coupled with excessive moisture in the system probably led to ice formation in the blow system piping. The resulting blockage caused an inadequate blow rate. Consequently, the submarine was unable to overcome the increasing weight of water rushing into the engine room. SUBSAFE certification SUBSAFE certification is carried out in four areas; Design, Material, Fabrication, & Testing. The exact procedures are documented in the initial design & construction for new submarines, while undergoing routine maintenance in naval depots, and in the fleet maintenance manual for operating submarines. During each step, quality evidence is collected, reviewed, approved, and stored for the life of the submarine. This process is reinforced with external and internal audits. NASA After the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board described SUBSAFE as \\"successful safety programs and practices that could be models for NASA\\". Following this recommendation, a number of exchanges and conferences have been held between SUBSAFE naval personnel and NASA.

He played a critical role in the development of the community of Bronxville, New York,If You're Thinking of Living In: Bronxville, NY Times, by James Feron, January 29, 1984 an affluent suburb of New York City defined by magnificent homes and charming garden apartments in a country-like setting. His name is attached to the Lawrence Park Historic District and real estate brokerage Houlihan Lawrence. 2017 REAL Trends 500 by Volume, 2017 Lawrence is buried at the Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. Development of Bronxville, New York Lawrence used his wealth to pursue a wide variety of entrepreneurial and philanthropic enthusiasms. One of these was the development of real estate. In 1889, at the suggestion of his brother-in-law, he came out on the New York and Harlem Railroad to the small village of Bronxville to examine the prospects of a former farm of approximately near the railroad station. He appreciated the possibilities of the property and its convenient location and purchased the entire property the following year. He envisioned a planned community of well-designed and well-built suburban homes. The lots were relatively modest in size and irregular in shape. They were not intended to be estates for the rich but sites large enough for comfortable middle-class homes, each planned to take advantage of the natural setting. The narrow, meandering roads were laid out to follow the contours of the land, and existing trees were preserved whenever possible. He hired an architect by the name of William Augustus Bates to design the first houses of the development, to be called 'Lawrence Park'. Bates had a versatile style that borrowed freely from the many different styles in fashion at the turn of the 20th century. He favored certain features such as large bays with multiple windows and round or octagonal towers with conical roofs. The first houses sold quickly and Bates went on to design most houses in the neighborhood. The development soon proved to be a success, and within a couple of decades most of the original property was developed and Lawrence bought more land to extend its boundaries. The newer sections were designed primarily in the Tudor Revival or Colonial Revival style; however, Bates' nineteenth-century blends of Romantic forms remain the most admired. The Lawrence Park Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Lawrence's business plan was designed to attract a friendly, homogenous population of upper-middle-class residents - professionals, business managers, and the like. The development proved particularly attractive to established artists who were successful commercial painters, illustrators, and sculptors. It soon became a community within a community, very close-knit and proud of its special qualities. It was never intended to be socially or economically diverse. Even its complex of townhomes, Merestone Terrace, was designed and constructed to much higher standards than ordinary multi-family housing in order to attract more affluent clients. Limiting most construction to one-family homes on large lots helped to discourage people of limited financial means from settling there. It was hoped that these measures, combined with restrictive covenants or \\"gentleman's agreements,\\" would maintain the white, Protestant, affluent, suburban character for decades.The New York Times, July 17, 1933, 1 continued There was nothing subtle or hidden about this agenda. Lawrence Park proudly advertised in House and Garden in 1925: \\"Restrictions? Yes! Bronxville has been carefully guarded in its development.... The index of desirability has always been character, culture, and the ability to fit easily and naturally into the social scheme.\\"Eloise Morgan, ed., Building a Suburban Village: Bronxville, New York 1898 - 1998, 18 Contributions The Lawrence estate home \\"Westlands,\\" now an administrative building and dormitory at Sarah Lawrence College William Van Duzer Lawrence left behind several significant institutions including Sarah Lawrence College and Lawrence Hospital. One of his legacies directly was connected to Lawrence Park: Houlihan Lawrence, one of the nation's larger real estate firms, is a direct descendant of Lawrence Park Realty Company. * Sarah Lawrence College - Founded in 1926 on the grounds of his estate, the college is named in honor of his wife, Sarah. From its inception, the college was intended to provide instruction in the arts and humanities for women. Its pedagogy, modeled on the tutorial system of Oxford University, combined independent research projects, individually supervised by the teaching faculty, and seminars with low student-to-faculty ratio - a pattern it retains, despite its cost, to the present. Followed by Bennington College, Sarah Lawrence was the first liberal arts college in the United States to incorporate a rigorous approach to the arts with the principles of progressive education, focusing on the primacy of teaching and the concentration of curricular efforts on individual needs. * Lawrence Hospital - This institution was created when Lawrence's son Dudley nearly died en route to a hospital in neighboring New York City. Lawrence embodied ideas from the Progressivist movement of the 1890s, especially his view that the arts were a crucial element in the social evolution of individuals and families in developing both private and public sensibilities as well as creating equal relations between men and women. Family William and Sarah Lawrence had five children: Alice (1868-1869), Louise Lawrence Meigs (1870-1965), Arthur W. Lawrence (1875-1937), Anna Lawrence Bisland (1873-1950), and Dudley B. Lawrence (1880-1970). Anna and her husband, Pressley Bisland, were the foster parents of poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who had been left at their Plashbourne Estate by his maternal aunt‚Äîthe Bisland's French governess. The Lawrence children and grandchildren continued to run their father's real estate business until 1990 when it was acquired by another local family. The Lawrence family boasts an impressive ancestry said to descend from Sir Robert Lawrence of Ashton Hall, Lancashire, England, who accompanied Richard Coeur de Lion in the Third Crusade. John Lawrence, who arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1635, was a patentee of Hempstead, New York under Dutch governor William Kieft and served as a three-term mayor of New York City. William Lawrence (1620‚Äì82), along with John, held additional patents and settled a large portion of present-day Flushing and Bayside in Queens. Another notable ancestor was War of 1812 martyr Captain James Lawrence, whose dying wish, \\"Don't give up the ship,\\" is immortalized in American history.

It could be served with a variety of ·ªçb·∫π (soups), such as ·∫πf·ªç, il√°, ew√©d√∫, ogbono or gbegiri (black-eyed beans soup). Types There are three types of √†m√†l√†: √†m√†l√† isu, √†m√†l√† l√°f√∫n and \\"amala ogede\\" =Yam flour (√†m√†l√† isu)= This is the most common type of √†m√†l√† which is derived from yam. The particular yam specie best for preparing √†m√†l√† is Dioscorea cayenensis because of its high starch content. Yam, the common name for species in the genus Dioscorea, grows in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Oceania, and Latin America. However, 95% of it is cultivated and harvested in West Africa. Yam is consumed in many different forms including boiled, roasted, baked, fried and conversion into flours. The perishability nature of yam due to its high moisture content suggests the need to process it into less perishable products such as yam flour through drying process. The flour can be reconstituted with hot water to form a paste or gel called Kokonte in Ghana and \\"Amala in Nigeria. √Äm√†l√† isu is made of dried yam. This gives it a black/brownish colour when added to boiling water. Amala is rich in carbohydrates owning to the fact that yam is an important source of carbohydrate for many people of the Sub Saharan region especially in the yam zone of west Africa. =Cassava flour (√†m√†l√† l√°f√∫n)= The second type is √†m√†l√† l√°f√∫n, made from cassava flour. Dried cassava flour is known as ‚Äúlafun‚Äù in Nigeria and ‚Äúkokente‚Äù in Ghana. Cassava is a woody shrub of the Euphorbiaceae (spurge) family. Cassava and yam are the most important source of food carbohydrate in Nigeria. Nigeria is the world's largest producer of cassava. Cassava flour, when used as a dry powder makes √†m√†l√† l√°f√∫n. Fermented and flaky, it is called Garri, another common dish, most often eaten by the Ijebu people. =Plantain flour (Amala ogede)= Another type of Amala is elubo ogede (which is usually lighter in color). The low carbohydrate level in plantain flour makes it a good diet for people diagnosed of diabetics and others who need a low-carbohydrate food. Unripe plantain is peeled, dried, and grated into boiling water to become amala ogede, light brown in colour when cooked. Preparation The only ingredient needed when making √†m√†l√† is boiling water and one of the desired types of flour. Once the water has come to a boil, the heat is reduced. The flour is added and stirred until all the water is absorbed. More hot water is added, then the dough is left to simmer for approximately five minutes. Then the dough is kneaded until it has the desired texture. Kneading the dough into a smooth paste is the most difficult part of making √†m√†l√†. Diverse Soups for the Dish √Äm√†l√† can be eaten with various soups: * Egusi: soup made of thickened melon seeds and leaf vegetables * Ewedu soup: made from cooked and grated Corchorus leaves with or without a small quantity of egusi and/or locust beans. * Okro soup: made from okra * Efo riro: made from vegetables and a mixture of meat, fish, etc. * Ogbono soup: made from ground ogbono seeds and a mixture of stock fish and locust beans added as garnish * Gbegiri soup, made from dried beans See also * Eba * Fufu * List of African dishes * Nigerian cuisine ReferencesExternal links *habeeb olonje Category:Nigerian cuisine Category:Staple foods Category:Yoruba cuisine Category:Food paste ","title":"Amala (food)"},{"id":"3956717","text":"Sippy can refer to the following: People * G.

The parish lies wholly with the South Downs National Park. The planning authority for Pyecombe is therefore the South Downs National Park Authority (SDNPA), the statutory planning authority for the National Park area. Pyecombe is located 7 miles (11 km) to the north of Brighton. The civil parish covers an area of and has a population of 200 (2001 census), increasing at the 2011 Census to a population of 237. History The word 'Pyecombe' is thought to derive from the Saxon name \\"peac cumb\\" which means 'the peak valley'. The parish of Pyecombe comprises two settlements, one called 'Pyecombe' and the other 'Pyecombe Street'. These are about a quarter of a mile apart. The reason for the gap between the two parts of the village is unclear but it is generally thought to be a consequence of plague in the 17th century which necessitated the temporary abandonment of the main settlement and its church. The village lies on the London to Brighton Way Roman road, as well as on 18th and 19th century turnpike roads over Clayton Hill. Listed Buildings and Scheduled Monuments Pyecombe civil parish contains seven listed buildings. Of these, one is Grade I and the remaining six are Grade II. The parish contains five scheduled monuments. =Listed buildings= Grade I listed buildings: * The Parish Church (Church of the Transfiguration) (List Entry Number 1025593). Chancel and nave 12th century, tower 13 century; 'an attractive small medieval building'. =Scheduled monuments= * Roman road and 18th century coaching road north of Pyecombe church (List Entry Number 1005821). The monument includes a Roman road and a late 18th century coaching road, the Brighton to Lovell Heath Turnpike, with 19th century realignments. * Cross dyke and bowl barrow 310m south east of Wolstonbury Camp (List Entry Number 1015226), a univallate cross dyke and a bowl barrow situated on a chalk spur which projects to the south east from Wolstonbury Hill. * Platform barrow 300m south of Wolstonbury Camp (List Entry Number 1015227), a roughly circular, flat-topped mound situated on a chalk spur which projects to the south east from Wolstonbury Hill. * Romano-British farmstead, field system and trackway on Wolstonbury Hill (List Entry Number 1015228), a farmstead dating to the late Romano-British period and its associated field system and trackway, on the north eastern slope of Wolstonbury Hill. * Wolstonbury Camp: a Ram's Hill type enclosure on Wolstonbury Hill and associated later remains (List Entry Number 1016153), a Late Bronze Age Ram's Hill type enclosure situated on Wolstonbury Hill, a clay-with-flints capped chalk hill. The Church of the Transfiguration Pyecombe Church, R. H. Nibbs The Church of the Transfiguration is the Church of England parish church of Pyecombe. The chancel and nave are 12th century; the tower was built in the 13th century. A small kitchen / toilet extension was built on the south side of the church in 2014, finished in flint to match the rest of the church. The extension won the Sussex Heritage Trust ecclesiastical award in 2015. The church is a Grade I listed building, described in the National Heritage List for England as an ‚ÄòAttractive small medieval building‚Äô. Wolstonbury Hill Wolstonbury Hill is a chalk prominence located within the parish, owned and maintained by the National Trust.

He was Archbishop of Milan from 1980 to 2002 and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1983. A towering intellectual figure of the Roman Catholic Church, Martini was the liberal contender for the Papacy in the 2005 conclave, following the death of Pope John Paul II. According to highly placed Vatican sources, Martini received more votes in the first round than Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the conservative candidate: 40 to 38. Ratzinger ended up with more votes in subsequent rounds and was elected Pope Benedict XVI. Martini entered the Society of Jesus in 1944 and was ordained a priest in 1952. His appointment as Archbishop of Milan in 1980 was an unusual circumstance, as Jesuits are not traditionally named bishops. He was on the liberal wing of the church hierarchy. Suffering from a rare form of Parkinson's disease, he retired as archbishop in 2002 and moved to the Pontifical Institute in Jerusalem. He died at the Jesuit Aloisianum College in Gallarate near Milan. Hours after his death, the Italian daily Corriere della Sera printed his final interview, in which he described the church as \\"200 years out of date.\\" \\"Our culture has aged, our churches are big and empty and the church bureaucracy rises up. The Church must admit its mistakes and begin a radical change, starting from the Pope and the bishops. The pedophilia scandals oblige us to take a journey of transformation.\\"L'ADDIO A MARTINI, \\"Chiesa indietro di 200 anni\\", L'ultima intervista: \\"Perch√© non-si scuote, perch√© abbiamo paura?\\" Corriere della Sera, 1 settembre 2012Translated final interview with Martini National Catholic Reporter (NCR), 4 September 2012Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, his final interview, and a damning critique that has rocked the Catholic Church The Independent, 3 September 2012 Early life and education Carlo Maria Martini was born 15 February 1927 in Orbassano in the Province of Turin, Piedmont, to Leonardo, an engineer, and Olga (n√©e Maggia) Martini. He was baptised on the following 22 February. He was educated at Istituto Sociale, a school run by Jesuits in Turin. He entered the Society of Jesus on 25 September 1944 and was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Maurilio Fossati on 13 July 1952.Pianigiani, Gaia. \\"Cardinal Carlo Martini, Papal Contender, Dies at 85\\", The New York Times, 31 August 2012 Martini completed his studies in philosophy at the Jesuits' House of Studies in Gallarate, in the province of Milan, and theology at the faculty of theology in Chieri. In 1958, Martini was awarded his doctorate in fundamental theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University, with a thesis exploring the problems of the Resurrection accounts. After some years of teaching at the faculty of Chieri, he returned to Rome and earned another doctorate in Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute, graduating summa cum laude, with a thesis on a group of codices of the Gospel of Luke. Academic career After completing his studies, Martini quickly pursued a successful academic career. In 1962, he was given the Chair of Textual Criticism at the Pontifical Biblical Institute. In 1969 he was appointed rector of the Pontifical Biblical Institute.Shaw, Russell. \\"What Cardinal Martini Said, and What He Didn‚Äôt Say\\", The Catholic World Report, 20 September 2012 Throughout these years, he edited a number of scholarly works. Martini became active in the scientific field by publishing various books and articles. Furthermore, he received the honour of being the only Catholic member of the ecumenical committee that prepared the new Greek edition of the New Testament, the Novum Testamentum Graece. In 1978, under Pope Paul VI, he was nominated to become the rector magnificus of the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he served until his appointment to the episcopacy. Episcopate and cardinalate On 29 December 1979, Pope John Paul II appointed Martini as Archbishop of Milan, receiving his episcopal consecration from the Pope himself the following 6 January, with Archbishop Eduardo Mart√≠nez Somalo and Bishop Ferdinando Maggioni serving as co- consecrators. Thus his first diocesan appointment was to one of the largest and most prominent sees. In the consistory of 2 February 1983, he was assigned the title of Cardinal-Priest of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. The motto he chose for his coat of arms is translated as \\"For the love of truth, dare to choose adverse situations\\". Martini in 2006 Martini served as Relator of the 6th General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in 1983, and as President of the European Bishops' Conference between 1987 and 1993. In 1987, he began the socalled \\"cathedra of non-believers\\" (in Italian: cattedra dei non-credenti) which was conceived together with the Italian philosopher Massimo Cacciari. It was a series of public dialogues hel in Milan with some gnostic or atheist scientists and intellectuals on the matters of bioethics, the social doctrine of the Church and the reasons to believe in God. In 1996, Martini was presented with an honorary doctorate from the Russian Academy of Sciences. In Spain in October 2000, he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Sciences. Martini was admitted as a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in November 2000. Martini was one of a group of like-minded prelates who met annually from 1995 to 2006 in St. Gallen, Switzerland, to discuss reforms with respect to the appointment of bishops, collegiality, bishops' conferences, the primacy of the papacy, and sexual morality; they differed among themselves, but shared the view that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was not the sort of candidate they hoped to see elected at the next conclave. In 2002, Martini reached the Catholic Church's mandatory retirement age of 75 and was succeeded in Milan by Dionigi Tettamanzi. At the time of the 2005 conclave, he was 78 years old and hence eligible to vote for the new Pope (being under 80). For years many \\"progressive\\" Catholics harboured hopes that he might eventually ascend to the papacy, but when John Paul II died, most commentators believed that his election was unlikely, given his liberal reputation and apparent frailty. Nevertheless, according to La Stampa (an Italian newspaper), he obtained more votes than Joseph Ratzinger during the first round of the election (40 vs. 38). Conversely, an anonymous cardinal's diary stated that he never mustered more than a dozen or so votes, in contrast to another Jesuit cardinal, Jorge Bergoglio of Buenos Aires, and quickly withdrew his candidacy.Catholic News Service. Article based on diary says German cardinal became pope with 84 votes 23 September 2005 Upon reaching the age of 80 on 15 February 2007, Martini lost his right to vote in future conclaves. In June 2012, when Pope Benedict XVI was contemplating retirement and was being urged not to retire by some of his closest confidants, Martini, suffering himself from Parkinson's, urged him to follow through on his decision to resign. After his retirement, Martini moved to the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Jerusalem to continue his work as a biblical scholar. He returned to Milan in 2008 where he spent his final years in a Jesuit house. Death and funeral Martini died in Gallarate on 31 August 2012. According to an online Zenit news statement about his death, Pope Benedict XVI, in his formal message of condolence sent by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican Secretary of State, praised Martini's strength during his struggle with Parkinson's, his long service as Archbishop of Milan and his work as a scholar of the Bible. The Mayor of Milan, Giuliano Pisapia, led the tributes by saying, \\"Carlo Maria Martini illuminated the way for the entire city, not just for part of it. For this reason, today more than ever, Milan mourns its Archbishop.\\" More than 150,000 people passed before Martini's casket in the metropolitan cathedral of Milan before the Requiem Mass, following the Ambrosian rite, on 3 September. Alt URL At the beginning of the ceremony, the representative of Pope Benedict, Angelo Cardinal Comastri, vicar general of the Vatican City, read a message. Cardinal Scola presided over the concelebrated Mass and delivered the homily. At the end of the Mass, Cardinal Tettamanzi read his remembrance. Concelebrating with Cardinal Scola were Cardinals Comastri, Tettamanzi, Bagnasco, Piovanelli, Romeo, and Ravasi. Also present were the sister of Martini, Maris, his niece Giulia, and his nephew Giovanni. In attendance were Father Adolfo Nicol√°s SJ, superior general of the Society of Jesus, and representatives of other Christian denominations and the Jewish and Muslim communities. The Italian government was represented by Prime Minister Mario Monti and his wife. In a private ceremony Martini was buried in a tomb on the left side of the cathedral facing the main altar. Views Often considered to be one of the more liberal cardinals, Martini achieved widespread notice for his writings. On occasion Martini's views proved to be controversial, thus bringing him comparatively large amounts of media coverage. In the final interview he gave, shortly before his death, he urged major reforms to the Catholic Church, calling it \\"200 years out of date\\" and arguing that, \\"Our culture has aged, our churches are big and empty, and the church bureaucracy rises up, our rituals and our cassocks are pompous\\". Martini was known to be \\"progressive\\" on matters concerning human relationships, the possible ordination of women to the diaconate, and some bioethical questions, notably contraceptive use in certain more complex situations. =Dominus Iesus= In 2000, he criticized Dominus Iesus, a declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that the Catholic Church is the sole true Church of Christ, and described the document as \\"theologically rather dense, peppered with quotations, and not easy to grasp\\".Dominus Iesus: An Ecclesiological Critique =Contraception= In April 2006, in response to a very specific question from physician and politician Ignazio Marino, director of the transplant centre of the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Martini opined: \\"The use of condoms can, in certain situations, be a lesser evil\\".Time Magazine, 1 May 2006. He stressed the particular case of married couples where one has HIV or AIDS.BBC. Cardinal backs limited condom use 21 April 2006. But he quickly noted that the principle of the lesser evil in such cases is one thing, and quite another the subject who has to convey those things publicly, thus it is not up to the Church authorities to support condom use publicly, because of \\"the risk of promoting an irresponsible attitude\\". The Church is more likely to support other morally sustainable means, such as abstinence.L'Espresso. When Does Life Begin? Cardinal Martini Replies 20 May 2006 On another occasion, the Cardinal stated that \\"I believe the Church's teaching has not been expressed so well. ...I am confident we will find some formula to state things better, so that the problem is better understood and more adapted to reality.\\"BBC. Profile: Cardinal Carlo Martini 19 April 2005. In the 2008 book-interview entitle Nighttime conversations in Jerusalem, cardinal Martini stated that \\"many people have withdrawn from the Church, and the Church from people\\", due to the 1968 encyciclical Humanae vitae which prohibited the artificial contraception. According to the cardinal, pope John Paul II followed the path of rigorous application and for some periods evaluated to sign a pontifical declaration under the privilege of papal infallibility, concluding that \\"probably the pope [Benedict XVI] will not revoke the encyclical, but he might write one that would be its continuation. I am firmly convinced that the Church can point out a better way than it did with Humanae Vitae. Being able to admit one's mistakes and the limitations of one's previous viewpoints is a sign of greatness of soul and of confidence. The Church would regain credibility and competence.\\" =Beginning of human life= Martini's position on the start of a distinct human life during the fertilization of oocytes was rebuked by certain Vatican officials.L'Espresso. Carlo Maria Martini's \\"Day After\\" 20 May 2006 =Right to refuse treatments= Martini, speaking about the right to die debate, said that \\"terminally ill patients should be given the right to refuse treatments and that the doctors who assist them should be protected by law.\\"National Catholic Reporter. The schism that hasn't been between Ratzinger and Martini 20 February 2007 It is traditional Catholic moral teaching that one is morally bound to apply \\"ordinary\\" treatments, but not \\"extraordinary\\" treatments.David Bohr, Catholic Moral Tradition (Our Sunday Visitor Publishing 1999 ), p. 311David F. Kelly, Medical Care at the End of Life (Georgetown University Press 2006 ), p. 3 The distinction was the basis of the declaration by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1980 that \\"when inevitable death is imminent in spite of the means used, it is permitted in conscience to take the decision to refuse forms of treatment that would only secure a precarious and burdensome prolongation of life, so long as the normal care due to the sick person in similar cases is not interrupted.\\"Declaration on euthanasia Iura et bona, 5 May 1980 The Catechism of the Catholic Church also states: \\"Discontinuing medical procedures that are burdensome, dangerous, extraordinary, or disproportionate to the expected outcome can be legitimate\\".Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2278 Martini, in fact, refused medical treatment as his illness advanced. =Collegiality of bishops= Martini in 2010 Martini called for greater collegiality in the governance of the Church and urged continued reflection on the structure and exercise of ecclesiastical authority.Catholic World News. Cardinal Martini repeats call for decentralized Church government 7 April 2004 =Role of women in the Church= Martini demonstrated a desire for further theological enquiry on issues relating to human sexuality and the role of women in the Church and expressed support for the ordination of female deacons.Gaia Pianigani, Cardinal Carlo Martini, Papal Contender, Dies at 85, 31 August 2012, The New York Times. =Sacramentum caritatis= In March 2007, some advocates of gay rights interpreted him as openly criticising the attitude of the Church authorities. While speaking at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem to a congregation of over 1,300 visitors, he remarked that \\"the Church does not give orders.\\" Martini stated: \\"It is necessary to listen to others, and when speaking to use terms that they understand.\\" These remarks came days after Pope Benedict XVI published the 140-page apostolic exhortation Sacramentum caritatis, a document giving the conclusions of the 2005 Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops.

It is not bad, instead of casual sex between men, that two people have a certain stability\\" and that the \\"state could recognize them.\\" Although he stated his belief that \\"the homosexual couple, as such, can never be totally equated to a marriage\\", he also said that he could understand (although not necessarily approve of) gay pride parades when they support the need for self- affirmation.Martini and Marino, Credere e conoscere, 2012;Terence Weldon, Cardinal Martini, on Gay Partnerships , 29 March 2012, Queering The Church.

Featuring the voice talents of Michelle Nicastro, Howard McGillin, Jack Palance, John Cleese, Steven Wright, Sandy Duncan, and Steve Vinovich, the film is directed by former Disney animation director, Richard Rich, with a music score by Lex de Azevedo. The film was distributed by New Line Cinema in the United States and by Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International outside the US (though Sony would gain the home video rights to the film worldwide via a deal with the production company Nest Entertainment). It was released theatrically on November 18, 1994, and grossed $9.8 million against a $21 million budget, becoming a box office bomb, partly due to struggling competition with a re-release of The Lion King (1994). The film would later become popular through home video releases and has since been followed by nine direct-to-video sequels and is the only film of the series to have a wide theatrical release. The theme song \\"Far Longer than Forever\\" is performed by Regina Belle and Jeffrey Osborne. The song was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1995 for Best Original Song.  Plot  King William's (Dakin Matthews) chancellor, Sir Rothbart (Jack Palance), plans to take King William's kingdom for himself by mastering a type of dark magic known as The Forbidden Arts. Before he can strike, Rothbart is arrested. Despite calls for his death, King William spares Rothbart's life and banishes him forever. A hateful Rothbart swears revenge on King William and tells him that he will one day get his power back and take everything William owns and loves, but is banished to the evil and dangerous Swan Lake, which he makes his home. King William and his friend, Queen Uberta (Sandy Duncan), make their children, Odette and Derek, meet every summer, hoping that they will fall in love and marry, uniting their two kingdoms. When they meet for the first time, the royal children take an immediate dislike towards each other, but as the years pass they somehow reformed themselves and gradually fall in love. However, Derek (Howard McGillin) only expresses love for Odette's (Michelle Nicastro) beauty and she and her father leave disappointed. On their journey home, they are ambushed by Rothbart, who is now a sorcerer and transforms into a \\"Great Animal\\" with his new powers, kidnapping Odette and fatally injuring William. Derek arrives on the scene and William tells him about the Great Animal (\\"It's not what it seems\\"), and that Odette is gone before dying. After searching and finding no sign of Odette, the entire kingdom assumes that she is dead. Uberta encourages her son to find another princess, but Derek is determined to find Odette, believing that she is still alive. Derek and his best friend Bromley (Joel McKinnon Miller) practice hunting every day in preparation to face the Great Animal, with help from Uberta's valet, Lord Rogers (Mark Harelik). Elsewhere, Rothbart is keeping Odette captive at Swan Lake. He has cast a powerful spell that turns Odette into a swan during the day. At night, she can become human temporarily if she is on the lake when the moonlight touches it. Every night, Rothbart asks Odette to marry him so he can rule William's kingdom legally, but she refuses, then the moonlight leaves the lake, and she turns back into a swan. During her captivity, she befriends a turtle named Speed (Steven Wright), a French frog named Jean-Bob (John Cleese), who claims to be a prince, and an Irish puffin named Lieutenant Puffin (Steve Vinovich). Puffin and Odette (in her swan form) fly together to find Derek. By chance, they stumble upon Derek in the woods as he is searching for the Great Animal. Derek mistakes Odette for the Great Animal (having deduced that the creature is a shapeshifter), and tries to kill her. The ensuing chase leads Derek to Swan Lake, where he witnesses Odette's change from swan to human when the moon rises. The two share a loving reunion, and Odette tells Derek that to break the spell, he must make a vow of everlasting love and \\"prove it to the world\\". Derek invites Odette to the ball at the castle the following night, hoping to declare to the world of his love for her. Derek leaves just as Rothbart arrives and doesn't know the enchanter heard the whole conversation. Rothbart tells Odette that she will never make it to the ball, for there will be \\"no moon\\" on that night. Further, Rothbart transforms his cheerful hag sidekick, Bridget, into Odette, hoping to fool Derek to make his vow to the wrong woman, which will kill the real Odette. On the night of the ball, Rothbart imprisons Odette (in swan form) in the dungeon of his castle, along with Bromley, whom he had found in the woods the other night. Bridget, in the form of human Odette, arrives at the ball where she dances with Derek, who is unaware of her true identity. At Swan Lake, Puffin, Speed, and Jean-Bob manage to free Odette from the dungeon through a duel with two hungry alligators and she flies to the castle, but is too late. Derek makes the vow to the wrong girl and Rothbart bursts in, revealing to Derek the fake's true form. Realizing his mistake, Derek races after Odette back to Swan Lake, where she finally transforms back into her human form. As Derek holds a dying Odette in his arms, she tells him she loves him before succumbing. A furious Derek confronts Rothbart, demanding he undo the spell. Rothbart transforms into the Great Animal, and a battle ensues with Rothbart overpowering Derek. Odette's animal friends return Derek's bow to him, and Bromley, who has also escaped the dungeon, provides Derek with a single arrow. Derek catches and fires the arrow into the Great Animal's heart, killing him. A heart-broken Derek confesses his love to Odette, and she revives; the spell on her is broken. Derek and Odette get married and they, along with Rogers, Uberta, King William's servants, Bromley, and the animals move into Rothbart's former castle. Meanwhile, Bridget redeems herself and falls in love with Uberta's lackey, Sir Chamberlain (James Arrington), Puffin becomes the general of an army of swans, Odette kisses Jean-Bob who goes into convulsions but does not turn into a prince, and Odette and Derek live happily ever after.  Voice cast  Production  Having previously directed The Fox and the Hound (1981) and The Black Cauldron (1985) at Walt Disney Feature Animation in Burbank, California, Richard Rich was slated to co-direct Oliver & Company (1988) until he was fired by Disney feature animation president Peter Schneider. Following his departure from Disney, he subsequently formed his own studio, Rich Animation Studios with about 26 employees, in which most of his key employees came from Disney, including the company's marketing chief, Matt Mazer. Subsequently, Jared F. Brown from Living Scriptures, Inc. tapped Rich into producing half- hour animated videos based on the audio cassettes readings of the Book of Mormon. Inspired by the success of Don Bluth's animated films as well as Disney's early-1990s animation renaissance, Rich decided to adapt the German folk tale version of Swan Lake. During production, the script went through twelve drafts over the course of two years. Rich would later attempt to sell his script to several Hollywood studios to no success. Later, Brown struck on the idea on merging Rich Animation Studios, Family Entertainment Network, and Cassette Duplicators Inc., a cassette-duplicating operation in West Valley City, Utah, into one production holding company called Nest Entertainment. The film was created by hand painting cels, a tedious technique which caused Rich and his crew to take over four years to produce the final product. Most of the cel painting was done at Hanho Heung-Up in Seoul, South Korea. Overall, 275 animators and artists worked throughout the film's production.  Music  David Zippel was approached by Richard Rich to compose songs for The Swan Princess, while the score was composed by Lex de Azevedo. The theme song \\"Far Longer than Forever\\" was written by lyricists by de Azevedo and Zippel. In the 1994 animated film, the song was performed by vocalists Liz Callaway (as the singing voice of Princess Odette) and Howard McGillin (as the speaking and singing voice of Prince Derek). In the closing credits, a pop/R&B; rendition of the song was performed by recording artists Regina Belle and Jeffrey Osborne. Michelle Nicastro sings a reprise of the song in the 1997 sequel, Escape From Castle Mountain. The New York Times wrote \\"The melody of 'Far Longer Than Forever'& ... echoes the first five notes of Beauty and the Beast.\\" Everything's Better With Bob deemed it the best song of the film due to being \\"void of all daft rhyming schemes that hit the rest of the songs in the film\\". The Animated Movie Guide noted that the song had a theme of faith. The \\"Far Longer Than Forever\\" commercial single was jointly released by Sony Wonder and Sony 550 Music. MusicHound Soundtracks: The Essential Album Guide to Film, Television and Stage Music called the \\"seemingly mandatory big ballad\\" \\"extremely annoying\\" due to \\"strik[ing] a totally different artistic note\\" in the context of the film's musical landscape. The Motion Picture Guide 1995 Annual: The Films of 1994 said the \\"love theme\\" was deserving of the Golden Globe. Star-News deemed the song \\"insistent\\", noting that audiences may \\"quickly get their fill\\" of the tune. \\"Far Longer than Forever\\" was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1995 for Best Original Song.  Release  When The Swan Princess was nearing completion, New Line Cinema purchased the distribution rights in the United States, while Sony Pictures obtained the foreign distribution rights. = Marketing = Pillsbury partnered with Turner Home Entertainment for a marketing campaign to promote the film's home video release. = Home media = Turner Home Entertainment first released The Swan Princess on VHS and LaserDisc in the Turner Family Showcase collection on August 3, 1995, and sold over 2.5 million units. Outside the United States, Columbia TriStar Home Video released it on VHS. On March 30, 2004, Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released the film for the first time on DVD. The Special Edition DVD contains a few extras, including trailers, a read-along feature, a sing-along feature, and games. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment later re-released the DVD on August 18, 2009. It was also released as a double-feature DVD with its sequel The Swan Princess 3: The Mystery of the Enchanted Kingdom. A Blu-ray version of the film was released on October 29, 2019, along with a digital exclusive in 4K UHD HDR, for its 25th anniversary.  Reception = Critical response = The Swan Princess received favorable reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying \\"Despite the comparatively limited resources at his disposal, Richard Rich shows that he understands the recent Disney animated renaissance and can create some of the same magic. The movie isn't in the same league as Disney's big four, and it doesn't have the same crossover appeal to adults, but as family entertainment, it's bright and cheerful, and it has its moments.\\" Similarly, Hal Hinson of The Washington Post said it was a better film than The Lion King, praising its \\"fluid, unhurried pace\\" and \\"lush, original sense of color\\", though deeming the score \\"[not] terribly distinctive\\". Brian Lowry of Variety said the film was \\"technically impressive but rather flat and languid storywise\\". James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film 2.5 stars of 4 writing that \\"much of The Swan Princess is trite and uninspired\\", though added \\"nevertheless, despite its problems, The Swan Princess is actually one of the better non-Disney animated productions to come along in a while\\". Gene Siskel of The Chicago Tribune gave the film two out of four stars writing the film is a \\"casually drawn tale of a boring prince and princess tormented by a dull sorcerer. The songs are weak, and no relationship is developed between the principals.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, The Swan Princess has an approval rating of 50%, based on 12 reviews, with an average score of 5.4/10. = Box office = The Swan Princess received a theatrical release in the United States on November 18, 1994, and only made $2.4 million on its opening weekend. It eventually had a total domestic gross of $9.8 million against a $21 million budget, becoming a box office bomb, mostly due to struggling competition with several other family films and a re-release of The Lion King. Disney's reissuing of The Lion King just as this film was being released was seen as \\"sabotage\\" by Variety.

Scott, Michael Sarrazin, and Sue Lyon, based on the 1965 novel The Ballad of the Flim-Flam Man by Guy Owen. The movie has well-known character actors in supporting roles, including Jack Albertson, Slim Pickens, Strother Martin, Harry Morgan, and Albert Salmi. The movie is set in the countryside and small towns of the American South, and it was filmed in the Anderson County, Kentucky, area. It is also noted for its folksy musical score by composer Jerry Goldsmith. The movie's title song \\"Flim Flam Man,\\" written by Laura Nyro, later became a hit for Barbra Streisand. Plot summary Mordecai C. Jones (Scott)a self-styled \\"M.B.S., C.S., D.D. Master of Back-Stabbing, Cork- Screwing and Dirty-Dealing!\\"is a drifting confidence trickster who makes his living defrauding people in the Southern United States using tricks such as rigged punchboards, playing cards, and found wallets. He befriends a young man named Curley (Sarrazin), a deserter from the United States Army, and the two form a team to make money. In their escapades, they wreck a town during a hair-raising chase in their stolen car, steal a truck loaded with moonshine whiskey that they sell, break out of a sheriff's office, and discover a riverboat brothel. In the ending scene, Mordecai explains how he sees himself. Cast *George C. Scott as Mordecai Jones *Michael Sarrazin as Curley *Sue Lyon as Bonnie Lee Packard *Harry Morgan as Sheriff Zebulon \\"Zeb\\" Slade *Jack Albertson as Mr Packard *Alice Ghostley as Mrs Packard *Albert Salmi as Deputy Meshaw *Slim Pickens as Jarvis Bates *Strother Martin as Lovick *George Mitchell as Tetter *Woodrow Parfrey as Supermarket Manager Production The movie was filmed on location for the most part in Central Kentucky during the second half of 1966. Exterior filming was done in a number of locations including near Frankfort, Midway, Winchester, Irvine, outside Georgetown, and several other places. Filming involving trains was done in conjunction with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and for a smaller part the Southern Railway System. Some interior filming (the inside of the Packard home and campsite sequences) was done on a sound stage specially built in Lexington, Kentucky at the Vaughn Tobacco Company warehouses. Filming locations included: * Paynes Depot, Kentucky: The opening sequence in which Curley meets Mordecai after getting thrown off a freight train was filmed here. The small railroad yard is now gone, but the roadside store seen in the background just before the title card still remains, as well as the base of the tank car station seen briefly in the film. A rented train from the Louisville and Nashville Railroad was used, headed by Alco RS-3 #136. * Old Crow Distillery, Frankfort, Kentucky: The location of Curley's hideout in the overturned L&N; caboose was filmed just north of the Old Crow Distillery on Glenns Creek Road. The concrete \\"railroad bridge\\" in this scene was actually an access road on the distillery grounds and had fake tracks laid across it that ended just out of frame. The caboose was placed in the creek by a local crane company, which would later move it to the banks of the nearby Kentucky River after filming. It washed away in a flood some time during the 1970s. but the concrete bridge remains. Other portions of the film shot here were those depicting the moonshine still and the sequence in which the green flatbed truck is stolen by Mordecai. * Glenns Creek Road, Frankfort: The scene that introduces Sheriff Slade and Deputy Meshaw (in which Curley and Mordecai dive off the road) was filmed here about 1/2 mile north of the Old Crow distillery. The large tree in front of which Curley and Mordecai talk still stands as of 2014, although it is dead. * Main Street, Midway, Kentucky: The establishing scene of the small town in which the Three-card Monte scam occurred was shot here. A railroad line runs directly through the center of town. The passenger train in the scene was the Chesapeake and Ohio's George Washington, which operated between Lexington and Louisville over the L&N; Railroad via trackage rights. * Old Frankfort Pike, Lexington, Kentucky: The Packard farm is located here. As of 2014, the house exterior is mostly unchanged, with some minor remodeling. No interior filming was made at this location as the interior of the house was a sound stage. * Duckers, Kentucky: The country store where Sheriff Slade and Deputy Meshaw first see the red convertible \\"borrowed\\" by Mordecai is located here. The store still stands but is now a private residence with the \\"porch\\" on which the sheriff sat now enclosed. * Clifton Road, Versailles, Kentucky: This is the place where Curley first notices that the police are following the convertible. The wooden house by which the police car passes no longer exists. * Court Street, Lawrenceburg, Kentucky: The scene in which the convertible narrowly misses a Southern Railway locomotive and boxcar at a grade crossing was filmed here. The crossing still exists and is now Norfolk Southern territory. * Main Street, Lawrenceburg: The sequence during the car chase in which the convertible destroys a town was filmed here, and two alleys split off either side of it. Most of the structures in this sequence remain as of 2014, including the tobacco warehouse where the convertible detoured through the loading dock. The alley where the convertible ran through Christmas merchandise also still exists, but the brick building has been demolished and replaced by a modern bank. The scam in which Mordecai and Curley sell bourbon- cut moonshine to a storekeeper was also filmed in Lawrenceburg, directly behind the former offices of the Anderson County Observer newspaper. The back of this building is no longer accessible because of remodeling. * Main Street, Irvine, Kentucky: The near ending of the car chase in which the convertible and sheriff's car run around an A&P; grocery store and across a green highway bridge was filmed here. * Corner of Lemons Mill and Newtown Pike, Georgetown, Kentucky: The country store where the \\"peg game\\" scam took place was filmed here. The bridge where Curley is first dropped off at the beginning of the scene was removed in a road realignment during 2001. As of 2014, the buildings remain, but in a state of disrepair. * Valley View Ferry, Tates Creek Road, Valley View, Kentucky: The ferry operates on Tates Creek Road on the Madison County and Fayette County borders. The ferry still operates as of 2014, although the barge and power unit have been replaced several times since the making of the film. The large steel towers seen in the background (part of an abandoned railroad bridge) can still be seen. * Main Street, Winchester, Kentucky: The \\"pigeon drop\\" sequence with Slim Pickens was filmed here. The building that Slim Pickens first exits was the St. George Hotel and was located at the corner of Washington Street and Main. This has since been demolished, and the whole block is now occupied by the Winchester Post Office. The scene in the alley where the pigeon drop scam occurred was behind the Sphar Feed Company building on North Main Street. Today, the building is owned by the City of Winchester and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Plans call for rehabilitating the warehouse and repurposing it to serve as Winchester‚Äôs welcome center and professional office space. * Anderson County Courthouse, Lawrenceburg: The film's last act was filmed inside and outside the courthouse. The exterior of the building is mostly unchanged as of 2014, but the interior setup has been remodeled somewhat. The sheriff's office on the front ground floor no longer exists. * Railroad filming (the truck on rails sequence) was done on several rail lines including the Louisville and Nashville \\"Old Road\\" line between Lexington and Frankfort, and possibly the Frankfort and Cincinnati Railroad. The scene in which the truck almost collides with an L&N; freight train was filmed on the L&N; Hermitage Branch, which served the Old Crow Distillery outside Frankfort. * The final scene with Mordecai riding a bicycle to a railroad crossing and disappearing after the passage of a local freight utilizing a Union Pacific locomotive (GP-9 173) and caboose thinly disguised with L&N; markings was most certainly filmed in the Los Angeles area on a UP spur line after Kentucky filming had finished. Awards William Rose was nominated for the Best American Comedy Writing award given by the Writers Guild of America. Reception Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said: \\"The movie was shot on location, largely in Kentucky, and it gains a real feeling of authenticity. These are real crossroads stores and real wide-eyed rednecks, watching the city slicker shuffle the cards. And a lot of the episodes are hilarious. I announced some time ago, in connection with Casino Royale (1967) I think, that chase scenes had just about had it as laugh-getters in the movies. Wrong again. There is a chase scene in this one that's a classic. The flim-flam man, dressed as a minister, and his pupil, dressed as an accident victim, steal a car and lead the sheriff on a brilliantly photographed chase down the sidewalks and through the watermelon wagons of the South. ... There are also some nicely directed scenes in which Scott gradually overcomes the suspicions of his victims, wins their confidence, allows his straight man to win a few bucks and then, oh, so innocently asks a tobacco farmer if he'd care to speculate as to which card was the queen.\\" =Box office= According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $6,400,000 in rentals to break even and made $3,525,000, meaning it incurred a loss.

He was the Archbishop of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh from 1985 to 2013. O'Brien was the leader of the Catholic Church in ScotlandCardinal O'Brien, the church's leader in Scotland, The Daily Telegraph, 18 April 2008He was the leader of Scotland‚Äôs 800,000 or so Catholics , Interview ‚Äì Cardinal Keith O'Brien, Holyrood Magazine, 8 June 2007. and had been the head of its conference of bishops until he stepped down as archbishop in February 2013. O'Brien's resignation followed publication of allegations that he had engaged in inappropriate and predatory sexual conduct with priests and seminarians under his jurisdiction and abused his power. O'Brien was opposed to homosexuality, which he described as \\"moral degradation\\", and a vehement opponent of same-sex marriage. On 20 March 2015, the Vatican announced that though he remained a member of the College of Cardinals, O'Brien would not exercise his rights or duties as a cardinal, in particular voting in papal conclaves (he had already stayed out of the 2013 conclave). O'Brien died after a fall on 19 March 2018, two days after his 80th birthday. Early life and education O‚ÄôBrien was born at Ballycastle, in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, on 17 March 1938. After primary education in Ballycastle, his family moved to Scotland where his father was serving with the Royal Navy at Faslane. O'Brien initially attended St Stephen's Primary School, Dalmuir before continuing to secondary school at St Patrick's High School, Dumbarton. His family then moved to Edinburgh, where he completed his secondary education at Holy Cross Academy. O'Brien studied at the University of Edinburgh where he gained a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry in 1959 (and a Diploma in Education in 1966). His studies for the priesthood were at St Andrew's College, Drygrange, Roxburghshire, and he was ordained priest on 3 April 1965 by his predecessor, Cardinal Gordon Gray. Initially serving as curate at Holy Cross, Edinburgh from 1965 until 1966, he completed his teacher training certificate at Moray House College of Education. From 1966 to 1971, he was employed by Fife County Council as a teacher of mathematics and science; he also served as chaplain to St Columba's Secondary School, initially in Cowdenbeath and then in Dunfermline, while assisting at St Bride's Parish, Cowdenbeath. O'Brien was then moved to full-time parish apostolate in St Patrick's, Kilsyth from 1972 until 1975 and then St Mary's, Bathgate from 1975 until 1978. He served as spiritual director to the students at St Andrew's College, Drygrange from 1978 until 1980; then as Rector of St Mary's College, Blairs, the junior seminary near Aberdeen, from 1980 until 1985. Archbishop and cardinal O‚ÄôBrien was nominated Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh on 30 May 1985 and was consecrated by Cardinal Gray, then Archbishop Emeritus of St Andrews and Edinburgh, at St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh on 5 August 1985. Pope John Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of Ss Joachim and Anne ad Tusculanum on 21 October 2003. O'Brien was made Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 2005, appointed Grand Prior of the Scottish Lieutenancy of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem in 2001 and appointed Knight Grand Cross (KGCHS) of that order in 2003. In 2004 O'Brien was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from St Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada, an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of St Andrews, and an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of Edinburgh. In 2015 there were calls for the honorary degree from St Andrews to be revoked due to admission of sexual impropriety. Professor Manfredi La Manna wrote, \\"I, for one, would not recognise as a colleague someone who admitted abusing his position of power for sexual gratification with subordinates.\\" The University decided against this, noting, \\"(...) that revocation cannot change or ameliorate the wrongs of the past and that, notwithstanding the very real hurt and loss caused by the actions of the honorand, it would be no more than an empty gesture.\\" O'Brien was Apostolic Administrator of the Diocese of Argyll and the Isles from 1996 until 1999, when Bishop Ian Murray took over the diocese. O'Brien took part in the 2005 Papal Conclave which elected Pope Benedict XVI. In anticipation of the 2010 visit of Pope Benedict to England and Scotland, O'Brien and Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, said that the crisis involving Se√°n Brady, Archbishop of Armagh, over the priest Brendan Smyth and other clerical abuse charges was one for the Irish Catholic Church and should not overshadow Benedict's visit. O'Brien and Nichols were asked whether the pope would respond to charges made against the church about clerical sex abuse during his four-day visit, the first papal visit to the UK since John Paul II in 1982. O'Brien said he did not know; Nichols said English, Welsh and Scottish bishops had \\"robust\\" rules in place to protect children. Campaigners for victims of abuse wanted an investigation of the way O'Brien dealt with all allegations of abuse while he was leader due to O'Brien's sexual misconduct admission. Mario Conti, Archbishop emeritus of Glasgow, said all the Scottish Catholic bishops except O'Brien cooperated over an independent inquiry into the handling of child abuse in Scotland between 1952 and 2012 with the results to be published. The inquiry was delayed because O'Brien and only O'Brien withdrew cooperation. When O'Brien announced on 25 February 2013 that Pope Benedict had accepted his resignation as archbishop, he said he would not exercise his right to participate in the conclave in March to elect Benedict's successor. On 20 March 2015, Pope Francis accepted O'Brien's renunciation of all duties as cardinal, an event extremely rare in Church history. Though he remained a cardinal until his death in 2018, he no longer participated in any public, religious or civil events. =Curial appointments= After his creation as cardinal, O'Brien was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications and also a member of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People. He was President of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland and fulfilled various engagements at the request of other members of the Conference. He was sometimes referred to as the \\"Primate of Scotland\\";\\"In his speech on his ten-minute Bill, he mentioned that Cardinal O'Brien, the Primate of Scotland, had made a public statement...\\", Evan Harris MP, Oxford West & Abingdon, Liberal Democrat, 27 March 2009 however this title or position has never existed. \\"Serve the Lord with Gladness\\" =Resignation as archbishop= O'Brien tendered his resignation from the governance of the Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh to the Pope some time in 2012, in view of his 75th birthday in March 2013; the Pope accepted it nunc pro tunc on 13 November 2012 and decided it would become effective on 25 February 2013. He remained a cardinal. The announcement of his resignation followed allegations initially in The Observer newspaper that O'Brien had engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct with junior clergy. The Pope appointed Philip Tartaglia as temporary apostolic administrator in O'Brien's place. In July, Leo Cushley, a priest from Motherwell, was named to succeed O'Brien as archbishop. Sexual misconduct and consequences In 2013 allegations became public that O'Brien had engaged in inappropriate, sometimes predatory sexual activity from the 1980s to 2003. =Accusations and admission= Reporters outside St Bennets, O'Brien's Edinburgh residence, on the day he resigned On 23 February 2013 The Observer reported that O'Brien had been accused of inappropriate sexual behaviour involving four men (three serving priests, and one former priest) within the Diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh dating back to the 1980s. The former priest resigned the priesthood when O'Brien became a bishop and stated, \\"I knew then he would always have power over me. (‚Ä¶) I left to preserve my integrity.\\" It was reported that one complainant needed long term counselling due to the actions of O'Brien. One of the four, referred to only as \\"Priest C\\", alleges that the degree of control a superior has over subordinate priests made it hard for him to refuse O'Brien's demands. \\"He [the bishop above a priest] has immense power over you. He can move you, freeze you out, bring you into the fold ... he controls every aspect of your life.\\" The complaint demanding O'Brien's immediate resignation was lodged with the Vatican's ambassador to the United Kingdom and there were efforts to silence at least one critic. O'Brien initially contested the allegations. According to the BBC, a source within the church said that O'Brien \\"doesn't know who his accusers are and doesn't know what they're accusing him of\\". On 24 February 2013 he did not attend a special service to celebrate the eight-year tenure of Pope Benedict XVI at St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh. It was widely reported that he had asked for legal advice and been advised not to attend. On 25 February 2013 it was announced that O'Brien's previously submitted resignation as archbishop would take effect that same day, and a temporary apostolic administrator was appointed in his place. O'Brien said that he would not participate in the oncoming conclave, although entitled to do so. O'Brien then made no further public appearance until early May 2013. On 3 March 2013, the Scottish Catholic Media Office released a statement from O'Brien in which he said, \\"I ... admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal.\\"Cardinal Keith O'Brien admits and apologises for sexual misconduct The Guardian, 3 March 2013. He said he intended to retire permanently from the public life of the church. Archbishop Philip Tartaglia, temporary successor to O'Brien, said the \\"credibility and moral authority\\" of the church had been damaged. Later in March 2013 a former priest announced his intention to sue O'Brien, saying O'Brien had groped and kissed him as a 19-year-old seminarian in the 1980s. O'Brien was further accused of trying to grope a priest in 2003 in Rome at a drinks party to celebrate his becoming a cardinal. It was also alleged that O'Brien had been in a long-term physical relationship with one of the complainants. O'Brien faced allegations of a \\"culture of cronyism\\" within his archdiocese and that this made him less likely to challenge priests to whom he had made advances. In 2015 The Glasgow Herald reported allegations that in at least 40 cases young clerics were encouraged to let O'Brien hear their confessions, and the religious act was used for sexual grooming. There was allegedly reluctance to accept O'Brien's actions as a sexual predator. Victims of O'Brien's sexual abuse felt unable to complain because within the church only a pope has ever been able to discipline a cardinal. After publication of the McLellan Report in 2015 Andrew McLellan said the church's treatment of O'Brien showed that secrecy is still an \\"important part of the atmosphere\\" within the church. =Ecclesiastical response= On 27 April 2013 The Scotsman reported that Cardinal Marc Ouellet would head an investigation into O'Brien, and that appointment of Scottish bishops had been halted until the inquiry was completed. This contradicted another report suggesting that the Vatican would not hold a formal investigation or publish any formal report because \\"The Church doesn't work that way.\\" No decision had been made to demote or laicise O'Brien. O'Brien returned to Scotland and attempted to settle into the church- owned cottage he had planned as his retirement home in Dunbar, East Lothian. One of his accusers, a former seminarian, stated, \\"Keith O'Brien is giving the impression he wants a nice peaceful little retirement now. My experience hasn't left me for decades and as far as I'm concerned this brings things very much back into focus. I have an issue with Keith O'Brien and it needs to be dealt with.\\" There were fears the cardinal's visibility would harm the church further. On 15 March 2013, it was confirmed that the Vatican had ordered O'Brien to leave Scotland, and he left for months of \\"prayer and penance\\". According to The Washington Post, \\"The statement didn't specify that the decision was imposed on O'Brien by the Vatican as punishment, and in fact went out of its way to suggest that the decision was O'Brien's. But in the past, wayward priests have been sanctioned by the Vatican with punishments of 'prayer and penance', and the statement made clear Francis supported the move and that the Holy See would decide his future fate.\\" The Vatican stated on 15 May 2013 that O'Brien \\"will be leaving Scotland for several months for the purpose of spiritual renewal, prayer and penance\\" and \\"Any decision regarding future arrangements for His Eminence [Cardinal Keith O'Brien] shall be agreed with the Holy See.\\" Supporters of O'Brien objected to the church requiring O'Brien to leave Scotland; Canon John Creanor threatened legal action to prevent O'Brien's \\"forced exile\\", and said he had a legal team ready. Richard Holloway, former Bishop of Edinburgh in the Scottish Episcopal Church, said that forcing O'Brien into exile from Scotland would breach international law. Holloway likened O'Brien's forced exile to the tactics of \\"extraordinary rendition\\" (extrajudicial transfer) of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The four complainants said that O'Brien needed psychological counselling rather than prayer and penance. One accusing priest said, \\"Keith is extremely manipulative and needs help to be challenged out of his denial. If he does not receive treatment, I believe he is still a danger to himself and to others.\\" The four accusers believed there was a smokescreen, with the full story untold, and wanted an investigation to reveal the extent of O'Brien's actions. Throughout the scandal, the Catholic Church in Scotland failed to act. O'Brien was still Britain's most senior Catholic. According to Peter Kearney, the director of communications of the Catholic media office (which was largely unavailable for official comment), only Rome could handle the O'Brien affair; nobody in Scotland had authority to challenge a cardinal. According to Catherine Deveney writing in The Observer, Archbishop Tartaglia, who was temporary leader of St Andrews and Edinburgh following O'Brien's resignation, failed to confront the issue, and behind the scenes \\"church insiders\\" were critical; one told her that \\"He is completely lacking in leadership qualities\\". Kearney told the Observer there could be no Scottish investigation because the nuncio had rightly not identified the complainants. But he had; Kearney apparently didn't know that Joseph Toal, bishop of Argyll and the Isles, had been given names and asked to be a contact point. Deveney said that this issue was no longer about personal failure, but systemic failure, and reported that theologian Werner Jeanrond said \\"As a church, we have failed to come to terms with homosexuality. The highest clerical representative of the church is himself a victim of the system which didn't allow him to own his homosexuality.\\" She added that there are many other scandals involving Scottish clergy, including at least one bishop; misdeeds include sexual misconduct, heavy drinking, payoffs to cover scandals and serious abuse; and she said that \\"O'Brien knows where the bodies lie. And the hierarchy knows he knows.\\" She said that this issue is not about Scottish clergy, but is worldwide. In July 2013 O'Brien was reported to be in a monastery in Europe or an enclosed abbey in the English Midlands. In November 2013 there was a report that O'Brien would face no further punishment, which disappointed alleged victims and victims' groups. Apostolic visitation After some delay, it was reported in The Observer on 23 June 2013 that the Vatican had decided to hold an apostolic visitation. This is a formal high- level inspection into the affair, in which the \\"visitator\\" is given authority directly by the pope. In this case the visitator was the archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, who had not yet been appointed at the time. Papal nuncio Antonio Mennini told one of the complainants, a former priest known as \\"Lenny\\", of the decision. Anyone affected would be able to give evidence; if there was considered to be sufficient evidence, a deeper process would take place in Rome. Lenny was relieved that the facts would finally be examined, but said that the visitation also had to examine \\"whether any promotions were awarded to the cardinal's cronies\\". According to the article, senior figures in Rome said the visitation would also deal with the more general accusations of moral failings in the church in Scotland. There was criticism of the choice of O'Brien's successor as Archbishop of Edinburgh as visitator; Tom Doyle, a canon lawyer who had worked at the nunciature in Washington and later represented Catholic abuse victims all over the world, said that the whole point was for someone from outside to investigate, and that the choice of O'Brien's successor would make the church \\"look like fools\\". Doyle said that dealing with a previous case, which related to widespread child abuse in Ireland, by an apostolic visitation had been a \\"total farce\\", and that only totally independent investigations have elicited significant truth in similar cases, as with (non-ecclesiastical) grand juries in the United States and government statutory commissions in Ireland. The complainants have been negotiating with Archbishop Leo Cushley but have also appealed to Pope Francis. They would like an investigation into the way the diocese was governed, the manner of O'Brien's appointment, whether close associates were appointed to positions of power and also the extent of O'Brien's predatory behaviour. Cushley promised to hand over the requests personally but discouraged public discussion of the case. During O'Brien's lifetime a Canonical trial remained possible but unlikely. \\"Lenny\\" claims the finances of the Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh under O'Brien are being investigated internally to find if there were irregularities. If this were not done he would have involved the charity regulator. He says O'Brien bought a jet ski for a friend and the source of the money is unclear. The church has neither confirmed nor denied this. O'Brien had since January 2014 been living, initially incognito, in a home provided by the Catholic Church in the village of Ellington, Northumberland, fifty miles south of the Scottish border. O'Brien later moved to Newcastle.Cardinal Keith O'Brien, disgraced Catholic church leader, dies The Guardian Charles Scicluna investigated O'Brien in April 2014 and such an investigation of a cardinal appears unprecedented. There are concerns that the report, allegedly \\"hot enough to burn the varnish\\" from the Pope's desk, remains unpublished. Following Scicluna's apostolic visitation, the Holy See announced on 20 March 2015 that Pope Francis had \\"accept[ed] the resignation of Cardinal Keith Patrick O'Brien from the rights and duties of a Cardinal\\". A statement for the Catholic Church in Scotland confirmed that O'Brien would continue to live outside Scotland until such time as his age and infirmity required that situation to be reviewed. He retained the title of Cardinal, but did not any longer carry out the functions of a cardinal and was only allowed to wear a cardinal's robes in private. According to the Holy See Press Office O'Brien would not take part in papal elections, act as papal adviser, or take part in Vatican congregations and councils, and would lose other roles of a cardinal. Journalist David Gibson wrote that \\"Those developments, [Scicluna's unpublished report, the home bought for O'Brien, that O'Brien was not officially punished] plus the fact that O'Brien can keep the title of cardinal ... may also keep the issue on the boil rather than cooling it off.\\" The ecclesiastical historian Christopher Bellitto said, \\"What's odd, in this papacy especially, is that O'Brien loses the power, but not the pomp, ... a red hat is still a red hat, even if there is no punch behind it.\\"A similar situation also occurred when the late former Cardinal of the Archdiocese of Vienna, in Vienna, Austria, Hans Hermann Gro√´r, who was found to have abused many, was asked by Pope John Paul II to relinquish his duties as archbishop and cardinal; he denied the allegations until his death. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests is concerned that the transparency Pope Francis promised is absent and the cardinal's wrong or abusive actions have been kept secret. There is further concern that other clerics failed to disclose abuse by O'Brien which they reasonably should have known or suspected. Abusive bishops have resigned in the past, but action against complicit clerics and bishops who conceal abuse would be a helpful innovation because it would help prevent further abuse and concealment. Health and death O'Brien said, while criticising a parliamentary bill on embryology in 2008, that he carried an organ donor card. O'Brien suffered from heart problems and was fitted with a pacemaker after complaining of dizzy spells and fainting prior to Passion Sunday Mass in March 2008. When he announced that he would not attend the 2013 conclave he said \\"Approaching the age of 75 and at times in indifferent health, I tendered my resignation as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh to Pope Benedict XVI some months ago.\\" O'Brien died after a fall on 19 March 2018, two days after his 80th birthday. Views O'Brien was often forthright in his political and spiritual views. In 1999, at the European Synod of Bishops, O'Brien declared who he saw fit to be the next Archbishop of Westminster, following the death of Cardinal Basil Hume. He named his candidate, Timothy Radcliffe, Master General of the Dominican order (Black Friars). At the synod, Radcliffe had made an appeal to O'Brien, saying that there was a crisis of authority in the church, but the answer could not be more emphasis on authority. In the presence of the Pope, Radcliffe went on: the church should not only speak about the poor, the divorced people, women who had had abortions, homosexuals, but should also take at heart their experiences, eat their bread, take what they had to offer. \\"They'll blame us being associated with the wrong people but we have a good precedent.\\" =Secularism= In 2011 he criticised \\"aggressive secularism\\", denouncing what he said was the way Christians had been prevented from acting in accordance with their beliefs. O'Brien said aggressive secularism threatened the Christian heritage and he wanted religion to remain in the public sphere. Specifically, legislation requiring Christians to tolerate homosexuality was a type of secularism O'Brien opposed, and he called on Christians of all denominations to unite in combating secularism. > Referring to equality legislation which prevents discrimination against > homosexuals, he [O'Brien] said Christians faced being sidelined in British > society because they were not willing to publicly endorse lifestyles that > run contrary to their belief system. > His [O'Brien's Easter 2011] homily included instances where Christians had > fallen foul of equality legislation, preventing discrimination against gay > people, and swiftly drew fire from groups campaigning against religious > privilege in public life. Evan Harris of the National Secular Society and the British Humanist Association called O'Brien's statements \\"paranoid and unjustified\\". =Homosexuality= Before becoming a cardinal, O'Brien had been regarded as \\"liberal\\" on the issue of homosexuality, saying that there were a significant number of homosexual priests ministering within the Catholic Church.The Telegraph, October 2003 However, in December 2004 he told members of the Scottish Parliament that homosexuals were \\"captives of sexual aberrations\\", comparing homosexuals to prisoners in Saughton jail; and later referred to homosexuality as a \\"moral degradation\\". But in 2005 O'Brien did rebuke Bishop Joseph Devine, who had suggested that homosexuals should not be allowed to teach in Catholic schools, commenting, \\"I don't have a problem with the personal life of a person as long as they are not flaunting their sexuality.\\"The Scotsman, 28 March 2005 In January 2006 he criticised Westminster MPs over the introduction of civil partnerships in the UK, and Holyrood members over the liberalisation of divorce laws in Scotland.Cardinal in family life broadside, BBC, 1 January 2006 In July 2006 he opposed proposals to change the law which would require Catholic adoption agencies to place children with homosexuals in the same way as with heterosexuals, calling them totalitarian.Sunday Times, 24 July 2006 In December 2011, O'Brien reiterated the Catholic Church's continued opposition to civil partnerships and suggested that there should be no laws that \\"facilitate\\" same-sex relationships, saying that In 2012, O'Brien criticised in The Daily Telegraph government proposals to introduce same-sex marriage, saying it was \\"madness\\", and would \\"redefine society since the institution of marriage is one of the fundamental building blocks of society\\", and thus shame the United Kingdom. Conservative MP Margot James, who was considered one of the most influential gay women in 2009,\\"Gay Power: The Pink List 2009\\" The Independent, 2 July 2009. called these comments \\"scaremongering\\" and said: \\"I think it is a completely unacceptable way for a prelate to talk. I think that the government is not trying to force Catholic churches to perform gay marriages at all. It is a purely civil matter.\\" The Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Harriet Harman, said: \\"We have had prejudice, discrimination and homophobia for hundreds of years. That doesn't make it right [...] I don't want anybody to feel that this is a licence for whipping up prejudice.\\" Dan Hodges wrote: \\"I can't remember the last time I read a more morally and intellectually bankrupt rant from a senior member of the clergy.\\" The LGBT rights campaigners Stonewall awarded O'Brien \\"Bigot of the Year\\" at their annual awards in 2012.Tom Peck, \\"Britain's most senior Catholic is named 'Bigot of the Year'\\", The Independent, 2 November 2012 The award was criticised by First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond, as being \\"clearly wrong\\" and \\"not conducive to a proper and dignified debate on the important issue of equality in Scotland\\". =Clerical celibacy= On 22 February 2013, in an interview with the BBC, O'Brien said he was open to the possibility of removing the requirement of celibacy in the priesthood. =Abortion and embryo research= In May 2007 O'Brien urged Roman Catholics to reject political candidates who support what he called the \\"social evil\\" of abortion, and said that such Catholic politicians should not expect to remain full members of the church.Cardinal sounds abortion warning, BBC, 31 May 2007 During March 2008, O'Brien highlighted the issue of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill being debated in Parliament, denouncing the government for a \\"monstrous attack on human rights\\" through its \\"evil\\" endorsement of \\"Frankenstein\\" experiments. Some scientists suggested that he intentionally used inflammatory language to stir up opposition to the bill; others argued he was sticking up for morals and forced the Government to allow MPs to vote freely on the issue. (Gordon Brown had originally imposed a three-line whip on Labour MPs, meaning they had to back the bill, regardless of personal convictions.) O'Brien himself narrated a five-minute video recording in which he stated the \\"many, many concerns\\" of the Catholic Church concerning the bill which was to be voted on in Parliament. It was posted on YouTube, and sent as a DVD to every member of Parliament. In the video O'Brien made clear he was not against medical research, and supported research with non-embryonic stem cells, but was opposed to using embryos which would later be destroyed. He expressed the church's concerns over \\"human-animal hybrids\\". =British politics= In February 2010, the Secretary of State for Scotland, Jim Murphy, said in the House of Commons that faith was \\"at the very foundations of the Labour Party\\" and encouraged openness to religion in public life. O'Brien responded that he \\"welcomed the sentiment\\" but said that \\"a tangible example by the Government over the last decade that it acknowledged or endorsed religious values would also have been welcomed. Instead we have witnessed this Government undertake a systematic and unrelenting attack on family values.\\" O'Brien said to the Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, Iain Gray, \\"I hope he [Pope Benedict XVI] gives you hell [during his September 2010 visit] for what has happened over the past 10 years.\\" In March 2011, O'Brien called British foreign policy \\"anti-Christian\\" for greatly increasing aid to Pakistan without requiring any commitment from the Pakistani government to religious freedom for Christians and other religious minority groups. He made this statement in the wake of the assassination of Pakistani minister Shahbaz Bhatti, who had spoken out against the country's blasphemy law. British monarchy O'Brien called for a 310-year-old law banning Catholics from taking the throne to be repealed. He said the Act of Settlement of 1701 was hampering efforts to curb sectarianism. Former Prime Minister David Cameron said that \\"in principle\\" he supported reforming the law on royal succession to remove the ban on Catholics, and people married to Catholics, from ascending the throne. Scottish independence In an interview with the University of St Andrews philosopher John Haldane, published in the Catholic Herald in October 2006, O'Brien stated that he would be \\"happy\\" if Scots voted for independence and predicted that independence is coming \\"before too long\\". He drew parallels with the independence of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland: \\"it is difficult to argue that ecclesiastical independence is acceptable but political independence is not\\".Catholic leader backs Scottish independence, Scotland on Sunday, 15 October 2006 Poverty In 2011, Keith O'Brien preached a homily including the quote below.

The bell was cast in a mould by the bell-founder Franciscus Illenfeld of Olomouc in 1557. Its weight is 7 tonnes.http://travel.spectator.sme.sk/articles/1546/kosice_second_city_second_to_none In 1775 the pyramidal roof was constructed with annion in the Baroque style with an iron double cross.

There are 36 old gravestones (coming from the 14th and 15th centuries, one of these comes from the Roman Empire and dates back to the 4th century) bricked into the exterior walls of the St. Urban Tower. In 1966 the tower was damaged by fire and the St. Urban Bell was destroyed as well. The reconstructed tower was reopened in 1971. The renovated bell was located in the front of the tower and a copy of the bell (made by employees of VS≈Ω Steel Works Ko≈°ice in 1996) was installed in the campanile.

It gets its name from the ancient church that was located near to where the current Church of Ireland is located on Church Street looking over the town. It is near the River Bann, which marks the boundary between County Londonderry and County Antrim. In the 2011 Census it had a population of 2,724 people. It is situated within Causeway Coast and Glens district.  History  There is a tradition that St Patrick visited the area during the fifth century, a story repeated recently in the book 'The Fairy Thorn' produced by Kilrea local historians. During the Plantation of Ulster Kilrea and the surrounding townlands were granted to the Worshipful Company of Mercers by King James I for settlement. Their headquarters in Ulster were at nearby Movanagher on the banks of the River Bann. Today Kilrea is a market town and commercial centre of the surrounding district. The village is centred on 'The Diamond' which includes the town's War Memorial erected in honour of Kilrea men killed in the Great War. The village is featured in the Orange song, Sprigs of Kilrea. It is also mentioned in the song Kitty the rose of Kilrea by The Irish Rover band. = The Troubles = A total of seven people died in violence relating to the Troubles. Five were killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and two by the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF). All the IRA's victims were current or former members of the security forces, with two belonging to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, one a current and one a former member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, and one belonging to the British Territorial Army. All were Protestants and three of the five were off duty when they were killed. According to the Sutton Index of Deaths, both men killed by the UFF were former members of the IRA. At the time of their deaths both were associated with Sinn F√©in. Both were Catholic. Of the seven killed in the Kilrea Troubles, all were killed in separate incidents and all were shot except one of the RUC officers, who was killed by a booby trap bomb while on patrol. While deaths in many other areas were concentrated in the early 1970s, in Kilrea they were spread between 1976 and 1992. = Festival of the Fairy Thorn = A feature of Kilrea is its 'Fairy Thorn' tree, which stands just outside the front wall of First Kilrea Presbyterian Church.

It functions as a network to promote and coordinate pro-life activism, especially among Roman Catholic priests and laymen, with the primary strategic goal of ending abortion and euthanasia and to spread the message of the Evangelium vitae encyclical, written by Pope John Paul II. On April 30, 1991, Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco officially approved Priests for Life as a Private Association of the Faithful, a term drawn from the Code of Canon Law. The organization was later listed in the Official Catholic Directory. Priests for Life have formed an international association of Catholics called \\"Gospel of Life\\", and has requested the Holy See to grant appropriate status and structure in the Church. Bishop Patrick Zurek of the Diocese of Amarillo has said that Priests for Life is a civil institution, not a Catholic organization. Finances Frank Pavone On September 6, 2011, Bishop Patrick Zurek of the Diocese of Amarillo, Texas, limited Father Pavone to duties within the Diocese of Amarillo because of a protracted disagreement over financial transparency for Pavone's nonprofit Priests for Life and its affiliates ‚Äì Rachel's Vineyard, which counsels people affected by abortion, and Gospel of Life Ministries, a lay association for Priests for Life. Pavone remained a priest in good standing, and the bishop did not allege fiscal impropriety, Gospel of Life Ministries lost its tax-exempt status for failure to file required documentation, according to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) records. A Catholic World News analysis of tax returns indicated that between 2006 and 2008, Priests for Life spent less than 63% of its revenues on its programs. It also found that Pavone did not draw any salary from the organization. Charity Navigator awarded Priests for Life one star out of four for financial accountability and transparency. The Better Business Bureau Charity Review lists PFL as \\"Did Not Disclose\\" indicating that the \\"organization either has not responded to written BBB requests for information or has declined to be evaluated in relation to BBB Standards for Charity Accountability.\\" It explained, \\"without the requested information, it is not possible to determine whether this charity adheres to all of the BBB Standards for Charity Accountability.\\" Upon an appeal filed by Pavone the Congregation of the Clergy allowed Pavone to minister outside the Diocese of Amarillo, but recognized that he still must obtain specific permission to do so from his bishop. In November 2012, the Congregation of the Clergy decided that since the principal office of Priests for Life is in the archdiocese of New York, the archbishop of New York is the competent authority to exercise vigilance over the association. Pavone subsequently complied with demands to straighten out the group's finances and returned to New York to become accountable to his home diocese. In November 2014 Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, and former president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, wrote to the bishops of the United States to advise them that the Congregation of the Clergy had conducted an apostolic visitation of Priests for Life the previous year, and had subsequently requested that he \\"assist Father Pavone with several necessary reforms.\\" Cardinal Dolan wrote to advise the bishops that Pavone had not cooperated with the reforms. As a result, the cardinal told the Vatican that \\"I am unable to fulfill their mandate, and want nothing further to do with the organization.\\" In 2017 PFL moved from Staten Island to Titusville, Florida. =HHS Contraception Mandate Lawsuit= On February 15, 2012, Priests for Life filed a lawsuit against the contraception mandate, claiming that the Health and Human Services (HSS) ruling is unconstitutional on many levels. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.http://www.priestsforlife.org/hhsmandate/priests- for-life-v-sebelius.pdf The case was initially dismissed without prejudice. In November 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to review the case, which it combined with six other similar challenges to the Health and Human Services' Contraceptive Mandate under Zubik v. Burwell. Briefs were then scheduled for January 4, 2016.Zubik v.

(NYU Press 2005). =Pre-election videos= In early November 2016, ahead of the elections in the United States, Pavone, a member of Donald Trump's 33-member Catholic advisory council, posted a live video to Facebook in opposition to the continued \\"child killing\\" in America, urging people to vote for Trump. The Diocese of Amarillo, Texas, subsequently issued a statement that it was opening an investigation into the placement of a fetus on an altar, which was \\"against the dignity of human life and a desecration of the altar.\\" Priests for Life Canada Priests for Life Canada is independent of the organization in the United States. The Canadian organization stated that it was \\"deeply disturbed\\" by the actions of Priests for Life national director Frank Pavone in displaying the purported body of an aborted child on an altar. Father Thomas Lynch, president of Priests for Life Canada, stated that they supported the investigation concerning the video being undertaken by the Diocese of Amarillo.

With an apparent visual magnitude of 6.45, it requires dark skies and good seeing conditions to see this star with the naked eye. It has a planetary system with two confirmed extrasolar planets. Properties Based upon parallax measurements, this star is located at a distance of from the Earth. The spectral properties of 23 Librae identify it as stellar class G5 V, with the luminosity class of 'V' indicating that this is a main sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. This energy is being radiated from the outer envelope at an effective temperature of about 5,585 K, giving it the yellow hue typical of G-type stars. Estimates of the age of 23 Librae range from 8.4 to 11.1 billion years, making it much older than the Sun. 23 Librae is slightly larger than the Sun, with an estimated 107% of the Sun's mass and 125% of the Sun's radius. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, is higher than in the Sun. It appears to be rotating slowly, with the projected rotational velocity of 2.2 km‚àôs‚àí1 giving a lower bound to the actual azimuthal velocity along the equator. Planetary system In November 1999 an exoplanet 23 Librae b was announced orbiting 23 Librae, and in 2009 an additional planet was detected. Examination of the system in the infrared using the Spitzer Space Telescope did not reveal any excess emission, which might otherwise suggest the presence of a circumstellar debris disk of orbiting dust.

The club was revived in the early 1980s after some years in the wilderness, and has since gone from strength to strength. In the late 1980s, its membership was boosted by the arrival of players from the recently defunct Warninglid team and the influx of a number of players from Brighton. The club has its own pavilion, though with no toilet. There have been tours to Yorkshire, Devon, Suffolk and Ibiza. The club runs just one team, and has occasionally struggled with numbers, but in 2009 membership is healthier than for many years, due in large part to the feeding through of the next generation. The club now boasts no fewer than six father-son combinations among its members. Notable residents Douglas Bunn (1928 ‚Äì 2009), showjumping entrepreneur and businessman, lived in the parish, near Hickstead. He was godfather to model Jodie Kidd, who married entrepreneur Aidan Butler at St Peter's Church, Twineham on 10 September 2005.

The episode, a musical, was written by Chris Manheim and Steven L. Sears and directed by Oley Sassone. The series focuses on Xena (Lucy Lawless), a warrior in a quest to seek redemption for her past sins as a ruthless warlord by using her fighting skills to help people. Her best friend and traveling companion is Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor). In the episode, Xena and Gabrielle are brought to the Land of Illusia, where they have to work together again, letting their past mutual grievances go, in order to escape alive. Throughout the episode Xena and Gabrielle deal with the problems that had recently torn them apart and learn to focus on the stronger bond that brought them together in the first place. Acclaim Noted for being a rare musical episode of the series, combining both humor and drama, \\"The Bitter Suite\\" was nominated for two Emmy Awards. Regular series composer Joseph LoDuca was nominated for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song \\"The Love of Your Love\\" and LoDuca and lyricist Dennis Spiegel were nominated in the same category for the song \\"Hearts Are Hurting.\\"Variety Magazine, February 6, 1998 It was LoDuca's second and third nominations for the series out of a total of seven nominations, and one award, through the six-year run of the series. Plot After Gabrielle's daughter Hope kills Xena's son Solan in the previous episode, a rift grows between them, with Xena blaming Gabrielle for Solan's death. At the start of the episode, Xena attacks and attempts to kill Gabrielle, only to be thwarted at the last moment when both fall into the sea and are brought to the land of Illusia. Both of them awaken completely nude, and are guided and given new clothing by Callisto and Joxer. Then Ares, Lila, and their associates try to set Xena and Gabrielle against each other. The land of Illusia is never actually explained, though it is implied that it was created by a primordial divine force called 'Aleph', and by 'the fates'. The entire episode appears to be a deus ex machina to bring the two of them back together when nothing else could. Throughout the episode the two are forced to realize what drove them apart, and what is truly important to them. Ultimately realizing that the only thing separating the two of them is hate, and that they truly do love each other, and would sacrifice their own lives for each other. Production \\"The Bitter Suite\\" was shot in November 1997, in New Zealand. Some actors of the previous episode return, Hudson Leick as Callisto, Danielle Cormack, as Ephiny, and David Taylor as Solan. Other old actors in the series return in that episode, as Ted Raimi, Kevin Tod Smith, Willa O'Neill, Karl Urban and Marton Csokas. The series executive producer, Robert Tapert, was originally going to direct the episode himself, but he was forced to pull out at the last minute because of complications on Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. Kevin Smith was unable to rehearse the tango sequence in the episode with Lucy Lawless because Lucy had sprained her knee getting off her horse. Kevin had to rehearse with a dance instructor a foot shorter than Lucy. All ended well as Lucy's knee healed in a week, and Lucy was much easier to dance with because of her height. Hudson Leick's singing voice was dubbed in this episode by Broadway and film star Michelle Nicastro, although Leick did provide the narrations from Paul Foster Case's The Book of Tokens, and she also voiced the parts of the lyrics that sound more like talking than singing. Renee O'Connor's singing voice was dubbed by Broadway singer Susan Wood. Lucy Lawless, Kevin Smith, Ted Raimi, and Willa O'Neill did their own singing for the episode. At the Panathenaea Convention in London, England, on September 2, 2000, Willa O'Neill mentioned that she did her own singing in \\"The Bitter Suite.\\" She explained that she had to audition to Joseph LoDuca in Detroit by telephone. When they recorded the songs, the singing was done in a sound studio in New Zealand, but the actual taping was done in Detroit. After taping it, they then played it back while filming the episode. She found it weird to hear her voice singing during the filming. Tarot card references The costumes and scenes in \\"The Bitter Suite\\" are based upon tarot cards. The most-often referenced tarot deck is the 1931 BOTA tarot deck, and the second most-often referenced tarot deck is the 1977 Golden Dawn tarot deck by Israel Regardie and illustrator Robert Wang. Other referenced decks include the 1909 Rider-Waite tarot deck, the fiorentine minchiate deck, and the swiss 1JJ tarot deck. Callisto was the fool and then justice; Xena was the high priestess, then the chariot, and also death for a short time; Gabrielle was the star, then the empress, and then the world; Joxer was the hanged man and then the hermit; Ares was the emperor; Lila was the hierophant; and Solon was the magician. In chronological order, scenes were made to resemble the high priestess, wheel of fortune, the hanged man, the lovers, the moon, the chariot, the tower, judgement, the devil, temperance, and the sun. Most of the tarot-based costumes are based upon those depicted in the BOTA tarot deck, with the exceptions being Lila's hierophant costume (loosely based upon that of the Rider-Waite tarot deck), Gabrielle's world costume (based upon the universe card of the Golden Dawn tarot deck, which is the equivalent of the world card), and Ares's emperor costume. Ares's emperor costume combines traits from Roman emperors' outfits and the king of wands from the swiss 1JJ tarot deck. Xena's skirt from her 'chariot' costume is taken from the queen of wands from the swiss 1JJ tarot deck, and the other parts of her chariot costume incorporate aspects of Roman legionaries' uniforms. The orange-and- green and orange-yellow-and-green costumes of the people of the village of peace are based upon the clothing depicted in the suit of wands of the Rider- Waite tarot deck. The black-and-white checkered floor that is shown when Xena is in her BOTA high priestess card costume is taken from the justice card of the Golden Dawn tarot deck. That Golden Dawn justice card is related to the BOTA high priestess card because both cards incorporate the two masonic pillars, and have a person seated between them. The black-and-white checkered floor of the Golden Dawn justice card, like the two pillars, likewise derives from freemasonry. In the hanged man scene, Joxer's position of hanging over water was taken from the hanged man card of the Golden Dawn tarot deck. In the brief moon card scene, there are two rats in the foreground- one white and one brown; that is a reference to the elemental earth trump card of the fiorentine minchiate deck, which has a white rat and a brown rat in the foreground, and is loosely based upon the moon card of the marseille tarot deck. Also, the fortress that is depicted in the moon card scene is based upon the two fortresses that are depicted in the aforementioned earth card. In the village of peace, Gabrielle is given a bouquet of red-orange flowers, which she holds for a while; that is a reference to the strength card of the Golden Dawn tarot deck, in which a blond woman holds a bouquet of red-orange flowers. Inside the echoing temple, Xena and Gabrielle each stand beside a fluted column for a short time; that is a reference to the strength card of the fiorentine minchiate deck, in which a woman sits beside a fluted column. The devil card scene incorporates an element from the lovers card of the Golden Dawn tarot deck- namely, a blond woman who is chained by the wrists to a stone slab. The sun card scene combines the shoreline environment of the sun card of the Golden Dawn tarot deck with the reclining embracing posture of the two people on the sun card of the fiorentine minchiate deck. Book of Tokens references In The Book of Tokens by Paul Foster Case, the fool card is associated with the Hebrew letter aleph and the breath of life; the hanged man card is associated with the Hebrew letter mem and water; and the judgement card is associated with the Hebrew letter shin and fire. Those associations are based upon a far older book called the Sefer Yetzirah, which likewise associates aleph with breath, mem with water, and shin with fire. In The Bitter Suite, the fool named Aleph breaths life into Xena, after reciting a passage from the aleph chapter of The Book of Tokens; the hanged man Joxer is introduced by the water that Gabrielle emerges from, after Aleph recites a passage about water from the mem chapter of The Book of Tokens; and the judgement card scene makes much use of fire, including \\"three tongues of fire\\", which is a phrase from the shin chapter of The Book of Tokens, and is related to the three-pronged shape of the letter shin. The placement of the two groups of three upward \\"tongues of fire\\" in front of the two groups of three risen dead people, is a reference to the judgment card of the Golden Dawn tarot deck, in which the three upward prongs of a large red letter shin are in front of three risen dead people. A line in the heh/emperor chapter of The Book of Tokens is: \\"thou shalt see my back parts, but my face shall not be seen\\", and in The Bitter Suite, Emperor Ares initially has his throne turned around backwards for a while, so that only the back of his throne can be seen, and he himself can not be seen. A line in the daleth/empress chapter of The Book of Tokens is: \\"therefore is the door a cause of separation, and of the setting of one part against another\\", and in The Bitter Suite, during the time when Gabrielle is wearing her BOTA tarot empress costume, a mere door separates the village of peace from the lair of warriors, from which Gabrielle and Xena are set against each other. In the zain chapter of The Book of Tokens, the phrase \\"the path of the sword\\" is used twice, and in one of those usages, the larger passage is: \\"the airy spirit of the path of the sword; and this airy spirit is the breath of my angel\\". In The Bitter Suite, Xena's warriors form a sword-ridden path for her to walk through as she moves toward the door to Gabrielle, and as Xena begins walking through that path, airy vocals begin, and those airy vocals end shortly after Xena finishes walking through the path. In The Book of Tokens, the temperance card is associated with trial by fire and purification, and in The Bitter Suite's temperance card scene, the wall of falling water tries Gabrielle and Xena, and burns Xena at first because she still hates a dead enemy, but allows her to pass through after she loses that hate. The temperance card scene, which has burning water that falls into a river, which is beside an Eden-like environment, is also a reference to another occult book: The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly P. Hall, which mentions an occult doctrine that there is \\"fiery water\\" that pours into the rivers of Eden.

Early life and career Clara Whitehill Hunt was born in Utica, New York in the year of 1871. Born to Edwin and Mary M. Brown Hunt, who were originally from Sudbury, Massachusetts, Clara grew up on the farm. She attended the Utica Free Academy in Utica, New York for grade school, which has since been turned into a nursing home. Her father was known to have taught natural science at the same school during her attendance. Clara graduated high school in 1889 and began a career as a teacher shortly thereafter. After graduating high school in 1889 and becoming a teacher, Clara was promoted to Principal of Utica Public School where she had begun her career. Visiting the library often during her career as a teacher, Clara found the library to play an important role in the lives of children and teachers. Upon meeting with a trained librarian, Miss Louise Cutler, Clara was determined to become a trained librarian. Clara went on to attend the New York State Library School in Albany, New York in 1986. After spending two years in library school, Clara landed a job in Philadelphia and opened the New Children's Room of the Old Apprentices Library. From there she became an assistant in the reference department in Newark Public Library system, where she became acquainted with various library duties. During her time working in the library, Clara excelled at the task of working with children, which became her main focus as the years went on. In 1901, Clara was put in charge of the Newark Public Library's children's room, where she had first been hired as an assistant within the reference department. A few years later, Clara went to work at the Brooklyn Public Library as Superintendent of Work with Children. Clara spent 37 years within this position, from the year of 1903 to 1940. Over the years, as more branches surfaced, Clara helped to design and equip the children's rooms within the new established libraries. She was known to have designed the staff rooms as well, which she took pride in doing. One of her most famous designs, Clara provided the vision behind the children's room of the Central Library. Within the Brooklyn Public Library system, Clara help to open the first children's library in 1914, now noted as the Stone Avenue Branch. This library in particular housed smaller furniture, larger windows, decorations, a fireplace, and classrooms. Along with the other tasks noted above, Clara also trained children's librarians and staffed them within these libraries. Beginning in 1914, these informal trainings soon turned into formal training courses for children's librarians, which was incorporated into many schools' curricula thereafter. In addition to training new recruits, designing children's rooms, and working as a superintendent, Clara lectured for various library schools, edited for magazines, and authored books as well. There are five children's books that Clara is most well known for: * 1915- What Shall We Read to the Children? * 1916- About Harriet * 1918- The Little House in the Woods * 1924- Peggy's Playhouse * 1932- The Little House in the Green Valley Clara noted that she was inspired to write, What Shall We Read to the Children, after the mothers of the kindergartners that she worked with asked her this same question many times. Clara also noted that '\\"About Harriet,\\"was inspired by a young friend of hers who grew up in the city, a very different life from her own. Clara had a very strong opinion on the level at which a children's book should be written. Described as fair and idealistic, Clara was known to have not allowed comic books within her collections. During her career, she canvassed American publishers to produce high quality picture books that were up to the same standards of those that were being produced in Europe. The Houghton Mifflin Company began to publish high quality picture books by author E. Boyd Smith after being persuaded by Clara. For the Brooklyn Daily Eagle (1922), Clara states (as noted on the Brooklyn Public Library website), :\\"A long continued diet of mediocre reading will weaken a child's mental powers and ruin his appetite for good books...the child allowed to indulge in the cheap series habit becomes a sort of physiological dope fiend...Of course, some strong-brained children break away from a trash reading period, just as they emerge unhurt from the diseases of childhood.\\" Among many accomplishments, Clara presented the very first of the American Library Association Newbery Awards in 1922. She also was chairmen for the very first Newbery Committee, 1921-1922. Clara presented this award to Hendrik Willem van Loon for his work, The Story of Mankind. This yearly award began as a plan to honor the most distinguished children's author of the previous calendar year with a bronze medal for their achievement. Originally named the John Newbery Medal, it was named after an old London book seller who has been credited as one of the first to give special attention to children's collections.  Legacy  Having devoted most of her career to children's library services, Clara retired from her duties as a librarian in 1939. At this point Clara moved to Sudbury, Massachusetts, which would be her final resting place. Clara died on January 11, 1958 in her parents home town. Clara has left behind a legacy of her career within the Brooklyn Public Library, The Clara Whitehill Hunt Collection of Children's Literature. This collection encompasses 13,000 books, pamphlets, and periodicals, which date all the way back from 1741 up unto the 1950s. Within this collection is the Old Juvenile collection, which features 4,500 pieces dating from 1741 into the early 1900s. The Hunt Collection is available for viewing by appointment only.

Her chief shrine is in Ghatgaon, Keonjhar District, Odisha. Maa Tarini Temple  Conceptualisation of Maa Tarini  Maa Tarini is the presiding deity for all Shakti and Tantra peeths or shrines in Odisha. The origin of Shakti or worship of the Earth as a female embodiment of power is found across many cultures all over the world. In Odisha which has a high density of tribal population whose religious practices have been assimilated into the mainstream Hindu faith, the worship of natural formations such as rocks, tree trunks, rivers is widespread among the tribes. Maa Tarini is always depicted as a red face with two large eyes and a mark in the middle which serves as an indication for a nose and also a tilak. This primitive conception is symbolic of the simplicity of tribal beliefs and ceremonies. The red colour has been attributed to dyes made out of iron ores or ocher which are quite plentiful in the state and would thus have been used by the tribes for anointing and decorating the sacred figures of worship. The ornate letters in the background mean \\"Maa\\" or Mother in the Odia language. They were a much later addition although the Odia script did change very slightly over the millennia. In this form she is very similar to the conception of the Goddess Kali at Kalighat. Although the two are embodiments of the same divinity, Kali is the goddess of death and destruction whereas Maa Tarini is the force of life. Two of the names of Kali are Maa Tara and Maa Tarini. The hill shrine of Maa Tara Tarini the breast shrine of adi Shakti in Ganjam district of Odisha represents the force of Both Kali and Tarini and known as Maa Tara Tarini. Entry into Hinduism Kalinga, the ancient kingdom whose domain overlaps to a great extent with modern-day Odisha, was initially ruled by Jains. Jainism was the state religion for millennia with occasional breaks notably the reign of Ashoka who played a major role in propagating Buddhism around the world. Although the residents of the cities and towns of Kalinga were either Jains or Buddhists, the tribes who populated the hinterland maintained their primitive religions and do so to this day. With the advent of Hinduism, a lot of the rites, customs and even gods of the tribes were admitted into the Hindu pantheon, chief among them being Lord Jagannath and Maa Tarini. While Jagannath was pronounced as the incarnation of Lord Vishnu in the Dwapara Yuga, the goddess was decreed as one of the embodiments of Shakti herself. History of the shrine at Ghatagaon The exact sequence of events which led to the installation of the goddess at her chief shrine in Ghatagaon are still a matter of debate among historians. The reason is that the events have been recorded by poets in devotional works dedicated to her which thus also include some mythological events. Nevertheless, the gist is as below: Near about 1475 A.D. King Purusottam Dev ruled Kalinga. Once on a trip to South India he chanced upon Princess Padmavati of Kanchi and proposed marriage. The proposal was accepted and the minister of the king of Kanchi traveled to Puri to finalise the arrangements. The Rath Yatra was in full swing and he saw the king sweeping the chariots of the deities. Marriage to a sweeper was unacceptable and hence the marriage was called off. Insulted, the King of Puri declared war on Kanchi. He was defeated in the first war. He prayed to Lord Jagannath and it is believed that he was directed to appoint one Govinda Bhanja as his Senapati or General of his army. Bhanja was in fact the son of the king of Keonjhar and was staying in Puri because of differences with his father. Under the command of Bhanja, the army marched towards Kanchi. In the forests near Vijayanagar, the horse of Bhanja refused to move any further. Whatever may be the real reason it is here that Bhanja and thus Hindu society as a whole was introduced to Maa Tarini and she was admitted into the Pantheon. Mythological origin of the goddess Maa Tarini Temple In the Ramayana, after Sita was abducted by Ravana, Lord Rama and his brother Lakshmana started searching for her. When they reached the forest, near which later Vijayanagar was founded, Rama worshipped Devi Durga and sought her help. The goddess instructed Rama while he was meditating that he must not see her when she appears or she will turn to stone. Rama could not control himself and saw her and the goddess was embodied as a stone idol. She told Rama not to worry and call her later when she would definitely aid him. This second puja was performed by Ravana himself near Rameswaram before the Vanara Sena could cross over to Lanka. Ravana was deemed fit because this ceremony was performed in order to achieve victory in the war to follow. In order to defeat a warrior like Ravana, the performer had to be a Brahmin who performed the ritual of Trisandhya everyday without fail. At that time, Ravana was the only such Brahmin in all of Creation. After Lord Rama left, the stone idol was worshiped by the local tribes. Thus the ancient tribal goddess was described as a Hindu goddess. Continuation of the history Bhanja thus worshiped the goddess for her blessings in the war to follow. Bhanja was victorious and both the princess and the goddess were brought back to Puri. After the king of Keonjhar died, Bhanja returned to his state and took the idol of the goddess with him. Mythological accounts hold that Maa Tarini agreed to follow Bhanja provided he never looked backed all the way from Puri to Keonjhar. Bhanja agreed and the two left on horseback. Near the Baitarini river in modern Keonjhar district, Bhanja could no longer hear the following horse. He looked back and Maa halted then and there and asked Bhanja to construct her temple and worship her there. Rites and rituals The practice of Tantra is associated with all manifestations of Shakti throughout the Indian subcontinent. Utkal, a coastal kingdom which was carved out of the former Kalinga is described to have many important shrines and areas for the practice of Tantra. Maa Tarini is the presiding deity. =Sacrifices - Human and Animal= Sacrifices have been offered to many deities all over the world and the same is true in India. However, the practice persisted well into the 20th century in many shrines in Assam, Odisha and Bengal. Although both human sacrifices are banned and criminal, sporadic incidents occur. Tribes in many parts of India sometimes sacrifice virgins to the goddess. Sacrifice of large animals like buffaloes are banned but goats are still sacrificed in some remote temples.

The causes of USAR incidents can be categorised as accidental and deliberate. Structural collapse incidents can comprise unstable or collapsed structures in an unsafe position. Usually collapse incidents leave voids inside the debris that can result in numerous casualties trapped under large amounts of very heavy and often unstable debris. USAR services can be faced with complex rescue operations within hazardous environment. Incidents experience shows that people are often found alive many hours and days after rescue operations commence, and the corresponding services should be planned accordingly. USAR teams in different countries may be organised in a variety of ways, but they are often associated with firefighting services.E.g. English fire and rescue services are required by law to deal with \\"an emergency involving the collapse of a building or other structure\\". Section 3 of The Fire and Rescue Services (Emergencies) (England) Order 2007. The increasingly complex methods and procedures, and the modern ability to bring in teams from far afield has brought a very strong drive for standardization within nations and internationally, most obvious in the role of the United Nations' International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) in large natural disasters.\\"United States Response to the Earthquake in Bam, Iran\\", coe-dmha.org Urban search-and-rescue is considered a multi- hazard discipline, as it may be needed for a variety of hazards including earthquakes, cyclones, storms and tornadoes, floods, dam failures, technological accidents, terrorist activities, and hazardous materials releases. Types USAR task forces are often categorized for standardization. Depending upon the classification, there may be close to 70 positions. To be sure a full team can respond to an emergency, USAR task forces have at the ready more than 140 highly trained members. A task force is often a partnership between local fire departments, law enforcement agencies, federal and local governmental agencies and private companies. In the United States, these can be federally endorsed teams or state teams activated through mutual aid agreements. In England, the responsibility for USAR lies with local authority fire and rescue services. Equipment supplied to them is part of a government initiative known as the New Dimension programme,Dept for Communities and Local Government: Fire and Resilience - USAR (accessed 19 Jul 07) which provides the training and equipment. USAR teams bring together, in an integrated response: highly trained personnel from the emergency services along with engineers, medics and search dog pairs, specialised equipment effective communications established methods of command and control logistical support procedures to request international assistance if required under an international search and rescue framework. The training that teams receive is an ongoing procedure combining classes from the local fire and rescue services and government agencies. Equipment USAR task forces are expected to be totally self-sufficient for the first 72 hours of a deployment. The equipment cache used to support a task force can weigh more than 60,000 pounds and is worth more than $1.4 million US. USAR task forces can: *Conduct physical search-and-rescue in collapsed buildings *Provide emergency medical care to trapped victims *Utilize search and rescue dogs to find survivors of the collapse *Assess and control utilities and hazardous materials *Evaluate and stabilize damaged structures USAR truck, First Company, Santiago de Chile FD Techniques In a disaster situation the goal of a search and rescue operation is to rescue the greatest number of people in the shortest amount of time, while minimizing the risk to the rescuers. In the United States, the organization of USAR operations is now standardized under the National Incident Management System, which was in scattered usage before Hurricane Katrina but has since become the standard under [Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-5]). Katrina proved the difficulty of coordinating multiple disaster response teams from around the country when some used ICS and some used their own local organizational models. The three phases of a USAR operation=Sizeup= The first step is to gather facts and make decisions on the course of action. Factors include what types of structures are involved, the extent of damage, the layout of the building(s) involved, what hazards are present (such as downed power lines, natural gas leaks, flooding, animals, hazardous materials, or a structure susceptible to additional collapse during the rescue), and what rescue personnel and equipment are available. Structural damage can be categorized as light, moderate, or heavy. Sizeup is an ongoing process which should continue during all phases of search and rescue so operations can be modified as needed. =Search= Searchers should use a buddy system or two-in, two-out system and have backup teams available. Techniques for searching for potential victims are based on identifying possible locations of victims, or areas of entrapment. Areas of entrapment inside damaged structures are called voids. There are several types of voids, such as the pancake void (multiple floors of a building have collapsed diagonally onto each other), and the lean-to void (a single wall or floor has collapsed diagonally against another wall). Voids can also include spaces where victims may have entered for self-protection during a disaster - such as under desks or in bathtubs or closets. Example of FEMA's marking system in New Orleans's Lower Ninth Ward Once the potential areas of entrapment have been identified and the potential number of victims sized up, search operations should commence in an orderly manner, beginning with verbally calling out for victims to identify their location if possible, and searching using a systematic search pattern. Possible search patterns include triangulation (using three searchers approaching a potential area of entrapment from three different directions), a right/left search pattern (one team searches the left side and one team the right side of a building), or a bottom-up/top-down search pattern. Searchers should stop frequently to listen for noises or attempted communication from victims; often this can involve all searchers stopping activity at specified periods of time to listen. In situations where multiple structures are searched such as after a hurricane, the outside of buildings can be marked using the appropriate marking systems to indicate buildings which have already been searched, the results of the search, and to avoid duplication of search efforts. =Rescue= Trapped victims are removed and medical aid rendered as necessary. The triage system can be used to prioritize medical aid with those needing immediate attention aided first. Removal or stabilization of debris is often necessary to remove victims. This can be accomplished using leveraging to lift the object, or cribbing (constructing a rectangular wooden framework known as a box crib underneath the object to be stabilized). Leveraging and cribbing can be combined. Victims who are ambulatory can then self-extricate, or victims can be removed using lifts, drags, or carries. Removal of victims should be done so as to avoid any further injury: Where any neck or back injury is suspected, the cervical spine should be immobilized first before attempting to move victims, and dragging should be avoided in situations where the presence of debris (e.g., broken glass) would cause further injury by doing so. Marking systems Clear standards for marking searched structures are an important part of the process. There are two systems in widespread use, INSARG and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency). =INSARAG= Internationally, markings on searched structures usually use the International Search & Rescue Advisory Group marking system:\\"INSARAG Guidelines and Methodology\\", F12.6 Structural Marking, page 75 INSARAG marking system * A 1 meter by 1 meter square with G or N (for go or no-go), the team conducting the search, the date and time of the start of the search, and the date and time of the completion of the search written inside. * The number of live victims removed is written to the left of the square. The number of dead victims found is written to the right of the square. Persons unaccounted for and/or location of other victims is written below the square. * Additional information on hazards pertaining to the structure is written above the square. * Any reference to building floor numbers use ground as G, 1 as the first floor above G, B1 as the first floor below G, and so forth. This is contrasted with US floor numbering, that starts with 1 as the ground level. * When the team has cleared the building to the best of its ability, a circle is drawn around the square. * When the building has been confirmed clear, a horizontal line is drawn through the entire marking. * INSARAG marking squares should be written in day-glo orange. =FEMA= Chart showing some common uses of the FEMA marking system in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina In the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) uses a different marking system on searched structures, as follows: * A single diagonal slash indicates that a search of the building is in progress. This is used to indicate searcher locations and to avoid duplication of the search effort. * An X inside a square means \\"Dangerous - Do Not Enter!\\" * An X with writing around it means \\"Search Completed\\", with the time (and the date if appropriate) written above the X, the team conducting the search written to the left side of the X, the results of the search (number of victims removed, number of dead, type of search such as primary or secondary) written below the X, and any additional information noted about the structure to the right of the X. These x-codesDorothy Moye, \\"Katrina + 5: An X-Code Exhibition,\\" Southern Spaces 26 August 2010 are used in a variety of situations and were prolific (and adopted and modified by other agencies) during post-Katrina operations.

Playing career A left-handed hitter who threw right-handed, Franks was listed at tall and . He broke into professional baseball with the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League in 1932, but he was soon acquired by the St. Louis Cardinals and joined their vast farm system. He made the Cardinals for just 17 games and 17 at-bats in 1939, before being drafted by the Brooklyn Dodgers, where he served as a second-string catcher in 1940‚Äì41 and began his long association with Leo Durocher, then Brooklyn's manager.

In August of that season, however, he resigned his post to return to the Major Leagues as a backup catcher with the Philadelphia Athletics, where he appeared in 48 games in 1947‚Äì48 and batted .221. Coaching career In 1949, Franks received his first coaching assignment, as an aide to Durocher with the New York Giants, and was activated for one final MLB game on August 28, 1949‚Äîgoing 2-for-3 against the Cincinnati Reds in a 4‚Äì2 New York triumph.Retrosheet As a New York Giant from 1949‚Äì55, he was a member of two National League championship clubs (, ) and was the third-base coach of the World Series (1954) title team. According to author Joshua Prager in his 2006 book The Echoing Green, Franks played a critical role in the Giants' Bobby Thomson's famous pennant-winning home run in the 1951 NL tiebreaker playoffs‚ÄîBaseball's Shot Heard Round The World. According to Prager, Franks was stationed in the Giants' center-field clubhouse at the Polo Grounds, their home field, stealing the opposing catcher's signs through a telescope and relaying them through second-string catcher Sal Yvars (positioned in the bullpen) to the Giants' coaches and hitters.The New York Times, March 31, 2009 When asked where he was when Thomson hit his home run, Franks said, in 1996, that he was \\"doing something for Durocher\\" at the time. Whatever his role may have been on that day, Franks was known as a devotee of Durocher-style, win-at-any-cost baseball, including intimidation through flying spikes and brushback pitching. Dodger outfielder Carl Furillo told author Roger Kahn that Franks was known to poke his head into the Brooklyn clubhouse before games, to taunt Furillo that Giant pitchers were planning to throw at his head in the upcoming contest. Furillo, whose hatred for Durocher was so intense that he would engage Durocher in a fistfight in a Giant dugout filled with enemy players, said of the Giants, in Peter Golenbock's book Bums: An Oral History of the Brooklyn Dodgers, \\"They were dirty ballplayers ...

Polin (October 7, 1930 ‚Äì July 2, 2018) was an Orthodox rabbi who served in Brooklyn, New York, attained a number of distinctions in his life. Born in Chicago, Illinois, he was the son of Dorothy and Abraham Polin, and the grandson of Sholom Polin and Sara (Shashaka) Rivka (Chernick). Rabbi Polin studied at the Hebrew Theological College  Beth Midrash L'Torah‚Äîin his native city, from which he received his ordination and bachelor of Hebrew literature degree cum laude. At his ordination, he was awarded a prize for his Hebrew essay 'Rabbi Joseph Albo and the Debate at Tortosa, 1413‚Äì14.' He also holds a master of arts degree in education from the University of Chicago. Rabbi Polin spent his retirement in Israel with the rest of his family. He died on July 2, 2018, aged 87. From the Congressional Record In the Congressional Record for the 105th Congress (1997‚Äì1998), Senator Charles E. Schumer devoted a speech in the United States House of Representatives to Rabbi Polin on October 2, 1997, that noted Rabbi Milton H. Polin as spiritual leader of Brooklyn's Kingsway Jewish Center since 1974 and past president of the Rabbinical Council of America. Ordained in the 1950s, his teachers characterized him as \\"a gifted young scholar who will inspire a profound reverence for Torah Judaism.\\" More recently, he was paid tribute by the U.S. House of Representatives for being \\"a man highly esteemed and respected by Jews and Christians whose lives have been touched by numerous good works and kind deeds of this outstanding spiritual and civic leader.\\" His rabbinic leadership has transformed his congregation into a pulsating center of Torah learning and communal activity for hundreds of young, highly educated, religiously observant families. He personally teaches a variety of classes for men and women of all ages and backgrounds at his synagogue. During his presidency of the Rabbinical Council of America, he participated actively in the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. After his presidency, he continued to maintain regular contact with the chief rabbis and government leaders in Israel. He was active in the larger community in many capacities, Rabbi Polin was invited to join the Orthodox Caucus, an Orthodox think tank in North America, and the board of directors of the Beth Din of America. A lifelong religious zionist, Rabbi Polin was national vice president of the Religious Zionists of America after previously serving as president of that organization's Greater New York Council. He was a member of the Rabbinic Advisory Council of the Jewish National Fund. In the several communities he served, Rabbi Polin built a mikvah (\\"ritual bath\\"), an eruv (an area designated for carrying outdoors on the Jewish Sabbath), and two synagogues. His interest in kashruth (\\"dietary laws supervision\\") and responsibility for communal supervision long predated his chairmanship of the Rabbinic Kashruth Commission, the halakhic authority for the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America Kashruth Division. He served as chairman of the Kashruth Committee of the Vaad Harabbanim of Flatbush. Rabbi Polin was a trustee of the international Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture. He was vice president of the Coordinating Council on Bikur Cholim of Greater New York. Previously he had served as chaplain of the Kings County Council of the Jewish War Veterans and as a member of both the rabbinic advisory and the executive councils of the Commission on Synagogue Relations, which are agencies of the UJA-Federation of the Jewish Philanthropies of New York. He chaired the Committee on the Public Information and Education of the Task Force on Missionary Activities of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York. Rabbi Polin served two terms as president of the 90-member Vaad Harabbanim of Flatbush and chaired its Jubilee Anniversary celebration. He participated actively on the Board of Education of the Yeshiva of Flatbush for many years. With his wife, Shainee, he was sent to the former Soviet Union more than two decades ago when Jews were not allowed to leave. They shared their experiences, insights, and concerns for Soviet Jews in several forums. It was this experience that sensitized them to the special needs of today's new American families. An eloquent speaker and acclaimed scholar, Rabbi Polin's sermons have appeared annually in the Rabbinical Council of America Sermon Anthology. Yeshiva University President Dr. Norman Lamm characterized his sermons as enlightening and creative. His scholarly articles have been published in such journals as \`Judaism,' \`Tradition,' and \`The Hebrew Theological College Journal.' Several of his halakhic studies on Maimonides' Code has been published in Hadarom. Rabbi Polin is listed in \`Who's Who in World Jewry,' \`Who's Who in Israel,' and \`Jewish Personalities All Over the World,' and \`Who's Who in Religion.' He was married to the former Shainee Sachs, with whom he had 5 children. He also had 18 grandchildren. Three of their children live in Israel, and 13 of their grandchildren are sabras (born in Israel). Senator Schumer concluded: :He never fails to leave me inspired by his words and honored by his presence. After 43 years of outstanding congregational and communal leadership throughout the country, he retires from his dedicated and faithful service. Rabbi Polin leaves behind a legacy that has touched us all in so many ways and at so many levels. Thank you, Rabbi, for being such an inspiration.

The film was directed by Robert Parrish, a former child star and later editor in his debut as a director.. Plot Rocky Mulloy was sentenced to life in prison for a robbery and murder that he did not commit. He is released five years later when an \\"eyewitness\\", a one-legged ex-Marine named Delong, appears and provides a fake alibi. Delong wants a share of the missing loot: $100,000. Rocky insists he was not involved and sets out to find who framed him, hoping to free his friend Danny Morgan, still in prison for the same crime. They go see Morgan's wife Nancy, a former love of Rocky's, who now lives in a trailer park. Police Lt. Gus Cobb tells Rocky he will be under 24-hour surveillance. Rocky believes that bookie Louis Castro is the mastermind. He demands $50,000 at gunpoint. Castro only gives him $500 to bet on a longshot on a fixed horse race. Rocky collects $4000, but he soon finds out that the money is from a payroll robbery, gives it all back to the police, and is nearly arrested until Castro claims he never met with Rocky, a lie the police know is false since they tailed Rocky to Castro's office previously. Later, two men shoot at Delong and his girlfriend Darlene near Rocky's rented trailer. Driving away to escape, they are shot at and crash. Delong is injured and Darlene is killed. Nancy realizes they were mistaken for Rocky and her. Rocky then plays Russian roulette with Castro, with the gun always pointed at the bookie, until Castro reveals where the robbery money is. He also claims Morgan participated in the robbery and committed the murder and that Nancy has his share. Rocky orders Castro to telephone Cobb and tell him he will make a full confession. Castro instead calls his henchmen, the ones who killed Darlene. However, Rocky is not fooled. He calls Cobb himself, and the two killers walk into a police trap. Then Rocky goes to see Nancy and tells her he could not find Castro. Nancy confesses she has the money. She says she loves him and begs him to run away together with the loot. Rocky pretends to agree, but leaves her for the law.

It is equivalent to the category of free T-algebras. The Kleisli category is one of two extremal solutions to the question Does every monad arise from an adjunction? The other extremal solution is the Eilenberg‚ÄìMoore category. Kleisli categories are named for the mathematician Heinrich Kleisli. Formal definition Let ‚ü®T, Œ∑, Œº‚ü© be a monad over a category C. The Kleisli category of C is the category CT whose objects and morphisms are given by :\\\\begin{align}\\\\mathrm{Obj}({\\\\mathcal{C}_T}) &= \\\\mathrm{Obj}({\\\\mathcal{C}}), \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{C}_T}(X,Y) &= \\\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\\\mathcal{C}}(X,TY).\\\\end{align} That is, every morphism f: X -> T Y in C (with codomain TY) can also be regarded as a morphism in CT (but with codomain Y). Composition of morphisms in CT is given by :g\\\\circ_T f = \\\\mu_Z \\\\circ Tg \\\\circ f : X \\\\to T Y \\\\to T^2 Z \\\\to T Z where f: X -> T Y and g: Y -> T Z. The identity morphism is given by the monad unit Œ∑: :\\\\mathrm{id}_X = \\\\eta_X. An alternative way of writing this, which clarifies the category in which each object lives, is used by Mac Lane.Mac Lane(1998) p.147 We use very slightly different notation for this presentation. Given the same monad and category C as above, we associate with each object X in C a new object X_T, and for each morphism f\\\\colon X\\\\to TY in C a morphism f^*\\\\colon X_T\\\\to Y_T. Together, these objects and morphisms form our category C_T, where we define :g^*\\\\circ_T f^* = (\\\\mu_Z \\\\circ Tg \\\\circ f)^*. Then the identity morphism in C_T is :\\\\mathrm{id}_{X_T} = (\\\\eta_X)^*. Extension operators and Kleisli triples Composition of Kleisli arrows can be expressed succinctly by means of the extension operator (‚Äì)* : Hom(X, TY) -> Hom(TX, TY). Given a monad ‚ü®T, Œ∑, Œº‚ü© over a category C and a morphism f : X -> TY let :f^* = \\\\mu_Y\\\\circ Tf. Composition in the Kleisli category CT can then be written :g\\\\circ_T f = g^* \\\\circ f. The extension operator satisfies the identities: :\\\\begin{align}\\\\eta_X^* &= \\\\mathrm{id}_{TX}\\\\\\\\\\\\ f^*\\\\circ\\\\eta_X &= f\\\\\\\\\\\\ (g^*\\\\circ f)^* &= g^* \\\\circ f^*\\\\end{align} where f : X -> TY and g : Y -> TZ. It follows trivially from these properties that Kleisli composition is associative and that Œ∑X is the identity. In fact, to give a monad is to give a Kleisli triple ‚ü®T, Œ∑, (‚Äì)*‚ü©, i.e. * A function T\\\\colon \\\\mathrm{ob}(C)\\\\to \\\\mathrm{ob}(C); * For each object A in C, a morphism \\\\eta_A\\\\colon A\\\\to T(A); * For each morphism f\\\\colon A\\\\to T(B) in C, a morphism f^*\\\\colon T(A)\\\\to T(B) such that the above three equations for extension operators are satisfied. Kleisli adjunction Kleisli categories were originally defined in order to show that every monad arises from an adjunction. That construction is as follows. Let ‚ü®T, Œ∑, Œº‚ü© be a monad over a category C and let CT be the associated Kleisli category. Using Mac Lane‚Äôs notation mentioned in the ‚ÄúFormal definition‚Äù section above, define a functor F: C -> CT by :FX = X_T\\\\; :F(f\\\\colon X \\\\to Y) = (\\\\eta_Y \\\\circ f)^* and a functor G : CT -> C by :GY_T = TY\\\\; :G(f^*\\\\colon X_T \\\\to Y_T) = \\\\mu_Y \\\\circ Tf\\\\; One can show that F and G are indeed functors and that F is left adjoint to G. The counit of the adjunction is given by :\\\\varepsilon_{Y_T} = (\\\\mathrm{id}_{TY})^* : (TY)_T \\\\to Y_T. Finally, one can show that T = GF and Œº = GŒµF so that ‚ü®T, Œ∑, Œº‚ü© is the monad associated to the adjunction ‚ü®F, G, Œ∑, Œµ‚ü©. =Showing that GF = T= For any object X in category C: : (G \\\\circ F)(X) = G(F(X)) : \\\\qquad = G(X_T) : \\\\qquad = TX. For any f : X \\\\rightarrow Y in category C: : (G \\\\circ F)(f) = G(F(f)) : \\\\qquad = G((\\\\eta_Y \\\\circ f)^*) : \\\\qquad = \\\\mu_Y \\\\circ T(\\\\eta_Y \\\\circ f) : \\\\qquad = \\\\mu_Y \\\\circ T\\\\eta_Y \\\\circ Tf : \\\\qquad = \\\\text{id}_{TY} \\\\circ Tf : \\\\qquad = Tf. Since (G \\\\circ F)(X) = TX is true for any object X in C and (G \\\\circ F)(f) = Tf is true for any morphism f in C, then G \\\\circ F = T. \\\\ \\\\ \\\\square References  * Jacques Riguet & Rene Guitart (1992) Enveloppe Karoubienne et categorie de Kleisli, Cahiers de Topologie et G√©om√©trie Diff√©rentielle Cat√©goriques 33(3) : 261‚Äì6, via Numdam.org External links * Category:Adjoint functors Category:Categories in category theory ","title":"Kleisli category"},{"id":"3957201","text":"A signature weapon or weapon of choice is a weapon commonly associated with a certain group or individual.

However it is not the highest level of rugby union in Scotland, as Edinburgh Rugby and Glasgow Warriors play against Irish, Welsh and Italian teams in the Pro14. Some matches are shown live on BBC Alba. Until the 2009‚Äì10 season, the bottom two teams were relegated to the Second Division.

From the start of the 2012‚Äì13 season promotion/relegation between the Premiership and the newly formed National League (formerly the Second Division) is determined as follows: the winner of the National League is automatically promoted replacing the bottom placed team from the Premiership with a play-off between the 9th placed Premiership team and the 2nd placed National League team to determine the second promotion place. The underlying principles behind league reconstruction as set out by the Season Structure Working Party of the Scottish Rugby Council were (a) to shorten the season, (b) to reduce travel costs, (c) to reduce time involved for all, (d) to assist in growing the game and (e) to retain players in the game.http://files.pitchero.com/clubs/3379/SeasonStructureWorkingPartyReport.pdf The current teams playing in the Premier League are: Premier League, 2015‚Äì16 *Ayr RFC *Boroughmuir RFC *Currie RFC *Dundee HSFP *Gala RFC *Hawick RFC *Heriots RFC *Melrose RFC *Selkirk RFC *Stirling County RFC Past winners # * Hawick #Hawick #Hawick #Hawick #Hawick #Hawick #Heriot's FP #Gala #Gala #Hawick #Gala #Hawick #Hawick #Hawick #Hawick #Kelso #Kelso #Melrose #Boroughmuir #Melrose #Melrose #Melrose #Stirling County #Melrose #Melrose #Watsonians #Heriot's FP #Heriot's FP #Hawick #Hawick #Boroughmuir #Glasgow Hawks #Glasgow Hawks #Glasgow Hawks #Currie RFC #Boroughmuir #Ayr RFC #Currie RFC #Melrose RFC #Melrose RFC #Ayr RFC #Melrose RFC #Heriot's FP See also * Rugby union in Scotland References Category:National rugby union premier leagues 2 Category:1973 establishments in Scotland Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1973 fr:Championnat d'√âcosse de D1 de rugby √† XV ","title":"Scottish Premiership Division One"},{"id":"3957240","text":"Deuces is a solitaire card game which is played with two decks of playing cards. It is so called because each foundation starts with a \\"deuce\\", or two card. It also belongs to a family of card games which includes Busy Aces, which is derived from Forty Thieves. Rules First, the eight two cards are separated from the deck and placed in two rows to form the foundations. Then, ten cards, four above the foundations and three at each of the left and the right of the foundations, are dealt. These are the bases for the tableau piles. The foundations should be built up by suit up to kings, then aces. In the tableau, building is down by suit, also aces can be built upon by kings. The top cards of each tableau piles are available for play on the foundations or on other tableau piles. Sequences, where in part or in whole, can be moved as one unit. Spaces in the tableau are filled only with cards from either the stock or the wastepile. The stock can be dealt one card at a time, onto a wastepile, the top card of which is available for play on the foundations and on the tableau. There is no redeal The game is won when all the cards are dealt onto the foundations with the aces on top.

It killed 73 people and injured about 400. About 30,000 people had gathered outside the stadium waiting to participate in the first anniversary episode of the former television variety show Wowowee. Stampede=Background= On February 4, 2006, about 30,000 people had gathered outside the PhilSports Stadium to participate in the first anniversary episode of the then popular and now-defunct ABS-CBN early afternoon television game show, Wowowee. It was scheduled at 1 pm. The football stadium was supposed to be the viewing area of people who were not able to enter the basketball arena, where the program was to be staged. The size of the crowd was significantly larger than the usual 5,000 who attended previous recordings which were held at ABS-CBN studios. It was the show's first anniversary event, and there were prizes awaiting to be offered including jeepneys, taxis and a top prize of one million pesos. According to a Philippine Daily Inquirer report, most of the victims were from the poorest parts of the Metropolitan Manila and nearby provinces, generally jobless and attracted by the show's promise of instant wealth. =Stampede= At about 6:00am., organizers of the show began handing out tickets to people in the crowd, many of whom had been camping outside the stadium for days to acquire them. Overhearing the news, people started trying to get ahead of the queue and became agitated. As people in front of the line were given entrance to the stadium, the crowds became more impatient and started pushing forward and shoving, prompting security guards to panic and shut the entrance gates. Witnesses and several survivors reported that the stampede began when the already impatient crowd continued pushing and shoving, causing one of the gates used to keep people in queue to collapse. Coincidentally, the gates happened to be on a sloped driveway and when security guards tried to seal the gates further and calm the crowd, the crowd continued pushing and shoving as well as shaking the gates until they were forced open. After the gates eventually gave way, people at the front collapsed from exhaustion while others behind them stumbled. The sloped driveway contributed to the worsening of the stampede. =Casualties= The stampede killed 73 people and injured around 800 people. The majority of the victims were young and middle-aged women including elderly people. Senator and Philippine National Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon said that most of the injured were not in serious condition and many have been treated and released. It was earlier thought that 88 people had died, but this was due to double counting by the rescue workers. =Rescue and assistance= The Philippine National Red Cross led by chairman Richard Gordon, ABS-CBN's affiliated NGOs, and the TV network itself led the efforts in recovering the dead bodies, providing medical care for the injured, and other related assistance. The victims were also fully assisted by government authorities. As a result of the tragedy, the network temporarily canceled the show and indefinitely postponed the anniversary presentation. ABS-CBN's current chairman Eugenio \\"Gabby\\" Lopez III, who was also the company's Chief Executive Officer at the time of the incident, promised to provide aid and financial assistance to the victims and their families. The network also formed 71 Dreams Foundation to assist the relatives of the victims. Investigation and aftermath=Bomb threats= Some survivors and officials stated in reports that the stampede was caused and worsened by false bomb threats shouted by one or more rowdy crowd members. A report by BBC and ABC News also theorized the legitimacy of the alleged bomb scares but police and other authorities denied the statements due to insufficient evidence. =Task Force Ultra= Task Force Ultra, an inter-agency investigating body consisting of the National Capital Region Police Office, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the Department of Justice, was created to investigate the cause of the stampede. According to its findings, Wowowee offered only very few tickets to a very large crowd, which had been waiting for days to gain entry to the stadium. In its statement, the stampede was triggered by an ABS-CBN staff member announcing to the crowd gathered at the gate that only the first 300 people in line beneath the covered walkway leading to the stadium would be chosen to participate in the Pera o Bayong portion of the show. This portion, which offered from ‚Ç±10,000 to ‚Ç±50,000 in prizes (US$193 to $969 at a rate of $1=‚Ç±51.70), \\"excited\\" the crowd and \\"incited the people who were outside the official queue to push their way into the already jampacked queue, hoping that they could squeeze in among the first 300.\\" To control the deluge of people wanting to get in, the network's staff closed the gate, but the rush of people, coupled with the steep incline and uneven surface of the road caused those in front of the mob to stumble and fall, culminating in the stampede that caused the majority of the deaths and injuries. It was also reported an \\"obvious lack of coordination\\" between the organizers and relevant government agencies. It said that while ABS-CBN had sought the assistance of Pasig‚Äôs mayor and police chief, \\"neither was invited to any of the organizers' production meetings.\\" The National Telecommunications Commission, a government agency that supervises all radio and television broadcasting stations and other telecommunications services, said ABS-CBN could lose its license to operate if it is proven that the network was \\"delinquent\\" in providing enough measures to protect those who went to the venue. The commission will compose an inquiry as to whether ABS- CBN violated a 1985 circular that requires TV networks \\"not to commit any act that would be detrimental to public health, public welfare or public safety.\\" On October 2006, relatives of the victims announced that a class suit will be filed against ABS-CBN and its chief executive officer (CEO). ‚ÄúThere is now probable cause (for the case),‚Äù said Dante Jimenez, the chairman of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC).http://newsinfo.inq7.net/inquirerheadlines/metro/view_article.php?article_id=28322 On January 29, 2008, the Supreme Court ruled with finality dismissing ABS- CBN's case of junking the investigation by the Department of Justice. Hence after 2 years of ABS-CBN's blocking of closure to the event, the DOJ can now indict all of those involved in the stampede except for Willie Revillame, the show's host.SC junks with finality ABS-CBN plea vs DoJ in Pasig stampede by Tetch Torres, Inquirer.net, 18:21:00 01/29/2008 Reaction Then-Pope Benedict XVI, expressed sadness over the incident after the news hit Rome and other parts of the world. Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano said in a telegram to Pasig district Bishop Francisco San Diego that 'the Pope offers his prayers and condolences for all those affected by this terrible accident.' On the first anniversary of the disaster, rather than celebrating the second anniversary of the show, Wowowee offered the last segment of the show to a candlelight vigil lent and moment of silence in the studio with Revillame giving a short statement and the show ending with Yeng Constantino singing \\"Hawak Kamay.\\". Simultaneously, the hosts, producers, and the director of Eat Bulaga!, Wowowees rival variety show on GMA Network, offered a minute of silence and prayers for the victims of the stampede before they started the show. A contestant on the show's former segment, \\"On The Spot Jackpot\\", had a relative who died during the incident and shared his/her experiences about what happened before quoting that \\"life is more important than money\\". ABS-CBN later thanked their rival network for their prayers and sympathies. The 2007 and 2010 editions of Guinness World Records cited this incident as \\"the greatest death toll in a game show\\".'Wowowee' on 2007 Guinness World Records ReferencesExternal links * Soccer stadium stampede (BBC) Category:Human stampedes in 2006 Category:Man-made disasters in the Philippines Category:2006 disasters in the Philippines Category:History of Metro Manila Category:21st century in Manila Category:February 2006 events in Asia Category:Willie Revillame Category:ABS-CBN ","title":"PhilSports Stadium stampede"},{"id":"3957277","text":"Hyperglycinemia may refer to one of two related inborn amino acid disorders that are characterized by elevated levels of glycine in the blood. * Propionic acidemia, also known as \\"ketotic glycinemia\\" * Glycine encephalopathy, also known as \\"non-ketotic hyperglycinemia\\" Category:Amino acid metabolism disorders ","title":"Hyperglycinemia"},{"id":"3957284","text":"Federal Highway, as seen from KJ19 Universiti LRT Station.

Chaired by deputy Alain Gest, a member of the Union for French Democracy conservative party, the commission had to determine what should constitute a cult. It came to categorize various groups according to their supposed threat or innocuity (towards members of the groups themselves or towards society and the state). The Commission reported back in December 1995. See drop-down essay on \\"Religious Freedom in France\\" Some non-French-citizens and certain organizations, including the Church of Scientology and the United States Department of State, criticized its categorization-methodology as such. The Parliamentary Commission always bore in mind the difficulties of establishing any objective classification, although it never called into question the actual ethical and political imperatives of doing so, especially in the wake of the Order of the Solar Temple \\"mass suicides\\" and other dangerous cult activities occurring around the world (such as, for example, the 1995 poison- gas attack in Tokyo's subway by the Aum Shinrikyo group). The Commission held various hearings with persons involved in new-religious-movement activities or involved in anti-cult movements, and had the French secret service Renseignements G√©n√©raux give it lists of NRM activities and memberships. (For a list of the groups (with name-translations) included in the 1995 report, see Governmental lists of cults and sects) Subsequent French Parliamentary Commissions on cults reported in 1999 and in 2006. In a 2005 circulaire which stressed ongoing vigilance concerning cults, the Prime Minister of France suggested that due to changes in cult behavior and organization, the list of specific cults (which formed a part of the 1995 report) had become less pertinent. The Prime Minister asked his civil servants in certain cases to avoid depending on generic lists of cult groups but instead to apply criteria set in consultation with the Interministerial Commission for Monitoring and Combating Cultic Deviances (MIVILUDES). History The first Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France was created in 1995, but the cults had long been watched by the Direction centrale des renseignements g√©n√©raux. A report had already been done on this issue in 1983 by Alain Vivien, on a request by the Prime Minister. The 1995 Commission attempted to measure the magnitude of the cult phenomenon at that time and compiled a list of 173 cults which met at least one of the ten criteria of dangerousness defined by the Direction centrale des renseignements g√©n√©raux. However, it was not a definitive or exhaustive list. The day after the publication of the report, namely on 23 December 1995, the bodies of 16 victims of \\"collective suicide\\" of the Solar Temple were found, which contributed in giving to the report a particular resonance, although it did not mention the Ordre of the Solar Temple in its list. Following this report, an Observatoire interminist√©riel sur les sectes was established in 1996, then in 1998, the Government developed a new inter- ministerial organization, the Mission interminist√©rielle de lutte contre les sectes (MILS), which was later replaced by the MIVILUDES. It therefore published its own studies, which are frequently confused with the parliamentary reports. The second Parliamentary Commission on cults published its second report in 1999, and is commonly known as \\"parliamentary report on cults and money\\". It was intended to make an inventory of financial, inheritancial and tax situation of cults, their economic activities and their relationships with the business community. In 2001, the About-Picard law strengthened legislation against cults. In 2006, the National Assembly of France decided to create a new parliamentary commission about the influence of cults and the consequences of their practices on the physical and mental health of minors. In 2008, a Union for a Popular Movement deputy, Jacques Myard, submitted a proposal for a parliamentary commission on cults, especially in medical and paramedical fields.  Commission of 1995  Its report was unanimously adopted on 20 December 1995 by the 7 deputies who were present (out of 21; the other members had not received their notification because of a postal service strike). Jean-Pierre Brard, vice-chairman of the commission, considered that the propositions were \\"insufficient\\" and wanted to adopt a \\"special legislation\\" to effectively fight against dangerous cults. He said: \\"This vote is thus not representative of the whole commission. If I had been present, I would have abstained.\\" The rules of the National Assembly say the report is still valid regardless of the number present. =Definition of \\"cult\\"= The report says: \\"Twenty hearings were conducted in these conditions, for a total of twenty-one hours. They have allowed the Commission to take note of information, experience and analysis of people having, for various reasons, a thorough knowledge of the cult phenomenon, whether administrators, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, representatives of organizations that assist victims of cults, and of course, former members of cults and leaders of cultic associations. The Commission has also requested assistance from various agencies in an attempt to refine the best knowledge of the scope of his study.\\" The Minister of the Interior was the most important source of information. Given the difficulty of defining the concept of cult, the Commission decided to resume the criteria followed by the Direction centrale des renseignements g√©n√©raux, which it considers as \\"a body of evidence, each of which could lead to lengthy discussions.\\" * Threats to people:  mental destabilization;  exaggerated financial demands;  separation from one's home environment;  damage to physical integrity;  indoctrination of children; * Threats to the community:  more or less anti-social speech;  public disorder;  importance of judicial involvements;  possible diversion of traditional economic circuits;  attempts to infiltration of public powers. The Commission believes that it \\"was aware that neither the novelty nor the small number of followers, or even eccentricity could be retained as criteria\\" and explains: \\"The scope of its study has been voluntarily restricted to a certain number of associations gathering, usually around a spiritual leader, people sharing the same belief in a being or a number of transcendental ideas, situated or not at odds with \\"traditional\\" religions (Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist) which were excluded from this study, and on which have, at one time or another, been suspected of any activity contrary to public policy or individual freedoms.\\" Mindful not to give a result exactly impartial, the Commission nevertheless chose these criteria to conduct a partial analysis of reality, holding the common sense that the public ascribes to the notion of cult. The published report of the Parliamentary Commission of 1995 (also known as the Rapport Gest-Guyard), appeared on 22 December 1995. It remains to one of the few official attempts in the world to categorize various movements according to the potential threat they may present. =Criticisms=Controversies on the criteria and sources The criteria chosen by the Renseignements g√©n√©raux to establish the dangerousness of a movement were criticized, because they are considered as vague and may include many organizations, religious or not. One of the first criticism came from Bishop Jean Vernette, the national secretary of the French episcopate to the study of cults and new religious movements, which stressed that these criteria can be applied to almost all religions. Moreover, sociologists like Bruno √âtienne emphasized that the mental manipulation should not be defined by the policemen of the Renseignements g√©n√©raux.Bruno √âtienne, Les sectes en France, Hachette litt√©ratures, 2002, page 213 The list of cults was based on the criteria defined by the Renseignements g√©n√©raux, but without specifying which of their practices are specifically criticized.The New Heretics of France: Minority Religions, la Republique, and the Government-Sponsored \\"War on Sects\\" Susan J. Palmer 2011 In addition, the secrecy of the work made by the RG led to questions about the presence or absence of certain organizations in the list. Bruno √âtienne questioned on the presence of the CEDIPAC SA company, formerly known as European Grouping of Marketing Professionals (GEPM), while its activity is not in the religious field.Bruno √âtienne, Les sectes en France, Hachette litt√©ratures, 2002, page 224 The absence of Opus Dei or the Freemasons also raised questions.Bruno √âtienne, Les sectes en France, Hachette litt√©ratures, 2002, page 182 In addition, Yves Bertrand, General Director of the Renseignements g√©n√©raux from 1992 to 2003, spoke in 2007 about his collaborative work with the parliamentary reports on cults, and believed that Scientology and Jehovah's Witnesses do not deserve to be diabolized and \\"to put on the same level some companies of thought and genuine cultic movements that alienate the freedom of their members, the result is the opposite of the desired goals\\". Controversies on the file's content Some movements have sought access to documents that led to their classification onto the list of cults by the parliamentary commission. The State refused, invoking the risk to public safety and security of the State in case of disclosure of information from Renseignements g√©n√©raux. Several movements engaged in legal proceedings that lasted several years before they can access these secret documents. The Association of Jehovah's Witnesses finally succeeded in 2006, after the request was filed to the Council of State. The first judgments on this issue were given in 2005 by the Administrative Court of Appeal of Paris after examining the documents to assess the merits of the refusal of the Ministry of Interior, who mentioned the risk to public safety. On 3 July 2006, the Council of State rejected the appeal of the Minister of Interior and confirmed the same day the annulment of the decision of the Minister of Interior who refused to provide to the Christian Federation of Jehovah's Witnesses the documents made by the Renseignements g√©n√©raux for the second report. On 18 December 2006, at a press conference in Paris, Jehovah's Witnesses released the files prepared by the Renseignements g√©n√©raux for the commission on cults in 1995. According to Le Monde, this work, \\"which was released after eight years of proceedings, only includes a form of presentation and a list their places of worship.\\"Le Monde, 20 December 2006, p. 14; Le Figaro, 19 December 2006, p. 12 The Church of Scientology obtained access to documents of the Renseignements g√©n√©raux, and its spokesman said: \\"There was nothing in the files.\\" The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God also obtained the right of access to the file made by the Renseignements G√©n√©raux which justified its classification as cults in the parliamentary report. In a decision of 1 December 2005 validated by the Council of State, the Administrative Court of Appeal in Paris overturned the refusal of the Minister of Interior to grant the request of the association and ordered the files release. Lack of opposing debate The parliamentary report was strongly criticized by U.S. officials. In 1999, a report on religious freedom around the world conducted by the State Department accused it of not having heard from the groups accused and the lack of opposing debate.Nathalie Luca, Les sectes, Que sais-je, p. 102 The French branch of Tradition, Family Property complained about the impossibility of rectifying the report, saying: \\"The list established in the Report (...) contained similar unfair qualifications to certain groups falsely pinned as cults, with all appalling consequences for their members and their activities, the list being widely published in the media. But none of them had been heard. No one could get any rehabilitation or a new decision because no authority is recognized qualified to take over the case. The thing is serious in a State of law and there is concern that it may renew itself by other means.\\" Raffarin's circulaire, 2005 On 27 May 2005 (just before he left office), the then Prime Minister of France, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, issued a circulaire which stressed that the government must exercise vigilance in taking account of the evolution of the cult-phenomenon, which (he wrote) made the list of movements attached to the Parliamentary Report of 1995 less and less pertinent, based on the observation that small groups form in a scattered, more mobile and less-easily identifiable manner, making use in particular of the possibilities of spreading offered by the Internet (see: Cybersectarianism). The Prime Minister asked his civil servants to update a number of instructions issued previously, to apply criteria set in consultation with the Interministerial Commission for Monitoring and Combating Cultic Deviances (MIVILUDES), and to avoid falling back on lists of groups for the identification of cultic deviances. http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000809117&dateTexte;=&categorieLien;=id Circulaire du 27 mai 2005 relative √† la lutte contre les d√©rives sectaires (Circulaire of 27 May 2005 concerning the struggle against cultic manifestations).

Several groups previously omitted in the 1995 report were added (AMORC, Anthroposophy, At the Heart of the Communication, Prima Verba, Energo-Chromo- Kinese). The report said that the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Scientology were the richest \\"cults\\", whose annual budget reached respectively 200,000,000 and 60,000,000 FF (about 30,500,000 ‚Ç¨ and 9,147,000 ‚Ç¨). S≈çka Gakkai, Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, Sukyo Mahikari, New Apostolic Church, Unification Church, Dianova, Association of the Triumphant Vajra (Mandarom) and Anthroposophy had an annual income between 20 and 50,000,000 FF (approximately between 3,000,000 ‚Ç¨7,600,000 ‚Ç¨). =Controversy about Anthroposophy= The publication of this report provoked strong reactions; however, the Union des associations m√©dicales anthroposophiques de France, the Soci√©t√© financi√®re de la NEF and the F√©d√©ration des √âcoles Steiner, owned by Anthroposophy, attempted legal action. After presenting the report on France 2, a complaint for defamation was filed against the president of the parliamentary commission Jacques Guyard. The Tribunal de grande instance de Paris said that Guyard was \\"unable to justify of a serious investigation\\" to support his allegations, that he \\"repeatedly referred to \\"secret\\" nature of the work of the commission\\", and that \\"the contradictory nature of the investigation conducted just consisted of sending a questionnaire to sixty movements considered as cultic.\\"\\"Jacques Guyard condamn√© pour avoir qualifi√© le mouvement anthroposophe de secte\\", Le Monde, 23 March 2000 In addition, \\"the judges felt that the injury of plaintiffs was \\"important (...) since the defamatory statements were made by a deputy president of the commission, whose authority and competence could not have been doubted by the public\\". In September 2001, the Cour d'Appel de Paris maintained this conclusion but Jacques Guyard obtained his discharge on the ground of good faith.  Third- party comments, 2000  The 2000 annual report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the U.S. Department of State, stated: > The ensuing publicity [by the release of a parliamentary report against > \\"sectes\\" contributed to an atmosphere of intolerance and bias against > minority religions. Some religious groups reported that their members > suffered increased intolerance after having been identified on the list.  Third-party comments, 2004  In its 2004 annual report, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom stated: > [...] official government initiatives and activities that targets \\"sects\\" or > \\"cults\\" have fueled an atmosphere of intolerance toward members of minority > religions in France. [...] These initiatives [the publication of reports > characterizing specific groups as dangerous and the creating of agencies to > monitor and fight these groups] are particularly troubling because they are > serving as models for countries in Eastern Europe where the rule of law and > other human rights are much weaker than in France. The 2004 report concluded with an assessment that the restructuring of the main French agency concerned with this issue (referring to the new MIVILUDES replacing its predecessor, the Mission Interminist√©rielle pour la Lutte contre les Sectes [Interministerial Commission to Combat the Cults] (MILS)), had reportedly improved religious freedoms in France. United States Commission on International Religious Freedom  Commission of 2006  In a press-release dated 28 June 2006, several deputies from the Socialist Party, from the UDF, and others, stated that \\"certain people had believed that they could celebrate a so-called turning-point in the French policy of defending individual and collective liberties against the dangerous conduct of cults and a renewed questioning of the parliamentary reports of 1995 and 1999, as a result of the appearance of the Prime Minister's circulaire.\\" A cette occasion, certains ont cru pouvoir se r√©jouir d'un soi-disant tournant dans la politique fran√ßaise de d√©fense des libert√©s individuelles et collectives contre les men√©es dangereuses des sectes et d'une remise en cause des rapports parlementaires de 1995 et en 1999. - \\"La R√©publique, c'est la libert√©, de penser et de croire\\", press-release of 28 June 2006. http://www.depute- brard.org/documents/1315-005.doc Page 1.

Keighley was born in Nice, France. His family had business interests in Bradford, West Yorkshire and New South Wales. He was educated at the Tudor House preparatory school in New South Wales, Eton and Trinity College, Oxford. He received private coaching from the Yorkshire and England cricketer Herbert Sutcliffe (who was a friend of his mother's from Bradford). He captained the Eton XI, before going up to Oxford. After being called up by the Royal Air Force (RAF), he was trained as a navigator, but never flew on operations. Upon returning to Oxford, he was awarded a blue. As a stylish right-handed batsman, he scored 105 versus South Africa in his second match, and 99 versus Cambridge University in 1947. His highest innings was 110 versus Surrey at Headingley in 1951. He held the second wicket partnership of 226 (with Tony Pawson) for Varsity matches. In 1947, he became the thirty first non-native cricketer to represent Yorkshire, although at the time the club did not know that he had been born abroad. Keighley declined the captaincy of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Middlesex and Yorkshire. He played as an amateur in 65 first-class matches, before his retirement in 1951. He scored 2,539 runs, with two centuries, at an average of 27.01. He bowled occasional right-arm medium pace but did not take a wicket. He was admitted to the Inner Temple as a barrister and he married the Honourable Olivia Lubbock (a sister of the 4th Baron Avebury) at St George's Church, Hanover Square in London on 10 May 1951.

Physically, these represent the paths of (usually ideal) particles with no proper acceleration, their motion satisfying the geodesic equations. Because the particles are subject to no proper acceleration, the geodesics generally represent the straightest path between two points in a curved spacetime. The geodesic equation On an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold M, the geodesic equation written in a coordinate chart with coordinates x^a is: :\\\\frac{d^2x^a}{ds^2} + \\\\Gamma^{a}_{bc}\\\\frac{dx^b}{ds}\\\\frac{dx^c}{ds} = 0 where the coordinates xa(s) are regarded as the coordinates of a curve Œ≥(s) in M and \\\\Gamma^{a}_{bc} are the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols are functions of the metric and are given by: : \\\\Gamma^a_{bc} = \\\\frac{1}{2} g^{ad} \\\\left( g_{cd,b} + g_{bd,c} - g_{bc,d} \\\\right) where the comma indicates a partial derivative with respect to the coordinates: : g_{ab,c} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial {g_{ab}}}{\\\\partial {x^c}} As the manifold has dimension n, the geodesic equations are a system of n ordinary differential equations for the n coordinate variables. Thus, allied with initial conditions, the system can, according to the Picard-Lindel√∂f theorem, be solved. One can also use a Lagrangian approach to the problem: defining : L = \\\\sqrt{ g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\frac{d x^{\\\\mu}}{d s} \\\\frac{d x^{ u}}{d s} } and applying the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation. Heuristics As the laws of physics can be written in any coordinate system, it is convenient to choose one that simplifies the geodesic equations. Mathematically, this means a coordinate chart is chosen in which the geodesic equations have a particularly tractable form. Effective potentials When the geodesic equations can be separated into terms containing only an undifferentiated variable and terms containing only its derivative, the former may be consolidated into an effective potential dependent only on position. In this case, many of the heuristic methods of analysing energy diagrams apply, in particular the location of turning points. Solution techniques Solving the geodesic equations means obtaining an exact solution, possibly even the general solution, of the geodesic equations. Most attacks secretly employ the point symmetry group of the system of geodesic equations. This often yields a result giving a family of solutions implicitly, but in many examples does yield the general solution in explicit form. In general relativity, to obtain timelike geodesics it is often simplest to start from the spacetime metric, after dividing by ds^2 to obtain the form :-1 = g_{\\\\mu u}\\\\dot{x}^\\\\mu\\\\dot{x}^ u where the dot represents differentiation with respect to s. Because timelike geodesics are maximal, one may apply the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equation directly, and thus obtain a set of equations equivalent to the geodesic equations. This method has the advantage of bypassing a tedious calculation of Christoffel symbols.

They ended on November 30, of each year. These dates conventionally delimit the time of year when most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data on east Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable. For a few years, there are no reported cyclones, although many systems certainly formed. 1900 A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed south of southwestern mainland Mexico on July 19, and moved generally westward out into the tropical Pacific, last noted well west-southwest of Baja California on July 29. 1901 A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed south of southern Mexico on July 19, moving west-northwest through July 27, when it was last seen west of Baja California. 1902 I. Forming on July 14, a tropical cyclone made landfall on the southern portion of Baja California on July 22 as it moved northward and dissipated. The remnants produced 1 to 2 inches (25 to 50 mm) of rain over southern California on July 20 and 21. This storm occurred during the strong El Ni√±o of 1901-1902\\\\. II. On August 29, a \\"tropical hurricane\\" was noted between mainland Mexico and Hawaii. The cyclone moved north of due west, last seen about east-southeast of Hilo on September 1. III. Between September 18 and 20, a \\"tropical hurricane\\" moved just offshore the west coast of Baja California. IV. A tropical depression formed on October 3. It moved north. After crossing the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, it emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. It eventually became Atlantic Hurricane 4 before making landfall in the Florida Panhandle as a tropical storm. V. On October 17, a \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed just east of the International Dateline, moving westward through the 20th, before looping back towards the east on October 21 and 22. VI. On December 23, a storm formed 40 miles (60 km) to the southwest of Lanai, Hawaii. Possibly a Kona, or Subtropical storm, it moved northwestward and strengthened. After approaching the International Date Line, it turned to the northeast, and dissipated in the Bering Sea on January 2, 1903. It is unknown if the storm was tropical, but based on its track it had some tropical characteristics. Upon moving through the Hawaiian islands, the storm was disorganized, and caused no reported damage or unusual weather on the islands. The storm is known as the Froc Cyclone, named after Rev. Louis Froc, the Director of the Ziwakei Observatory in Shanghai who discovered the storm. 1903 I. A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed near the 170th meridian west longitude on September 7, moving northward past Wake Island into the far north Pacific on September 11. II. A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed between Mexico and Hawaii on September 24, moving slightly north of due west. The system dissipated about southeast of Hilo on September 29. 1904 I. A tropical storm was first observed 250 miles (400 km) southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, on November 26. It tracked to the northwest, then turned to the northeast. The storm weakened over the cold northern Pacific waters, and dissipated on December 4 to the south of Sitka, Alaska. The storm caused no reported damage. This storm is known as the Zikawei Cyclone, named after the Zikawei Observatory which recorded the storm. II. On December 23 a tropical storm formed south-southwest of South Point, Hawaii. It moved to the west-northwest, and after crossing the date line it turned to the northeast, dissipating on the 30th. The storm is known as the Hurd Cyclone. 1905 A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed offshore southwestern Mexico on June 29, which made a partial loop on June 30 and July 1 before turning eastward, dissipating south of Mexico on July 3. 1906 I. The Gauthier Cyclone formed on 3 May well southeast of the Big Island and moved west-northwestward. It passed to the south of Hawaii, crossed the date line, and turned to the northeast. The storm dissipated in the Bering Sea on 10 May. This extremely rare May central Pacific tropical cyclone occurred during the normally storm-free month of May. II. A tropical storm formed just off Acapulco circa 11 August and moved north- northwestward through the Gulf of California. It entered southern California on 18 August, dropping of rain at Needles, California, in 24 hours. III. A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed offshore southwestern Mexico on 23 September, moving north-northwestward to just offshore the southwest tip of Baja California on 28/29 September before dissipating. IV. On 2 October, a \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed offshore southern Mexico. The system moved initially westward and then northward towards Manzanillo on 4 October. The storm ultimately traveled just west of Baja California and reached Ensenada, Baja California, on 10 October before dissipating without significant effect in California. V. On 2 October, a tropical storm was first observed southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. It moved to the northeast and struck the southern tip of Niihau before turning northward. After passing through the islands, it turned to the northeast, and dissipated in the Bering Sea on 9 October. The storm, the Makawao Cyclone, caused of torrential rainfall in Makawao, Hawaii. VI. A tropical storm was first observed on 6 November south of Honolulu, Hawaii. It moved to the north-northwest and passed through the Kauai channel. It turned to the northeast and dissipated on the 13 November to the west of British Columbia. This extremely small, disorganized storm caused no known damage in Hawaii. 1907 I. A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed between Mexico and Hawaii on 15 July. The system moved west-northwest, dissipating about east of Hilo on 18 July. II. A \\"tropical hurricane\\" formed between Mexico and Hawaii, well southeast of the previous system, on 18 July. This system moved north of due west, dissipating about east of Hilo on 22 July. 1908 A vortex, possibly a tropical cyclone, was first observed on 17 October to the northwest of Hawaii. It moved quickly northeastward, and dissipated the next day. 1909 There are no known tropical cyclones.

Its large size, its central location and its affiliation with the city hall make it a popular venue for a variety of events, celebrations and demonstrations. It is often used as a central point for measuring distances from Copenhagen. City Hall Square is located at the southwestern end of the pedestrian street Str√∏get which connects it to Kongens Nytorv, the other large square of the city centre, passing Gammeltorv/Nytorv and Amagertorv along the way. Opposite Str√∏get, Vesterbrogade extends into the Vesterbro district and later crosses the border to Frederiksberg. H. C. Andersens Boulevard, Copenhagen's most heavily congested street, and Vester Voldgade pass the square on either side of the city hall. Apart from the City Hall, notable buildings around the square include Politikens Hus, the headquarters of national daily newspaper Politiken, and Industriens Hus, the headquarters of the DI. History=Hay market and exhibition area= C. W. Eckersberg City Hall Square is located at the site of Copenhagen's old hay market and the Western City Gate with surrounding fortifications. When the fortifications were disbanded in the 1850s, it was decided to use the vacant land for an exhibition area which played host to first the Nordic Exhibition of 1872 and later the Nordic Exhibition of 1888. View east along tram tracks toward Str√∏get in 1970. Vilhelm Klein designed an exhibition building for the first exhibition which was built at the corner of Vesterbro Passage which was built from 1870 to 1872. The four-winged, two-storey building was built in red brick to a design which was inspired by Italian Renaissance architecture. In 1879 the centre of the complex was re-built into a large domed exhibition hall. Nyrop's domed exhibition building from 1889 On 1 January 1888 the hay market moved to a new location outside K√∏dbyen, the new cattle and meat market which had opened in 1878. The site is still named Halmtorvet after it. The main venue of the Nordic Exhibition of 1888 was a large timber structure topped by a huge dome with a flag pole at its top. Its architect was the young and unknown Martin Nyrop who was later also to design the new city hall. Aerial view of the square at night, 2008 =The new city hall and its square= In the 1880s, plans were conceived to build a new city hall on the grounds, and in 1888, the expo area was cleared. An architecture competition was held in early 1889. Apart from Nyrop, who won the competition, Vilhelm Dahlerup and Valdemar Koch were among the participating architects. The design of the city hall was greatly inspired by the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, Italy, and the design of the square was accordingly modeled on the shell-shaped Piazza del Campo outside that building. On 28 July 1894, the foundation stone was laid. When it was inaugurated in 1905, the square in front of it became one of the most central and important spaces of the city. The square was redesigned in 1995 and 1996 by KHR Architects, on the occasion of Copenhagen being the European Capital of Culture. The intersecting street leading from Vesterbrogade to Str√∏get was removed, uniting the two sides of the square. A bus hub was built on the northern side of the square. In 2010, work began on a metro station on the site, requiring a major reorganisation of the site, with work was opened on 29 September 2019.

Born in New York City in 1933, Sokolsky was raised on the Lower East Side. He had no formal training in photography, but started to use his father's box camera at about the age of ten. Always analytical, he started to realize the role that emulsion played as he compared his own photographs with those his father had kept in albums through the years. \\"I could never make my photographs of Butch the dog look like the pearly finish of my father's prints, and it was then that I realized the importance of the emulsion of the day.\\" Around 1954, Sokolsky met Robert Denning, who at the time worked with photographer Edgar de Evia, at an East Side gym. \\"I discovered that Edgar was paid $4000 for a Jell-O ad, and the idea of escaping from my tenement dwelling became an incredible dream and inspiration.

If completed, it will stand tall up to the antenna and would be the tallest freestanding tower in the Southern Hemisphere. In Kemayoran, Central Jakarta, work was initially started in 1997, but was halted by the Asian economic crisis. As of 2015, the project is still on hold. History The Suharto regime intended Jakarta Tower to be the tallest structure in the world. International architecture design firms were invited to propose designs for the structure. The design itself should represent Trilogi Pembangunan (government's national development philosophy), Pancasila (the national philosophy, which consists of five factors), and August 17 (Indonesia's independence day). The winning design was created by Murphi/Iohn from the United States. However, since the design was too costly to develop, the government opted the runner-up design by East China Architecture Design & Research Institute (ECADI), who created the Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower in China. The development of the tower was initially developed by Sudwikatmono, Prajogo Pangestu and Henry Pribadi, operated by the company, PT Indocitra Graha Bawana. Its cost was estimated around US$400 million (at that time, around Rp 900 billion). Originally, the Jakarta Tower was to be built in the Kuningan area, but Soerjadi Soedirdja, the Governor of Special Capital District of Jakarta at that time, did not agree, and proposed to build it in the Kemayoran area that was still underdeveloped. Design companies of international calibre architecture were invited to participate in the design contest of architecture for this building. The provisions of this contest were that this building must contain the symbol of the Trilogy of the Development, Pancasila (the five basic Principles of Republic of Indonesia) and on August 17 (the Republic of Indonesia independence day declaration). The design and the scale model of the tower were shown to the Secretary of State, Moerdiono (at that time) as Chairman of Organizer Agency and the Development of the Bandar Kemayoran Baru in the Secretariat of the Country. In 1996, this contest was won by Murphi/Jahn from the United States. Only, because this design was too expensive to be developed, then the government chose the design from the second winner namely East China Architecture Design & Research Institute (ECADI), that also constructive Shanghai Oriental Pearl Tower in China. This ECADI design was chosen because the juries considered this design was simple and still had nuances of Asia. The appointment of the development was carried out in 1997 by Jakarta Governor, Soerjadi Soedirdja and Secretary of State, Moerdiono after being agreed to by President Soeharto at the President's Executive Office in Jakarta. President Soeharto proposed that the name \\"Jakarta Tower\\" be replaced by \\"Trilogy Tower\\". Tower construction began in 1997. As costs mounted, the developer sought funds from foreign investors. The total fund that was needed to around US$560m (around Rp 1.2 trillion). =Economic crisis (1997)= When an economic crisis hit Asia in 1997, the Indonesian property industry fell and plenty of construction projects were either postponed or cancelled, including the Trilogy Tower. By stopping the development of this tower, the site was abandoned and became a wide puddle. =Continuation of the Jakarta Tower project (2003-present)= After the Indonesian economy began to rise again, the government of Jakarta continued the development of this tower and returned its name back to Jakarta Tower. The Jakarta Tower then was continued in 2003 went through a new consortium, namely PT Persada Japa Pamudja (PJP) that consisted of national rich businessmen. The appointment of the development of the tower that was projected to the highest tower in the world was carried out by the Minister of the State Secretariat (the Secretary of State) Bambang Kesowo and Special Capital District of Jakarta Governor Sutiyoso on April 15, 2004. On October 2010, Wiratman Wangsadinata, Jakarta Tower's consultant and designer, officially announced that Jakarta Tower's construction had been suspended due to lack of finance. In July 2015, one of the largest developers in Indonesia began to marketing about 6 condominiums, 1 grade A office tower and 1 prestigious mall in town, and might remark the project as cancelled. Structure of the tower The Jakarta Tower will be built in an area measuring 306,810 square meters. The building itself would measure 40,550 square meters and 558 meter high, surpassing Q1 (344m) in Australia to become the tallest building in the southern hemisphere. The Jakarta tower will be taller than any currently completed free-standing structure and more than four times taller than the Monas (Jakarta National Monument, 137 m). Like the initial 1997 design, the new development calls for the tower to have three cylindrical legs, 13.2 m in diameter, that will rise up 500 m. Two of the legs will have three elevators each, travelling 7 m per second. The third leg will contain eight elevators, dedicated for visitors. The tower will include a , concrete ring, and will be embedded with an 80 m diameter foundation driven to 58 m into the ground. According to the developer, the Jakarta Tower will use more than 20,000 workers for the development and more than 40,000 manpower after the building is in full operation. =Facilities= The Jakarta Tower plans to supply these facilities: ‚Ä¢ 144,000 square meter parking lot ‚Ä¢ 17-floor high podium building ‚Ä¢ elevator can reach to the tower top ‚Ä¢ rotating restaurant ‚Ä¢ mega mall ‚Ä¢ caf√© ‚Ä¢ amusement park ‚Ä¢ Indonesian historical museum ‚Ä¢ hotel ‚Ä¢ condominium ‚Ä¢ multipurpose/conference room that could accommodate 10,000 visitors ‚Ä¢ 8,000 square meter office space ‚Ä¢ exhibition center ‚Ä¢ education and training center ‚Ä¢ center of multimedia that accompanied the transmitter television and the radio broadcast ‚Ä¢ business trading center ‚Ä¢ sport center A total of 4-6 million estimated visitors each year will come to the Jakarta Tower. =Expenses= The expense of developing this mega project is estimated to be around Rp 1.4 trillion initially and increased to almost Rp 2.7 trillion after the steel price increase in the world. According to the director PT Prasada Japa Pamudja, Ferry Sangeroki, parties that involved in this project are \\"more than 100 companies and individuals \\". He said that this project is financed through three routes: #capital participation (Rp 400 billion), #the loan of syndication (Rp 600-800 billion), and #he pre-project sale (around Rp 1.3 trillion). Controversies=Social and economy imbalance= In the year 1995-1997, the Trilogy Tower became the criticism material especially being the fund as well as the function of this tower in the middle of the social and economy imbalance that still spread out. Theo Syafei, the former Territorial Military Commander, said, \\"Better the fund as big as that was used for the development of the \\"East Indonesian region.\\" Therefore, this tower began to be known also with the term of \\"Imbalance Tower\\"(\\"menara kesenjangan\\"). The Jakarta Post newspaper calls it as \\"tower of indifference\\". Several People's Representative Council members called it as the \\"lighthouse\\" project, a naming towards projects in the period of President Sukarno that it was considered (especially by the supporter of the New Sociopolitical System) as the project to show off to the outside world, without the obvious benefit for the people. Sudwikatmono as the owner of this project in that period, denied this tower was acknowledged as the lighthouse project. The reason is, unlike Monas which was built by the government, the Trilogy Tower was purely built by private enterprise. Secretary of State Moerdiono respond to concerning the social gap that the irony with this project only explained the technical benefit for the world of architecture, the construction and the world of the broadcasting of radio and television. The plan is, the sprout of the tower will indeed be mounted radio and television antenna. =Bethany Church= During the period of the current development (2006‚Äì2011), one of the controversy that enough to come to the forefront about the Jakarta Tower is that this tower will become Christian Center that is supported by the Church of Bethany Indonesia. Regarding to Abraham Alex Tanusaputra, the President Commissioner of this project developer, PT Prasada Japa Pamudja that is also the General Chairman of Indonesia Bethany Church Congress. Moreover, Bethany's group often acknowledged this project as the Jakarta Prayer Tower or Jakarta Revival Center.

He currently serves as CEO of the non-profit Empower Schools, Chairman of the Board of the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education and part-time Lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Early life Chris Gabrieli was born in Buffalo, New York on February 5th, 1960 and graduated with an A.B. in 1981 from Harvard College.. He also attended two years of the Columbia College of Physicians & Surgeons before leaving to co-found a healthcare software company. His parents were both immigrants and his brother is John Gabrieli, PhD, a Professor of Brain and Cognitive Scientists at MIT with whom he has collaborated on research in education in recent years Career Chris Gabrieli began his first career in entrepreneurship as the co-founder of and CEO of a healthcare informatics company called GMIS which was eventually purchased by industry leader McKesson HBO where its products continue to be sold and used. Gabrieli spent the majority of his business career with Bessemer Venture Partners where he started as an associate in 1986 and made his way to Partner in 18 months. As Partner he led the life sciences practice for nearly twenty years, investing in over fifty healthcare and biotechnology companies. He was twice named to Forbes list of the top 100 venture capitalists in America. In 2000, he left Bessemer to focus on education policy and innovation but remained affiliated as Partner Emeritus with the firm until 2015 when he fully retired. Gabrieli began his second career in education policy and innovation when he was selected in 1999 by then Boston Mayor Thomas Menino to Chair of a Task Force on After School in Boston which led to major expansion and field building of the after school domain in Boston. He went on to co-found Massachusetts 2020 and the National Center on Time & Learning which helped define and expand the field of expanded learning time (ELT) for schooling in America. In 2008 he authored (with co-author Warren Goldstein) the book Time to Learn: How a New School Schedule is Making Smarter Kids, Happier Parents and Safer Neighborhoods, published by Jossey- Bass. He continues to write research and policy articles and opinion pieces on education policy and issues in various publications. In 2011, Gabrieli co- founded Empower Schools, a new nonprofit focused on empowering district school educators to make the key decisions that drive the success of their schools. As part of that effort, he helped design and launch and became the Chairman of the Board of the Springfield Empowerment Zone Partnership, a unique partnership among the state‚Äôs Department of Elementary & Secondary Education and Springfield Public Schools and the Springfield Education Association aimed at accelerating success for over 5,000 of Springfield‚Äôs students. That work led to what is now 14 Empowerment Zones in five states (MA, CO, TX, IN and MO) and a burgeoning field of district-partnered schools and zones of schools. In 2015, Chris Gabrieli was selected by Governor Charlie Baker for Chairman of the Board of the Massachusetts Department of Higher Education. His tenure has included the launch of Massachusetts‚Äô Early College Initiative which has grown to include 23 partnerships of high schools and colleges approved by the state to offer well structured and supported opportunities to gain significant amounts of college success and credit while still in high school. As of 2020, these partnerships serve an estimated 3,500 students, the large majority of whom are Black or Latinx, the majority of whom are low-income and many of whom are first generation college goers. He is also a part-time lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education where he has taught for a decade, focusing on the political science of education policy change in America. Political Experience Gabrieli became involved in politics and in 2002, he won the Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor but the overall ticket lost to Mitt Romney in the general election. In 2006 he ran for Governor of Massachusetts, coming in second place in the gubernatorial primary behind eventual winner Deval Patrick. Patrick subsequently appointed him Chair of the Finance Control Board of Springfield, MA which resulted in the sustained fiscal recovery of Springfield following the completion of its role in 2010.

Founded in 1974 by tennis player Billie Jean King and initially supported by Olympic athletes Donna de Varona and Suzy Chaffee, its stated mission statement is \\"To advance the lives of girls and women through sports and physical activity.\\"About Us - Women's Sports Foundation History The Women's Sports Foundation was legally set up in 1974 by Billie Jean King, her business manager Jim Jorgensen, and her then- husband Larry King. The Foundation was originally supported by Olympic medalist Donna de Varona and Olympic skier Suzy Chaffee. In 1972 and in 1973 Billie Jean was awarded the Bob Hope Calvalcade of Sports for the \\"Outstanding Female Athlete of the Year\\". In 1974, she donated her winnings of $5,000 to incorporate the Women's Sports Foundation. Simultaneously, she started a new magazine titled womenSports. The WSF began its multi-sport emphasis at the 1975 ABC TV show Women‚Äôs Superstars which was held at the Houston Astrodome. It was there that Donna de Varona working as an ABC Billie Jean King invited the women athlete contestants to join in on the effort. For ten years, from 1976 to 1986, under the direction of Executive Director, Eva Auchincloss and Associate Director Holly Turner and the Chairwoman Billie Jean King, the Board of Trustees was expanded to include Olympian Peggy Fleming, Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz, and Vice-President of Bristol-Myers Marvin Koslow, David Foster, CEO of Colgate Palmolive. In 1979, Donna de Varona was appointed the first president of the Foundation. Under the leadership of Executive Director Eva Auchincloss and her team, the foundation grew from an organization with $500 in the bank to one with a $1M endowment and an operating budget of $1M. In 1990, in recognition of Billie Jean's long standing efforts to promote the rights of women, Life magazine named King one of the \\"100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century\\",[5] in part because of her promotion of sports for women such as the Women's Sports Foundation. Women's Sports Foundation advocates equal opportunity for girls and women's sports in the United States and around the world. Past presidents include Donna de Varona, Carol Mann, Lyn St. James, Nancy Hogshead-Makar, Wendy Hilliard, Benita Fitzgerald Mosley, Nancy Lieberman, Julie Foudy, Dawn Riley, Dominique Dawes, Aimee Mullins, Jessica Mendoza, Laila Ali, Angela Ruggiero, and Angela Hucles.

Through education, public awareness and grants to organizations nationwide, Sports 4 Life seeks to effect sustainable improvement to the overall health and development of girls in these communities. The Travel & Training Fund: The Women's Sports Foundation (WSF) was the first ‚Äî and only ‚Äî charitable organization to offer grants to aspiring women athletes with elite potential when it established the grant almost 30 years ago. The Travel & Training Fund provides direct financial assistance to aspiring athletes ‚Äì in individual and team sports. Travel & Training grants allow serious female athletes a chance to fulfill their potential on the regional, national or international level through assistance for coaching, specialized training, equipment, athletic attire, and/or travel. Since 1984, WSF awarded grants to more than 1300 individual athletes and teams ‚Äì including figure skaters Michelle Kwan and Rachael Flatt, diver Mary Ellen Clark, ski jumper Alissa Johnson, swimmer Mallory Weggemann and the US National Water Polo Team. The T&T; Fund is supported by contributions by donors and WSF national sponsor Gatorade. GoGirlGo!: The Women‚Äôs Sports Foundation‚Äôs GoGirlGo! works across the country to improve the health of sedentary girls and to keep girls involved in physical activity. We get girls moving not through direct service, but by supporting programs and organizations that work with girls. GoGirlGo! identifies and weaves together quality resources within each community and provides comprehensive support through education, funding, public awareness and networking. It Takes A Team: Originally called The Project to Eliminate Homophobia in Sport, It Takes A Team! started in 1996, enabled by fundraising efforts by tennis legend, Martina Navratilova. The Project to Eliminate Homophobia in Sport was a collaborative effort among the Women‚Äôs Sports Foundation, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Gay and Lesbian Education Network, the Ms. Foundation, Uncommon Legacy and ASTRAEA. Under the leadership of Lisa Dawn Thompson, the project developed a comprehensive educational kit which was first released in 2002.

He is famous for his landscapes of Scotland and abroad, still-life, figure painting and interiors, but perhaps his best known works are his beach scenes and views of Venice. Life and work Morrocco was born in Aberdeen in 1917, the son of Domenic Antonio Marrocco and his wife, Celesta Crolla, immigrant Italians. His mother had come around 1890 and his father around 1914. His father had an ice cream shop in the city and the signwriter accidentally wrote the name as Morrocco and the name then stuck. He studied at Gray's School of Art under Robert Sivell between 1932 and 1938, and in France, Italy and Switzerland. He is famous for his landscape paintings of Scotland and abroad, still life, figure painting and interiors, but perhaps his best known works are his beach scenes and views of Venice. The avant-garde of the twenties and thirties, in particular Braque and Picasso, had an immense influence on him for the rest of his life. The outbreak of the Second World War saw him detained in Edinburgh Castle, as an enemy alien, but he was released and allowed to serve as a conscientious objector in the Royal Army Medical Corps. After the war Morrocco had a brief spell teaching evening classes. From 1950 onwards Morrocco spent his professional life in Dundee, as Head of the School of Painting at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art, which is now part of the University of Dundee. He produced murals for St. Columba's Church in Glenrothes and for Royal Dundee Liff Hospital in Dundee. Morrocco was prodigiously productive. He had a spectacular retirement, producing some of his most vigorous work in the period from 1982 to his death. Even late in his life and seriously ill, he would commit himself to exhibitions of thirty or forty new works in a year. Morrocco and his wife Vera Mercer had three children, Leon, Laurie and Annalisa. Leon followed in his fathers footsteps and became an established artist in his own right. Laurie is a conservator of early panel paintings and Annalisa a designer and illustrator. Alberto died at his home, Binrock House in Dundee, on 10 March 1998. Principal Works *Camilla Uytman (1956) *Colonel George Baxter of Invereighty (1956) *John Cameron, Lord Cameron (1974) Awards The University of Dundee awarded Morrocco an honorary doctorate in 1980. He painted portraits of all its Principals and, in 1977, the Queen Mother as Chancellor. He was awarded the San Vita Romano Prize and both the Guthrie Award and the Carnegie Award of the Royal Scottish Academy, where he was elected Fellow in 1962. In addition to the degree from Dundee University, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Stirling in 1987. He served on the Scottish Arts Council and the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland and was appointed OBE in 1993. Morrocco was a member of the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts (RGI) and the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour (RSW).

An organization's structure refers to the nature of the distribution of the units and positions within it, also to the nature of the relationships among those units and positions. Tall and flat organizations differ based on how many levels of management are present in the organization, and how much control managers are endowed with. Transforming a highly hierarchical organization into a flat organization is known as delayering.  Organizational structure  In flat organizations, the number of people directly supervised by each manager is large, and the number of people in the chain of command above one is small. A manager in a flat organization possesses more responsibility than a manager in a tall organization because there is a greater number of individuals immediately below who are dependent on direction, help, and support. Moreover, managers in a flat organization rely less on guidance from superiors because the number of superiors above the manager is limited.  Benefits  Empirical evidence from Ghiselli and Johnson suggests that the amount of independence managers in flat organizations possess as a result of the flat organizational structure satisfies many of their needs in terms of autonomy and self-realization. The idea behind flat organizations is that well-trained workers will be more productive when they are more directly involved in the decision making process, rather than closely supervised by many layers of management. This structure is generally possible only in smaller organizations or individual units within larger organizations. Having reached a critical size, organizations can retain a streamlined structure but cannot keep a completely flat manager-to-staff relationship without impacting productivity. Certain financial responsibilities may also require a more conventional structure. A company would not have to give a raise or promotion, based on service length but on greater productivity. Also eliminating certain departments from the payroll means saving money. Some companies theorize that flat organizations become more traditionally hierarchical when they begin to be geared towards productivity. The flat organization model promotes employee involvement through a decentralized decision-making process. By elevating the level of responsibility of baseline employees and eliminating layers of middle management, comments and feedback reach all personnel involved in decisions more quickly. Expected response to customer feedback becomes more rapid. Self-managing teams A \\"strong form\\" of flat organization is an organization with no middle management at all. Very small businesses may lack middle managers because there are too few staff to justify hiring middle managers; in this type of organization, the business owner or the CEO may perform some of the functions performed by middle managers in larger organizations. However, some organizations do not take on middle managers even as they become larger, and remain extremely flat. An organization which has self-managing teams, that organize their own work without the need for a middle manager or supervisor above the team, may meet or closely approximate this model. Although, a manager in self-managing teams determines the overall purpose or goal of the team, but the team is at liberty to manage the methods by which to achieve that goal. This can cause conflict with people whose career path expectations include a promotion, which may not be available within the organization due to its flat structure. However, alternative \\"horizontal\\" career paths may be available, such as developing greater expertise in a role or mastery of a craft, and/or receiving pay raises for loyalty. An absence of middle managers does not preclude the adoption and retention of mandatory work procedures, including quality assurance procedures. However, due to the fact that significant responsibilities are given to the team members themselves, if a team collectively arrives at the view that the procedures it is following are outdated, or could be improved, it may be able to change them. Such changes may, in some cases, require the approval of executive management, and/or customers (consider for example a digital agency producing bespoke websites for corporate clients). If executive management is not involved in the decision, or merely rubber-stamps it, this might be an example of consensus decision-making or workplace democracy at the level of a team - or group of teams, if multiple teams are involved in the decision. The foremost example of a company with self-managing teams is Valve, which also has rotating, not permanent, team leaders - which Valve terms \\"group contributors\\", in recognition of the fact that contributing individually and leading at Valve form a spectrum, not a binary dichotomy. Generally the term of a group contributor at Valve is at most one project, after which time they (voluntarily) rotate back to being an individual contributor. Valve also allows team members to work on whatever they find interesting. This is known as open allocation, and means that employees can switch to another team at any time, no questions asked; all desks are on wheels to make this easy. However, because new ideas may require significant resources, someone with a new idea may need to persuade a number of their coworkers to join them in order to create a new team and reach the necessary \\"critical mass\\" for the new idea to come to fruition. Valve's cofounder has admitted that it has issues with failing to catch bad decisions early on due to a lack of internal controls, due to its lack of managers. Prof. Cliff Oswick from Cass Business School, who has studied Valve and other examples of \\"non-leadership\\", believes that Valve works because it hires high-calibre people who are a good fit for the leaderless environment, and because it was founded as a flat organization from the outset, so that new hires always knew what they were getting into. However, he warns that the peer-review-based stack ranking system Valve uses for determining employee remuneration, might become problematic if in the future Valve becomes short of cash. Other examples of companies with self-managing teams include: * Qamcom Research and Technology, a Swedish specialist company with 125 employees active in the area of communication, radar and automotive systems (40% PhDs).https://www.qamcom.se/work * Reaktor, a Finnish software and design consultancy with 400 employees has a flat hierarchy and self-managing teams, and also shares all the relevant business numbers with all of their employees. * 37Signals, which has rotating, not permanent, team leaders. Some other digital agencies also use rotating team leads. * GitHub Inc., which, like Valve, uses open allocation. However, in response to criticism, GitHub introduced a layer of middle management in 2014. * Treehouse, which also uses open allocation. * The Morning Star Company, which has no supervising managers. * Marc Rich + Co., once the world's largest commodity group - Marc Rich + Co. utilized a flat management structure. =Related business concepts= In technology, agile development involves teams self-managing to a large extent (though agile development is commonly still practised within a hierarchical organization, which means that certain types of decisions such as hiring, firing, and pay rises remain the prerogative of managers). In scrum, an agile framework, team members assign work to be done among themselves, either by free choice or by consensus. The scrum master role in scrum is not a management role as such, but is a role that involves helping to remove obstacles to forward progress, and ensuring that the basic scrum framework is adhered to by all parties, inside and outside the team - both aspects of the role being more akin to facilitation than to top-down micromanagement. Agile frameworks such as scrum have also begun being used in non-technology companies and organizations.  Criticisms  Drawing on Jo Freeman's famous essay The Tyranny of Structurelessness, Klint Finley has argued that \\"bossless\\" companies like Valve might suffer from problems related to the appropriate handling of grievances, the formation of informal cliques, the \\"soft power\\" of popular employees, unprofessional and sexist attitudes, and lack of workplace diversity. However, some of these topics are the responsibility of human-resources departments in larger organizations, so it is possible that an effective HR department could resolve these issues within a flat organization. Suzanne Baker argues that new power dynamics can emerge that undermine the equality afforded by a non-hierarchical context. When an organization decides to no longer place value on a person's position, Baker suggests that new hierarchies based on personality type, skill set, and communication style can emerge. If these hierarchies don't get acknowledged, it is much more difficult to address the emergence of a new hierarchy because they remain implicit or undetected.Baker, Suzanne J. 2015. \\"Exploration of Equality and Processes of Non-Hierarchical Groups.\\" Journal of Organisational Transformation & Social Change 12, no. 2: 138-158. Business Source Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed November 3, 2015). Mark Henricks, a business journalist and a critic of flat organization, argues that \\"when you have too little hierarchy, decisions don't get made or are made wrongly by employees who lack experience, accountability, or motivation to do the work of the missing managers\\".Henricks, M. (2005). Falling Flat?. Entrepreneur, 33(1), 69-70. See also * Co-operative, in which organizational ownership is highly decentralised.

The development of Batavi started in 2007 inspired by a preliminary osCommerce 3.0 version, a version that seemed to be never finished by the osCommerce team. In Batavi, an Object oriented design model is adopted, and on a functional level XML-EDI integration with the systems of suppliers is a lead theme, as most merchants don't run 'standalone' webshops. This distinguishes Batavi also from other webshops like PrestaShop, Zen Cart and Magento. Batavi is developed on LAMP (software bundle), especially PHP and MySQL, and adopts a three layer model in which design objects, code and the database are strictly separated. From a designer perspective, this creates the advantage of easy manipulation of template objects, without the need of adapting code. Key Features (1.0 version) * Fully flexible template system, including pages/boxes groups layout and page access limitation * Full content management including menus, texts, mails, pages etc. * Robust architecture to process vast numbers of products, visitors, customers and orders * Customer/group specific pricing, payment or shipping modules * Related products for cross- and upselling * Unlimited product segmentation to present products * Product price rules for pricing vast numbers of products * Product group price rules to make selecting products easier for pricing purposes * Fully automated integration with product content providers: Open ICEcat interface available * Interface for multi warehouse and multi supplier (including stock and purchase prices) support * Possibilities to filter certain UNSPSC during import * Integration possibilities for Google Analytics * Integration possibilities with a number of payment providers (PayPal, iDeal, MrCash etc.) * Advanced batch price list import and order export & status feedback facilities (e.g. interfaces to ICEimport/ICEorder) * A big group of modules like: Product Tax Modules, Realtime modules, Order total modules, GeoIP modules, Coupons etc. * Automatic Brand pages * Standard Open Catalog Interface to Open ICEcat XML. History The Batavi development team was formed in 2007 together with ICEshop, an ecommerce service provider active since 1999. The name Batavi was chosen, as this refers to a partly mythical Germanic tribe which revolted against The (Roman) Empire, and whose living territory overlaps with the present-day Netherlands. It also refers to the Golden Age of The Republic of The Netherlands, in which Batavian myths were used for inspiration. The Batavi core team made use of an unfinished pre- release of osCommerce 3.0, and reworked it completely, and added the much needed high-end business-to-business functionalities that were already present in ICEshop's ecommerce solutions.

It describes the Second World War from the point of view of Nazi Germany‚Äôs leader Adolf Hitler. It was first published in April 1977 by Hodder & Stoughton and Viking Press. Avon Books reissued it in 1990. In 2002, Focal Point Publications published a revised illustrated edition, combined together with Irving's The War Path, as a 1024-page hardcover. Primary theses Hitler's War, the first published installment of his two-part biography of Adolf Hitler (the prequel The War Path was published in 1978), had originally been published in German as Hitler und seine Feldherren (Hitler and his Generals) in 1975.Lukacs, John (1997). The Hitler of History. p. 178. Irving's intention in Hitler's War was to clean away the \\"years of grime and discoloration from the facade of a silent and forbidding monument\\" to reveal the real Hitler, whose reputation Irving claimed had been slandered by historians.. In Hitler's War, Irving tried to \\"view the situation as far as possible through Hitler's eyes, from behind his desk\\". He portrayed Hitler as a rational, intelligent politician, whose only goal was to increase Germany's prosperity and influence on the continent, and who was constantly let down by incompetent and/or treasonous subordinates. Irving's book faulted the Allied leaders, most notably Winston Churchill, for the eventual escalation of war, and claimed that the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was a \\"preventive war\\" forced on Hitler to avert an alleged impending Soviet attack (supported by some, notably Soviet GRU defector Victor Suvorov, and others; see Icebreaker). Irving commented that in light of the \\"preventive war\\" that he felt Hitler was forced to wage, the Kommissarbefehl was merely something that Stalin forced on Hitler.Evans, Richard J (1989). In Hitler's Shadow. p. 166. He also claimed that Hitler had no knowledge of the Holocaust; while not outright denying its occurrence, Irving claimed that Heinrich Himmler and his deputy Reinhard Heydrich were its originators and architects. Irving made much of the lack of any written order from Hitler ordering the Holocaust, and for decades afterward offered to pay ¬£1000 to anyone who could find such an order.. In addition, citing the work of such historians as Harry Elmer Barnes, David Hoggan, and Frederick J. P. Veale, Irving argued that Britain was primarily responsible for the outbreak of war in 1939. In a footnote in Hitler's War, Irving first introduced the thesis later popularised in the 1980s by Ernst Nolte that a letter written by Chaim Weizmann to Neville Chamberlain on 3 September 1939, pledging the support of the Jewish Agency to the Allied war effort, constituted a \\"Jewish declaration of war\\" against Germany, thus justifying German \\"internment\\" of European Jews.. In 1975, when without Irving's permission the firm Ullstein- Verlag removed the passages claiming Hitler had no knowledge of the Holocaust from the German edition of Hitler's War, Irving sued Ullstein-Verlag. Despite his much-vaunted disdain for professional historians (most of whom Irving accused of slandering Hitler), Irving attended a historians' conference in Aschaffenburg in July 1978 to discuss \\"Hitler Today ‚Äì Problems and Aspects of Hitler Research\\".. Irving spent his time at the conference attacking all of the historians present for alleged sloppy research on Hitler, and promoting Hitler's War as the only good book ever written on the F√ºhrer.. Ian Kershaw wrote that although Irving's thesis of Hitler's ignorance of the Holocaust in Hitler's War was almost universally rejected by historians, his book was of value in that it provided a huge stimulus for further research on Hitler's role in the Holocaust (which had not been widely explored until then) as a way of rebutting Irving.Kerhshaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship, London: Edward Arnold 1985 page 95 Reactions and criticism Critical reception of Hitler's War was mostly negative. Various historians such as Gitta Sereny, Martin Broszat, Lucy Dawidowicz, Gerard Fleming, Charles W. Sydnor and Eberhard J√§ckel wrote either articles or books rebutting what they considered to be erroneous information in Hitler's War. Writing in the Sunday Times, Sereny called Irving's work \\"closer to theology or mythology\\" than history, while Broszat labelled Irving a \\"Hitler partisan wearing blinkers\\".. Lance Morrow wrote in Time that Irving's picture of the \\"F√ºhrer as a somewhat harried business executive too preoccupied to know exactly what was happening in his branch offices at Auschwitz and Treblinka\\" was hard to accept.. In an article published in the Sunday Times under the title \\"The ¬£1,000 Question\\" on 10 July 1977, Sereny and the journalist Lewis Chester examined Irving's sources and found significant differences from what Irving published in Hitler's War. In particular, while interviewing one of Irving's primary informants, Otto G√ºnsche, the latter stated that \\"one must assume that he [Hitler] did know\\" about the Holocaust. Some historians, such as John Keegan and Hugh Trevor- Roper, praised the book as well written and well researched ‚Äì although they disputed Irving's claim that Hitler had no knowledge of the Holocaust, and Trevor-Roper was strongly critical of Irving's repeating the \\"stale and exploded libel\\" about Churchill ordering the \\"assassination\\" of General Sikorski.Syndnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 page 173. Keegan wrote that Hitler's War was \\"Irving's greatest achievement... indispensable to anyone seeking to understand the war in the round\\". =Hugh Trevor-Roper= Trevor-Roper's praise was circumspect. Trevor- Roper commended Irving's \\"indefatigable, scholarly industry\\" and wrote \\"I have enjoyed reading his long work from beginning to end\\", but he also went on to note that many of the conclusions Irving drew were not supported by the evidence.Pelt, Robert Jan van (2002). The Case for Auschwitz. p. 20. Trevor- Roper objected to Irving's argument that one entry from Heinrich Himmler's phone log on 30 November 1941, ordering Heydrich to ensure that one train transport of German Jews to Latvia not be executed on arrival, proved that Hitler was opposed to genocide. Trevor-Roper argued that the message concerned only the people aboard that particular train and was not about all the Jews in Europe. (Irving, claiming to have misread the original source document as referring to transportation generally, rather than a specific train, later accepted that his reading of the message was wrong and that it actually referred to a single trainload out of Berlin.) Irving v. Penguin Books Limited, Deborah E. Lipstat [2000 EWHC QB 115] (11 April 2000) at paragraph 5.99 Trevor-Roper noted the contradiction in Irving's argument, based on the assumption that it was Hitler who ordered Himmler to spare the people aboard that train and the claim that Hitler was unaware in the fall of 1941 that the SS were rounding up German and Czech Jews to be sent to be shot in Eastern Europe (the first gassings via gas vans started on 8 December 1941). Trevor- Roper commented about Irving's claim that Hitler was unaware of the mass murders of Jews carried out by the SS while at the same time intervening to save Jewish lives that: \\"One does not veto an action unless one thinks that it is otherwise likely to occur\\". Finally, Trevor-Roper complained about Irving's \\"consistent bias\\" for Hitler and that \\"Mr. Irving's sympathies can hardly be doubted\\".Evans, Richard J (2001). Lying About Hitler. p. 41. =Alan Bullock= The British historian Alan Bullock writing in The New York Review of Books on 26 May 1977 dismissed Irving's depiction of Hitler as a leader too busy with the war to notice the Holocaust as contrary to all of the historical evidence. =Eberhard J√§ckel= The German historian Eberhard J√§ckel wrote a series of newspaper articles later turned into the book David Irving's Hitler: A Faulty History Dissected, attacking Irving and maintaining that Hitler was very much aware of and approved of the Holocaust. J√§ckel attacked Irving for claiming that a note from Heinrich Himmler's notebook ‚Äì \\"Jewish transport from Berlin, not to be liquidated\\", dated 30 November 1941 ‚Äì proved that Hitler did not want to see the Holocaust happen.. J√§ckel maintained that the order referred only to that train (a claim which, as noted above, Irving later accepted), and argued that if Hitler had ordered the people on that train to be spared, it must stand to reason that he was aware of the Holocaust. J√§ckel went on to argue that because the \\"Final Solution\\" was secret, it is not surprising that Hitler's servants were ignorant of the Holocaust, and that anyhow, five of Hitler's servants interviewed by Irving later claimed that they believed that Hitler was aware of the Holocaust.. J√§ckel argued on the basis of Hitler's statements in Mein Kampf that the F√ºhrer was always committed to genocide of the Jews, and that because Hitler later attempted to execute the foreign policy he outlined in Mein Kampf, it is a reasonable assumption that Hitler was always committed to genocide, which in J√§ckel's opinion disproves Irving's claim that Hitler was unaware of the Shoah.. J√§ckel used Hitler's tendency to involve himself in minutiae to argue that it is simply inconceivable that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust.. As evidence against Irving, J√§ckel used the \\"prophecy\\" made in Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech, when Hitler declared: :\\"I shall once again be your prophet: if international Jewry with its financial power in and outside of Europe should manage once more to draw the peoples of the world into world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the world, and thus the victory of Jewry, but rather the total destruction of the Jewish race in Europe.\\" Likewise, J√§ckel used Himmler's Posen speeches of 1943 and certain other statements on his part in 1944 referring to an \\"order\\" from an unnamed higher authority as proof that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust.. In the same way, J√§ckel used Hitler's order of 13 March 1941, ordering that the Einsatzgruppen be reestablished for Operation Barbarossa, as proof of the F√ºhrer's involvement in the Holocaust.. J√§ckel also cited the entry in Joseph Goebbels's diary on 27 March 1942 ‚Äì mentioning that the F√ºhrer's \\"prophecy\\" of 1939 was coming true ‚Äì as a sign that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust, and accused Irving of dishonesty in claiming that there was no sign in the Goebbels's diary that Hitler knew of the Holocaust.. Finally, J√§ckel noted the frequent references to the \\"prophecy\\" in Hitler's wartime speeches as a sign that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust, thereby disproving Irving's claim that Hitler was ignorant of the \\"Final Solution\\".. In response to J√§ckel's first article, Irving announced that he had seen a document from 1942 proving that Hitler had ordered the Holocaust not to occur, but that the document was now \\"lost\\".. J√§ckel wrote that he had \\"easily\\" discovered the \\"lost\\" document, in which the head of the Reich Chancellery, Hans Lammers, wrote to the Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger that Hitler ordered him to put the \\"Jewish Question\\" on the \\"back-burner\\" until after the war. J√§ckel noted the document concerned was the result of a meeting between Lammers and Schlegelberger on 10 April 1942 concerning amendments to the divorce law concerning German Jews and Mischlinge. J√§ckel commented that in 1942, there was a division of labour between the representatives of the Rechtsstaat (Law State) and the Polizeistaat (Police State) in Nazi Germany.. J√§ckel argued that for the representatives of the Rechtsstaat like the Ministry of Justice, the \\"Final Solution\\" was a bureaucratic process to deprive Jews of their civil rights and to isolate them, whereas for representatives of Polizeistaat like the SS, the \\"Final Solution\\" was genocide. J√§ckel argued that Hitler's order to Lammers to tell Schlegelberger to wait until after the war before concerning him about the \\"impracticable\\" details of the divorce laws between German Jews and \\"Aryans\\" was simply Hitler's way of putting Schlegelberger off.. J√§ckel maintained that since Hitler expected to win the war, and to complete the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\" by killing every single Jew in the world, Hitler would have had no interest in amending the divorce law to make it easier for those in mixed marriages to divorce their Jewish or Mischlinge spouses.. Moreover, J√§ckel noted that Hitler disliked dealing with the officials of the Justice Ministry, and Schlegelberger in particular. Hitler was to sack him as Justice Minister later in 1942, so it was understandable that Hitler would not want to see Schlegelberger.. J√§ckel ended his essay arguing that the \\"lost\\" document in no way proved that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust, and accused Irving of deceitfulness in claiming otherwise. =John Lukacs= The American historian John Lukacs in a very unfavourable book review in the edition of 19 August 1977 of National Review called Hitler's War a worthless book, while Walter Laqueur, when reviewing Hitler's War in The New York Times Book Review of 3 April 1977, accused Irving of selective use of the historical record in Hitler's favour. Laqueur argued that Hitler's War read more like a legal brief written by a defence lawyer who was attempting to exonerate Hitler before the judgement of history, than a historical work. Lukacs called Irving an \\"amateur historian\\" whose determination to defend Hitler had resulted in an \\"appalling\\" book.Lukacs, John \\"Caveat Lector\\" pages 946‚Äì950 from National Review, Volume XXIX, Issue # 32, 19 August 1977, page 946 Lukacs complimented Irving's industry in tracking down hundreds of people who knew Hitler, but went on to note personal recollections are not always the best historical source, and that Irving manufactured battles; for instance, crediting Field Marshal Ferdinand Sch√∂rner with a victory in April 1945 against the Red Army for the control of Ostrava, a battle which did not, in fact, take place.Lukacs, John \\"Caveat Lector\\" pages 946‚Äì950 from National Review, Volume XXIX, Issue # 32, 19 August 1977, page 947 Lukacs took issue with Irving's language, which he described as conveying moral judgements that were not supported by the facts. Lukacs was very critical of Irving's claims that Poland had planned to invade Germany in 1939 and likewise, that the Soviet Union was on the verge of attacking the Reich in 1941, in both cases justifying German \\"preventative wars\\" against those states. =Martin Broszat= In an article first published in the Vierteljahrshefte f√ºr Zeitgeschichte journal in 1977, Martin Broszat wrote that: > \\"He [Irving] is too eager to accept authenticity for objectivity, is overly > hasty in interpreting superficial diagnoses and often seems insufficiently > interested in complex historical interconnections and in structural problems > that transcend the mere recording of historical facts, but are essential for > their evaluation\\".Broszat, Martin \\"Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final > Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses\\" pages 390‚Äì429 from > Aspects of the Third Reich edited by H.W. Koch pages 392‚Äì393. Broszat argued that in writing Hitler's War, Irving was too concerned with the \\"antechamber aspects\\" of Hitler's headquarters, and accused Irving of distorting historical facts in Hitler's favour.Broszat, Martin \\"Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses\\" pages 390‚Äì429 from Aspects of the Third Reich edited by H.W. Koch pages 393 & 413‚Äì419 Broszat complained that Irving was focused too much on military events at the expense of the broader political context of the war, and that he had offered false interpretations such as accepting at face value the Nazi claim that the Action T4 \\"euthanasia\\" program was launched in September 1939 to free up hospital spaces for wounded German soldiers, when in fact the program was launched in January 1939.Broszat, Martin \\"Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses\\" pages 390‚Äì429 from Aspects of the Third Reich edited by H.W. Koch page 394. In particular, Broszat criticised Irving's claim that because of one telephone note written by Himmler stating \\"No liquidation\\" in regards to a train transport of German Jews passing through Berlin to Riga (whom the SS intended to have all shot upon arrival) on 30 November 1941 that this proved that Hitler did not want to see the Holocaust happen.Broszat, Martin \\"Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses\\" pages 390‚Äì429 from Aspects of the Third Reich edited by H.W. Koch pages 413‚Äì415 Broszat argued that this was not proof that Hitler had given any such order to Himmler to stop the killings of Jews, but rather that the comment \\"No liquidation\\" referred only to that particular train, and was mostly likely related to concerns about questions American reporters were asking about the fate of German Jews being sent to Eastern Europe.Broszat, Martin \\"Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses\\" pages 390‚Äì429 from Aspects of the Third Reich edited by H.W. Koch pages 414‚Äì415 Broszat questioned whether Hitler had given Himmler any order about the train, given that the phone call Himmler made from the Wolfsschanze to Heydrich in Prague took place at about 11: 30 A.M., and the records show that Hitler did not get up until about 2: 00 P.M on 30 November 1941. Likewise, Broszat criticised Irving for accepting the \\"fantastic\\" claims of the SS Obergruppenf√ºhrer Karl Wolff that he did not know about the Holocaust (Irving's argument was that if Wolff did not know about the Holocaust, how could Hitler have known), despite the fact that Wolff was convicted of war crimes in 1963 on the basis of documentary evidence implicating him in the Holocaust.Broszat, Martin \\"Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses\\" pages 390‚Äì429 from Aspects of the Third Reich edited by H.W. Koch pages 420‚Äì421 Broszat accused Irving of seeking to generate a highly misleading impression of a conference between Hitler and the Hungarian Regent, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy in April 1943 by re-arranging the words to make Hitler appear less brutally anti-Semitic than what the original notes showed.Broszat, Martin \\"Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses\\" pages 390‚Äì429 from Aspects of the Third Reich edited by H.W. Koch pages 427‚Äì428. Along the same lines, Broszat maintained that the picture of World War II drawn by Irving was done in a such way to engage in moral equivalence between the actions of the Axis and Allied states, leading to Hitler's \\"fanatical, destructive will to annihilate\\" being downgraded to being \\"...no longer an exceptional phenomenon\\".Broszat, Martin \\"Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses\\" pages 390‚Äì429 from Aspects of the Third Reich edited by H.W. Koch page 395. The criticism by Broszat was considered to be especially damaging to Irving because Broszat had based his critique largely by examining the same primary sources Irving had used for Hitler's War. =Charles Sydnor= Another equally scathing review was published by the American historian Charles Sydnor who argued that Hitler's War was marred by Irving's efforts to present Hitler in the most favourable light possible.Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 pages 172‚Äì173. Sydnor commented that Irving wrongly and bizarrely presented SS massacres in Poland in September 1939 as the legitimate response to the British rejection of Hitler's peace offer of October 1939, and that Irving seemed to imply that Hitler's anti-Semitism was justified by the Anglo-American strategic bombing offensive against German cities.Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 page 173. Sydnor noted numerous errors in Hitler's War such as Irving's claim that Andreas Hofer was shot by the French in 1923 for opposing the French occupation of the Ruhr (Irving probably had Albert Leo Schlageter in mind), and that the 1945 film Kolberg, which dealt with the theme of a Prussian fortress besieged by the French in 1806, was set in the Seven Years' War.Syndnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 pages 178. Sydnor also speculated about just what motivated the East German government to allow Irving entry into the German Democratic Republic to search for information about Hitler, commenting \\"That the East Germans assisted Mr. Irving in an effort that would culminate in a revisionist interpretation of Hitler is a fact of real interest ‚Äì and some amusement if one speculates on the question of who may have been taken in by whom.\\"Syndnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 pages 175. Sydnor was highly critical of Irving's unreferenced statement that the Jews who fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 were well supplied with weapons from Germany's allies.Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 pages 179. In the same light, concerning Irving's claim that Hitler was ignorant of the Holocaust prior to October 1943, Sydnor commented that Hitler had received a SS report in November 1942 which contained a mention of 363,211 Russian Jews executed by the Einsatzgruppen between August‚ÄìNovember 1942.Syndnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 pages 182‚Äì183. Similarly, Sydnor charged Irving with misquotation such as having Hitler say on 25 October 1941 \\"with the Jews too I've found myself remaining inactive\\", thereby implying that Hitler wanted to be \\"inactive\\" against the Jews for the rest of the war, when the documents show Hitler's remarks to be \\"Even with regard to the Jews I've found myself remaining inactive\\", and that Hitler's remark was referring to the past when Hitler was criticising himself for his past \\"inactivity\\" against the Jews.Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 pages 184. Likewise, Sydnor argued that Irving's statement that all previous Hitler biographies were compromised by their hostility towards der F√ºhrer is not supported by an examination of said biographies.Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 pages 175‚Äì176. Sydnor remarked that Irving's statement that the Einsatzgruppen were in charge in the death camps seems to indicate that he was not familiar with the history of the Holocaust as the Einsatzgruppen were in fact mobile death squads who had nothing to do with the death camps.Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 page 176. Moreover, Syndnor noted that Irving falsely claimed that the Einsatzgruppen operating in Poland in 1939 were under the authority of SS General Udo von Woyrsch, when in fact the Einsatzgruppen were divided into two groups, one of which reported to Heydrich and another to Theodor Eicke (General Woyrsch commanded a group reporting to Heydrich).Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 pages 176‚Äì177. Sydnor commented acidly in light of Irving's claim of Hitler's ignorance of the massacres of Poles that Eicke commanded Einsatzgruppe III and the SS Death's Head Regiment Brandenburg during the Polish campaign from Hitler's headquarters train \\"Amerika\\".Syndnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 page 177. Continuing on the theme of the Einsatzgruppen, Sydnor criticised Irving for his statement that the Babi Yar massacre of September 1941 was the first massacre carried out by the Einsatzgruppen in 1941, when in fact the Einsatzgruppen had been staging massacres of Soviet Jews since the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941.Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 pages 186 Sydnor charged Irving with offering a false interpretation of Hitler's reaction to Konrad Morgen's report of October 1944 about widespread corruption in the SS as marking Hitler's moral outrage at the Holocaust; Sydnor asserted that Hitler's outrage had nothing to do with the murder of the Jews, and everything to do with the revelation of SS corruption.Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 pages 189‚Äì190. Concerning Irving's claim that General Friedrich Olbricht was engaged in an orgy on the night of 20 July 1944 in reaction to the news of Hitler's apparent assassination, Sydnor noted that Irving does not explain how General Olbricht could have been directing a putsch at the Bendlerblock on the night of 20 July while at the same time engaging in an orgy at his home.Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 page 193. Sydnor accused Irving of selective quotation from the memoirs of Joachim von Ribbentrop, noting that Irving quoted the passage: \\"How things came to the destruction of the Jews, I just don't know...But that he [Hitler] ordered it, I refuse to believe, because such an act would be wholly incompatible with the picture I always had of him\\", but did not quote the next sentence where Ribbentrop wrote: \\"On the other hand, judging from his [Hitler's] last will, one must suppose that he at least knew about it, if, in his fanaticism against the Jews, he didn't also order it\\".Sydnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 page 185. Finally, Sydnor argued that Irving's account of the final days of Hitler appeared to comprise little more than a rehashing of Hugh Trevor-Roper's 1947 book, The Last Days of Hitler, only with Hitler as an object of sympathy, rather than scorn.Syndnor, Charles \\"The Selling of Adolf Hitler: David Irving's Hitler's War\\" pages 169‚Äì99 from Central European History Issue # 2, Volume 12, June 1979 page 196. =Lucy Dawidowicz= In her 1981 book The Holocaust and Historians, the American historian Lucy Dawidowicz called Irving an apologist for the Third Reich with minimal scholarly standards. Dawidowicz wrote that she believed that the term revisionist was inappropriate for Irving because revisionism is a legitimate historical method whereas Irving was not entitled to call himself a historian, revisonist or otherwise, and only deserved the label apologist. Dawidowicz maintained that the \\"No liquidation\\" message in Himmler's phone log refers not to the German Jews being deported to be shot in Riga, but rather to a Dr. Jekelius, whom Himmler believed to be the son of Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov, who was also travelling on that train, and whom Himmler wanted to see arrested, but not executed. =Gordon A. Craig= The American historian Gordon A. Craig complained that of Irving's double standard in Hitler's War of crediting all of the German victories to the F√ºhrer while blaming all of the German defeats in the war on Hitler's unworthy and incompetent generals. Craig wrote that in his opinion some of Irving's language was inappropriate, such as Irving's remark that \\"Hitler was cheated of the ultimate winter victory\\", and that Irving totally ignored Hitler's own incompetence as a military leader. Craig charged that it was simply wrong on the part of Irving to write that Hitler in October 1941 was in a state of pain over German losses on the Eastern Front with Hitler supposedly thinking \\"What would be left of Germany and the flower of her manhood?\\". As a way of rebuttal to this picture of Hitler, Craig quoted Hitler's remark later in 1941 when told of heavy German losses, \\"But that's what the young people are there for!\\". Like many other historians, Craig was critical of Irving using the \\"no liquidation\\" comment in Himmler's telephone logbook from 30 November 1941 to prove that Hitler was opposed to the Holocaust. Citing Lucy Dawidowicz, Craig argued the phrase \\"no liquidation\\" referred only to Dr. Jekelius. Finally, to prove that Hitler was aware of the Holocaust, Craig quoted Hitler's remark to the Czechoslovak foreign minister in January 1939 that \\"We are going to destroy the Jews!...The day of reckoning has come!\\" plus the broad hints that Hitler dropped in his speeches of 30 January 1941; 30 January 1942; 24 February 1942; 30 September 1942, and 8 November 1942 that he knew of the Holocaust. Finally, Craig cited Himmler's remark of May 1944 where he stated he had orders from an unnamed higher authority (who Craig argued could only be Hitler) for the \\"Final Solution.\\" Despite the controversy Hitler's War generated, it was a best-seller in 1977. In particular, Hitler's War was a best-seller in GermanyStern, Kenneth Holocaust Denial, New York: American Jewish Committee, 1992 page 29. The American author Gill Seidel summed up the appeal of Hitler's War to Germans as: > \\"It is not difficult to explain its appeal. The argument of the book may be > summed up as: \\"If only the F√ºhrer had known about the murder of the Jews, he > would had stopped it'.

Scanlon, is an American philosopher. At the time of his retirement in 2016, he was the Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy, and Civil Polity\\"The Alford Professor of Natural Religion, Moral Philosophy, and Civil Polity is among the oldest endowed chairs at Harvard University, having been first established in 1789. Past holders of the chair include Josiah Royce, Gerge Herbert Palmer, William Ernest Hocking, and Roderick Firth.\\" in Harvard University's Department of Philosophy, where he had taught since 1984. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2018. Life and career Born June 28, 1940, Scanlon grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana; obtained his undergraduate degree from Princeton University in 1962; earned his PhD in philosophy from Harvard under Burton Dreben; studied for a year at Oxford University on a Fulbright Scholarship; and returned to Princeton University, where he taught from 1966 until 1984. He was made a MacArthur Fellow in 1993. His teaching in the department has included courses on theories of justice, equality, and recent ethical theory. His book, What We Owe to Each Other, was published by Harvard University Press in 1998; a collection of papers on political theory, The Difficulty of Tolerance, was published by Cambridge University Press in 2003. Scanlon is the father-in-law of philosopher and scholar of African-American studies Tommie Shelby. Philosophical work His dissertation and some of his first papers were in mathematical logic, where his main concern was in proof theory, but he turned to ethics and political philosophy, where he developed a version of contractualism in the line of John Rawls, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Scanlon has also published important work on freedom of speech, equality, tolerance, foundations of contract law, human rights, conceptions of welfare, theories of justice, as well as on foundational questions in moral theory. = Contractualism = Contractualism is a constructivist attempt at providing a unified account of the subject matter of a central part of morality which Scanlon calls \\"what we owe to each other\\". The normative domain of what we owe to each other is meant to encompass those duties to other people which we bear in virtue of their standing as rational creatures. A broader conception of morality includes whatever else we may owe to specific people, such as the special obligations we bear in relations with friends and family, or whatever else morality may require of us, such as the way in which we treat ourselves or nature. Scanlon believes that what we owe to each other, or what we could loosely call \\"the morality of right and wrong\\", is distinct from this broader conception of morality in that contractualism provides a unified account of its content.Scanlon, T. M., 1998, What We Owe to Each Other, pp. 6‚Äì7 In Scanlon's contractualism, judgements about right and wrong, unlike empirical judgements, are not theoretical claims about the nature of the spatiotemporal world but rather practical claims about what we have reason to do.Scanlon 2 Further, they are a particularly important class of practical claims in that the judgement that an action is wrong is taken to provide reasons to not do that action which are most often considered to be decisive against competing reasons.Scanlon 1 Following this point, Scanlon takes questions about the reason-giving force of moral judgements to be prior to questions about the subject matter of the morality of right and wrong.Scanlon 3 More explicitly, he thinks that if we provide an account of the extraordinary reason-giving force of moral judgements then this account could largely form the basis for a characterisation of the subject matter of what we owe to each other. Scanlon grounds the reason-giving force of judgements about right and wrong in \\"the positive value of a way of living with others\\".Scanlon 162 A way of living with others which is typified by an ideal of mutual recognition between rational agents, where mutual recognition demands that moral agents acknowledge the value of human life and respond to this value in the right ways. On the question of how ought we to value human, or rational, life, Scanlon argues that different valuable things require different ways of valuing. In contrast to teleological accounts of value, often to take something to be of value is not only to see reason to bring about a maximal amount of that thing.Scanlon 78‚Äì100 This is especially true when considering the value of human life. When we value human life, he writes, we do not see this as a reason to create as much human life as we can. Rather, we tend to see reason to respect other human beings, to protect them from death and other forms of harm and, in general, to want their lives to go well. More important for Scanlon, to value rational life is to recognize the features which distinguish rational life from other valuable things, specifically, the ability of rational creatures to assess reasons and judgements, and to govern their lives in accordance with these assessments. Scanlon asserts that the proper response to the recognition of these distinctive features is to treat rational creatures in terms of principles which they could not reasonably reject.Scanlon 105‚Äì106 From this point, Scanlon's account of the value of rational life provides a focus around which his account of the reason-giving force of moral judgements dovetails quite neatly with a characterization of the method of reasoning which we use to arrive at judgements of right and wrong, a method, moreover, which seems to be phenomenologically plausible. The reason-giving force of moral judgements is grounded in an ideal of mutual recognition which requires treating others in accordance with principles that they could not reasonably reject. Because mutual recognition requires that these other people are also appropriately motivated, this entails Scanlon's formulation of wrongness: \\"An act is wrong if and only if any principle that permitted it would be one that could reasonably be rejected by people moved to find principles for the general regulation of behaviour that others, similarly motivated, could not reasonably reject\\".Scanlon 4 An act is right, quite simply, if a principle permitting it could not reasonably be rejected in terms of this contractualist formulation. Regarding how moral principles are derived from the contractualist formulation, when considering whether a principle can be rejected we must take into account the consequences, in general, of its being accepted, not only the consequences of the particular actions that it allows.Scanlon 203‚Äì204 Because we cannot be sure about who will be affected by a principle, and how they will be affected, we must draw on our experience of life and consider the \\"generic reasons\\" which individuals are likely to have, as a result of their general circumstances, to reject a principle.Scanlon 204‚Äì205 In order to determine whether a principle is reasonably rejectable, we must impartially weigh these generic reasons against each other,Scanlon 195 and exercising our judgement, draw a conclusion about what the weight of reasons support.Scanlon 218 Given the motivation of finding principles for the general regulation of society that no-one could reasonably reject, if the weight of reasons support a certain conclusion then it would be unreasonable to reject that conclusion.Scanlon 192 Importantly, principles can only be rejected by individuals; aggregation of reasons across individuals is not allowed.Scanlon 229‚Äì230 So if the generic reasons of an individual carry more weight than any other individual's generic reasons, then his generic reasons are (for the most part) decisive in determining principles. The generic reasons which are open to consideration under the contractualist formulation are any reasons which we judge as relevant to reasonable rejectability. This requires that we exercise our judgement in determining whether such reasons would be suitable grounds for mutual recognition.Scanlon 194 Therefore, that a principle would negatively affect a person's well-being is not the only kind of reason which may be brought against a principle. Other considerations, such as how a burden would be imposed by a principle, can serve as reasonable grounds for rejection. While contractualism only provides an account of that central part of morality which deals with what we owe to each other, Scanlon writes that this part of morality is related to the broader realm of morality in complex ways. There is pressure for the morality of what we owe to each other to acknowledge the values included in the broader realm of morality insofar as principles which don't make room for these values could be reasonably rejected. In turn, these values must accommodate the dictates of what we owe to each other to the extent that they involve relations with others, who have separate moral standing.Scanlon 174 In popular culture Scanlon's What We Owe to Each Other is referenced several times in the American television series The Good Place, serving as the initial text used to instruct a woman who has apparently ended up in a Heaven by mistake. The phrase \\"What We Owe to Each Other\\" is used as the title of the sixth episode of the first season, and that episode features a summary of Scanlon's ideas, as does the season two finale. Scanlon's ideas play a prominent role in the series finale, in which protagonist Eleanor finally finishes reading Scanlon's book, and uses the principles of contractualism to explain a crucial decision that she makes.

Retrieved June 2013. The vast majority of paleontologists regard it as the most basal whale. Description Based on the skull sizes of specimens, and to a lesser extent on composite skeletons, species of Pakicetus are thought to have been to in length. P. inachus life restoration Pakicetus looked very different from modern cetaceans, and its body shape more resembled those of land-dwelling hoofed mammals. Unlike all later cetaceans, it had four fully functional long legs. Pakicetus had a long snout; a typical complement of teeth that included incisors, canines, premolars, and molars; a distinct and flexible neck; and a very long and robust tail. As in most land mammals, the nose was at the tip of the snout. Reconstructions of pakicetids that followed the discovery of composite skeletons often depicted them with fur; however, given their relatively close relationships with hippos, they may have had sparse body hair. The first fossil found consisted of an incomplete skull with a skull cap and a broken mandible with some teeth. Based on the detail of the teeth, the molars suggest that the animal could rend and tear flesh. Wear, in the form of scrapes on the molars, indicated that Pakicetus ground its teeth as it chewed its food. Because of the toothwear, Pakicetus is thought to have eaten fish and small animals. The teeth also suggest that Pakicetus had herbivorous and omnivorous ancestors. Palaeobiology Size of Pakicetus, compared to a human =Possible semi-aquatic nature= It was illustrated on the cover of Science as a semiaquatic, vaguely crocodile-like mammal, diving after fish. Somewhat more complete skeletal remains were discovered in 2001, prompting the view that Pakicetus was primarily a land animal about the size of a wolf, very similar in form to the related mesonychids. wrote that \\"Pakicetids were terrestrial mammals, no more amphibious than a tapir.\\" However, argued that \\"the orbits ... of these cetaceans were located close together on top of the skull, as is common in aquatic animals that live in water but look at emerged objects. Just like Indohyus, limb bones of pakicetids are osteosclerotic, also suggestive of aquatic habitat\\" (since heavy bones provide ballast). \\"This peculiarity could indicate that Pakicetus could stand in water, almost totally immersed, without losing visual contact with the air.\\" =Sensory capabilities= The Pakicetus skeleton reveals several details regarding the creature's unique senses, and provides a newfound ancestral link between terrestrial and aquatic animals. As previously mentioned, the Pakicetus' upward-facing eye placement was a significant indication of its habitat. Even more so, however, was its auditory abilities. Like all other cetaceans, Pakicetus had a thickened skull bone known as the auditory bulla, which was specialized for underwater hearing. Cetaceans also all categorically exhibit a large mandibular foramen within the lower jaw, which holds a fat pack and extends towards the ear, both of which are also associated with underwater hearing. \\"Pakicetus is the only cetacean in which the mandibular foramen is small, as is the case in all terrestrial animals. It thus lacked the fat pad, and sounds reached its eardrum following the external auditory meatus as in terrestrial mammals. Thus the hearing mechanism of Pakicetus is the only known intermediate between that of land mammals and aquatic cetaceans.\\" With both the auditory and visual senses in mind, as well as the typical diet of Pakicetus, one might assume that the creature was able to attack both aquatic and terrestrial prey from a low vantage point. History of discovery The first and subsequent fossils were found in Pakistan, hence the generic name Pakicetus. The fossils were found in the Kuldana Formation in of Kohat in northern Pakistan and were dated as early to early-middle Eocene in age. The fossils came out of red terrigenous sediments bounded largely by shallow marine deposits typical of coastal environments caused by the Tethys Ocean. Speculation is that many major marine banks flourished with the presence of this prehistoric whale. According to the location of fossil findings, they preferred a shallow habitat that neighbored decent-sized land. Assortments of limestone, dolomite, stonemud and other varieties of different colored sands has been predicted to be a favorable habitat for Pakicetus. During the Eocene, Pakistan was a coastal region of Eurasia, and therefore an ideal habitat for the evolution and diversification of the Pakicetidae. Classification Pakicetus was originally described as being a mesonychid, but later research reclassified it as an early cetacean due to characteristic features of the inner ear found only in cetaceans, (namely, the large auditory bulla is formed from the ectotympanic bone only), it was recognized as the earliest member of the family Pakicetidae. It was originally believed to be descended from mesonychids, according to . However, the redescription of the primitive, semi- aquatic artiodactyl Indohyus, and the discovery of its cetacean-like inner ear, simultaneously put an end to the idea that whales were descended from mesonychids, while demonstrating that Pakicetus, and all other cetaceans, are artiodactyls. Thus, Pakicetus represents a transitional taxon between extinct land mammals and modern cetaceans.

He graduated with an MSc in Agricultural Engineering from the Catholic University of Leuven in 1979, with a thesis focussed on agrarian change in the community of Heers. His 1985 Master in Urban and Regional Planning was also from Leuven. He earned his PhD with a thesis entitled \\"The production of new spaces of production\\" under the supervision of the renowned Marxist geographer David Harvey at Johns Hopkins University in 1991. From 1988 until 2006 Swyngedouw taught at the University of Oxford, latterly as professor of geography and was a fellow of St. Peter's College. He is currently Professor of Human Geography at the University of Manchester, England. He is also visiting professor at the University of Ghent, Belgium. He has worked and taught in the US, France, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Ecuador, and Greece Scholarship Swyngedouw has committed his studies to political economic analysis of contemporary capitalism, producing several major works on economic globalisation, regional development, finance, and urbanisation. His interests have also included political-ecological themes, and the transformation of nature, urban governance, politics of scale, notably water issues, in Ecuador, Spain, the UK, and elsewhere in Europe. His recent work focuses on the democratic politics and the strategies and tactics of new political movements, and the political ecology of desalination. He has published over 100 academic papers in leading academic journals in geography and cognate disciplines and in scholarly books.  Selected publications  * Swyngedouw, E. with L. Albrechts and D.

He debuted on-screen on 23 March 1982. Thorp died on 22 May 2013 and his last scenes that Thorp filmed were aired on 4 June 2013 in a special hour-long episode dedicated to him. It was announced on 12 September 2013 that Alan would be killed off in late October with his daughter Steph (Lorraine Chase) returning for his funeral. Alan died in his sleep on 24 October 2013. Casting Thorp took a break from filming in 2009 due to health issues before returning to filming in March 2010. In 2010 Thorp commented on his duration saying \\"I ought to have regrets about staying, but I'm the laziest human being alive so I don't\\". He added \\"there was no point in me moving on because I wasn't good enough!\\" Thorp went on to bemoan the lack of storylines for Alan saying \\"I would hate to leave, but I wish they'd find more for me to do\\". He added that he had suggested that \\"Turner get a love interest\\" but that the writers had refused saying \\"they'd have to dig her up\\". In 2010 Thorp commented on his role saying the serial has been \\"very good to me and has renewed my contracts for years, but they have not got as much work for me these days - I'm more like the village memorial now than an active character\\". Characterisation What's on TV profiled Alan as a \\"boozer and womaniser in his younger years, Alan Turner has mellowed with age and become a stalwart of the community\\". Storylines Alan came to live in Emmerdale village in 1982. Alan and Jill end their marriage in 1985. Alan spends his early years in the village doing business deals and working on the local council. He worked as an estate manager for NY Estates, having a rival in Joe Sugden (Frazer Hines), who later got his job. Alan finds himself outwitted by NY Estates' gamekeeper Seth Armstrong (Stan Richards) in several occasions. Alan and Caroline Bates (Diana Davies) start dating when she becomes his secretary at NY Estates in 1984. The couple plan to marry in 1989 but Caroline leaves the village to care for her ailing mother, Alice Wood (Olivia Jardith). Alan becomes landlord of the Woolpack following Amos Brearly's decision to retire in January 1991. Alan married Shirley Foster (Rachel Davies) on 10 February 1994. Four months later, on 7 June 1994 Shirley is shot by Reg Dawson (Niven Boyd) during a siege at Home Farm and dies. In 1998 Alan's granddaughter, Tricia Stokes (Sheree Murphy), arrives in the village and they form a close relationship. Steph, Alan's daughter and Tricia's mother, arrives in the village in 2002. Steph and Alan have several disagreements but are united by their grief for Tricia after she is killed in a storm. Alan and Shelley Williams (Carolyn Pickles), Steph's best friend, start dating but Steph is not happy about having a rival for Alan's attention and voices her disapproval but the relationship continued and they began making plans to move to Spain. Steph lies that Shelley only wants Alan's money so Shelley left, leading Alan to begin drinking heavily. Alan and Steph argue on the B&B; stairs before Alan falls down them and Steph looks after him but drugs him, leaving him at her mercy, as she plans to sell Alan's business and put him into sheltered accommodation. Alan realises what Steph is doing and manages to tell his neighbours, leading Steph to almost kill them both by driving to a quarry edge but she can't go through with it and what she has been doing is revealed. Shelley disappears and Steph is suspected of murdering her and Alan accepts Shelley is dead, only for her to attend the memorial service. Although horrified that Shelley had let Steph go to prison for suspected murder, he forgave her and they tried to rebuild their relationship but Shelley couldn't cope with Steph around and Alan couldn't disown his daughter so he begged Steph to go after Shelly and bring her home. On the ferry, Steph and Shelley argue leading Shelley to fall overboard and Steph left her to drown, returning to the village. Steph's relationship with Alan strengthens and he allows her to take over the B&B; again. Steph falls in love with local doctor, Adam Forsythe (Richard Shelton). Steph tells Alan she was sexually abused by her older brother, Terence, when she was a child. Incensed, Alan dismissed her claims and resumes contact with his estranged son. Alan turns against Steph, Adam and Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook) before moving into Holdgate Farm with Terence. Soon after, Terence admitted abusing Steph and so Alan threw Terence out but he returned to torment Steph, leading to a fight between Terence and Adam which resulted in Terence's death. Although Adam takes her on holiday and married her, the murder weighs on Steph's sanity, upsetting Alan when Adam has her sectioned. Despite her confession to playing a part in Terence's murder, Adam tells Alan that Steph's confession is a lie attributable to state of mind but Alan feels Steph is telling the truth. Adam leaves when Steph is released from hospital and Terence's body is found. With Adam gone, Steph is charged with her brother's murder and Alan is desperate to get Steph out of prison as he fears she cannot cope. Steph confesses to Alan that she played a part in Shelley's death and is sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her brother. Following Steph's imprisonment and Terence's cremation, Alan wants answers and visits Adam in prison. Alan is shocked when Adam's ex-wife Isla (Sarah Griffiths) tells him Adam had hanged himself. Feeling low, Alan seeks comfort from Betty, clumsily making a pass at her. Alan is embarrassed when she rejects him. In December 2006, Alan decides to visit Kathy Brookman (Malandra Burrows) in Australia and stayed over Christmas. Alan returns to the village and lives with Betty and Sandy Thomas (Freddie Jones). In early 2008, Alan visits Kathy again. Upon his return, he shares a kiss with Pearl Ladderbanks (Meg Johnson). David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) asks Alan to run for the Council in opposition to Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell). Alan had no desire to return to politics but advises David in his candidacy. David wins but soon disappoints Alan due to lack of attention to his duties. Alan's friend, Eddy Fox (Paul Darrow), arrives in the village, asking him to go travelling with him. Alan is reluctant to go but Lily Butterfield (Anne Charleston), goes instead. Alan joined them later and is away for a period of seven months. In December 2010, Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick) asks Alan about the events surrounding Eric's second wife Elizabeth's (Kate Dove) death 17 years earlier in the plane crash after her son Michael Feldmann (Matthew Vaughan) accuses Eric of murdering her and covering it up through the crash. Alan tells Val that there had been a lot of suspicion about Eric in the aftermath of the plane crash. In January 2011, Alan and Betty move into Mill Cottage temporarily after a fire, started by Nick Henshall (Michael McKell), damages their home. Alan and Betty move back in once their house is renovated. For Alan's 76th birthday on 5 August 2011, he is touched by the replacement watch his friends buy him after his stops working. In March 2012, Alan, having once run Home Farm and been a councillor, has doubts about the village festival planned by Home Farm owner Declan Macey (Jason Merrells) for the summer and raised his concerns to him. At the end of the month, he shares his war experiences with Sean Spencer (Luke Roskell) when he was doing a school project. He welcomes fellow housemate Betty home when she returns from her cruise in July. In July 2013, it was explained that Alan had gone travelling around France with his biker friends. In October, Alan returns (off-screen) but when Betty goes to see him, she finds he has died in his sleep. His funeral is held on 30 October and Steph returns under police guard to attend. Alan is mentioned in May 2015 when Betty says to Pearl that without Seth or Alan, life in the village would never be the same. In June 2017, Zak visits Alan's grave and tidies it up. Reception Thomas Quinn of the Daily Mirror felt Alan was deceiving himself thinking he was going to marry Stella (Stephanie Schonfield) as \\"she's rich and beautiful while he's poor, fat, old and boring\\". In 2002, Alan was named as one of \\"The 30 greatest Emmerdale residents\\" by a writer for Inside Soap. They said \\"Roly-poly Alan was originally a ruthless businessman hated by all, now he's a cuddly landlord, swapping the boardroom for the bedrooms of the B&B; he runs.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Character profile at itv.com * Character profile at What's on TV * Character profile at Holy Soap * Character profile at MTV3 Category:Emmerdale characters Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Television characters introduced in 1982 Category:Male characters in television Category:Male villains ","title":"Alan Turner (Emmerdale)"},{"id":"3957558","text":"Dyffryn Ardudwy railway station serves the villages of Dyffryn Ardudwy, Coed Ystumgwern and Llanenddwyn in Gwynedd, Wales. Dyffryn Ardudwy gives its name to the district and to the very extensive beach and sand dunes on the coast nearby that are known as Morfa Dyffryn. History The station was opened on 10 October 1867 by the Cambrian Railway Company as Dyffryn. The station once had two platforms and was a passing place for trains between Harlech and Barmouth. There was a goods yard to the east of the station. On 1 July 1924 it was renamed Dyffryn-on-Sea. The station was host to a GWR camp coach from 1934 to 1939. On 1 June 1948 was renamed to its present name. A camping coach was also positioned here by the Western Region from 1956 to 1962. In 1963 the administration of camping coaches at the station was taken over by the London Midland, there was a coach here from 1963 to 1964. The station was destaffed when the passing loop was taken out of use in 1968. The redundant track remained in place until 1980 as did a signal that had been converted to a fixed distant. All trains now use the down platform. The station building on the up platform is today a dwelling. In 2016, The Welsh Government funded the installation of reinforced glass fibre 'humps' on the platforms to improve access for wheelchair and pushchair users onto and off trains. Services The station is an unstaffed halt on the Cambrian Coast Railway with passenger services to Harlech, Porthmadog, Pwllheli, Barmouth, Machynlleth and Shrewsbury.

His circus was popular in Victorian Britain for 30 years, a period that is regarded as the golden age of the circus. Since the 1960s, Pablo Fanque has been best known for being mentioned in The Beatles song \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" on their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). Early life Little is known about Pablo Fanque's early life. Church records suggest that he was born in Norwich in 1810 and was one of at least five children, born to John and Mary Darby ( Stamp). They were believed to have resided in Ber Street. When Fanque married in 1848, he said his late father's occupation was \\"butler\\" on his marriage certificate. Dr. John M. Turner speculates in his 2003 biography of Fanque that \\"his father was Indian-born and had been brought to the port of Norwich and trained as a house servant.\\" Fanque was reportedly orphaned at a young age. Another account has Fanque born in a workhouse to a family with seven children. Since shortly after Fanque's death in 1871, biographers have disputed his date of birth. Since 2003 biographer Turner has popularized the belief Fanque was born in 1796. The newspaper Era records on 14 May 1871 that Fanque's coffin bore the inscription; \\"AGED 75 YEARS\\".Era, 14 May 1871. Fanque's gravestone, located at the base of his late wife Susannah Darby's grave in Woodhouse Cemetery, Leeds (now St George's Field, part of the University of Leeds), reads; \\"Also the above named William Darby Pablo Fanque who died May 4th 1871 Aged 75 Years\\". But Fanque's age was recorded in the 1841, 1851 and 1871 censuses of England as indicating he was born in 1810. A birth register at St. Andrews Workhouse in Norwich reports the birth of a William Darby to John Darby and Mary Stamp at the workhouse on 1 April 1810. This is the birth year on a blue plaque commemorating Fanque's birth, which was installed by the city of Norwich near the purported location of his childhood residence.Norwich Eastern Daily Press 18 February 2010 \\"-Blue plaque for Norwich man immortalised by the Beatles\\" Genealogists have noted a marriage record of John Darby and Mary Stamp on 27 March 1791 at St. Stephen's, Norwich. Records of children born to Darby and Stamp include John Richard on 4 Jul 1792, Robert on 27 Jul 1794, William on 28 Feb 1796, Mary Elizabeth on 18 Mar 1798, and William on 30 March 1810. The family has two burial records, William on 30 Apr 1797 and Mary Elizabeth on 10 Feb 1801. These indicate that the subject William was born in 1810, the second boy to have been given that name after his late brother died in 1797. Career Fanque at right Based on the 1810 birth year, the young William Darby was apprenticed at age 11 to circus proprietor William Batty and made his first known appearance in a sawdust ring in Norwich on 26 December 1821, as \\"Young Darby.\\" His acts included equestrian stunts and rope walking. Thomas Frost, in Circus Life and Circus Celebrities, wrote, \\"We find Batty in 1836 at Nottingham, with a company which included Pablo Fanque, a negro rope-dancer, whose real name was William Darby ...\\" Once established as a young adult, William Darby changed his professional name to Pablo Fanque. It appears that Fanque or his contemporaries often considered \\"Pablo\\" to be his surname. Fanque made a highly successful London debut in 1847. Describing Fanque and his performance, The Illustrated London News wrote: The Illustrated London News reporting on perhaps an earlier performance during Fanque's 1847 run at London's Astley's Amphitheatre, fills in many biographical details regarding Fanque: This same edition of The Illustrated London News provides an example of how contemporaries regarded his performance: Sounding almost as grand as the boasts of Fanque's own broadside posters, the paper said, \\"Mr. Pablo has trained [his black mare] to do the most extraordinary feats of the 'man√®ge' [note, related to dressage], an art hitherto considered to belong only to the French and German professors of equitation, and her style certainly far exceeds anything that has ever yet been brought from the Continent.\\" An illustration closely resembling the one appearing in the 20 March 1847 edition of The Illustrated London News appears on an 1850s poster advertising Fanque's appearance in Leeds, with the headline, \\"M. Pablo Fanque, as he performed, by royal command, at Astley's Amphitheatre, before her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen.\\" The Hampshire Advertiser documents one instance when Fanque performed before the royal family in Brighton, as part of William Batty's troupe on 3 January 1834.\\"The Hampshire Advertiser\\", 15 February 1834. While Turner cites Fanque's 1847 performance at Astley's as his London debut, the historical record documents an 1834 performance at The Lawns in Croydon, a borough of metropolitan London. A history of The Lawns records an advertisement that read, \\"16th September 1834 ‚Äì A Grand Scottish Fete with a tightrope performance by Pablo Fanque, gymnastics, a leopardess with dogs, military bands, illuminations and fireworks.\\" Also, newspapers from London and Ryde in 1839 and 1840 describe him as already a fixture at Astley's, as part of William Batty's Circus.The Bell's New Weekly Messenger, 14 April 1839. In the 30 years that Fanque operated his own circus (sometimes in partnership with others), he toured England, Scotland, and Ireland, but he performed mostly in the Midlands and the Northern England counties of Yorkshire, Lancashire, and what is now Greater Manchester. Among the many cities he visited were Birmingham, Bolton, Bradford, Bristol, Cambridge, Chester, Chesterfield, Hull, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Norwich, Oldham, Preston, Rochdale, Rotherdam, Ryde, Sheffield, Shrewsbury, Wakefield, Wigan, Wolverhampton, and Worcester. In Scotland, his circus visited Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Paisley. In Edinburgh, in 1853, there was a Pablo Fanque's Amphitheatre on Nicolson Street at the current site of Edinburgh Festival Theatre. In Ireland, Fanque's circus performed at Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Galway, Ballinasloe, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Clonmel, among other places. In Cork, in 1850, Fanque built an amphitheatre on the site of the former Theatre Royal, where the current General Post Office stands (built in 1877). His circus also performed at the Donnybrook Fair in 1850,Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser, 21 August 1850 five years before the centuries' old fair was discontinued. \\"Fanque's children joined his circus. One of his sons performed under the name Ted Pablo ...\\" They performed with the most popular acts of the business, including Young Hernandez (1832‚Äì1861), the great American rider, and the clown Henry Brown (1814‚Äì1902).\\" In the autumn of 1861, famous English prizefighter Jem Mace toured with Fanque's circus. In 1869, the front cover of Illustrated London News reported on a near-tragedy at a performance of Pablo Fanque's Circus in Bolton. Tightrope walker Madame Caroline stumbled on the rope, and hung suspended by her hands in the air. The rope was lowered a few feet and, at the exhortation of men who had amassed below, Madame Caroline let go to fall safely into the hands of the crowd. While some contemporary reports did not refer to Fanque's African ancestry, other reports noted that he was \\"a man of colour,\\" or \\"a coloured gentleman,\\" or \\"an artiste of colour.\\" (These suggest he was of mixed race, with partial European ancestry as well.) In 1905, many years after Fanque's death, the chaplain of the Showmen's Guild wrote, \\"In the great brotherhood of the equestrian world there is no colour- line.\\" He was commenting on Fanque's success in Victorian England despite being of mixed race. Beatles fame right In the mid 20th century, John Lennon, in composing The Beatles' \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,\\" borrowed liberally from an 1843 playbill for Pablo Fanque's Circus Royal. Lennon bought the poster from an antique shop in Sevenoaks, Kent, while shooting a promotional film for the song, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", in Knole Park. Tony Bramwell, a former Apple Records employee, recalled, \\"There was an antique shop close to the hotel we were using in Sevenoaks. John and I wandered in and John spotted this Victorian circus poster and bought it.\\"Steve Turner, A Hard Days Write (Harper Collins: New York, 1994). The poster advertises a performance in Rochdale and announces the appearance of \\"Mr. J. Henderson, the celebrated somerset thrower\\" and \\"Mr. Kite\\" who is described as \\"late of Wells's Circus.\\" Lennon modifies the language, singing instead, \\"The Hendersons will all be there/Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair/What a scene!\\" The title \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" is taken verbatim from the poster. The Mr. Kite referenced in the poster was William Kite, who is believed to have performed in Fanque's circus from 1843 to 1845. : The full text of the original poster is: \\"Mr. J. Henderson\\" was John Henderson, a wire-walker, equestrian, trampoline artist, and clown. While the poster made no mention of \\"Hendersons\\" plural, as Lennon sings, John Henderson did perform with his wife Agnes, the daughter of circus owner Henry Hengler. The Hendersons performed throughout Europe and Russia during the 1840s and 1850s. Other popular references Pablo Fanque is also referenced in the lyrics of the Cockney Rebel song \\"Ritz\\" on the album Psychomodo \\"Come to Pablo Fanque is in Indigo\\". Beneficence The \\"Benefit for Mr. Kite\\" was one of many benefits that Pablo Fanque held for performers in his circus, for others in the profession (who had no regular retirement or health benefits), and for community organizations. Fanque was a member of the Order of Ancient Shepherds, a fraternal organization affiliated with the Freemasons. It assisted families in times of illness or death with burial costs and other expenses. For example, an 1845 show in Blackburn benefitted the Blackburn Mechanics Institution and the Independent Order of Odd-fellows, offering a bonus to the Widows and Orphans Fund. Fanque held a similar benefit in Bury the following year. Writing in 2003, Turner could find nothing in the historical record regarding Fanque's circus activities in 1857 and 1858. But Fanque was active during those years, holding at least two benefits among other performances. In 1857, in Bradford, he held a benefit for the family of the late Tom Barry, a clown. Brenda Assael, in The Circus and Victorian Society, writes that in March 1857, \\"Pablo Fanque extended the hand of friendship to Barry's widow and held a benefit in her husband's name at his Allied Circus in Bradford. Using the Era offices to transmit the money he earned from this event, Fanque enclosed 10 pounds worth of 'post office orders...being the profits of the benefit. I should have been better pleased had it been more, but this was the close of a very dull season.'\\" On 24 October 1858, The Herald of Scotland reported: \\"IN GLASGOW, 'Pablo Fanque's Cirrque Nationale' offered 'A Masonic Benefit.'\\" Britain had abolished slavery in 1834 but it was still a legal institution in the United States when Britons made Fanque such a popular figure. The minutes of Edinburgh's Celtic Lodge No. 291 read, \\"28th February 1853. Deputation to Brother Pablo Fanque‚Äôs Amphitheatre. [A] few of the brethren met this evening in accordance with the resolution of the committee meeting of 23rd inst and accompanied the Right Worshipful Master to Brother Pablo‚Äôs Fanque‚Äôs Amphitheatre to patronage Luin on this occasion of his benefit[.] [T]he Celtic brethren met with several Sister Lodges and had much pleasure to attend.\\" In 1843, when clergy in Burnley were criticized in the Blackburn Mercury for attending performances of Fanque's circus, a reader responded: An 1846 Bolton newspaper story epitomized the public's high regard for Fanque in the communities he visited on account of his beneficence: Partnership with W. F. Wallett During the 1840s and 1850s, Fanque was close friends with the clown W. F. Wallett, who performed in his circus. Wallett also managed Fanque's circus for a time. Wallett frequently promoted himself as \\"the Queen's Jester,\\" having performed once before Queen Victoria in 1844 at Windsor Castle. He appeared with Fanque's circus in Leeds, Wakefield, Oxford, and Glasgow. A benefit was being held for Wallett in Leeds. The amphitheatre balcony when the amphitheatre collapsed, killing Fanque's wife. Wallett's wife was sitting with her but escaped serious injury. Throughout his 1870 autobiography, Wallett shares several amusing anecdotes about his work and friendship with Fanque, including the following about their 1859 engagement in Glasgow: Marriages and family Fanque married Susannah Marlaw, the daughter of a Birmingham buttonmaker. They had two sons, one of whom was named Lionel. On 18 March 1848, his wife died in Leeds at an accident in the building where the circus was performing. Their son was performing a tightrope act before a large crowd at the Amphitheatre at King Charles Croft. The 600 people seated in the gallery fell with its collapse, but Susannah Darby was the only fatality. Heavy planks hit her on the back of the head. Reportedly, Fanque sought medical attention for his wife at the King Charles Hotel, but a surgeon pronounced her dead. Years later a 4 March 1854 edition of the Leeds Intelligencer recalled the incident, while announcing the return of Pablo Fanque's Circus to Leeds: \\"His last visit, preceding the present one, was unfortunately attended by a very melancholy accident. On that occasion he occupied a circus in King Charles's Croft and part of the building gave way during the time it was occupied by a crowded audience. Several persons were more or less injured by the fall of the timbers composing the part that proved too weak, and Mrs Darby, the wife of the proprietor, was killed. This event, which occurred on Saturday the 18th March 1848, excited much sympathy throughout the borough. A neat monument with an impressive inscription is placed above the grave of Mrs Darby, in the Woodhouse Lane Cemetery.\\"Leeds Intelligencer, 4 March 1854, p. 5, col 3. In June 1848, widower Fanque married Elizabeth Corker, a circus rider and daughter of George Corker of Bradford. Corker was 22 years old. With Corker, Fanque had two more sons, George (1854‚Äì1881) and Edward Charles \\"Ted\\" (1855‚Äì1937). Both joined the circus. Ted, known as Ted Pablo, also achieved acclaim as a boxer. A daughter, Caroline Susannah, died aged 1 year and 4 months and is buried in the same plot as Susannah and William, as recorded on the gravestone. The 1861 census records Fanque as living with a woman named Sarah, 25, who is described as his wife. In 1871, just before he died, census records show him living again with his wife Elizabeth and his two sons, in Stockport. In Warriston Cemetery in Edinburgh stands a tombstone dedicated to the memory of two of Fanque's children with Elizabeth Corker‚ÄîWilliam Batty Patrick Darby (13 months) and Elizabeth Darby (3 years). Both died in 1852, Elizabeth in Tuam, Ireland. Fanque performed in Edinburgh in the early 1850s. Death Graves of Susannah and William Darby Grave marker of William Darby Pablo Fanque died of bronchitis at the Britannia Inn at 22 Churchgate in Stockport, England on 4 May 1871. In the funeral procession to Woodhouse Lane Cemetery, Leeds, a band marched ahead of Fanque's hearse playing the \\"Dead March\\". Fanque's favourite horse followed, along with four coaches and mourners. Fanque is buried next to his first wife Susannah Darby. Woodhouse Lane Cemetery is now St. George's Field and part of the University of Leeds campus. While the remains of many of the 100,000 graves and monuments have been relocated, the monument that Fanque erected in his wife's memory, and a smaller modest monument in his memory still stand. Susannah Darby's monument reads: :SACRED :TO THE MEMORY OF :SUSANNAH DARBY :AGED 47 YEARS :THE BELOVED WIFE OF :WILLIAM DARBY, EQUESTRIAN MANAGER :PROFESSIONALLY KNOWN AS :PABLO FANQUE :HER DEATH WAS OCCASIONED BY THE FALLING :OF A PART OF THE CIRCUS ERECTED IN :KING CHARLES' CROFT :LEEDS :ON SATURDAY THE 18TH DAY OF MAY 1848 :HER BEREAVED AND AFFLICTED HUSBAND :HAS CAUSED THIS MONUMENT TO BE ERECTED :ALSO CAROLINE SUSANNAH, THE INFANT DAUGHTER OF WILLIAM :AND ELIZABETH DARBY WHO DIED JANUARY 1ST 1859 :AGED 1 YEAR AND 4 MONTHS :Of such is the kingdom of Heaven.

On 8 October 2010, as part of Light Night ceremony, the Leeds University Union unveiled a blue plaque commemorating Pablo Fanque's final resting place. * Ritz - Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel Legacy *In 2010, Fanque was honoured in his birthplace of Norwich by a commemorative blue plaque on the wall of the John Lewis department store on All Saints Green, believed to be near his birthplace. *Thirty years after Fanque's death, the chaplain of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain, Reverend Thomas Horne, wrote: \\"In the great brotherhood of the equestrian world there is no colour line [bar], for, although Pablo Fanque was of African extraction, he speedily made his way to the top of his profession. The camaraderie of the ring has but one test - ability.\\" *A wood-engraving of Pablo Fanque upon his horse from the 20 March 1847 issue of the Illustrated London News (captioned, ASTLEY'S:MR. PABLO FANQUE, AND HIS TRAINED STEED) appears on the cover of the 2003 book Black Victorians, Black Victoriana, edited by Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina. *In 2008, a gallery named Pablo Fanque opened in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, showcasing limited-edition wearable and small-scale artworks and contemporary collectible jewelry and objects from across Australia and overseas. *Fanque is also mentioned in the song \\"Ritz\\" by the band Cockney Rebel. Others by the same name On 2 November 1865, New Zealand's The West Coast Times reported on the arrival in Hokitika the previous evening from Melbourne, Australia of the ship Gothenburg. The paper stated, \\"She brings to our shores Mr Stevens; English Troupe of acrobats consisting of Mr and Mrs Stevens, the masters Stevens (two), Pablo Fanque and son, Messrs Hatton, Briggs, Rayner, Wilkins, Charles, Wildt, and Master Poono ....\\" This was not the Pablo Fanque of British fame, but Fanque's nephew, William \\"Billy\\" Banham, who used his famous uncle's name as a pseudonym during his time in New Zealand and Australia in the 1850s and 1860s. Fanque's son, Ted Pablo, may have also fought under the name Pablo Fanque in his Australian boxing matches.

As well as requiring photography skills, wildlife photographers may need field craft skills. For example, some animals and birds are difficult to approach and thus a knowledge of the animal's and birds behavior is needed in order to be able to predict its actions. Photographing some species may require stalking skills or the use of a hide/blind for concealment. While wildlife photographs can be taken using basic equipment, successful photography of some types of wildlife requires specialist equipment, such as macro lenses for insects, long focal length lenses for birds and underwater cameras for marine life. However, a great wildlife photograph can also be the result of being in the right place at the right time and often involves a good understanding of animal behavior in order to anticipate interesting situations to capture in photography.  History  In the early days of photography, it was difficult to get a photograph of wildlife due to slow lenses and the low sensitivity of photographic media. Earlier photos of animals were usually pets, stuffed, and zoo animals.http://www.markcarwardine.com/uploads/articles/bbc_wildlife/history_wildlife_photography.pdf These included photos of lion cubs taken at the Bristol zoo in 1854 and in 1864, photos of the last Quagga by Frank Hayes. Wildlife photography gained more traction when faster photography emulsions and quicker shutters came in the 1880s. Developments like these lead to photos such as the ones taken by German Ottomar Anschutz in 1884, the first shots of wild birds in action. In July 1906, National Geographic published its first wildlife photos.http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photographers/first- wildlife-photos.html The photos were taken by George Shiras III, a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania. Some of his photos were taken with the first wire-tripped camera traps.http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photographers/digital- camera-trap-article.html  Definition  The world's three largest photography organisations, the Photographic Society of America, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Art Photographique and the Royal Photographic Society have adopted a common definition for nature and wildlife photography to govern photography competitions, their respective presidents writing in a joint statement, \\"The development of a common definition for nature and wildlife photography will be an important step in helping photographers, many of whom enter competitions internationally, know what the rules are. It will also provide organisers with a very clear definition when they need to deal with the problem of ineligible images.\\"http://rps.org/news/2014/may/nature- definition-agreed Accessed 25 May 2014  Equipment  Equipment for wildlife photography can be very specialized and often uses different lenses and equipment than most other disciplines. Most wildlife lenses have a very long focal length between 150mm and 600mm, allowing the photographer to get a tighter image filling the frame with their chosen subject. However, whilst the majority of wildlife is shot with a telephoto lens, when a wide-angle lens is used, it can provide striking shots of animals within their environment. Some other specialized gear includes camera traps, hides, ghillie suits and flash extenders.

He published extensively on Persian- and Turkic-language history and historiography, and on political, economic and ethnic history in Central Asia and the Muslim world.DeWeese, 1. Biography Yuri Bregel was born in Moscow, the son of Enoch Bregel (1903‚Äì1993), a noted Soviet political economist. When he was sixteen years old, his family relocated to the town of Fergana and in 1943 he joined the Soviet army where he was to serve in an anti-tank artillery unit. He fought in the Crimea, Belorussia, Poland, and Germany; he was injured twice and decorated. After the war, he enrolled at the History department at Moscow University, where he studied Middle Eastern, Central Asian and Islamic history. But in the fall of 1949, Bregel was arrested and imprisoned on charges of \\"anti-Soviet activity.\\" He spent the next five years in a hard labor camp in the northern Urals. Upon his release, he resumed his studies and earned a doctorate at the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow in 1961. In 1955, he was married to Liliya (Liusia) Davydovna Rozenberg, then a doctoral student (and later faculty) at Moscow State University and a specialist on the social and administrative history of Portuguese India in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 1960s and early '70s, Yuri Bregel's scholarship had already gained considerable reputation, having worked on the 10-volume collection and republication of Vasily Bartold's works; on the production of the famed Monuments of the Literature of the East (Pamiatniki pis'mennosti Vostoka) series and the Russian translation and significant expansion of Charles Storey's essential, multi-volume Persian Literature. To these endeavors, Bregel added original scholarship on political, economic and ethnic history of 19th-century Khiva and its Turkmen peoples. In 1974, after some effort in his behalf by international colleagues, Bregel and his family were finally allowed to emigrate to Israel. Bregel joined the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he became an endowed Chair and Professor of the History of the Muslim Peoples. In 1981 he moved to the United States, to Bloomington Indiana, where he joined what was then Indiana University's Department of Uralic and Altaic Studies (later renamed Department of Central Eurasian Studies), augmenting the department's research profile and course offerings in Central Asian history and historiography and in the study of Turkic (Chagatai language) and Persian manuscripts, while also enhancing the Library's holdings of rare primary and secondary sources. Bregel served as Director of Indiana University's Research Institute for Inner Asian Studies from 1986 to 1997, and as Director of Indiana University's Inner Asian and Uralic National Resource Center from 1989 to 1997. He served as consulting editor for the Encyclopaedia Iranica Foundation, senior editor for the Oriental Literature Public House in Moscow, a research fellow at the Institute for Oriental Studies Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and a member of the Association for the Advancement of Central Asian Research and the Association for Central Asian Studies. He authored numerous publications on the medieval and early modern history of Central Asia, including the 3-volume Bibliography of Islamic Central Asia (1995), the edition and translation of the important Khivan chronicle Firdaws al-iqbal (1988 and 1999) and An Historical Atlas of Central Asia (2003), in addition to serving as editor-in-chief of Papers on Inner Asia and many other publications.

In other words, one usually acquires Austrian citizenship if a parent is Austrian, irrespective of place of birth. History During 1812‚Äì1918, citizenship in the Austrian Empire (after 1867 the Austro-Hungarian Empire) was regulated by the Allgemeines b√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch (ABGB) (¬ß¬ß 28-30). The system of Heimatrecht was introduced in 1859, defining citizenship at the municipal level: Heimatrecht in a given municipality guaranteed the right of residence in that municipality and social support for destitute individuals. Suffrage (election of the Imperial Council) for all male citizens with Heimatrecht was introduced in 1906. From 1863, municipalities were obliged to keep a record (Heimatrolle) of all citizens. Most citizens would be registered as members of a parish of the Catholic Church (Pfarrmatrikel); for non-Catholics, a separate register (Zivilmatrikel) was introduced in 1870. Citizenship was granted based on either descent or marriage, or via naturalization after ten years of residence (or on the acquisition of an official function). Citizenship could also be retracted in the case of an absence of longer than two years. By a principle of subsidiarity, citizenship in a municipality implied citizenship in the Crown land of that municipality. General Austrian citizenship (allgemeines √∂sterreichisches Staatsb√ºrgerrecht) for all Cisleithanian Crown lands represented in the Imperial Council was introduced in 1867, with a separate Hungarian citizenship recognized for the lands of the Hungarian Crown.Staatsgrundgesetz √ºber die allgemeinen Rechte der Staatsb√ºrger Artikel 1 festlegte: F√ºr alle Angeh√∂rigen der im Reichsrathe vertretenen K√∂nigreiche und L√§nder besteht ein allgemeines √∂sterreichisches Staatsb√ºrgerrecht. StGBl. Nr. 142 / 1867 (= S. 394). Dieter Gosewinkel: Einb√ºrgern und Ausschlie√üen. Die Nationalisierung der Staatsangeh√∂rigkeit vom Deutschen Bund bis zur Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, G√∂ttingen 2001, , S. 40. The First Austrian Republic recognized all citizens of Republic of German- Austria as Austrian citizens, effective 13 December 1918. Also recognized as citizens were all individuals with permanent residence in the territory of German-Austria since at least 1914. Individuals with Austrian citizenship outside of German-Austria (with the exception of Galicia, Dalmatia and Istria) were given the right to declare themselves German-Austrians and so receive citizenship.StGBl. Nr. 91 / 1918 (= S. 129) The new constitution of 1920 introduced the system of States (Bundesl√§nder). Nationality law was now handled at the State level (Landesb√ºrgerschaft), still tied to municipal citizenship (Heimatrecht) via the subsidiarity principle. A new nationality passed in 1925 permitted naturalization following a period of permanent residence of at least four years. Between 13 March 1938 and 27 April 1945, Austria was part of Germany, and German nationality law applied. Those acquiring Austrian citizenship upon the establishment of the Second Austrian Republic in 1945 generally lost German citizenship on that date. The Republic of Austria was established in 1955, and the current nationality law was originally passed in 1965, and renewed in 1985 to reflect gender equality, introducing perfect symmetry for the acquisition of nationality via marriage by either partner. The law has been updated several times, in 1986, 1988, 1993, 1994, 1997,1998, 2006, 2013 and 2019. Birth in Austria Birth in Austria does not in itself confer Austrian citizenship. However it may lead to a reduction in the residence requirement for naturalisation as an Austrian citizen. Foundlings under the age of 6 months are legally presumed to have Austrian citizenship. Descent from an Austrian parent Children automatically become Austrian citizens at the time of their birth, when the mother is an Austrian citizen. The same applies in case the parents are married and only the father is an Austrian citizen. If the parents are not married and only the father of the child is an Austrian citizen, however the mother is a national of another country, the child acquires Austrian citizenship, when within 8 weeks the Austrian father recognizes his parenthood or the fact that he is the father is determined by court. In all cases where recognition of fatherhood or the determination by court is done after his timeframe, children may be awarded Austrian citizenship in a simplified procedure. If in case of parents of different nationality the country of citizenship of the non-Austrian parent also foresees a jus sanguinis (like Austria), the child will have dual citizenship. According to Austrian law the child does not have to decide between Austrian and the other nationality upon becoming an adult ‚Äì the other state might require such a decision. https://www.migration.gv.at/en/living-and-working-in-austria/integration-and- citizenship/citizenship/#:~:text=Acquisition%20by%20descent,father%20is%20an%20Austrian%20citizen. Naturalization as an Austrian citizen It is possible to apply for Austrian citizenship by naturalization generally after 10 years of continuous residence in Austria. However, in certain cases it is possible to apply earlier. Additional requirements include: * knowledge of the German language 'having due regard to the alien's personal circumstances' * renunciation of foreign citizenship (under the law of the applicant's home country) unless this is impractical This requirement can be waived in exceptional cases. Naturalization as an Austrian citizen based on 10 years of continuous residence is discretionary. =Exemptions to the residence requirement= The residence requirement may be reduced or waived in the following cases: * recognized refugees (6 years) * citizens of other European Economic Area nations (6 years) * persons born in Austria * former citizens of Austria * persons with the knowledge of the German language on level B2 or with proof of substantial personal integration (after 6 years of uninterrupted residence). Entitlement to grant of Austrian citizenship Some persons are entitled to Austrian citizenship by a simpler process than naturalization. Minor children of a person granted Austrian citizenship are most often granted Austrian citizenship as well. =Spouses of Austrian citizens= * The marriage must have lasted for a minimum of 5 years. * The spouse applicant must also have lived in Austria with a settlement permit (Niederlassungsbewilligung) for a minimum of 6 years. This is so far the most restrictive law among all the European Union member countries about the foreign spouses obtaining the member state's citizenship. =Long residence in Austria= A person who has lived in Austria for 30 years, or 15 years in cases of 'sustained personal and occupational integration', is entitled to grant of Austrian citizenship. =Former Austrian citizens= * Former citizens of Austria who lost citizenship other than by renunciation or deprivation may be granted Austrian citizenship after 1 year's residence in Austria. Austrian citizenship must have been possessed for 10 years before it was lost. * A person who lost Austrian nationality as a child (other than by deprivation) may re-acquire it by declaration within 2 years of turning 18. =Stateless persons born in Austria= A stateless person born in Austria may be granted Austrian citizenship within two years of age 18 if (s)he has lived in Austria for a total of 10 years, including 5 years continuously before application. =Appointment to a professorship at an Austrian university= As a result of the fact that appointment to a professorship at an Austrian university or other institute of higher learning entailed being named a state official before the year 2001 3, foreign citizens formerly received Austrian citizenship immediately when they took office, without additionally applying for citizenship, or being compelled to do so 4. Austria's entry into the European Union meant that citizens of other member countries now enjoyed the same rights to access to employment as Austrians (as a consequence of broader European integration). This meant that the automatic conferment of citizenship on professors was valid only for citizens of non-EU states 5. However, since September 1, 2001, postings for university professorships are to be advertised exclusively as private-sector employment 6. Therefore, the requirement of automatic conferment of citizenship on foreign-nationals named to professorships (as found in ¬ß 25 Abs. 1 StbG) was rendered obsolete. This article was therefore determined to be no longer valid by the First Federal Constitutional Cleanup Law (Erstes Bundesverfassungsrechtsbereinigungsgesetz) of January 4, 2008. 7 The regulation for professors (Dienstantritt als Universit√§tsprofessor, ¬ß 25 Abs. 1) was thereby abolished by the revision of the law in 2008. 8 Furthermore, spouses and minor unmarried children of those professors who were still named state officials previously also received Austrian citizenship (¬ß 25 Abs. 2 and 3) by declaring, within one year of the spouse's/parent's acceptance as a citizen, \\"a desire to be a loyal citizen of the Republic\\". In this special case of naturalization, dual citizenship was permitted. A parliamentary survey 9 on the number of people naturalized in this fashion showed that there had been no statistics collected on this point. Loss of Austrian citizenship An Austrian citizen who acquires another citizenship by voluntary action automatically loses Austrian citizenship. The exception is in cases where permission to retain Austrian citizenship has been obtained in advance. This may be difficult to obtain, as the aim of the lawgiver is to reduce the number of dual citizenships granted. Exceptions are made for situations where it is in the interest of the Republic of Austria to grant this dual citizenship (e.g. when somebody is a celebrity in arts, sports, science, economy etc.), or in situations where the citizen would suffer hardship due to not having the second citizenship. If, for example, an Austrian citizen wants to obtain U.S. citizenship because he/she lives in the U.S. and, without a U.S. citizenship, would lose their green card due to being made to travel more than 180 days per year by their employer, then if they apply for permission to retain Austrian citizenship, that request is usually granted and has become almost a formality. The important part is that the application to retain Austrian citizenship is made before acquiring another citizenship. Otherwise the Austrian citizenship is automatically lost the moment a person obtains a foreign citizenship. The law can change at any time, however, especially should the power in the Austrian parliament shift dramatically after an election and a party opposed to the current law regains absolute majority. Austrian citizenship is also automatically lost by serving in a foreign army. =Restoration of lost Austrian citizenship to Holocaust survivors and their descendants= From 1 September 2020 there will be provisions for Austrian Jews and any other Austrian citizens, including residents of the country that were stateless or citizens of successor states of Austria-Hungary at the time, who left Austria before 15 May 1955 because they had either suffered persecution by the Nazi regime or had reason to fear such persecution, as well as those who had suffered persecution because of their support of democracy in Austria or had reason to fear such persecution, will be able to have their citizenship restored, while retaining any other citizenship they have since acquired. In addition, any direct descendants of those persons, including those adopted as minors, will be able to claim Austrian citizenship, without giving up any existing citizenship, and whether or not their ancestors have regained or claimed Austrian citizenship.https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-embassy-london/service-for- citizens/identity-papers-and-other-documents/citizenship-certificate/ Dual citizenship A certificate of retention of Austrian citizenship, issued to an Austrian citizen acquiring Australian citizenship. Austrian law substantially restricts dual citizenship. In general, only the following categories of Austrian citizens may possess a foreign nationality: * those acquiring another nationality at birth, such as children born to Austrian parents in another country, thus automatically gaining citizenship of that country, or those born with an Austrian and a foreign parent. * naturalized Austrian citizens who are unable to renounce their existing nationality. * those who acquire Austrian citizenship on the basis of being appointed a professor at an Austrian university. *Natural born Austrian Citizen (Austrian citizen born in Austria or Born abroad to Austrian parents) or Austrian citizen by birth naturalizing or being born in an Jus soli country (e.g. Usa, Canada and Mexico) *Natural born citizen of the other country (Other countries citizens by birth, Jus soli,e.g. Usa, Canada or Mexico or descent) in some cases don't need to renounce their previous citizenship *Austrians naturalizing in German speaking countries specified as Germany, Lichtenstein, Belgium and Switzeland are sometimes exempted to have a permission or renounce their Austrian citizenship * Austrian citizens who naturalize in another country with permission obtained to retain Austrian citizenship (de: Beibehaltung der Staatsb√ºrgerschaft). A famous example is actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger, who naturalised as a US citizen but was granted special permission to retain his Austrian citizenship. * Victims of Nazi persecution and their descendants. * In special circumstances, like for actor Christoph Waltz, born in Vienna, where he also went to school and studied drama, who holds a German passport like his father, although his mother is Austrian. He has been granted Austrian citizenship in September 2010 after being awarded an Oscar in March for Best Actor in Tarantino's \\"Inglourious Basterds\\". The immediate approval of his citizenship application, however, fueled the debate on Austria's immigration and citizenship policies that are regarded as heavily biased in favor of celebrity. Citizenship of the European Union Because Austria forms part of the European Union, Austrian citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Austrian embassy, Austrian citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK), Belize (UK), Central African Republic (France), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK), Guyana (UK), Liberia (Germany), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor- Leste (Portugal), Vanuatu (France) Austrian citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty. Visa free travel Visa requirements for Austrian citizens Visa requirements for Austrian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Austria. In 2017, Austrian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 173 countries and territories, ranking the Austrian passport 4th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Belgian, British, Dutch, French, Luxembourgish, Norwegian and Singaporean passports) according to the Henley visa restrictions index. The Austrian nationality is ranked tenth in Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.

The character also appears in the film sequels Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and Thunderbird 6 (1968), the 2004 live-action film Thunderbirds and the CGI remake series Thunderbirds Are Go. In the world of Thunderbirds, Penelope is employed by the secret organisation International Rescue as its London field agent. The puppet character of the TV series and first two films were voiced by Sylvia Anderson. In the live-action film, she was portrayed by Sophia Myles, while in the remake series she is voiced by Rosamund Pike. Background The original puppet character was devised with transatlantic viewers in mind. In a 2014 interview, Thunderbirds co-creator Sylvia Anderson explained: \\"I said to myself, 'What do the Americans think of us Brits? They think we're either Cockneys or posh ladies in stately homes. OK, that's what we'll give them.' So you've got Parker, the Cockney chauffeur, and Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, who lives this glamorous life in her big house.\\" Anderson also said that she made Penelope a secret agent as she \\"loved the idea of an adventurous secret life.\\" She compared Penelope favourably to the women characters of APF's earlier puppet series, which in her words \\"were just there to look good\\", adding that when the company moved on to Thunderbirds \\"the role of women was changing, and I knew Lady Penelope had to be up there with the boys.\\" In her autobiography, she said that she wrote the character to convey \\"not only the daring and panache of a secret agent, but also the poise of a cool and beautiful aristocrat\\".Anderson 1991, p. 30 Penelope would ultimately be modelled on and voiced by Anderson. The original template for the character was a model in Vogue magazine. However, after a number of test sculptures were rejected, designer Mary Turner instead chose to base the look on Anderson herself (a decision of which Anderson was not immediately apprised).La Rivi√®re, p. 108.La Rivi√®re, p. 109.Marriott, p. 154. Interviewed by the Daily Mirror in 1968, Turner commented: \\"We wanted a glamorous blonde and [Anderson] was the obvious choice.\\"Anderson 1991, p. 44 The character's attire was inspired by contemporary Carnaby Street and Parisian fashions, with Vogue and Harper's magazines used as points of reference.Marriott, p. 121. Silks, leathers and furs were supplied by London department stores such as Liberty and Dickins & Jones. During the production of the 2004 live-action film, actress Sophia Myles had a movement director to help her give the character a graceful walk. In an interview with Starburst magazine, Myles said that her interpretation of the character was not based on a particular person, but was instead the result of \\"drawing all the fantastic elements from the original and adding my own personal twists to make it my own.\\" Character biography Born on 24 December 2000 or 2039, Lady Penelope is the 26-year-old daughter of aristocrat Lord Hugh Creighton-Ward and his wife, Amelia. The early years of her life were spent at Creighton-Ward Mansion. Later, her father was requested by the government to travel to India to organise a tea-growing community. The Indian climate did not agree with Penelope, so she returned without her parents to England, where she was put into the care of a governess, Miss Pemberton, with whom she quickly bonded. At the age of eleven, Penelope was sent to the prestigious Roedean School. She excelled in many subjects and became very popular among her peers; she was later elected head girl. Upon leaving Roedean, Penelope attended a finishing school in Switzerland. Here, she became a skilled skier and linguist, being able to speak fluent French, German and Italian. On the outside, Lady Penelope is just another member of the British high society, as well as a fashion icon. However, after completing her education in Buckinghamshire, she rejected the aristocracy's endless round of social engagements and became a secret agent. It was while working as the chief operative of the Federal Agents Bureau (FAB) that Penelope first met Jeff Tracy, the founder of International Rescue, and immediately accepted his invitation to become IR's field agent in London. In the episode \\"Vault of Death\\" it is shown she is not a very good driver. Penelope is stylish and fashionable in every aspect of her life. She is a world-renowned supermodel and celebrity and has appeared on the cover of Chic magazine. Her clothes are specially created for her by top fashion designers such as Elaine Wickfern and Fran√ßois Lemaire, who named a revolutionary new fabric \\"Penelon\\" after her. She wears an exclusive perfume called \\"Soup√ßon de P√©ril\\", mixed for her by Jacques Verre. Whenever Penelope is in Paris, she always drinks Pernod. She takes tea almost religiously and can communicate with International Rescue via her Regency teapot. =Appearances= * \\"Trapped in the Sky\\" * \\"The Perils of Penelope\\" * \\"Day of Disaster\\" * \\"30 Minutes After Noon\\" * \\"Vault of Death\\" * \\"The Mighty Atom\\" * \\"The Impostors\\" * \\"The Man from MI.5\\" * \\"Danger at Ocean Deep\\" * \\"The Duchess Assignment\\" * \\"Brink of Disaster\\" * \\"The Cham-Cham\\" * \\"Security Hazard\\" (in flashback footage) * \\"Atlantic Inferno\\" * \\"Path of Destruction\\" * \\"Alias Mr. Hackenbacker\\" * \\"Lord Parker's 'Oliday\\" * \\"Give or Take a Million\\" * Thunderbirds Are Go * Thunderbird 6 =Retinue, vehicles and property= Lady Penelope's butler and chauffeur is Aloysius \\"Nosey\\" Parker. Born on 30 May 2013, he is descended from a long line of Cockney retainers who have served the British aristocracy for centuries. However, finding it difficult to obtain a stable job, Parker fell in with the criminals of the London underworld. He secured a reputation as the world's foremost safe- cracker and cat-burglar, which resulted in his serving a sentence at Parkmoor Scrubs Prison. Following his release, he quickly returned to his criminal ways, and was discovered by Penelope while attempting to crack the safe of an oil tycoon. Penelope had learned of Parker's talents and offered him a partnership in her spy work for International Rescue. He is now a loyal and indispensable assistant to Penelope and IR. \\"Give or Take a Million\\" is the only episode of the series in which Penelope appears without Parker. Lilian (or Lil, as she is known by Parker) is Penelope's cook. She has a sizeable repertoire of dishes, much to Parker's disgust. Perce is the gardener for the Creighton-Ward estate and a friend of Parker. Penelope owns a six-wheeled Rolls-Royce called FAB 1, painted in her trademark shade of pink. The vehicle is driven by Parker. FAB 1 is equipped with various features to assist Penelope's field operative work, such as machine guns, bulletproof glass, water skis for sea excursions and radar-assisted steering. Penelope also owns a private yacht named FAB 2, a champion racehorse named FAB 3, and Seabird, a cruise ship. Several Seabirds have been constructed, since they are frequently destroyed in use. The seat of the Creighton-Ward dynasty is Creighton-Ward Mansion, an 18th-century stately home in Foxleyheath, Kent. The first mansion was built on the site of a Norman castle by the first Lord Creighton-Ward after he was knighted by Elizabeth I, who was a regular visitor. The current mansion was built by Lord Cuthbert Creighton-Ward in 1730 after he burned down the previous house during a gunpowder experiment. Lord Cuthbert asked architect Colen Campbell to design the iconic Palladian edifice, which has been designated a Grade I listed building by the World Heritage Organisation. When Penelope became a secret agent, she renovated the historic building to better suit her double lifestyle by installing a satellite antenna, a number of two-way video communication consoles for contacting International Rescue, and a safe with state-of-the-art alarm system and CCTV. A forensic laboratory was built on the site of old servants' quarters. An underground river with a boat runs beneath the estate, and if Penelope thinks that Creighton-Ward Mansion is under surveillance or that she is in danger, she can meet Parker at a nearby village without anyone knowing. Penelope also owns Bonga Bonga, a sheep station in the Australian outback housing 200,007 sheep. The property was acquired by Bertie \\"Buster\\" Creighton-Ward. The open-plan lounge, with its modern fabrics and simple geometric designs, is in sharp contrast to the detail of Creighton-Ward Mansion. =Penelon= \\"Penelon\\" was created by fashion designer Fran√ßois Lemaire, who named it in honour of his favourite model, Lady Penelope. This fabric has extraordinary properties: Penelon can be converted into any costume design, squeezed into a space the size of a match box and be fashioned to resemble any other material. The fabric is sought after by Lemaire's rivals, and after Penelope discovers that they have bugged his office, she suggests that the unveiling of Lemaire's new all-Penelon collection be held on board the aircraft Skythrust, designed by International Rescue's engineer, Brains. Reception The original character has been well received. Starburst magazine calls Penelope one of the series' \\"best-loved characters\\". According to Angus Allan, Penelope and Parker \\"became a cult in themselves.\\" Commenting on the Thunderbirds cast, writer John Peel singles out Penelope for particular praise, referring to her as the \\"one character in the show who positively shone\\". He approves of her characterisation as a secret agent obliged to play the role of a \\"bored aristocrat\\", identifying parallels with male literary characters such as James Bond, Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel. Commentator Bill Osgerby argues that Penelope and Parker were added to the series to \\"play up to American perceptions of the British class system\\", noting Penelope's status as an \\"aristocratic amateur\\" in contrast with the \\"meritocratic professionals\\" embodied by the Tracy men. He also describes the character as a \\"pop feminist\\" and an \\"emblem of Swinging Sixties femininity\\", comparing her to Emma Peel and Modesty Blaise. Anderson argued that the character \\"broke the mould\\" for depictions of women in children's television. She also believed that after Penelope's early appearances, in which she played more of a supporting role, the character quickly rose to prominence: \\"All the heroines in our previous series had been perfect foils to the action-man heroes, but now, with Lady Penelope, we had an action girl who was a personality in her own right.\\" When Thunderbirds was repeated on the BBC in the early 2000s, the character was criticised for smoking, wearing furs and not using seat belts in cars.\\"Lady Penelope in the Dock\\", BBC News Online: Entertainment, 28 February 2001, retrieved 20 April 2011. Anderson commented that smoking and fur-wearing in particular were likely to be viewed by modern audiences as politically incorrect, calling them two of several \\"stereotyped prejudices\\" in Thunderbirds.Anderson 2007, p. 102. She elaborated: \\"We were limited by the age in which we lived, and although we prided ourselves on setting new boundaries, I suppose we were too obsessed with the Space Age, nuclear power and their consequences to be more aware of green and other more down-to-earth issues.\\" Brian Viner writes that the character smoked \\"with the √©lan of Grace Kelly\\". In a negative preview of the live-action film, XPos√© magazine commented that Penelope seemed to have \\"turned into Barbara Cartland, as though someone's decided that her defining character trait is the colour pink.\\" Other appearances Lady Penelope, again voiced by Sylvia Anderson, appeared to the character of Edina Monsoon in a dream sequence in \\"Hospital\\", a 1994 episode of the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous. Also in 1994, Virgin Atlantic named its first Boeing 747-400 after Lady Penelope; the aircraft's registration, inspired by FAB 1, was G-VFAB.

The village is made up of the former separate hamlets of Salkeld Gate and Brockleymoor and consists mainly of houses along a minor road connecting the A6 to the B5305 near Skelton and also a few houses and farms along the A6 itself. Close by are the settlements of Plumpton Head, Plumpton Foot and Plumpton Street. The earthwork remains of a substantial Roman fort can be seen at Castlesteads Farm, alongside the A6 road just north of the village. The fort was known in antiquity as Voreda. The A6 follows the course of the Roman road from Carlisle to Brougham. The village has an Anglican church, (St John the Evangelist by Robert LorimerDictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer), a primary school, caf√© and garden centre (the Pot Place), however the Post Office closed in 2016. During the daytimes on Mondays to Saturdays there is a half-hourly bus service to Penrith and Carlisle which has a reduced service in the evenings and on Sundays. Plumpton (Cumbria) railway station was opened by the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway on 17 December 1846. It lay on the West Coast Main Line but after ownership by the London and North Western Railway and the London Midland and Scottish Railway it was closed by British Railways on 31 May 1948 soon after nationalisation. Plumpton is within the civil parish of Hesket but was from 1866 to 1934 a separate parish under the name of Plumpton Wall. Before that it was a chapelry or township of Lazonby parish. The nearby areas of Plumpton Head, Plumpton Street and Plumpton Foot were not part of Plumpton parish but in Penrith or Hesket-in-the-Forest parishes.

The 1913 Liberty Head nickel is an American five-cent piece which was produced in extremely limited quantities unauthorized by the United States Mint, making it one of the best-known and most coveted rarities in American numismatics. In 1972, one specimen of the five cent coin became the first coin to sell for over US$100,000; in 1996, another specimen became the first to sell for over US$1 million. In 2003, one coin was sold for under three million dollars. In 2010, the Olsen piece sold for US$3.7 million at a public auction. Only five examples are known to exist: two in museums and three in private collections.  Origin  The Indian Head (Buffalo) nickel was introduced in February 1913, replacing the Liberty Head design. These were the first official strikings of nickels in 1913, since the United States Mint's official records list no Liberty Head nickels produced in that year. However, in 1920, the numismatic community learned of five Liberty Head nickels dated 1913, all owned by Samuel Brown, a numismatist who attended the American Numismatic Association's annual convention in 1920 and displayed the coins there. He had previously placed an advertisement in the December 1919 issue of The Numismatist soliciting information on these coins, offering to pay US $500 for each and ostensibly purchasing them as a result. However, Brown had been a Mint employee in 1913, and many numismatic historians have concluded that he may have struck them himself (or had them struck) and taken them from the Mint. If true, this was not a unique occurrence; such clandestine strikes were quite common in the 19th century, with the Class II and III 1804 silver dollars perhaps the best- known instance. Other numismatic authorities, such as Q. David Bowers, have questioned this scenario, and pointed out that there are several methods by which the coins could have been legitimately produced; e.g., they may have been lawfully issued by the Mint's Medal Department \\"for cabinet purposes,\\" or could have been struck as trial pieces in late 1912 to test the following year's new coinage dies. Bowers, however, did not entirely discount the private minting theory.  Pedigree  In January 1924, Samuel Brown sold all five 1913 Liberty Head nickels. The intact lot passed through the hands of several other coin dealers before finally being purchased by Colonel E. H. R. Green (son of the famous Gilded Age investor and miser Hetty Green), who kept them in his collection until his death in 1936. His estate was then auctioned off, and the five 1913 Liberty Head nickels were purchased by two dealers, Eric P. Newman and B. G. Johnson, who broke up the set for the first time.  Eliasberg specimen  Eliasberg specimen is the finest known 1913 Liberty Head nickel. Of the five 1913 Liberty Head nickels, two have proof surfaces and the other three were produced with standard striking techniques. The Eliasberg specimen is the finest known 1913 Liberty Head nickel, with a grade of 66 from various professional grading services, including PCGS and NGC. This coin was purchased from Newman and Johnson by the Numismatic Gallery, a coin dealership that then sold it to famed collector Louis Eliasberg. It remained in Eliasberg's comprehensive collection until after his death. In May 1996, it was sold at an auction conducted by Bowers and Merena to rarities dealer Jay Parrino for US$1,485,000: the highest price for a coin up until that point. When it was auctioned again in March 2001, the price climbed to US$1,840,000. In May 2005, Legend Numismatics purchased the Eliasberg specimen for US$4,150,000. In 2007, it was sold to an unnamed collector in California for US$5 million.  Olsen specimen  The Olsen specimen 1913 liberty nickelWhile the Eliasberg specimen is the best preserved of the five coins, the Olsen specimen is almost certainly the most famous. It has been graded Proof-64 by both PCGS and NGC, and was featured on an episode of Hawaii Five-O (\\"The $100,000 Nickel,\\" aired on December 11, 1973). It was also briefly owned by King Farouk of Egypt. When Newman and Johnson broke up the set of five coins, the Olsen specimen was sold first to James Kelly and then to Fred Olsen. The latter sold the coin to Farouk, but his name has remained attached to it in numismatic circles ever since. In 1972, it was sold to World Wide Coin Investments for US$100,000, thus inspiring its title appearance in Hawaii Five-O the following year. Its price doubled to US$200,000 when it was resold to Superior Galleries in 1978. It has been resold on several occasions since then, fetching US$3,000,000 in a private treaty sale from California collector Dwight Manley to Bruce Morelan and Legend Numismatics in June 2004. Legend sold the coin to Blanchard and Co. in 2005, who sold it to a private collector, and more recently for US$3,737,500 by Heritage Auctions in January 2010. The latest owner's name has not been disclosed.  Norweb specimen  The Norweb specimen is one of two 1913 Liberty Head nickels that have ended up in museums. It is on exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution. Newman and Johnson sold the Norweb specimen to F.C.C. Boyd, who then resold it to the Numismatic Gallery (which handled several of the coins over the years). In 1949, it was purchased by King Farouk to replace the Olsen specimen, which he had sold. It remained in Farouk's collection until he was deposed by Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1952. Two years after that, Farouk's possessions were all auctioned off by the new regime. The Numismatic Gallery regained possession of it, and sold it this time to Ambassador Henry Norweb and his wife. The Norwebs donated the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution‚Äôs National Numismatic Collection- where it remains \\\\- in 1978 to commemorate their sixtieth wedding anniversary.Montgomery, 2005, pp. 147, 148  Walton specimen  The Walton specimen is the most elusive of the five 1913 Liberty Head nickels; for over 40 years, its whereabouts were unknown and it was believed to have been lost. George O. Walton, for whom the specimen is named, purchased it from Newman and Johnson in 1945 for approximately US$3,750, equal to $ today. On March 9, 1962, Walton died in a car crash en route to a coin show. He had promised the show's promoters that he would exhibit the 1913 Liberty Head nickel there, so it was assumed to have been among the coins in his possession at the time of the fatal crash. US$250,000 worth of coins were recovered from the crash site, including the 1913 Liberty nickel, which was protected in a custom-made holder. When Walton's heirs put his coins up for public auction in 1963, the nickel was returned to them, because the auction house had mistakenly determined the coin to be not genuine. As a result, the coin remained in the family's possession, being stored in a strongbox on the floor of a closet in his sister's home, for over 40 years. In July 2003, the American Numismatic Association arranged to display the four specimens whose whereabouts were known. As a publicity stunt, public relations consultant and former ANA governor Donn Pearlman launched a nationwide hunt for the missing fifth specimen. He arranged with Bowers and Merena auction house (at the time a division of Collectors Universe, Inc.) to offer a minimum US$1 million to purchase the coin, or as a guarantee for consigning it to one of their public auctions. In addition, a US$10,000 reward was offered simply for letting representatives of Bowers and Merena be the first to see the missing fifth specimen when found. After learning about the reward, the Walton heirs brought their coin to the ANA convention in Baltimore, where expert authenticators from Professional Coin Grading Service examined it at length and compared it to the other four known specimens. At that time, it was determined that the Walton specimen was genuine. The coin was sold at auction by the heirs in April 2013 for US$3,172,500, significantly above an estimated value of US$2,500,000.Rare 1913 nickel fetches more than $3.1M at auction The auction buyers, Jeff Garrett, (former ANA President) and owner of Mid-American Rare Coin Galleries in Lexington, Kentucky, partnering with esteemed numismatist, Larry Lee, put it on display at Lee‚Äôs store, Coin & Bullion Reserves in Panama City, Florida. It stayed there, on display for five years, viewed by legions of visitors. In June 2018 Garrett and Lee sold the 1913 Walton, in a private treaty sale reported to be between $3 and $4 million, to Martin Burns, a lawyer from Las Vegas and his brother Ron Firman, of Miami. PCGS reauthenticated the coin and sealed it a current PCGS Secure slab (holder). The brothers then arranged for the Walton specimen to come back to the ANA museum, where it has been since July 2018.  McDermott specimen  Held by the American Numismatic Association's Money Museum, the McDermott specimen has the distinction of being the only 1913 Liberty Head nickel with circulation marks on it. Johnson and Newman sold it to James Kelly, who then sold it to J.V. McDermott, whose name ended up as part of the coin's pedigree. He often carried the coin around with him, showing it off to bar patrons and boasting of its extraordinary rarity and value. The coin lost some of its original mint luster in the process, and McDermott eventually protected it in a holder to prevent further wear. After his death, the coin was then sold at auction to Aubrey Bebee in 1967 for US$46,000, who along with his wife donated it to the ANA in 1989, where it is exhibited in the Money Museum.

It is an unnavigable right tributary of the Neckar. It rises in the L√∂wenstein Mountains and after distance and elevation drop flows into the Neckar at Bad Friedrichshall, near Untereisesheim and Neckarsulm. Its valley together with its tributary valleys is also known as the Weinsberg Valley (Weinsberger Tal), after Weinsberg, which is located there. The medieval region of Sulmgau, as well as the city of Neckarsulm, were named for it. The upper valley of the Sulm is a protected area.  Geography  The Sulm rises south of L√∂wenstein at the edge of the L√∂wenstein Mountains. It originates in several brooks, and which brook specifically constitutes the source is subject to interpretation. One such brook which has three points of origin and sometimes termed the Sauklinge is marked as the source by a sign. One of the tributaries of the stream while it is still small is fed by an artificial lake called the Bleichsee. This is located between the watersheds of the Sulm and the Schozach and maintained by dams; the Buchbach, which rises at an altitude of and flows into it via an old mill stream, would otherwise be a tributary of the Schozach, but the stretch of it between the Bleichsee and the Sulm, or sometimes its entire length, is sometimes attributed to the Sulm, in which case the overall length of the Sulm becomes . The name Sulm is indisputably attached to the river that proceeds from the confluence near State Road 1111 of the Sauklinge and the brook flowing from the Bleichsee. From that point it flows north on the edge of the Teusserbad section of L√∂wenstein and past Castle Lautereck, built in 1623; it is in an underground culvert for a short stretch crossing the property of the Teusser company. It then turns east and flows past the Rittelhof section of L√∂wenstein. South of Bundestra√üe 39 it feeds a mill pond at the Seem√ºhle, the last of what were originally 3 mills serving L√∂wenstein. After passing under the B39, at an altitude of approximately , it is dammed to form the Breitenauer See, an artificial lake or detention basin in area which was created in 1975-80 for flood control. The majority of this lake lies within the territory of Obersulm. Northwest of the Weiler section of Obersulm, the former bed of the Sulm is now fed only by springs and drainage discharge pipes, while the river flows under the dam in a culvert to a point north of the Weiler-Affaltrach road, where it flows into the old mill stream of the Affaltrach mill and after a few dozen metres into the Schlierbach, a tributary via which it rejoins the original riverbed a few metres further on. The Sulm then turns west-northwest, flowing through the Affaltrach and Willsbach sections of Obersulm. Willsbach is situated in the S√ºlzbach valley on its right bank. The Sulm flows along the north-east edge of Ellhofen, under the Hohenlohe Railway, and then directly north-west through the territory of Weinsberg, although it does not pass through the town itself. At Weinsberg it is initially channelled through the Weinsberg motorway interchange, where the A 6 and A 81 cross. Until 1971, this was the location of a mill which was removed when the interchange was built; the Hasenm√ºhle mill remains beside the river north-west of that point. Below the confluence of the Wei√üenhofbach, within the territory of Erlenbach but to the east of the town itself, there is a flood-control basin. The Sulm at the S√ºlzbach section of Obersulm The river continues its flow northwest toward Neckarsulm, passing on its right bank Erlenbach and the Binswangen section of that town. The valley bottom is half a kilometer wide at this point and is spanned by the dam of a further flood control basin. Leaving the town, the bed of the Sulm has been straightened where it passes through the Sulmtalpark, which was created in 1975. Within the territory of Neckarsulm, there were previously mills along its course; the N√§herm√ºhle, at the city border, was removed in 1988. At this point the Sulm previously flowed in a wide curve to the north and then the west through the grounds of the NSU Motorenwerke plant; following two floods in 1970, it was diverted into a culvert in 1973-75\\\\. It now flows underground for more than and at the border between Neckarsulm and Bad Friedrichshall at the Neckar Canal, this section of which was completed in 1925, is piped under the canal. A little upstream of the canal, the Sulm can be seen in a maintenance channel several metres below. Confluence of the Sulm (left) and the Neckar On the west side of the Neckar Canal, the river re-emerges on the 'island' between the canal and the former channel of the Neckar and flows for approximately through Bad Friedrichshall territory immediately north of the border with Untereisesheim before emptying into the Neckar across from the southern part of Untereisesheim, at an altitude of . = Catchment area = The watershed of the Sulm comprises and is bordered by the watersheds of the Brettach to the north and east, the Schozach to the southwest and the Murr to the southeast. Its major tributaries (with the location of their confluence) are on the right: the Schlierbach (Affaltrach in Obersulm), the Michelbach (Affaltrach), the Seeb√§chle (Willsbach in Obersulm), the S√ºlzbach (S√ºlzbach in Obersulm), and the Wei√üenhofbach (in its upper reaches called the Eberbach; above Erlenbach); and on the left: the Hambach (Willsbach in Obersulm), the Ellbach (Ellhofen), and the Stadtseebach, Saubach, or Weinsbergerbach (Erlenbach).  History  Former N√§herm√ºhle mill, on the edge of Neckarsulm, photographed around 1900 Hasenm√ºhle mill, by the motorway interchange at Weinsberg Bleichsee, an artificial lake constructed as a flood retention basin on a tributary of the Sulm The earliest archaeological traces of settlement in the Sulm valley are from the Neolithic. Numerous finds in the Willsbach section of Obersulm suggest a permanent settlement. A Roman settlement has been shown to have existed in Weinsberg, and a Roman road ran through the Sulm valley connecting the forts on the limes at B√∂ckingen in Heilbronn and at √ñhringen. Subsequently, Alemanni and Franks settled the valley. The first recorded mention of the name Sulm is in a 771 charter of Lorsch Abbey in which Neckarsulm is referred to as . It probably derives from an Ablaut form of the Germanic *swalm, \\"surge\\". It also gave its name to the medieval gau of Sulmgau, recorded as Sulmanachgowe in charters of the 770s and 780s. Since the river is not navigable, for years its main economic importance was driving mills, of which there were more than 20 on the Sulm and its tributaries between L√∂wenstein and Neckarsulm. Since millers often had the right to create mill ponds, they sometimes also created fishing pools, some of which still exist. Mill races provided the necessary water gradient to drive the mills. The mill race which fed the Affaltrach mill survives, although for the most part dry; the mill race of the Willsbach mill, which fell over a length of more than was closed in 1963 and filled in in 1972. Both mills, and that on the Schlierbach in the Weiler section of Obersulm, are still in operation but no longer water-powered. NSU Motorenwerke originated in a sewing machine company that began operations in 1880 at the Brunnersche M√ºhle, a sawmill and gypsum mill in Neckarsulm, and used the river for power. In 1980-2003, the flow of the Sulm at Erlenbach averaged per second. Prior to the flood control measures on the upper Sulm, during one high water on 18 June 1978, it reached almost per second. Floods occurred regularly, were exacerbated by increasing ground sealing, and presented a problem for the industries located between the Sulm and the Neckar in Neckarsulm. After two high waters in February and May 1970 flooded the Audi NSU plant, which was of great economic importance to Neckarsulm and the region, and led to a 14-day interruption of production, the State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg decided to institute flood-control measures. In 1973, the Wasserverband Sulm (Sulm Water Authority) was founded; this is headquartered in Weinsberg and the district and city of Heilbronn and all towns and settlements along the Sulm and its tributaries are members, including Bad Friedrichshall, Bretzfeld, Eberstadt, Lehrensteinsfeld und Oedheim. Earlier plans to culvert the river in Neckarsulm were carried out in 1973-75, and in November 1974 a retention basin was completed on the eastern edge of Neckarsulm, where it borders Erlenbach. The Sulm now flows underground for through Neckarsulm until it crosses under the Neckar Canal. In 1975-80, the Breitenauer See was constructed as a central flood control basin in the Sulm valley, and additional retention basins were constructed along the Sulm and its major tributaries during the remaining decades of the 20th century. These measures have considerably mitigated flood damage, for example during a heavy rainfall on 5 July 2006 of up to per square metre. , 15 of a planned total of 17 retention basins have been completed. Costs were estimated at 10.2 million euro in 1973; total costs are currently estimated at 36 million euro. Environment The lower Sulm has been extensively channelled and culverted, the upper Sulm less so. However, its course has been altered even in some of the upper reaches. For example, in 1950 it was regularised' in Willsbach, and in 1963 in Affalbach, its tributary the Michelbach was culverted because of the smell of the polluted water. Over almost its entire course, the hydromorphological condition of the river is assessed as impaired or removed from its natural state. Its water quality was assessed in 2004 as relatively impaired (Class II), but in immediate proximity to the source, slightly impaired (Class I-II).m√§√üig belastet, gering belastet. Map: Since 1979, the upper Sulm valley has been designated as a protected area, Oberes Sulmtal mit Randh√∂hen, and it lies within the Swabian-Franconian Forest Nature Park. The Bleichsee on one of its tributaries, which has been protected since 1978, is one of the most important spawning areas for amphibians in the district of Heilbronn. When the Breitenauer See was created, much accommodation was made for nature: parts of the lake are closed to human use, shallows were created for fish to spawn, and over 100,000 trees, bushes, and shrubs were planted to provide an environment for the approximately 140 local bird species, some of which are rare.

Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of Rev. Myron A. Johnson, Arthur Vaughan Johnson left college at 19 to join a traveling Shakespearean troupe. He later appeared on stage with Sol Smith Russell, Robert B. Mantell and Marie Wainwright. Johnson began as a film actor in 1905 with the Edison Studios in The Bronx, New York, appearing in the one-reel drama The White Caps directed by Wallace McCutcheon, Sr., and Edwin S. Porter. In 1908, he went to work for Biograph Studios, where he acted in films directed by D.W. Griffith including Resurrection (1909) and In Old California (1910), the first movie Griffith ever shot in Hollywood. At Biograph, Arthur Johnson performed with stars such as Mary Pickford and Florence Lawrence. Johnson was reputed to be Griffith's favorite actor. In 1911 he accepted an offer from Lubin Studios in Philadelphia that allowed him to direct as well as act. With Lottie Briscoe, his frequent co-star at Lubin, Johnson directed and starred in The Belov√©d Adventurer (1914), a 15 episode serial by Emmett Campbell Hall. After performing in more than three hundred silent film shorts and directing twenty-six, health problems ended his career in 1915. According to an interview published nine months before his death, Arthur V. Johnson married actress Maude Webb when he was 20 years old; the couple had a daughter who lived with Johnson's parents. Other sources indicate that around 1910 he married Florence Hackett, with whom he appeared in the 1913 film Power of the Cross. He died of tuberculosis in Philadelphia in 1916, a few weeks short of his fortieth birthday. Johnson's funeral services were held in Philadelphia and his remains later interred at Fairview Cemetery, Chicopee, Massachusetts. Nearby stands Grace Episcopal Church, where his father once served as rector. Selected filmography Florence Lawrence peeps through curtains to look at Arthur V.

Pelsall is located approximately two miles from the larger towns of Bloxwich and Brownhills, and is on the border of Cannock Chase near Norton Canes. Pelsall is also seven miles from the nearby city of Lichfield and a similar distance to Wolverhampton. Walsall is around three miles away.  History  Pelsall was first mentioned in a charter of 994, when it was among various lands given to the monastery at Heantune (Wolverhampton) by Wulfrun, a Mercian noblewoman. At this time it was called Peolshalh, meaning 'a nook' or 'land between two streams belonging to Peol'. The Domesday entry of 1086 describes Pelsall as being waste, still belonging to the church. A chapel of ease was built in about 1311. The medieval population was small and a return of 1563 lists only 14 householders. The original centre the area is now known as Old Town. In 1760 the remaining open fields were enclosed, but some holdings survived into the next century in Hall Field, High Ley, The Riddings Field and Final Field. The tithe map of about 1840 records some evidence of the medieval strip farming system. In the second quarter of the 19th century, clusters of houses were built on the fringes of the extensive common land and at the Newlands. The greatest concentration was in what is now the village centre. This area gradually developed; a Methodist Chapel and school were opened in about 1836, in the modern day Station Road and a new St Michael's Church was built in 1844 ‚Äì the old one in Paradise Lane had been considered too small for the growing population. Towards the end of the 19th century, shops became established in Norton Road and High Street. The population in 1801 was 477 and by 1901 had grown to 3,626. Pelsall had become a mining village; in places deposits of coal were found only a few yards from the surface and by about 1800 the shallow and deep seams were 'much worked'. The cutting of the canal in about 1794 opened up the area for industrialisation, with entrepreneurs and landowners quickly exploiting the mineral wealth. Nailmaking, traditionally a cottage industry, was also carried out locally; in the census of 1841 thirty men stated this as their occupation. On 14 November 1872, 22 miners died when the Pelsall Hall Colliery was flooded. 21 of the 22 miners were buried underneath a polished granite obelisk in the churchyard of St Michael and All Angels Church. An ironworks was established on the North Common which grew into a sizeable concern under the ownership of Messrs. Davis and Bloomer. This, together with Yorks Foundry and that of Ernest Wilkes and Co. at Mouse Hill, gave Pelsall a share of the heavy iron trade during the 19th century. Ernest Wilkes and Co. survived until 1977, but the others ceased trading in the 1890s and the pits became unworkable, mainly due to continual flooding problems. Several working farms survived in the local area until after the Second World War. Since then much land has been used for housing development but the ancient common remains. Governance Pelsall is part of the Aldridge-Brownhills Parliamentary constituency. At the 2015 general election, the seat was held by Wendy Morton (Conservative) with a majority of 11,723 over Labour's John Fisher. The seat has been held by the Conservative Party since 3 May 1979. Pelsall Ward has three seats on Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council. The three current councillors, all Conservative, are Garry Perry, former Mayor of Walsall, re-elected in 2012; Marco Longhi, elected in 2011; and Sally Neville, elected in 2018. Landmarks The Fingerpost Pelsall Millennium Stone The Fingerpost, at the junction of B4154 Norton Road and A4124 Lichfield Road, is an unusual and possibly unique design, being substantially restored in the 1980s by Bert Kellitt for the local Civic Society. Pelsall Social Club is at the junction of these roads. Since the late 1990s, Pelsall has had a Millennium Stone, marking the 994‚Äì1994 millennium of the village. Pelsall is quite 'green' with a large turf central common around which previously stood several public houses: only The Railway and The Queens (formerly The Block & Chopper) survive today, with The Old House at Home further up towards the Fingerpost. Pelsall Carnival takes place in July each year, featuring decorated floats and bric-a-brac stalls. It has run continuously since 1972 with the exception of 2020. The main shopping area serving the town is bordered by Norton Road and High Street and includes a range of shops, including a butcher, plus a variety of food outlets. On the northern edge of the village centre there is The Old House at Home public house, while the Fingerpost pub (formerly The Royal Oak) is situated just north of the Fingerpost road junction at Yorks Bridge, near to Pelsall Junction on the Wyrley and Essington Canal, and Nest Common and North Common, on the border with South Staffordshire. Pelsall has lost several pubs in recent years, including The Free Trade in Wood Lane, which, though the building remains, has been closed for several years, and The Swan on Wolverhampton Road, which in 2007 was converted to an Indian restaurant. The Red Cow public house and its car park have been converted into flats; the Old Bush stands derelict after several arson attacks and is now subject to a proposal by Aldi to build a supermarket and care home on the site. In 1997 the Donna Cooper Memorial Garden was created in the village in memory of thirteen- year-old Donna Cooper, who died after being knocked over by a stolen car outside her home in Pelsall Lane, Rushall on 6 January 1993. The driver and his accomplice were both on bail at the time, after being arrested in connection with a hit-and-run incident in which two men had been injured weeks before Cooper's death. The garden was commissioned by Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council, who also maintain it. The entrance consists of an arched gateway that contains an owl motif, taken from a design drawn by Cooper shortly before her death. The garden is long and wide. Transport Pelsall Junction on Wyrley and Essington Canal Pelsall once had a comprehensive bus network which included bus 89, which connected it to Wolverhampton, Bloxwich, Wednesfield and New Cross Hospital. This allowed passengers to interchange at both Bloxwich station on the Chase Line and at Wolverhampton station for further travel to Shropshire, Staffordshire and Manchester. The bus was axed in a 28 April 2019 bus timetable change by National Express West Midlands. It was cut back to Bloxwich instead of Walsall and to Wolverhampton. This means passengers have to change at Bloxwich for further travel although bus service is half-hourly. There is a rapid connection to the nearby towns of Brownhills, Cannock, and Walsall but the nearest rail connections are Walsall, Landywood, Cannock, Penkridge, Shenstone, and Lichfield. There is also a six-journey off- peak service to Kingstanding via Aldridge and Pheasey, as well as a direct Brownhills to Bloxwich service, however this only runs from 8am-4pm from Monday to Saturday. Former site of Pelsall railway station, now a greenway Pelsall previously had a railway station on the South Staffordshire Line that ran east of the village: this closed to passengers in the 1960s and to freight in the 1980s. Only the main road bridges survive as evidence. The line and station have been mooted for reopening since the early 2000s, but low demand has kept the line and station from being reopened. A study carried out in 2009 by the Department for Transport suggested a new station at each of Pelsall and Brownhills. In 2000, the track bed from Walsall to Pelsall was made into part of the SUSTRANS National Cycle Route 5. The line through Pelsall has been identified as a disused rail corridor and this means that it is a long term ambition to reopen the line in the near future.https://www.tfwm.org.uk/media/2525/annex-1-corridors.pdf Ethnicity and religion Pelsall is predominately White British with the remainder comprising 1.2% Asian and 2.8% other, making the ward of Pelsall 96% white and 4% non-white minorities. Christianity is the largest religion in the borough at 75% of the population, followed by no religion at 18%. =Places of worship= St Michael's church Pelsall Evangelical Church, Pelsall The parish church of Pelsall is St Michael and All Angels Church. Other places of worship are Pelsall Evangelical Church and Pelsall Methodist Church. Education Pelsall is home to three primary schools: St Michael's C of E Primary, Pelsall Village School and Ryders Hayes Schoolhttp://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection- reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/104205 (now an Academy). Additionally, First Friends Day Nursery is located at the Pelsall Education Development Centre. Pelsall was previously served by Pelsall Comprehensive School, although this was technically over the border in neighbouring Rushall. It opened in the autumn of 1963 as an 11‚Äì15 secondary modern school before adopting 13‚Äì18 comprehensive status in September 1972. The transfer age was reduced to 11 in September 1986 under Walsall's reorganisation of education in the former Aldridge-Brownhills area, but falling pupil numbers led to its closure in July 1994. The old Pelsall Comprehensive buildings are now home to Rushall JMI School, Education Walsall offices, and a teacher training centre. Sport Pelsall's main football team was Pelsall Villa, formed in 1961, which played in the Midland Football League until 2018 when it disbanded. The club's former ground on Walsall Road neighbours Pelsall Cricket Club and the derelict Old Bush pub.

Pardee and Helen N. Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley, where he has taught since 1987. Eichengreen currently serves as a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and as a Research Fellow at the Centre for Economic Policy Research. Eichengreen's mother was Lucille Eichengreen, a Holocaust survivor and author. Career Eichengreen has done research and published widely on the history and current operation of the international monetary and financial system. He received his A.B. from UC Santa Cruz in 1974. an M.A. in economics, an M.Phil. in economics, an M.A. in history, and a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He was a senior policy advisor to the International Monetary Fund in 1997 and 1998, although he has since been critical of the IMF. In 1997, he served as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Research His best known work is the book Golden Fetters: The Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919‚Äì1939, Oxford University Press, 1992. In his own book on the Great Depression, Ben Bernanke summarized Eichengreen's thesis as follows: The main evidence Eichengreen adduces in support of this view is the fact that countries that abandoned the gold standard earlier saw their economies recover more quickly. His recent books include Global Imbalances and the Lessons of Bretton Woods, MIT Press, September 2006, The European Economy Since 1945: Co- ordinated Capitalism and Beyond, Princeton University Press 2007, and Exorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System, Oxford University Press, 2011 Web Site His most recent book is Hall of Mirrors: The Great Depression, The Great Recession, Oxford University Press, December 2014 His most cited paper is Bayoumi and Eichengreen \\"Shocking Aspects of European Monetary Unification\\" (1993) which argued that the European Union was less suitable as a Single Currency Area than the United States. This diagnosis was confirmed in 2011 when external shocks caused the Eurozone Crisis. He has been President of the Economic History Association (2010‚Äì2011). In addition to this, he is a non-resident Senior Fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2003.

In its pure form it may be called tritium oxide (T2O or 3H2O) or super-heavy water. Pure T2O is corrosive due to self- radiolysis. Diluted, tritiated water is mainly H2O plus some HTO (3HOH). It is also used as a tracer for water transport studies in life-science research. Furthermore, since it naturally occurs in minute quantities, it can be used to determine the age of various water-based liquids, such as vintage wines. The name super-heavy water helps distinguish the tritiated material from heavy water, which contains deuterium instead. Applications Tritiated water can be used to measure the total volume of water in one's body. Tritiated water distributes itself into all body compartments relatively quickly. The concentration of tritiated water in urine is assumed to be similar to the concentration of tritiated water in the body. Knowing the original amount of tritiated water that was ingested and the concentration, one can calculate the volume of water in the body. * Amount of tritiated water (mg) = Concentration of tritiated water (mg/ml) x Volume of body water (ml) * Volume of body water (ml) = [Amount of tritiated water (mg) - Amount excreted (mg)] / Concentration of tritiated water (mg/ml) Adverse health effects Tritiated water contains the radioactive hydrogen isotope tritium. As a low energy beta emitter with a half-life of about 12 years, it is not dangerous externally because its beta particles are unable to penetrate the skin. However, it is a radiation hazard when inhaled, ingested via food or water, or absorbed through the skin.Osborne, R.V. (August 2007) Review of the Greenpeace report: \\"Tritium Hazard Report: Pollution and Radiation Risk from Canadian Nuclear Facilities\\", nuclearfaq.caFact Sheet on Tritium, Radiation Protection Limits, and Drinking Water Standards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission HTO has a short biological half-life in the human body of 7 to 14 days, which both reduces the total effects of single-incident ingestion and precludes long-term bioaccumulation of HTO from the environment. Biological half-life of tritiated water in the human body, which is a measure of body water turnover, varies with season. Studies on the biological half-life of occupational radiation workers for free water tritium in the coastal region of Karnataka, India show that the biological half-life in the winter season is twice that of the summer season.

Often referred to as Kristskirkja (Christ's Church), Landakotskirkja is in the western part of Reykjav√≠k, Iceland's capital city. Architecture Landakotskirkja has a distinctively flat top instead of a standard spire. Its architect was Gu√∞j√≥n Sam√∫elsson, who also designed Hallgr√≠mskirkja, a Reykjavik landmark, and Akureyrarkirkja in Akureyri, North Iceland. History The first Catholic priests to arrive in Iceland after the Reformation were the Frenchmen Bernard Bernard and Jean-Baptiste Baudoin. They bought the Landakot farmstead in Reykjav√≠k and settled there in the early 19th century. They built a small chapel in 1864. A few years later, a small wooden church was erected by T√∫ngata, close to Landakot. After the First World War, Icelandic Catholics saw the need to build a bigger church for the growing number of Catholics. They decided to build a Neo-Gothic church and entrusted the task to the architect Gu√∞j√≥n Sam√∫elsson. After years of construction, Landakotskirkja was finally sanctified on 23 July 1929. It was the largest church in Iceland at the time. Today, Landakotskirkja is a distinct landmark in western Reykjav√≠k. The only Catholic school in Iceland was located nearby on the same land. A big part of the furniture comes from the renowned Atelier J.W. Ramakers & Sons sculptors from Geleen, Holland. Ramakers delivered in 1928 the timpan, both the side altars, the St. Joseph altar in 1905 and the Maria altar in 1928, in 1929 the pulpit. Atelier Ramakers made a design of the main altar, however it was never delivered.

The village is divided into Upper Froyle, centred around the Church and Manor House, and Lower Froyle which grew up around the farms.\\"Froyle, 100 Years of Memories\\" Booth, Annette http://www.froyle.com/pdf/100_100.pdf Retrieved 26 August 2018. History Froyle is situated on the edge of The Downs above the Pilgrims' Way that leads from Winchester to Canterbury. It is most likely that, in the winter months, the actual route taken by Pilgrims passed through the village to avoid the wet conditions in the valley of the River Wey. There was a Church at \\"Froli\\" (mentioned in the Domesday Book) in 1086. The entry for Froyle also states \\"Froyle, it was ever there....\\" and there are traces of habitation on the surrounding downs going back to the Iron Age. It is also known by some who live there as the 'village of the saints' because of the 19 statues of saints in niches on the front walls of houses and other buildings in Upper Froyle. They were bought by Sir Hubert Miller in the early 20th century from Italy. Notable people *Rev. Sir Thomas Miller, 6th Baronet: he was both the vicar and the lord of the manor of Froyle. His grandson, Sir Hubert Miller, said of him \\"My grandfather hunted hard to hounds and drank two bottles of port with his dinner. I wonder he wasn‚Äôt sick.\\" It was also reported that on hot Sunday mornings Miller would smash the church windows with his walking stick to let air in. Although this is thought likely to be apocryphal. *Sir Henry John Miller (1830-1918), emigrated to New Zealand and became Speaker of the New Zealand Legislative Council.

Operated by Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, it opened on October 30, 2014, with a facade that replicates the historic Hotel Moskva (), which previously stood on the same location. It is located near Red Square, and in close proximity to the old City Hall.  History  The Hotel Moskva was constructed from 1932 until 1938, opening as a hotel in December 1935. Designed by Alexey Shchusev, it was built to be one of Moscow's finest hotels and was lavishly detailed with works of art and mosaics by some of the finest artists of the Soviet Union. The original hotel was notable for its use of two different designs for the wings off the central structure. The most popular (possibly apocryphal) explanation is that Shchusev submitted to Stalin a single drawing of the fa√ßade, with one half showing one design and the other half a different design for the wings of the building. However, Stalin put his signature exactly in the middle of the drawing, likely not observing the two choices. Afraid of informing Stalin that he had failed to select a design, the decision was made to simply construct one wing of each on either side of the building. One included large windows and a more ornate fa√ßade, while the other maintained smaller windows and the simpler details of the rest of the hotel's fa√ßade. The lobby of the original hotel contained an entrance to the Moscow Metro Okhotny Ryad station. The label of Stolichnaya vodka features a line drawing of the old hotel. The hotel was expanded to fill the block with a 6-story wing facing Revolution Square, in 1977, for the 60th Anniversary of the October Revolution. The original Hotel Moskva was demolished in 2004 and replaced with a modern reproduction, with underground parking and other features which were not available in the 1930s. The northeastern portion of the complex, facing Revolution Square, was built on the site of the demolished 1977 wing. Housing offices and the shopping center, Fashion Season, it opened in 2012. The hotel, on the site of the 1935 building, replicates the iconic facade, following Shchusev's exterior plans as accurately as possible. It opened on October 25, 2014 as the Four Seasons Hotel Moscow. Major Russian businessman Alexey Khotin is reported to possess the hotel nowadays.http://rbcnews.com/free/20160401124917.shtml Gallery Image:–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–∞–¥, –≤–∏–¥ –Ω–∞ –≥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∏—Ü—É \\"–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞\\".jpgFour Seasons Hotel Moscow Image:Manegetorget.jpgFour Seasons Hotel Moscow, with Manezhnaya Square in foreground Image:MP9 Manege Place Moscow Russia.jpgFour Seasons Hotel Moscow under construction facing Manezhnaya Square, 2008 Image:Moscow hotel renovation 2007.jpgConstruction of the Four Seasons Hotel Moscow, 2007 Image:Okhotny Ryad Street from East.jpgOkhotny Ryad Street, with Fashion Season mall on the left and the Four Seasons Hotel Moscow in the distance.

This concept is an extremely powerful and versatile programming tool, because it allows programmers to modify certain steps of a library procedure in arbitrarily complicated ways, without having to understand or modify the code of that procedure. This tool is particularly effective and convenient in languages that support local function definitions, such as Pascal and the modern GNU dialect of C. It is even more so when function closures are available. The same functionality (and more) is provided by objects in object oriented programming languages, but at a significantly higher cost. Procedural parameters are somewhat related to the concepts of first-class function and anonymous function, but is distinct from them. These two concepts have more to do with how functions are defined, rather than how they are used. Basic concept In most languages that provide this feature, a procedural parameter f of a subroutine P can be called inside the body of P as if it were an ordinary procedure: procedure P(f): return f(6,3) * f(2,1) When calling the subroutine P, one must give it one argument, that must be some previously defined function compatible with the way P uses its parameter f. For example, if we define procedure plus(x, y): return x + y then we may call P (plus), and the result will be plus(6,3) * plus(2,1) = (6 + 3)*(2 + 1) = 27. On the other hand, if we define procedure quot(u, v): return u/v then the call P (quot) will return quot(6,3)*quot(2,1) = (6/3)*(2/1) = 4. Finally, if we define procedure evil(z) return z + 100 then the call P (evil) will not make much sense, and may be flagged as an error. =Syntactic details= Some programming languages that have this feature may allow or require a complete type declaration for each procedural parameter f, including the number and type of its arguments, and the type of its result, if any. For example, in the C programming language the example above could be written as int P(int (*f)(int a, int b)) { return f(6,3) * f(2,1); } In principle, the actual function actf that is passed as argument when P is called must be type- compatible with the declared type of the procedure parameter f. This usually means that actf and f must return the same type of result, must have the same number of arguments, and corresponding arguments must have the same type. The names of the arguments need not be the same, however, as shown by the plus and quot examples above. However, some programming languages may be more restrictive or more liberal in this regard. =Scoping= In languages that allow procedural parameters, the scoping rules are usually defined in such a way that procedural parameters are executed in their native scope. More precisely, suppose that the function actf is passed as argument to P, as its procedural parameter f; and f is then called from inside the body of P. While actf is being executed, it sees the environment of its definition. The implementation of these scoping rules is not trivial. By the time that actf is finally executed, the activation records where its environment variables live may be arbitrarily deep in the stack. This is the so-called downwards funarg problem. Example: Generic insertion sort The concept of procedural parameter is best explained by examples. A typical application is the following generic implementation of the insertion sort algorithm, that takes two integer parameters a,b and two procedural parameters prec, swap: procedure isort(a, b, prec, swap): integer i, j; i ‚Üê a; while i ‚â§ b do j ‚Üê i; while j > a and prec(j, j‚àí1) do swap(j, j‚àí1); j ‚Üê j‚àí1; i ‚Üê i+1; This procedure can be used to sort the elements x[a] through x[b] of some array x, of arbitrary type, in a user-specified order. The parameters prec and swap should be two functions, defined by the client, both taking two integers r, s between a and b. The prec function should return true if and only if the data stored in x[r] should precede the data stored in x[s], in the ordering defined by the client. The swap function should exchange the contents of x[r] and x[s], and return no result. By the proper choice of the functions prec and swap, the same isort procedure can be used to reorder arrays of any data type, stored in any medium and organized in any data structure that provides indexed access to individual array elements. (Note however that there are sorting algorithms that are much more efficient than insertion sort for large arrays.) =Sorting floating- point numbers= For instance, we can sort an array z of 20 floating-point numbers, z[1] through z[20] in increasing order by calling isort (1, 20,zprec,zswap), where the functions zprec and zswap are defined as procedure zprec(r, s): return (z[r] < z[s]); procedure zswap(r, s): float t; t ‚Üê z[r]; z[r] ‚Üê z[s]; z[s] ‚Üê t =Sorting rows of a matrix= For another example, let M be a matrix of integers with 10 rows and 20 columns, with indices starting at 1. The following code will rearrange the elements in each row so that all the even values come before all odd values: integer i procedure eoprec(r, s): return (M[i, r] mod 2) < (M[i, s] mod 2); procedure eoswap(r, s): integer t; t ‚Üê M[i,r]; M[i,r] ‚Üê M[i,s]; M[i,s] ‚Üê t; for i from 1 to 10 do isort(1, 20, eoprec, eoswap); Note that the effects of eoprec and eoswap depend on the row number i, but the isort procedure does not need to know that. =Vector- sorting procedure= The following example uses isort to define a procedure vecsort that takes an integer n and an integer vector v with elements v[0] through v[n‚àí1] and sorts them in either increasing or decreasing order, depending on whether a third parameter incr is true or false, respectively: procedure vecsort(n, v, incr): procedure vprec(r, s): if incr then return v[r] < v[s]; else return v[r] > v[s]; procedure vswap(r, s): integer t; t ‚Üê v[r]; v[r] ‚Üê v[s]; v[s] ‚Üê t isort(0, n‚àí1, vprec, vswap); Note the use of nested function definitions to get a function vprec whose effect depends on the parameter incr passed to vecsort. In languages that do not allow nested function definitions, like standard C, obtaining this effect would require rather complicated and/or thread-unsafe code. Example: merging two sequences The following example illustrates the use of procedural parameters to process abstract data structures independently of their concrete implementation. The problem is to merge two ordered sequences of records into a single sorted sequence, where the nature of the records and the ordering criterion can be chosen by the client. The following implementation assumes only that each record can be referenced by a memory address, and there is a \\"null address\\" Œõ that is not the address of any valid record. The client must provide the addresses A, B of the first records in each sequence, and functions prec, next, and append, to be described later. procedure merge(A, B, prec, nextA, appendA, nextB, appendB): address ini, fin, t ini ‚Üê Œõ; fin ‚Üê Œõ while A ‚â† Œõ or B ‚â† Œõ do if B = Œõ or (A ‚â† Œõ and B ‚â† Œõ and prec(A, B)) then t ‚Üê nextA(A) fin ‚Üê appendA(A, fin); if ini = Œõ then ini ‚Üê fin A ‚Üê t else t ‚Üê nextB(B) fin ‚Üê appendB(B, fin); if ini = Œõ then ini ‚Üê fin B ‚Üê t return ini The function prec should take the addresses r, s of two records, one from each sequence, and return true if the first record should come before the other in the output sequence. The function nextA should take the address of a record from the first sequence, and return the address of the next record in the same sequence, or Œõ if there is none. The function appendA should append the first record from sequence A to the output sequence; its arguments are the address A of the record to be appended, and the address fin of the last record of the output list (or Œõ if that list is still empty). The procedure appendA should return the updated address of the final element of the output list. The procedures nextB and appendB are analogous for the other input sequence. =Merging linked lists= To illustrate the use of the generic merge procedure, here is the code for merging two simple linked lists, starting with nodes at addresses R, S. Here we assume that each record x contains an integer field x.INFO and an address field x.NEXT that points to the next node; where the info fields are in increasing order in each list. The input lists are dismantled by the merge, and their nodes are used to build the output list. procedure listmerge(R, S): procedure prec(r, s): return r.INFO < s.INFO procedure next(x): return x.NEXT procedure append(x, fin) if fin ‚â† Œõ then fin.NEXT ‚Üê x x.NEXT ‚Üê Œõ return x return merge(R, S, prec, next, append, next, append) =Merging vectors= The following code illustrates the independence of the generic merge procedure from the actual representation of the sequences. It merges the elements of two ordinary arrays U[0] through U[m‚àí1] and V[0] through V[n‚àí1] of floating-point numbers, in decreasing order. The input arrays are not modified, and the merged sequence of values is stored into a third vector W[0] through W[m+n‚àí1]. As in the C programming language, we assume that the expression \\"&V;\\" yields the address of variable V, \\"*p\\" yields the variable whose address is the value of p, and that \\"&(X[i])\\" is equivalent to \\"&(X[0]) + i\\" for any array X and any integer i. procedure arraymerge(U, m, V, n, W): procedure prec(r, s): return (*r) > (*s) procedure nextU(x): if x = &(U[m‚àí1]) then return Œõ else return x + 1 procedure nextV(x): if x = &(V[n‚àí1]) then return Œõ else return x + 1 procedure append(x, fin) if fin = Œõ then fin ‚Üê &(W[0]) (*fin) ‚Üê (*x) return fin + 1 if m = 0 then U ‚Üê Œõ if n = 0 then V ‚Üê Œõ return merge(U, V, prec, nextU, append, nextV, append) Example: Definite integral=Integrating over an interval= The following procedure computes the approximate integral \\\\textstyle\\\\int_a^b f (x) dx of a given real-valued function f over a given interval [a,b] of the real line. The numerical method used is the trapezium rule with a given number n of steps; the real numbers are approximated by floating-point numbers. procedure Intg(f, a, b, n): float t, x, s; integer i if b = a then return 0 x ‚Üê a; s ‚Üê f(a) / 2; for i from 1 to n‚àí1 do t ‚Üê i/(n+1); x ‚Üê (1‚àít) * a + t * b; s ‚Üê s + f(x) s ‚Üê f(b) / 2 return (b ‚àí a) * s / n =Integrating over a disk= Consider now the problem of integrating a given function g, with two arguments, over a disk D with given center (xc,yc) and given radius R. This problem can be reduced to two nested single-variable integrals by the change of variables :\\\\int\\\\\\\\!\\\\int_D g(x,y)\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x\\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}y = \\\\int_0^R z \\\\left(\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} g(\\\\mathit{xc}+z \\\\cos t ,\\\\mathit{yc}+z \\\\sin t ) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}t\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}z The following code implements the right- hand-side formula: procedure DiskIntg(g, xc, yc, R, n) procedure gring(z): procedure gpolar(t): float x, y x ‚Üê xc + z * cos(t) y ‚Üê yc + z * sin(t) return g(x, y) integer m ‚Üê round(n*z/R) return z*Intg(gpolar, 0, 2*œÄ, m) return Intg(gring, 0, R, n) This code uses the integration procedure Intg in two levels. The outer level (last line) uses Intg to compute the integral of gring(z) for z varying from 0 to R. The inner level (next-to-last line) defines gring(z) as being the line integral of g(x,y) over the circle with center (xc,yc) and radius z. History Procedural parameters were invented before the age of electronic computers, by mathematician Alonzo Church, as part of his lambda calculus model of computation. Procedural parameters as a programming language feature were introduced by ALGOL 60. In fact, ALGOL 60 had a powerful \\"call by name\\" parameter-passing mechanism that could simplify some uses of procedural parameters; see Jensen's Device. Procedural parameters were an essential feature of the LISP programming language, which also introduced the concept of function closure or funarg. The C programming language allows function pointers to be passed as parameters, which accomplish the same end, and are often used as callbacks in event-driven programming and as error handlers. However, only a few modern C compilers allow nested function definitions, so that its other uses are relatively uncommon. Procedural parameters were provided also in Pascal, together with nested procedure definitions; however, since standard Pascal did not allow separate compilation, the feature was little used in that language, too.

The French-schooled director's films focus on the aftermath of the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. Rithy Panh's works are from an authoritative viewpoint, because his family were expelled from Phnom Penh in 1975 by the Khmer Rouge. One after another, his father, mother, sisters and nephews died of starvation or exhaustion, as they were held in a remote labor camp in rural Cambodia. Biography=Early life, escape from Cambodia= Rithy Panh was born in Phnom Penh. His father was a long time undersecretary at the Ministry of Education, a Senator, a school teacher and inspector of primary schools.https://www.amazon.com/Elimination-survivor-confronts- commandant-killing/dp/1590516753 His family and other residents were expelled from the Cambodian capital in 1975 by the Khmer Rouge. Rithy's family suffered under the regime, and after he saw his parents, siblings and other relatives die of overwork or malnutrition, Rithy escaped to Thailand in 1979, where he lived for a time in a refugee camp at Mairut. Eventually, he made his way to Paris, France. It was while he was attending vocational school to learn carpentry that he was handed a video camera during a party that he became interested in film-making. He went on to graduate from the Institut des hautes √©tudes cin√©matographiques (Institute for the Advanced Cinematographic Studies). He returned to Cambodia in 1990, while still using Paris as a home base. =Career as director= His first documentary feature film, Site 2, about a family of Cambodian refugees in a camp on the Thai-Cambodian border in the 1980s, was awarded \\"Grand Prix du Documentaire\\" at the Festival of Amiens. His 1994 film, Rice People, is told in a docudrama style, about a rural family struggling with life in post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia. It was in competition at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, and was submitted to the 67th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, the first time a Cambodian film had been submitted for an Oscar. The 2000 documentary, The Land of the Wandering Souls, also told of a family's struggle, as well as showing a Cambodia entering the modern age, chronicling the hardships of workers digging a cross-country trench for Cambodia's first optical fiber cable. His 2003 documentary, S-21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine, about the Khmer Rouge's Tuol Sleng prison, reunited former prisoners, including the artist Vann Nath, and their former captors, for a chilling, confrontational review of Cambodia's violent history. More post-Khmer Rouge events are documented in the 2005 drama, The Burnt Theatre, which focuses on a theater troupe that inhabits the burned-out remains of Phnom Penh's Suramet Theatre, which caught fire in 1994 but has never been rebuilt. His 2007 documentary, Paper Cannot Wrap Up Embers, delves into the lives of prostitutes in Phnom Penh. The 2011 movie \\"Gibier d'√©levage\\" (in French, \\"The Catch\\" in English), is based on a 1957 novel by the Japanese Nobel Prize writer Kenzabur≈ç ≈åe, about the villagers' behavior when a black US Airforce pilot's plane is shot down and crashes over Japan (Cambodia in the movie). The 2012 documentary, Duch, Master of the Forges of Hell, is about interviews with Kang Guek Eav, a former leader in the Khmer Rouge, also known as Duch, tried by the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and sentenced to 30 years of prison, but appealing against the conviction. However, he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment after the appeal.

The Apocolocyntosis (divi) Claudii, literally The pumpkinification of (the Divine) Claudius, is a satire on the Roman emperor Claudius, which, according to Cassius Dio, was written by Seneca the Younger. A partly extant Menippean satire, an anonymous work called Ludus de morte Divi Claudii (\\"Play on the death of the Divine Claudius\\") in its surviving manuscripts, may or may not be identical to the text mentioned by Cassius Dio. \\"Apocolocyntosis\\" is a word play on \\"apotheosis\\", the process by which dead Roman emperors were recognized as gods. Authorship The Ludus de morte Divi Claudii is one of only two examples of a Menippean satire from the classical era that have survived, the other being Satyricon, which was likely written by Petronius. Gilbert Bagnani is among the scholars who also attribute the Ludus text to Petronius.Gilbert Bagnani. Arbiter of Elegance: A study of the Life & Works of C. Petronius (1954) \\"Apocolocyntosis\\" is Latinized Greek, and can also be transliterated as Apokolokyntosis (Attic Greek ·ºàœÄŒøŒ∫ŒøŒªŒøŒ∫œçŒΩœÑœâœÉŒπœÇ: \\"Pumpkinification\\", also \\"Gourdification\\"). The title Apokolokyntosis comes from the Roman historian Cassius Dio, who wrote in Greek. Cassius Dio attributed authorship of a satirical text on the death of Claudius, called Apokolokyntosis, to Seneca the Younger.\\"Seneca himself had composed a work that he called Gourdification,‚Äîa word made on the analogy of 'deification'\\" (Dio Cassius, Book 61, No. 35 - Translation by Herbert Baldwin Foster, 1905, retrieved from Project Gutenberg) Only much later was the work referred to by Cassius Dio identified (with some degree of uncertainty) with the Ludus text.See introduction of W. H. D. Rouse's translation: \\"This piece is ascribed to Seneca by ancient tradition; it is impossible to prove that it is his, and impossible to prove that it is not. The matter will probably continue to be decided by every one according to his view of Seneca's character and abilities: in the matters of style and of sentiment much may be said on both sides. Dion Cassius (lx, 35) says that Seneca composed an \\"apokolokintosis\\" or Pumpkinification of Claudius after his death, the title being a parody of the usual \\"apotheosis\\"; but this title is not given in the MSS. of the Ludus de Morte Claudii, nor is there anything in the piece which suits the title very well.\\" Most scholars accept this attribution, but a minority hold that the two works are not the same, and that the surviving text is not necessarily Seneca's. Seneca had some personal reason for satirizing Claudius, because the emperor had banished him to Corsica. In addition, the political climate after the emperor's death may have made attacks on him acceptable. However, alongside these personal considerations, Seneca appears also to have been concerned with what he saw as an overuse of apotheosis as a political tool. If an emperor as flawed as Claudius could receive such treatment, he argued elsewhere, then people would cease to believe in the gods at all. A reading of the Ludus text shows that its author was not above flattery of the new emperor Nero ‚Äì such as writing that he would live longer and be wiser than the legendary Nestor. Plot The work traces the death of Claudius, his ascent to heaven and judgment by the gods, and his eventual descent to Hades. At each turn, of course, Seneca mocks the late emperor's personal failings, most notably his arrogant cruelty and his inarticulacy. After Mercury persuades Clotho to kill the emperor, Claudius walks to Mount Olympus, where he convinces Hercules to let the gods hear his suit for deification in a session of the divine senate. Proceedings are in Claudius' favor until Augustus delivers a long and sincere speech listing some of Claudius' most notorious crimes. Most of the speeches of the gods are lost through a large gap in the text. Mercury escorts him to Hades. On the way, they see the funeral procession for the emperor, in which a crew of venal characters mourn the loss of the perpetual Saturnalia of the previous reign. In Hades, Claudius is greeted by the ghosts of all the friends he has murdered. These shades carry him off to be punished, and the doom of the gods is that he should shake dice forever in a box with no bottom (gambling was one of Claudius' vices): every time he tries to throw the dice they fall out and he has to search the ground for them. Suddenly Caligula turns up, claims that Claudius is an ex-slave of his, and hands him over to be a law clerk in the court of the underworld.

The squadron is one of the oldest in the United States Air Force, its origins dating to 20 February 1918, being organized at Rich Field, Waco Texas, as a pilot training Squadron during World War I. The squadron saw combat during World War II, and became part of the United States Air Forces in Europe during the Cold War. History=Early history= The 77th Aero Service Squadron was organized at Rich Field, Texas on 20 February 1918 with 2Lt. George P. Southworth as the squadron's first commander. On 28 February the squadron along with the 78th and 79th Aero Squadrons (which had also been born at Rich Field) moved by train on the Missouri‚ÄìKansas‚ÄìTexas Railroad (commonly known as the Katy Railway) to Taliaferro Field #1 (later named Hicks Field), Texas. The 77th would then move to Taliaferro Field # 2 (later named Barron Field), Texas on 18 March 1918. In May 1918 2Lt. John Mason Tilney became squadron commander. On 21 July 1918 the 77th was redesignated Squadron A, Barron Field, Texas. A letter dated 24 July 1918 states \\"The use of numerical designations of squadrons will be restricted to those overseas and the eighty reserve squadrons authorized to be established at all times in this country\\". The vacated numbers were to be assigned to new squadrons as they were organized to replace squadrons shipped overseas. Some time after the squadrons designation was changed 2Lt. Edward S. Winfree took command and finally 2Lt. Hugh C. Downey became the squadron's last commander. The 77th and later Squadron \\"A\\" provided personnel for base administrative activities and for various positions needed to maintain operations on Barron Field. The squadron was officially demobilized on 18 November 1918, but recently found documents seem to show the unit was not demobilized until March 1919. There is also evidence that another 77th Aero Service Squadron may have existed. A letter from the Office Director Military Aeronautics Operations Section to Commander Barron Field dated 23 September 1918 requests that the records for the 77th Aero Service Squadron (renamed Squadron \\"A\\" by this time) be sent to Aviation General Supply Depot and Concentration Camp, Garden City, Long Island, New York for reorganization of the 77th. The 77th (Squadron A) was reconstituted and consolidated with the 77th Observation squadron in 1936. The 77th Observations Squadron was constituted on 8 May 1929 and then was redesignated as the 77th Pursuit Squadron on 8 May 1929 but not activated. On 15 November the 77th Pursuit Squadron activated as the first tactical unit assigned to the 20th Pursuit Group at Mather Field, California, with an officer strength of four. Basically in 1936 the 77th Pursuit Squadron had its history merged with that of the 77 Aero Squadron (Squadron A). =World War II= 77th Fighter Squadron P-38 (LC-C) at RAF Kings Cliffe, England during World War II. From 1930 until 1943, the squadron moved back and forth across the country with the 20th Group, flying several different aircraft, including the Boeing P-26 Peashooter, Curtiss P-36 Hawk, Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Bell P-39 Airacobra and the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk. In January 1943, the 77th settled at March Field, California, in time to be reassigned to England and the European Theater of Operations during World War II. The 77th, now designated a fighter squadron, arrived at RAF Kings Cliffe, Northamptonshire, England, in August 1943, flying the P-38. The 77th entered combat operations in November 1943, flying combat missions until 25 April 1945, when, armed with P-51 Mustangs, they began escorting \\"heavies\\" to Pilzen, Czechoslovakia, in one of the last raids of the war. The 77th was instrumental in the 20th Group achieving its kill record of 432 enemy aircraft, 400 locomotives, 1,555 freight cars, 94 ammunition cars and 536 motor vehicles destroyed. The 77th left King's Cliffe, England, in the summer of 1945 and was inactivated in October 1945. =Cold War= F-84Gs of the 77th Tactical Fighter Squadron/20th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Wethersfeld, UK - Early 1950s The 77th and the 20th Group were reactivated in July 1946 at Biggs Field, Texas. Between 1946 and 1952 the squadron moved to Shaw Field, South Carolina, and then to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, becoming the 77th Fighter-Bomber Squadron and transitioning to the Republic F-84 Thunderjet. In May 1952, the 77th and the 20th were reassigned to RAF Wethersfield, England. In 1957, the squadron transitioned to the North American F-100 Super Sabre and a year later was designated a tactical fighter squadron flying the \\"Hun\\" for 11 more years in support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization commitment. In 1969, the 77th and the -20th Tactical Fighter Wing began moving to RAF Upper Heyford and converted to the fighter-bomber version of the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, utilizing the F-111E model. =Modern era= The 77th Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 30 September 1993 and then reactivated at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, on 1 January 1994. The squadron acquired F-16 aircraft and Airmen of the 17th Fighter Squadron that inactivated that same day. In 1996, the 77th deployed to Southwest Asia. In 1999 and 2001, the 77th deployed to Southwest Asia flying missions over Iraq in support of Operation Northern Watch. The squadron also deployed in support of Operation Allied Force and Operation Desert Fox in 1999. In 1997 and 2000, the 77th deployed to Southwest Asia flying missions over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch. In between deployments from 2001 to 2006, the 77th Fighter Squadron provided escort security to the President of the United States and Air Force One as part of Operation Noble Eagle and flew security missions daily over the Eastern Seaboard. The 77th was awarded the 20th Fighter Wing Fighter Squadron of the Year in 1998 and 2000. In 2001, the squadron participated in many other deployments. From July to Sept. 2002, the 77th deployed to Operation Northern WatchH. From February 2003 to May 2003, the squadron deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia Asia in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Two F-16s from the squadron collided during a training flight on 15 October 2009. One F-16, piloted by Captain Lee Bryant, was able to land safely at Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina.The Washington Post, \\"Plane Search Expands; Debris Seen in Atlantic\\", 17 October 2009. The other jet, piloted by Captain Nicholas Giglio, 32, apparently crashed into the ocean. Authorities believe that Giglio was killed instantly in the collision and did not eject. 2013 Sequestration Air Combat Command officials announced a stand down and reallocation of flying hours for the rest of the fiscal year 2013 due to mandatory budget cuts. The across-the board spending cuts, called sequestration, took effect 1 March when Congress failed to agree on a deficit- reduction plan. Squadrons either stood down on a rotating basis or kept combat ready or at a reduced readiness level called \\"basic mission capable\\" for part or all of the remaining months in fiscal 2013. This affected the 77th Fighter Squadron with a stand-down grounding from 9 April-30 September 2013.

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United States on 31 December 1964 by Simon & Schuster, Inc., New York under the title The Brinkmanship of Galahad Threepwood, and in the United Kingdom on 26 August 1965 by Herbert Jenkins, London.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 98‚Äì99, A88. It forms part of the Blandings Castle saga, being the ninth full-length novel to be set there.  Plot introduction  Lord Emsworth's idyllic demesne, Blandings Castle, is as usual overrun with overbearing sisters, overefficient secretaries, and the lovestruck; even worse, an alleged old flame has appeared, determined to put an end to the Earl's peaceful, pig-loving existence. All Gally's genius is required to sort things out satisfactorily... Plot summary Galahad Threepwood is in residence at Blandings Castle, and finds his brother Lord Emsworth, the ninth Earl, beset by the usual collection of woes. His sister, Lady Hermione Wedge, has not only hired a secretary (Sandy Callender) to mind his affairs, but has also invited Dame Daphne Winkworth to stay and, as Galahad discovers, to reignite an old flame and take up permanent residence as the next Countess. Joining the house party are Tipton Plimsoll, a young multimillionaire who is engaged to Lady Hermione's daughter Veronica, and Lady Hermione's nephew Wilfred Allsop, a struggling young pianist who is in love with Emsworth's pig-girl Monica Simmons. Wilfred and Tipton had met in New York several days earlier for an evening of dinner, drinks, and imprisonment. (They also met policeman Officer Garroway, from The Small Bachelor.) Wilfred has been engaged by Dame Daphne to teach music at her girls' school, a prospect that Wilfred cannot refuse but is also anxious about, as Dame Daphne is intolerant of drinking among her staff. Galahad's chief task at Blandings is to deal with sundered hearts, namely those of Sandy and her now-ex-betrothed Sam Bagshott. Gally has known Sandy for years, and was good friends with Sam's father \\"Boko\\" Bagshott, and is disturbed at their falling-out over a minor matter of a bet in the Drones Club marriage sweepstakes. Sam needs ¬£700 to fix up his inherited family seat and sell it (to Oofy Prosser), and has drawn Tipton in the race for the next to be married. The other front-runners have dropped out, and Sam believes he has a sure winner, as Lady Hermione will not let Veronica lose her a multimillionaire son-in-law. Sandy, who knew Tipton from working for his uncle Chet Tipton in New York, believes that this engagement will go the way of all his others, and is upset at Sam for not selling his stake to a syndicate that has offered a firm ¬£100. If Sam would come down to Blandings, Gally believes, and plead his case with Sandy, all would be resolved. But when Sam does so, his first accidental encounter with Sandy proves disastrous: he chases her, she eludes him, and in giving up the chase he is confronted by the local constabulary. Constable Evans informs him, and he discovers that he cannot dispute, that in leaving the Emsworth Arms he made off with Sebastian Beach's gold pocket watch. (Beach had left it with the barmaid Marlene to admire, and she had been showing it to Sam when he spied Sandy). Already grumpy from Sandy's rebuff, Sam deals with the accusation by punching Constable Evans in the eye and fleeing on the constable's bicycle. When Gally hears of this, he insists on bringing Sam into the Castle, and decides that he should enter under the name of Augustus Whipple, noted author of On The Care of the Pig, Emsworth's revered reference work for the care and feeding of his prize pig Empress of Blandings. On encountering Emsworth at the Empress' sty, Sam diagnoses her malady as not swine fever, but instead intoxication (from the contents of Wilfred's flask, intended to steel him for proposing to Monica Simmons but dropped when discovered by Dame Daphne's son Huxley.) In gratitude Emsworth invites Sam to stay at Blandings, while a boosted Wilfred wins his Monica. Meanwhile, Lady Hermione has learned from Emsworth that Tipton had lost all his money in the stock market crash and is now impoverished. She rushes up to London to instruct Veronica to break the engagement in a letter to be delivered by the next post. When Colonel Wedge receives Tipton, who is driving a Rolls-Royce and brandishing an ¬£8000 necklace for Vee, he asks Gally to intercept the letter, which Gally is pleased to do. Gally goes a step further and gives the letter to Sam. On Hermione's return, when Beach informs her that the man who stole his watch is at the Castle impersonating Augustus Whipple, Gally threatens to deliver the letter to Tipton unless Hermione allows Sam to stay. Hermione tries searching Sam's room, but only succeeds in losing Wilfed his job with Dame Daphne, when her son Huxley discovers him singing in the corridor as a signal to his aunt. Sandy confronts Galahad, but ends up persuaded by him to take Sam back. They find him locked in the potting shed, where he has been imprisoned by Constable Evans. Sandy frees him from the shed and they are reconciled. But not all the couples remain happy: Emsworth discovers the fatal letter in his desk, where Gally had hidden it, and has it delivered to Tipton. Gally has hard work convincing Tipton that Veronica meant not a word of it, and Tipton phones Veronica and the rift is mended as quickly as made. Tipton takes Wilfred and Monica Simmons up to London to gather Vee and head to the registrar's for a double wedding. Not everything is wrapped up, though. Emsworth is still in peril of matrimony from Dame Daphne, Sam still has to collect on his winning ticket, and the Law still looms over Sam's shoulder. Sandy hears that another Drones Club member has won the sweepstakes, and Sam's stake is worthless. Lady Hermione, having discovered that the letter was delivered and nullified, now announces her intention to expose Sam; Gally leads her to the library where he claims Sam is, and locks her in. He rushes to Emsworth, to touch him for the thousand pounds before Lady Hermione can summon aid. He finds Emsworth rattled and deflated. In Monica Simmons' absence, young Huxley attempts to release the Empress from her sty. Having morning head after her bender, she responds by biting the lad's finger. Dame Winkworth deems her dangerous and demands that she be destroyed; Emsworth calls her a fool and telephones the veterinarian to find whether there was any risk of infection to the Empress. At that Dame Daphne leaves the household. Hermione, finding that Emsworth has driven away Dame Daphne, exposes Sam, declares Emsworth to be impossible to manage, and leaves as well. The ninth Earl is reluctant now to lend money to an impostor, but Gally reminds him that he has now been freed of the threat of marriage to Dame Daphne, and of the supervision of their sister Hermione, and that if he lends the money to Sam all his troubles will be ended, as Sam will take his secretary out of his life. Emsworth gladly does so, and peace reigns over Blandings once again.  Characters  * The Earl of Emsworth, the absent- minded master of Blandings  The Hon.

This image comes from Copy E. of the work, printed in 1821 and in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art The Spectre is one aspect of the fourfold nature of the human psyche along with Humanity, Emanation and Shadow that William Blake used to explore his spiritual mythology throughout his poetry and art. As one of Blake's elements of the psyche, Spectre takes on symbolic meaning when referred to throughout his poems. According to professor Joseph Hogan, \\"Spectre functions to define individuals from others [...] When it is separated [from Emanation], it is reason, trying to define everything in terms of unchanging essences.\\" Thus, according to Samuel Foster Damon, Spectre epitomizes \\"Reason separated from humanity\\" and \\"Self-centered selfhood\\" or, as Alexander S. Gourlay puts it, Spectre is \\"characterized by self-defensive rationalization\\". Spectre appears in several of Blake's works, including Jerusalem, Milton: a poem and The Four Zoas. Because of its widespread presence in Blake's more mythological works, scholars have reflected on Spectre through multiple critical approaches including Jungian archetypal analysis, as a means of mapping Blake's mythology within intellectual history and within his own biographical experience. In Blake's works The mythological character of Spectre is first introduced in Blake's prophetic book Jerusalem: :I see the Four-fold Man, The Humanity in deadly sleep :And its fallen Emanation, the Spectre and its cruel Shadow. Elsewhere in Jerusalem, Blake defines it this way: \\"The Spectre is the Reasoning Power in Man, and when separated from Imagination and closing itself as in steel in a Ratio of Things of Memory, It thence frames Laws and Moralities [...].\\" The Spectre also appears in his published works Milton and The Four Zoas. In his unpublished hand written workbook, known as the Rossetti Manuscript, he also drafted a poem that began \\"My Spectre around me night and day / Like a wild beast guards my way.\\" For a transcription of the poem see it on Wikisource Scholarly approach Historicist critics sometime look for direct inspirations for Blake's mythological ideas, such as Spectre, in his life experiences. In his 1966 article titled \\"Cowper as Blake's Spectre\\", Morton Paley argues that William Blake was thinking of the poet William Cowper, his philosophy and madness when creating the character of Spectre. In his argument, he discusses Blake's admiration and connections to Cowper both intellectually and socially as helping Blake create the archetype which became Spectre within the larger Blake mythology . Some critics have used Blake's mythology to help map elements of his mythology within a larger intellectual history. For example, in his book Blake, Kierkegaard, and the Spectre of Dialectic, Lorraine Clark argues that Spectre and its relationship to Los signals a change in Blake's approach to history and philosophy. He says that Blake in his focus on \\"the Los and Spectre in The Four Zoas, Milton and Jerusalem, Blake turns from a Hegelian \\"both-and\\" dialectic of Orc and Urizen in his earlier works to something very Kierkegaardian \\"either/or\\". In general, Blake's mythology lends itself to psychoanalytic criticism, because of its clear archetypes. According to scholar Mark Ryan, the acclaimed literary critic Northrop Frye often aligned Spectre with persona in Jung's archetypes. On the other hand, Ryan says that many other critiques using archetypal approaches \\"tend to automatically relate the \\"Shadow\\" and the \\"Spectre,\\" as pertaining to the concept of the dark side of the psyche, without considering the possibility that each character's shadow is, by implication, open to different modes of interpretation.\\" Accessed via Academic OneFile NotesReferences Further reading  * Category:William Blake's mythology ","title":"Spectre (Blake)"},{"id":"3957902","text":"The 2002 British Academy Television Awards were held on Sunday 21 April 2002.

The ZPP, unofficially controlled and directed by Joseph Stalin, became one of the founding structures of the Soviet-controlled communist government that after World War II took power in Poland. The ZPP was a mass organization with about 100,000 members (Polish citizens in the Soviet Union, mostly war refugees and Soviet deportees left after the departure of Anders' Army). It was dominated by former members of the Communist Party of Poland, in particular people from the Central Bureau Communists of Poland, which was established after the ZPP and also operated in the Soviet Union. The ZPP included activists of many political orientations. During World War II, there were about 1,500 declared Polish communists in the Soviet Union.Andrzej Werblan, Szkice i polemiki [Sketches and polemics], p. 168, published in 1970 by KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, Warsaw In January 1943, Wanda Wasilewska and Alfred Lampe petitioned the Soviet authorities for creation of an all-encompassing Polish center in the Soviet Union; it would function as a \\"counterweight for the reactionary (Polish) √©migr√© elements\\". According to Wasilewska, the name of the organization was Stalin's idea. The ZPP was organized from 1 March and its significance increased after the Soviet Union broke relations with the Polish government- in-exile in April 1943, following the discovery of the Katyn massacre. In May 1943, Wasilewska and other future ZPP activists were involved in the creation of the Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Infantry Division, which gave rise to the Polish People's Army. It fought on the Eastern Front together with the Soviet Red Army. The Polish People's Army was placed under command of General Zygmunt Berling and later it merged with Armia Ludowa, the communist underground force in Poland. The ZPP was officially established by its founding congress, which deliberated in Moscow on 9‚Äì10 June 1943. It was placed under the Directorate, which consisted of President Wanda Wasilewska and four members: Stanis≈Çaw Skrzeszewski, Stefan Jƒôdrychowski, W≈Çodzimierz Sokorski, and Zygmunt Berling. Non-communist members of the Main Council included Andrzej Witos and Boles≈Çaw Drobner. The ZPP issued a declaration condemning the Polish government-in- exile led by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, as a body whose actions were damaging the \\"Anglo-Russo-American bloc\\". The program of the ZPP, proclaimed at its congress, stressed the importance of alliance with the Soviet Union and postulated the creation of a democratic and socially just Poland. A new agrarian system was promised. The material, cultural and educational needs of Poles in the Soviet Union were to be satisfied. The ZPP relinquished the Polish claims to the disputed eastern borderlands (Kresy) as consisting of Ukrainian, Belarusian and Lithuanian territories, thus denouncing the borders implemented at the Peace of Riga in 1921. The ZPP's main objective was the establishment of socialism in Poland; the institution laid foundations for the creation of the post-war Polish government. The ZPP published its own weekly Wolna Polska ('The Free Poland'), edited from 1 March 1943 by Wasilewska, and the biweekly Nowe Widnokrƒôgi ('New Horizons'), founded by her still earlier. The organization provided extensive social and social welfare services and conducted educational activities for the Polish population in the Soviet Union, with children receiving particular attention (an estimated half of the children of Polish deportees went to Polish schools). The ZPP's Social Welfare Department took over the Polish welfare activities previously conducted in the Soviet Union by the Government Delegation for Poland of the Polish government- in-exile, and to reach the widely dispersed Polish population it worked together with a Soviet agency set up for the same purpose. About 55,000 Poles were relocated from northern Siberia to the European regions of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1943, 223,000 Polish citizens were under the care of the ZPP. In late 1943, the ZPP established the Polish National Committee (Polski Komitet Narodowy, PKN), with the intention of turning it into a communist- dominated provisional government of Poland. In 1944 the ZPP formally recognized the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN) established in Warsaw by the ZPP's rival communist institution, the Polish Workers' Party (PPR). Together with the PPR and the Soviets, the ZPP was responsible for the formation in July 1944 of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego, PKWN), a nascent communist government; it included ZPP members. In 1944‚Äì1946 the ZPP was involved in resettling Poles from the Soviet Union into Poland. On 30 July 1946, the State National Council dissolved the Union of Polish Patriots.

Recently renovated graves of the Balyan family in the Armenian cemetery in √úsk√ºdar, Istanbul. The Balyan family (; or Palyan ailesi) was a prominent Ottoman Armenian family of court architects in the service of Ottoman sultans and other members of the Ottoman dynasty during the 18th and 19th centuries. For five generations, they designed and constructed numerous major buildings in the Ottoman Empire, including palaces, mansions, konaks, kiosks, yalis, mosques, churches, and various public buildings, mostly in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul). Ancestors=Mason Bali= Mason Bali (Mason Balen, or Meremmet√ßi Balen Kalfa), a masonry craftsman from the Belen village of Karaman in central Anatolia, was the founder of the dynasty. He moved to Istanbul, where he learned of an Armenian palace architect of Sultan Mehmed IV (1648-1687), whom he met and replaced as armenian himself. When Bali died in 1725, his son Magar took his place as architect at the sultan‚Äôs court. =Architect Magar= Architect Magar () was charged with important projects and was consequently frequently promoted to higher ranks. However, as a result of a denunciation, he was driven away from the court of Sultan Mahmud I (1730-1754) to exile in the eastern Anatolian town of Bayburt. There, Magar taught his elder son Krikor architecture before being pardoned and returning to Istanbul. Following his retirement, his son Krikor took over his position. Magar‚Äôs second son Senekerim collaborated with his brother Krikor. Magar died in Bayburt.

He was called Baliyan or Balyan after his grandfather and later adopted this as the family name Balyan. He was the son-in-law of Mason Minas and father-in-law of Ohannes Amira Severyan, both of whom were palace architects. Krikor received his credential of architecture from Sultan Abdul Hamid I (r. 1774‚Äì87). He became unofficial advisor to Sultan Selim III (r. 1789‚Äì1807), and was close to Sultan Mahmud II (r. 1808‚Äì1839). He was exiled in 1820 to Kayseri in central Anatolia, because of his involvement in a dispute between Gregorian and Catholic Armenians. He was pardoned and allowed to return to Istanbul shortly after a friend of his in the palace, Amira Bezjian. Krikor died in 1831 after serving the empire during the reigns of four sultans, Abdul Hamid I (r. 1774‚Äì87), Selim III (r. 1789‚Äì1807), Mustafa IV (r. 1807‚Äì8)), and Mahmud II (r. 1808‚Äì39). His young and inexperienced son Garabet Amira succeeded him.

He worked together with his brother, but remained in the background. He rebuilt the Beyazit Fire Tower, which had been constructed in wood in 1826 by his brother Krikor, but destroyed after a fire. He died in Jerusalem and was buried in the Armenian church yard. Senekerim's works include the Beyazƒ±t Fire Tower (1828) and the Surp Asdvadzazdin Armenian Church in Ortak√∂y (1824). =Garabet Amira Balyan= Garabet Amira Balyan (; 1800‚Äì1866) was born in Constantinople. At his father's death, he was very young and not experienced enough to take over his father's position by himself. Thus he served alongside his uncle-in-law Mason Ohannes Serveryan. Garabet served during the reigns of Mahmud II (1808-1839), Abdul Mecid I (1839-1861), and Abdulaziz (1861-1876), and constructed numerous buildings in Istanbul. The best known of his works is Dolmabah√ße Palace, which he built in collaboration with his son Nigoƒüayos.Continuity and Change in Nineteenth-Century Istanbul:Sultan Abdulaziz and the Beylerbeyi Palace, Filiz Yenisehirlioglu, Islamic Art in the 19th Century: Tradition, Innovation, And Eclecticism, ed. Doris Behrens- Abouseif, Stephen Vernoit, (Brill, 2006), 65. Another notable architectural work of his is Beylerbeyi Palace, which was built in cooperation with his other son Sarkis. Garabet Balyan was also active in the Armenian community's educational and administrative matters and carried out research work on Armenian architecture. His four sons, Nigoƒüayos, Sarkis, Hagop, and Simon, succeeded him after he died of a heart attack in 1866 while conversing with friends.

In 1843, he was sent to Paris together with his brother Sarkis to study architecture at the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe de Paris. Due to an illness, however, he and his brother had to return to Istanbul in 1845. Working alongside his father Garabet, Nigoƒüayos gained experience. He was appointed arts advisor to Sultan Abdulmecid I (1839-1861). He founded also a school for domestic architects in order to teach Western architecture. Nigoƒüayos worked together with his father on the building of Dolmabah√ße Palace (1842-1856). He participated in the preparations for the Armenian National Constitution. Nigoƒüayos died in Istanbul in 1858 of typhoid fever at the age of 32.

In 1843, he followed his elder brother Nigoƒüayos to Paris. He had to return to Istanbul in 1845 due to an illness of his brother. In 1847, Sarkis went to Paris again to attend Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe de Paris, which he finished after three years. Later, he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts. After returning to Istanbul, Sarkis began working alongside his father and his brother Nigoƒüayos. Following the deaths of these two, he continued his work with the younger brother Hagop. Sarkis won greater fame than Hagop because he constructed the structures his brother designed. Sarkis is also known as the designer of many buildings. Known as a fast worker, his professional life was interrupted by the death of brother Hagop in 1875 and by Abd√ºlhamid II's accession to the throne (1876-1909). Due to political accusations, he was forced into exile in Europe for 15 years, but eventually returned to Turkey through the intercession of Hagop Kazazian Pasha on his behalf. His most important work is the Valide Sultan Kiosk. Interested in all branches of the fine arts, Sarkis supported Armenian writers, musicians, and particularly theater actors. He was also a member of the Armenian Patriarchate‚Äôs Assembly. He was awarded the title Ser Mimar (Chief Architect of Ottoman Empire).

In 1997, part of the Henbury playing fields were sold to private developers, to generate income to improve the sports facilities. A new all-weather pitch was opened in 1999. = The late '90s - 2007 = In September 2004, Henbury welcomed almost all of the students from the closing Ryles Park High School, Macclesfield. This expansion led to the construction of 12 new temporary classrooms and a large purpose built temporary sports hall. = Moved and renamed = In September 2007, Henbury moved from its present site into a newly built school on the new ¬£38 million development known as the Macclesfield Learning Zone about two miles away. Since the school was some distance from Henbury parish, it adopted the new name of Macclesfield High School. The old Henbury site became Jasmine Park, a new housing development site with amenities such as open park areas, leisure play areas and three new football fields as well as being home to new apartments and houses.  Uniform  The uniform was navy blue in colour: pupils had to wear a skirt or trousers in black, as well as a pale blue shirt, blue and white tie and a navy blue sweater, which was replaced by a pale blue polo shirt with the school logo. Since becoming Macclesfield High School the uniform has changed to: black skirt or trousers, blue blazer, blue and gold tie, white shirt, white socks or black/natural tights for girls, and grey/black socks for boys, black school shoes for all pupils.

Occasions where only partial capacity is available may or may not be deducted. Where they are deducted, the metric is titled equivalent availability factor (EAF). The availability factor should not be confused with the capacity factor. The capacity factor for a given period can never exceed the availability factor for the same period. The difference arises when the plant is run at less than full capacity, in which case the capacity factor is less than the availability factor. The availability of a power plant varies greatly depending on the type of fuel, the design of the plant and how the plant is operated. Everything else being equal, plants that are run less frequently have higher availability factors because they require less maintenance and because more inspections and maintenance can be scheduled during idle time. Most thermal power stations, such as coal, geothermal and nuclear power plants, have availability factors between 70% and 90%. Newer plants tend to have significantly higher availability factors, but preventive maintenance is as important as improvements in design and technology. Gas turbines have relatively high availability factors, ranging from 80% to 99%. Gas turbines are commonly used for peaking power plants, co-generation plants and the first stage of combined cycle plants. Originally the term availability factor was used only for power plants that depended on an active, controlled supply of fuel, typically fossil or later also nuclear. The emergence of renewable energy such as hydro, wind and solar power, which operate without an active, controlled supply of fuel and which come to a standstill when their natural supply of energy ceases, requires a more careful distinction between the availability factor and the capacity factor. By convention, such zero production periods are counted against the capacity factor but not against the availability factor, which thus remains defined as depending on an active, controlled supply of fuel, along with factors concerning reliability and maintenance. A wind turbine cannot operate in wind speeds above a certain limit, which counts against its availability factor. With this definition, modern wind turbines which require very little maintenance, have very high availability factors, up to about 98%. Photovoltaic power stations which have few or no moving parts and which can undergo planned inspections and maintenance during night have an availability factor approaching or equal to 100% when the sun is shining.

According to Frattini, the cartoons foment hostility against Islam and foreigners. The European Union on 2006-01-30, said that any retaliatory boycott of Danish goods would violate world trade rules. On February 15, 2006, the European Parliament accepted a resolution which condemns all violence arising from the publication of the cartoons. It stated that the EU stands in solidarity with Denmark and all other countries that have been affected by the violence. Furthermore, it stated that Muslims may be offended by the cartoons and that they have the right to protest peacefully. However the freedom of speech is absolute and may not be affected by any form of censorship. Organisation of the Islamic Conference The OIC member states held a meeting in Jeddah on February 14, 2006, to discuss the publication of the cartoons. The ambassadors felt that the reaction of the Danish authorities on the issue was \\"under par\\" compared to the reaction of other European states which condemned the publication of the cartoons and considered it as a provocation and an incitement to hatred. The member states approved a five-point plan which the OIC Secretary General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu had proposed to Javier Solana on February 7, 2006. The plan called for: :# the European Union to adopt legislative measures against Islamophobia; :# the OIC and the EU to work towards a UN Resolution on the lines of the existing UN Resolution 60/150 (Combating defamation of religions) which should prohibit defamation of all prophets and faiths; :# the European media to adopt a code of ethics; :# the United Nations to adopt an International Communication Media Order covering a definition of freedom of speech in case of religious symbols; :# the inclusion of a paragraph prohibiting blasphemy, defamation of religions and incitement to hatred in the text of the Human Rights Council resolution presently being negotiated. Previously, on January 1, 2006, the OIC decided to boycott a project called \\"Images of the Middle East\\" which was to be organized by the Danish Center for Culture and Development and partially financed by the Danish Government. The press release mentions that the Third Extraordinary Session of the Islamic Summit Conference addressed this issue and stressed \\"the responsibility of all governments to ensure full respect of all religions and religious symbols, stating that the freedom of expression does not justify in any way whatsoever the defamation of religions.\\" On January 28, 2006, the OIC Secretary General called for \\"Muslims to stay calm and peaceful in the wake of sacrilegious depiction of Prophet Muhammad which has deeply hurt their feelings\\". =States=Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai called the printing of the images a mistake, and hoped that this would lead to the media being more responsible and respectful in the future. Bahrain Bahrain's parliament demanded an apology from the government, as well as from Denmark's head of state, the Danish king, unaware that Denmark's head of state is Queen Margrethe II. MPs called for an extraordinary session of parliament to discuss the cartoons, while protestors set Danish dairy products and bacon ablaze. Al-Menbar Islamic Society MP Mohammed Khaled has demanded that Arab leaders take action: \\"We are stunned by the silence of the Arab leaders. They don't tolerate any criticism against them, yet allow others to insult the Prophet.\\" Bangladesh Foreign Minister Morshed Khan stated before parliament that a diplomatic protest was lodged with the government of Denmark on November 7, 2005. Further, he requested the Danish government issue an apology and urged them to prevent further occurrences of \\"such heinous acts.\\" Belarus On January 18, 2008, an editor of an independent newspaper who reproduced cartoons of the muslim Prophet Mohammad was jailed for three years. Belgium In Belgium, the parliament accepted a resolution to defend the freedom of speech and to support Denmark. Bosnia and Herzegovina On February 8, 2006, Muslims in Sarajevo organized a protest against the cartoons. They delivered a letter demanding an apology for the publication of the cartoons to staff at the Danish, Norwegian and French embassies. The flags of Norway, Denmark and Croatia were burnt. Canada Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a statement on February 14, 2006, that said Canadians have the right to free speech as well as the right to voice their opinions about the free speech of others. He said that he \\"regretted\\" that several Canadian newspapers had chosen to run the cartoons after the controversy began. \\"While we understand this issue is divisive, our government wishes that people be respectful of the beliefs of others.\\" Harper also commended the Canadian Muslim community for voicing its opinion peacefully, respectfully and democratically. Foreign affairs minister Peter MacKay released a statement commenting that \\"This sensitive issue highlights the need for a better understanding of Islam and of Muslim communities... [to] promote a better understanding of Islam internationally, in partnership with Muslim communities.\\" Czech Republic After Iran sent a formal strong objection to the Czech government against the publication of the cartoons in MF DNES and Hospod√°≈ôsk√© noviny, the newspapers insisted that it was necessary for them to publish the pictures so that the readers get the full information. The Czech foreign minister Cyril Svoboda called the Muslim reaction \\"exaggerated\\" and advocated a united European stand on the issue.Khaleejtimes.com President V√°clav Klaus argued that freedom of speech is only meaningful as a contract between a citizen and a particular government. The Czech government expressed solidarity with Denmark. Egypt In December 2005, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque and Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar University, issued a statement saying that \\"Al-Azhar intends to protest these anti-Prophet cartoons with the UN's concerned committees and human rights groups around the world.\\"Al-Azhar Takes Anti-Prophet Danish Cartoons to UN - Islamonline.net, December 11, 2005, islamonline.net In early January the Egyptian government threatened Denmark with an embargo of Danish products, but did not carry out its threat.

November 1, 2006, news.bbc.co.uk Finland In February, Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs Erkki Tuomioja said that Denmark should have acted earlier and paid more attention to Muslim outrage over the offensive caricatures. He added that the Danish government could apologise for the fact that religious feelings were offended, without endangering freedom of expression. The party of indigenous Finnish Muslims, the Finnish Islamic Party, said that it had issued a statement to the media that it condemns the republication of the caricatures and that \\"We also condemn the Danish government for not interfering in issues that causes confrontation between Islamic world and non-Islamic world. Reissuing the caricatures will cause widely spread agitation because things that Muslims hold sacred have been insulted. Therefore The Finnish Islamic Party exhorts to boikot Danish products everywhere.\\" (verbatim)http://www.suomenislamilainenpuolue.fi/tiedotteetEN.html Police opened investigations into the publication of the cartoons by far-right wing ultra nationalist Suomen Sisu group. In Finland it is illegal to \\"disturb religious peace\\" (literal translation). This law is rarely prosecuted, giving this incident nationwide attention. The cartoons have been published on numerous Finnish web sites but not in mainstream media. Police declined to comment which site or sites are being investigated, and said any media that publishes the cartoons will be similarly investigated.HS.fi On February 24, 2006 Kaltio, a culture magazine in northern Finland, got publicity for publishing cartoon of a masked muslim prophet MuhammadPaha.suojelupoliisi.org which lampooned Finnish political elites' reaction during the cartoon debate. After that some large financial institutions withdrew their advertisements from Kaltio and the board of the magazine fired their longtime editor Jussi Vilkuna.Brusselsjournal.com France On February 6, 2006, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin condemned the violence that had occurred internationally in response to the cartoons, but called for tolerance and respect toward other faiths. The French foreign minister supported the right to free press, but added that it must be used \\"in a spirit of tolerance and with respect for beliefs and religions\\". Nicolas Sarkozy, then Interior Minister and presidential candidate, said on LCI television that he \\"preferred an excess of caricature to an excess of censorship\\" and pointed out that it is, if necessary, up to the courts to judge whether caricatures go beyond what is reasonable to publish, and not to the governments of Muslim countries. Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel said that while she understands that feelings were hurt by the caricatures, violent reactions were unacceptable. She stressed the central role of freedom of expression, and called for dialogue. \\"Denmark must not feel let alone in this issue\\". Merkel also said that she understands this to be the common position of the E.U. Indonesia President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono says the Indonesian government condemned the publication of caricature of the muslim Prophet Muhammad. \\"The publication of the caricature of course reflects a lack of sensitivity to the views and belief of other religious adherents,\\" he said. However, as \\"religious people\\", he recommends to \\"accept the apology\\". Iran On February 2, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ordered contracts to be cancelled with all countries where media have published the cartoons. On February 5, Iran recalled their ambassador from Denmark, and banned Danish journalists from reporting from Iran. Iran's supreme religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on February 6, 2006, that a \\"Zionist conspiracy\\" was to blame for the row over the muslim Prophet Muhammad cartoons, in his first reaction to the controversy: \\"The reason for the Zionist action is because of the loss they suffered by Hamas winning\\". Khamenai was referring to Hamas victory in the Palestinian legislative election. In fact, the Palestinian election took place almost four months after the cartoons were first posted. Former Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami who is also the theorist of Dialogue Among Civilizations, strongly criticized the Danish cartoons for \\"spreading hatred\\", but added that the Muslim world is not entirely blameless either: > Offending and insulting, is different from expressing an opinion that can be > analyzed, argued on, and can eventually be accepted or rejected [therefore > offending others is not acceptable] ... But in addition to the west, we > ourselves also have problems in this regard. Instead of logical criticism or > debate, we only keep saying offensive things about liberalism, democracy and > modernism. I had told some of our elders before, that the religion of the > today's world is 'liberalism' and we have no right to make insults about it. > We should not keep using phrases such as \\"the corrupt culture of the west\\" > etc. in our words. As it's also said in the Koran, \\"Do not insult the gods > of others, otherwise you are indirectly insulting your God\\".Isna.ir , > February 15, 2006.BBC.co.uk.co.uk There was a recommendation for the term for a \\"Danish\\" pastry to be changed to \\"Gole Mohammadi\\"(in Persian: Mohammadi Flower). The Iranian newspaper Hamshahri retaliated by organizing a holocaust cartoon competition. Jyllands- Posten was challenged to print the winning cartoons of the competition. It agreed at first but after the competition results were announced, Jyllands- Posten backed down and did not explain why it decided not to print the winning cartoons of the Holocaust cartoon competition. Hamshahri maintained that Jyllands-Posten was never interested in freedom of speech but was just spreading hate ideology. Some Iranian organizations and media have also backed the publications of cartoons with actions such as organizing demonstrations abroad, republishing caricatures, publishing articles defending them, showing them through Satellite Channels or talk about them in radio. The following Iranian Organizations are among those who backed the \\"Freedom of Speech\\" and publication of Caricatures: Atheists Society, Communist Youth Organization, Communist Youth Organization-Hekmatist, Organization of Iranian Blogwriters, Organization of Women Emancipation, Organization of Women Liberation, Worker- Communist Party of Iran, Worker-Communist Party of Iran-Hekmatist and Organization of Unity of Iranian People Fedayis. Iran amended ¬ß224-1 of its penal code (prohibition of apostasy, magic and religious innovation, punishable by death, no evidence or witness testimony required - only \\"the judge's views and impressions\\") to also cover Defamation of the Prophet [Muhammed]. Iraq Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani condemned the cartoons but also commented about militants who discredit Islam by their acts. Sistani underlined how un-Islamic acts of extremism are used as justification to attack Islam. Ireland Irish president Mary McAleese condemned the cartoons as designed to provoke, designed to be rude and designed to inflame. She also condemned the violent protests against the cartoons. Italy On February 14, Italy's Reform Minister Roberto Calderoli had T-shirts made emblazoned with cartoons of the muslim Prophet Mohammad in a move likely to embarrass Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government. Calderoli, a member of the anti-immigrant Northern League party, told Ansa news agency on Tuesday that the West had to stand up against Islamic extremists and offered to hand out T-shirts to anyone who wanted them.News.yahoo.com Lebanon The Lebanese minister of foreign affairs criticised the drawings saying that freedom of speech ends when sacred values are offended. \\"Les r√©actions √† travers le monde\\", nouvelobs.com, 2006-02-03 Libya Libya recalled its ambassador and announced that it would close its embassy in Denmark. The consular section of the embassy has since reopened. Malaysia Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, current chairman of Organisation of the Islamic Conference says \\"This is a deliberate act of provocation. They should cease and desist from doing so.\\"\\"M'sia Expresses Regret Over Publication Of Prophet's Caricatures \\" Bernama 2006-02-03 Netherlands The Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Jan-Peter Balkenende, issued the following statement (translated): \\"I regret the threats from the Muslim world. In our world, when someone crosses a line, we take the matter to court. There is no place here for threats and own direction. (I am) Glad there is freedom of speech here. At the same time we have to realize that our images and ideas can be provocative to others.\\" New Zealand The cartoons were published by two major daily newspapers, the Dominion Post and the Christchurch Press (both owned by Fairfax of Australia), and by two smaller newspapers, the Nelson Mail and the National Business Review. Fleeting glimpses were also shown on two television networks reporting on the issue. The publication ignited a national debate and prompted a peaceful street protest by New Zealand Muslims in Auckland. The publication of the cartoons was condemned by Prime Minister Helen Clark and opposition leader Don Brash, although they both stated that such decisions were up to newspaper editors to make. New Zealand has good trading relations with many Islamic countries and there were concerns that the controversy would threaten this. Shortly thereafter the newspapers agreed not to republish the cartoons, and New Zealand Muslim groups, while condemning the cartoons, have asked Muslim countries not to boycott New Zealand goods. Nigeria On February 7, the parliament of the State of Kano in the Muslim north of the country cancelled a ‚Ç¨23 million order for Danish buses and banned the sale of all Danish and Norwegian products.

On February 17, 2006, Ynetnews.com ran an AP article that claims that an Islamic cleric is offering a monetary reward and a new car for killing cartoonists (implied). Qureshi said. \\"This is a unanimous decision by all imams [prayer leaders] of Islam that whoever insults the prophet deserves to be killed and whoever will take this insulting man to his end, will get this prize,\\" Qureshi said.Ynetnews.com Poland Polish Prime-Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz said he considered cartoons to be an unnecessary provocation. The Polish government also said they are quite sorry that the newspaper Rzeczpospolita also offended Muslims. Russia The president of the Institute of the Middle East, Yevgeny Satanovsky, told Itar-Tass on February 6 that \\"The caricatures of Prophet Mohammad published as far back as last September angered the entire Islamic world but especially the countries where Iran's influence is the strongest, and the apex of the conflict coincided precisely with the discussion of the Iranian nuclear dossier at the International Atomic Energy Agency.\\" This theory is echoed by Scientific Council of the Moscow Carnegie Centre member, Alexei Malashenko, who believes that \\"the fuss around the caricatures was made artificially.\\" That is, at a time when the Muslim world has no concerted position either on the Iranian nuclear program or Hamas, whose ideology is opposed by moderate Islamic regimes, the caricature uproar provides a \\"pretext for showing how coherent Muslims are.\\" Saudi Arabia On January 26, 2006, Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassadors. South Africa An interdict was obtained to prevent newspapers in South Africa from publishing the cartoons. Independent Newspapers (South Africa) did however publish an article which Muslims alleged was blasphemous and for this reason protest marches were arranged. President Thabo Mbeki reacted to the granting of the interdict by saying that the courts had spoken and that anyone who had objections to the granting of the interdict could pursue the matter as allowed by the law. He went on to say that the courts had the obligation to balance rights of citizens to freedom of speech to those of others to be protected from harm or insult. On February 3 Mail & Guardian however does print the cartoons. Singapore The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) issued a statement that said \\"the inciting of hatred against a faith of a people is very unfortunate,\\" and that \\"[they] are fortunate and deeply appreciative that in Singapore, the media and the community at large have always been mindful of sensitivities‚Ä¶ and have helped to promote racial and religious harmony across society.\\" The Foreign Minister George Yeo and the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Dr. Yaacob Ibrahim have similarly said that the incident shows the need to respect racial and religious sensitivities, have a \\"responsible media,\\" and to cultivate good inter- religious relations and confidence beyond just legislation. Later, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the publication of the cartoons depicting Mohammad was provocative and wrong, but he expressed objection to violent response. Spain El Periodico published the cartoons on February 1, 2007. Sudan Danish-Sudanese relations are extremely poor, as are Sudanese relations with most western countries. On February 27, 2008, Sudan decided to boycott Danish goods after the controversial Muhammad cartoons were reprinted by a series of newspapers in Denmark and other European countries. Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir has backed up the country and other Muslim states, requiring them to boycott Danish products just as Sudan did. He even stated that \\"No Danes shall ever again be able to set foot in Sudan.\\" The two countries subsequently closed their respective embassies.http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sudan_boycotts_Danish_goods Sweden On February 5, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds stated the following in an interview: We support the freedom of speech, that I think is very clear. But at the same time it is important to say that with this freedom comes a certain responsibility, and it could be objectionable to act in a way that insults people. The nationalist party Swedish Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna) started a competition to draw cartoons of Muhammed on their web site. After words of exhortation from the Swedish government, and in particular from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds, the website was shut down. When the story caught wider attention, Freivalds felt it necessary to resign as Minister for having interfered with press freedom. (For details, see Swedish Democrats#The Mohammed cartoon debate and Laila Freivalds) Turkey Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, is quoted in the Turkish press saying: \\"Caricatures of Prophet Muhammad are an attack against our spiritual values. There should be a limit of freedom of press.\\" United Arab Emirates The Justice and Islamic Affairs Minister, Mohammed Al Dhaheri, calls the publication of the cartoon \\"cultural terrorism, not freedom of expression.\\" United Kingdom British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw criticized European newspapers for republishing the cartoons: \\"There is freedom of speech, we all respect that, ... But there is not any obligation to insult or to be gratuitously inflammatory. I believe that the republication of these cartoons has been unnecessary. It has been insensitive. It has been disrespectful and it has been wrong.\\" Straw also praises British newspapers for their \\"considerable responsibility and sensitivity\\" in not printing the cartoons. Notably, even Private Eye, a satirical magazine generally not afraid to publish controversial items, refused to publish the cartoons, instead printing textual descriptions of each of them in turn. The student newspaper of Cardiff University published the cartoons, but recalled all copies after protests from the university concerned. United States The U.S. government issued a statement saying: \\"We all fully recognize and respect freedom of the press and expression but it must be coupled with press responsibility. Inciting religious or ethnic hatreds in this manner is not acceptable.\\" A State Department spokesman said that the images were offensive, but added that the U.S. also supports the rights of individuals to express their freely held views and that it is not for the government to dictate what is printed in the media.Daily Press Briefing - February 3, State.gov In the U.S. State Department's daily briefing for Friday, February 3, official spokesman Sean McCormick, speaking for the current administration, said (in part), \\"Our response is to say that while we certainly don't agree with, support, or in some cases, we condemn the views that are aired in public that are published in media organizations around the world, we, at the same time, defend the right of those individuals to express their views. For us, freedom of expression is at the core of our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so. ... So we would urge all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding, the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue. And we would urge dialogue, not violence. And that also those that might take offense at these images that have been published, when they see similar views or images that could be perceived as anti-Semitic or anti- Catholic, that they speak out with equal vigor against those images.\\" Speaking in Qatar, former U.S. president Bill Clinton strongly criticized the Danish cartoons, comparing historical anti-Semitism in Europe with anti-Islamic feeling today: \\"So now what are we going to do? ... Replace the anti-Semitic prejudice with anti-Islamic prejudice?\\" Vatican City The Vatican issued a statement saying \\"The right to freedom of thought and expression, sanctioned by the Declaration of the Rights of Man, cannot imply the right to offend the religious sentiment of believers. This principle applies obviously for any religion.\\"Zenit.org Yemen A court in Yemen has sentenced a newspaper editor to a year in jail for reprinting Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.Yemen editor jailed over cartoons Violent protests The building housing the Danish embassy in Damascus, Syria burning after being stormed by demonstrators. =Deaths= *At least four protestors were killed in Afghanistan, in Mihtarlam and a US air base in Bagram.

An interview in the Russian media asserts that a US newspaper made the cartoons, and the Jyllands-Posten only distributed it.US Profited From Mohammed Cartoons Scandal ‚Äî Expert , mosnews.com, February 28, 2006, accessed August 11, 2006 This assertion is widely accepted in the Muslim world. The controversy produced labour strikes and protests in Pakistan, and mass demonstrations in Baghdad in Iraq. In the Palestinian territories, thousands of people participated in demonstrations and gunmen in the Gaza Strip threatened violence against any Scandinavians in the area. The European Union's Gaza offices were raided by 15 masked gunmen from the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. They demanded apologies from Denmark and Norway, but left 30 minutes later without any shots being fired or injuries caused. On February 2, Palestinian gunmen shut down the EU headquarters in Gaza, in protest of the Jyllands-Posten drawings. According to CNN, \\"Masked members of the militant groups Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinians' former ruling party, Fatah, fired bullets into the air, and a man read the group's demands. ... The gunmen left a notice on the EU office's door that the building would remain closed until Europeans apologize to Muslims, many of whom consider the cartoons offensive.\\" As of February 5, the demonstrations had become too numerous to list here; however, they are tracked on the timeline page. On February 6, at least four demonstrators in Afghanistan were shot by riot police, while taking part in an assault on the Bagram Airbase outside Kabul, another two died in Mihtarlam. As of February 24, at least 150 people, most of them Nigerian, had died during protests.Five days of violence by Nigerian Christians and Muslims kill 150 - Africa, World , independent.co.uk =Death threats= In response to the publication of the drawings, the UK Islamist group al Ghurabaa publish an article on their website entitled, \\"Kill those who insult the Prophet Muhammad\\". The article states, \\"The insulting of the Messenger Muhammad is something that the Muslims cannot and will not tolerate and the punishment in Islam for the one who does so is death. This is the sunnah of the prophet and the verdict of Islam upon such people, one that any Muslim is able execute.\\" al Ghurabaa had organised February 3 protest march from London Central Mosque to the Danish Embassy where protesters waived placards reading, \\"Butcher those who mock Islam\\", \\"Kill those who insult Islam\\", \\"Europe you will pay, your 9/11 is on the way\\", or \\"7/7 is on its way\\", \\"Europe you will pay, Bin Laden is on his way\\" and \\"Europe you'll come crawling, when the Mujahideen come roaring\\". Despite the similar theme on Al Ghurabaa's website, their spokesman, Anjem Choudary, said he did not know who wrote the placards. MPs from all parties condemned the protest, calling the Metropolitan Police to pursue those responsible on the grounds that the threats were an incitement to murder. =Churches= On January 29 six churches in the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Kirkuk were targeted by car bombs, killing 13-year-old worshipper Fadi Raad Elias. No militants claimed to be retaliating for the pictures, nor is this the first time Iraqi churches have been bombed;Geocities.com but the bishop of the church stated \\"The church blasts were a reaction to the cartoons published in European papers. But Christians are not responsible for what is published in Europe.\\" Many Assyrians in Iraq now feel like \\"Westerners should not give wild statements [as] everyone can attack us [in response]\\" and \\"Today I'm afraid to walk the streets, because I'm Christian.\\" On February 5, thousands of Muslims in Lebanon surrounded the Maronite Catholic Church and threw stones at it.News.Yahoo.com On February 6, an Italian Catholic priest named Andrea Santoro was reported to have been shot dead at the door-step of his church in the Black Sea port city Trabzon.

On February 2, some Palestinians in the West Bank handed out a leaflet signed by Islamic Jihad stating, \\"Churches in Gaza could come under attack\\". The Danish government announced that a fatwa had been declared against the Danish troops stationed in Iraq. The government responded by heightening security for its troops. =Burning embassies= On February 4, the Danish and Norwegian embassies in Damascus, Syria were set on fire, after being stormed by an angry mob. Within the building housing the Danish embassy were the Chilean and Swedish embassies, both having no formal connection to the present row. As it was a holiday, no one was present inside the building when this occurred, so no one was hurt. As a response to this incident, the Danish and Norwegian Ministries of Foreign Affairs issued a warning, urging their citizens in Syria to leave the country immediately. The German Cultural Centre in Gaza was raided by Palestinian students On February 5, the Danish consulate in Lebanon was set on fire by demonstrators, reportedly police and military tried to restrain them from doing so. In Tehran, on February 6, the Danish and Norwegian embassies were attacked by protestors. According to reports, homemade grenades were thrown at the embassies. However, the embassies weren't set ablaze. On October 19, ten ambassadors from Islamic countries, including Algeria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Morocco, Pakistan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, as well as the head of the Palestinian delegation in Denmark, sent a letter to Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen requesting a meeting and asking him to distance himself from hate speech, including remarks by MP Louise Frevert, Culture Minister of Denmark Brian Mikkelsen, and the Radio Holger station. Rasmussen declined, saying that the government could not interfere with the right to free speech, but said that cases of blasphemy and discrimination could be tried before the courts, a reaction essentially seen as a snub by the Muslims. On February 18, the Italian consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was set on fire by demonstrators. Police fired into the crowd, killing 11. =Nordic countries= On January 10, a marginal Norwegian Christian magazine, Magazinet, printed the drawings after getting authorization from Jyllands-Posten. Major newspapers in Norway had printed facsimiles from Jyllands-Posten and reproduced all the caricatures in their online versions; a few days earlier, the Swedish newspaper Expressen had printed two of the drawings in conjunction with an article discussing the event. However, it was the Magazinet printing that led to a great debate in Norway, and is assumed to be the reason for actions directed at Sweden and Norway. A Norwegian man made a threat against the lives of the people at the magazine, but later claimed, when faced by the police, that it was just a prank. The Norwegian Foreign Ministry sent a letter to their ambassadors in the Middle East stating that one of the pillars of the Norwegian society is freedom of speech, but they expressed regret that Magazinet did not respect Muslims' beliefs. On January 30, Palestinian groups demanded that all Scandinavians leave the Palestinian territories immediately. On January 30, an Islamic organisation, the Mujahedeen Army, called for militant attacks against \\"all available targets\\" in Denmark and Norway. On January 31, bomb threats were made against the newspaper's offices in √Örhus and Copenhagen. In Finland the biggest newspaper Helsingin Sanomat considered publishing the cartoons, however it did not publish them. Finland's comparatively small Muslim community held a peaceful demonstration with tens of demonstrators, close to the Danish embassy.

The character, created by writer and illustrator Anupam Sinha, first appeared in GENL #74 Pratishodh Ki Jwala published in April 1987 and since then, has appeared regularly in many issues published by Raj Comics. Super Commando Dhruva, whose complete name is Dhruva Mehra, is additionally referred to as Captain Dhruva by the cadets of his Commando Force. Super Commando Dhruva operates in the fictional Indian city of Rajnagar. He is the founder of a fictional government-approved crime fighter organization Commando Force. The character's appearance is distinctive and iconic: a yellow and sky blue costume, brown boots and a utility belt with a star-shaped buckle. The star has almost become a trademark of the character. The most unusual thing about Dhruva is that, unlike most other superheroes, he doesn't have an alter ego and doesn't hide his identity behind a mask. Another unique thing about him is that he doesn't possess any superpowers; but he makes up for that with his intellect, detective skills, ability to talk to almost every kind of animals, scientific knowledge, martial art and acrobatic skills, an unparalleled willpower and a determination to eliminate evil from this world. Dhruva became a very popular character soon after he was introduced. He is one of Raj Comics' most successful characters. Over the years, Dhruva has acquired an iconic status in the Indian comic book superhero genre. Fans have often raised the demand to convert Dhruva into a Bollywood movie characterhttp://www.bollywood.com/indian-comic-heroes-get-ready-big- screen Publication history=Creation= In the late 1980s, after the initial success of Nagraj, Raj Comics wanted another superhero for its titles. It was in this period that writer Anupam Sinha came up with the idea of Super Commando Dhruva. Dhruva's original design, as created by Sinha back in 1987, was an adolescent boy standing beside his bike wearing a yellow-blue trapeze artist costume, buttoned shirt collar, a black belt with star buckle, shoes (instead of boots), and with no gloves, mask, or cape, holding a helmet in his hand. The background of the image had a big star polygon and behind his left shoulder was a box containing \\"‡§ß‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§µ\\". Sinha wanted Dhruva to wear a helmet, making him a biker hero, but later on many changes were incorporated to the character's look, including the removal of the helmet. Sinha wanted to break away from the clich√© of superheroes with super-natural powers and alter egos. He wanted to create a superhero out of a normal adult human. Sinha, during the 2012 Indian Comic Con festival, recalled: \\"Children see the world very differently, and there is a reason for it. Every person seems like a giant to them and people can do something that they cannot. Like taking out a jar of toffees from the cupboard. And the adult is thus a superhero, because they can do something that the child cannot do. Kids see every person as a super hero. They are heavily dependent on other people. Tell me, when do you move out of reading comics? When you are an independent human being. Fantasy does not interest you all that much. The psychology of being dependent, of 'I must have a person along with me to protect me from any impending danger,' is essentially a child's psyche. That‚Äôs why I wrote this character Super Commando Dhruva.\\" Sinha's first two characters Space Star and Private Detective Kapil didn't become very popular, but served as the early drafts for Super Commando Dhruva. The name Dhruva and the star symbol given to the character were inspired by Dhruva Taara (Hindi: ‡§ß‡•ç‡§∞‡•Å‡§µ ‡§§‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ meaning Pole Star) which means someone who is determined, firm, and doesn't succumb to rough circumstances. Thus, Super Commando Dhruva was born: a normal adult with no supernatural power but a strong determination and will to fight against the odds much along the lines of Batman of DC Comics. Most fans feel that Dhruva's character is a mix of Batman and Robin. On one hand, his crime fighting style is very similar to that of Batman's and, on the other hand, his origin resembles to that of Robin's. In spite of these similarities, there are a lot of differences as well, most notably being the fact that Dhruva doesn't have an alter ego. Other similarities to Batman series are, Dhruva does not kill anyone and his girlfriend Natasha is daughter of a major villain Grand Master Robo. Batman's girlfriend Talia al Ghul is daughter of Ra's al Ghul. When questioned about the comparisons between characters of the Raj Comics universe and DC/Marvel universe at the 2012 Indian Comic Con Festival, Sanjay Gupta replied, \\"We had to devise a character from our own imagination that didn't have anything to do with them (Superman and Batman). Because if we had kept in mind how powerful Superman and Batman are... We would've reacted to it and somehow allowed that to play a part in our creative process. Our first goal was to make a total Indian character. We didn't want to copy. That wasn't going on in our heads. But we were definitely inspired by them. We are still inspired by them. Even today we don‚Äôt copy... We are inspired by them. After all, everything has an origin.\\" =Publication= Dhruva making his debut in Raj ComicsSuper Commando Dhruva made his first appearance in GENL #74 \\"Pratishodh Ki Jwala\\", published in 1987. A general (GENL) issue used to be a 30- to 32-page issue. Dhruva's first issue dealt with the origin of the character. In the next issue, GENL #79 \\"Roman Hatyara\\", Dhruva founded a government-approved crime fighter organisation Star Commando Force. GENL #147 \\"Swarg Ki Tabahi\\" introduced Chandika, the main supporting character of the Dhruva series. Eventually it was revealed that Chandika was his foster-sister Shweta Mehra. Over the course of next few issues, some key elements were added to Dhruva's character including star-line, star-blade, a utility belt, ability to communicate with dolphins and ability to breathe underwater. Sinha was very sure about one thing: minimal violence. He would not have Dhruva kill anyone as he wanted Dhruva to be a role model for young kids, his main audience. In the initial few issues, Dhruva carried a pistol as a measure of last resort, but never used it. (Dhruv used the pistol in Aadamkhoro ka Swarg. He used and fired two rounds on the Rhino-men in the Nagu Islands). This was the first and last time he ever used his gun. Soon after, the pistol was removed from the character. During the initial few years, Anupam Sinha preferred to work alone on his brain-child Dhruva, both writing as well as illustrating all Dhruva titles on his own while the cover arts for the titles were mostly supplied by Vijay Kadam, an independent freelance artist. In 1991, when Raj Comics decided to publish its first special (SPCL) issue, they aptly chose to title it, SPCL #1 \\"Nagraj aur Super Commando Dhruva\\" which featured Nagraj and Dhruva in prominent roles alongside other Raj Comics superheroes. This issue brought Nagraj and Dhruva together for the first time. In this issue, Dhruva was shown to kill a lot of criminals. This was due to the fact that this issue was written by Sanjay Gupta, the writer of Nagraj, and not by Sinha. The next special issue was a landmark issue in many ways. SPCL #2 \\"Grand Master Robo\\" was the first solo-hero special issue published by Raj Comics and Dhruva's first solo special issue. It added a lot of new elements to the character's story. It introduced Swarna Nagri (Golden City), which is located at the base of the ocean and hidden from human eyes. Swarna Nagri is the home of Swarna Manavas (Golden Humans), descendants of Devs (Gods). Dhananjay, a warrior from Swarna Nagri, initially fought Dhruva, but became his friend and gave him the power to breathe inside water. This issue also introduced Natasha, daughter of Grand Master Robo and Dhruva's love interest. Natasha went on to become the first and only person to know Chandika's secret identity. Dhruva's ability to communicate with animals and birds was well established but this issue explored Dhruva's ability to communicate with dolphins as well. In 1993, Black Cat (alter ego: Richa) was introduced in a self-titled issue to further complicate Dhruva's love life. Initially, Dhruva's stories were detective- based stories, with science fiction elements as well. With the success of special issues, Raj Comics scrapped the publishing of general issues for its top two heroes Dhruva and Nagraj, although they continued to publish general issues for other superheroes. From 1991 to 1995, the frequency of Dhruva's solo general issues kept on decreasing and solo special issues kept on increasing. GENL #585 \\"Chandakal Ki Wapasi\\", published in 1995, was the character's last solo general issue. Since then, Dhruva has only been seen in the special issues. With this transition from general issues to special issues, Sinha's storytelling also changed. Dhruva's comics now contain more science fiction-based time and space travels. Instead of fighting thugs, he was now fighting against supervillains, aliens, and even demons. He was not solving cases anymore, but was saving the world from bigger threats. Although a few fans objected to this transformation of the character, most accepted this change. In spite of this flurry of sci-fi/mythical superhero acts, Sinha strived not to lose the basic essence of the character. In the midst of these superhero acts, Sinha came up with some iconic and critically acclaimed issues exploring Dhruva's personal life and human side of his character. One such issue was SPCL #64 \\"Commander Natasha\\", published in 1996. This issue dealt with Robo's and Natasha's past and brought turmoil in Dhruva's love life eventually ending with Natasha leaving Dhruva and joining Robo's crime syndicate once again. Although Dhruva's origin was explained very clearly in his first issue itself, not much was known about his family background. SPCL #100 \\"Khooni Khandaan\\" published in 1997 was a landmark issue in many ways. Not only was it the hundredth special issue published by Raj Comics, it was also the first of an iconic three part series that dealt with Dhruva's family background. Dhruva comes to know that his biological father was actually a French citizen on the run, wanted for murder. What ensues was an emotional journey for Dhruva to prove his dead father's innocence and remove the stigma of being a murderer from his name. SPCL #2245 \\"Gupt\\", dealt with the turmoils and side effects of being a superhero without an alter ego. A new supervillain Alchemist targeted Dhruva's foster family forcing him to wonder whether it was a mistake to become a crime fighter without a secret identity and jeopardising his family's security. Around the year 1995, when Sanjay Gupta got busy with the development of a new superhero Doga, he handed over the job of writing and drawing Nagraj to Anupam Sinha. This paved the way for one of the greatest superhero partnerships in Raj Comics. Dhruva and Nagraj, though popular individually, failed to make a mark when they came together twice before, both issues written by Sanjay Gupta. In 1996, Sinha came up with SPCL #67 \\"Rajnagar Ki Tabahi\\". This mega 90 page issue brought the 2 superheroes together for the third time overall but for the first time under the writing of Anupam Sinha. It was a huge critical and commercial success for Raj Comics. Raj Comics went on to declare the year 1997 as Nagraj Dhruva Double Action Year. This year saw all Raj Comics heroes featuring in two hero crossover issue with each other. Nagraj and Dhruva too featured in two back to back 90 pages two hero issues that year, \\"Pralay\\" & \\"Vinaash\\", as part of the celebration of Nagraj Dhruva Double Action Year. Since then both Nagraj and Dhruva have appeared in many two-hero and multi-hero issues all of which have been huge hits. The biggest and most ambitious project of Raj Comics, \\"Nagayana\\", based on Hindu epic Ramayana, was an 8 part futuristic series set in an alternate universe published in a span of 3 years from 2007 to 2009. This series too was a two hero project featuring Nagraj and Dhruva. Fans have likened the partnership of Nagraj-Dhruva with the Superman-Batman partnership in DC Comics, an invincible superhero and a superhero with no supernatural powers. Dhruva was one of the few Indian comic book heroes that continued to be published regularly during The Dark Age of Indian Comics between 1997 and 2003 owing to his dedicated fan base. While most of the Indian comic book publishing companies were shutting shops, Sinha continued to give timely boosts to Raj Comics through Dhruva- Nagraj crossover partnerships. In 2000, SPCL #185 \\"Kohraam\\" was published which brought almost all superheroes together. Eventually in 2001, SPCL #235 \\"Zalzalaa\\" was published in which a superhero team \\"Brahmand Rakshak\\" (Protectors of the Universe) was formed, much on the lines of The Avengers and The Justice League. All Raj Comics superheroes including Dhruva became a member of this team. From 1987 to 2010, Anupam Sinha worked on every single Dhruva solo titles as well as most of the multi-hero titles featuring Dhruva. All these years, various writers worked on Dhruva (most notably Jolly Sinha) but Anupam Sinha was always attached to Dhruva titles in some or the other way, as a writer/co-writer and/or artist. In 2010 though, much to the disappointment of the fans, he declared that he will be taking an indefinite break from Super Commando Dhruva. He wrote his last solo title for Dhruva in 2010 and ironically, or rather aptly, titled it \\"Game Over\\". Sinha continued to work on Nagraj solo titles as well as multi-hero titles featuring Nagraj and Dhruva but stopped working on solo Dhruva titles. Raj Comics studio handed over the job of Dhruva solo titles to younger writers/artists. Sinha always maintained a character continuity in his storylines throughout his solo and crossovers storylines. After Sinha left, with multiple writers working on the character simultaneously, it became more and more unclear as to which Dhruva storyline belongs to the original continuity and which does not. New Writers added subtle changes to the character, although keeping the basic essence of the character still intact. They tried to introduce some new facets to the character. Writer Abhishek Sagar tried to break away from the Anupam Sinha style of writing by giving his stories darker undertones. Even the artists showed the tendency to use darker colors in Sagar's stories unlike Sinha whose artwork used to be brighter and more colorful. Nitin Mishra came up with contemporary storylines like 'Hum Honge Kamyaab' in 2010, which was his take on the controversies attached with the Commonwealth Games conducted in India in 2010. In this title Dhruva was shown to be more tech-savvy as compared to his earlier versions. In 'Samudri Lutere', Nitin Mishra showed a happier and brighter side of Dhruva. In this title, one of the Toads mentioned that Dhruva is a lover boy and Dhruva even displayed his musical talent as a good flautist. In Mandar Gangele's 'Gehri Chaal', Dhruva shot an ad for 'Anti- smoking campaign'. This was in contrast to Sinha's Dhruva who never showed any inclination towards music, acting or solving realistic cases based on contemporary issues. In October 2012, Raj comics launched Nagraj-Pratishodh Ki Jwala Silver Jubilee Edition at the 2nd Mumbai Films and Comics Convention. It was a deluxe edition that contained the reprints of the debut issues of Nagraj and Dhruva on jumbo (34.6 * 24.8 cm) sized papers to celebrate the completion of 25yrs of the two most popular characters of Raj comics. In December 2014, a series named \\"Bal Charit\\" was launched, with its first issue \\"Hunters\\" being released. This series is projected to be a milestone, with Dhruv's childhood to be told in great detail for the first time. In 2015, \\"Rajnagar Rakshak\\" series was launched, with the first issue of the same name being released in January. This series is special because Dhruv is featured for first time with Inspector Steel in a 2 in 1 comic, despite both the superheroes being in action in the same city for a long time. Fictional character biography Dhruva was born to a couple who worked as trapeze artists in Jupiter Circus. He received most of his martial art, acrobatic, and stunt training in the circus itself. At the age of 14, having lost his parents in a conspiracy that arose out of a business rivalry, he swore to fight against crime for the rest of his life. Eventually he was adopted by the then Superintendent of Police Rajan Mehra. Dhruva was born to Shyam and Radha, two trapeze artists who used to perform in Jupiter Circus situated on the outskirts of Rajnagar. Dhruva was brought up in the circus itself. Growing up amongst the tigers, elephants, and other pet animals of the circus, Dhruva learnt to communicate with the animals. Dhruva was loved by every Jupiter Circus performer, started learning their respective skills from them. Strongman Hercules taught him body building. Ringmaster taught him how to control animals. He learned to throw knives from the knife thrower, along with shooting and bike stunts. At the age of 14, he started performing in Jupiter Circus shows and his stunning performances helped Jupiter to become a hugely popular circus. Boss, the owner of rival Globe Circus, hatched a conspiracy to destroy Jupiter Circus and sent Jubisko, his strongman and Bond, a sharpshooter to do the task. Jubisko burnt the Jupiter Circus killing everyone in it including Dhruva's parents. Dhruva who survived the carnage, vowed to avenge the deaths of his loved ones and eliminate the evil from the society. The series of events that followed resulted in the shutting down of Globe Circus as well. Later, the city police chief Rajan Mehra adopted Dhruva as his own son. Dhruva chose to carry on his struggle against crime choosing Rajnagar as the base of his operation. Characterization=Physical attributes= Dhruva is a young adult who started his crime fighting career at a young age of 14. He is probably the youngest amongst all Raj comics superheroes. He is not really bulky, muscular or heavily built. Instead, he has an athletic, flexible and strong body. Although Spanish writer Chris Wright opined that the character \\"has the most pronounced calf muscles of any superhero\\". The following are the vital statistics of the character as of 18 June 2007 as described on Raj Comics official website: * Age : 23yrs * Hair : Black * Eyes : Black * Height : 6' * Weight : 78 kg =Personality traits= Dhruva is eating eggs in breakfast Dhruva comes out as a humble, gentle and down to earth kind of personality. He is very soft-spoken and mild-mannered guy who respects his elders. He is always well dressed with buttoned collar and sports well kept hairs. Anupam Sinha knew that being a hero with no superpowers and no alter ego, Dhruva was probably the closest thing to reality in a world of comic book superheroes, a character that children could relate to, a character that children could try to emulate. Sinha wanted Dhruva to become a role model for the kids. He wanted to show the kids that one can be tough as well as well mannered at the same time. In Sinha's words: \\"I wanted to show that a well behaved and well brought up child should not fear being called a wimp.\\" Sinha also gave Dhruva a very 'morally correct' image. Dhruva has been shown to have utmost respect for human life and has vowed not to take a human life ever. Dhruva never takes law in his hands and always works in conjunction with the law enforcing bodies. He believes that as a protector of the city of Rajnagar, his only job is to catch the criminal alive and hand him over to the police and the court shall decide the punishment for the criminal. As a result, there is always an air of uneasiness between Dhruva and some of his allies including Black Cat and Doga who don't think twice before killing a criminal, and he always makes it a point not to let them take the law in their hands in front of his eyes. Dhruva also doesn't hit a woman in principle. Even while facing a female enemy, he tries to disarm her without actually hitting or inflicting physical harm to her. Dhruva received such strong moral codes from his biological parents during his childhood and subsequently during his adolescence from his foster parents. Dhruva has also been shown to be a man of his words and a one-woman man. Though lot of girls swoon on him including his very close friend Richa (Black Cat), who loves him very deeply, Dhruva has always made it very clear to her that his heart belongs only to Natasha, his first love. Inside this tough superhero exterior, Dhruva has a sense of humor too. Dhruva often indulges in healthy sibling rivalry, leg-pulling and playing pranks with his foster-sister Shweta and loves his foster family very much. Dhruva has never been shown to be a drinker or a smoker. Dhruva has been shown to be a non- vegetarian. Powers, abilities and resources Dhruva displaying his abilities in Jupiter Circus showDhruva has no inherent superhuman powers. His only supernatural power seems to be the ability to communicate with most animals and birds which he learned in his childhood, while growing up in Jupiter circus, playing with circus's pet animals. He can communicate with various animals ranging from a dog to a lion and most birds. The only animal that he can not communicate with is a gorilla, as shown in \\"Bahri Maut\\". Dhruva can also communicate with dolphins, an art taught to him by Anna, who used to conduct dolphin shows in Jupiter circus. These animals often help Dhruva in various tasks ranging from transportation, reporting him of an occurrence of a crime in front of their eyes to even assisting him in his fights. Another supernatural power acquired by Dhruva is the ability to breathe and talk inside water. Dhruva received this power as a gift from his good friend Dhananjay, a resident of Swarna Nagri, an underwater city located on the seabed not very far from Indian sea shores, which is home to Swarna Manavas, the descendants/bloodline of Gods. Their technology is far more advanced as compared to humans which allowed Dhananjay to fit a chip inside Dhruva's neck by a short surgical procedure, there by providing Dhruva the ability to speak and breathe inside water. Although Dhruva does not possess any inherent superpowers, he makes up for it with his detective skills, scientific knowledge and acrobatics and martial art skills. Dhruva is known to possess a high level intellect. His deductive reasoning and lateral thinking combined with his presence of mind and scientific knowledge regarding laws of physics allow him to make innovative use of harmless objects lying around to defeat his enemies. Spanish columnist Wright noted that Dhruva \\"has a MacGyver-like ability to use a paper clip or soup spoon to defeat enemies\\". Dhruva has been shown as the most intelligent and knowledgeable amongst all superheroes of Raj comics universe. He is a master strategist and tactician. In crossovers, the other superheroes make use of their superpowers according to Dhruva's plans to defeat powerful enemies. He is also a master escapologist. In 'Commando Force', Black Cat compares him to Houdini, while Nagraj once trapped in an enemy's trap wonders, \\"What would have Dhruva done, had he been in my place?\\" to get inspirational idea. Dhruva is physically very strong. He received strength training from Hercules, circus's strongman. He is also adept at trapeze, balancing and other acrobatic arts that he learned from his own parents. His body has great flexibility and great reflexes, so much so that he can even dodge bullets. He is expert in most forms of martial arts and hand-to-hand combat techniques. He is also expert in free running and has been shown to jump, climb and swing through various obstacles and skyscrapers to chase down his enemies. He is an excellent marksman, thanks to the training he received from circus's knife throwing expert Ranjan and shooting expert Sulaiman. Though Dhruva despises firearms in principle, he makes good use of his marksmanship while using his star blades (Dhruva's personalised shurikens) to disarm or injure his enemy. Dhruva can even hit a target or fight an enemy blind-folded by judging the faint noises of their movements. Dhruva is an expert biker and stunter. He learned stunt motorcycling from motorcyclist Pawan, who used to display his wall of death stunts in Jupiter Circus. Dhruva is so adept at controlling and balancing his bike that it is famously said that Dhruva's bike is nothing but a part of his body. Dhruva has been shown to have received special permission from Road Traffic department so that the traffic restrictions including traffic signals, one way, overtaking prohibition, speed limits and other such restrictions that can hamper his duties don't apply to him. Dhruva is also a licensed pilot and flies his own aircraft/jets throughout the world. Dhruva's greatest strength is his unparalleled willpower that keeps him going in toughest of circumstances. He has been shown to possess the greatest willpower known to mankind. His indomitable will makes him rather immune from mind control, hypnosis and other mind tricks employed by his enemies possessing psychic powers. Such attacks rarely work on him, and when they do, Dhruva quickly manages to come out of their effect. Dhruva has also developed the ability to hold his breath for 20mins. which helps him against poisonous gas attacks. Dhruva is also the founder and captain of a government approved crime fighting organisation \\"Commando Force\\", which has earned Dhruva the titles such as Captain Dhruva and Super Commando. Dhruva is also a master of disguise and has made full use of his talent in titles such as 'Lahu Ke Pyase' and 'Nagadheesh'. Dhruva has always had full support of the police department and full access to all police records and classified documents, not only because his foster father Rajan Mehra is the Inspector General of Police but also because Dhruva has always had utmost respect for the law enforcing bodies and has never taken law in his hands. Later, being a member of Brahmand Rakshak, Dhruva, along with all the other members of the team, was honorarily awarded the powers and rights equivalent to a Commissioner of Police. =Costume= Dhruva used to wear a yellow leotard over blue full body spandex bodysuit, a brown belt with a star shaped buckle and a pair of brown shoes while performing for Jupiter circus as a 14yr old. After the Jupiter circus carnage, when Dhruva started his fight against crime and evil, he continued wearing the same circus costume. Later, his belt was converted into a utility belt in which he could carry many useful items. Dhruva does not wear any cape, mask or helmet. Instead, as Wright pointed out, he prefers to sport a \\"solid-looking helmet of hair\\". Sinha made the first and the only major overhaul till date in the character's attire ten years later in 1998. In the title 'Dhruva-shakti', Dhruva's sister Shweta, a budding scientist, gave him some assortments that included a metallic bracelet each for both his hands. While the right bracelet had a cartridge of star blades, the left had a cartridge of star-line. Dhruva could shoot either of them with just a pull of a lever as against the older days when he had to take them out of his belt pocket and then throw them manually. She also gave him a metallic utility belt as against the older leather one with a star buckle with built-in star-transmitter and a built-in locking system so that no one could cut or pull his belt off from his waist. She also gave him a metallic holding strap for his boots and a wheel cover with push-back wheels that would convert his boots into roller skates with the flip of a switch. Apart from this, Dhruva's appearance remained unchanged throughout the years. Although Nagayana, the futuristic series set in alternate universe, allowed Sinha to experiment with Dhruva's looks. =Equipment= Dhruva is not really into too much high tech gadgetry. Whatever little equipments he makes use of, most of them have the word 'star-' prefixed to them, which gives it a slight campy feel. Four things that really define the character are star-blades, star-line, utility belt and Dhruva's special motorbike. Star-blade is Dhruva's personalised shuriken like razor sharp weapon. Although potentially lethal, Dhruva rarely uses them in a lethal way. Mostly Dhruva uses his star-blades to disarm his enemy or cut something. Dhruva shoots star-blades from his right hand bracelet. Star-line, on the other hand, is a thin rope made of nylo-steel which can not be cut, burnt or broken easily. Star-line is attached to a star- shaped grappling hook at one end. Dhruva uses his left hand bracelet, which contains star-line, like a grapple gun and can climb up or swing from one skyscraper to another like Batman. Dhruva mentions in one of his titles that he should meet Batman someday and thank him personally for inventing this style which is very handy especially in case of traffic jams. He also uses star-line to trip or tie up his enemy. Dhruva's preferred mode of transport is his special motorbike. The bike is specially designed and optimised to suit his needs. Dhruva's bike is remote control enabled, so that he can start and operate his bike even from a distance. Dhruva's bike has undergone innumerable design changes from the old fashioned 1980s design to a modernised sports bike look. Among all designs one common factor has been that the bike never had any attached firearm to it. It is said that the sound of the engine of Dhruva's bike is unique and different from any other bike and can be easily identified. Dhruva also owns a star helicopter, a star plane (a literally star shaped plane painted half blue and half yellow), a sonic jet and a star-boat. The only significant omission from Dhruva's fleet of transport vehicles is a car which he has never owned. Star-blade, star-line and motorbike are so significant to the character's identity that often, even before Dhruva himself breaks into a crime scene, a flurry of star-blades, a star-line or the sound of Dhruva's special bike announce the arrival of Dhruva. Utility belt Dhruva's utility belt is one of the most significant and defining characteristic of the character's appearance as well the character's most useful and important tool in his crime fighting sojourn. Dhruva's belt has evolved over the years from a simple leather belt to a leather utility belt with pouches to a metallic utility belt. In its current version, Dhruva's utility belt is a metallic belt with inbuilt locking system to make sure that no one can easily pull it off or cut it as against his older leather belt. The star shaped buckle has an inbuilt transmitter which enables Dhruva to stay in contact with commando headquarters, police force and even some of his allies including Chandika. Dhruva is known to carry a lot of utility items in his belt pockets. The various items that he has been shown to carry in his utility belt at various times include, but are not limited to, spare cartridges for star-blades and star-lines, acid capsules, signal flares, star cuffs (star shaped handcuffs), a make-up kit and many more items. Dhruva also carries a special transmitter fixed at 'Brahmand Rakshak' frequency which enables him to stay in contact with the Brahmand Rakshak headquarters as well as the other members of Brahmand Rakshak team. On some occasions he has been shown to carry a separate Brahmand Rakshak transmitter while on the other occasions it has been shown to be integrated with Dhruva's personal star-transmitter. Dhruva also carries a radiation sensor which is either fitted in his collar button or sometimes in his belt and blinks whenever there is threat of hazardous level of radiation exposure. =Commando headquarters= Commando headquarters is the base of Commando Force located in Rajnagar. It is the place from where Commando Force operates. It is equipped with state of the art technology and computer system. Its system can perform various functions that include, but are not limited to, facial recognition, finger print matching, DNA matching, remote hacking of enemy's system and global surveillance through satellite imaging. Commando headquarters' system also keeps the data on every criminal, can access police records as well Interpol files on request. Teenagers residing in various cities of India receive special training at the headquarters from the Commando Force and then sent back to their respective homes. These trained junior cadets have special protocol to report any ongoing crime to commando headquarters and not getting involved themselves unless they are sure they can handle it. Dhruva has got surveillance cameras installed all over Rajnagar streets which are monitored at the headquarters for suspicious activities. Information on any suspicious activity caught by cameras or junior cadets, if requiring Dhruva's attention, is channelled to Dhruva on his star- transmitter. Dhruva himself patrols the city streets every night on his special motorbike. Dhruva's unyielding dedication towards keeping his city safe has earned him the title of 'Rajnagar Ka Rakhwala' (Keeper of Rajnagar). Supporting characters Dhruva's allies clockwise from top left- Samri, Dhananjay, Kirigi and Jingaloo Dhruva has a large range of supporting characters who have played significant roles in his story arcs. While some help to define the character of Super Commando Dhruva itself, other have played significant roles in giving a direction to the story arcs that they have been part of. After the death of Dhruva' parents, I. G. Rajan Mehra adopted him. I. G. Rajan has been a constant presence in Dhruva titles and has been very useful not only as the chief of police but also as a father-figure and a constant source of inspiration. When a supervillain Alchemist almost forced Dhruva into retirement by endangering his family's life by targeting Rajan Mehra and Dhruva's sister Shweta, it was Dhruva's father who motivated him to keep going. Dhruva's Commando Force, a team of three trained cadets (Peter Massy, Karim Shah and Renu) has been another important support for him in his fight. Dhananjay, the descendant of Gods, is Dhruva's most powerful ally and a good friend who not only provided him with the power to breathe inside water but is also ready to help whenever Dhruva needs him and vice versa. But amongst a long list of supporting characters in Dhruva series, the most important character has been Shweta, Dhruva's sister. She has been the strongest pillar of support in Dhruva's constant battle against evil on many levels. As a little sister, she engages with Dhruva in funny sibling banter, cheers him up and makes sure he never feels sad or misses his biological family. As a budding scientist, she constantly provides Dhruva with innovative gadgets that prove very helpful to Dhruva during his fights. But the highest level of support she provides is in the form of Chandika, a blonde super heroine, her alter ego. Chandika has inherited her brother's fighting style. Like Dhruva, she too depends on brains more than brawn as well as on her self- invented gadgets. She is always there to help Dhruva whenever he is in danger. Dhruva who is very protective about her sister, under strong suspicion that Shweta is in fact Chandika, often reprimands her for putting her life in danger. But Shweta somehow manages to come out clean every time proving that she is not Chandika. Natasha is the only person who knows Chandika's true identity. Shweta eventually went to London in 2007 Makadjaal series to pursue her further studies. In Nagayana, when Shweta was presumably dead, although later revived, Natasha kept Chandika alive by donning her costume. Dhruva has had quite a few love interests that include Natasha, Richa and Sabby. Natasha is Dhruva's arch enemy Grand Master Robo's daughter. While Natasha and Dhruva's love is mutual, Richa and Sabby's love is more one sided. Sabby is the daughter of another terrorist Abbu Salem. She never reappeared since her first appearance in 'Sarvanash'. On the other hand, Richa has been an integral part of Dhruva's storyline ever since her first appearance. As Richa, she has been Dhruva's best friend and as her alter ego Black Cat, a lethal superheroine with killer instincts, though initially rogue who later turned to the good side, she has been a partner and helper in many of Dhruva's fights. More so since Chandika (Shweta) has gone out of India to pursue her studies. In alternate universe shown in Nagayana series, Natasha has been revealed to be the lawfully wedded wife of Dhruva. Both have a conceived a kid out of their marriage as well. Richa too bears Dhruva's child though as she pointed out, Dhruva never cheated on Natasha as his and Richa's baby was borne out of IVF technique. Other significant supporting characters in Dhruva series include Jingalu, a yeti; Kirigi, a ninja fighter with yogic powers; Lori, a tantric; Vanputra who has the ability to communicate with plants and trees in contrast to Dhruva who communicates with animals; Barf-manava, possessing the power of ice; Saamri, the keeper of Jwalok, a secret city located inside a volcano; Vera Vicet, a French police officer who initially tried to kill Dhruva under the impression that Shyam, Dhruva's biological father, had killed her father but eventually realised the truth and became his ally and Nakshatra, a mirror image of Dhruva who, like Dhruva, was born and brought up in a circus and has pretty much the same abilities that Dhruva has. As opposed to Vera, Nakshatra tried to kill Dhruva's father I. G. Rajan believing that Rajan had murdered his father in a fake encounter but upon realising the truth, he surrendered to the police and when he came out after serving his jail sentence, he eventually became Dhruva's friend. In Nagayana, Nakshatra has been shown to be Shweta's love interest. Dhruva has been a member of superhero team Brahmand Rakshak. Dhruva has often teamed up with other superheroes, most frequently with Nagraj and occasionally with Doga. While Nagraj and Dhruva have grown to become thick of friends over the years, Dhruva-Doga relationship is a bit more tense because of differing moral codes and sense of justice of the two heroes. =Enemies= Grand Master Robo, Dhruva's arch enemy Dhruva has his own rogues gallery filled with an assortment of villains that includes common criminals without any superpowers, supervillains, devils and even extraterrestrial beings. Dhruva's biggest arch enemy and the most recurring villain in his titles is Grand Master Robo, a crime lord. Half human, half robot, Robo has a laser eye fit inside his left eyeball. Over the years Robo and Dhruva have developed a strange bond of hatred and respect. While Dhruva wants to arrest Robo, and Robo wants to kill Dhruva who always foils his plans, they also acknowledge the fact that if any of them hurts the other, it would eventually hurt Natasha, Robo's daughter and Dhruva's love interest. Other arch foes of Dhruva include Chandakaal, the last remaining demon on earth; Mahamanav, a highly evolved version of Homo sapiens with psychic superpowers; Dhawaniraj, a mad scientist whose power is lethal forms of sound waves; Dr. Virus, a biologist; Bauna Waman, a midget who uses toys as his weapons and Chumba, who possesses the power of magnetism. Dhruva has always believed in giving criminals a chance to redeem themselves. Natasha, Nakshatra, Nostredamas and Black Cat are classic examples of rogues turning good by Dhruva effect. Robo himself had a near change of heart but Natasha who had gone rogue because of rampaging corruption in the system, prevented him from surrendering. In 'Vinash', Dhruva convinced his foes to work with him as a team to protect earth from a far greater danger. Dhruva has even fought against his best friend Nagraj when he went rogue. Over the years Dhruva has come to gain the respect of his enemies as well especially the ones with great superpowers like Chandakaal and Mahamanav. In 'Jaljala', when Mahamanav sets out to kill every superhero, while he sent out his pawns to kill other heroes, he decided to kill Dhruva with his own hands considering him a prized cache. In 'Soorma', Dr. Virus who takes on Nagraj and Parmanu states that he had to shift his base from Rajnagar to Delhi for the fear of Dhruva. Chumba himself mentioned once that Dhruva scares him in his dreams. One common thing Dhruva's villains have acknowledged on separate occasions is that Dhruva is probably the most dangerous superhero because unlike most other heroes who depend on their superpowers, he doesn't possess any weakness to exploit and they cannot anticipate what plan Dhruva's mind can come up with. Cultural impact=Merchandising= In the early part of the 1990s, Raj comics was very popular. They tried to encash their characters' popularity by a series of merchandising. These merchandise included stickers, magnet stickers, tattoos, posters, trading cards, wallets, T-shirts, dinner plates, jigsaw puzzles, face masks and stationery items themed on their superhero characters including Dhruva under a common trade name 'Nagraj Novelties'. The merchandise did not become very popular and eventually went out of production because of various reasons including lack of marketing, not licensing their characters to other more established merchandising companies and instead keeping the rights to themselves and not making these merchandise widely available in the open market all over India through distributorship. Many years later, around 2010, with the advent of online shopping and payment options, Raj comics again tried to venture into the merchandising business which primarily included posters, calendars and T-shirts. =Critical reception and popularity= Super Commando Dhruva became a very popular character soon after his introduction in Indian comics. Apart from being popular among kids, even girls (owing to his smart looks), Dhruva also received positive reviews from parents for having a strong moral code, educative science/detective-based themes and having minimal violence. Dhruva went on to become one of the most loved character in Indian comics as evident by unofficial online polls on various fan sites. The character's fans fondly address him as Captain and call themselves his cadets. Anupam Sinha mentioned on his Facebook wall in Feb 2012 referencing to Dhruva's popularity and his debut title, \\"the first book of my most successful character yet, which I made 25 years ago is still in print and sells! Thank you God for everything!\\" In 2013, Raj comics published a list of Top 20 best sellers titles on their official Facebook page based on the sales figures on their own online store and Flipkart. While 6 of them were Dhruva's solo titles, the remaining 14 were multi-hero/crossover titles featuring Dhruva as one of the leading character, thereby making him the most popular Raj comic superhero. Although hugely popular in Hindi speaking states of India and the Indians living abroad, the character hardly got any recognition internationally as well as in non-Hindi- speaking regions of South India. In 2009, for the first time Raj Comics opened stores in Karnataka, one of the non-Hindi speaking states of South India, giving them a taste of Indian Hindi comics. Dhruva has also slowly made his presence felt in the international arena as well. In August 2011, The Boston Globe ran a feature on non-American comic book superheroes. They analysed comic book superheroes belonging to seven different nationalities which included Captain Canuck of Canada, Eden Fesi of Australia, Super Inframan of China, Zooman: El Hombre Mosca - a Mexican superhero, Superboy - a French superhero, Jabbar-The Powerful of Saudi Arab and Dhruva representing Indian comics. Not only did the character receive positive reviews from the columnist, but he also rated Dhruva the highest among the seven heroes awarding him a rating of 8 out of 10. Spanish writer Chris Wright summed up the review for Dhruva - \\"It's hard to find fault with Super Commando Dhruva - he is completely nuts in the best possible way.\\".

In US law, these rights belong to the holder of the copyright, who may sell (or \\"option\\") them to someone in the film industry‚Äîusually a producer or director, or sometimes a specialist broker of such properties‚Äîwho will then try to gather industry professionals and secure the financial backing necessary to convert the property into a film. Such rights differ from the right to commercially exhibit a finished motion picture, which rights are usually referred to as \\"exhibition rights\\" or \\"public-performance rights\\". Origins In the United States, the need to secure film rights of previously published or produced source materials still under copyright stems from case law. In 1907, the Kalem Company produced a one-reel silent film version of General Lew Wallace's novel Ben-Hur without first securing film rights. Wallace's estate and his American publisher, Harper & Brothers sued for copyright infringement. The United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, establishing the precedent that all adaptations are subject to copyright.  Options  When producers option a script, they are purchasing the right to buy certain rights to intellectual property. A general option fee is 10% of the cost of the rights, should the producers manage to secure full financing for their project and have it \\"greenlit\\". Because few projects actually manage to be greenlit, options allow producers to reduce their loss in the event that a project fails to come to fruition. Should the project be greenlit, an option provides a legally binding guarantee to purchase the film rights. The contract for an option will specify the length of time it is valid for. If the producer is unable to have their project greenlit within the specified timeframe (e.g. two years), the option will expire. The rights holder can then put the previously optioned rights up for sale again. Or, the contract may allow the producer to renew the option for a certain price.  Chain of title  As it is common for scripts to be stuck in development hell, the options for a script may expire and be resold on multiple occasions. As well, producers who purchase an option and rework the script own the rights to their own derivative work- while the original rights holder owns the underlying rights. This lineage is referred to as the chain of title. This lineage can become cloudy if the underlying rights are divided. Producers may purchase the rights to a specific region (i.e. a country, the entire world, or the universe) and/or they may purchase ancillary rights such as merchandising rights. In some cases, it may be uncertain as to the exact owners of a particular version of a script and to the exact set of rights. It is important for an entertainment lawyer to determine how 'clean' a chain of title is.

S. Johnson. As is typical of Johnson's work the novel is written in an unorthodox style. Plot summary The novel is set in a nursing home. It follows part of a typical day for a group of elderly people, both male and female. Their thoughts, memories and opinions of each other and the House Mother (head matron) are explored as they go about their activities, from playing pass-the-parcel to dancing. Style Each character in the book has their own section. Each of these sections starts at the same point in the day, and likewise each section ends at the same point at the end of the day. Therefore, the reader is given insight into each character's unique interpretation of the same string of events. This method of writing allows for the characters' actions and conversations to mingle and intertwine. Johnson provides each character with a mixture of dialogue and interior monologue to express their personalities during the course of their section. At the beginning of each character's section is an explanatory table, providing us with information on the character, including age, condition and mental faculty. As the reader progresses through the sections each character is increasingly older and/or more senile than the characters in the preceding sections. Finally we get the House Mother's section, and we learn her opinions of those in her care. Johnson frequently uses humour in this novel, though it is at times written with a serious tone.

A skeptical turn along these lines is Cartesian skepticism. # Methodological solipsism is the thesis that the mental properties or mental states of an organism can be individuated exclusively on the basis of that state or property's relations with other internal states of the organism itself, without any reference to the society or the physical world in which the organism is embedded. The second definition was promoted by Jerry Fodor (1980). He later went on to distinguish this thesis from another that he called methodological individualism. Fodor's motivation for introducing these concepts into the philosophical (and now psychological) lexicon was the need to defend some sort of internalist conception of the mental from the problems posed by the famous \\"Twin Earth\\" thought experiment of Hilary Putnam. Very briefly, the question is whether it is possible for two people, one living in the actual world where water is H2O and the other living in some possible world (Twin Earth) where water has all the same qualities of our water but is actually composed of XYZ, to have the same beliefs (or other propositional attitudes) about water. The externalist says that this is not possible, while the internalist insists that it is. Fodor defines methodological solipsism as the extreme position that states that the content of someone's beliefs about, say, water has absolutely nothing to do with the substance water in the outside world, nor with the commonly accepted definition of the society in which that person lives. Everything is determined internally. Moreover, the only thing that other people have to go on in ascribing beliefs to someone else are the internal states of his or her physical brain. In contrast, Fodor defines methodological individualism as the view that mental states have a semantically evaluable character‚Äîthat is, they are relational states. The relation that provides semantic meaning can be a relation with the external world or with one's culture and, so long as the relation produces some change in the causal power of a mental state, it can be considered to be a partial determinant of that state.

The type strain of T. delbrueckii is CBS 1146T, equivalent to CLIB 230 or ATCC 10662, etc.. The type strain of T. delbrueckii CBS 1146 T was recently sequenced, and is composed of 8 chromosomes in addition to a mitochondrial genome. Torulaspora delbrueckii was formerly known as Saccharomyces delbrueckii or Saccharomyces rosei or Saccharomyces roseus, and the anamorph is called Candida colliculosa (for a complete list of synonyms, see CBS's website). Torulaspora delbrueckii is the most studied species of the genus Torulaspora that comprises 8 species to date, including T. franciscae, T. pretoriensis, T. microellipsoides, T. globosa, T. indica, T. maleeae, and T. quercuum. The taxonomy of the genus Torulaspora is evolving rapidly, and the availability of molecular tools to discriminate Torulaspora species will help correcting errors in species assignments.Spores of Torulaspora delbrueckii Habitats Torulaspora delbrueckii is isolated from several human bioprocesses, including the bread industry where some T. delbrueckii strains are commercialized for frozen dough applications. Other applications include food fermentations of silage, cocoa, olive or cucumber; distilled and traditional fermented beverage production including mescal, colonche, tequila, cider, strawberry tree fruits juice, sugarcane juice or kefir; dairy products‚Äô fermentations like traditional cheeses and fermented milk. Torulaspora delbrueckii can be an opportunistic spoilage yeast for dairy products or soft drinks (fruit juices, etc.). Torulaspora delbrueckii colonizes several natural environments, ranging from soils, to plants, fruits and insects. T.delbrueckii is occasionally found as a clinical isolate, although not considered to be a human pathogen, a state described as opportunistic pathogen. Winemaking Torulaspora delbrueckii has been associated with winemaking for decades and isolated either from grape, must or wine. Torulaspora delbrueckii is now proposed as starter culture (to be associated with S. cerevisiae in mixed cultures) for certain applications, particularly to reduce volatile acidity in high-sugar fermentations like in Sauternes wines. Recent findings show that T. delbrueckii species has been domesticated for winemaking and other human uses about 1900 and 4000 years ago respectively. Life-cycle The life-cycle of T. delbrueckii remains unclear. Some authors consider T. delbrueckii to be a haploid species, while more recent findings suggest T. delbrueckii have a mostly diploid homothallic life. To date, the life-cycle of the species is not formally elucidated.

The station is on the Cambrian Coast Railway with passenger services to Harlech, Porthmadog, Porthmadog, Tywyn, Aberdovey, Machynlleth and Shrewsbury. Between Morfa Mawddach and Barmouth the railway crosses the Afon Mawddach on the Barmouth Bridge. History The station (opened in 1867) originally extended further south, with a platform for trains to Dolgellau and Ruabon on the south side of the level crossing. This platform became disused following the closure of the Dolgellau line in 1965, but remained in situ with its waiting room until the early 1990s. It was demolished to make way for a bus stop and car park. The goods yard was redeveloped around the same time by Co- operative Retail Services and, as at Tywyn and Pwllheli, is now occupied by a supermarket. Until the 1960s there was a summer service between London Paddington and Pwllheli, via Birmingham Snow Hill, Shrewsbury and Machynlleth. The station signal box, also on the south side of the level crossing, became disused in the 1980s as the Cambrian Line's traditional signalling system was replaced with radio signalling (RETB). After lying derelict for several years, it was moved to on the preserved Llangollen Railway. Facilities The station as seen from the level crossing (September 2018) The southbound platform was improved in 2003 and is now home to Barmouth's tourist information centre. The station is unstaffed, but the tourist information centre provides a travel information service. The building also houses a small museum devoted to the history of Barmouth. Services Trains operate every two hours in each direction, southbound to , & and northbound to (a limited number also originate or terminate here). On Sundays, there is a single service each way all year, with extra trains in the summer. All services at Barmouth are provided by Transport for Wales using its Class 158 DMUs. From 3 January 2014, train services were suspended due to major infrastructure damage at several locations along the line caused by storm-force winds and the resultant tidal surges. Part of the sea wall to the north near was swept away, leading to severe damage to the formation which closed the line for 5 months, whilst further south a section of embankment at Tonfannau was washed out. Network Rail restored service to Barmouth from the south on 10 February 2014, and the line as far north as Harlech in May the same year.\\"Section of Cambrian Coast line damaged by ferocious storms to reopen in May ahead of schedule\\"Wales Online article 21 March 2014; Retrieved 12 October 2016 The northern end of the route beyond remained closed until 1 September 2014 due to the reconstruction of the Pont Briwet viaduct.

Though his name was Masahisa, he is known by his \\"common\\" name of Matabei. While his income (a stipend of 59 koku) may not have been particularly high, his voice was certainly one closest to the ear of the daimy≈ç. Though he was born into the unstipended Kitamura clan (the clan messengers/couriers), he was adopted by Kijima Masatsune, the head of another Ch≈çsh≈´ retainer family.

He studied swordsmanship and spearmanship with ≈åishi Susumu of the Yanagawa domain, horsemanship with the Hagi-based Narasaki Shir≈çbei, as well as training in Edo at the d≈çj≈ç of Kubota Sukeshir≈ç. Following the Ikedaya Incident (July 1864), where the Aizu domain-sponsored Shinsengumi attacked and defeated around 20 (mostly) Ch≈çsh≈´ samurai who were plotting to burn Kyoto to the ground, Kijima was one of those along with senior Ch≈çsh≈´ retainer Kokuji Shinano who led the advance of Ch≈çsh≈´ forces to Kyoto in retaliation.

In August 2012, Natalie receives an envelope from Todd Manning in Port Charles, New York, which contained a picture of John kissing Sam Morgan on the Fourth of July (John had been drinking). John arrives at his and Natalie's home and finds that Natalie is not there. John calls Natalie, trying to explain what happened, but Natalie angrily informs him that London is her home. John becomes upset, saying Natalie can't take Liam and leave the country. He searches for his passport and finds that Natalie has taken it, preventing him from following her to London, England. John discovers the envelope from Port Charles and realizes Todd sent Natalie the photo and heads to Port Charles to beat Todd for which he is arrested when Todd files charges. Weeks later, John receives a notice informing him that Natalie allegedly filed a restraining order against him, blocking him from herself and Liam. In October 2012, John receives a break up letter, allegedly from Natalie. During the 2013 revival, Natalie is now a single mother raising her son Liam all by herself in her own apartment in Llanview. Natalie leaves Liam with the nanny to attend the opening of Blair's new nightclub Shelter. Cutter Wentworth flirts with her, and Natalie, lonely for attention, is flattered. They share a dance and she leaves shortly after. Missing John, she curls up on the couch sadly. As Natalie is putting in long hours, she falls asleep in her office. Nora suggests to Natalie they go shopping together so that Natalie can shake the blues. After Nora leaves, Clint stops by to suggest to her that she and Liam should both move back to Llanfair, but Natalie says no, and that she and Liam are both fine living in their apartment. Several weeks later Natalie comes back to Shelter and meets up with Cutter, who offers a drink that was named after him from a bartender (who he casually has sex with) named Nikki (Jenni \\"JWoww\\" Farley). She, along with Blair and Rama, are entertained and impressed by a singer that Cutter auditions at the club named Dusky (Jessie Malakouti), who Blair immediately hires. The next day, Natalie runs a lab test to test from the liquor holder that Bo found from Todd's hotel room after Todd claimed that he was poisoned by his twin brother Victor Jr. (who returned to town after he was presumed dead after being shot by Todd, but was really kidnapped and had his death faked by Allison). At first, Natalie found no proof of any poisonous substance, but she later called Bo to tell him that she checked the tests again, and found arsenic in the liquor holder, confirming Todd's suspicions that Victor Jr. poisoned him after all. Later, Natalie finds a mysterious tattoo that was found from a dead body outside in the river, Tea recognizes that Victor Jr. has the same tattoo on his arm. After a DNA test on the dead body, Natalie came to Tea's house saying that the DNA found on the dead body matched Victor Jr., meaning that he killed the person found outside in the river. Natalie also strikes up a friendship Destiny Evans at Shelter. Natalie is shocked to receive a call from John; who she has not heard from for some time. She visits her mother, Viki, and admits that she still loves John and always Will. Viki urges Natalie to call him but Natalie decides to ignore the call and go to Shutter and hang out. A few days later, she is served with legal papers and is shocked to see that John has filed a suit for visitation with his son Liam. She calls Tea, who quickly meets her and looks over the petition. After reading it, she informs Natalie that John is doing this because she won't let him see Liam. Natalie denies this and says that John left her and that she'd never keep him from his son. Tea promises to get to the bottom of it. Meanwhile, Natalie has dinner with her parents and has filled them in and then receives a call from Tea. Tea informs her that John received a restraining order allegedly from her and a \\"Dear John\\" letter. Natalie is shocked to learn this and had no idea that John had been staying away because of a legal injunction and not necessarily for another woman. The next morning, Natalie storms into Llanfair and tells her parents that she has been calling John to straighten the matter out but was unable to reach him as he is on an assignment with the FBI. Clint is happy that she did not reach him and Natalie tells him that all of her issues with John cannot be resolved. She is upset that John believes that she blocked him from their son and broke up with him via a letter. She suspects that Clint was behind and confronts him and he confesses. He tells her that he did it to protect her but she says it was control and blasts him for coming in between her and John. She tells him that they had a chance to get past what happened with Sam but his interference took away their choices and that she'd never forgive him. Clint visits Natalie and she forgives him anyway. She starts a casual but exclusive relationship with Cutter but ends it when she learns that he had been sleeping with Nikki for months. As Natalie dealt with the admission, her father made a drunken scene at the gala and was taken to the hospital. When Natalie went to visit Clint, she found Allison Perkins standing over him with a syringe. Reception In 2003, Archer won \\"Outstanding Newcomer\\" at the Soap Opera Digest Awards. She was later awarded \\"Favorite Triangle\\" storyline at the 2005 ceremony. In April 2010, a reporter for Soapnet praised Archer's portrayal of Natalie. They said she made a \\"brilliant scene\\" in which Natalie launches into a tirade of abuse aimed at Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell), following her interference with her romantic relationship with John McBain (Michael Easton). The reporter empathised with Natalie because people often say \\"awful\\" things they will regret; but in their opinion, \\"Melissa brought it home\\".

Neale is currently Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Linguistics and holder of the John H. Kornblith Family Chair in the Philosophy of Science and Values at the Graduate Center, City University of New York (CUNY). Education and career Neale completed his B. Phil in Linguistics at University College London working with linguist Deirdre Wilson. He completed his PhD in Philosophy at Stanford University with philosopher John Perry as his dissertation advisor. Prior to joining the CUNY faculty, Neale held positions at Princeton University, University of California, Berkeley, and Rutgers University. He is one of the world's leading authorities on Bertrand Russell's Theory of Descriptions, on the philosophies of Paul Grice and Donald Davidson, and on the intricacies of formal arguments in logic known as slingshots. His best known writings are the books Descriptions (1990) and Facing Facts (2001), and the articles \\"Meaning, Grammar, and Indeterminacy\\" (1987), \\"Paul Grice and the Philosophy of Language\\" (1992), \\"Term limits\\" (1993), \\"No Plagiarism Here!\\" (2001). Philosophers of language who have written their PhD dissertations under Neale's supervision include Pierre Baumann (University of Puerto Rico), Herman Cappelen (University of Oslo), Josh Dever (University of Texas, Austin), Eli Dresner (Tel Aviv University), Brian Robinson (Texas A%26M University‚ÄìKingsville), Daniel Harris (CUNY), Angel Pinillos (Arizona State University), and Elmar Unnsteinsson (University College Dublin). Philosophical work Neale's writings are primarily in the philosophy of language, construed broadly enough to intersect with generative linguistics, the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, philosophical logic, and formal logic. A realist (rather than a pragmatist) position on truth runs through his work, although he appears to be agnostic about the explanatory value of appeals to individual facts in philosophical talk about truth. Traditional accounts of interpretation are marred, Neale claims, by (1) a failure to engage correctly with the epistemic asymmetry of the situations in which producers and consumers of language find themselves; (2) a consequent failure to distinguish adequately the metaphysical question of what determines what a speaker (or writer) means on a given occasion from the epistemological question of how that particular meaning is identified; (3) a failure to appreciate the severity of constraints on the formation of linguistic intentions; (4) failures to appreciate pervasive forms of underdeterminaton (such as those examined by pragmatists and relevance theorists); (5) failures to recognise that genuine indeterminacy of the sort associated with what speakers (and writers) imply incomplete descriptions,Descriptions MIT Press, 1993. (Originally published 1990.) This, That, and the Other. In Descriptions and Beyond. Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 68‚Äì182.\\"A Century Later\\". 2005. and on a slingshot argument originally used by Kurt G√∂del.Facing Facts Oxford University Press, 2002. (Originally published 2001.) Neale is an intentionalist and a pragmatist about the interpretation of speech and writing, and to this extent his work is rooted firmly in the Gricean tradition. While probably a Quinean in his attitude towards indeterminacy in the realm of meaning, Neale is a Chomskyan and a Fodorian in his stance on what they say (for example, when they use incomplete definite descriptions); (6) inappropriate reliance on formal notions of context deriving from indexical logics, (7) unwarranted faith in transcendent notions of \\"what is said\\", \\"what is implied\\" and \\"what is referred to\\"; and metaphysics, theory of legal interpretation, and literary theory. Philosophical problems about interpretation, context, information content, structure, and representation form the nexus of Neale's work. He has vigorously defended Russell's Theory of Descriptions, descriptive theories of anaphora, Paul Grice's intention-based theory of meaning, and a general approach to meaning and interpretation he calls \\"linguistic pragmatism\\". His most influential work to date has been on the underdetermination and indeterminacy associated with uses of so-called attitude towards syntax and mental representation. Aspects of syntactic theory (8) a quite general overestimation of the role traditional compositional semantics can play in explanations of how humans use language to represent the world and communicate.Linguistic Pragmatism. Oxford University Press. Forthcoming Neale also wrote an influential defense of Saul Kripke in the Times Literary Supplement against charges that Kripke's new theory of reference had plagiarized work by Ruth Barcan Marcus.https://www.academia.edu/6546412/Neale_Kripke Publications=Books= * Descriptions MIT Press, 1993.

A portion of the canal is used for public transport by an express boat service in Bangkok. The 72 km long canal passes through 21 districts and is connected to more than 100 smaller canals. History Bridge \\"Saphan Chaloem La 56\\" at Phaya Thai Road over Khlong Saen Saep, built in 1908 by King Chulalongkorn. The Saen Saep Canal was built on the order of King Rama III during a conflict between Siam and Annam over Cambodia in order to establish water transport for soldiers and weapons. Construction began in 1837 and cost 96,000 Baht. Construction was finished in three years. Klong Saen Saep was once filled with lotus plants. King Mongkut in his fourth reign (1851-1868) built Sa Pathum Palace (Lotus Pond Palace) in Siam District. The name of the palace and present-day Pathum Wan District are derived from it. The Saen Saep starts from Maha Nak Canal (Khlong Maha Nak) () around Mahakan Fort in Bangkok. In Chachoengsao Province it ends in the Bang Pakong River. Environmental The Saen Saep Canal is one of Bangkok's major drainage arteries. It is also heavily polluted. In 2015, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha initiated a two-year effort to clean up the canal in 2017-2018. A survey by the Pollution Control Department (PCD) inspected 631 buildings and residences beside the canal, concluding that there were 412 sources of pollution, including 62 hospitals, 107 restaurants, 14 markets, 66 hotels, 144 condominiums, 81 department stores, and 157 homes. Between October 2015 and January 2017, the department inspected 210 of the potential polluters and found that 40 percent of hotels, 23 percent of hospitals, 20 percent of department stores, and 50 percent of condominiums discharged waste water into the canal in contravention of existing laws. The department charged the 49 worst offenders with illegally discharging wastewater into a public watercourse. Those charged must pay a 2,000 baht daily fine until they fix waste management problems and halt illegal discharges. The remaining 363 establishments were ordered to improve wastewater treatment standards. The PCD refused to reveal the identity of the polluters. To maintain the cleanliness of the canal Natural Resources and Environment Minister General Surasak Kanjanarat proposed charging waste water treatment fees to households and tourists. \\"If we do nothing, all rivers and canals in the next 20 years will be completely ruined. And if you are not ready to pay now, you might have to pay more in the future.\\", he said. The PCD recommended that the charge should be 0.43 baht per cubic metre. This would bring in 5.3 billion baht per year. Plans have been made to charge each tourist 50 baht for waste water treatment which will bring in an additional 1.5 billion baht of revenue each year, assuming 29.9 million tourists, the number who visited in 2016. The PCD intends to study wastewater treatment in an additional 21 districts with sub-canals linked to the Saen Saep Canal. In June 2019, the PCD reported that the water quality of the canal has improved due to its efforts. No BOD figures were reported to corroborate this claim. PCD's latest survey of discharges into the canal identified 720 pollution sources along the canal's length. At least 253 of these sources face fines of 2,000 baht per day until the wastewater is treated properly before being discharged. Transport An express boat service operates on the Saen Saep between Pom Prap Sattru Phai and Bang Kapi Districts, providing ferry service in traffic-congested central Bangkok. The service has a checkered reputation, due to the polluted water in the khlong and the slapdash nature of the service. The northern line ends at Golden Mount, and the southern line ends at NIDA. Boats go past Watthana and Huai Khwang Districts, running parallel to Petchaburi Road.

Because of its overwhelming incidence on the gingiva, the condition is associated with two other diseases, pyogenic granuloma and peripheral ossifying fibroma. These three diseases are associated because they appear frequently on gingiva. Due to its similar microscopic appearance, peripheral giant-cell granuloma is considered to be the soft tissue equivalent of central giant-cell granuloma. The appearance of peripheral giant-cell granuloma is also similar to pyogenic granuloma. The color ranges from red to bluish- purple, but is usually more blue in comparison to pyogenic granuloma. It can be sessile or pedunculated with the size usually being less than 2 cm. The lesion has a 60% gender predilection to females. The prevalence of the peripheral giant-cell granuloma is highest around 50 - 60 years of age. It appears only on the gingiva or on an edentulous alveolar ridge. It is more often found in the mandible rather than the maxilla, in either anterior or posterior areas. The underlying alveolar bone can be destroyed, leaving a unique appearance referred to as \\"cupping resorption\\" or \\"saucerization\\". Diagnosis Peripheral giant-cell granuloma appears microscopically as a large number of multinucleated giant cells, which can have up to dozens of nuclei. Additionally, there are mesenchymal cells that are ovoid and spindle- shaped. Near the borders of the lesion, deposits of hemosiderin and hemorrhage is often found. In 50% of cases, ulcerations are present. Treatment Treatment usually involves surgical removal of the lesion down to the bone. If there are any adjacent teeth, they are cleaned thoroughly by scaling and root planing (SRP) to remove any possible source of irritation. Recurrence is around 10%.

Guido Bonatti (died between 1296 and 1300) was an Italian mathematician, astronomer and astrologer, who was the most celebrated astrologer of the 13th century. Bonatti was advisor of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, Ezzelino da Romano III, Guido Novello da Polenta and Guido I da Montefeltro. He also served the communal governments of Florence, Siena and Forl√¨. His employers were all Ghibellines (supporters of the Holy Roman Emperor), who were in conflict with the Guelphs (supporters of the Pope), and all were excommunicated at some time or another. Bonatti's astrological reputation was also criticised in Dante's Divine Comedy, where he is depicted as residing in hell as punishment for his astrology. His most famous work was his Liber Astronomiae or 'Book of Astronomy', written around 1277. This remained a classic astrology textbook for two centuries.Campion, Nicholas. An Introduction to the History of Astrology. ISCWA, 1982. p. 46. Biography Bonatti's dates of birth and death are unknown, the latter probably occurring between 1296 and 1300. In 1233 he is known as the winner of a dispute in Bologna with the friar Giovanni Schio from Vicenza, who maintained the non-scientific basis of astrology. He is probably the first astrologer to have used the midpoints in astrology. He used it to refine the timing for the military campaigns for the Count of MontefeltroMichael Harding and Charles Harvey: Working with Astrology: The Psychology of Harmonics, Midpoints and AstroCartoGraphy, Penguin Group, London. Bonati announced to the count that he would repulse the enemy but would be wounded in the fray. The event transpired as Bonati had predicted, and the count, who had taken with him the necessary materials to staunch his wound in case the prophecy came true, became a devout adherent of astrology.Guido Bonati: Information and Much More from Answers.com There is a tradition that Bonatti, towards the end of his life, took the friar's habit of the Franciscan Order. This has been contested, as Bonatti expressed great disdain for Franciscans in his early period. However, the Franciscan Order, in the 1924 inaugural issue of its annual publication, Franciscan Studies, lays claim to Fra Guido Bonatti: According to the uncorroborated account of the Italian historian Ludovico Antonio Muratori, Bonatti was murdered by robbers whilst returning from a study trip to Paris and other Italian cities, being set upon in or near Casena, with his body left upon the road. Evidence from various accounts establishes that Bonatti was in his eighties when he died.

Signed to Curb Records in 1996, he charted his first single on the Billboard country chart in 1997, but did not release an album until 2003's Honesty, which included the number 4 hit \\"Honesty (Write Me a List)\\". If You're Going Through Hell, his second album, was released in 2006. Its first two singles, \\"If You're Going Through Hell (Before the Devil Even Knows)\\" and \\"Watching You\\", each spent four weeks at the top of the country music chart, and were respectively ranked as the top country songs of 2006 and 2007 according to Billboard Year-End. The album, which has since been certified platinum in the United States, produced two more number 1 singles in \\"These Are My People\\" and \\"Cleaning This Gun (Come On In Boy)\\". It's America (2009) included the number 1 single \\"It's America\\" and the top 5 hit \\"Farmer's Daughter\\", which was added to a later reissue of the album. Take a Back Road (2011) produced his sixth number 1 in its title track, and 2019's Caught Up in the Country set a record for the longest run on the country singles charts with its title track. Atkins has received six nominations from the Academy of Country Music and two from the Country Music Association, winning Top New Male Vocalist from the former in 2006. Early life Rodney Atkins was born in Knoxville, Tennessee. His biological mother, who was 19 at the time, became pregnant with him after a \\"traumatic first date\\". She hid the pregnancy from her parents and put him up for adoption at the Holston United Methodist Home for Children in Greeneville, Tennessee. His first adoptive parents, Charles Hutchins and Linda Weems, returned him to the home after he developed a major respiratory infection. Allan and Margaret Atkins, who had lost a newborn about a year prior, inquired after the child, but decided not to proceed due to surgery that Margaret had just undergone. Meanwhile, another couple adopted him, but also returned him soon after when he developed colic. After Margaret Atkins recovered, she proceeded to adopt him. Atkins did not meet his biological mother until 2008, and has never revealed her identity. The Atkins family moved frequently in his youth, eventually settling in Claiborne County, Tennessee. He attended high school at Powell Valley High in Speedwell, Tennessee. During high school, Atkins played guitar in his spare time at events and festivals. After graduating from Walters State Community College, he went to Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, Tennessee, where he made friends with songwriters and soon began writing himself. In the mid-1990s, Atkins moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a recording career. He signed with Curb Records in 1996, the same week that LeAnn Rimes did. Musical career=Rodney Atkins= Atkins's debut single, \\"In a Heartbeat\\", spent one week at number 74 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart dated for August 30, 1997. One of the song's cowriters was Brian Gowan, who was also recording on Curb at the time as one-half of Blake & Brian. Its b-side, \\"God Only Knows\\", was also released as a single, but did not chart. His debut album was slated for release on September 17 of the same year, but it was never released due to Atkins' dissatisfaction with his material. He discussed his dissatisfaction while sitting next to Curb Records owner Mike Curb on an airplane; Curb allowed him to switch producers, and Atkins chose Ted Hewitt, with whom he had been working on demos. Hewitt also changed Atkins' style from a cowboy appearance and a vocal style similar to Roy Orbison to a more polished appearance. Atkins, Hewitt, and Max T. Barnes wrote the track \\"Don't Think I Won't\\" on Mark Wills' 1998 album Wish You Were Here, but he was otherwise inactive until 2002. \\"In a Heartbeat\\" later appeared on the soundtrack of the 2008 film Camille. =Honesty= In mid-2002, Rodney Atkins released his third single, \\"Sing Along\\". Both it and its followup, \\"My Old Man\\", peaked in the lower regions of the Top 40 on the country chart. He entered the Top 10 for the first time in late 2003-early 2004 with \\"Honesty (Write Me a List)\\", which went on to peak at number 4 on the country charts and 57 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was the title track to his album Honesty, which was released by the end of 2003. \\"Someone to Share It With\\" and \\"Monkey in the Middle\\" (both also co-written by Gowan) were also issued as singles, with the former peaking at number 41 on the country charts. Atkins told the Associated Press that he chose to record \\"Honesty\\" because he and producer Ted Hewitt wanted a twelfth song for the album, and co-writer David Kent had recommended it to Hewitt. Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time gave the album a mixed review. He thought that Atkins seemed too similar in sound to labelmate Tim McGraw, but praised some of the songs for having strong melodies. A more favorable review came from Matt Bjorke of About.com, who called it a \\"confident debut from a talented newcomer.\\" =If You're Going Through Hell= Having been absent from the country music charts for most of 2004 and 2005, he returned in 2006 with a single entitled \\"If You're Going Through Hell (Before the Devil Even Knows)\\", which served as the lead-off to his second released album, If You're Going Through Hell. With this album, Atkins once again changed his musical image. He started wearing baseball caps and performing \\"songs about his life.\\" \\"If You're Going Through Hell\\" became his first number 1, spending four weeks at the top of the Hot Country Songs charts; it was also the top country hit of 2006 according to Billboard Year-End. Following \\"If You're Going Through Hell\\" was \\"Watching You\\", which Atkins wrote with Steve Dean and Brian Gene White. This song was inspired by Atkins' son, Elijah, who also stars in its music video. \\"Watching You\\" was also a four-week number 1 hit, and the top country song of 2007 on the Billboard Year-End charts. \\"These Are My People\\" and \\"Cleaning This Gun (Come On In Boy)\\" also went to number 1, making If You're Going Through Hell the first country album to include four number 1 singles since Tim McGraw's 2001 album Set This Circus Down. The album's final single was \\"Invisibly Shaken\\", which Lee Greenwood previously recorded on his 2003 album Stronger Than Time. Atkins' version of the song peaked at number 41. If You're Going Through Hell received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of one million copies, while \\"If You're Going Through Hell\\", \\"Watching You\\", and \\"Cleaning This Gun\\" all received gold certifications for 500,000 music downloads. These songs also made top 40 on the Hot 100 while they were climbing the country charts, while \\"These Are My People\\" reached number 42. Atkins also received the 2006 Academy of Country Music award for Top New Male Vocalist, and \\"If You're Going Through Hell\\" was nominated for Song of the Year. Atkins toured in late 2007-early 2008 as an opening act on Brad Paisley's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour. J. Poet of Allmusic gave the album a positive review, praising the \\"less produced sound\\" and Atkins' vocals on the singles. A mixed review came from Country Standard Time, whose Robert Loy criticized Atkins for singing \\"about what a good ol' boy he is\\" on several songs, but adding that \\"it's fairly obvious he's at least as country as anybody else on the charts these days\\". =It's America= Atkins's thirteenth single, \\"It's America\\", was released in November 2008. It was the first single from his third album, It's America, released in March 2009. Atkins promoted the album through appearances on Larry King Live and a pre-sale promotion on his website. On the chart dated May 2, 2009, \\"It's America\\" became his fifth number 1 hit. Its followup, \\"15 Minutes\\", was released in May 2009 and peaked at number 20 in September. Atkins re-wrote the album's third single, \\"Chasin' Girls\\", for his wife to make it more applicable to their life at the time. After executives at Curb saw the lyrics, the re-written version was released as the album's third single, but did not make top 40. \\"Farmer's Daughter\\" followed in early 2010, and after it reached top 5 late in the year, Curb added it and the re- recording of \\"Chasin' Girls\\" to a re-issue of It's America. The label also re- released If You're Going Through Hell for exclusive sale at Cracker Barrel restaurants, with \\"Farmer's Daughter\\" and the previously-unreleased song \\"More Like Your Memory (Always Takes Me Back)\\" added to the track listing. It's America received mixed reviews. Todd Sterling of Allmusic and Liz Jungers of Roughstock both criticized it for lacking musical variety. It was more favorably reviewed at Country Standard Time, with critic Jeff Lincoln criticizing the title track as \\"forced\\" but saying that otherwise, \\"Atkins has found his niche of singing about the southern tribe.\\" =Take a Back Road= \\"Take a Back Road\\", the lead-off single and title track to his fourth album Take a Back Road, was released in April 2011. It became his sixth number 1 late in the year, and accounted for his highest placement on the Hot 100, at number 23. The song was co-written by Luke Laird and Rhett Akins, the latter of whom co-wrote \\"Farmer's Daughter\\". \\"He's Mine\\" was the album's second single. The song was originally recorded by Billy Ray Cyrus, and Atkins chose to release it because it received positive reactions from fans in concert. It peaked at number 23 on the country chart in April 2012. \\"Just Wanna Rock N' Roll\\", the album's third single, peaked at number 31 on the Country Airplay chart in late 2012. Country Standard Time called Atkins \\"the type of wholesome country musician that you would enjoy hanging out with on a Sunday afternoon with your wife and kids.\\" It received a \\"B\\" from Entertainment Weekly, whose Mikael Wood wrote that Atkins \\"makes for a first-rate correspondent from Anytown, USA.\\" =Greatest Hits and Caught Up in the Country= In September 2013, Atkins released the single \\"Doin' It Right\\", which peaked at 53 on the Country Airplay chart. It was followed in October 2014 by \\"Eat Sleep Love You Repeat\\", which was co-written by Walker Hayes and Ryan Bizarri. The latter song appears on Atkins' Greatest Hits compilation, released in February 2015. This album also includes ten of his previous singles, plus the album cut \\"About the South\\" from If You're Going Through Hell. In 2018, Atkins released a new single titled \\"Caught Up in the Country\\", which features the Fisk Jubilee Singers on backing vocals. This is the first single from an album of the same name, released via Curb on May 10, 2019. As with his other albums, Hewitt again serves as producer. The album includes a song written about Atkins' grandmother-in-law. \\"Caught Up in the Country\\" spent 57 weeks on the Country Airplay charts, setting a new record for the longest continuous run on that chart in May 2019. On August 21, Rodney Atkins released a second single titled, \\"Thank God for You\\". Personal life He married Tammy Jo McDonald in 1998, and the two had a son named Elijah. He also had two stepdaughters, Lindsey and Morgan, from McDonald's previous marriage. Atkins was arrested in November 2011 for allegedly trying to smother his wife with a pillow, while his 10-year-old son watched. He was released on $2,500 bail three hours after the arrest, and was ordered by the Williamson County, Tennessee, court to take an anger assessment which found no need for any further action. The altercation was disputed by Atkins' lawyer, who stated that it was purely verbal. Atkins filed for divorce within 24 hours of the alleged assault. The divorce was settled in late-September 2012. In February 2012, Atkins was cleared of the domestic assault charge. In June 2013, Atkins became engaged to singer Rose Falcon. The couple married on November 10, 2013. Their son, Ryder Falcon Atkins, was born to the couple on December 14, 2017.

As an acknowledged form of literary criticism, it dates back to 1934 when Classical scholar Maud Bodkin published Archetypal Patterns in Poetry. Archetypal literary criticism's origins are rooted in two other academic disciplines, social anthropology and psychoanalysis; each contributed to literary criticism in separate ways, with the latter being a sub-branch of critical theory. Archetypal criticism peaked in popularity in the 1940s and 1950s, largely due to the work of Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye (1912-1991). In the 2010s, archetypal literary criticism is no longer widely practiced; there have not been any major recent developments in the field (with the possible exception of biblical literary criticism For example: ), but it still has a place in the tradition of literary studies. Origins=Frazer= The anthropological origin of archetypal criticism can pre-date its analytical psychology origins by over 30 years. The Golden Bough (1890‚Äì1915), written by the Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer, was the first influential text dealing with cultural mythologies. Frazer was part of a group of comparative anthropologists working out of Cambridge University who worked extensively on the topic. The Golden Bough was widely accepted as the seminal text on myth that spawned numerous studies on the same subject. Eventually, the momentum of Frazer's work carried over into literary studies. In The Golden Bough Frazer identifies practices and mythological beliefs shared among primitive religions and modern religions. Frazer argues that the death-rebirth myth is present in almost all cultural mythologies, and is acted out in terms of growing seasons and vegetation. The myth is symbolized by the death (i.e., final harvest) and rebirth (i.e., spring) of the god of vegetation. As an example, Frazer cites the Greek myth of Persephone, who was taken to the Underworld by Hades. Her mother Demeter, the goddess of the harvest, was so sad that she struck the world with fall and winter. While in the underworld Persephone ate six of the twelve pomegranate seeds given to her by Hades; consequently, she was forced to spend half the year, from then on, in the Underworld, representative of autumn and winter, or the death in the death-rebirth myth. The other half of the year Persephone was permitted to be with Demeter in the mortal realm, which represents spring and summer, or the rebirth in the death-rebirth myth. =Jung= While Frazer's work deals with mythology and archetypes in material terms, the work of Carl Gustav Jung, the Swiss-born founder of analytical psychology, is, in contrast, immaterial in its focus. Jung's work theorizes about myths and archetypes in relation to the unconscious, an inaccessible part of the mind. From a Jungian perspective, myths are the \\"culturally elaborated representations of the contents of the deepest recess of the human psyche: the world of the archetypes\\" (Walker 4). Jungian analytical psychology distinguishes between the personal and collective unconscious, the latter being particularly relevant to archetypal criticism. The collective unconscious, or the objective psyche as it is less frequently known, is a number of innate thoughts, feelings, instincts, and memories that reside in the unconsciousness of all people. Jung's definition of the term is inconsistent in his many writings. At one time he calls the collective unconscious the \\"a priori, inborn forms of intuition\\" (Lietch 998), while in another instance it is a series of \\"experience(s) that come upon us like fate\\" (998). Regardless of the many nuances between Jung's definitions, the collective unconsciousness is a shared part of the unconscious. To Jung, an archetype in the collective unconscious, as quoted from Leitch et al., is \\"irrepresentable, but has effects which make visualizations of it possible, namely, the archetypal images and ideas\\" (988), due to the fact they are at an inaccessible part of the mind. The archetypes to which Jung refers are represented through primordial images, a term he coined. Primordial images originate from the initial stages of humanity and have been part of the collective unconscious ever since. It is through primordial images that universal archetypes are experienced, and more importantly, that the unconscious is revealed. With the same death-rebirth myth that Frazer sees as being representative of the growing seasons and agriculture as a point of comparison, a Jungian analysis envisions the death-rebirth archetype as a \\"symbolic expression of a process taking place not in the world but in the mind. That process is the return of the ego to the unconscious‚Äîa kind of temporary death of the ego‚Äîand its re-emergence, or rebirth, from the unconscious\\" (Segal 4). By itself, Jung's theory of the collective unconscious accounts for a considerable share of writings in archetypal literary criticism; it also pre-dates the height of archetypal literary criticism by over a decade. The Jungian archetypal approach treats literary texts as an avenue in which primordial images are represented. It would not be until the 1950s when the other branch of archetypal literary criticism developed. =Frye= Bodkin's Archetypal Patterns in Poetry, the first work on the subject of archetypal literary criticism, applies Jung's theories about the collective unconscious, archetypes, and primordial images to literature. It was not until the work of the Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye that archetypal criticism was theorized in purely literary terms. The major work of Frye's to deal with archetypes is Anatomy of Criticism but his essay \\"The Archetypes of Literature\\" is a precursor to the book. Frye's thesis in \\"The Archetypes of Literature\\" remains largely unchanged in Anatomy of Criticism. Frye's work helped displace New Criticism as the major mode of analyzing literary texts, before giving way to structuralism and semiotics. Frye's work breaks from both Frazer and Jung in such a way that it is distinct from its anthropological and psychoanalytical precursors. For Frye, the death-rebirth myth, that Frazer sees manifest in agriculture and the harvest, is not ritualistic since it is involuntary, and therefore, must be done. As for Jung, Frye was uninterested about the collective unconscious on the grounds of feeling it was unnecessary: since the unconscious is unknowable it cannot be studied. How archetypes came to be was also of no concern to Frye; rather, the function and effect of archetypes is his interest. For Frye, literary archetypes \\"play an essential role in refashioning the material universe into an alternative verbal universe that is humanly intelligible and viable, because it is adapted to essential human needs and concerns\\" (Abrams 224-225). There are two basic categories in Frye's framework, comedic and tragic. Each category is further subdivided into two categories: comedy and romance for the comedic; tragedy and satire (or ironic) for the tragic. Though he is dismissive of Frazer, Frye uses the seasons in his archetypal schema. Each season is aligned with a literary genre: comedy with spring, romance with summer, tragedy with autumn, and satire with winter. Comedy is aligned with spring because the genre of comedy is characterized by the rebirth of the hero, revival and resurrection. Also, spring symbolizes the defeat of winter and darkness. Romance and summer are paired together because summer is the culmination of life in the seasonal calendar, and the romance genre culminates with some sort of triumph, usually a marriage. Autumn is the dying stage of the seasonal calendar, which parallels the tragedy genre because it is, above all, known for the \\"fall\\" or demise of the protagonist. Satire is metonymized with winter on the grounds that satire is a \\"dark\\" genre; satire is a disillusioned and mocking form of the three other genres. It is noted for its darkness, dissolution, the return of chaos, and the defeat of the heroic figure. The seasons are associated with narrative parallels: *Summer ‚Äì romance. The birth of the hero. *Autumn ‚Äì tragedy. Movement towards the death or defeat of the hero. *Winter ‚Äì irony or satire. The hero is absent. *Spring ‚Äì comedy. The rebirth of the hero. The context of a genre determines how a symbol or image is to be interpreted. Frye outlines five different spheres in his schema: human, animal, vegetation, mineral, and water. The comedic human world is representative of wish-fulfillment and being community centred. In contrast, the tragic human world is of isolation, tyranny, and the fallen hero. Animals in the comedic genres are docile and pastoral (e.g. sheep), while animals are predatory and hunters in the tragic (e.g. wolves). For the realm of vegetation, the comedic is, again, pastoral but also represented by gardens, parks, roses and lotuses. As for the tragic, vegetation is of a wild forest, or as being barren. Cities, a temple, or precious stones represent the comedic mineral realm. The tragic mineral realm is noted for being a desert, ruins, or \\"of sinister geometrical images\\" (Frye 1456). Lastly, the water realm is represented by rivers in the comedic. With the tragic, the seas, and especially floods, signify the water sphere. Frye admits that his schema in \\"The Archetypes of Literature\\" is simplistic, but makes room for exceptions by noting that there are neutral archetypes. The example he cites are islands such as Circe's or Prospero's which cannot be categorized under the tragic or comedic. Other contributors Maud Bodkin wrote Archetypal Patterns in Poetry in 1934, applying the ideas of Jung to poetry, and examining archetypes such as the ancient mariner and rebirth, heaven and hell, images of the devil, the hero and God. Bodkin book. In his 1949 book Hero with a Thousand Faces, Joseph Campbell pioneered the idea of the ‚Äòmonomyth' (though the term was borrowed from James Joyce), a universal pattern in heroic tales across different cultures and genres. His deep examination of the eight step hero's journey (and the common variations that exist) had a huge impact on the Abstract Expressionists of the 1950s, and continues to inspire creative artists today. Theory critiques It has been argued that Frye's version of archetypal criticism strictly categorizes works based on their genres, which determines how an archetype is to be interpreted in a text. According to this argument the dilemma Frye's archetypal criticism faces with more contemporary literature, and that of post-modernism in general, is that genres and categories are no longer distinctly separate and that the very concept of genres has become blurred, thus problematizing Frye's schema. For instance Beckett's Waiting For Godot is considered a tragicomedy, a play with elements of tragedy and satire, with the implication that interpreting textual elements in the play becomes difficult as the two opposing seasons and conventions that Frye associated with genres are pitted against each other. But in fact arguments about generic blends such as tragicomedy go back to the Renaissance, and Frye always conceived of genres as fluid. Frye thought literary forms were part of a great circle and were capable of shading into other generic forms. (He contemplated including a diagram of his wheel in Anatomy of Criticism but thought better of it.) Myth and archetype deals with origin of literary.  Examples in literature  * Femme Fatale: A female character type who brings upon catastrophic and disastrous events. Eve from the story of Genesis or Pandora from Greek mythology are two such figures. * The Journey: A narrative archetype where the protagonist must overcome a series of obstacles before reaching his or her goal. The quintessential journey archetype in Western culture is arguably Homer's Odyssey. Archetypal symbols vary more than archetype narratives or character types. The best archetypal pattern is any symbol with deep roots in a culture's mythology, such as the forbidden fruit in Genesis or even the poison apple in Snow White. These are examples of symbols that resonate with archetypal critics. Archetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies. This archetype may create a shared imaginary which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.

Although she was US owned, the ship was registered in Liberia because of tax and economical reasons.  History  El Paso Sonatrach was along with her sister ships Paul Kayser and Consolidated built in Dunkirk, France in 1977. They all operated out of the Consolidated Natural Gas Company Cove Point LNG import facility (now owned by Dominion Resources) in the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) was loaded and shipped from a Sonatrach facility in Arzew, Algeria. El Paso Sonatrachs call sign was 5LIG. In addition to normal radio communication equipment, she was also equipped with satellite telecommunications equipment supplied by INMARSAT. = Paul Kayser incident = In 1979, the El Paso Paul Kayser (named after the founder of the El Paso Corporation) was stranded off the coast of Algeciras, Spain. She hit a rock pinnacle at and received some severe damage to the outer hull and the containment system. However, her membrane LNG tanks held, and a major operation to save both the ship and her liquefied natural gas cargo was started. El Paso Sonatrach, which was heading for France for repairs was diverted to Algeria to get her tanks cooled down, which took one day. El Paso Sonatrach then proceeded to the location of Paul Kayser to transfer the cargo, an operation which took about three days. She then sailed to the United States to unload the cargo at Cove Point. This was the first such transfer operation ever conducted at sea. The success of this rescue avoided a serious setback for the LNG industry. LNG, if spilled disperses rapidly and is a non-toxic liquid, however the extreme cold of LNG can present hazards until the liquid returns to a gaseous state. In its gaseous state, the vapor is in essence a form of methane and quickly absorbs into the air. El Paso badge used by a crew member of El Paso Sonatrach = Norwegian crew = Originally, three of the El Paso tankers were manned by a Norwegian crew. However, in 1979, the United States Congress (under President Jimmy Carter) decided that American sailors should be preferred as crewmembers on American ships to stop a rise in US unemployment. All the Norwegian sailors were subsequently replaced by American ones in August that year. = End of service = Until 1979, peak loads of LNG was being imported via four terminals, located in the continental United States. After 1979, the import volume declined dramatically, and the terminals were either mothballed or underutilized for two decades. The El Paso LNG tankers were all laid up to rust in 1980. During the period 1985-1987, El Paso Sonatrach and her sister ships were scrapped. During the time she was operational, the Sonatrach made a total of 26 successful US - Algeria voyages.  Unique propulsion plant  The boilers in these class of ships were unique in that they were dual-fueled. As on any other steam ship, the boilers operated on fuel oil; usually Bunker-C. Steam powered LNG carriers however, also burn natural gas. As the cargo tanks absorbed heat from the sea, a portion of the cryogenic LNG cargo boils off, changing from a liquid to a vapor (gas). As a result, pressure within the cargo tanks increases; similar to boiling water in a pressure cooker. To prevent rupturing the thin Invar tank material, pressure is controlled by venting the natural gas evaporate. Natural gas is either released to the atmosphere via vent stacks located above the cargo tanks or compressed and piped to the ship's boilers, which are designed to operate simultaneously on natural gas and fuel oil. The ship's operator transported, but did not own the cargo. The otherwise vented natural gas was therefore a free source of fuel to propel and operate the ship, representing a substantial reduction in the ship's operating costs and source of profit. When the ship entered port, the amount of energy produced by burning the evaporated LNG exceeded the ships needs. This generated excess steam which had to be removed from the boiler. Excess steam was passed through a desuperheater then routed to the propulsion turbine condenser. The desuperheated steam passed over condenser tubes cooled by seawater pumped through the inside of the metal tubes. Thus the energy contained in the evaporated LNG is transferred to the sea. To ensure flammable natural gas was never vented to the atmosphere while in port, operability of this unique system was verified by the Coast Guard before the ship was allowed to enter U.S. waters.

Life Punch, 4 July 1934 Laidler was born on 4 July 1908 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England at 6 Osborne Avenue, Jesmond. His father, George Laidler, owner of a painting and decorating business, died when Laidler was 13 and his mother, Kathleen, eventually the family moved south, finally settling in Jordans in Buckinghamshire. Laidler had always hoped to become a cartoonist but, to ensure an income that would adequately support himself and his widowed mother, he enrolled at the London School of Architecture in 1926. After being diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1932, he was unable to continue with an office-based career and started to concentrate on his cartoons. From 1930-1936 he published a weekly strip The Twiffs, in the magazine Woman's Pictorial. In August 1932 he had his first acceptance from Punch; by 1937 he was so popular that the editor, EV Knox, is understood to have made an almost unprecedented 'gentlemen's' agreement' with him to take all his drawings if Laidler would undertake to draw only for Punch - possibly a bid to make sure he was not poached by Graham Greene's new magazine Night and Day. Under the name ‚ÄòPont‚Äô (derived from a nickname ‚Äì Pontifex Maximus ‚Äì he acquired during a visit to Rome),Pont: The British Character (1936), The Independent, 13 June 2008 Laidler became one of the most original talents in the history of Punch and his work continues to inspire cartoonists to this day. He is perhaps most famous for his series on the ‚ÄòBritish Character‚Äô. This was published as a book in 1938. Another book The British Carry On (1940) portrayed the atmosphere of the phoney war. A famous example shows a placid scene in a country pub, where the radio is tuned to the German propaganda station: 'Meanwhile, in Britain, the entire population, faced by the threat of an invasion, has been flung into a state of complete panic.‚Äô 'At Home', and 'Popular Misconceptions' were also successful series, but by the end of his brief career he was also developing a striking new approach, moving away from the detailed, large drawings to economical, one or two figure sketches with pithy captions. Laidler never married. He died of poliomyelitis on 23 November 1940.Graham Laidler (Pont) , Spartacus Educational Laidler was tall, good-looking and regarded by all with affection. He completed four hundred cartoons in his brief career, enough to furnish the material for five books. Bernard Hollowood, fellow cartoonist and later editor of Punch wrote a biographical account of his life and work in his book Pont (1969). A further, as yet unpublished, biography was written by Laidler's cousin, Ann Glendenning McMullan MBE.

It consists of 10,012 fifteen-syllable rhymed verses, the last twelve of which refer to the poet himself. It is written in the Cretan dialect of the Greek language. Its central theme is love between Erotokritos (only referred to the work as Rotokritos or Rokritos) and Aretousa. Around this theme, revolve other themes such as honour, friendship, bravery and courage. Erotokritos and Erophile by Georgios Hortatzis constitute classic examples of Greek Renaissance literature and are considered to be the most important works of Cretan literature. It remains a popular work to this day, largely due to the music that accompanies it when it is publicly recited. A particular type of rhyming used in the traditional mantinades was also the one used in Erotokritos. Characters The poet narrates the trials and tribulations suffered by two young lovers, Erotokritos and Aretousa, daughter of Heracles, King of Athens. Plot alt= The play takes place in ancient Athens, but the world displayed is a complex construct which does not correspond to any particular historical period. Alongside references to classical Greece there are anachronisms and many elements particular to Western Europe, such as the jousting competition. The work is divided in the following five parts: I. After several years of marriage, a daughter (Aretousa) is born to the King of Athens (Heracles) and his wife. The son of the faithful adviser to the king (Erotokritos) falls in love with the princess. Because he cannot reveal his love, he sings under her window in the evenings. The girl gradually falls in love with the unknown singer. Heracles, when he learns about the singer, organizes an ambush to arrest him, but Erotokritos with his beloved friend kills the soldiers of the king. Erotokritos, realising that his love cannot have a happy ending travels to Chalkida to forget. During his absence, his father falls ill and when Aretousa visits him, she finds in the room of Erotokritos a painting of hers and the lyrics he sang. When he returns, he discovers the absence of his drawing and songs and learns that the only person that visited them was Aretousa. Realizing that his identity was revealed and that he may be at risk, he stays at home pretending to be ill. Aretousa sends him a basket of apples to wish him well and as an indication she shares his feelings. II. The king organizes a jousting competition for the entertainment of his daughter. Many noblemen from around the known world participate and Erotokritos is the winner. III. The couple begins to secretly meet under the window of Aretousa. The girl pleads with Erotokritos to ask her father to allow them to marry. Naturally, the king is angry with the audacity of the young man and has him exiled. Simultaneously a marriage proposal for Arethusa arrives by the king of Byzantium. The girl immediately gets engaged secretly to Erotokritos before he leaves the city. IV. Aretousa refuses to consider any marriage proposals and is imprisoned by the king alongside her faithful nanny. After three years, when the Vlachs besiege Athens, Erotokritos reappears, his true identity concealed through magic. In a battle he saves the life of the king and gets wounded in the process. V. In order to thank the wounded stranger the king offers him his daughter as spouse. Aretousa refuses to accept this marriage and in discussion with the disguised Erotokritos she persists in her refusal. Erotokritos submits her to tests to confirm her faith and finally reveals himself after breaking the spell that concealed his identity. The king accepts the marriage and reconciles with Erotokritos and his father, and Erotokritos ascends to the throne of Athens.  Key Characteristics  336x336pxAlthough with regard to the evolution of the plot, Erotokritos follows all the characteristics of a knightly novel. Kornaros presents some particularities with regard to the structure, with characteristics derived from other literary species. Apart from the epic elements, the presence of dramatic features is also intense: the division into five parts reflects the pentameric division of classical drama, while the theatrical character imparts the frequent presence of the dialogue. The manuscript of the work does not show the pentameric division, which appears only in printed publications, but it is considered by the scholars to be organic and related to the conception of the work by the poet The epic-heroic and erotic element referred to as thematic cores already in the first verses (\\"and even the riots, the conceited and the weights / of Eros the baptism and kissing the grace\\"), coexist in the work divided symmetrically, with erotic superior to the first, the third and the fifth, while the heroic in the second and the fourth, while being interrelated, with one feeding the other: Erotokritos' love for Aretousa is motivated for his participation in the storm, while the man and a bid to the country's king is the fact that allows the success of the relationship. The emphasis on food and erotic imagery is also seen clearly in the work . The importance of the issue of social discrimination also plays a very important role, and the importance of the issue of social discrimination is also crucial: the love of the two heroes is in contradiction with established social conventions and puts them in conflict with their environment, but at the end of the project, \\"personal virtues\\" prevail. Kornaros' significant innovation is the emergence of the hero's psychological state and the convincing justification of the motivations of their behavior.  Use of Language  The language of Erotokritos is the Cretan dialect, mostly within the idiom of Sitia. Typical dialectical formulas such as the articles œÑœÉŒ∑ (œÑŒ∑œÇ) and œÑœÉŒπ (œÑŒπœÇ) are used, the questioning pronoun (e) in the place of the word what. Articles, in the place of reference pronouns to speak of the final one in the general plural and in the plural person (they haven't spoken, they wish to speak), place the pronoun after the verb (assimilation of the climate, for example, have gone), use of the pronounced pronoun self and self-indulgence (according to him). In particular, it is based on the Eastern Cretan idiom and displays its typical characteristics, such as the use of pronouns instead of (the passions), the use of the growth of the past - (in the past), the elimination of the - after - (for example, to claim), as well as the passive indefinite-was, was (-Œ∏Œ∑, -Œ∏Œ∑œÇ, -Œ∏Œ∑(ŒΩ),, for example, instead of ŒµœáŒ¨Œ∏Œ∑). Some characteristics of Erotokritos' voice are an assimilation of the pronounced words in a word, followed by Œª, œÅ or continuous friction Œ∏, œÜ, œá (eg tŒ∑ œáŒ≠œÅŒ±, Œ≠ŒªŒ±œàŒ±, ŒºŒ≠œÜŒµœÑŒ±Œπ, Œ±Œ∏ŒπŒ≤ŒøŒªŒÆ, ). In other cases the word of the article and the semi-text [j], when in the coexistence there is a vowel, e, (for example the julli, the jarrows). Submissive voweling, when preceding a continuous allegorical consonant, that is to say, the sui, Œæi, œài, Œ∂i (anipsos, axos) complexes. The language of Erotokritos is based on the spoken Cretan dialect (mainly in the idiom of Sitia), but it differs from it, if compared to comedies or various documents, since it has few words derived from Italian, while on the contrary it often has more lexical features. The lyrics are also taken care of: the hammerings are avoided and there are no imperfections in rhyme. And lyrics, like the language, differ in some features from the folk song: Shifting to the position of the syllables in the verse (even in single syllables, although the yambus is emphasized by the weights), the frequent presence of strikes and punctuation within the verse, elements that contribute to the rhythmic variety and the avoidance of monotony  Philological issues  There are numerous adaptations and reworks of this play that there is speculation that other plays may be earlier versions of Erotokritos, such as an earlier work known as Thysia. There are three literary issues surrounding Erotokritos. the most important, on which the others depend, is the issue of the poet's identity, as the name Vitsentzos Kornaros was widespread in Crete. The other two important problems are the issue of the dating of the work and the question of the speculated Italian model on which the poet was based. For the subject of the poet, it is accepted by most scholars to identify with Vikidzzo Kornaros of Jacob, brother of the Venetian author Andreas Kornaros. Vicentzos, according to archival sources, was born in 1553 and died in 1613 or 1614. Based on this evidence, it is concluded that Erotokritos was written between 1590 and 1610. [10] On the Italian model on which Kornaros was based, the various adaptations of the French work stand out from the study of two, one of 1543, and one of Angelo Albani's diameters, entitled Innamoramento de due fidelissimi amanti Paris en Vienna, 1626. An examination of all Italian adaptations in relation to Erotokritus has led to the conclusion that the earlier version was the one used by Kornaros, a point accepted by several philologists. This view agrees with the poet's proposed identification Sources The direct model of the work is the French popular medieval romance Paris et Vienne composed by Pierre de la C√©p√®de, which was printed in 1487 and was widely circulated, having been translated to many European languages. Kornaros most likely became familiar with the French original through the Italian translation, since he was unlikely to understand French. He adapted the original creatively and his adaptation displays some merits compared to both the original and other adaptations. The plot is better structured, the characters fewer, some repetitions are reduced and there is more emphasis on the development of the psychology of the heroes. The first part of the work follows the original. The two works differ significantly after the failed marriage proposal. In Paris et Vienne two lovers eloped and attempted to make an escape, but after a while the girl is captured by people of her father and Paris travels in the East. The heroic act that contributes to the pair's reunion in the original is the release of the king from captivity, after he was arrested in an abortive crusade. The end of both plays is similar with the strange benefactor offering to marry the princess and her accepting only after his true identity is revealed. Apart from the French romance, the influence of Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto is evident, particularly in the epic elements of the work. The work was also influenced by the Greek literary tradition and specifically demotic songs and proverbs as well as other texts such as Erofili, Apokopos and Penthos Thanatou. Manuscript and printed edition The work was very popular and circulated in manuscript form throughout the 17th century. In 1713 it was printed in Venice by some Cretan who had collected several manuscripts of the work, and relied on them to deliver a sufficiently valid and reliable version. There are no extant manuscripts of the work except for an unfinished one of 1710. It is decorated with elegant miniatures, but is less valid than the Venetian version in its delivery of the text, because it alters the character of the vernacular language at places. Probably the copying process stopped after the release of the printed version in 1713. Several reprints of the original edition followed, and the first modern edition appeared in 1915 by Stefanos Xanthoudides. Legacy Erotokritos sets great store by true love, friendship, courage, and patriotism, and this is the reason for its later popularity all over Greece. It was a source of inspiration for Dionysios Solomos and influenced Greek poets as diverse as Kostis Palamas, Kostas Krystallis, and George Seferis. A complete translation to English was made by Theodore Stephanides in verse, and by Betts, Gauntlett and Spilias in prose.Vitsenzos Kornaros: \\"Erotokritos.

Several groups of renowned Cretan musicians have added selected parts of the poem to their music, often exploring the boundaries of their local musical tradition.

The role requires registered nurses to take a NMC approved specialist practitioner course. Duties generally include visiting house-bound patients and providing advice and care such as palliative care, wound management, catheter and continence care and medication support. Their work involves both follow-up care for recently discharged hospital inpatients and longer term care for chronically ill patients who may be referred by many other services, as well as working collaboratively with general practitioners in preventing unnecessary or avoidable hospital admissions.  Scope of practice  District nurses assess people to see how to provide nursing care that allows people to remain in their own homes, maintain their independence, or have additional support after discharge from hospital. A district nurse will manage a team of nurses that may provide wound care, train carers to administer eye drops if individuals can not do it themselves, support catheter care, and administer complex medication within a patient's home as well as immunisations. As well as treatment, a district nurse can offer advice and support with health concerns and refer to other organisations. District Nurses can specialise in different areas such as palliative care. United Kingdom District nurses who hold additional qualifications may prescribe certain medications to patients as Community Practitioner Nurse Prescribers under the Nurse Prescribers' Formulary for Community Practitioners (Part XVIIB(i) of the Drug Tariff). They may be trained to assess patient's needs for equipment provision such as mobility and independent living aids, medical equipment such as specialist beds and mattresses, as well as guidance in applying for grants and welfare benefits. In England they were employed by primary care trusts and are now mostly employed by hospital or community health trusts whereas in Wales and Scotland, they are employed by the health board and may be based at centralised health centres or general practices. District nurses, like all qualified nurses, are regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. District nurses can also be known as community nurse specialists. The Queen's Nursing Institute produced a report in 2019 which showed that 22% of respondents to their survey worked a day or more of unpaid overtime each week. 90% regularly did unpaid overtime. District nurses, a job which requires experience, are generally older than hospital nurses and 46% planned to either retire or leave in the next six years. A majority reported that they had insufficient time to devote proper care to patients and 75% said they had vacancies or ‚Äòfrozen posts‚Äô in their teams.  Training  In the UK, training as a district nurse requires registration as a nurse in the adult branch, and consolidation of pre registration nurse education. A degree or postgraduate diploma course is then undertaken which is approved by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC 2001).  New Zealand  In New Zealand, district nurses are usually employed by the district health boards, although there are some who come under private institutions. District Nursing in New Zealand work under the primary integrated care model, and can be classified as secondary care in some DHBs. Like their UK counterparts, New Zealand district nurses have a wide range of specialized clinical skills applicable to the community setting, which is why district nurse positions usually require some degree of previous clinical experience. There is also a strong focus on health issues affecting specific population groups (i.e. Rheumatic Fever prophylaxis). District nurses in New Zealand have access to a higher pay scale compared to registered nurses in an acute setting.  Australia  Australian district nursing is currently undergoing pressure as a result of large changes in funding. Previously, community nursing was predominantly government-funded via block funding, having grown from volunteer or charitable organisations. The introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the new aged care system means funding is being made accessible to clients who can then decide how to spend it. This has forced a greater level of competition on to the industry. This has led to many previously large district nursing organisations, such as the Royal District Nursing Service, amalgamating with residential care providers to attempt to build a vertically integrated model.  History  Melbourne, 1904. Organised district nursing in England is considered to have begun in 1859. In 1858 Liverpool philanthropist William Rathbone employed a nurse, Mary Robinson, to take care of his wife at home during her final illness.William Rathbone and the beginning of District Nursing DistrictNursing.org After his wife‚Äôs death in 1859, he engaged Mary to go into one of the poorest districts of the City to bring healthcare to people who had no means to pay for it. He spent the rest of his life working to build up the service, with assistance from Florence Nightingale and others. District nursing on the Liverpool model soon sprang up in other towns, cities and rural areas, funded by local philanthropists. In 1887 Queen Victoria‚Äôs Jubilee Institute for Nurses was founded, centralising training for district nurses (or Queen‚Äôs Nurses as they became known) until nursing education became nationalised in 1968. The charity, which became the Queen's Nursing Institute, continues to support community nurses to this day. The Institute always needed to raise funds and until the creation of the NHS in 1948, district nurses collected contributions from their patients.

He built harpsichords, clavichords, organs, and fortepianos; his modern reputation rests mainly on the latter two. Life Very little is known about Silbermann's youth. He was born in Kleinbobritzsch (now a part of Frauenstein, Saxony) as the youngest son of the carpenter Michael Silbermann. They moved to the nearby town of Frauenstein in 1685, and it is possible that Gottfried also learnt carpentry there. He moved to Stra√üburg in 1702, where he learnt organ construction from his brother and came in touch with the French-Alsatian school of organ construction. He returned to Saxony as a master craftsman in 1710, and opened his own organ workshop in Freiberg one year later. His second project in Germany was the \\"Grand Organ\\" in the Freiberg Cathedral of St. Mary, finished in 1714. In 1723 he was bestowed the title K√∂niglich Polnischen und Churf√ºrstlich S√§chsischen Hof- und Landorgelmachers (\\"Honorary Court and State Organ Builder to the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony\\") by Frederick I. Silbermann died in Dresden in 1753, probably as the result of a tin-lead poisoning, while still working on the organ at the Hofkirche. Silbermann's organs Silbermann organ in Freiberg Cathedral The organs that Silbermann and his brother Andreas Silbermann built show a clear and distinctive style, both in architecture and in their music qualities. Gottfried Silbermann never deviated from this style. His ability to earn money with organ construction was remarkable, leading him to uncommon wealth, and his economic operation and slow consolidation of his position eventually created a near monopoly. His apprentices had to pledge never to work in Central Germany. Silbermann's non-negotiable style was not welcome everywhere, an important example of an opponent being Johann Sebastian Bach, who, unlike Silbermann who tuned in meantone temperament, preferred a more flexible tuning. Silbermann designed and built approximately 50 organs, 29 of which are still in existence in Saxony, including the organ in the Hofkirche in Dresden. The Hofkirche organ and that of Freiberg Cathedral are considered his greatest works. The organ in Freiberg Cathedral has three manuals, or keyboards, and 41 stops divided between the Oberwerk, Hauptwerk, Brustwerk and Pedal divisions. (A division is a section of pipes in the same place within an organ, played from one manual; there generally one manual for each division, and the pedal has its own division.) Silbermann's organs are characterised by the use of strong reeds, a broad range of stops, and pipes with a high tin content, which adds a distinctive brightness to the tone.Marx, Wolfgang. Notes on the Organs in Volume 8 of the Bach 2000 edition. Silbermann and the piano Silbermann was also a central figure in the history of the piano. He transmitted to later builders the crucial ideas of Bartolomeo Cristofori (the inventor of the piano), ensuring their survival, and also invented the forerunner of the damper pedal. Evidence from the Universal-Lexicon of Johann Heinrich Zedler indicates that Silbermann first built a piano in 1732, only a year after Cristofori's death. Silbermann may have found out about Cristofori's invention as follows. In 1709, Scipione Maffei did research on the newly invented piano, including an interview with Cristofori, and published his findings (with a ringing endorsement of the instrument) in a 1711 Italian journal article. In 1725, this article was translated into German by the Dresden court poet Johann Ulrich K√∂nig, who was almost certainly a personal acquaintance of Silbermann. In his mature pianos, Silbermann scrupulously copied the complex action found in Cristofori's last instruments, failing only to produce a correct copy of the back check. Silbermann also copied another ingenious Cristofori invention, the inverted wrest plank. In other respects (case construction, choice of wood species, string diameters and spacing, keyboard design), Silbermann relied on his own experience as a harpsichord builder. During the 1740s, King Frederick the Great of Prussia became acquainted with Silbermann's pianos and bought a number of them (the early-19th-century musicologist Johann Nikolaus Forkel claims this number was 15, though Stewart Pollens (reference below) believes this to be \\"certainly exaggerated\\"). Two of Silbermann's pianos are still located in Frederick's palaces in Potsdam today; they stand out for their elegant but plain and sober design amid the elaborate splendor of their surroundings. There is Silbermann original in Germanisches Nationalmuseum. Famous Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was employed by Friderich the Great in Potsdam and was playing Silbermann fortepianos (also accompanying Friderich the traverso flute), so this way Silbermann pianos are connected with CPE Bach name and his music, which was written for this particular fortepiano model. Paul McNulty made a copy of Gottfried Silbermann‚Äôs 1749 instrument for Malcolm Bilson. =The forerunner of the damper pedal= Silbermann invented a device by which the player could lift all of the dampers off the strings, permitting them to vibrate freely, either when struck or sympathetically when other notes were played. This is the function in later pianos of the damper pedal. Silbermann's device was different from the modern damper pedal in two respects. First, it was not actually controlled by a pedal, but rather was a hand stop, which required the player to cease playing on the keys for a moment in order to change the damper configuration. Thus, it was a device for imparting an unusual tonal color to whole passages, rather than a means of nuanced expression as the pedal is today. Second, Silbermann's device was bifurcated, permitting the dampers of the treble and bass sections to be lifted separately. This latter feature has recently been reintroduced to the piano, in the form of the fourth and fifth pedals of pianos made by the Borgato firm; see Innovations in the piano. There are at least two possible reasons for why Silbermann invented his damper-lifting mechanism. First, as an organ builder, he may have favored the idea of providing the player with a variety of tonal colors. The same impulse led German harpsichord builders of the time occasionally to include two-foot (two octaves higher than normal pitch) and sixteen-foot (one octave lower) choirs of strings in their instruments. In addition, Silbermann had until 1727 built very large hammer dulcimers, called pantaleons, on behalf of Pantaleon Hebenstreit, who achieved a sensational career with virtuosic playing on this demanding instrument. The pantaleon, like any other hammered dulcimer, had no dampers and thus created a wash of sound. Silbermann later had a falling out with Hebenstreit and was blocked by a royal writ from building any further pantaleons. Stewart Pollens conjectures that in adding the damper-raising stop to the piano, Silberman may have been attempting to partially circumvent this restriction. =Silbermann and Bach= The 18th-century musician Johann Friedrich Agricola tells a story about the relationship of Silbermann, Johann Sebastian Bach, and pianos. After Silbermann had completed two instruments, Agricola says, he showed them to Bach, who replied critically, saying that the tone was weak in the treble and the keys were hard to play even though the tone was pleasant. Silbermann was stung and angered by the criticism, but ultimately took it to heart and was able to improve his pianos (exactly how is not known, but it may have been the result of Silbermann's encountering Cristofori's most mature instruments). The improved Silbermann pianos met with Bach's \\"complete approval\\" (\\"v√∂llige Guthei√üung\\"), and indeed a preserved sales voucher dated May 8, 1749 shows that Bach acted as an intermediary for Silbermann in the sale of one of his pianos. Bach also endorsed Silbermann's organs as well, as borne out by the fact that he was asked by both the church and Silbermann to give the inaugural concert of his new instrument on 1 December 1736 for the Frauenkirche Dresden. =Silbermann's pupils= Silbermann's most important contribution to the piano may have been as the teacher of other builders. His nephew and pupil Johann Andreas Silbermann was the teacher of Johann Andreas Stein, who perfected the so-called \\"Viennese action\\", found in the pianos used by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Another group of Silbermann pupils were the so-called the \\"twelve apostles\\". These builders fled Germany during and after the time of chaos created by the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), migrating to England, where economic prosperity was creating new opportunities for instrument builders. The \\"twelve apostles\\" included Johannes Zumpe, whose invention of an affordable small square piano greatly popularized the instrument. They also included Americus Backers, one of the inventors of the \\"English action\\", which was a modified version of the Cristofori action. Silbermann's role was crucial because, unlike other builders of his day, he refused to compromise on the quality of the action. Cristofori's action was complex and hard to build, leading many builders (e.g. Zumpe) to use instead a simplified, but clumsier action. Through Backers and others, the original conception of a complex but effective action survived. The English action was later modified and improved further by S√©bastien √ârard and Henri Herz to yield the action used in all grand pianos today. With the advent of industrial methods of manufacture, it ultimately became economical to include the complex modern action even in inexpensive pianos, thus vindicating Silbermann's original decision. Silbermann's fame as a builder and teacher was such that for many decades he was regarded as the inventor of the piano; it was only with nineteenth-century scholarship that this honor was restored to Cristofori.

The houses were located around the edge of the hill and it is assumed that there was a public building or temple at the center. A Mycenaean cemetery has been found nearby. The name of the settlement is unknown. Pottery and stone tools dating to the 11th century BC have been found. During the Frankish rule (13th-14th century) Chalandritsa was initially part of the Barony of Patras, from which it was separated as the Barony of Chalandritsa. The barony was ruled by the French Dramelay (or Tr√©molay) family and later the Genoese Zaccaria family. The French name, as preserved in the Chronicle of Morea, was Calandrice. Chalandritsa was the last barony remaining in Frankish hands, and its fall to the Despotate of the Morea in 1429 also signalled the end of the Principality of Achaea. After that, it followed the fate of the rest of Achaea. During the Greek War of Independence, on 26 February 1822, the town was ransacked and burned 2,000 Turks. In July 1943, during World War II, the occupying Italian army fired on Chalandritsa in retaliation for a partisan attack. During the Greek Civil War, in 1948, Chalandritsa was the scene of fierce fighting between government and rebel forces.

While living in the inner city of Washington, D.C., for a year, Dash researched teenage pregnancy in black youths for his book, When Children Want Children: The Urban Crisis of Teenage Childbearing. The book features conversations with teens and contains stories that contradict the common belief that inadequate birth control and lack of sex education classes are the causes of teenage pregnancy. He received an Emmy Award in 1996 from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for a documentary series in the public affairs category of hard issues. In 1998 Dash joined the University of Illinois as a professor of Journalism. He was later named the Swanlund Chair Professor of Journalism, Law, and Afro-American Studies in 2000. Three years later he was made a permanent faculty member in the University's Center for Advanced Study. Dash is a founder of the National Association of Black Journalists.NABJ Founders. A technical oversight on Dash's part led to his being sanctioned by the Illinois Executive Ethics Commission on October 31, 2014. A University of Illinois faculty colleague, physicist George D. Gollin, was running in the March 14, 2014 Democratic primary nomination for Illinois's U. S. Congressional District 13 Seat. Gollin sent a message to Dash on his University office computer about Dash introducing him at a local meeting. Dash replied on his University computer, \\"Please get the introduction to me tomorrow or early Sunday. Thanks.\\" Dash was later questioned about his one-sentence reply by investigators from the Illinois Executive Ethics Commission regarding the use of his University computer for political purposes. Shown a copy of his one-sentence reply, Dash acknowledged he had replied to the email without giving any thought that he was not allowed to do so on a University computer even when the original message came into his email inbox. See On August 5, 2016, Dash was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the National Associated of Black Journalists (NABJ) along with 43 other founders of the organization.

His notable trials include the trial of Enron Chairman Ken Lay and former Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling. Education and career Lake was born on July 4, 1944, in Chicago, Illinois. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Texas A&M; University in 1966, where he participated in the MSC Student Conference on National Affairs committee. He received a Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School of Law in 1969, graduating number one in his class. He was in private practice of law in Houston, Texas from 1969 to 1970. He was in the United States Army from 1970 to 1971 as a Judge Advocate General's Corps prosecutor in Vietnam. He was in private practice of law in Houston from 1972 to 1988, with the law firm of Fulbright & Jaworski LLP. Federal judicial service Lake was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1988, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas vacated by Judge Ross N. Sterling. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 11, 1988, and received commission on August 12, 1988. He assumed senior status on July 5, 2019. Notable cases Besides the Enron cases, Lake has participated in other notable cases: *In 2004, he ordered the Bible removed from a display on the grounds of the Harris County Civil Courthouse. *In 1999, he ordered the Houston Independent School District to pay private school tuition for a disabled student it could not accommodate. *In 1997, he directed an acquittal and mistrial of Stanislaw Burzynski on three dozen counts of fraud after a jury deadlocked on the fate of the doctor who used unproven therapies. On October 23, 2006, Lake sentenced Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling to the minimum possible sentence under federal guidelines, 24 years, with significantly less time actually expected to be served by Skilling. Lake imposed this rather lenient sentence despite federal laws that would have allowed for a significantly longer prison sentence. He later vacated all convictions of Ken Lay, following Lay's death, allowing Lay's family to keep all Lay's accumulated wealth, a ruling later upheld despite the public's attempt to recover its multibillion-dollar losses. In April 2013, Judge Lake ruled that videos showing cruelty to animals are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution despite laws against cruelty to animals and evidence that cruelty to animals can be a precursor to cruelty to human beings as well as murder. A petition has been launched to reverse this ruling.

Friedrich, a banker and wire producer, married his cousin Katharina Thyssen in 1838 and had two sons, August and Joseph. August Thyssen founded the Thyssen Steel conglomerate and with wife Hedwig Pelzer had three children: Fritz, Heinrich, and Hedwig. August's brother Joseph assisted him in his business and with his wife Klara Bagel had two children: Julius and Hans.

It is home to Hastings United who currently play in the Isthmian League, the club have used the ground since 1985 after the old Hastings United folded, having previously used the ground between 1920 and 1948. The current capacity stands at 4,050 although over 9,000 have been known to attend events in the past and the closure of the grass bank has decreased the capacity.  History  The site is first mentioned in 1560 as 'the Pilate Field', most likely a field used for growing pilled oats and where the area gets its name from. In 1886 the large sloping meadow was proposed as the new site for the Hastings Workhouse, however the proposal was met with opposition from local residents and landowners and the scheme was eventually dropped. In 1920 the site was earmarked as a site of a potential new sports ground for the town alongside Horntye Park, with the Pilot Field being preferred as it could be ready to use for the 1920‚Äì21 football season. The site was acquired by the Hastings Corporation in June 1920, with the Hastings Sports Association taking control in August who did the necessary work needed on the ground for Rock-a-Nore FC to compete in the Sussex County League. The first football match to take place was between Rock-a-Nore and Chichester, with the visitors winning in front of a crowd of at least 1,000. At first the site was simply a large slope with a football pitch fenced off, with the ground also being used for cricket and rugby. The site was split into two more level pitches (upper and lower), with a cycling track being constructed around the lower pitch. Despite already being in use for the two years the Pilot Field was officially opened on 8 November 1922, with a game between a Hastings representatives and Queens Park Rangers. View the covered terrace at the Elphinstone Road end In 1925 work on the main stand had started and was officially opened in April 1926, in an opening ceremony where 1,500 assembled in the structure. The cycling track was upgraded to cinder in 1948, in preparation for the Hastings Saxons speedway team moving into the ground. The same year saw the Hastings & St Leonards amateur club get kicked off in favour for the newly formed professional club Hastings United, who would stay at the ground until 1985. The ground would see a number of improvements during Hastings United's tenure, including the erection of two new stands at the Elphinstone Road end of the ground in the mid 1950s and the erection of floodlights in 1964. The old speedway track was eventually concreted over to allow spectators to get closer to the playing area and for the erection of the dugouts in front of the main stand. A new squash complex constructed in the opposite corner to the main turnstiles was opened in 1980, but was later sold off to recuperate some of the debt owed by Hastings United. In 1985 Hastings United folded and Hastings Town moved in from the old upper pitch, now called the Firs, with the ground receiving minor refurbishment work to represent the club colours of red and white. By the 1990s the two Elphinstone Road end stands were in poor condition, with the stand directly behind the goal receiving a major renovation in the mid 1990s whilst the other stand was closed to spectators, before eventually being demolished by 2000. A new clubhouse was built in 1998 and then further extended the following year, with the old clubhouse under the main stand becoming the boardroom. A new stand was built ahead of the 2005‚Äì06 season and was named the 'Cole Warren' stand after two supporters, this structure consists of a small number of rows of terracing and elevated viewing area for wheelchair users. In 2010 four new sets of floodlights replaced the old pylons which had been erected in 1964 and in 2016 the club purchased the old squash complex which was now a sports and social club.  Structure and facilities  View of the south-west corner of the ground with the main stand in the background The most prominent structure at the ground is the main stand, which covers about three quarters of the length of one side of the pitch. The capacity is 800 for seated spectators mostly on wooden benches, but there are plastic seats to the centre in front of the public address box, some of which are reserved for board members and other guests. There are more plastic seats located to the left of this block covering the front rows, which were relocated from the Firs after St Leonards folded in 2004. Underneath the main stand are the changing rooms, boardroom and a tea bar. The age of the main stand has led to ever increasing maintenance costs for the club and is a major factor in their effort to find a new stadium. On the opposite side to the main stand is a grass bank, which at one point was open to spectators but was fenced off for health and safety. The closing off of the bank meant the capacity of ground went from 9,000 to 4,050. To the east of the bank, is the Hastings United Sports and Social Club, purchased in 2016, this building contains a gym, a bar and a viewing deck. The east side of the ground is where the Cole Warren stand is, behind the stand, the remains of the speedway track still exists and is used as a car park for players. On the west side of the ground, is the Elphinstone Road end terrace, with the clubhouse immediately to the south. In the south-west corner is a building that houses the club shop, toilets and a tea bar.  Other uses  View of the Pilot Field hosting Speedway When first opened the ground was intended to be used by various sports including football, rugby and hockey. There are no known records of hockey taking place at the Pilot Field, but there are records of rugby being played. Cricket was also played at the ground between 1920-1922 before being split into upper and lower pitches. The Hastings & St Leonards cycling club also made use of the cycling track built in 1922. The venue also hosted sports days and athletic events. In 1948 the Hastings Saxons moved to the venue after Eastbourne Eagles were forced out of their stadium at Arlington due to a petrol ban, however the club left in 1949 following complaints about the noise from local residents. The speedway meets regularly attracted crowds of 9,000. It was proposed to introduce greyhound racing at the Pilot Field in 1939 and again in the 1966, but there are no records to show any races ever happening.  Records  The known recorded record attendance for football at the Pilot Field is 12,527, when Hastings United drew 3-3 against Norwich City 1953‚Äì54 FA Cup third round tie. The record attendance a game featuring the newer Hastings United, is 4,888 in a friendly against Nottingham Forest when they were Hastings Town. The Hastings Saxons regularly attracted crowds of 9,000 but it is unknown if they ever attracted a crowd larger than 12,527.  Transport  The ground is located 1.1 miles away from Ore railway station, which is situated on the Marshlink line between Hastings and Ashford International. Hastings railway station is located 1.6 miles away and served by Southern and Southeastern. Situated on the Marshlink Line, East Coastway line to Brighton and the Hastings line to Tonbridge, this station has more frequent services.

On 21 December 1904, she married Austrian physicist Paul Ehrenfest (1880‚Äì1933). They had two daughters and two sons; one daughter, Tatyana Pavlovna Ehrenfest, also became a mathematician.  Early life  Afanasyeva was born in Kiev, Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire. Her father was Alexander Afanassjev, a chief engineer on the Imperial Railways, who would bring Tatyana on his travels around the Russian Empire. Her father died while she was still young, so she moved to St Petersburg in Russia to live with her aunt Sonya, and uncle Peter Afanassjev, a professor at the St Petersburg Polytechnic Institute. Tatyana attended normal school in St Petersburg with a specialty in mathematics and science. At the time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russian territory, so after graduating from normal school, Tatyana began studying mathematics and physics at the Women's University in St Petersburg under Orest Chvolson. In 1902, she transferred to University of G√∂ttingen in Germany to continue her studies with Felix Klein and David Hilbert. At the University of G√∂ttingen, Tatyana met Paul Ehrenfest. When Ehrenfest discovered that Tatyana could not attend a mathematics club meeting, he argued with the school to have the rule changed. A friendship developed between the two, and they married in 1904, later returned to St Petersburg in 1907. Under Russian law, marriage was not allowed between two people of different religions. Since Tatyana was a Russian Orthodox and Ehrenfest was Jewish, they both decided to officially renounce their religions in order to remain married. In 1912 they moved to Leiden in the Netherlands, where Paul Ehrenfest was appointed to succeed H.A. Lorentz as professor at the University of Leiden, and where the couple lived throughout their career.  Works in mathematics and physics Initially, Tatyana collaborated closely with her husband, most famously on their classic 1911 review of the statistical mechanics of Boltzmann. The Conceptual Foundations of the Statistical Approach in Mechanics, by Paul and Tatyana Ehrenfest was originally published in 1911 as an article for the German Encyklop√§die der mathematischen Wissenschaften (Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences), and has since been translated and republished. She published many papers on various topics such as randomness and entropy, and teaching geometry to children. =Contact with Einstein= Albert Einstein was a frequent guest in the 1920s at her home Witte Rozenstraat 57 in Leiden, witness the many signatures on the wall. Later Einstein departed for Princeton University and Afanasyeva corresponded. The archives of Museum Boerhaave in Leiden has three letters to her from Einstein. Afanasjeva contacted Einstein for his advice on her manuscript on thermodynamics and inquired about a translator. She wanted to give thermodynamics a rigorous mathematical foundation which was lacking and describe pressure, temperature and entropy in changing systems. Einstein responded on 12 August 1947 that he applauded her approach but he also had some criticisms: :\\"Ich habe den Eindruck gewonnen, dass Sie ein bisschen von logischen Putzteufel besessen sind, und dass daran die √úbersichtlichkeit des Buches leide.\\" :(Translation: I have got the impression, that you are possessed somewhat by a logical polishing devil, and that the clarity of the book suffers.) Einstein did not suggest a translator and sent the manuscript back to Afanasjeva who paid herself for its publication in 1956 as Die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik with Brill Publishers in Leiden with some, but not all of Einstein's corrections. Notes # . See p. 57: \\"In 1912 Ehrenfest succeeded Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853‚Äì1928) as professor of theoretical physics at Leiden. ... In Leiden, the Ehrenfests moved into a Russian-style villa designed by Ehrenfest‚Äôs Russian wife Tatiana Afanashewa, a mathematician.\\" # P. Ehrenfest & T.

He lived to become 'the richest merchant that ever was dwelling in Newcastell', and three times mayor of that town. History The old saying was: :At the Westgate came Thornton in :With a hap, a halfpenny, and a lambskin. He was elected Mayor of Newcastle for 1400‚Äì01, 1402‚Äì1406, 1416‚Äì17 and 1423‚Äì1426, a total of 9 times. He took the side of Henry IV against the rebel Earl of Northumberland (in whose cause Hotspur had fallen) and received on 28 July 1405 'in consideration of his services and of the losses he had sustained, and the charges he had borne in the late rebellion of the Earl of Northumberland, and others, the Foucher (Fugar) House in Whickham, as well as other estates in Cleveland.' He represented Newcastle-upon-Tyne in parliament in 1399, 1411, 1417 and 1419, the last being the fifth year of the reign of Henry V. Thornton was a speculator in lead mines, and he was certainly working some in Weardale under lease from the Bishop of Durham in 1401. He was remembered for his liberality to Newcastle, building a town court and also a Maison Dieu or hospital for poor people in the Sandhill. Thornton died in the Broad Chare on 3 January 1430. His monumental brass, of the incised, Flemish type, is now in Newcastle Cathedral, and is said to be the largest brass in the country. It was originally installed in the medieval All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne nearby, which was later demolished and rebuilt.

During the housing boom of the 2000s, many houses changed ownership and have been returned to their former beauty. Some of the homes have been raised to flood heights as well.

The poet of the era, Ukrayinska Pravda (26 December 2018)) is a Ukrainian poet and writer, recipient of the Shevchenko Award (1987). Kostenko is a leading representative of Ukrainian poets of the sixties known as the Sixtiers. This group started publishing during the 1950s and reached its apex during the early 1960s. It was during the 1950s when Kostenko published her first poems in major Ukrainian periodicals. She is a Honored Professor of Kyiv Mohyla Academy, Honorary Doctor of Lviv and Chernivtsi Universities. Life Early years Kostenko was born in a family of teachers. In 1936, she moved from Rzhyshchiv to Kyiv, where she finished her secondary education. From 1937 to 1941 she studied at the Kyiv school #100, which was located on Trukhanov island, where her family lived. The school and the whole village was burned in 1943. The poem \\"I grew up in Kyivan Venice\\" is devoted to these events. After graduating from high school, she studied at the Kyiv Pedagogical Institute, and later - at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow, from where she graduated with distinction in 1956. Sixtiers She was one of the first and most noteworthy in the band of young Ukrainian poets, acting at the turn of the 1950s-1960s. The period of the so-called \\"sixtiers\\" created the newest styles in the Ukrainian literature, made it create something new, atypical, then avant-garde, but, as always, ruthless and as critical as possible to the authorities and the existing regime. In the early 1960s, she took part in the literary evenings of the Kyiv Creative Youth Club. Following her graduation she published three collections of poetry in 1957 (\\"The Rays of the Earth\\"), 1958 (\\"Sails\\") and 1961(\\"Wandering of the Heart\\"). These books became immensely popular among her Ukrainian readers, however they also forced her into publication silence as she was unwilling to submit to Soviet authorities. Since 1961, she was criticized for \\"apoliticism.\\" In 1963, the collection of poems by Lina Kostenko \\"The Star Integral\\" was removed from print and another collection of poems \\"The Prince's Mountain\\" was removed from typography. During these years, Kostenko's poems were published in Czechoslovakia's magazines, Poland's newspapers, and only occasionally in Ukraine's one, mostly in \\"samizdat.\\" In 1965 Lina Kostenko signed a letter of protest against arrests of the Ukrainian intelligentsia. She was present at the trial of Mykhailo Osadchyi and Myroslava Zvarychevska in Lviv. During the trial of the Horyn brothers, she threw them flowers. Together with Ivan Drach she appealed to the editorial office of the magazine \\"Zhovten\\" (now \\"Dzvin\\") and to the Lviv writers with a proposal to speak out in defense of the arrested. The writers did not dare to protest, but filed a lawsuit with the request to admit Bohdan Horyn on bail as the youngest of arrested. These efforts did not influence the trials, although they made a huge moral significance. In May 1966 in the National Writers' Union of Ukraine, where the \\"nationalist outlaws\\" were labeled, a part of the youth held the ovation of L. Kostenko, who defended his position and defended Ivan Svitlichny, Opanas Zalyvaha, Myhajlo Kosiv and Bohdan Horyn. In 1968 she wrote letters in defense of Viacheslav Chornovil in response to the defamation against him in the newspaper \\"Literary Ukraine.\\" After that, the name of Lina Kostenko was not mentioned in the Soviet press for many years. She worked \\"in the drawer\\", knowing that her works were not going to be published. In 1973 Lina Kostenko got on the \\"black lists,\\" compiled by the secretary of the Central Committee on ideology of the Communist Party of Ukraine Valentyn Malanchuk. Only in 1977, after the departure of V. Malanchuk, was her collection of poems \\"On the shore of the eternal river\\" published, and in 1979, under a special decree of the Presidium of the Socialist-Revolutionary Guard, one of her greatest works was published, a historical novel in the verses \\"Marusia Churai\\" (about at 17th century Ukrainian folksinger) which had stagnated with recognition for 6 years. She was awarded the Taras Shevchenko National Prize of the Ukrainian SSR for in 1987. Kostenko also wrote collections of poems \\"Originality\\" (1980) and \\"Garden of Unthawed Sculptures\\" (1987), collection of poems for children \\"The Lilac King\\" (1987). Her most recent collection is Berestechko, a book length historical poem.

It was broadcast at 11pm from Mondays to Thursdays, replacing the last twenty minutes of Newsnight on BBC Two Scotland. The programme was presented by Glenn Campbell on Mondays, and Gordon Brewer fronted the programme on Tuesday, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Isobel Fraser, Sally Magnusson and Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland co-presenter Gary Robertson also appeared on the show as stand-in presenters. In 1999, the programme had a Friday edition with a brief news summary before being dropped. The programme's original presenters were Anne Mackenzie and Gordon Brewer between 1999 and 2007. It was broadcast from Studio C at Pacific Quay Studios in Glasgow, using the same set as Reporting Scotland. History 'Newsnight Scotland' came about as a result of calls for a Scottish-based version of the BBC Six O'Clock News (the so-called \\"Scottish Six\\") following the vote in favour of Scottish devolution. As this did not come about a 'compromise' was then reached in 1999, when Newsnight Scotland was devised. Its creation was somewhat controversial, with Jeremy Paxman describing it as a \\"damn fool idea\\" and a ‚Äúdog‚Äôs breakfast‚Äù, there was also internal and external resistance to the idea of a Scottish opt-out from the network programme. A number of newspapers at the time also predicted its demise. First broadcast on Monday 4 October 1999, it was originally presented by a team of three; Gordon Brewer, John Milne and Anne Mackenzie. Newsnight Scotland covered all topical and political issues that affect Scotland. Often the issues derived from the goings-on at the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood. The programme investigated many topics, including the costs of the construction of the Holyrood site. It reported in great detail about the decisions leading to this, including the competition for Scotland's new parliament. The biggest story covered was the parliament itself; with extensive coverage of the Fraser Inquiry. The series was criticised again in 2008, when Gordon Brewer asserted that a broader view of the news was needed and that it wasn't sufficient to simply \\"put a kilt\\" on UK and international stories. = Cancellation = In February 2014, BBC announced Newsnight Scotland would end during 2014 and be replaced by Scotland 2014 as part of a shake up of BBC Scotland's referendum coverage. The final edition was broadcast on 22 May 2014.

The band was initially composed of keyboardist/lead vocalist, Bryan Duncan, and brothers Kevin (bass guitar) and Rick (drums/vocals) Thomson. The band was the brainchild of the Thomson brothers. Randy Thomas, guitarist/vocalist joined the group around 1976. After their second album, Sweet Comfort Band also became well known for their highly detailed, airbrushed album cover art by Kernie Erickson, a trend that had previously been considered too costly for Christian groups who did not produce the high-volume album sales of mainstream bands such as Kansas. The Sweet Comfort Band logo was created by Rick Griffin. Sweet Comfort Band was a late entry into Jesus music with their 1977 self- titled release on Maranatha! Records. When they started, they had a funky, jazzy, R&B; and 70's rock sound. This set them apart from many of the bands in the nascent Contemporary Christian music industry who were primarily performing folk-rock and soft rock. Few bands had the musicianship displayed by this quartet. However, Maranatha! decided to quit releasing rock and roll albums and focus on children's releases, gospel and worship music. Light Records welcomed them for their second release Breakin' The Ice. For the next six years they toured heavily to support their releases and the band drifted towards a more traditional radio-rock sound. Keyboardist, John Andrew Schreiner was added as a supplemental musician during their tours in later years, as Duncan took more of a vocal-heavy, lead frontman role on stage and away from performing integrated keyboard parts. The band went their separate ways in the summer 1984, culminating at their final concert near their home at Riverside Municipal Stadium after releasing six albums and garnering a large fan base. Bryan Duncan released a number of solo projects over the next eighteen years. Randy Thomas went on to found the band Allies and co-wrote radio hit Butterfly Kisses with former Allies band member Bob Carlisle. Rick Thomson co-produced a compilation album called Voices (Myrrh Records) in 1987 featuring CCM artists such as Bob Carlisle, Bryan Duncan, John Elefante, Tommy Funderburk, Benny Hester, Howard Mc Crary, Rick Riso, Matthew Ward and others. The project had numerous hits. Rick was also licensed as a General Contractor in 1984 and has run a successful construction business for 29 years. In 1987 he built Shelter Sound Studio and continued as a prolific songwriter and producer. On January 13, 2010, the wife of Rick Thomson reported online that Rick Thomson, Randy Thomas, and Bryan Duncan were in the studio for the first time in over twenty-five years, having written several new songs. The resulting 2013 album is called The Waiting Is Over.http://officialsweetcomfortband.com/subdirectory/?albums=the-waiting-is- over Kevin Thomson, brother of Rick and longtime bassist for the group, died on May 30, 2010 at age 57, after a long illness.

The university was established in 1958 as a result of a merger of Flora MacDonald College in Red Springs and Presbyterian Junior College; it was named St. Andrews Presbyterian College from 1960 until 2011 when the college changed its name to St. Andrews University. That same year, the college entered into a merger with Webber International University of Babson Park, Florida. It is also home to the St. Andrews Press. In 2013, St. Andrews added its first graduate program, an MBA in business administration.St. Andrews Press  History = Early history = The institution was founded in 1958, established as a result of the merger of Flora MacDonald College in Red Springs (est. 1896) and Presbyterian Junior College in Maxton (est. 1928). The new college was named St. Andrews Presbyterian College on September 23, 1960. The name reflected its Scottish Presbyterian heritage and identified it with the University of St Andrews in Scotland. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 15, 1959, followed shortly by construction of a campus on an 800-acre location on the south side of Laurinburg. St. Andrews held an opening convocation and classes began on September 22, 1961 with 750 students. Unusual for its time, the campus was designed to be accessible and barrier-free to students with physical disabilities. Ten buildings had been completed by the opening of the college in 1961, including the Academic Building and the Vardell Building, Student Center, a maintenance building, and six residence halls named for presbyteries in the Synod of North Carolina. Enrollment grew to over 900 by 1970, and the college saw expansion of facilities and curriculum in its first ten years. Two additional men's dorms, the DeTamble Library, and the Physical Education Center were completed in the late 1960s, and the Morgan-Jones Science Center and Avinger Auditorium were completed in 1970. In its early years the college developed the Christianity and Culture Program, or \\"C&C;\\" for short. The program focused on interdisciplinary curriculum that provided freshman and sophomore level courses in ancient and modern civilization, junior level courses in non-Western cultures, and senior level courses in American studies. The program also included study abroad options in Israel, Greece and Rome. St. Andrews introduced Selected Topics in Modern Science, known as STMS, in 1969. First offered as a required freshman level two-term course in natural sciences, the STMS developed into a broad interdisciplinary program that connected various scientific disciplines to one another. The college began the St. Andrews Press in 1972. The college experienced a number of changes during the early 1970s. St. Andrews, along with many other colleges across the United States, experienced political and social unrest on campus stemming from the unpopular Vietnam War coupled with the rising cost of education, the economic recession, and the 1973 oil crisis. To combat financial struggles and decreased enrollment, St. Andrews replaced the Christianity and Culture Program with a new program known as the St. Andrews Studies Program (SAS). In the late 1970s, the Student Center was renovated and named the William Henry Belk College Center. The Katherine McKay Belk Tower was built on Chapel Island at the center of campus. St. Andrews renovated the Kings Mountain dormitory in 1978, renamed it Pate Hall, and made into a continuing education center to accommodate an expanding adult education program. In the early 1980s, St. Andrews redesigned its core programs, incorporating curriculum elements of the former C&C;, SAS, and STMS programs. The new St. Andrews General Education Program, called SAGE, focused on general education curriculum with interdisciplinary courses in humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. St. Andrews also expanded academic majors in the areas of mathematics, computer science, psychology, the natural sciences, and business administration. From 1978 until 1999, St. Andrews was the site of the Governor's School of North Carolina's East campus. = Recent history = In 1990, St. Andrews added a satellite program at Sandhills Community College in Pinehurst to meet additional demand for the college's adult education program. St. Andrews-at-Sandhills began offering junior and senior level courses in the evenings and on weekends. In 2007, St. Andrews added online programs designed to provide degree and certificate options. The college also consolidated the adult program, online program, and satellite program into the Center for Adult and Professional Studies (CAPS). In 2009 St. Andrews formally became a member of the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges Consortium (SOC) and received national recognition as a military-friendly institution. In July 2011, following accreditation issues, St. Andrews and Webber International University announced a merger of the two institutions. With the merger, St. Andrews became an additional instructional location of, and a branch of, Webber International. Webber is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award degrees at the associate, bachelor and master's levels. The merger combined Webber's focus on business programs, four MBA degrees and extensive online options with St. Andrews' focus on undergraduate liberal arts and science programs. In September 2011, the college's president, Paul Baldasare, Jr., class of 1977, announced the intention to change the name to \\"St. Andrews University\\" during the campus' Founders' Day celebration. Baldasare cited increased enrollment goals as well as plans to add graduate programs and expand online programs for adult learners as major reasons for the name change. Campus Lake scene, looking north The campus is located south of downtown Laurinburg, bounded on the west by U.S. Routes 15 and 401. There is a lake in the middle of campus. On the southern side of the campus is the Morgan-Jones Science Building, Avinger Auditorium, the Morgan Liberal Arts Building, the DeTamble Library, and the Vardell Building. There is a bridge from one side of the lake to an island to the other side of the lake. On the island is the campus bell tower. On the northern side of the campus is the Willam Henry Belk student center, where the Crossroads Cafeteria, student store, student mailboxes, and Office of Student Affairs are located. On the east side of this end of campus are four dorms, Concord, Granville, Wilmington, and Albemarle. On the west side are four more dorms, Winston-Salem, Pate, Mecklenburg, and Orange. Pate houses the Student Health & Wellness Center. Across from the Belk Center is the P.E. Building. On the far north end of campus, there are the athletic fields. The Equestrian Center is located off campus, approximately 2 miles south. The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Academics St. Andrews offers three bachelor's degrees: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Fine Arts. It was one of the first institutions to implement a B.F.A. program for Creative Writing. The student- faculty ratio is low, 12:1, resulting in small classes and a personalized education. St. Andrews offers non-traditional students the opportunity to pursue degrees in Business Administration, Equine Business Management, Elementary Education, Liberal Studies, and courses leading to teacher certification, in an online, traditional classroom or blended format. In the fall of 2008 the college organized its degree offerings at Sandhills Community College (St. Andrews @ Sandhills), its online program and its other opportunities for non-traditional learners, under the umbrella of the St. Andrews Center for Adult and Professional Studies. St. Andrews has charters with the following honor societies: Alpha Chi, Beta Beta Beta, Omicron Delta Epsilon, Pi Gamma Mu, Psi Chi, Sigma Tau Delta, Sigma Beta Delta, and the St. Andrews Honor Society. St. Andrews also offers an honors program, which selects incoming freshmen based on their high school GPA, SAT/ACT scores, and an interview with the director of the program. Accreditation In 1961, St. Andrews Presbyterian College was first accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC). In June 2007, SACSCOC voted to remove the college's accreditation \\"for failure to meet accreditation standards dealing with financial resources, stability, and control.\\" St. Andrews appealed the decision, but the commission's College Delegate Assembly upheld the decision to terminate accreditation. The college responded by filing a lawsuit against the association, but the judge granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, directed that judgment be entered in favor of the association, and dismissed the lawsuit filed by St. Andrews. In April 2011, Webber International University filed a substantive change form to add St. Andrews Presbyterian College as an additional instructional location, providing a merger for the two institutions. Following the filing, the accreditation of St. Andrews was extended through July 31, 2011 to allow for SACSCOC to render a decision on the application during the annual meeting. During the June 2011 SACSCOC meeting, the association approved the plan by Webber International University to add St. Andrews as an additional instructional location. This merger of Webber International University and St. Andrews resolved the accreditation concern with SACSCOC. In addition, the college is accredited by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education. The college is a member of North Carolina Independent Colleges and Universities, the Association of Presbyterian Colleges, the Council of Independent Colleges, and the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs. The college's women graduates qualify for membership in the American Association of University Women. Athletics St. Andrews' athletic teams are known as the Knights. The university offers 19 intercollegiate sports in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Appalachian Athletic Conference (AAC) starting in the 2012-13 academic year. St. Andrews was formerly a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division II level, primarily competing in Conference Carolinas from 1988 to 2012. The university transitioned to the NAIA after 23 years in the NCAA at the end of the 2011-12 academic year. =Men's sports= * Baseball * Basketball * Cross-country * Equestrian * Football * Golf * Lacrosse * Soccer * Swimming * Volleyball * Wrestling =Women's sports= * Basketball * Cross- country * Equestrian * Golf * Lacrosse * Soccer * Softball * Swimming * Volleyball In addition to the 19 NAIA sports, St. Andrews sponsors an extensive Equestrian program.
