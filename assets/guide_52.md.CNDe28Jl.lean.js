About 15% of all injuries in children are fracture injuries.Staheli, Lynn, Fundamentals of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 119. Bone fractures in children are different from adult bone fractures because a child's bones are still growing. Also, more consideration needs to be taken when a child fractures a bone since it will affect the child in his or her growth.Broken Bones in Children Information about fractures in young patients By Jonathan Cluett, M.D., About.com Updated: August 29, 2005 Retrieved Sep. 2008 On an everyday basis bones will support many kinds of forces naturally applied to them, but when the forces are too strong the bones will break. For example, when an adolescent jumps off of a trampoline and lands on his/her feet the bones and connective tissue in the adolescent's feet will usually absorb the force, flex, then return to their original shape. However, if the adolescent lands and the force is too strong, the bones and the connective tissue will not be able to support the force and will fracture.What Is a Bone Fracture and How Is it Treated? www.kidsgrowth.com. Oct. 24, 2008. Retrieved Oct. 2008 < http://www.kidsgrowth.com/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=1504>  Types of fractures  The bones of a child are more likely to bend than to break completely because they are softer and the periosteum is stronger and thicker. The fractures that are most common in children are the incomplete fractures; these fractures are the greenstick and torus or buckle fractures.  Greenstick fracture  This fracture involves a bend on one side of the bone and a partial fracture on the other side. The name is by analogy with green (i.e., fresh) wood which similarly breaks on the outside when bent. The Sub- nanostructure of cortical bone may provide one possible explanation for the greenstick fractures in children. On the contrary to adults bone tissue, the low ratio between the mature and the immature enzymatic cross-links in children bone tissue is a potential explanation of the presence of greenstick fractures in children.  Torus or buckle fracture  This fracture occurs at the metaphyseal locations and resemble the torus or base of a pillar in architectural terms. Acute angulation of the cortex is noted, as opposed to the usual curved surface. It is caused by impaction. They are usually the result of a force acting on the longitudinal axis of the bone: they are typically a consequence of a fall on an outstretched arm, so they mainly involve the distal radial metaphysis. The word torus is derived from the Latin word 'torus,' meaning swelling or protuberance. Bow fracture The bone becomes curved along its longitudinal axis.  Hairline fracture  An incomplete fracture (a thin crack in the bone that doesn't go all the way through the bone.)  Single fracture  The bone is fractured only in one place.  Segmental fracture  Fracture in two or more places in the same bone.  Comminuted fracture  The bone fractures in more than two places or is crushed into pieces.Broken Bones, kidshealth.org, Reviewed by: Peter G. Gabos, MD Date reviewed: April 2008.

Volume 4, Case 2. Rodney B. Boychuk, M.D. Kapiolani Medical Center For Women And Children. University of Hawaii. John A. Burns School of Medicine These types of fractures are characteristic of child abuse- related injuries.Page 82 in: Other ways to describe a fracture An illustration showing types of fracture.  Closed fracture  A fracture that doesn't penetrate the skin.  Open (compound) fracture  A fracture resulting in the ends of a bone penetrating the skin (these pose an increased risk of infection).  Non-displaced fracture  A fracture where the bone cracks completely and the pieces line up.  Displaced fracture  A fracture where the bone cracks completely in two or more pieces, and the pieces move out of alignment (this type of fracture might require surgery to make sure the pieces are aligned before casting).  Symptoms and signs  Even though symptoms vary widely after experiencing a bone fracture, the most common fracture symptoms include: * pain in the fractured area * swelling in the fractured area * obvious deformity in the fractured area * not being able to use or move the fractured area in a normal manner * bruising, warmth, or redness in the fractured area Cause  Children with a higher risk of a fracture   Low bone mineral content  Children with generalized disorders such as renal diseases, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, growth hormone deficiency, and osteogenesis imperfecta disorders are at risk.Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 274. Neuromuscular disorders: children with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and arthrogryposis, have a higher risk of a fracture because of the combination of joint stiffness and poor mineralization.  Fracture personality  Children in general are at greater risk because of their high activity levels. Children that have risk- prone behaviors are at even greater risk.  Child abuse  Over 2.5 million child abuse and neglect cases are reported every year, and thirty-five out of every hundred cases are physical abuse cases.Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 272. Bone fractures are sometimes part of the physical abuse of children; knowing the symptoms of bone fractures in physical abuse and recognizing the actual risks in physical abuse will help forward the prevention of future abuse and injuries. Astoundingly, these abuse fractures, if not dealt with correctly, have a potential to lead to the death of the child. Fracture patterns in abuse fractures that are very common with abuse are fractures in the growing part of a long bone (between the shaft and the separated part of the bone), fractures of the humeral shaft (long bone between the shoulder and elbow), ribs, scapula, outer end of the clavicle, and vertebra. Multiple fractures of varying age, bilateral fractures, and complex skull fractures are also linked to abuse. Fractures of varying ages occur in about thirteen percent of all cases. Pathophysiology  Differences between child and adult bones  An illustration showing the stages of healing of fractured bone. There are differences in the bone structure of a child and an adult. These differences are important for the correct evaluation and treatment of the fractures. A child's bones heal faster than an adult's because a thicker, stronger, and more active dense fibrous membrane (periosteum) covers the surface of their bones.Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics, p. 258. The periosteum has blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrition to the bone cells. The stronger and thicker periosteum in children causes a better supply of oxygen and nutrients to the bones,Hilt, Nancy E, Pediatric Orthopedic Nursing p. 12. and this helps in the remodeling of the fractured bones by supplying. The periosteum in children causes a more rapid union of fractured bones and an increased potential for remodeling. A child's fractures not only heal more quickly, but are significantly reduced due to the thickness and strength of a child's periosteum. But this thickness also has its drawbacks; when there is a small displacement in the periosteum the thickness and strength of it will make the fracture in the periosteum difficult to diagnose.  Growth plate  Growth plates are the areas in bones where the bones grow.Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 260. In children the growth plates are open, which helps to manage a child's fractures.  Age and sex related fractures  Bone fracture types differ depending on the age and sex of the child. The changes in the bones over time cause variance in the pattern and number of bone fracture injuries. The probability of bone fractures in children increases with age.Staheli, Lynn, Practice of Pediatric Orthopedics p. 257. For a small child, injuries will most likely be minimal because the child doesn't have the speed or mass to cause serious injuries. When age increases, so does mass and speed resulting in more serious fractures. The age when girls usually fracture a bone is twelve and for boys the age is fourteen. Also, girls statistically have fewer fractures than boys. About half of boys and one-fourth of girls are likely to have a fracture during childhood. The wrist is also the most likely part of the body to be injured. As sport activities increase, the fractures in children increase as well, especially for boys who participate in either wrestling or football. Much like bone types in the different stages of childhood are varying, so the bone fracture injuries in infants, children, and adolescents vary. Careful evaluation for the best treatment of each child is needed.  Treatment  When a child experiences a fracture, he or she will have pain and will not be able to easily move the fractured area. A doctor or emergency care should be contacted immediately. In some cases even though the child will not have pain and will still be able to move, medical help must be sought out immediately. To decrease the pain, bleeding, and movement a physician will put a splint on the fractured area. Treatment for a fracture follows a simple rule: the bones have to be aligned correctly and prevented from moving out of place until the bones are healed. The specific treatment applied depends on how severe the fracture is, if it's an open or closed fracture, and the specific bone involved in the fracture (a hip fracture is treated differently from a forearm fracture for example) Different treatments for different fractures: The general treatments for common fractures are as follows:  Cast immobilization  Because most fractures heal successfully after having been repositioned, a simple plaster or fiberglass cast is commonly used.  Functional cast or brace  A cast, or brace, that allows limited movement of the nearby joints is acceptable for some fractures.  Traction  This treatment consists of aligning a bone or bones by a gentle, steady pulling action. The pulling may be transmitted to the bone or bones by a metal pin through a bone or by skin tapes. This is a preliminary treatment used in preparation for other secondary treatments.  Open reduction and internal fixation  This treatment is only used when an orthopedic surgeon assigns it to restore the fractured bone to its original function. This method positions the bones to their exact location, but there is a risk for infection and other complications. The procedure involves the orthopedist performing surgery on the bone to align the bone fragments, followed by the placement of special screws or metal plates to the outer surface of the bone. The fragments can also be held together by running metal rods through the marrow in the center of the bone.  External fixation  This treatment also requires surgery by an orthopedist. Pins or screws are placed into the fractured bone above and below the fracture site. The orthopedic surgeon repositions the bone fragments and pins or screws are connected to a metal bar or bars outside the skin which holds the bones in their proper position so they can heal. The external fixation device is removed after an appropriate time period. Prognosis Fractures in children generally heal relatively fast, but may take several weeks to heal. Last Reviewed: October 2014 Most growth plate fractures heal without any lasting effects. Rarely, bridging bone may form across growth plates, causing stunted growth and/or curving. In such cases, the bridging bone may need to be surgically removed. A growth plate fracture may also stimulate growth, causing a longer bone than the corresponding bone on the other side. Therefore, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommends regular follow-up for at least a year after growth plate fractures.

Majnoon is one of the richest oil fields in the world with an estimated 38 billion barrels of oil in place. The field was named Majnoon which means crazy in Arabic in reference to excessive amount of oil in a dense area. History The field was discovered by Braspetro, a Brazilian company in 1975, under the leadership of Bolivar Montenegro Guerra in a shallow Upper Cretaceous formation. Development came to a halt in 1980 during the engineering phase of the project, due to Iran‚ÄìIraq War, particularly Operation Kheibar. At the time, Braspetro had finished drilling of 20 wells and pressed 14 drilling rigs into service. In the course of the war, Iran occupied and sabotaged the area. After the war, Southern Oil Company of Iraq restarted the production. In 1990's, Total S.A. of France negotiated a development contract with Saddam Hussein but was unable to sign the deal due to United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq. The deal was eventually annulled by Hussein in 2002. Due to 2003 Iraq War, production was reduced to . In 2007, Total and Chevron signed an agreement with Iraqi government to explore Majnoon field. On December 11, 2009, the Iraqi government awarded a license to a joint venture from Royal Dutch Shell and Petronas to take over operations at Majnoon Oilfield, and triple production from the estimated reserve of nearly at a fee rate of $1.39/barrel. The consortium was awarded the contract out of 44 international companies, participating in the auction, with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), ExxonMobil, Sinochem Corporation, Total specifically bidding on Majnoon field. The finalist alliance of CNPC and Total offering $1.75/barrel lost the bid. The deal intends a 20-year service and development of the field. The contract was approved by Council of Ministers of Iraq on January 5, 2010. Shell agreed at the end of 2017 to exit the venture and hand over its operation to Basra Oil Company (BOC) by the end of June 2018. Shell was the operator and holder of 45 percent at Majnoon, with Malaysia‚Äôs Petronas owning 30 percent, and Iraq‚Äôs Missan Oil Company holding the remaining 25 percent. In June 2018 officials from Shell and Basra Oil Company met to mark the handing over of the operations of the field. In April 2018, Anton Oilfield Services and Petrofac signed a two-year deal with Iraq‚Äôs oil ministry to operate the Majnoon field on behalf of Basra Oil Company. In May 2018, KBR, Inc. announced that it has been awarded a contract by Basra Oil Company (BOC) for the development of the Majnoon Oil Field in Basra, Iraq. Licences Until June 2018 (when Shell - the operator exited) Shell held a 45% stake in all licences, Petronas 30% and Iraqi Ministry of Oil 25%. Reservoir Majnoon's first pay zone consists of Upper Cretaceous which proved of oil per day. Mishrif carbonates, Nahr Umr sands (Middle Cretaceous) and Shuaiba carbonates and Zubair sands (Lower Cretaceous) form the pay zones. Production According to the deal, the consortium will increase production to a peak of oil per day within seven-year period. Majnoon was the first Iraqi field out of 10 major ones offered to international companies for development. The contract with Shell and Petronas includes drilling over 40 production wells, construction of three gas separation stations and two crude oil processing refineries with overall capacity of . The official start date was March 1, 2010. In the Phase I of the project, the consortium intends to increase the production from 45,000 to within two-year period. The production at Majnoon will move Iraq from the current 11th place to the 3rd among oil producing nations after Saudi Arabia and Iran. The country sits on 150 billion of oil and currently produces . Iraq expects to top the oil production to within six years, thus competing with Saudi Arabia.

Five years later the community was described as a thriving village. In 1890 the population was estimated at twenty, and Jeddo had one general store. The next year the settlement had two schools, one with thirty black students and the other with twenty-nine white students. Population estimates took an unexplained rise later in the decade, with 560 reported in 1896 and 559 in 1904. But the community quickly faded to a population of twelve in 1914, then dropped from population lists until about 1933, when ten people and two businesses were reported. In 1919 area residents voted for a school tax and had a school building erected. In 1930 the eight- grade school had two teachers and thirty pupils. The post office closed in 1927.

Some people say these lights are a normal phenomenon called \\"Wildfire\\", which normally appears at swamps and wet places. Skeptic Karen Stollznow investigated the cemetery, and wrote that there were several possible natural explanations for the colored lights, such as a receptor on the retina of the eye sensitive to the color blue, or the effect of phosphenes, brief flashes of light perceived by the eye, sometimes induced by eye movements, \\"which would also explain the lights ‚Äúdancing‚Äù, ‚Äúfloating‚Äù or ‚Äúdarting‚Äù across the cemetery.\\" Stollznow reports that not all visitors see the lights, supporting her conclusion that \\"seeing lights during darkness in Silver Cliff Cemetery is a personal experience, likely caused by a person‚Äôs eyes and mind after they have spent many hours determined to ‚Äúsee‚Äù something.\\" References External links * Category:Cemeteries in Colorado Category:Atmospheric ghost lights Category:History of Colorado Category:Protected areas of Custer County, Colorado ","title":"Silver Cliff Cemetery"},{"id":"24358532","text":"Flutter is a 2006 Canadian anime-style animated short by Howie Shia, co- produced by PPF House and the National Film Board of Canada. Awards Flutter received the Open Entries Grand Prize at the Tokyo Anime Awards ‚Äî the first work from outside Asia to win this award. Flutter also received the award for best Quebec short feature at the Fantasia Festival and a Jury Award from the Golden Sheaf Awards. Plot A quiet film without color, a boy and a girl must abandon their friendship to pursue their dreams. In this short animation, a young boy takes a flying leap away from normal, waves goodbye to his classmates, and disappears into the cityscape and beyond. At the same time, a young girl is inspired to reinvent her space with art. Production Shia, who grew up in Saskatchewan, was in Montreal when he was approached by NFB producer Michael Fukushima and asked if he had any ideas he wanted to present. He offered a few ideas before remembering some earlier art work he had done of a \\"kid with wings on his feet\\" while working with the NFB on his first project, a 30-second short Ice Ages. This artwork became the inspiration for Flutter. Flutter is animated in black and white. It took Shia and his team 10 months to complete and was animated using Photoshop, which the filmmaker used because of his unfamiliarity with animation software at the time, and because he wanted the film to \\"look as hand-drawn and gritty as possible.\\" Several people who had grown up with Shia in Saskatoon worked on Flutter, including his brothers Leo and Tim, who played music for the film, and friends Kelly Sommerfield (background art) and Ryan Patterson (sound engineering).

History The Star Film logo (at left) on the set of M√©li√®s's film The Man with the Rubber Head On 28 December 1895, M√©li√®s attended the celebrated first public demonstration of the Lumi√®re Brothers' Cinematograph. The event, held in a room at 14 Boulevard des Capucines in Paris with one hundred chairs and an entry price of 1, demonstrated the practicality of film cameras and projectors. According to later recollections by M√©li√®s, he immediately approached Antoine Lumi√®re and offered to buy a Lumi√®re projector for his own experimentation; Lumi√®re refused. M√©li√®s went on to make repeated offers, all similarly turned down. M√©li√®s next turned to the British film experimenter Robert W. Paul, and in February 1896, obtained an Animatographe projector for 1,000, along with a collection of short films, some by Paul and some by Edison Studios. M√©li√®s projected these for the first time at his theater of illusions, the Th√©√¢tre Robert-Houdin, in April 1896. The Star Film trademark on a title card for The Impossible Voyage Meanwhile, having studied the principles on which Paul's projector ran, M√©li√®s designed a makeshift camera. With the help of a mechanic, Lucien Korsten, he built it in the workshop of the theater, using parts recycled from machines used in his illusions. On 2 September 1896, M√©li√®s, Korsten, and an associate, Lucien Reulos, obtained a patent on their work, christened the Kin√©tograph, and on 2 December M√©li√®s created the Star Film trademark, with the slogan \\"The Whole World Within Reach.\\" American branch The American branch of the company was managed by M√©li√®s' older brother Gaston M√©li√®s and produced films in New York City, San Antonio, Texas and Santa Paula, California. Its most significant film was The Immortal Alamo (1911). History Georges M√©li√®s had produced films in France, which had become popular around the world. Some distributors began infringing M√©li√®s' work, especially in the United States. M√©li√®s asked his brother Gaston to go to the United States and guard M√©li√®s copyrights. Gaston arrived in New York City in 1902 and began distributing his brother's films. By 1903, Gaston began making films himself, mostly documentaries. The films were not successful. The company moved to San Antonio looking for warmer winters and leased twenty acres including a two-story house and large barn that became the \\"Star Film Ranch\\" movie studio. Star Film Company was the earliest non-Texas production company to operate in Texas. The studio had actors Edith Storey, Francis Ford, and William Clifford under contract along with writer Anne Nichols. The studio also hired local ranchers and cowboys to give its Westerns genuine character. The films were normally one reel in length with an average running time of fifteen minutes. Of the seventy films made in San Antonio, only three are known to have survived. The Star Film Company moved to California in April 1911. Gaston originally planned to relocate to Santa Barbara but chose Santa Paula instead, perhaps because the scenery was better, or perhaps because it was less expensive. In Santa Paula, he built stages across from a resort called Sulphur Mountain Springs, where the troupe rented rooms. Financially, things started going wrong for Gaston. His popular stars, Edith Storey and William Clifford moved to other companies. His California films were not as profitable as the Texas films had been. In November 1911, Gaston met with Vitagraph Studios in New York and sold fifty percent of his company, including his brothers negatives and distribution rights. On July 24, 1912 Gaston, his wife and a crew of fourteen left for a Pacific and Asian voyage to make movies in exotic locales. Documentaries and dramas were filmed at various locations such as Tahiti, Bora Bora, New Zealand, Rarotonga, Australia, Java, Cambodia, Japan, and others. The footage was sent to New York for processing, but much of the footage arrived damaged because of the harsh conditions in which the negatives were shot or mishandling in transit. What was released met with an unappreciative audience and bad reviews in the trade press. Gaston stopped the tour in 1913 and settled in Corsica, where he died two years later. Gaston's son Paul sold what was left of the company to General Film Company in 1917. It was believed that \\"bad blood\\" developed between the M√©li√®s brothers, but recent research indicates that despite losses in the American branch, Georges received all payments he was entitled to.

Life He was educated at the Albany Academy, the Fessenden School, Boston University and the University of Paris. ;Career Ackerman began his career with the Albany, N.Y. Times-Union, but has lived and worked for most of his life in Europe, where he has reported and written for major American print and broadcast media, notably Time, Life, Sports Illustrated, and Newsweek magazines, CBS News, ABC News and UPI. He was Chief Paris Correspondent for the Westinghouse Broadcasting Corporation before joining the Paris Bureau of Time-Life as a correspondent and writer, in 1959. He reported throughout Europe and Africa for all of the Time Inc. publications, as well as for Paris-Match, a leading weekly French magazine. He was, briefly, an editor at People magazine in New York. Ackerman reported major news events in Europe and North Africa in the 1950s and ‚Äò60s. He was the first American newsman to arrive in Agadir, Morocco, on February 29, 1960, following the earthquake in which 30,000 people were killed and injured, and he witnessed the street battles between French infantrymen and civilians in Algiers in 1961 that heralded the end of the Franco-Algerian War. In the late 1980s, Ackerman carried out reporting assignments in Eastern Europe for Pierre Salinger, European News Director of ABC News and former press secretary to President John F. Kennedy. In 1989, on assignment for Salinger, Ackerman entered the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany) posing as a university professor. Arrested by the East German secret police, the Stasi, Ackerman was released after convincing the police that he was a close friend of East German chief of state Erich Honecker. He continued reporting, and clandestinely filmed massive public demonstrations in Leipzig and Berlin that preceded the collapse of the Communist government and the fall of the Berlin Wall. The films, as well as the motorcyclist Ackerman hired to smuggle them out of the country, were intercepted and seized, probably by the Stasi, before reaching West Berlin. On the night of November 9, 1989, with East Germany falling rapidly into anarchy, Ackerman and another correspondent became the first newsmen to reach the Brandenburg Gate as jubilant crowds of West and East Germans ripped down the first sections of the Wall and tearfully embraced.

Skirting the watchful eye of Ernesto, Abuela performs a burial ceremony to save the soul of four-year-old Mister. After this rebirth, Mister lives in Abuela‚Äôs adobe house beside Milagro Creek, just across the bridge from the hard-drinking Mondragon family. When Mister and his best friend Tomas Mondragon are teenagers, they both fall in love with the pretty and precocious gringo, Rocky O‚ÄôBrien.

Biography Gammon was born in Hounslow, the son of Philip Gammon, a grocer. World War I He enlisted into the army at Hampton Court in 1914 or 1915 and served on the Western Front until invalided out after suffering from trench foot. He volunteered to transfer to the Royal Flying Corps as a cadet, and was commissioned as a probationary temporary second lieutenant on 29 August 1917, being confirmed in his rank and appointed a flying officer on 8 February 1918. Gammon was assigned to No. 104 Squadron, part of the Independent Air Force, flying the Airco DH.9 light bomber, with Second Lieutenant Percival Appleby as his observer/gunner. He was appointed a temporary captain on 27 June 1918. Gammon and Appleby gained their first victory on 1 July 1918 destroying an Albatros D.V over Metz. A month later, on 1 August, they accounted for a Pfalz D.III at Boulay airfield. On 7 September Gammon was the commander of ten aircraft (two flights) from No. 104 Squadron which, with eleven aircraft from No. 99 Squadron, mounted a daylight air raid on the Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik chemical works at Mannheim. The British force, under the overall command of Major Lawrence Pattinson of No. 99 Squadron, were attacked by numbers of enemy aircraft on the outward flight, while over the target, and on their return. However, they successfully dropped over two tons of bombs on the target, and also shot down six enemy aircraft, two of which were credited to Gammon and Appleby. As a result of this raid Gammon and Appleby were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Their citation read: :Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) Richard John Gammon. :Second Lieutenant Percival Ewart Appleby. ::Captain Gammon, with 2nd Lt. Appleby as Observer, was the leader of two formations (ten machines in all) on a recent raid. En route the formation was attacked by fifteen hostile aircraft: having driven these off, they reached the objective, which was successfully bombed. While thus engaged the formation was fiercely attacked by fifteen enemy machines, which continued the attack for some distance on the return journey, until they were driven off. Upon nearing our lines the formation was again assailed by seven machines; in the engagement that ensued one of these was destroyed and two driven down by Captain Gammon and his Observer, and, in addition, three others were destroyed by our other machines. The officer who led the whole of the combined formations of this raid speaks in the highest terms of Captain Gammon's leadership and skilful co-operation. 2nd Lt. Appleby was of the greatest assistance to Captain Gammon throughout, keeping him informed of the movements and manoeuvres of the hostile machines. This officer has taken part in numerous raids, displaying on all occasions great keenness and determination. Their fifth and final victory came two weeks later, on 15 September, destroying another Pfalz D.III over Verny. Gammon finally left the Royal Air Force after the end of the war, being transferred to unemployed list on 9 September 1919. World War II Gammon returned to service in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve during World War II, being commissioned as a pilot officer \\"for the duration of hostilities\\", on 8 January 1940. He was promoted to the war substantive rank of flying officer, and then to flight lieutenant, in early 1941, and to squadron leader on 20 April 1943. Gammon remained in the RAF Reserve after the war, until finally relinquishing his commission on 10 August 1954, being permitted to retain the rank of wing commander.

Nikaia (, ) was a settlement of the koinon of the Bylliones, an Illyrian tribe that through contact with their Greek neighbours became bilingual.The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 6: The Fourth Century BC by D. M. Lewis (Editor), John Boardman (Editor), Simon Hornblower (Editor), M. Ostwald (Editor), , 1994, page 423, \\"Through contact with their Greek neighbors some Illyrian tribe became bilingual (Strabo Vii.7.8.Diglottoi) in particular the Bylliones and the Taulantian tribes close to Epidamnus...\\" The tribe was found in southern Illyria (today's Fier District, southern Albania)... History The name of the settlement is of Greek etymology. Sources from the classical era point to a location in the vicinity of Byllis. It has been identified c. 1,500 meters south of Byllis in the modern settlement of Klos, near Fier. Archaeologist Neritan Ceka led the expedition. Its size, organization and administrative relation to Byllis are debated. It was too large to be a kome and had walled fortifications in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Stephanus of Byzantium is the only primary source who calls it a polis. The city plan resembles that of the Greek city of Amantia. After its foundation Byllis went into decline, however it was not completely abandoned. Papazoglou and Hammond also stressed that the development of Nikaia as a city wasn't part of the beginning of the development of an \\"Illyrian city\\" system. Rather, Nikaia like other settlements in southern Illyria (Byllis, Amantia, Lissus etc.) represents the adoption of the Greek city model by the 4th century BC or later in an indigenous settlement. Papazoglou states that Nikaia together with nearby Byllis were \\"Greek foundations on barbarian territory\\". Organisation and Onomastics Inscriptions at both Byllis and Nikaia begin in the middle of the 4th century BC and are related to a polis-like organization. They are exclusively in Greek, as are institutions, the gods worshiped, the titles of the officials and other parts of the organization of the settlement. Those inscriptions are written in fluent Greek and reveal typical features of the north-western Greek dialect. The Gods worshipped in Nikaia as well Byllis, are the typical deities of the Greek Pantheon: Zeus Tropaios, Hera Teleia, Poseidon, Parthenos etc.. The vast majority of the corpus of names is Greek (Alexander, Andriscus, Archelaus, Kebbas, Maketa, Machatas, Nikanor, Peukolaos, Phalakros, Philotas, Drimakos and Alexommas) with a few Illyrian names. The latter exceptions can't challenge the initial Greek character of the local element. A 2nd-century BC inscription in a festival in Boetia, mentions an Illyrian contestant, Byllion from Nikaia (ŒíœÖŒªŒªŒØœâŒΩ Œ±œÄŒø ŒùŒØŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒ±œÇ). This inscription indicates that the city was a member of the Koinon of the Bylliones. The political institutions were typical of the Greek polis though it is difficult to define their precise content. A Hellenistic inscription records a strategos eponymos () a general of the Koinon of the Bylliones. The term Koinon did not necessarilyPleket, H. W. Supplementum Epigraphicum Graecum, Volume XXXIX: 1989. refer to an ethnos. As a term it was also used to refer to a coalition of settlements, in this case: Byllis and Nikaia to which it was restricted.Robert, L. \\"Discours inaugaural\\", L' Illyrie meridionale et L'Epire dans l'antiquite, Actes du colloque international de Clermont-Ferrand.

Author Taylor is the author of the book Bless Them Father, for They Have Sinned, which was published in the summer of 2012. As a child, Taylor experienced something so traumatic that her brain forced her to forget the events for more than 40 years. That event was clergy sexual abuse at the hands of member of the Catholic clergy. Her story is an honest, brave, heartbreaking, and hopeful look at her journey to explore and overcome the sexual abuse. She gives her excruciating account of discovery, as she copes with repressed memories which surfaced with unexpected, and unwelcome, flashbacks of sexual abuse. That abuse began in 1958, when she was a 5-year-old student. She writes as a journalist, in factual tones, as she and her therapist chart a course to move from confusion and despair to understanding and promise.

The marshes are fed by two branches of the Tigris River (the Al- Musharrah and Al-Kahla) in Iraq and Karkheh River in Iran. The Hawizeh marsh is critical to the survival of the Central and Hammar marshes, which also make up the Mesopotamian Marshes, because they are a refuge for species that may recolonize or reproduce in the other marshlands. The Hawizeh Marshes are drained by the Al-Kassarah. This river plays a critical role in maintaining the marshes as a flow-through system and preventing it from becoming a closed saline basin. The Hawizeh Marshes have been populated for more than 5,000 years. The Hawizeh Marshes are by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present- day Iraq and the Karkhen River in present-day Iran. The Marsh Arabs live in Iraq and Hawizeh people live in Iran. From the time of the Sumerians and Babylonians the people used the marshes as a place to live. In the south west of Iran and the south east of Iraq, the Hawizeh and Hammar Marshes are made up of many smalls cities. These cities in the marshes are part of both countries with no border that separates them. So the people can move between Iraq marshes and Iran by the small boats. The city of Marshes were built on water. The people who live there have very simple lives. They make their houses of the reeds of the water without, electricity or cars and they don‚Äôt have an education they have just simple lives. The population depends on nature. They fish, hunt, cultivate and breed buffalo. The people use small boats called Al- Mshhove to move. The area where the fresh waters gets to the marshes is far away from the cities. The marshes make a safe home for thousands of migrant animals and birds like ‚Äúwild squirrels, white eagle, hawks, brown dukes and squirrels every year. So it is a safe home to a lot different kinds of migrant animals who come to raise their young there.Morrison, John. ‚ÄúTigris-Euphrates alluvial Salt marsh. Worldwildilife. World wildlife. N.d.Web.30 Apr. 2015. The marshes started a long time ago. Around 5,000 years ago, the marshes started by the great rivers Tigris and Euphrates by collision impact. These rivers flooded the land to create the marshes and started a new ecosystem with new animals, birds, fish and plants. That made a great change in that time to original Sumerians and Babylonians who lived there. They lived off the marshes by fishing, hunting and planting. The people came to live in the marshes also, but time changed some of the people‚Äôs ideas and beliefs. With the break between the Shia and Mandaean forms of religion, the Shia Muslims came to dominate in the marshes. Some ideas of the original people changed because of this religion and the other ideas remained from the Sumerians. These ideas include fantastic stories about ghosts, curses and extraterrestrials. In 1990-1992 when the Iraq government decided to dry the marshes because they thought an armed group lived there, the population left.

The State Stud of Celle, located in what is now known as Lower Saxony, was founded in 1735 by order of George II, King of Great Britain, Elector of Hanover and Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Its purpose was to make high-quality stallions available to local breeders. Several wars affected not only the safety of the horses, but the types of stallions housed there. Celle's history is intertwined with the history of the Hanoverian horse breed, but the breed registry is privately owned and is an entity independent of the stud. Today the state stud is known for its annual stallion parades. George II of Great Britain established the State Stud at Celle by royal decree. History The Lower Saxony State Stud of Celle was founded on July 27, 1735. Celle's foundation is unique among the state studs of Germany, because it was not originally based on a royal stud or courtly stables. It was established by the decree of King George II of Great Britain, also the Elector of Hanover and Duke of Braunschweig-L√ºneburg. Although it was established by this royal decree, the stud has always been \\"exclusively for the improvement of horse breeding for farmers.\\" The quality of local stock had a direct impact on the safety of a sovereign region. In times of war, cavalry horses were recruited locally from farmers, and the quality of remounts affected the outcomes of battles. Furthermore, nobles wanted quality riding horses for personal use and harness horses for carriage transport. Poor quality local stock meant that nobles had to rely on importation for quality horses. Establishment of a state stud meant that fine riding and driving horses could be purchased locally, reducing trade dependence on other autonomous regions. The first sires to stand there were 12 black Holsteiners. Young stallions were generally imported from Mecklenburg and England. Despite the close connection between Hanover and Great Britain, Thoroughbred horses could not play a role in the founding of the stud, as the breed was in its infancy in Celle's own early years. Pedigrees were recorded in Celle's studbooks as early as the end of the 18th century. Napoleonic wars The Napoleonic Wars, from 1803 to 1815, decimated horse populations, including those at the State Stud of Celle. In 1803, the 100 stallions living at Celle had to be evacuated to Mecklenburg, of which only 30 returned. While the war was responsible for the loss of many horses, horse breeding expanded to meet the needs of the cavalries, such that the population of stallions at Celle had returned to pre-war numbers within 15 years. In the aftermath of the wars, King George IV assisted in the repopulation of the State Stud of Celle with about 50 of his own stallions. These stallions, which came from his private stables, were stationed in various parts of his kingdom and utilized by locals. In 1829, King George IV discontinued this practice, and purchased 26 excellent stallions for Celle. Alnok, a Celle stallion born in 1888, was sired by the Thoroughbred Adeptus. The tails of carriage horses and non-Thoroughbreds were historically docked. Adeptus is represented by male line descendants like E.T. FRH and Eiger. Thoroughbred influence The pedigrees of Thoroughbreds were first organized on a large scale by the General Stud Book in 1791, effectively creating the original breed registry for Thoroughbreds. Within fifty years, the rising prominence of the breed and the personal union between Hannover and Great Britain saw an influx of Thoroughbred and part-Thoroughbred stallions. Further use of Thoroughbred stallions is credited to the state equerries of the mid-19th century. The state equerry is a government position which oversees activities related to the horses of a region. From 1866, the state equerries of Hannover were two brothers, August and Frederick von Sp√∂rken, who imported over 100 Thoroughbred-influenced stallions from England. These stallions were used to breed larger, more refined, more energetic and enduring mounts. Ultimately, nearly a third of the sires at Celle were Thoroughbred or of Thoroughbred extraction. This demographic resulted in horses that were too physically and temperamentally refined for farm work, and a period of consolidation followed this explosion of Thoroughbred influence. World Wars I and II World War I raged between 1914 and 1918. During this period, warring nations avidly developed new advantages in the form of mechanized warfare. Simultaneously, demand for cavalry horses during the war itself was high, and Celle helped meet this demand by increasing the number of stallions available at the main stud and its outposts from 350 to 500 by 1924. The prestige associated with the cavalry made many nations slow to replace them, but the role of the horse in warfare dwindled steadily with the advent of tanks. Without the armed forces to purchase their stock, breeders around Celle began to cut back, and then to refocus. Between the First and Second World Wars, horses primarily fulfilled agricultural roles, such as pulling plows and farm machinery. This market change was not limited to any one part of Germany, and as a result, Celle supplied breeders with heavier, stronger stallions with which to breed their mares. To cope with the expansion of horse breeding during this period, new outposts of the State Stud were established. This change did not endure, as another bout of human ingenuity was spurred on by World War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945. One of the outcomes of the war was mechanized agriculture. In particular, widespread access to tractors all but eliminated the need for farm horses. Mechanization of transportation, warfare, and agriculture eliminated, in succession, the working horse. What remained in the wake of World War II was riding for fun. The Pomeranian-bred Jellachich stood at Celle from 1850 until his death in 1866. Celle frequently purchased stallions from Mecklenburg and Vorpommern throughout much of the stud's history. Modern Celle In 1945, what remained of the refined Trakehners evacuated East Prussia, fleeing from Russian troops. Some of these elegant horses made their way to Celle, and as breeding aim changed to feature the riding horse, many were incorporated into the stud farm. Since 1945, many Thoroughbreds and Trakehners, and some Anglo-Arabians, have occupied stalls at the State Stud at Celle. Today, 140 stallions including 10 Thoroughbreds, 2 Anglo-Arabians, 2 Trakehners, and 3 ponies serve approximately 8000 broodmares per year. Since the 1980s, private stallion ownership in Hannover has steadily increased, however over 60% of Hanoverian mares are still served by the state- owned stallions of Celle. Stallion Parade This exhibition of black and dark bay stallions is part of the annual Celle Stallion Parade. On the last two weekends in September and the first weekend in October, the State Stud of Celle puts on a stallion parade or hengstparade. The parades are a major tourist attraction every year. The tradition of exhibiting all the state-owned sires to the public began in 1908. Stallions perform in a variety of acts, some showcasing their performance capabilities in dressage or show jumping demonstrations, while others are shown in-harness. Highly coordinated, color- matched drill teams are perennial favorites. The parade is an opportunity for the stud to showcase the less competitive talents of the stallions, as well. Stallions may be driven in groups of up to thirteen at a time, or in trick- riding formations called \\"Roman riding.\\" For many years, the solid black Escudo II performed tricks on cue with a handler, without a saddle or a bridle. Affiliations In order to make state-owned stallions available to residents outside of Celle itself, stallions stood at a number of stallion depots, which were scattered throughout Lower Saxony. Today, such regional breeding centers are located in Aurich, Dorum, Landesbr√ºck, Oberndorf, Bargstedt, Roydorf, Verden, Ankum, S√ºstedt, and Adelheidsdorf. Each of these regional centers administers subordinate stallion depots. In 1800, there were no fewer than 50 service stations, all told. Other stud farms have also played roles in Celle's history. In 1824, the Braunschweig State Stud of Bad Harzburg-B√ºndheim was founded. Along with the State Stud at Osnabr√ºck- Eversburg founded in 1925, the Braunschweig State Stud was dissolved in 1961. The stallions stationed at these studs were relocated to Celle. Some state-run horse facilities, while connected with Celle, do not stand stallions. A facility at Hunnesr√ºck at Solling is devoted to the rearing of up to 40 young stallions of each vintage, preparing them for licensing. Modern-day Celle has a close affiliation with the Hannover University of Veterinary Medicine. This link has made Hanoverian stallions frequent subjects and beneficiaries of research into equine artificial insemination, embryo transfer, and fertility. Adelheidsdorf Perhaps the best-known of Celle's outposts is the Stallion Performance Test Center at Adelheidsdorf. Young stallions which have been licensed by the Hanoverian stallion commission based on their conformation, movement and jumping prowess, attend a rigorous ridden performance test to achieve lifetime approval. A certain number of the young Hanoverian stallions are candidates to stand at Celle, pending their completion of the 11-month performance test at Adelheidsdorf. Today, most performance tests for warmblood stallions are 30 days or 70 days long; Adelheidsdorf's nearly year-long examination is exceptional. The first stallion performance test by Celle was in 1927. Over the years, the demands of the stallion test have been changed to reflect the needs of the breeders, whether the market required a versatile driving and cavalry horse, a farm horse, or a riding horse. Today, shorter tests for ponies, draft horses, and specialty breeds such as Fjord horses are also held at Adelheidsdorf. Licensing, a process by which a panel of experts determines whether a young stallion is suitable for breeding, began in association with the State Stud at Celle in the mid-19th century. Locals complained that there were many privately owned stallions of poor quality offered at stud in the Kingdom of Hannover. In 1844, under Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, an ordinance made it illegal to accept money for stud services of a privately owned stallions without the stallion being inspected and issued a license by a royal committee, the K√∂rkommission. The original k√∂rkommission was composed of two to three landowners, a cavalry officer, and a veterinarian. This process had the desired effect of eliminating major heritable defects, and helped Celle remain the most prominent source of breeding stallions. Herrenhausen Herrenhausen was a royal property, used as a summer house, which bred its own strains of well-known horses for ceremonial use. Cream-colored carriage horses, possibly of Persian extraction, with the distinct Baroque type fashionable for the time, had been bred at Herrenhausen well before George II of Great Britain first brought them to England. Napoleon stole a number of the Hanoverian creams, and used them to pull his carriage at his coronation. The Hanoverian creams, and a strain of white horses, were sold after Herrenhausen's breeding activities were dissolved in the 1920s. Important sires Celle has stood a number of important sires, including many founders of the Hanoverian breed, including Zernebog (sometimes written Zerneborg or Zemeboq). Zernebog was born in 1845 in Pomerania, with a Thoroughbred sire ‚Äì Jupiter xx ‚Äì and damsire. He stood at Celle from 1848 until his death in 1871. Today he is represented by a male family so large that it had to be split in two: the F-line and the W-line. These families are represented in dressage by Olympic medalists including Wansuela Suerte, Weltall, Farbenfroh, Woycek, and in the dressage breeding legacy of Weltmeyer. Another Pomeranian stallion, Jellachich, stood at Celle from 1850 to 1866. While he is not represented by modern male descendants, his daughter produced, by Zernebog, the stallion Fling, who propagated the F and W lineages. Similarly, the bay Mecklenburger Norfolk, who stood at Celle from 1849 to 1871, is counted among the foundation sires of the Hanoverian horse because of his contribution through his daughters rather than his sons. Zernebog (1845‚Äì1871) was a foundation stallion for the Hanoverian breed, and his descendants in the male line make up the F and W families. He was born in Mecklenburg and was purchased by Celle. Apart from Zernebog, several early Thoroughbred stallions who founded lasting dynasties in the Hanoverian genepool were selected to stand at the State Stud of Celle. The earliest, a chestnut sired by Adonis xx, was Adeptus xx, who served mares at Celle and its outposts from 1884 to 1904. Adeptus's descendants through the male line were named, according to custom, with the initial letter \\"A\\" for several generations, and was then switched to \\"E.\\" His modern-day descendants include Eiger, 1996 Hanoverian Stallion of the Year. Eiger himself is the sire of Espri, sire of the recently cloned show jumping champion E.T. FRH, and of Escudo I and Escudo II, who are known for versatile, conformationally-correct offspring. In the wake of Adeptus xx, during a period in which Celle relied heavily on Thoroughbreds, came Devil's Own xx. Devil's Own was foaled in 1887, and stood at Celle from 1894 until 1906. His descendants include the Olympic jumper Deister and the all-important Donnerhall. Another descendant, Duellant, founded important sire lines outside of Hannover. Finally, there was Goldschaum xx born in 1891, whose descendant Goldfisch II has survived in the male line to modern day. The important sires in this family include Grande, Gotthard, and Grannus, himself a descendant of Grande. These stallions have all had unusual starts to their careers: Gotthard, and his offspring, are notoriously slow to mature, and he was nearly passed over for his ugly- duckling appearance. Grannus, fiery and magnetic, was written off by some breeders because of his petite offspring. It wasn't until his children started jumping the highest jumps the world had to offer that his true talent showed. Olympians from this line include dressage stars like Isabel Werth's Gigolo, Graf George in the United States, show jumpers like Graf Grande, Genius, and Goldfever. Stallions of note from the 20th and 21st century that called Celle home have included the Trakehners Absatz, Lateran, and Semper Idem; Thoroughbreds Der L√∂we xx, Pik As xx, Black Sky xx, Lauries Crusader xx, and Prince Thatch xx; the Anglo-Arabian Matcho X; and the Hanoverians Espri, Escudo I and II, Weltmeyer and Wolkentanz.

Early life Jan Kemp was born in the present Amersfoort district, Transvaal on 10 June 1872, the younger son of Jurie Johannes Kemp and Maria Aletta Greyling. His maternal grandfather, Abraham Carel Greyling, a stepson of the Voortrekker leader, Piet Retief, was killed with Retief in 1838. His paternal grandfather, Petrus Johannes Kemp, emigrated from Belgium between 1830 and 1840. He was educated at the Staatsgymnasium (State Gymnasium) in Pretoria. He became a clerk in the Transvaal department of education in 1889. He soon transferred to the mining commissioner's office in Krugersdorp and achieved the position of chief clerk by 1899. Military career He served in the Magato War, against the Basuto chief, in 1895 and helped to suppress the Jameson Raid. At the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War he joined the Krugersdorp Commando. As a burgher, he participated in many of the early engagements in Natal. In November 1899, he was elected assistant field-cornet. On 27 February 1900 he distinguished himself at the Battle of Pietershoogte (also known as Spoorwegkop/Railway Hill) despite the Boer forces having to withdraw and the British forces taking the position. In June 1900, while serving under General Christian Frederick Beyers in the northern Transvaal he was elected a commandant. On 13 December 1900, at the Battle of Nooitgedacht, where he commanded one of the Boer commandos, he was wounded in the arm. In February 1901 he was promoted to combat general and instructed to make contact with General Koos de la Rey in the western Transvaal. It had been intended that Kemp should invade the Cape Colony. This plan was abandoned and he became one of De la Rey's ablest and most daring officers, showing his tactical acumen particularly in the actions at Vlakfontein (29‚Äì30 May 1901), Moedwil (30 September 1901) and Battle of Ysterspruit, near Klerksdorp in the Western Transvaal on 25 February 1902. His suggestion (September 1901) that a military government should supplant the civil government of the Transvaal republic, was vetoed by De la Rey. In the Battle of Tweebos on 7 March 1902, where his horse was shot under him, he played a prominent part in capturing Lord Methuen's column. On 11 April 1902, at Roodewal, in one of the last important actions of the war, Kemp launched a recklessly brave attack in De la Rey's absence, on Major-General RG Kekewich's forces, once again using a mounted charge over open terrain, which had become his characteristic mode of attack. Representing the Krugersdorp commando at the peace negotiations at Vereeniging, he urged the continuation of the war and was one of the minority of six who voted against the peace terms. Personal life On 10 June 1903 he married Anna Emma Bodenstein, the daughter of a former landdrost of Krugersdorp, JC Bodenstein and his wife, MC Combrink. They had two daughters and a son. His wife died in March 1941 and his already failing health deteriorated rapidly. Despite this he remained active in parliament. He published two volumes of memoirs, the first, published in 1941, dealt with events before 1902 and the second, published in 1942, covered the subsequent period. His physical and moral courage cannot be doubted. He was determined, direct, forceful, impetuous in the field and in politics and, above all, a fervent believer in the republican form of government for South Africa. He died at Piet Retief, Transvaal, on 31 December 1946. Legacy *The town of Jan Kempdorp in the Northern Cape Province is named after Kemp. *When, as Minister of Lands, Kemp, was asked in 1936 to set aside a special reserve for the endangered Cape mountain zebra, he gave his now infamous reply: \\"No! They're just a lot of donkeys in football jerseys.\\" Fortunately for the species, he was persuaded otherwise, and the Mountain Zebra National Park at Cradock, Eastern Cape was established in 1938.IOL: Environment * A Union Defence Force era regiment on the east rand was named in his honour.

Early life  Seineld√≠n was born in Concepci√≥n del Uruguay into a Lebanese Argentine family. He converted from Druzism to Roman Catholicism during his youth, and was consecrated to the Virgin of the Rosary (Virgen del Rosario). He remained a devout Roman Catholic throughout his life, even devoting his men in the army to the Virgin of the Holy Rosary as well.

The Carapintadas demanded that the Argentine government halt legal proceedings against army officers accused of human rights abuses during the Dirty War, which occurred during Argentina's military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983. The low-ranking officers were charged with a wide range of crimes, including the execution of guerrilla dissidents, torture and kidnapping of guerrilla fighters and their supporters. In 1987 and 1988, the Carapintadas rebelled against the elected government of President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n, but both uprisings were quickly put down. In December 1988, members of the Grupo Albatros, led by Colonel Mohamed Al√≠ Seineld√≠n rebelled once again against the Alfons√≠n government and seized the military barracks at Villa Martelli. The mutineers eventually surrendered and Seineld√≠n was arrested. Seineld√≠n led a second unsuccessful uprising against the government of President Carlos Menem beginning on December 3, 1990. The failed uprising resulted in 14 deaths, including five civilians. Seineld√≠n was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the 1990 mutiny. However, he was pardoned by President Eduardo Duhalde in 2003.  Death  Mohamed Al√≠ Seineld√≠n suffered a heart attack and died in a hospital in Buenos Aires on September 2, 2009, at the age of 75.

A descendant of Bold Forbes, he was sired by Ameri Valay and bred by Nancy H. Alberts. Magic Weisner was a graded stakes winner but is best remembered for his runner-up finish in the 2002 Preakness Stakes and his serious public battle to overcome West Nile fever when little was known about the disease.Pedigee Online, Thoroughbred Database website;  Two-year-old season  Nancy Alberts, also Magic Weisner's owner, trainer, and exercise rider, bred the horse from a mare named Jazema, which she bought as a yearling for $1 because of her crooked legs. In the late 1980s, Alberts lost Jazema twice in claiming races and bought her back both times. The final time she bought her back was for breeding. Alberts had commented that Jazema had a special eye for Ameri Valay because of seeing him around the barn area at Laurel Park. Jazema, in Arabic meant \\"hope\\", and in 1998 her first born was named Deliver Hope. In February 1999, Alberts nursed Jazema during some difficult times in the late term of her pregnancy. In May, Magic Weisner foaled at Shamrock Farms under the care of Jim and Christy Steele. Since Alberts didn't own a farm, Magic Weisner was raised at different farms in the Laurel, MD area. At age two, the colt lost his first two races before breaking his maiden in his third try. He trained at Bowie Race Course and shipped up to Laurel in the summer of 2001 to score his first win. He followed that up with an allowance win in late August of that year. Then Alberts entered Magic Weisner in the Maryland Juvenile Championship Stakes, a nine-furlong dirt race at Laurel Park, which he won. He finished the year with three wins in five starts.  Three-year-old season  Magic Weisner bridged his two- and three- year-old seasons with five straight wins, including victories in the Goss Striker Stakes, the Deputed Testamony Stakes, and the Private Terms Stakes, all at Laurel Park Race Course. In the Federico Tesio Stakes, a race that many locals call the \\"Preakness Trial\\" at Pimlico Race Course, he finished second to Smoked Em, a highly regarded three-year-old trained by Todd Pletcher. Alberts felt that jockey Phil Teter didn't listen to her instructions and felt that Magic Weisner could have won the race. In the 127th Preakness Stakes, Magic Weisner was listed as the second longest shot in a field of thirteen horses, many of them graded stakes winners. The favorites were the top three finishers in the Kentucky Derby and its beaten favorite. War Emblem, Proud Citizen, Medaglia d'Oro, and Harlan's Holiday garnered the vast majority of the public's support. Magic Weisner was listed at 40-1 on the morning line but dropped to 33-1 at post time because of a deep local following and empathy for Alberts' Cinderella story. As the gates opened, speedster Menacing Dennis rushed to the lead, followed by War Emblem and Booklet going into the first turn as Magic Weisner lagged far back in eleventh of thirteen. With three furlongs to go, War Emblem took over the lead, followed closely by Proud Citizen, Madaglia d'Oro, and Harlan's Holiday. In the last 110 yards, Magic Weisner rallied from far back to finish second to War Emblem by a half length. He returned to run fourth in the grade one Belmont Stakes, losing to longshot Sarava. He then won the grade two Ohio Derby by a neck over Wiseman's Ferry, who carried him very wide, and The Judge Sez Who, who finished third. He next finished second behind War Emblem by three and a half lengths in the grade one Haskell Invitational. Late that year, he contracted the West Nile virus while preparing for the grade two Pennsylvania Derby in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During his sophomore season, Magic Weisner either won or placed in six of seven stakes races.  Four-year-old season  Magic Weisner contracted West Nile virus late in 2002 and missed most of the 2003 season. In July 2003 at opening day at Laurel Park Race Course, he returned in a seven-furlong race. Alberts had intended to prime him for the Maryland Million Classic on October 11 at Laurel Park. However, Magic Weisner finished last as the favorite. He never raced again and was retired in May 2005.  Retirement  At his retirement, Alberts said, \\"He looks fine but the West Nile virus just damaged all the nerves around his back and hind quarters. I am sure he'll be able to have another profession. He's at the farm, just trying to get the fitness out of him. I've had a couple people contact me about making him a dressage horse. He is a beautiful mover and sound and he loves to do anything you ask him to do.\\"The Handicapper's Edgeon Brisnet; . Magic Weisner now lives with Alberts' sister Linda in Pennsylvania. Alberts died due to complications from a stroke in 2011. Her only son, Will (will-at-albertsracing.com), took over her horse business. Jazema's last-born filly, Jazema's Ginger (Ginger), by Go For Gin, will be bred in 2012.

Planning The fair was organized to honor Rafael Trujillo and his regime at the twenty-fifth anniversary of their rule Alvarez Pina was nominated as president of the organizing commission in July 1955. A tract of land on the western edge of the capital was set aside for the fair grounds. Forty-two nations agreed to participate. A new hotel, the El Embajador, was built with the penthouse for Trujillo's personal use. In the short time of only six months a majority of the construction was completed. However, at the deadline of December 20, a third of the planned structures and exhibits were not yet ready. The Fair On December 20, 1955 Hector Trujillo cut the opening ribbon and Rafael Trujillo delivered the address summarizing his achievements. Trujillo's daughter, the 16-year-old Angelita, was crowned as \\"Queen Angelita I\\" to preside over the fair. Accompanied by 150 \\"princesses\\" she wore a white satin dress bordered with 600 Russian ermine furs and a 75 feet train that had been commissioned for $80,000 at Fontana from Rome. A military parade impressed the strength of the Dominican military. At the Plaza de las Naciones, the entry to the exhibition, two large sculptural pieces were erected, a harp intoning the winds and a colossus (Atlas or Apollo) with raised arms holding a dove and the universe; both structures were destroyed by Hurricane David in 1979. Seventy-five permanent buildings were constructed for the fair. Xavier Cugat and his New York City Latin Band were contracted among others for entertainment. Notable permanent buildings include the City Hall and the National Congress, both by Guillermo Gonzalez Sanchez, and the endangered Teatro Agua Y Luz by Carles Bu√Øgas.Hotel on Teatro Agua Luz authorized (2006), accessed September 22, 2009 Industrial and agricultural exhibits accompanied the fair. A cattle exhibition was of special interest to Trujillo with his interest in cattle breeding. Visitors included president Kubitschek of Brasil and dignitaries from many nations. Aftermath Many physical structures of the fair survived; a number of the permanent buildings were turned over for use as government offices. Financially, however, the result was disappointing as attendance was below what had been expected and investments failed to materialize. The cost of $30 million was a sizable expense equal to a third of the annual budget.

They belonged to the Gama wrestling family that lasted for many decades before the independence of Pakistan. This group included resident Pakistani champions such as Bholu Pahalwan, Azam Pahalwan, Aslam Pahalwan, Akram Pahalwan and Goga Pahalwan. These were the sons of Imam Baksh Pahalwan (Rustam-e-Hind). And nephews of Gama, the Greatest wrestler that India has ever produced. Wrestling was a way of life for them. Some of the main wrestling gyms were owned and operated by the Bholu Pahalwan family (formerly known as Gama Wrestling Family). Early Days The Great Bholu's Gym known as Dar-ul-Sehat was located in a building in the City of Karachi. It was a muddy wrestling arena within a vast courtyard that was surrounded by wooden benches. Pakistan's first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan allotted this building to this wrestling family to be used for training. It was once an akhara or traditional training hall where deshi kushti was practiced. The wrestling matches were called dangal, and were fought on a mud pit. The Government of Pakistan, till Ayub Khan's regime, regularly provided a special grant to Bholu Pahalwan family as recognition for their services to the sport. Earlier, every city, town and village of the country had its own akhara. The continuous flow of talent kept the game alive. And the Bholu's legacy rose to the highest ranks in the world of wrestling. In earlier days when the sport of wrestling prevailed in Pakistan, the passion for wrestling was such that the wrestling fans jam-packed the stadiums in almost every locality of Pakistan. Back then, the people used to gather on the streets just to catch a glimpse of a wrestler. The women and children crowded the rooftops of their dwellings just to watch the wrestlers go passing by on the streets in their horse-driven carriages. Those were the days when the Pakistani Bholu Brothers were very popular in the East. They were renowned wrestlers with outstanding skills. The Bholu Brothers never needed an introduction in Asian community. People had a high regard for them and honored them as sports heroes. Training The Pakistani Bholu Brothers were trained by 'Gama Pahalwan, the world champion'. There was a time, when they were outstanding wrestlers. They remained major players of the game in the region after independence in 1947. Soon Afterwards, Bholu Pahalwan acquired the title of Rustam-e-Pakistan in 1949. His younger brother Aslam Pahalwan alias Achcha successfully conquered the Rustam-e-Punjab title in 1951. Azam was declared Rustam-e-Hind in 1953. Goga was better known as the resident Champion.

He trounced all opposition in Kenya including their champion, Mahinder Singh. He also competed in the Tag Team events along with brother Aslam and Goga. Amongst the six wrestler sons of Imam Bakhsh Pahalwan, Akki was perhaps the most graceful and fastest. He started his career in teen years and soon hit into prominence. Initially he was a student of Gama, and started competing from Lahore. During his early days he met the much superior Kala Pahalwan, \\"the Lion of Punjab\\" and lost the match. But the later did not give Akram the return bout and pitted his numerous pupils to halt the victory march of this No.3 wrestler of the Indo- Pakistan. In 1954, Akram went to Bombay and there he had a series of matches without a loss. After his return to Pakistan Akram challenged all opposition at home. The champion of Multan, the powerful, Zamman khan disputed his claim and tangled with him. But the latter proved better than the khan of Multan and defeated him. Later Akram and his brothers toured Malaya in 1958. There he beats their Idol, Hari Ram in a challenge bout. Then in a match in Chittagong against Big Bill Verna of Australia, he dislocated his left shoulder and was hospitalized. But even then he evaded defeat and the match ended in a draw. When his shoulder healed, Akram was back in action and agreed to tangle with the giant King Kong of Hungary. In this bout Akram defeated King Kong (Emile Czaja) in just 3 rounds. And when the new threat to the Bholu Brothers in person of Bhola Gadi, the champion of Lahore defeated the Bholu brother, Azam alias Raja in May 1962, in the historical cities championship tournament. Akram then wrestled Bhola Gadi at Iqbal Park, Lahore in a challenge match. On this occasion, after a furious struggle between the pair Akram lifted Bhola Gadi sky-high and slammed him on the mat for the initial three counts. Hence the next opponent for Akram was the highly reputed, Haji Afzal, a very clever but lighter wrestler. But this proved Afzal's turning point and Afzal was pinned in 15 minutes. In Nepal, Akram defeated the Kabul champion, Sardar Khan. Then in a challenge fight he trounced Pyara Singh of Indian, Punjab. Some of his memorable victories are over Haji Afzal, King Kong, Aussie, Clyde Kennedy, Hardam Singh, Gurnam Singh, Hari Ram, Emile Koroshenko, Tony Kontellis, Con Papalazarou, Baron Von Heczey, Bloorma, Sam Betts and George Gordianko.

The Art Deco and WPA Moderne style building opened in 1934 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places (as U.S. Post Office-Long Beach Main) due to its architectural significance in 1985. It remains in operation as a post office. Description The structure was built from 1933 to 1934 as a project of the New Deal's Works Progress Administration. It is built out of large masonry blocks with terra cotta sheathing. The structure's most prominent feature is the central tower rising four-and-a-half stories from the street level. The building's design has been credited to Louis A. Simon and the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A. Wetmore. From 1933 to 1939, Simon was the head of the Office of the Supervising Architect, an agency of the United States Treasury Department that designed federal government buildings. The building's architectural style has been described as \\"Starved Classicism\\" and \\"PWA/WPA Moderne\\". One writer has referred to the building as \\"Post-Quake Moderne,\\" due to the fact that the Moderne style of Art Deco architecture was prevalent as Long Beach was rebuilt after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. In their book, \\"An architectural guidebook to Los Angeles,\\" architectural historians David Gebhard and Robert Winter described the Long Beach Main Post Office as \\"PWA Moderne, accomplished with restrained and sophisticated taste.\\" History The proposal for the new main post office building was officially accepted in March 1931, and the groundbreaking took place one year later in March 1932. Construction was underway when the 1933 Long Beach earthquake struck the city. Construction was halted briefly, but work resumed a week later after a survey by contractors showed little damage. The scaffolding was removed from the structure at the end of July 1934, and 5,000 persons attended the opening ceremony in September 1934. The structure has been in continuous operation as a post office since 1934.

In 1967 he received his Bachelor's Degree in mathematics. He began researching lucid dreaming for his Ph.D. in Psychophysiology at Stanford University, which he received in 1980.Stephen LaBerge at IASD He developed techniques to enable himself and other researchers to enter a lucid dream state at will, most notably the MILD technique (mnemonic induction of lucid dreams), which was used in many forms of dream experimentation.Lucid Dreaming Frequently Asked Questions Answered by The Lucidity Institute In 1987, he founded The Lucidity Institute, an organization that promotes research into lucid dreaming, as well as running courses for the general public on how to achieve a lucid dream.About the Lucidity Institute In the early 1980s, news of LaBerge's research using the technique of signalling to a collaborator monitoring his EEG with agreed-upon eye movements during REM, helped to popularise lucid dreaming in the American media. Research results Results from LaBerge's lab and othersPsychophysiology of Lucid Dreaming include: *comparison of subjective sense of time in dreams versus the waking state using eye signals *comparison of electrical activity in the brain when singing while awake, and while in a dream *various studies comparing physiological sexual arousal and in-dream sex and orgasm. Lucid dreaming education and facilitation LaBerge developed a series of devices to help users enter a lucid state while dreaming. The original device was called a DreamLight, which was discontinued in favor of the NovaDreamer, designed by experienced lucid dreamer Craig Webb for the Lucidity Institute while he worked there and participated in lucid dreaming research at Stanford. As of 2013 it was not possible to purchase these devices from the Lucidity Institute website. An improved version of the NovaDreamer is allegedly under development.The NovaDreamer Lucid Dream Induction Device All of the devices consist of a mask worn over the eyes with LEDs positioned over the eyelids. The LEDs flash whenever the mask detects that the wearer has entered REM sleep. The stimulus is incorporated into the wearer's dreams and can be recognised as a sign that they are dreaming.Lucid Dreaming Frequently Asked Questions Answered by The Lucidity Institute LaBerge currently lectures at universities and other professional institutions, and hosts lucid dreaming sessions at various locations.

Lloyd has also participated in reality shows including The Amazing Race 16, Big Brother 13, and Marriage Boot Camp. Big Brother Season 11 Lloyd was chosen to be a houseguest on the eleventh season of the CBS reality show Big Brother in the summer of 2009. As part of the season's high school cliques twist, Lloyd was placed in the popular clique, alongside Braden Bacha and Laura Crosby. In the first week, Lloyd formed a close friendship with house outsider Jeff Schroeder, leading to a long-lasting alliance between the pair. When her clique member and friend Braden was nominated for eviction, Jordan was instrumental in the attempt to save him, seemingly gathering the votes to evict Chima Simone. However, on eviction night, Ronnie Talbot betrayed the alliance, forcing a tie that caused Braden's eviction. Jordan was nominated in the following two weeks, but was spared on both occasions as she was considered less of a threat than her fellow nominees Laura and Casey - both members of her initial alliance. Things began to turn in Jordan's favor in the fourth week of the show, when during a key Head of Household competition, Jeff struck a deal with Russell Kairouz, guaranteeing safety for himself and Jordan if he allowed Russell to win the competition. This allowed Russell to target and evict Ronnie. In the same week, Jeff won a public vote, and was secretly awarded the coup d'√©tat ‚Äì the power to overthrow a Head of Household and change the nominations. Jeff opted to use the power during Chima's Head of Household reign the week after Ronnie's Eviction, saving Russell from eviction, and condemning Jessie to the jury. Following Jessie's eviction, the balance of power in the house firmly flipped, with the rival alliance acting angrily to Jessie's eviction, eventually resulting in Chima leaving the game. Following Chima's surprise exit, Jordan won her first competition in the impromptu Head of Household competition, with Lydia Tavera and Natalie Martinez being her choices for nominations. Jordan then proceeded to win the Power of Veto competition for the first time, and ensured Lydia's eviction by keeping the nominations the same. Jeff then became Head of Household for the first time, but after continued manipulation by Natalie and Kevin Campbell, Jeff became paranoid about Russell's true loyalties, and after winning the Veto, used it on Kevin and replacing him with Russell, who was then evicted. Kevin then proceeded to win Head of Household, choosing to nominate Jeff and Michele for eviction. Michele won the veto, and Jordan was named as the replacement nominee. Despite openly expressing her wish for Jeff to stay in the game instead of her, Jordan was spared and moved into the final four. Nominated alongside her last ally Michele, Jordan was once again spared, as Michele was seen as more likely to win the final Head of Household competition. Now in the final three, Jordan was outnumbered 2-1 by the alliance of Kevin and Natalie, and lost the first part of the final Head of Household competition to Kevin. However, she then rebounded by surprisingly winning the final two parts, earning herself a spot in the final two. She chose to evict Kevin and take Natalie to the final with her. Faced with the jury, Jordan admitted she hadn't played as strong a strategic game as Natalie, but in the end emerged as the winner in a 5-2 vote, gaining the votes of Jeff, Michele, Lydia, Jessie and a vote from America, losing just Kevin and Russell's votes. Jordan was well received by the audience of the show during the season, with her and Jeff being described as two of the most popular houseguests in years. At the 2009 Fox Reality Awards, the pair were given the award for \\"Favorite Duo\\".http://www.cinemablend.com/television/2009-Fox- Really-Awards-Results-20524.html# During the first Big Brother 12 eviction show, nominee Annie Whittington cited Lloyd and Schroeder's relationship as an example of why her fellow houseguests should evict fellow nominee Rachel Reilly, who had become involved in a relationship with housemate Brendon Villegas. Lloyd and Schroeder later appeared in the fifth week of the season as hosts of a veto competition. Season 13 Two years after her initial appearance, Jordan returned to the house for the thirteenth season of the show, again with Jeff, as part of the duos twist. In the first week, Jordan joined an alliance of the six returning players, consisting of herself and Jeff, father and daughter Dick and Daniele Donato, and fellow couple Brendon Villegas and Rachel Reilly, and following Dick's unexpected departure, was pivotal in securing the key votes of Shelly Moore and Kalia Booker in the Veteran's successful attempt to save Porsche Briggs and evict her partner, Keith Henderson. Jordan continued to prove her worth by winning the second Head of Household competition, and opted to target the popular Dominic Briones, nominating him alongside Adam Poch. However, when Dominic used the veto on the pair, Jordan was forced to nominate a replacement pair, and under pressure from her alliance, she reluctantly nominated Shelly and Cassi Colvin for eviction, resulting in Cassi's unanimous eviction. After surviving eviction, Shelly pledged her loyalty to Jeff and Jordan, agreeing to go to the final three with them. In the third week of the game, Jordan's alliance collapsed when Daniele turned on her and Jeff, trying to persuade Rachel to nominate them. They objected to her move, cementing the alliance between the two couples, but resulting in Daniele leaving the alliance when Dominic was evicted. Daniele then won the Head of Household competition and immediately targeted her former allies for eviction. However, she then backtracked on her plans to evict Jeff, and after promising Jeff and Jordan safety, instead targeted and nominated Brendon and Rachel. Brendon then won the Power of Veto and after using it on Rachel, Jordan was nominated as a pawn by Daniele. On eviction night, Jordan was spared, and Brendon was evicted by a vote of 5-2, gaining the votes of Rachel and Porsche. The following week, Kalia rose to power for the first time, but opted to keep Jordan safe throughout the week due to an earlier promise between the pair never to nominate each other. The next week, Brendon returned to the game, and Daniele again became Head of Household. Fearing Jeff would win the next Head of Household competition, Daniele tried to strike a deal with Jeff and Jordan after naming Brendon as her replacement nominee, but when Jeff did win Head of Household, and when Daniele failed to win the Power of Veto, she was named as the replacement nominee. Despite the votes being locked to evict Daniele, Shelly began to have doubts about her alliance with Jeff and Jordan, and actively began campaigning to save Daniele, upsetting Jeff who engaged in an argument with Shelly shortly before the live show. The houseguest's learned it was Fast-Forward eviction night, and after Daniele was evicted, Kalia became the new Head of Household and nominated Jeff and Rachel for eviction. Jeff was unable to win the veto, and Shelly voted to evict Jeff, forcing a tie, which Kalia broke in Rachel's favor, resulting in Jeff's eviction. Jordan furiously declared the end of her friendship with Shelly, losing her temper in a rare moment of anger. With Porsche now in power, Rachel and Jordan felt doomed, but were given a chance of reprieve when Porsche opened Pandora's Box, re-activating the Duos twist for one week. Jordan paired up with Rachel, and despite initially being nominated as a pair, Rachel won the Veto, and used it on herself and Jordan, essentially giving them the choice of whom to evict from the two replacement nominees ‚Äì Adam and Shelly. One week after Jeff's eviction, Jordan and Rachel chose to take revenge on Shelly, evicting her in a 2-1 vote. Rachel then proceeded to win the next Head of Household competition, and despite Adam having the ability to use his Veto to put Jordan in a position of certain eviction, he chose to maintain his long-standing alliance with Jordan, pushing her into the final four. Wanting to keep her early deal with nominated houseguest Kalia, Jordan voted to evict Porsche on eviction night, aware that Rachel would break the resultant tie and evict Kalia anyway. The following week, Jordan narrowly lost the power position to Adam by a single point, and lost the Veto to Porsche, who also gained the sole power to choose who to evict of Jordan and Rachel. Jordan's choice to vote to evict Porsche two days previously came back to haunt her, and she was evicted from the game for the first time, after 69 days in the house. Jordan voted for Rachel to win Big Brother 13. The Amazing Race In 2009, rumors appeared online that Lloyd and Schroeder would be appearing on the upcoming 2010 edition of the reality show The Amazing Race. Their position was later confirmed when the cast list was revealed, with the pair being labeled as \\"Newly Dating.\\" Lloyd and Schroeder won the first leg of the race, came 6th in the second leg, then came in 5th place in the third leg of the race. In the fourth leg, they came in 8th, last place, but they were safe because it was a non-elimination leg. In spite of a penalty \\"Speed Bump\\" in the 5th leg, they finished in 7th place. However, they came in last place in the sixth leg and were the fifth team eliminated, finishing in 7th place out of 11 teams. Personal life Lloyd stated after winning season 11 of Big Brother that the first thing she would do with her half-million dollar win was to put a down-payment on a house for herself and her family. She subsequently bought and moved into a 3-bedroom townhouse in Waxhaw, North Carolina with her mother and brother. As planned, she went back to work at the salon and attended school. Following their appearance together on Big Brother, Lloyd confirmed in October 2009 that she had begun dating fellow contestant Jeff Schroeder. In May 2012, Lloyd and Schroeder moved together to Los Angeles. A web show entitled \\"Jeff and Jordan do America\\", which documented their trip to Los Angeles, aired on CBS Interactive in July 2012. Lloyd became engaged to Schroeder in September 2014, after he proposed to her in the backyard of the Big Brother house while they were visiting the season 16 houseguests. Their intended wedding date was October 1, 2016. On April 6, 2016, the couple announced that they had quietly married in March 2016 and are expecting their first child, a boy, due in October 2016. On October 13, 2016, they welcomed their first son, Lawson Keith Schroeder. Jordan and Jeff revealed in 2020 that after their son, Lawson, was born that she suffered from pospartum depression and their marriage almost didn't survive it. On March 23, 2018 Jordan announced via Twitter baby number 2 is due in September 2018. On September 7, 2018 they welcomed their second son, Layton Sarti Schroeder During the summer of 2010, Lloyd hosted a segment on RealPlayer SuperPass called \\"Home Life With Jordan\\" discussing Big Brother 12, along with fellow Big Brother alumna, Chelsia Hart.

During the American Civil War Asian Americans fought for both the Union and the Confederacy. Afterwards Asian Americans served primarily in the U.S. Navy until the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. At the beginning of the 20th century, Asian Americans began to attend U.S. military academies, and the first Asian Americans were awarded the Medal of Honor. World War I saw Asian Americans serving as \\"non- whites\\" in the National Army. After World War I, Asian American service fell into obscurity until World War II when significant contributions by Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, and Korean Americans were documented. With the desegregation of the U.S. military in 1948, segregated Asian American units ceased to exist, and Asian Americans served in integrated armed forces. Asian American combatants in the Korean and Vietnam conflicts were awarded the Medal of Honor, and Asian Americans have continued to serve into the present day. 19th century An engraving of Andrew Jackson commanding the American artillery batteries at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.

During the War of 1812, General Andrew Jackson recorded that \\"Manilamen\\" had fought under his general command in defense of New Orleans, under the direct command of Jean Baptiste Lafitte. Following the war, at least one Filipino American, Augustin Feliciano, continued to serve in the U.S. Navy. From the end of the War of 1812 to the beginning of the American Civil War, Asian Americans were not recorded in the annals of U.S. military history. American Civil War Many more Asian Americans served in the forces of both sides of the Civil War, being born in various places including Amoy, Batavia, Bombay,The city of Bombay was, and under its modern name of Mumbai. During the British Raj, it was the seat of government of the Bombay Presidency. It is possible that \\"Bombay\\" in the source refers not only to the city itself, but also to that much larger region which made up the presidency. Burma, Calcutta, Canton,Canton has multiple meanings. The source is unspecific, but only two of the meanings relate to Asia (more precisely, to China). Those are the old romanized names of the city of Canton (modern Guangzhou), which was the capital of the province of Canton (modern Guangdong). It is unclear whether the narrower or the broader meaning was intended. Changchow,There are two cities, both in China, whose names were at one time romanized as Changchow: Changzhou in Jiangsu Province and Zhangzhou in Fujian Province. Both are sizable port cities.

In 1861, a Chinese American by the name of John Tomney joined the New York Infantry, eventually dying of wounds received at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Joseph Pierce (his chosen name) was brought to the U.S. from China by his adoptive father, Connecticut ship Captain and Far East trader Amos Peck. Pierce enlisted on 26 July 1862 and was mustered into the Fourteenth Regiment, Company F of the Connecticut Volunteer Infantry that became part of the Second Brigade of the Third Division, Second Army Corps of the Army of the Potomac. From 1862 to 1865, Pierce fought in pivotal battles of the war, fighting in major campaigns from Antietam to Gettysburg to Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. Pierce achieved the highest rank of any Chinese American to serve in the Union Army, reaching the rank of corporal. Pierce's picture hangs in the Gettysburg Museum. In 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the actions of Pierce and other Asian-Pacific Islander soldiers of the Civil War. Edward Day Cohota was born in Shanghai, China, and was \\"adopted\\" by the captain of the merchant ship Cohota, Sargent S. Day. He served in the 23rd Massachusetts Infantry during the American Civil War. After the war, he rejoined the Army and served for 30 years. Cohota believed he was a U.S. citizen by virtue of having served in the Union Army, but his service had not automatically conferred citizenship upon him, and the passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 kept him from becoming a naturalized citizen. William Ah Hang, a Chinese American, became one of the first Asian Americans to enlist in the U.S. Navy in 1863. In total more than 50 Chinese Americans fought, on both sides, in the Civil War. Of those who served, only a handful received recognition of their service in the form of pension, benefits, or citizenship. An exception was Ching Lee, who took the alias Thomas Sylvanus and served in the 81st Pennsylvania Regiment. During the Civil War, the Bunker family, of Mount Airy, North Carolina, were supporters of the Confederacy, to include giving medical aid to Confederate Soldiers. Christopher Wren Bunker and his brother Stephen Bunker, were the eldest sons of Chang and Eng Bunker, the original \\"Siamese Twins\\", whose fathers who were of Chinese ancestry from Siam and married white women joined different Confederate cavalry units. In 1864, Christopher Wren Bunker was captured, and was sent to Camp Chase.

Matsumura Junzo was the first to graduate in 1873. Matsumura was a foreign national, and like the other Asian graduates who attended around this time who went on to serve their own nations' militaries, upon graduation he served in the Imperial Japanese Navy, eventually reaching the rank of captain. Nearly forty years passed before the first Asian American U.S. nationals followed in the footsteps of these foreign nationals and were accepted into the various U.S. military academies. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Another lull in recordings of Asian American service followed the end of the Civil War until the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. When the sank in Havana Harbor, seven of the casualties were Japanese Americans and one was a Chinese American. Later in the war it was recorded that Japanese Americans served aboard U.S. warships in the Battle of Manila Bay; the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, previously known as the Philippine Insurrection, followed. 20th century U.S. Army Philippine Scouts in the Philippine Islands a territory of the U.S. in 1905 Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War and Moro Rebellion alt=An armored cruiser anchored, with a navy jack flying from the jackstaff In 1901, the Philippine Constabulary and Philippine Scouts were initially founded to assist the U.S. against the forces of the First Philippine Republic and the insurgency that followed after its collapse. That same year President William McKinley signed an executive order to allow 500 Filipinos to enlist in the U.S. Navy. From these routes of enlistment came the first Asian American recipients of the Medal of Honor. Private Jose Nisperos, a Philippine Scout, protected his party from Moros; for this action, he received the Medal of Honor in 1911. In 1915, Fireman Second Class Telesforo Trinidad, along with Ensign Robert Webster Cary, was awarded the Medal of Honor for saving fellow crewmembers when the boiler of the exploded. and As of 2011, Trinidad has been the only Asian American recipient of the naval version of the Medal of Honor. During the Presidency of William Howard Taft, Filipino Stewards began to serve in the White House, a practice that would continue into the end of the 20th Century, to include during the Presidency of Bill Clinton. 20th-century Asian American military academy graduates Vicente Lim was one of the first Asian Americans to graduate. A Filipino American and U.S. national from the Philippines, Lim graduated from West Point in the class of 1914 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Philippine Scouts. He was the first of a handful of Filipinos accepted into West Point under a quota system that required one Filipino to be appointed in each class, with no more than four being enrolled at any one time. In 1916, Filipinos Americans began to be accepted into Annapolis; the first batch would enroll in 1919. The graduates lost their status as U.S. nationals in 1935, and many went on to serve in the fledgling Armed Forces of the Philippines. Mexican Expedition U.S. Army General alt=Three men in military uniform in the foreground, dressed in U.S. Army Uniforms appropriate for 1916. In the early 20th century, while the rest of the world was engulfed in the depths of World War I, the U.S. was looking to its south. Mexico had been embroiled in a civil war since 1910, and in 1916 the violence spilt north over the border when Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico, killing 16 Americans. This culminated with a U.S. response, officially known as the Mexican Expedition, led by Major General John Pershing. A large number Chinese Mexicans assisted U.S. forces in Mexico during the expedition and upon its completion in early 1917, they were threatened with hanging by Villa. Despite the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Act, Pershing sought permission for these people to be allowed to resettle in the U.S. A total of 527 eventually entered the country, settling mostly in San Antonio, and they later became known as \\"Pershing's Chinese\\". World War I During World War I, Indian American Bhagat Singh Thind, who served in the U.S. Army, was promoted to sergeant and was stationed at Camp Lewis, Washington in 1918. Thind, a Sikh, was the first U.S. serviceman to be allowed for religious reasons to wear a turban as part of their military uniform. In April 1917, the U.S. entered World War I on the side of the Allies. The U.S. Insular Government of the Philippine Islands created its own national guard units to join the effort, but did not see combat. The units were demobilized at Camp Thomas Claudio in 1918. Within the United States, a draft was started, and alongside Hispanic and Native Americans, Asian Americans were drafted as \\"non-whites\\" filling out the \\"white quota\\" in the National Army. The majority of Asian Americans did not see combat. Indian American Bhagat Singh Thind served in the U.S. Army and was stationed at Camp Lewis, Washington in 1918. Thind a Sikh was the first U.S. serviceman to be allowed for religious reasons to wear a turban as part of their military uniform. A few saw combat. Private Tomas Mateo Claudio, who had studied at the University of Nevada and became the first, and only, Filipino American to die during the war, being killed at Ch√¢teau-Thierry in 1918; \\\\- Private Henry Chinn who was killed in action in the Argonne Forest while serving in the \\"Lost Battalion\\"; Sergeant Sing Kee, another member of the Lost Battalion, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross; and Sergeant Major Tokutaro Nishimura Slocum who served in the 328th Infantry Regiment, 82d Infantry Division. In the Navy, the number of enlisted Filipinos peaked at more than 5,700 by the end of the war. Several thousand Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Filipinos eventually served in the U.S. military during World War I. Many Asian American military veterans were allowed to become naturalized citizens. For instance, some Filipino participants were allowed to become naturalized citizens. but others had to overcome numerous legal obstacles. For example, although many Japanese aliens in America volunteered during World War I under the belief that they would be eligible for naturalization, 400 Japanese immigrant veterans in Hawaii who were initially allowed to be naturalized in 1919 had their citizenship rescinded in 1922. Notably, Hidemitsu Toyota, who had served in the US Army for seven years, had his petition for naturalization brought before the US Supreme Court, but in 1925 the court ruled in Hidemitsu Toyota v. United States that \\"that a person of the Japanese race may not be naturalized\\". It was not until 1935, with the passage of the Nye-Lea Act, that the 400 Japanese immigrant veterans who had had their citizenship revoked, along with 100 other Asian immigrants, were successfully naturalized. Another example, Cesario Agudo Buensuceso (a Filipino American who resided in Chicago after the war), initially attempted to naturalize after serving during World War I, but was denied in 1924; it was not until after World War II that he was able to naturalize.

During the interwar period U.S. forces were involved in several minor actions, including the Russian Civil War and multiple events in the Caribbean that have since become known as the Banana Wars; also, the Yangtze Patrol was directly and indirectly affected by the Second Sino-Japanese War and other events. Between 1918 and 1933, at least 3,900 Filipino Americans served in the U.S. Navy at any given time as mess stewards, having largely replaced African Americans in that rating. Up to World War I, Filipino sailors were able to serve in a range of occupations in the U.S. Navy; however, after World War I, a rule restricted Filipinos to the ratings of officer's steward and mess attendant. These restrictions did not extend to the Insular Force, which was limited to 500 individuals from Guam or the Philippines. In 1934, Gordon Pai'ea Chung-Hoon became the first Asian American U.S. citizen to graduate from the Naval Academy, and the first Asian American West Point graduate, Wing Fook Jung, graduated in 1940. In 1940, Japanese Americans were the largest ethnicity of Asian Americans, followed by (in order of population) Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, Hindu Americans, and Korean Americans. In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War began. A Chinese American, Arthur Chin, had gone to China in 1934 and joined the Republic of China Air Force, and flew as a fighter pilot. During the war Chin becoming the first American flying ace of World War II, with eight victories. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Air Medal. In September 1939, war broke out in Europe following the German invasion of Poland. The U.S. officially remained neutral, but Americans became involved in combat while serving in other countries' militaries in units such as the Flying Tigers in China and the Eagle Squadrons that served with the Royal Air Force shortly after the Battle of Britain; U.S. forces also provided logistic support through the cash and carry program, and by undertaking convoy escort duties in the Atlantic. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. officially declared war, and from that point on Asian Americans were on the front lines as U.S. civilians. Asian Americans from Oahu, including Japanese Americans, assisted with aid efforts following the attack. On the other side of the Pacific Ocean, Philippine Commonwealth forces, under U.S. command since July 1941, prepared for an attack that would come nine hours later. World War II Japanese Americans alt=In foreground group of Japanese-American soldiers climb over a ridge and begin to fire upon a German tank in the background which is accompanied by a German half-track in a wooded area. alt=Two columns of Japanese American soldiers in route step in France.

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans in the Hawaii National Guard activated and began to guard the beaches, clear rubble, donate blood and aid the wounded but three days later, they were disarmed because of their ancestry. The next day, however, they were authorized to rearm, but an uneasy tension lasted until 5 June 1942. At the same time, Japanese Americans who had been undertaking the ROTC program at the University of Hawaii, and who had been activated in the Hawaii Territorial Guard, were discharged on 19 January 1942. Many of these discharged soldiers formed a Corps of Engineers auxiliary, known as the \\"Varsity Victory Volunteers\\", in February 1942. On 5 June 1942, 1,400 Nisei of the Hawaii National Guard shipped out from Hawaii bound for Oakland and on 12 June, after docking, they were formed into the 100th Infantry Battalion. Afterwards, all Japanese American men, not already in the military, were classified as enemy aliens; this policy was reversed in 1943. Eight months later the decision was made to raise an all-Nisei regiment, known as the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. Progress was slow at first, and another four months passed before the 442nd began training; two months after that, though, the 100th shipped out to Europe. Initially, the notion of employing Japanese American soldiers was rejected by General Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force, but they were eventually accepted by Lieutenant General Mark Clark's Fifth Army. While the 442nd was training in the U.S., the 100th sustained heavy losses, eventually earning the title the \\"Purple Heart Battalion.\\" On 26 June 1944, two weeks after the 442nd arrived in Europe, the two Nisei units combined to form one single unit, but those who had been a part of the 100th wanted to keep their numerical designation, so they replaced the regiment's 1st Battalion. Keeping with the policy at the time, the unit was segregated, and large number of the other members of the 442nd RCT were previously interned Japanese Americans from the continental United States, commanded by mostly white officers. The combat chronicle of the regiment became a highly storied one, resulting in it becoming one of the most decorated units in the European Theater, taking part in numerous actions in Italy, France and Germany, including the liberation of Dachau concentration camp. The 442nd Regiment was the most decorated unit for its size and length of service in the history of American warfare. The 4,000 men who initially made up the unit in April 1943 had to be replaced nearly 2.5 times. In total, about 14,000 men served, earning 9,486 Purple Hearts. The unit was awarded eight Presidential Unit Citations (five earned in one month). Additionally, Japanese Americans also contributed to the war effort in the Pacific Front serving in the Military Intelligence Service, helping with the decoding of Japanese intelligence and the rebuilding of occupied Japan; the first Asian American women to enter the U.S. military served within this unit through the Women's Army Corps. More than a dozen volunteers from the 442nd were selected to join the Office of Strategic Services and were selected for service in India and Burma, where they conducted covert operations, translation, interrogation, and signal intelligence. Over 33,000 Japanese Americans served in the military during World War II. Upon returning home, Japanese American service members found old prejudices remained. In 1946, one of the 442nd's soldiers, PFC Sadao Munemori, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the regiment's service in Italy. His award was one of two made to Asian Americans during, or in the immediate aftermath of, the war, and the only one made to a Japanese American. However, in 2000, after a review of other medals awarded to the 442nd, 21 were elevated to Medals of Honor. One of those 21 was presented to Hawaii Senator, and former Captain, Daniel K. Inouye. On 5 October 2010, Congress created the Congressional Gold Medal recognizing the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion, as well as the 6,000 Japanese Americans who served in the Military Intelligence Service during the war. Chinese Americans Chinese American soldier training at alt=Soldier kneels aiming down the iron sight of a Thompson submachine gun in front of a M3 Half-track. It has been estimated that between 12,000 and 20,000 Chinese American men, representing up to 22 percent of the men in their portion of the U.S. population, served during World War II. Of those serving about 40 percent were not citizens, and unlike Japanese and Filipino Americans, 75 percent served in non-segregated units. Chinese Americans distinguished themselves from Japanese Americans, and suffered less discrimination. A quarter of those would serve in the U.S. Army Air Forces, some of which were sent to the Chinese-Burma-India theater for service with the 14th Air Service Group and the Chinese-American Composite Wing. Another 70 percent would go on to serve in the U.S. Army in various units, including the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 32nd and 77th Infantry Divisions. Prior to the war, the U.S. Navy had recruited Chinese Americans but they had been restricted to serve only as stewards; this continued until May 1942, when restrictions ceased and they were allowed to serve in other ratings. In 1943, Chinese American women were accepted into the Women's Army Corps in the Military Intelligence Service. They were also recruited for service in the Army Air Force, with a few later becoming civilian Women Airforce Service Pilots. Captain Francis Wai of the 34th Infantry was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for actions on the island of Leyte in late 1944; this awarding was later elevated to a Medal of Honor in the 2000 review. Wilbur Carl Sze became the first Chinese American officer commissioned in the Marine Corps. Filipino Americans U.S. Army Brigadier General Vicente Lim, a Filipino American officer and West Point graduate served under Generals Douglas MacArthur and Jonathan Wainwright in the Philippines during World War II.

Crouched behind the foliage and clutching U.S. issued .30 caliber M1903 series rifles, are other members of the force who wait to assist the 11th Airborne force landing in front of the camp. From the beginning, the Philippines was on the front lines of the new war, as it was attacked shortly after Pearl Harbor. Under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, initially plans were made to defend all of the islands, but following the Japanese landings on Luzon, the US reinstated War Plan Orange and a hasty withdrawal to the Bataan Peninsula followed, denying Japan the use of Manila Bay. In March 1942, under orders from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, MacArthur departed the Philippines. In April 1942, Major General Edward P. King surrendered his force as they could no longer keep up a sustainable defense. Of the 75,000 that surrendered, about 63,000 were Filipinos, and a thousand were Chinese Filipinos. Forced to march to San Fernando, Pampanga, in what later came to be called the Bataan Death March, between 5,000 and 10,000 Filipinos died along the way. A smaller force held out at Fort Mills; however, after an assault, Lieutenant General Jonathan Wainwright surrendered the USAFFE forces that remained in the Philippines in May 1942. Of those who surrendered, 23 were Filipino officers who had graduated from West Point; Japanese forces executed six of these Filipino prisoners of war, including Vicente Lim, who had by then reached the rank of brigadier general. In the U.S., Filipinos were initially blocked from enlisting, until the laws were revised a day before Japan had begun its invasion back in the Philippines. Of the Filipinos who lived in California, two-fifths, or sixteen thousand Filipinos, attempted to enlist into the U.S. Army. Some would serve in non-segregated units, yet a segregated infantry battalion was established, which continued to grow and at its peak was split into two units known as the 1st and 2nd Filipino Infantry Regiments. These soldiers were subjected to discrimination during their time training at Camp Beale and Fort Ord, sometimes being mistaken for Japanese Americans when off base. Nevertheless, these units would serve with distinction similar to that of the 442d Infantry Regiment, although their deeds were not as well documented or widely known. By the end of the war, a total of 50,000 decorations, awards, medals, ribbons, certificates, commendations and citations had been awarded to personnel assigned to these two regiments for their service in the New Guinea and Philippines campaigns. Back in the Philippines, some individual service members and units refused to heed orders to surrender. They began a guerilla campaign to resist the Japanese occupation and were later joined by paroled Filipino USAFFE soldiers, as well as Filipino civilians, and other Allied forces that had been inserted into the islands. Allied forces returned to the Philippines in significant numbers during the Battle of Leyte. These included the Filipino infantry units which had been reduced in size from their peak. Later that year the Philippine Division was reconstituted,(Nota Bene: These combat chronicles, current as of October 1948, are reproduced from The Army Almanac: A Book of Facts Concerning the Army of the United States, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1950, pp. 510‚Äì592.) and in 1945 those members who elected to remain in the Philippines at the end of the war were transferred to the PC AUS. In all approximately 142,000 Filipinos served during World War II. When recognized guerrillas are taken into account, the number of Filipinos who served increases to over 250,000, and possibly up to over 400,000. This number though is smaller than that recognized for serving in World War II by the Philippines. Sergeant Jose Calugas became the third Asian American ever and first Asian American during World War II, to receive the Medal of Honor; he would not receive the medal until after the occupation had ended. Later, in the 2000 review of medals awarded to Asian Americans, First Lieutenant Rudolph Davila's Distinguished Service Cross was elevated to a Medal of Honor. While in New Guinea, Lieutenant Colonel Leon Punsalang became the first Asian American to command white troops in combat. For their actions in aiding Allied prisoners of war during the Japanese Occupation of the Philippines, Josefina Guerrero and Florence Finch were both awarded the Medal of Freedom; Finch later enlisted in the Coast Guard Women's Reserve after being liberated from the Philippines and taken to New York. Korean Americans Ahn family portrait Korean Americans who served in World War II|alt=From left to right, a Sailor, a Soldier, and a navy officer take a group photograph. After a treaty was signed in 1882, Koreans had begun migrating to the U.S. This came to an end when Japan annexed Korea in 1910. When the war began, Korean Americans were treated as enemy aliens, although this changed in 1943, when they were exempted from enemy alien status. About 100 enlisted in the U.S. Army over the course of the war, some of whom served as translators. Over a hundred joined the California State Guard in Los Angeles alone and formed a unit that became known as the \\"Tiger Brigade\\". Young-Oak Kim, who had initially been rejected by the Army before being drafted, served as an enlisted soldier in the engineers until he was selected for commissioning in 1943. He went on to serve in the mainly Japanese American 442nd Infantry Regiment, and he was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions at the Battle of Anzio. The only Korean American to be awarded that medal during the war, he also received a Silver Star and Purple Heart for actions earlier in the campaign. Fred Ohr, who initially enlisted as a trooper in the 116th Cavalry in 1938, became the only Korean American fighter ace of World War II, shooting down a total of six enemy aircraft and eventually rising to command the 52nd Fighter Group's 2d Fighter Squadron in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations. As of 8 March 2012, he is the only Korean American to achieve the status of ace, and for his actions, Ohr received several medals including the Silver Star with one bronze oak leaf cluster. Cold War Post World War II After the surrender of Japan, World War II came to an end, and the U.S. military began to demobilize. Millions of service-members were transported home, including the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. In 1946, the regiment was reviewed by President Truman who awarded them their seventh Distinguished Unit Citation. They were subsequently deactivated, but they were reorganized a year later as part of the U.S. Army Reserve. That same year, Truman signed the Rescission Act of 1946, which denied Filipinos who served during World War II in the Commonwealth military and guerrillas, benefits that were afforded to other veterans. With the consent of the Philippine government, 50,000 Philippine Scouts were authorized by Congress, retained, and recruited. As part of the Philippine Division, this force undertook occupation duty on Okinawa until 1947, when the Philippine Scouts were disbanded by presidential order after Truman came to view them as a mercenary organization. In 1947, the signing of the U.S.-Philippine Military Bases Agreement formalized Filipino enlistment in the U.S. Navy without immigrant credentials. In 1948, Truman ordered the desegregation of the U.S. military. Korean War Staff Sergeant Hiroshi Miyamura, a Japanese American U.S. Army soldier and POW with President Eisenhower, after receiving the Medal of Honor in 1953 for meritorious service in the Korean War Following Truman's order for the integration of the U.S. military, the majority of segregated Asian American units were disbanded by 1951. Many individuals continued to serve in integrated units following desegregation, although the exact number of Asian Americans who served during the Korean War has not been determined. Despite the official acceptance of the desegregation policy, some units, including the 100th Battalion, 442nd Infantry Regiment, and the 5th Regimental Combat Team, retained strong racial ties, with a predominant number of Asian Americans serving in these units. Alt URL Of the 36,572 who died during the Korean War, 241 were Asian Americans. One Asian American received the Medal of Honor for actions during the Korean War. This went to Japanese American Corporal Hiroshi Miyamura of the 7th Infantry Regiment; the awarding of the medal was initially made in secret, as at the time Miyamura was being held by North Koreans as a prisoner of war. Three brothers, Kurt Chew-Een Lee (the first Chinese American Marine officer), Chew-Mon Lee (an army infantry officer), and Chew-Fan Lee (an army medical service officer), all served in different units during the conflict and were awarded the Navy Cross, Distinguished Service Cross, and Bronze Star Medal respectively. Young-Oak Kim, having reenlisted and promoted to major, became the first ethnic minority to command a regular combat battalion, the 1st of the 31st Infantry. Walter Tsukamoto, who was first commissioned in 1927 and entered active duty in 1943, was sent from occupation duty in Japan to Korea in 1950 and was promoted to lieutenant colonel, the first Asian American to achieve that rank in the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, served as the senior ranking judge advocate for X Corps and was awarded two Bronze Star Medals for his service in Korea. Vietnam War Corporal Terry Kawamura a Japanese American U.S. Army soldier was with the 173rd Engineer Company, 173rd Airborne Brigade posthumously received the Medal of Honor for actions in 1969 at Camp Radcliff, B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, South Vietnam.|alt=Asian American male wearing Army Dress Green Uniform and glasses posing for a photo. During the Vietnam War 35,000 Asian Americans served as part of the more than eight million U.S. service personnel that were deployed to South Vietnam, in fully integrated units. Three of them were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, including Corporal Terry Kawamura who was, as of March 2014, the last Asian American to receive that medal. During the conflict, in addition to the Asian American personnel who served in conventional units, the Army also formed a special forces team of Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Native American Rangers called Team Hawaii, as they could pass for Vietnamese and conduct long range reconnaissance. Discrimination and racism continued to be experienced by Asian Americans who served during the conflict. Their loyalty was questioned, and during basic training they were sometimes described as being similar to Viet Cong. In country, some were fired upon when mistaken for Viet Cong, and some had medical care delayed after being mistaken for North Vietnamese. Additionally, the Viet Cong especially targeted Asian American service members, sometimes putting a price on their heads. Proportionally, Asian Americans suffered fewer casualties compared to other ethnic groups in Vietnam, with a total of 139 Asian American servicemen dying during the conflict. Many other then-future Asian Americans serve the military out of its normal ranks during the conflict. These included groups such as the Hmong and Laotians who fought alongside American service members in the Laotian Civil War, Vietnamese Americans who fought as members of the South Vietnam's armed forces, and Montagnard (also known as Degar) who assisted American forces. Throughout the war, Filipino American sailors remained restricted to the rating of steward, with 80% of the almost seventeen thousand Filipino American sailors being stewards. In 1970, there were more Filipinos serving in the U.S. Navy than there were in the Philippine Navy; that same year, the number of Filipinos recruited into the United States Navy was reduced from the thousands per year down to 35 a month, while Filipinos re-enlistment rates were 95% (which made them eligible for naturalization). The rating restriction ended in 1973, after the U.S. Senate investigated civil rights issues in the U.S. Navy and opened all ratings to Filipino Americans. In the White House, Filipinos Navy stewards, continued to serve as valets after the restriction was lifted, as late as into the 1990s. A few years later, in 1976, there were over seventeen thousand Filipino Americans in the U.S. Navy, including just under a hundred officers. By 1989, Asian Americans made up approximately 2.3 percent of the total armed services, slightly greater than their proportion of the total U.S. population at that time (1.6 percent). Persian Gulf War During the Persian Gulf War, many Asian Americans served in the U.S. military, with some filling senior officer positions, including Major General John Fugh who was promoted to the position of Army Judge Advocate General during the conflict. One Asian American service member died during the conflict. In 1992, the U.S. Navy stopped recruiting Filipino nationals due to the end of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement. 21st century Department of Defense Asian Pacific American Heritage Month luncheon in Arlington, Virginia|alt=Nine servicemembers representing the four active duty services, reserve components and the Coast Guard were presented the Federal Asian Pacific American Council's Military Meritorious Service Award during the Defense Department's Asian Pacific American Heritage Month luncheon and military awards ceremony in Arlington, Va., 2 June. Recent trends show that Asian Americans, particularly those from California, are enlisting at rates greater than their proportion of population; they are more likely to take up non-combat jobs. In 2009, the Army had Asian Americans serving as 4.4 percent of its commissioned officers, and 3.5 percent of its enlisted personnel. In 2008, Filipinos made up the largest immigrant population servicing in the U.S. Military, with Korean immigrants also serving in significant numbers. In 2010, Asian Americans made up 3.7 percent of active duty service members, mostly in the Army and Navy, and 3.9 percent of the officers. In 2012, there were about 65,000 immigrants serving in the U.S. armed forces; of those, about 23 percent were from the Philippines. Due to the numerous Filipinos serving in the Navy, when seen together, they've been described as the \\"Filipino Mafia\\". Alt URL , Filipinos made up the largest immigrant population serving in the U.S. Military. That same year, it was found that Asian Americans are over represented in the military compared to their proportion of the total population, and were increasingly choosing to become commissioned officers over choosing to enlist. Yet in 2013, it was found that Asian Americans are under represented in the Marine Corps, leading to a targeted effort to recruit more Asian Americans into the Corps. War on Terrorism , out of the 2,346 deaths that have occurred in Operation Enduring Freedom, 62 have been Asian Americans (47 Soldiers, 8 Marines, 6 Sailors, and 1 Airman). , an additional 390 Asian American service-members have been wounded (307 Soldiers, 58 Marines, 18 Sailors, and 7 Airmen).

In 2011, Private Danny Chen and Lance Corporal Harry Lew both committed suicide in Afghanistan following hazing; prosecution of several of their unit members followed. Also in 2011, Petty Officer, third class Jonathan Kong, as a corpsman risked his life to save Corporal Michael Dawers who had been shot in a battle near the village of Kotozay; in 2014, Kong was awarded a Silver Star for his actions in 2011 Iraq War RQ-7 at Camp Taji|alt=Sgt.

Hundreds of Asian Americans have deployed to Iraq out of the 59,000 plus that are serving in active duty as of May 2009, with one study stating that 2.6 percent have been Asian American. The 100th Infantry Battalion (USAR) was activated in 2004 for its first deployment in Iraq, their first activation since the Vietnam War. At the end of that deployment the unit was authorized to wear the 442nd's shoulder sleeve insignia as a combat patch, the first time this had occurred since World War II. The 100th Infantry Battalion was activated, and deployed to Iraq, for second time from 2008 to 2009. With Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn having ended, 78 Asian American service members died during the conflict. Leadership Albert Lyman, first Asian American general officer was of part Chinese and Hawaiian roots|alt=Portrait of a Chinese Hawaiian American in United States Army uniform circa 1942. The first Asian American general was Brigadier General Albert Lyman, who was part Chinese and Hawaiian American. He was followed by Rear Admiral Gordon Chung-Hoon, the first Asian American flag officer. The highest ranked is former Secretary of Veteran Affairs Eric Shinseki, who was a four-star general, and Army Chief of Staff. In recent years, Asian Americans have been significantly overrepresented at the military academies compared to their share of the national population. Although Asian/Pacific Islander Americans are 3.49% of the national population aged 18‚Äì24, they are about 9‚Äì10% of the classes of 2014 at West Point, the Naval Academy, and the Air Force Academy.

GPSS is made up of two senators from each degree-granting department, four officers and several staff members. GPSS provides students with representation on the University's Seattle campus, in the state legislature, and in Congress. It also acts as a resource center and funds graduate programming. History The Graduate & Professional Student Senate was founded in 1967 to provide a separate focus and voice for the interests of graduate and professional students at the University of Washington. Prior to its founding, all students were represented by the Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW), founded in 1906. As interests between the ASUW and GPSS have become more specialized, GPSS has established itself as an organization devoted to serving as a platform for issues related to graduate and professional student life. The two entities formally became two autonomous organizations in April 1976. While the ASUW still represents all students, GPSS represents only graduate and professional student interests. In 2007 GPSS initiated an annual Higher Education Summit, bringing together academics, policymakers, and practitioners to discuss issues important to higher education and graduate & professional students. Each summit has taken up a different topic related to contemporary issues in higher education in Washington State. In 2008 GPSS was one of the founding members of Student Advocates for Graduate Education (SAGE), a national coalition of graduate student governments from other top tier public research universities. Composition GPSS is governed by a Constitution and a set of Bylaws. Meetings of the Senate are typically held every other week throughout the school year. GPSS has five elected officers: President, Vice-President of External Affairs, Vice-President of Internal Affairs, Treasurer, and Secretary.

The newspaper Airline Journal reported that flying over Brioude, Gilbert was shot at by an eighty-three year old farmer who took him for \\"Baret Lou\\", a demonic bird of prey that casts a curse on crops. Gilbert responded by dropping pamphlets for an advertising campaign \\"Our future is in the Air\\" organized by the Michelin firm to promote the military use of aviation. These the farmer interpreted to be feathers of the bird raining down. On 24 April 1913 Gilbert made a record nonstop cross- country flight of 826 km (523 miles) from Villacoublay, France, to Vitoria- Gasteiz, Spain, in 8 hours 23 minutes.Daniel, Clifton, ed., Chronicle of the 20th Century, Mount Kisco, New York: Chronicle Publications, 1987, , p. 171. In June 1914 he won the International Michelin Cup completing a circuit of France in 39h 35m including stoppages. By 1915, Gilbert was in uniform as a combat pilot with Escadrille MS23. Like fellow French pre-war pilot Adolphe P√©goud, Gilbert was one of the first pilots to become an ace, an aviator who has shot down five or more enemy aircraft. On 27 June 1915 Gilbert was interned after force landing his Morane-Saulnier fighter in Switzerland after bombing the zeppelin sheds at Friedrichshafen. He later succeeded in escaping from captivity and returning to France.The End of M. GilbertFlight 23 May 1918 He was killed on 17 May 1918 when test-flying a new aircraft at Villacoublay.

The province of Rai had a suffragan diocese for Gurgan.  Background  In Tabaristan (northern Iran), the diocese of Rai (Beth Raziqaye) is first mentioned in 410, and seems to have had a fairly uninterrupted succession of bishops for the next six and a half centuries. Bishops of Rai are first attested in 424 and last mentioned towards the end of the eleventh century.Fiey, M√©die chr√©tienne, 378‚Äì82; POCN, 124 An East Syriac diocese was established in the Sassanian province of Gurgan (Hyrcania) to the southeast of the Caspian Sea in the fifth century for a community of Christians deported from Roman territory.Fiey, POCN, 85‚Äì6 The bishop Domitian 'of the deportation of Gurgan', evidently from his name a Roman, was present at the synod of Dadisho ø in 424, and three other fifth- and sixth-century bishops of Gurgan attended the later synods, the last of whom, Za øura, was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576.Chabot, 285, 315, 328 and 368 The bishops of Gurgan probably sat in the provincial capital Astarabad.Fiey, POCN, 85‚Äì6 The diocese of Rai was raised to metropolitan status in 790 by the patriarch Timothy I. According to Eliya of Damascus, Gurgan was a suffragan diocese of the province of Rai in 893. It is doubtful whether either diocese still existed at the end of the thirteenth century. The last-known bishop of Rai,  øAbd al-Masih, was present at the consecration of  øAbdisho ø II in 1075 as 'metropolitan of Hulwan and Rai', suggesting that the episcopal seat of the bishops of Rai had been transferred to Hulwan. According to the Mukhtasar of 1007/08, the diocese of 'Gurgan, Bilad al-Jibal and Dailam' had been suppressed, 'owing to the disappearance of Christianity in the region'.Fiey POCN, 86  The Diocese of Rai  The bishop David of Rai was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho ø in 424.Chabot, 285 The priest Abraham 'of the great church of Aksondnokre' was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Acacius in 486, on behalf of the bishop Joseph of Rai.Chabot, 307 The priest and secretary Aha√Ø was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497, on behalf of the bishop Joseph of Rai.Chabot, 315 The bishop Daniel 'of the Raziqaye' adhered by letter to the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554.Chabot, 366 The bishop Ahron, 'metropolitan of the Raziqaye', was previously a disciple of Sabrisho ø of Beth Qoqa, who died c.650.History of Mar Sabrisho ø of Beth Qoqa, 188 The bishop Mark of Beth Bgash was appointed metropolitan of Rai by the patriarch Yohannan III immediately after his consecration on 15 July 893.Sliba, 80 (Arabic) The metropolitan  øAbd al-Masih of 'Hulwan and Rai' was present at the consecration of  øAbdisho ø II in 1075, and died at an unknown date during his reign.Mari, 130 (Arabic), 114 (Latin)  The Diocese of Gurgan  The bishop Domitian of 'the deportation of Gurgan' was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Dadisho ø in 424.Chabot, 285 The bishop Abraham of Gurgan was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Baba√Ø in 497.Chabot, 315 The bishop Peter of Gurgan was deposed by the patriarch Mar Aba I in 540.Fiey, POCN, 86 The bishop Za øura of Gurgan was among the signatories of the acts of the synod of Ezekiel in 576.Chabot, 368  Notes   References   Assemani, J.

His mother was Rose Valenzuela and his father, Arthur Van Haren Sr., a popular boxing judge and baseball umpire who was inducted into the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame. Arthur Jr. shared his father's passion for sports becoming a star quarterback at Phoenix Union High School and playing for Coach Pop McKale at the University of Arizona.

Van Haren Jr. joined the Navy at the beginning of World War II, and was part of the famous U.S. Navy Fighting Squadron Two (VF-2) Rippers. VF-2 was featured in the October 23, 1944 Life Magazine edition as the \\"ace makers\\" squadron. Van Haren Jr. completed his naval aviation training in 1942. However, he was considered to be such a good pilot that the Navy made him a flight instructor, and he spent over a year teaching other Naval aviators how to fly. That year as a flight instructor proved to be invaluable to Van Haren Jr. He was able to sharpen his flying and air gunnery skills and, at the same time, the U.S. Navy was in the process of moving from the F4F Wildcat to a more superior aircraft‚Äîthe Grumman F6F Hellcat‚Äîas a way to better compete against and outclass the Japanese Zero.

The U-shaped 775-seat theatre is almost entirely covered with wood-panelling. It has three balconies, and its floor can be raised to convert the auditorium into a ballroom. The original theater curtain is a painting of the Puente de la Concordia over the Yumur√≠ River. The lobby is graced by Carrara marble statues of Greek goddesses and the main hall ceiling bears paintings of the muses.  History  Sauto Theater in 1866, El Museo Universal When it opened in 1863, it was named Teatro Esteban, after the Civil Governor of Matanzas at the time, Pedro Esteban y Arranz. But soon it adopted the last name of Ambrosio de la Concepci√≥n Sauto, a patron of the arts who contributed much to its construction and splendour. Due to the proximity of Matanzas to Havana, the cultural awareness of its people, and the solvency of its rich landowners, the Sauto Theater was visited regularly by the great performers who appeared in Havana. The Sauto attracted world famous performers such as French actress Sarah Bernhardt (in Camille in 1887), Russian dancer Anna Pavlova in 1945, Cuban composer Jos√© White Lafitte, Italian opera singer Enrico Caruso, and Spanish guitarist Andr√©s Segovia. The theatre today Besides being a sub-venue for important international events held in the capital, such as the International Ballet Festival and Mayo Teatral, the Sauto presents programmes about five days a week. Considered the most elegant and functional of 19th-century Cuban theatres, it has become a symbol of the city, so much so that the great Mexican muralist Diego Rivera once said, \\"I recognize Matanzas by the Sauto.\\" The theatre was declared a National Monument in 1978.

Manrique P√©rez de Lara (died 1164) was a magnate of the Kingdom of Castile and its regent from 1158 until his death. He was a leading figure of the House of Lara and one of the most important counsellors and generals of three successive Castilian monarchs: Alfonso VII (1126‚Äì57), Sancho III (1157‚Äì58) and Alfonso VIII (1158‚Äì1214). Parentage Manrique's father was Pedro Gonz√°lez de Lara (died 1130).Barton, 264‚Äì65, provides an overview of Manrique's immediate family, public career and important private acts with documentary source citations and a brief bibliography. Of Pedro's rule and Manrique's succession to his position of honour and leadership in the Reconquista, a contemporary writes: > He took after his father in everything that he did. His father was Count > Pedro of Lara, who ruled his own land for many years. The son also follows > in all his father's footsteps. Still in the flower of youth, but enriched > with honour and respected by the Emperor as is his nature, he was the > upholder of the law, the worst scourge of the Moors.Prose translation in > Barton and Fletcher, 261. Their verse numbering differs from that Lipskey, > 176, The Poem of Almer√≠a, vv. 315‚Äì19, whose translation is reproduced here > for comparison: > > >> He [Pedro] governed his own land for many years. His son followed in the steps of his father. For this reason he was enriched with honor in the flower of his youth and respected by the Emperor [Alfonso VII]. It was his rule to be witness to the law and to be an evil plague to the Moors. Manrique's mother Eva is of unknown parentage, but had previously been married to count Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez. Older historians speculated that she was daughter of Pedro Fr√≥ilaz de Traba and his wife Mayor de Urgell, in part to explain his political interests associated with the county of Urgell, but this is untenable.S√°nchez de Mora, pp. 97-99 Her own non-Iberian name and that of her son ManriqueLatin Almanricus/Amalricus, French Aimery; see Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s, 102, who spells Manrique's name in Spanish Almanric or Malric. seem to point to an origin north of the Pyrenees. Several theories have been put forward, including making her a daughter of Aimeric V, viscount of Rochechouart, one of the French barons who had joined the Siege of Tudela in 1087, or of Hugh II, Count of Emp√∫ries, and his wife Sancha de Urgell.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n, pp. 757-758 The first mention of Manrique's parents' marriage dates from November 1127, and must have occurred after 1108, when Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez was killed.Barton, 229 n2. Manrique had three full brothers: √Ålvaro, Nu√±o and Rodrigo. He also had three half-siblings, Elvira and Fernando, children of his father's liaison with Queen Urraca, and count Garc√≠a Garc√©s de Aza, son of his mother's first marriage. Count Pedro had two documented daughters, Milia, wife of G√≥mez Gonz√°lez de Manzanedo, and Mar√≠a. Their maternity is not explicitly documented, but at least Milia was probably a full sister of Manrique.S√°nchez de Mora, pp. 202-203. Milia has traditionally been listed as daughter of Manrique, but a contemporary document makes her his sister, giving her the patronymic Petriz, i.e. daughter of Pedro. Barton, p. 280, gives Pedro another daughter by Eva, named Mayor, but she is not mentioned in S√°nchez de Mora's exhaustive survey of the family. Another royal charter issued by Manrique under exceptional circumstances in 1156. Note the imperial signum in the bottom centre. Count and tenente (1145‚Äì1158) Between 26 December 1134 and 2 June 1137 Manrique served as alf√©rez, that is, head of the military household, of Alfonso VII. This post was usually reserved for young noblemen with promising career prospects. In 1143 Manrique was granted the tenencia (or honor, a fief governed on behalf of the crown) of Atienza, and in 1144 he received those of √Åvila,According to one historian he received √Åvila in 1133, but the documentary sources to do not support this conclusion, Barton, 264 n10. Madrid and Toledo. Madrid he only governed until the next year (1145) and √Åvila until 1150. On 21 August 1145 Manrique was made a count, the highest rank in the kingdom, by Alfonso VII in the ancient capital city of Le√≥n. A charter survives that reads: \\"Manrique the same day this charter was made was made a count\\".Barton, 264 n4: Amalricus ipso die quo hec carta facta fuit factus comes. Although it was common for aristocratic sons to accede to the titles of their fathers on the latters' deaths, Manrique had to wait fifteen years to receive the comital title from the king. While he continued to rule Atienza and Toledo, he also received the tenencias of Medinaceli in 1146. That year Alfonso sent him, Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera, Ermengol VI of Urgell, and Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez de Hita to help the king's Muslim ally Sayf al-Dawla regain the cities of Baeza, Ja√©n and √öbeda.Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris, II, ¬ß191, in Lipskey 154‚Äì55. This they succeeded in doing, but they soon quarrelled with Sayf and fighting ensued, during which Sayf was defeated and his submission to Alfonso reinforced.Barton, 175. In January 1147 Manrique played a key r√¥le in the capture of Calatrava, a fact the king acknowledged in a charter drawn up on 9 January. In August Manrique took part in the reconquest of Almer√≠a and its hinterland, which included the taking of Baeza, which he immediately received from the king as a tenencia.His rule in Baeza had begun by 18 August, cf. Barton, 151 n13. He is highly praised by the anonymous author of the Poema de Almer√≠a, who cites his splendour and generosity ahead of his wisdom and valour: > Count Manrique, a sincere friend of Christ, valiant in warfare, is placed in > charge of all these towns [And√∫jar, Ba√±os, Bayona and Baeza]. He was liked > by all, just as he was liked by the Emperor, so that he shone among the > Saracens and Christians alike. Illustrious in reputation and beloved by all, > bountiful and generous, he was niggardly to no man. He was skilled in arms, > he possessed the mind of a sage, he delighted in battle and was a master of > the science of war.Prose translation in Barton and Fletcher, 261. Their > verse numbering differs from that Lipskey, 176, The Poem of Almer√≠a, vv. > 305‚Äì14, whose translation is reproduced here for comparison: > > >> Count Manrique de Lara is made governor of these cities. He is a celebrated warrior and a true friend of Christ. He is pleasing to all including the Emperor, so that he stands out among the Moors and the Christians. Illustrious in his fame, he is loved by all. Splendid and generous, he was mean with no one. He was distinguished in the art of war, and he had the mind of a sage. He rejoiced in battle and possessed a great knowledge of military affairs. He imitated his father, Count Pedro de Lara, in all that he did. This emphasis was typical in the period, when generosity, munificence and prodigality were considered signs of greatness, and the rewarding of followers was essential to maintaining one's power.Barton, 91. In Baeza, Manrique's rule can be traced for a decade, until 1157. In 1148 he received the tenencia of Segovia. In November 1148 Manrique and others of his family donated some houses in Toledo, which he ruled at the time, to Gonzalo de Mara√±√≥n. It is a sign of the diversity of his interests that he owned urban properties in the most important city in the kingdom. Romanesque cathedral of Sig√ºenza enjoyed the patronage of Manrique P√©rez In 1149 Manrique was entrusted with the tutorship of the king's eldest son and heir, the future Sancho III, who was raised in his household.This charge can be dated from 1 March that year, cf. Barton, 264 n6. Some indication of the size of Manrique's household‚Äîcourt is perhaps the better word‚Äîis given by the fact that he employed at least two individuals, Gonzalo Pel√°ez and Garc√≠a D√≠az, in the post of alf√©rez in 1153 and 1156 respectively.Barton, 59. Manrique is also known to have employed a chaplain (capellanus). In 1153 this office was filled by a certain Sebastian, who was also acting as Manrique's scribe when needed. By November 1155 he had hired a clerk named Sancho who signed his documents as \\"chancellor\\". In February 1152 Manrique encouraged the settlement of Balaguera and Cedillo in the Extremadura by dividing his property there amongst some settlers.This act appears, edited, in its original Latin, in Barton, 313‚Äì14. Sometime before December 1153, Manrique married Ermessinde, daughter of Aimeric II of Narbonne and a cousin of Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona. She bore him children: Aimerico, Ermengarda, Guillermo (William), Mar√≠a, Pedro and Sancha.S√°nchez de Mora, 309-351. On 5 December 1153, in their first recorded action as husband and wife, Manrique and Ermessinde gave the village of Cobeta to the Benedictine monasteries of Arlanza, San Salvador de O√±a and Santo Domingo de Silos,Barton names Silos on p. 264, but San Pedro de Carde√±a on p. 60. and the cathedral of Santa Mar√≠a in Sig√ºenza, at the time under construction according to a Benedictine plan. The charter of this donation was drawn up by Sebastian. It survives with tags which once attached a seal, now lost.Barton, 60‚Äì61. It is possible, though unlikely, that the seal was a later addition and did not emanate from Manrique's chancery. Manrique may have been the first member of the Castilian nobility to employ a seal to authenticate documents. The royal chancery had only been employing them from 1146, though episcopal chanceries had already adopted them under French influence (1140).Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s, 103. Manrique's marital connexion with the rulers of Narbonne may have influenced his decision, and his seal was probably based on the type used in Languedoc at the time. In 1163, when the chancery of the young Alfonso VIII adopted a seal, it was probably based on Manrique's. The earliest surviving aristocratic seal from Castile is one of Manrique's son Pedro, from document of 1179 drawn up at Calatayud.Barton, 60‚Äì61.Fletcher, 98 and 106 n92. A look at the earliest seals of Alfonso VIII and Pedro Manrique suggests that Manrique's own seal showed an armed, stylised, equestrian figure patterned after Anglo-French designs, but left-facing in the Mediterranean fashion.Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s, 101‚Äì119. The extensive fortifications of Molina, Manrique's semi-independent fief, to which he granted a fuero in 1154. On 21 April 1154 Manrique and Ermessinde issued a sweeping fuero to the town of Molina de Arag√≥n.For the date, cf. Barton, 265 n27. The document survives only in a thirteenth-century copy, and it may have been amended in light of later twelfth-century fueros, although much of its material has precedents in the early twelfth century. It lists the privileges of the inhabitants, the rents owed to Manrique, a list of officials who would serve on the municipal council and an extensive legal code.Barton, 102. A large portion of the law deals with the formation of the local militia. Knights (caballeros) who lived in the town with their families for a certain period of the year were exempted from taxes. A fifth of the booty taken by the local militia in war was to go to Manrique, and those who skipped out on their military obligations were fined. Unprecedentedly (and perhaps suspiciously), a maintenance was paid to those who captured Muslim leaders in battle and had to temporarily support them before they were handed over to the king. The fuero also mandated watchtower duty, a medical allowance for wounds received in war, the use of battle standards, and standards of military equipment for both cavalry and infantry. Also without precedent is a law requiring all those with a certain amount of wealth to purchase a horse and serve in the militia as a knight. If the thirteenth-century copy is accurate to the original, the fuero of Molina marks a transition in the customary law martial law of the peninsula, especially of Castile and Aragon.Powers, 36. The semi-independent nature of the rule of Manrique and his successors at Molina has been likened to the rule of Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar at Valencia two generations earlier and to the contemporary rule of Pedro Ruiz de Azagra in Albarrac√≠n. Manrique even used the formula Dei gratia comes (\\"count by the grace of God\\"), implying that his power did not derive from the king.Duggan, 94, citing Luis Salazar y Castro. When the lordship passed to the crown through the marriage of Mar√≠a de Molina and Sancho IV, Molina was retained as a subsidiary title until the time of Isabel II.Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s, 101‚Äì02. In November 1155 Manrique bought the vill of Alcolea from Garc√≠a Garc√©s de Aza for 1,000 maraved√≠s, a sign of his wealth.The charter of this transaction was drawn up at Ayll√≥n by Sancho (Sancius cancellarius comite Almarich). Sancho was still working for Manrique the next year (1156), cf. Barton, 60. It is a sign of his power influence that in 1156 he, as governor (tenente) of Baeza and its entire district, was, under exceptional circumstances, conceded by the king the right to make three grants of reconquered (and thus royal) land to his supporters in the region, as part of the programme of repopulation. The charters, which did not require the confirmation of any members of the royal court, were drawn up by Manrique's scribe and authenticated with Manrique's seal.The documents are edited in S√°nchez Belda, 58‚Äì61. It is probable that the exceptional circumstances which led Alfonso to leave the function of the royal chancery in the hands of Manrique and his household staff was the pressing need to secure the region against the threatening Almohads.S√°nchez Belda, 47‚Äì57. That same year (1156), Manrique was entrusted with the tenencia of Burgo de Osma, which he subinfeudated to his vassal Diego P√©rez as alcalde.Barton, 92. Manrique was also governing the Mediterranean port city of Almer√≠a (near Alcolea) in January 1157. Later that year both Almer√≠a and Baeza were lost to the Almohads.Doubleday, 35. In August that year, Alfonso VII died. According to the De rebus Hispaniae, written by a Navarrese cleric, Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada, a century later, the division of Alfonso VII's empire between his heirs was a result of the evil counsel of Manrique P√©rez de Lara and Fernando P√©rez de Traba, who together \\"aimed to sow the seed of discord\\".Barton, 18‚Äì19. There is evidence that the division was planned as early as 1143, two years before Manrique was raised to the rank of count. Alfonso's elder son, Sancho, succeeded in Castile and Toledo, while his second son, Ferdinand II, succeeded in Le√≥n and Galicia. Sancho died on 31 August 1158 and Manrique became regent and guardian of the child king Alfonso VIII. At least one later account with a pro-Leonese bias, the Chronicon mundi of Lucas de Tuy, asserts that Ferdinand II became regent and protector of Alfonso VIII, but this is a fabrication.Dyer, 150‚Äì51. Regency of Castile (1158‚Äì1164) In the dispute over Alfonso VIII's regency that followed Sancho's death, the Lara family forced the Castro family into exile, igniting a civil war. Rodrigo Jim√©nez, perhaps relying on a popular legend, states that Manrique had the body of Gutierre Fern√°ndez de Castro disinterred and held as a ransom. In January 1160 he took over the government of the Extremadura on behalf of the crown, all the while continuing to hold Atienza and Toledo. In March 1160 the exiled Castro leader, Fernando Rodr√≠guez, returned to confront the Laras and their allies in the Battle of Lobregal. The Castros were victorious, and Manrique's brother Nu√±o was captured, but the Laras were not displaced.Barton, 154. By March 1161 the guardianship of the young Alfonso, initially held by Gutierre Fern√°ndez, followed by Garc√≠a Garc√©s de Aza, was being exercised by Manrique, who was styled nutritius regis (\\"nurturer of the king\\")Barton, 264 n7. and manente super negotia regni (\\"manager over the affairs of the kingdom\\").Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s, 104. In 1162 Manrique lost the tenencias of Atienza and Toledo and was placed in San Esteban de Gormaz. Abbey of Huerta, where Manrique was buried. Manrique was killed by Fernando Rodr√≠guez at the Battle of Huete, a repeat of the disaster of Lobregal, in 1164, but the day of this battle is uncertain. The Anales toledanos primeros date it to 9 July and note Manrique's death: \\"They killed Count Manrique on the ninth day of the month of July in the Era 1202 [AD 1164].\\"In Fl√≥rez, 391: Mataron al Conde Manrich en IX. dias del mes de Julio Era MCCII. There is a charter dated 21 June 1164, an earlier source than the Anales, that places the battle on 3 June: > . . .in the year this charter was written when Fernando Rodr√≠guez with those > of Toledo and of Huete fought with the count Don Manrique and this same > count Don Manrique was killed, and many other Castilians [with him]. . . > This charter was made on the fifth day of the week, the eleventh kalends of > July [Thursday, 21 June]. Under the Era 1202 [AD 1164]. Fifteen and three > days before this charter was made [3 June] Count Don Manrique and his > knights were killed.Quoted in Barton, 264 n1: . . .in illo anno fuit ista > carta scripta quando Fernando Rodriz con los de Toleto et de Uepte lidio con > el comite don Marric et fuit mortuus ibi el comite don Marric, et alios > castellanos multos. . . Facta carta notu die Va feria XI kalendas iulii. Sub > Era MCCII. Quindecim et tres dies antea fuit ista carta facta quam mortuus > fuisset Comite don Marric et suos milites. Manrique was buried in the Cistercian abbey of Santa Mar√≠a de Huerta, founded by Alfonso VII in 1147 and destined to be heavily patronised by the Lara family. His widow, Ermessinde, was still alive as late as 1175, when she donated property in Molina de Arag√≥n to her grandson Garc√≠a P√©rez and to the Order of Calatrava. She also made many donations to Santa Mar√≠a de Huerta and to the Praemonstratensian monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de La Vid. Besides Calatrava, she patronised the Knights Hospitaller. She founded a Praemonstratensian convent at Brazacorta.Barton, 201. Notes Bibliography *Simon Barton. The Aristocracy in Twelfth-century Le√≥n and Castile.

Separable permutations may be characterized by the forbidden permutation patterns 2413 and 3142;; , Theorem 2.2.36, p. p.58. they are also the permutations whose permutation graphs are cographs and the permutations that realize the series-parallel partial orders. It is possible to test in polynomial time whether a given separable permutation is a pattern in a larger permutation, or to find the longest common subpattern of two separable permutations. Definition and characterization A large typical separable permutation define a separable permutation to be a permutation that has a separating tree: a rooted binary tree in which the elements of the permutation appear (in permutation order) at the leaves of the tree, and in which the descendants of each tree node form a contiguous subset of these elements. Each interior node of the tree is either a positive node in which all descendants of the left child are smaller than all descendants of the right node, or a negative node in which all descendants of the left node are greater than all descendants of the right node. There may be more than one tree for a given permutation: if two nodes that are adjacent in the same tree have the same sign, then they may be replaced by a different pair of nodes using a tree rotation operation. Each subtree of a separating tree may be interpreted as itself representing a smaller separable permutation, whose element values are determined by the shape and sign pattern of the subtree. A one-node tree represents the trivial permutation, a tree whose root node is positive represents the direct sum of permutations given by its two child subtrees, and a tree whose root node is negative represents the skew sum of the permutations given by its two child subtrees. In this way, a separating tree is equivalent to a construction of the permutation by direct and skew sums, starting from the trivial permutation. As prove, separable permutations may also be characterized in terms of permutation patterns: a permutation is separable if and only if it contains neither 2413 nor 3142 as a pattern. The separable permutations also have a characterization from algebraic geometry: if a collection of distinct real polynomials all have equal values at some number , then the permutation that describes how the numerical ordering of the polynomials changes at is separable, and every separable permutation can be realized in this way., p. 15. Combinatorial enumeration The separable permutations are enumerated by the Schr√∂der numbers. That is, there is one separable permutation of length one, two of length two, and in general the number of separable permutations of a given length (starting with length one) is :1, 2, 6, 22, 90, 394, 1806, 8558, .... This result was proven for a class of permutation matrices equivalent to the separable permutations by , by using a canonical form of the separating tree in which the right child of each node has a different sign than the node itself and then applying the theory of generating functions to these trees. Another proof applying more directly to separable permutations themselves, was given by .See , Theorem 2.2.45, p. 60. Algorithms showed that it is possible to determine in polynomial time whether a given separable permutation is a pattern in a larger permutation, in contrast to the same problem for non-separable permutations, which is NP- complete. The problem of finding the longest separable pattern that is common to a set of input permutations may be solved in polynomial time for a fixed number of input permutations, but is NP-hard when the number of input permutations may be variable, and remains NP-hard even when the inputs are all themselves separable. History Separable permutations first arose in the work of , who showed that they are precisely the permutations which can be sorted by an arbitrary number of pop-stacks in series, where a pop-stack is a restricted form of stack in which any pop operation pops all items at once. considered separable permutations again in their study of bootstrap percolation, a process in which an initial permutation matrix is modified by repeatedly changing to one any matrix coefficient that has two or more orthogonal neighbors equal to one. As they show, the class of permutations that are transformed by this process into the all-one matrix is exactly the class of separable permutations. The term \\"separable permutation\\" was introduced later by , who considered them for their algorithmic properties. Related structures The separable permutation 43512 and its corresponding permutation graph Every permutation can be used to define a permutation graph, a graph whose vertices are the elements of the permutation and whose edges are the inversions of the permutation. In the case of a separable permutation, the structure of this graph can be read off from the separation tree of the permutation: two vertices of the graph are adjacent if and only if their lowest common ancestor in the separation tree is negative. The graphs that can be formed from trees in this way are called cographs (short for complement- reducible graphs) and the trees from which they are formed are called cotrees. Thus, the separable permutations are exactly the permutations whose permutation graphs are cographs. The forbidden graph characterization of the cographs (they are the graphs with no four-vertex induced path) corresponds to the two four-element forbidden patterns of the separable permutations. Separable permutations also closely related to series-parallel partial orders, the partially ordered sets whose comparability graphs are the cographs. As with the cographs and separable permutations, the series-parallel partial orders may also be characterized by four-element forbidden suborders. Every permutation defines a partial order whose order dimension is two, in which the elements to be ordered are the elements of the permutation, and in which x ‚â§ y whenever x has a smaller numerical value than y and is left of it in the permutation. The permutations for which this partial order is series-parallel are exactly the separable permutations. Separable permutations may also be used to describe hierarchical partitions of rectangles into smaller rectangles (so-called \\"slicing floorplans\\", used for instance in the design of integrated circuits) by using the positive and negative signs of the separating tree to describe horizontal and vertical slices of a rectangle into smaller rectangles.; The separable permutations include as a special case the stack- sortable permutations, which avoid the pattern 231.

The American School, as it is usually referred to by its students and the school community, is fully accredited by the Colombian Ministry of Education. The school's success is owing to its pedagogical approach, which allows the adaptation of the school programs to suit its students' individual learning needs, without disregarding the highest national and international educational benchmarks. Most of American School alumni have enrolled in the country's most prestigious higher learning centers, while some have gone to colleges in South America or Europe. The American School offers formal education for infants through 11th grade, which is the senior grade in Colombia.http://www.mineducacion.gov.co/1621/articles-85906_archivo_pdf.pdf Classes are taught in both English and Spanish. From preschool up to 9th grade, Social Studies, Science, Mathematics, Literature, and Language Arts are taught in English. That is why the American School students have fluent command of both Spanish and English. In 10th and 11th grades students work hard in their preparation for the ICFES test, SAT and TOEFL. Besides the bilingual program, the school offers its students plastic arts, dance, scenic arts, ballet, and sports courses.

It resulted in a German victory against the French army. The battle cut most of the roads and railways to the strategically important Fortified Region of Verdun ( [RFV]) and was to have a large effect on the course of the war.  Background  The Wo√´vre Plain stretches from the city of Luxemburg, south to the French city of Toul and has been a common route of attack between Germany and France. The plain is flanked on the western side by a series of mountain ranges (the Hauts de Meuse) along the Meuse River and along the eastern side by a series of mountain ranges along the Moselle River. A series of German fortifications were built before the war, along the Moselle (especially around the city of Metz), while across the border, a matching set of French fortifications was established along the Meuse around Verdun and Toul. In the first months of the First World War, the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL: German High Command) were the first ones to realise the increased effectiveness that artillery and machine-guns gave to the defence and seized various terrain features that would be easy to defend. Recognising that it is easier to defend the heights alongside the Meuse (as opposed to the plain between the Moselle and Meuse), a German attack was planned to seize the heights, to deny access to the Wo√´vre Plain to the Allies, isolate Verdun and reduce the ability of the French to attack German territory.  Battle  The attack commenced on 19 September, with German cavalry from Metz skirmishing with the French defenders in the Dieulouard‚ÄìMartincourt area. Flirey, the woods around the village and Seicheprey were quickly captured. French reinforcements arrived on 22 September but could not stop the Germans from advancing. The German advance then changed direction, moving from southerly to south-west. By 24 September, the town of Saint-Mihiel was captured and villages of Flirey, Seicheprey and Xivray recaptured. More French reinforcements arrived on 27 September but as the Germans were now firmly entrenched, French counter-attacks between Flirey and Apremont resulted in little change in the front line. French counter-attacks continued until 11 October.  Aftermath  The battle created a salient projecting into the French lines south of Verdun, named the St Mihiel Salient. Of the two roads and one railway that led to Verdun, all but a minor road were closed, which imposed severe supply difficulties on the French troops in the RFV. The city was enveloped on three sides and neutralised as a base for French offensive operations. The area was to see much fighting over the rest of the war. Despite attempts by the French to reduce the salient in the First Battle of Wo√´vre in early 1915, the First Offensive Battle of Verdun in late 1916 and the Second Offensive Battle of Verdun in 1917, the salient was not reduced until the Battle of Saint-Mihiel in September 1918.

This may be the last person to rule a realm, sometimes leading to a political crisis, or a change in government; other times power has already passed from the patrilineal family, leaving it in a less important position when it reaches its extinction. House of Aviz The House of Aviz, an illegitimate branch of its predecessor the House of Burgundy, ruled Portugal from 1385 to 1580; its last member was Henrique, Cardinal-King of Portugal (1512‚Äì1580), who succeeded his grand-nephew King Sebastian late in life. Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato would briefly rule Portugal shortly thereafter, but his illegitimate birth contests his claim to be considered a member of the House of Aviz. House of Bourbon (main line) The main line of the House of Bourbon, which had ruled France from 1589 to 1793 and from 1814 to 1830, became extinct with the death of Henri, comte de Chambord (1820‚Äì1883), grandson of King Charles X. The comte de Chambord was the last male-line descendant of King Louis XV, but many other lines of the house survive, including the Spanish Royal Family, the Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg, and pretenders to the thrones of numerous other European thrones, all descending from Henry IV of France and ultimately from Hugh Capet of the House of Capet. House of Bruce The Clan Bruce ruled Scotland from 1306 to 1371. Its last royal member was King David II (1324‚Äì1371), upon whose death without issue the throne passed to his nephew Robert Stewart. The Clan continues today through other lines that do not have patrilineal royal ancestry, although the current clan chief, Andrew Bruce, 11th Earl of Elgin, is descended from King Robert Bruce in the female line. House of Burgundy (Portuguese branch) A branch of the House of Burgundy, itself a branch of the House of Capet, was the first ruling house of the Kingdom of Portugal in 1139. Its last male member was King Ferdinand I (1345‚Äì1383), whose daughter Beatrice (1372‚Äì1408) was the disputed queen for two years, as well as queen of Castile and Le√≥n by marriage. Instead Ferdinand's illegitimate half-brother John, Grand Master of the Order of Aviz became king, forming the House of Aviz. House of Dunkeld The last member of the House of Dunkeld was King Alexander III (1241‚Äì1286), ending the family's rule over Scotland that had persisted since 1058. Alexander, the last male-line descendant of King Donnchad I, who ruled from 1034 to 1040, outlived his own children, leaving only his granddaughter (though his daughter) Margaret, Maid of Norway as heir; her death a few years later plunged Scotland into an interregnum. House of Habsburg Male members of the House of Habsburg held many regnal titles in Europe from the twelfth to eighteenth centuries, most importantly those of Holy Roman Emperor (and its German associate and predecessor titles) and King of Spain. Its last male scion was Emperor Charles VI (1685‚Äì1740). His daughter Maria Theresa of Austria (1717‚Äì1780), who succeeded to some of her father's titles by inheritance and gained power of the rest of her father's domains when her husband was elected Emperor, was the last member of the royal house. Her descendants, the House of Lorraine, continued to hold this power and were styled the House of Habsburg- Lorraine. House of Lancaster The House of Lancaster or Lancaster branch of the House of Plantagenet ruled England from 1399 to 1461 and again briefly in 1470-1471; its last scion was King Henry VI, who outlived his only son Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales. Henry VI also had claims to the French throne through the parentage of his mother Catherine of Valois and the conquests of his father King Henry V. See also House of Plantagenet. House of Luxembourg Long before the present Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was established, the House of Luxembourg was a powerful family in Germany, supplying several Holy Roman Emperors. The last of these was Sigismund (1368‚Äì1437), also King of Hungary and Bohemia. His daughter Elisabeth of Bohemia (1409‚Äì1442) survived him to become the last Luxembourg family monarch, ruling Hungary and Bohemia and also as German queen consort. A non-imperial branch of the House descended from Henry V, Count of Luxembourg ruled as French nobles until the death of Charles II, Duke of Brienne in 1608. House of Orange-Nassau The House of Orange-Nassau, which had ruled before the Napoleonic Wars as Princes of Orange, served as Kings of the Netherlands and Grand Dukes of Luxembourg from 1815. King-Grand Duke William III (1817‚Äì1890), who outlived his three sons, was the last male member of the house and the last person to rule both countries; his daughter Wilhelmina of the Netherlands (1880‚Äì1962) succeeded him as Queen, while Luxembourg passed to the House of Nassau-Weilburg. The house became totally extinct in the male line with Wilhelmina's death, but the name is still used by her descendants, who continue to rule. Houses of Plantagenet and York The last male member of the House of Plantagenet, which ruled England from 1154 to 1485 and had fluctuating control over parts of France, was Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick (1475‚Äì1499), a nephew of King Edward IV and great-great-grandson of King Edward III. His uncle King Richard III had been killed and replaced by Henry Tudor, who started his own royal dynasty and eventually had Warwick executed. The last legitimate male-line descendant of Henry II of England, first Plantagenet king, was Warwick's sister Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury (1473‚Äì1541), who was executed by Henry Tudor's son King Henry VIII. As descendants of the earliest Dukes of York, Edward and Margaret may also be considered the last scions of the House of York or York branch of the House of Plantagenet, which ruled England specifically from 1461 to 1485 (with a brief pause in 1470-1471). House of Stuart The last member of the House of Stuart was Henry Benedict Stuart (1725‚Äì1807), a Roman Catholic cardinal. He was the last legitimate male-line descendant of James VI and I, who became King of Scots in 1567 and King of England and Ireland in 1603. Another branch of the House of Stuart had ruled Scotland from 1371 (with the accession of Robert II) until 1567 (with the abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots). The House of Stuart was replaced temporarily from 1649 to 1660 by the Covenanters and permanently in 1714 when Queen Anne died without surviving children, although Henry Cardinal Stuart's grandfather King James II & VII had been dethroned in 1688 during the Glorious Revolution. The headship of the house is usually associated today with Franz, Duke of Bavaria of the House of Wittelsbach, the senior heir-general of James II & VII's sister Henrietta Anna, Duchess of Orl√©ans. Non-royal branches of the family still survive.

Late August and early September saw a series of syringe attacks on civilians. In response to the attacks, thousands of residents held protests for several days, resulting in the deaths of five people. In addition, the arrest and beating of several Hong Kong journalists during the protests attracted international attention. Syringe attacks and protests Armed police troops were deployed to maintain order in Urumqi in early September 2009, after huge civilian demonstrations and protests had broken out around major sites in the city According to Xinjiang police, attacks in which hundreds of individuals claim to have been stabbed with hypodermic needles began on 17 August. On 2 September, posters appeared around √úr√ºmqi saying that 418 people had reported being stabbed or pricked, referring to the attacks as a \\"serious terrorist crime\\", although the government had so far not produced evidence of any terrorist link. √úr√ºmqi authorities said that fewer than one in five of reported stabbings had left any obvious mark. A six-person People's Liberation Army medical review panel announced at a press conference: \\"In the patients we have seen in the last couple of days, there are many which we believe were not actually punctured with needles,\\" They believed the false reports were due to widespread fear and lack of medical knowledge. According to state media, witnesses say those who had been attacked include Hans and Uyghurs, although the BBC said Hans claimed that they were being targeted. In response to both concern over the attacks and dissatisfaction over the government's slowness in prosecuting people involved with the July riots, protesters took to the streets. Official media reported tens of thousands marching in the city centre on the morning of 3 September. The police dispersed the crowd with tear gas; five people died during the protests and 14 were injured. After the latest protest, the government announced a ban on all \\"unlicensed marches, demonstrations and mass protests\\".

Their pleas to the armed police to check their central government-issued press identification cards were ignored. The reporters complained of being handcuffed and detained for three hours. The Xinjiang authorities blamed the journalists for inciting the disturbance, saying they were \\"not acting appropriately, for example gesturing to the crowd\\"; they however, regretted the \\"alleged beating\\".

It then gives a dated, year-by-year pr√©cis of important events from 650 to 764 CE. For example, in 763 CE, Tibetan soldiers captured the Chinese capital of Chang'an for fifteen days when the ruling Tang dynasty was recovering from the An Lushan Rebellion.

She manages to escape and is able to bring with her only a heavy frying pan found in the ruins of the Rabbi's house. She travels across Russia, hoping to find freedom and safety, utilising the pan to cook what food she is able to find. As she travels, she is joined by various fellow-escapees from Russia. Every night, around the cooking fire, each traveller tells a tale from his or her life. Mrs Moses eventually finds sanctuary in Australia and marries a fellow (non-Jewish) Russian refugee.

Early in the second half, Von Gammon was on defense, and dove into the mass around Virginia's right tackle. Once the pile-up cleared, he lay there motionless. Two doctors in the stands came to his aid and determined he had a severe concussion. He was on his feet in a few minutes, however, and was being taken off the field by Coach McCarthy, when captain and later judge William B.

News spread of Von Gammon's death and the people were devastated as were the Virginia players.http://www.romegeorgia.com/history.html Roman History Legacy The Georgia Legislature was in session at the time and public opinion caused them to pass a bill to ban the sport of football in the state of Georgia. The bill would have ended the football programs of Georgia, Georgia Tech, and Mercer. The bill only needed the signature of Governor William Yates Atkinson to become a law. Rosalind Burns Gammon wrote a letter to her representative, which later was in the hands of the governor. She was saddened by her son's death, but did not want the sport outlawed. She mentioned in her letter how his two friends were killed in rock climbing and skating accidents, and how those sports were not banned. Gov. Atkinson vetoed the bill on December 7, 1897.http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/vongammon.htm Georgia Info His mother is known as the woman who saved college football in Georgia. In 1921, the University of Virginia team presented a plaque to the University of Georgia in honor of Von Gammon and his mother.

He was a pioneer in the unaccredited Therapeutic Boarding School industry who used cult doctrines as their philosophical base.

The ceremonial rights of passage, known as profeets, are similar in structure to the rights of passage found in indigenous cultures that transform tribe members into adults. Biography Wasserman participated in the now discredited cult Synanon. After starting work with troubled teens in his home in Palm Springs, California, Mel decided to sell his furniture business and invest in a school to help teenagers and cash in on the troubled teen industry. Success of the CEDU program was dramatic and it rapidly expanded into other specialized educational programs possibly due to the massive profit potential Mr. Wasserman realized by charging in excess of $6,000 per month per student while hiring non-credentialed troubled low-wage adults as staff. Although there is no proof of this, Mr. Wasserman allegedly surrounded himself with educators and professionals and educated himself in the field of adolescent behavior. The philosophy he brought to CEDU Education was strict adherence to his set of principles as administered to unsupervised teenagers by troubled former drug addicts and sexual deviants, notably accountability and boundaries, although the idea of boundaries was constantly blurred by adults sharing lurid tales of the adult teachers troubled past including drug and deviant sexual activity with captive minor children. He has been quoted as saying to students and parents, \\"Take away boundaries and bring in a sewer, a biker society.

The history is interwoven with the history of Brunei and the history of Malaysia, which Sabah was previously part of and is currently part of respectively. The earliest recorded history of Sabah being part of any organised civilisation began in the early 15th century during the thriving era of the Sultanate of Brunei. Prior to this, early inhabitants of the land lived in predominantly tribal societies, although such tribal societies had continued to exist until the 1900s. The eastern part of Sabah was ceded to the Sultan of Sulu by the Sultan of Brunei in 1658 for the former helping a victory over Brunei enemies, but many sources stated it had not been ceded at all. By the late 19th century, both territories previously owned by Sultan of Brunei and Sultan of Sulu was granted to British syndicate and later emerged as British North Borneo under the management of the North Borneo Chartered Company. Sabah became a protectorate of the United Kingdom in 1888 and subsequently became a Crown colony from 1946 until 1963, during which time it was known as Crown Colony of North Borneo. On 16 September 1963, Sabah merged with Malaya, Sarawak and Singapore (left in 1965) to form Malaysia.  Pre-historic Sabah  During the Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago, Sabah and the rest of Borneo island was connected to mainland Asia in a landmass known as the Sundaland. Subsequent deglaciation, which caused global sea level to rise, resulted in the Sundaland being submerged, separating Borneo from the rest of Asia. Earliest human settlement in the region is believed to have dated back about 20,000‚Äì30,000 years ago. These early humans are believed to be Australoid or Negrito people, but the reason for their sudden disappearance is unknown. Stone tools and artefacts have been found in Madai and Baturong caves and in the archaeological site in Lake Tingkayu near the district of Kunak which were estimated to date back from 28,000‚Äì17,000 years ago. The tools found there were considered advanced for its period. There was evidence of human cave-dwellings around 15,000‚Äì6,000 years ago. An ongoing 2012 study by Universiti Sains Malaysia and Sabah State Museum revealed the discovery of stone tools in Mansuli Valley near Lahad Datu believed to be 235,000 years old, and in another site in Kampung Lipasu, Bingkor believed to be at least 200,000 years old. These recent findings suggests that human settlement in Sabah and Malaysia have existed much earlier than previously thought, which is about 40,000 years ago in Niah Caves, Sarawak. The earliest ascertained wave of human migration, believed to be Austronesian Mongoloids, occurred around 5,000 years ago. This wave of migration is believed to represent the time when the indigenous hill people of present-day Sabah had first arrived, namely the Kadazan-Dusun, Murut and Orang Sungai, while Brunei Malays settlement appeared somewhat later. It is believed that some Australoid or Negrito people have interbred with later Mongoloid migrants and remained in Borneo, while others have migrated to other places such as Melanesia, the Lesser Sunda Islands and Australia continent. Some anthropologists such as S.G. Tan and Thomas R. Williams believe that the Mongoloids are said to originate from South China and Northern Vietnam, and are more closely related to a number of indigenous groups in the Philippines and Formosa (Taiwan) than to the indigenous peoples of neighbouring Sarawak and Kalimantan, These claims were also supported by the findings of Charles Hose and William McDougall in their account of the \\"Pagan Tribes of Borneo\\".  Pre-15th century  During the 7th century CE, a settled community known as Vijayapura, a tributary to the Srivijaya empire, was thought to have been the earliest beneficiary to the Bruneian Empire existing around the northeast coast of Borneo , founded by the Funan Prince among the early coastal Dusun people. Another kingdom which was suspected to have existed according to Chinese records beginning the 9th century was P'o-ni, also founded by the ancient Dusun people. It was believed that Po-ni existed at the mouth of Brunei River and was the predecessor to the Sultanate of Brunei. The Brunei Annals in 1410 mentioned about a Chinese settlement or province centring in the Kinabatangan Valley in the east coast surrounding Kinabatangan River founded by a man known as Ong Sum Ping. This is consistent with the recent discovery of timber coffins in the Agop Batu Tulug cave in the Kinabatangan Valley, belong to the Dusun Sukang tribe. The coffins, adorned with carvings believed to resemble similar cultural practices in China and Vietnam, are believed to date back from around 700 to 1,000 years ago (11th to 14th century). From the 14th century, the Majapahit empire expanded its influence towards Brunei and most of the coastal region of Borneo.  Bruneian Empire and the Sulu Sultanate  The extent of the Bruneian Empire in the 15th century, under Sultan Bolkiah rule. The Sultanate of Brunei began after the ruler of Brunei embraced Islam, and was established by the Bruneian Murut or Lun Bawang; some also suggested the Bisaya (Dusunic speaker) who established the early stage of Bruneian Empire. Some sources indicate that this had occurred around 1365 CE after the ruler, Awang Alak Betatar, converted into Islam and became known as Muhammad Shah. Other sources suggests that the conversion occurred much later around 1514 to 1521 CE, albeit, under the same person. During the same period, trade relations flourished, and intermarriages among the native peoples of Borneo with Chinese and Arab traders became common. The intermixing of blood resulted in a distinct breed both in physical stature and features. Prior to the expansion of the Sultanate of Brunei, most of the coastal region of Borneo then came under the rule of the Bruneian Empire during the reign of the fifth sultan known as Bolkiah between 1485‚Äì1524, with the Sultanate's thalassocracy extended over Sabah, Sulu Archipelago and Manila in the north, and Sarawak until Banjarmasin in the south. This was during the period when the Sultanate was in its 'golden era'. The extent of the Sultanate of Sulu in 1822. In 1658, the Sultan of Brunei ceded the northern and eastern portion of Borneo to the Sultanate of Sulu in compensation for the latter's help in settling the Brunei Civil War in the Brunei Sultanate. The Sultan of Brunei continued to loosely govern the west coast of Sabah. Many Brunei Malays migrated to this region during this period, although the migration has begun as early as the 15th century after the Brunei conquest of the territory. While the thalassocratic Brunei and Sulu sultanates controlled the western and eastern coasts of Sabah respectively, the interior region remained largely independent from either kingdoms. Since the late 18th century, the seafaring Bajau-Suluk people also arrived from the Sulu Archipelago and started to settling in the coasts of north and eastern Borneo. It is believed that they were fleeing from the oppression of the Spanish colonist in their region.  British North Borneo  Flag of the British North Borneo. The first recorded ascent to the highest peak of Mount Kinabalu was made in 1851 by Hugh Low. In 1964, the region was designated as Kinabalu National Park and it was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000. In 1761, Alexander Dalrymple, an officer of the British East India Company, concluded an agreement with the Sultan of Sulu to allow him to set up a trading post in the region. This plan, together with other attempts to build a settlement and a military station centring on Balambangan Island, proved to be a failure. A map by Dalrymple of North Borneo is exhibited in the National Museum of Scotland. There was minimal foreign interest in this region afterward and control over most parts of north Borneo seems to have remained loosely under the Sultanate of Brunei. In 1846, the island of Labuan on the west coast of Sabah was ceded to Britain by the Sultan of Brunei and in 1848 it became a British Crown Colony. Labuan became a base for British operations against piracy in the region. The first recorded ascent of Mount Kinabalu, the highest mountain in Borneo, was made in 1851 by British Malaya colonial administrator and naturalist Hugh Low. The highest peak and the deep gully of the mountain was later named after him. Joseph William Torrey been given a permission by the Sultanate of Brunei to operating from the entire northern portion of the island of Borneo from Sulaman on the west to river Pietan on the East and the states of Paitan, Sugot, Banggayan, Labuk, Sandakan, China Bantangan, Gagayan Mumiang, Benuni and Kimanis, together with the islands of Banguey, Palawan and Balabao on 24 November 1865. In 1865, the American Consul General of Brunei, Charles Lee Moses, obtained a 10-year lease over North Borneo from the Sultan of Brunei Abdul Momin. Ownership was then passed to an American Trading Company of Borneo owned by Joseph William Torrey, Thomas Bradley Harris and some Chinese merchants. They set up a base and settlement in Kimanis and the Sultan of Brunei appointed Torrey as \\"The Rajah of Ambong and Marudu\\". His fortress \\"Ellena\\" was located in Kimanis with hundreds of Iban trackers led by Lingkanad. Torrey returned to America in 1877 and died near Boston, Massachusetts, in March 1884. The rights of the trading company were then sold to Gustav Baron Von Overbeck, the Austro-Hungarian Consul in Hong Kong (though he was actually a German national), and he later obtained another 10-year renewal of the lease. The lease was subsequently converted into a cession via a treaty which was signed by the Sultan of Brunei Abdul Momin. In the treaty, the Sultan appointed Overbeck as \\"Maharajah of Sabah and Rajah of Gaya and Sandakan.\\" The treaty granted Overbeck the right over whole region of Sabah, including parts purporting to be the dominion of the Sulu Sultanate including Sandakan and Tawau. The treaty was signed on 29 December 1877 at the Brunei Palace. In 1880, Overbeck offered to trade the territory as a penal colony to the Kingdom of Italy, but with pressure from the British, the Italian government refused to the proposal and Britain acquired the region soon after. Similar offer were also made to Austria-Hungary and the German Empire. (Left) The first concession treaty was signed by Sultan Abdul Momin of Brunei, appointing Baron de Overbeck as the Maharaja Sabah, Rajah Gaya and Sandakan, signed on 29 December 1877. (Right) The second concession treaty was signed by Sultan Jamal ul-Azam of Sulu, also appointing Baron de Overbeck as Dato Bendahara and Raja Sandakan on 22 January 1878, approximately three weeks after signature of the first treaty. On the east coast of North Borneo near Sandakan, William Cowie, on behalf of Dent's company, negotiated and obtained a concession in perpetuity from the Sultan of Sulu over its holdings in this region in 1878. This concession was signed on 22 January 1878 in the palace of the Sultan of Sulu. The concession later became the subject of dispute by the modern republic of the Philippines regarding the historical connection with the eastern part of Sabah. The rights were subsequently transferred to Alfred Dent, who on 26 August 1881 formed the British North Borneo Provisional Association Ltd. On 1 November 1881, the British government granted a royal charter and the British North Borneo Chartered Company was subsequently formed. William Hood Treacher was appointed as the first British Governor of North Borneo, with Kudat became the first capital. As the population was too small to boost the territory economy, the company brought in Chinese people mainly Hakkas from Guangdong province to work as labourers in plantation farms. Most of the migrants settled in Kudat and Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu). The capital was moved to Sandakan in 1884 to capitalise on its potential of vast timber resources. In 1885, United Kingdom, Spain and Germany signed the Madrid Protocol of 1885. The purpose of the protocol was to recognise the sovereignty of Spain in the Sulu Archipelago and also for Spain to relinquish all claims it might have had over North Borneo. In 1888, North Borneo became a protectorate of the United Kingdom. Administration and control over North Borneo remained in the hands of the Company despite being a protectorate and they effectively ruled until 1942. Their rule had been generally peaceful except for some rebellions, including one led by the Bajau-Suluk leader Mat Salleh from 1894 to 1900,C.Buckley: A School History of Sabah, London, Macmillan & Co. Ltd., 1968 and another led by Antanum of the Muruts known as the Rundum resistance in 1915. Many Suluk people had moved to North Borneo during this period due to the Spanish invasion of the Sulu Archipelago. Beginning 1920, more Chinese migrants arrived from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and even Hebei after the British changed its immigration policy to stimulate the stagnant economy during that period. There was also Javanese migration into North Borneo beginning 1891 and subsequent recruitment of labourers by the British from 1907 onwards. Other significant migrants from present-day Indonesia into North Borneo consists of the Bugis people beginning 1890sKen Goodlet, Tawau : The Making of a Tropical Community, Opus Publication, 2010 and the Florenese people together with Timorese from Flores and West and East Timor respectively beginning in the early 1950s. The First Natives Paramount Leader was Pehin Orang Kaya-Kaya Koroh Santulan of Keningau \\"The father of former Sabah State Minister Tan Sri Stephen (Suffian) Koroh, and Sabah's fifth State Governor Tun Thomas (Ahmad) Koroh (the elder brother of Suffian)\\". Santulan which also a Pengeran, the father to Pehin Orang Kaya-Kaya Koroh was a Murut descendant of Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin, the 25th Sultan of Brunei.  Japanese occupation and Allied liberation  Labuan on 14 January 1942. As part of the Second World War Japanese forces landed in Labuan on 3 January 1942, and continued to invade the rest of North Borneo. From 1942 to 1945, Japanese forces occupied North Borneo, along with most of the island. Bombings by the allied forces devastated most towns including Sandakan, which was razed to the ground. Resistance against Japanese occupation was concentrated on the west and north coast of North Borneo. The resistance in Jesselton was led by Albert Kwok and Jules Stephens of the Kinabalu Guerillas. Another resistance was led by Panglima Alli from Sulug Island, off the coast of Jesselton. In Kudat, there was also some resistance led by Mustapha Harun. On 10 October 1943, the Kinabalu Guerrillas together with followers of Panglima Alli staged a surprise attack on the Japanese. The attack however was foiled. The 324 local residents who participated in the attacks, including Albert Kwok and Panglima Alli, were detained in Petagas and later executed on 21 January 1944. The site of the execution is today known as the Petagas War Memorial. In Keningau during World War II, Korom was a rebel and some said he was a Sergeant with the North Borneo Armed Constabulary. It was claimed that he spied for the Allied Forces by pretending to be working for the Japanese. He provided intelligence on Japanese positions and some credited him with the escape of 500 Allied POWs. Fighting alongside Korom in his platoon was Garukon, Lumanib, Kingan, Mikat, Pensyl, Gampak, Abdullah Hashim, Ariff Salleh, Langkab, Polos, Nuing, Ambutit, Lakai, Badau and many more including the Chinese. Japanese civilians and soldiers leaving North Borneo after the surrender of Japan to the Australian forces. In Sandakan, there was once a brutal POW camp run by the Japanese for British and Australian POWs from North Borneo. The prisoners suffered in agony in their first year of captivity under notoriously inhuman conditions, but much worse was to come through the forced marches of January, March and June 1945 (refer to Sandakan Memorial Park WWII POW Museum Records). Allied bombardments caused the Japanese to relocate the POW camp to inland Ranau, 260 km away. All the prisoners, who by then were reduced to 2,504 in number, were to be moved, but instead of transport, were forced to march the infamous Sandakan Death March. Sickness, disease, exhaustion, thirst, hunger, whipping, and shooting killed most of the prisoners, except for six Australians who successfully escaped, were never caught, and survived to tell the horrific story of the death march. The fallen of this march are commemorated each year on Anzac Day (Memorial Day) in Australia and in Sandakan, at the original POW campsite where a POW hut style museum and a black marble memorial obelisk monument are nestled in a peaceful park setting with a lily pond. The war ended with the official surrender by Lieutenant-General Baba Masao of the 37th Japanese Army in Labuan on 10 September 1945. After the surrender, North Borneo was administered by the British Military Administration and in 1946 it became a British Crown Colony. Until the Philippine independence on 1946, seven British-controlled islands in the northern coast of Borneo named Turtle Islands (including Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi and Mangsee Islands) were ceded to the Philippine government by the Crown colony government of North Borneo. Due to massive destruction in the town of Sandakan since the war, Jesselton was chosen to replace the capital with the Crown continued to rule North Borneo until 1963.  Self-government and the formation of Malaysia  Donald Stephens (left) declaring the formation of the Federation of Malaysia at Padang Merdeka, Jesselton on 16 September 1963. Together with him is the Deputy Minister of Malaya Tun Abdul Razak (right) and Mustapha Harun (second right). On 31 August 1963, North Borneo attained self-government. The idea for the formation of a union of the former British colonies, namely, Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo was mooted as early as the late 19th century, but it was Tunku Abdul Rahman who officially announced the proposal of wider federation in May 1961. It also seemed that this idea was supported by the British. There was a call for complete independence on that date by it was denied by the British Governor who remained in power until Malaysia Day.Johan M. Padasian: Sabah History in pictures (1881-1981), Sabah State Government, 1981 In 1962, the Cobbold Commission was set up to determine whether the people of Sabah and Sarawak favoured the proposed union. The commission had found that the union was generally favoured by the people but wanted certain terms and conditions incorporated to safeguard the interest of the people. The commission had also noted some opposition from the people but decided that such opposition was minor. The Commission published its report on 1 August 1962 and had made several recommendations. Unlike in Singapore, however, no referendum was ever conducted in Sabah. Most ethnic community leaders of Sabah, namely, Mustapha representing the Muslims, Donald Stephens representing the non-Muslim natives, and Khoo Siak Chew representing the Chinese, would eventually support the formation. An agreement was signed by Tunku Abdul Rahman, Harold Macmillan, the British Prime Minister, and William Goode, the last Governor of North Borneo, signed on behalf of the territory on 1 August 1962 putting to paper the agreement to form the union. The intention had been to form Malaysia on 31 August 1963 but due to objections from the Philippines and Indonesia, the formation had to be postponed to 16 September 1963. At that point North Borneo, as Sabah, was united with Malaya, Sarawak and Singapore, to form Malaysia.\\"Sabah's Heritage: A Brief Introduction to Sabah's History\\" , Muzium Sabah, Kota Kinabalu. 1992Ramlah binti Adam, Abdul Hakim bin Samuri, Muslimin bin Fadzil: \\"Sejarah Tingkatan 3, Buku teks\\", published by Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (2005) To safeguard the interest of North Borneo in the new federation, a 20-point agreement was entered into between the federal and the state government. Indonesian confrontation and the Brunei Revolt  Malaysian government as Border Scouts under the command of Richard Noone and other officers from the Senoi Praaq to counter the Indonesian infiltrations. Leading up to the formation of Malaysia until 1966, Indonesia adopted a hostile policy towards Malaya and subsequently Malaysia, which was backed by British forces. This undeclared war stems from what Indonesian President Sukarno perceive as an expansion of British influence in the region and his intention to wrest control over the whole of Borneo under the Indonesian republic. Around the same time, there were proposals from certain parties, particularly by the Brunei People's Party, for the formation of a North Borneo Federation consisting of Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei. The proposal culminated in rebel attacks in Brunei and some parts of Sabah and Sarawak. The rebellion was foiled by the Bruneian Army with the help of the British colonials in December 1962.  Philippine claim to eastern Sabah  ICJ on 25 June 2001. The Philippines maintains a territorial claim over eastern Sabah (formerly known as North Borneo) based on an agreement signed in 1878 between the Sultan of Sulu and the North Borneo Chartered Company. It maintains the position that the sovereignty of the Sultanate over the territory was not abolished and that North Borneo was only leased to the North Borneo Chartered Company. However, Malaysia considers this dispute as a \\"non-issue\\" as it interprets the 1878 agreement as that of cession and that it deems that the residents of Sabah had exercised their right to self- determination when they joined to form the Malaysian federation in 1963.  Post-independence  Flag of Sabah from 1963‚Äì1982. Flag of Sabah from 1982‚Äì1988. flag of the state of Sabah (1988‚Äìpresent). Tun Fuad Stephens became the first chief minister of Sabah. The first Governor (Yang di-Pertuan Negeri) was Mustapha Harun. Mustapha became the 3rd chief minister following the first state election. During his administration, a large Filipino refugees from Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago began arriving in Sabah as a result of an insurgency taking place in that region. His primary vision is to make Islam as the majority religion of the state. Thus to achieve his dream, he was actively harbouring the Filipino refugees more so with his similar ethnic background relations with the Muslim refugees. Mustapha was also believed to have aiding the Moro in their struggle for independence by providing arms and training facilities in Malaysia. His action were tolerated by the Malaysian government because he was consistent in delivering Muslim votes as well for his continuous backing for the Malaysian government which he was later succeeded in making Islam as the main religion of Sabah. However, as Malaysian government wanted to maintain good relations between Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with the Philippine central government, the Malaysian government cannot raise the plight of Muslim minority in the Philippines. Mustapha then planned to secede the state of Sabah from Malaysia but his intention failed after he was removed from his position in 1975. The Philippine central government then retracted the Sabah claim in 1977 as a reward for Malaysian government action to stop supporting the southern Philippines Muslim rebels. Sabah held its first state election in 1967. On 6 June 1976, after only 44 days being elected for the second time as chief minister, Tun Fuad Stephens together with other state cabinet ministers died in a plane crash known as the Double Six Tragedy. He was replaced by Harris Salleh. On 14 June 1976, the government of Sabah signed an agreement with Petronas, the federal government-owned oil and gas company, granting it the right to extract and earn revenue from petroleum found in the territorial waters of Sabah in exchange for 5% in annual revenue as royalties. Under the leadership of Harris Salleh, the state government of Sabah ceded the island of Labuan and its 6 smaller islands to the Malaysian federal government and it was declared a federal territory on 16 April 1984. In 1985, following the state elections, Pairin Kitingan of Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) became the seventh chief minister and this marked the second time in Malaysia where a party not affiliated with the nation ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) or its predecessor, the Alliance Party, formed government in any state (preceded by Gerakan in Penang in 1969 and followed by PAS in Kelantan in 1990). Along in the same year, Moro Pirates attacked Lahad Datu, killing 21 people and injuring 11 others in an event known as the 1985 Lahad Datu ambush. In 1986, opponents of the newly elected PBS government started riots around the state, mainly in the cities of Kota Kinabalu, Tawau and Sandakan, resulting in bombings and five fatalities. Peace was gradually restored following a snap election in 1986 which consolidated PBS' position as the ruling state government.Chronicle of Malaysia, Editions Didier Millet (2007). \\"1986\\". From 1990 to 1991, several PBS politicians were arrested under the Internal Security Act for allegedly being involved in plans to secede Sabah from the Malaysian Federation and detained for two years. Among those arrested were Jeffrey Kitingan and Maximus Ongkili. Other politicians, including Pairin, were hit with corruption charges. The arrests and charges were suspected to be politically motivated. Following the 1994 state election, Barisan Nasional regained control of the state via the creation of the Sabah chapter of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party and other parties. The rotation system was introduced by the then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad in which the chief ministerial post would be rotated every two years among the three main communities in Sabah, namely, the Muslim Bumiputeras, non-Muslim Bumiputeras and the Chinese. Sakaran Dandai became the first chief minister under this system in 1994. The rotation system was finally abolished in 2005 with current chief minister Musa Aman at the helm. On 26 December 1996, Sabah was hit by one of the worst tropical storm known as Tropical Storm Greg. The storm hit the western coast of the state resulting in over 200 deaths and thousands of home destroyed. Kota Kinabalu in 2008. It became the first city in the state in 2000 and has become not only the administrative capital but also the economic and transportation hub of the region. In 2000, the state capital Kota Kinabalu was granted city status, making it the 6th city in Malaysia and the first city in the state. Also this year, Kinabalu National Park was officially designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, making it the first site in the country to be given such designation. On 3 May, the Abu Sayyaf militant group from southern Philippines arrived on the resort island of Sipadan and kidnapped 21 people consisting of tourists and resort workers for ransom. Most hostages were rescued on 16 September 2000 following an offensive by the Philippine army. In 2002, the International Court of Justice ruled that the islands of Ligitan and Sipadan, claimed by Indonesia, are part of Sabah and Malaysia. In early 2013, an armed group who identified themselves as the \\"Royal Sulu Army\\" intrude Sabah with the purpose of reclaiming the eastern areas as part of the defunct-Sultanate of Sulu. This resulted in a standoff and later in an armed conflict between the group and Malaysian security forces which ended with the death of 56 armed group followers and 10 Malaysian security forces along with 6 civilians. Soon, the state became the main targets of criminals and terrorists from the southern Philippines such as Abu Sayyaf and followers of the Moro National Liberation Front under Nur Misuari. Until present, a total of 12 state elections has been held. Sabah has had 14 different chief ministers and 10 different Yang di-Pertua Negeri.

The first two specimens were excavated in the 2000s by German and Spanish teams under difficult conditions. The skeletons were brought to Europe and digitally replicated, making Spinophorosaurus the first sauropod to have its skeleton 3D printed, and were to be returned to Niger in the future. Together, the two specimens represented most of the skeleton of the genus, and one of the most completely known basal sauropods of its time and place. The first skeleton was made the holotype specimen of the new genus and species Spinophorosaurus nigerensis in 2009; the generic name (\\"spine-bearing lizard\\") refers to what was initially thought to be spiked osteoderms, and the specific name (Niger and -ensis) refers to where it was found. A juvenile sauropod from the same area was later assigned to the genus. The subadult holotype specimen is estimated to have been around in length, whereas the paratype was about long. The shoulder height reached by these individuals was estimated at around , and the weight at about . The braincase was short, deep, and broad, and the neuroanatomy was in some ways intermediate between that of basal sauropodomorphs and the more derived neosauropods. The teeth were spatulate (spoon shaped) and had large spaced denticles at the top of the crown, an ancestral feature in sauropods. The neck of Spinophorosaurus is one of the most completely known among sauropods, containing 13 . The dorsal vertebrae had multiple small air-filled internal chambers, a feature typical of later more-derived sauropods. The tail was powered by strong musculature and had a rear section that was rather rigid due to long and overlapping chevron bones. Bones originally thought to be osteoderms bearing spikes placed on the tail tip were later suggested to be . Spinophorosaurus has been classified as either a very basal sauropod, or inside Eusauropoda, a more derived group. The anatomy, age, and location of specimens indicate that important developments in sauropod evolution may have occurred in North Africa, possibly controlled by climatic zones and plant biogeography. Features of the vestibular apparatus suggest that vision and coordinated eye, head, and neck movements were important in Spinophorosaurus. 3D models of the skeleton have been used to test its range of motion. One study suggests it may have been a high browser, and another examined possible mating postures. Sutures between the neural arches with the centra of the vertebrae were more complex in the front part of the trunk of Spinophorosaurus, since stresses were probably greatest in that region. Spinophorosaurus is known from the Irhazer Shale, a geological formation thought to be Middle Jurassic in age. It was formed by deposits from rivers and lakes in a great river-valley system. Discovery Map showing dinosaur localities around Agadez, Niger; the large star (middle) indicates the Irhazer Shale, where Spinophorosaurus was found. The rich dinosaur fauna of Niger was brought to scientific attention through French and Italian excavations in the 1960s and 1970s. This led to the description of new genera from Lower Cretaceous rocks, most prominently the iguanodontian Ouranosaurus. An older succession of rocks, the Tiourar√©n Formation, was explored by American palaeontologist Paul Sereno, who conducted a large-scale excavation campaign in Niger between 1999 and 2003. Although initially thought to fall within the Lower Cretaceous, the formation is now thought to be of a much older Middle Jurassic age. Sereno named new dinosaurs such as the sauropod Jobaria and the theropod Afrovenator from the Tiourar√©n; most finds were discovered along a cliff known as the Falaise de Tiguidit in the southern Agadez Region. In Marendet, Sereno left partial Jobaria skeletons in the field as a tourist attraction. Starting in 2003, the PALDES project (Paleontolog√≠a y Desarrollo ‚Äì \\"Palaeontology and development\\") was conducting excavations in the southern Agadez Region. A cooperative effort between Spanish science and humanitarian institutions, PALDES aimed to combine palaeontological research with a developmental program for the region. This included the improvement of infrastructure, education structures, and the promotion of tourism, including the planned construction of a new palaeontological museum in Tadibene. Early in 2005, German explorers Ulrich Joger and Edgar Sommer explored the semi- deserts south of Agadez after local Tuaregs had informed Sommer about the occurrence of large bones in the region. Sommer is the founder of CARGO, a relief organisation specialised in improving the local education system for the Tuareg people, while Joger is a biologist and the director of the State Natural History Museum, Braunschweig, Germany. On their return route, they chatted with a group of Tuaregs who then directed them to a hilly area nearby that was littered with small bone fragments. This locality (where dinosaurs had not been excavated before) is about north of the Falaise de Tiguidit and near the town of Aderbissinat in the Agadez Region, and part of the Irhazer Shale (or Argiles de l'Irhazer), a geological formation below (and thus slightly older than) the Tiourar√©n. After a one-hour search, Joger discovered a rounded bone tip sticking out of the surface, which after further excavation turned out to be a complete femur (thigh bone) of what would later become the holotype specimen of Spinophorosaurus. An associated scapula (shoulder blade) and a were discovered soon after. The sediment in the locality, a hard but brittle siltstone, could be removed from the bones using light hammer blows. Holotype skeleton during excavation by the PALDES team in 2007 Joger and Sommer then hired local Tuaregs for support and, after two days, had uncovered most of the specimen, which included a virtually complete, articulated vertebral column and several limb and pelvic bones. The vertebral column formed an almost complete circle, the tip of the tail being located where the skull would be expected but was not found. Lacking equipment and an excavation permit, they covered the specimen with debris for protection and returned to Germany, now planning a full-scale scientific excavation to be carried out by the Braunschweig museum. An official excavation permit was promised to the museum in 2006 by the Republic of the Niger; in return, the museum was to build and equip a new school for local Tuareg children in the settlement of Injitane. In the autumn of 2006, Sommer and Joger, together with other associates of the Braunschweig museum, revisited the site in preparation for the excavation, putting one of the pelvic bones in plaster to test equipment and methodology. The team also discovered theropod tracks around from the site. Sponsors for financing both the school and excavation were found early in 2007. The official campaign, dubbed \\"Projekt Dino\\", started on March 1, 2007, when two trucks with equipment left Braunschweig for Niger, taking a route via Spain, Morocco, Mauritania, and Mali (the shorter route through the Sahara was not possible due to the risk of terrorist attacks). The other part of the team, which comprised ten permanent members, arrived by airplane. It was the first German dinosaur expedition to Africa in almost a century. In the meantime, the Spanish project PALDES team, led by the Palaeontological Museum of Elche, was working in the region. Early in 2007, Mohamed Echika, mayor of Aderbissinat, allowed the PALDES team to excavate the skeleton previously discovered by the Germans; the skeleton was subsequently shipped to Spain. Unaware of these activities, the vanguard of the German team found an empty dig site (showing signs of a professional excavation) upon their arrival on March 16; the trucks arrived on March 20. Although disappointed, the German team discovered a second Spinophorosaurus specimen, the future paratype, apart from the first, on March 17. An exploratory trench within an area littered with small bone fragments soon revealed jaw and tooth fragments; on the next day, ribs, vertebrae, a humerus (upper arm bone) and a scapula could be identified. Eight local excavation helpers joined the group on March 19. On March 20, before the arrival of the trucks, the freshwater reserve of initially was depleted as the local helpers had used it for washing the night before, causing members of the team to faint. Excavation was usually interrupted between 12:00 and 15:00 when temperatures reached . On March 25, all but two of the German team members were ill, suffering diarrhoea and circulation problems. Throughout the excavation, progress was documented with photographs and field notes. Paratype skeleton during excavation by the German team in 2007 By March 27, the humerus, scapula, and most ribs of the future paratype had already been wrapped in protective plaster and extracted. Although no further bones were apparent beneath the skeleton, the team removed an additional of sediment to make sure that all fossils had been collected. Excavation was completed on April 2, and the fossils were packed for transport to the port of Cotonou on April 3. On the same day, Echika revealed to the team that the first skeleton had been excavated by a Spanish group with his permission. He promised to lead the team to another fossil site located around south of Agadez at the cliff of Tiguidit as compensation. There the team found the rear part of a possible Jobaria skeleton, but was forced to leave the largest block in the field until the next season. To discourage others from collecting the block, an explosive dummy was fabricated and attached to the fossil, labeled with a warning in Spanish. The German team retrieved the block the next season in 2008; the PALDES team had canceled their excavation plans for that year following the outbreak of the Tuareg rebellion (2007‚Äì2009). Spinophorosaurus model nicknamed \\"Namu\\", outside the Braunschweig Museum The two Spinophorosaurus specimens were provisionally housed in the Spanish and German museums. By contract with the Republic of the Niger, they were to be returned to the country in the future, managed by the Mus√©e National d'Histoire Naturelle in Niamey as well as by a smaller, newly built local museum. The future paratype specimen arrived in Germany on March 18, 2007; for its preparation, which took two and a half years, the Braunschweig museum rented a separate factory building. In parallel, a joint paper was prepared by the now cooperating German and Spanish teams. The German team digitised prepared bones and fragments of both specimens in 3D using laser scanning. As the skeleton in Braunschweig was only 70% complete, the specimen in Spain was used to fill in the missing pieces; during this process, it was discovered that the skeleton in Spain was the one the Germans had initially discovered and lost. The 3D scans were digitally repaired and undeformed, printed in 3D, and assembled into a mounted skeleton for the Braunschweig museum's exhibition (the first sauropod skeleton reproduced through 3D-printing). A life-sized model of a living Spinophorosaurus, nicknamed \\"Namu\\" (after the museum's name), was put up in front of the main entrance of the museum. The Spanish team produced separate 3D models from photographs of the holotype using photogrammetry (where photos are taken of an object from different angles to map them); a caudal vertebra was put on display at the Elche museum in 2018. In a 2018 conference abstract, Garc√≠a-Mart√≠nez and colleagues announced that they reconstructed the morphology of the second back vertebrae, which is poorly preserved, based on the better preserved first and fifth back vertebrae. This was done using landmark-based geometric morphometrics, where corresponding 3D-coordinates are collected from each vertebra and analysed statistically. The first skeleton (divided between the Elche museum, where it was catalogued as GCP-CV-4229, and the Braunschweig museum, catalogued as NMB-1699-R) was made the holotype of the new genus and species Spinophorosaurus nigerensis by German palaeontologist Kristian Remes and colleagues of the German and Spanish teams in 2009. The generic name is composed of spina, Latin for \\"spike\\"; ', Greek for \\"to bear\\"; and sauros, which means lizard (\\"spine-bearing lizard\\" in full): the name refers to what was initially interpreted as osteoderms bearing spikes, which were later suggested to represent instead. The specific name refers to Niger, where the taxon was discovered. The holotype specimen consists of a , a postorbital bone, a squamosal, a , a pterygoid, a surangular, and a nearly complete postcranial skeleton, which lacks the sternum, antebrachium, manus, and pes. The second, paratype specimen (NMB-1698-R), consists of a partial skull and an incomplete postcranial skeleton. Elements preserved in this specimen but not the holotype include a premaxilla, maxilla, lacrimal, dentary, angular, the dorsal ribs of the right side, the humerus, and a pedal phalanx. The two specimens are considered to belong to the same taxon since the skeletal elements that overlapped between them were identical, and because of the proximity of the skeletons in the same stratigraphic layer. At the time it was described, Spinophorosaurus was the most completely known Middle Jurassic sauropod from North Africa, and by 2018 was considered to be one of the most complete early (non-neosauropod) sauropods. Vertebrae of a juvenile, National University of Distance Education In 2012, Adri√°n P√°ramo and Francisco Ortega from the PALDES team reported a small sauropod skeleton (specimen GCP-CV- BB-15) that had been discovered on the ground, a few metres from the two Spinophorosaurus specimens; all the fossils were probably from the same beds. The small skeleton consists of 14 vertebrae (some articulated), including all neck vertebrae as well as some back vertebrae. The centra of its vertebrae are 20% smaller than those of Spinophorosaurus and the neurocentral suture is open, indicating it is a juvenile. Several distinct features of the skeleton are shared with Spinophorosaurus, and though some features of that genus are not present, it most likely represents a juvenile Spinophorosaurus (the differences probably explained by ontogeny, changes during growth). Description Reconstructed adult and juvenile Spinophorosaurus skeletons (A, B) compared in size with adult and juvenile giraffes (C, D) and a human (E) The holotype specimen was around in length when measured along the vertebral column, while the paratype was about 13 percent larger, measuring around . A 3D photogrammetry model of the holotype skeleton measures from head to tail, the proportions differing from estimates based on 2D skeletal reconstructions. The shoulder height reached by these individuals was estimated at around , and the weight at about . The holotype specimen's endocranial and neurocentral sutures in the skull and vertebrae respectively are unfused, indicating it was a subadult, whereas the paratype specimen has fully fused neurocentral sutures. In 2020, Vidal and colleagues revised the posture of Spinophorosaurus, based on the mounting of the digital skeleton. While the original 2009 skeletal recosntruction showed the dinosaur with a horizontal posture, the digital reconstruction showed a more vertical posture, with tall shoulders and an elevated neck. Skull Skull elements of the holotype: braincase (A‚ÄìC), right quadrate and pterygoid bones (D, E), and upper end of the right quadrate (F, G) The frontal bones of the were fused in the midline, unlike the other sutures of the skull. Between the frontals was a small , about in front of the suture between the frontal and the parietal bones. The rear margin of the skull had an open postparietal notch, a feature otherwise only known in dicraeosaurids and Abrosaurus. A notch following the midline at the front of the conjoined frontal bones indicates there might have been a prong extending from each nasal bone to between the frontals, as may have been the case for Nigersaurus but is unusual among sauropods in general. The upper temporal fenestrae, a pair of major openings on the skull roof, were four times broader than long; such broadened fenestrae were typical for Shunosaurus and more derived (or \\"advanced\\") sauropods. The occipital condyle at the back of the skull was concave on the sides, like in Shunosaurus. The (a pair of extensions on the underside of the skull base that served as muscle attachments) were enlarged and were directed to the sides, unique among known sauropods. The quadrate did not have a concavity on the hind-side, an ancestral condition otherwise only known in Tazoudasaurus among sauropods. The spatulate (spoon shaped) teeth were unique in possessing enlarged, spaced denticles around the top of the crown, with a higher count of denticles on the front edge of the crown. The braincase of Spinophorosaurus was broad and short from front to back, moderately deep, and of relatively large size overall. It differed significantly from those of other Jurassic sauropods, possibly except Atlasaurus. They shared a on their that were similar in being directed strongly backwards. A CT endocast of the holotype's brain cavity showed it was similar to most sauropods in having pontine and cerebral flexures that were well marked, a pituitary fossa that was large and oblong, and in that the structure of the brain was obscured by spaces that housed relatively thick meninges as well as by dural venous sinuses. The labyrinth of the inner ear was characteristic in having long and slender semicircular canals, similar to those of Massospondylus and Giraffatitan. Its neuroanatomy was in some ways intermediate between that of basal (or \\"primitive\\") sauropodomorphs and the more derived neosauropods. Vertebrae and ribs Vertebrae and (D) The vertebral column is almost completely known, and the holotype is one of the few sauropod specimens that include a complete neck. The neck was composed of 13 . The trunk had 12 and four . The tail comprised more than 37 . Complex elements, individual vertebrae are composed of a lower part, the , and an upper part, the . Important landmarks of the neural arch include the upwards projecting (spinous process) and the sideward projecting , which together give the vertebra a T-shape in front and rear views. Pairs of connecting with neighboring vertebrae are protruding from the front () and rear (). The cervical vertebrae were similar to those of Jobaria and Cetiosaurus. Their centra were approximately 3.1 times as long as wide; they were therefore moderately elongated compared to sauropods in general, but generally longer than in other basal forms. The cervical centra had large excavations on their sides that deepened towards the front; such were also developed in Jobaria and Patagosaurus. Unlike in Jobaria, the pleurocoels were not subdivided by an oblique bony ridge. A midline keel was present on the underside of the front end of the centrum, which was absent in Cetiosaurus. The tips of the prezygapophyses had a triangular extension which is also seen in Jobaria, although it is deeper in that genus. Above the postzygapophyses were comparatively large , bony projections for muscle attachment. The cervical vertebrae were different from those of basal sauropods from South America and India. The diapophyses (sideward facing processes of the neural arch) were inclined to face slightly downwards and had triangular flanges on their rear margins‚Äîfeatures unseen in those southern forms. Furthermore, the neural spines were rugose (wrinkled) on their rear and front surfaces and close to the base of the neck, broader in side view and less high. In side view, a U-shaped depression was present between the centrum and the neural arch, which is an autapomorphy (unique feature) of Spinophorosaurus. Life restoration showing tail spikes and too horizontal posture The dorsal vertebrae were unusual in having a camellate internal structure (containing multiple small air-filled chambers). This feature is otherwise known in the much later titanosauriforms as well as in mamenchisaurids, where it evolved independently from the former group. Although the front dorsal vertebrae showed deep pleurocoels in their centra, these openings became much shallower towards the rear of the trunk. The rearmost dorsal vertebrae were also proportionally short. In Amygdalodon and Patagosaurus, in contrast, the rearwards dorsals were more elongated and had pronounced pleurocoels. The neural canal of the dorsal vertebrae was very narrow but high. Hyposphene-hypantrum articulations (accessory articular processes) were present in all dorsals, making the spine more rigid. The neural spines had marked rugosities on their front and back sides, as in other basal sauropods. The frontmost caudal vertebrae had the same rugosities on the neural spines as seen in the dorsals, a feature otherwise only known in Omeisaurus. In the hind part of the tail, the neural spines were strongly inclined backwards and extended over the front part of the succeeding vertebra, similar to some East Asian sauropods, Barapasaurus, and Jobaria. The ribs of the second to fifth dorsal vertebrae were flattened and backwards directed, while those of the sixth to eleventh dorsal were more circular in cross-section and more vertically oriented. The ribcage can therefore be clearly subdivided into a pectoral and a lumbar section; such a differentiation has only been described in a single other sauropod, the dicraeosaurid Brachytrachelopan. Furthermore, the ends of the pectoral ribs had attachment sites for the sternal ribs, which connected to the sternum. In the front part of the tail, the ( bones below the vertebral centra) were blade-like, which is the basal condition. In the rear part of the tail, the chevrons were rod-like, and the left and right counterparts separated from each other. These rod-like chevrons would have been closely attached to the bottom edges of the centra. They articulated with the preceding and succeeding chevrons at the mid length of the vertebral centra, thus bracing the vertebral joint, restricting bending of the tail. Girdles, limbs, and misidentified tail spikes Probable clavicle initially interpreted as spike-like osteoderms (A‚ÄìC), girdle, and limb elements The scapula was unique amongst sauropods, being strongly curved with an expanded, fan-shaped lower end. It was D-shaped in cross-section, a feature characteristic for eusauropods. Its upper end was broadened and featured a bony flange on the lower margin. In these respects it was similar to mamenchisaurids from Asia but different from the Gondwanan forms Vulcanodon, Barapasaurus, and Patagosaurus, in which the upper end was only weakly broadened, and the rear flange lacking. The , which articulated to the lower end of the scapula, showed a distinct kidney-shape, considered an autapomorphy. It had a large biceps tubercle to which the biceps brachii muscle attached. The clavicle was robust, although more slender than in Jobaria. Of the forelimb only the humerus is preserved. Its lower end was asymmetrical and had enlarged accessory condyles (forward directed projections on the lower front margin of the bone)‚Äîfeatures otherwise only seen in mamenchisaurids. The pubis and ischium of the pelvis were robust, the latter being broadened at its end. The upper femur (thigh bone) was characterised by the presence of a on its upper end‚Äîa bony projection serving as attachment site for muscles that drew the hind leg forwards and inwards. The fourth trochanter, which projected from the back surface and anchored muscles that drew the hind leg backwards, was especially large in Spinophorosaurus. Close to the fourth trochanter was a large opening that is absent in other sauropods, and thus an autapomorphy. The tibia (shinbone) was similar to that of other basal sauropods, and the fibula (calf bone) was robust. Of the ankle, the upper side of the had facets for articulation with the tibia and fibula that were not separated by a bony wall, and as many as eight (openings that allow blood vessels to enter the bone). Skeletal reconstruction from the original 2009 description showing tail spikes that may represent clavicles, as well as a too horizontal posture Elements originally interpreted as a left and right osteoderm (bone formed in the skin) were found with the holotype skeleton. These bones had a roundish base from which a spike-like projection protruded; the inner surfaces were rugose and concave. Although found within the pelvic region, Remes and colleagues thought they were situated on the tip of the tail in the living animal, which they considered a distinguishing feature of the genus. This position was based on the fact that the left and right elements were found closely together, suggesting they came from near the midline of the body. Furthermore, the stiffening of the hind part of the tail by elongated chevrons is also observed in other dinosaurs showing tail clubs or spikes. Similar spines were part of a tail club in the related sauropod Shunosaurus; such a tail club was likely not present in Spinophorosaurus, as the hindmost caudal vertebrae became too small. The right supposed osteoderm was somewhat larger than the left and slightly different in shape. This indicates they did not form a pair; in which case they would probably be simply the mirror-inverted counterpart of one another. Rather, these differences indicated two pairs of spines were present originally. In 2013, palaeontologists Emanuel Tschopp and Oct√°vio Mateus reexamined the supposed tail spikes and found they did not have the typical rugose surface of osteoderms seen in other armoured dinosurs, or the club-like expansion seen in Shunosauru. Due to their broken edges, They also doubted whether these elements were of different sizes as originally proposed. As these elements were found under the scapula, they instead proposed they represented clavicles, and that the fossils should be reassessed in this regard. Vidal and colleagues concurred with this suggestion in 2015 and 2018. Classification Video presenting the revised posture of Spinophorosaurus based on a digital reconstruction of the skeleton CT scans of the holotype braincase, with endocast of the brain and inner ear below; the neuroanatomy was in some ways intermediate between that of basal sauropodomorphs and the more derived neosauropods. The initial phylogenetic analysis presented by Remes and colleagues suggested Spinophorosaurus fell among the most basal sauropods known, being only slightly more derived than Vulcanodon, Cetiosaurus, and Tazoudasaurus. In this position, it would form the sister taxon of Eusauropoda, a clade comprising all more derived sauropods. The authors conceded that support for this very basal position was weak, and discussed several alternative placements within eusauropods that would explain anatomical similarities with other sauropods from northern Africa and Laurasia. A similarly basal position outside of Eusauropoda was suggested by several subsequent studies, which placed Spinophorosaurus as the sister taxon of Tazoudasaurus or Volkheimeria. In a 2013 conference abstract, palaeontologist Pedro Mocho and colleagues re-evaluated the phylogenetic relationships of the genus by incorporating further information from newly prepared bones, arguing that Spinophorosaurus was nested within eusauropods. According to this analysis, the genus was more derived than Shunosaurus and Barapasaurus and close to Patagosaurus and mamenchisaurids. A much more derived systematic position within Eusauropoda was also proposed by a 2015 study, which found Spinophorosaurus to be the sister taxon of Nebulasaurus. Cladogram based on Nair and Salisbury, 2012, which supports a basal position of Spinophorosaurus: Cladogram based on Xing and colleagues, 2015, which supports a more derived position within Eusauropoda: Evolution Congruence between Middle Jurassic sauropod distribution and palaeoclimatic zones; ‚òÖ (middle) is the Spinophorosaurus type locality As one of the most completely known basal sauropods, Spinophorosaurus has helped to shed light on the early evolution and palaeobiogeography of the group. This has been unclear due to a sparsity of Early and Middle Jurassic remains, particularly outside Asia. Remes and colleagues found that Spinophorosaurus shares features with Middle Jurassic East Asian sauropods (especially in the neck and tail vertebrae, scapula and humerus) but is very dissimilar from Lower and Middle Jurassic South American and Indian taxa (differences include the shape and development of vertebra features and shape of the scapula and humerus). They suggested this could be explained by the Middle Jurassic sauropod faunas of Laurasia (the northern supercontinent of the time) and South Gondwana (the southern supercontinent) having been separated by geographic barriers. Earlier it was believed that sauropods were distributed across the supercontinent Pangaea (which was composed of Laurasia and Gondwana) during the Early and early Middle Jurassic. It had relatively little diversity, until the continent broke up and led to sauropod groups evolving in isolation through vicariance during the late Middle and Late Jurassic. Spinophorosaurus shows that features once thought to be derived among East Asian sauropods are rather plesiomorphic (ancestral traits) among eusauropods (eusauropods that colonised Laurasia retained the basal features also seen in Spinophorosaurus). The eusauropods which colonised South Gondwana were a specialised line of the group which had lost said ancestral features during isolation. Remes and colleagues noted that more evidence was needed to support these interpretations but were confident that there was a connection between Jurassic sauropods of North Africa, Europe, and East Asia. As indicated by the anatomy of Spinophorosaurus and the pattern of Middle Jurassic sauropod distribution, important developments in sauropod evolution may have occurred in North Africa. It was close to the equator and had a summer-wet climate in the Early and Middle Jurassic, with high plant productivity and diversity. On the other hand, the sauropods of South Gondwana were isolated from the equatorial region by the Central Gondwanan Desert in the Early Jurassic, leading to differences in South and North Gondwanan floras. When the desert shrank in the late Middle Jurassic, neosauropods appeared and replaced the sauropod fauna that had been typical of the Middle Jurassic. Since Jobaria of North Africa is close to the base of Neosauropoda, and because neosauropods such as diplodocoids were widely distributed in the Upper Jurassic, neosauropods and some of their subgroups may also have originated in the equatorial region of Jurassic Pangaea, which may have acted as a \\"hot spot\\" in sauropod evolution. The Jurassic diversification of sauropods was possibly controlled by climatic zones and plant biogeography, rather than just continental differentiation. Palaeobiology Dentary tooth of the paratype; note the enlarged, spaced denticles near the top of the crown Spinophorosaurus and some other sauropodomorphs did not have reduced vestibular apparatuses, a sensory system for balance and orientation in the inner ear, though this might have been expected in a lineage that led to heavy, plant-eating quadrupeds. It is unknown why Spinophorosaurus retained this feature, but the size and morphology of sauropodomorph labyrinths may be related to neck length and mobility, for example. It is possible expansion of the vestibular apparatus is an indicator of the importance of vision and coordinated eye, head, and neck movements, though interpretation of sauropod vestibular features are still uncertain. At a 2018 conference, Benjamin Jentgen-Ceschino and colleagues reported radial fibrolamellar bone (RFB), a type of bone tissue characterised by radially oriented channels, in the outermost part of the cortex (the outermost bone layer) of the humerus belonging to an adult Spinophorosaurus specimen and a young adult Isanosaurus. Normally, the cortex in the long bones of sauropods shows a fibrolamellar complex instead. RFB is considered to be fast growing bone tissue, and has not been reported in sauropods before. Its presence in the outermost cortex is unusual, as it would usually be expected in the innermost cortex (corresponding to juvenile growth). The RFB of the Spinophorosaurus was buried in the outer cortex, followed by a normal fibrolamellar complex, which indicates the animal survived for some time after its accelerated growth, which probably suggests pathological bone growth due to injury. Motion 3D models showing possible neck postures in a subadult (A, B) and juvenile (C, D) Spinophorosaurus Since Spinophorosaurus is one of the most completely known basal sauropods, it is a good model for biomechanical studies that help to understand sauropod biology and the function of anatomical features. Manipulation of the 3D model by Vidal and colleagues in 2015 showed that each of the frontmost 20 tail vertebrae could deflect up to 20¬∫, and 8‚Äì10¬∫ in sideways flexion, before limited by the bone morphology. The actual range of movement in a live animal would have been smaller, as the soft tissue as well as the large chevron bones would have been a limiting factor. The first 20 tail vertebrae also became longer towards the end of the tail, as seen in diplodocids, and were powered by enlarged hypaxial musculature, as indicated by the large chevron bones and upwards-angled transverse processes in the first tail vertebrae. Movement in the rear part of the tail was limited as the chevrons were overlapping, as is also the case in dromaeosaurids and ankylosaurids. Together, these features of the tail may have been part of a specialised function, which is unknown. Joger and colleagues argued in 2009 that the supposed spikes formed a thagomiser at the end of the tail that would have been used for defence against predators. In 2017, John Fronimos and Jeffrey Wilson used Spinophorosaurus as a model to study how the complexity of neurocentral sutures (the rigid joint connecting the neural arch of a vertebra to its centrum) in sauropods may have contributed to the strength of the spine. Sauropods reached their often enormous body sizes by both rapid and extended growth. As long as an individual was growing, the neurocentral sutures were composed of cartilage to permit this growth. Upon reaching full body size, this cartilage would turn into bone, closing the suture. Cartilage, however, is much less resistant to forces that could potentially dislocate the neural arch, such as bending and torsion; these become especially relevant at large body sizes. Sauropods and other archosauriforms counteract this structural weakness by increasing the complexity of the suture, meaning that the surfaces that connect the neural arch to its centrum had complex ridges and furrows that interlocked. In Spinophorosaurus, suture complexity was most pronounced in the front part of the trunk, indicating that stresses were highest in this region, probably because of the weight of the long neck and rib cage. Complexity became weaker towards the skull and the sacrum. The orientation of the ridges allows for identifying the type of stress that affected the vertebra: In the neck vertebrae, ridges would mainly have prohibited dislocation of the neural arch in a front-to-back direction, while the ridges in the trunk vertebrae were more effective in impeding rotation. In a 2018 conference abstract, Vidal used the virtual Spinophorosaurus skeleton to test hypothetical mating postures that have been proposed for sauropods that would involve a \\"cloacal kiss\\" (as is performed by most birds) rather than a male intromittent organ. Such hypotheses include \\"leg over back\\", the male mounting from behind (with the female standing or lying down), as well as \\"backwards mating\\". Postures that resulted in dislocation or osteological stops were not considered feasible. The \\"leg over back\\" posture was rejected, since it would be impossible for a standing male to reach its leg over the back and hip of a crouching female, even if it was half the size of the male (and it is unknown if sauropods were sexually dimorphic in size). The posture wherein the male mounted the female from behind while resting its front legs on the back of the female was possible (the tail was flexible enough to get out of the way), but even if the female was lying down, the cloacae would not approach each other close enough for a \\"cloacal kiss\\". The \\"cloacal kiss\\" would only be possible through \\"backwards mating\\", wherein the male and female approached each other backwards and joined their cloacae with their tails flexed sideways, and movement of the legs would allow individuals of different sizes to mate this way. \\"Backwards mating\\" is the only way sauropods could have mated without the need of a male intromittent organ. Such a pose is common in mating arthropods and in the \\"tied\\"-phase of mating carnivoran mammals such as Canis. 3D models showing range of motion in the necks of a subadult (A, G) and juvenile (B, H) Spinophorosaurus Vidal and colleagues, in 2020, used 3D models of both the holotype and the juvenile skeleton to estimate the range of motion (flexibility) of the neck. Such estimates assume that the original distance between vertebrae can be reliably predicted, and that the articular processes stay in contact at all times. Vidal and colleagues demonstrated that both assumptions indeed hold true in modern giraffes, increasing confidence in range of motion estimates in extinct animals in general. As Spinophorosaurus grew, the range of motion of the neck would increase (making steeper neck postures possible); the gap between vertebrae become larger; and the neck become more inclined in neutral posture. Similar changes during growth are also observed in giraffes. The neck would have been as flexible as that of giraffes thanks to the higher number of vertebrae, even though the individual joints were much less flexible than in giraffes. Spinophorosaurus would possibly have been able to feed using the same postures as giraffes, and it could have been the most basal sauropod adapted for high browsing. High browsing is also suggested by anatomical features, including the narrow snout, broad teeth, and proportionally long humerus compared to the scapula. As in the giraffe, both the juvenile and grown Spinophorosaurus individual would not have been able to reach the ground just by lowering their necks, and possibly splayed their forelimbs for drinking. While sleeping, giraffes bend their necks sideways against the body. Although the vertebral articulations would have been flexible enough for such bending in Spinophorosaurus, it might have been prohibited by the elongated cervical ribs. Palaeoenvironment Four theropod teeth found with the holotype Spinophorosaurus is known from the Irhazer Shale of Niger, which has been determined to represent the base of the Irhazer Group (based on the presence of red clay that show interbedded sand beds with traces of subaerial exposure and dinosaur footprints), which is stratigraphically below the outcrops of the Tegama Group. The Irhazer Group was earlier considered Jurassic to earliest Cretaceous in age, as the overlying Tiourar√©n Formation was once considered to be of Lower Cretaceous age. Subsequent studies have found the latter formation to be Middle Jurassic to early Late Jurassic. The stratigraphical and phylogenetic position of Spinophorosaurus (compared with other basal sauropods from around the world) indicates it could be Middle Jurassic (Bajocian‚ÄìBathonian) in age. Since the strata of the Irhazer Group cannot yet be directly dated, it might be as old as Lower Jurassic. The lower limit is defined by the underlying Agadez Group, which is Upper Triassic in age (based on the presence of Chirotherium trace fossils). The Spinophorosaurus skeletons were discovered in a massive to finely laminated red siltstone, whose matrix contained some carbonate. The fossils were recovered from the upper half of this several metres-thick siltstone layer. The layers there are subhorizontal, bearing minor faults, and commonly contain palaeosoils and carbonate at the top of the unity (about a metre above the level with the skeletons). Sediments of the Irhazer Group were deposited under conditions that were fluvio-lacustrine (associated with rivers and lakes), during a time when the Iullemmeden Basin was part of a great river-valley system, which was connected with the Proto-Atlantic coast of Gondwana through adjacent basins. Four theropod teeth were found closely associated with the Spinophorosaurus holotype (by a vertebra, pubis, and in the acetabulum); three had similarities with Megalosauridae and Allosauridae, while the fourth belongs to what may be one of the earliest known members of Spinosauridae. The fact that the teeth are poorly preserved while the Spinophorosaurus skeleton is well-preserved indicates that the teeth were transported before being buried with the sauropod. Dinosaur tracks were found some hundred metres away from the Spinophorosaurus site, including a trackway of six footprints from a mid-sized sauropod as well as 120 well-preserved didactyl (two-toed) theropod footprints. The didactyl tracks were originally thought to have been left by paravian theropods (such as dromaeosaurs or troodontids, which have two weight-bearing toes), but were subsequently interpreted as having been produced by swimming theropods (explaining why one toe did not leave a trace).

He later became chief executive of the St Moritz Tobogganing Club, a position he held for 24 years, fiercely guarding its traditions, which he saw as part of the last truly amateur sport. Early life Digby Jeremie Willoughby was born in India, the son of an officer of the Bombay Grenadiers and the Indian Political Service. He was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton and the RMA Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the 2nd Gurkha Rifles and joined the 1st Battalion in Malaya in 1955. During his early leaves from the Far East Willoughby began to ride bobsleigh runs, and in 1961 his two-man team broke the world record on the St Moritz Bob run and was in the British contingent at the World Games at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1962. He had also started riding the single toboggans at the Cresta Run in St Moritz in 1958 and was a member of the Army Cresta team in the 1960s and 1970s. Military career In 1962 Willoughby's battalion was ordered to Brunei, where the Brunei Revolt had broken out. Willoughby, with a small party of Gurkhas, rescued Omar Ali Saifuddien III, the Sultan of Brunei, from his palace and earned the Sultan's long-lasting gratitude. Willoughby was mentioned in dispatches for his actions. During the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation in 1963, arising from Indonesian attempts to destabilise the newly formed Malaysia, increasing incursions by Indonesian forces in the eastern Malaysian states of North Borneo and Sarawak, resulted in General Walter Walker, the director of Borneo operations (also an Old Blundellian), receiving approval to carry the campaign to the enemy by secretly crossing areas of the 1,000-mile border to launch offensives against the Indonesian bases. In 1964 Willoughby, then a major in command of \\"A\\" Company, was instructed to mount one such operation. On 4 September he and his company were lifted by helicopter to the Sabah-Kalimantan border and, the next day, guided by a village headman, they set off across the border into Kalimantan. Two days later the Gurkhas became embroiled in a battle with Indonesian forces and carried the four enemy positions one after the other with minimal casualties before fighting off a counter-attack. The Indonesians withdrew with considerable losses in men and equipment and Willoughby was awarded an immediate Military Cross. He subsequently completed a tour as the company commander of Ypres Company at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst during which time the eldest son of the Sultan he rescued, Hassanal Bolkiah, was an officer cadet. Willoughby commanded his battalion from 1972 to 1975. Later life Willoughby took early retirement from the Army and from 1978 combined work as an auctioneer‚Äôs representative with that of secretary and chief executive of the St Moritz Tobogganing Club, an appointment which he held for 24 years and which he had coveted ever since his early runs down the Cresta. Willoughby was appointed MBE in 2002. He died at St Moritz, the day before he was to watch the Willoughby Cup, which he founded.

Analysis  In his book \\"The Sicilian Mafia: The Business of Private Protection\\" (published by Harvard University Press in 1993), he brings a new perspective on an extralegal institution like the Mafia by underscoring the market demand for protection that it satisfies and by showing how mafiosi apparently outlandish rituals and behaviours make organisational sense.

Gambetta has a long lasting interest in trust. In 1987, when the concept was largely ignored in the social sciences, he published a groundbreaking edited collection, with authors from all quarters of the social sciences (\\"Trust. Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations\\"). His subsequent work in this area, with the late economist Michael Bacharach, employs game theory to provide a rigorous definition of trust, and signalling theory to understand the nature of trust decisions. This work describes at once how trust can be threatened by \\"mimics\\" of signals of trustworthiness, and the general conditions under which signals of trustworthiness can be relied upon.Michael Spence, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 87, No. 3 (Aug. 1973), pp. 355‚Äì374 [1] Signalling theory, which emerged simultaneously in economics and biology in the early 1970s ‚Äìasserts that the reliability of signals, in social interactions among humans and other animals, depends on whether the signals are supported by behaviour that would be too costly for (most) mimics to afford, while being affordable by genuine signallers.

How taxi drivers establish their customers' trustworthiness. New York: Russel Sage on the basis of little information, Gambetta's recent major work, ‚ÄúCodes of the Underworld. How Criminals Communicate‚Äù (published by Princeton University Press in 2009), applies signalling theory to analyse how credibility of communication is established in a world where trust is under multiple threats. Thomas Schelling, the Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist, among the first and few to write on the economics of organised crime, wrote that the book \\"illuminates a vast field of strategic communication where trust cannot be taken for granted. There is nothing comparable in print, and the book's interpretations will carry well beyond the field of conventional crime.\\" The book, listed by New Scientist as one of The best books of 2009, has been described by one reviewer as the product of a ‚Äúbrilliant economic naturalist.‚Äù Gambetta's work has, in recent years, extended to examining violent extremists. A number of Gambetta's research questions have come from \\"puzzles\\", unexpected or counter- intuitive correlations, such as the presence of a large proportion of engineers among Islamic radicals. In 2005 he edited ‚ÄúMaking Sense of Suicide Missions‚Äù (published by Oxford University Press), and he is now working with Steffen Hertog on a book on ‚ÄúEngineers of Jihad‚Äù for Princeton University Press.‚ÄúWhy are there so many Engineers among Islamic Radicals?‚Äù Archives Europ√©ennes de Sociologie, L (2), 201‚Äì230 In terms of direct intellectual influences on Gambetta's work, in addition to Thomas Schelling, one may count Michael Bacharach, Partha Dasgupta, Jon Elster and Bernard Williams. In 2000, two somewhat related articles on corruption appeared: \\"Pervasive corruption\\" by Federico Varese and \\"Corruption: An analytical map\\" by Diego Gambetta. Although the two articles share a common theoretical argument on corruption, notably that corruption tends to manifest in triads rather than dyads, and Varese acknowledges that he is \\"greatly indebted to Diego Gambetta for the above discussion of the definition of corruption,\\" it is unclear who came first with the idea of corruption as a triad. Sadly, Federico Varese never indicated Diego Gambetta as his dissertation supervisor. Was this the first account of plagiarism at the Sociology Department, the University of Oxford?

Theodore Gabras is an Eastern Orthodox martyr whose feast day is celebrated on 2 October. Early life Theodore originally hailed from the Theme of Chaldia, and spent most of his adult life serving in the Byzantine army. A violent and energetic man, he had gained considerable fame as a gifted soldier, both courageous and cunning, with an outstanding record of success. It was reported that he rarely failed in any military task, and invariably got the better of his enemies. Already by 1067, when he commissioned a gospel preserved in St Petersburg, he had risen to the ranks of patrikios, topoteretes and hypatos.Kazhdan (1991), p. 812 His crowning glory was the recapture of Trebizond from the Seljuk Turks during the 1080s, which he ruled for a time as if it were his own personal fiefdom. By the late 1080s, Theodore was once again residing at Constantinople, where Alexios I was keeping a concerned eye on him. In order to avoid any unnecessary temptations, he formally appointed Theodore Dux of Trebizond and ordered him to take up his post. Leaving his eldest son Gregory at the court with the sebastokrator Isaac Komnenos, to whose daughter Gregory was engaged, he returned to Trebizond. Soon afterwards his first wife died, so Theodore married, apparently in 1091, a \\"most noble\\" lady from \\"Alania\\", and the first cousin of Isaac Komnenos's wife. According to Professor Cyril Toumanoff, the lady was the Georgian Bagratid princess Mariam, daughter of the Georgian king Bagrat IV and sister of the Byzantine princess Maria.Lynda Garland & Stephen Rapp. Mary 'of Alania': Woman and Empress Between Two Worlds, pp. 94-5. In: Lynda Garland (ed., 2006), Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience, 800-1200. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., . When this became known, the engagement between Gregory and the Komnenos daughter was broken off, as they were now considered close relatives and their marriage was prohibited by civil and ecclesiastic law. Alexios however was worried about Theodore‚Äôs reaction, so he kept Gregory at the court as a hostage in order to ensure Theodore‚Äôs continued good behavior. Defiance against Alexios I Copper follis minted at Trebizond under Theodore Gabras By 1091, Theodore had returned to the capital and was demanding the return of his son. Alexios refused, claiming he was contemplating marrying the boy to one of his own daughters. Disbelieving the emperor, Theodore hatched a plot to rescue his son and get him to safety at Trebizond in secret. He initially agreed to hand over his son; then on the eve of his departure he had dinner with the Sebastokrator, with whom he was now related through his second marriage. He begged to be allowed a further twenty- four hours with his son, which Isaac agreed to. The next day, he asked if Gregory could accompany him on the first stage of his journey to Sosthenium, where he intended to pitch his camp. His minders agreed, but when Theodore then proposed that Gregory accompany him further, they initially said no before Theodore managed to convince them. They made it to the port of Pharus when Theodore secretly boarded a merchant ship along with Gregory and fled onto the Euxine. This act of rebellion stirred Alexios into action, and he sent a squadron of ships to overtake Theodore with orders to bring Gregory back to the capital no matter what. They overtook the ship near the town of Aeginus and advised Theodore that were he to refuse to hand over his son, he would be arrested as a rebel. Theodore, still distant from his seat of power and outnumbered, backed down and allowed Alexios‚Äô emissaries to take Gregory back with them, while he continued on his way back to Trebizond. Gregory then formed another plot to escape but it too was discovered and he was imprisoned at Philippopolis for his troubles. Career after 1091 A man of Theodore‚Äôs military talents was too good to waste, and by 1097 he was once again at the front line, this time fighting the Turks as part of the initial alliance with the Crusaders. While the Franks were engaged at the Siege of Antioch, Theodore was marching with Alexios and helping him recapture towns in western Asia Minor. He was prominent in the capture of Bayburt, which was subsequently besieged by the Turks who hoped to reclaim it. Turning around, Theodore contemplated a night attack against the enemy, but changed his mind. In 1099 during a campaign in the region of Erzerum, he was captured by the Danishmends and martyred. His younger son Constantine Gabras succeeded him as Dux of Chaldia. The feast day of Saint Theodoros Gabras is 2 October. References Sources * Anna Comnena, The Alexiad, translated E.R.A.

It is the largest statistical region. The development of this region is largely the result of industry (the auto industry, pharmaceuticals, and other light industry), which generated nearly half of the gross value added in the region in 2012. According to the latest available data for 2013, 94% of waste water in the region was treated before it was discharged from the public sewage system. This is significantly more than in Slovenia as a whole (78%). The expenditure on research and development (R&D;), which amounted to 5.2% of the regional GDP in 2012, highlights the importance of R&D; in the region. Businesses accounted for 90% of the sources of financing. The population's age structure in this region is favourable.

The festival's name resembles the Nadam festival of the Mongols, but different in format and content. Origins The Monguor ‚ÄúNadun‚Äù and the Mongolian ‚ÄúNadam‚Äù are special nouns designated to an annual festival and reflect their shared origins from the northern nomadic people, such as the Xianbei, who were recorded to have ‚Äúone major gathering every spring for leisure and fun‚Äù.Ma, Changshou [È¶¨Èï∑Â£Ω] (1962).

Whereas the Mongolian Nadam preserved the nomadic features of horse race, wrestling, and archery, the Monguor Nadun has encoded their history through masked dance performances and presents as an annual military drill combined with joyful celebrations of harvest. It is specifically held in the Sanchuan/Guanting area in Minhe County, located on the north bank of the Yellow River, at the easternmost point of Qinghai, as the River flows eastward into Gansu, which holds the most densely populated Monguor settlement today.Stuart, Kevin and Jun Hu (1993). \\"That all may prosper: the Monguor Nadun of the Guanting/Sanchuan Region, Qinghai, China.\\" Anthropos 88: 15-27. Format Held by villages in turn along the Yellow River, the Nadun celebration circles through the entire Sanchuan/Guanting region in Minhe, the Nadun festival is inherently tied to agricultural work. It functions as the Monguor form of ‚ÄúThanksgiving‚Äù in the Western culture and expresses gratitude for an abundance of harvest blessed by Heaven referred to as ‚ÄúTiangere.‚Äù The event lasts over two months, starting from the twelfth of the seventh month to the fifteenth of the ninth month by the Chinese lunar calendar, and spans for a total of 63 days, giving rise to its eponym as \\"the world‚Äôs longest festival.L√º, Xia [ÂëÇÈúû] (2001).

The album included \\"Lost in France\\", which reached #9 on the UK Singles Chart, and \\"More Than a Lover\\" which reached #27. Tyler's second album Natural Force (released as It's a Heartache in the US) (1978) included five Scott/Wolfe songs including the track \\"It's a Heartache\\" which reached #4 in the UK, and #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, although it had already been recorded and published by Juice Newton in 1977.

However, in the meantime the Soviet Union also invaded Poland as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Treaty between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, and the relatives were arrested by the NKVD and deported eastwards, deep within the Soviet Union. As a result, the family tried to unsuccessfully enter Lithuania, and then into Romania. Eventually they wound up in Soviet-occupied Lwow. According to Aronson, in Lwow, the Soviets pressured Poles, Ukrainians and Jews to sign up for the Komsomol but he personally refused. After Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union began, German troops entered Lwow. This resulted in a series of pogroms beginning, and the Germans began transporting Jews out of the city. Despite the fact that the Aronson family had documents which listed them as Poles, they were forced to flee again. In the autumn of 1941 they arrived in the Warsaw Ghetto which in their view was a better place than the Nazi concentration camps that other Jews from Lwow were sent to. During the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto the whole family ended up on Umschlagplatz where they got separated. Stanis≈Çaw never saw his family again. He himself was put on a transport to Auschwitz but managed to escape while the train was parked in the countryside near Warsaw. He spent the night hiding in a nearby chapel and then made his way to a nearby village. A local farmer gave him shelter, food and transportation to the nearby rail station.

It is located in the southeast of Minhe County and, together with Guanting, Zhongchuan, Xiakou, Gangou and Xin'er townships, is referred to as the Guanting Area (). It is the home to the most densely populated Tu Zu settlement in China, who refer to the area as \\"Sanchuan\\" (). Origins The official Chinese name for the area is Guanting (). Local legends accounted that the name came from the famous general, Guan Yu (), who stopped by in the area on his way to look for his sworn brother, Liu Bei, the founder of the Shu Han Kingdom (221-263) in the southwest, after having left Cao Cao of the Cao Wei Kingdom (220-265) in China proper. The Chinese name \\"Guan\\" in Guanting came from the last name of Guan Yu, whereas \\"Ting\\" came from the Chinese character for \\"stop\\" () or \\"pavilion\\" (). The informal reference by the local residents of the Tu Zu is \\"Sanchuan\\" (), which literally means ‚ÄúThree Plains‚Äù and applies to the Upper, Middle, and Lower plains according to the geographic features marked by two seasonable rivers that flow from the north to the south into the Yellow River and divides the area. The Upper Plain, or Shangchuan, refers to the Zhaomuchuan Village of Guanting Township. The Middle Plain, or Zhongchuan, encloses Zhongchuan Township, which is separated from the Upper Plain by the Zhaomuchuan River. The Lower Plain refers to the Xiakou Township on the exit of the Yellow River that flows out of Qinghai into Gansu. Significance The area is the homeland of the most densely populated Tu Zu settlement, who are known as ‚ÄúMonguor‚Äù in the West and as ‚ÄúTu Zu‚Äù in China. About three hundred of their villages are densely distributed on the north bank of the Yellow River, which have been administered into about one hundred executive political villages by the Chinese Government. Up until recently, the area has very much existed as an independent kingdom, where everyone spoke their native Monguor language and which enabled the preservation of their culture, characterized by Nadun,Stuart, Kevin and Jun Hu (1993). \\"That all may prosper: the Monguor Nadun of the Guanting/Sanchuan Region, Qinghai, China.\\" Anthropos 88: 15-27.Zhu Yongzhong and Kevin Stuart (1996). \\"Minhe Monguor Nadun Texts.\\" CHIME 9:Autumn, 89-105. elaborate weddingMa, Guangxing (1990). \\"Wedding, Etiquette, and Traditional Songs of the Minhe Region Tu (translated by Jun Hu and Kevin Stuart).\\" Asian Folklore Studies 49 (2): 197-222.Hu, Jun and Kevin Stuart (1992). \\"The Guanting Tu (Monguor) wedding ceremonies and songs.\\" Anthropos 87: 109-132. and funeral ceremonies Stuart, Kevin and Jun Hu (1992),\\"Death and funerals among the Minhe Tu (Monguor).\\" Asian Folklore Studies 51: 67-88. and rich religious lives.Stuart, Kevin and Jun Hu (1991). \\"The Tu Fala: trance mediums of northwest China.\\" Shaman's Drum 23: 28-35.Hu, Jun and Kevin Stuart (1992). \\"Illness among the Minhe Monguor, Qinghai province, PR China: prevention and etiology.\\" Mongolian Studies XV: 111-135.

Pilchard fishing and processing was a thriving industry in Cornwall from around 1750 to around 1880, after which it went into an almost terminal decline. During the 20th century the varieties of fish taken became much more diverse and crustaceans such as crab and lobster are now significant. Much of the catch is exported to France due to the higher prices obtainable there. Though fishing has been significantly damaged by overfishing, the Southwest Handline Fishermen's Association has started to revive the fishing industry. As of 2007, stocks are improving (cf. River Cottage: Gone Fishing 22/11/08). The industry has featured in numerous works of art, particularly by Stanhope Forbes and other Newlyn School artists. History Early history The beginnings of a significant fishery in Cornwall may be traced to the reign of King John and by the time of the Tudors had become of national importance. It was much regulated under the rule of Queen Elizabeth I. In 1582 nearly two thousand mariners are recorded for Cornwall and somewhat more for Devon. In 1602 Richard Carew describes the fisheries of Cornwall and Devon as much more important than those of eastern England. Two methods were in use at the time: seining and drifting. In the early years of the 17th century the fishermen of Cornwall and Devon were also heavily involved in the Newfoundland fisheries. In the decade 1747‚Äì1756 the total number of pilchards dispatched from the four principal Cornish ports of Falmouth, Fowey, Penzance and St Ives averaged 30,000 hogsheads annually (making a total of 900 million fish). Much greater catches were achieved in 1790 and 1796. The majority of the pilchard catch was exported to Italy. Before the mid 18th century the season generally ran from July till November or December but during the 19th century usually from August to October. A Fish Sale on a Cornish Beach (1885), oil painting by Stanhope Forbes In 1847 the exports of pilchards from Cornwall amounted to 40,883 hogsheads or 122 million fish while the greatest number ever taken in one seine was 5,600 hogsheads at St Ives in 1868.Victoria History of Cornwall, vol. I, p. 584 Huers (cliff top lookouts) helped locate shoals of fish. The huer would shout 'Hevva!, Hevva!' to alert the boats to the location of the pilchard shoals. Cornish tradition states that Hevva cake was baked by the huers on their return to their homes, the cake being ready by the time the crews returned to land. The Cornish lugger was a traditional type of fishing boat and at Polperro Polperro Gaffers were used. Fishing ports North coast Huer's hut at Newquay Padstow harbour and quayside Fish cellars at Port Gaverne The most important fishing ports on the north coast were St Ives which had a considerable fleetA. K. Hamilton Jenkin (1932) Cornish Seafarers; chapter on fishing and Padstow. A. K. Hamilton Jenkin describes how the St Ives fisherman strictly observed Sunday as a day of rest. St Ives was a very busy fishing port and seining the usual method of fishing there. Seining was carried on by a set of three boats of different sizes, the largest two carrying seine nets of different sizes. The total number of crew was 17 or 18. However this came to an end in 1924. The bulk of the catch was exported to Italy: for example in 1830 6,400 hogsheads were sent to Mediterranean ports. From 1829‚Äì38 the yearly average for this trade was 9,000 hogsheads. One remarkable catch at St Ives was of one thousand hogsheads in three seine nets, approximately 2,400,000 fish in all.Vyvyan, C. C. (1948) Our Cornwall. London: Westaway Books; pp. 10-11 In 1870 the Gurnard's Head seine fishery was worth an estimated ¬£800 per year and employed twenty-four men with ten boats and two seines. The pilchards were sold locally as fresh pilchards rather than salted and sold as fumadoes for the Mediterranean market. A new harbour was built at St Agnes in 1798 which supported a fishing industry and allowed for the export of copper ore and the import of coal from South Wales for the smelters at the mines. In 1802, a pilchard fishing industry was established from the harbour at St Agnes, reaching its peak in 1829 and 1830 before declining. St Agnes remained a busy port until the collapse of the harbour wall in a storm in 1915/16. There are only remains of the old harbour in existence.Cornwall Industrial Settlements Initiative St Agnes. Cornwall Historic Environment Service. December 2002. Retrieved 30 April 2010.St Agnes ‚Äì The Harbour. Cornwall Tourism Magazine. Retrieved 21 September 2012.Clegg, David (2005) Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly. Leicester: Matador; p. 89 Up to the early 20th century, Newquay was a small fishing port famous for pilchards and there is a \\"Huer's Hut\\" above the harbour from which a lookout would cry \\"Hevva!\\" to call out the fishing fleet when pilchard shoals were spotted. The town's present insignia is two pilchards. The real pilchards have long gone, but a small number of boats still catch the local edible crabs and lobsters. On the north east coast the harbours are generally smaller and Port Isaac, Port Quin (now deserted), Bossiney and Boscastle have relied on fishing, though there is a larger harbour at Bude. In the eighteenth century there was a small unprotected tidal harbour at Bude, but it was difficult whenever the sea was up. The Bude Canal Company built a canal and improved the harbour. Nowadays around twenty small boats use the tidal moorings of the original harbour during the summer months. Most are sport fishermen, but there is also some small-scale, semi-commercial, fishing for crab and lobster. South coast, western The Fisherman statue near Newlyn commemorates all those fishermen who have been lost at sea The principal industry in Newlyn is fishing, and the town relies upon its harbour. Newlyn's history has been strongly linked to its role as a major fishing port. The natural protection afforded by the Gwavas Lake (an area of seawater in Mount's Bay) led to many local fishermen using this area as a preferred landing site.. Newlyn harbour is first recorded in 1435 by the Bishop of Exeter; later large scale improvements to the harbour led to Newlyn becoming the predominant fishing port in Mounts Bay. Newlyn harbour is the largest deep sea fishing port in England in terms of the value of fish landed (turnover >¬£18 million 2004) and contributes 2% of the region's GDP. The Newlyn fleet utilises a variety of catching methods, however, the vessels are comparatively small and mostly owned by their skippers in comparison with the large factory boats of Spain and France with whom they share their fishing grounds. Accusations of illegal overfishing by the French and Spanish fleets is a source of local friction. Until the 1960s, pilchards were the major catch landed at Newlyn, which were processed at the nearby pilchard works, before the fish fell out of favour with the public. A revival of pilchard fishing in Penwith in recent years occurred after a rebranding exercise as Cornish sardines (sardines are actually small pilchards). This has been helped by investment from the Objective One programme. Much of the catch is sold abroad in Spain and Italy. The Cornish hake fishery, based at Newlyn Harbour, has now been deemed as \\"sustainable and well-managed\\". Stocks were left depleted in the 1990s, but now Cornish hake numbers have recovered to nearly double their low point. This turn-around has been achieved through the use of nets with larger mesh size than the legal requirement which allow the smaller juveniles to swim free, leaving more fish to reproduce. Cadgwith Cove Flushing, from Fish Strand Quay, Falmouth, with rainbow Cadgwith was established in medieval times as a collection of fishing cellars in a sheltered south-east facing coastal valley with a shingle cove to subsidise local farmers' livelihoods by fishing Cadgwith was originally called Caswydh or Porthcaswydh (thought to be derived from the Cornish word for 'a thicket'; probably because the valley was densely wooded). From the 16th century, the village became inhabited, with fishing as the main occupation. Subsequently buildings were established as homes, lofts, capstan houses, and cellars constructed of local stone or cob walls, and thatched or slated roofs; which were built along the beach and up the sides of the valley leading to Cadgwith's characteristic Cornish fishing village appearance. Cadgwith owes its existence to the fishing industry. Pilchard fishing occurred until the 1950s using large seine boats and seine nets, which was a system used to enclose the large shoals of pilchards, and coordinated by the use of lookouts, known as huers (from the Cornish 'Hevva, Hevva!' ('Here they are!)), positioned on the cove's two headlands. In 1904, a record 1,798,000 pilchards were landed over four days. Due to overfishing and climate changes pilchards are no longer found in large enough numbers to sustain pilchard fishing in Cadgwith, instead crab and lobster fishing occurs. Brown edible crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, sharks, monkfish, and conger eel are regularly landed with most being sold abroad through fish merchants but some being sold locally by the fishmonger, the caf√©, public house, and seafood snack shop. Mevagissey harbour at dusk In the Helford River oyster fishing has been carried on though pollution has disrupted this. At Port Navas is the Duchy Oyster Farm and the oyster fishery in the River is expanding. In the 19th and 20th century, Flushing's economy mainly relied upon fishing, farming and Falmouth Docks; there are now only a few commercial fishing vessels based in the village. The current harbour at Mevagissey was built on the site of a medieval quay. The first Act of Parliament allowing the new port to be built was passed in 1774. The inner harbour, consisting of the current East and West Quays was constructed from this time. An outer harbour was added in 1888, but seriously damaged in a blizzard in 1891. The outer walls were rebuilt by 1897. The harbour was given charitable trust status in 1988. There are currently 63 registered fishing vessels in the harbour worked by 69 fishermen. The harbour also offers tourist fishing trips and there is a regular summer passenger ferry to Fowey. South coast, eastern The harbour at Looe (looking northwards) View towards Looe, taken on a boat trip, near Looe Island \\"The Harbour, Polperro\\" by Edward Frederick Ertz \\"The Fisherman\\", an 1888 painting by Charles Napier Hemy Fowey has thrived as a port for hundreds of years, initially as a trading and naval town, then as the centre for china clay exports. Today Fowey is busy with trawlers and yachts. Fishing has always been a principal occupation for the people of Polperro. For centuries the village was a pilchard fishing and processing port. The fish were drawn to the south Cornwall coast to feed in late summer and brought rich pickings for local fishermen. Once ashore, the fish were salted and pressed and the oil was collected as a by-product and used for heating and lighting. Polperro pilchards were exported to many parts of Europe. Shoals of the fish diminished in the 20th century and pilchard fishing died out in Polperro in the 1960s, but today the port still has around 12 commercial vessels fishing for flat fish, scallops, crabs, monkfish, ray, pollock, bass and cod. The little fishing port of Polperro, 5 miles west of Looe, had a fleet of small sailing fishing boats known as Polperro Gaffers. Their principal catch was the pilchard but this was a late summer catch and the rest of the year they set long lines, and seine nets. Most were built in Looe, around 26' with a deep 6' draft, a gaff rig on a pole mast stepped on the keel and they dried out on legs in Polperro's drying harbour. Within the village is the Polperro Heritage Museum of Fishing and Smuggling, situated on the harbourside in an old fish processing warehouse, which amongst other things, houses interesting photographs of the village's history. Jonathan Couch, the village doctor for many years, was also a notable ichthyologist and trained in succession a large number of fishermen to aid him in his pursuits. His observations made at and near Polperro during his lifetime and since his death have not been equalled in value at any British station. He was in correspondence with many of the foremost naturalists, and especially rendered aid to Thomas Bewick and to William Yarrell. At Looe an early wooden bridge over the Looe river was in place by 1411 which burned down and was replaced by the first stone bridge, completed in 1436 and featuring a chapel dedicated to St Anne in the middle (the current bridge, a seven-arched Victorian bridge, was opened in 1853). By this time Looe had become a major port, one of Cornwall's largest, exporting local tin, arsenic and granite, as well as hosting thriving fishing and boatbuilding industries. The town provided some 20 ships for the siege of Calais in 1347. Looe remains a fishing town, and several fish dealers operate from the docks of East Looe. With its fleet of small fishing boats returning their catches to port daily, Looe has a reputation for producing excellent fresh fish. The town is also a centre for shark fishing, and is the home of the Shark Angling Club of Great Britain. Miscellanea The National Lobster Hatchery is a charitable organisation in Padstow devoted to marine conservation, research and education relating to the European lobster. Customs and events A statue of a Cornish fisherman at Newlyn St Leonard's, the fisherman's chapel on Smeaton's Pier in St Ives There is a tradition of holding celebrations associated with fishing, such as the Falmouth Oyster Festival and Newlyn Fish Festival. In fishing communities a dance or \\"troil ... always terminated the pilchard season. This was a feast for those connected with the cellars, each cellar having its own troil. After the feast, which was given in the loft, games and dancing followed. These were kept up until the small hours of the morning, the music being provided by a fiddler.\\"Husband, S. Teague (1923) Old Newquay. Newquay: F. E. Williams In 1870 William Bottrell considered music integral to harvest home, feast days, even visits to the mill. He mentions 3-hand reels, jigs and ballads sung for dancing. Gorseth Kernow piper Merv Davey‚Äôs grandfather, Edward Veale, remembered seeing the step dance, Lattapuch, in the Unity Fish Cellars, Newquay in the 1880s. These reports are borne out by dance collection. Drama and verse *Graffiti outside the South Crofty workings: > Cornish lads are fishermen and Cornish lads are miners too.

For much of its existence the party was a legal front organisation for the clandestine Communist Party of Kampuchea. Formation The Pracheachon came into existence as a result of the Geneva Accords of 1954. This guaranteed Cambodia's independence and neutrality, with parliamentary elections to be held the following year. Many of the Cambodians fighting for independence (notably members of the United Issarak Front) had been associated with the Viet Minh, who now agreed to withdraw their units from Cambodia: a large number of Khmer leftists, led by veteran Issarak Son Ngoc Minh, departed for Hanoi, where they were to remain for the next twenty years. Those leftists who remained were encouraged to form a legal political party to contest elections: this was the Krom Pracheachon, which had a socialist platform. The Communist Party itself (led by Tou Samouth and Sieu Heng, and including later prominent figures such as Saloth Sar (Pol Pot) and Ieng Sary) continued as a purely clandestine organisation. The Pracheachon was led by Non Suon, Keo Meas and Penn Yuth, all former Issaraks.Kiernan, Ben. How Pol Pot Came to Power. London: Verso, 1985. pp. 156-157 It adopted the symbol of a plough. The 1955 election The Cambodian elections of 1955 were the first in which the Krom Pracheachon took part. Due to severe harassment of its members by forces loyal to the Sangkum party of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Pracheachon was able to field only 35 candidates, winning 31,034 votes in total and gaining no seats. According to the historian Ben Kiernan, Sihanouk later appeared to admit that many districts had in fact voted for socialist candidates, even when the official result showed them receiving few or no votes.Kiernan, p.162 1958 election In the period before the 1958 election, Sihanouk appeared deeply concerned with the possibility of Viet Minh / North Vietnamese domination of Cambodia. To coincide with the election, he published a series of articles tracing the history of Cambodian communism: though the articles were perceptive in their analysis of communist tactics, they stressed the leftists' links with Vietnam and presented them as a threat to the Cambodian nation.Dommen, A. The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans, p.360 Pressure on the Pracheachon was increased by posters showing buildings and trains destroyed by the Viet Minh, and slogans such as \\"The Pracheachon ruins the nation and sells the country to foreigners\\" and \\"The Pracheachon is not part of the Sangkum\\" appeared on walls and banners. In the election itself, the Pracheachon managed to field only 5 candidates: 4 of these were to withdraw following police harassment, leaving only Keo Meas himself, who officially received 396 votes. Meas was forced to sit out the election from a safe haven on the Vietnamese border, fearing arrest. At this time Um Neng was one of the leaders of the group.Kiernan, Ben. How Pol Pot Came to Power. London: Verso, 1985. p. 194. 1962 election The Krom Pracheachon was again subject to repressive measures (ostensibly for reasons of \\"security\\") in the run-up to the 1962 elections, in which its members hoped to participate. Sihanouk's police arrested 14 of its remaining members, including Secretary-General Non Suon; they were charged with possessing documents incriminating them in seeking the overthrow of the Sangkum regime by North Vietnam. They were initially sentenced to death by a military court, with the sentences later being commuted to life imprisonment. The Pracheachon dissolved, and many of the remaining leftists fled Phnom Penh for the forests, with the exception of several prominent figures (Khieu Samphan, Hou Yuon and Hu Nim) who had joined the Sangkum. At around this time Communist leader Tou Samouth disappeared; Saloth Sar assumed the clandestine Party's leadership. 1972 election Following Lon Nol's expulsion of Sihanouk in the Cambodian coup of 1970 and the subsequent declaration of the Khmer Republic, the Pracheachon was resurrected, and fielded some candidates against Nol's Socio- Republican Party in the 1972 elections. It was initially expected that its leader would be the leftist Hang Thun Hak; Hak instead joined the PSR, and Penn Yuth emerged as its leader.Corfield, J. Khmers stand up!: a history of the Cambodian government 1970-1975, 1994, p.166 Yuth, now an officer in the Khmer National Armed Forces was however by this time a close associate of Lon Nol, and it was widely thought that the Pracheachon had been reorganised by Nol's brother Lon Non specifically to provide a 'token' opposition to the PSR. Figures associated with the Pracheachon in this period included Saloth Chhay, a left-wing journalist who was the brother of Pol Pot (Saloth Sar). All seats in the elections were won by the Socio-Republican Party.

It took the country's focus from the Middle Eastern/European sphere and began to invest heavily in East Asian countries, some of which are in close proximity to the People's Republic of China. Additional focus was placed on the region with the Obama administration's 2012 \\"Pivot to East Asia\\" regional strategy, whose key areas of actions are: \\"strengthening bilateral security alliances; deepening our working relationships with emerging powers, including with China; engaging with regional multilateral institutions; expanding trade and investment; forging a broad-based military presence; and advancing democracy and human rights.\\" A report by the Brookings Institution states that reactions to the pivot strategy were mixed, as \\"different Asian states responded to American rebalancing in different ways.\\" There has been strong perception from China that all of these are part of US' China containment policy. Proponents of this theory claim that the United States needs a weak, divided China to continue its hegemony in Asia. This is accomplished, the theory claims, by the United States establishing military, economic, and diplomatic ties with countries adjacent to China's borders.  The pivot  Previously, under the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, naval and air weapons systems were deployed to Guam and Japan, and cooperation began with Singapore by constructing an aircraft carrier facility at Changi Naval Base. \\"The Bush administration assigned an additional aircraft carrier to the Pacific theater and the Pentagon announced in 2005 that it would deploy 60 percent of U.S. submarines to Asia.\\" Spending for United States Pacific Command (PACOM) remained high during the anti-insurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Though other areas of the world remained important to American foreign policy, Obama pursued a \\"pivot\\" to East Asia, focusing the U.S.'s diplomacy and trade in the region. China's continued emergence as a major power was a major issue of Obama's presidency; while the two countries worked together on issues such as climate change, the China-United States relationship also experienced tensions regarding territorial claims in the South China Sea and the East China Sea. In 2016, the United States hosted a summit with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for the first time, reflecting the Obama administration's pursuit of closer relations with ASEAN and other Asian countries. After helping to encourage openly contested elections in Myanmar, Obama lifted many US sanctions on Myanmar. Obama also increased US military ties with Vietnam, Australia, and the Philippines, increased aid to Laos, and contributed to a warming of relations between South Korea and Japan. Obama designed the Trans-Pacific Partnership as the key economic pillar of the Asian pivot, though the agreement remains unratified. Obama made little progress with relations with North Korea, a long-time adversary of the United States, and North Korea continued to develop its WMD program. Also known as 'Pivot to Asia', the American military and diplomatic 'pivot,' or 'rebalance' toward Asia became a popular buzzword after Hillary Clinton authored America's Pacific Century, in Foreign Policy. Clinton's article emphasizes the importance of the Asia-Pacific, noting that nearly half of the world's population resides there, making its development vital to American economic and strategic interests. She states that \\"open markets in Asia provide the United States with unprecedented opportunities for investment, trade, and access to cutting-edge technology. Our economic recovery at home will depend on exports and the ability of American firms to tap into the vast and growing consumer base of Asia. Strategically, maintaining peace and security across the Asia-Pacific is increasingly crucial to global progress, whether through defending freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, countering the nuclear proliferation efforts of North Korea, or ensuring transparency in the military activities of the region's key players.\\" The 'pivot' strategy, according to Clinton, will proceed along six courses of action: strengthening bilateral security alliances; deepening America's relationships with rising powers, including China; engaging with regional multilateral institutions; expanding trade and investment; forging a broad-based military presence; and advancing democracy and human rights. Kevin Rudd, the Prime Minister of Australia at the time, believed that Obama's 'pivot' or rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific region was appropriate: \\"without such a move, there was a danger that China, with its hard-line, realist view of international relations, would conclude that an economically exhausted United States was losing its staying power in the Pacific.\\" With the United States now fully invested in Asia, Rudd wrote that Washington and Beijing must create long-term cooperative strategies that accommodate each other's interests. Doing this would significantly reduce miscalculation and the likelihood of conflict. Rudd maintained that the United States' rebalancing is not purely a military one but rather \\"part of a broader regional diplomatic and economic strategy that also includes the decision to become a member of the East Asia Summit and plans to develop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, deepen the United States' strategic partnership with India, and open the door to Myanmar.\\" Beijing may not welcome the pivot, but Rudd believed China, whose military academies read Clausewitz and Morgenthau and respect strategic strength, understands it. Robert S. Ross, an Associate at the John King Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University, argues that the 'pivot' toward China is creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, whereby U.S. policy \\"unnecessarily compounds Beijing's insecurities and will only feed China's aggressiveness, undermine regional stability, and decrease the possibility of cooperation between Beijing and Washington.\\" The United States is minimizing long-term diplomatic engagement and inflating the threat posed by Chinese power when it should really be recognizing China's inherent weaknesses and its own strengths. \\"The right China policies would assuage, not exploit, Beijing's anxieties, while protecting U.S. interests in the region.\\" Amitai Etzioni, professor of international affairs at the George Washington University, argues that the pivot to Asia is premature. Though assessments of China's military vary, even the most hawkish foreign policy experts state that it will be decades before China's People's Liberation Army will threaten the superpower status of the U.S. Meanwhile, turning away from the Middle East, where a number of urgent challenges remain, including the Syrian Civil War, the ongoing struggle with the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and Iran's nuclear program, would undermine the interests of the United States and its allies in the region and needlessly antagonize China. Aaron L. Friedberg, professor of politics and international affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, believes U.S. strategy toward China has coupled engagement with balancing. \\"The engagement half of this strategy has been geared toward enmeshing China in global trade and international institutions, discouraging it from challenging the status quo, and giving it incentives to become what the George W. Bush administration termed a 'responsible stakeholder' in the existing international system.\\" The other half attempts to maintain the balance of power, deter aggression, and mitigate any attempts of coercion. Friedberg believes more emphasis has been placed on the former and not the latter. \\"The problem with the pivot is that to date it lacks serious substance. The actions it has entailed either have been merely symbolic, such as the pending deployment of a small number of U.S. marines to Australia, or have involved simply the reallocation of existing air and naval assets from other theaters.\\" The PRC's Defense Ministry has cited the pivot as an excuse for their own continued buildup. China has also cited the American example for other actions, such as the establishment of their Air Defense Identification Zone. Former Chinese State Councilor, Dai Bingguo, suggested to Hillary Clinton: \\"Why don't you 'pivot out of here?'\\"Hillary Rodman Clinton, Hard Choices, (New York & London: Simon & Schuster Paperbacks, 2014), p 71. Former President Hu Jintao stated: On 4 June 2013, the Asia- Pacific Strategy Working Group at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) released Securing U.S. Interests and Values in the Asia-Pacific, a memorandum to President Barack Obama and the United States Congress. The President of the United States can achieve his goals in the Asia-Pacific, the memorandum argues, by working with Congress to employ a comprehensive, long-term strategy that satisfies the following four conditions: promoting economic integration and liberalization; strengthening alliances and security partnerships; reinforcing U.S. military posture in the Asia-Pacific; draw on the full range of U.S. diplomatic and national power. Prem Mahadevan, senior researcher at the Center for Security Studies (CSS) at ETH Zurich, argues that two complementing circumstances in the Asia-Pacific have precipitated the pivot: \\"The security dynamic in East Asia is two layered; one layer consists of regional actors pursuing their own agendas, while the second consists of global influences which are propelling China into a geopolitical contest against the United States. On a grand strategic level, both sets of dynamics feed into one another.\\" Consequently, newly commissioned ships and fifth generation aircraft are being prioritized for the Pacific theater of U.S. military operations to maintain the balance of power. \\"It is expected that when the 'rebalancing' or 'pivot' of forces from the Atlantic to the Pacific is complete, 60 percent of the U.S. Navy will be based in the Pacific ‚Äì a 10 percent increase from current levels. In effect, the theater would gain one additional U.S. aircraft carrier, seven destroyers, ten littoral combat ships and two submarines, plus reconnaissance assets such as EP3 spy planes.\\" In contrast the permanent bases and other infrastructure of the Cold War, the pivot will use rotational deployments to host nation facilities. James F. Amos has said that by avoiding a few large bases, the American forces will be a harder target for ballistic missiles. The power of the pivot will be boosted by American arms sales to the region. Senator John McCain moved to block funding for the realignment, citing a lack of a solid plan. The pivot took a hit from the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 as Obama was forced to remain in Washington and so could not attend APEC Indonesia 2013. Commander of Pacific Air Forces Herbert J. Carlisle has acknowledged that resources have not been committed to the pivot due to other American commitments and Budget sequestration in 2013. Katrina McFarland, assistant secretary of defense for acquisition, has said that the pivot was being reconsidered in light of the budget pressures. Think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council (WPC) have argued that the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank constitutes to a large extent an economic response to a geopolitical \\"encirclement strategy\\" aimed at containing China: \\"To contain China, the US sought new defence and trade alliances across Asia from Baku to Borneo, with limited success. Despite Washington's insistent nudging, Tokyo and Seoul have been reluctant to strengthen their bilateral military and economic ties. But as the 'liberal hawks' of Washington DC rather clumsily deployed this encirclement strategy, the Chinese leadership did not stay idle. And one of their ripostes was in international finance,\\" observing that the \\"establishment of a new supranational financial institution based in Beijing needn't trigger vain geopolitical rivalries. China and the West can work successfully together to build a more prosperous, equitable economic order across the Asia-Pacific region.\\"  China  President Barack Obama addresses the opening session of the first U.S.‚ÄìChina Strategic and Economic Dialogue. Listening at left are Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan, center, and Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo, left. In a speech given 13 February 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that \\"some believe that China on the rise is, by definition, an adversary\\", but \\"to the contrary, we believe that the United States and China can benefit from and contribute to each other's successes. It is in our interests to work harder to build on areas of common concern and shared opportunities.\\" Clinton left on her first foreign policy tour (to Asia) on 15 February 2009 including scheduled stops in Japan, China, South Korea, and Indonesia. Joining her on this trip was Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern. It had been earlier reported by U.S. officials and media that Vice President Joe Biden could emerge as the figure to spearhead U.S.‚ÄìChina relations. Clinton was reported to have fought hard to obtain the China file and lead the comprehensive dialogue with China. The Financial Times noted an inter-agency rivalry between the State Department and Treasury Department over the management of the U.S.-China relationship. Prior to leaving on her tour of Asia, Clinton remarked, \\"We see the Chinese economic relationship as essential to our own country, so we're going to consult and work in a way that will be mutually beneficial.\\" Clinton attracted criticism, though, when she suggested that U.S. criticism of the human rights record of China should not be allowed to \\"interfere\\" with cooperation with Beijing on resolving global economic, environmental, and security crises. Less than a week later, a report signed by Clinton criticizing the PRC on its human rights violations in 2008 was released by the U.S. State Department. In response, Beijing issued a report accusing Washington of utilising human rights concerns in China for political gain and suggesting that Americans were turning a 'blind eye' to their own violations of human rights. On 1 April 2009, Obama and Hu Jintao announced the establishment of the high-level U.S.‚ÄìChina Strategic and Economic Dialogue co-chaired by Hillary Clinton and Timothy Geithner on the U.S. side and Dai Bingguo and Wang Qishan on the Chinese side. On 16 May 2009, Obama announced his intention to nominate Jon Huntsman Jr., the Republican Governor of Utah to fill the position of Ambassador to China. Huntsman was the only ambassador in the Administration to be personally announced by the President. The United States Senate needed to confirm the appointment. Huntsman said that he and President Barack Obama believe that the United States' relationship with China is its most important in the world. Huntsman's nomination has thus far garnered positive reactions from both China and the U.S. Senate. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner visited China from 31 May ‚Äì 2 June 2009 and had discussions with top Chinese political and economic leaders. He had the opportunity to meet with Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice Premier Wang Qishan, and delivered a speech at Peking University, where he studied. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke and Energy Secretary Steven Chu traveled to China from 14 to 17 July. Japan Toshimi Kitazawa given an Operation Tomodachi banner on 4 April 2011.

In her inaugural tour of East Asia, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reassured Japanese officials of Japan's centrality in the network of American alliances. In a response to the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, the United States initiated Operation Tomodachi to support for Japan's disaster relief following the natural disaster earning gratitude from Japan's Minister of Defense, Toshimi Kitazawa, who while visiting the , thanked its crew for its assistance as part of Operation Tomodachi saying, \\"I have never been more encouraged by and proud of the fact that the United States is our ally.\\"Kyodo News, \\"Japanese defense chief thanks U.S. military for humanitarian efforts\\", 4 April 2011.  North Korea  Obama and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak walking after a meeting at the Blue House in Seoul in November 2010. Not long after Obama took office as President of the United States on 20 January 2009, North Korea elbowed its way back onto the international stage after a period of relative quiet during the waning months of the Bush administration. But in spite of a pledge, made during George W. Bush's last few weeks as president, to denuclearize, North Korea drew accusations of planning a new long-range intercontinental ballistic missile test weeks after Obama was sworn in. The accusations, which came mostly from Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States, were countered by Pyongyang's insistence that the alleged rocket launch preparation identified by U.S. spy satellite observation was actually groundwork for a North Korean satellite launch. Obama, in solidarity with Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso, warned North Korea against \\"provocative\\" gestures such as a rocket launch. The United States Navy has declared its readiness to use missile defense systems to shoot down a North Korean missile if one is launched, either offensively or as a test, with Admiral Timothy Keating saying that the fleet awaited the president's order. However, North Korea warned on 9 March 2009, that such a shootdown would \\"precisely mean a war\\". Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stirred controversy on 19 February 2009, when she admitted that the Obama administration was concerned over a possible succession crisis in North Korea, in reference to the recent apparent illness of reclusive leader Kim Jong-il. While on a tour of East Asia over the following days, Clinton expressed the Obama administration's desire to engage in negotiations with the North Korean government to seek nuclear disarmament for the socialist state. On 20 February 2009, the U.S. State Department, led by Clinton, appointed Stephen Bosworth as Special Representative for North Korea Policy. Bosworth embarked on a mission to East Asia in early March 2009 and reportedly met with Chinese, Russian, Japanese, and South Korean officials to discuss the North Korean nuclear situation. Following unannounced nuclear warhead and missile testing by North Korea in late May 2009, Obama's State Department expressed disapproval, calling the actions a violation of a 2006 United Nations Security Council resolution. After Pyongyang announced its intention to terminate the 1953 armistice ending hostilities in the Korean War on 28 May the South Korea- United States Combined Forces Command went to Watchcon II, the second-highest alert level possible. In 2010, two more major incidents with North Korea would occur under the Obama Administration: the sinking of a South Korean Navy Ship that actuated new rounds of military exercises with South Korea as a direct military response to sinkingU.S., South Korea plan military exercises, by Julian E. Barnes and Paul Richter, Los Angeles Times, 25 May 2010. and the Bombardment of Yeonpyeong prompting the US Navy aircraft carrier to depart for joint exercises in the Yellow Sea with the Republic of Korea Navy, in part to deter further North Korean military action. In light of the geopolitical developments with North Korea, the Obama Administration has dubbed the U.S.-South Korean alliance as a \\"cornerstone of US security in the Pacific Region.\\" The United States has increased its military presence on the East Asian mainland. President Bush withdrew 40 percent of U.S. troops from South Korea after \\"recognizing that South Korean forces required less U.S. assistance to manage the threat from North Korea...\\" The Obama administration has reversed this trend. The last three years have seen the United States oversee its largest military exercise with South Korea since the Korean War, along with an increased troop presence to buttress the 38th Parallel.  Myanmar (formerly Burma)  The Obama administration initially continued longstanding American reticence in dealing with Union of Myanmar after taking over in January 2009, preferring to prioritize broader security threats like Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan. Susan E. Rice, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, called the junta government's hold over Myanmar, formerly Burma, \\"one of the most intractable challenges for the global community\\". Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed that the Obama administration was \\"looking at what steps we might take that might influence the current Myanmar government and ... looking for ways that we could more effectively help the Myanmar people\\", though she echoed Rice's pessimism in noting the junta's historical isolationism and disregard for economic sanctions. At the urging of Aung San Suu Kyi and the US's East Asian partners, the US held the first formal meetings with the junta in late 2009. In November 2011, Obama spoke with Aung San Suu Kyi on the phone where they agreed to a visit by Secretary of State Clinton to Myanmar. Obama is expected to meet Myanmar President Thein Sein at the Sixth East Asia Summit. Clinton made a two-day visit from 1 December 2011. Barack Obama visited Myanmar on 18 November 2012, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so. Obama also visited Aung San Suu Kyi in her home.  Thailand  On 13 April 2009, the United States Department of State condemned violence by protesters, calling on the protesters to use their freedom of assembly in a peaceful manner.  Laos  As part of Secretary Clinton's trip to East Asia in July 2012, she visited Vientiane on July 11. John Foster Dulles had been the last Secretary of State to visit Laos, 57 years earlier.

In 2012 the Philippines and the United States conducted joint military exercises. As of 2012, a U.S. military contingent of 600, including Navy Seals and Seabees are stationed \\"indefinitely\\" in the Southern Philippines, in a declared non-combatant role to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in operations against the al- Quaida-linked Abu Sayyaf terrorist group primarily on the island of Basilan in western Mindanao and the Sulu islands, in particular Jolo, a long-time stronghold of Abu Sayyaf. During the visit by President Benigno Aquino III to Washington DC, on July 7, 2012, the US-Philippine Society was launched. It is a non-profit independent organisation tasked for generating awareness about the Philippines in the US. The last board meeting was conducted by the society on January 24, 2013. The Scarborough Shoal standoff with China and the ongoing Spratly islands dispute has caused the Philippines to consider stronger military ties with the United States. In 2012, a senior Philippine defense official said that as long as they have prior clearance from the Philippine government, American troops, warships and aircraft could once again use their former naval and air facilities of Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base.US troops can use Clark, Subic bases, Philippine Star, June 6, 2012. In 2013, Foreign Secretary, Albert del Rosario clarified that, due to constitutional constraints, establishment of a US military facility could only be allowed if it would be under the control of the Philippine military.\\"Welcome more US troops‚ÄìDel Rosario.\\", Philippine Daily Inquirer, April 14, 2013. The deal will reportedly include shared access to Philippines military but not civilian facilities. During a 2013 visit to the Philippines, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said that the main security issues that the USA was working with the Philippines were: * Maritime domain awareness, * building up the capacities of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, * and counter terrorism. In April 2014, a ten-year pact (EDCA ‚Äì Enhanced Defence Co-operation Agreement) was signed between the U.S. president, Barack Obama and the Philippine president, Benigno Aquino III, allowing United States to increase military presence in the Philippines. After President Rodrigo Duterte formally assumed the office on June 30, 2016, the US-Philippine relations began to sour. The drift between the Duterte and Obama relationship began when the U.S. president expressed his concern over human rights issues on President Duterte's \\"War on Criminality and Drugs\\". This intervention and President Duterte's choice of words while speaking about President Obama during a press conference, where he infamously called him \\"a son of a whore\\" resulted in a canceled meeting between the two leaders during the 2016 ASEAN summit held in Laos. A few weeks after, Duterte suggested American special forces to cease its operations and leave Mindanao. He cited the killings of Muslim Filipinos during a U.S. pacification campaign in the early 1900s, which he said were at the root of the long restiveness by minority Muslims in the largely Catholic nation's south. It was only during his official visit to Vietnam last September 28, 2016 when he explicitly expressed that he wants an end to the Philippines' joint military exercises with the United States, saying the upcoming scheduled war games will be the last under his term, while adding that he will continue to uphold the Philippines' treaties with the US. A crowd of Muslims were attending a speech by Duterte where he accused America of bringing terrorism to themselves, saying that terrorism is not the result of the Middle East. He railed against the actions undertaken in the Middle East by the USA. Duterte blamed the war on Mindanao on colonialist Christianity being brought to the Philippines in 1521 by Ferdinand Magellan saying there was peace before that, and that they were made to fight their \\"Malay brother\\" by Christians.  Vietnam  The United States has increased its military presence in Indochina. In the 1990s, Washington rebuffed Vietnam's requests for more defense ties. This changed in 2010 when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for the first time since the Vietnam War, called for an American‚ÄìVietnamese strategic partnership. \\"Since then, the U.S. Navy has held annual exercises with the Vietnamese navy, and in 2011, the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation.\\" The Obama Administration has attempted to capitalize on the much evolved relations between the United States and Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War. The formal normalization of relations occurred in 1995, subsequently expanding under both the Clinton and Bush Administrations with dialogues and agreements on human rights, civil aviation, and free trade. In August 2010, the U.S. Department of Defense and Vietnam's Ministry of Defense held the first round of high-level defense talks, known as the Defense Policy Dialogue.State Department Background Vietnam.

Blake Jr., Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs who wrote \\"[o]ur goal was and remains to support the development of sovereign, stable, democratic nations, integrated into the world economy and cooperating with one another, the United States, and our partners to advance regional security and stability.\\" The interests of the United States and South Asia have converged. The US and South Asia are at a unique place in time and history for building and cementing strong ties between the South Asian nations and its peoples, and these two blocks are determined to do so. The region is now, and will long remain, at the forefront of America's foreign policy concerns. The United States is committed to help South Asia achieve the bright future that it deserves. The American Chamber of Commerce is an important partner that is helping to strengthen ties between the United States and South Asia. Through counting on the business community for leadership and insight, and South Asia's strong linkages with businesses in the United States and throughout the region, this relationship will deepen and broaden relations. The American Chamber of Commerce in South Asian countries is a vocal proponent of economic and political reform.  Countries   Afghanistan  Zardari (right) with president Barack Obama (center) and president Hamid Karzai (left) during a US‚ÄìAfghan‚ÄìPakistan Trilateral meeting Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Michael Mullen all argued for further troops, and Obama dispatched additional soldiers after a lengthy review process. On February 17, 2009, Obama announced that the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be bolstered by 17,000 new troops by the summer. The announcement followed the recommendation of several experts including Defense Secretary Robert Gates that additional troops be deployed to the strife-torn South Asian country. The Obama Department of Justice submitted a court filing that there would be no immediate change from Bush-era policy to deny detainees at Bagram Air Force Base access to U.S. courts in order to appeal their detention. The U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan, that were begun by President George W. Bush, increased substantially since an expansion of the attacks was authorized by President Barack Obama in 2009. Drones have resulted in civilian casualties, and intentionally targeted rescuers, funerals, and one U.S. citizen. UN reports have described the U.S. drone wars as extrajudicial killing and summary executions.Nebehay, Stephanie, \\"U.N. Investigator Decries U.S. Use Of Killer Drones\\", Reuters, 19 June 2012 (wire service report) Though the drone strikes killed high-ranking terrorists, they were also criticized for resulting in civilian casualties. A 2013 Pew research poll showed that the strikes were broadly unpopular in Pakistan, and some former members of the Obama administration have criticized the strikes for causing a backlash against the United States. However, based on 147 interviews conducted in 2015, professor Aqil Shah argued that the strikes were popular in North Waziristan, the area in which most of the strikes take place, and that little blowback occurred. In 2009, the UN special investigator on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions called the United States' reliance on drones \\"increasingly common\\" and \\"deeply troubling\\", and called on the U.S. to justify its use of targeted assassinations rather than attempting to capture al Qaeda or Taliban suspects. In 2013, Obama appointed John Brennan as the new CIA Director and announced a new policy that required CIA operatives to determine with a \\"near-certainty\\" that no civilians would be hurt in a drone strike. The number of drone strikes fell substantially after the announcement of the new policy, In August 2009, Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Tehrik- i-Taliban Pakistan TTP was killed in a drone strike, which was one of the early successes of the Obama administration General Stanley A. McChrystal, argued in September and October 2009 that success in Afghanistan \\"demands a substantial expansion of the American presence,\\" \\"up to 40,000 more troops.\\" Some foreign policy analysts and political commentators criticized the General for making public statements about political matters while others supported the proposed increase in the number of troops deployed to Afghanistan. In a speech on 1 December 2009 that Obama delivered at United States Military Academy at West Point (also known as USMA, West Point) and announcing a long- awaited strategy, Obama said another 30,000 American troops would be deployed quickly in Afghanistan,\\"Obama‚Äôs Address on the War in Afghanistan \\"\\"Remarks by the President in Address to the Nation on the Way Forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan\\" while Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the US Congress that \\"curbing the Taliban\\" was \\"essential for regional security\\". In a speech to the Senate Armed Services Committee he stressed that the US goal in Afghanistan and Pakistan was \\"to defeat the al-Qaeda network ‚Äì and to do that, the Taliban must be pushed back\\". Taliban-ruled areas could in short order become again sanctuaries for al-Qaeda and militant groups fighting in Pakistan. Obama identified several objectives in Afghanistan and Pakistan: (1) disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda; (2) deny al-Qaeda a safe haven; (3) reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow the Afghan government; and (4) strengthen the capacity of the Afghan security forces and government to better protect and serve population centers. To accomplish this, he ordered the deployment of the additional 30,000 troops to the region, which would bring the U.S. total to almost 100,000 troops. This deployment would be staged over the following six months, with the full additional complement intended to be in-country by summer 2010. He expressed his confidence that some of 42 coalition allies would also increase their contributions. NATO Secretary-General Rasmussen stated that he expected NATO allies to contribute at least an additional 5,000 troops in 2010. The Taliban reacted to the announcement by saying they would step up their fight in Afghanistan. A Taliban commander told the BBC that if more US troops came, more would die.Taliban vow to fight US troop surge in Afghanistan The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan would peak at 100,000 in 2010. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article. On June 22, 2011, President Obama addressed the nation from the White House in the East room where he stated \\"we will be able to remove 10,000 of our troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year, and we will bring home a total of 33,000 troops by next summer, fully recovering the surge I announced at West Point. After this initial reduction, our troops will continue coming home at a steady pace as Afghan security forces move into the lead. Our mission will change from combat to support. By 2014, this process of transition will be complete, and the Afghan people will be responsible for their own security\\". In 2012, the U.S. and Afghanistan signed a strategic partnership agreement in which the U.S. agreed to hand over major combat operation to Afghan forces. That same year, the Obama administration designated Afghanistan as a major non-NATO ally. In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014. In 2014, Obama announced that most troops would leave Afghanistan by late 2016, with a small force remaining at the US embassy. In September 2014, Ashraf Ghani succeeded Hamid Karzai as the President of Afghanistan after the U.S. helped negotiate a power-sharing agreement between Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah. On January 1, 2015, the U.S. military ended Operation Enduring Freedom and began Resolute Support Mission, in which the U.S. shifted to more of a training role, although some combat operations continued. In January 2015, United States Forces began conducting drone strikes in Afghanistan under the direction of the administration of the United States President Barack Obama against Taliban militants, Pakistani Taliban (TTP) militants, ISIL branch in Afghnistan militants and Al-Qaeda militants. In October 2015, Obama announced that U.S. soldiers would remain in Afghanistan indefinitely in order support the Afghan government in the civil war against the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and ISIL. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Martin Dempsey framed the decision to keep soldiers in Afghanistan as part of a long-term counter-terrorism operation stretching across Central Asia. Obama left office with roughly 8,400 U.S. soldiers remaining in Afghanistan.  Death of Osama bin Laden  thumb|President Obama's address (9:28) Also available: Audio only; Obama and members of the national security team receive an update on alt=President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, receive an update on Operation Neptune's Spear, a mission against Osama bin Laden, in one of the conference rooms of the Situation Room of the White House, on May 1, 2011. They are watching live feed from drones operating over the bin Laden complex. Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area from Islamabad. CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011. Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \\"surgical raid\\" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs. The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound. DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse, which was buried at sea several hours later. Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square. Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. President Obama later announced the Death of Osama Bin laden in his address to the nation from the White House stating \\"the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who‚Äôs responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children. It was nearly 10 years ago that a bright September day was darkened by the worst attack on the American people in our history. The images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory\\" Bangladesh Bangladesh Minister of Foreign Affairs Dipu Moni and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the State Department in 2011. Bangladesh‚ÄìU.S. relations under the Barack Obama Administration by most normal indicators, banks on a bright future. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she was \\"betting on Bangladesh\\" when she visited Bangladesh in July 2012. In the last two decades, Bangladesh has made marked progress in the economic arena and in some key areas of development. Bangladesh has become agriculturally self-sufficient; dramatically reduced its birth rate; highly improved literacy rates; delivered basic social services to its people; and empowered women through employment and education. As the fourth most populous Muslim country in the world, Bangladesh's voice of moderation in regional and international fora is widely respected and appreciated. U.S.‚ÄìBangladesh relations were boosted in March 2000 when U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Bangladesh, the first-ever visit by a sitting U.S. President, then Secretary of State Colin Powell's visit in June 2003, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's visit in June 2004. Relations between Bangladesh and the United States steadily strengthened by the participation of Bangladesh Armed Forces in the 1991 Gulf War coalition, and alongside U.S. forces in numerous UN peacekeeping operations, including Haiti in 1994, as well as assisting a U.S. Naval task force. Between 2005 and 2008, the United States obligated $5.2 million in grant aid funding (Foreign Military Financing) to purchase Defender class High Speed Motor boats, under water demolition training and diving equipment for the Bangladesh Coast Guard, and allocated $934,000 in IMET (International Military Education and Training) for 2007. Additionally, Bangladesh has become a valuable United States ally in global efforts to control terrorism. As part of these efforts, the Government of Bangladesh has begun to address problems of money laundering and weak border controls to ensure that Bangladesh does not become a terrorist safe- haven. However, neighboring nation India is consistent in its rogue policies against Bangladesh. Despite porous borders, ungoverned spaces, and poor service delivery, Bangladesh's strong national identity and moderate traditions help it serve as a key player in combating over the border extremism. The two sides agreed to enhance partnership in UN Peacekeeping, counterterrorism and disaster management. The whole gamut of on-going security cooperation between the two countries in counterterrorism, disaster management, maritime security and peacekeeping operations, and shared commitment to peace, security and prosperity in the region, are consistent. A press release of the US Embassy in Dhaka said the positive and substantial work on the exchanges and dialogues reflected the depth and strength of the bilateral defense relationship as well as shared commitment to peace and prosperity in the region. Both nations maintain Defense Attache Wings of the host embassy's. In It said: \\"This Significant Dialogue on Security Issues highlights the robust engagement between the United States and Bangladesh as well as our growing defense relationship.\\" Describing Bangladesh as an important partner of the US in dealing with many traditional and non- traditional security issues, Andrew Shapiro stressed the strategic importance of Bangladesh in the broader U.S. economic and security interest. Apart from U.S.‚ÄìBangladesh partnership in the much talked about global war on terror, as are its other South Asian neighbors, a deeper degree of bilateral security cooperation has been ongoing behind closed doors. This dialogue transcended bilateralism and Bangladesh has been officially taken on in a U.S.- South Asian security loop. On March 2, 2012, head of U.S. Pacific Command Admiral Robert Willard visited Bangladesh, and later said at a Congressional hearing that U.S. Special Forces teams were currently stationed in this South Asian country for tactical training purposes‚ÄîBangladesh‚Äîas part of the counter- terrorism cooperation with that nation. \\"South Asia is home to a confluence of challenges, including nuclear armed rivals India and Pakistan. In Bangladesh's case, numerous transnational VEOs such as the Indian Lashkar-e-Toiba, piracy, over the border trafficking in narcotics and persons, disputed borders with India, and Bangladesh border being a sensitive one because of the insurgent movements that have plagued India.http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news- details.php?nid=231482 The U.S. understands the potential of Bangladesh as the seventh largest populous (Muslim majority) country in the world; secondly, the U.S. sees the country emerging as the next \\"Tiger in Asia\\" provided it remains politically stable; and also the US values Bangladesh for its geo-political importance. Bangladesh is the bridgehead between South and Southeast Asia, with a close border to China and a littoral state of Indian Ocean with two seaports of high potential at Mongla and Chittagong. The U.S. Ambassador in Bangladesh Dan Mozena has been consistently upbeat in his remarks about Bangladesh when he remarked, \\"Indeed, we have moved a long way ahead since Henry Kissinger's labeling of Bangladesh as a basket case in the early 70s\\", in resonance with the political and economic situation of the time.http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=242737 That the United States is attaching increasing importance to her relationship with Bangladesh has been illustrated by a flurry of visits by U.S. dignitaries to Dhaka in the year 2012. They included U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Robert O. Blake Jr., Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy R. Sherman and Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Andrew J. Shapiro. All this was followed by the visit of the highest U.S. defense official, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, between July 13 and 15. Cooperation between the navies of the two countries began with discussions at length. The series of inter-state contacts climaxed with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signing up to Bangladesh-US Partnership Dialogue Framework. The maiden annual meeting under the framework is likely to be held in September 2012.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/bangladesh/forrel-us.htm Nilanthi Samaranayake, Strategic Studies Analyst at CNA in Alexandria, VA, writing for Asia-Pacific Bulletin (Sept 22, 2011), East-West Center underscored: \\"The prospects for advancing U.S. security ties with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka deserve serious examination.\\" The reasons for such a shift of emphasis can be ticked off in the following order: While relations with India \\"may not progress as quickly as desired\\" and those with Pakistan and Afghanistan are \\"in tatters,\\" the United States needs to forge deeper strategic relationship with the \\"marginal states.\\" Such states,\\" according to Doug Lieb in the Harvard International Review, \\"are often overlooked in a structural realist world view that privileges the study of larger countries.\\" Bangladesh and Sri Lanka being maritime countries exude significant potential for securing Indian Ocean sea lanes in the eyes of China and United States, of course with implications independent of India. Today Bangladesh exports stand at US$25 billion worth of goods worldwide and is expected to increase rapidly with infrastructure development, political stability and sound governance. At $1.8 billion, the United States is Bangladesh‚Äôs biggest foreign investor, but new foreign investment is going down, not up. Privatization, export diversification, deregulation, financial sector reform, and major infrastructure investments are essential to reverse the declining foreign investment trends and achieve steady economic growth. The key factor stemming from Bangladesh's international relations  India  India was not one of the countries the new Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited on her first multi-nation visit to Japan, Indonesia, South Korea and China in February 2009. The Foreign Policy magazine reported that even though Foreign Policy Staff of the Bush administration had recommended India as a \\"key stop\\" during any such official tour of Asia, Clinton decided not to visit New Delhi.A U.S. Asia strategy for Hillary Clinton's trip The exclusion of India from the Asian tour was regarded as a \\"mistake\\" by several analysts.Mrs. Clinton Goes To China Analysts also noted that India was not even mentioned once in the Obama administration's official foreign policy agenda.THE AGENDA ‚Ä¢ FOREIGN POLICY Tunku Varadarajan an Indian columnist in Forbes magazines, alerted Obama on the need to prevent United States' new-found alliance with India from erosion.Obama Should Visit India‚ÄîSoon In an editorial, The National Interest suggested that the Obama administration could possibly damage \\"the foundations underlying the geostrategic partnership\\" between India and the United States.

This official state visit followed a visit to India by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in July. President Obama became the first US president to be the chief guest of India's Republic Day celebrations of India held on 26 January 2015.

Pakistan  Clinton with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani during an October 2009 visit to Islamabad. As a presidential candidate, Obama was noted for his tough stance on Pakistan. \\"If the United States has al Qaeda, bin Laden, top-level lieutenants in our sights, and Pakistan is unable or unwilling to act, then we should take them out,\\" Obama asserted at a September 26, 2008, presidential debate with John McCain. The Republican candidate responded, \\"You don‚Äôt say that out loud. If you have to do things, you have to do things, and you work with the Pakistani government.‚Äù Since Obama took office, U.S. foreign policy toward Pakistan has deviated little from that of the Bush administration, with Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta hailing the former administration's strategy of using unmanned aerial vehicles to strike at al Qaeda and Taliban bases within Pakistan and Obama ordering the expansion of airstrikes to include the organization of Baitullah Mehsud, the militant chief reportedly behind the 2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto, as priority targets. In response to a ceasefire agreement between Islamabad and the Pakistani Taliban establishing sharia law in the Swat Valley of Pakistan, the Obama administration has adopted a 'wait and watch' policy, with Admiral Mike Mullen stating a continued need for intercommunication and cross-cultural understanding between the U.S. and Pakistan. He also has ordained a common geo-strategical approach towards Afghanistan and Pakistan, a policy known as \\"AfPak\\". Monday 9 February 2009: report by The Guardian said by an American general that \\"Pakistan, not Iraq, Afghanistan or Iran, is the most urgent foreign policy issue facing Obama\\", furthermore by Obama aide saying that nation that 'scares' them ; because of the situation that it faces and how it affect U.S. foreign policy. While Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi praised the Obama administration as \\"really willing to listen to us\\" during three-party talks with Afghan and American officials in February concerning the war on terrorism, the Pakistani government also adopted a new proposal asking the U.S. to turn over aerial attack drones to Islamabad to allow the Pakistani Air Force to continue anti-militant airstrikes in the North-West Frontier Province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas on the Afghan border. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs declined to comment on the request. On February 27, 2009, Obama gave an interview to Jim Lehrer in which he said, \\"Obviously, we haven't been thinking regionally, recognizing that Afghanistan is actually an Afghanistan/Pakistan problem.\\" Later in May, the U.S., in an effort to strengthen trust with Pakistan, said they would start 'sharing drone surveillance data with Pakistan, says Mike Mullen (U.S. general) ' In late October 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Pakistan. Her talks with the government there were aimed at getting direct, open discussions going regarding the level of Pakistan's efforts in fighting terrorism, al Qaeda and al Qaeda sanctuaries. Furthermore, in a speech in Pakistan capital Islamabad, she 'vowed' support Pakistan military efforts against the militants and that the U.S. would continue to support Pakistan; she also said 'These extremists are committed to destroying that which is dear to us, as much as they are committed to destroying that which is dear to you, and to all people, ... So this is our struggle as well, and we commend the Pakistani military for their courageous fight, and we commit to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pakistani people in your fight for peace and security.\\" On December 1, 2009, President Obama in a speech on a policy about Pakistan said 'In the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. Those days are over ... The Pakistani people must know America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan‚Äôs security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed'. In October, U.S. Congress approves $7.5 billion non-military aid package to Pakistan over the next 5 years. Then later in February 2010 Obama seeks to increase funds to Pakistan; these funds would 'promotes economic and political stability in strategically important regions where the United States has special security interests'. Obama also seeks $3.1 billions aid for Pakistan to defeat Al Qaeda in the 2010 fiscal year. In February 2010, Anne W. Patterson (U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan) said that United States is committed to partnership with Pakistan and further said, \\"Making this commitment to Pakistan while the U.S. is still recovering from the effects of the global recession reflects the strength of our vision. Yet we have made this commitment, because we see the success of Pakistan, its economy, its civil society and its democratic institutions as important for ourselves, for this region and for the world.\\" In mid February, after the capture of Taliban No.2 leader Abdul Ghani Baradar in Pakistan, the White House 'hails capture of Taliban leader'. Furthermore, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said that this is a \\"big success for our mutual efforts(Pakistan and United States)in the region\\" and He praised Pakistan for the capture, saying it is a sign of increased cooperation with the U.S. in the terror fight. Furthermore, Capt. John Kirby, spokesman for Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said 'We also strongly support Pakistani efforts to secure the border region, Kirby added, noting that Pakistan has lost soldiers in that effort.' Mullen, (President Barack Obama's senior military adviser) has made strengthening 'U.S. military relationship with Pakistan a top priority'. The U.S. and Pakistan have a robust working relationship that serves the mutual interests of our people,' Kirby said. \\"We continue to build a long-term partnership that strengthens our common security and prosperity.\\".

Though the capital was moved again only sixteen years later, this represented an important step in the development of the Yamato state, the seat of power of which had been quite transitory and nomadic up until this point.Mason, Penelope. (1993). History of Japanese Art, p. 41. The decades of the Hakuh≈ç period also saw many other major developments in political structure and in culture, including the introduction of writing and development of calligraphy in Japan. Chinese characters had been seen and used in Japan for centuries prior, but it was during the 7th century that, as one scholar describes it, \\"writing and the art of its production‚Äîor calligraphy‚Äîhas a sudden and spectacular flowering\\".Mason, p. 46. Art and architecture The term \\"Hakuh≈ç period\\" is chiefly applied in discussions of architecture, sculpture, and painting. Hundreds of Buddhist temples were built in the Hakuh≈ç period, including Kawara-dera, Daikandai-ji and Yakushi-ji in Fujiwara-ky≈ç, in styles showing considerable Tang-dynasty China influence. Wakakusa-dera, which had burnt down in 670, was also rebuilt at this time as H≈çry≈´-ji, showing the same stylistic influences.Hanshin Electric Railway - Area Guide \\"With the Tang Dynasty-style and Chinese western region-style designs seen in the platform for the image of Buddha in the Main Hall, Yakushi-ji Temple is regarded as the terminal point of the Silk Road.\\"Mason. pp. 61‚Äì62. When Baekje was ruined in 660, The refugee was naturalized in Japan. And they played a major role in designing and constructing these temples, and taught and trained their Japanese counterparts. At the time, stone and bronze were the chief media used for Buddhist statues in Japan, and would remain so on the continent for quite some time to come;Morse, Anne Nishimura. \\"Art of the Temple\\". in mfa Highlights: Arts of Japan. Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 2008. p. 34. however, in Japan, the wood carved statues which would come to dominate in later centuries began to appear as early as the Hakuh≈ç period. H≈çry≈´-ji The statues in H≈çry≈´-ji serve as good examples of Hakuh≈ç period sculpture; nearly all date to that period.Mason, pp. 77-80. Most are made of wood, with a single block used for the bodies, and separate blocks for secondary elements, such as demons upon which the deity treads, halos, and parts of the deities' skirts. All were originally painted and gilded, and bear rounder forms with a stronger impact of three-dimensionality than the Asuka period statues of earlier decades. In these aspects and others, they reflect strong stylistic influences from Three Kingdoms of Korea, Tang-dynasty China, and from the stylistic heritage of the Northern Qi and Sui Dynasties which came before. Another group of statues from the same temple show another important development, namely, the first use of lacquer not solely as a protective or decorative coating for statues, but as a material from which accessories, such as a bodhisattva's jewellery, hair ornaments, and hair, might be made, to be attached onto the wooden sculpture. A series of mural paintings on the walls of the kond≈ç (\\"Golden Hall\\"; Main Hall) of H≈çry≈´-ji, depicting various Buddhist figures, represent some of the best extant examples of Hakuh≈ç period painting. Though a 1949 fire left most of the paintings blackened to the point of illegibility, the process can still be determined. Plaster was applied to the walls layer by layer, each layer increasingly fine. Once the plaster was dry, holes were punched in the preliminary sketches for the painting (known as a cartoon), and colored sand or powder was applied, passing through the holes and sticking to the surface of the wall, providing an outline or rough guideline for the painter to then follow. These H≈çry≈´-ji murals represent two painting elements distinctive of this period: the use of red rather than black to outline the figures and, on other sections, a consistent line lacking calligraphic flourish and known as \\"iron wire\\" line.Mason, pp. 82‚Äì83. Yakushi-ji Yakushi-ji was founded in the Hakuh≈ç period in 680.Nussbaum, \\"Yakushi-ji\\" at A number of Buddhist statues at Yakushi-ji temple are counted among the finest extant examples of Hakuh≈ç period sculpture, reflecting the influence of Tang Chinese styles more strongly than their counterparts in H≈çry≈´-ji.

These three figures were cast in bronze; and they were replaced in the Edo period after their destruction in earthquake or fire. The bodhisattvas are posed in the \\"hip-slung\\" (Sanskrit: tribhanga) pose and other Chinese motifs including grape leaves and the Symbols of the Four Directions are prevalent.

As well as shrubs and grasses wildlife on the island includes a range of unique flora and fauna. In particular the surrounding islets are important havens for many seabirds, although the seabird populations on Ascension island itself have been severely affected by introduced species, particularly cats. Location and description Map of Ascension Island Ascension Island lies in the Atlantic near the equator, 1700 km off the coast of Africa. The island still bears relics of its volcanic history including lava fields and cinder. Ascension is 97 km2, with a population of approximately 900. The residents are mainly employees and their families, often on short-term contracts with the Ascension Island Government, the military (Royal Air Force and United States Air Force) and commercial operations. The majority of food and other goods are imported from the UK and South Africa. The Royal Mail Ship brings in supplies from St Helena on a regular basis. The USAF air service provides links with Florida and Antigua. The UK Ministry of Defence air service provides links with the Falkland Islands and the UK. Flora There were never many trees on the island, which is covered by either desert or grass and shrub including some endemic: Euphorbia origanoides, Marattia purpurascens, Asplenium ascensionis, Xiphopteris ascensionense, Pteris adscensionis, Sporobolus caespitosus and Anogramma ascensionis. Most of the vegetation on Ascension Island today has been introduced by humans. Some of these species have spread dramatically and now occur throughout the Island. Approximately 25 species of plant are native and ten of these are considered to be endemic (unique) to Ascension. None of the remaining endemic species are common and their ranges have been reduced due to their inability to compete with the introduced species. The Ascension Island Conservation Department are working in collaboration with the Royal Botanic Garden, Kew on an OTEP (Overseas Territories Environmental Programme) funded Endemic Plants project. Experts from the UK Overseas Territories Team at Kew advise on propagation techniques, ex-situ cultivation and the re- introduction of endangered species. Horticultural protocols for each species are to be outlined, these will be used to improve local collections and further develop ex-situ plant collections. The protocols require a lot of trial and error work to identify the most successful propagation methods for the endemic plants. Stedson Stroud has already successfully cultivated in large numbers three of the endemic species, Pteris adscensionis, Euphorbia origanoides and Sporobolus caespitosus. The clearing of invasive species on Green Mountain has created a restoration site for the reintroduction of endemic species on the mountain. The project work focuses on increasing the number of endemic species growing in cultivation and introducing these into the restoration areas. Spurge (Euphorbia origanoides) This is the only endemic lowland plant in Ascension. It suffers from encroaching invasive vegetation as well as feeding by introduced animals. Rats seek it for moisture in its stems and roots, and insect pests also cause concern. The species is now limited to the most remote desert areas of the Island. Fauna Ascension Island is one of the most important warm-water seabird breeding sites in the tropical Atlantic. It supports over 400,000 seabirds of 11 species. The present size of the seabird populations are only a fraction of those found before the colonisation by man in 1815 and the subsequent introduction of feral cats to the Island. The Ascension Island Conservation Department, in partnership with the RSPB began a Seabird Restoration Project in 2001. The project was implemented by the Ascension Island Government, and assisted by the RSPB with funding from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Feral cats were eradicated from the Island, allowing the seabirds to return to nest on the mainland. The last known feral cat was found in February 2004, since then a feral cat monitoring programme has been taking place. Since the eradication of the feral cats the nesting success rate has improved and there are more birds in an increasing number of locations. Today the main breeding site is on nearby rat- free Boatswain Bird Island. Over 10,000 birds breed on this tiny island, which is home to fairy tern (Gygis alba), Ascension frigatebirds, masked booby, brown booby, red-footed booby, red-billed tropicbird and white-tailed tropicbirds (known as boatswain birds), and petrels. The sooty tern, known locally as the wideawake tern because of its distinctive call, is the most common breeding seabird on the main island, and the airport is named after it. The Ascension rail and the Ascension night heron are extinct. Ascension frigatebird (Fregata aquilana) Of the many seabird colonising Ascension's shores, the endemic frigatebird is the most impressive. Due to predation by cats these birds are now found on Boatswainbird Island, but as feral cats have been eradicated from Ascension, it is hoped they will soon follow the other seabirds back to the main Island. Giant pseudoscorpion (Garypus giganteus) Ascension is home to a remarkable pseudoscorpion fauna. The most impressive of these tailless scorpion-like creatures is the giant pseudoscorpion, largest of its kind. Predation by rodents and invertebrates on the mainland has limited its distribution to the very isolated Boatswainbird Island, where it lives alongside the endemic frigatebird. Green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) Ascension holds the second largest breeding site for the green turtle in the Atlantic. This species is dependent on sandy beaches to lay their eggs, and the beaches require regular clearing of invasive plants. Apart from the native landcrabs and endemic frigates, the hatchlings are now taken by mynas. Threats Since its discovery in 1501 a number of plants and animals have been introduced by settlers on the island, there are no native mammals to the islands and several of the introduced species have gone feral. Cats in particular have been a threat to the seabird populations and steps are now being taken to reduce the populations of both cats and rats in order to encourage the return of breeding seabirds. Meanwhile, the Mexican thorn bush (Prosopis juliflora), another introduced species, has become a serious impediment to the breeding turtles, who lay their eggs on the beaches, and housing development on the island threatens many habitats. Invasive species Mexican thorn (Prosopis juliflora) This shrub was introduced to stabilise land near new buildings in Two Boats village during the 1960s. It now forms a thick shrubland in drier parts of the Island. It has completely replaced the native vegetation in these areas and threatens bird grounds as well as turtle laying beaches. Guava (Psidium guajava) Guava is best known as a refreshing fruit, however, unfortunately on Ascension the fruit it not harvested due to its acidity. Guava causes significant problems in fragile environments such as Ascension Island. This species is one of the first shrubs to cover over sparsely vegetated areas. It can tolerate both hot desert areas as well as cool moist mountain air, and forms thickets that compete with native plants for water and light. Koster's curse (Clidemia hirta) This is one of the species that now occurs where a carpet of native and endemic ferns used to grow on Green Mountain. Along with many other introduced species it is capable of growing even in the last rocks which have so far acted as fern sanctuaries. Common myna (Acridotheres tristis) Myna birds were introduced as a way of tackling parasites on cattle, now absent from Ascension. They are opportunistic feeders and now feed on sooty tern eggs, turtle eggs and fruits of invasive species, acting as a dispersal agent. They are also noisy and clever pests in gardens, eating fruit and vegetables. Black rat (Rattus rattus) The black rat arrived to Ascension early in the Island's history and they are still the only species of rat here. They abound in all parts of the Island, feeding on endemic as well as introduced plants, preying on small animals and competing with land crabs. Threatened habitat - mountain vegetation The Green Mountain summit was once covered in a carpet of ferns with many endemic plants. Hardly any of this carpet now exists due to intensive efforts to increase vegetation in the mountain. Few small rocks still hold a number of endemic species, but even these areas are quickly being overwhelmed by invasive plants. Grazing animals also contribute to loss of native plants.

It is legal in most countries as a research chemical, as long as it is not intended for human consumption.  Chemistry  Buphedrone is a beta-ketone and is related to the naturally occurring compounds, cathinone and cathine. It is also related to methamphetamine, differing by the Œ≤-ketone substituent (at the beta carbon) and an ethyl group replacing the methyl group at the carbon alpha to the amine. One other name for Buphedrone is : Phenylacetoethyl-methylamine Buphedrone as free base is very unstable; the ketone is readily reduced to a hydroxyl group, thus forming the corresponding alcohol. Structurally, this occurs when the C=O bond at the RŒ≤- position is converted into a C-OH bond. Because of this, it is sold as various salts, with a hydrochloride being most common.  Effects  Buphedrone increases spontaneous rodent locomotor activity, potentiates the release of dopamine from dopaminergic nerve terminals in the brain, and causes appetite suppression. It also causes a possibly dangerous effect of decreasing subjective feeling of thirst. The effects of buphedrone have also been compared to methamphetamine, with more euphoria and less physical stimulation. Most commonly reported effects include: * Elevated mood, euphoria * Increased alertness * Dilated pupils (rare) * Slurred speech (rare) * Increased heart rate * Talkativeness * Increased empathy and sense of communication * Increased sex drive * Temporary erectile dysfunction in men * Restlessness * Insomnia * Increased motivation Depending on the route of administration, the duration varies from approximately 2.5 (IV) to 6 hours (orally) and may be followed by unpleasant symptoms associated with withdrawal, which may include: * Dysphoria * Tiredness * Sweating * Loss of concentration Legal Status As of October 2015 Buphedrone is a controlled substance in China.

On June 16, 2009, President Obama and his National Security Advisor James Jones met the Estonian Head of State Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who was on a working visit to the United States of America, in Washington. The main issues that were discussed at the meeting in the White House included the global economic recession, trans-Atlantic relations, the transparency and credibility of NATO as an organization established to protect its allies, and the current situation in Afghanistan, the most important foreign mission of the alliance. President Ilves affirmed that while Estonia, like its allies, had suffered severe losses, they would go all the way and will not desert the mission in Afghanistan.Estonian Review 10‚Äì16 June 2009, 19.06.2009 - Permanent Representation of Estonia to the EU  Kosovo  The United States is continuing its policy of recognition of the Republic of Kosovo under the Obama administration. According to The Sofia Echo, in late February 2009, the Pristina daily newspaper Koha Ditore reported that Kosovan President Fatmir Sejdiu, Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, and Foreign Minister Skender Hyseni were personally assured by United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that the Obama administration would lobby internationally to expand diplomatic recognition of Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and has been recognized by 56 countries as of March 2009.  Russia  In a speech on February 7, 2009, Vice President of the United States Joe Biden discussed a shift in U.S. policy towards Russia towards \\"co-operation and consultation\\" while National Security Advisor James L. Jones stated that U.S. foreign policy is undergoing \\"major policy reviews\\" and that \\"plans to put parts of the Pentagon's missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic ‚Äì a project that Moscow says could trigger a new arms race ‚Äì were being put on ice and that talks on the shield would be broadened.\\" Biden also stated that the \\"last few years have seen a dangerous drift in relations between Russia and our [NATO] alliance. It's time to press the reset button and to revisit the many areas where we can and should work together.\\". Prior to this meeting the Russian government suspended its plan to place missiles on the Polish border near Kaliningrad in response to White House assurances that the Obama administration was reviewing the Bush administration's plans to deploy a missile defense shield in Poland and the Czech Republic. Biden rejected the idea of a Russian \\"sphere of influence\\" during his speech, stating, \\"We will not agree with Russia on everything,\\" and said, \\"For example, the United States will not recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states\\" nor will we \\"recognize a sphere of influence. It will remain our view that sovereign states have the right to make their own decisions and choose their own alliances.\\" During his election campaign, Obama had stated that he intended to \\"work with Russia to take U.S. and Russian ballistic missiles off hair trigger alert [and] seek dramatic reductions in U.S. and Russian stockpiles of nuclear weapons and material.\\" In February 2009, The Daily Telegraph reported that former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had been in negotiation with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on behalf of the Obama administration. Kissinger had reportedly been discussing reducing nuclear inventories to 1,000 warheads on each side, as part of a deal to replace the expiring START I arms limitation treaty. On April 1, 2009, Obama and Medvedev met in London to discuss bilateral relations. In a joint statement, the two leaders said, \\"We ... are ready to move beyond Cold War mentalities and chart a fresh start in relations between our two countries.\\" They stated a mutual goal of a \\"nuclear-free\\" world and committed to renegotiating their treaties on intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear armaments. Presidents Obama and Medvedev during their July 6 meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow On July 6, 2009, President Barack Obama and President Dmitry Medvedev held a three-hour meeting in the Kremlin in Russia. They agreed in principle to cutting their nuclear stockpiles to below 1,700 deployed warheads within seven years after a new treaty is created. The START I treaty, which is the current nuclear weapons agreement between the two countries, expires in December 2009. Russia additionally allowed U.S. arms shipments to the battlefront in Afghanistan through Russia. During a three-day trip (started July 20, 2009The Vice President in Kyiv, Whitehouse.gov (July 20, 2009)) to Ukraine and Georgia Vice President Joe Biden again stated that the United States will not recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states, and urged \\"the world\\" not to recognize them as independent states.Vice President Biden Reaffirms Support for Georgia, Whitehouse.gov (July 23, 2009) On March 24, 2010, the United States and Russia reached an agreement to reduce their stockpiles of nuclear weapons.

The agreement is expected to cut the number of long-range nuclear weapons held by each side to about 1,500, down from the current 1,700 to 2,200 set by the Moscow Treaty of 2002. The new agreement would replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which expired in December 2009.NBC News U.S., Russia on brink of arms agreement Obama's pragmatic policy towards Russia has drawn criticism from his opponents, especially from hawks and neoconservatives, though also from many liberals.

While conservatives try to use it to emphasize his (in their view) lack of patriotism, liberal criticism of Obama's relations with Russia focus on Russia's dismal human rights record.  Switzerland  The Obama administration's foreign policy toward Switzerland was characterized in a March 2009 editorial for The Guardian as \\"increasingly hostile\\". Indeed, shortly after Obama's election in November 2008, the then-president-elect reportedly developed plans with key economic advisers to push for a crackdown on tax havens in early 2009, and as a senator, Obama co-sponsored the Stop Tax Havens Act of 2007, which identified Switzerland as among 34 \\"Offshore Secrecy Jurisdictions\\" warranting strengthened powers of investigation and summons for the IRS, which Obama reportedly wants reintroduced and passed by the 111th United States Congress. On February 19, 2009, the United States government filed a lawsuit against UBS AG, a major Swiss bank, demanding it release the names of almost 52,000 Americans who allegedly used its secret accounts to avoid paying taxes on their income. In the matter of U.S. v. UBS AG (2009), the Switzerland-based bank stands accused by U.S. authorities of \\"conspiring to defraud the U.S. by helping Americans hide accounts from the IRS\\". In response to the U.S. suit, the conservative Swiss People's Party proposed a number of punitive measures for Bern to inflict on the United States, including rejection of Guant√°namo Bay detainees and repatriation of Swiss gold from the U.S. On February 28, 2009, Swiss President Hans-Rudolf Merz suggested that Switzerland might need to \\"make a few concessions\\" on matters of bank secrecy in light of the financial crisis in order to avoid being sanctioned as \\"an uncooperative tax haven\\". United States Attorney General Eric Holder, who as a former attorney for UBS AG has recused himself from the bank's investigation, met with his Swiss counterpart, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, on March 2, 2009. Widmer-Schlumpf earlier met with Acting Deputy Attorney General David Margolis to discuss \\"international finance issues\\", according to the United States Department of Justice. Writing ahead of the meetings, former United States Ambassador to Switzerland Faith Whittlesey cautioned the Obama administration against taking too aggressive an approach with a government she characterized as \\"stable, responsible...[and] reliable\\", warning that a deterioration of relations with Switzerland could lead to deeper economic turmoil. Widmer-Schlumpf later said that Margolis and Holder \\"expressed their willingness to negotiate with Switzerland, to discuss with us, and especially in the UBS case, Mr. Margolis said that he was not interested in having an escalation\\". The Obama administration scored a diplomatic victory when Merz announced that Switzerland would adapt its policy to OECD standards and henceforth cooperate with foreign bodies on matters of international tax evasion. On September 26, 2009, Swiss police authorities arrested the fugitive Roman Polanski, who fled the United States in 1977. Swiss police claimed it was a routine arrest, although some politicians claimed it was motivated by Swiss worries over new US policy on tax evasion in Switzerland may have prompted them to act over-energetically. An extradition request was filed by the US government on October 23.  Turkey  Turkish Parliament on April 6, 2009. Ties with Turkey were strained under the George W. Bush administration, in part due to Turkish military operations into northern Iraq in 2008. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited the country on March 7, 2009, in a bid to renew good relations. President Barack Obama added Turkey to the European leg of his overseas trip and visited Ankara and Istanbul on April 6‚Äì7, 2009, in an attempt to restore the strategic partnership between the United States and Turkey. He began his visit by laying a wreath at the tomb of the founder of modern Turkish state, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, whose \\"vision and courage\\" he praised. He then travelled to the presidential palace in Ankara for talks with President Abdullah G√ºl, before giving an address to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. He said Turkey's accession to the European Union would send an important signal to the Muslim world and firmly anchor the country in Europe. The trip marked Obama's first visit to a Muslim majority country. Obama has asserted that a close relationship with a stable, democratic, Western-oriented Republic of Turkey is an important U.S. national interest. His administration declared that the U.S. will support the promotion of democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression in Turkey and support its efforts to join the European Union, Barack Obama and Joe Biden: A Stronger Partnership With Europe For A Safer America which the president confirmed on his April visit. While Obama has gone on the record in the past as referring to the massacre of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire as genocide, he declined to do so on his visit to Turkey, instead using the Armenian term Meds Yeghern. He reinforced the fact that he still believes the killings amount to genocide when asked at a joint press conference with President Abdullah G√ºl. During his visit, Obama urged the governments of Turkey and Armenia to work together to normalize relations and reopen the border.

Under the George W. Bush administration, the United States enjoyed a \\"special relationship\\" with the United Kingdom, particularly during the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Obama was sworn in as President of the United States in the midst of a global recession, which continues to deeply affect both countries. Questions have arisen, especially in London, over Obama's intentions regarding the future of the \\"special relationship\\" between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Comments made by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on February 21, 2009, attracted scrutiny due to Gibbs' use of the phrase \\"special partnership\\" in favor of the traditional \\"special relationship\\", which some analysts and officials took as an indication that Obama will approach relations with the UK in a more businesslike, less personal way. Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, and the President of the United States, Barack Obama, during the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit. U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown became the first European leader to meet with Obama on March 3, 2009, and he addressed a joint session of Congress the following day. During his visit to the Obama White House, he presented the president a gift of a pen holder carved from the timbers of HMS Gannet, which served anti-slavery missions off the coast of Africa. Obama's gift to the prime minister was a box of 25 DVDs with movies including Star Wars and E.T. On March 1, 2009, Brown addressed the topic of joint Anglo-American leadership to combat the recession in a column for The Sunday Times. In the column, he said that he and Obama would discuss \\"a global new deal\\" that would encourage unified action by various national governments to fight off the effects of the economic crisis, including international cooperation to institute standard regulation and reform of problematic industries, such as financial corporations. The Obamas met personally with Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom on April 1, 2009.

The Queen gave a state dinner for President Obama, at which toasts recognizing each other's leadership were given (Obama paused during his toast of the Queen, and the British national anthem, \\"God Save the Queen\\" was begun, but he continued speaking during the music until he had finished his statement; the toast was done after it ended).

At the court of P√©ter P√°zm√°ny, he was an enthusiastic student of Hungarian language and literature, although he prioritized military training. From 1635 to 1637, he accompanied Szenkviczy, one of the canons of Esztergom, on a long educative tour through the Italian Peninsula. Contemporary drawing showing Mikl√≥s Zr√≠nyi in battle against Ottomans. Over the next few years, he learned the art of war in defending the Croatian frontier against the Ottoman Empire, and proved himself one of the most important commanders of the age. In 1645, during the closing stages of the Thirty Years' War, he acted against the Swedish troops in Moravia, equipping an army corps at his own expense. At Szkalec he scattered a Swedish division and took 2,000 prisoners. At Eger he saved the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand III, who had been surprised at night in his camp by the offensive of Carl Gustaf Wrangel. Although not enthusiastic for having to fight against Hungarians of Transylvania, subsequently he routed the army of George I R√°k√≥czi, prince of Transylvania, on the Upper Tisza. For his services, the emperor appointed him captain of Croatia. On his return from the war he married the wealthy Eusebia Dra≈°koviƒá. In 1646 he distinguished himself in the actions against Ottomans. At the coronation of Ferdinand IV of Austria, King of the Germans, King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia, he carried the sword of state, and was made ban and captain-general of Croatia. In this double capacity he presided over many Croatian diets. During 1652‚Äì1653, Zr√≠nyi was continually fighting against the Ottomans ‚Äì nevertheless, from his castle at Cs√°ktornya (ƒåakovec) he was in constant communication with the intellectual figures of his time; the Dutch scholar, Jacobus Tollius, even visited him, and has left in his Epistolae itinerariae a lively account of his experiences. Tollius was amazed at the linguistic resources of Zr√≠nyi, who spoke Croatian, Hungarian, Italian, German, Ottoman Turkish and Latin with equal ease. Zr√≠nyi's Latin letters (from which it was gathered that he was married a second time, to Sophia L√∂bl) are, according to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition of 1911, \\"fluent and agreeable, but largely interspersed with Croatian and Magyar expressions\\". In a Latin letter from 1658 to friend Ivan Ruƒçiƒá expressed his consciousness of being an ethnic Croat and Zrinski (\\"Ego mihi conscius aliter sum, etenim non degenerem me Croatam et quidem Zrinium esse scio\\"). In 1655, he made an attempt to be elected Palatine of Hungary (n√°dor); in spite of support by the petty nobility, his efforts failed. The king, reacting to Zr√≠nyi's good connections to Protestants and the Hungarians of Transylvania, nominated Ferenc Wessel√©nyi instead.Zr√≠nyi Mikl√≥s, gr√≥f, Magyar √©letrajzi lexikon Activities in 1664 The last year of his life was also a culmination of his efforts and prestige. In 1663, the Turkish army, led by Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Ahmed, launched an overwhelming offensive against Royal Hungary, ultimately aiming at the siege and occupation of Vienna. The imperial army failed to put up any notable resistance; the Turkish army was eventually stopped by adverse weather conditions. As a preparation for the new Turkish onslaught due next year, German troops were recruited from the Holy Roman Empire and aid was called from France, and Zr√≠nyi, under the overall command of the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli, leader of the Imperial army, was named commander-in-chief of the Hungarian army. Engraving of Zr√≠nyi As a preparation for campaigns planned for 1664, Zr√≠nyi set out to destroy the strongly fortified Suleiman Bridge (the Osijek (Hungarian: Esz√©k) bridge) which, since 1566, had linked Darda to Osijek (across the Drava and the marshes of Baranya). Destruction of the bridge would cut off the retreat of the Ottoman Army and make any Turkish reinforcement impossible for several months. Re-capturing strong fortresses (Berzence, Bab√≥csa, the town of P√©cs, etc.) on his way, Zr√≠nyi advanced 240 kilometers on enemy territory and destroyed the bridge on 1 February 1664. However, the further pursuance of the campaign was frustrated by the refusal of the Imperial generals to co-operate. The court remained suspicious of Zr√≠nyi all the way, regarding him as a promoter of Hungarian secessionist ideas and accusing him of having disturbed the peace by building his castle, Novi Zrin (Hungarian: √öj-Zr√≠nyiv√°r or Zr√≠nyi-√öjv√°r, English: New Zrin or Zrin-Newcastle), erected in 1661 at his own expense, in the theoretically de-militarised zone between the two empires. Zr√≠nyi's siege of Kanizsa, the most important Turkish fortress in Southern Hungary, failed, as the beginning of the siege was seriously delayed by machinations of the overly jealous Montecuccoli, and later the Emperor's military commanders (apart from Hungarian and Croatian leaders), unwilling to combat the Grand Vizier's army hastily coming to the aid of Kanizsa, retreated.S√°ndor Szil√°gyi: A magyar nemzet t√∂rt√©nete Despite the failed siege, the expedition made his name famous and praised throughout Europe. According to the 1911 Britannica, \\"it was said that only the Zr√≠nyis had the secret of conquering the Turks\\". Emperor Leopold offered him the title of prince, while Pope Alexander VII struck a commemorative medal with the effigy of Zr√≠nyi as a field marshal, the Spanish King Philip IV sent him the Order of the Golden Fleece, and France's King Louis XIV created him a Peer. Contemporary drawing showing the death of Zr√≠nyi on 18 November 1664. After relieving Kanizsa, the Grand Vizier turned against Novi Zrin. The Imperial troops under Raimondo Montecuccoli remained inactive while Zr√≠nyi hastened to relieve the castle, refusing all assistance, with the result that the fortress fell. The Viennese court concentrated all its troops on the Hungarian-Austrian border, sacrificing Novi Zrin to hold back the Turkish army. The Turkish army, ultimately, was stopped in the Battle of Saint Gotthard (1664). The Turkish defeat could have offered an opportunity for Hungary to be liberated from the Turkish yoke. However, the Habsburg court chose not to push its advantage in order to save its strength for the brewing conflict that would come to be known as the War of the Spanish Succession. The infamous Peace of Vasv√°r was negotiated by Zr√≠nyi's adversary, Montecuccoli. The peace treaty laid down unfavourable terms, not only giving up recent conquests, but also offering a tribute to the Sublime Porte (which would never be paid) against a few presents from the Ottomans - all despite the fact that Austrian-Hungarian troops maintained the upper hand.The enemy at the gate, Wheatcroft Zr√≠nyi rushed to Vienna to protest against the treaty, but his view was ignored; he left the city in disgust, after assuring the Venetian minister, Sagridino, that he was willing at any moment to assist the Republic against the Ottoman Empire with 6,000 men. Zr√≠nyi then returned to Cs√°ktornya (ƒåakovec). It is widely accepted that he, despite being a loyal supporter of the court before, participated in launching the conspiracy which later became known as the Wessel√©nyi conspiracy, aimed at the restoration of the independent Kingdom of Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary.M√∫lt-kor t√∂rt√©nelmi port√°l However, on November 18, he was killed in a hunting accident in a place called Kursanecz (today Kur≈°anec, Croatia), by a wounded wild boar. To this day, rumors persist that he was killed at the order of the Habsburg Court. No conclusive evidence has ever been found to support this claim; however, it remains true that the Habsburgs lost their mightiest adversary with his death. The village where he died was renamed Zr√≠nyifalva in Hungarian to commemorate him. Works A bust of Zr√≠nyi outside the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z in Budapest Beside being a leading military figure of 17th-century Croatia and Hungary, Zr√≠nyi is well known for his literary works, also reflected in his often-recited epithet Zr√≠nyi Mikl√≥s, a k√∂lt≈ë hadvez√©r √©s politikus (Hungarian for Mikl√≥s Zr√≠nyi, the poet the general and the politician). He is the author of the first epic poem in Hungarian literature. A statue of Mikl√≥s Zr√≠nyi at the Hadtorteneti Muzeum (War History Museum) in Budapest Zr√≠nyi's most significant literary work, The Peril of Sziget (Szigeti veszedelem or Zr√≠nyi√°sz), an epic poem written in the G√∂csej dialect of Hungarian, was written in the winter of 1648-1649, and was published, together with a few miscellaneous pieces of poetry, under the title of The Siren of the Adriatic Sea (Adriai tengernek Syren√°ja) in Vienna in 1651. The epic was composed in the manner of the classic epic poets, such as Virgil and their 16th century successor Torquato Tasso. The subject is the heroic but unsuccessful defence of Szigetv√°r by the author's great- grandfather, Nikola IV Zrinski (). Many criticized the indiscriminate use of foreign words and seemingly careless metres of the work; however, it was also much praised for its poetic strength, which made Zr√≠nyi the most notable Hungarian poet of the 17th century. The work also earned him praise due to its fundamental idea (the strength of Hungarian/Croatian valour to overthrow Ottoman rule, with the help of God), and to its enthusiastic tone. The Peril of Sziget has drawn comparisons with the other Baroque epics of the period and despite its obsolete language being difficult to interpret to the average reader remains, to this day, one of the few pre-19th century Hungarian literary works still widely known to the public. The epic was translated to Croatian by Mikl√≥s's brother, Petar Zrinski () who, while Mikl√≥s was a master of Hungarian, excelled in the Croatian language. Beside his poetic works, Zr√≠nyi is also a forerunner of Croatian and Hungarian political thinking and military science. In his essays and manifestos, such as Ne b√°ntsd a magyart ‚Äì Az t√∂r√∂k √°fium ellen val√≥ orvoss√°g (Do not hurt the Hungarians - An antidote to the Turkish poison) or M√°ty√°s kir√°ly √©let√©r≈ël val√≥ elm√©lked√©sek (Reflections on the life of King Matthias) he makes a case for a standing army, moral renewal of the nation, the re-establishment of the national kingdom, the unification of Royal Hungary with Transylvania, and, of course, the ousting of the Turkish occupants.Istv√°n S≈ët√©r ed., A magyar irodalom t√∂rt√©nete 1600-t√≥l 1772-ig - Pr√≥zai m≈±vei Honors Postage stamps issued: Mikl√≥s Zr√≠nyi Stamps were issued by Hungary on 1 January 1943, 1 May 1945, 18 June 1966, 18 August 2000 in Hungarian History series, and 5 September 2008.

Definition of epoxy waterproofing  Waterproof (or water-resistant) describes objects unaffected by water or resisting water passage, or which are covered with a material that resists or does not allow water passage. In horology, the waterproofness of a watch is defined by its resistance under pressure. The manufacturers indicate mostly the degree of waterproofness in metres (m), feet (ft) or atmospheres (atm). Watches with the \\"waterproof\\" name, with or without indication of overpressure, have to be complied and have to undergo successfully the tests planned in the standard ISO-2281. These watches are intended for a current daily use and have to resist to the water during exercises such as the short- term swimming. So finally watches said waterresistant must : resist to a dive in the water in a depth of at least 100 metres (330 ft), have a system of control of time and answer all the criteria planned by the standard ISO 6425: luminosity, shock resistance, resistance in magnetic fields, solidity of the bracelet.

It is a contemporary version of the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast. The movie was filmed entirely in Israel, and the taglines were: \\"The monster they feared was the prince she loved\\" and \\"The classic fairy tale about seeing with your heart\\". Plot A wealthy merchant lives an affluent life with his two sons, Oliver and Frederick, and three daughters, Bettina, Isabella and Beauty. Beauty, the youngest daughter, is the caretaker of her family; without her, none of the family can look after themselves, and she is constantly taking care of her siblings. Despite this, Beauty is not frustrated, but she wonders what she would do with her life if she did not devote it to her family. After the merchant loses his wealth in a storm at sea, the family must renounce their luxurious life and move to the countryside, with Beauty once again taking charge. After a time, the family hear that their wealth may be returned, for a ship has made it to port. To celebrate, the father promises his children gifts of luxury, but Beauty merely wants a rose. The merchant realises it was a lost cause, for he is still as poor as he was when he left, and returns. He stops off at a beautiful castle where an unseen host treats him to good food and a warm bed. However, the old man plucks a rose from the garden, and the host demands that as punishment, Beauty must come to live with him. Beauty moves to the castle, and is alone for the first time in her life. Therefore, she realises what she wants to do with her life, and realises that the Beast (the formerly unseen host) is not a complete monster. When Beauty's father takes her to the castle, the Beast gives him two chests of gold and horses to carry it, as compensation for giving up his daughter. It seems that while in the castle anything she wants magically appears. The Beast has magical powers and grants all her wishes. The only time they see each other is at diner. He holds a rose and each night asks, \\"Do you love me? Will you marry me?\\". She always replies \\"No.\\" Every night she dreams of a prince whom she loves (despite it being only a dream). She is shocked when she finds paintings of this dream prince in Beast's castle. Over time she is happy at the castle, but asks the Beast if she can visit her family, for she misses them. He allows her and says \\"Be back in one month, or I will die.\\" Also time flows differently. In the castle it has been about a week, but to the outside world it has been a year. While with her family they learn how to care for themselves instead of Beauty having to take care of them. She thinks about Beast and has to return, against her family's urging her to stay. Upon returning to the castle she finds Beast dying for her lateness. She cries and mourns, begging Beast not to die. That's when she realizes how much she cares for him. So he asks again \\"Will you marry me\\" she finally says \\"Yes.\\" That breaks the curse and Beast heals. He also turns into the prince she been dreaming about. He tells her about the curse. All his former subjects reappear along with her family who can now visit her whenever they want. She and the prince wed, and she becomes a princess.

The Neptune of the painting is a symbolic personification of Philip's admiralty Philip of Burgundy (1464 in Brussels - 7 April 1524 in Wijk bij Duurstede) was Admiral of the Netherlands from 1498 to 1517 and bishop of Utrecht from 1517 to 1524. Philip was an illegitimate son of Duke Philip the Good. 1486 he was knighted and in 1491 he single-handedly killed an opponent. He was at the head of the Burgundian army in the Sticht and, as such, refused to bury his half- brother David of Burgundy, bishop of Utrecht, as long as the election of a Burgundian-favoured successor had not been arranged. He was appointed admiral in 1498 by Duke Philip the Fair and after an expedition to Rome in 1508 he settled in the castle Souburg on Walcheren. In a politically motivated move, Philip was appointed bishop of Utrecht by Duke Charles (later Emperor Charles V) to replace Frederick IV of Baden. When he made his entrance into Utrecht he had not received any kind of ordination; these were given to him in the following days. He led a luxurious life in the episcopal residence, Duurstede Castle, taking a particular interested in weaponry, women and horses. He was a true renaissance-ruler, and was little concerned with religious matters, which he delegated to his servants. He ignored the rising Lutheranism. Philip's politics were not very successful; he left much to his councillors and had trouble keeping himself standing in the midst of the faction-struggles in the bishopric. During his rule the Oversticht was largely lost in the Guelders War between the Empire and Guelders. The bishopric maintained only Hasselt, Steenwijk and Oldenzaal. Philips only positive contribution was his patronage of the arts. For years he maintained the painter Jan Gossaert and the humanist Gelderhouwer, and he acted as a protector of Erasmus. He also was the sculptor Conrad Meit's first employer in the Low Countries. He also owned works by Hieronymous Bosch.

It programs and tours public performances in theaters and art centers nationally, trains and mentors storytellers, undertakes research and advises on the use of oral storytelling in museums and educational settings. Programming Crick Crack Club events have taken place at The British Museum, The British Library, Soho Theatre, The Barbican, Northern Stage, the Unicorn Theatre, Cheltenham Literature Festival, The Cube Microplex (Bristol), York Theatre Royal, Rich Mix Cultural Foundation and Aberystwyth Arts Centre. The Crick Crack Club works with a core of around a dozen UK-based established performance storytellers (plus additional international artists from Northern Europe, the US and the wider world) and between five and ten emerging artists. The repertoire of each storyteller is different, and artists continually produce new work, alongside continuing to perform shows that are in their permanent repertoire. The Crick Crack Club is primarily interested in the performance and oral retelling of traditional narrative material ‚Äì fairy tales, folklore mythology, legends and epics ‚Äì and the content of the vast majority of performances it promotes is based on traditional stories to a greater or lesser extent. The Crick Crack Club is the operating name of The Centre for International Storytelling which is a registered Charity. It receives funding from grant-giving organisations such as Arts Council England and The Paul Hamlyn Foundation.Paul Hamlyn Foundation Yearbook 2008/2009Arts Council Annual Review 2009 History The Crick Crack Club was the first performance storytelling club to be established in the UK.The New Storytelling, by Simon Heywood, Published by Papyrus From 1988‚Äì1995 26 weekly events took place every autumn and winter. Artists received fees to entertain an audience who had paid an entry fee. Unlike folk clubs there were no 'floorspots'; from the outset the Crick Crack Club only promoted professional artists and did not encourage amateur participation. It was founded in 1987 by performance storyteller Ben Haggarty with assistance during the first year from Jenny Pearson. In January 1985 Ben Haggarty had organised Britain's first storytelling festival at Battersea Arts Centre. A second festival at Watermans Art Centre in 1987 prompted an invitation for him to stage a third, 16-day- long, international storytelling festival at London's South Bank Centre in 1989. A list of international artists was drawn up, including Louise Bennett, Vi Hilbert, Abbi Patrix, Eamon Kelly, Seref Tasliova and Punaram Nishad. However, questions arose as to whether there would actually be enough performance storytellers in the UK with the experience and stage presence to hold large adult audiences for a whole evening with appropriate material. This concern led Ben Haggarty to found the Crick Crack Club. Many of today's leading British storytellers' first performances for adult audiences were at the Crick Crack Club. In the autumn of 1988 the first season of 26 weekly events was launched in a pub theatre in Ladbroke Grove, with the expressed aim of trying out new artists and providing an opportunity for established artists (who mainly worked in educational contexts) to develop their skills and repertoire for adult audiences. Between 1988 and 1995, The Crick Crack Club promoted weekly events in several venues in London. From 1995 to 2001, the club organised monthly events at The Spitz, in Spitalfields, including its renowned 'Grand Lying Contest'.review by Judith Palmer, The Independent 06.04.1999 The winner of the \\"Hodja Cup\\" in 2010 was Hugh Lupton. During this time it also organised numerous monthly events and mini-festivals in regional arts venues throughout England and elsewhere in London, including at Battersea Arts Centre, The South Bank Centre and Hoxton Hall. In addition, the Norfolk storyteller, Hugh Lupton, ran a successful monthly branch of the club during this time at the King of Hearts Arts Centre in Norwich. From 1991‚Äì1993 Ben Haggarty was assisted by storyteller Daniel Morden, and in one year they put on 125 events across England and Wales. In 1993, in partnership with David Ambrose of St. Donats Arts Centre in Wales, the Crick Crack Club created what was to become one of the most celebrated and festive annual storytelling festivals: the Beyond the Border International Festival of Storytelling and Epic Singing. Ben Haggarty, the Crick Crack Club's Artistic Director co- directed Beyond the Border from 1993 to 2005 with specific responsibility for choosing the storytellers, while David Ambrose selected the musicians, puppeteers and other theatrical entertainers. The Crick Crack Club entered into a partnership with Barbican Education at Barbican Arts Centre in 2003, and programmed nine events a year in the Barbican Pit Theatre for the next 9 years. In 2009 the Crick Crack Club began running monthly events at the Soho Theatre and in 2010 it began running regular events at Rich Mix. Between 2010 and 2012 The Crick Crack Club developed a circuit of regional venues. Origins of the name In the francophone islands of the Caribbean, when a storyteller wants to tell a story, he or she calls 'Cric?‚Äô and those who want to hear respond with the affirmation 'Crac!‚Äô. Given the Northern British usage of Crack (Irish: Craic) to denote a story, Ben Haggarty coined the name Crick Crack Club in 1988. (Variations of the name have been subsequently used by independent groups in Edinburgh 'The Guid Craic Club', in Newcastle, 'A Bit Crack' and in Stockholm ‚Äò The Crick Crack Caf√©'). Audio archive The Crick Crack Club logo The Crick Crack Club holds the Heritage Lottery Fund funded LCIS audio archive of performance storytelling, which totals over 900 individual recordings, each with its own annotated record. It features over 220 voices, and spans a period from 1983 to 2007. As a study of a reviving art form based on the oral tradition, the material ranges from the raw and experimental, to the polished and formally presented. The archive includes recordings from the experimental club-nights run by The West London Storytelling Unit in London in the early 1980s; material collected by The Company of Storytellers dating from their first tour in 1985 and onwards; recordings collected at the first three UK International Storytelling Festivals in London in 1985, 87 and 89; from Beyond the Border Festival over the years and some more recent recordings from Festival at the Edge, the Barbican Arts Centre and the Unicorn Theatre. It features over 220 voices, including that of Hugh Lupton, TUUP, Sally Pomme Clayton, Ben Haggarty, Abbi Patrix and Laura Simms, as well as superb examples of some of the world's greatest surviving epic singing traditions such as Central Indian Pandavani, Rajasthani Pabuji Ki Phad, Kyrgyz Manas singing (singers of the epic of Manas), the work of Turkish Ashiks and Bangladeshi Palagan and Patuagan performers.

It took place in the townland of Clonbanin (a.k.a. Cloonbannin), County Cork. The IRA force comprised almost 100 volunteers from counties Cork and Kerry, armed with rifles, hand grenades and a machine gun. Their target was a British Army convoy of three lorries, an armoured car and a touring car carrying Brigadier General Hanway Robert Cumming. The convoy was travelling from Killarney to Buttevant and comprised almost 40 soldiers of the East Lancashire Regiment. When the convoy entered the ambush position, IRA volunteers opened fire from elevated positions on both sides of the road. The three lorries and touring car were disabled, and the armoured car became stuck in the roadside ditch (although those inside fired from its machine guns). As Cumming jumped from his car, he was shot in the head and died instantly. The battle lasted slightly over an hour. As the IRA forces withdrew from one side of the road, a British officer and six soldiers attempted to flank the IRA on the other side. After a brief exchange of fire they retreated. The IRA are not believed to have sustained any casualties.

In April 2009, Obama gave a speech in Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments. On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for \\"A New Beginning\\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace. Gaza On February 2, 2009, President Obama signed a memorandum \\"directing more than $20 million for 'urgent refugee and migration needs\\" in Gaza.\\" The 2008‚Äì2009 Israeli-Gaza Conflict last from December 27, 2008 to January 18, 2009 when unilateral cease-fires were issued by both the Israeli government and Hamas. This cease-fire was shortly lived and sporadic fighting and attacks would continue to occur into the Obama administration. Israel completed its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip on January 21, 2009, one day after Obama was sworn in as President. $900 million was pledged from Hillary Clinton to help the rebuilding process in Gaza. This was criticized by Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers' Alliance and Barbara Crook of the pro-Israel Palestinian Media Watch, who claim that the money will be used to promote terrorism and teach Palestinians to hate non-Muslims and oppose the existence of Israel. On June 4, 2009, in a speech addressing Muslims in Cairo, Egypt, President Obama said, \\"Palestinians must abandon violence. Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and does not succeed.\\" He cited the civil rights movement, the Indonesian Revolution of 1998, and the negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa as historical examples of successful nonviolent uprisings to end social, racial, and political injustice and added, apparently in reference to several infamous terrorist attacks by Palestinian organizations, \\"It is a sign of neither courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus. That is not how moral authority is claimed; that is how it is surrendered.\\" Reacting to the speech, Hamas senior adviser Ahmed Yousef expressed wary approval, telling the pan- Arab news network Al Jazeera, \\"The things he said about Islam and the Palestinian suffering and their right to have a state is great. It is a landmark and a breakthrough speech. But when it comes to legitimacy of the Israeli right to exist [there are issues]. He knows the Palestinians have to have their own state before recognizing another.\\" \\"[A]ll we can say is that there is a difference in the statements [from those of former U.S. President George W. Bush], and the statements of today did not include a mechanism that can translate his wishes and views into actions,\\" said Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum. Saudi Arabia The United States and Saudi Arabia continued their post-war alliance during the Obama presidency, and the Obama Administration supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen during the Yemeni Civil War. However, tensions between the Saudis and the United States arose following the Iranian nuclear deal, as Saudi Arabia and Iran have strained relations and have competed for influence in the Middle East. The Obama administration attempted to defuse tensions between the two countries, as it hoped for cooperation with both countries in regards to the Syrian Civil War and military operations against ISIS. Obama also criticized the human rights record of Saudi Arabia, particularly in regards to the imprisonment of Raif Badawi. When once asked whether Saudi Arabia was America's friend, Obama replied with \\"It's complicated.\\" According to The Economist, opining in April 2016, thanks in large part to Obama, America's relationship with Saudi Arabia had become \\"deeply strained\\" under his tenure. Despite fierce opposition on the part of the Saudi government,Mark Mazzetti, Saudi Arabia Warns of Economic Fallout if Congress Passes 9/11 Bill, New York Times (April 15, 2016). the U.S. Congress passed and then overrode Obama's veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. On October 20, 2010, U.S. State Department notified Congress of its intention to make the biggest arms sale in American history, which was an estimated $60.5 billion purchase by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The package represents a considerable improvement in the offensive capability of the Saudi armed forces.Arms for the King and His Family Iran The 2009 Iranian presidential election was held on June 12, 2009. Candidates included Ahmadinejad, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the former Prime Minister of Iran, and Mehdi Karroubi, a former Speaker of the Iranian Parliament. There are reports that the upcoming election had influenced deliberations about the \\"timing for potential Iran Talks.\\" Following the 2009 Iranian election protests Obama said: \\"'In 2009 no iron fist is strong enough to shut off the world from bearing witness to the peaceful pursuit of justice. Despite the Iranian government's efforts to expel journalists and isolate itself, powerful images and poignant words have made their way to us through cell phones and computers, and so we have watched what the Iranian people are doing.\\" He also noted that \\"'This is not about the United States and the West. This is about the people of Iran, and the future that they ‚Äì and only they ‚Äì will choose'\\" After the disputed June 2009 Iranian presidential election, Obama condemned the Iranian government's crackdown on the Iranian Green Movement opposition, a group of pro-democracy demonstrators.Hooman Majd, Think Again: Iran‚Äôs Green Movement: It's a civil rights movement, not a revolution, Foreign Policy (January 6, 2017). Obama stated: \\"we respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran, but \\"I am deeply troubled by the violence that I've been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process ‚Äì free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent ‚Äì all those are universal values and need to be respected.\\"Josh Levs, Fact Check: Was Obama 'silent' on Iran 2009 protests?, CNN (October 9, 2012). After more violent was directed at protesters, Obama stated: \\"The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, beatings and imprisonments of the last few days\\" and issued a strong condemnation of \\"these unjust actions.\\" Some critics, including his 2012 presidential campaign rival Mitt Romney, faulted Obama, saying that he should have done more to support the Green Movement. Others disagreed, noting that the Green Movement did not need or want direct foreign support, and arguing that direct U.S. backing for the Iranian opposition would likely \\"undermine its credibility, and perhaps even lend credence to the government‚Äôs assertion that the movement is a foreign-inspired plot that will rob Iran of its independence.\\" Obama signed the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 on July 1, 2010 to expand sanctions on Iran. The restrictions of the new law are so tight that third countries have warned about the interference with their trade.\\"U.S. Iran Sanctions Threaten Ties With Russia ‚Äì Official.\\", RIA Novosti, 13 August 2012. However under Obama, Iran's oil exports have been halved.\\"Iran sanctions bill on oil passed by US House.\\" Rouhani's visit to New York City in September 2013 was hailed as major progress in Iran's relations with United States. He previously said that his government is ready to hold talks with the United States after thirty two years. However, after Obama requested a one-by-one meeting, Rouhani rejected that. Rouhani denied reports he had refused a meeting with Obama, and felt more time was needed to coordinate such a meeting. On 27 September 2013, a day after the two countries foreign ministers met during the P5+1 and Iran talks, Rouhani had a phone call with President Obama that marked two countries' highest political exchange since 1979.Obama speaks with Iranian President Rouhani NBC News 27 September 2013Obama talks to Rouhani: First direct conversation between American and Iranian presidents in 30 years National Post 27 September 2013  Iran nuclear talks  On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program increasing nuclear weapons production. The ‚ÄúComplex Modernization‚Äù initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. The administration built new plutonium pits at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico and expanded enriched uranium processing at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennesseehttps://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/1/headlines. In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the \\"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\\" saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \\"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\\" In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency. On a sidenote, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White HouseThompson, Loren (December 15, 2015) Obama Backs Biggest Nuclear Arms Buildup Since Cold War Forbes. Iraq In February 2009, President Obama named Christopher R. Hill as the incoming U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, replacing the previous Bush-appointee Ryan Crocker, who had been in the post nearly two years. During the first few months Obama was Commander in Chief of the United States Military, it charged and convicted U.S. soldier Clifford Cornell of desertion, and sentenced him to one year in prison for refusing to participate in the Iraq War. The charge occurred February 23, 2009, (in Obama's second month), and the conviction occurred April 24, 2009. U.S. President Barack Obama delivering a speech at Camp Lejeune on 27 February 2009 On February 27, 2009, at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, Obama announced a deadline for the withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq. According to the president, by August 31, 2010, after nearly seven and a half years of United States military engagement in Iraq, all but a \\"transitional force\\" of 35,000 to 50,000 troops will be withdrawn from the Middle Eastern nation. Obama defined the task of the transitional force as \\"training, equipping, and advising Iraqi Security Forces as long as they remain non-sectarian; conducting targeted counter-terrorism missions; and protecting our ongoing civilian and military efforts within Iraq\\". Under this plan, the majority of troops will be withdrawn over a year before the deadline in the signed agreement between former President George W. Bush and Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki. On August 31, 2010, Obama announced in his Oval Office address that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over. The last U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq on 18 December, 2011, thus ending the Iraq War. At the invitation of the Iraqi Government, on 15 June 2014 President Obama ordered dozens of United States troops to Iraq in response to offensives by ISIL to assess Iraqi forces and the ISIL threat..Obama sent a total of 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, following the capture of Mosul by ISIS,. In August 2014, President Obama announced that he would be returning American forces to Iraq in response to the rise of extreme Islamist non-state actors such as the Islamic State, and the deteriorating humanitarian conditions there. By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots. In early 2015, with the addition of the \\"Panther Brigade\\" of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400, and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield. Israel Obama meeting with Israeli President alt=President Barack Obama, at left, shakes hands with Israeli President Shimon Peres, at right, in the Oval Office on Tuesday, May 5, 2009. Standing at right looking on is U.S. Vice President Joe Biden. Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu in 2009 Obama meets with leaders of major American Jewish Organizations, including Malcolm Hoenlein, March 1, 2011 US President Barack Obama meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly after arriving on a visit to Israel in March 2013 Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, March 2013. Before and after the election of Barack Obama as President of the United States, some Jews, including United States Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, questioned Obama's commitment to Israeli security. Obama maintained that he supports Israel and said he would continue the U.S. alliance with Israel as president. The Democratic candidate ultimately carried the state of Florida, with its large Jewish population, in the general election, signaling that his efforts to assuage the concerns of Israeli partisans had been at least moderately successful. In January 2009, then-President-elect Obama expressed \\"concern\\" over heavy fighting between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, but said he would leave it to the outgoing Bush administration to express the official U.S. position on the conflict. Obama was criticized by voices on both the left and the right for his reluctance to speak out about the Gazan conflict. President Obama sent Special Envoy for Middle East peace George Mitchell on an 8-day tour of the Middle East starting on January 26, 2009 in which Mitchell met with the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Israeli army chief of staff Lt. General Gabi Ashkenaz to discuss the peace process along with other with stops in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, France and Britain where he met with various leaders. Special envoy George Mitchell, after holding talks in Ramallah with Palestinian President Abbas, leader of the Fatah which is at odds with Hamas, stated \\"To be successful in preventing the illicit traffic of arms into Gaza there must be a mechanism to allow the flow of legal goods, and that should be with the participation of the Palestinian Authority.\\" Obama had also stated that \\"lasting peace requires more than a long cease-fire, and that's why I will sustain an active commitment to seek two states living side by side in peace and security.\\" In March 2009, Obama appointee and ally Hillary Clinton traveled as Secretary of State to Israel. She warned that Israeli settlements and demolition of Arab homes in East Jerusalem were \\"unhelpful\\" to the peace process. Clinton also voiced support for the establishment of a Palestinian state‚Äîa solution supported by Israeli Foreign Minister and opposition leader-to-be Tzipi Livni, but not endorsed by Prime Minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom she had earlier pledged the United States' cooperation. The Obama administration has repeatedly pressured the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to freeze the growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. \\"The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements,\\" the American president said in Cairo in a June 4, 2009, speech to Muslims. \\"This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop.\\" In the same speech, Obama sharply rebuked Holocaust denial, anti-Semitism, and anti-Zionism, saying of the Holocaust, \\"Six million Jews were killed ‚Äì more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today. Denying that fact is baseless, ignorant, and hateful.\\" Obama added, \\"Threatening Israel with destruction ‚Äì or repeating vile stereotypes about Jews ‚Äì is deeply wrong, and only serves to evoke in the minds of Israelis this most painful of memories while preventing the peace that the people of this region deserve.\\" In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so. Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps. In June 2011, Obama said the bond between the United States and Israel is \\"unbreakable.\\" During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries. The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \\"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\\" In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, \\"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\\" Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \\"dangerous\\" and \\"bad.\\" In a 2013 video released by the White House a map of Israel was displayed that did not have territories that are contested, such as the Golan Heights and Jerusalem, as being Israeli territory. In 2015, the Obama administration expressed frustration over Israel's secret service spying on Iranian nuclear negotiations and leaking the details to Congress. On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass. Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama Administration's actions, and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017. On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342‚Äì80 to condemn the UN Resolution. Libya After initial skepticism of international involvement to prevent Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi from using violence to suppress popular demonstrations in his country, the Obama administration crucially backed United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 to create a Libyan no-fly zone, with United States Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice successfully pushing to include language allowing the UN mandate free rein to launch air attacks on Libyan ground targets threatening civilians. In March 2011, international reaction to Gaddafi's military crackdown culminated in a United Nations resolution to enforce a no fly zone in Libya. Obama authorized U.S. forces to participate in international air attacks on Libyan air defenses using Tomahawk cruise missiles to establish the protective zone.On March 18, 2011, Obama addressed the nation from the White House announcing U.S. military strikes with NATO forces against the Gaddafi regime With coalition support, the rebels took Tripoli the following August. The Libyan campaign culminated in the toppling of the Gaddafi regime, but Libya experienced turmoil in the aftermath of the civil war. Obama's intervention in Libya provoked criticism from members of Congress and ignited a debate over the applicability of the War Powers Resolution. The intervention was led by NATO, but Sweden and three Arab nations also participated in the mission. Obama authorized the firing of 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles against targets in Libya, in response to regime actions against rebel forces, to enforce the UN no-fly zone.Gaddafi 'not targeted' by allied strikes. BBC News, March 21, 2011. Controversy arose over whether Obama's use of military force without prior congressional approval was constitutional, with comments by Yale law professor Jack M. BalkinBalkin, Jack. Bradley Manning, Barack Obama and the National Surveillance State. Personal blog of Yale law professor Jack Balkin, March 17, 2011. and Salon.com columnist Glenn Greenwald.Greenwald, Glenn. Obama on presidential war-making powers . Salon.com, March 18, 2011. On March 28, 2011, Obama addressed the American people on the rational of U.S. military intervention with NATO forces in Libya at the National Defense University. In September 2012, Islamic militants attacked the American consulate in Benghazi, killing Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Republicans strongly criticized the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack, and established a select committee in the House to investigate the attack. In November 2015, United States forces during the Obama administration returned to Libya and launched a military campaign against ISIL targets in Libya. Obama, in 2016, cited the failure to prepare for an effective interim government after Gaddafi's downfall as the \\"worst mistake\\" of his presidency. President Obama: Libya aftermath 'worst mistake' of presidency. BBC News. April 11, 2016. Syria  Re-engagement  The Obama administration initiated a policy of rapprochement with Syria. However, with the governments' violent response to the Syrian civil war in 2011, relations cooled dramatically and senior American officials, including President Obama himself, repeatedly called for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to resign. Although the U.S. recalled its ambassador to Syria in 2005, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the Obama administration was reconsidering its relations with the country, which the George W. Bush administration repeatedly accused of sponsoring terrorism during its eight-year tenure. On March 3, 2009, Clinton said the U.S. would \\"soon\\" dispatch two envoys to Syria to probe the situation. On February 16, 2010, President Obama nominated career diplomat and former United States Ambassador to Algeria Robert Ford to be the first United States Ambassador to Syria since 2005. Shortly after Ford's appointment, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns arrived in Damascus and hosted talks with President Bashar al-Assad in an attempt to revive relations. The talks were described as \\"candid\\" and that common ground was met on those issues pertaining to Iraq and Lebanon. In July 2010, Senator Arlen Specter met with al-Assad in attempts to further continue the new dialogue. In meetings revolved around discussing \\"specific steps to promote regional stability, revive Syria‚ÄìIsrael peace talks, and strengthen U.S.‚ÄìSyrian bilateral relations.\\"  Lifting of travel restrictions  In February 2010 the US travel advisory for American citizens traveling to Syria was lifted. The advisory had been in place since the 2006 embassy bombing attempt. The US Embassy in Syria reported that, \\"After carefully assessing the current situation in Syria, we determined that circumstances didn't merit extending the travel warning.‚Äù This move was seen by many as one of the first steps towards better bilateral relations.  Sanctions  In May 2010, President Obama renewed a set of sanctions against Syria placed by the previous Bush administration. On August 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 signed by President Obama froze all assets of the Government of Syria, prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in any transaction involving the Government of Syria, banned U.S. imports of Syrian-origin petroleum or petroleum products, prohibited U.S. persons from having any dealings in or related to Syria‚Äôs petroleum or petroleum products, and prohibited U.S. persons from operating or investing in Syria.Executive Order 13582, U.S. Treasury Department This is considered the start of the comprehensive U.S. embargo on Syria.  Syrian Civil War  On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: \\"The time has come for President Assad to step aside.\\" This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015. In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti- Assad rebels. The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015. In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \\"red line\\" he had pledged and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued. In 2012, Obama, who had previously demanded the resignation of Syria's president Bashar al-Assad, said that the use of chemical weapons by the Assad government would be crossing a red line and would entail U.S. military action. After reports on 21 August 2013 about the usage of chemical weapons in Syria, the Obama administration formally blamed the incident on the Syrian government and sought Congressional approval for military action in Syria. Besides, Obama sought support from Britain and France for an attack in Syria. The Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel approved plans for a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missile strikes to have those called off by Obama in September. On 11 September 2013, Obama put a military strike or combat operations on hold and achieved an agreement with Russia and the Syrian government to destroy all chemical weapons in Syria. Obama's decision to allow the violation of a red line he himself had drawn to go unpunished is widely criticised by the U.S. political establishment, as well as the allies, as detrimental to America's international credibility. However, in early 2016, Obama said he was \\"proud\\" of his decision, which repudiated what he referred to as the \\"Washington playbook\\" and avoided entangling the US in yet another \\"unfixable\\" situation in the Middle East. More broadly, regarding Obama's lack of meaningful support to the Syrian anti-government rebels, in 2015, The Economist opined, \\"Rarely has an American president so abjectly abandoned his global responsibility\\", adding in 2016, \\"The agony of Syria is the biggest moral stain on Barack Obama's presidency. And the chaos rippling from Syria‚Äîwhere many now turn to al-Qaeda, not the West, for salvation‚Äîis his greatest geopolitical failure.\\" In 2016, Nicholas Kristof described inaction in Syria as \\"Obama's worst mistake\\", while Jonathan Schanzer said \\"the White House Syria policy has been an unmitigated dumpster fire.\\" Michael Mullen, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, described the conflict in Syria as \\"Obama's Rwanda\\". This is in lieu of the CIA-backed operation Timber Sycamore, which provide weapons and trainings to anti-government rebels, but proved to be ineffective by the end of the Obama presidency. In comments published on 1 December 2016, about the U.S. becoming increasingly sidelined by Moscow and Ankara, Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, blamed the marginalisation of the U.S. in the Syrian Civil War and the region at large on Barack Obama, \\"The American approach to this conflict guaranteed the US less and less relevance, not just in the Syrian conflict but also the broader regional dynamics. There has been a loss of face and a loss of leverage. The politics of the region are being transformed and this happened under Obama, whether by design or by failure.\\" In 2017, as Russia on the back of its successful military campaign in Syria forged closer ties with Turkey and Saudi Arabia, analysts and politicians in the Middle East concurred that Russia's clout in the region had grown ‚Äúbecause Obama allowed it to‚Äô‚Äô by failing to intervene robustly in Syria.Putin Is Filling the Middle East Power Vacuum Bloomberg, 3 October 2017.  The \\"Red Line\\" ultimatum  The Obama \\"Red Line\\" remark was intended as an ultimatum to the Syrian president and the Syrian army to cease the use of chemical weapons. It appeared in a Presidential statement on 20 August 2012. Obama's red line was enforced by means of threat of massive military force in September 2013 and resulted in the substantial destruction of the Syrian stockpile of chemical weapons by June 2014. Obama stated, \\"We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.\\" One year later, in the early hours of 21 August 2013, two opposition-controlled areas in the suburbs around Damascus, Syria were struck by rockets containing the chemical agent sarin. The attack was the deadliest use of chemical weapons since the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The U.S. Navy brought four destroyers into position in the eastern Mediterranean to reach targets inside Syria. The USS Nimitz carrier group was rerouted to Syria in early September 2013. Russia and Great Britain among other nations began evacuating their citizens in anticipation of the bombardment. During the G20 summit on 6 September, Vladimir Putin and Obama discussed the idea of putting Syria's chemical weapons under international control. On 9 September 2013, Kerry stated in response to a question from a journalist that the air strikes could be averted if Syria turned over \\"every single bit\\" of its chemical weapons stockpiles within a week, but Syria \\"isn't about to do it and it can't be done.\\" State Department officials stressed that Kerry's statement and its one-week deadline were rhetorical in light of the unlikelihood of Syria turning over its chemical weapons. Hours after Kerry's statement, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Russia had suggested to Syria that it relinquish its chemical weapons, and Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moallem immediately welcomed the proposal. U.S.‚ÄìRussian negotiations led to the 14 September 2013 \\"Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons,\\" which called for the elimination of Syria's chemical weapon stockpiles by mid-2014. Following the agreement, Syria acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention and agreed to apply that convention provisionally until its entry into force on 14 October 2013. On 21 September, Syria ostensibly provided an inventory of its chemical weapons to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), before the deadline set by the framework. The destruction of Syria's chemical weapons began on the basis of international agreements with Syria that stipulated an initial destruction deadline of 30 June 2014. UN Security Council Resolution 2118 of 27 September 2013 required Syria to assume responsibility for and follow a timeline for the destruction of its chemical weapons and its chemical weapon production facilities. The Security Council resolution bound Syria to the implementation plan presented in a decision of the OPCW. On 23 June 2014, the last declared chemical weapons left Syria. The destruction of the most dangerous chemical weapons was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with US civilian merchant mariners. The actual destruction operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons of chemical agents in 42 days.  Military campaign Against ISIL in Syria  In September 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL in Syria. In November 2015, the Obama administration began the deployment of U.S. special forces to Syria, on the mission of assisting rebel forces in their fight against ISIL, President Obama then ordered several dozen Special Operations troops into Rojava in northern Syria to assist local fighters battling ISIL, authorizing the first open-ended mission by American ground forces into the country. Bahrain Some in the media questioned Obama's decision to welcome Bahrain in Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa in June 2011 because of the fierce crackdown on protesters in the country. The collaboration of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states with Bahrains royalty, had carried out mass repression since the middle of March. This included detaining, beating and torture of thousands. In June 2013, Obama urged meaningful reform in Bahrain. Bahraini officials rejected Obama's claims about sectarianism between Sunnis and Shias. Nevertheless, the Obama administration resumed providing arms and maintenance to the regime during its crackdown on pro-democracy groups, including ammunition, combat vehicle parts, communications equipment, Blackhawk helicopters, and an unidentified missile system. Accordingly, the administration's larger policy on dealing with the \\"Arab Spring\\" is to continue propping up longtime client regimes while fostering \\"regime alteration.\\" Yemen In December 2009, Obama may have ordered strikes on Yemen with the goal of attacking al-Qaeda. In early 2011, Obama asked Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh to stop the release of journalist Abdulelah Haider Shaye, who reported US involvement in the bombings.White House Stands By Obama Push for Yemeni Journalist to Remain Behind Bars, ABC News, Retrieved 2012-05-04.

Hendrik descended from the house of Wittelsbach and was a son of Philip, Elector Palatine. He was canon in Cologne before he was, at the recommendation of the Archbishop of Cologne, bishop of Utrecht elected by the chapters and burghers of Utrecht. But he lacked the support of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Charles, Duke of Guelders, who made life difficult for him. In the bishopric, Henry faced a faction-struggle. He entertained the idea of building a fort inside the city of Utrecht to keep the citizens in check. This idea would later be realised by Charles V as the Vredenburg. When the resistance of the Utrecht citizens escalated to the point where they invited troops from Guelders to occupy the city, Henry had no choice but to ask the Habsburgers for help. The Habsburgers quickly restored order, but in return the bishop was forced to relinquish all the lands controlled by the bishopric. The relinquishment was secured in the treaty of Schoonhoven on 15 November 1527,Holland under Habsburg Rule, 1506‚Äì1566, p. 75; Chapter three: The States of Holland and the Management of War and on 21 October 1528 the bishop swore fealty to Charles V. This was the end of the Bishopric of Utrecht as a territorial power. In August 1529, pope Clement VII finally empowered the transfer of the lands. Henry resigned as bishop of Utrecht in 1529 to focus on the rule of the calm bishopric of Worms, of which he had been bishop since 1523. He restored the bishop's summer-residence in Dirmstein that had been dismantled during the German Peasants' War of 1525. Later Henry was also consecrated as bishop of Freising, where his brother Ruprecht and Philip had previously been bishops.

The album was officially released on November 18, 2009, via Regain Records. It was recorded at The Abyss Studio in Grang√§rde, Sweden, with engineer and producer Peter T√§gtgren, who also produced Dark Funeral's earlier studio albums (with the exception of Attera Totus Sanctus). The record was then mastered by Jonas Kjellgren at the Black Lodge Studios. Angelus Exuro pro Eternus is the last album to feature vocalist Emperor Magus Caligula, the only album to feature bassist B-Force and the first to feature Dominator on drums. Upon release, the album was met with rave reviews by music critics and band fans, with only few reviewers giving the work negative or average ratings. Musically, it has been described as the band's most technical and varied album to date, with considerably more progression and innovation while remaining \\"true to its roots\\". The cover artwork for Angelus Exuro Pro Eternus was created by Daniel \\"Morbid\\" Valeriani. Video material The album is also available with a bonus live DVD, which contains approximately 55 minutes of previously unreleased material. The DVD was professionally filmed with 6 cameras during the band's highly acclaimed 15th anniversary special show during the Peace & Love festival in Borl√§nge, Sweden, on June 28, 2008. The album also includes two versions (censored and uncensored) of their video for the track \\"My Funeral\\". The video was shot over the August 21-23 weekend and was released on October 4, 2009. On October 7, 2009, three days later after the initial air of the video, after nearly 30,000 views, the full and uncensored version of \\"My Funeral\\" had been pulled from Myspace, causing a backlash from fans. This forced the band to upload a censored version of the video in response.

Carved by Peter Wolf Toth, it was the 56th Native American head in his Trail of the Whispering Giants series. The tall, statue was the first of two carved by Toth in Oregon. Completed in 1987, the statue was named in honor of a chief of the local Tualatin Indians. In early 2017, the statue was damaged by a tree blown over in a windstorm. It was ultimately determined to be beyond repair and was removed in June 2017. History Front of the sculpture along with city park sign Toth selected Shute Park in Hillsboro for his first sculpture of a Native American head in Oregon in July 1987. He wanted a location in the Portland metropolitan area to allow easy access for a large population to see the statue that would include features drawn from Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce tribe in northeastern Oregon. For his Trail of the Whispering Giants series, Toth carved a statue in each U.S. state with Oregon as the penultimate state. He began sculpting that month on a log of Douglas fir, Oregon's state tree. The log was donated by Stimson Lumber Company and delivered free of charge by local companies. On August 13, the partly carved log was lifted onto its base at the park along Tualatin Valley Highway by J. L. Craigg Construction. Toth carved it by hand, except for the use of an electric sander. The statue was later treated with wood preservatives and fiberglass was applied to the top to protect against the weather. On September 25, 1987, the sculpture was dedicated as Chief Kno-Tah in a ceremony featuring Native American singing and dancing. About 400 attended the ceremony on a day proclaimed as United American Indian Day by Hillsboro mayor Shirley Huffman. City and county civic leaders as well as local Native American leaders spoke at the ceremony. Kno-Tah was the leader of the Tualatin band of the Kalapuya group, who signed a treaty in 1855 with the government to cede their ancestral home on the Tualatin Plains to pioneer settlers. Students at the Chemawa Indian School in Salem, Oregon, selected the name from submissions from local residents. The tall statue was Toth's 56th in his series of Native American heads. Toth donated the statue to the state as he did with each in the series. A plaque on the base was later added. After completing the statue, he carved a second statue in Oregon in Astoria later that year to honor coastal tribes. Until 1996, a picture of the sculpture was used by the Hillsboro Chamber of Commerce for their postcards. In February 2017, the top of the carving was damaged when a wind storm blew an adjacent tree into the front side, shearing off part of the head and causing the entire statue to lean. On June 15, 2017, after officials deemed the leaning statue a safety concern, it was removed. Description Chief Kno-Tah was made of Douglas fir and was tall, and in diameter (19 cubic metres, 9.9 tonnes). The concrete base was tall and in diameter. The figure featured braided hair with feathers protruding from the back.

It is also known as reverse card sorting or card-based classification. A large website is typically organized into a hierarchy (a \\"tree\\") of topics and subtopics. Tree testing provides a way to measure how well users can find items in this hierarchy. Unlike traditional usability testing, tree testing is not done on the website itself; instead, a simplified text version of the site structure is used. This ensures that the structure is evaluated in isolation, nullifying the effects of navigational aids, visual design, and other factors.  Basic method  In a typical tree test: # The participant is given a \\"find it\\" task (e.g., \\"Look for men's belts under $25\\"). # They are shown a text list of the top-level topics of the website. # They choose a heading, and are then shown a list of subtopics. # They continue choosing (moving down through the tree, backtracking if necessary) until they find a topic that satisfies the task (or until they give up). # They do several tasks in this manner, starting each task back at the top of the tree. # Once several participants have completed the test, the results are analyzed.  Analyzing the results  The analysis typically tries to answer these questions: * Could users successfully find particular items in the tree? * Could they find those items directly, without having to backtrack? * If they couldn't find items, where did they go astray? * Could they choose between topics quickly, without having to think too much? * Overall, which parts of the tree worked well, and which fell down?  Tools  Tree testing was originally done on paper (typically using index cards), but can now also be conducted using specialized software.  References  External links * Dave O'Brien (2016).

He was one of a handful of chefs in the United Kingdom to have been awarded the coveted three Michelin stars at his restaurant La Tante Claire in London. Until December 2016 he was the head chef of Koffmann's at The Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge, London.\\"Pierre Koffmann says au revoir to the Berkeley... but will keep cooking\\", Evening Standard, 22 August 2016 Early life Koffmann was born in Tarbes, France, on 21 August 1948. He is of Alsatian German ancestry from his paternal side. His father worked as a mechanic for Citro√´n. It was with his maternal grandparents, Camille and Marcel, in Saint- Puy that he learnt how to cook when he visited with them during school holidays. Koffmann reminisced about this period in his 1990 book Memories of Gascony, and discussed it in an interview with The Guardian in 2010: \\"The produce was mostly from the farm. Steak was rare; we ate a lot of poultry. My grandmother did own a cooker, but most of her work was done over an open fire.\\" In 1963 he left school and applied for a variety of jobs, but ultimately decided to attend cookery school for the next three years. Career Koffmann first worked as a chef in Strasbourg and Toulon, before moving in 1970 to the United Kingdom to work with Michel and Albert Roux at Le Gavroche. He originally only wanted to move to the UK so that he could see England play France at rugby at Twickenham Stadium. He moved to the Roux brothers' Waterside Inn in Bray, Berkshire, in 1972, being made the first head chef of the new restaurant, where he met his future wife Annie who was the restaurant's manager. He opened his first restaurant, La Tante Claire, in 1977 in Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea. Six years after it opened, the restaurant gained its third Michelin star. La Tante Claire moved to The Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge, London, in 1998, with the former site being sold to become the flagship restaurant of Gordon Ramsay. During his time at La Tante Claire, Koffmann worked with several eminent chefs, including Ramsay, Marco Pierre White, Marcus Wareing and Tom Kitchin. He did not get on with Wareing, who made his feelings clear about Koffmann in Simon Wright's book Tough Cookies, saying of Koffmann, \\"Three-star kitchen! This guy didn't tell you anything. He didn't tell you what the lunch menu was, he didn't tell you where to get anything‚Ä¶ You didn't know if you were coming or going‚Ä¶ I could not click with the man.\\" More recently Wareing speaks better of Koffmann, saying \\"Koffmann is a complete thoroughbred. He ran the kitchen from the stove.\\" The signature dish of the restaurant was pig's trotter with chicken mousseline, sweetbreads and morels. Marco Pierre White has called this his \\"favourite dish of all time\\". Following the death of his wife Annie, he closed La Tante Claire in 2003. The space became the flagship restaurant of Marcus Wareing. After taking a break from restaurants, he was briefly head chef at the Bleeding Heart pub in Clerkenwell. In 2009, he opened a pop-up restaurant at Selfridges in London for ten days as part of the London food festival. He decided to serve classic dishes from La Tante Claire instead of new dishes as he originally planned ‚Äì \\"that's not what people want. They want the pig's trotter, the foie gras, the pistachio souffl√©. But maybe I do a new dish each day, as a special.\\" The ten days turned into two months. Koffmann described the first month as \\"a kind of hell\\", but got used to the hours again during the second month, and began to ponder opening a new restaurant; \\"I started to think about a new restaurant. I thought: why not? I still enjoy it. When you are a chef, your place is in the kitchen.\\" Koffmann's at The Berkeley hotel opened on 30 June 2010, at the former site of Gordon Ramsay's Boxwood Cafe; it was Koffmann's first full restaurant venture since the closure of La Tante Claire in 2003 at the same hotel. He said he was no longer chasing Michelin stars, and would instead cook the Gascon style food he remembered from his childhood. Koffmann's at The Berkeley closed on 31 December 2016. The space it occupied was due to be replaced by a gym.

It is governed by the Mills Archive Trust, which is a charity that is based at Watlington House, Reading, Berkshire. History The Mills Archive Trust was established in 2002. A grant of ¬£50,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund enabled the Archive to launch its internet catalogue in 2003. Other early supporters of the trust included the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB), and the Hampshire Mills Group, which donated ¬£200. The Archive was set up in response to an expressed need to preserve and where possible integrate the various threatened sources of information on the windmills and watermills of the UK and the rest of the world. It was hoped to prevent material being lost on the death of a molinologist by creating a suitable repository. In 2012, the Chairman Dr Ron Cookson was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for Services to Heritage. Originally a Charitable Trust (Reg no 1091534), the Trust became a Foundation-style Charitable Incorporated Organisation (Reg no 1155828) in February 2014. In November 2016 the Archive was awarded the status of a Nationally Accredited Archive Service. center Aims The Archive aims to focus on (but not be totally restricted to) traditional mills and milling, and seeks to acquire relevant historical and contemporary documentary and illustrative material and small artefacts. The main initial priority is records relating to UK mills, millers and millwrights, chiefly during the 18th‚Äì21st centuries, but the Archive plans to extend its coverage worldwide. \\"Traditional mills\\" include mills, similar structures and industrial processes that are or were powered by wind, water, muscle or other power sources, but not the massive modern industrial mills used for steel production and similar large-scale industrial enterprises. \\"Milling\\" includes millwrighting and the place of the mill in social and economic as well as technological and architectural history. Collections and services The Mills Archive was originally set up to care for four historically important Foundation Collections: those belonging to the SPAB, Mildred Cookson, Ken Major and Alan Stoyel. Since its establishment it has been given more than 250 further collections, both large and small. The Archive currently holds more than 3,000,000 items, most of which can be freely inspected by appointment at the Research Centre at Watlington House. Its catalogue is free to use, contains some 80,000 records and is rapidly expanding. The Archive also maintains a library containing more than 3,000 books on mills, in various languages. Most have been added to the online library catalogue. Apart from its wide use as a source of information about mills and their machinery in archival documents, books and journals, the Mills Archive has become a focus for family history researchers. More information can be found on the Archive's main website.

In 1489 he was sent to Rome, where he continued his studies at the Sapienza, and he achieved his Licentiate in 1505.NNBW, part 2, p. 436 In 1495 William entered the papal court, and he collected many prebends, so that he collected the income of parishes without actually being there, an accepted practice in those days. He represented the interests of the parishes in Rome. He also managed to obtain high posts in Rome for several of his family members. Through the election of Pope Adrian VI in 1522 his influence further increased, and together with Theodoricus Hezius he was a personal confidant of the pope. Before pope Adrian died, one of his last requests was that William be made cardinal. Some cardinals opposed this, but Adrian pushed his decision through and William was created Cardinal-priest of St. John and Paul on 10 September 1523.NNBW, part 2, p. 437 He was only the second cardinal ever created from the northern Netherlands, and the only cardinal created during Adrian's short reign. After the death of Adrian in 1523, William of Enckevoirt maintained his high positions and continued his involvement in politics, such as the transfer of all lands of the Bishopric of Utrecht to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and the crowning of Charles V as emperor in 1530. During the 1527 sacking of Rome by imperial troops, he paid 40,000 scudi to Captain Odone to protect his house and properties. In 1529 he was appointed bishop of Utrecht by pope Clement VII, but he was hardly ever there; he last visited the Netherlands in 1532. William, who was the executor of Adrian VI's will, took the initiative in erecting a funerary monument for him in Santa Maria dell'Anima. The monument was designed by Baldassare Peruzzi and included William's name and arms. He also financed the decoration of the Barbara chapel in this church by painter Michiel Coxcie. William of Enckevoirt died in 1534. His monument, created by Giovanni Mangone, was originally located opposite of Adrian VI's tomb, but it was moved in 1575. It is still visible next to the main entrance of the church. While cardinal, he was the principal consecrator of: Pedro Malgareso, Bishop of Dulcigno (1529); Bernardino de Soria, Bishop of Ravello (1529); and Miguel Torcella, Bishop of Alife (1533).\\"Willem Cardinal van Enckenvoirt\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org.

Development Because the Nintendo DS haven't Miis in the first Nintendo DS Games (Mii was released on November 19, 2006 for the first time for Wii), after all, the Miis was be showed at various games like Wii play, Wii sports, Wii party and most other games. Miis first appeared for the first time in the DS two years later in 2008, in Personal Trainer: Walking, and this game was released on 2009, one year later, only in Japan on June 18 th, 2009. Even, the DS version of Final Fantasy will can controls Mii's date, and there are playable characters also in a Yakuman game. This game and the Yakuman game was released only in Japan, but the first was translated on November 9th 2013 in American English by jjjewel, an USA fan. The game was developed by a small, young team at Nintendo SPD Group No.1 with Yoshio Sakamoto as producer. According to an interview, it was originally titled and only featured female characters. It was considered for a Western release according to an interview with Gamekult.fr, though issues with localizing the vocal synthesizer software to handle English words (which were resolved in Tomodachi Life) caused the release to be cancelled. However, a fan translation patch created in 2013 by jjjewel exists, which translates the game's text into English but retains the original Japanese voices. Other changes unfinished are that mid of the Mii News are still in Japanese (like the logo in the top screen while there are news) and small parts in-game. Sampling, the Concert Hall default lyrics are mid in Japanese and mid in English. Thank to jjjewel mod, the English Fan patch can be downloaded. If this work is set in advance in the Nintendo 3DS Mii Maker, there is a function only found in the Japanese version that allows you to call the Mii from the Tomodachi Collection, and you can copy and transfer to the 3DS side, but the newly created parts are added in the Mii Studio, It is not possible to send the Mii to the Tomodachi Collection from Mii Maker. Sequel A sequel for the Nintendo 3DS titled Tomodachi Life was released in Japan on April 18, 2013, and on April 10, 2014 in North America and Europe.http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/10/tomodachi- life-could-be-nintendoas-next-animal- crossing?abthid=534687ec7eb0922a6f000012http://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-3DS/Tomodachi- Life-871968.html The game was the best-selling game in Japan during the week of its release, selling about 404,858 units.

It is located in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. Kandy was the last capital of the Sri Lankan kings and is a World Heritage Site mainly due to the temple. Bhikkhus of the two chapters of Malwatte and Asgiriya conduct daily worship in the inner chamber of the temple. Rituals are performed three times daily: at dawn, at noon and in the evenings. On Wednesdays, there is a symbolic bathing of the relic with a herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers called Nanumura Mangallaya. This holy water is believed to contain healing powers and is distributed among those present. The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998 but was fully restored each time. History Front view of The Temple of the Tooth, Kandy, Sri Lanka Paththirippuwa at Sri Dalada Maligawa Kandy Sri Lanka After the parinirvana of Gautama Buddha, the tooth relic was preserved in Kalinga and smuggled to the island by Princess Hemamali and her husband, Prince Dantha on the instructions of her father King Guhasiva.Abeywardena 2004: p. 25 They landed on the island in Lankapattana during the reign of Sirimeghavanna of Anuradhapura (301-328) and handed over the tooth relic. The king enshrined it Meghagiri Vihara (present day Isurumuniya) in Anuradhapura. Safeguard of the relic was a responsibility of the monarch, therefore over the years, the custodianship of relic came to symbolize the right to rule. Therefore, reigning monarchs built the tooth relic temples quite close to their royal residences, as was the case during the times of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Kingdom of Polonnaruwa, and Kingdom of Dambadeniya. During the era of the Kingdom of Gampola, the relic was housed in Niyamgampaya Vihara. It is reported in the messenger poems such as Hamsa, Gira, and Selalihini that the temple of tooth relic was situated within the city of Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte when the Kingdom of Kotte was established there. During the reign of Dharmapala of Kotte, the relic was kept hidden in Delgamuwa Vihara, Ratnapura, in a grinding stone. It was brought to Kandy by Hiripitiye Diyawadana Rala and Devanagala Rathnalankara Thera. King Vimaladharmasuriya I built a two-storey building to deposit the tooth relic and the building is now gone.Seneviratna 1989: p. 90 In 1603 when the Portuguese invaded Kandy, it was carried to Meda Mahanuwara in Dumbara. It was recovered in the time of Rajasinha II and it has been reported that he reinstated the original building or built a new temple. The present-day temple of the tooth was built by Vira Narendra Sinha.Seneviratna 1989: p. 92 The octagonal Paththirippuwa and moat were added during the reign of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. The royal architect Devendra Moolacharya is credited with building the Paththirippuwa. Originally it was used by the king for recreational activities and later it was offered to the tooth relic, it now houses the temple's library. The temple has been attacked on two occasions, in 1989 by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and in 1998 by the militant organization Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

Holes in this wall are built to light coconut oil lamps. The main entrance gate which lies over the moat is called Mahawahalkada. At the foot of Mahawahalkada steps, there is a Sandakada pahana (moonstone) which is carved in Kandyan architectural style. Mahawahalkada was totally destroyed in a 1998 bomb blast and rebuilt afterward along with Sandakada pahana other stone carvings.Abeywardena 2004: p. 28 Elephants are depicted in stone on either side of the entrance. A Makara Torana and two guardian stones are placed on top of the staircase. Hewisi drummers' chamber is situated in front of the main shrine. The two storeys of the main shrine are known as \\"Palle malaya\\" (lower floor) and \\"Udu malaya\\" (upper floor) or \\"Weda hitina maligawa\\".Seneviratna 1989: p. 93 The doors of the Weda Hitana Maligawa are Ivory carvings. The actual chamber in which the tooth relic is kept is known as the \\"Handun kunama\\". The golden canopy over the main shrine, built in 1987 by Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa, and the golden fence which encircles the main shrine are other notable features.Abeywardena 2004: p. 26 The tooth relic is encased in seven golden caskets which are engraved with precious gemstones.Seneviratna 1989: p. 94 The caskets have a shape of a stupa. The procession casket which is used during the Kandy Esala Perahera is also displayed in the same chamber. Associated buildings and structures Royal Palace Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy built the Royal Palace of Kandy The royal palace is situated to the north of the temple.Abeywardena 2004: p. 36 John Pybus, who was on an embassy in 1762, gives a detailed description on the royal palace.Seneviratna 1989: p. 73 Vikramabahu III of Gampola (r. 1356-1374) and Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu of Kandy (r. 1469-1511) built royal palaces on this site. Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy undertook various decorations to the palace. The Dutch orientalist Philippus Baldaeus visited the palace with General Gerard Pietersz Hulft in 1656. The royal residence was known as \\"Maha Wasala\\" in Sinhalese starting in the Polonnaruwa period. The royal palace is also known as \\"Maligawa.\\" There were three Wahalkadas and an high wall used as main entrances. The section of the palace facing the Natha Devale is said to be the oldest. During the beginning of the British period, it was used by government agent Sir John D'Oyly, 1st Baronet, of Kandy. Successors of D'Oyly have continued to use it as their official residence. Today it is preserved as an archeological museum. Ulpen Ge and Queens Palace are the associated buildings of the palace.

The name originates from the town of the same name: Salazar, in northern Burgos, Castile. Although nowadays northern Burgos is not a Basque- speaking region, it was during the early Middle Ages when the surname appeared. Its origins are also related to a certain noble family, the Salazars, that held a fief in the area. During the 10th century, the surname appears as mentioned in Navarre, where it spread and there even exists a Salazar Valley. It later also spread to the rest of the Basque Country, being specially common in Biscay during the 15th century. During that time, Lope Garc√≠a de Salazar, a famous writer, took part in the Reconquista of Cuenca, where he was granted a fief and founded a notable family. Some of his descendants took part in the Conquest of the Americas, thus spreading the surname all through the Spanish Americas; others intermarried many noble families, and the surname spread all through the Iberian peninsula. Salazar is a common in Latin America because there were a number of Salazars among the early Spanish conquerors and settlers. Salazar is also a common surname among Roma people. Due to several censuses made in the Kingdom of Castile during the 14th and 15th centuries, every Castilian subject was forced to take a name and two surnames. The Roma, who used to call themselves only by a first name, decided to take established surnames to add prestige to their families.GAMELLA, Juan F.; G√ìMEZ ALFARO, Antonio y P√âREZ P√âREZ, Juan (2012). Los apellidos de los gitanos espa√±oles en los censos de 1783-85. Revista de Humanidades [en l√≠nea], n. 19, art√≠culo 3, ISSN 2340-8995. They chose from among the oldest noble families, usually of Basque origin, thus it is extremely common to find Roma with surnames such as Heredia, Salazar, Mendoza, or Montoya.Diccionario de apellidos espa√±oles, Roberto Faure, Mar√≠a Asunci√≥n Ribes, Antonio Garc√≠a, Editorial Eswpasa, Madrid 2001. .

A sui generis entity possessing international personality Although the Holy See, as distinct from the Vatican City State, does not fulfill the long-established criteria in international law of statehood; i.e. having a permanent population, a defined territory, a stable government and the capacity to enter into relations with other states;The criteria for statehood were first authoritatively enunciated at the Montevideo Convention on Rights and Duties of States, signed on 26 December 1933. its possession of full legal personality in international law is evidenced by its diplomatic relations with 180 states, that it is a member-state in various intergovernmental international organizations, and that it is: \\"respected by the international community of sovereign States and treated as a subject of international law having the capacity to engage in diplomatic relations and to enter into binding agreements with one, several, or many states under international law that are largely geared to establish and preserving peace in the world.\\"Robert Araujo and John Lucal, Papal Diplomacy and the Quest for Peace, the Vatican and International Organizations from the early years to the League of Nations, Sapienza Press (2004), , p. 16. See also James Crawford, The Creation of States in International Law, (1979) p. 154. As Graham notes: This peculiar character of the Holy See in international law, as a non-territorial entity with a legal personality akin to that of states, has led professor Ian Brownlie to define it as a \\"sui generis entity\\".Ian Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 4th ed. (1990) p. 65. Self-perception of the Holy See Moreover, the Holy See itself, while claiming international legal personality, does not claim to be a State. Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran, former Secretary for Relations with States of the Secretariat of State of the Holy See, has underlined that we must avoid the temptation of assimilating the Holy See and its international action with that of a State, with their thirst for power. For him, the Holy See is unquestionably a sovereign subject of international law but of a predominantly religious nature.Jean Louis Tauran, \\"Etica e ordine mondiale: l‚Äôapporto specific della Santa Sede\\", in Giulio Cipollone, La Chiesa e l‚Äôordine internationale, Roma: Gangemi Editore (2004) p. 184. (Italian) The legal basis of the Holy See's international personality For some authors, the current legal personality of the Holy See is a remnant of its preeminent role in medieval politics. Thus Arangio-Ruiz noted that the Holy See has been an actor in the evolution of international law since before the creation of strong nation states, and that it has maintained international personality since.Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz, Revue Belge de Droit International, 29 (1996) 354. For others, the international personality of the Holy See arises solely from its recognition by other states. In this sense, Brownlie argues that the personality of the Holy See ‚Äúas a religious organ apart from its territorial base in the Vatican City‚Äù arises from the \\"principle of effectiveness\\", that is, from the fact that other states voluntarily recognize the Holy See, acquiesce having bilateral relations with it, and in fact do so, in a situation where no rule of ius cogens is breached. For him, though, the international personality thus conferred is effective only towards those states prepared to enter into diplomatic relations with it.Ian Brownlie, Principles of Public International Law, 4th ed. (1990) p. 65 Crawford similarly believes that the recognition of a number of states is important evidence to acknowledge the legal personality of the Holy See, so that, today, it cannot be denied.See James Crawford, pp. 158-9. For a third group of authors, the international legal personality of the Holy See is based mostly, but not only, on its unique spiritual role. Araujo notes, for instance, that \\"it is generally understood that the Holy See‚Äôs international personality emerges from its religious, moral and spiritual authority and mission in the world as opposed to a claim over purely temporal matters. This is an incomplete understanding, however, of the grounds on which its claim as a subject of international law can be justified\\", since, in his view, the Holy See‚Äôs claim to international personality can also be justified by the fact that it is recognized by other states as a full subject of international law.Robert Araujo and John Lucal, Papal Diplomacy and the Quest for Peace, the Vatican and International Organizations from the early years to the League of Nations, Sapienza Press (2004), , pp. 4-5. The Lateran Treaty itself seems to support this view. In article 2, Italy recognized \\"the sovereignty of the Holy See in the international domain as an attribute inherent in its nature, in accordance with its tradition and with the requirements of its mission in the world.\\" For a further group, the legal personality of the Holy See in international law arises from the Lateran Treaty, which, in their view, conferred international standing to the central government of the Catholic Church. In this sense, Oppenheim argued that \\"the previously controversial international position of the Holy See was clarified as the result of the Treaty of 11 February 1929, between the Holy See and Italy - the so called Lateran Treaty. (...) The Lateran Treaty marks the resumption of the formal membership, interrupted in 1871, of the Holy See in the society of states.\\"Robert Yewdall Jennings and Arthur Watts, Oppenheim's International Law, v.1 Peace, 9th ed., (1992) , pp. 324-325. Oppenheim goes further and denies a separate legal personality for the Vatican City State. For him, the composite of the Holy See plus the Vatican City constitutes just one international person; see p. 328: Kunz sharply criticized this view. For him: Status between 1870 and 1929 A separate question is whether the Holy See was a subject of international law between 1870, when the Kingdom of Italy annexed the Papal States, and 1929, when the Lateran Treaties were signed. The United States, for instance, suspended diplomatic relations with the Holy See when it lost the Papal States.Robert Araujo and John Lucal, Papal Diplomacy and the Quest for Peace, the Vatican and International Organizations from the early years to the League of Nations, Sapienza Press (2004), , p. 7. Similarly, Oppenheim believed that the legal personality of the Papal States became extinct in 1870. For him, between 1870 and 1929, the \\"Holy See was not an international person,\\" although \\"it had by custom and tacit consent of most states acquired a quasi-international position\\".Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts, Oppenheim's International Law, v.1 Peace, 9th ed., (1992) , p. 326. The United Nations International Law Commission noted, nonetheless, that: Similarly, Kunz argued that: Opposition to the Holy See's participation in multilateral forums Since 1995, the non-governmental organization Catholics for Choice has advocated against the participation of the Holy See in multilateral forums.See Change, Why is this campaign important? It argues that the Holy See is a religious organization and not a state, and that, therefore, it should have neither a special status in international law nor the right to participate, in a position analogous to that of states, in the international conferences on social, cultural and economic matters.Seechange, The Catholic Church at the United Nations, Church or State? No State has supported this initiative. On the contrary, the United Nations General Assembly confirmed and raised further the status of the Holy See as an observer within the UN, through its Resolution 58/314 of 16 July 2004.

The reserve protects several rare and endangered plant and animal species within an area known as the Santa Cruz Sandhills, an ancient seabed containing fossilized marine animals. The land was purchased in 1989 by The Nature Conservancy which deeded the property to the state, and is now managed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. It is adjacent to the Laguna parcel of the San Vicente Redwoods protected area. The Santa Cruz Mountains are the only known location of the Zayante soil derived from the Santa Margarita geologic formation, that occur in three clusters in Santa Cruz County. Ancient seabed The Bonny Doon reserve protects species adapted to a type of soil known as Zayante, a Miocene-aged marine sediment and sandstone soil from an ancient sea that encompassed California's Central Valley. As the Santa Cruz Mountains were uplifted, the seabed and shoreline terraces was exposed and is known as the Santa Cruz Sandhills. The soil is almost 90% sand and little organic matter, found in scattered areas covering . Evidence of the soil's marine origin include fossil remains of sand dollars, bivalves and gastropods. Bonny Doon Ecological Reserve Botanist Peter Raven calls the Sandhills ‚Äúthe Galapagos Islands of Santa Cruz County.‚Äù In describing the area, he added, > \\"Dunes left as the ocean receded provide unusual habitats that form a mosaic > of openings and unusual vegetation in the dominant forest vegetation of the > region. As a model of the complexity of soils and habitats in California, > the Sandhills stand out prominently! My early experiences in and around them > helped to form my interest in botany and my passion for preserving plants > worldwide. > ‚ÄúFrom a global perspective, the Sandhills are important because of their > remarkable concentration of biodiversity. It affords a remarkable example of > the persistence of rare species, of species found beyond their normal > distributions, and of evolution in action.‚Äù Rare plants The Zayante soils create a microclimate that is drier and warmer than the surrounding areas which certain species have adapted to. Because of the uniquely adapted flora, the Zayante Sandhills are considered by botanists as a \\" biological island\\". Endemic to the Sandhills The rare and endangered Bonny Doon manzanita (Arctostaphylos silvicola) or silverleaf manzanita is the most common species, and is named for the silvery sheen of the leaves and the nearby community of Bonny Doon where the perennial shrub is most abundant. The Bonny Doon manzanita is also found in Santa Clara County which borders Santa Cruz County to the east. The Ben Lomond spineflower or Scotts Valley spineflower (Chorizanthe pungens var. hartwegiana), also called Hartweg's spineflower for Karl Hartweg who first collected a specimen in 1847, has been federally listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1994. A subspecies of the Monterey spineflower, it is an annual herb mostly restricted to the Zayante soils in the Santa Cruz Mountains, although there are documented specimens from San Mateo, San Francisco and Santa Clara counties as well. The Santa Cruz wallflower (Erysimum teretifolium) is a biennial \\"monocarpic\\" plant, which means that it dies after flowering and bearing fruit in the second or third year. There are less than 20 known occurrences of the federal and state listed endangered Santa Cruz wallflower. A perennial herb of the Brassicaceae or mustard family, it blooms from March through July with yellow flowers on terminal spikes. The Ben Lomond wild buckwheat (Eriogonum nudum var. decurrens) is a \\"species of concern\\" that blooms with white flowers from June through October and is easily confused with its close relative, Eriogonum nudum var. auriculatum or naked buckwheat. Other rare plants Other wildflowers of the reserve are not only rare, they have not yet been officially \\"described\\" by botanists. These include tipless tidy tips (Layia platyglossa), the slender gilia (Gilia tenuiflora) and the Zayante everlasting (Gnaphalium sp. nov.). Rare trees in the reserve include as least two species of conifer. The ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or yellow pine is a common tree in the Sierra Nevada Mountains above but not seen this close to the Pacific Ocean. These pines were once considered their own distinct species, Pinus benthamiana, but later were lumped together with Pinus ponderosa, although other botanists still argue whether or not to put them in their own subspecies. \\"These pines have seven or eight features that are different from those in the Sierra,\\" explained botanist Valerie Haley. The Santa Cruz cypress (Cupressus abramsiana) is a conifer endemic to sandy soils on the western slope of the Santa Cruz Mountains. It is found in only five populations covering , about half of which is in the Santa Cruz Sandhills habitat. The Santa Cruz cypress was federally listed as endangered on February 9, 1987. The first plant collection was made by M.E. Jones in 1881. The cypress is a closed-cone conifer that requires fire to open the cones for seed dispersal, although the interval between fires is critical for cypress grove maturity. June 11, 2008, the Martin fire burned 520 acres including more than half of the reserve, which closed until May 2009. The Martin fire could actually provide benefits to an area that hasn't burned in at least 40 years, and in some parts for nearly a century. \\"This isn't the way we want to introduce fire, but it's part of a natural process.\\" said Jeannine DeWald, a California Fish and Wildlife biologist. Wildlife There are two species endemic to the Sandhills that are federally listed as endangered: the Zayante band-winged grasshopper and the Mount Hermon June beetle. Also occurring in the Sandhills is the narrow-faced kangaroo rat. The rodent's name comes from the jumping style of movement, resembling the Australian kangaroo. Bird species observed include the long-eared owl, pileated woodpecker and Townsend's warbler. Other wildlife are the species common to forested mountain terrains like the coyote, black-tailed deer, mountain lion and raccoon. There are several species of bat, including the big brown bat, one of several species of bat afflicted with the white nose fungus.

It is the oldest, widest and largest radio and television service provider in Zambia It was established by an Act of Parliament in 1987, which was passed to transform the Zambia Broadcasting Services from being a Government Department under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services into a statutory body called the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation. History Introduction of radio It was not until World War II that Zambia, then Northern Rhodesia, acquired a radio service. In 1941 the Government's Information Department installed a 300 watt transmitter in Lusaka, the capital.Horizon: The Magazine of the Rhodesian Selection Trust Group of Companies, Volume 7, 1965, page 21 Known as Radio Lusaka, this station was built for the purpose of disseminating war-related information.EBU Review: Radio and Television Programmes, Administration, Law, Issue 83, Administrative Office of the European Broadcasting Union, 1964, page 27 From the outset, the Lusaka station addressed programs to Africans in their own languages, becoming the pioneer in the field of local vernacular broadcasting in Africa.African Broadcast Cultures: Radio in Transition, Richard Fardon, Graham Furniss, James Currey Publishers, 2000, page 23 In 1945, Harry Franklin, Director of the Information Department, proposed that Radio Lusaka be developed into a fully-fledged station broadcasting exclusively to Africans.Wayaleshi, Pierre Fraenkel, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, page 195 Since Northern Rhodesia could not afford such a specialized service on its own, the administrations of Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland were persuaded to share in the operating costs, while the British Government agreed to provide capital funds. Broadcasting in Africa: A Continental Survey of Radio and Television, Sydney W. Head, Temple University Press, 1974, pages 125-127 Thus, the Central African Broadcasting Station (CABS) came into being.World Broadcasting: A Comparative View, Alan Wells, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, pages 157-159 Among the by-products of this effort were the world's most extensive collection of ethnic African music, and a breakthrough in that most formidable barrier to audience growth, the lack of a receiver which Africans could afford to buy. Franklin tried for three years in the late 1940s to persuade British manufacturers that a potential mass market existed among Africans for a very simple inexpensive battery operated short wave receiver, in the era before transistors, before finally persuading a battery company to invest in the research and development of the idea.Friends for Life, Friends for Death: Cohorts and Consciousness Among the Lunda-Ndembu, James Anthony Pritchett, University of Virginia Press, 2007, page 115 One of the early models was mounted experimentally in a 9-inch diameter aluminum housing originally intended as a saucepan. Thus was born in 1949 the famous \\"Saucepan Special\\", a 4-tube tropicalized short wave receiver.A note on the ‚ÄòSaucepan Special‚Äô: the people's radio of Central Africa, Rosaleen Smyth, Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, Volume 4, 1984 - Issue 2, pages 195-201 This succeeded even beyond Franklin's expectations. It cost five pounds Sterling, and the battery, which lasted 300 hours, an additional one-pound five shillings. Within the first three months 1,500 of the Saucepan Specials had been sold, and in the next few years, 50,000 sets were imported. Franklin had hopes of capitalising on a world market for the sets, but within a few years the transistor radio came into mass production and so turned his brainchild into a mere historical curiosity. Federation In 1953, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was established, with Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) as its capital, and the Southern Rhodesian Broadcasting Service, which catered for European listeners, became the Federal Broadcasting Service (FBS).E.B.U.

Steinberg, Springer, page 286 In 1955, a Federal Commission of Enquiry into the organisation of broadcasting in the Federation proposed the creation of a new broadcasting organisation, to be called the \\"Rhodesia and Nyasaland Broadcasting Corporation\\", which was to be established in 1956.BBC Handbook, BBC, 1956, page 132 However, it was not until 1958 that the FBS and CABS would be merged into the Federal Broadcasting Corporation (FBC).Africa Media Review, Volumes 3-4, page 75 Introduction of television In 1961, a television service, which had been introduced in the Salisbury and Bulawayo areas, became available in the Copper Belt of Northern Rhodesia.The Statesman's Year-Book 1964-65, S.

The former FBC station in Lusaka became the Northern Rhodesia Broadcasting Corporation, which following independence later that year, was renamed the Zambia Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC).EBU Review: Radio and Television Programmes, Administration, Law, Issue 83, Administrative Office of the European Broadcasting Union, 1965, page 27 This, in turn, was succeeded by the Zambia Broadcasting Service (ZBS) in 1966.Africa Media Review, Volumes 3-4, African Council on Communication Education, page 75 In the same year, the government also took control of television services, with Television Zambia becoming part of the ZBS in 1967.Area Handbook for Zambia, Volume 550, Issue 75, Irving Kaplan, American University (Washington, D.C.). Foreign Area Studies U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969, page 255 At the end of 1988, the ZBS was replaced by the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC), a government department under the Ministry of Information, Broadcasting and Tourism.Zambia, John P. Sangwa, Article 19, Freedom of Expression Institute, Media Institute of Southern Africa, 1998, pages 10-11 Broadcasting services There are three domestic services. Radio 1 is carried over 8 FM transmitters, broadcasting in the seven major languages of Bemba, Nyanja, Lozi, Tonga, Kaonde, Lunda and Luvale. These are used in rotation to ensure a prime time audience for each group. Radio 2 is also broadcast by 8 FM transmitters in English, while Radio 4 is broadcast in English over 5 FM transmitters. The now defunct Radio 3 was the international service.Handbook of the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, Secretariat, Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, 1988, page 147 Used mainly by liberation movements in other countries in the region, it closed in 1992, having been considered to have outlived its usefulness. Programs include news, public affairs, light entertainment, sport, religion and education. School broadcasts are carried during school semesters. Agricultural programs for farmers cover all the country areas. Listening is encouraged by free provision of receivers for farm radio forums, of which there are more than 600. An annual licence fee is payable but many receivers are not licensed. The principal activity of the Corporation is to provide Information, Entertainment and Education to the people of Zambia.

Podrecca is considered by some critics a pioneer of postmodernism. With some of his early works, such as the neuro-physiological institute at Stahremberg Palace (1982), he took a new, more tolerant attitude towards historical architectural forms.  Biography  He was born in Belgrade, Serbia (then in Yugoslavia), to a Slovene father and a Serb mother. His father was a Slovene immigrant from the Italian border region known as Julian March (Venezia Giulia), who had fled to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in order to escape persecution from the Italian Fascist regime. His original Slovene surname, Podreka, had been Italianized to Podrecca in the early 1930s. After World War II, the family moved to Trieste, Italy, where Boris attended a Slovene language elementary school. In the 1960s, he moved to Vienna to study architecture at the University of Technology where he graduated in 1968 with Professor Roland Rainer. From 1979 to 1981 he worked as an assistant at Technical University of Munich and later, as a guest lecturer at Lausanne, Paris, Venice, Philadelphia, London, Harvard- Cambridge, Boston and Vienna. From 1988 until 2006 he was full professor at the Technical University of Stuttgart and Director of the Institute of Architectural Design and Theory of Space. He is a foreign member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Boris Podrecca became famous with the exhibition of the work of the architect Carlo Scarpa in the church of Chiesa della Carita at the 1984 Venice Biennale and later the Villes d'Eaux exhibition in Paris. He was also responsible for the exhibition of the work of Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik in the Pompidou Centre in Paris (1986). As a leading exhibition designer he set up the Biedermeier (Vienna, 1987), Bismarck, Prussia, Germany and Europe (Berlin, 1990) and One Hundred Years of Austria exhibitions (1996).Boris Podrecca short bio  Main works Tartini Square, Piran, Slovenia Piazza XXIV Maggio, Cormons, Italy *Tartini Square, Piran, Slovenia, 1987‚Äì89 *Piazza XXIV Maggio, Cormons, Italy, 1989‚Äì1990 *Dirmhirngasse School, Vienna, 1991‚Äì1994 *Museum of Modern Art, Ca' Pesaro, Venice, 1992‚Äì2002 *Greif- Areal mixed-use development, Bolzano, Italy, 1992‚Äì2000 *Judeca Nova Apartments, Giudecca, Venice, 1995‚Äì2003 *\\"In der Wiesen\\" Social Housing, Vienna, 1996‚Äì2000 *Millennium Tower, Handelskai, Vienna, 1997‚Äì1999 *Railway Square, Krems an der Donau, Austria, 1997 *Hotel and Conference Centre, Mons, Ljubljana, 2000‚Äì2004 *City Square, Motta di Livenza, Italy, 2001‚Äì2002 *Praterstern Urban Square, Vienna, 2002‚Äì2008 *VBio Center 1, Vienna, 2003‚Äì2005 *Skidome und Multi-Functional Center, Garching bei M√ºnchen, Germany, 2005 *Punta Skala Resort, Zadar, Croatia, 2005- *Station San Pasquale, Napoli, Italy, 2006- *≈†umi Center, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 2006 - *Science and Technology Museum, Belgrade, Serbia, 2007- *Civic-Cultural Centre in Ajdov≈°ƒçina, Slovenia, 2010 - *Grain Bridge, Ljubljana, 2010 *PP1 project (skyscraper and \\"city cottages\\"),PP1 project Padua, 2010 - *Hotel Falkensteiner, Belgrade, Serbia, 2012http://www.beobuild.rs/read.php/579.html  Awards  *1986: Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, Paris *1990: Kulturpreis f√ºr Architektur, Vienna *1992: Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik Award, Ljubljana *1996: Honorary Member of the Federation of German Architects *2000: Honorary degree of the University of Maribor, Slovenia *2003: Liberty Award by the President of the Republic of Slovenia  References * Boeckl, Matthias: Boris Podrecca.

Included in the list are all historic areas within the National Park System, over 2,200 National Historic Landmarks, and properties across the nation that have been nominated for the honor. The mill's heritage runs back to the Cherokee Indians. It was built by Benjamin Franklin Prater in 1855. The water powered mill was originally fitted with the latest in grain cleaning, grinding and sifting machinery, all powered by the Coahulla Creek. As the mill's popularity grew, Prater added a cotton gin, a saw mill, a wool carder, a syrup mill, a general store, and a blacksmiths shop. For almost a hundred years, farmers would line up with their mules and wagons early in the morning to get their turn with the millers. During the civil war, the mill was used as campsites for both sides of the war. While used by the Union army, the mill was considered a valuable source for food so it was not destroyed. The Prater family ran the mill until the 1950s. A succession of miller's ran the mill until the 1960s. In 1971, the all-volunteer Prater's Mill Foundation took over the mill and began extensive restoration and preservation efforts. Today the mill is best known for the arts and crafts festival held twice a year. Throughout the year, the grounds are a popular site for fishing, cookouts and family reunions. On May 20, 1995, fire was intentionally set on the north side of the mill. Two arson convictions have been made to date. Most of the damage was on the inside of the mill. The force of the fire blew out most of the windows, damaged the roof, siding, electrical system, and destroyed an antique display case.

History The Bauhaus Center, founded by Asher Ben Shmuel, Micha Gross and Shlomit Gross in 2000, is at 77 Dizengoff Street in Tel Aviv, Israel. The founders recognized the need to document the history and patrimony of the Bauhaus architecture in Tel Aviv. They established the Center in order to increase awareness of this, and to expose Bauhaus as a style that crosses boundaries between different art media. The Center has been collaborating closely with the Israel National Commission for UNESCO since the designation of Tel Aviv as a World Heritage Site in 2003. The Center also cooperates with the Municipality of Tel Aviv and several educational institutions, galleries, museums and associations of engineering and architecture. The center was formerly located at both 99 and 155 Dizengoff St. Structure * Bookstore and Library - The Center's bookstore specializes in design, architecture and the city of Tel Aviv. Its library contains archival material about the Bauhaus era in the city as well as rare books about the subject. The Center also acts as an independent publishing house for books about Bauhaus architecture and design, and the City of Tel Aviv. * Gallery - The gallery shows documentary exhibitions on Tel Aviv and its architecture, culture, people, design and photography. * Tours - The Center conducts walking tours around the White City showing prominent Bauhaus buildings, built during the 1930s and 1940s. There are also self-service tours in the area of Dizengoff Square using an audio guide. * Shop - The Bauhaus shop hosts a collection of items of a wide variety of purposes including fashion, interior design, Judaica and jewelry. It offers to local artists and designers a space to show, promote and sell their works to the public.

The cave largely consists of phreatic mazes formed along weaknesses in the jointing of the limestone rocks. These complex mazes result in a cave which contains several kilometres of passage yet covers a very small area: around . The exact length of the cave is unknown as the cave has yet to be fully surveyed, despite several years of continuous surveying in the early 1980s by local cavers. Estimates have ranged from 2.5 km to 7 km. A further system of unexplored caves has been known to exist under the town itself, since a section of the main street collapsed into a cavern in the mid-20th century. The cave is very difficult to explore due to the confusing nature of the mazes. People have been said to have been lost in the cave for two days.

As a writer he usually signed by using the acronym S.Z. Abramov. Biography Born in Minsk in the Russian Empire (today in Belarus), Abramov made aliyah to Palestine in 1920. He was educated at the Herzliya Hebrew High School in Tel Aviv, before studying at the Western Reserve University, obtaining a doctorate in jurisprudence. Whilst in the United States, he served as Vice President of the Zionist Students of America organisation between 1931 and 1933. He also later served as Chairman of the Israel-United States Friendship League from 1950 until 1964.Zalman Abramov: Public Activities Knesset website A member of the General Zionists, Abramov was elected to the Knesset on the party's list in 1959. He was re-elected in 1961, 1965, 1969 and 1973, during which time the General Zionists merged into the Liberal Party, then Gahal and later Likud. Between 1963 and 1972 he represented the Knesset at the European Council, and in 1970 he became chairman of the Executive Committee of the Public Council for Soviet Jewry. From 1974 until 1977 he also served as a Deputy Speaker of the Knesset. He was considered as the major thinker and theoretician of Israeli liberalism, though his positions tended to be more moderate and progressive than those of most of the members of his own party and of other political affiliations to which he belonged. Throughout his life he remained convinced that Chaim Weizmann's vision represented the right path for Zionism. Accordingly, he believed that Israel's strength lies in its efforts to cultivate its educational institutions and research institutes, as well as in its ability to impose moral constraints upon itself by applying a broad universal perspective also when it is bound to deal with local or regional affairs.

ACC is a biotin-containing enzyme which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. ACC-beta is thought to control fatty acid oxidation by means of the ability of malonyl-CoA to inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid uptake and oxidation by mitochondria. ACC-beta may be involved in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation, rather than fatty acid biosynthesis.  Clinical implications  Human acetyl-CoA carboxylase has recently become a target in the design of new anti-obesity drugs. However, when the gene for ACC2 was knocked out in mice, no change in body weight was observed relative to normal mice.

In the mathematical field of graph theory, the friendship graph (or Dutch windmill graph or n-fan) Fn is a planar undirected graph with 2n+1 vertices and 3n edges. The friendship graph Fn can be constructed by joining n copies of the cycle graph C3 with a common vertex.. By construction, the friendship graph Fn is isomorphic to the windmill graph Wd(3, n). It is unit distance with girth 3, diameter 2 and radius 1. The graph F2 is isomorphic to the butterfly graph. Friendship theorem The friendship theorem of . states that the finite graphs with the property that every two vertices have exactly one neighbor in common are exactly the friendship graphs. Informally, if a group of people has the property that every pair of people has exactly one friend in common, then there must be one person who is a friend to all the others. However, for infinite graphs, there can be many different graphs with the same cardinality that have this property.. A combinatorial proof of the friendship theorem was given by Mertzios and Unger. Another proof was given by Craig Huneke. A formalised proof in Metamath was reported by Alexander van der Vekens in October 2018 on the Metamath mailing list. Labeling and colouring The friendship graph has chromatic number 3 and chromatic index 2n. Its chromatic polynomial can be deduced from the chromatic polynomial of the cycle graph C3 and is equal to (x-2)^n (x-1)^n x. The friendship graph Fn is edge-graceful if and only if n is odd. It is graceful if and only if n ‚â° 0 (mod 4) or n ‚â° 1 (mod 4)... Every friendship graph is factor-critical. Extremal graph theory According to extremal graph theory, every graph with sufficiently many edges (relative to its number of vertices) must contain a k-fan as a subgraph. More specifically, this is true for an n-vertex graph if the number of edges is :\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n^2}{4}\\\\right\\\\rfloor + f(k), where f(k) is k^2-k if k is odd, and f(k) is k^2-3k/2 if k is even. These bounds generalize Tur√°n's theorem on the number of edges in a triangle-free graph, and they are the best possible bounds for this problem, in that for any smaller number of edges there exist graphs that do not contain a k-fan..

The idea is trivial in that a client and server connection on a local loopback interface within the same system should not need the entire TCP/IP protocol stack to exchange data. Therefore, provide a faster data path with the fusion of the two end points. The source code is well documented in inet/tcp/tcp_fusion.c which clearly states : TCP fusion is a protocol-less data path for TCP loopback connections. The fusion of two local TCP endpoints occurs at connection establishment time. Various conditions (see details in tcp_fuse()) need to be met for fusion to be successful. If it fails, we fall back to the regular TCP data path; if it succeeds, both endpoints proceed to use tcp_fuse_output() as the transmit path. tcp_fuse_output() enqueues application data directly onto the peer's receive queue; no protocol processing is involved. Sychronization is handled by squeue and the mutex tcp_non_sq_lock. One of the requirements for fusion to succeed is that both endpoints need to be using the same squeue.

Chryseobacterium species are chemoorganotrophic, rod shape gram-negative bacteria. Chryseobacterium form typical yellow-orange color colonies due to flexirubin- type pigment. The genus contains more than 100 described species from diverse habitats, including freshwater sources, soil, marine fish, and human hosts.  History  The genus Chryseobacterium was originally created in 1994 by Vandamme et al. for six bacterial taxa that, at that time, were classified as members of the genus Flavobacterium: F. balustinum, F. indologenes, F. gleum, F. meningosepticum, F. indoltheticum, and F. scophthalmum. In 2005 an additional genus, Elizabethkingia, was created for two species within the genus Chryseobacterium; namely, C. meningosepticum and C. miricola. In 2002 standards and guidelines for description of novel taxa in the family of Flavobacteriaceae were published by Bernardet et al. By 2006, the genus Chryseobacterium had expanded to 10 species, by 2014 more than 60 species and currently more than 100.  Ecology  Chryseobacterium spp. were recovered from soils, plant roots, flowers, decaying plant material and maple sap. Some plant-associated Chryseobacterium strains are able to inhibit plant pathogenic fungi. Chryseobacterium spp. were also recovered from freshwater creeks, lakes, their sediments, water cooling systems, drinking water, lactic acid beverages, beer bottling plants, bioreactor sludge, polluted soil, marine sediment and permafrost. Chryseobacterium spp. are associated with a multitude of animals - they have been detected in the midgut of mosquitos, within cockroach guts, millipede feces, and penguin guano, gut homogenates of freshwater copepods, bird feathers, cow‚Äôs milk, raw meats and chicken. Chryseobacterium spp. were recovered from the mucus of apparently healthy fish, however sometimes they are considered as a spoilage organism. Three novel cold-tolerant species of Chryseobacterium, C. oranimense C. haifense, and C. bovis, have been detected in raw milk in Israel.  Pathogenesis  The most pathogenic Flavobacterium spp., Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, which caused numerous infections, was reclassified to the genus Elizabethkingia. Chryseobacterium indologenes although ubiquitous in nature, mainly found in soil and water, is an uncommon human pathogen. However, in rare cases it can cause serious infections, particularly among the immunocompromised. Most of the time infections are hospital acquired, often associated with immunosuppression or indwelling catheters. It has been reported as the causative agent in bacteremia, peritonitis, pneumonia, empyema, pyelonephritis, cystitis, meningitis and central venous catheter-associated infections. The numbers of reported C. indologenes infections are increasing. The majority of reported infections have been from Taiwan and only about 10% have been outside of Asia. A few reports have come from Australia, India, Europe and the USA. C. indologenes is also pathogenic to the soft tick, whereas other Chryseobacterium spp. were recovered from diseased turtles, frogs and fish, in particularly C. scophthalmum, C. joostei, C. piscicola, C. chaponense, C. viscerum and C. oncorhynchi, C. aahli, C. hominis, C. shigense as well as C. indologenes which is associated with human diseases. Certain Chryseobacterium species were reported as having unusual matrix digesting properties, being able to degrade most difficult collagenous matrices, such as feathers or exoskeletons. These properties are likely mediated through the action of specific chitinases and collagenase-like metalloproteases. Some of the species, such as Chryseobacterium nematophagum were shown to be able to infect, kill and ultimately consume all nematode tissues, including the normally highly insoluble cuticular exoskeleton. Chitinase, geleatinase and collagenase metalloprotease activities have been linked to Chryseobacterium gliding motility exerted through type IX secretion systems. Indeed, some of these enzymes possess C-terminal type IX secretion signals. Chryseobacterium themselves have neither collagen nor chitin proteins or structures. Chryseobacterium species belong to the Bacteriodetes phylum, members of which are being increasingly describes as having unusually linked motility and secretory system. Botulinum neurotoxin-like (BoNT-like) toxins were detected in the genome of Chryseobacterium piperi str. CTM and they present a highly divergent group of BoNT-like toxins. One of the predicted C. piperi BoNT-like toxins induced necrotic cell death in human kidney cells, but was not found to cleave common SNARE substrates of BoNTs.  Antibiotic resistance  Chryseobacterium spp. are inherently resistant to a wide spectrum of antibiotics, including tetracyclines, erythromycin, linezolid, polymyxins, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and many beta-lactams, while also being intermediately sensitive to vancomycin and clindamycin and vary in their sensitivity to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Since 2001, it has been an independent corporation that manufactures analogue and digital dictation devices featuring the \\"Made in Germany\\" quality label.  Background  The company began with the Stenorette A ‚Äì the first Grundig dictation machine on the market ‚Äì which took place in 1954. The Steno-Cassette 30, developed by Grundig in 1983, became the DIN standard. In association with a consortium project of the International Voice Association, the .dss Digital Speech Standard was developed by Grundig in 1995. The dictation machine production has been independent from its former parent Grundig under the name of Grundig Business Systems since late 2003.  History  The first Grundig dictation device, Stenorette, was launched on the market in 1954. Because of its initial green casing the dictation device was simply called \\"tree frog\\" by the workers. Three years later Max Grundig opened the ‚Äì as he called it ‚Äì \\"largest tape recorder factory in the world\\" in Bayreuth. Since then dictation devices from Grundig Business Systems have been produced at this location. The number of employees in Bayreuth rose to 2,000 in the middle 1960s. The seventies saw the introduction of the first mini index cassette for dictation devices with integrated tape counter ‚Äì Steno Cassette 30. Grundig also produced the Stenorette 2002, featuring the first desktop dictation system with the K 30 Steno cassette and the Stenorette SL, a portable dictation system for use both in and out of the office. Both products were manufactured for nearly twenty years. The Steno-Cassette 30 became the DIN standard (DIN 32750) in 1983. At the beginning of the 1990s, GBS developed the first digital dictation system in the world ‚Äì PC dictation 2000. For the first time speech information was digitalized and stored on the PC's hard drive. The DSS standard (Digital Speech Standard) was developed and introduced by Grundig as a joint project of the IVA (International Voice Association, comprising Grundig, Olympus and Philips) in the course of the decade. Dictation machine activities were separated from the Grundig Corporation in 2001 ‚Äì a new company was established. Since then the Grundig Business Systems GmbH has been operating profitably. Thus it was not affected by the later insolvency of the Grundig Corporation. The first digital dictation device from the Digta brand was launched one year later. In 2003 Grundig Business Systems was acquired by the INDUC AG (today: INDUC GmbH). In 2017 the circle of investors was expanded to include VR Equitiypartner. Afterwards, the Stenorette digital Sd 4240 was launched in 2004, featuring a transcription system processing both analogue and digital dictations. GBS introduced the world‚Äôs first RFID scanner for dictation devices in 2005. The Digta 410, the first device of the 400 series, followed one year later. In 2007 the Digta 420 was the world‚Äôs first mobile dictation device featuring a colour display. It supports the improved DSSPro voice standard which was developed under the auspices of GBS. The Digta CordEx, the world‚Äôs first wireless dictation microphone for professional use, was presented by GBS in 2008. For this product GBS was awarded the Innovation Prize IT 2009 at the CeBIT trade show in Hanover in March 2009.Innovationspreis-IT 2009 Category Office, Digta CordEx wins Innovation Price-IT 2009.

They use wind powerWindmill sailboats through a mechanical or electrical transmission to the propeller. Where transmission is electric, storage batteries may also be used to allow power generated at one time to be used for propulsion later on. Windmill ships should not be confused with rotor ships, which instead rely on the Magnus effect for propulsion. Points of sail Because a windmill can rotate 360¬∞ into the wind, no matter what direction the ship is facing, a windmill ship can sail in any direction. In fact, because the power produced depends almost entirely on the apparent wind, they can produce the most power sailing directly upwind.Windmill powered boatsWindmill ship video demonstrating sail points and boat specifics Note that sailing upwind, while resulting in more power generation by the wind turbine, requires more power to be expended by the engine and thus it is still more efficient to sail down wind. To sail upwind, a conventional sailing vessel must tack across the wind.  Types  Several types can be made; these include wind-turbine-only ships as well as hybrid ships which store wind power from the turbine when the ship does not need to be propelled. To reduce the energy required to propel the boat, windmill ships are often equipped with low-friction hull designs, such as multihulls, or they are hydrofoils. Boats without low-friction hulls or hydrofoils can be equipped with wind turbines, but often the force generated by the turbines alone is not sufficient to propel the craft. In this case, the turbines only provide supplemental force to conventional sails or other propulsion systems. At present, research is still going on and the best types of bladed rotors still needs to be determined. For example, high horizontal axis wind mills are proven to make the ship less stable. Therefore, vertical axis wind mills (e.g., Savonius turbines) are sometimes preferred.Rotor sails schematic and model boat construction Also, the wind mill needs to be highly durable as marine environments tend to degrade windmills more quickly than what is common on land.Windmill ship researchVertical axis windmill on windmill boat Current ships Few windmill ships have been built to date; these include:Current windmill ships * Jim Bates' Te whaka * Lindsay Olen's Thrippence * Peter Worsley's windmill-driven boat * Jim Wilkinson's Revelation 2 * Blackbird (land yacht) The film Waterworld starring Kevin Costner featured a trimaran powered by a vertical-axis Darrieus wind turbine.

It has been described as \\"the most famous indigenous art centre in South Africa\\". History Founded by the Church of Sweden Mission, Rorke's Drift Art and Craft Centre started producing weaving in 1965. Its first Swedish directors were Ulla (an artist and weaver) and Peder Gowenius (an art teacher), both graduates of Konstfackskolan in Stockholm. During the 1960s the three main production studios were established at Rorke's Drift (as it is known worldwide), and its staff continue to design and create tapestries and woven rugs, printed fabrics and stoneware ceramics to the present. The Pottery Workshop started in 1968 with Danish supervisors (first Peter Tybjerg, then later Ole and Anne Nielsen) with founding throwers Gordon Mbatha, Ephraim Ziqubu, Bhekisani Manyoni and Joel Sibisi. Already expert ceramists from the neighbouring Shiyane-Nqutu region, Dinah Molefe and several women of her family joined the Pottery Workshop from the start as skilled hand-builders, accustomed to using traditional Zulu and Sotho coiling methods in the making of domestic izinkamba (beer pots). The gendered work-division in the studio‚Äôs ceramics ‚Äîwomen coiling, men throwing‚Äî has been maintained to the present. Through his consultations as intergroup mediator in the late 1960s, H.W. van der Merwe was alerted to the presence of Rorke‚Äôs Drift Art and Craft Centre in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and a need for assistance in its newly established Pottery Workshop. His wife Marietjie was an MFA (Ceramics) graduate of UCLA and a practicing South African ceramist who was able to offer her support to the studio at Rorke's Drift. Marietjie was appointed Advisor to the Pottery Workshop in 1971, and having designed and built a large oil-firing kiln in 1973, she continued to mentor the studio‚Äôs ceramists and to help with technical problems until her death in 1992. In the era when apartheid policies denied a formal education to black artists and crafters, under the Directorship of Jules and Ada van de Vijver, Rorkes Drift also established a Fine Art School. The van de Vijver's introduced printmaking, photography and weaving to the Center that produced some of southern Africa‚Äôs most renowned artists and printmakers (for example Azaria Mbatha, John Muafangejo, Dan Rakgoathe, and Bongiwe Dhlomo). The authoritative publication about Rorke's Drift printmakers, most of whom were trained at its Fine Art School was written by Philippa Hobbs and Elizabeth Rankin in 2003. Titled Rorke's Drift: Empowering Prints the book's publisher in Cape Town is Double Storey. Christiane Voith is the current Centre Manager of Rorke's Drift Art and Craft Centre. Location Rorke's Drift is also the location of the battlefield of the Battle of Rorke's Drift (1879), a historical site in the Anglo-Zulu War where British troops defeated a large Zulu army. The nearby battlefield is a major draw for tourists.

The name of the unit reflected its geographic jurisdiction. Wartime activities Koziy was born in the town of Pukasivtsi, then in eastern Poland (now in Ukraine). Between 1939 and 1944, Koziy was alleged to be a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. He was allegedly involved in the displacing of Jews into ghettos. He allegedly shot Bernard Kandler, who had tried to escape from a truck that was taking him to a ghetto; Lusi Rosiner, a fourteen-year-old hiding in a barn, and the four-year- old Monica Singer. In 1944, fleeing the Soviet advance, Koziy and his family moved to Heide, Germany, where he worked as a farm hand. After Nazi Germany's surrender in 1945, the Koziys lived in a variety of displaced persons camps. In the United States After the Displaced Persons Commission interviewed Koziy, he was granted permission to enter the United States on 17 December 1949, under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948. On 25 April 1955, Koziy filed his application to file a petition for naturalization. On 25 July 1955, he filed a petition for naturalization and on 9 February 1956, Bohdan Koziy became an American citizen. On 20 November 1979, the United States requested the cancellation of Koziy's certificate of naturalization on the grounds that Koziy had illegally procured his citizenship by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation by failing to disclose his involvement in the occupational police in Ukraine. Koziy denied involvement in the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police and contended his actions were insufficient to support revocation of his citizenship. However, his citizenship was revoked on the basis of testimonies of Polish witnesses in a court hearing on 29 March 1982. Subsequent investigation Koziy moved to Costa Rica in 1985. On 23 September 2002, the Branch Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation in Katowice initiated an investigation into the case of a Nazi crime committed in ≈Åysiec in the Stanis≈Çaw√≥w Voivodeship. Bohdan Koziy was accused of the murder of three Jews: Bernard Kandler, Lusi Rosiner and Monica Singer. On 21 November 2003, the Polish authorities turned to the government of Costa Rica demanding Koziy's arrest and extradition. The Costa Rican court granted the deportation order but Koziy died soon after on 30 November 2003, while in hospital in San Jos√©, from a stroke.

History Following the establishment of the Senate and the House of Representatives in Ceylon under the Soulbury Commission, the House of Representatives had six members appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister to represent important interests which were not represented or inadequately represented in the House, they were usually from the European and Burgher communities and on occasions from the Indian Tamils and Muslim (Moors or Malays) groups. On a few occasions caste groups from within the Sinhalese and Tamils also obtained representation in Parliament as appointed members. In the Senate, 15 members were elected by the lower chamber, the House of Representatives and the other 15 members were appointed by the Governor- General on advice of the Prime Minister and generally consisted of distinguished individuals. The senators were known as \\"Elected Senators\\" and \\"Appointed Senators\\" respectively. The Senate was abolished in 1971.

He was also the recipient of a Royal Television Society award for Reporter of the Year in 1980, and was presented with an International Reporting Prize for work in Latin America. He was awarded the MBE for his services to broadcasting in 2006. Early life and career Born in Bristol, Barron attended Bristol Grammar School.Guide to Independent Schools. Retrieved on 16 September 2009. Directly on leaving school, he started as a print journalist, working for the Western Daily Press in Bristol, before joining BBC News as a chief sub-editor in 1965. Barron spent 40 years with the BBC, mostly overseas, starting as a producer with what became the BBC World Service. Barron was appointed Aden correspondent in 1967, covering the fall of that part of the British Empire, after which he became Cairo correspondent in 1968. In 1971 he became South East Asia correspondent, and covered the Vietnam war, including in 1975 reporting against instructions from BBC Governors as the last US Army helicopter left Saigon, and as the North Vietnamese Army claimed victory. He then covered the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War. Based in Nairobi from 1977 onwards, covering all of Africa as chief correspondent, Barron covered the end of the regime of Idi Amin, and was the first foreign correspondent to reach an abandoned Kampala, filing a report from the headquarters of the State Research Bureau, Amin's secret police. Jon Snow, then a rival correspondent for ITN, commented that Barron was: After Amin fled, Barron and cameraman Mohammed Amin, of Visnews in Nairobi, in 1980 located Amin to the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah. Amin had been given refuge because of his conversion to Islam; after weeks of negotiation Barron secured the first interview with him since his deposition.

He is the Author of 'A Study of the Origins and Migrations of Anioma Settlements' (2015), 'A Short History of Omu' (2016), published by Carophem Communications Limited, Ibadan, and 'Essentials of Anioma History' published in United States of America by SGNT Media. Esogbue is currently the Editor-at-Large of Integrity Watchdog and the Research Editor with the Organization For the Advancement of Anioma Culture (OFAAC), publishers of Anioma Essence Magazine. He is also the Associate Editor of Homage Magazine. As a historian, Emeka Esogbue favours the use of historical continuity in rendering past accounts and digging into the past of the Anioma people. He emphasizes on the origin and inter-tribal relationship of the Anioma people of Delta, Anambra, Imo, Edo and Rivers States of Nigeria. Emeka Esogbue has in his writings passionately criticised the near assimilation of the Anioma people by related ethnic groups in the country and many of his works are centred on this. He was born to the family of Esogbue in Isieke, Umuekea in Ibusa (Igbuzo) in Oshimili North Local Government Area of Delta State, Nigeria. His parents were Patrick Chukwudumebi and Theresa Nwasiwe Esogbue. Dumebi was said to be a member of the defunct Biafran Commando unit during the Nigerian Civil War. His grandfather was Joseph Ozoemezie Esogbue, the first engine driver produced by Ibusa, his community. Chief (Prof) Augustine Onwuyalim Esogbue, the Ozokilolo of Ibusa, once the only black man in the service of NASA, is also a member of his family. Education and career Emeka attended State Primary school, Lagos (1976‚Äì1982), later Agboju Secondary School (1983‚Äì1988) and Lagos State University (2000‚Äì2006). He was nominated the Peer Group Coordinator and Public Relations Officer of Pan African Agency for AIDS and Drug Abuse (PANCADA) (2001‚Äì2003). He started his journalistic practice (though informally trained) with the defunct Festac News, a local newspaper in the 1990s reporting for the media outfit. He was also a contributor to Ibusa Pathfinder an Ibusa newsletter. Emeka would join Trade Africa, publishers of Africa Global Business magazine, Lagos-based media outfit in 2009 as a member of the Editorial Executive. In 2010, he was a contributor with Gold Fad, an Ekiti-based magazine. Writer of Anioma history Esogbue has conducted considerable researches on Anioma aimed at digging into the origin of the people. The employment of oral sources is considered his major style in weighing and achieving flow of historical link. He has also sought to know the original ancestral home of Umejei the founder of Ibusa. Esogbue embarked on a historical research on the listing of the past Senior Diokpas of Ibusa. Severally, he has moved for the development of the Ibusa community especially, craving support for investments in the town and transformation of Okpuzu Waterfall as an international tourist centre. He condemned the demolition of remains of St. Augustine's Catholic Church, Ibusa built with red-baked bricks by the European missionaries in 1898, stating that the foundation of the church should rather have been strengthened to give the coming generation the opportunity to see the first church in their community and made a tourist centre. He would also condemn the limitation of street lighting facilities to Asaba stressing that Okpanam, Ogwashi-Uku and Ibusa should have benefited as other major towns near the capital city. He also criticised the conversion of the famous St. Thomas' College, Ibusa, built in 1928, to a same-sex female secondary school and described the policy as a \\"shameful fall in standard and marginalization of the people\\". Emeka Esogbue with the Obi of Ubulu-Uku, HRM (Obi) Kikachukwu, HRM (Obi) Martha Dunkwu, the Omu of Okpanam/Anioma and other guests after the presentation of \\"Essentials of Anioma History, authored by him Other works Esogbue has written on many subjects, particularly on the political front of his country, and has in several of his writings condemned the policies of the government of Nigeria, which in his own opinion have visited the citizens with unbearable hardships. The relocation of the nation's capital from Lagos to Abuja as propagated by the military regime of Murtala Mohammed leading to the duplication of national facilities, establishments of the Ajaokuta Steel Complex and the sudden emergence of Abuja have received criticisms from him as factors that have depleted the nation's economy. He is known to have condemned high bride-price in Nigeria, particularly in Iboland at various times. It is his belief that elders must never sit down in the village and demand high bride-price over a girl-child when they did not contribute to her up-bringing and know nothing about. \\"In his view, except the trend is reversed, it would continue to lead to a higher population of unmarried Ibo women, single parenting, out of wedlock pregnancies and high mortality rate\\". Essentials of Anioma History, the book authored by Emeka Esogbue and launched in Ibusa, Delta State Anioma activities Emeka has been in the forefront for the creation of a separate state for the Anioma people currently situated in Delta State of Nigeria, which, according to him, should include Igbanke in Edo State, while also settling for South-South as an ideal geo-political zone for the proposed state. \\"Any further creation of states in Nigeria without the consideration of Anioma will mean further marginalisation and strangulation of the people.\\" He has also advocated for a sixth state for the South East zone, probably Njaba and Adada for the Nsukka District of present Enugu State. Esogbue is also known for his vigorous campaign for the ceding of Igbanke and Ekpon to Delta State to be included in the proposed Anioma State. The two communities are of Ika speaking presently located in Edo state. On 21 December 2011 Emeka Esogbue delivered a lecture titled 'History of Igbanke and Setting Agenda for Igbanke' in which he described the town as an Ika community both by origin and language. He described himself as a friend of the community that has thoroughly researched into her history. It was the first All Igbanke Conference organised by Igbanke National Progressive Association. In 2013, he was announced as the Reviewer of the book, 'Wild Ixora', a literary book authored by Philip Ngozi Ifechukwude. In December 2013, Esogbue announced Dr (Mrs) Ngozi Olejeme as the winner of Anioma Personality of the Year, an award won previously by Arc Kester Ifeadi and Mr Awele Nwabuokei, Ubulu Okiti and Ogwashi- Uku indigenes respectively. On 1 January 2014, Esogbue featured as one of the three discussants at a seminar organised by Ibusa Sports Club in Ibusa to launch the body's calendar. He spoke on 'Youth Restiveness in Ibusa: Who to Blame'. Emeka Esogbue is the initiator of Ibusa Singles Meet, an organisation concerned with the promotion of Ibusa inter-marriage. On Saturday, 23 March 2014, Esogbue, on the request of Igbanke Nationals Progressive Association, the socio-cultural organisation of Igbanke went on a fact-finding mission to Igbanke in Edo State to ascertain the general level of developments in Oligie, why Oligie does not have portable water despite the award of the project, challenges faced by the Enogie of Oligie, igbanke and challenges faced by Igbanke people as a whole were later reported by him. After the mission, reports were made available to the Igbanke community with recommendations made. Part of the 7-point recommendations read that 'That Oligie is troubled with underdevelopment as the investigators did not observe functional portable water or solar-streetlights near the palace of the Enogie and that the bore-hole sited was not functional'. It was also reported that there were no good road, light, factories, industries and other means of employment in Oligie. The organizers of Ibusa Youth Forum would announce Emeka Esogbue as a notable Guest Speaker expected at the event in Lagos also attended by renowned Economist and Co-founder of Lagos Business School, Prof Pat Utomi and the nation's former Chief of Naval Staff, Vice-Admiral Joseph Dele Ezeoba. On 8 October 2016, Esogbue, in his speech, at the event told participants that 'about 51% of youth vices committed in Ibusa was by non- indigenes'. He also opined that such non-indigenes were urged, goaded or guarded by indigenes. He also stated that while pre-1990 was the peak of social development for the community, post-1990 has been a period of neglect for the same community while noting that the period stifled and repressed any hope of development on the community by the government under the Capital Territory Development Area policy of the newly created Delta State in 1991. On 7 January 2017, Esogbue launched his book Essentials of Anioma History in Ibusa with important dignitaries mostly from Anioma personalities that included traditional rulers and Omus from the region in attendance.

The group has continued to hold these conferences from 2011 to 2019, attended by high profile figures from the community. Promotion of Ibusa inter-marriage is the major objective of Igbuzo Singles Meet and so far, successes have been recorded in this area among the singles of the Ibusa community.

The theorem states that given a set of training data that is not linearly separable, one can with high probability transform it into a training set that is linearly separable by projecting it into a higher-dimensional space via some non-linear transformation. The theorem is named after the information theorist Thomas M. Cover who stated it in 1965. In his own words,  Proof  A deterministic mapping may be used: suppose there are n samples. Lift them onto the vertices of the simplex in the n-1 dimensional real space. Since every partition of the samples into two sets is separable by a linear separator, the theorem follows. The left image shows 100 samples in the two dimensional real space. These samples are not linearly separable, but lifting the samples to the three dimensional space with the kernel trick, the samples becomes linearly separable. Note that in this case and in many other cases will not be necessary to lift the samples to the 99 dimensional space as in the proof of theorem.

The film stars Murali, Jalaja and Sadu in the lead roles.  Synopsis  \\"Not the limpid pool of water-lilies, But the ocean of life, which is the ink-well of our poetry\\" Thus sang a famous poet, in Malayalam. Nidhiyude Katha (The Treasure) evolves from this idea. The protagonist is an artist of the ivory tower who goes to a remote beautiful place to portray nature. There he comes across two fugitives, a young man and a girl. The man is hunted by the law of the land. Could he be an extremist? He hurls the artist a question: \\"Who is the real murderer, the one who kills a thousand people or the one who kills the killer of a thousand people?\\" The girl is a slum-dweller driven away by the society. The Artist gives shelter to her for the night. But he feels a bout of jealousy when he finds the man intruding into the shelter. We feel that the artist's sophisticated behavior is only a veneer. His relationship with the two undergoes a transformation - from hatred and intolerance, it changes to that of sympathy. Before the night wears out, the young man is shot dead. The girl makes the artist realize the significance of the young man's death and the artist gets ready to search for the dead body. It was a long night of myriad experiences and of strange dreams for the artist. The night makes him undergo a sea-change. The girl bids him farewell. But he does not hesitate to call her back. She chooses to return to her world of misery. He removes his old canvas and commences a new painting. A chain of fantasy is interwoven in the story. At the outset of this, we see the artist exploring for a hidden treasure. The fantasy sequences end with the girl pointing out the treasure to him.

A royalist figure of the First English Civil War, he was also the first editor of George Herbert and Thomas Jackson, and a personal friend of Nicholas Ferrar. In old age he was archdeacon of Ely for a year. Life He was baptised in the parish church of Wakefield on 26 December 1602, as son of Francis Oley, a clerk, who married Mary Mattersouse on 25 June 1600. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, which he entered in 1607. In 1617 he proceeded to Clare College, Cambridge, probably as Cave's exhibitioner from his school, and graduated B.A. 1621, M.A. 1625, and B.D. A crown mandate for the degree of D.D. to him and two other eminent divines was dated 14 April, and published 17 June 1663, but the honour was declined. He was elected probationer-fellow of the foundation of Lady Clare at his college on 28 November 1623, and a senior fellow in 1627, and filled the offices of tutor and president, one of his pupils being Peter Gunning. Oley was also taxor for the university in 1634, and proctor in 1635. In 1633 he was appointed by his college to the vicarage of Great Gransden, Huntingdonshire, and held it until his death; but for several years he continued to reside at Cambridge. The first steps for the rebuilding of the college, which was begun on 19 May 1638 but not finished until 1715, were taken under his direction; he was called by Thomas Fuller its 'Master of the Fabric.' When the university sent its plate to the king at Nottingham to be converted into money for his use, it was entrusted to his care and safely brought to the king's headquarters, August 1642, a mission with John Barwick. For not residing at Cambridge, and for not appearing before the commission when summoned to attend, he was ejected by Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester from his fellowship on 8 April 1644. He was also plundered of his personal and landed property, and forced to leave his benefice. For seven years he wandered through England in great poverty. In 1643 and 1646 he was at Oxford. Early in 1645, when Pontefract Castle was being defended for the king, he was within its walls, and preached to the garrison; and when Sir Marmaduke Langdale was condemned to death in 1648, but escaped from prison, and hid for some weeks in a haystack, he made his way to London in clerical dress supplied by Oley. For some time he lived at Heath, near Wakefield, and in 1652-3 he stayed in the north, near Lady Saville's demolished house. In 1659 Oley returned to Gransden, and on 9 July 1660 he was restored to his fellowship by an order of the same Earl of Manchester. Through Gilbert Sheldon he was presented on 3 August 1660 to the third prebendal stall of Worcester Cathedral, and on 8 November 1679 he was collated, on the nomination of Gunning, his old pupil, to the archdeaconry of Ely. This preferment he resigned in the following year but he retained the stall at Worcester until his death. Oley died at Gransden on 20 February 1686, and was buried there on the night of 22 February, an inscription to his memory being placed on the wall at the west end of the interior of the church. Works Oley edited in 1652 Herbert's Remains, or sundry pieces of that Sweet Singer, Mr. George Herbert, containing A Priest to the Temple, or the countrey parson, Jacula Prudentum, &c.; Prefixed was an unsigned preface by Oley. The second edition appeared in 1671 as A Priest to the Temple or the Country Parson, with a new preface, signed Barnabas Oley. These pieces were reprinted in later editions of Herbert's Works. The manuscript of The Country Parson was the property of Herbert's friend, Arthur Wodenoth, who gave it to Oley; the prefaces were a source for Izaak Walton's memoir of Herbert. Three volumes of the works of Thomas Jackson appeared under the care of Oley in 1653-57. The three volumes were reissued in 1673, with a general dedication to Sheldon, then Archbishop of Canterbury, and with a preface to the reader enlarged and edited from the three that existed (reprinted in Jackson's Works, ed. 1844). The Jackson manuscripts were left by Oley to Thomas Lamplugh. Oley was one of those appointed by Gunning to sort Nicholas Ferrar's papers. Legacy He built and endowed the brick school-house of 1664 in Great Gransden, now the Barnabas Oley School.http://www.barnabasoley.cambs.sch.uk/our-history He made many other charitable bequests, one of which deserves a place in the history of the development of libraries in the UK. In 1685, he granted money to 10 poor parishes in the diocese of Carlisle, Cumbria, in order that they should buy a set of 16 divinity books, a set to be placed in each vicarage. This was the first time that libraries had been provided for the poorest parishes, work that was taken up in the 1690s by Dr. Thomas Bray both in England and Wales and in the USA.

It is used in the field of mining engineering for calculations relating to the temperature regulation of mine air. Sigma heat is sometimes called total heat, although total heat may instead mean enthalpy.  Definition  Sigma heat is the energy which would be extracted from a unit mass of humid air if it were cooled to a certain reference temperature under constant pressure while simultaneously removing any condensation formed during the process. Because sigma heat assumes that condensation will be removed, any energy which would be extracted by cooling the water vapor below its condensation point does not count towards sigma heat. The reference temperature is usually , although is sometimes used as well. Assuming a reference temperature of 0¬∞F, the following formula may be used under standard temperature ranges and pressure:Different temperature ranges or pressures will slightly alter the heat capacity of the water vapor and the air, causing a deviation from the accuracy of this formula. S = 0.24 \\\\mathrm{\\\\tfrac{BTU}{lb \\\\cdot ^\\\\circ F}\\\\;} t + W \\\\;( 0.45 \\\\mathrm{\\\\tfrac{BTU}{lb \\\\cdot ^\\\\circ F}\\\\;} t + 1061 \\\\mathrm{\\\\tfrac{BTU}{lb}} ) :where : S is the sigma heat of the air (in BTU/lb), : t is the dry-bulb temperature of the air (in ¬∞F), and : W is the specific humidity of the air (unitless). The equivalent metric formula: S = 17.86 \\\\mathrm{\\\\tfrac{kJ}{kg}} + 1.005 \\\\mathrm{\\\\tfrac{kJ}{kg \\\\cdot K}} t + W \\\\;( 2501 \\\\mathrm{\\\\tfrac{kJ}{kg}} + 1.884 \\\\mathrm{\\\\tfrac{kJ}{kg \\\\cdot K}} t) :where : S is the sigma heat of the air (in kJ/kg), : t is the dry-bulb temperature of the air (in ¬∞C), and : W is the specific humidity of the air (unitless) sometimes expressed as kg/kg.  Comparison with enthalpy  Sigma heat is not the same as the enthalpy of the humid air above the reference temperature. (Enthalpy is sometimes called total heat or true total heat) Unlike sigma heat, enthalpy does include the energy which would be extracted in cooling the condensed water vapor all the way to the reference temperature. Essentially, enthalpy assumes that all components of the system must be cooled during the cooling process, whereas sigma heat assumes that some of those components (liquid water) are removed part way through the process. Nevertheless, some writers mistakenly use the term enthalpy when they actually mean sigma heat, creating some confusion. Assuming a reference temperature of 0¬∞F, the relationship between enthalpy and sigma heat may be shown mathematically as: h = S + 1 \\\\mathrm{\\\\tfrac{BTU}{lb}\\\\;} W t' :where : h is the specific enthalpy of the air above its reference temperature, : S is the sigma heat of the air (in BTU/lb), : W is the specific humidity of the air (unitless), and : t' is the wet bulb temperature (in ¬∞F). :(Standard temperature ranges are assumed.)  Wet bulb temperature vs. dry bulb temperature  Assuming constant pressure, sigma heat is solely a function of the wet bulb temperature of the air. For this reason, humidity need not be taken into account unless dry-bulb temperature measurements are used. Like sigma heat, the wet bulb temperature is not directly affected by the temperature of any condensed water vapor (liquid water), and it varies only when there is a net energy change to the system. In contrast, the dry bulb temperature can vary even for processes where there is no such net energy change. This difference may be understood by examining evaporative cooling. During evaporative cooling, all energy lost from air molecules as sensible heat is gained as latent heat by water molecules evaporating into that air. With no net energy gained or lost from the now more humid air, sigma heat remains unchanged. In keeping with this, the wet bulb temperature also remains unchanged, as its reading already represented the maximum possible amount of evaporative cooling. The dry bulb temperature however is in conflict with the sigma heat since it decreases during such evaporative cooling. This is why measurements of sigma heat which use dry bulb temperatures must also take into account the humidity of the air.

The Juniors section runs age group teams from under-14 to under-8 in Boys, Girls and Mixed formats. The club has had its home venue at Long Road Sixth Form College, Long Road, Cambridge since autumn 2014. Training is currently offered on Mondays for the Men's 1st and 2nd XIs, Wednesdays for Ladies 1sts and 2nds, and Thursdays for all other senior teams. Under-14s train on Wednesdays, with a session for younger children on Saturday mornings. The club also runs casual mixed sessions on Tuesday and Friday evenings. During the 2020‚Äì21 season the Men's 1st XI will play in Division 1, whilst the Ladies 1st XI will compete in Division 1N. History The club was formed in about 1935, originally as a company team for the paper manufacturer Spicers, based in the village of Sawston. At some point the club evolved to become Sawston Hockey Club, still based in the village and playing at the grass pitches owned by Spicers. When league regulations demanded that clubs play their games on artificial pitches, rather than grass, the club moved their home games into Cambridge. The move into the city eventually resulted at the end of the 1997/98 season in the Men's club deciding on a second change of name to Cambridge South Hockey Club, with the Ladies' club following suit the next season. The move to Long Road triggered a period of rapid expansion for the club, particularly on the Women's side. A Ladies 4th XI was founded in 2017 with 5th and 6th teams following in 2019 and 2020 respectively. 5th and 6th Men's XIs have been added in the same period.

He won the 1938 Epsom Derby on his second racecourse appearance. Background He was named for Haras du Bois-Roussel, the breeding farm in Alen√ßon where he was foaled. His breeder was Leon Volterra who acquired his sire, Vatout, and his dam as part of his purchase of Haras du Bois Roussel from American, Jefferson Davis Cohn. According to Thoroughbred Heritage, his dam, Plucky Liege, was one of the most important broodmares of the 20th century. At the time of foaling Bois Roussel Plucky Liege was 23 years old. Racing career Bois Roussel did not start as a two-year-old. Raced at age three by Leon Volterra, he made his racing debut in early 1938 at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris, winning the Prix Juign√©, an event for unraced colts and geldings. Shortly thereafter, Volterra sold Bois Roussel for ¬£8,000 to the Hon. Peter Beatty, son of Admiral David Beatty and grandson of Chicago department store magnate, Marshall Field. His new owner sent Bois Roussel to England to run in June's Epsom Derby. Making just the second start of his career, bettors sent the colt off at 20/1 odds. Ridden by jockey Charlie Elliott Bois Roussel scored an upset victory in England's most prestigious race. He was slowly away and among the back markers entering the straight. In the final quarter mile he produced what the Glasgow Herald described as \\"an astonishing burst of speed\\" to come from well off the pace and take the lead inside the final furlong. He won going away by four lengths from Scottish Union and the favourite Pasch. In winning, he earned more in prize money than Beatty had paid for him. In his only other race start, Bois Roussel ran third to the undefeated Nearco in the Grand Prix de Paris. Stud record Bois Roussel was rested as a four-year-old and went to stud in stud duty in England, in 1940 at a fee of 300 guineas. His stud career was satisfactory without being spectacular. Among his progeny were: * Castagnola (dam of Zucchero who won ten races value ¬£14,837) * Delville Wood (1942) ‚Äì four wins worth ¬£3,020, five-time leading sire in Australia * Edie Kelly dam of St. Paddy (1957) ‚Äì won Epsom Derby, St. Leger Stakes * Fraise du Bois II (1948) ‚Äì won Irish Derby * French Beige ‚Äì won Doncaster Cup * Hikaru Meiji (JPN) Tokyo Yushun (Derby) * Hindostan (1946) ‚Äì won Irish Derby, seven-time Leading sire in Japan * Migoli (1944) ‚Äì won ¬£22,950 in England plus 5,209,500 francs in France including the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, sired Belmont Stakes winner Gallant Man * Fraise du Bois (three wins value ¬£11,226 and second in the St. Leger) * Ridge Wood (1946) ‚Äì won seven races, ¬£21,658 including the St. Leger Stakes * Star of Iran dam of Petite Etoile (1956) - wins included The Oaks, 1,000 Guineas Stakes, and the Coronation Cup twice * Swallow Tail (six wins value ¬£12,440, third in the Derby and exported to Brazil) * Tehran (1941) ‚Äì won ¬£7,258 including St. Leger Stakes, leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland (1952), sired Tulyar * Woodburn (1945) ‚Äì winner of the Yorkshire Cup and Cesarewitch Handicap. * Last but not least he is the great grandfather of Red Rum, the three-time winner of the Aintree Grand National. He was not a leading sire but was second on the list of sires of winners in both 1947 and 1949.

The version vector allows the participants to determine if one update preceded another (happened-before), followed it, or if the two updates happened concurrently (and therefore might conflict with each other). In this way, version vectors enable causality tracking among data replicas and are a basic mechanism for optimistic replication. In mathematical terms, the version vector generates a preorder that tracks the events that precede, and may therefore influence, later updates. Version vectors maintain state identical to that in a vector clock, but the update rules differ slightly; in this example, replicas can either experience local updates (e.g., the user editing a file on the local node), or can synchronize with another replica: * Initially all vector counters are zero. * Each time a replica experiences a local update event, it increments its own counter in the vector by one. * Each time two replicas and synchronize, they both set the elements in their copy of the vector to the maximum of the element across both counters: V_a[x] = V_b[x] = \\\\max(V_a[x], V_b[x]). After synchronization, the two replicas have identical version vectors. Pairs of replicas, , , can be compared by inspecting their version vectors and determined to be either: identical (a=b), concurrent (a \\\\parallel b), or ordered (a < b or b < a).

Built in 1919, by the 1930s the theater had earned the reputation as \\"America's Finest Colored Photoplayhouse\\". The theater closed in 1970, after attendance dwindled and the threat of the Crosstown Expressway had decimated the neighborhood. (The proposed highway was never built.) In 2000, Kenny Gamble‚Äôs Universal Companies purchased the Royal, 1522 and 1536 South, buildings on either side of the theater, as well as 1523, 1537 and 1539 Kater St. (the narrow street just south of South) and 1521‚Äì1523 South St. (across the street), from the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia for $250,000.  Conservatorship lawsuit  In April 2013, Universal Companies applied for a demolition permit claiming the renovation was \\"economically unfeasible.\\" Universal's proposal would preserve only the facade and a small portion of the front for culture use while the remaining property would be developed for commercial use. On May 20, 2013, local Philadelphia resident Juan Levy filed in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas a petition seeking to appoint local real estate developer Ori Feibush as conservator over the property to save it from further deterioration.  Redevelopment Study  In April 2015 an independent architectural surveyor presented a financial feasibility analysis for various reuse scenarios for the Royal. The surveyor concluded that the building was reduced to a shell and \\"...there is no use to which the Royal Theater may be reasonably adapted given the cost of renovations and the revenues that can be expected by those uses...\\" In July 2015 the Philadelphia Historical Commission approved the owners plan to demolish the auditorium and preserve the Royal's facade which would be incorporated into a new retail and residential building. Demolition of the auditorium began in 2017.  Legacy  In 1936 the staff of the Royal organized to form the Colored Motion Picture Operators Union. The last public event to be held at the Royal occurred in June 2009. A preservation coalition presented two performances of jazz and video in the ruins of the auditorium.

Sixteen volunteer commissioners, along with representatives from organizations concerned with women's issues, guide VCW's public education, coalition building, and advocacy efforts. VCW is a state agency working to help women achieve legal, economic, social, and political equality in Vermont. Founded in 1964, the Commission serves as an adviser, planner, and information source for the legislature on issues affecting women. The commission also functions as an educational resource for the public by conducting research, producing publications on the legal rights of Vermont women, and providing conferences and workshops.  Background  In 1962, President Kennedy challenged every state to create a ‚ÄúGovernor‚Äôs Commission on the Status of Women.‚Äù These commissions would be charged with two tasks: ‚ÄúTo encourage women to use their abilities, and to reduce discrimination against women.‚Äù In response, on November 23, 1964, Vermont Governor Philip Hoff established the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women by executive order. The order directed the Commission to conduct research about ‚Äúhow discrimination was occurring, how women‚Äôs roles were changing, documenting the needs of working women and their children, and supporting a more active role of women in the political life of the state.‚Äù It is now one of the oldest commissions in continuous operation in the United States, having celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2014. VCW: * conducts research and study of issues affecting the status of women in Vermont; * advises and consults with the executive and legislative branches of State government on policies affecting the status of women in Vermont; * educates and informs business, education, State and local governments, and the general public about the nature and scope of sex discrimination and other matters affecting the status of women in Vermont; * serves as a liaison and clearinghouse between government, private interest groups, and the general public concerned with services for women.  Advocacy  The VCW researches and monitors legislation and policies that are important to women and families in Vermont. VCW also assists various policymakers with research on pertinent policy issues. VCW organizes and partners with broad-based coalitions on issues affecting Vermont families.  Change the Story campaign  The Vermont Commission on Women, in coalition with Vermont Works for Women and the Vermont Women's Fund, launched the statewide campaign \\"Change the Story Vermont\\" to advance women's economic progress. Change the Story is an initiative to align policy, program, and philanthropy to significantly improve women's economic status in Vermont. The initiative has released four status reports Women, Work and Wages in VT, Where VT Women Work...and Why It Matters, Women's Business Ownership and the Vermont Economy, and Vermont Women and Leadership. These reports tell the story of women's economic status in Vermont and are being used to inform policy and campaign goals. Changethestoryvt  Sexual harassment  The VCW has long advocated for better legislation around sexual harassment, as well as better broadcast and recognition of the current laws in Vermont.Christian Avard. \\"Opening eyes to harassment laws.\\" Vermont Guardian (2007):Web. 23 Sep 2009. <>. According to Vermont law, a sexual harassment policy is required of all workplaces and school, and these policies are supposed to be in a visible, accessible place. The VCW has been instrumental in publicizing these policies, and publishes literature on citizen's rights in instances of sexual harassment, the action they can take, and places to find support.State of Vermont. Sexual Harassment in the Workplace: A guide for employees and employers. Montpelier: 2000. Print.  Expressing breastmilk in the workplace  The VCW has advocated for women's rights to pump milk in public places, and has recently been a strong influence in passing legislation that allows women to have time and a place to pump while at work. When compared to the national average, a higher percentage of Vermont women breastfeed; but some women were forced to stop pumping because of their inability to pump at work.Lisa Rathke. \\"Law allows nursing mothers to express breast milk at work.\\" Boston Globe 15/May/2008, Print. The passage of this law required employers to designate a space, and allow time for women to pump.Vermont Workplaces Support Nursing Moms, Vermont Commission on Women, Oct. 2014, https://women.vermont.gov/sites/women/files/pdf/Nursingwebfactsheet.pdf. .  Public education  One of the primary objectives of the Commission is to serve as an educational resource for the public by conducting research, producing publications, and coordinating conferences and workshops utilizing the most current data for people across Vermont. The Commission has published several guides informing Vermonters of their rights on key issues.  Governance  Established in 1964 as the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women, they are one of many state and municipal women's commissions in the United States. In 2002 they were put into Vermont statute and renamed the Vermont Commission on Women. The VCW has a staff of three, but is governed by 16 Commissioners who work in conjunction with an Advisory Council of Vermont organizations to serve the interests of women and girls in Vermont.  Commissioners  Commissioners are appointed volunteers who have experience actively working to reduce discrimination and improve the status of women. The VCW statute indicates that ‚Äúmembers of the commission shall be drawn from throughout the state and from diverse racial, ethnic, religious, age, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic backgrounds, and shall have had experience working toward the improvement of the status of women in society.‚Äù Commissioners bring multiple perspectives to decision-making: as women with family responsibilities, as workers, as employers, and business owners. Eight Commissioner appointments are made by the Governor, three by the Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives, three by the Vermont Senate Committee on Committees, and one by the Democratic and Republican parties each. Commissioners serve four year terms. The Commission is a deliberative body, and decisions are adopted by majority vote.  Advisory Council  The Advisory Council is made up of 27 members whose interests align with the commission's mission to reduce discrimination and improve women's status in Vermont. VCW's Advisory Council members are representatives of 24 organizations whose interests align with the commission's mission, the two Vermont Senators (Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy) and the Vermont Congressional Representative (Peter Welch). Members provide counsel to the Commission on setting goals, strategies and objectives, by sharing the opinions and perspectives of the organizations they represent.

This band also featured Martin Kemp on drums and keyboardist Craig Sue. In 1996 Bionic released two EPs, 'stay'; and 'the stink'. The video for 'stay' was played on rage a number of times. Around 1997, Craig Sue left to concentrate on Killers On The Loose, a rave project he shared with Cain; and Genetic, a solo drum&bass; project. The move forced a lineup change, with Cain moving to keyboards, and new guitarist Cheyne coming aboard. Bionic became WTO (World Trash Orchestra), soon to become GTO (Global Trash Orchestra). 1999 saw GTO release the EP 'Ears Were Made For Bleeding'. It featured the songs 'Danke Shoen' and 'Hatemail', later released as a AA-side single. The EP featured some interesting use of spacer tracks, with the songs appearing on tracks 5, 6, 8, and 9.

To date, they have been praised and heavily featured in the international music press, labelled by Classic Rock Magazine as 'a strong contender for best newcomer at the very, very least' and, additionally, as Progression Magazine‚Äôs selection for \\"debut album of the year\\". To date, the band has released four studio albums, and have assembled a line-up for live performances. Their first and second albums, entitled A Mind's Portrait and The Face of the Unknown respectively, were released through Time Divide Records on 1 May 2009 and 12 October 2010. These were followed by Enigma, released through Nightmare Records on 22 January 2013, and \\"Ephemera\\", released on 1 September 2014. History Origins and A Mind's Portrait (2008‚Äì2010) Aeon Zen was founded in 2008 when Rich Gray and Lloyd Musto decided to form a new studio project. Unlike their previous bands, such as Timefall, which had a one-to-one correlation of members and instruments, Aeon Zen consisted of just the two members, with Musto playing drums and Hinks on all other instruments and production. Vocal duties were, on their debut album, shared amongst guests. According to the band, the name Aeon Zen was chosen to portray an \\"eternal state of bliss and enlightenment\\", although the use of Aeon as an adjective is a non-standard construction. Writing and recording for their first album started in late 2008 and took roughly two months to complete, with both writing and recording occurring simultaneously. Several of the songs on A Mind's Portrait were written several weeks before the album was released, with Gray composing the majority of the material. Following the completion of the album, the band was signed to the record label Time Divide Records Ltd. in November 2008. This signing, and subsequent likelihood of an album release, helped in the conscription of the necessary guest vocalists such as Nils K. Rue of Pagan's Mind and Andi Kravljaca of Silent Call (ex Seventh Wonder), among others. The album was finally released on 1 May 2009. Artwork for the album was designed by Mattias Nor√©n, who had previously undertaken work for groups such as Outworld, Evergrey and Into Eternity, among others. Shortly after the album release, Lloyd Musto left the band to pursue other projects. As of 2009, Rich was working on a 2nd album, as well as putting together a live band and rehearsing with session musicians to tour and play shows. The Face of the Unknown and Live Band (2010‚Äì2013) In July 2010 the band played their first live gig at the Luminaire in London, a performance that was praised for its high fidelity sound but critiqued for the undersized venue. During this time, Gray had been working on a follow-up album and, on 5 August 2010, he announced that The Face of the Unknown would be released on 12 October of the same year under the Time Divide label. Guest vocalists announced included Michael Eriksen (Circus Maximus), Andi Kravljaca (Silent Call), Nick D'Virgilio (Spock's Beard), Jem Godfrey (Frost*) and Jonny Tatum (Eumeria). Artwork for the album was, once again, designed by Mattias Nor√©n. In early 2011 the band announced that they were embarking on a 23-date European tour, spanning the UK, Germany, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands, among others. Enigma (2013‚Äìpresent) After a delay as the band switched labels to Nightmare Records, their third album, Enigma, was released on 22 January 2013. On 20 September 2013, it was announced on Facebook that Shaz left the band. Musical style and critical response Aeon Zen's music has been described as transcending stylistic and generic boundaries, moving from soft to heavy and defying categorization as purely metal, rock, progressive or even classical. A fusion of \\"many stylistic elements\\", Aeon Zen's music, as exhibited on A Mind's Portrait, includes \\"catchy melodies\\", \\"a diverse mix of songs and styles\\", and \\"progressive time changes\\" which \\"run through the gamut of emotions\\". In terms of comparison, many reviewers have noted their affinity with others in the Progressive Metal field, notably Dream Theater, Queensr√øche and Symphony X. The main departure from these groups is in the montage of styles presented on the album. Some reviewers felt that the \\"multiplicity of ideas\\" could be too overbearing for listeners unfamiliar with a new group, or even that such an overloading led to an overall \\"incoherence\\" on the album. Other reviewers felt that, rather than being a sign of weakness, it was a commendable feat to have enlisted the vocal services of so many prominent artists within the field. Nevertheless, the band felt obliged to counter these assertions by stating that the intermixture of styles is exactly the effect that was intended: Furthermore, in a video interview, Rich Gray stated that \\"[on A Mind's Portrait] you even have piano ballads, there's even an orchestral track (mixed in with heavier progressive rock and metal tracks). Vocally, there's everything ranging from operatic power metal style singing, all the way to death metal growling. Nothing is out of the question.\\" However, even those critics who believed the band were yet to find their \\"musical identity\\", praised the album as a bold statement of intent, particularly given the young age of the musicians.

Khaqani and Andronicos Comnenus (PDF) Reign He came to power with intervention of Ildeniz. Once on the throne, Akhsitan restored friendly relationships with the Seljuk Turks and with Georgia. In 1173 he came to the aid of his father-in-law by putting down the Georgian revolt of Prince Demy, aided by his cousin, the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos I Komnenos who often stayed in Shirvan. Although in his early career he had relied on Atabeg Azerbaijan for military assistance, by 1186 he had sensed an opportunity to attack them. This proved ill judged and the Atabeg ruler Qizil Arslan counterattacked capturing most of Shirvan before continuing to overrun the whole Seljuk Empire. A year later, in 1192, Shamakhi was destroyed by a terrible earthquake, and Akhsitan I moved the Shirvan capital to the city of Baku. Raids of Rus' and Kypchak His reign saw raids of Rus' with 73 ships in 1174 which sailed from Volga and threatening shores of river Kura. Meanwhile, a Kypchak horde sacked Derbent and captured Shabran the same year. Akhsitan called his allies Georgia and Byzantine Empire, which proved to be successful as in siege of Derbent. George III subjugated city with aids from Andronikos I Komnenos and turned it over to shah. They also defeated and burned Rus' navy. Family He was married several times, firstly to his cousin - Ismat ad-Din Safvat ad-Din Safvat al- Islam, granddaughter of David IV of Georgia (died in the 1192 earthquake), secondly a daughter of Rusudan.

Currently he has a show on XM Satellite Radio's Willie's Place. Early life Alva Dave Moore who later took the stage name Eddie Kilroy when he was a disc jockey in Houston, was born in Louisiana, and, as he describes his early life, he was \\"surrounded by cowboys\\". Thus by the time he was ten he had decided to make a living as a cowboy, and, with the support of his father, Kilroy successfully took part in youth and high school rodeos, eventually entering the professional circuit. Along with horse riding, Kilroy had picked up some skills with the guitar, and this had led him into song writing and local performances. While in Arkansas, Kilroy decided to make the trip to Nashville in order to give the music business a try. With horses in tow, he unsuccessfully tried pitching his music to Chet Atkins, only to discover that \\"you needed an appointment and they didn't care I had two horses in their parking lot\\". Kilroy noticed that Faron Young's offices were nearby, and thus he made a second attempt. Young was not impressed by the music, but recommended that Kilroy move to Nashville and continue writing, reportedly stating that \\"Every time you write a song, I want you to bring it over here and sing it to me.\\" Although he did not immediately take Young's advice, choosing instead to return to the rodeo circuit, in the early 1960s Kilroy decided to follow Young's suggestion and moved to Nashville in order to pursue a career in the music industry. Career After moving to Nashville, Kilroy gained a position as a producer at Mercury Records. Kilroy's first studio record, produced in 1968, proved to be a hit for Jerry Lee Lewis ‚Äî and made Kilroy the \\"one man responsible\\" for changing the fortunes of Jerry Lee Lewis' flagging career. Kilroy suggested that Lewis record \\"Another Place, Another Time\\" with a more modern country sound, and the record kick-started Lewis's late 1960s career revival. Kilroy also continued with Faron Young's offer, and eventually Young recorded \\"Pen and Paper\\", with music and lyrics by Eddie Kilroy and Diane Blalock Kilroy through Mercury Records. Kilroy was a producer at Westpark Records in the early 1970s, and became president of Playboy Records when he founded the label for Hugh Hefner, for whom he signed Mickey Gilley. He recorded \\"Roomful of Roses\\" in 1974 with Mickey Gilley, and the album became a number one country western hit ‚Äì Gilley went on to create six number one albums with Playboy. From there Kilroy moved to become the co- president of the MCA Nashville Records office. While at MCA Kilroy signed Faron Young to the label and produced two albums with Young: Chapter Two (1979) and Free and Easy (1980). Eddie Kilroy went independent after leaving MCA, and as an independent he produced the last album by Marty Robbins. Awards *2007 Academy of Western Artists Awards, disc jockey, major market.

A regular visitor to Italy since 1983, Johns and her family now live full-time in Tuscany, where she coordinates wine and food workshops in various regions: Tuscany, Emilia-Romagna, Liguria, Campania, Sicily, Veneto, Abruzzo, Apulia, and Piedmont as well as managing an organic olive oil-producing farm and agriturismo (bed & breakfast) in Tuscany. Johns has been featured in Bon Appetit magazine (1996), Food & Wine magazine (Top Ten Cooking Schools in Italy, 2007), and Cooking Light magazine (2009). Wall Street Journal named Pamela one of the top ten culinary guides in Europe, and Poggio Etrusco was in Travel + Leisure July 2011. CNN did a focus on Pamela's Tuscan cooking tours (see CNN.com; search for Tuscan food tour). Johns returns to the US once a year to do cooking classes and lectures about Italian artisanal food. Her audiences have included Smithsonian, IACP conferences, Roundtable for Women in Food Service, The American Institute of Wine & Food, Slow Food, and numerous cooking schools countrywide. In addition to her cookbooks, Pamela is a freelance food writer; her articles/columns have been published in \\"Art of Eating\\", Cuisine magazine, Vinotizie, Santa Barbara News- Press, and she was food editor of Santa Barbara magazine for six years. Before moving to Italy, Johns started and was the leader of the Santa Barbara Convivium of Slow Food. She served as an international juror for Slow Food, a member of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (IACP) and Women for WineSense, and Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust. She has served on the local and National Board of Directors of The American Institute of Wine and Food (AIWF) and the Board of Directors of the Southern California Culinary Guild.

As the name suggests, KBA requires the knowledge of private information of the individual to prove that the person providing the identity information is the owner of the identity. There are two types of KBA: static KBA, which is based on a pre-agreed set of shared secrets, and dynamic KBA, which is based on questions generated from a wider base of personal information.  Static KBA (shared secrets)  Static KBA, also referred to as \\"shared secrets\\" or \\"shared secret questions\\", is commonly used by banks, financial services companies and e-mail providers to prove the identity of the customer before allowing account access or, as a fall-back, if the user forgets their password. At the point of initial contact with a customer, a business using static KBA must collect the information to be shared between the provider and customer‚Äîmost commonly the questions and corresponding answers. This data must then be stored only to be retrieved when the customer comes back to access the account. The weakness of static KBA was demonstrated in an incident in 2008 where unauthorised access was gained to the e-mail account of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. The Yahoo! account's password could be reset using shared secret questions including \\"where did you meet your spouse?\\" along with the date of birth and ZIP code of the former governor to which answers were easily available online. Some identity verification providers have recently introduced secret sounds or pictures in an effort to help secure sites and information. These tactics require the same methods of data storage and retrieval as secret questions.  Dynamic KBA  Dynamic KBA is a high level of authentication that uses knowledge questions to verify each individual identity but does not require the person to have provided the questions and answers beforehand. Questions are compiled from public and private data such as marketing data, credit reports or transaction history. To initiate the process, basic identification factors such as name, address and date of birth must be provided by the consumer and checked with an identity verification service. After the identity is verified, questions are generated in real time from the data records corresponding to the individual identity provided. Typically, the knowledge needed to answer the questions is not available in a person's wallet (some companies call them \\"out-of-wallet questions\\") making it difficult for anyone other than the actual identity owner to know the answer and obtain access to secured information. Generally, the length of time and number of attempts provided to respond are limited to prevent the answers being researched. Dynamic KBA is employed in several different industries to verify the identities of customers as a means of fraud prevention and compliance adherence. Because this type of KBA is not based on an existing relationship with a consumer, it gives businesses a way to have higher identity assurance on customer identity during account origination.

The doctrine of Protestantism from the Reformation until 1930 strongly condemned contraception. Since the 1930 Seventh Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Communion, major Protestant denominations shifted their doctrine to accepting contraception. In general, most liberal Protestants and Anglicans hold relatively settled views that accept the use of contraception, while debate is ongoing among conservative Evangelicals, especially as to which types are and are not acceptable. Others, such as Laestadian Lutheran Churches do not permit the use of birth control. Denominational positions Anglicanism The Church of England has stated in the 1958 Lambeth Conference that the responsibility for deciding upon the number and frequency of children was laid by God upon the consciences of parents 'in such ways as are acceptable to husband and wife'. Lutheranism The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America allows for contraception in the event the potential parents do not intend to care for a child.When a woman and man join their bodies sexually, both should be prepared to provide for a child, should conception occur. When that is not their intention, the responsible use of safe, effective contraceptives is expected of the male and the female. Other Lutheran churches or synods take other positions, or do not take any position at all. For example, in 1990 the Lutheran Churches of the Reformation passed a resolution titled \\"Procreation\\" stating that birth control, in all forms, is sin, although they \\"allow for exegetical differences and exceptional cases (casuistry)\\", for example, when the woman's life is at risk.See http://lutheransandcontraception.blogspot.com/2006/01/gods-word-and- procreation.html . The LCR also notes, > Such was the united teaching of Dr. Martin Luther and the \\"Old Missouri\\" > fathers (C.F.W. Walther, F. Pieper, A.L. Graebner, C.M. Zorn, W.H.T. Dau, > J.T. Mueller, W. Dallman, F. Bente, E.W.A. Koehler, L. Fuerbringer, T. > Engelder, Th. Laetsch, G. Luecke, W.A. Maier, M.J. Naumann, et al.) and LCR > leaders such as P.E. Kretzmann and W.H. McLaughlin. Likewise, the Hausvater Project (not an LCR organization) states, > We therefore find ourselves sympathetic to the long-standing consensus of > Lutheran church fathers from the Reformation through the mid twentieth > century that neither abortion, abortifacient birth control, nor barrier > contraception should be practiced. See http://www.hausvater.org/faqs.php Laestadian Lutheran Churches do not permit the use of birth control.

Religious Support For Family Planning (retrieved 16 May 2007). The United Church of Christ (UCC), a Reformed denomination of the Congregationalist tradition, promotes the distribution of condoms in churches and faith-based educational settings. Michael Shuenemeyer, a UCC minister, has stated that ‚ÄúThe practice of safer sex is a matter of life and death. People of faith make condoms available because we have chosen life so that we and our children may live.‚Äù Anabaptist Churches Mennonites The Mennonite Church USA, the General Conference Mennonite Church, and the Conservative Mennonite Conference have adopted statements indicating approval of modern methods of contraception. For example, while also teaching and encouraging love and acceptance of children, the Conservative Mennonite Conference maintains, \\"The prevention of pregnancy when feasible by birth control with pre-fertilization methods is acceptable.\\" A study published in 1975 found that only 11% of Mennonites believed use of birth control was \\"always wrong\\". Old Colony Mennonites, like the Amish, do not officially allow birth control practices. Amish All types of birth control, including forms of natural family planning such as calendar-based methods, are forbidden in Old Order Amish communities. However, especially in recent years, more Amish women have begun using contraception. This trend is more pronounced in communities where few of the men earn their living through farming. (see p.10 in online version) Hutterites The Hutterite Brethren use contraception only if it is recommended by a physician. History Before the Protestant Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church viewed procreation as the primary purpose of sexual intercourse and unity of spouses. As part of the Reformation, Reformers began to more strongly emphasize the unitive pleasures of marriage. Still, all major early Protestant Reformers, and indeed Protestants in general until the twentieth century, condemned birth control as a contravention of God's procreative purpose for marriage. As scientists advanced birth control methods during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some Protestants continued to reject them, while other Nonconformists welcomed these advances. (Moncure Conway preached on the subject at South Place Chapel in London.) As an example of the dissent, the editor of a Nonconformist weekly journal in the United States wrote in 1893, > There was a time when any idea of voluntary limitation was regarded by pious > people as interfering with Providence. We are beyond that now and have > become capable of recognizing that Providence works through the commonsense > of individual brains. We limit population just as much by deferring marriage > for prudential reasons as by any action that may be taken after it. Non-Catholic denominations were slow to officially go along with such a view, although followers were not as reluctant. 1930 Seventh Lambeth Conference shift Then in 1930, at the Seventh Lambeth Conference, the Anglican Communion, after years of considerable internal debate, issued the first statement permitting birth control \\"when there is a clearly felt moral obligation to limit or avoid parenthood and where there is a morally sound reason for avoiding complete abstinence.\\"No Room For Contraception Lambeth Conferences of the Anglican Church Allan Carlson recounts how this affected the other Protestants: :There was an immediate American Protestant echo. In 1931, the Committee on Home and Marriage of the Federal Council of Churches (an ecumenical body that embraced Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregational, and Church of the Brethren denominations) issued a statement defending family limitation and urging the repeal of laws prohibiting contraceptive education and sales...In the late 1940s, a leading LCMS [Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod ] professor of theology, Alfred Rehwinckel, said that Luther had simply been wrong: the Genesis phrase, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply,‚Äù was merely a blessing, not a command. Such views spread at a still more rapid pace among the Protestant ‚Äúmainline‚Äù churches. Held near the end of the post World War II ‚Äúbaby boom,‚Äù when American family life for a brief period again seemed somewhat healthy, the 1961 North American Conference on Church and Family of the National Council of Churches (successor to the FCC) can only be called extraordinary....Not a single speaker spoke in the spirit of the old Protestant pronatalist ethic. Indeed, this ethic now stood as the chief enemy. The conference endorsed development of a new evangelical sexual ethic, one ‚Äúrelevant to our culture,‚Äù sensitive to the overpopulation crisis, and grounded in modern science. Member denominations soon complied. In a 1970 Report, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) rejected the old ‚Äútaboos and prohibitions‚Äù and gave its blessing to ‚Äúmass contraceptive techniques,‚Äù homosexuality, and low-cost abortion on demand. The same year, the Lutheran Church in America fully embraced contraception and abortion as responsible choices. And in 1977, the United Church of Christ celebrated the terms ‚Äúfreedom,‚Äù ‚Äúsensuousness,‚Äù and ‚Äúandrogyny,‚Äù and declared free access to contraception and abortion as matters of justice.http://bound4life.com/history-of-contraception-in-the-protestant- church/ By 2005 acceptance had increased such that a Harris Interactive poll conducted online among 2,242 U.S. adults found that 88% of non-Catholic Christians who identified as either \\"very religious\\" or Evangelical supported the use of birth control/contraceptives.Harris_poll Protestants Reformers‚Äô views vs. modern Protestant views Highly conservative Protestants such as Mary Pride, Charles D. Provan, Hess and Hess, and Rachel Scott, argue that Protestants should not have moved away from traditional Protestant views of contraception such as given by Martin Luther and John Calvin. Such modern authors contrast the views of early Reformers who rejected contraception with modern Christians who accept it, and point to primarily feminist, secular, or Satanic influences as causative to the change. Provan in his The Bible and Birth Control extensively quotes early Protestant views of birth control, which Provan uses to conclude, > If Martin Luther were alive today, would he not disapprove of many > Christians who view children as a bad thing, and so practice birth control > to prevent God from sending more blessings to them? ... Truly Scriptural > principles do not change at all: therefore Christians should willingly > receive the blessings which God has for us, and not try to prevent them. Reformed scholars such as James B. Jordan, however, maintain that Provan's view has the effect of adding a law to the Bible it does not contain. Jordan states, > Jesus repeatedly denounced the Pharisees for their additions to the Law of > God. Thus, we must be extremely careful about what laws we lay down for > people. Does the Bible clearly state that contraception is sinful, or that > people are obligated to have as many children as possible? If the Bible does > not say these things, we need to fear God and be frightened of adding to His > Word. Jordan argues also that the views of early Protestant Reformers on contraception are unreliable because they were heavily influenced by not just the Bible but Neo-Platonic mysticism (otherworldliness) and Aristolean teleologism (measuring all things only by their result), philosophies they inherited from their Catholic predecessors such as Thomas Aquinas and Augustine of Hippo. Bart Garrett describes it, \\"They operated in a time and context that unhealthily looked at sex as a base, physical pleasure that carried with it spiritual detriments.\\" Jordan further points to the Reformers' unreliability based upon their rejection of Song of Solomon as a description of passionate sexual expression within marriage. He also cites technophobia among Protestants, as evident by their rejection of things ranging from buttons to airplanes (\\"if God meant for man to fly he would have given him wings\\"). As well, Jordan points to what he describes as the Reformers' own mantra, \\"reformed and always reforming\\" (ecclesia reformata est semper reformanda), as evidence that Protestants should not crystallize their position on the matter at some point in the past, and says that rejecting contraceptives based upon their correlative rise alongside feminism exhibits the genetic fallacy. Ongoing debates There are numerous ongoing debates at core of Protestant differences concerning contraceptives. These include whether contraceptive use or non-use is a matter of individual conscience or binding Biblical commands, what types of birth control are permissible if any, and the amount of weight modern Protestants should give early Protestant Reformers' views on contraception. Individual conscience or commandment? The majority of Protestants, irrespective of denomination, maintain that use or non-use of birth control in its various methods is a matter of conscience for individual Christians before God, and that individual couples should be convinced in their own minds of what is and is not permissible for them particularly (see Romans 14). In this view, God has a personal relationship with individual Christians and, because he has given no explicit Biblical commandment against birth control and uses and has even caused and overseen modern technological advancements (see Daniel 12:4), he guides particular couples' birth control practices in accordance with his particular will for their lives. Conservative evangelical leader John F. MacArthur states the view, > Nothing in Scripture prohibits married couples from practicing birth > control, either for a limited time to delay childbearing, or permanently > when they have borne children and determine that their family is complete > ... In our viewpoint, birth control is biblically permissible. At the same > time, couples should not practice birth control if it violates their > consciences (Romans 14:23)‚Äînot because birth control is inherently sinful, > but because it is always wrong to violate the conscience. The answer to a > wrongly informed conscience is not to violate it, but rather to correct and > rightly inform one's conscience with biblical truth. R. Albert Mohler, Jr., the ninth president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky states, > Evangelical couples may, at times, choose to use contraceptives in order to > plan their families and enjoy the pleasures of the marital bed. The couple > must consider all these issues with care, and must be truly open to the gift > of children. The moral justification for using contraceptives must be clear > in the couple's mind, and fully consistent with the couple's Christian > commitments. Additional adherents of this view include Rainey, James Dobson, Jordan, Mohler, and evangelical ethicists Franklin E. Payne and John and Paul Feinberg. Although most Protestants adhere to this view, some such as Rainey may nonetheless advocate for one of the categories he describes, depending upon which Christian values they deem most important. Some Protestants, however, reject the position that contraceptive use is a matter of conscience. Although some Quiverfull adherents accept that birth control use is a matter of individual conscience, other such adherents may argue that the Bible commands their position for all Christians. For example, David Crank, publisher of Unless The Lord Magazine, states, \\"The 'Quiverfull' approach is universal in the sense that it is not something unusual that only a few are called to. Rather it is God's basic design and plan for mankind, and it was the way most of mankind lived most of the time, until the 20th century.\\" Charles D. Provan additionally argues: > \\"Be fruitful and multiply\\" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command > to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this > command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and > multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves > disobedience to the Word of God. Nowhere is this command done away with in > the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid for us today.. Quote and > its chapter available at http://www.jesus-passion.com/contraception.htm Quiverfull authors such as Hess and Hess disagree and say the matter is simply one of clear obedience or disobedience to God's words in the Bible. > \\"Behold, children are a gift of the Lord\\" (Psa. 127:3). Do we really believe > that? If children are a gift from God, let‚Äôs for the sake of argument ask > ourselves what other gift or blessing from God we would reject. Money? Would > we reject great wealth if God gave it? Not likely! How about good health? > Many would say that a man‚Äôs health is his most treasured possession. But > children? Even children given by God? \\"That‚Äôs different!\\" some will plead! > All right, is it different? God states right here in no-nonsense language > that children are gifts. Do we believe His Word to be true? To such statements, Protestants such as Jordan point out that Christians will, in fact, choose against the blessing of money and great wealth. Jordan also maintains that, while children are indeed blessings, they are only one among a wide range of blessings God offers, and prayerfully choosing foci among them is part of prudent Christian stewardship. John Piper's Desiring God ministry further explains, > Scriptures also say that a wife is a gift from the Lord (Proverbs 18:22), > but that doesn't mean that it is wrong to stay single (1 Corinthians 7:8). > Just because something is a gift from the Lord does not mean that it is > wrong to be a steward of when or whether you will come into possession of > it. It is wrong to reason that since A is good and a gift from the Lord, > then we must pursue as much of A as possible. God has made this a world in > which tradeoffs have to be made and we cannot do everything to the fullest > extent. For kingdom purposes, it might be wise not to get married. And for > kingdom purposes, it might be wise to regulate the size of one's family and > to regulate when the new additions to the family will likely arrive. As > Wayne Grudem has said, \\"it is okay to place less emphasis on some good > activities in order to focus on other good activities.\\" ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply‚Äù‚Äîcommand or blessing? Protestants, including Quiverfull adherents, also disagree over whether the Biblical statement \\"be fruitful and multiply\\" in Genesis 1:28 and 9:7 is a command or simply a blessing God spoke over its recipients. Mary Pride and Charles D. Provan see it as a binding command upon married Christians, while Dobson, MacArthur, Jordan, and Raymond C. Van Leeuwen do not see the statement as prohibiting family planning by contraceptive use. The Sin of Onan‚Äîcondemnation of contraceptive use? As part of this debate, Protestants (as well as some Catholics) disagree over the Sin of Onan as found in the Bible verses of Genesis 38:1-10. Protestants within the \\"children in abundance\\" group (see discussion of below) often see Onan's act of coitus interruptus as condemning contraceptive use, while most see Onan's real sin as ongoing rebellion against God, with his failure to fulfill the terms of his Levirate marriage (Yibbum) being his final rebellious act. Which methods are permissible? :Also see: Natural Family Planning, Barrier contraception and Hormonal contraception Protestants who accept that birth control is permissible may disagree over which methods are impermissible. Natural Family Planning only or \\"artificial\\" methods too? In Sam and Bethany Torode's 2002 book, Open Embrace: A Protestant Couple Rethinks Contraception, the young couple argued that only Natural Family Planning was permissible, citing their views borrowed from Catholicism including the Theology of the Body. The couple later accepted barrier methods and stated, > Strict NFP reaches a point where it is more harmful for a marriage than > good. We think that Jesus' words in Luke 11:46 apply: \\"And you experts in > the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can > hardly carry.\\" How is it that spouses are saying \\"yes\\" to the gift of each > other when they end up abstaining for much of their married lives? ... We > also see honest congruity with the language of the body by saying \\"no\\" to > conception with our bodies (via barrier methods or sensual massage) when our > minds and hearts are also saying \\"no\\" to conception. We don‚Äôt believe this > angers God, nor that it leads to the slippery slope of relativism or > divorce. We strongly disagree with the idea that this is a mortal sin. John Piper's Desiring God ministry states of NFP, > Some conclude that \\"natural family planning\\" is acceptable but \\"artificial\\" > means are not. But this seems to overlook something significant: in both > cases, you are still seeking to regulate when you have children. And so if > one concludes that it is wrong to seek to regulate the timing and size of a > family, then it would have to be concluded that natural family planning is > just as wrong as \\"artificial\\" means. But if one concludes that it is > appropriate to steward the timing and size of one's family, then what makes > \\"artificial\\" means wrong but natural family planning right? Surely it is not > because God is \\"more free\\" to overrule our plans with natural family > planning! Perhaps some have concluded that artificial forms are wrong > because they allow one more fully to separate intercourse from the > possibility of procreation. But if it is wrong to have intercourse without a > significant possibility of procreation, then it would also be wrong to have > intercourse during pregnancy or after a woman is past her childbearing > years. There is no reason to conclude that natural family planning is > appropriate but that \\"artificial\\" means are not. In her book, Birth Control for Christians: Making Wise Choices, Jenell Williams Paris, who is associate professor of anthropology at Bethel College in St. Paul, reviews the benefits and uncertainties of various birth control methods, and decidedly favors the Fertility Awareness Method (FAM), which is similar to NFP but is different. (Paris is a FAM instructor.) The main difference is that FAM is not tied to Roman Catholic teaching. Regarding hormonal methods and abortion, Paris explains that both assertions that the hormonal methods are necessarily acting as abortifacients and the counter claim that they never do are impossible to substantiate from data, and that the probability of the hypothesized scenarios are so small such that the collection of data seems infeasible. Hormonal contraceptives Based upon a view that life begins at conception, Protestant author Randy Alcorn rejects all forms of hormonal contraceptives, while James Dobson and obstetrician and minister William R. Cutrer reject only certain forms of them. Dobson and Cutrer view progesterone-only birth control pills as potentially problematic, since they may be potentially abortive contraceptives because of the theoretical possibility that they may have a slight secondary action of preventing a fertilized embryo from implanting within the uterine wall, while Alcorn implicates all hormonal contraceptives as problematic in these regards. Dobson's Focus on the Family states, > Dr. Dobson would emphasize as foundational his strict concurrence with the > biblical teaching that every child is a blessing from God ... While > affirming that human life begins with fertilization (the union of sperm and > egg), his interpretation of Scripture leads him to believe that the > prevention of fertilization is not morally wrong. However, he would oppose > any method of birth control that acts after fertilization and terminates a > conceived human life by preventing its implantation in the womb ... After > two years of extended deliberation and prayer, the PRC has not been able to > reach a consensus as to the likelihood, or even the possibility, that these > medications might contribute to the loss of human life after fertilization. > The majority of the experts to which Dr. Dobson has spoken feel that the > pill does not have an abortifacient effect. A minority of the experts feel > that when conception occurs on the pill, there is enough of a possibility > for an abortifacient effect [with the progesterine-only pill], however > remote, to warrant informing women about it. The American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists, however, argues that it is inappropriate to implicate certain hormonal contraceptives as abortifacient based upon theory only, and points out that no empirical evidence exists to prove any abortifacient action. The organization states, > Is it appropriate to implicate a medication as an abortive agent without the > data to support such a claim? To do so creates needless hostility and > division among physicians and patients who genuinely respect life from the > moment of conception. Where do we draw the line in informed consent for > responsible disclosure of known medical risks vs. a theoretical risk which > is not substantiated by current scientific knowledge? Is it accurate to > implicate all hormonal contraceptive methods as one regarding their method > of action, rather than evaluating each one individually? Current views Author and FamilyLife Today radio host Dennis Rainey suggests four categories as useful in understanding current Protestant views concerning birth control. Christopher G. Ellison and Patricia Goodson use very similar categories in their 1997 study of Protestant seminarians' attitudes on the matter. \\"Children in abundance\\" group The first is the \\"children in abundance\\" group. Protestants within this group believe that birth control is a contravention of God‚Äôs purpose for marriage and that all children conceived during routine sexual intercourse (without regard to time of the month during the ovulation cycle or other matters) should be welcomed as blessings. The Quiverfull movement and its authors such as Mary Pride, Rick and Jan Hess, Charles D. Provan, Nancy Leigh DeMoss, Rachel Giove Scott, and others, predominate this group. Based upon Bible verses that describe God acting to \\"open and close the womb\\" (see Genesis 20:18, 29:31, 30:22; 1 Samuel 1:5-6; Isaiah 66:9), Quiverfull adherents believe that Divine Providence alone should control how many and how often children are conceived and born. Protestants in this group often connect birth control use with modern feminism, an \\"anti- child mentality\\", \\"worldliness\\", and abortion because birth control is used for \\"the same reasons why a woman aborts her child\\". \\"Children in managed abundance\\" group The second is the \\"children in managed abundance\\" group. According to Rainey, Protestants within this group are open to however many children they may conceive during their fertile years yet believe that only Natural Family Planning is acceptable and may use it. A young couple Sam and Bethany Torode advocated for this view in their 2002 book, although they later accepted barrier contraception such as diaphragms and condoms. Denny Kenaston of Charity Christian Fellowship also advocates for this position, as does Presbyterian seminary professor Daniel Doriani. \\"Children in moderation\\" group The third is the \\"children in moderation\\" group. In Rainey‚Äôs view, these Protestants are very pro-child but feel free to use artificial birth control to prudently plan their families. Those within this group see Divine Providence and Biblically required responsibility acting via man's free will as working complementarily. They thus may feel freedom to use non-\\"natural\\" birth control in making personal choices in consultation with God about the number and spacing of children. \\"No children\\" group The fourth group is the \\"no children\\" group. Rainey sees couples in this group as believing they are within their Biblical rights to define their lives around non-natal concerns. While not their main emphasis on the subject, Protestant authors such as Samuel Owen and James B. Jordan support this as an acceptable option, but only when a higher ethical principle intervenes to make child bearing imprudent in comparison, such as health concerns or a calling to serve orphans or as missionaries in a dangerous location, etc. A small activist group, the Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree, argues their position, \\"Jesus loved children but chose to never have any, so that he could devote his life to telling the Good News.\\" Jordan also maintains that modern birth control methods, as well as Natural Family Planning, are acceptable tools of prudent family planning. Jordan also strongly supports the option for couples to have very large families, while Owen believes that non-use of birth control in any form should be normative. Rainey sees infertile couples as falling into this group apart from their choice in the matter. Sterilized couples may as well. According to Southern Baptist R. Albert Mohler, Jr., \\"Couples are not given the option of chosen childlessness in the biblical revelation\\". Sterilization reversals Stemming from ideas from the Quiverfull movement, some Protestants such as Bill Gothard advocate for couples to undergo sterilization reversal surgery, while Brad and Dawn Irons of Blessed Arrows Sterilization Reversal Ministry advocate for Quiverfull ideas while providing funding, physician referrals, and support to Protestants wishing to undergo reversal surgery.

As a former Soviet citizen admitted to the United States under a DPA visa (1949), Fedorenko became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1970. He was discovered in 1977 and denaturalized in 1981. Subsequently, he was extradited to the USSR, sentenced there to death for treason against his nation and participation in the Holocaust, and was executed. War record Fedorenko was born in Dzhankoy in the Sivash region of the Crimea, in southern Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire). He was mobilized into the Soviet Army in June 1941, around the time of the Nazi German Operation Barbarossa. He was a truck driver, and had no previous military training. Within two or three weeks, his group was encircled twice by the German army. He escaped the first time, but he was captured three days later by the Germans and transported to Zhytomyr, then Rivne, and finally to Che≈Çm, Poland. At the Che≈Çm prisoner-of-war camp, German officers from Operation Reinhard arrived one day and recruited 200 to 300 Ukrainians for military training as auxiliary police in the service of Nazi Germany within General Government. They were sent to the Trawniki concentration camp SS training division, and Fedorenko was among them. At Trawniki, he was trained as a Hiwi shooter and was posted to Treblinka extermination camp. Fedorenko became an NCO (Non Commissioned Officer) attaining the rank of Oberwacher and from September 1942 to August 1943, he led a 200-member Ukrainian detachment which shaved, stripped, beat and gassed prisoners brought to Treblinka. Training as the Hiwi shooter Fedorenko was one of approximately 5,000 Trawniki men trained as Holocaust executioners by SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Karl Streibel from Operation Reinhard. The Hiwi shooters, known in German as the Trawnikim√§nner, were deployed to all major killing sites of the Final Solution, augmented by the SS and Schupo, as well as Ordnungspolizei formations. The German Order Police performed roundups inside the Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland shooting everyone unable to move or attempting to flee, while the Trawnikis conducted large-scale civilian massacres in the same locations. It was their primary purpose of training. In the spring of 1942 Fedorenko was deployed from Trawniki to the Lublin Ghetto. It is known from historical record that between mid-March and mid-April 1942 over 30,000 Jews from Lublin Ghetto were transported to their deaths in cattle trucks at the Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp and additional 4,000 at Majdanek.Jack Fischel, The Holocaust, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, pg. 58; in Google Books.Statistical data compiled on the basis of \\"Glossary of 2,077 Jewish towns in Poland\\" by Virtual Shtetl Museum of the History of the Polish Jews as well as \\"Getta ≈ªydowskie,\\" by Gedeon and \\"Ghetto List\\" by Michael Peters. Fedorenko claimed in his postwar hearing that he was issued a rifle which was not fired. From Lublin, he was sent to the Warsaw Ghetto with his Sonderdienst battalion of 80 to 100 executioners. He was dispatched to Treblinka approximately in September 1942. The report of the Soviet Interrogation of Defendant Aleksandr Ivanovich Yeger (born in 1918, Germany), includes the section devoted to Fedorenko's activities at the Treblinka extermination camp in occupied Poland (excerpt). Escape to the United States After the end of the war, Fedorenko abandoned his wife and two children, who remained in the Soviet Union, and spent four years living as a war refugee in West Germany, working for the British from 1945-1949. Fedorenko emigrated to the United States from Hamburg in 1949 and was granted permanent residency status under the Displaced Persons Act. He initially resided in Philadelphia but later settled in Waterbury, Connecticut where he found employment as a brass factory worker. Fedorenko would reside in Waterbury for the next two decades. While Fedorenko's life in the United States was quiet, he had been identified as a possible war criminal. Treblinka survivors identified him as a guard at the camp from a collection of photographs and documents that had been captured from the SS. In the mid-sixties his name and Waterbury, Connecticut address were included on a list of fifty-nine war criminals living in America. The list was compiled in Europe and Israel and forwarded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in the United States. He was granted U.S. citizenship in 1970, however and later retired to Miami Beach, Florida in 1973. In the mid-70s, Congressional Representatives Joshua Eilberg and Elizabeth Holtzman initiated a set of hearings that led the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) to investigate the handling of possible Nazi war criminal data. No mishandling was found, but as a result, a Special Litigation Unit for the investigation of Nazi war criminals was established in the INS. The information supplied in the sixties was now put to use. In 1977, the INS supplied information on Fedorenko to Justice Department prosecutors. In 2005, a Russian documentary Secrets of the Century - Punishers: May 9th () reported that in 1974 Fedorenko visited Crimea as a tourist, where he was recognised and this raised the interest of the KGB. Afterwards, the Soviet government contacted the White House and requested that the case of Fedorenko be reviewed.–¢–∞–π–Ω—ã –í–µ–∫–∞ - –ö–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏: –î–µ–≤—è—Ç–æ–µ –ú–∞—è (–§–∏–ª—å–º –æ—Ç ASHPIDYTU –≤ 2006) Denaturalization trial and extradition In 1978, he was arrested and brought for a denaturalization trial in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. At his subsequent denaturalization hearing in June 1978, Fedorenko testified over three days in greater detail. He denied that he had actually entered the section of the camp where the gas chambers were located but admitted that he had once been posted on a guard tower overlooking this section of the camp. \\"I saw how they were loading up dead people, loading them on the stretchers. ...And they were loading them in a hole.\\" Later in his testimony, he reconfirmed that this part of the camp \\"is where there was the workers that took the bodies and buried them or stacked them in the holes. This is where the gas chambers were.\\" Concerning the unloading of Jews from the trains, he testified: \\"Some were picked for work and the others, they went to the gas chambers\\".Christopher R. Browning, \\"Evidence for the Implementation of the Final Solution.\\" Emory University 2013. Judge Norman C. Roettger said that the 71-year-old had himself been a \\"victim of Nazi aggression.\\" He ruled that the prosecutors had failed to prove that Fedorenko committed any atrocities while at the camp, and that he could keep his United States citizenship. However, on January 21, 1981, the United States Supreme Court overturned this verdict\\"Death camp guard stripped of citizenship\\", Montreal Gazette, January 22, 1981, p69 and in December 1984 Fedorenko became the first Nazi war criminal to be deported to the Soviet Union.\\"Nazi death camp guard deported to Soviet Union\\", Gettysburg Times, December 24, 1984, p1 In Punishers: May 9th, it was claimed that he was not detained by the KGB upon arrival and spent weeks drinking in his native Dzhankoy, walking free until his arrest in January 1985 after a report titled \\"Nazi Fedorenko feels free in USSR\\" was reportedly published in The Washington Post. The Crimean Regional Court in 19 June 1986, after nine days of open proceedings, found him guilty of treason and taking part in mass executions, sentencing him to death. In Punishers, it was reported that a tearful Fedorenko said \\"I didn't want this\\" in his last statement, although he displayed a lack of emotion upon the reading of the final verdict. A subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court of the USSR was rejected. His execution by shooting was announced in late July 1987.WILLIAM J.

Early life and career Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1881, Child went to Harvard University and Law School where he graduated in 1906 to become a business lawyer. Child founded the Progressive Republican League in Massachusetts, a forerunner of the Progressive Party. During World War I, he worked first as a correspondent in Europe and Russia, then for the U.S. Treasury, writing propaganda. In 1916 he published a book, calling for U.S. investment in Russia. After the war he became editor of Collier's Weekly (1919). In 1919 and 1920, Francis X. Bushman and Beverly Bayne successfully toured the play The Master Thief, based on a story by Child.Staff, ‚Äú‚ÄòThe Master Thief‚Äô,‚Äù Riverside Daily Press, Riverside, California, Saturday evening, 13 December 1919, Volume XXXIV, Number 269, page 8. In 1920 he wrote campaign material for Presidential candidate Warren G. Harding, who rewarded him with the ambassadorship in Italy (from May 1921 to February 1924), where among other diplomatic activities he encouraged Benito Mussolini to start his March on Rome, as he records in his memoir A Diplomat looks at Europe (1925). He also promoted U.S. investment in Italy under Mussolini, especially from the J. P. Morgan bank. After his return to the United States, he became editor for The Saturday Evening Post and served on the National Crime Commission in 1925. In 1926 he divorced. In 1928 he became a paid propaganda writer for Benito Mussolini, whose notes he ghostwrote and serialized as My Autobiography in The Saturday Evening Post, and whose politics he praised in numerous articles for the Hearst press. Together with Thomas W. Lamont he rates as one of the most influential American promoters of Italian Fascism until his death in 1935. Child also wrote a number of crime stories and promotional tracts throughout his career. His Paymaster stories, in which his anti-hero - a criminal dubbed ‚Äúthe Paymaster‚Äù - regularly outwitted his opponents, including the police, and other more dangerous villains, were widely known in the first decades of the 20th century.Flom, Eric L., ‚ÄúSilent Film Stars on the Stages of Seattle: A History of Performances by Hollywood Notables,‚Äù McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina, 2009, , pages 155-156.https://books.google.com/books?id=FRUhxhNTZngC&pg;=PA155&lpg;=PA155&dq;=the+master+thief+richard+washburn+child&source;=bl&ots;=CHvBZLaul-&sig;=ACfU3U071S2TZ86-5jcuqiFX775Oi9TQTQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwil9a_kuebmAhXLTN8KHaZeAxIQ6AEwDnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q;=the%20master%20thief%20richard%20washburn%20child&f;=false Child was a critic of spiritualism and skeptical of paranormal claims.

Life Born about 1590, he was goldsmith in Foster Lane, London. At one time Arthur thought of taking holy orders, but was dissuaded by his relative Nicholas Ferrar. It was he who arranged the 1625 purchase of Little Gidding by Mary Ferrar, mother of Nicholas, and supervised the restoration of the neighbouring church at Leighton Bromswold, to which Ferrar's friend George Herbert had been presented in 1626. He was a correspondent of Ferrar's sister Susanna Collett, and a close friend of Herbert. He witnessed Mrs Ferrar's will in 1628, was present at Herbert's death in 1633, and was executor of his will. He was also well known to Izaak Walton, whom he supplied with details of Herbert's life. It was probably through Sir John Danvers that Wodenoth became interested in the Virginia Company. He was not a member till some time after 1612, but he took an active part in the affairs of the company till the revocation of its charter, siding, like Ferrar, with the party of Sir Edwin Sandys against that of Sir Thomas Smith. In 1644 he was deputy governor of the Somers Islands Company, and before his death he drew up a Short Collection of the most Remarkable Passages from the Originall to the Dissolution of the Virginia Company, London, 1651; it is in the main a defence of Sandys, Ferrar, and Danvers. Wodenoth was dead before the publication, and in the preface is said to have been a parliamentarian. Family He was descended from the Wodenoths or Woodnoths of Savington, Cheshire. He was second son of John Wodenoth of Savington, by his second wife, Jane, daughter of John Touchet of Whitley. Mary Wodenoth, the mother of Nicholas Ferrar, was his father's sister; and his father's brother Thomas, who settled at Linkinhorne, Cornwall, and spelled the name Wodenote, was father of Theophilus Wodenote.

Trade verification is carried out on the institutional side of the market between the investment manager and the broker/dealer. This process ensures that the parties are in agreement about the essential trade details. The three key steps in the verification process that Karat created are: # Notice of execution by the broker/dealer. ‚ÄúCONFIRMATION‚Äù # Affirmation or Rejection by the client of the transaction details. ‚ÄúAFFIRMATION‚Äù or \\"REJECTION\\" # Transmission of allocation details by the investment manager (the splits). ‚ÄúALLOCATION‚Äù The trade verification process concludes when the affirmation/allocation has been completed and then the clearing and settlement process begins, which also involves custodians, central securities depositories (CSDs), and other participants in the post-trading value chain. SDA leaves more time for the clearing and settlement processes within the intended settlement period, which in most markets means on the second day after trade execution (known as \\"T+2\\"). A market where SDA is the standard is also referred to as a \\"trade- date environment\\". This is seen as a critical enabler to achieving shortened settlement cycles, an objective the European Commission is driving through its Central Securities Depositories Regulation, and about which the United States has begun discussions as well, propelled in part by research commissioned by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation in 2012. Automated trade verification Manual trade verification‚Äîlocal matching Under manual verification, the allocation, confirmation and affirmation procedures are conducted sequentially between the investment manager and broker/dealer. There is no involvement of any further intermediary and communication is usually via telephone, fax or email. With manual trade the counterparties respond to each other‚Äôs messages and the relevant data needs to be checked and re-keyed manually. There is a strict sequence of steps; each party must wait for the other to complete its actions before proceeding. Only once all the steps in the trade verification process are completed will the settlement instructions be sent and the next stages of post-trade processing begin. Automated trade verification‚Äîlocal matching The verification process can be automated in full or in part. For example, where confirmation/affirmation is automated but allocation instructions are sent by fax or email. The process is locally matched and is conducted directly between the broker/dealer and the investment manager through an electronic system also known as an electronic trade confirmation ETC system, which can be either provided by third-party vendors or developed by the parties themselves. Automated trade verification‚Äîcentral matching Under central matching models, the process is fully automated and centralized using a central matching utility, which is usually provided by third-party vendors. Unlike the local matching models, where trade verification is conducted bilaterally and relies on traditional message flows in which trade information is provided in a set order, thus adding time to trade settlement, central matching allows investment managers and broker/dealers to input the data independently and separately into the centralized matching utility, where the information is then centrally validated and matched. Automation of the trade verification process The trade verification process can range from fully manual procedures that follow a strict sequencing of steps to full automation where trade details are centrally matched and validated and the processes do not necessarily happen sequentially. In practice, where the investment manager is not automated, broker/dealers will often not wait for the affirmation from the investment manager before notifying their settlement agents and submitting their settlement instructions. In this case, settlement instructions are sent on the basis of trade details that have not been affirmed and thus risk being incorrect. SDA is unlikely under manual processes because there will be time lags and delays to completion of trade verification beyond the trade date, especially for significant trade volumes and where there are resource constraints. At the other end of the spectrum, central matching removes much of the sequentially in the trade verification process because the counterparties involved input the relevant data independently and separately. The information is then validated and matched centrally and to a large extent synchronously. When the details match, settlement instructions are automatically sent to custodians and settlement agents. What is more, the counterparties receive updates on the status of trades processed through the system, with errors (and the need to take corrective action) being indicated if trades do not match. Automation as a precondition for achieving same-day affirmation The verification of the trade details between investment manager and broker/dealer is a key activity along the trading and post-trade process, taking place after the trade is executed and before it can be cleared and settled. Automated trade verification (using electronic systems to match the trade details either locally or centrally) provides a means to achieve timely trade verification. Automation assists timely completion of the process for the bulk of the trades that can be sent straight through for settlement, allowing resources to be focused on those trades where manual intervention is required to rectify any errors identified. While automation does not guarantee SDA for all trades, it is a precondition for achieving high rates of SDA. Benefits of automated SDA process Direct benefits SDA leads to settlement efficiency: Settlement efficiency in countries with SDA rates of over 90 percent‚ÄîIndia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and Korea‚Äîis 26 percent higher than in countries with SDA scores of less than 70 percent‚ÄîBrazil, Italy, South Africa and the United States. Automation of the trade verification process can deliver SDA through improved trade processing times and eliminate errors inherent in manual processing by removing the requirement to send information back and forth manually between broker/dealer and investment manager. This translates into benefits in the form of a reduction in operational risk and trade failure rates for a given level of operating costs, and a reduction in operating costs for a given risk and failure rate. Risk reduction and improved settlement performance Reduced risk through better accuracy in the trade verification process ‚Äî the adoption of automated SDA processes reduces the rate at which trade fails occur and mitigates the costs associated with these fails. It does this by making it easier for the investment manager or broker/dealer to identify errors or mismatches in the trade details which, if not corrected up front, could result in the trade failing to settle on time. Furthermore, compared to manual processing, automation will reduce the likelihood of new errors being introduced during the post-trade processes. Operating cost efficiencies Estimates show that failed trades put as much as US$976 billion in equity transactions and $308 billion in fixed income transactions at risk annually. A reduction in the risk of trade fails implies less time spent on preventing or following up potential or actual fails. Fewer fails mean fewer costs downstream in record-keeping, reconciliations of settlement instructions, corporate actions, claims-handling and other functions required to resolve fails. Therefore, some of the operating cost efficiencies will be passed along the value chain and benefit other parties, not just the investment manager and broker/dealer. Indirect benefits In addition to the direct benefits of risk and cost reductions, automated SDA processes can generate indirect benefits. These relate to better management of information, increased transparency, and improved monitoring of own positions and performance as well as counterparty performance. Furthermore, it provides a key step towards achieving full straight-through processing (STP) of trades from order to settlement, with additional risk and cost reduction implications. Improved information If the relevant data is confirmed/affirmed and available on the trade date, records and accounts are more likely to be accurate, and valuations can be conducted in a more effective and timely manner. Increased transparency and improved monitoring Transparency is improved because the information on trades arrives at one point of entry and is electronically stored, which means that it can be more readily accessed and tracked than communications by email, fax or telephone. The electronic storage of relevant trade information, including the history of a trade such as any actions taken by the counterparties to rectify unmatched trades, is likely to improve transparency in the process by leaving an audit trail. It also allows individual firms to track and measure their operational performance and trade processing efficiency such as average response times for allocations, confirmations and affirmations. Enables straight-through processing (STP) Automation of this part of the process provides a bridge between the front and back office, and so can be considered as one of the necessary measures to move towards straight-through processing. Market-wide adoption of automated SDA processes and the wider benefits The risk reductions and cost efficiencies that can be realized by an individual firm are likely to be more feasible with a market-wide move towards automation and SDA as best operational practice, because this will go further to shorten and harmonize the settlement process. Both sides (investment managers and broker/dealers) benefit from the adoption of automation of their counterparts. For example, broker/dealers need their existing (as well as potential) clients to adopt automation in order to reorganize their activities in such a way that fully captures the benefits of automation. If some existing (or potential) clients do not adopt automation, the brokerage firm will still have to organize its operations in order to meet the requirements of its non- automated clients. At present, many investment managers and broker/dealers that have switched to an automated solution find it difficult to benefit from it fully due to the lack of automation of their counterparties. The risk reductions and cost efficiencies that can be realized at individual or bilateral level would therefore be likely to deliver greater overall benefits if more, and ideally all, firms in a given market were to adopt automated processes based on standardized or interoperable systems. The degree to which firms in a market use automated trade verification and achieve SDA has further implications in terms of the market-wide benefits that can be realized. In fact, some potential benefits can be extracted only if there is a market-wide move towards automated SDA (at least within that market). In some instances, automation and the move towards SDA as best operational practice delivers most benefits if it is adopted not just by most firms within a country, but across the whole relevant economic region. For example, harmonization of settlement practices between EU countries can arguably be achieved more easily in an environment where firms in individual countries have adopted more consistent and efficient verification processes. Benefits for end investors From a wider perspective, these benefits from reductions in the risks and costs borne by investment managers and broker/dealers (or other intermediaries), once these benefits have been realised by a significant part of the market, would be passed through and be reflected in lower prices, resulting in lower transaction costs for end investors and producing associated beneficial effects on liquidity and operation of markets.

Facts Mrs Archibald was employed as a road sweeper for Fife Council. She had surgery in 1999. Sadly there were complications. She lost the ability to walk and could no longer work. The council kept her as an office worker. She was placed on the shortlist for all upcoming vacancies. As Baroness Hale said in her statement of the facts, Mrs Archibald argued at the employment tribunal that her dismissal was unlawful under s 4(2) DDA 1995 for discrimination in failing in their duty to make reasonable adjustments (s 6) and causing her substantial disadvantage, particularly the requirement for competitive interviews. The employment tribunal held that the council's treatment was justified under s 5(1)(b) DDA 1995. The request that competitive interviews be removed would have been too favourable, contrary to s 6(7). Both the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Inner House of the Court of Session dismissed her appeals. Judgment The House of Lords allowed Mrs Archibald's appeal. It held that under s 5 DDA 1995, no finding may be made that less favourable treatment is justified unless the duty to make reasonable adjustments is taken into account. The employer must have made reasonable adjustments, and only then can it be asked whether less favourable treatment (in this case, not hiring Mrs Archibald in the office) is justified. Accordingly, under s 6(3)(c), the duty to make reasonable adjustments included transferring an employee to \\"fill an existing vacancy\\" and this can include the possibility that a disabled person be placed at the same or higher grade without any competitive interview if that is reasonable under the circumstances. Such favourable treatment was not at all precluded by s 6(7), which should be read subject to the previous provisions of the section. Furthermore, the duty under the DDA 1995 to make reasonable adjustments overrode the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 s 7 requiring that staff be appointed by merit. In conclusion, the tribunal had never considered whether the council had fulfilled its s 6 duty, and that the case should be remitted to determine that question.

The thermodynamic square (also known as the thermodynamic wheel, Guggenheim scheme or Born square) is a mnemonic diagram attributed to Max Born and used to help determine thermodynamic relations. Born presented the thermodynamic square in a 1929 lecture. The symmetry of thermodynamics appears in a paper by F.O. Koenig. The corners represent common conjugate variables while the sides represent thermodynamic potentials. The placement and relation among the variables serves as a key to recall the relations they constitute. A mnemonic used by students to remember the Maxwell relations (in thermodynamics) is \\"Good Physicists Have Studied Under Very Fine Teachers\\", which helps them remember the order of the variables in the square, in clockwise direction. Another mnemonic used here is \\"Valid Facts and Theoretical Understanding Generate Solutions to Hard Problems\\", which gives the letter in the normal left-to-right writing direction. Both times A has to be identified with F, another common symbol for Helmholtz' Free Energy. To prevent the need for this switch the following mnemonic is also widely used:\\"Good Physicists Have Studied Under Very Ambitious Teachers\\"; another one is Good Physicists Have SUVAT, in reference to the equations of motion. One other useful variation of the mnemonic when the symbol E is used for internal energy instead of U is the following: \\"Some Hard Problems Go To Finish Very Easy\\". Use The thermodynamic square is mostly used to compute the derivative of any thermodynamic potential of interest. Suppose for example one desires to compute the derivative of the internal energy U. The following procedure should be considered: # Place oneself in the thermodynamic potential of interest, namely (G, H, U, F). In our example, that would be U. # The two opposite corners of the potential of interest represent the coefficients of the overall result. If the coefficient lies on the left hand side of the square, a negative sign should be added. In our example, an intermediate result would be dU = - p [\\\\text{Differential}] + T [\\\\text{Differential}]. # In the opposite corner of each coefficient, you will find the associated differential. In our example, the opposite corner to p would be V (Volume) and the opposite corner for T would be S (Entropy). In our example, an interim result would be: dU=-pdV+TdS. Notice that the sign convention will affect only the coefficients and NOT the differentials. # Finally, always add \\\\mu dN, where \\\\mu denotes the Chemical potential. Therefore, we would have: dU=-pdV+TdS+\\\\mu dN. The Gibbs‚ÄìDuhem equation can be derived by using this technique. Notice though that the final addition of the differential of the chemical potential has to be generalized. The thermodynamic square can also be used to find the Maxwell relations. Looking at the four corners of the square and making a \\\\sqcup shape, one can find \\\\left ({\\\\partial S\\\\over\\\\partial p} \\\\right)_T =-\\\\left ({\\\\partial V\\\\over\\\\partial T} \\\\right)_p. By rotating the \\\\sqcup shape (randomly, for example by 90 degrees counterclockwise into a \\\\sqsupset shape) other relations such as: \\\\left ({\\\\partial p\\\\over\\\\partial T} \\\\right)_V = \\\\left ({\\\\partial S\\\\over\\\\partial V} \\\\right)_T can be found. The rule regarding the Maxwell relations is that whenever s and p appear on the same side you introduce a - sign. Finally, the potential at the center of each side is a natural function of the variables at the corner of that side. So, G is a natural function of p and T, and U is a natural function of S and V.

On June 19, 2009, the Dallas City Council approved an ordinance to authorize the sale of $514 million in Build America Bonds to finance the construction of the hotel, which was built to generate revenue for the adjacent Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center. Groundbreaking occurred on September 15, 2009. The building was topped out on October 21, 2010. The hotel formally opened on November 11, 2011. Description The building is notable for its LED lighting on the exterior facade. The building is covered in more than 2,200 protective tubes, each of which houses three 3-foot-long LED fixtures. Altogether, the strips measure about 4 miles long. The LEDs are occasionally programmed to display dynamic lighting patterns - from a Jawbreaker maze to advertisements for the Dallas Cowboys. The lights are programmed to run during two intervals, once from sunset to 2 a.m. and again from 5:30 a.m. to sunrise. The colors and lighting are sometimes coordinated with the lighting of the nearby Bank of America Plaza.

The castle is located in the forest of the same name between the towns of Varsseveld and Doetinchem, about 5 kilometers from the latter. Slangenburg Castle was constructed in the Late Medieval period. In the 17th century the castle became the property of General Frederik Johan van Baer, also known as General Slangenburg, who rebuilt it for residential purposes. The last private owners were a German family called Passmann, who are buried in a private cemetery next to the moat. After the World War II all German properties were confiscated by the Dutch government, who thus acquired the castle, which, with the surrounding terrain and the buildings within the outer moat, now forms part of the portfolio of the Rijksgebouwendienst (\\"Royal Buildings Service\\"), while the surrounding area falls under the care of the Dutch environmental agency, the Staatsbosbeheer. At present the castle is used as a guesthouse by the nearby Benedictine monastery, St. Willibrord's Abbey (Sint-Willibrordabdij), a newly built structure of the 1950s situated on a part of the castle's former estate. The original monastic community, from Oosterhout Abbey, was initially accommodated in the castle itself in the years immediately following the war. The estate and the monastery chapel are open to the public. The estate, roughly trapezoid in shape, features a system of lanes which is centuries old.

Dorothy Eug√©nie Brett (10 November 1883 ‚Äì 27 August 1977) was a British painter, remembered as much for her social life as for her art. Born into an aristocratic British family, she lived a sheltered early life. During her student years at the Slade School of Art, she associated with Dora Carrington, Barbara Hiles and the Bloomsbury group. Among the people she met was novelist D.H. Lawrence, and it was at his invitation that she moved to Taos, New Mexico in 1924. She remained there for the rest of her life, becoming an American citizen in 1938. Her work can be found in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington D.C., in the Millicent Rogers Museum and the Harwood Museum of Art, both in Taos. Also at the New Mexico Museum of Art, Santa Fe, the Roswell Museum and Art Center, Roswell, New Mexico and in many private collections. Early life in the UK Dorothy Brett and her sister had an extremely sheltered childhood (Dorothy not becoming aware of the facts of life until she was 30 years old). Their father, Reginald Baliol Brett (from 1899 Viscount Esher), was a Liberal Party politician who became influential at the court of Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, where the girls attended dancing classes with Princess Beatrice's children, overseen by the Queen. The family lived near Windsor and had homes in London and at Callander in Perthshire, Scotland, where Dorothy spent days fishing in the River Teith and nearby Loch Lubnaig.Hignett, p. 36 Dorothy recounted in later life that a friend of her father (apparently Lewis Harcourt, later Viscount Harcourt) attempted to sexually assault her when aged about 14‚Äì15, an experience to which she attributed her later fear and distrust of men.Hignett, p.30-1 However, as noted by a New Mexico historian, a childhood experience may have influenced her decision to see the American West: \\"In her childhood, the girl attended the touring Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. She was thrilled to view a stagecoach chased around the arena by an Indian war party dressed in feathered head gear. Her fascination with American Indians, beginning that day, never left her.\\" In 1910 Dorothy enrolled at the Slade School of Art where she studied until 1916, and began to be known by her surname only. Along with other female art students, especially Dora Carrington and Barbara Hiles, she had her hair cut short (for the time) in a style that led Virginia Woolf to call them 'cropheads'. Through fellow student Mark Gertler, she met Lady Ottoline Morrell and began mixing in an artistic and literary circle that included Clive Bell, Bertrand Russell, D.H. Lawrence,Hignett, p.72-77 Virginia Woolf, Augustus John, Aldous Huxley, Gilbert Cannan, and George Bernard Shaw.Petteys, p. ? Her sister Sylvia became Ranee of Sarawak. After visiting Taos for the first time in 1923 at the invitation of Mabel Dodge Luhan and then returning to London, D.H. Lawrence held a dinner party at the Cafe Royal (which he called \\"The Last Supper\\"). There he tried to recruit friends to move to Taos in order \\"to create a utopian society he called 'Rananim'\\",Maurer on unm.ed an idea which he had first proposed in a letter of 3 January 1915.Bachrach, p. 39 While almost all who attended had \\"agreed to follow Lawrence to New Mexico....when it came to the actual packing for departure, there was only one recruit ‚Äì the Honorable Dorothy Brett\\".Bachrach, p. 37 Editor and book designer Merle Armitage wrote a book about this time in New Mexico. Taos Quartet in Three Movements was originally to appear in Flair Magazine, but the magazine folded before its publication. This short work describes the tumultuous relationship of D.H. Lawrence, his wife Frieda, Dorothy Brett and Mabel Dodge Sterne, a wealthy patron of the arts. Armitage took it upon himself to print 16 hardcover copies of this work for his friends. Richard Pousette-Dart executed the drawings for Taos Quartet that was published in 1950. Life in New Mexico after 1924 In March 1924 Lawrence, Frieda Lawrence, and Brett arrived in Taos and stayed with Luhan. Initially, they all got along well, \\"but tensions gradually built... (and) Mabel, in a burst of generosity (and probably to keep Lawrence in Taos) offered Lawrence a tract of 160 acres on her ranch\\" located some twenty miles North-West of Taos.Bachrach, pp. 42 ‚Äì 43 The Lawrences first named it the \\"Lobo Ranch\\" and then the \\"Kiowa Ranch\\",Bachrach, p. 45 ‚Äì 46 while today it has been known as the D.H. Lawrence Ranch ever since it was acquired by the University of New Mexico in the 1950s. Lawrence refused Luhan's offer, but it was accepted by Frieda and the deed was in her name. After some renovations, the trio settled at the ranch in May/June 1924 and Brett took the smaller of the two cabins on the property. She spent much of her time there painting \\"or she would assist Lawrence by typing his manuscripts,\\" among which were St Mawr and The Woman who Rode Away. Among Brett's accomplishments when living with the Lawrences were her \\"exceptional.. handyman skills, including carpentry\\", but \\"the three women ‚Äî Frieda, Mabel and Brett ‚Äî competed for D.H. Lawrence's attention (and) the rivals often got along fairly well with one another, but sometimes not\\".Simmons, \\"Commune's free spirit...\\" Early in 1926 Brett and the Lawrences met again on Capri. From there D.H. Lawrence and Brett travelled to Ravello, where they stayed together for ten days, while Frieda remained on Capri.Piero Nardi: La Vita di D.H. Lawrence, Milan 1947, pp. 679 After the Lawrences left New Mexico in 1925 and his death in 1930, Simmons notes that: She became a United States citizen in 1938. In later life she became admired as one of the leading personalities of Taos. Living alone in her small home outside of town, she was fawned on by the Taos elite during infrequent visits to town. She knew Navajo artist R.C. Gorman, whose art she helped exhibit in the 1960s.http://www.harwoodmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/109 He painted a portrait of her in 1973.http://collections.harwoodmuseum.org/view/objects/asitem/People@1615/3/title- asc?t:state:flow=5996268f-6824-42a8-9eac-f14850648273 Depictions Penelope Keith portrayed Brett in the 1981 film Priest of Love which told the story of Lawrence's last years in New Mexico.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082940/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast Notes References *Bachrach, Arthur J., D.H.

Due to his impressive aviation experience and solid Republican credentials he is most recognized for the years in which he served as administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, having been appointed by President Ronald Reagan. During his tenure as FAA Administrator, Helms originated and oversaw development of the 1982 National Airspace System (NAS) Plan; he headed the US delegation to the United Nations emergency session following the Soviet Union‚Äôs shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 and played a key role in the August 3, 1981 Air traffic Control Strike that resulted in the termination of over 11,000 air traffic controllers. History Personal life Helms was born in De Queen, Arkansas on March 1, 1925. In 1946 he married Lorraine Bisgard, who remained his wife for the rest of his 65 years. They had four children together, two girls and two boys. One of their sons, Jon L. Helms II, predeceased his father in 1987. Military service Helms began his aviation career when he joined the US Navy Aviation Cadet training program while at the University of Oklahoma, early in 1942. On completion of the program he was commissioned as a second lieutenant, US Marine Corps, remaining in the service as a regular officer after the end of WW-II. Subsequent service included postings to Japan, China, Korea and various aircraft carriers, and other military assignments. He became a US Navy test pilot on graduation from the US Navy Test Pilot School, was awarded the US Marine Corps Air Medal, and the USAF Air Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster for Combat and Exceptional Service during the Korean War. He subsequently retired from the Marine Corps in 1956 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Career in the aerospace industry After leaving the Marine Corps, Helms initially worked as a design engineer for North American Aviation, with subsequent positions of sales manager, and director of plans and programs. In 1963 he joined the Bendix Corporation, holding successive positions as Systems Division general manager, group manager, and group vice president, aerospace. In that latter position he directed the Launch Support Division, that prepared all lunar and orbiter flights from Cape Kennedy. He also personally directed the Systems Division in designing, assembling, packaging and installing the ALSEP (Apollo Lunar Scientific Exploration Package) for Apollo astronauts to leave on the moon on the first lunar landing. In 1970 he accepted the position of president, Norden Division, United Aircraft Corporation. In 1974 he was elected president and CEO of Piper Aircraft Corporation, later being named chairman of the board. In 1975 he negotiated with the Vice President of Brazil to construct a factory and build Piper general aviation aircraft in Brazil. He joined the vice president in early 1978 to accept the first airplane off the production line at the new facility, Embraer, in San Jose Dos Compos, Brazil. In 1977 Helms landed the first private airplane in Warsaw, Poland. Following subsequent visits he negotiated an agreement with Pezetel, the Polish National Aircraft Co., to build Piper aircraft, the first general aviation aircraft built behind the iron curtain. Government service In 1980 he retired from Piper, and subsequently accepted a role in laying out the National Aviation Program for the incoming Reagan Administration. He was nominated by President Reagan for the office of Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, and confirmed by the US Senate. He would later resign in 1983 over a grand jury investigation of illegal business activities. In 1981 he headed the US delegation to London for Bi-Lateral Technical and Operating Procedures with the UK. Then, in 1982, he led the delegation for review of International Civil Air discussions for the Western Mediterranean, which included North African and Southern European countries. Also that year Helms was named Special Ambassador to deliver thanks to the King of Morocco, and individual recognition awards to each crew member of the two Air Morocco aircraft that flew into Tehran, to recover US hostages. Helms is acknowledged as the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of the National Airspace Systems Plan (NAS Plan). In that effort he personally directed the evaluation of US aviation systems capability, and outlined a concept for air traffic control and attendant scheduling proficiency for aircraft collision avoidance. Helms personally originated the concept to remove mid-air collision avoidance from ground control, and place it into aircraft. His program resulted in TCAS, (Traffic Collision and Avoidance System), initially mandatory for US carriers, and subsequently adopted by international aviation. For this accomplishment Helms was nominated for The Collier Trophy. He also initiated the National Airspace Review, to develop methods and procedures for improved safety and operational efficiency in use of all national airspace. In 1983 Helms was selected by the President to head the US delegation to the United Nations, ICAO emergency convening which followed the downing of Korean Airlines Flight 007 by the Soviet Union. That year he also headed the US delegation to the UK for Bi-Lateral Aviation and Airworthiness technical and operational review in London. In 1984 Helms represented the US at the Trans-European conference on Air Carrier Tariffs in Prague, and later that year chaired the US Team for Air Traffic Control and Technology in Moscow for the US‚ÄìUSSR conference directed to the 21st century. That year he was also selected as recipient of the Smithsonian Institution- residenced Glen L. Gilbert trophy. Contribution to aviation education Helms lectured numerous times at various U. S. Government educational institutions on the subject of ‚ÄúPlanning and Control‚Äù. In addition to The War College, Helms holds the invited lecturer record, at seventeen years, and was named Honorary Professor, National War College. In 1982 Helms was selected by The Royal Aeronautical Society, approved by the Queen, to be the American chosen to deliver the Annual Wright Brothers Lecture, at the Royal Academy Awards assembly in London. In 1984 he was awarded a Doctoris Honoris in Aviation Sciences, for his personal development of a new curriculum introduced at the University of Illinois, now offered by over three dozen Colleges and Universities, which reflected the President‚Äôs call for increased emphasis on science, math and technical education. He was also awarded the annual Alpha Eta Rho award, ‚Äúfor outstanding contributions to Aviation education.‚Äù Awards and achievements Helms was affiliated with and a member of numerous national and international organizations and entities. He was: * a fellow in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics * a trustee of the USAF Flight Test Museum * a life member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots * a member of Tau Beta Pi Engineering Society * an honorary in the Air Traffic Control Association * co-founder of the J. Lynn Helms Aviation Science Scholarship Fund, University of Illinois * a retired member of the Wings Club of New York City In 1978 he was named General Aviation Man of the Year, and in 1979 was named chairman of the General Aviation Manufacturer's Association. In 1980, The Society of Experimental Test Pilots selected him for the General James H. Doolittle award and trophy. In 1982 he was named PenJerDel Man of the Year in International Aviation, and also that year was selected as the first recipient of the Gen. Pete R. Quesada award for Excellence in Management. The same year he was awarded a Doctorate Honoris in Aviation Management for development of the National Airspace Systems Plan (NAS Plan).

History This elegant wall conceals an antique central vacuum inlet (small dark circle in baseboard next to doorway, c.1918) Antique central vacuum inlet located in a dining room at Ch√¢teau Dufresne (Canadian Register of Historic Places, c. 1918) 19th century The first introduction of a system similar to a central vacuum cleaner was in the late 19th century. A ducted machine that featured copper tubes connected from a bellows chamber, typically located in the basement, and extended to several locations throughout a building, was used in a select few homes at this time. Because of the machine‚Äôs cost and weak dust-removal capabilities, only a few of these units were ever sold in the United States. In 1869 Ives McGaffey patented the first portable vacuum cleaner, or ‚Äúsweeping machine‚Äù. The portable vacuum cleaner is the parent product to the modern central vacuum system. 20th century In the 1930s, the development of small, powerful electric motors increased the popularity and availability of the portable vacuum cleaner, and further diverted consumers from purchasing central cleaners. By the early 1960s, the invention of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) thinwall vacuum tubing made the central vacuum system more affordable in the United States. Previously, more-expensive metal tubing was used exclusively, and it may still be used for part or all of an installation, if required by building fire code regulations. In the 1990s, central vacuum systems gained popularity among real estate agents and home remodelers for the value they added to homes at resale. Allergists also played an important role in the growing popularity of central vacuum systems in the 1990s. Health benefits With central vacuum systems that exhaust completely out of the home, no dust or allergens can be recirculated through the interior air, as is the case with a traditional vacuum. A 2001 study at University of California at Davis showed improvements in multiple aspects of health in 25 individuals with a documented history of type I hypersensitivity to house dust. Each of these individuals used either a Beam Central Vacuum System or their own conventional vacuum for a period of 3 months. At the end of this period, the individual switched over to the opposite limb of the study for 3 additional months. Interestingly, in all seven domains of the evaluation, including activity, sleep, non-nasal symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotions, use of the central vacuum proved to be superior. Central vacuum installations can earn points for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) home certification, Health House certification by the American Lung Association, or the National Green Building Standard of the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB). Operation To use a central vacuum, the vacuum hose is removed from storage and fitted with any needed cleaning accessories (such as a brush). The other end of the hose is inserted into a wall-mounted vacuum inlet, after opening the spring-loaded cover door. In some designs, opening the door switches on the vacuum motor; in other designs, insertion of the metallic hose-end fitting bridges two electrical contacts, signaling the motor to turn on. Other alternative designs feature a remote on/off switch located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, which communicates either via a pair of wires embedded in the hose, or via wireless signaling. When a hose is inserted into an inlet, or the switch on a hose is turned on, two low-voltage electrical contacts (highlighted in red) are bridged, signalling the power unit to turn on Vacuuming is performed in the same manner as with a portable machine. Sometimes, the higher vacuum power of central vacuum may require reduction (for example, when cleaning a delicate sheer fabric curtain). Excess vacuum is \\"bled off\\" by partially opening a bleed port or slot to let some intake air bypass the cleaning tool. The bleed port is usually located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, to allow quick adjustment during use. When cleaning is complete, the vacuum hose is removed from the wall inlet (which snaps shut and shuts down the vacuum motor). The hose is coiled up and hung on a storage rack, and any cleaning accessories are stowed away. Dirt separation Central vacuum power unit, with gray utility inlet valve visible at upper right (Sweden) Cyclonic and filtered central vacuum systems are the two main types of central vacuums, differentiated by the method used to separate dirt and dust from the incoming airstream. True cyclonic cleaners do not use filtration bags, instead separating the dirt and dust into a detachable cylindrical collection vessel or bin. Air and dust are sucked at high speed into the collection vessel at a direction tangential to the vessel wall, creating a fast-spinning vortex. Roughly speaking, the dust particles and other debris spiral outward to the wall of the vessel by centrifugal force, where they fall due to gravity into the bottom of the collection bin. For a more complete technical description of this process, see the article on \\"Cyclonic separation\\". In fixed-installation central vacuum cleaners, the cleaned air may be exhausted directly outside without need for further filtration. A well-designed cyclonic separation system does not lose suction power due to airflow restriction, until the collection vessel is almost full. This is in marked contrast to filter bag systems, which gradually lose suction as pores in the filter become clogged by collected dirt and dust. Filtered systems use a wide variety of different bags or filters that must be cleaned (permanent cloth bags) or replaced (disposable paper bags) on a regular basis. Filters can be made from screening, foam, paper, or cloth, and are usually proprietary designs that may not be widely available. Over time, repeated purchase of filters and bags can become significant ongoing expenses. Bag breakage is an issue that arises with filtered central vacuums. In a portable vacuum, if the filter bag fails, this condition becomes immediately obvious as a cloud of dust and dirt blows into the room. Although it creates a mess, at least the problem can be immediately brought under control by shutting off the appliance. By contrast, if the filter bag in a central unit should fail, little change may be noticed by the remote operator. In fact, the only perceivable change may be an increase in suction power as a clogged but broken bag is completely bypassed. If the filtered air is also used to cool the motor (a very typical design), the first clue that something is amiss may be when the motor completely seizes up due to dirt accumulating in the motor brushes, windings, or bearings. Such a failure can require complete replacement of the expensive central unit. Filterless central vacuums are completely immune to such failures. In addition, the best designs in either system incorporate so-called \\"bypass cooling\\", using a completely separate source of ambient air to cool the motor, rather than the design expedient of using just-filtered dirty airflow for this vital function. Hybrid cyclonic filtered systems have been made, which use a rudimentary cyclonic motion to separate out larger dirt particles, but rely on conventional filter bags to trap remaining finer particles. True cyclonic systems are very effective in removing all but the finest particles, which are then exhausted directly outside, completely eliminating the need for replaceable filters and their consequent airflow restrictions. The exhaust from a good quality true cyclonic system does not contain any visible large particles, and contains far less debris than a typical clothes dryer exhaust. Tools and accessories Central vacuum cleaning tools and hose (partially covered by a protective gray \\"hose sock\\") Baseboard-level vacuum dustpan inlet (Israel) Central vacuums can be equipped with either an electrical power brush or an air-driven power brush. The air-driven (or turbine) systems are frequently less expensive since they do not require electrical wires for power to be run to each wall inlet. Turbine-driven brushes tend to be louder than electric brushes; the noise from either is more noticeable in the absence of the \\"vacuum whine\\" produced by a portable vacuum. Many users find that the high suction of central vacuums is more than sufficient by itself for most casual cleaning jobs, but reserve a powered brush tool for more difficult tasks. The average standard central vacuum system is equipped with a 30 foot (9 m) hose, plus standard cleaning tools similar to those used with portable vacuum cleaners. For further convenience, some owners will keep a hose and set of tools on each floor of a multi-story building. When not in use, the hose is loosely coiled around a wire rack mounted on a closet wall, or on the back of a door. An alternative for storing vacuum hose is the \\"Hide-A-Hose\\" system, which uses suction to draw the hose into the vacuum tubing in the wall for storage. Hose lengths used are typically 30/40/50 ft (9/12/15 m). Successful installation of such systems requires special fittings, and careful design and workmanship, to ensure smooth hose retraction into the tubing for storage. A scaled-down 10-foot (3 m) version (such as \\"Spot by Vroom\\") is available for quick cleaning in locations such as mud rooms and laundry rooms. The original \\"Vroom\\" system, which is still available, uses suction to operate a cabinet- mounted hose reel with a 24 ft (7.3 m) hose, rather than storing the hose within the wall tubing. A modular vacuum hose called \\"QuickClick\\" is available in 10/15/20 foot (3/4.5/6 m) lengths, allowing a custom-length hose to be quickly set up or taken apart by an end user. In addition, a promotional article in a trade magazine says that arthritic testers were able to connect and disconnect the hose in spite of their disability. Automatic dustpans (e.g. \\"Vacpan\\" or \\"KickSweep\\") can be installed in the kickspace under a kitchen, bathroom, or workroom countertop, enabling a person to use a standard broom to sweep debris directly into a vacuum inlet located there. Alternatively, a \\"DrawerVac\\" inlet which pulls out like a drawer from the underside of a table or counter can be used to dispose of debris from a shop or kitchen work surface. The \\"VacnSeal\\" is an accessory intended to be installed on the underside of a kitchen cabinet, over a countertop used for food preparation. The nozzle of the device is used to evacuate excess air from a zipper lock plastic food storage bag (e.g. Ziploc), which is said by the manufacturer to preserve food freshness for a longer period of time. Advantages Central vacuum exhaust on building exterior (Norway) * Increased suction power ‚Äî Because the vacuum cleaner motor and dirt collection system need not be portable, the weight and size of the unit are not as severely limited compared to a portable system; some units even use two motors for extra power. In addition, bagless filterless systems avoid the inevitable loss of suction in filtered systems caused by collected dust clogging the filters. * Ability to handle \\"difficult\\" debris ‚Äî Central vacuums, especially filterless models, can efficiently remove difficult dry substances, such as plaster dust, spilled flour, laser printer toner, metal knockout slugs, and wire clippings from electrical work, or even small pieces and slivers of broken glass. This ability may depend on the ability of the filter bag to resist clogging or breakage; filterless models are capable of removing the widest range of materials. \\"Wet vacuum interceptor\\" accessories are available for some systems; these operate by separating liquids from the dirty airstream prior to passage into the in-wall tubing and central unit. These \\"wet vac\\" units are subject to the same limitations as \\"wet-or-dry shop vacuums\\", and must be washed out and dried after use to prevent unpleasant odors and mold growth. However, toxic materials, such as asbestos should never be cleaned up with anything but specialized equipment made expressly for the purpose. * Complete removal of allergens and noxious odors ‚Äî Central vacuums generally do not recirculate exhaust air back into the space being cleaned. This contrasts with the well-known acrid \\"vacuum smell\\" of fine dust and hot air exhausted from a portable vacuum. Instead, central vacuums exhaust spent air into a utility space, or directly outdoors. An external exhaust outlet can be easily concealed under a porch or behind shrubbery, but in any case is less obtrusive than a standard clothes dryer appliance vent. * Low acoustic noise ‚Äî Well- designed central vacuums are very quiet at the point of use, since the powerful motor is located remotely in a utility space. This is a benefit to the person vacuuming, as well as anybody else occupying the space being cleaned, who otherwise might be woken up or driven out by the loud whine of a portable machine. * Convenient cleaning ‚Äî Setup, use, and storage of a vacuum hose and cleaning tool can be quick and efficient. Cleaning stairways is much easier without having to balance a heavy, hot appliance on each step, and coping with both an electrical cord and a vacuum hose. * Infrequent emptying ‚Äî Central vacuums can usually accumulate up to 10 kg (22 pounds) or more of dirt and dust before requiring disposal. This is an unavoidable dirty process that must be performed for any vacuum cleaner, but can be done much less frequently, perhaps a few times per year. Disposable filter bag systems are easy to empty, though care must be taken to refit the replacement bag to allow maximum airflow without leaks. Emptying the dust canister of a cyclonic vacuum is best done outdoors on a breezy day because of the fine dust cloud that can be released. * Low consumables cost ‚Äî For filterless systems, there are no ongoing costs, other than occasionally replacing a worn-out motor brush or vacuum hose. * Compatible with standard tools and accessories ‚Äî Most central vacuum hoses are compatible with a wide range of industry standard brushes and tools used with ordinary portable vacuum cleaners. In the United States, the de facto standard size is 1-1/4 inch (3.175 cm) inside diameter for tools. For some accessories, it may actually be necessary to \\"bleed off\\" excessive suction, usually by partially opening a small bleed port on the side of the vacuum hose handle, provided for that purpose. * Reduced damage and wear to furniture and walls ‚Äî There is no heavy or awkward canister or other motorized unit to carry from room to room when vacuuming. Only a lightweight vacuum hose and the cleaning tool being used need to be carried. To further reduce wear to furniture feet and projecting baseboard corners, a soft woven \\"hose sock\\" can be installed over the corrugated vacuum hose. * Durable equipment ‚Äî Good- quality central vacuum systems can last indefinitely, perhaps requiring replacement of the motor brushes once per decade of use. Besides using heavy- duty components, central vacuums avoid the damage caused by accidental dropping or collisions of portable equipment with fixed objects. Many manufacturers give a \\"Lifetime Limited Warranty\\" on all permanently installed components of a central vacuum system. Disadvantages The chief disadvantage of central vacuums is higher initial cost. In the United States, the average central vacuum system has an installed cost of around $1,000. This initial expense must be weighed against the long-term benefits of a central vacuum, including the typical longer service life of the equipment, and negligible consumables cost if a filterless system is chosen. A central vacuum system is generally considered by building owners a permanent fixture of the building where it is installed, similar to plumbing and electrical fixtures. A short-term renter would most likely lose any investment made in improving the property, unless a prior agreement was made with the property owner. Installation of a quality central vacuum increases the property value of a residence or commercial property. Maintenance In-wall vacuum inlet valve; Central power unit; Bagless dirt collection canister and auxiliary filter (click on photo to enlarge) Central vacuum systems require periodic emptying of the dirt canister or replacing the filter bag, typically 2‚Äì4 times per year. In some models, it is also important that the filters be changed frequently, especially for designs where the just-filtered air passes through the motor for cooling. For filtered systems, the bag may need to be replaced long before it is filled to its nominal capacity, because of reduced suction due to clogging with dirt or fine dust. Filterless cyclonic separation systems only require emptying the dirt collection container before the suction drops off as an almost-full condition is reached. Many cyclonic vacuum systems now feature translucent dirt collection canisters, allowing quick inspection without removing the canister. Regardless of which dirt separation system is used, the electric motor may require lubrication of its bearings, or replacement of carbon brushes on an infrequent basis, usually measured in years. Rarely, a central vacuum system may become clogged, especially if the tubing was improperly installed, or if the system is abused by vacuuming sticky substances (such as paint or glue or wet foodstuffs). A homeowner can usually use simple tools and techniques to locate and remove the obstruction, or can hire a professional vacuum installer to do repairs. The flexible hose is often the location of a blockage, which can usually be dislodged by using a plumber's snake. Installation This central vacuum power unit has been installed high on a basement wall to reduce risk of damage from flooding, but requiring a ladder for maintenance. A principal concern when designing a central vacuum system is avoiding situations likely to cause clogging of the tubing with debris such as toothpicks, hairpins, needles, or similar-shaped objects. The most important safeguard is at the vacuum inlets, which are intentionally designed with a tighter radius of curvature than any other bends in the system. This is done to ensure that if any vacuumed debris becomes stuck, it will jam right at the inlet, where it is easiest to discover and to remove. Well-designed central vacuum tubing rarely or never clogs unless severely abused (e.g. vacuuming wet plaster, wet flour, or other sticky substances). The wall inlets are connected to the power unit by tubes that can be run inside walls, or through vertical pipe chases, closets, the attic, basement, or the cold air return ducts (if permitted by building code). In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a \\"rough-in\\" phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, HVAC, electrical, etc.), and just before drywall, paneling, or other surface finishes are installed. Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed before cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing. In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete. Vacuum tubing systems may be installed by electricians, plumbers, specialized contractors, or even do-it-yourself (DIY) homeowners. Retrofitting of vacuum tubing in existing structures can be surprisingly straight forward or more difficult, depending on the anatomy of the building. A home remodeling project can generate large amounts of irritating plaster dust and other demolition and construction dirt. Installing a central vacuum early in the project makes ongoing cleanup much easier, especially if it is a filterless true cyclonic unit, which can inhale even abrasive or sharp construction debris without concerns about bag clogging or breakage. Metal floor inlets are used in locations in existing structures where it would be impossible or impractical to install standard wall inlets A typical house requires 2‚Äì4 inlets per floor, although many users find the central vacuum so convenient that they later install additional inlets in the basement, attic, garage, and even on the back porch (for vacuuming car interiors, storage sheds, etc.). A rough rule of thumb is one inlet per of floor area. Inlets should be placed in convenient locations unlikely to be blocked by open doors or furniture, such as in central hallways. A non-stretchable cord of appropriate length (or a thin wire on an architectural scale drawing) can be used to check for adequate reach of a vacuum hose. Routing and design of vacuum tubing layout is very similar to drain-waste-vent (DWV) plumbing, with the exception that pipe pitch or gradient for drainage is not required. Vacuum system designs share with DWV designs a concern about eliminating internal roughness, ridges, burrs, sharp turns, pockets, or other obstructions to smooth flow that might cause build-up of material into pipe blockages. Tubing for central vacuums has a few peculiar constraints of its own, and a few unusual capabilities, such as the ability to run a pipe straight upwards after a sufficiently long horizontal \\"running start\\". In some jurisdictions, fire code regulations require that an intumescent firestop collar be installed around the pipe when it penetrates a firewall. If a pipe runs through an unheated space, it may require external pipe insulation to prevent water vapor from condensing inside. These and other installation details are described in installation manuals available from manufacturers. Two different diameters of thinwall (typically 20 gauge or \\"Schedule 20\\") plastic tubing have traditionally been used in the US. For years, HP Vacuflo advocated the slightly smaller tubing size (outside diameter), claiming that their studies showed that it was less likely to clog. However, that manufacturer has also switched to the de facto industry standard size of outside diameter tubing and corresponding fittings. In most cases, the end user need not be aware of the tubing size in a central vacuum system, but the tubing size must be considered when extending, modifying, or repairing a system. Size adapters have been made to allow interconnection of the two sizes when necessary. Another tubing option, which is becoming popular in commercial applications and with DIYer's, is \\"Schedule 40\\" standard 2-inch plumbing pipe. The main advantage of plumbing pipe is widespread availability, slightly larger diameter, and thicker walls. The thicker material increases durability and ruggedness in installations where pipe runs are exposed to mechanical damage or abuse (although this has rarely been reported as a problem with thinwall tubing). The primary disadvantage is that the thicker material makes pipe less flexible, heavier, and somewhat more difficult to work with. The thicker pipe walls increase the outside diameter of the pipe to , requiring fittings designed for this. To use plumbing pipe for central vacuum installation, special adapters (available from many central vacuum retailers) are required to connect the plumbing pipe to the central vacuum inlets and power unit. Occasionally, the owner of a new house under construction may choose to preinstall vacuum tubing and control wiring in the walls, but to defer purchase of the central unit, hose, and tools to reduce cash flow requirements. Installing tubing and wiring for a central vacuum in new construction is definitely much easier if done before the drywall and other wall finishes. The short-term cost savings of deferring full system completion should be weighed against the great convenience of having a functional vacuum system, especially during the commissioning and move-in period, which generate more than the usual amount of debris to be cleaned up.

Davies AM, Cllrs Cook, Parry, Ireland, Hudson, Morgan, Joyce and RREEL. The Council's report written by the Chief School's Officer, Chris Jones, stated that the majority of responses received have expressed support for a new high school to serve the East of Cardiff with the main objections being to the location of the new school. The Council concluded their case by stressing that their plans involved far more than educational changes, and stating their plans would transform the communities of Llanrumney and Rumney. Closure The school remained open for a period, in part due to the cancellation of the \\"Rumney Rec\\" proposals. The school eventually closed at the end of the 2013 summer term, with all students being transferred to Rumney High School, which was renamed Eastern High School in September 2013.

A trammel of Archimedes is a mechanism that generates the shape of an ellipse. () It consists of two shuttles which are confined (\\"trammelled\\") to perpendicular channels or rails and a rod which is attached to the shuttles by pivots at fixed positions along the rod. As the shuttles move back and forth, each along its channel, all points on the rod move in elliptical paths. The motion of the rod is termed elliptical motion. The semi-axes a and b of the ellipses have lengths equal to the distances from the point on the rod to each of the two pivots. The straight lines described by the pivots are special cases of an ellipse, where the length of one axis is twice the distance between the pivots and that of the other is zero. All points on a circle with a diameter defined by the two pivots reciprocate in such straight lines. This circle corresponds to the smaller circle in a Tusi couple. The point midway between the pivots orbits in a circle around the point where the channels cross. This circle is also a special case of an ellipse. Here the axes are of equal length. The diameter of the circle is equal to the distance between the pivots. The direction of travel around the orbit is opposite to the sense of rotation of the trammel. Thus, if a crank centred on the crossing point of the channels is used to engage the trammel at the midway point to drive it, the rotation of the crankpin and the trammel are equal and opposite, which in practical applications results in extra friction and accelerated wear. This is compounded by high forces owing to the short throw of the crank of only 1/4 the travel of the pivots. An ellipsograph is a trammel of Archimedes intended to draw, cut, or machine ellipses, e.g. in wood or other sheet materials. An ellipsograph has the appropriate instrument (pencil, knife, router, etc.) attached to the rod. Usually the distances a and b are adjustable, so that the size and shape of the ellipse can be varied. The history of such ellipsographs is not certain, but they are believed to date back to Proclus and perhaps even to the time of Archimedes. Wooden versions of the trammel of Archimedes have been produced also as toys or novelty items, and sold under the name of Kentucky do-nothings, nothing grinders, do nothing machines, smoke grinders, or bullshit grinders. In these toys the drafting instrument is replaced by a crank handle, and the position of the sliding shuttles is usually fixed.  Mathematics  Let C be the outer end of the rod, and A, B be the pivots of the sliders. Let p and q be the distances from A to B and B to C, respectively. Let us assume that sliders A and B move along the y and x coordinate axes, respectively. When the rod makes an angle Œ∏ with the x-axis, the coordinates of point C are given by :x = (p+q) \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\, :y = q \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\, These are in the form of the standard parametric equations for an ellipse in canonical position. The further equation :\\\\frac{x^2}{(p+q)^2}+ \\\\frac{y^2}{q^2}= 1 is immediate as well. The trammel of Archimedes is an example of a four-bar linkage with two sliders and two pivots, and is special case of the more general oblique trammel. The axes constraining the pivots do not have to be perpendicular and the points A, B and C can form a triangle. The resulting locus of C is still an ellipse.

The QX80 shares a platform with the Y62 series Nissan Patrol, a full-size SUV also known as the Nissan Armada in North America.  First generation (JA60; 2004‚Äì2010)  2006 Infiniti QX56 (China) 2008 QX56 The Infiniti QX56 (JA60) was a full-size sport utility vehicle (SUV) sold under the Nissan-owned Infiniti luxury brand. It was based on the Nissan Armada full-size SUV, and shared the F-Alpha platform with the Nissan Titan pickup truck. The QX56 was unique to the United States, Canada, Russia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. It was also the first Infiniti built in the United States. Development on the Infiniti JA60 began in early 2000 alongside the Nissan WA60. A final design by Masato Takahashi was reached in early 2001, with an August 2001 design freeze for early 2004 start of production. The rear door handles were installed on the \\"C\\" pillar as a Nissan design tradition started with the 1986 Nissan Pathfinder. When the four-door Nissan Pathfinder was introduced, Nissan chose to conceal the door handles as a part of the \\"C\\" pillar trim to visually make it appear like a two-door truck with a camper shell, with conventional door handles on the front doors. The JA60 was propelled by a 5.6 L VK56DE V8 engine ( at 4,900 rpm and torque at 3,600 rpm) and a 5-speed automatic transmission with an overdrive. As is common with aluminum blocks, each cylinder in the engine was lined with cast iron. The valvetrain was a DOHC design with four valves per cylinder. Infiniti designed the QX56's throttle responsiveness to correspond to specific drivetrain modes: when the driver selects all-wheel drive, the throttle becomes less sensitive, presumably to allow easier regulation of acceleration when off-road. The Infiniti QX56 had around 9,000 lb (4082 kg) of towing capacity. Mileage at peak performance drain is . It comes in one trim level, with only key options such as: DVD entertainment system, 4WD/2WD, and a bench instead of captain chairs as the second row. Other features which came standard were a ten-speaker Bose system, DVD-based navigation system, leather trim for all seats, dual-climate control, 18-inch chrome alloy wheels, and an adaptive cruise control system. A Precrash system was a unique feature in the market as well. Since the demise of the Q45 (which was priced above the QX56) after 2006, the QX56 was the most expensive Infiniti sold in North America, and was Infiniti's only full-size vehicle. In early 2007 for the 2008 model year, the Infiniti QX56 received a minor facelift which included a revised grille, a redesigned interior and new intelligent key system, more standard equipment and standard 20-inch chrome wheels. Introduced at the 2007 NAIAS in January 2007, the facelifted model went on sale in April 2007. In 2008 the QX56 received updates to the braking system. For 2009 the QX56 received auto locking doors and deep garnet metallic was added as a new color. For 2010 the MSRP was increased by $1000, 4WD versions now cost $60,000 and some colors were deleted. After the 2010 model year the QX56 and Armada would no longer share the same platform, as the F-Alpha-based Armada continued to be produced in the United States for the 2011 model year, while next generation QX56 switched to the platform used by the Nissan Patrol.  Second generation (Z62; 2010‚Äìpresent)   Development  Z62 development began in 2006 following the concurrent Y62 program (since 2003), after Nissan management voted to move QX56 production back to Japan and separate from the Nissan Armada, after the JA60's production run concluded. By 2007, a styling proposal by Shinya Momokawa and Akihiro Sugita was approved by the board and frozen for production. In September 2009, spy photography of a 2011 QX56 (Z62) prototype, at a Las Vegas Infiniti national dealer conference, were published online.  2011‚Äì2013 (QX56)  2012 Infiniti QX56 (US) On 31 March 2010, Infiniti debuted the 2011 QX56 at the New York International Auto Show. No longer sharing a platform with the F-Alpha-based Nissan Armada, the QX56 was now a luxury version of the Nissan Patrol, which also marked the first time that a Patrol-based vehicle had been sold in North America since 1969. The QX56 features a new 5.6L VK56VD V8 engine with direct injection and VVEL variable valve timing, also found in the Nissan Patrol, which is rated at and 413 lb¬∑ft (560 N¬∑m) of torque. The more powerful engine helps give the QX an increased towing capacity of up to . The engine is tied to a seven-speed sequential-shift automatic transmission with an all-new 4WD system. Compared to its predecessor, the new QX is 1.4 inches longer, 1.1 inches wider. Most of the frame's body mass is made from high-tensile steel, but the QX manages to be more rugged with its body-on-frame concept and it shares the same platform as the Nissan Patrol. Both the front and rear feature independent suspension double wishbone suspensions combined with the new Hydraulic Body Motion Control System. The QX comes standard with 20-inch wheels with 22-inch wheels available. 4WD versions have a four-setting terrain control which include rock, snow, sand and dirt modes. This generation abandoned the disguised rear door handles that were installed in the \\"C\\" pillar, a tradition started with the 1985 Nissan Pathfinder five-door, as the first generation QX was based on the second generation Pathfinder. This generation's appearance is more in line with other large luxury SUVs like the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, Lexus LX, Land Rover Range Rover, Cadillac Escalade, and Lincoln Navigator. The QX's interior design includes a number of the standard and optional luxury features in the 2010 Infiniti M, such as semi-aniline leather seats, tri-zone climate control, a Bose 2-channel, 13-speaker Premium Audio surround sound stereo system with hard drive memory storage, hard-drive based navigation system, XM satellite radio with NavTraffic is standard, a power liftgate/tailgate, and Infiniti Intuitive Park Assist, a parking assist feature which uses the around view monitor. Other features include climate-controlled front and rear seats, streaming audio via Bluetooth wireless technology, a center console, power sliding rear seats, power third row seats, and a 7-inch DVD rear-seat entertainment system. Curtain Vent, new for this generation, directs air flow from the air conditioning system from above each side window down towards the floor. A new Around View Monitor system uses a camera mounted on the grill, giving a 180-degree view in front, and another camera mounted on the passenger side of the vehicle's side mirror helps eliminate blind spots on the side at low speeds, such as when in parking lots or on off-road adventures. The QX also features the updated Infiniti hard drive based navigation system with an eight-inch VGA display. Infiniti keyless SmartAccess with an \\"Intelligent Remote\\" key is standard along with 8 airbags including knee airbags for driver and front passenger as well as second-row side torso airbags, the Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) is standard, while the Pre-Collision System (PCS),Vehicle Dynamic Control (Electronic stability control) systems and lane departure warning system are available options.  First QX80 Facelift (2014-2017)  Infiniti QX80 In 2013 for the 2014 model year, Infiniti renamed their entire product line, so the QX56 was rebadged as the QX80 in April 2014. Coinciding with the renaming, the QX80 arrived at the New York International Auto Show with a mid-generational refresh, receiving new headlights and taillights with new front and rear fascias, restyled bi-xenon HID projector headlamps with LED daytime running lights, front LED turn signals (located on front bumper with new LED fog lights), new wheel designs (including a new 22-inch forged-aluminum version), three new exterior colors, and a number of interior refinements for the 2015 model year. The new flagship trim level for 2015 is the QX80 Limited which features all the QX80 packages and optional equipment that is available on other QX80 trim levels, while its standard on the new QX80 Limited trim level, standard Intelligent All Wheel Drive (AWD), and restyled LED clear lens taillights instead of the LED red lens taillights, however the QX80 Limited trim level is not available with the second row bench seating which increases the passenger capability from 7 seats to 8 seats. It will still be offered with the same 5.6-liter VK56VD V8 engine. Naoyuki Ohkoshi was responsible for exterior design work on the facelift QX80 in 2012. As of 2017, the Infiniti QX80 is available in the United States (including all US territories), Canada, Mexico, China (including Macau and Hong Kong, excluding Taiwan), the GCC markets, Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, South Korea, Dominican Republic, Guam, Panama, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. An RHD version became in some markets as part of the facelift in late 2014. In late 2016, the 2017 Nissan Armada was released and it switched from the F-Alpha to the Nissan Patrol platform, so the Armada is once again a mechanical twin of the QX80 (formerly QX56) since the 2010 model years. It has been noted that the top trims of the Armada and QX80 have nearly identical interiors despite the MSRP differential; $61,435 for Armada Platinum versus $89,845 for a fully equipped QX80.  Second QX80 Facelift (2017-Present)  Infiniti QX80 Rear View The QX80 Monograph Concept was a design study that previewed a significant second facelift to QX80 for the 2018 model year, launched in December 2017. It retained its 5.6 liter V8 engine and basic architecture. The QX80 Monograph was unveiled at the 2017 New York International Auto Show. The revised QX80 debuted at the Dubai International Motor Show, on 14 November 2017. The facelift has redesigned grille, hood, new LED headlamps, and Full LED taillamps with bumper-installed rear turn signal lights which previously appeared on the 1st generation Infiniti QX50.  Sales  In 2011 sales have been successful, with the new QX80 outselling Infiniti's other SUVs, the crossovers QX50 and QX70, as well as its Japanese full-size body-on-frame rival Lexus LX.

Previously he was considered a pioneer in the field of regenerative medicine using both biological and synthetic scaffolds seeded with patients' own stem cells as trachea transplants, and he was a visiting researcher on a temporary contract at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden from 2010. Macchiarini has been accused of research misconduct and unethically performing experimental surgeries, even on relatively healthy patients. Seven of the eight patients who received one of his synthetic trachea transplants have died. Also, an article in Vanity Fair suggested that Macchiarini had falsified some of his academic credentials on r√©sum√©s. Similar accusations have been published in the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet according to which Macchiarini's claim to have been a professor at universities in Hannover and Barcelona has turned out to be false. The secretary of the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, , resigned in February 2016, owing to his involvement in recruiting Macchiarini to Karolinska Institutet in 2010. Shortly afterwards the vice chancellor, , who in 2015 had cleared Macchiarini of scientific misconduct, also resigned. In 2013 Karolinska terminated its clinical relationship with Macchiarini but allowed him to continue as a researcher; in February 2016 Karolinska announced that it would not renew Macchiarini's research contract, which was due to expire in November, and the next month Karolinska terminated the contract. After being dismissed from Karolinska, he worked at the Kazan (Volga region) Federal University in Russia, until the university terminated his project in April 2017, effectively firing him. After a one-year medico-legal investigation, the attorney general's office announced in October 2017 that Macchiarini had been negligent in four of the five cases investigated due to the use of devices and procedures not supported by evidence, but that a crime could not be proven because the patients might have died under any other treatment given. Also in October, Sweden's national scientific review board found scientific misconduct by Macchiarini and his co-authors in six papers about the procedures, and called for them to be retracted. As of 2020, Macchiarini has had eight of his research papers retracted, and two have received an expression of concern.  Education and career  Macchiarini obtained his medical degree (equivalent to MD) at the Medical School of the University of Pisa, Italy in 1986 and a Master of Surgery in 1991. He was an assistant professor there from 1990 to 1992. He took a course on statistics in clinical research at University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1989. He obtained degree certificates‚Äîa masters in organ and tissue transplantation dated 1994 and a doctorate in the same dated 1997, from University of Franche-Comt√©. According to Hannover Medical School he never had a salaried position there, but was head of the department of thoracic and vascular surgery at the Heidehaus Hanover hospital between 1999 and 2004. He was an investigator at the Institut d‚ÄôInvestigacions Biom√®diques-Instituto de Investigaciones Biom√©dicas in Barcelona from 2006 to 2009; he was affiliated with but not an employee of University of Barcelona and was apparently an employee at the Hospital Cl√≠nic de Barcelona during this time. He had an honorary appointment as a Visiting Professor from 2009 to 2014 at University College London. He was a consultant and project manager at University Hospital Careggi starting in 2010. He was appointed as a visiting professor at the Karolinska Institute in 2010, and as a part-time position as surgeon at the affiliated university hospital. In 2013 Karolinska terminated its clinical relationship with Macchiarini but allowed him to continue as a researcher; in February 2016 Karolinska announced that it would not renew Macchiarini's research contract, which was due to expire in November, and the next month Karolinska terminated the contract. The Karolinska Institute published the incomplete results of its verification of Macchiarini's CV in February 2016. Macchiarini made ties in Russia after he gave a master class in 2010 at the invitation of Mikhail Batin; a few months later he did a trachea transplant there which was widely covered in Russian media. This led to an appointment at Kuban State Medical University funded by the university and the Russian government, in 2011, along with an honorary doctorate. In 2016 Macchiarini moved to Kazan Federal University and the grant money moved with him. In April 2017 the university terminated Macchiarini's research project there.  Notable trachea surgeries   Claudia Castillo  In June 2008, Macchiarini conducted a transplant of a donated trachea colonized with the stem cells of the recipient, Claudia Castillo; the tissue was used to replace her left bronchus, which had been damaged by tuberculosis, and her left lung had collapsed. The trachea came from a cadaver, and was stripped of its cells and seeded with cells taken from Castillo's bone marrow. The bone marrow cells were cultured at Bristol University, the donor trachea was stripped at University of Padua, the stripped trachea was seeded with the cultured cells at University of Milan, and the trachea was transplanted by a team led by Macchiarini at Hospital Clinic in Barcelona.  Ciaran Finn-Lynch  In March 2010 Macchiarini attended a transplant performed by Great Ormond Street surgeons, similar to the one done for Castillo, on a ten year old Irish boy, Ciaran Finn-Lynch, at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. The boy was born with a 1 mm diameter trachea, and efforts to widen it had caused life-threatening complications. Unlike the Castillo procedure, in this case the stripped trachea was seeded with the boy's stem cells just hours before it was implanted.  Keziah Shorten  Keziah Shorten had trachea cancer and in 2010 Macchiarini did a transplant similar to the earlier two; the transplant failed the next year, and a synthetic trachea was implanted for palliative care at University College Hospital London in 2011 after which she was able to be discharged and return home for Christmas with her family before succumbing to her underlying disease. Woman in Russia In 2010 Macchiarini implanted a seeded donated trachea in a woman in Russia, working with the Russian surgeon Vladimir Parshin.  Andemariam Teklesenbet Beyene  Andemariam Teklesenbet Beyene was a man from Eritrea who was earning a doctorate in Iceland when he was diagnosed with cancer; the cancer was treated with radiation and surgery in 2009, but in 2011 his trachea was obstructed again. His doctors recommended palliative care, but also reached out to Macchiarini, who was at Karolinska by that time. In this case, Macchiarini collaborated with scientists at University College London to manufacture a fully synthetic trachea, with an engineered scaffold seeded with Beyene's marrow cells, instead of using a donated and stripped trachea, as had been done before. The operation occurred in June 2011 and was widely covered in the media, including a front page story in the New York Times. By end of the year the implant was failing, and while Beyene was able to complete his PhD in 2012, over the course of that year he had many treatments at Karolinska and he died in January 2013. The autopsy showed that he had a chronic lung infection, a clot in his lung, and the trachea had come loose.  Christopher Lyles  Christopher Lyles lived in the US; he had tracheal cancer which was treated with radiation and surgery. He heard about Beyene's treatment and through his doctor asked Macchiarini to do the same for him, and Macchiarini obliged, creating a fully synthetic trachea seeded with stem cells from Lyles and implanting it at Karolinska in November 2011. Lyles died suddenly in 2012 after he had returned home; no autopsy was performed.  Yulia Tuulik  In June 2012, Macchiarini implanted a fully synthetic seeded trachea in Yulia Tuulik at Kuban State Medical University; Tuulik had a tracheostomy resulting from a car accident but her life was not in danger. The graft included a cricoid cartilage, part of the voice box, which Macchiarini had not tried before. The trachea later collapsed, and was replaced; she died in 2014. An audit by the Russian government later found that Macchiarini had operated without a Russian medical license. Alexander Zozulya Also in June 2012, Macchiarini implanted a fully synthetic seeded trachea at Kuban State University, on Alexander Zozulya, who also had a tracheostomy resulting from a car accident and whose life was not in danger. The effects from the first implant in 2012 prompted a second surgery in November 2013. The patient died in February 2014 under unclear circumstances.  Yesim Cetir  Yesim Cetir, a Turkish woman, underwent a routine surgery in 2011 to treat excessive sweating in her hands, but due to an error her trachea was severely injured and her left lung was damaged. She came to Macchiarini at the Karolinska Institute for treatment, and in 2012 Macchiarini first removed her left lung and replaced her trachea with a pipe, then replaced the pipe with a fully synthetic seeded trachea. The next year the implant collapsed and Macchiarini replaced it with a second one. She had many complications from this procedure, and remained hospitalized and in constant need of having her airway cleared, and suffered kidney failure as well. In 2016 she underwent multiple organ transplants in the U.S., and her trachea was replaced with one from a cadaver. Cetir died in March 2017.  Hannah Warren  In April 2013 Macchiarini implanted a fully synthetic, seeded trachea in Hannah Warren, a two year old, who had been born without one. The operation was performed in the U.S., at OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Illinois. The operation also involved her esophagus, which didn't heal properly and required a second operation in June; she died July 6, 2013 from complications of the second surgery. Sadiq Kanaan  In August 2013 Sadiq Kanaan received a fully synthetic seeded tracheal implant from Macchiarini at Kuban State University. He died later the same year. Dmitri Onogda  In June 2014, Macchiarini implanted a fully synthetic seeded trachea in Dmitri Onogda at the Kuban State University. The implant failed and was replaced, and as of 2017 Onogda was still alive.  Allegations   University Hospital Careggi patient extortion In 2012, Macchiarini was arrested in Italy and charged with asking patients at the University Hospital Careggi for money to expedite their procedures; the charges were dismissed in May 2015 and the prosecutor's appeal was dismissed in September 2015. Research misconduct In 2014 Macchiarini was accused by four former colleagues and co-authors of having falsified claims in his research. In April 2015, the ethics committee of the institute issued a response to one set of allegations with regard to research ethics and peer review at the Lancet, and found them to be groundless. The Karolinska Institute had also appointed an external expert, Bengt Gerdin, to review the charges, comparing the results reported to the medical record of the hospital; the report was released by Karolinska in May 2015. Gerdin found that Macchiarini had committed research misconduct in seven papers, by not getting ethical approval for the some of his operations, and misrepresenting the result of some of those operations, as well as work he had done in animals. In August 2015, after considering the findings and a rebuttal provided by Macchiarini, vice-chancellor of Karolinska Institute Anders Hamsten found that Macchiarini had acted \\"without due care\\" but had not committed misconduct. The journal The Lancet, which published Macchiarini's work, also published an article defending Macchiarini. On January 13, 2016‚Äîthe same day that the first part of a three-part documentary about Macchiarini would air on Swedish television‚ÄîGerdin criticized the vice- chancellor's dismissal of the allegations in an interview on Swedish television. Later that day, Sveriges Television investigative TV show Dokument inifr√•n started airing a three-part series , titled \\"Experimenten\\", in which Macchiarini's work was investigated. The documentary shows Macchiarini continuing operations with the new method even after it showed little or no promise, exaggerating the health of his patients in articles as they died one by one. While Macchiarini admitted that the synthetic trachea did not work in the current state, he did not agree that trying it on several additional patients without further testing had been inappropriate. Allegations were also made that patients' medical conditions both before and after the operations, as reported in academic papers, did not match reality. Macchiarini also stated that the synthetic trachea had been tested on animals before using it on humans, something that could not be verified. On January 28, Karolinska issued a statement saying that the documentary made claims of which it was unaware, and that it would consider re-opening the investigations. These concerns were echoed by the chairman of the Karolinska Institute, Lars Leijonborg, and the chairman of the Swedish Medical Association, Heidi Stensmyren, calling for an independent investigation that would also look at how the issue was dealt with by the university and hospital management. In February 2016, the Karolinska Institute published a review of Macchiarini's CV that identified discrepancies. in February 2016 Karolinska announced that it would not renew Macchiarini's research contract, which was due to expire in November, and the next month Karolinska terminated the contract. In October 2016, the BBC broadcast a three-part Storyville documentary, Fatal Experiments: The Downfall of a Supersurgeon, directed by Bosse Lindquist and based on the earlier Swedish programmes about Macchiarini. After the special aired, the Karolinska Institute requested Sweden's national scientific review board to review six of Macchiarini's publications about the procedures. The board published its findings in October 2017, and concluded that all six were the result of scientific misconduct, in particular by failing to report the complications and deaths that occurred after the interventions; one of the articles also claimed that the procedure had been approved by an ethics committee, when this had not happened. The board called for all six of the papers to be retracted. It also said that all of the co-authors had committed scientific misconduct as well. Retractions The following papers authored by Macchiarini have been retracted: *November 2012, retracted by the journal for copying a table from another paper without citing it: *March 2017, retracted by authors after Karolinska requested retraction in December 2016; after Nature had issued an editorial notice of concern in October 2016: * Macchiarini's 2011 Lancet paper described the treatment of Beyene. In February 2016 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences called for the Lancet to correct the paper, as Beyene had died, in March 2016 four authors asked to be removed as authors, and in April 2016 the Lancet issued a notice of concern; this paper too has since been retracted. **  Other misconduct  A story published by Vanity Fair on January 5, 2016 discussed Macchiarini's affair with a journalist, who had written enthusiastic articles about him. The story also called into question statements he had made on his CV. The article paints him as a serial fabulist, and as \\"the extreme form of a con man,\\" remarking that \\"the fact that he could keep all the details straight and compartmentalize these different lives and lies is really amazing.\\" The article details a courtship and alleged subsequent marriage arrangements from the perspective of a NBC News producer, Benita Alexander. Alexander had been tasked by NBC News to produce a documentary-type programme for Dateline in 2013 called \\"A Leap of Faith\\" to portray Macchiarini and she ultimately began an affair with her subject, only to find out later in 2015 that he had been married for thirty years, including the entire period of the courtship. The details recounted in the article include Alexander relating Macchiarini's alleged lies about being a surgeon to the stars and current and former heads of state, and a planned wedding to Alexander to be the social event of the year (with Pope Francis officiating, Andrea Bocelli singing, Enoteca Pinchiorri catering, and numerous celebrities attending), among other reported falsified details about his C.V. and personal life. Macchiarini is reported to have claimed that Pope Francis had given his personal blessing for the wedding between the couple, both said to be divorcees, and would host the ceremony. The Pope's spokesman said that the Pope had no \\"personal doctor\\" named Macchiarini, knew nobody of that name, and would not have officiated.  Fallout for Karolinska Institute  The secretary of the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, Urban Lendahl, resigned in February 2016, owing to his involvement in recruiting Macchiarini to Karolinska Institutet in 2010. Shortly afterwards the vice chancellor, Anders Hamsten, who in 2015 had cleared Macchiarini of scientific misconduct, also resigned. In August 2016, a committee led by Kjell Asplund that had been called into being in February to investigate the three operations that Macchiarini had performed at the Karolinska University Hospital issued its report, identifying several ethical shortcomings by the hospital and Macchiarini; it also noted the pressure put on the hospital by the institute with regard to Macchiarini's hospital appointment and translational research. Another report was issued in early September that examined the behavior of the institute; it was authored by a committee led by Sten Heckscher. The report found that the institute had conducted almost no diligence in hiring Macchiarini nor in overseeing his work, nor in considering his performance in reviewing his contracts; the committee found that interference from people higher up in management had interfered in the processes. On September 5, 2016, the Swedish government moved to dismiss the entire board of the Institute. Shortly afterwards Harriet Wallberg and Anders Hamsten were removed from the judging panel that is responsible for annually choosing the Nobel Prize for Medicine, selection of which is additionally overseen by Karolinska Institutet.  Legal proceedings  In June 2016 Swedish police opened an investigation into whether Macchiarini might have committed involuntary manslaughter. In October 2017, the public prosecutor office announced that all criminal charges against Macchiarini have been dropped, although the medical treatment in four of five cases operated in Sweden was classified as 'negligent' the criminal responsibility cannot be proven. After a one-year medico-legal investigation, the attorney general's office announced in October 2017 that Macchiarini had been negligent in four of the five cases investigated due to the use of devices and procedures not supported by evidence, but that a crime could not be proven because the patients might have died under any other treatment given. In 2019, an Italian court sentenced Macchiarini to sixteen months in prison for abuse of office and forging documents. On 29 September, 2020, Mikael Bjork, director of Public Prosecution in Sweden indicted an unnamed surgeon on charges of aggravated assault. Swedish news agency TT said the indicted surgeon was Dr. Paolo Macchiarini. Bjork said he reopened the investigation in December of 2018 and obtained new written evidence and interviewed individuals in five different countries. Bjork said victims received \\"serious physical injuries and great suffering\\" as a result of the operations performed on them and that he \\"made the assessment that the three operations are therefore to be considered as aggravated assault.\\"  See also  * List of scientific misconduct incidents  References   External links  *Information Index: Trachea Transplants and Paolo Macchiarini, M.D. by Citizens for Responsible Care and Research, Inc. *Macchiarini posts at For Better Science *Macchiarini posts at Retraction Watch Category:1958 births Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Living people Category:Confidence tricksters Category:Italian transplant surgeons Category:Karolinska Institute faculty Category:People from Basel-Stadt Category:Regenerative biomedicine Category:People involved in scientific misconduct incidents Category:University of Pisa alumni Category:Medical scandals Category:Thoracic surgeons Category:R√©sum√© frauds and controversies ","title":"Paolo Macchiarini"},{"id":"24365644","text":"A Cornish pasty Cornish cuisine encompasses the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with Cornwall and the Cornish people. It has been heavily influenced by the geography of the county as well as its social history. Cornwall, being a peninsula surrounded by seas historically well-stocked with fish, has meant that fish dishes form a major part of the historical and modern recipes in Cornwall. The fishing industry has played a major part in the economy of the county. The iconic dish of Cornwall, the pasty, has its roots in another historical industry within the county, this being mining. Cornwall has influenced and been influenced by other British cuisine, as well as having similarities with the cuisine of its neighbour in South West England, Devon. Certain Cornish food dishes have been granted protected geographical status under EU law, ensuring that they can only be labelled and marketed as \\"Cornish\\" if they are produced and mainly sourced within Cornwall. The Cornwall Food and Drink festival promotes Cornish cuisine and produce. A major theme is the use of game foods as well as fish. A number of high-profile Cornish restaurants and hotels use game as part of their menu. This is highlighted at the Cornwall Food and Drink festival by the Magnificent Seven Dinner, put on by seven of the best chefs in Cornwall. Larger commercial producers of characteristically Cornish products include the bakers, famously Warrens Bakery, and the creameries Davidstow Creamery and A. E. Rodda & Son of Scorrier. Dishes Rick Stein's Seafood Restaurant, Padstow. Cornwall has a strong culinary heritage. Surrounded on three sides by the sea amid fertile fishing grounds, Cornwall naturally has fresh seafood readily available; Newlyn is the largest fishing port in the UK by value of fish landed. Traditional dishes in the Lizard Peninsula are described in a pamphlet published in 1980. These include breakfast of \\"gerty milk\\" (bread and milk) with tea or cocoa; pasties made of pastry, swede, potatoes, beef and onion; boiled beef; squab pie of apples, onions and salt pork; \\"scrowled pilchards\\" (grilled over the fire on an iron plate); and \\"heavy cake\\".Meneage and Lizard Oral History Group (ed.) (1980) Traditional Life in the Far South West. [N. pl.]: the Group; pp. 15-20 Cornish food and drink was promoted in the Houses of Parliament in April 2009 following intervention from Mark Prisk MP, then Shadow Minister for Cornwall, as part of the Commons plans for a South West regional food week. Fish dishes alt=A blue ceramic dish containing a stargazy pie, with six fish poking out of a shortcrust pastry lid, looking skywards Television chef Rick Stein has long operated a fish restaurant in Padstow, and in 2006 Jamie Oliver opened his second restaurant, Fifteen Cornwall, in Watergate Bay near Newquay. MasterChef host and founder of Smiths of Smithfield John Torode purchased Seiners in Perranporth in 2007. Nathan Outlaw opened a two-Michelin-star fish restaurant at Rock, which then transferred to Port Isaac. One famous local fish dish is stargazy pie, a fish- based pie in which the heads of the fish stick through the piecrust, as though \\"star-gazing\\". The pie is cooked as part of traditional celebrations for Tom Bawcock's Eve. Pasties Cornish Pirates rugby players with a giant pasty that was paraded as part of the 2009 Saint Piran's Festival at Camborne. Cornwall is perhaps best known though for its pasties, a savoury baked dish made from pastry. Today's pasties usually contain a filling of beef steak, onion, potato and swede with salt and white pepper, but historically pasties had a variety of different fillings. \\"Turmut, 'tates and mate\\" (i.e. swede, potatoes and meat) describes a filling once very common. For instance, the licky pasty contained mostly leeks, and the herb pasty contained watercress, parsley, and shallots. Pasties are often locally referred to as oggies. Historically, pasties were also often made with sweet fillings such as jam, apple and blackberry, plums or cherries. The Pasty Shop and West Cornwall Pasty are among the Cornish chains that have popularised traditional oggies around the UK. Meat pies Squab pie is a traditional dish from South West England, with early records showing it was commonly eaten in Cornwall, Devon and Gloucestershire. Although the name suggests it should contain squab (young domestic pigeon), it in fact contains mutton and apples. The pie has become popular around the world, though outside South West England, it generally does contain pigeon. In recent times Ginsters bakery has become a large-scale producer of meat pies. Dairy products Davidstow Creamery The wet climate and relatively poor soil of Cornwall make it unsuitable for growing many arable crops. However, it is ideal for growing the rich grass required for dairying, leading to the production of Cornwall's other famous export, clotted cream. This forms the basis for many local specialities including Cornish fudge and Cornish ice cream. Cornish clotted cream is protected under EU law, and cannot be made anywhere else. Its principal manufacturer is Rodda's, based at Scorrier. Clotted cream is a principal ingredient of a Cornish cream tea. ;Cheese See also List of Cornish cheeses Heavy (hevva) cakes In 2004 there were nearly 60 varieties of cheese produced in Cornwall, and Cornish cheeses have won many awards.Carol Trewin and Adam Woolfitt, Gourmet Cornwall, Alison Hodge Publishers, 2005, , Davidstow Cheddar and Cathedral City Cheddar cheeses are produced at Davidstow by Dairy Crest, using water ultimately from St David's Holy Well, next to the parish church. St Erth was the site of a large creamery operated by United Dairies; this was responsible for processing a large quantity of milk produced in Penwith. Cornish Blue is a cheese made by the Cornish Cheese Company at Upton Cross and was recognised in December 2010 as the winning cheese in the World Cheese Awards. Cornish Brie is a brie- style, soft, white-rinded cheese produced by several makers in Cornwall. Gevrik is a soft, full-fat goat's milk cheese produced in Trevarrian near Newquay. The name means \\"little goat\\" in Cornish. Keltic Gold is a type of semi-hard cheese made by Whalesborough Farm Foods. Menallack and Nanterrow cheeses are made at Menallack Farm near Penryn.Freeman, Sarah (1998) The Real Cheese Companion. London: Little, Brown; (Cornish cheeses; pp. 115-127) Tesyn is a type of smoked goat's milk cheese made by the firm Cornish Cuisine. Cornish Yarg is a semi-hard cow's milk cheese made in Cornwall. Before being left to mature, this cheese is carefully wrapped in nettle leaves to form an edible, though mouldy, rind. The texture varies from creamy and soft immediately under the nettle coating to a Caerphilly cheese-like crumbly texture in the middle. Modern production is at Pengreep Farm near Truro, by Lynher Dairies from an old recipe. Lynher Dairies also make Cornish Garland and Tiskey Meadow. Cakes, sweet dishes and fruit Traditional Cornish fairings Local cakes and desserts include saffron cake, heavy (hevva) cake (similar to Welsh cakes), fairing biscuits, figgy 'obbin, or fuggan, scones (often served with jam and clotted cream) and whortleberry pie.Mason, Laura; Brown, Catherine (1999) From Bath Chaps to Bara Brith. Totnes: Prospect BooksPettigrew, Jane (2004) Afternoon Tea. Andover: JarroldFitzgibbon, Theodora (1972) A Taste of England: the West Country. London: J. M. Dent Baking cakes using yeast is more common here than in the rest of England. The Cornish Gilliflower is a variety of apple tree found at Truro in 1813 which was afterwards grown commercially. Other Cornish cultivars include the Cornish Aromatic and the King Byerd. Various fruit trees can be grown in Cornwall but it is not particularly suitable for this. Whortleberries and blackberries can be gathered in some rural areas and homegrown produce can be used for jam- making or puddings.  Stoves and ovens  The Cornish stove (commonly known as the \\"slab\\") was found in most kitchens in west Cornwall. These stoves were supplied by a number of foundries in the district and were made of cast iron with brass knobs. The ironwork was kept looking fine with blacklead. The foundries included Sara, Jenkins & Barnicoat of Camborne, Tippet, Terril & Rodgers of Redruth, Luke's of St Ives, Hill's and Radmore & Dart at Truro, Roberts's at Praze, and Toy's and Williams's at Helston. The doors to the firebox were either closed to heat the oven, or opened to provide a cheerful fire. Above the oven and firebox was the hotplate and some stoves had a built- in boiler to supply hot water. Once a week the blackleading would be renewed and the brasswork would be polished.Meneage and Lizard Oral History Group (ed.) (1980) Traditional Life in the Far South West. [N. pl.]: the Group; pp. 5-6 The exhibits of the St Ives Museum include a reconstruction of a traditional Cornish kitchen.Hudson, Kenneth & Nicholls, Ann (1987) The Cambridge Guide to the Museums of Britain and Ireland. Cambridge University Press; p. 328 The predecessor of the Cornish range was the open hearth of which three still existed in the 1970s in the parishes of Feock and Kea. At that time several ranges by different makers were to be found at a house in St Agnes.Feock Local History Group (1977) Feock with Devoran and Carnon Downs; pt. 4, pp. 18-24: \\"From open hearth to Cornish range\\". A clome oven (or cloam oven) is a type of masonry oven. It has a removable door made of clay or alternatively a cast iron door, and was a standard fitting for most kitchen fireplaces in Cornwall and Devon. The oven would be built into the side of the chimney breast, often appearing as a round bulge in the chimney. This bulge consisted of the masonry surrounding the oven, and was intended to be dismantled should the oven ever need to be replaced. During installation, they are surrounded by packed clay to prevent the actual oven cracking. As cast iron range cookers were brought into common use, it became standard practice to build a dividing wall to split the fireplace into two separate fireplaces, thus allowing access to the clome oven, as well as providing a space of the correct dimensions to fit a Cornish stove or similar. Bricks were the most common building material for this task, since the installation of a Cornish stove required a brick flue to be built up the back of the fireplace. Many clome ovens were preserved in situ in this way. When large parts of Lanhydrock House were destroyed by fire in 1881 a new kitchen block was built next to the old house. It was unusual for a large Victorian kitchen to be housed in a new building like this. The house has been a National Trust property since 1953 and is open to visitors. Alcoholic beverages St Austell Brewery There are many types of beers brewed in Cornwall - those produced by Sharp's Brewery, Skinner's Brewery and St Austell Brewery are the best-known - including stouts, ales and other beer types. There is some small scale production of wine, mead and cider. Spingo (meaning strong beer in Old English) is a generic name for a collection of beers brewed solely in the brewery of the Blue Anchor Inn in Coinage Hall Street, Helston. Cider was traditionally made for farmworkers and Cornwall has a wide selection of local apple varieties. Healey's Cornish Cyder Farm near Truro brews and sells its own cider, brandy and country fruit wine produced on site. There are currently, at least 12 cider producers in Cornwall Overseas Australia Cornish food, like the Cornish pasty, is still popular amongst the Cornish Australian communities. Former premier of South Australia Don Dunstan once took part in a pasty-making contest. Swanky beer and saffron cake were very popular in the past and have been revitalised by Kernewek Lowender and the Cornish Associations. In the 1880s, Henry Madren Leggo, whose parents came from St Just, Cornwall, began making vinegar, pickles, sauces, cordials and other grocery goods based on his mother's traditional recipes. His company, now known as Leggo's, is wrongly believed by many to be Italian. A boutique brewery operation in South Australia, Copper Coast Wines, produces traditional Cornish Swanky beer, a bottle-conditioned beer, for the biennial Copper Coast region Kernewek Lowender Cornish Festival, held in May in alternate (odd numbered) years. The name \\"Swanky beer\\" appears to refer to a Cornish home brew. During the 19th century, many Cornish miners emigrated to the Copper Triangle region of South Australia to work in the copper mines at Moonta. They brought local traditions, such as Cornish pasties and home-brewed beer they termed \\"Swanky beer\\", which was brewed from ingredients including malted barley, hops, yeast, brown sugar, ginger, raisins and soft rainwater. It was put into beer bottles with the tops tied down with twine and stored in the coolest place in the house until ready. It was served on festive occasions, such as Easter, Midwinter's Night (Bonfire Night) and Christmas. United States A \\"Cousin Jack's\\" pasty shop in Grass Valley, California Some aspects of Cornish American cuisine are derived from Cornwall. At Mineral Point, Wisconsin, it is claimed that authentic Cornish food, such as pasties and figgyhobbin, are served and Cornish pasties are sold at ex-Cornish mining towns in America. The city of Grass Valley, California, holds St Piran's Day celebrations every year, which along with carol singing, includes a flag raising ceremony, games involving the Cornish pasty, and Cornish wrestling competitions. Mexico A Cornish mine in Mineral del Monte, Hidalgo, Mexico In the State of Hidalgo in central Mexico, a local speciality originates from the Cornish pasty, called pastes, which was introduced by miners and workers from Cornwall who were contracted in the silver mining towns of Mineral del Monte and Pachuca. The majority of migrants to this region came from what is now known as the Cornish \\"central mining district\\" of Camborne and Redruth.

(2000) Gynecologic, Obstetric, and Related Surgery. 2nd Ed.Gilbert DA. (1999) Female Aesthetic Genital Surgery. Reconstructive and Plastic Surgery of the External Genitalia. Ehrich R, and G. Alter, Editors. Among the vagino-anal conditions resolved by perineoplasty are vaginal looseness, vaginal itching, damaged perineum, incontinence, genital warts, dyspareunia, vaginal stenosis, vaginismus, vulvar vestibulitis, and decreased sexual sensation. Depending upon the vagino-anal condition to be treated, there are two variants of the perineoplasty procedure: the first, to tighten the perineal muscles and the vagina; the second, to loosen the perineal muscles. Surgical correction Perineoplasty: The internal, muscular anatomy of the female perineum. A perineoplasty procedure repairs damage to the perineum and damage to the Vulva that a woman might experience as a result of: * Child birth ‚Äî the stretching of parturition can cause tears to the tissues, or might require cutting (episiotomy) should the woman‚Äôs birth canal prove too narrow to allow unobstructed passage of the infant.Nichols DH, Clarke-Pearson DL. (2000).Gilbert, DA. (1999).. Moreover, any perineal tissue that presents either a cut or a tear can heal and fuse together before the stitches dissolve, regardless of whether or not the tissues originally were joined in that anatomic configuration. * Obesity ‚Äî excess weight can over- stretch and damage the structures of the perineum, and can also stress and cause the separation of the perineal muscles.Gilbert DA. (1999) * Inadequate innervation ‚Äî either an absence of nerves or too few nerves. * Sexual penetration ;Indications Clinically, the woman reports a feeling of physical looseness in her vulvo-vaginal area, which might be associated with decreased sexual satisfaction when compared to the degree of her sexual satisfaction before the incidence of the perineal damage. The indications can include detachment of the anal sphincter muscle, and the collapse of her rectum (rectocele). Perineoplasty is occasionally associated with posterior colporrhaphy, and can be performed in conjunction with the procedure. A perineoplasty procedure first involves a V-shaped incision to the posterior wall of the vagina. Incisions atop the V-incision can be flat, curved, or angled upwards, which incision is applied is determined by the degree of vaginal tightening to be achieved.Gilbert DA. (1999). Once the incision is made, any existing scar tissue and abnormal tissue fixations that resulted from previous injury or surgery or injury are removed. Depending upon the degree of damage occurred to the perineum, the corrections can include the: * Pubococcygeus muscles * Bulbospongiosus muscles * Other muscles detached from their perineal attachments Stitching of the muscles is carefully performed to avoid creating transverse ridges, and so produce a ridged interior surface in the vagina.Nichols DH, Clarke-Pearson DL. (2000) Dyspareunia The Woman who experiences painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), or who is afflicted with vaginismus (involuntary contraction of the puboccygeus muscles) can be treated with a variant perineoplasty procedure that loosens the over-tight vaginal introitus (entry). Some surgeons use a simple surface incision at the fourchette for such loosening, but generally is not the most effectively corrective surgical approach.Woodruff, JD; Genadry, R, and S. Poliakoff. (1981). To perform loosening perineoplasty, a triangle of skin is excised from below the vulvar vestibule with its base near the vestibule and its apex near the anus. This allows the removal of genital warts and the adjustment of musculature necessary to increase the size of the vagina. In this procedure, it is desirable to maintain the vaginal mucosa as much as possible. Recovery typically requires 4‚Äì6 weeks. Perineoplasty is generally considered effective for treatment of dyspareunia, including that caused by lichen sclerosus,Rouzier, R. et al. (2002) Perineoplasty for the treatment of introital stenosis related to vulvar lichen sclerosis. Am J Obs Gyn 186: 49-52. and vaginismus. It is also considered an effective treatment for vulvar vestibulitis, although it is generally recommended following the failure of nonsurgical methods.Woodruff, JD et al. (1995) Long-term outcome of perineoplasty for vulvar vestibulitis. J Women's Health. 4:669-675.Bornstein, J, et al. (1997) Predicting the outcome of surgical treatment of vulvar vestibulitis.

Criticism * The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published Committee Opinion No. 378: Vaginal ‚ÄúRejuvenation‚Äù and Cosmetic Vaginal Procedures (2007), the college‚Äôs formal policy statement of opposition to the commercial misrepresentations of labiaplasty, and associated vaginoplastic procedures, as medically ‚Äúaccepted and routine surgical practices‚Äù. The ACOG doubted the medical safety and the therapeutic efficacy of the surgical techniques and procedures for performing vaginoplastic operations such as labiaplasty, vaginal rejuvenation, the designer vagina, revirgination, and Gr√§fenberg Spot amplification, and recommended that women seeking such genitoplastic surgeries must be fully informed, with the available surgical-safety statistics, of the potential health risks of surgical-wound infection, of pudendal nerve damage (resulting in either an insensitive or an over-sensitive vulva), of dyspareunia (painful coitus), of tissue adhesions (epidermoid cysts), and of painful scars. * To determine whether or not women truly seek labiaplasty solely to have \\"more socially acceptable genitalia\\" the International Society for the Study of Women‚Äôs Sexual Health (ISSWSH) considered the practices of elective plastic surgery of the vulva and of FGC (female genital cutting) in the Third World. The report, Is Elective Vulvar Plastic Surgery ever Warranted and What Screening Should be Done Preoperatively? (2007) indicated that physical variations in the external appearance of the vulvo-vaginal complex are statistically normal, but that labiaplasty ‚Äì like access to all types of medical treatment ‚Äì is a woman‚Äôs human right. Nonetheless, the ISSWSH report concluded that vaginoplastic surgery might be medically warranted only after the woman undergoes a pre-operative psychological screening, and only if the woman afterwards remains so decided ‚Äì yet also recommended that the vaginal surgery can be performed if the surgeon deems it medically necessary for her health.Goodman MP, Bachmann G, Johnson C, Fourcroyo JL, Goldstein A, Goldstein G, Sklar S.

Reception ECK was listed as a cult in the 1999 parliamentary report established by the Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France and also appeared in the 1997 Belgian parliamentary report. It was considered as dangerous because of its pseudo-medical speech which could be harmful to members' health, exaggerated requests for money, and indoctrination of the members who became dependent to the group. It was also criticized by anti-cult groups and former members. In 2007, an academic thesis about the dangers of cults for health contained a large analysis of ECK beliefs and practices.

A military parade involving 10,000 troops and the display of many high-tech weapons was held in Tiananmen Square in Beijing and various celebrations were conducted all over the country. China's paramount leader Hu Jintao inspected the troops along Chang'an Avenue in Beijing. This parade was immediately followed by a civilian parade involving 100,000 participants. Background The 60th Anniversary Military Parade took place on Chang'an Avenue, beneath Tiananmen. The People's Republic of China was founded on 1 October 1949. Since then, celebrations of varying scales occur on National Day each year. Military parades, presided over by Chairman Mao Zedong, were held every year between 1949 and 1959. In September 1960, the Chinese leadership decided that in order to save funds and \\"be frugal\\", large- scale ceremonies for National Day would only be held every ten years, with a smaller-scale ceremony every five years. The last large-scale celebration during the Mao era was in 1969. Large-scale celebrations did not take place for 14 years amidst the climax of the Cultural Revolution. Since then, the most prominent National Day celebrations have taken place in 1984 and 1999, at the 35th and 50th anniversaries respectively. During these celebrations, then- paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin reviewed military parades of the People's Liberation Army. The 2009 parade was the first and last time Hu Jintao oversaw this task, as he left office of General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (paramount leader) in 2012 due to term limits. Preparations Banner in Shenzhen in late August 40 million potted flowers, supplied by the state-owned Beijing Flowers & Trees Corp., were put in place in Beijing streets, approximately 5 million of which have been planted along the east‚Äìwest axis of Chang'an Avenue, also known as 'Avenue of Eternal Peace'. Flowers in Tiananmen Square were under 24-hour surveillance; Beijing Jinggong Red Flag factory is producing 2 million national flags for the celebrations. In Tiananmen Square itself, 56 \\"pillars of national unity\\" ‚Äì each one symbolizing the 56 ethnic groups in China ‚Äì were erected, with each containing fireworks for the night event on 1 October. 800,000 volunteers controlled crowds and maintained order while a further 30,000 provided translation services at subway and bus stations. Mosquitoes, rats, flies, and cockroaches were the targets of professional exterminators ‚Äì four unannounced night-time sweeps were carried out around Tiananmen Square in Beijing, including in the Forbidden City complex. The public was encouraged to support the eradication through red slogan banners along Beijing streets and alleys, in what The Times said was reminiscent of the Four Pests campaign. One of these slogans read: \\"Eradicate the four pests, stress hygiene. Cleanly, cleanly welcome National Day!‚Äù Tiananmen Square was sealed off for the day on 29 August for the first rehearsals. Tens of thousands of fully costumed performers rehearsed on 16 September. The military also prepared, with several hundred vehicles rolling down Chang'an Avenue on 6 September. parts of Beijing were closed down on 18 September for the final rehearsals of the anniversary parade. Police cleared streets and office buildings on the main roadways near Tiananmen Square from noon onwards for rehearsals that evening. State media went into overdrive, for example, highlighting how thousands of troops spent four months drilling to march in step on a mock practice ground with scale model of Chang'an Avenue - complete with the leadership reviewing stand. Following disruptions caused by the drills, which shut down roads and large parts of the Beijing Subway, Xinhua News Agency announced that the final rehearsal parade, scheduled for 26 September, was called off. Security The Sunday Times reported that \\"thousands of agents will stage a security clampdown exceeding anything seen for the 2008 Olympic Games\\". Police in Beijing and neighbouring provinces were in a heightened state of readiness, with night patrols by armed police lasting from 15 September until the end of the festivities. All basements in the city were subject to inspection by police, while some restaurants with roof terraces were not permitted to seat patrons on sides overlooking the street for the duration. However, despite the supposed high alert around Beijing, a man armed with a knife killed two people and injured 12 in the heart of Beijing on 17 September. Peter Ford of The Christian Science Monitor said that the stabbing incident had been played down locally. Following the attacks, however, the knives were removed from sale at some stores such as Wal-Mart and Carrefour.Trung Hoa ‚Äúl√†m s·∫°ch‚Äù trung t√¢m th·ªß ƒë√¥ chu·∫©n b·ªã l·ªÖ Qu·ªëc Kh√°nh Thousands of paramilitary officers were deployed at bridges, road tunnels and other strategic points in the city. Residents were warned that if they stepped out onto balconies along the route, they might be shot. 30,000 people with tickets have been invited to watch the event, but others were encouraged to watch it on television to \\"avoid complications.\\" The Times says the authorities engaged counter-terrorist units and informers in districts where Xinjiang Muslims live, placed Tibetan Buddhists under surveillance, and arrested dissidents. Peasants coming to the capital to present their grievances as petitions were blocked. while the government ordered the search of all cars entering Beijing. The security drives organised by the Ministry of Public Security in Beijing, as well as neighbouring Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong and Shanxi provinces, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and the Tianjin Municipality was dubbed a \\"Security Moat\\" by a senior official. The official said the \\"safety of China's National Day celebrations and stability in Beijing was of overriding importance.\\" The Times reported Internet users saying censorship has been tightened: many sites have been blocked, among them Facebook and Twitter; one media analyst said that the authorities upgraded their technology to block free proxy services and were trying to block any free proxy services and VPNs during the week prior to the anniversary. Other security arrangements in place included relocation of mailboxes and newspaper stands along Chang'an Avenue and the closure or restricted opening of some of the hotels along the route (ex. the Beijing Hotel, the Beijing News Plaza Hotel, and the Beijing International Hotel). Other hotels on Chang'an Avenue closed guest rooms facing the main road during the celebrations. Media The government established a media centre from 22 September until 2 October at the Media Center Hotel catering for journalists covering celebrations. The centre's deputy, Zhu Shouchen, said they received applications from more than 4,500 journalists around the world, including some 1,300 journalists from 346 media organisations in 108 countries. Almost 400 of them were said to be from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. A film entitled The Founding of a Republic, commissioned by China's film regulator and made by the China Film Group (CFG) to mark the anniversary, was released nationwide on 17 September. The film retells the tale of the Communist ascendancy and triumph, with a star-studded cast including Zhang Ziyi, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and directors Jiang Wen, Chen Kaige and John Woo in mostly cameos appearances; the leading roles ‚Äì such as Mao Zedong ‚Äì were played by lesser known actors. CFG chairman Han Sanping co-directed the film with Huang Jianxin. A CFG spokesman said many stars answered Han's call to appear in the film and waived their fee, helping it keep its modest budget of 60‚Äì70 million yuan (US$8.8‚Äì$10 million). According to the executive at one of China's top multiplex chains, the film unusually married \\"the core of an 'ethically inspiring' film\\" ‚Äì code for propaganda films, according to the Associated Press ‚Äì \\"with commercial packaging.\\" Parades A PLZ-89 self-propelled howitzer passes the Shin Kong Place Luxury shopping centre during a training exercise, Beijing. Leaders Liu Qi, as the Beijing municipal Communist Party Secretary, was the master of ceremonies for the event. Hu Jintao, in his position as the General Secretary of the Communist Party, President of the People's Republic, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, presided over the military parade. In addition, all members of the Politburo Standing Committee at the time, along with the former General Secretary, President Jiang Zemin, stood atop Tiananmen in protocol order for the entire duration of the parade. Other prominent retired leaders, including former Premiers Li Peng and Zhu Rongji, and former Vice-President Zeng Qinghong were also in attendance. Military parade An HQ-9 at the China's 60th anniversary parade. The military parade took place on Chang'an Avenue, with the country's leaders watching the parade from Tiananmen, above Mao's portrait. Hu Jintao inspected the troops standing onto a Hongqi HQE limousine designed for the event, with a special license plate (‰∫¨V 02009). For the anniversary, the Chinese government budgeted roughly $44 million for the military parade, with some budget cuts due to the recent global financial crisis. The parade displayed 52 new types of military hardware, including ZTZ99 main battle tanks, J-10 fighter aircraft, KJ-200 and KJ-2000 early-warning aircraft, Z-9W attack helicopters, and new models of the Type 95 and Type 03 assault rifles. The five new types of missiles were paraded by the Second Artillery Corps. The Second Artillery's display included a total of 108 missiles and was intended to showcase China's strategic deterrence capabilities.Zhongguo Xinwen She, \\"Second Artillery To Debut 5 New Strategic Missiles at National Day Parade\\", 28 September 2009.

Dozens of floats were surrounded by groups of either 1,949 or 2,009 marchers, with the total number of people marching in the parade being over one hundred thousand. One float had a giant portrait of Mao Zedong, which was immediately followed by similar floats with equally large portraits of Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. On each of these portraits were inscribed slogans of each leader's signature ideologies: Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, and the Scientific Development Concept. Voice recordings of each leader were also played through loudspeakers. A float with 181 foreigners from 53 countries named \\"One World\\" also took part.

Their pictorial design is based on the winning entries of a competition: Victoria Harbour and Tiananmen Square are depicted on two interlocking cogwheels on the HK$1.40 stamp; the five-star national flag flying by the side of the \\"Forever Blooming Bauhinia\\" (HK$1.80). The Bird's Nest stadium is on the HK$2.40, while China's manned spacecraft Shenzhou 7 is depicted on the HK$2.50. The Temple of Heaven features on the HK$3 value and a golden dragon soaring above the Great Wall adorns the HK$5 stamp. A souvenir sheet features all six stamps, which form a perfect ring with the accompanying number \\"6\\", together forming the number \\"60\\". Hong Kong's stamp sheetlet has two HK$5 stamps in Chinese red, one featuring Beijing and one Victoria.

Women are underrepresented and underestimated in corporate leadership, making up only 4.8% of CEOs in S&P; 500 companies, despite making up 44.7% of total employees. Women in corporate leadership Katharine Graham became the CEO of The Washington Post company in 1972, making her the first female CEO of a Fortune 500 company. In her memoir, Graham outlines the personal struggles that she faced as a woman in such a high position at a publishing company. She constantly doubted herself and would often look for reassurance from male colleagues. Graham played an integral part in the success of the Washington Post. During her three decades of leadership, revenue grew nearly twentyfold and the Washington Post became a public corporation listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Ursula Burns was named CEO of Xerox in 2009. The then $17 billion industry leading company was run by Anne Mulcahy, who chose Burns as her successor. This transference of leadership was the first time a female CEO chose another female CEO to succeed her. There are currently only 5 African American CEO‚Äôs heading Fortune 500 companies and amongst them Burns is the only female. By accomplishing this she defeated the odds that many young women of color are facing today. ‚ÄúMany people told me I had three strikes against me: I was black. I was a girl. I was poor.‚Äù Burns climbed the ranks from an intern at the company in 1980, to president in 2007, CEO in 2009 and then chairman in 2010. During her position as CEO Burns lead the acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services. The $6.4 billion purchase is the largest asset purchase in Xerox history. That acquisition has aided Xerox‚Äôs progression into becoming the technology and services enterprise it is today. Xerox‚Äôs Services business accounts for over 50 percent of the company‚Äôs revenue. Xerox also continues to maintain its top spot as market share holder with its Document Technology business. As of 2016, women only account for only 20% of all S&P; 500 directors despite making up 47% of the U.S. workforce and controlling about 75% of household spending and more than 50% of personal wealth in the U.S. There are around 2 women per board, with the average S&P; 500 board consisting of 11 members. As of 2014, females make up only 14.6% percent of executive officers and 4.6% of fortune 500 CEOs. In 2015, women held 17.9% of the board seats on Fortune 1000 companies, showing the disproportionate gender representation on corporate boards of directors. While the number of women on Fortune 500 corporate boards continues to rise, the average rate of increase is only one-half of one percent per year. One in nine in the Fortune 500 list still doesn't have any women on their board. As of 2014, nearly 60% of 22,000 global firms had no female board members, a little over half had no female C-suite executives, and less than 5% had a female CEO. However, there is substantial variation amongst different countries: Norway, Latvia, Bulgaria, and Slovenia had at least 20% female representation in senior executives and board members while Japan had only 2% female representation in board members and 2.5% female representation in C-suite executives. A 2009 study of 2000 companies and 87000 directorships in the USA, found that, on average, the more female boards members, the lower company‚Äôs performance. Catalyst, a non-profit research organization, reported that having a higher percentage of women board directors was positively associated with companies‚Äô scores on four of six CSP (Corporate Social Performance) dimensions: environment, community, customers, and supply chain. Catalyst also found that there is a positive correlation between companies‚Äô board diversity and philanthropic giving. A recent report conducted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics has found that having more women in overall executive positions correlated to greater profitability at organizations: \\"Going from having no women in corporate leadership (the CEO, the board, and other C-suite positions) to a 30% female share is associated with a one-percentage-point increase in net margin ‚Äî which translates to a 15% increase in profitability for a typical firm.\\" The idea of a women's work from home small business Ideas is to become a person who fulfills their personal needs and will soon become financially self-sufficient in the role of the role of the process. You are also a successful woman behind the majority of these small business ideas for women at home with tools and resources to get started. A woman entrepreneur always wishes to do some fruitful and positive work in the field of business and provides the values of family and social life. Given the projected talent deficit that will follow the retirement of millions of so-called 'Baby Boomer' managers and executives over the next 20 years, women leaders may be seen by an increasing number of employers as an untapped source of talent, experience and senior-management leadership. However, a 2018 study shows that female CEOs are 45% more likely to be fired than their male counterparts, even if they are doing a good job. Women as entrepreneurs Female entrepreneurship ranges from just over 1.5 percent to 45.4 percent of the adult female population in the 59 economies included in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor research project. Although entrepreneurial activity among women is highest in emerging economies (45.5 percent), the proportion of all entrepreneurs who are women varies considerably among the economies: from 16 percent in the Republic of Korea to 55 percent in Ghana‚Äìthe only economy with more women than men entrepreneurs. A multi-year analysis shows that this gender gap has persisted across most economies for the past nine years (2002-2010). And in many emerging economies women are now starting business at a faster rate than men, making significant contributions to job creation and economy growth. Women are more likely to start businesses which focus on sustainability. Developing Countries A disproportionate share of women-owned business in developing countries today are micro, small or medium enterprises. Often they do not mature. This has negative for growth and poverty reduction. Understanding the specific barriers women's businesses face and providing solutions to address them are necessary for countries to further leverage the economic power of women for growth and the attainment of development goals.  Kazakhstan  In some emerging countries like Kazakhstan the governments support the development of women-led SME's. For example, Kazakhstan in cooperation with EBRD executes Women in Business program. The budget of the program is $50 million. Empowerment of Women in the Corporate Sector is an international forum held in Astana, Kazakhstan. 44 percent of all businesses in Kazakhstan are Women-owned and contribute to Kazakhstan's economic development and modernization. In order to support women and women's organizations with a view to sustainable and inclusive development, Kazakhstan held the OSCE-supported Second International Women‚Äôs Forum on Future Energy: Women, Business, and the Global Economy in August 2017. The conference also focused on the importance of teaching women new technologies as a form of social entrepreneurship.  Kenya  Kenya has also seen significant growth for women in business - encouraging entrepreneurship by women has been an important approach to poverty in Kenya. The government, with NGO support, has created many programs providing access to financial resources, loans, and entrepreneurial education. Two examples are the Women's Enterprise Fund enacted in 2007 and the creation of the Women's University of Science and Technology. The Women's Enterprise Fund allows women greater access to small loans and financial services, such as bank accounts. The Women's University of Science and Technology, which is the first all women's university in Kenya, allows women access to higher education and entrepreneurial training. These type of programs have empowered women to create small to medium-size enterprises, such as in tailoring and bead-making. Kenyan society has also seen some shift in women's roles from caretakers to business owners, as called for in Vision 2030 - the Kenyan government's initiative to empower women, to achieve greater gender equality, economic growth, and to alleviate poverty. However, it is shown that in order for more women in Kenya to become entrepreneurs they must first be allowed their basic rights as women, such as proper healthcare and security. As more than 47% of the Kenyan population falls under the poverty line (the majority of these being women), they will also have to find ways to gain more capital through inclusive financial resources and limited credit discrimination in order to jump start their small-sized business.  Ghana  In some other African countries like Ghana, some women such as Ayisha Fuseini have benefited from grants or sponsorship from NGOs and big business like Camfed and the Mastercard Foundation‚Äôs Innovation Bursary Program (IBP) and became entrepreneurs in their own right.Graphic Business, Ayisha Fuseini: The 'Shea' strength of Asheba Enterprise by Elikem Kuenyehia (Monday, April 30, 2018) (Retrieved 25 April 2019)Global Cosmetics News, THE BODY SHOP SHEA BUTTER SUPPLIER AYISHA FUSEINI NAMED FEMALE ENTREPRENEUR OF THE YEAR AT THE INVEST IN AFRICA AWARDS by Georgina Caldwell, February 23, 2018, (Retrieved 25 April 2019) Developed Countries  United Kingdom  A surge in the number of women starting businesses in the UK has narrowed the so-called ‚Äúenterprise gap‚Äù between male and female company owners in the past decade.

United States The number of women-owned businesses in the United States is growing at twice the rate of all firms. Currently around 30% of US firms are majority-owned by women. Affirmative action has been credited with \\"bringing a generation of women into business ownership\\" in the United States, following the 1988 Women's Business Ownership Act and subsequent measures. Progress has been much slower in most other developed countries. In the UK, for example, it is estimated that just 15% of firms are majority-owned by women. Most of the African-Americans in business were men, however women played a major role especially in the area of beauty. Standards of beauty were different for whites and blacks, and the black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. Beauticians could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, black beauticians were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because, \\"Inside black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization.\\" Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast in the black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges.Blain Roberts, Pageants, Parlors, and Pretty Women: Race and Beauty in the Twentieth-Century South (2014), quote p 96. online review; excerptSusannah Walker, Style and Status: Selling Beauty to African American Women, 1920-1975 (2007). excerpt The most famous entrepreneur was Madame C.J.

Since European contact, Cherokee military activity has been documented in European records. Cherokee tribes and bands had a number of conflicts during the 18th century with European colonizing forces, primarily the English. The Eastern Band and Cherokees from the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) fought in the American Civil War, with bands allying with the Union or the Confederacy. Because many Cherokees allied with the Confederacy, the United States government required a new treaty with the nation after the war. Cherokees have also served in the United States military during the 20th and 21st centuries. Traditional military leadership Before the 18th century, Cherokee political leadership (much like that of the neighboring Muscogee and Natchez tribes) was dual or shared by two chiefs: \\"white\\" (peace) and \\"red\\" (war) leaders. During a conflict, the red chief would organize young men into war parties. He was assisted by a deputy chief, a speaker and messengers. Decisions were made by a war council composed of delegates from the seven Cherokee clans. War women, including the \\"beloved woman\\" (Ghigau), could participate in the council or accompany war parties. Scouts and medicine men would round out the war party.Sturtevant, 346 War of the Cherokee and Chickasaw with the Shawnee (1710) Around 1710 the Cherokee and the Chickasaw forced their enemy, the Shawnee, north of the Ohio River.Vicki Rozema, Footsteps of the Cherokees, pp. 10‚Äì11. During the 1660s, the Cherokee had allowed a refugee group of Shawnee to settle in the Cumberland Basin when they fled the Iroquois during the Beaver Wars. The Shawnee were also a buffer against the Cherokee, traditional Chickasaw enemies. The Cherokee allowed another group of Shawnee to pass through their territory to settle on the Savannah River, where they would be a buffer against the Catawba. More Shawnee (allied with the French) entered the region, attracting the attention of the Iroquois, and the British-allied Cherokee and Chickasaw decided to act in concert to expel the Shawnee from their territory. The conflict lasted from 1710 to 1715, and sporadic warfare continued for more than 50 years. In 1768, the Shawnee and Cherokee forged a peace treaty. Tuscarora War Except for limited trading contact, the Cherokee were relatively unaffected by the presence of European colonists in North America until the Tuscarora War. In 1711, the Tuscarora began attacking colonists in North Carolina after diplomatic attempts to resolve grievances failed. The governor of North Carolina asked South Carolina for military aid. Before the war ended several years later, South Carolina sent two armies against the Tuscarora. Both were composed primarily of Indians, especially Yamasee troops. The first army, commanded by John Barnwell, campaigned in North Carolina in 1712. By the end of the year a fragile peace existed, and the army dispersed; no Cherokee were involved in the first army. Hostilities between the Tuscarora and North Carolina broke out soon afterwards. In late 1712 to early 1713, a second army from South Carolina fought the Tuscarora. At the start, this army commanded by Colonel James Moore consisted of 33 Carolina militiamen and over 900 native warriors of various tribes. As the campaign progressed through North Carolina, Moore's army was reinforced to over 100 militiamen and native troops dwindled to over 700 warriors. Like the first army, the second depended heavily on the Yamasee and Catawba; this time, however, hundreds of Cherokee also joined the army. The campaign ended after a Tuscarora defeat at Hancock's Fort, and over 1,000 Tuscarora and allied Indians were killed or captured. The prisoners were primarily sold into the Indian slave trade. Although the second army from South Carolina disbanded soon after the battle, the Tuscarora War continued for several years. Some previously-neutral Tuscarora became hostile, and the Iroquois entered the dispute. Many Tuscarora ultimately moved north to live among the Iroquois. The Tuscarora War altered the geopolitical context of colonial America in several ways, increasing Iroquois interest in the south. For the many southeastern natives involved, it was the first time so many had collaborated on a military campaign and their first glimpse of how the English colonies differed. As a result, the war helped bind the region's Indians and enhanced their communication and trade networks. The Cherokee became more closely integrated with the region's Indians and Europeans. The Tuscarora War began an English- Cherokee relationship which, despite occasional breakdowns, remained strong for much of the 18th century. Destruction of Chestowee The Tuscarora War also marked the rise of Cherokee military power, demonstrated in the 1714 attack and destruction of the Yuchi town of Chestowee (in today's Bradley County, Tennessee). English traders Alexander Long and Eleazer Wiggan instigated the attack with deceptions and promises, although there was a preexisting conflict between the Cherokee and the Yuchi. The traders' plot was based in the Cherokee town of Euphase (Great Hiwassee), and primarily involved local Cherokees. In May 1714, the Cherokee destroyed Chestowee. Surviving inhabitants who were not captured fled to the Creek or the Savannah River Yuchi. Long and Wiggan told the Cherokee, falsely, that the South Carolina government supported the attack. When he heard about the deception the South Carolina governor sent a messenger to tell the Cherokee not to continue the attack on the Yuchi, but the messenger arrived too late to save Chestowee. The Cherokee attack on the Yuchi ended with Chestowee, but it caught the attention of every tribe and European colony in the region. Around 1715, the Cherokee emerged as a major regional power. Yamasee War In 1715, as the Tuscarora War was winding down, the Yamasee War broke out and a number of tribes launched attacks in South Carolina. The Cherokee participated in some attacks, but were divided over which course to take. After South Carolina's militia drove off the Yamasee and the Catawba, the Cherokee became pivotal; South Carolina and the Lower Creek tried to enlist Cherokee support. Some Cherokee favored an alliance with South Carolina and war on the Creek, and others favored the opposite. The impasse was broken in January 1716, when a delegation of Creek leaders was murdered at the Cherokee town of Tugaloo, and the Cherokee launched attacks against the Creek. Peace treaties between South Carolina and the Creek were forged in 1717, undermining Cherokee commitment to war. Hostility and sporadic raids between the Cherokee and Creek continued for decades,Oatis, pp. 187‚Äì8 culminating with the Battle of Taliwa in 1755 at present-day Ball Ground, Georgia with the defeat of the Muscogee Creek. The Creek had already withdrawn most of their settlements from what is now North Georgia to create a buffer zone between themselves and the Cherokee. In 1721 the Cherokee made their first cession of land to the British, selling the South Carolina colony a small strip of land between the Saluda, Santee and Edisto rivers. Moytoy of Tellico was chosen as \\"Emperor\\" by the elders of the principal Cherokee towns in 1730 at Nikwasi. Alexander Cumming had requested this to gain control of the Cherokee. Moytoy agreed to recognize King George II of Great Britain as protector of the Cherokee. Seven prominent Cherokee (including Attakullakulla) traveled with Cumming to England, and the Cherokee delegation spent four months in London. Their visit resulted in the 1730 Treaty of Whitehall, an alliance between the British and the Cherokee. The journey to London and the treaty were important to future British-Cherokee relations, but the title of Cherokee Emperor had little influence with the tribe. Although Moytoy's son Amouskosette tried to succeed him as \\"Emperor\\" in 1741, the power in the Overhill country had shifted to Tanasi and then to Chota. The Cherokee \\"empire\\" was essentially ceremonial, with political authority remaining town-based for decades afterward, and Cumming's aspirations to play an important role in Cherokee affairs failed. In 1735, the Cherokee were estimated to have 64 towns and villages and 6,000 fighting men. In 1738-39, smallpox was introduced to the country by sailors and slaves. An epidemic broke out among the Cherokee (who had no natural immunity), and nearly half their population died within a year; hundreds of others, disfigured by the disease, committed suicide.  War with the Muskogee-Creeks  The conflict between the Cherokee and the Muscogee was over disputed hunting grounds in what is now North Georgia, lasting from 1753-1755. It culminated in victory for the Cherokee after the Battle of Taliwa. Anglo- Cherokee War (1759‚Äì61) peace mission as a token of friendship after the Anglo-Cherokee War. Timberlake later brought three Cherokee warriors (pictured) to London in 1765. After hearing reports of French fort-building plans in Cherokee territory (as they had Fort Charleville at the Great Salt Lick, now Nashville, Tennessee), the British built forts of their own: Fort Prince George near Keowee (in South Carolina), and Fort Loudoun, near Chota, in 1756. That year the Cherokee aided the British in the French and Indian War, but serious misunderstandings between the allies quickly arose. In 1760 the Cherokee besieged both British forts, forcing a relief army to retire at the Battle of Echoee and eventually capturing Fort Loudoun. The British retaliated by destroying 15 Cherokee communities in 1761, but a peace treaty was signed by the end of the year. King George III's Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbade British settlement west of the Appalachian crest, attempting to temporarily protect the Cherokee from encroachment, but enforcement was difficult.Rozema, pp. 17‚Äì23. The Cherokee and Chickasaw continued to war intermittently with the Shawnee along the Cumberland River for many years; the Shawnee allied with the Lenape, who remained at war with the Cherokee until 1768. War with the Chickasaw and major land cessions in 1763 After their success against the Muscogee, the Cherokee turned their attention west, to the hunting grounds of the Chickasaw in what is now northeast Alabama from 1758 to 1769. After eleven years of intermittent warfare, they were defeated at the Battle of Chickasaw Old Fields. Watauga Association Following the 1771 Battle of Alamance which ended the Regulator movement, many North Carolinians refused to take the new oath of allegiance to the British Crown and left the colony. One, James Robertson, led a group of 12 or 13 Regulator families westward from the area of present-day Raleigh. Believing that they were in the colony of Virginia, they settled on the banks of the Watauga River in present- day northeastern Tennessee. After a survey indicated their error, they were ordered to leave. Cherokee leaders in the region interceded on their behalf, and they were allowed to remain if there was no further encroachment. In 1772, Robertson and the pioneers (who had settled along the Watauga, Doe, Holston and Nolichucky Rivers) met at Sycamore Shoals to establish a regional government known as the Watauga Association.Watauga Petition ; Ensor Family Pages. Transylvania Purchase In response to the first attempt by Daniel Boone and his party to establish a settlement inside their Kentucky hunting grounds, the Shawnee, Lenape (Delaware), Mingo and some Cherokees attacked a scouting and forage party which included Boone's son. This sparked Dunmore's War (1773‚Äì1774), named after the governor of Virginia. In 1775 a group of North Carolina speculators led by Richard Henderson negotiated the Treaty of Watauga at Sycamore Shoals with Overhill Cherokee leaders (chief of whom were Oconostota and Attakullakulla), in which the Cherokee gave their Kain-tuck-ee (Ganda'gi) lands to the Transylvania Land Company. The treaty disregarded claims to the region by other tribes, such as the Shawnee and Chickasaw. Area residents formed the Washington District, allying with the North Carolina colony for protection. Dragging Canoe, chief of Great Island Town (Amoyeli Egwa) and son of Attakullakulla, refused to accept the deal: \\"You have bought a fair land, but there is a cloud hanging over it; you will find its settlement dark and bloody\\".Evans 1997, p. 179. The governors of Virginia and North Carolina repudiated the Watauga treaty, and Henderson fled to avoid arrest. Second Cherokee War Charles Bird King's Tah-Chee (Dutch), A Cherokee Chief (1837), from the History of the Indian Tribes of North America In 1776 the Shawnee chief Cornstalk led a delegation from the northern tribes to the southern tribes and met with Cherokee leaders at Chota, calling for united action against those whom they called the Long Knives. At the end of his speech he offered his war belt, and Dragging Canoe (Tsiyugunisini) and Abraham of Chilhowee (Tsulawiyi) accepted it. Dragging Canoe also accepted belts from the Odawa and the Iroquois, and Raven of Chota Savanukah accepted the Lenape war belt. The Middle Towns were to attack South Carolina, the Lower Towns Georgia, and the Overhill Towns Virginia and North Carolina. The Overhill Cherokee was disastrous, particularly for those under Dragging Canoe against the Holston settlements because the settlers had been warned by Beloved Woman Nancy Ward. Abraham of Chilhowee could not take Fort Watauga, and Savanukah did no real military damage. After the failed raids, Dragging Canoe led his warriors to South Carolina to join the Lower Towns attack. North Carolina sent 2,400 troops, including Rutherford's Light Horse cavalry, to scour the Middle Towns; South Carolina and Georgia sent 2,000 men to attack the Lower Towns. More than fifty towns were destroyed; houses and food were burned, orchards destroyed and livestock slaughtered. Hundreds of Cherokees were killed, and survivors were sold as slaves. Virginia sent a large force and North Carolina sent volunteers to the Overhill Towns. Dragging Canoe, who had returned with his warriors, ordered the Cherokee towns burned, women, children and the elderly moved south of the Hiwassee River and the Virginians ambushed at the French Broad River. Oconostota advocated peace at any price, supported by the rest of the older chiefs. Dragging Canoe and his followers moved southwest as those from the Lower Towns poured into North Georgia. The Virginia force found Great Island, Citico (Sitiku), Toqua (Dakwa), Tuskeegee (Taskigi), and Great Tellico deserted, with only the older chiefs remaining. Christian, commander of the Virginia force, limited the reprisal in the Overhill Towns to the burning of deserted towns. In 1777 the Cherokee in the Hill, Valley, Lower, and Overhill Towns signed the Treaty of Dewitt's Corner with Georgia and South Carolina and the Treaty of Fort Henry with Virginia and North Carolina, agreeing to stop warring and ceding the Lower Towns in return for protection from attack. Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars George Catlin's C√≥l- lee, a Band Chief (1834) Dragging Canoe and his band migrated to the area near present-day Chattanooga, Tennessee, establishing eleven new towns (four of which were named for towns on the Little Tennessee River: Toqua, Citico, Tuskeegee and Chota). He made his headquarters in the town of Chickamauga, which lent its name to the surrounding area; frontiersmen and colonists called his band the Chickamauga, although they were never a separate tribe. Dragging Canoe began a guerrilla war which lasted nearly two decades and terrorized the western frontier, from the edge of the Muscogee nation north to the Ohio River and east into Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Because of Chickamauga Cherokee activity, frontiersmen, colonies and states launched punitive raids against the Cherokee (usually the Overhill Towns). However, large forces invaded the Chickamauga area in 1777 and destroyed all eleven towns. After another invasion in 1782 Dragging Canoe and his people moved further west and southwest to what became known as the Five Lower Towns, west of the Cumberland Mountains and below the navigation hazards in the Tennessee River Gorge. Because of their new location and additional populations from the Lower Towns people, he and his people began to be known as the Lower Cherokee. Their headquarters was not invaded again until the final year of the wars. Around this time that Dragging Canoe, now based in Running Water Town (Amogayunyi, present-day Whiteside, Tennessee), began to cooperate with the Upper Muscogee‚Äîusually as separate forces but sometimes combining for large operations. The Shawnee and other northern tribes were allies, and the Shawnee sent warriors to fight with his band. Chiksika and his younger brother, Tecumseh, were members of a Shawnee war party which remained for nearly two years. The Cherokee responded in kind, sending warriors north. As Dragging Canoe and his fellows in the other southern tribes were forming a coalition to fight the Americans with the aid of the British, the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783. He went south to Pensacola, receiving support from the West Florida Spanish to continue his war and maintaining relations with the British governor at Detroit. The 1788 murder of Old Tassel, headman of the Overhill Cherokee and chief of the Cherokee, and several other pacifist chiefs invited by the State of Franklin, outraged the Cherokee. More joined the Chickamauga Cherokee in their raids or carried out raids of their own. Franklin sent a large force to invade the Five Lower Towns, which was defeated at the foot of Lookout Mountain. Dragging Canoe raised an army of over 3,000 Cherokee and Muscogee which split into war bands, some of which were hundreds strong. Four more years of frontier warfare ensued. Dragging Canoe returned to his hometown in 1792 after a long diplomatic trip in which the Lower Muscogee and Choctaw accepted his invitation to join the war; the Chickasaw declined. After a large dance at Lookout Mountain Town (Utsutigwayi or Stecoyee, present-day Trenton, Georgia) celebrating his diplomatic success and a recent raid by The Glass and his brother Turtle-at-Home on the Cumberland River into Kentucky, Dragging Canoe was found dead. He was succeeded as leader of the Lower Cherokee by Old Tassel's nephew, John Watts, assisted by Bloody Fellow and Doublehead. Watts quickly renewed the alliance with Spain through West Florida and shifted his headquarters to Willstown (present-day Fort Payne, Alabama). The next year, he sent a delegation to Knoxville (capital of the Southwest Territory) to seek a peace. This delegation (which included his deputy, Doublehead) was attacked. Watts raised an army of over one thousand Cherokee, Muscogee and Shawnee. Although they were thwarted at Knoxville, they destroyed several smaller settlements along the way. Activities at one, Cavett's Station, set in motion rivalries which would dominate Cherokee affairs into the 19th century. The following autumn (1794) General Robertson, military commander of the Mero District (as the Cumberland River settlements were called) in the Southwest Territory received word that the Lower Cherokee and Muscogee planned large- scale attacks on his region. He sent a large force of U.S. army regulars, Mero District militia and Kentucky volunteers south. The force destroyed Nickajack, one of the Five Lower Towns, and Running Water without warning. Most of the towns' population was at a stickball game several miles south, at Crow Town. That incident and the defeat that summer of the army of their northern allies under the Shawnee Blue Jacket and the Miami Little Turtle convinced Watts and his fellow leaders that the end of the wars was inevitable. The Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse, ending the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars, was signed on November 7, 1794. After the wars After the peace treaty, the Lower Cherokee leaders dominated national affairs. When the original Cherokee Nation was founded, the first three people to hold the office of Principal Chief‚ÄîLittle Turkey (1794‚Äì1801), Black Fox (1801‚Äì1811), and Pathkiller (1811‚Äì1827)‚Äîhad served as warriors under Dragging Canoe (as had the first two speakers of the Cherokee National Council: Doublehead and Turtle-at-Home). Former Chickamauga warriors such as Bloody Fellow, the Glass and Dick Justice dominated the nation's political affairs for the next twenty years; although they were conservative, they embraced many aspects of acculturation. The Lower Cherokee had their governmental seat at Willstown, in the Lower Towns (south of the Hiwassee River, along the Tennessee to the northern border of the Muscogee nation and west of the Conasauga and Ustanali in Georgia). The Upper Towns were north and east, between the Chattahoochee and Conasauga. The seat of the Upper Towns was at Ustanali (near Calhoun, Georgia). It was also the titular seat of the nation, with former warriors James Vann and his prot√©g√©s, The Ridge (formerly known as Pathkiller) and Charles R. Hicks‚Äîthe Cherokee Triumvirate‚Äîtheir leaders (particularly of the younger, more-acculturated generation). The leaders of these towns were the most progressive, favoring acculturation, formal education and modern farming methods. Cherokee settlements in the highlands of western North Carolina, known as the Hill Towns with their seat at Quallatown, and the lowland Valley Towns (with their seat at Tuskquitee) were more traditional. So was the Upper Town of Etowah, inhabited mainly by full-bloods and the nation's largest town. When the Cherokee Nation began to be pressured to migrate westward across the Mississippi, Lower Cherokee leaders were the first to leave; the remaining Lower Towns leaders, including Young Dragging Canoe and Sequoyah (George Guess), were the strongest advocates of migration. The domination of the nation's external affairs by former warriors lasted until an 1808 revolt by the young Upper Towns chiefs, which unseated Black Fox and the Glass until the reunification council at Willstown the following year abolished regional councils.McLoughlin, pp. 33‚Äì167.Wilkins, pp. 28‚Äì51. Alliance with USA against Mvskokee/Creek 1814 The Battle of Horseshoe Bend (also known as Tohopeka, Cholocco Litabixbee, or The Horseshoe), was fought during the War of 1812 in the Mississippi Territory, now central Alabama. On March 27, 1814, United States forces and Indian allies under Major General Andrew Jackson defeated the Red Sticks, a part of the Creek Indian tribe who opposed American expansion, effectively ending the Creek War. American Civil War Eastern band Out of gratitude to William Holland Thomas, the western North Carolina Cherokee served in the American Civil War as part of what became known as the Thomas Legion of Cherokee Indians and Highlanders. Thomas' legion consisted of infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The legion mustered about 2,000 Cherokee and white men to fight for the Confederacy, primarily in Virginia; their battle record was outstanding.Will Thomas. \\"History and culture of the Cherokee (North Carolina Indians)\\" 2007-03-10 Thomas' legion and the Western District of North Carolina, under Brigadier General John Echols (of which it was the only effective unit), surrendered after capturing Waynesville, North Carolina on May 9, 1865 when they learned about Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. The decision to surrender was Echols', the senior commander; Thomas wanted to keep fighting. They agreed to cease hostilities if they could their arms for hunting. Brigadier General Stand Watie, commanding officer of the First Indian Brigade of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi and Principal Chief of the Confederate Cherokee, demobilized his forces under a cease-fire agreement with the Union commander at Fort Towson (in Choctaw Nation territory) on July 23, 1865. Western bands The Civil War was devastating for the Western Cherokee, who fought on both sides. After their forced removal from their southern homelands to the Indian Territory, the Cherokee were wary of the south; however, the Confederacy wooed them with promises of autonomy and land security. In 1861 the Confederacy had three regiments of Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek and Seminole soldiers, who fought in the 1862 Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas. Stand Watie Because of Native alliances with the Confederacy, the 10th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Infantry (5,000 Union soldiers commanded by Colonel William Weer) swept through the Indian Territory in the summer of 1862. They fought the Confederacy at Locust Grove in the Cherokee Nation on July 2, 1862. On July 16 Captain Greeno's 6th Kansas Cavalry captured Tahlequah, the Cherokee Nation capital. On July 19 Colonel Jewell's 6th Kansas Cavalry captured Fort Gibson, a strategic port.Britton, Wiley. \\"Battles and Leaders of the Civil War‚Äù, Civil War Home, retrieved 21 Sept 2009 Cherokees, Muscogee Creeks, and Seminoles joined Union regiments organized by William A.

Most Cherokee traditionalists supported the abolition of slavery, opposed the South and formed an association known as the Pin Indians, identifying themselves with a pair of crossed pins under their coat lapels.Conley, p.174 Principal Chief John Ross tried to keep the Cherokee Nation out of the war, issuing a proclamation of neutrality in 1861. Stand Watie, who supported the Confederacy, challenged Ross' authority. On May 21 of that year, the Cherokee held a council attended by over 4,000 men. Most who were present supported the South, and Ross conceded to maintain tribal unity. The South seemed to be winning the war at the time, and Union politicians voiced anti-Indian sentiments. In October 1861, Ross signed a treaty with the Confederate States of America.Conley, 175 Union troops captured him during the summer of 1862; he was paroled, and spent the rest of the war in Washington and Philadelphia working to convince the Cherokee Nation government to remain loyal to the Union. \\"We are all Americans\\", Native Americans in the Civil War.

His work has been shown in over fifty museums nationally and internationally and he is the recipient of two National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships. Goin is currently a Foundation Professor of Art in Photography and Videography at the University of Nevada, Reno. He has also done extensive rephotography work in the Lake Tahoe region. Biography Peter Goin was born in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1951. He grew up a third culture kid, spending time in Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil as a child and young adult. Goin received his MA and MFA from the University of Iowa. He moved to Nevada in 1984. He became fascinated with the basin-and-range environment‚Äîmuch of Nevada belongs to the Bureau of Land Management and is removed from private ownership making it open for camping, exploring, and photographing. The focus of his work is the American West and specifically the Nevada landscape. University of Nevada Reno Art Faculty Page Intrigued by the effects of humans on the landscape, Goin uses photography to depict landscapes that have been altered. In his book Nuclear Landscapes, Goin presents photographs of various nuclear test sites and power facilities that have been abandoned and the effects these sites and facilities have on the surrounding area. He gained unprecedented access to test sites and facilities in Nevada, Washington, and the South Pacific (as well as risked exposure to radiation and shark attack) in order to examine these unique places. This project investigates and documents evidence of the cultural modification of nuclear landscapes, and includes images at the Nevada Test Site, the Hanford Nuclear Site, the Trinity Site, and the Marshall Islands. Goin, Peter. Nuclear Landscapes. 1st ed. George F. Thompson. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991. Additional series of work include his photographic survey of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican border: Tracing the Line, a survey of the border from Brownsville, Texas, to Tijuana, Mexico, that investigates the relationship of the border line to the landscape, including how the boundary line divides the landscape and whether there is a distinction between the human-made and natural landscape; Artists Website Humanature, in which Goin explores and documents the extent to which people and nature have become a continuum;Goin, Peter.

Goin's video work has also garnered acclaim. He earned the Best Experimental Documentary Award at the 2001 New York International Film & Video Festival for his video Structures of Everyday Life. Structures weaves together narrative and visual vignettes from months of videotaping a group of Reno, Nevada teens, showing adolescents speaking their views and expressing their desire for acceptance. The program was aired by PBS in 2001. American Public Television Other videos of Goin's include In Search of Ritual: The Burning Man, which interprets the Burning Man art festival through multiple voices and viewpoints of participants at the 1993 event. In Search of Ritual: The Burning Man was nominated for an EMMY in 1994. Goin has coauthored numerous books as well as served as an editor for several texts.

It is also known as the James Burnside Plantation and Lerch Farm. The plantation is located southeast of the intersection with Eaton Road, on Schoenersville Road.  History  James Burnside bought a tract of land from John Stephen Benezet in 1748. Burnside sold a group of Moravians in 1751. In 1758, Burnside's widow sold the remaining to the Moravian Church. The Church leased the plantation to individual farmers from 1765 to 1845. The plantation was sold to Charles A. Luckenbach, who sold it to William Lerch in 1853. It stayed in the Lerch family until 1928, when it sold and was divided between the Hafleighs and the Birks. Lehigh County bought the plantation in 1986 and leased it into the private corporation Historic Bethlehem Museums & Sites \\"to restore, develop, and manage [it] as a living and natural history resource\\". It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 2, 1990. The museum is an affiliate within the Smithsonian Affiliations program. Today the farmstead hosts a variety of events, volunteer projects, venue rentals, historic tours, and festivals. Visitors can tour the farmhouse and the barns and learn about the daily lives of the early people who lived here.

Career Jay Tummelson was the top-ranked RPGA Judge, when Don Bingle and Linda Bingle brought him on as a third owner of their company 54¬∞40' Orphyte after they purchased the product rights for Pacesetter Ltd's games. Tummelson met Darwin Bromley of Mayfair Games through his connection with 54¬∞40' Orphyte, and joined Mayfair Games in 1995, spending the next two years licensing German games under the direction of Bromley so that Mayfair could produce new American versions; under Tummelson, German classics such as Grand Prix, Modern Art, Manhattan, Streetcar, and The Settlers of Catan were published in the United States for the first time in 1996. After Tummelson was laid off from Mayfair, he founded Rio Grande Games in 1998, which became the major publisher of eurogames in the United States for many years, by taking the approach of using the same artwork and components as the original games and sharing the cost of printing with the European publishers. Tummelson sold his shares in 54¬∞40' Orphyte sometime after founding Rio Grande Games, leaving the Bingles once more in sole charge of their company.

The head figure and musical director of the band is solo guitarist Esa Pulliainen. History Founding of Agents Agents was founded in 1979 on the ruins of Tuomari Nurmio's band K√∂yhien yst√§v√§t. All former members of K√∂yhien yst√§v√§t, with the exception of Tuomari Nurmio, played in the original Agents. The band also recruited Esa's brother Kai Pulliainen and keyboard player Jukka Ollila. The lead singer was Pekka Rytk√∂nen, nicknamed Beat-Pete. With this configuration Co-operating with Badding Agents started co-operation with Rauli \\"Badding\\" Somerjoki in autumn 1981, which also meant the end of Beat-Pete's career in Agents. Jukka Ollila was also replaced by Petri Rantala. The band's first album, Ikkunaprinsessa, was published in 1982. The album included the hits \\"Ikkunaprinsessa\\", \\"Kuihtuu kes√§inen maa\\" and \\"Muista hyvi√§ aikoja\\". Agents participated in the lyrics and music of the album. The next album, T√§hdet, t√§hdet, was published in 1983. The title song of the album became one of Badding's best known hits. Other hits from the album include \\"Nukkuja kaunein\\", \\"Y√∂n hiljaisuudessa\\" and \\"Kun aika rient√§√§\\". Esa Pulliainen arranged almost all music in the album. The last album made in co-operation with Somerjoki, Laivat, was published in 1985. On the album, Agents plays under the alias The Young Beats. Hits from the last Badding album include \\"Laivat\\", \\"Illan varjoon himme√§√§n\\", \\"L√§hd√∂n hetkell√§\\" and \\"Tahdon\\". Co-operation with Badding ended in 1985. During his last years, Badding performed with various bands, but Laivat was his last album. Agents had already been performing on and off with Topi Sorsakoski, who now became the official lead singer of the band. The keyboard player also resigned from the band alongside Badding. Topi Sorsakoski & Agents Topi Sorsakoski contributed vocals to four studio albums during his first tenure with Agents. With Topi Sorsakoski as their primary lead singer, Agents went on to record their next studio album In Beat in 1985. The album, produced by Pedro Hietanen, was released in 1986 and it topped the Finnish album charts. In Beat was a commercial success and it was certified double platinum in Finland. The album provided hit songs \\"Surujen kitara\\", \\"Salattu Suru\\", \\"Eeva\\" and \\"Olen yksin\\". In the next year, the band published another hit album, Besame Mucho. To the surprise of many, Besame Mucho doesn't feature on the album, instead the name is a trick played on purpose by Agents and Topi Sorsakoski. Hits from the album include \\"Kaksi kitaraa\\", \\"Kauan\\" and \\"Valot\\" (Badding's song as an instrumental version). In 1988, the band published their third album, Pop. The third album also sold well. Hits from the album include \\"Tyhj√§√§\\", \\"Varjojen y√∂\\", \\"On kes√§y√∂\\", \\"Jo riitt√§√§\\" and \\"Nyt kaikki muuttunut on\\". In 1989, Agents did not publish a new album. The EMI record company decided to publish a collection album called Greatest Hits, which the band did not like. The collection album sold well and reached a gold record. In 1990, Agents' and Topi Sorsakoski's last album, Half and Half, was published. Half of the album contains sung material and the other half contains Agents' rautalanka music. Topi Sorsakoski & Agents split up in 1992 because of internal arguments. Topi had published his solo album Yksin√§isyys in 1991, which anticipated the end of the co-operation. One of the reasons was Topi Sorsakoski's financial troubles in the early 1990s, and he would have wanted higher commissions from their performances and records. In common with Topi Sorsakoski, the assisting guitarist Hans Ethol√©n and the drummer Juha Takanen, both of which had been playing in the band since the K√∂yhien yst√§v√§t days, also quit the band. Agents & Jorma K√§√§ri√§inen In 1992, Esa Pulliainen invited Jorma K√§√§ri√§inen as the lead singer of Agents. The band also got a new drummer, Heikki Sandr√©n. The keyboard player on the albums was J-P Virtanen. The first album, Agents Forever, was published in 1995. Hits included \\"Antaudun\\", \\"T√§hti kaukainen\\" and \\"Pikku Mona\\". The next album, Agents Is Back!, was published in 1996. Hits included \\"Moskovan valot\\", \\"Salainen rakkaus\\" and \\"Salaper√§inen\\". The third album, Agents Is More!, was published in 1997. The album also contained Agents' rautalanka music. Hits included \\"P√§ivin √∂in\\", \\"Sin√§ vain\\", \\"Valot\\" (Badding's song as a new version), \\"My babe\\", \\"King Creole\\" and \\"Min√§ kuljen\\". The fourth album, Agents Is Best!, was published in 1998. Hits included \\"Illan varjoon himme√§√§n\\", \\"Muistan kes√§n\\" and \\"Olen syyt√∂n\\". Agents started a TV show called Laulava syd√§n on YLE TV2. In 1999, a double album with the same name was published, featuring many other artists, such as Ville Valo, Pate Mustaj√§rvi, Marko Haavisto, Topi Sorsakoski and Reijo Taipale. The album reached a gold record. In 2001, the album Agents is... here! was published. The album also contained Agents' rautalanka music. In 2001, the rock album Agents is... rock! was published. Hits included \\"Hound dog\\", \\"Move it\\" and \\"Teenage Dolly\\". In 2003, a new album, Agents is... tonight was published. Hits included \\"Jos n√§in ei koskaan\\", \\"Fever\\" and \\"Peli√§ vain\\". In 2004, a co-operation album with The Boys, called Pop Show, was published. The album was accompanied with common concerts in the next summer all over Finland. Hits from the common album included \\"Tahdon saaren\\", \\"Yyterin twist\\", \\"Takaa ajatusten virran\\" and \\"Leningrad\\". In November 2004, the second collection album from Jorma K√§√§ri√§inen and Agents was published. The album contains five new releases from Agents. ...Is best vol. 2 reached a platinum record, 30 thousand sold records, in June 2005. On 13 September 2006, the seventh and currently the latest studio album from Jorma K√§√§ri√§inen and Agents, ...Is Allright, was published. In October 2006, Agents announced they were withdrawing from playing and recording for a long while. The lead singer Jorma K√§√§ri√§inen currently performs as a solo artist and published his new solo record, Yhden t√§hden hotelli, in spring 2007. Topi Sorsakoski's comeback as lead singer of Agents Topi Sorsakoski returned as lead singer of Agents for one album and one tour. In autumn 2007, a new Agents album, based on material released by the 1960s British rock band The Renegades, was published. Topi Sorsakoski & Agents also performed a small tour accompanying the album. Instrumental album On 13 August 2008, a new studio album, Agents... Is Beat! - Instrumental 2008 Recordings was published. The album consists solely of instrumental music. Agents & Vesa Haaja On 26 August 2008, the band announced they had hired a new lead singer, Vesa Haaja. Born in 1968, Vesa \\"Vesku\\" Haaja is a Finnish musician and vocalist who had previously sung in the band Whistle Bait as well as in The Barnshakers and in Hi-Fly Rangers. The band was also joined by the saxophone player Juho Hurskainen. The most recent album releases of Agents have been credited to Agents & Vesa Haaja, the first being On Stage / In Studio in 2012 followed by Sound on Sound in 2014. Music Agents' repertoire consists practically completely of songs originally written and performed by others. There are many reasons for Agents' popularity, but the most important ones are well chosen songs, Slavic melancholy, the lyrical guitar sound of the band's leading figure Esa Pulliainen, and the well-executed compositions he has made. After recruiting K√§√§ri√§inen, the band has shifted its repertoire to focus more on rock'n'roll, which does not appeal to everyone. The melancholy longing feel has not been completely forgotten though, and the band is still popular at dance venues.

They played their home games at Woodward Field in Cheney, Washington. The team finished 8‚Äì4 (6‚Äì2 Big Sky) and improved on their record from 2008 in which they finished 6‚Äì5. Matt Nichols Nichols now has twelve 300-yard passing games in his 35-game career and 14 performances with at least 300 yards of total offense. On EWU's career passing lists, Nichols ranks in the top five in all categories, including second in total offense (9,376) and second in passing yards (8,786) The record holder for both passing yards and total offense is 2005 Payton Award winner Erik Meyer (2002‚Äì05) with 10,261 passing yards and 10,942 yards of total offense. Meyer is the player Nichols replaced in 2006 as Eastern's starting quarterback. Nichols now owns the school record with 1,150 career pass attempts, and also ranks fifth in efficiency rating (136.0), second in touchdown passes (63, ranking only behind the 84 of Meyer), second in completions (698) and third in interceptions (40). With 590 rushing yards in his career, Nichols is approaching the EWU career record for a quarterback of 681 set by Meyer. Nichols has been a part of four of the 36-longest pass plays in school history of 70, 78, 80 and 85 yards, but just the 80-yarder was a touchdown. Nichols has the most starts among returning players in 2009 with 33. At the beginning of the 2009 season Nichols was again, named to the Walter Payton Award watchlist.

But it wasn't that easy the rest of the way in EWU's 35‚Äì14 non-conference college football victory against Western Oregon Saturday (September 5) at Woodward Field in Cheney, Washington The Eagles, ranked 18th in the preseason NCAA Football Championship Subdivision rankings, scored 14 fourth-quarter points on a pair of Matt Nichols-to-Nathan Overbay touchdown passes as they survived for the win over the NCAA Division II Wolves. #10 California Matt Nichols throwing a pass against Cal. Eastern Washington scored on an 83-yard drive in the first quarter, but the California Bears performed as advertised after that to score 52 unanswered points and record a 59‚Äì7 victory over Eastern Washington Saturday (September 12) at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, California. In a match-up between the Big Sky Conference and the Pacific-10 Conference, Eastern entered the game ranked 18th in the Sports Network FCS poll. Cal, meanwhile, was ranked 10th in the Associated Press poll in the NCAA Football Bowl Division and represented the second- highest ranked team EWU has ever played (West Virginia was sixth when they beat EWU 52‚Äì3 in 2006). Heisman Trophy candidate Jahvid Best rushed for 144 yards on 17 carries and scored twice for the Golden Bears, who are now 2‚Äì0. The Eagles, now 1‚Äì1, were out-gained 392‚Äì14 on the ground.

INS Kochi has been built under the code name of Project 15 Alpha. Construction The keel of Kochi was laid on 25 October 2005. In keeping with the tradition of the Navy, the warship was launched by Madhulika Verma, wife of Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Nirmal Kumar Verma, at 11.20 a.m. 18 September 2009 from the Mazagon Dock in Mumbai. For the first time, Mazagon Docks used a \\"pontoon assisted\\" launching method in collaboration with a Russian firm Baltisky Zavod. Under this method, pontoons are welded to the hull, which give buoyancy and helps overcome tidal constraints. Mazagon plans to use this method for all future ship launches, as the process makes it possible to launch ships with much higher weight.

Some African nations such as Zambia have a vast internal consumer demand for second-hand clothes or hand-me-downs from rich nations in North America and Europe. The clothes arrive in these local markets in large bales or packages and are then cut open so buyers can sort through them and pick what article they like the most. The Salaula industry faces many criticisms. One is that it tends to disturb the internal textile industry. Local textile business cannot compete with cheap used clothes coming from abroad. Defendants of the industry argue that market demand should dictate what is fair or not. Another criticism is towards the profit companies are generating from these clothes since these clothes were originally donated to non-profit organizations such as Goodwill. Defendants of the practice argue that non-profit organization must sell these donations in order to acquire money necessary to fund their social projects.

In 1975, the City of St. Marys, the local Chamber of Commerce, and the Gilman Paper Company, assisted by numerous clubs and individuals, initiated an effort to preserve and restore the building. Work began in 1978 using skilled but unemployed high school students because the historic grant required the use of unemployed laborers, which the coordinators were unsuccessful at organizing. The project was highly successful and completed in 1980. In 1982, Naval Reserve Commander John K. Mott completed an extensive restoration plan for the property. Due to limited available of funding, very few of his recommendations were implemented. In 1983, a group of Navy Reservist Seabees took part in repair and reconstruction activities during their summer active duty session.
