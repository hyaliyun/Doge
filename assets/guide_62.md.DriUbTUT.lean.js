It has played a significant role in Anglican Church organisation in ways that are different from other Christian denominations. The title is very old and arises from the medieval arrangement where priests were appointed either by a secular lord, by a bishop or by a religious foundation. Wherever there is a vicar he shares the benefice with a rector (usually non-resident) to whom the great tithes were paid. Vicar derives from the Latin \\"vicarius\\" meaning a substitute. Historically, Anglican parish priests were divided into rectors, vicars and (rarely) perpetual curates. These were distinguished according to the way in which they were appointed and remunerated. The church was supported by tithes: taxes (traditionally of ten percent) levied on the personal and agricultural output of the parish. Origin of the term vicar Parish churches in England originated as the personal property of (predominantly lay) patrons; who had the right to appoint and dismiss the parish priest, to receive an entrance fee on appointment, and to charge an annual rent thereafter.Knowles, David The Monastic Order in England Cambridge University Press, 1940, p.593 By the Gregorian reforms of the 11th century, almost all these rights were extinguished for lay patrons, who were able to retain the sole residual power to nominate the rector to a benefice, and many lay notables thereupon gave up parish churches into the ownership of religious houses; who were less inhibited by canon law from extracting fees and rents from rectors, and who could moreover petition for exemption from most such laws by papal dispensation.Knowles, David The Monastic Order in England Cambridge University Press, 1940, p.597 Around 40% of rectories in England passed into monastic possession. Initially it had not been unusual for religious houses in possession of rectories also to assume the capability to collect tithe and glebe income for themselves, but this practice was banned by the decrees of the Lateran Council of 1215. Thereafter, over the medieval period, monasteries and priories continually sought papal exemption from the Council's decrees, so as to be able to appropriate the income of rectoral benefices to their own use. However, from the 13th century onwards, English diocesan bishops successfully established the principle that only the glebe and greater tithes could be appropriated by monastic patrons in this manner; sufficient lesser tithes had to remain within the parochial benefice to ensure a competent living; the incumbent of which thenceforward carried the title of vicar.Knowles, David The Religious Orders in England, Vol II Cambridge University Press, 1955, p.290 By 1535, of 8,838 rectories in England, 3,307 had thus been appropriated with vicarages;Knowles, David The Religious Orders in England, Vol II Cambridge University Press, 1955, p.291 but at this late date, a small sub-set of vicarages in monastic ownership were not being served by beneficed clergy at all. In almost all such instances, these were parish churches in the ownership of houses of Augustinian or Premonstratensian canons, orders whose rules required them to provide parochial worship within their conventual churches; for the most part as chapels of ease of a more distant parish church. From the mid-14th century onwards the canons were able to exploit their hybrid status to justify petitions for papal privileges of appropriation, allowing them to fill vicarages in their possession either from among their own number, or from secular stipendiary priests removable at will; arrangements which corresponded to those for their chapels of ease.Knowles, David The Religious Orders in England, Vol II Cambridge University Press, 1955, p.292 Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the rectors and vicars of parishes formerly in monastic possession continued in post, their sources of income unaffected. Rectors received both greater and lesser tithes, vicars the lesser tithes only. Lay grantees of monastic lands also took over the monasteries' rights of nomination to monastic rectories. For monastic vicarages, the right to the greater tithes and to nominate a vicar also generally passed into the hands of lay owners, known as impropriators. Perpetual curates were appointed to the unbeneficed parishes and chapels of ease formerly in the possession of the canons. These received no tithe income, and originally impropriators were required to provide a fixed stipend; although generally the function of paymaster was eventually taken over by the diocese. If, in later years, a newly created parish was carved out of a larger rectoral or vicarial parish, the incumbent would be legally a perpetual curate, but would commonly be styled \\"vicar\\" in common use. Great and small tithes In legislation, the Act for the True Payment of Tithes of 1548, the great tithes are described as those of corn (that is all cereal crops), hay and wood; and the small tithes as the remainder. All such tithes were originally paid in kind. Each instance of appropriation, however, was established for an individual parish; and so there was wide local variation. Vicarial (small) tithe frequently included hay and wood; rectoral (great) tithe sometimes included wool (especially in rich wool-producing areas) as well as corn. Otherwise the main components of the small tithe, apart from wool, were milk, eggs, dairy produce and the young of animals raised as food; lambs, piglets, calves, goslings. Since animal young rarely arrived in exact multiples of ten, local custom commonly established cash adjustments to round the tithe value up or down. All or part of the tithed items might have been commuted by local custom to a fixed cash payment; which, following the inflation of the 16th century, reduced commuted tithes to a fraction of their former value. By the 17th century, many such vicarages had become so poor that there was no prospect of filling them; and the parish might find their cure of souls effectively annexed in plurality to a neighbouring vicarage or rectory, the parishioners consequently being offered at best infrequent opportunities for worship at their own parish church.  Act of Parliament  An Act of Parliament of 1868 permitted perpetual curates to style themselves vicars and the term parson rapidly lost popularity. The conjunction of this change with near-contemporaneous church reforms aimed at reducing the disparities of income among clergy meant that the distinction between the grades of clergy became progressively less relevant and remarked upon. Popularly, any member of the clergy is often referred to as a vicar, even when they do not legally hold such a post. In the past a similar situation led to all clergy being popularly referred to as parsons.  Parishes in England and Wales  Most parishes in England and Wales retain the historical title for their parish priest‚Äîrector or vicar‚Äîwith vicar being more common in the urban areas, because of an expansion of new parishes being created in the Victorian years, and the incumbents being styled 'vicar' after 1868. The distinction between the titles is now only historical. In the late 20th century, a shortage of clergy and the disparity of workload between parish clergy led to the development of a number of new forms of parish ministry. In Wales prior to Disestablishment, most parishes in the southern dioceses (St. Davids and Llandaff) were vicarages subject to lay patronage, whereas in the north rectors predominated, largely nominated by the bishops of Bangor and St Asaph.  Team rector and Team vicar  One of these new forms, which has proved relatively effective, is the team ministry or benefice. Under this arrangement, a number of parishes conjoin to form a team, in which each parish retains its legal definition and independence. Rather than having clergy licensed to the individual parishes, a team of clergy are licensed to the entire benefice. Alternatively, a large parish, with daughter churches in addition to a parish church, may be created as a team ministry. In these examples, one incumbent-level priest is regarded as \\"first among equals\\", takes the title team rector and serves as parish priest in one or more parishes (often the larger), while one or more priests of incumbent status, who may or may not be stipendiary, serve as team vicars. Team vicars are often installed into other parishes within the team. Other clergy‚Äîperhaps part time stipendiary or non-stipendiary‚Äîand those in training positions are formally assistant curates and are often known as team curate or, for instance, associate priest. Until the introduction of Common Tenure, team rectors and team vicars were not appointed as perpetual parish priests, and as such did not possess the freehold but were licensed for a fixed term, known as leasehold, usually seven years for a team rector, and five years for a team vicar. With the introduction of Common Tenure most parochial clergy have similar terms of appointment and there is less distinction in terms of \\"employment\\" rights between Team clergy and other incumbents than hitherto.  Other Anglican provinces  In many other Anglican provinces, the distinction between a vicar and a rector is different. In the Church of Ireland and the Scottish Episcopal Church, most parish priests are rectors. In the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, a vicar is a priest in charge of a mission, meaning a congregation supported by its diocese instead of being a self-sustaining parish which is headed by a rector.  Ulster  In early 17th-century Ulster every church had a vicar and a parson instead of a co-arb and an erenagh. The vicar, like the co-arb, was always in orders. He said the mass ('serveth the cure') and received a share of the tithes. The parson, like the erenagh, had a major portion of the tithes, maintained the church and provided hospitality. As he was not usually in clerical orders, his responsibilities were mainly temporal. However, there were differences in the divisions of the tithes between various dioceses in Tyrone. In the Diocese of Clogher, the vicar and the parson shared the tithes equally between them; in the Diocese of Derry, church income came from both tithes and the rental of church lands ('temporalities'). The vicar and the parson each received one third of the tithes and paid an annual tribute to the bishop. In places where there was no parson, the erenagh continued to receive two thirds of the income in kind from the church lands, and delivered the balance, after defraying maintenance, to the bishop in cash as a yearly rental. In other places, the parson, the vicar and the erenagh shared the costs of church repairs equally between them. In the Diocese of Armagh the parson received two-thirds of the tithes and the vicar one third. The archbishop and the erenagh impropriated no part thereof, presumably because they received the entire income from the termon lands. The division of responsibilities between vicar and parson seems to derive from a much earlier precedent established in the old Celtic Church of St Columcille.  Cultural associations The image of the parish vicar is a popular one in British culture. A popular British television series on BBC depicts a fictional woman vicar humorously in The Vicar of Dibley, and the story of The Vicar of Bray appears as a song and otherwise. Rev., another popular sitcom on BBC Two, explores the struggles of a former rural vicar as he copes with the demands of running an inner-city church.

It was a continuation of the Battle of Albert and is also referred to as the second phase of that battle. The British and Dominion attack was part of what was later known as the Allies' Hundred Days Offensive. The Second Battle of Bapaume was carried out over a period of two weeks and involved the divisions of IV Corps; the British 5th, 37th, 42nd, and the 63rd Divisions along with the New Zealand Division. On 29 August, elements of the New Zealand Division, after heavy fighting in the days prior, occupied Bapaume as the defending Germans withdrew. It then pushed onto the Bancourt Ridge, to the east of Bapaume. Background On 8 August 1918, the Hundred Days' Offensive commenced on the Western Front and it would prove to be the last major campaign of the First World War. It began with the Battle of Amiens, an attack by the Canadian and Australian Corps at Amiens, which rolled the German lines back . The advance petered out after four days after the Germans began to regroup and shore up their defences. The commander of the British Expeditionary Force, Field Marshal Douglas Haig, recognised that it was time to put pressure elsewhere on the German front and for this, decided to use General Julian Byng's Third Army. Haig decided that the Bapaume sector, with the town of Bapaume at its centre, was to be the new focus of operations. Bapaume Bapaume itself was a small town linked by rail to Albert and Arras. There were also four major roads running through the town; running to Albert in the south-west, to Peronne in the south-east; to Cambrai in the east and to the north lay Arras. Captured by the forces of Imperial Germany in the early stages of the war, it had been the focus of the British forces on the opening day of the Battle of Somme in 1916. Still in German hands, it had been largely destroyed in early 1917 following their withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. Extensive booby traps had also been left and these troubled the Australians that moved into the town afterwards. It was subsequently recaptured by the Germans during the Spring Offensive. The land surrounding Bapaume was relatively flat and thus was conducive to the use of tanks. Bapaume and surrounds, August 1918 Plan of attack Byng allocated the Third Army's IV Corps to the forthcoming operation, which was to become known as the Second Battle of Bapaume. IV Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General George Harper comprised five divisions, all of which would be employed during the battle. The first three to be involved were the New Zealand Division along with the 37th and 42nd Divisions. The other two divisions, the 5th and the 63rd Divisions, were held in reserve before being deployed later in the battle. Of all these divisions, only the New Zealand Division was at full strength. Facing the Third Army was the German 17th Army, commanded by General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry) Otto von Below, made up of eight divisions which, apart from the 4th Bavarian Infantry Division, were all second class formations. A further two divisions were in reserve. The battle was planned to have two phases. The first, what is now known as the Battle of Albert, was to be an attack across a front from the village of Puiseux towards the Albert‚ÄìArras railway. The New Zealand Division, commanded by Major General Andrew Russell, played a limited role in this action, being limited to the New Zealand Rifle Brigade supporting the main attack which was to be carried out by the 37th Division on 21 August. The New Zealanders, along with the 42nd Division, on its right, were expected to bring the right flank in line with the left. Then the 5th and 63rd were to pass through the lines of the 37th Division and move onto and beyond the Albert-Arras railway. The New Zealand Division and 42nd were to move forward and maintain the front line, which gradually narrowed, placing the New Zealanders in a valley with the high ground on either side occupied by its flanking British divisions. The second phase, scheduled to begin on 23 August, was to capture Bapaume and then advance further east to Reincourt-les-Bapaume and Bancourt-Fremicourt and the high ground beyond. The New Zealanders were to play a key role; the 1st and 2nd Infantry Brigades of the New Zealand Division, kept in reserve, were to be ready to exploit any breakthrough on the front. To distract the Germans from the main attack being carried out by the Third Army, the French Tenth Army conducted diversionary attacks to the south. Battle Albert‚ÄìArras railway The opening phase of the battle began on 21 August, when two battalions of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, covered by artillery and fog which reduced visibility to less than , moved forward and seized Puiseux, capturing over 100 prisoners. It established a new line beyond the village and secured the flanks of the neighbouring divisions making their own move forwards. The British 5th Division then passed through the brigade's positions to take over the advance. It struggled to take its objective of Achiet-le- Petit and a feature known as the Dovecot and assistance, in the form of patrols mounted by the Rifle Brigade battalions, was provided. Nonetheless, the 5th Division had advanced and took over 500 prisoners of war for relatively few casualties. Little progress was made the next day as Byng directed that the focus for the day was to simply consolidate the gains made and prepare for a further movement forward on 23 August. The relative inactivity of 22 August encouraged von Below in a belief that the attacks of the previous day were a failure. Seeking to take advantage, he arranged for counterattacks to be mounted by the 17th Army, and these resulted in the loss of Dovecot, which overlooked the New Zealand positions. The machine gun battalion of 42nd Division provided key support in driving off the counterattacks which, according to prisoners of war captured during the action, was launched by 52nd Infantry Division, largely made up of men from the Grand Duchy of Baden, which had newly arrived in the sector from Flanders. German prisoners carrying a wounded New Zealand soldier on a stretcher, Puisieux, 27 August 1918 The following day, 23 August, the 42nd Division attacked Dovecot; a battalion of Lancashire Fusiliers and the 10th Manchester Battalion, assisted by a battalion from the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, took the position after beginning their advance at 2:30 am. The New Zealanders also secured the flank of the 5th Division which attacked towards the village of Irles and then onto Loupart Wood and Gr√©villers. In the meantime, the 37th Division attacked and captured Bihucourt. As a result of the operations of 21‚Äì23 August, the frontline had been established to the east of the Albert- Arras railway line with all but one of the ridges to the south and west of Bapaume held by IV Corps. However, the 5th Division had been unsuccessful in its attacks which left the ridge running from Loupart Wood to Gr√©villers and then onto Biefvillers still in the hands of the Germans. Although over 2,000 prisoners of war had been taken during this period along with 25 field guns, the 5th Division had suffered 1,600 casualties by this stage of the battle. Advance onto Bapaume The New Zealand Division was tasked to capture Gr√©villers, held by two battalions of the Royal Bavarian 14th Infantry Regiment (Kgl. Bayerisches 14. Infanterie-Regiment), and then push into, and beyond, Bapaume, while the 37th Division, on the left of the New Zealanders, was to capture Biefvillers. The attack had two phases; the 1st Infantry Brigade was to capture Loupart Wood and Gr√©villers and establish a line about beyond. This would leave Bapaume and the high ground beyond to be captured in the second phase by the 2nd Infantry Brigade. Intelligence indicated that Bapaume was lightly held and the advance was to be supported by two brigades of artillery as well as thirteen Mark IV tanks and a company of Whippets. Most of the armoured support was intended to cover the 2nd Infantry Brigade in its advance, as the artillery support was primarily for the 1st Infantry Brigade. A Whippet tank crossing a trench near Grevillers, August 1918 The New Zealanders' attack began with a night-time advance on 24 August by the 1st Infantry Brigade to clear the approaches to Bapaume, including Loupart Wood and Gr√©villers. Brigadier General Charles Melvill, commanding the brigade, was directed to move onto Bapaume if it were able to do so quickly. However, progress was delayed by heavy machine gun fire and artillery took its toll on the supporting tanks allocated to the brigade. Furthermore, in contrast to the previous three days, the weather was poor. Despite this, Gr√©villers fell to the brigade along with 380 prisoners and several field guns. There were over 100 casualties among the attacking New Zealanders, including the commander of 2nd Auckland Battalion. It was planned that the 2nd Infantry Brigade would move past 1st Infantry Brigade once Gr√©villers was captured but it was forced into action early, when its commander, Brigadier General Robert Young, seeing that the 37th Division was struggling to take its objective of Biefvillers, decided to use his brigade to assist. Accordingly, two battalions cleared the village by 10:00 am although casualties were incurred when they were fired upon by some Whippet tanks. The commander of one of the attacking battalions, along with its padre, intervened and directed the tanks onto Biefvillers. With the village captured, this secured the flank of 1st Infantry Brigade. However, 2nd Infantry Brigade, now the leading formation in the IV Corps sector due to the slow advance of the neighbouring divisions, was exposed to German gunfire on three sides. German reinforcements were now arriving in the sector; the New Zealanders had captured several personnel from the 44th Reserve Division and a further eight divisions had also arrived. An counterattack by the Germans pushed the leading battalions back from Avesnes-l√®s-Bapaume, a hamlet to the northwest of Bapaume. Nonetheless, the New Zealand Division was well positioned to take Bapaume. The front line was now a line running east of Gr√©villers and Biefvillers, and was less than from the outskirts of Bapaume. Capture of Bapaume First attempt The plan to take Bapaume involved the 1st Infantry Brigade, positioned at Gr√©villers, moving to the south of Bapaume with the 63rd Division moving forward to protect the right flank of the New Zealanders. Meanwhile, the 2nd Infantry Brigade would move to the north of the town. Its left flank would be protected by the 37th Division. Their aim was to envelop Bapaume and force the Germans to abandon the town and thus avoid costly street to street fighting. The advance began at 5:00 am on 25 August under the cover of fog. Despite German artillery fire on the front lines, this caused relatively few casualties amongst the New Zealanders. In the south, the 1st Infantry Brigade's 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions skirted the southern side of Bapaume, taking fire from machine-gun posts on the outskirts of the town. They got as far as the Albert Road but the 63rd Division's advance was slowed by strong defence at the village of Thilloy, to the southeast of Bapaume. By the end of the day, this left the two New Zealand battalions exposed on both flanks. The New Zealanders dug in and conducted fighting patrols for the rest of the day. From several German prisoners it was determined that the 220th Prussian and 7th Bavarian Divisions were defending Bapaume. To the north, the 2nd Infantry Brigade, who began their advance from Biefvillers over ground which favoured the defenders. The brigade had artillery support, in contrast to their fellow brigade to the south, as well as 23 tanks, although these were delayed. The 1st Battalion, Canterbury Regiment, one of the two leading battalions, made good progress and reached their objective for the day by 7:00 am, at the intersection of the Albert and Arras Roads. The other leading battalion was the 1st Otago, who struggled. The tanks supporting the Otago men caught up with the advancing infantry but misidentified them as Germans and opened fire. Once this instance of friendly fire was identified, the tanks then began engaging the Germans but were soon knocked out. By then, the tanks had provided the 1st Otago Battalion the opportunity to reach their objective for the day, the Arras Road. They managed to link up with the 37th Division on their left although not with the 1st Canterbury Battalion on their right. To fill the gap, Brigadier General Young ordered up the 2nd Canterbury Battalion and all three battalions consolidated their positions. The German 111th Division attempted to mount a counterattack later in the day but the massing troops were spotted and attacked by British reconnaissance aircraft. The Germans were caught by an artillery barrage covering a hastily arranged advance, to begin at 6:30 pm, by the New Zealanders and the 37th Division. This easier advance cleared Monument Wood and the southern reaches of the village of Favreuil by the conclusion of the day. Among the 2nd Infantry Brigade there were nearly 500 killed, wounded or missing for the day such that the 2nd would play no further role in the battle. Although the planned envelopment of Bapaume had not happened, the day's action resulted in the capture of over 400 prisoners of war along with many machine guns and an artillery piece. Second attempt The New Zealanders continued their efforts to encircle Bapaume on 26 August, their flanks protected by the neighbouring 63rd and 5th Divisions. The New Zealand Rifle Brigade took over the attack in the north from the 2nd Infantry Brigade, while 1st Infantry Brigade was to carry on with its advance in to the south. Should the two brigades successfully link up to the east of Bapaume, they would attack into the town from there. However, little progress was made in the south. The 63rd Division was still struggling to capture Thilloy while the advance of the 2nd Wellington Battalion, the leading unit of the 1st Infantry Brigade, was checked by gunfire from Bapaume on its right and from its left. The Wellington men had to eventually withdraw to their starting positions. To the north, the New Zealand Rifle Brigade suffered the attention of German artillery even before beginning to move forward at 1:00 am. The attack did not begin until 6:30 am, when three battalions of riflemen began advancing. There had been no time to arrange a covering barrage and there was no armoured support. Despite heavy machine gun fire, all three battalions made their initial objectives but made little progress beyond these due to the strongly defended villages of St. Aubin and Beugn√¢tre, both to the northeast of Bapaume. Beugn√¢tre had been thought to have been captured by the 5th Division and thus the German presence in the village was unexpected. By 10:00 am, the attack had petered out and the battalions were consolidating their positions, during which they had to fend off a counterattack from Beugn√¢tre. On short notice, a further attack was arranged for the evening with the aim of pushing forward to the road to Cambrai, this time with a supporting artillery barrage. The 3rd Rifle Battalion of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, in a salient between Bapaume and St. Aubin, was to test the defences of the town with fighting patrols. The 2nd Rifle Battalion was to flank St. Aubin and advance for the Cambrai Road alongside 4th Rifle Battalion, which would also link up with 5th Division, which had the task of taking Beugn√¢tre. However, instructions to the attacking battalions were issued late and several companies did not receive their orders until the barrage had already commenced. Brigadier General Herbert Hart, commanding the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, realising the inadequacy of the preparation time, tried to cancel the operation but to no avail. Despite this, Beugn√¢tre did fall to the British; advancing under a covering barrage, the King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) penetrated the village relatively easily before encountering strong machine gun. Even so, the KOSB pushed the Germans out and this secured the outer flank of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. However, while the New Zealanders did reach the Cambrai road, they were unable to hold it and had to settle for securing the railway line to Cambrai instead, this line being a little to the west of the road. St. Aubin was also captured by the 2nd Rifle Battalion. Third attempt A German medical officer, detailed to attend the German wounded and who came to a New Zealand ambulance near the front line at Bapaume, with two New Zealand officers, 27 August 1918 The efforts of 26 August had seen the front line advanced by some along a frontage of . Bapaume was now encircled entirely from the north but less so from the south. Overnight, the German forces were ordered to retreat to positions to west of the Hindenburg Line. In the meantime, the complete envelopment of Bapaume was to be continued. On 27 August, 63rd Division continued its efforts to capture Thilloy which continued to inhibit the move forwards in the south. The New Zealanders were to avoid a direct assault on Bapaume; it was hoped that the German defenders would surrender once they had been fully encircled. The Rifle Brigade however continued to engage in fighting patrols, testing the German defences. Both Bapaume and Thilloy were heavily bombarded during the day but despite this Thilloy continued to hold out. The next day, the 42nd Division moved in to relieve the 63rd Division. Beginning to appreciate the fact that Bapaume may have to be directly attacked, Russell, encouraged by Harper, the commander of IV Corps, began drawing up plans to do so on 29 August, using the 1st Wellington Battalion, of 1st Infantry Brigade. However, it was still hoped that the Germans would withdraw on their own initiative. The bombardment on Bapaume continued into 28 August while 1st Infantry Brigade moved in close to the town on its southern frontage. Particularly heavy barrages were made during the evening and it was noted that the German response was relatively muted and by early in the morning of 29 August, there was no gun fire coming from Bapaume. Overnight, Bapaume had been abandoned, a state of affairs confirmed by patrols of the 3rd Rifle Battalion entering the town from the north. They observed retreating Germans making for Bancourt, to the east. Meanwhile, 2nd Auckland Battalion entered Bapaume from the south. Likewise, the Germans had retreated from Thilloy and the 5th Manchester Battalion, of 42nd Division, moved through the village and secured it. A section of New Zealand riflemen in newly captured Bapaume After the protracted fighting of the previous few days, Bapaume was now in the hands of the New Zealanders. Before the town was abandoned by the Germans, numerous booby traps had been set which had to be found and deactivated over the next days. In the meantime, the Rifle Brigade moved forward and established a new line east of Bapaume. A similar distance beyond this lay the villages of Fr√©micourt and Bancourt, to which the Germans had retreated. Continuing the advance The battle was not yet over for the New Zealand Division as it was ordered to continue to chase the Germans and secure the Bancourt Ridge, in front of which the villages of Bancourt and Fr√©micourt lay. The advance was renewed on 30 August, with two battalions of the 1st Infantry Brigade tasked with capturing Bancourt while the New Zealand Rifle Brigade was to take Fr√©micourt. They were then to push onto Bancourt Ridge. The 1st Rifle Battalion, with the assistance of a howitzer barrage on Fr√©micourt, cleared the village with 90 minutes of its 5:00 am start time. The leading companies then pushed onto the Bancourt Ridge. However, they had to withdraw as the 1st Infantry Brigade had not reached its sector of the ridge. In the course of their action, 400 prisoners had been taken and the front line advanced by . In the 1st Infantry Brigade's sector, a German artillery barrage caused some casualties among the assembling troops of the 1st Wellington Battalion. Likewise, 2nd Auckland Battalion, was also caught in the open. It had postponed its advance, scheduled for 5:00 am, because it was discovered that the neighbouring 42nd Division had not moved up sufficiently to cover its flanks. Despite this, the Wellington men secured their objective of the Bancourt Ridge, linking up with companies of the Rifle Brigade that were already there. When the Aucklanders did move off, at 6:00 am, they had lost the benefit of their own covering barrage and their efforts to take Bancourt village was slowed by machine gun fire. It was eventually seized by 8:00 am and the battalion pushed onto the ridge beyond. However, as the flanking 42nd Division had failed to take the village of Riencourt, its flanks were exposed and they, along with the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, had to retreat to the foot of the ridge. It was not until the early hours of 31 August that Riencourt fell to 42nd Division, after its 10th Manchester Battalion made a nighttime attack. At one point, a German field gun was captured and turned against them by a crew of gunners from the division's artillery brigade. New Zealand soldiers examining a German A7V tank captured at Fr√©micourt on 31 August 1918 At daybreak the same day, the Germans counterattacked the New Zealand positions with elements of three divisions; the 23rd Saxon Division, 16th and 4th Bavarian Infantry Divisions. The counterattack was supported by four A7V tanks which attempted to make for Fr√©micourt but then returned to their own lines. Mistaken for British armour, they were fired on by their own infantry. Two of these tanks were captured by the New Zealanders as they tried to evade the attentions of their countrymen. Although the German attack, later described as having \\"insufficiently preparation\\", did cause the New Zealanders to cede ground, they regained it later in the day. On 1 September, IV Corps began operations designed to capture Bancourt Ridge and allow the advance to continue. Under the cover of an artillery barrage, the 42nd Division, New Zealand Division, and 5th Division, from right to left respectively, would begin advancing at 4:55 am. As had frequently happened during the battle, the New Zealanders found themselves ahead of the flanking divisions. The New Zealand Rifle Brigade swiftly made the crest of the ridge, taking 70 prisoners. The 1st Infantry Brigade was a little slower; the 1st Wellington Battalion made the crest and consolidated itself there. The other battalion, 2nd Auckland, despite the assistance of two tanks, was unable to do the same. Operating on the extreme flank of the New Zealand Division's sector of the front, it suffered the most from the lack of progress of the 42nd Division and was unable hold its portion of the crest. That evening, the 2nd Infantry Brigade moved into the line, replacing both the New Zealand Rifle Brigade and 1st Infantry Brigade. Aftermath A view over Bapaume, taken by Henry Armytage Sanders the day after its capture, showing the huge amount of destruction to the town The 2nd Infantry Brigade took over the vanguard of the advance on 2 September, tasked with clearing the Germans from their positions overlooking Haplincourt. This they did after overcoming numerous machine gun nests, plus the guns of two disabled tanks being used as outposts. Over 350 prisoners of war were taken, along with 80 machine guns plus a field gun. Their advance was not as quick as that of the 42nd Division, making a corresponding move forward, which had made good progress and the British, until the New Zealanders caught up, had to lay down heavy suppressing fire on both flanks. The New Zealand Division now halted for a few days as pressure was being placed on the German lines elsewhere and the emphasis for IV Corps was now to pursue the enemy to the Hindenburg Line. On 9 September the New Zealand Division resumed its move forward, moving onto the outer defences of the Hindenburg Line, including Trescault Spur, which overlooked the German positions. Later that month, in conjunction with 37th Division and elements of the 38th Division, the New Zealanders attacked and captured the spur on 12 September. After this engagement, the New Zealand Division was withdrawn to Bapaume for a two-week rest and refit. During the period of its involvement in the Second Battle of Bapaume, there were over 11,000 casualties in IV Corps for an advance of over during which it took nearly 8,000 prisoners of war. In the New Zealand Division, over 800 personnel had been killed in action and over 2,300 wounded. It was one of the most costly engagements of the war for the New Zealanders. Among the British divisions involved, the 5th suffered over 4,200 casualties, while the 42nd incurred over 1,500.

The basilica is seat of the Archdiocese of Onitsha. It contains the relics of Blessed Cyprian Iwene Tansi, as well as the tombs of Bishop Joseph Shanahan and of the Archbishops Charles Heerey, Stephen Ezeanya and Albert Obiefuna. History In December 1935, when Bishop Joseph Shanahan arrived onitsha from Ireland to bless the edifice the newly built Cathedral that shanahan saw was heart stopping in its splendor. The basilica which was then the cathedral stands on elevated piece of land which is part of the 20 hectares made available for Fr. Lutz and his team by Obi Anazonwu and chiefs of Onitsha on 6 January 1886. Till 1930 what served as the central place of worship for the vicariate was the dual purpose building erected in 1914,the present holy Trinity primary school. The Holy Trinity cathedral was built between 1930 and 1935. In 1932, Bishop Shanahan handed over the mantle of leadership of the church to Bishop Charles Heerey on account of ill health especially the eyes. He retired and left for Ireland to allow the new Bishop a free hand. Shanahan was invited back for the jubilee and a major activity of the jubilee was the blessing of the cathedral. The cathedral like many other houses in Onitsha was battered during the Nigerian civil war. The post war reconstruction happened to collide with the early period of the recommendations of the Vatican ll council especially regarding the liturgy. So the church in Onitsha while repairing the damages to the Holy Trinity cathedral reconstructed it to be in tune with the new liturgy. In 1994, the Archbishop of Onitsha Albert kanenechukwu Obiefuna was transferred to Onitsha to take over the ailing Archbishop Stephen N. Ezeanya. Responding to the ever soaring number of worshipers who throng the Holy Trinity cathedral, Archbishop Obiefuna undertook to enlarge and expand accommodation in the cathedral. The conclusion of the modification was made to coincide with the centenary of the arrival of Bishop Shanahan in Onitsha. Thus on 5 December 2002 the work of the modification was brought to an end by the re-dedication of the reconstructed cathedral. The Holy Trinity cathedral has been a scene of many memorable occasions. Notable was the return and the reburial of the remains of Bishop Shanahan in 1956, Archbishop Heerey in 1967 and Archbishop Ezeanya in 1996 and Archbishop Obiefuna in 2011. An indisputably unique treasure in the cathedral is the relics of Blessed Michael Cyprian Iwene Tansi who was beatified by Pope John Paul ll in 1998. Holy Trinity cathedral was elevated and promoted to a minor Basilica by Pope Benedict XVI on 28 May 2007 under the episcopacy of Archbishop Valerian Maduka Okeke.

Allied use The airport was liberated by Allied ground forces about 10 August 1944 during the Northern France Campaign. Almost immediately, the USAAF IX Engineering Command 850th Engineer Aviation Battalion cleared the airport of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft. Runway bomb craters were filled with gravel or various types of debris and covered by Tarmac. Subsequently, Vannes/Meucon Airport became a USAAF Ninth Air Force combat airfield, designated as \\"A-33\\" about 29 August.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout As the airport was in the rear area when repaired and opened, the Americans used it as a defensive field, stationing the 425th Night Fighter Squadron, flying P-61 Black Widows from 18 August though 11 September 1944 flying night air defense missions. Once the Luftwaffe threat was diminished in the area, the night fighters were moved east and it became a resupply and evacuation airfield for casualties to be treated, prior to being moved to England or the United States.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . Current The airport was returned to French civil control after the war ended on 20 June 1945. The heavily damaged airport required much reconstruction, and the main runway was refurbished and repaved with asphalt. Today it remains a regional civil airport. The former secondary (13/31) runway is now a concrete parking apron and still shows some asphalt patches applied over wartime bomb craters left by the Eighth Air Force. A grass runway (08/26) is of postwar vintage.

This triad is typically personified by the Hindu goddesses Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati. In Shaktism, these triune goddesses are the manifestations of Mula-Prakriti or Devi.  As the feminine Trimurti  Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati Whereas in androcentric denominations of Hinduism the feminine Tridevi goddesses are relegated as consorts and auxiliary deities to the more eminent masculine Trimurti gods, in the Shaktidharma denomination the feminine Tridevi goddesses are given the eminent roles of Creatrix (Mahasarasvati), Preservatrix (Mahalaxmi), and Destructrix (Mahakali), with the masculine Trimurti gods being relegated as the auxiliary deities as agents of the feminine Tridevi.  As consorts of the Trimurti  Saraswati is the goddess of learning, arts, and cultural fulfilment, as well as the consort of Brahma, the creator. She is cosmic intelligence, cosmic consciousness, and cosmic knowledge. Lakshmi is the goddess of wealth, fertility, and material fulfilment, as well as the consort of Vishnu, the maintainer or preserver. However, Lakshmi does not signify mere material wealth, but also abstract prosperity, such as glory, magnificence, joy, exaltation, and greatness. Parvati, or in her demon-fighting aspect, Kali is the goddess of power, beauty, love, and spiritual fulfilment, as well as the consort of Shiva, the destroyer of evil or transformer. Together they form Adishakti. To kill the demon Mahishasura the tridevis took the form of Durga. Importance of Tridevi Shakti or Vimarsh is the power that is latent in pure consciousness, required to reach pure consciousness and essential to create, sustain and destroy. Just as Energy can never be created nor be destroyed, but changes from one form to another; Devi took many incarnations to do different tasks. God is both male and female. But all different forms of energy or powers of God are with the Trimurti in the form of Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi, and Mahakali. That is to say, a non-dimensional God creates this world through Srishti-Shakti (Mahasaraswati or Sound or knowledge), preserves through Sthiti-Shakti (Mahalakshmi or Light or resources), and destroys through Samhara-Shakti (Mahakali or Heat or Strength). It is also seen that God cannot create, generate or destroy because God does not possess any attribute. So True Energy or Adi Shakti does everything on God's behalf. The Tridevi outside India Via Buddhism and syncretism with Japanese Shinto deities, the Tridevi entered Japanese mythology as the goddesses Benzaitennyo ÂºÅË≤°Â§©Â•≥ (Sarasvati), Kisshoutennyo ÂêâÁ••Â§©Â•≥ (Laxmi), and Daikokutennyo Â§ßÈªíÂ§©Â•≥ (Mahakali).

The name comes from ≈°tedri, meaning charitable in old Slavonic, because the island offers two deep, well-protected coves. The Latin name of ≈†ƒáedro was Tauris from which derived the Italian Tauricola or Torcola. According to the Hvar Statute of 1331, the island was communal property and reserved for use as a pasture. The island is very fertile, and has a milder climate then Hvar and, thanks to night dew, was even used to grow grain. A Dominican monastery was founded in the Bay of Mostir (1465), together with a hospice for sailors, and abandoned in the 18th century.

The seizure of power by the Bolshevik revolutionaries unleashed an unprecedented wave of persecutions against the Roman Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, who were forced to cooperate during a time of distress. Situation at the end of World War I The end of World War I brought about the revolutionary development, which Benedict XV had foreseen in his first encyclical. With the Russian Revolution, the Vatican was faced with a new, so far unknown, situation. An ideology and government which rejected not only the Catholic Church but religion as a whole. \\"The Pope, the Tsar, Metternich, French radicals and German police, are united against communism\\" said Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.Communist Manifesto , 1848 The Historical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences wrote that the \\"reactionary policies of the Vatican\\" were an outgrowth of fear of socialism and hate of communism. Vatican seen as an ally of capitalism This fear turned the Vatican into an ally of capitalism. The Catholic Church is seen to have been in a 1000-year alliance with feudalism, just defeated in Russia.The Historical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences 1953, 461 In the words of Friedrich Engels, \\"the Church blessed the feudal order with the gloriole of divine blessings. Her hierarchy was ordered according to feudal principles. She is one of the greatest feudal exploiters.\\" Engels, die Entwicklung des Sozialismus von der Utopie zur Wissenschaft, ausgew√§hlte Schriften Berlin, 1953, 93 Communists taking their time The Communists took their time to get into Church issues, which were not a priority.

They even permitted the restoration of the Orthodox Patriarchate, which had been dormant for over 150 years.Clarkson, 493 Persecution of the Churches But with time, a persecution of the Churches, including the Catholic Church, began and intensified. All religion, \\"the opiate of the masses\\" Karl Marx was considered hostile to communism, but most of the revolutionary violence was oriented against the Russian Orthodox Church. The new regime began to interfere in spheres, so far reserved for the Church, by legalizing divorce, and issuing civil marriage certificates. Bloody repression of civilians, carried out under the auspices of the Polish Comrade Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky,he wrote to his wife, My thinking compels me to be merciless and I have the firm will to follow my thinking to the utmost.

The Patriarch was arrested. Most monasteries were suppressed, and \\"counter-revolutionary\\" religious were executed.Clarkson, 493, 572 Oppressed bishops plead to the Pope During the winter of 1918‚Äì1919, some \\"twenty bishops were murdered together with thousands of priests and religious\\".Schmidlin III 308Fr. von Lama, Papst und Kurie in ihrer Politik nach dem Weltkrieg, Illertissen, 1925, p.362 Some hope developed among the United Orthodox in the Ukraine and Armenia, but many of the representatives there disappeared or were jailed in the following years.

Plot  One winter's night in France, four racists, J.P., Berthon, Barjout, and Ren√©, set out to assault a local Arab man. The four follow him to a vacant parking lot outside of an apartment building, but the car they are in suddenly starts smoking, causing them to crash into a phone booth. Barjout is knocked unconscious, but the others are unharmed. As the remaining three are about to attack the quite fearless (albeit defenseless) Arab, a woman in the building threatens to call the police. Impersonating a police-officer, J.P. heads into the building to assuage the situation. When an Afro-French denizen accuses J.P. of lying, he becomes angered and begins insulting him, only to discover that the black man is a police commissioner. Meanwhile, Berthon and Rene are keeping watch of the Arab man. When Ren√© begins showing off his \\"skills\\" with nunchucks, one of the sticks detaches and hits Berthon in the head, knocking him out cold. As Ren√© tries to resuscitate Berthon, Barjout regains consciousness and decides to investigate what has happened. Upon seeing an apprehended J.P., Barjout threatens the black man at gunpoint. When J.P. tries to tell him that he is a commissioner, Barjout accidentally opens fire and kills J.P. Suddenly, he hears the disembodied voices of Berthon and J.P., and now the Arab man is speaking in Ren√©'s voice. Barjout awakens, realizing the events were nothing more than a nightmare he had while waiting in the car. The film ends with the four men beating and presumably killing the helpless Arab man.

Cutter heads (router bits) may be mounted in the spindle chuck. As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the cutters mold a profile into it. The machine normally features a vertical fence, against which the workpiece is guided to control the horizontal depth of cut. Router tables are used to increase the versatility of a hand-held router, as each method of use is particularly suited to specific application, e.g. very large workpieces would be too large to support on a router table and must be routed with a hand-held machine, very small workpieces would not support a hand-held router and must be routed on a router table with the aid of pushtool accessories etc.http://www.wonkeedonkeetrend.co.uk/router-tables/hand-held-routing-vs- stationary-routing/  Varieties  Router tables exist in three varieties: * floor standing machines * accessories bolted into table saws * small bench-top machines  Use  Router tables are used in one of three ways. In all cases, an accessory is used to direct the workpiece. # A fence is used, with the router bit partially emerging from the fence. The workpiece is then moved against the fence, and the exposed portion of the router bit removes material from the workpiece. # No fence is used. A template is affixed to the workpiece, and a router bit with a ball bearing guide is used. The ball bearing guide bears against the template, and the router bit removes material from the workpiece so as to make the workpiece the same shape as the template. # A \\"pin router\\" accessory is used. A pin router originally had a pin in the table that would trace the part and hung the router motor on an \\"over arm\\" that rose from one edge or corner of the router table, arced over the table, and descends directly (coaxially) towards the pin. This was a big safety concern as people's hand were very accessible to the cutter. In 1976 C.R. Onsrud patentedUS Patent for Inverted Pin Router the Inverted Pin Router that reversed the two and mounted the motor under the table and the guide pin on the \\"over arm\\". A template (with an interior recess on the top face removed) is affixed to the workpiece, and the guide pin is lowered into this recess. The template is then moved against the pin, carrying the workpiece against the spinning router bit and creating a duplicate of the patterned part.  History  Router tables evolved as shop improvised tools. Individual woodworkers began taking routers, mounting them in an inverted position beneath a table, and using the routers' depth adjustment to raise the bit through a hole in the table surface. Over time manufacturers began selling accessories (pre-made table tops, table legs, table inserts, fences, hold downs, vertical adjustment tools (\\"lifts\\"), etc. Finally, manufacturers began selling complete packages, such as the Inverted Pin Router, which put them in the business of effectively selling wood shapers, the very tool that shop improvised router tables were created as inexpensive substitutes for.

The men were mostly drawn from other infantry and police battalions in the Punjab and their class composition was Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras. For the next two years, the regiment remained engaged in suppressing the rebellion. The regiment took an active part in the Bhutan War of 1864‚Äì66, the Second Afghan War of 1878‚Äì80, the Chitral Expedition of 1895, and the Tirah Campaign of 1897.Lawford, James. (1972). 30th Punjabis. London: Osprey. Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 30th Punjabis. During the First World War, the 30th Punjabis served with distinction in the East African Campaign, while their 2nd Battalion, raised in 1918, served in the Palestine Campaign and fought in the Battle of Megiddo. During the war, 30th Punjabis raised two more battalions, which stayed in India. All war- raised battalions were disbanded after the war. Subsequent history In 1921‚Äì22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 16th Punjab Regiment, formed by grouping the 30th Punjabis with the 31st, 33rd and 46th Punjabis, and the 9th Bhopal Infantry. The battalion's new designation was 1st Battalion 16th Punjab Regiment. During the Second World War, the battalion fought in the Burma Campaign with great distinction. In 1947, the 16th Punjab Regiment was allocated to Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was merged with the 1st, 14th and 15th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment, and 1/16th Punjab was redesignated as 13 Punjab. In 1948, the battalion fought in the war with India in Kashmir, while during the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War, it fought in the Chhamb-Jaurian Sector.

It is closely related to mutual information; indeed, it is a simple linear expression involving the mutual information. Unlike the mutual information, however, the variation of information is a true metric, in that it obeys the triangle inequality.P. Arabie, S.A. Boorman, S. A., \\"Multidimensional scaling of measures of distance between partitions\\", Journal of Mathematical Psychology (1973) , vol. 10, 2, pp. 148‚Äì203, doi: 10.1016/0022-2496(73)90012-6 W.H.

Definition Suppose we have two partitions X and Y of a set A into disjoint subsets, namely X = \\\\\\\\{X_{1}, X_{2}, ..,, X_{k}\\\\\\\\} and Y = \\\\\\\\{Y_{1}, Y_{2}, ..,, Y_{l}\\\\\\\\}. Let n = \\\\sum_{i} |X_{i}= \\\\sum_{j} |Y_{j}|=|A|, p_{i} = |X_{i}/ n , q_{j} = |Y_{j}/ n, r_{ij} = |X_i\\\\cap Y_{j}/ n. Then the variation of information between the two partitions is: :\\\\mathrm{VI}(X; Y ) = - \\\\sum_{i,j} r_{ij} \\\\left[\\\\log(r_{ij}/p_i)+\\\\log(r_{ij}/q_j) \\\\right]. This is equivalent to the shared information distance between the random variables i and j with respect to the uniform probability measure on A defined by \\\\mu(B):=|B|/n for B\\\\subseteq A. Explicit information content We can rewrite this definition in terms that explicitly highlight the information content of this metric. The set of all partitions of a set form a compact Lattice where the partial order induces two operations, the meet \\\\wedge and the join \\\\vee, where the maximum \\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{1}} is the partition with only one block, i.e., all elements grouped together, and the minimum is \\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{0}}, the partition consisting of all elements as singletons. The meet of two partitions X and Y is easy to understand as that partition formed by all pair intersections of one block of, X_{i}, of X and one, Y_{i}, of Y. It then follows that X\\\\wedge Y\\\\subseteq X and X\\\\wedge Y\\\\subseteq Y. Let's define the entropy of a partition X as :H\\\\left( X\\\\right)\\\\,=\\\\,-\\\\sum_i\\\\,p_{i}\\\\log p_{i}, where p_{i}=|X_i|/n. Clearly, H(\\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{1}})=0 and H(\\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{0}})=\\\\log\\\\,n. The entropy of a partition is a monotonous function on the lattice of partitions in the sense that X\\\\subseteq Y\\\\Rightarrow H(X) \\\\geq H(Y). Then the VI distance between X and Y is given by :\\\\mathrm{VI}(X,Y)\\\\,=\\\\,2 H( X\\\\wedge Y )\\\\,-\\\\,H(X)\\\\,-\\\\,H(Y). The difference d(X,Y)\\\\equiv |H\\\\left(X\\\\right)-H\\\\left(Y\\\\right)is a pseudo-metric as d(X,Y)=0 doesn't necessarily imply that X=Y. From the definition of \\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{1}}, it is \\\\mathrm{VI}(X,\\\\mathrm{1})\\\\,=\\\\,H\\\\left(X\\\\right). If in the Hasse diagram we draw an edge from every partition to the maximum \\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{1}} and assign it a weight equal to the VI distance between the given partition and \\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{1}}, we can interpret the VI distance as basically an average of differences of edge weights to the maximum :\\\\mathrm{VI}(X,Y)\\\\,=\\\\,|\\\\mathrm{VI}(X,\\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{1}})\\\\,-\\\\,\\\\mathrm{VI}(X\\\\wedge Y,\\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{1}})|\\\\,+\\\\,|\\\\mathrm{VI}(Y,\\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{1}})\\\\,-\\\\,\\\\mathrm{VI}(X\\\\wedge Y,\\\\overline{\\\\mathrm{1}})\\\\,=\\\\,d(X,X\\\\wedge Y)\\\\,+\\\\,d(Y,X\\\\wedge Y).

Tram services ended in 1936, trolleybus services in 1963, while bus operations continued until the company was privatised in 1988. History City of Portsmouth Passenger Transport Department (CPPTD), otherwise known as Portsmouth Corporation Transport, was formed by Act of Parliament in 1898, allowing Portsmouth Corporation to take over the existing horse-drawn tramways in Portsmouth. The right to purchase the existing tramways was exercised in January 1901 and the system closed whilst it was converted to electric traction, being completed in September 1901. However, horse traction did not end completely and continued on the Hilsea to Cosham line until May 1903. The compulsory purchase of all of the lines of the Portsmouth Street Tramways Company within the borough, left the company with a short stub line from the boundary at Hilsea to Cosham. The parent company, The Provincial Tramways Company, extended the line to Waterlooville and reopened as the Portsdown and Horndean Light Railway on 2 March 1902. Through working later took place, until Southdown purchased the company in 1935, then shut the line down. Trolleybuses replaced trams for the first time on the South Parade Pier to Cosham route on 4 August 1934 followed quickly by replacement of trams with trolleybuses on the other routes. The last tram was No. 106 and ran on 10 November 1936. Portsmouth Corporation Transport continued to operate the trolleybuses officially until 27 July 1963 (although it did operate trolleybuses on late evening services 17/18 and 19/20 for a few weeks afterwards), after which it continued purely as a bus operator, until 1988, when it was privatised. Preservation A 1934-built AEC661T Trolleybus For many years, vehicles of Portsmouth Corporation Transport were preserved at the City of Portsmouth Preserved Transport Depot (CPPTD), based at the Broad Street bus depot in Portsmouth. Zoned for redevelopment, this site closed in 2003. Many vehicles were dispersed, but the CPPTD found a new home at Wicor Farm in Portchester and some of the vehicles have been returned. Unfortunately access to the new location is only by appointment, but some members of the collection have been used for free trips along Southsea seafront in the summer, since 2008. The body of a Portsdown and Horndean Light Railway tram survives at the Old Kiln Light Railway where it has been incorporated into a station building.

During the mid- to late-2000s, he made a series of disclosures about UBS Group AG clients, in violation of Swiss banking secrecy laws, to the U.S. government alleging possible tax evasion. Known as the 2007 \\"Birkenfeld Disclosure\\", the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it had reached a deferred prosecution agreement with UBS that resulted in a US$780 million fine and the release of previously privileged information on American tax evaders. In the United States, he was convicted by the DOJ for a single charge of fraud conspiracy and served 40 months in a federal penitentiary from 2010 to 2012 with a fine of $30,000. After he applied for whistleblower status and protection, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) awarded him a settlement of $104 million through their Whistleblower Office. Early life and education Birkenfeld was born on February 26, 1965, in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. His father was a neurosurgeon. Birkenfeld attended Thayer Academy, a prep school, and graduated from Norwich University in Vermont in 1988. Birkenfeld is Jewish, his paternal grandfather, Max, emigrated to the United States from Romania in 1922. He obtained a master's degree at the American Graduate School of Business in La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland. Banking career Birkenfeld began his career in banking in the currency trading department of State Street Bank & Trust in Boston. Birkenfeld claims that he first blew the whistle on illegal activities while at State Street, approaching the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1994. The information did not lead to any indictments. He says that he turned down an offer to join the FBI after the incident, but that claim has been disputed. In 1996, he was hired as a private banker at Credit Suisse before moving on to Barclay's Bank in 1998. In October 2001, Birkenfeld began working at UBS in Geneva, Switzerland, again as a private banker offering wealth management services. His principal job responsibility was to solicit wealthy Americans to move their assets to the bank, enabling them to hide their funds due to Switzerland's strict banking secrecy laws and thus avoid paying U.S. taxes. According to Birkenfeld, UBS sponsored events like art shows and yacht races in the United States to attract wealthy people as potential clients.255x255px  Birkenfeld disclosure: 2005‚Äì2011  In United States After learning about UBS Switzerland AG dealings in the U.S., Birkenfeld resigned on October 5, 2005 and became a partner at Union Charter Ltd., where he specialized in wealth management. In 2007, he disclosed to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) what he knew about UBS's illegal practices attempting to take advantage the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, a law that could pay him up to 30% of any tax revenue recouped by the IRS. However, because he did not provide full and complete information to U.S. authorities, Birkenfeld was arrested in Boston on 7 May 2008 when he deplaned from Switzerland arraigned at the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida on 13 May. Birkenfeld resigned his position with Union Charter on 3 June 2008 after agreeing to plead guilty to not disclosing accurate information. As a private banker, Birkenfeld advised California real estate developer Igor Olenicoff, to evade U.S. taxes worth approximately US$200 million. Olenicoff subsequently pleaded guilty to tax evasion and paid a $52 million fine, but avoided a jail sentence. U.S. District Judge William Zloch charged him with a single count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and sentenced Birkenfeld to 40 months in prison and a $30,000 fine.\\"UBS whistle-blower gets 40 month-sentence\\", UPI, Aug. 21, 2009. \\"The judge socked it to Birkenfeld ....\\". Retrieved 2012-09-12. Birkenfeld served his time at the Schuylkill County Federal Correctional Institution from January 2010 to August 2012. In 2012, as a consequence of his whistleblower status, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) awarded him $104 million, 26% of the total $400 million in taxes returned. In Switzerland Birkenfeld is viewed as a criminal and a \\"traitor\\" by some members of the Swiss public and banking community as he broke the country's banking secrecy laws. Although he left Switzerland before he disclosed banking client information, had he remained a resident, he would have been prosecuted by Z√ºrich authorities for three and a half years in prison and commensurate fines. When asked if he would ever return to Switzerland, Birkenfeld stated: \\"I don't believe I will.\\" UBS announced that it would cease providing cross-border private banking services to U.S.-domiciled clients through its non-U.S. regulated units as of July 2008. After Birkenfeld's award, the Swiss newspaper Blick claimed, ‚ÄúBirkenfeld was a blessing for the Swiss financial industry,‚Äù in that his revelations helped accelerate the industry's transition away from its reliance on ‚Äúdirty‚Äù money by dooming the bank secrecy laws that enabled tax evasion. Birkenfeld has compared the Swiss banking industry with gangsters. \\"In essence, bank secrecy is analogous to criminal racketeering ‚Äî and the Swiss government, along with every Swiss private banker, is a co-conspirator.\\"  Post-banking life: 2015‚Äìpresent  Brad Birkenfeld's three-year period of parole ran through November 2015; a year previous Birkenfeld's attorney petitioned the U.S. District Court to allow Birkenfeld to travel abroad. While on parole, Birkenfeld engaged with a variety of charitable efforts: he allowed disadvantaged children to use his luxury suite at Boston Bruins hockey games and donated six electric bicycles to the Boston Police Department after the Boston Marathon bombings. In January 2015, Birkenfeld was subpoenaed by a French magistrate investigating the abetting of tax evasion and tax fraud by French citizens at UBS. In February 2015, he was allowed to travel to France from 27 February to 1 March 2015 to appear before the French court. The French court is investigating allegations that UBS marketed Swiss numbered bank accounts to French citizens to allow them to hide their assets.

In Canadian English, the term college usually refers to a technical, trades, college of applied arts or applied technology, or an applied science school. These are post-secondary institutions granting apprenticeships, certificates, diplomas, and associate's degrees. Terminology In English Canada, the term \\"college\\" is usually used to refer to trade and technical schools that offer specialized professional or vocational education in specific employment fields. They include vocational colleges, career colleges, community colleges, institutes of technology or science, technical schools, colleges of applied arts or applied technology, and in Quebec through coll√®ges d‚Äôenseignement g√©n√©ral et professionnel. There is a distinction between \\"college\\" and \\"university\\" in Canada. In conversation, one specifically would say either \\"They are going to university\\" (i.e., studying for a four-year degree at a university) or \\"They are going to college\\" (suggesting a vocational school). In American English, (and in formal British English as well) the word college is especially used for what Canadians would call the undergraduate level of a university, but in popular use it refers to all post secondary studies. Canadians, on the other hand, use the word university for undergraduate and graduate post-secondary studies exclusively. In Ontario and Alberta, and formerly in British Columbia, there are also institutions which are designated university colleges, as they only grant under-graduate degrees. This is to differentiate between universities, which have both undergraduate and graduate programs and those that do not. Quebec In Quebec, mostly with speakers of Quebec English, the term \\"college\\" is seldom used for post secondary education. Instead the word \\"CEGEP\\" ( or ) has become the more common term. CEGEP is a loanword from the French acronym C√©gep or C√âGEP (Coll√®ge d'enseignement g√©n√©ral et professionnel), meaning \\"College of General and Vocational Education\\". A CEGEP is a public college in the Quebec education system, offering either a two-year diploma, which allows on to continue onto university (unless one applies as a 'mature' student, meaning 21 years of age or over, and out of the educational system for at least two years), or a three-year diploma in a variety of trades and technologies (e.g. nursing, mechanical engineering or computer science).  Other uses  Institution within a university The term college also applies to distinct entities that formally act as an affiliated institution of the university, formally referred to as federated college, or affiliated colleges. A university may also formally include several constituent colleges, forming a collegiate university. Examples of collegiate universities in Canada include Trent University, and the University of Toronto. These colleges act independently, but in affiliation or federation with the university that actually grants the degrees. For example, Trinity College was once an independent institution, but later became federated with the University of Toronto, and is now one of its residential colleges. Occasionally, \\"college\\" may also refer to a subject specific faculty within a university that, and while academically distinct, do not operate in an autonomous manner as federated or affiliated. Examples of the word college used in this instance includes College of Education, College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Biological Science,http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbs/ among others. Private career colleges The registration and accreditation of private career colleges are regulated by Private Career College Acts for each province. In British Columbia for example, the Private Career Training Institutions Agency (PCTIA) is responsible for the registration and accreditation of private career college in British Columbia under the Private Career Training Institutions Act (SBC 2003, Chapter 79), Regulations (BC Reg.466/2004), an bylaws. Regulatory college Regulatory colleges also use the word college in reference to itself. Examples of such include the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. University-level institutions The Royal Military College of Canada is a military college that aims to train officers for the Canadian Armed Forces. However, the institution is a full-fledged degree- granting university, despite the use of the word college in its name. The institution's sister schools, Royal Military College Saint-Jean also uses the term college in its name, although it academic offering is akin to the standard definition of college in Canada. A number of post-secondary art schools in Canada formerly used the word college in their names, despite formally being universities, and having the authority to issue postgraduate degrees. However, most of these institutions were renamed or re-branded in the early 21st century, dropping the word college in favour of university. In 2003, the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design was renamed NSCAD University. In 2010, the Ontario College of Art and Design was re-branded as OCAD University, although formally its name was changed to the Ontario College of Art and Design University. The Alberta College of Art + Design was another post-secondary arts school that had the word college in its name. However, unlike NSCAD, or OCAD, it did not have the authority to grant postgraduate degrees, making its academic offerings akin to the standard definition of college in Canada. The Alberta College of Art + Design was formally granted university-status in 2019, and was subsequently renamed the Alberta University of the Arts to reflect its new status.

The term originated from a historical parallel secondary school system operated in Ontario, where two streams of secondary education were offered. Collegiate institutes offered academic education for prospective university students, whereas High Schools/Secondary Schools, offered vocational training for students planning to immediately enter the workforce. The education system was reorganized in the early 20th century, with the two secondary streams merged. After the merger, the terms Collegiate Institute, High School, and Secondary School were all used in conjunction to refer to secondary institutions in Ontario. Saskatchewan also modelled their secondary system after Ontario's two-stream model in the early 20th century. As a result, a number of secondary schools in Regina, and Saskatoon are referred to as Collegiate.

Location The basilica is located at Namugongo, Kira Municipality, Wakiso District, in Central Uganda. Namugongo is located approximately , by road, northeast of the central business district of Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city in that East African country. The geographical coordinates of the Uganda Martyrs Basilica are: 0¬∞23'08.0\\"N, 32¬∞39'05.0\\"E (Latitude:0.385556; Longitude:32.651389). History The Namugongo Shrines were first recognised by the Late Joshua Serufusa-Zake (1884 - 25 June 1985) when he was the Sabaddu of Kira Sub-County (1827 - 1928). Joshua Serufusa-Zake constructed a structure at the Namugongo site, where it appears shrines were built later for prayer. His interest in Christianity was enhanced by his father's participation in the wars that brought Christianity to Uganda. Joshua Serufusa-Zake's father, Semei Musoke Seruma Katiginya had earned a name for brevity 'Ngubu' from the wars. It might be of interest to note that Joshua Serufusa-Zake was born in 1884, just a year before the killings of Uganda Martyrs started. Overview Groundbreaking for the construction of the basilica was in 1965. Construction was completed in 1968. The basilica was decreed on 28 April 1993, and is administered by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kampala. It is built close to the spot where Saint Charles Lwanga and Saint Kizito were burned to death in 1886 on the orders of Kabaka Mukasa Basammul'ekkere Mwanga II. Recent events 2014 marked fifty years since the Uganda Martyrs were canonized and elevated to Sainthood by Pope Paul VI on 18 October 1964.

Relationship with Alexander II Leo XIII began his pontificate with a friendly letter to Tsar Alexander II, in which he reminded the Russian monarch of the millions of Catholics living in his empire, who would like to be good Russian subjects, provided their dignity is respected. He appealed to the generosity of the Tsar, since Vatican-Russian relations were at a low point. The Tsar replied in an equally friendly manner and promised actions towards equal treatment of all Catholics in the empire. As during the pontificate of Pope Pius IX, this turned out to be relative, since most problems were at the local level. Russian language in Catholic Churches As negotiations started, Russian demands for the use of Russian language in Catholic Churches including the Polish and Lithuanian provinces, was unacceptable to the Vatican. Pope Leo XIII threatened to appeal directly to all Catholics in Russia. Vacant episcopal sees Some progress was made in the occupation of vacant Episcopal sees, but an emotional breakthrough was the Papal encyclical from December 28, 1878, against nihilism and socialism and radicalism, which was dear to the Russian monarch, who was under constant pressure from nihilist and socialist forces. Repeated assassination attempts against Alexander II gave the Pope opportunity to repeat his warnings, which were read in all Catholic Churches. Coronation of Alexander III After the assassination of Alexander II, the Pope sent a high ranking representative to the coronation of his successor. Alexander III was grateful and asked for all religious forces to unify. He asked the Pope to ensure that his bishops abstain from political agitation. Relations improved further, when Pope Leo XIII, due to Italian considerations, distanced the Vatican from the Rome- Vienna, Berlin alliance and helped to facilitate a rapprochement between Paris and St. Petersburg. Status of Ruthenians and Poles Meanwhile, the Ruthenians continued to be persecuted and Rome was not able to assist much. Russia began to protest against Church uses by Polish groups for anti-Russian activities, and the Pope found himself in the same dilemma as his predecessor Pius IX. He was personally attacked for sacrificing Polish interest in the language dispute. Russia in turn accused its Catholics of being disloyal citizens, without attacking the Pope himself. Relationship with Nicholas II After the elevation of Tsar Nicolas II in 1894, Pope Leo XIII was able to reach additional agreements in 1896, which resulted in better conditions for the faithful, numerous specific dispensations and permits, and additional appointments of bishops. However, he was not able to reopen the nunciature in St. Petersburg. His pontificate ended with atmospheric improvements between the Vatican and Russia.All references unless otherwise indicated: Schmidlin, II, 506-514 In 1899 Nicholas II and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands used Pope Leo XIII's offices in their attempts to establish a peace conference of European nations.

It was recorded in February 1956, when Bassey was nineteen years old, and released later that month on a 78 rpm shellac disc (Philips PB 558), with Stormy Weather on the B side. The record was produced by Johnny Franz, with Wally Stott and his Orchestra backing Bassey. The song was written for Bassey by Ross Parker (most notable for We'll Meet Again) at the behest of Bassey's then-manager, Michael Sullivan, who was seeking a song to make Bassey stand out.Dopson, Roger (2009). Liner notes in Burn My Candle - The Complete Early Years [CD booklet]. London: Future Noise Music Ltd. The BBC banned the playing of the record, presumably due to its suggestive lyrics. In his 2010 biography of Bassey, John L. Williams writes that: > The song taken in isolation, is blatantly sexual but hardly convincing, as > the double entendres of the title give way to single entendres in the bridge > - There's \\"S\\" for Scotch, that's so direct / And for straight and simple sex > / \\"I\\" for invitation to / A close relationship with you / \\"N\\" for nothing > bad nor less / \\"S-I-N\\", that's sin, I guess....And that, right there, is the > key to Shirley Bassey's early success: she was blatantly sexy and yet > somehow, if not innocent, at least not too knowing. Despite being popular with audiences, the record failed to chart. In a 2009 interview on the BBC series Imagine, Bassey stated: > It was banned by the BBC, and I didn't know why. And I said, 'Why are they > banning it?' And my manager said, well--the lyrics may have something to do > with it--and I said, 'Yah? But what?' I didn't even know what it was about. > I'd never sung a risqu√© song and I think they purposefully didn't tell me so > that I could give it that innocence. Its first appearance on an album was The Bewitching Miss Bassey in 1959. On subsequent appearances the song is sometimes listed as \\"Burn My Candle (At Both Ends)\\". Most recently, it appears on the CD compilation Burn My Candle - The Complete Early Years. Shirley Bassey re-recorded this song in 1966, but it remained unreleased until 1975 when it appeared on the 2-LP set The Shirley Bassey Collection II.

The main event was the eponimous Infierno en el Ring match that CMLL traditionally holds at least once a year. In 2008 the match was given its own event, whereas previously it had been a part of other events. The Infierno en el Ring match is a multi-man Steel Cage match where all the competitors risked their hair, with the last wrestler in the ring being shaved bald. The 2008 event saw ten men risk their hair: Heavy Metal, El Texano Jr., Dami√°n 666, Mr. √Åguila, El Terrible, Perro Aguayo Jr., Shocker, Marco Corleone, Negro Casas and Alex Koslov.

Production Background The Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker Infierno en el Ring (\\"Inferno in the Ring\\"), all of which were main evented by a multi-man steel cage match, the eponymous Infierno en el Ring match. CMLL has use the Infierno en el Ring match on other shows, but will intermittently hold a show billed specifically as Infierno en el Ring, with the first such show held in 2008. It is not an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All Infierno en el Ring shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Infierno en el Ring shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2008 Infierno en el Ring show was the first show to use the name. Storylines The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Ettlinger is considered a prominent classical clarinetist of his generation, and one of Israel's notable instrumentalists. His musicianship and unique sound influenced the art of clarinet playing in Israel and Europe in the second half of the 20th century. Many clarinet soloists and orchestra players of different countries were among his students. Life Ettlinger was born in 1924 in Munich, Germany, and immigrated with his family to Palestine in 1933. The family lived in Tel Aviv, where Ettlinger studied piano, and later on the clarinet. His main clarinet teacher was Tzvi Tsipin. Ettlinger continued his studies in the United States and France, where he studied with the clarinetist Louis Cahuzac. His composition teacher was the Israeli composer Paul Ben-Haim. Between 1947 and 1964, Ettlinger was first clarinetist with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, and played under conductors Zubin Mehta, Sergiu Celibidache, and Paul Paray among others. Ettlinger took part in forming some of Israel's leading chamber ensembles, including the Tel Aviv Quartet, with which he performed and recorded until his death. With the Tel Aviv Quartet and with pianist Pnina Salzman, Ettlinger performed in some of the major festivals and cultural centers in the United States, South America, Europe, Australia and the Far East. He also appeared as conductor with the Israel Chamber Orchestra and the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra. Some of the prominent Israeli composers in his time wrote pieces for him, including the composers Tzvi Avni, Ben-Zion Orgad, Mordechai Seter and Josef Tal. In 1964, Ettlinger moved to Paris, where he taught clarinet and studied composition with the compositor and conductor Nadia Boulanger. In 1966, he joined the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London as a professor of clarinet and conductor of the school's symphony orchestra. Yona Ettlinger died suddenly in London in 1981 of heart disease at the age of 57. Recordings During his lifetime, records by Ettlinger appeared with Decca, RCA and Harmonia Mundi. In addition, many of his concerts were recorded by Kol Yisrael, Israel's radio service. One of Ettlinger's most acclaimed recordings is his performance of Brahms's Clarinet Quintet together with the Tel Aviv Quartet, which appeared in the 1960s on a Decca record, and is considered one of the outstanding recorded interpretations of this piece. Gramophone Archive, July 1972. See also reviews by High Fidelity Magazine and The Clarinetist Solo Repertoire, Discography.

It is endemic to the South Hills and Albion Mountains in southern Idaho. Cassia crossbill rarely interbreeds with other call types that move into the South Hills of Idaho yearly, and can be considered to represent a distinct species via ecological speciation. The Cassia crossbill have specialized beaks to access the seeds of the lodgepole pine cones in this region, but are poorly adapted to other pine cones in surrounding regions. The species was first described in 2009, but only was accepted to be its own species in 2017, when it was found out to be phylogenetically distinct from the red crossbill, and its 10 unique call types. Description South Hills - Idaho The Cassia crossbill shares many physical features with the red crossbill and all of its different call types. Adult males display a brick red plumage along its crown, breast, and belly, while its flight feathers have a brown colour. In contrast, adult females have an overall dull green or olive- yellow colour, with brown flight feathers. Its defining feature, a crossed bill, is a crisscrossed bill used to access the pine cone seeds. However, in relation to the red crossbill call types, the Cassia crossbill has a deeper and thicker bill to crack open the harder pine cones in its habitat. Its body mass ranges from 29.2‚Äì43.9 g, while its wing length 85.0‚Äì100.0 mm and bill depth 8.90‚Äì10.56 mm. Habitat and distribution The Cassia crossbill is found year-round exclusively in the forests of the South Hills and Albion Mountains in South Idaho. Compared to its counterpart, the red crossbill, which is a global species, the total area the Cassia crossbill resides in equates to about 67 km¬≤. They are almost exclusively found in mature and old- growth lodgepole pine dominated forests that do not have Red Squirrels as their beak is adapted for a specific type of pine cone. This has led to a coevolutionary arms race with the lodgepole pine, which explains why they are confined in such a small area. Other Red Crossbill call types, typically call type 2 & 5, are also found in these areas, but seldom breed here due to being poorly adapted to the pine cone structure. Due to their restricted range and habitat, there is a cause for concern for this species survival. Taxonomy The Cassia crossbill (Loxia sinesciuris) was first described in 2009 as the South Hills crossbill, but The American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) failed to find consensus on the issue of splitting the species from the red crossbill in 2009. The genus ‚ÄúLoxia‚Äù means crosswise, while ‚Äúsinesciuris‚Äù means ‚Äúwithout squirrel‚Äù. Initially, it was considered one of the Red Crossbills‚Äô 10 call types, which had different vocalizations, bill size and were foraging for different conifer species. The idea of reproductive isolation between call types was suggested, but direct evidence was lacking. In 2007, some analyses found that different call types were genetically different including the South Hills crossbill (call type 9). Furthermore, evidence suggested that the South Hills crossbill was in a coevolutionary arms race with the lodgepole pine, further leading to habitat isolation. In 2016, it was identified as phylogenetically distinct from the other call types. This is an example of sympatric speciation. In 2017, the AOU reached a consensus and split the South Hills crossbill from the red crossbill and rename it the Cassia crossbill, because its habitat resided in Cassia County, Idaho. Behaviour Diet The Cassia crossbill will exclusively forage for lodgepole pine cones that are found in the South Hills and Albion Mountains region. A primary reason why this species of crossbill can exist in such a small area and on a singular food source is due to the lack of squirrels, the usual primary seed dispersal of the lodgepole pine. As a result, serotinous cones are especially abundant in this region, which allows cones with seeds to accumulate in high quantities that will last for decades. This has led to a coevolutionary arms race between the crossbill and lodgepole pine, as the Cassia crossbill is the primary selective agent. In result, the lodgepole pine are creating cones with thick- scaled cones, whilst the crossbills have evolved deeper bills to counter this. The seeds of younger serotinous cones (1‚Äì10 years) are harder for the crossbill to pry open due to them being strongly bonded together. It is the older and weathered cones that are more readily accessible as the scales begin to separate. The Cassia crossbill will mainly eat seeds from cones on the pine tree itself, but fallen cones are also foraged on as well. The crossbill will use its beak to pry the cone open and then it will use its tongue to obtain the seed. The crossbill will then use a groove inside its mouth to shell the seed to eventually eat it. Vocalizations As mentioned previously, the red crossbill had 10 different call types and the Cassia crossbill was call type 9. The Cassia Crossbill fledgling initially imitates its parents‚Äô flight calls and eventually will modify its call to imitate their mate. Compared to the other call types, the Cassia crossbills songs will be more repetitive while using fewer syllables. The individual notes of the song are typically buzzier and will have multiple instances of silence in between call phrases. Their song consists of strained and sharp chip and kip calls. Occasionally when red crossbills forage, there will be overlap between different call types. It is believed that crossbills used the public information of different calls to forage. This eventually led to assortative flocking when crossbills would follow vocalizations that would provide them the easiest route to food. This can be another mechanism to how the Cassia crossbill diverged from the red crossbill. Reproduction The Cassia crossbill and the other red crossbill call types will strongly associate with their own call types. Between 2001 and 2006, less than 1% of Cassia crossbills paired with other call types. Compared to the red crossbill call types, which are opportunistic breeders throughout most of the year, the Cassia crossbill will consistently breed from March through July. They tend to build their cup-shaped nests in April, using twigs, grasses and needles. Courtship of the crossbills involves the male attracting the female by singing, flying and feeding them with pine seeds. Males will aggressively defend the female from other breeding males after copulation successfully occurs. Females will lay 2‚Äì6 eggs and they will incubate the egg for 12‚Äì16 days. Conservation and status The current total population estimation is ‚âà5,800 individuals. Since the Cassia crossbill is a new species, the conservation status of this species has not been assessed yet. However, under the IUCN Red list criteria, it qualifies to be considered critically endangered due to its limited home range, small population and probable habitat degradation. A major threat to the crossbill is climate change. The cumulative hot weather (>32 ¬∞C) can result into the early dispersal of the pine cone seeds, thus limiting the food availability for the crossbill. Because of warmer weather, another threat are mountain pine bark beetle infestations. They will burrow in the pine trees and subsequently killing them, which can further exacerbate the food security problem for these birds. The potential for large fires increases every year due to climate change, which can prove disastrous for the crossbills if a significant portion of the pine trees die. It is projected that the lodgepole pines will disappear from the South Hills and Albion Mountains by the end of the century.

The 2008 Sin Piedad was the seventh event under that name that CMLL promoted as their last major show of the year, always held in December. The main event was Six-man \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team match between Blue Panther, Dos Caras Jr. and Dr. Wagner Jr. and the team of Black Warrior, Mr. Niebla and Rey Bucanero. The show also featured two Lucha de Apuesta matches, the first one saw La Amapola and Lady Apache put their hair on the line. The second match saw Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. and Mictl√°n both risk their masks. The show also featured three further six-man \\"Lucha Libre rules\\" tag team matches,including one featuring wrestlers from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and another featured CMLL's Mini- Estrellas division. Production Background The Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker Sin Piedad (\\"No Pity\\" or \\"No Mercy\\"). CMLL has intermittently held a show billed specifically as Sin Piedad since 2000, primarily using the name for their \\"end of the year\\" show in December, although once they held a Sin Piedad show in August as well. CMLL has on occasion used a different name for the end-of-year show but Sin Piedad is the most commonly used name. All Sin Piedad shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Sin Piedad shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2008 Sin Piedad show was the eight show to use the name, and the only one to be held in August. Storylines The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The main event of the 2008 Sin Piedad show was a traditional Lucha Libre best two out of three falls six-man tag team match, the most common match type in CMLL. The main focus of the main event was the storyline feud between the tecnico Dr. Wagner Jr. and the rudo Mr. Niebla who captained a team each. Originally Dr. Wagner Jr. was slated to team up with Dos Caras Jr. and M√≠stico, who had just returned from China, but a week before the Sin Piedad show M√≠stico suffered an injury when he fractured a collar bone. Blue Panther took M√≠stico's spot, despite being in the middle of a storyline feud with Villano V at the time. Mr. Niebla teamed up with Black Warrior and Rey Bucanero, neither of which really had an ongoing storyline with the opposition. Dr. Wagner and Mr. Niebla had clashed in several intense matches throughout August, including a match where Mr. Niebla broke one or two of his fingers but opted to finish the match despite being in pain. The broken fingers did not cause Mr. Niebla to take any time off from the ring and instead was written into the storyline between the two. The ring persona Mictl√°n made his CMLL debut in 2006, based on the myths of the Aztec Underworld. Over the years he worked as a low-card tecnico until mid 2008 when he became involved in a storyline with low-card rudo Drag√≥n Rojo Jr.. Rojo had won the 2008 Gran Alternativa tournament while teaming with √öltimo Guerrero. Following his tournament win Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. developed a rivalry with Mictl√°n, slowly evolving from the two simply being on opposite sides of six-man tag team matches to the two being the focal point of several matches as Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. would often target his rival by tearing his mask apart, or even stripping his opponent of the match to humiliate the tecnico. At times the move would backfire on Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. as the referee would disqualify him and his team for removing the mask, which is an illegal move under lucha libre rules. During a CMLL press conference it was announced that the two wrestlers would both put their masks on the line in the semi-main event of the 2008 Sin Piedad show as they faced off in a Lucha de Apuestas or bet match between the two masked men. The Luchas de Apuestas matches, especially those where the mask is on the line is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre and a signal that the winner of the match would more than likely move up the ranks of CMLL. CMLL held their eleventh International Gran Prix on July 26, 2009 in Arena M√©xico which featured wrestlers from CMLL facing off against a team of International wrestlers including some foreigners who were CMLL regulars and six wrestlers from Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) based in Florida: (A.J. Styles, Alex Shelley, Johnny Devine, Chris Sabin, Jay Lethal and Sonjay Dutt). The match was won by Alex Shelley, lastly eliminating Team CMLL captain √öltimo Guerrero to win the tournament. Following the match √öltimo Guerrero made several challenges towards the TNA contingency, especially Shelley and A.J. Styles. On August 5, 2008 the team of √öltimo Guerrero, Atlantis and Negro Casas (collectively referred to as Los Guerreros Negros, or \\"The Black Warriors\\") defeated Los √Ångeles Rebeldes (H√©ctor Garza, El Hijo del Fantasma and La M√°scara) to win the CMLL World Trios Championship. It was initially rumored that Los Guerreros would defend the title against a team from TNA, but when the Sin Piedad card was announced the match between Los Guerreros Negro and \\"Team TNA\\" (A.J. Styles, Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) it was a non-title match, but with the possibility of a title match in the future if the CMLL/TNA working relationship continued. In the week before Sin Piedad A.J. Styles was pulled from the match for medical reasons and replaced by Sonjay Dutt instead. On the undercard four of CMLL's female wrestlers would clash in a match that meant that one of the four wrestlers would either be shaved bald (La Amapola, Lady Apache or Marcela) or be forced to remove their mask (Princesa Sujei) as a result of the match. The match would take place in two stages, first the team of La Amapola and Lady Apache would wrestle against the team of Marcela and Princesa Sujei. The losing team would then be forced to immediately wrestle against each other in a match known as a Relevos suicida match. The match saw long time rivals Lady Apache and La Amapola (CMLL World Women's Champion team up to face Marcela and Princesa Sujei who had a budding rivalry as well. Several sources, including some of the participants themselves were confused by the match and opposed to the format, hoping for a singles Lucha de Apuestas match between two of the participants instead of the more convoluted Relevos suicida match. The issue between Marcela and Princesa Sujei had only been going on for a week or so before the announced match, while Lady Apache and La Amapola had had a long-running rivalry stretching back to November 16, 2007 where La Amapola defeated Lady Apache to win the CMLL World Women's Championship. The issues between the two had focused mainly on the championship and less on a potential Lucha de Apuestas match between the two for their respective hair.

Sammons began his career with Birmingham City, for whom he made only one appearance, in the League Cup. He moved into non-league football with Hereford United, Worcester City, Redditch United (three spells), Corby Town and Hednesford Town before joining National League club Solihull Moors in 2017. He then joined Redditch for a fourth time, initially on a dual registration, in November 2017, and left Moors in January 2018. He represented his country at under-17 level. Club career Sammons joined Birmingham City's youth academy after being spotted playing for his local under-10s team. He progressed through the academy teams, playing for the under-18s while still a schoolboy, and was in the starting eleven for the 5‚Äì0 victory over Burton Albion in the final of the Birmingham Senior Cup; though nominally a reserve team, several first-team players were included. In November 2008 Sammons signed his first professional contract, to expire in the summer of 2011. He was given a squad number and included among the substitutes for the FA Cup match against Wolverhampton Wanderers in January 2009, but remained unused. He captained the under-18 team to the semi-final of the 2008‚Äì09 FA Youth Cup, in which they lost 6‚Äì1 on aggregate to their Liverpool counterparts; Sammons scored Birmingham's goal, \\"curling a 30-yard shot\\" past the Liverpool goalkeeper. Though included in the squads for pre-season friendlies, he did not initially receive a squad number for the 2009‚Äì10 season. After manager Alex McLeish named only six of the permitted seven substitutes for the League Cup match at Southampton, because they \\"could fill the squad with younger players that have just stepped up from the Academy but they're not ready\\", Sammons told the Birmingham Mail that he disagreed, feeling that he, Jordon Mutch and Mitchell McPike were all capable of playing first-team football. Three weeks later he was named on the bench for the Premier League match at Hull City, but again remained unused. He made his first-team debut in the starting eleven for the League Cup third-round match at Sunderland on 22 September 2009. McLeish described the player as \\"a disciplined passer of the ball [who's] got good energy\\", stressing that although he didn't \\"just want to throw young players jerseys every time we have an injury crisis\\", in this case it was deserved. He made no further first-team appearances before a knee injury disrupted his 2010‚Äì11 season, at the end of which he signed a new one- year contract. He was released when that contract expired at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. On 10 August 2012, Sammons signed for Football Conference club Hereford United.

Mettbach was born on 24 July 1952 in Hamburg. After his apprenticeship as a shipping clerk (1967-70), Mettbach joined the German army in 1974 and studied business management at the German army economy college in Darmstadt (1980-82). Mettbach began his political career in the CDU which he joined in 1980. He was founding member of the Statt Party in 1993 and later joined the Law and Order Offensive Party of Ronald Schill. From August 2001 to March 2004, he was the senator (equivalent of a minister) of construction and transport, and additionally Second Mayor of Hamburg from August 2003 to March 2004, replacing his dismissed party leader Schill. Mettbach was criticised for appointing his domestic partner as his personal assistant, arguing that he would not trust a stranger in this position. In Spring 2003, Mettbach was elected federal chairman of the Party for a Rule of Law Offensive, succeeding Schill, who continued to be leader of the Hamburg state party. In December 2003 the party split when the federal board (chaired by Mettbach) removed Schill from his position as chairman of the state party and later even expelled him from the party. After losing the election in 2004, Mettbach abandoned the Party for a Rule of Law Offensive and returned to the CDU in March 2005. He worked as a management consultant and was on the supervisory board of the Hamburg Port Authority. In Spring 2006 the state-owned Hamburg business development corporation HFW hired him as a consultant. The opposition attributed his choice to his political links. He had to relinquish this mandate in May of the same year, when connections to a criminal businessman became public. In 2007, he attempted suicide.

The original church with that dedication was the town's first permanent Roman Catholic place of worship; founded in 1875, it was paid for by Augusta, Duchess of Norfolk, a member of the most important Dukedom in England. After its closure, a new St Peter's Church was built nearby. The old building, which still stands and is in residential use, has been listed by English Heritage at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. The former St Peter's Church History The settlement of Old Shoreham developed inland from the English Channel and next to the east bank of the River Adur. Its focus was the 10th-century St Nicolas' Church. Later development filled the gap between the village and the sea, and the growth of trade from its harbour in the 18th and 19th centuries brought prosperity to what was by then a small town. By the mid-19th century, two large Anglican churches were supported‚ÄîSt Nicolas' Church had been joined by the substantial St Mary de Haura Church‚Äîbut Roman Catholics had no place of worship. Around that time, a priest began to travel in from nearby Worthing to celebrate Mass at a house in Surry Street; in 1870 this arrangement moved to a former schoolroom on a site between John Street and Ship Street. The land on which this stood had been acquired in the 1860s by the former Vicar of Shoreham, Reverend William Wheeler. He had left the Church of England and was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1855, and donated the land to enable a permanent church to be built. The funds to build the church came from Augusta, Duchess of Norfolk. She had married into the Dukedom of Norfolk, England's most important Roman Catholic family, in 1839; her husband, Henry Fitzalan- Howard, 14th Duke of Norfolk, was the Lord of the Manor and lived nearby at Arundel Castle, the ducal seat. Architect Charles Buckler, who was responsible for several Roman Catholic churches in Sussex, was commissioned to design and build the church. The building, described as \\"large, rather severe ... [and] assertive\\", was consecrated and opened in 1875. A presbytery was added on the east (John Street) side, in a matching style, in 1877. Its capacity was approximately 200, and it cost ¬£5,000 (¬£ as of ). It was registered for marriages in April 1877. Architecture Charles Buckler used the Decorated Gothic style, imitative of 13th- and 14th-century churches, for his design for St Peter's Church. The structure is of cobbled flint dressed with ashlar. It lacks a spire or tower, but there is a bell-tower at the west end of the roof, which is tiled and gabled. There are four large lancet windows in the north and south walls, separated by buttresses; until the building's conversion from a nursing home into flats, these had elaborate tracery. As originally built, the church had a four-bay nave and two further bays in the chancel, which also had a transept. A porch led into the nave on the west side. Inside, below the roof trusses, there was a gallery at the west end. Fittings included a reredos and a marble altar. The building today The church was closed and sold for redevelopment in 1982. It was converted into a nursing home, retaining most of its ecclesiastical features including the intricate window tracery. The latter was lost when the building was converted into flats in 2002, being replaced with plain modern windows instead, but there has otherwise been little structural alteration. The flats are named \\"St John's Court\\"‚Äîa reference to the former name of John Street. \\"St John\\" referred to the Knights of St John Hospitallers, who had been active in Shoreham since the mid-12th century. English Heritage granted the former St Peter's Church Grade II listed status on 16 August 1983. Such buildings are defined as being \\"nationally important and of special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 106 Grade II listed buildings, and 119 listed buildings of all grades, in Adur district. The new St Peter's Church A new church‚Äîa low building with a rectangular plan‚Äîwas built just north of its predecessor after it closed in 1982. Construction started in 1983. The building, which stands on the corner of West Street and North Street, is on the site of a Roman Catholic school which had closed and moved elsewhere in the town in the 1960s. Before that, a 17th-century house stood on the site; its grounds extended some distance to the north. The church is part of the parish of Our Lady Queen of Peace, Adur Valley, which covers three Roman Catholic churches in the area (the others are at Steyning and Upper Beeding in the neighbouring district of Horsham). One priest serves all three. Two Masses are celebrated every Sunday, and on Holy Days of Obligation an evening Mass is said.

He achieved prominence in the Viennese society and Freemasonry.  Life  Angelo Soliman, whose real name was Mmadi Make, probably belonged to the Magumi sub-set of the Kanuri ethnic group.http://www.joshuaproject.net/people- profile.php?rog3=CM&rop3;=104605http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Kanuri+people His original name, Mmadi Make, is linked to a princely class in the Borno State in modern Nigeria. He was taken captive as a child and arrived in Marseilles as a slave, eventually transferring to the household of a marchioness in Messina who oversaw his education. Out of affection for another servant in the household, Angelina, he adopted the name Angelo and chose to celebrate September 11, his baptismal day, as his birthday. After repeated requests, he was given as a gift in 1734 to Prince Georg Christian, Prince von Lobkowitz, the imperial governor of Sicily. He became the Prince's valet and traveling companion, accompanying him on military campaigns throughout Europe and reportedly saving his life on one occasion, a pivotal event responsible for his social ascension. After the death of Prince Lobkowitz, Soliman was taken into the Vienna household of Joseph Wenzel I, Prince of Liechtenstein, eventually rising to chief servant. Later, he became royal tutor of the heir to the Prince, Aloys I.Geschichte der Afrikanistik in √ñsterreich: Angelo Soliman (English Translation) Angelo Soliman und seine Freunde im Adel und in der geistigen Elite (in German) On February 6, 1768, he married the noblewoman Magdalena Christiani, a young widow and sister of the French general Fran√ßois Etienne de Kellermann, Duke of Valmy (1770-1835), a marshal of Napoleon Bonaparte.Wilhelm. A. Bauer, A. Soliman, Hochf√ºrstlische Der Mohr, W. Sauer (Hg), 1922 A cultured man, Soliman was highly respected in the intellectual circles of Vienna and counted as a valued friend by Austrian Emperor Joseph II and Count Franz Moritz von Lacy. In 1783, he joined the Masonic lodge \\"True Concord\\" (Zur Wahren Eintracht), whose membership included many of Vienna's influential artists and scholars of the time, among them the musicians Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Haydn as well the Hungarian poet Ferenc Kazinczy. Lodge records indicate that Soliman and Mozart met on several occasions. It is likely that the character Bassa Selim in Mozart's opera The Abduction from the Seraglio was based on Soliman.Virtuelles Learning Center Mozarthaus Vienna Eventually becoming the Grand Master of that lodge, Soliman helped change its ritual to include scholarly elements. This new Masonic direction rapidly influenced Freemasonic practice throughout Europe. Soliman is still celebrated in Masonic rites as \\"Father of Pure Masonic Thought\\", with his name usually transliterated as \\"Angelus Solimanus\\". During his lifetime Soliman was regarded as a model of the assimilation and perfectibility of Africans, but after his death he literally became a specimen of the \\"African race\\". Wigger and Klein distinguish four aspects of Soliman ‚Äì the \\"royal Moor\\", the \\"noble Moor\\", the \\"physiognomic Moor\\" and the \\"mummified Moor\\". The first two designations refer to the years prior to his death. The term \\"royal Moor\\" designates Soliman in the context of enslaved Moors at European courts, where their skin color marked their inferiority and they figured as status symbols betokening the power and wealth of their owners. Bereft of his ancestry and original culture, Soliman was degraded to an \\"exotic-oriental sign of his lord's standing\\" who was not allowed to live a self-determined existence. The designation \\"noble Moor\\" describes Soliman as a former court Moor whose ascent up the social ladder due to his marriage with an aristocratic woman made his emancipation possible. During this time Soliman became a member of the Freemasons and as lodge Grand Master was certainly considered equal to his fellow Masons even though he continued to face a thicket of race and class prejudices. Beneath the surface appearance of integration lurked Soliman's remarkable destiny. Though he moved smoothly in high society, the exotic quality ascribed to him was never lost and over the course of his lifetime was transformed into a racial characteristic. The qualities used to categorize Soliman as a \\"physiognomic Moor\\" were set forth by pioneering Viennese ethnologists during his lifetime, framed by theories and assumptions concerning the \\"African race\\". He could not escape the taxonomic view that focused on typical racial characteristics, i.e., skin color, hair texture, lip size and nose shape. Neither his social standing nor his membership in the Freemasons could prevent his posthumous exploitation, leading to his ultimate status as the \\"mummified Moor\\". Instead of receiving a Christian burial, Soliman was ‚Äì at the request of the director of the Imperial Natural History Collection ‚Äì skinned, stuffed and made into an exhibit within their cabinet of curiosities.http://angelosoliman.blogspot.com/ These circumstances are omitted in the early biographical notes by the Abb√© Henri Gr√©goire ‚Äì for an English translation see: Biographical Account of the Negro Angelo Soliman. In: The Monthly Repository, Vol. XI, No. CXXVII, 1816, pp. 373 - 376 . Decked out in ostrich feathers and glass beads, this mummy was on display until 1806 alongside stuffed animals, transformed from a reputable member of intellectual Viennese society into an exotic specimen. By stripping Soliman of the insignia of his lifetime achievements, ethnologists instrumentalized him as what they imagined to be an exemplary African \\"savage\\". Soliman's daughter Josefine sought to have his remains returned to the family, but her petitions were in vain. During the October revolution of 1848, the mummy burned. A plaster cast of Soliman's head made shortly after his death of a stroke in 1796 is still on display in the Rollett Museum in Baden. His grandson was the Austrian writer Eduard von Feuchtersleben.Wilhelm A. Bauer, Angelo Soliman, der hochf√ºrstliche Mohr. Ein exotisches Kapital Alt- Wien.

The airport is located east-northeast of Chartres and it is southeast of Champhol. It supports general aviation with no commercial airline service scheduled. History The facility was a military field, prior to 1870, dedicated to cavalry.  Pilots' school during World War I The first plane designed by engineer Cl√©ment Ader was tested there, yet failed to take off on October 9, 1890. Chartres' airfield started in 1909. From March 1915 to the end of World War I, an important military training center for pilots was set up; it was on the top of military flying schools in France, and many famous pilots were trained in Chartres. A this time, the airfield was opened to civil aircraft as well as military. In 1923, the \\"22e R√©giment A√©rien de bombardement de nuit\\" (22nd Night Bombardment Squadron) was located in Chartres, with Amiot 143 bombers and, later, the Bloch 131. From WW I to WW II : Bomber and fighter squadrons An important bombing Squadron, the \\"22e R√©giment A√©rien de Bombardement de Nuit\\" (Night Bombing Squadron) settled in Chartres, in 1923. The French Air Force was born in April, the 1st of 1933. The 6e Escadre de Chasse (6th Fighting Squadron) landed in Chartres in 1936. It was reinforced by the Arm√©e de l'Air as a military airfield after the Invasion of Poland in September 1939. The French Air Force based Morane-Saulnier MS-230 fighters at the airfield for the defense of the Chartres region. Bloch 151s were also assigned, with Czechoslovakian pilots being assigned to the airfield. World War II Training for fighter pilots From 1939 to May, 1940 a training Unit for fighter pilots worked in Chartres : the \\"Centre d'Instruction de la Chasse\\" (Fighting Training Centre). Lot of them fought against German planes. The airfield was first attacked by the German Luftwaffe on 3 June 1940 by a formation of 15 twin engine Dornier Do 17 light bombers. It was surrendered along with the rest of the French Air Force bases in France at the Second Armistice at Compi√®gne on 22 June and was seized by the occupying German Army.Rudolf Ptacek (1918 - 1942) German use After the Battle of France, Chartres was used as a Luftwaffe military airfield during the occupation.

The Chartres area was heavily attacked on several missions by United States Army Air Force Eighth Air Force bombers in 1943 and 1944 and the airport was singularly attacked on 15 September 1943 by 22 B-24 Liberators of the 44th Bombardment Group.USAFHRA Document 00104363 Additional attacks on the airfield were made on 2 March and 25 March 1944 by B-17 Flying Fortresses of the 94th Bombardment Group and 388th Bombardment Group of the 4th Bombardment Wing.USAFHRA Document 00104042 Just prior to the D-Day landings in Normandy, additional attacks were made on the airfield by B-26 Marauder medium bombers of the IX Bomber Command 322d Bombardment Group during May 1944.USAFHRA Document 00082809 It was attacked again during June and July after the landings by the 397th and 416th Bombardment Groups. American use It was liberated by Allied ground forces about 21 August 1944 during the Northern France Campaign. Almost immediately, the USAAF IX Engineer Command 832nd and 833rd Engineer Aviation Battalions began clearing the airport of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft, and repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. Subsequently, Chartres Airport became a USAAF Ninth Air Force combat airfield, designated as \\"A-40\\" about 26 August, only a week after its capture from German forces.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. Once declared operationally ready, the airfield had a concrete runway 5500' long aligned 08/26, with much Pierced Steel Planking used to repair the damage caused by the frequent Allied bombing. Most hangars and support buildings were destroyed and subsequently, tents had to be used for billeting and also for support facilities along with a drinkable water supply and minimal electrical grid established for communications and station lighting.IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout Under American control, Chartres initially became the home of the 368th Fighter Group, which flew P-47 Thunderbolts from the field starting on 23 August, remaining until 11 September. They were replaced by the B-26 Marauder-equipped 323d Bombardment Group on 21 September, flying combat missions until 13 October 1944.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . The combat units moved out at the end of October 1944, and until the end of the war, Chartres became a resupply and combat casualty evacuation airfield, and performing other support roles for the Allies. It was returned to French civil control in June 1945. French Air Force Use World War II had almost totally destroyed Champhol Airport. Much unexploded and excess wartime ordnance needed to be removed and the entire infrastructure was in ruins. The previous airfield of the \\"22e R√©giment de Bombardement A√©rien\\" was reconstructed as Chartres Air Base (BA 122) (Base A√©rienne 122 Chartres- Champhol) and used by the French Air Force. This Base was very active, mainly with flying Squadrons specialised in tactical transport, such as the 61e Escadre de Transport (cf French Wikipedia). Those planes were involved in battles of French war in Indochine (Vietnam) and Algeria. In 1953, planes and flying Squadrons were based on the French Air Force Base of Orl√©ans, due to the danger of flights with big planes close to the famous Cathedrale of Chartres. It remains an important Air Force Base after 1953, included technical Units, a military training center (CIMCA 41.122) and a broadcasting station. The French Air Force closed the military air base in 1997. Current The field was replaced by a totally new civilian facility which is much smaller than the prewar airport. It has an asphalt main runway and a secondary turf runway for small aircraft and glider use. The runway and ground support buildings are on the south side of the former airport and wartime runway. In addition, an industrial park was built on part of the former airport What appears to be hangars are on the north side of the airport, about 200m north of the runway, and unconnected with the current airport were probably part of the former military airfield. Also it appears that the north side of the airport, the location of the prewar airport and wartime airfield, remains under French Military control, as aerial photography and satellite images of the area are either intentionally blurred or blanked for undetermined reasons.

Johnson in response to tariffs placed by France and West Germany on importation of U.S. chicken. The period from 1961‚Äì1964 of tensions and negotiations surrounding the issue was known as the \\"Chicken War,\\" taking place at the height of Cold War politics. Eventually, the tariffs on potato starch, dextrin, and brandy were lifted, but since 1964 this form of protectionism has remained in place to give U.S. domestic automakers an advantage over competition (e.g., from Japan, Turkey, China, and Thailand). Though concern remains about its repeal, a 2003 Cato Institute study called the tariff \\"a policy in search of a rationale.\\" As an unintended consequence, several importers of light trucks have circumvented the tariff via loopholes, known as tariff engineering. Ford (ostensibly a company that the tax was designed to protect), imported its first-generation Transit Connect light trucks as \\"passenger vehicles\\" to the U.S. from Turkey, and immediately stripped and shredded portions of their interiors (e.g., installed rear seats, seatbelts) in a warehouse outside Baltimore. To import vans built in Germany, Mercedes \\"disassembled them and shipped the pieces to South Carolina, where American workers put them back together in a small kit assembly building.\\" The resulting vehicles emerge as locally manufactured, free from the tariff. Background Largely because of post-World War II intensive chicken farming and accompanying price reductions, chicken, once internationally synonymous with luxury, became a staple food in the U.S. Prior to the early 1960s, not only had chicken remained prohibitively expensive in Europe, but it had also remained a delicacy. With imports of inexpensive chicken from the U.S., chicken prices fell quickly and sharply across Europe, radically affecting European chicken consumption. In 1961, per capita chicken consumption rose up to 23% in West Germany. U.S. chicken captured nearly half of the imported European chicken market. Subsequently, the Dutch accused the U.S. of dumping chickens at prices below cost of production. The French government banned U.S. chicken and raised concerns that hormones could affect male virility. German farmers' associations accused U.S. poultry firms of fattening chicken artificially with arsenic. Coming on the heels of a \\"crisis in trade relations between the U.S. and the Common Market,\\" Europe moved ahead with tariffs, intending that they would encourage Europe's postwar agricultural self- sufficiency. European markets began setting chicken price controls. France introduced the higher tariff first, persuading West Germany to join them‚Äîeven while the French hoped to win a larger share of the profitable German chicken market after excluding U.S. chicken. Europe adopted the Common Agricultural Policy, imposing minimum import prices on all imported chicken and nullifying prior tariff bindings and concessions. Beginning in 1962, the U.S. accused Europe's Common Market of unfairly restricting imports of American poultry. By August 1962, U.S. exporters had lost 25% of their European chicken sales. Losses to the U.S. poultry industry were estimated at US$26‚Äì28 million (over US$210 million in 2014 dollars). Senator J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Democratic Senator from Arkansas, a chief U.S. poultry-producing state, interrupted a NATO debate on nuclear armament to protest trade sanctions on U.S. chicken, going so far as to threaten cutting U.S. troops in NATO. Konrad Adenauer, then Chancellor of Germany, later reported that President John F. Kennedy and he had a great deal of correspondence over a period of two years, about Berlin, Laos, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, \\"and I guess that about half of it has been about chickens.\\" Diplomacy failure and the UAW U.S. sales of Volkswagen Type 2 vans in pickup and commercial configurations were curtailed by the Chicken Tax. Diplomacy failed after 18 months, and on December 4, 1963, President Johnson imposed a 25% tax (almost 10 times the average U.S. tariff) by executive order (Proclamation 3564) on potato starch, dextrin, brandy, and light trucks, effective from 7 January 1964. With Johnson's proclamation, the U.S. had invoked its right under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), whereby an offended nation may increase tariffs by an equal amount to losses from discriminating tariffs. Officially, the tax targeted items imported from Europe approximating the value of lost American chicken sales to Europe. In retrospect, audio tapes from the Johnson White House, revealed a quid pro quo unrelated to chicken. In January 1964, President Johnson attempted to convince United Auto Workers' president Walter Reuther not to initiate a strike just before the 1964 election and to support the president's civil-rights platform. Reuther, in turn, wanted Johnson to respond to Volkswagen's increased shipments to the United States. The Chicken Tax directly curtailed importation of German-built Volkswagen Type 2s in configurations that qualified them as light trucks, that is, commercial vans and pickups. In 1964, U.S. imports of \\"automobile trucks\\" from West Germany declined to a value of US$5.7 million‚Äîabout one-third the value imported in the previous year. Soon after, Volkswagen cargo vans and pickup trucks, the intended targets, \\"practically disappeared from the U.S. market.\\" VW Type 2s were not the only vehicle line affected. As a direct result of the Chicken Tax, Japanese automakers Toyota (with its Publica, Crown, and Corona coupe utes), Datsun (Sunny truck), Isuzu (Wasp), and Mazda (Familia), which were selling pickup trucks, coupe utility vehicles, and panel deliveries in the US at the time, pulled these models out of the North American and Caribbean markets and did not bring over many models sold elsewhere. Ramifications Chevrolet LUV: imported from 1972 to 1980 in chassis-cab configuration (less truck bed) to circumvent the Chicken Tax U.S.-bound Ford Transit Connect: pieces of its interior are shredded to circumvent the Chicken Tax The tariff affected any country (such as Japan) seeking to bring light trucks into the U.S. and effectively \\"squeezed smaller Asian truck companies out of the American pickup market.\\" Over the intervening years, Detroit lobbied to protect the light-truck tariff, thereby reducing pressure on Detroit to introduce vehicles that polluted less and that offered increased fuel economy. , the 1964 tariff of 25% remains levied on imported light trucks. Robert Z. Lawrence, professor of international trade and investment at Harvard University, contends the tax crippled the U.S. automobile industry by insulating it from real competition in light trucks for 40 years. Circumventing the tariff Japanese manufacturers initially found they could export \\"chassis cab\\" configurations (which included the entire light truck, less the cargo box or truck bed) with only a 4% tariff. A truck bed would subsequently be attached to the chassis in the United States and the vehicle could be sold as a light truck. Examples included the Chevrolet LUV and Ford Courier. The \\"chassis-cab\\" loophole was closed in 1980. From 1978‚Äì1987, the Subaru BRAT carried two rear-facing seats (with seatbelts and carpeting) in its rear bed to meet classification as a \\"passenger vehicle\\" and not a light truck. The U.S. Customs Service changed vehicle classifications in 1989, automatically relegating two-door SUVs to light-truck status. Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Suzuki (through a joint venture with GM), and Honda Motor Co. eventually built assembly plants in the U.S. and Canada in response to the tariff. From 2001 to 2006, cargo van versions of the Mercedes and Dodge Sprinter were manufactured in assembly kit form in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, then shipped to a factory in Gaffney, South Carolina, for final assembly with a proportion of locally sourced parts complementing the imported components. The cargo versions would have been subject to the tax if imported as complete units, thus the importation in knock-down kit form for U.S. assembly. Ford imported all of its first-generation Ford Transit Connect models as \\"passenger vehicles\\" by including rear windows, rear seats, and rear seat belts. The vehicles are exported from Turkey on ships owned by Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics (WWL), arrive in Baltimore, and are converted back into light trucks at WWL's Vehicle Services Americas, Inc. facility by replacing rear windows with metal panels and removing the rear seats and seat belts. The removed parts are not shipped back to Turkey for reuse, but shredded and recycled in Ohio. The process exploits the loophole in the customs definition of a light truck; as cargo does not need seats with seat belts or rear windows, presence of those items automatically qualifies the vehicle as a \\"passenger vehicle\\" and exempts the vehicle from \\"light truck\\" status. The process costs Ford hundreds of dollars per van, but saves thousands in taxes. U.S. Customs and Border Protection estimated that between 2002 and 2018 the practice saved Ford $250m in tariffs. Chrysler introduced the Ram ProMaster City, an Americanized version of the Fiat Dobl√≤, in 2015 -- building the vehicle at the Tofa≈ü plant in Turkey, importing only passenger configurations and subsequently converting cargo configurations. In 2009, Mahindra & Mahindra Limited announced it would export pickup trucks from India in knock-down kit form, again to circumvent the tax. These are complete vehicles that can be assembled in the U.S. from kits of parts shipped in crates. The export plans were later cancelled. Light trucks manufactured in Mexico and Canada, such as the Ram series of trucks manufactured in Saltillo, Mexico, and Canadian-built Chevrolet, GMC, and Ford truck models, are not subject to the tax under the North American Free Trade Agreement, and from July 1, 2020, the United States‚ÄìMexico‚ÄìCanada Agreement.

Two year later, Achille Ratti became Pope Pius XI, shaping Vatican policies towards Poland with Pietro Gasparri and Eugenio Pacelli for the following thirty-six years. (1922-1958) Church life flourishes During the pontificate of Pope Pius XI (1922-1939), Church life in Poland flourished: There were some anti-clerical groups opposing the new role of the Church especially in education,Schmidlin IV, 135 But numerous religious meetings and congresses, feasts and pilgrimages, many of which were accompanied by supportive letters from the Pontiff, took place. Activities of Cardinal Gasparri Under the pontificate of Pope Pius XI, his Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri with unusual candour expressed his views on the post-war order and the future of Poland: He told Ludwig von Pastor, that the Peace Treaty of Versailles will most certainly end in a new war, maybe even ten wars.Von Pastor 681 He expressed his pleasure at the outcome of the Locarno treaty. However, the Polish Corridor continued to be a dark point in his estimation, requiring compromises.Von Pastor 833 At the same time, he opined, Poland can only exist, if she works either with her neighbour in the East or West.

The Pope insisted, even when the ‚ÄúBlack Pope, Father General Wlodimir Ledochowski intervened. He was respectfully told to be quiet.Tardini His distaste for some Polish politicians did not extend to the Polish people.

He negotiated for Pope Pius XI the Lateran treaty of 1929 and numerous concordats. Concordat with Poland On February 10, 1925, a concordat (Concordat of 1925) was signed between Pietro Gasparri, Cardinal Secretary of State for the Vatican and Stanislaw Grabski for Poland.Joanne M Restrepo Restrepo SJ, Concordata Regnante Sancissimo Domino Pio XI Inita, Pontificia Universitas Gregoriana, Romae, 1932 The concordat has 27 articles, which guarantee the freedom of the Church and the faithful.

Clerics make a solemn oath of allegiance to the Polish StateConcordata 12 If clergy are under accusation, trial documents will be forwarded to ecclesiastical authorities if clergy are accused of crimes. If convicted, they will not serve incarceration in jails but will be handed over to Church authorities for internment in a monastery or convent.Concordata 22 The concordat extends to the Latin rite in five ecclesiastical provinces of Gniezno and Poznan, Varsovie, Wilno, Lwow and Cracovie. It applies as well to united Catholics of the Greco-Ruthenian rite in Lwow, and Przemysl, and, to the Armenian rite in Lwow.Concordata 9 for religious celebration in the specific rites, Canon law must be observed.Concordata 18 Catholic instruction mandatory in public schools Catholic instruction is mandatory in all public schools, except universities.Concordata 13 In Article 24 Church and State recognize each other's property rights seeming in part from the time of partition before 1918. This means, property rights and real estate titles of the Church are respected, a later agreement will define the status of expropriated Church properties, until that time, the State will pay Church dotations for its clergy. On paper the concordat seemed to be a victory for the Church. But Polish bishops felt forced to take measures against early violations, in the area of marriage legislation and property rights.

He left Cyprus when he was eighteen with his mother after the death of his father, eventually settling in England. He was one of the founding members of the Latin-American Faculty of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, and wrote the first English textbook on the subject. He was a Fellow and Examiner of the ISTD. Dimitri was also an adept linguist speaking Greek, English, French and Italian, so much so that, during World War II he worked as a translator on a prisoner of war camp for Italian prisoners of war. Later, after the war, Dimitri was in a jewellery shop buying awards for a competition, when he met Nina Hunt. She asked him to teach her to dance. They were later married, and had a son, Ian.  Latin dance in England  The rhythms that make Latin American dance popular today were first brought to this country in the early 1930s. It was a Frenchman who introduced this style to the English dance scene. He had come to Britain as a young man, and was known professionally as Monsieur Pierre, (Pierre Jean Phillipe Zurcher- Margolle, Toulon, France, circa 1890 ‚Äì London, 1963). Pierre was already an accomplished dancer and teacher in the English ballroom style when the Peanut Vendor started the rumba craze in Europe and America in 1931. The rumba and the beguine were demonstrated in London in 1932 by the French champion couple M. & Mme Chapoul at an event organised by The Dancing Times. Pierre was present and went to the Cabine Cubaine club in Paris to take a look at the dancers.Spencer, Frank and Peggy. 1968. Come dancing. Allen, London. p137 Career In 1947 Pierre, his partner Nina Hunt and colleague Doris Nicols founded the Latin American section of the Ballroom Branch of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD). Meanwhile, Dimitri had met Josephine Bradley, one of the greats of Ballroom dancing. Miss Bradley suggested to Gwenethe Walshe that she might partner up with Dimitri. Dimitri and Gwenthe were Britain's first Latin American champions winning many of the earliest competitions before going on to build on their success and become popular as demonstrators, lecturers, coaches and judges. It is hard to imagine today that there was no Latin at the Blackpool Tower, the International had not started, and the Star featured a competition in rumba only. Dimitri and Gwenethe joined the new faculty very early on. The Latin American section of the ISTD now included Gwenethe Walshe and Dimitri Petrides. This small band of dedicated specialists worked hard to establish an examination system and syllabus for both amateur and professional dancers. Sidney Francis and Walter Laird also joined somewhat later.Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing 2004. 100 years of dance: a history of the ISTD Examinations Board. London. The syllabus they worked on was eventually agreed upon by 1955 and ever since been the basis of Latin American dancing. The group improved technique and the framework for teaching and assessment dramatically in these years. Dimitri was important in pioneering and developing Latin American dancing. He worked on the figures, gave demonstrations, and taught students. He wrote one of the first technique books in English for Latin American dancing in 1949 entitled The Latin- American dances (later edition, 1960, The Latin American technique). Of this book the General Secretary of the ISTD, H. Vivian Davies said: :\\"... Dimitri Petrides is today recognised as one of the foremost authorities in this county on Latin and American dancing... the author has justly earned a reputation for authenticity and style.\\" H. Vivian Davies, Foreword to Petrides, Dimitri 1949. The Latin-American dances. London. He was also part of a later committee of examiners, which included Sidney Francis, Peggy Spencer, Doris Lavelle, Elizabeth Romain, and Doris Nichols. They prepared the Revised Latin American Technique. This states in its foreword \\"this is the official Latin-American technique upon which all future Imperial examinations are to be conducted\\" and is still used by the ISTD in five parts (one for each Latin dance). Dimitri next turned his attentions to establishing competitive dancing and set up several competitions in England including the prestigious All England Championship with Nina and Sidney Francis. He became a leading examiner and adjudicator, as well as a Fellow of the ISTD. Dimitri continued to work until his death whilst judging at the famous Blackpool Dance Festival.

On the other hand, a camouflaged convoy carrying technicians, spare parts and engines went to Chateaudun, then Etampes, Creil and Juvincourt.

Autor Jan Horn, 2010 JG 21 and JG 54 fought in the Battle of Britain as fighter escort units; LG 1 was a training unit; KG 76 engaged in night bombardment operations over England, along with KG 40 and KG 100 to a limited extent due to fuel shortages; NJG2 was a night interceptor unit against RAF Bombers; KG 51 flew the jet Me 262A2a on day jet interceptor missions against American heavy bomber attacks. Largely due to the presence of the Me 262, Ch√¢teaudun became a major target of USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps to attack the German jets on the ground. It was known that the Me 262 was relatively short-legged, with a relatively short flying radius, so the attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible on the jets to keep the jet interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) American use Ch√¢teaudun was heavily attacked on several missions by United States Army Air Force Eighth Air Force bombers in 1943 and 1944.USAFHRA document 00221368 It was liberated by Allied ground forces about 20 August 1944 during the Northern France Campaign. Almost immediately, the USAAF IX Engineering Command 832d and 833d Engineer Aviation Battalions began clearing the airport of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft, and repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. Subsequently, Ch√¢teaudun became a USAAF Ninth Air Force combat airfield, designated as \\"A-39\\" about 26 August, only a week after its capture from German forces.IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information Under American control, Ch√¢teaudun initially became the home of numerous combat groups. Initially, the 422d Night Fighter Squadron moved in and provided an air defense with P-61 Black Widows from 28 August to 16 September 1944. The Black Widows were replaced by the B-26 Marauders of the 387th Bombardment Group on 18 September, remaining until 30 October 1944. The last American combat unit to use the airfield was the 10th Reconnaissance Group, which flew a variety of photo- reconnaissance aircraft from the field during November 1944. With the combat units moving east with the front lines, Ch√¢teaudun became a transport airfield, with the 439th Troop Carrier Group flying C-47 Skytrains from the field from 4 November 1944 until 7 September 1945.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . Return to French Air Force The Americans returned control of the field to the French Air Force in September 1945 and it returned to being a French military airfield. In 1967, during the period of tension pr√©c√©ding the Six-Day War, fifty Dassault Mirage 5 jets ordered by Israel were stored on the base of Chateaudun. The settlement of this dispute took place in 1971, with the aircraft being bought by the Arm√©e de l'Air. On 13 June 1990, the base was named Lieutenant-Beau, remembering Lieutenant Marcel Beau, a pilot at Air Base 134 Versailles in 1935. Today, the remains of World War II bomb craters are very evident in the grass areas of the airfield, as well as the abandoned 05/23 secondary runway in which the wartime patching with asphalt is still visible. On 2 July 2014, the installation was closed as an Air Force Base.Dissolution de la BA 279 http://www.defense.gouv.fr/air/actus- air/la-base-aerienne-279-devient-un-ear and Diminuer les co√ªts, car les ressources diminuent http://www.opex360.com/2014/07/04/la-base- aerienne-279-de-chateaudun-transformee-en-element-air-rattache/ In 2014, the base was linked to Air Force base Orl√©ans-Bricy.

Cline starring child star Bobby Breen. A young Mennonite boy runs away from home to earn money for his widowed mother. Plot Tommy Martin (Bobby Breen) and his mother, Martha Martin (Dolores Costello) say goodbye to Henry and Reuben Johnson (John 'Dusty' King and Delmar Watson). After having stopped by the Mennonite farm, where Tommy and Martha stay with the William and Annie Decker (Robert Barrat and Dorothy Peterson), the Johnsons are headed back to their hometown of Goshen. That night over dinner, Tommy, Martha and the Decker's discuss the possibility of Tommy and Martha returning to their home in Kansas to work their farm, having fully recovered from the death of Mr. Marti. William Decker does not wish to allow them to return without the help of a man on the farm. Tommy suggests that Henry Johnson would be happy to assist. Mrs. Decker agrees that Henry had displayed affections for Martha while he was at the farm. It is decided that in order to get both Tommy and Martha home, $92 would be needed in order to pay the train fare home. To Martha's dismay, William writes Henry for the $92 if he wishes to marry Martha and send her home. Henry is to respond with a letter detailing his answer. William gives the letter to Tommy, who is to mail it when he is through with his chores. Instead, Tommy tears the letter up and does not send it. Enter Samuel Terwilliger (Charlie Ruggles), a street-smart, money-making man. Tommy tells Mr. Terwilliger that he has saved old newspapers for him to buy. As Tommy runs in the house to get the papers, a man comes by to drop off money for William Decker for a tobacco sale. Tommy takes the money and sets it on William's desk. Next to the desk is the trunk where Tommy kept the newspapers. While Tommy was rummaging through the trunk, one of the twenty dollar bills on the desk landed in a newspaper, to be taken to Mr. Terwilliger. As Tommy and Mr. Terwilliger get to talking Tommy learns about Philadelphia, Mr. Terwilliger's home town. That evening, Tommy decides to go to Philadelphia with Mr. Terwilliger, so he sneaks out of the house and hops in Mr. Terwilliger's wagon. Mr. Terwilliger and Tommy travel along the next day, and after a close- call with a train, make it to Philadelphia. Soon Tommy gets a job at the adjacent ice rink, scraping the ice after the performers practice. Back at home, William has discovered the missing twenty dollars, and blames Tommy for taking it. Every week, Tommy sends a letter home with a dollar, but William remains angry. One day as Tommy is scraping the ice, he sings along to a song the band is playing. The manager of the rink offers to hire him on as a singer for the shows. Mr. Terwilliger acts as Tommy's manager, and negotiates a wage. Later Tommy finds out that Mr.Terwilliger had been secretly keeping Tommy's money. Tommy uses the stashed money to return home. Upon his return home, he is greeted with joy from everyone except for William, who insists on the return of his twenty dollars. Tommy traces the money back in his mind, and realizes that it fell into one of the newspapers Mr. Terwilliger used to stuff an antique chair. The two of them then run around the country in order to seek the chair, and find the twenty dollars. Finally, they locate the chair, and bring the twenty dollars back home. With all debts cleared, Tommy and Martha can finally go home to Goshen where they run the farm with Henry and Reuben Johnson.

Examples include \\"A Stanley Kubrick film\\" (The Shining), \\"A film by Quentin Tarantino\\" (Pulp Fiction), and \\"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho\\" (Psycho). Possessory credit is also sometimes used in television programs; for example, Tyler Perry's House of Payne (Tyler Perry's TBS sitcom House of Payne). Occasionally another word besides \\"film\\" is used, such as \\"A Spike Lee Joint\\" or \\"A Martin Scorsese Picture\\". Possessory credit may also be given to the producer; an example of this is \\"Steven Spielberg presents Back to the Future\\". Although the earliest use of possessory credit dates from 1915's The Birth of a Nation, the use of possessory credits expanded particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has repeatedly tried to limit possessory credits to writers but has always been successfully opposed by the Directors Guild of America (DGA), leaving directors free to try to negotiate such credits if they wish.Directors Guild of America Magazine, Possessory Credit Timeline, 28(6), February 2004 Sometimes the possessory credit goes to the author of the novel on which the film was based (such as \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula,\\" \\"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet\\" and some Stephen King films). In the case of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton was not the film's director but instead the writer, producer, and a major creative voice. This may also be an example of a possessory credit being chosen for marketing reasons, as Burton was a more recognized name than the film's director, Henry Selick. The DGA encourages filmmakers to use restraint in taking credit until they have attained widespread name recognition or received at least two established awards of merit for their films, thereby securing their legacies as filmmakers.  Video games  Possessory credits are sometimes used for video games such as American McGee's Alice, Sid Meier's Civilization, games released by Tom Clancy's Red Storm Entertainment, and games in Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear series. They are also used when celebrities have licensed their names for use in games, or are involved with the game's development‚Äîfor example, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, and skater Tony Hawk's various games.

Germanisation under Bismarck In Prussia, Polish Catholics were persecuted as Poles and, during the Kulturkampf, together with German Catholics, as Catholics as well: The Kulturkampf, which Otto von Bismarck began in 1871, insinuated a Polish-Catholic-Austrian connection.Micewski 3 It was a vehicle for germanisation, as everything Polish including the language were banned from schools and offices. Jailing of Polish priests Polish priests, who taught Catholic religion in Polish were punished and jailed. Like their German counterparts, their sermons were observed and led to jail sentences as well.Kanzelparagraph, Maigesetze In 1874, Cardinal Mieczyslaw Ledochowski was jailed. Political allies among German bishops Unlike in Russia, they had powerful allies among German Catholic hierarchy and Catholic politicians like Matthias Erzberger, the most prominent Catholic politician during World War I, who often functioned as go- between with the Vatican. (Erzberger 41 ff) Indeed, after Vatican communications, Erzberger promoted a Polish kingdom to be proclaimed in Krakow with loose ties to Austria-Hungary, for which he had support in the Vatican and even Germany(Erzberger, 173) but not from the Hungarian Prime Minister Tisza in Vienna, who was afraid of losing ethnic influence. Political association with Austria-Hungary According to Erzberger, Germany proposed on one hand a large Poland to be associated with Austria-Hungary and Germany in a central-European economic union. On the other hand, German fiscal policies continued discriminating against Polish interests. Largely due to the British blockage against Germany, Polish populations suffered from hunger during German occupation, with the result, that Prussian popularity reached all time lows during World War I.(Erzberger 170‚Äì173)  Polish veto at Papal conclave  During the conclave of 1903, according to its Secretary Rafael Merry del Val, Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko of Krakow came to see him, demanding to announce his veto against Cardinal Rampolla in the name of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria of Austria-Hungary. Merry Del Val protested and refused to even accept the document, which, in the heat of the debate fell on the floor and was picked up by Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko.Von Pastor, 696 The College of Cardinals, was outraged. Rampolla, according to Merry del Val, actually gained votes after the veto. Later, he opined to Ludwig von Pastor that Rampolla never had a chance, because the cardinals wanted a new direction after the pontificate of Pope Leo XIII. After his election, the new Pope Pius X decreed automatic excommunication on anyone who should try to influence a conclave with a threat or veto.Von Pastor, 697 References Category:Pope Leo XIII Category:History of Catholicism in Poland Category:19th century in Poland ","title":"Pope Leo XIII and Poland"},{"id":"24437296","text":"Cumberbatch is an English surname.

Cours des 50 Otages, and Place Bretagne (Brittany square). With a total height of ,Tour Bretagne it dominates the skyline of the city of Nantes and is the third tallest building in France outside of Paris, after Tour Part-Dieu in Lyon and CMA CGM Tower in Marseilles. Built on the water tank, the antennas reach above the top floor. Initiated by Andr√© Morice then Mayor of Nantes, the building was conceived by French architect Claude Devorsine in the 1960s. By the time of its completion in the 1970s, public aesthetics had changed and the building was an economic failure, remaining mostly empty for a long time. It later became used for government offices. History The building dominates Nantes' skyline The tower stands on an old area in the center of the city called \\"Le Marchix\\". This old medieval quarter had been considered dirty and dangerous long before the 1943 American bombing which considerably damaged it. During the post-war redevelopment, the construction of two important modernist buildings along Place de Bretagne, housing the Treasury General, the Social Security building and the main post office inspired officials to build a skyscraper nearby. Tour Bretagne was meant to represent the economic power of the city and to display it to the world. In 1966, with the encouragement of the people of Nantes, a group called SELA (Soci√©t√© d'Equipement de Loire Atlantique) was put in charge of developing the project. SELA asked Claude Devorsine, a forgotten architect today, and Marcel Andr√©, an engineering advisor, to bring the project to reality. In 1968, the plan was to construct a six story parking garage at the base of the tower, completed with a gas station, which the cars could access via an exterior ramp. The next three levels were to be a shopping mall with space for 25 boutiques and a restaurant. The offices would occupy the rest of floors except for the top floor, which would house a restaurant that would give panoramic views of the surrounding area. The tower and the Cours des 50-Otages The work began on September 30, 1971 and was to be finished by summer 1974. However, the construction is protracted by a number of delays, mainly due to an unforeseen number of changes to the plans during construction. Finally, after five years of work, the tower was opened in 1976. Once completed, the tower was a failure. Ten years had been necessary to plan and build it and mentalities had changed since the 1960s. The building was then seen as a symbol of an inhuman urbanism focused on profit and as an architectural error distorting the traditional cityscape. It was an economic failure as well, remaining mostly empty for a long time, in part due to the high rent. The restaurant on the 29th floor was soon closed due to technical problems and free visits to the observation deck were stopped after frequent suicides. Furthermore, no businesses opened at the base of the tower as had been initially envisioned. To utilize the of office space, the city government decided to move a part of its administrative offices to the tower. Technical details Water tanks on top of the tower surrounded by antennas The tower, which measures , has eight elevators, seven escalators and a water tank on the roof that can hold . Due to change in plans, the building now has seven levels of parking, three \\"ground floors\\", a \\"level zero\\" (which is situated above street level) and 29 floors of offices topped by a few floors containing machinery. The Tax Bureau, Nantes Metrocenter, and the offices of the city Employment Bureau occupy three-quarters of the buildings floorspace. Nearly 800 people work in the tower each day. The tower is managed by a group of co- owners composed of mainly banks but also the city government. The tower today By the end of the 20th century, the inhabitants of Nantes, after long lamenting the tower's rigid and monolithic presence, have begun to begrudgingly accept the tower. One can see the gradual acceptance of the tower as it has begun to appear on a number of post cards, once thought unimaginable, and is mentioned on leaflets distributed by the tourism office. The 32nd floor terrace was reopened on June 15, 2012 after being closed for more than 10 years. Fully refurbished and secured, it hosts a restaurant and its layout suggests a huge bird's nest, hence the restaurant's name, Le Nid (\\"The Nest\\"). The terrace gives a full 360-degree view on the city and its surroundings.

This is a list of characters in the Fox television series The Cleveland Show. Main characters Cleveland Brown Cleveland Brown (voiced by Mike Henry) is the protagonist of the series. He is a portly 46-year-old African-American man who is very polite to everyone and has a unique laugh. He was formerly one of Peter Griffin's best friends in Family Guy and also owned and ran a deli. In \\"Pilot\\" he moves to the town of Stoolbend, Virginia to show his son where he grew up (even though Cleveland was in love with Donna but they were only friends and she did not know it). Eventually re-sparking his relationship with her, they get married and he and his son move in with her and her two children. Cleveland is usually depicted as exceedingly gentle and patient, and it is only on rare occasions that he has been known to lose his temper and resort to violence. However, Cleveland gets visibly annoyed with racist behavior. He often acts as the voice of caution when other characters hatch harebrained schemes. Cleveland's speech is slow and almost elongated in Family Guy, but in The Cleveland Show his voice has a wide variety. Various flashbacks give conflicting histories of his speech patterns. He is shown as a more sexual, stupid, and violent character in his new form than he was originally. Donna Tubbs-Brown Donna Tubbs Brown, voiced by Sanaa Lathan, is the second wife of Cleveland Brown who is 46 years old and works as the principal's secretary at Stoolbend High School. She has two biological children from her previous relationship with Robert (last name unknown, which is a joke later in the series), Roberta and Rallo, and she has kept her maiden name (seen in \\"Pilot\\", Cleveland says, \\"Back in high school, I would have given anything to spend the night at Donna Tubbs' house.\\"). As a result of her marriage to Cleveland, she has adopted a third child, his son Cleveland Brown Jr. Donna and Cleveland were initially best friends in high school, although Cleveland clearly had romantic feelings towards her. Donna unfortunately was for the most part oblivious to his feelings, and instead dated Cleveland's unofficial rival Robert. Despite Cleveland's attempts to get Donna to see Robert for what he truly was (a self- centered, irresponsible jerk), Donna ended up marrying Robert shortly after graduation. Seeing no reason to remain, Cleveland left Stoolbend and Donna behind. Despite many attempts at making their marriage work, Donna and Robert ended up separating due to Robert's heavy drinking and drug abuse, leaving Donna to raise their children alone. Robert would visit occasionally, but more out of selfish desire than any familial reasons. After years apart, Donna was of course overjoyed to see her best friend, Cleveland again. Cleveland and his son, who were passing through Stoolbend while driving to California, had stopped by the high school to retrace Cleveland's old haunting grounds. Donna invites the Browns to stay at her house, which results in a rekindling of their friendship that soon blossoms into a full-blown romance. The two soon marry, and honeymoon in New York City a few months later. Having been friends for years prior to getting married, Cleveland and Donna have a close relationship both sexually and platonically. Donna comes off much more patient and understanding than Cleveland's first wife, Loretta, and is more attentive to him as well. Her relationship with her children meanwhile is somewhat more shaky, as both her children are the result of a broken home and neglectful father. Donna does her best to keep her children under control, but is aware that they need a father figure at times. Yet despite any issues that she and her kids have, it is clear that they care for one another. Donna's relationship with Cleveland Jr. meanwhile is underdeveloped yet, save for the fact that Cleveland Jr. is quick to do what he can to follow Donna's wishes for fear of another divorce occurring. It is also implied that he sees Donna as the mother figure that Loretta should've been. However, she has shown to be willing to protect him from danger, such as when she saved him from an ax- wielding Donny in \\"A Nightmare on Grace Street\\" by throwing a wine glass at his head. She takes care of odd jobs, assisting Principal Wally when he is indisposed and serving as a secretary of sorts (she can type 85 words per minute). She is shown with an extremely large posterior, that is joked about often in the series. She tends to drink a lot of wine to the point she might be an alcoholic. She is a talented and proud Recorder player and wears a wig that hides her gray hair. She is quick-tempered. In \\"Mama Drama\\", it is revealed that her mother is Dee Dee Tubbs who was part of a band in the 1960s until she left Donna with Uncle Kevin. The two of them reunited by the end of the episode. Cleveland Brown Jr.  Cleveland Brown Jr., also referred to as just Junior and also Cleveland Raj Rerun Dwayne Brown (voiced by Mike Henry in \\"Family Guy,\\" Kevin Michael Richardson in \\"The Cleveland Show\\"), is the obese 14-year-old biological son of Cleveland Brown and his late ex-wife Loretta. He debuted in the season 2 episode \\"Love Thy Trophy\\" on the animated TV show Family Guy. During his time in Family Guy he was shown to be skinny, hyperactive, and athletic. He was presumably taken into Loretta's custody after she divorced Cleveland in \\"The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire\\" and has since become severely obese. He suffers from mild seizure-like episodes which he refers to as \\"brainstorms\\" and takes medication to control them. It was revealed in the episode \\"The Hurricane!\\" that he \\"doesn't believe in God\\", although he claims he is not an atheist either, which he calls \\"another religion\\". Roberta Tubbs Roberta Coretta Tubbs (sometimes Roberta Benigni Tubbs) is the 15-year-old biological daughter of Donna and her ex- husband, Robert. She looks up to Tyra Banks, hoping to one day become her co- hostess. A relatively popular girl in school, Roberta is often seen socializing with her friends, both in person, and using phones, or social networking websites. She has been dating a less than respectable boy by the name of Federline Jones, who Donna does not much approve of, but who Cleveland has managed to bully into submission. As with many popular students, Roberta often acts as a bully and a self-centered character, even towards her own family members. Neither Roberta nor her brother Rallo are initially pleased with the arrival of Cleveland and Cleveland Brown Jr., though both appear to accept their mother marrying Cleveland without much issue. In fact, Roberta and Cleveland seem to fall into a rather stereotypical father/daughter relationship, with Roberta being embarrassed by her stepfather's behavior when he attends social functions at her school. Eventually she accepts Cleveland as her father. Roberta seems to have a love/hate relationship with her brother Rallo. In the first episode, Roberta reneges on her responsibility to babysit him in order to go out with her friends. However, she seems able to share plenty of witty dialogue with her brother, apparently seeing him as something of an intellectual equal, despite his age. Roberta's relationship with Cleveland Jr. has shown promise of being a decently caring one, despite a shaky beginning. Initially both Roberta and Rallo are disturbed by how clean and attentive Cleveland Jr. is in regards to Donna's parental requests. Initially annoyed at him making them look bad and did all they could to make him miserable, they become sympathetic when they realize that he never accepted his parents' divorce and showing resentment towards his own mother for her adulterous affair and has been doing all he can to avoid giving into his sorrow. Together, Rallo and Roberta do all they can to help Cleveland Jr. let his feelings out and at the same time, they accept him as their brother. Despite her occasional kindness towards him however, Roberta regularly tends to neglect and distance from Junior and even bully him with the other popular students out of selfishness and/or on behalf of her own social structure and goals, even accusing him of stealing a chocolate bar over Rallo. She can also talk like Robert, although she seems a bit resentful of his failures as a parent compared to the sense of hero worship Rallo feels toward him. Roberta seems to have an archrival in Lacey Stapleton. Her usual clothing is a green tube top with blue jeans, gold hoop earrings and necklace and bracelets, and white and black-striped sneakers. She also wears white pearl earrings and her hair has a white streak in it. She wears pink lipstick.  Rallo Tubbs  Montclair \\"Rallo\\" Tubbs is the 5-year-old biological son of Donna and her ex- husband, Robert. He has one biological sister, Roberta. As a result of his mother marrying Cleveland, Rallo has gained Cleveland Brown Jr. as a stepbrother, Rallo has a light blue shirt with dark blue shorts and red sneakers and he sports a black Afro. His best friends are Julius and Walt. Despite his age, and the fact his father has been mostly absent most of his life, Rallo acts much like Robert, behaving at times very articulate, yet hormonally charged. He seems to get along fairly well with his mother Donna and has a normal love/hate relationship with Roberta, who at times seems to neglect him, yet at other times speaks to him as if an intellectual equal. Rallo frequently runs errands for his mother but never remembers to get the change. As a result, he is able to save enough money to buy a 1967 Mustang on eBay. His childlike defiance and hyperactive mischief when being tended to by Roberta was so extreme (including excitedly wiping himself by dragging his bare posterior on the floor) as to scare her away from sex, lest she risk creating anything like him. The fact that Rallo is some sort of child prodigy makes him an analogue of Cleveland's former neighbor, Stewie Griffin. With the new arrivals of Cleveland and Cleveland Jr., Rallo has shown some initial reluctance to accept both into his life, actively insulting them, such as joking about their weight. However, he warms up to Cleveland, who manages to teach him how to handle checking out the girls in his kindergarten class. When Cleveland inadvertently kills the family dog, Rallo is devastated by the loss, but comes to respect Cleveland for all the work he did in trying to \\"find him\\" when Rallo thought the dog was merely missing, as well as the effort Cleveland put into trying to be a good parent to Roberta. Despite being younger than his new stepbrother Cleveland Jr. Rallo seems to take a more aggressive hand in their interaction, openly insulting Junior. However, this seems to just be Rallo's way of addressing people in general, and not done with any intentional malice. In \\"Birth of a Salesman,\\" both Roberta and Rallo are disturbed by how clean and attentive Cleveland Jr. is in regards to Donna's parental requests. Initially annoyed at him making them look bad, they become sympathetic when they realize that he never accepted his parents' divorce, and has been doing all he can to avoid giving into his sorrow. Together Rallo and Roberta do all they can to help Cleveland Jr. let his feelings out and at the same time, they accept him as their brother. Rallo seems to somewhat value cleanliness and etiquette from houseguests, as demonstrated by his indignant reaction to Cleveland and Cleveland Jr., not making their beds after staying the night with the Tubbs family in the pilot. He was an antisemite, as discovered in \\"Ladies' Night\\". After befriending a Jewish senior citizen in \\"Murray Christmas\\", even going so far to celebrating Hanukah with him, it appears that he no longer is. His antisemitism is contradicted by his affection toward his stereotypically Jewish teacher, Mrs. Hadassah Lowenstein, to whom he declared, \\"You mean the world to me. The world to me!\\" In one episode, he becomes racist towards white people after learning of the history of slavery in the United States. Rallo then go on rants to kill and harm white people, but changes his stance once he sees that the Krinklesac family are not racists, are not responsible for owning slaves and actually enjoy many of the same activities and foods as himself. His favorite meal consists of fish sticks and Tater Tots, and, before his stepfather moved in, he sat at the head of the dinner table. Donna mentions in \\"Brotherly Love\\" that Rallo takes diarrhea medicine. In the episode \\"American Pranksters\\", Cleveland asks Donna why his name is Rallo. Donna replies to that question by stating it was from \\"That guy from Sanford and Son\\" (referring to Rollo Larson). Brown/Tubbs relatives * Evelyn \\"Cookie\\" Brown (voiced by Frances Callier) ‚Äì Evelyn is Cleveland's mother. Her first appearance was in the episode \\"A Brown Thanksgiving\\". She is hypercritical of Donna because she never forgave her for spurning Cleveland in favor of Robert in high school. Cleveland is quite oblivious to his mother and Donna's rough relationship. * LeVar \\"Freight Train\\" Brown (voiced by Craig Robinson) ‚Äì LeVar is Cleveland's father who is 70 years old. He is abusive towards Cleveland who he has never forgiven for humiliating him by losing a game show and a trip to Orlando for him and causing him to hide out at home in shame so long that he lost both his job and his chance to try out for the Washington Redskins, and has a history of leaving and then reuniting with his wife, Cookie, who is unaware he has more than a dozen other sons of various ages and races as seen in the episode \\"You're the Best Man, Cleveland Brown.\\" LeVar seems to be close to the Griffin family, where he calls Rallo Tubbs \\"Black Stewie.\\" He seems to resemble Jim Brown. In \\"Who Done Did It\\" it is revealed that LeVar writes mystery novels under the pseudonym of Jocelyn Elderwood. In \\"Who Done Did It?\\" while teaching Rallo and Cleveland Jr. about writing mystery novels, he leads them into proving Cleveland's innocence when he ends up in jail upon Lydia Waterman dying from what appeared to be from an egg to the head only for it to be from a peanut allergy induced by Lloyd Waterman and the Coroner. * Broderick Brown ‚Äì Cleveland's younger brother who is a doctor who first appears in the Family Guy episode He's Too Sexy for His Fat. He previously worked as a plastic surgeon in Quahog and before enlisting in the navy. He appears in the episode \\"Our Gang\\" where he rescues Cleveland and Cleveland Jr. from a drug gang by trading Afghani heroin to the gang for their freedom. * Robert (voiced by Corey Holcomb) ‚Äì Robert is Donna's first husband and the biological father of Roberta and Rallo. At the start of the show, he had grown negligent of the statuses of his children, not even knowing their names, which convinced Donna to accept Cleveland as her true love. Swearing revenge on Cleveland, Robert left with the Tubbs' pet parakeet Joan. Although since the pilot, his intentions for revenge seemed to have been forgotten. Like Cleveland, Donna's neighbors do not like Robert because of his arrogant ways where he stole Lester's good lighter (the Bic one), broke Holt's Game Boy, and even had sex with Tim's wife Arianna (as seen in \\"Cleveland Live!\\"). He is currently an unemployed bum, while Rallo thinks he is at first an FBI agent, then Santa Claus. His relationship with Roberta has seemingly worsened over time, but his relationship with Rallo has at least remained consistently decent. * Auntie Momma (voiced by Kym Whitley as a female, Kevin Michael Richardson as a male) ‚Äì Auntie Momma is Donna's caring, lovable, eccentric aunt. She is a large, fat woman whose appearance and mannerisms are a parody of Tyler Perry's character Madea. A running gag is that each time Auntie Momma shows flatulence, she says \\"I'm Outrageous!\\". Auntie Momma was originally Donna's Uncle Kevin, and when Donna was younger, her parents were never around. So Uncle Kevin becomes Auntie Momma through a sex change (though still maintaining his penis) in order to provide Donna with a strong female influence in her life. Donna is very fond of her but is unaware she used to be a man. When Cleveland finds out, he keeps it from her to preserve their relationship. Auntie Momma has sex with LeVar Brown without him realizing about the penis. LeVar had a vomit reaction to this when Cleveland told him outside of the house. In \\"Mama Drama,\\" Cleveland enlisted Auntie Momma to help him find Dee Dee Tubbs. In a flashback recalled by Dee Dee Tubbs, we are shown what Uncle Kevin looks like when Dee Dee leaves a baby Donna with him. By the end of the episode, Dee Dee finds out that Auntie Momma was Uncle Kevin after a sex change. * Loretta Brown (voiced by Roberta Taylor) ‚Äì Loretta is Cleveland's late ex-wife, and the mother of Cleveland Jr. She had a liking for cricket and the television program Friends. Early in the show, Loretta had a minimal quantity of lines, the bulk of which were \\"Mm-hmm!\\" She treats Cleveland harshly, and eventually cheats on him with Glenn Quagmire, leading the Browns to divorce. In the episode \\"Love, Blactually\\", it is revealed that Loretta has regretted her actions and wants Cleveland back, but he refuses her advances. Cleveland informs her he needs to move on, and advises her to do the same. She takes Cleveland's house in the divorce and puts it up for sale, yet is still apparently living there some months later. In \\"Gone with the Wind\\", Loretta dies in an accident where Peter drops an Apatosaurus skeleton that Brian dug up on her house while she is sitting in an upstairs bathtub causing her to go through the same bathtub gag that Cleveland goes through which she does not survive. Quagmire ended up driving her body down to Stoolbend for her funeral. * Dee Dee Tubbs (voiced by Phylicia RashƒÅd) ‚Äì The long-lost mother of Donna Tubbs who is 65 years old. Due to a musical career as a member of a musical group called \\"The Towlettes,\\" Dee Dee had to leave a baby Donna with Uncle Kevin. Many years later as seen in \\"Mama Drama,\\" Dee Dee Tubbs resurfaces where Shirley (the actress that Cleveland and Auntie Momma hired to portray Dee Dee when they were unable to find her) dies and she confronts Cleveland about the death certificate which has caused her all sorts of problems with her mortgage and health club membership. Cleveland wants to introduce her to Donna, but Dee Dee insists that all she wants is to get her life straightened out and explains that she has too many regrets. Cleveland offers to show her to Donna without anyone catching on and Dee Dee agrees. Cleveland sets up an accident and Donna is introduced to her mother as an innocent victim. After learning Dee Dee's reason for leaving her with Uncle Kevin, Donna says that she will not call Dee Dee \\"mom\\" but will call her \\"mama.\\" When Donna asks Dee Dee about Uncle Kevin, Dee Dee was surprised to figure out that Uncle Kevin was masquerading as Auntie Momma all these years. In the Family Guy episode \\"Candy, Quahog Marshmallow\\", Cleveland reveals the Dee Dee died of suicide. Neighbors A number of characters in the show live on the same street as the Brown family. All were seen attending the wedding of Cleveland and Donna Brown. Bear family * Tim (voiced by Seth MacFarlane from Season 1‚Äì3, Jess Harnell from Season 3-4) ‚Äì Tim is one of Cleveland and Donna's neighbors in Stoolbend who just happens to be a bear. He is 45 years old and lives with his wife, Arianna, and his son, Raymond. He has deep religious convictions (often attending Stoolbend Community Church and having his honeymoon in Israel). He works as a telemarketer at Waterman Cable. He becomes Cleveland's drinking buddy at The Broken Stool, where he also converses with Holt and Lester. He apparently smokes in secret, as he asks Cleveland not to tell his wife about it. He speaks with a deep Eastern European accent, has trouble with American euphemisms, and has a tendency to stammer a lot. He finds it racist when someone screams because he is a bear. Additionally, he often accidentally slashes things with his claws, something that he is quite ashamed of. In \\"Brown History Month\\", Cleveland stated that Tim's father was a black bear and that his mother was a kangaroo, actually making him a hybrid between the species rather than just a bear. Tim has often hinted at his attraction to Donna, similar to Quagmire's attraction to Lois on Family Guy. Seth MacFarlane stopped voicing the role after episode S3EP10 to focus on developing his movie Ted, so Jess Harnell took over the role for the rest of the series. * Arianna (voiced by Arianna Huffington) ‚Äì Arianna is the wife of Tim and one of Cleveland and Donna's neighbors in Stoolbend. Arianna has a son named Raymond. Like her son and husband, Arianna is a bear. She is unaware that Tim smokes, as he deliberately keeps it a secret from her. She seems like a normal stereotypical housewife. She is not against purchasing lavish things; a store that deals with foreign coffees has her credit card on file. Like her husband, she speaks with a deep Eastern European accent. She does also speak Italian, further supporting her enjoyment of foreign things. However, she makes her own confetti, suggesting she may make up for her expensive tastes in coffee by cutting costs elsewhere. In episode 21 of season one, it is revealed that Arianna was with Tim's father before she went with him. Arianna is strict and takes religion very seriously, being much more assertive in her beliefs than her husband. She can often be critical of how Donna runs her life: before Cleveland married Donna, Arianna did not allow the neighbor into her house, looking down on her status as a single mother. She has also talked down on the types of clothes Donna allows Roberta to wear. For her and Tim's honeymoon, they went to Israel. She does not approve of Raymond kissing boys or girls or of the Jewish Mrs. Lowenstein running the Christmas show. * Raymond (voiced by Nat Faxon) ‚Äì The 17-year-old son of Tim and Arianna and neighbors with Cleveland and Donna in Stoolbend. He appears briefly in the pilot at Cleveland and Donna's wedding. Raymond's father believes that he is useful for doing chores around the house that he does not want to do. Raymond is also considered popular in high school since he hangs out with Roberta, Federline, and Oliver, as seen in the episode \\"From Bed to Worse\\". However, Raymond is also smart and nicer than his friends and helps out with charities, such as spending his Thanksgiving with his family helping feed the poor in the episode \\"A Brown Thanksgiving\\". In \\"Field of Streams\\", it is revealed that he is a frequent user of marijuana and avidly listens to Pink Floyd records. Unlike his parents, who are European, Raymond speaks with an American accent. Krinklesac family * Lester Krinklesac (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) ‚Äì One of Cleveland and Donna's neighbors in Stoolbend, Lester is a 48-year-old hillbilly with a large beer gut. He is apparently on friendly terms with his neighbor Donna, being at first concerned that Cleveland is stalking Donna but promptly apologizes to her when he realizes Cleveland was an invited guest. He becomes Cleveland's drinking buddy at The Broken Stool conversing with Tim and Holt, Cleveland even helped Lester get his son back from a rather money obsessed foster family. He was thought to be a Neo- Confederate, but it was revealed that he has no clue about any of that when he proclaims that the Navy Jack adorning his house is a \\"Dukes of Hazzard flag\\". In the Season 1 finale, it is revealed Lester has a sister who is a stripper. He also appears to be very good at making racing cars. * Kendra Krystal Krinklesac (voiced by Aseem Batra) ‚Äì She is the wife of Lester the redneck. Kendra is also a redneck with a high pitched voice and is possibly disabled. She is morbidly obese (a foil to Lester, who has a distended belly), a compulsive eater, she has type 2 diabetes and even once being said that she had cholesterol that could not be measured, and wears a colostomy bag. She first appeared in the pilot episode at Cleveland and Donna's wedding. Kendra also appeared in \\"Da Doggone Daddy-Daughter Dinner Dance\\" in her house with Lester. She is often seen driving a Rascal electric scooter, although in at least one episode she becomes so enraged that she feebly gets up off the scooter and walks a short distance. In the \\"Once Upon a Tyne in New York\\" episode, her husband drives a limousine whose license plate reads \\"Virginia / IFKNDRA\\", which when properly elongated reads \\"I fuck Kendra\\". It is revealed in \\"Cleveland's Angels\\" that she is brilliant at counting cards, was once hot and skinny, and is aged 68. It is also revealed that she was previously married to a Baron. However, these last two revelations might not be true since Cleveland dismissed them as \\"stupid stories.\\" In \\"Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'\\" it was suggested that she and Lester may be half siblings from his father's second family, but in \\"To Live and Die in VA\\" it is revealed he was with her since sophomore year of high school when she was his guidance counselor. Among other things, Kendra is also revealed to be a devoted fan of Alan Alda. * Ernie Krinklesac (voiced by Glenn Howerton) ‚Äì Ernie is the 17-year-old son of Lester and Kendra and Cleveland Jr.'s best friend. Ernie first appeared in the episode \\"Pilot\\" at Cleveland and Donna's wedding. Ernie also appeared in the episode \\"The One About Friends\\" where Ernie befriended Cleveland Jr. and went so far as to wanting to move in with him. This episode also showed that the Krinklesac household was no place for Ernie to be raised, and he was taken away by child services. Ernie and his father bond when they discover that the only reason they did not want to live together was because they thought the other did not, and Lester is able to bring Ernie back home. After visiting Arnold's Whoreshack in \\"Cleveland Jr.'s Cherry Bomb\\", Ernie apparently married a whore known as \\"Two Vergine\\" Merline. Ernie also appears to work in a slaughterhouse. He apparently is very talented in woodshop (actually building a Grandfather Clock that doubles as a portal to a fantasy world). He seems to resemble Cleveland Jr. before he became overweight. Cleveland considers Ernie \\"weird\\" in which he once told Lester to \\"Keep your weird son away from my weird son.\\" * (Unnamed Sister) ‚Äì Lester's unnamed sister, who is a stripper. * Princess ‚Äì Krinklesac family's pet opossum. Richter family * Holt Richter (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) ‚Äì Holt is a 42-year-old frat boy wannabe. Holt attempts to be a suave, pop-culture reference-dropping bro, but the effect is undercut by his short stature (he is short enough to be mistaken for a child, as proven by Kendra occasionally referring to him as \\"the baby man\\"), as well as the fact that he still lives with his mother. He enjoys Game Boy and Entourage, and is frequently seen playing or practicing golf. He drives a Chrysler Crossfire named Appolonia. Holt has a tattoo of Jeremy Piven on his chest. He is a personal trainer at a local gym. * Mrs. Richter (voiced by Fergie Duhamel) ‚Äì The unnamed and unseen mother of Holt who lives with him. * General Richter (voiced by Will Arnett) ‚Äì The strict father of Holt who works in the military. Choni's family * Choni (voiced by Rosie Perez) ‚Äì Choni is a woman who is the aunt of Cecilia and the mother of Marco. She is the owner of Choni's Cantina (a Mexican restaurant). When Lester calls immigration for Cecilia's appearance in the USA without a Green Card, Choni blames Cleveland causing Cleveland Jr. and Cecilia to go on the run. In \\"There Goes El Neighborhood\\", Choni and her family move into Cleveland's neighborhood. She was still at odds with Cleveland after what nearly happened to her niece and asks him to babysit her son Marco to see if he was ignorant about her culture. In \\"The Wide World of Cleveland Brown,\\" it's revealed that Choni is related to Sof√≠a Vergara. In the episode \\"Y Tu Junior Tambien\\", it is revealed that she went to college in Puetro Rico and the accent is the only thing she learned and has a daughter named Flora who introduced Cleveland Jr. to Cecilia. * Cecilia Moreno-Brown (voiced by Elia Saldana) ‚Äì The 16-year-old niece of Choni and wife of Cleveland Jr. who works at her aunt's restaurant. Cleveland Jr. develops a crush on her in her first appearance. When Lester calls immigration for Cecilia's appearance in the USA without a Green Card, Choni blames Cleveland causing Cleveland Jr. and Cecilia to go on the run. Cleveland Jr. and Cecilia had to get engaged in order for Cecilia to remain in the US and they got married on the same day. At the end of the episode \\" Y Tu Junior Tambien\\", she wanted to end her marriage with Cleveland Jr. because she said that he was too sweet and too young to be married, but he came up with a way so Cecilia could remain in the USA. He said that they will stay married but she will live with her Aunt and he will stay with his dad and stepmother, then in a few years, they will fall in love and get married for real, and she will not get deported unless she crosses him. In \\"There Goes El Neighborhood\\", Cecilia was with Choni when she and her family moved into Cleveland's neighborhood. * Marco ‚Äì Choni's young son and Cecilia's cousin. He is only shown in the episode \\"There Goes El Neighborhood\\" when Choni asks Cleveland to babysit him while she went out. Characters based in other locations Waterman Cable * Lloyd Waterman (voiced by Bruce McGill) ‚Äì He is the head of Waterman Cable who hires Cleveland to be a salesman. His workers are Terry and Tim the Bear. He used to be a racist (stated because of his mother's teaching) but changed his views after seeing Cleveland's salesmanship. He is shown to be a homosexual, seen in the episode \\"Birth of a Salesman\\" when Cleveland is about to be fired and spies a Sex and the City mug and a collection of homoerotic pictures of Terry on Mr. Waterman's wall. He has a crush on Terry. However, he is married to Lydia Waterman who is aware that he is gay. In the Christmas episode, when Mr. Waterman shows off his reindeer, Roberta asks his wife \\"so he just keeps that poor thing locked away and then brings it out and shows it off on Christmas as a prop.\\" she replies \\"Yes. I can't imagine how that feels.\\" In \\"Who Done Did It,\\" Waterman and the coroner killed Lydia with Jasmine infused peanut oil in her soup (as Lydia has a fatal allergy to peanuts) so that they can be together (this ended up framing Cleveland with Lydia's death being from an egg). Their plot was exposed by LeVar \\"Freight Train\\" Brown, Cleveland Jr., Rallo, and Donna and they're now spending the rest of their lives in jail (even though it took a year to get Cleveland out of jail). Due to his arrest and conviction, it is implied that his company went out of business, which likely resulted in Cleveland's decision to move back to Quahog. * Terry Kimple (voiced by Jason Sudeikis) ‚Äì Terry is a high school friend of Cleveland who once took the fall for him when the two were busted for smoking marijuana. Because of moments of this, he does seem to care and respect him along with others. He has a very laid-back attitude. He installs cable, but almost loses his job when he crashes the Waterman Cable van on what would have been his third DUI. Mr. Waterman has a secret crush on Terry and has pictures of him on his wall. Cleveland eventually works beside Terry as a cable guy. He participates in Cleveland plans such as retaking his jersey or helping him save a friend. It is revealed that he has a daughter he has not seen in a year and a half in \\"Field of Streams\\" and in \\"Terry Unmarried\\" he reveals that he is bisexual, (\\"I've been with a lot of hot women, and I've been with a few hot dudes.\\") later marrying his boyfriend Paul (voiced by Justin Timberlake) in Vermont. He has a son named Terry Jr. (\\"Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'\\") and a daughter that he has not seen in years (\\"Field of Streams\\"). * Arch (voiced by Mike Henry) ‚Äì An employee of Waterman Cable. He seems to be very serious, being quite a stickler when it comes to office etiquette. * Aaron (voiced by Alec Sulkin) ‚Äì One of Cleveland's co-workers. He once helped Cleveland win a Civil War reenactment of \\"The Battle of Stoolbend\\" against B. Emerson Plunkett V. * Florence (voiced by Mike Henry) ‚Äì Florence is Lloyd Waterman's assistant who seems to be more favored than the other employees. * Jane (voiced by Fergie Duhamel) ‚Äì She is a worker at Waterman Cable. Jane is shown to love cats, as there are many in her apartment, one of which is seemingly capable of using her answering machine. She first appears in \\"Buried Pleasure\\" when Holt meets her online. They initially hit it off over their shared love of music, but the relationship gets dangerous on Holt's end when Jane gets aggressive with him and starts beating him regularly. When Cleveland, Tim, Lester, and Terry all try to get her to stop, she beats up all of them, as well, knowing they will not strike her back for being a female. She is finally driven off and forced to end her relationship with Holt after losing a brawl with Donna, who fights her out of anger for hurting Cleveland (and physical assists from Arianna and Kendra for hurting their respective husbands certainly do not hurt). She makes a cameo appearance at LeVar and Evelyn's wedding in \\"You're the Best Man, Cleveland Brown\\" (though why she was there is inexplicable, given that she was on poor terms with most of the characters). * Tori (voiced by Rutina Wesley) ‚Äì Tori is a worker that first appears in \\"Frapp Attack.\\" She started a good relationship with Cleveland which made Donna jealous. In \\"Brownsized,\\" Tori made a cameo at the assembly when Lloyd Waterman announces the company lay-off. Stoolbend High School * Principal Wally Farquhare (voiced by Will Forte) ‚Äì The Principal of Stoolbend High and a former high- school classmate of Cleveland's. He hates both Cleveland and Terry because they bullied him in high school. When he threatened to tell the principal about how Cleveland's group was drinking back when they were students, Cleveland chased him to try and beat him up, making him fall and then urinate all over himself, soaking his thighs and pocket contents. He first appeared in \\"Ladies Night,\\" where Cleveland Jr. runs for the election for Student President. He has the mannerisms of a teenager. In \\"Field of Streams,\\" he tries to get revenge on Cleveland by torching Cleveland's jersey but was stopped by Cleveland Jr. Cleveland then decides to teach Principal Wally a lesson for almost torching his jersey, as well as for calling Cleveland Jr. a \\"chubby loser.\\" However, after Cleveland corners Principal Wally, he once again urinates his pants soaking his thighs and pocket contents to Cleveland's delight. In \\"American Prankster,\\" it is shown that Principal Wally is the leader of a Boy Scouts that Cleveland Brown Jr. is a part of. Farquhare's name may be a reference to Fauquier County in Northern Virginia, and his character is described as \\"an effeminate Will Forte.\\" * Gabriel Friedman (voiced by Jamie Kennedy) ‚Äì more commonly known as Federline Jones, is Roberta's Jewish classmate and boyfriend. He is a reference to rapper Kevin Federline/\\"K-Fed.\\" In the pilot episode, Cleveland made sure Federline brought Roberta home at exactly 10PM. Cleveland has since loosened this curfew, agreeing to let Roberta come home at midnight in exchange for Federline helping Cleveland Jr. with the ladies. In \\"The One About Friends,\\" Roberta thought that if Ernie was allowed to move into the Tubbs-Brown home, Federline should be allowed to move in as well. Federline appears to only be dating Roberta for her body, not caring if she is smart as long as she is physically attractive. He spends \\"A Brown Thanksgiving\\" with her, but two hobos steal his Cutlass and he manages to retrieve it at the soup kitchen, where he learns that family is the most important thing of all. Further referencing Kevin Federline, Federline enjoys rap and hip-hop and Cleveland describes him as a lame, inside-out Oreo, overall a stereotypical wigger. His catchphrase involves him rhyming something with \\"flip\\", such as \\"script\\", followed by a high pitched sound similar to a siren. As for his rapping skills‚Äîhe gets beaten up at T.G.I. Cheney's for playing one of his recordings. Nevertheless, he has released at least one CD, \\"Fireman Killer\\". His parents, both professors, appear supportive, but behind that fa√ßade is deep disdain. His real name was revealed to be Gabriel Friedman in \\"Brotherly Love\\". In \\"Love Rollercoaster\\" he admits he only dates Roberta for her body; despite knowing this, Roberta continues to date him. However, she broke up, then made up, with him in \\"How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta?\\", then in \\"Nightmare on Grace Street\\" she pursues Edwin Mullins and Caleb while Federline is studying for his SATs. Federline's parents, Sarah and Saul Friedman (Bebe Neuwirth, Jason Alexander), teach at State College; in \\"B.M.O.C.\\" they bump into Federline and Roberta and give them the tour, impressed with the assumption that Roberta convinced Federline to attend college (they were actually trying to get away from Cleveland). Federline and his father sit in The Broken Stool planning Thanksgiving in \\"Turkey Pot Die\\" and he is inexplicably dressed similar to Abraham Lincoln during \\"Anny the Musical\\" in \\"A Vas Deferens Between Men & Women\\". * Oliver Wilkerson (voiced by Mike Henry) ‚Äì He is a popular deaf jock and school bully at Stoolbend High School. He is the captain of the school football team and often teases and torments Cleveland Jr. He leads the popular kids at his school and his closest friends are apparently Derek, Laine, and Reggie, although they are often seen without him. * Derek (voiced by Julius Sharpe) ‚Äì One of Oliver's friends at Stoolbend High School. He is also possibly his right-hand man and like Oliver, he wears a letterman's jacket and is on the school softball team and possibly the football team as well. When he attempts to join the others in making fun of other students (notably Cleveland Jr.), he goes much too far by often making incredibly inappropriate comments, much to Laine's anger. * Laine (voiced by Alec Sulkin) ‚Äì One of Oliver's friends at Stoolbend High School. He is apparently the most intelligent of Oliver's main group of friends. * Reggie (voiced by Clarence Livingston) ‚Äì One of Oliver's friends at Stoolbend High School. He is most likely the most humorous of Oliver's gang. His catchphrase is \\"Whoa!\\" and he reveals early in the series to have testicular cancer. * Kenny West (voiced by Kanye West) ‚Äì The slick Rapper of Stoolbend High. He first appears in \\"Brotherly Love.\\" Cleveland Jr. and Kenny get in a rap battle to impress a girl.

When Cleveland wanted to start up the Waterman Yards again, Cleveland found Coach McFall working as a janitor at the Broken Stool. He suffers from pronounced oral cancer from years of tobacco-chewing (as shown with part of his right cheek missing, similar to the scar seen on Jonah Hex) and is apparently homeless. In \\"Once Upon a Tyne in New York\\", it is revealed that he once went out with Tyne Daly. * Gus (voiced by David Lynch) ‚Äì The bartender at the Broken Stool, before which he studied Drama at Northwestern University. Gus seems to be on good terms with Cleveland and his friends, giving them their drinks for free. However, he may just be unintelligent as he does not pay his mortgage on the bar, and learns quite a bit of bartending from Cleveland Jr. Gus is also very lax, hiring Cleveland Jr. to work at his bar and allowing people to almost push him around. In \\"A Nightmare on Grace Street\\", it is revealed that he uses parts of human corpses as the meat in the sandwiches served at his bar, possibly to save money on real meat. In \\"Escape from Goochland\\", it is revealed that Gus is 117 years old. In \\"The Hangover Part Tubbs\\", it is revealed that Gus also runs a restaurant called Gustavo's on the second floor that is above the Broken Stool. * Larry the Leopard ‚Äì Larry is Cleveland Jr.'s stuffed toy leopard.

And then changes his opinion based on what they told him!\\" * Murray (voiced by Carl Reiner) ‚Äì Murray is a Jewish senior citizen who Rallo meets at the retirement home around Christmas time. He teaches Rallo about the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah. In the episode \\"Sex and the Biddy\\" he has a girlfriend named Hazel but does not know until after he marries her that she is a golddigger.

Due to Seth MacFarlane working on the film Ted, Tom Kenny had to cover for Seth by voicing Dr. Fist starting with \\"Skip Day.\\" In \\"Fist and the Furious,\\" it is revealed that Dr. Fist was originally called Green-Jarvis Ben-Ellis(based on BenJarvus Green-Ellis) had a private practice until he was approached by members of the New York Mafia to save one of their fellow members from multiple stab injuries. Then he was approached by the FBI to put anesthesia on the Mafia Don enough to put him in a coma so that he can go under Witness Protection. Cleveland learns this when they end up pursued by members of the New York Mafia. He was later shot by Cleveland when the New York Mafia failed to do the job. Cleveland was able to save Dr. Fist's life by doing it Operation style. Three months later, Dr. Fist decides to stay in Stoolbend now that the New York Mafia thinks that he is dead. * Donny (voiced by Danny Smith) ‚Äì Formerly a leisure-suit-wearing patron of the Broken Stool and a former acquaintance of Cleveland's, Donny was first seen in \\"How Cleveland Got His Groove Back\\", when Cleveland temporarily sought out a new circle of friends to avoid the shame of facing his current drinking buddies after Lester struck him out in baseball. However, he quickly became annoyed by Donny's tendency to frequently tell bad jokes and began to treat him fairly poorly. Donny's more prominent appearance came in \\"A Nightmare on Grace Street,\\" when Cleveland continued treating him dismissively out of sheer annoyance with him (and there were hints that this had been going on long before the events of the episode). The repeated rejections caused him to have a psychotic break, and he plotted to murder Cleveland in his home with an axe on Halloween. When he turned out not to be home, he instead settled for trying to kill Donna and Cleveland Jr., while he waited for his main target. Eventually, he simply took them prisoner until Cleveland arrived home with Rallo, at which point he attempted to kill them, as well. He was killed in self-defense in a final showdown with Cleveland (with an assist from Rallo), and his body was taken by Gus to be used for sandwich meat at the Broken Stool. * Dwayne Meighan (voiced by Mike Henry) ‚Äì Dwayne is the local television newscaster of Stoolbend. * Fern Stapleton (voiced by Kristen Wiig in the first appearance, Beth Littleford in later appearances) ‚Äì Fern is the mother of Lacey Stapleton and Kyle Stapleton. * Mike (voiced by Brandon Richardson) ‚Äì The band member leader who help Cleveland Brown and Kenny West find his street cred. * Mayor Larry Box (voiced by John Slattery) ‚Äì The Mayor of Stoolbend who is mildly-profane. * Mr. Flippers (voiced by Mike Henry) ‚Äì A magical flying walrus that would save the characters during the \\"Scene Missing\\" parts. * Reverend Jenkins (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) ‚Äì A reverend who works at the Stoolbend Community Church.

The band consists of brothers Bobby Calabrese on guitar and vocals, Jimmy Calabrese on bass and vocals, and Davey Calabrese on Drums. Calabrese has been described as \\"Melodic, hook-laden, catchy, fun, Rock with a Punk attitude.\\" They have cited other bands such as The Damned, Alkaline Trio, Black Flag, Black Sabbath, Turbonegro, The Misfits, The Hives, White Zombie/Rob Zombie, AFI, Danzig, Type O Negative, and The Ramones as influences. History Origins The three brothers were originally raised in the rural town of Antioch, Illinois in a large family of Italian American heritage. Jimmy Calabrese, the oldest of the trio, developed a fascination with horror and fictional monsters at an early age through a friend. Jimmy recalled in his blog of how after the violent suicide of a local boy, paranormal activity was witnessed and investigated by him and a group of friends via the use of a ouija board. Afterward, their house was supposedly haunted, plagued by a foul smell, and had a demonic figure appear in a door. The hauntings reportedly stopped after the family moved to Arizona. Through Jimmy, Bobby was introduced to punk rock, metal and rock and roll music. The two brothers both played bass and were separately active in a handful of local bands. In 2002, after completing film school at Columbia College, Jimmy decided the two should form their own band. Bobby switched to electric guitar and the two recruited the then sixteen-year-old Davey Calabrese, their youngest brother, to play drums. Midnight Spookshow In 2003, the band self-released the EP, \\"Midnight Spookshow\\". The EP received positive reviews from underground and indie publications from around the world. Michigan-area artist Tony O'Farell was hired to do the artwork. Aaron Carey (pipelineaudio) recorded the \\"Midnight Spookshow\\" EP at Studio Z in Phoenix Arizona. The EP was mastered by Andrew Davenport at Edgeworth Studios, New Zealand, making this a truly international affair from the start. 13 Halloweens Though retaining their original punk rock sound, \\"13 Halloweens\\" displayed a foray into a more professional quality for the band that includes catchy melodies, AFI-like wails, heavier bass and drums. Canadian artist Andrew Barr was hired for the album's artwork. A music video for \\"Backseat of my Hearse\\" was directed by local filmmaker J.D. Smith. Subsequently, the band was approached by several indie labels, including an exclusive deal with Antidote Records. The band declined the offers and instead decided to again self-release their first full-length album through their recently created record label, Spookshow Records. For the title, the band held a contest to name their next album. The winning title was \\"13 Halloweens,\\" sent in by Tempe fan Kurt Havelock under the name Nil Failstorm. The Traveling Vampire Show One year later the band released their second full-length album, The Traveling Vampire Show. The album features the artwork of Tom Bagley (of Canadian rock band, The Forbidden Dimension) and Andrew Barr. The Traveling Vampire Show continued the sound of 13 Halloweens in many ways and explored in more detail the topics of the paranormal, vampirism, and the occult. The music videos Voices of the Dead and Vampires Don't Exist were directed by famed comic book writer and film director Brian Pulido. Voices of the Dead was shot at Collins College Studio in Tempe, AZ and premiered on March 1, 2007 at Chandler Cinemas after a live performance by the band. The video for Vampires Don't Exist was used to promote Pulido's latest movie, The Graves which aired on the SyFy channel. They Call Us Death On \\"They Call Us Death,\\" Calabrese's metal and punk rock roots shine bright. With faster tempos and harder vocals, Calabrese continues to grow as songwriters. \\"They Call Us Death\\" is harder, heavier and darker than their previous albums. The Calabrese brothers have developed a much more mature style with this album. Bobby Calabrese has stated that the band was influenced by THE DEAD BOYS, THE STOOGES, The Damned, The Cult and MOT√ñRHEAD a lot on this album. The album was released March 20, 2010 on Spookshow Records. Dayglo Necros \\"Dayglo Necros\\" not only continues their legacy as one of the most consistently badass punk bands around, it manages to up their game, displaying their continued improvement ‚Äì both upon the genre and as musicians. Following in the footsteps of their last album, \\"They Call Us Death,\\" the music of \\"Dayglo Necros\\" is hard, fast, and furious, and yet manages, at times, to keep the spirit and the \\"whoa-oh-ohs\\" of their earlier efforts, \\"13 Halloweens\\" and \\"The Traveling Vampire Show.\\" This melding of the earlier, poppier sounds of their first releases with the harder sound of their more recent work. \\"Dayglo Necros\\" was released July 1, 2012 on Spookshow Records. For the title, the band held a contest to name this album. The winning title was sent in by Eric Blair from horrorpunk band, Mummula. It was inspired by the vibrant colors of the album art. Born With a Scorpion's Touch Calabrese ups the ante and adds so much raw emotion into \\"Born With A Scorpion's Touch.\\" Every piece of the album was strategic and fit perfectly together. The instrumentals were up-tempo and hard hitting enough to make you feel like you're in a mosh pit. The vocals and the lyrics were catchy and meshed well with each song. They varied their rock styles across the whole album, from punk rock to metal to pure rock n' roll, with such finesse and without skipping a beat. \\"Born With A Scorpion's Touch\\" was released October 1, 2013.

Roller grain mills are an alternative to traditional millstone arrangements in gristmills. Roller mills for rock complement other types of mills, such as ball mills and hammermills, in such industries as the mining and processing of ore and construction aggregate; cement milling; and recycling. Types Two-roller mills Two-roller mills are the simplest variety, in which the material is crushed between two rollers before it continues on to its final destination. The spacing between these two rollers can be adjusted by the operator. Thinner spacing usually leads to that material being crushed into smaller pieces. Four-roller mills Four-roller mills have two sets of rollers. When using a four-roller mill to mill grain, the grain first goes through rollers with a rather wide gap, which separates the seed from the husk without much damage to the husk, but leaves large grits. Flour is sieved out of the cracked grain, and then the coarse grist and husks are sent through the second set of rollers, which further crush the grist without damaging the crusts. Similarly, there are three-roller mills, in which one of the rollers is used twice. Five- and six-roller mills Six-roller mills have three sets of rollers. When using this type of mill on grain, the first set of rollers crush the whole kernel, and its output is divided three ways: Flour immediately is sent out the mill, grits without a husk proceed to the last roller, and husk, possibly still containing parts of the seed, go to the second set of rollers. From the second roller flour is directly output, as are husks and any possible seed still in them, and the husk-free grits are channeled into the last roller. Five-roller mills are six-roller mills in which one of the rollers performs double duty. Gristmill conversion In the 19th century roller mills were adapted to grist mills before replacing them. The mill used either steel or porcelain rollers.Flour Milling History What Makes Bread Rise?. oldrecipebook.com. Accessed 2010-11-26 Between the years 1865 and 1872, the Hungarian milling industry upgraded and expanded the use of stone mills combined with roller mills in a process known as Hungarian high milling. Hungarian hard wheat so milled was claimed as integral to the \\"First in the world\\" success of the Vienna Bakery of the 1867 Paris Exposition.

Working principle While working, motor drives the hanger of the grinding roller to rotate through V pulley and centre bearing. The roller, which is hung by bearing and pendulum shaft, will roll along the inner circle of the roll ring while the hanger is rotating. A dust removal blower will generate negative pressure at the inlet and outlet of the grinder to prevent dust and radiating the heat in the machine. History Sugar rolling mills first appeared in the Mughal Empire, using the principle of rollers as well as worm gearing, by the 17th century. The Indian roller mills used the principle of rollers as well as worm gearing.Irfan Habib (2011), Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500, page 53, Pearson Education  See also  * Calender * impact mill * unifine mill * stamp mill * crusher * pulverizer * Vertical roller mill *ball mill References Category:Grinding mills Category:Mining equipment Category:Indian inventions ","title":"Roller mill"},{"id":"24437450","text":"Thiopyrylium is a cation with the chemical formula C5H5S+. It is analogous to the pyrylium cation with the oxygen atom replaced by a sulfur atom. Thiopyrylium salts are less reactive than the analogous pyrylium salts due to the higher polarizability of the sulfur atom. Among the chalcogenic 6-membered unsaturated heterocycles, thiopyrylium is the most aromatic, due to sulfur having the similar Pauling electronegativity as carbon and only a slightly higher covalent radius. In water, thiopyrylium reacts to it and forms a mixture of 2-hydroxythiopyran and 4-hydroxythiopyran. Thiopyrylium salts can be synthesized by hydrogen abstraction from thiopyran by a hydride ion acceptor, such as trityl perchlorate. The thiopyrylium analogue of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyrylium salts can be synthesized by treatment with sodium sulfide followed by precipitation with acid. This reaction causes the oxygen atom in the pyrylium cation to be substituted with sulfur.

It is commonly known as white coral because of the branched structure of the fruit bodies that resemble marine coral. The fruit bodies are up to tall by wide, with numerous branches originating from a short rudimentary stem. The branches are one to two millimeters thick, smooth, and white, sometimes with yellowish tips in age. Ramariopsis kunzei has a widespread distribution, and is found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Taxonomy and phylogeny The species was first described as Clavaria kunzei by pioneer mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1821. E.J.H. Corner transferred the species to Ramariopsis in 1950, and made it the type species. In general, coral fungi often have extensive taxonomic histories, as mycologists have not agreed on the best way to classify them. In addition to Clavaria and Ramariopsis, the R. kunzei has been placed in the genera Ramaria by Lucien Qu√©let in 1888, and Clavulinopsis by Walter J√ºlich in 1985. According to the taxonomic database MycoBank, the species has acquired a sizable list of synonyms, listed in the taxobox. It is commonly known as white coral because of the branched structure of the fruit bodies that resemble marine coral. A phylogenetic analysis of clavarioid fungi concluded that R. kunzei is in a phylogenetic lineage together with several Clavulinopsis species (including C. sulcata, C. helvola and C. fusiformis), and that this clade (the ramariopsis clade) is nested within a group of species representing the family Clavariaceae. Description The fruit bodies of Ramariopsis kunzei are white to whitish-yellow in color, and are highly branched structures resembling coral; the dimensions are typically up to tall and wide. Older specimens may have a pinkish tinge. The tips of the branches are blunt, not crested as in some other species of coral fungi, like Clavulina cristata; branches are between 1 and 5 millimeters thick. The branch tips of mature specimens may be yellow. A stem, if present, may be up to long and scurfy‚Äîcovered with small flakes or scales. The texture of the flesh may range from pliable to brittle. This fungus does not undergo any color changes upon bruising or injury, however, a 10% solution of FeSO4 (a chemical test known as \\"iron salts\\") applied to the flesh will turn it green. In deposit, the spores are white. Viewed with a light microscope, the spores are translucent and have an ellipsoid to roughly spherical shape with spines on the surface, and dimensions of 3‚Äì5.5 by 2.5‚Äì4.5 ¬µm. Spores are non-amyloid, meaning that they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are usually 25‚Äì45 ¬µm long by 6‚Äì7 ¬µm wide, and 4-spored. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of this species. Edibility The species is edible, but \\"fleshless and flavorless.\\" Other authors concur that the odor and taste are not distinctive. Similar species Sebacina schweinitzii is a lookalike species. The \\"crested coral\\" (Clavulina cristata, edible) is similar in appearance to R. kunzei, but its branches have fringed, feathery tips. The \\"jellied false coral\\" (Tremellodendron pallidum, edible) has whitish, tough, cartilaginous branches with blunt tips. Ramariopsis lentofragilis (poisonous) is an eastern North American lookalike that causes severe abdominal pain, general weakness, and pain under the sternum. Habitat and distribution The species is thought to be saprobic and is found growing on the ground, in duff, or less frequently on well-decayed wood. Fruit bodies may grow singly, in groups, or clustered together. David Arora has noted a preference for growing under conifers, as well as a prevalence in redwood forests of North America. In contrast, an earlier author claimed this species grows \\"rarely in coniferous woods.\\" In Europe, Ramariopsis kunzei has been collected in Scotland (specifically, on the islands of Arran, Gigha and Kintyre peninsula), the Netherlands, Norway, former Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, and Russia (Zhiguli Mountains). It has also been found in China, India, Iran, the Solomon Islands, and Australia. In North America, the distribution extends north to Canada, and includes the United States (including Hawaii and Puerto Rico).

Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359 U.S. 520 (1959), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Illinois law requiring trucks to have unique mudguards was unconstitutional under the Commerce clause.  Background  The state of Illinois enacted a statute requiring curved mud guards, instead of straight mudflaps on trucks driven in Illinois. Although there was no federal regulation requiring mudflaps or mudguards, Arkansas required straight mudflaps, which were legal in at least 45 states. The Illinois legislature asserted that the unique curved mudguards would be more useful in preventing stones and other debris to be kicked up from the back of trucks, thus preventing more accidents than other types of mudflaps. The plaintiffs were trucking companies who drove through Illinois and would have to use one form of mudflap equipment while in Illinois, but other mudflap equipment while in other states. The named plaintiff was Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., of New Mexico. The only issue was whether in the absence of federal regulation, in this context did the Commerce Clause allow one State to prescribe standards that would affect interstate carriers in a way that would conflict with the standards of another State.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court held that the Illinois law was unconstitutional under the Commerce clause, technically the Dormant Commerce Clause. In Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, 359 U.S. 520, 524 (1959), the Supreme Court stated: The court was unanimous, but Justice Harlan filed a concurrence, which was joined by Justice Stewart. To find the statute unconstitutional, the Court balanced the benefit of the regulation to the state (in the form of increased safety) against the burden on interstate commerce arising from out of state truck drivers having to stop at the Illinois border and change mudguards. Because the benefit to Illinois was small and the burden on interstate commerce large, the Court held that  Subsequent developments  It is considered one of the leading precedents on the law of Interstate commerce.

He was a member of the SS since 1933. He held the ranks of SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer, General of the Waffen-SS (1944), General of Police (1942) and Ostsee Higher SS and Police leader (1939‚Äì1945). He was engaged in euthanasia during the Second World War. He was convicted after the war of crimes associated with abuses of political prisoners and Jews. He was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment.  Life  Mazuw, the son of a factory worker, was a trained metal worker. In 1918 he voluntarily joined the Navy, and saw service in the First World War. After the armistice, his ship along with the rest of the German High Seas Fleet was interned by the British at Scapa Flow. After the German Sailors scuttled their ships, they were held in English prisoner of war camps. Mazuw was returned to Germany in 1920. He remained in the Reichsmarine until 1921, then worked as a factory worker until 1925. He remained unemployed until 1932, when he worked as a truck driver in Coburg. His 1932 marriage granted him three children. In 1928 he joined the Sturmabteilung and the Nazi Party (member number: 85231), changing to join the SS in 1930 (member number: 2556). He was head of SS-Abschnitt XVIII from November 1933 until the beginning of September 1934, when he subsequently became leader of SS-Abschnitt XIII until April 1936. From 1936, Mazuw was a member of the Reichstag of the Nazi Party from the tenth to the eleventh electoral period for the 6th constituency, Pommern. From April 1936 until the beginning of May 1945, Mazuw was leader of the Ostsee SS-Oberabschnitt, and from August 1938 to the end of the same period, he was Higher SS and Police leader (HSSPF) in the district Nord (\\"North\\"), in 1940 renamed Ostsee (\\"Baltic Sea\\"), with his office in Stettin. Of eighteen HSSPFs in Nazi Germany, Mazuw was the only one who held this position more than five years.Koehl (1983), p.354 From 1940 to 1945 he was Landeshauptmann (nominal governor) of the Province of Pomerania. In this position, together with Pomeranian Gauleiter Franz Schwede-Coburg, he was engaged in the \\"Aktion T4\\" euthanasia action, aiding the dispatchment of some 1,400 mental care clients from Pomeranian sanatories in Stralsund, Ueckerm√ºnde, Treptow an der Rega, Lauenburg and Meseritz-Obrawalde to an execution site in Piasnitz, Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia, where they were shot.Browning (2007), p.187 Himmler, however, thought that Mazuw was not active enough, and in December 1944 sent him a letter of reprimand (...\\"you are a representative of the SS and not that of the local mayor or of the local party offices working against the SS\\"...).Longerich (2012), p.337 Writer Igor Witkowski has speculated that Mazuw was involved in secret programs to develop a Wunderwaffe, a new type of weapon supposed to change the course of the second world war.Farell (2006), pp.145-147, citing and referring to Witkowski (2003), pp.236-237 After the war, Mazuw was held captive. In 1948 he was prosecuted relating to denazification proceedings, and was sentenced to eight years in prison. On the basis of severely abusing political prisoners and Jews in 1933, he received another -year prison sentence in 1951.Birn. Die H√∂heren SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer. p.340.

Etok explained that lawmaking was slow because it is a thorough process that involves numerous steps. However, Etok noted that the senate passed 199 bills in the 10 years from 1999 to 2009, and told reporters that the upper chamber had done \\"very well in 10 years\\".

It has since become a sports website and international mobile content provider. History ClubCall was launched as a club-by-club telephone information service by BT Supercall (1983‚Äì87), the UK's first audiotext business set up by Kieran Levis following deregulation of the telecoms industry, which for the first time allowed fans to listen to a telephone news service dedicated to their team. Leading clubs in the then First Division (Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Newcastle United, Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool) were among the first raft of teams signed up on a revenue share basis, whereby they received a percentage of income from the calls to their official information line which quickly proved popular among fans who could hear club news, interviews and commentary on the telephone by ringing an 0898 prefixed number. The success of the new service saw ClubCall expand to cover 72 teams in England and Scotland as clubs scrambled to be part of a new and significant revenue stream. Local reporters, dedicated to a particular club, provided an at the ground news gathering service, which was fed back to ClubCall's headquarters at Downham Road, Dalston, London where it was updated by a team of editors. One of the first appointed editors was radio reporter Ian Holding, one of the current owners of the ClubCall business. In 1991, BT sold ClubCall to bookmaker Ladbrokes at a time when the premium rate telephone market was flourishing. Ladbrokes saw it as an opportunity to develop relationships with football clubs and to associate its brand with football which was becoming an increasingly important betting medium. The company operated ClubCall at a time when interest in football was heightened by the formation of the Premier League in 1992. By 1999 ClubCall was in the hands of Scottish Telecom, later Thus plc, who wanted additional call minutes for its network. Under long- serving Managing Editor Eamonn Watson, ClubCall extended its coverage to all major football tournaments in 14 countries and uniquely offered, at that time, the only match commentary service for supporters of many teams. However, by the turn of the millennium, many premium rate information services were in a period of decline as the popularity of the internet began to take hold. In 2001, Glasgow-based Thus plc wanted to focus on building sales of phone and internet services to the corporate sector and sold ClubCall and its other consumer brands (RaceCall and WeatherCall) to mobile media firm iTouch as part of a ¬£3.5 million disposal. iTouch took a conscious decision not to cannibalise the ClubCall telephone customer base and offered a minimal web presence. In contrast, competitor Teamtalk (launched as an independent telephone service in 1992 by ex ClubCall editor Ian Holding) was attracting a huge internet audience and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in April 2000 at the height of the tech-stock boom. iTouch changed its emphasis in 2004 and began tapping into its reporter base to create a web version of stories. In 2008 the ClubCall and RaceCall telephony and web services were sold to Independent Content Services Ltd, owned by Holding, as a service for mobile and the web in addition to telephone. The telephone and mobile publishing is now promoted via networks, bookmakers and media partners such as The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian Newspapers.

It is best known as being the private residence of the second spouse of Louis XIV, Madame de Maintenon. The castle has been classified as a Monument historique since 1944 by the French Ministry of Culture. Ministry of Culture database entry for Ch√¢teau de Maintenon, retrieved 9 January 2013 Description Construction The construction of the castle began in the 13th and ended in roughly the 18th century. In the early 16th century it was purchased by Louis XII's treasurer Jean Cottereau, who transformed the castle into a country house. In the 17th century it was rebuilt for Madame de Maintenon, who purchased the estate in 1674. The ch√¢teau's main features are the keep, constructed in the 13th century, and the principal corps de logis, flanked by three round towers, one at the avant-cour and the others at the bridge across the moat. The east and west wings frame a cour d'honneur, beyond which is the moat filled by the waters of the Eure, and, beyond, the parterre and park. The picturesque massing of the varied towers and roofs pleased Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand who found its special character was like that of an abbey or an old town, \\"with its spires and steeples, grouped at hap-hazard\\".Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, tr.,The memoirs of Fran√ßois Ren√© Ch√¢teaubriant 1902:238 At the far end of the gardens is the aqueduct, crossing the Canal de l'Eure, also known as the canal de Louis XIV, ordered by Louis XIV. Its colossal scale impressed Chateaubriand, who said that it was \\"a work worthy of the Caesars\\". It was constructed by the Marquis de Vauban between 1685 and 1690 in order to transport water from the Eure River to the gardens and fountains at the Ch√¢teau de Versailles. In the 17th century there was an orangerie constructed as well as stables. Interior The grande galerie The interior has been restored, and furniture and decoration can be seen. *The petits appartements (situated on the first floor of the corps de logis) include: **a passage leading to the bedroom of Madame de Maintenon, an antechamber, and a private oratory **the bedroom of the mar√©chal de Noailles, also preceded by an antechamber. *The grands appartements (part of the round tower) include: **two salons decorated in the Chinese style **the salon du Roi, Louis XIV's bedroom when he stayed at Maintenon as guest of his secret wife **a 19th-century billiard room **a library in the style Napol√©on III, the old library of Madame de Maintenon; **a portrait gallery showing painting of the House of Noailles, who inherited the property at the death of Madame de Maintenon in 1718; in the gallery there is a cenotaph in her honour. The other towers are not open to visitors. Gardens and aqueduct The aqueduct The main parterre was designed by the famous landscape architect Andr√© Le N√¥tre who also worked at Versailles, Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Marly.

In 2013, to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Andr√© Le N√¥tre, the garden was reconstructed in its initial form of a \\"french formal garden\\".http://www.chateaudemaintenon.fr/decouvrir- le-chateau/jardin-la-francaise-du-chateau-de-maintenon Two all√©es, given modern names in honour of Le N√¥tre and Racine, border the Eure river. At the far end, cutting through the gardens, is the aqueduct built from 1685 to supply the fountains of the park of the Palace of Versailles. The project meant that water was diverted from the Eure river some away. The arches of the structure reach a height of 60 feet. Vauban was in charge of the works.Ch√¢teau de Maintenon: \\"The Vauban aqueduct\\" , retrieved 9 January 2013 The aqueduct had to have 47 arcades to the first row, 195 arcades to the second and 390 to the third one.

Saga Cruises acquired the ship, at auction, in August 2009. Saga Pearl II effectively replaced the MS Saga Rose which was decommissioned in 2009. Both ships were formerly operated by Transocean Tours. The ship was given the name Saga Pearl II before embarking on her first cruise for Saga in March 2010. In May 2012, she was renamed as Quest for Adventure. In November 2013 the name reverted to Saga Pearl II. In 2019, Saga Pearl II was replaced by . History Astor The ship was built in 1981 in the ship yard of Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, Werk Ross, Hamburg, Yard no. 165. The ship was ordered by the newly formed German company Hadag Cruise Line, but was quickly sold to South African company Safmarine, because the ship was not profitable enough. However, Safmarine discovered that the Astor did not have enough speed to maintain the liner schedule. So a new ship was ordered that could meet the required schedule and the Astor sold. Arkona Arkona Baltic cruise 1989 On 29 August 1985, the Astor was sold to Deutfracht Seereederei an East German shipping company. It was renamed the Arkona. The vessel was used to give favoured party officials, cruises for part of the year and was charterd to western operators for the rest of the year. After the reunification of Germany in the early 1990s the state shipping company was privatised and became DSR. DSR acquired Seetours of Bremen.Plowman. Australian Cruise Ships p.14 Cruises on the Arkona were marketed under the Seetours franchise. Astoria P&O; Princess Cruises acquired Seetours in 1999 (Seetours was rebranded as AIDA Cruises in 2004). The Arkona was renamed Astoria in 2002 and bareboat chartered to Transocean Tours of Bremen. Under Transocean Astoria specialized in cruises to Norway and Europe. The vessel then operated closer to the shore, making low-cost cruises for German, Norwegian and Swedish passengers. In November 2008, a world cruise had to be aborted after serious mechanical problems were identified during a refit in Barcelona. The ship remained laid up in Barcelona until June 2009 when she was towed to Gibraltar. Following an auction in August, Saga Cruises acquired the ship after an unsuccessful attempt to do so earlier in the year. Saga Pearl II Saga Pearl II at Southampton in 2011 with yellow funnel In late 2009, the ship sailed to Swansea, Wales where she underwent a ¬£20million three-month refit in the re- opened Swansea dry dock. She sailed on her first cruise as Saga Pearl II on 15 March 2010 to the Norwegian Fjords. MV Quest for Adventure Split, Croatia, in September 2013 She was renamed MV Quest for Adventure in May 2012 and became the flagship for Saga's Discovery-style Adventure Cruises. She did not undergo a refit at that time but continued in her new role with the same facilities, captain and crew. In December 2012, MV Quest for Adventure underwent a refit, where she received her new Saga livery funnel. This was like her fleetmate Saga Sapphire's funnel. However, the port side of the funnel was left blank and did not display the \\"SAGA\\" logo. Saga Pearl II (again) Saga Pearl II in the Port of Tallinn in 20 September 2014 The Quest for Adventure had the name Saga Pearl II restored to it on 21 November 2013 and received the \\"SAGA\\" logo on the port side of her funnel. In 2018 Saga reverted to the traditional yellow funnel livery, Saga Pearl II was the second ship to receive the yellow funnel, in late 2018. In 2019 Saga Pearl II will be replaced by the Spirit of Discovery, Saga's first new build. For her last voyage Saga Pearl II sailed from Portsmouth (UK) on 16 February 2019 for a 54-day cruise to South Africa. This was a coming-home cruise, as it is where the ship spent many of its earlier years, when it sailed the South Atlantic waters for Safmarine. Pearl II In 2019 Saga Pearl II was sold to Aqua Explorer Holdings, who are located in the British Virgin Islands. Currently, she is based at the Greek port of Perama, where she is recorded as being laid up and also is now known as Pearl II. Design The ship has a length of and beam of .

It originally aired on September 21, 2009.  Plot  Future Ted explains how nervous he was his first day of teaching, when he was trying to figure out what kind of teacher he would be: formal disciplinarian or laid-back peer. Before the first class, Marshall gives Ted the gift of a worn leather fedora and whip, just like fictional professor Indiana Jones. That night, Ted has a dream about his first day. However, the dream quickly becomes a nightmare, causing Ted to wake in a panic and find Barney rifling through his nightstand for condoms. At the first day of class, Ted quickly becomes anxious and alternates between being stern authority figure and laid-back buddy. Recalling his dream and deciding to take Barney's advice to not take any questions during the first class, Ted fails to learn from his students that he is in the wrong classroom. When the real professor arrives and announces that the class is for Economics, a humiliated Ted races across campus to his correct classroom. Exhausted and embarrassed, Ted doesn't have the energy to think about what kind of teacher he'll be, and simply starts teaching, which turns out well. Future Ted adds that the mother had been in the Economics class, though he does not reveal where she had been sitting. Meanwhile, after Barney and Robin finally confess their feelings towards each other, Lily is ecstatic to have another couple to double date with, but the two quickly tell her they are not dating. However, following the summer, they are caught making out on Ted's couch and admit that they spent the summer secretly having sex together. They say they have tried to have some discussion about their relationship (\\"the Talk\\"), only to discover that they hate talking about feelings and defining relationships. Later that night, Marshall's law school buddy Brad asks Robin out on a date to a hockey game. At the arena, Robin is enthusiastic about the game, but admits that she feels weird going out with Brad, because she has feelings for Barney. Brad tells Robin she needs to have \\"the Talk\\" with Barney, and suddenly, they are put on the JumboTron for a public kiss. Back at the apartment, Ted tells Barney that Robin is already his girlfriend according to his \\"Gremlins\\" rule. During a tuxedo-themed night at the bar, Barney explains you cannot get a woman wet (let her shower in your house), expose her to sunlight (date her before sunset), or feed her after midnight (breakfast together), or she will turn into your girlfriend. Barney rushes to the arena and interrupts the New York Rangers \\"Kiss Cam\\" by ineffectually punching Brad in the face. After apologizing, he and Robin are still unable to admit that they are dating. Back at the apartment, after another night of sex, Robin tries to leave the room, but the doorknob detaches. Lily reveals that she sabotaged the door to force them to define their relationship. After several notes that fail to satisfy Lily, they finally sit down and have \\"the Talk\\". They recall their bad experiences in relationships and agree they are not good at them, but don't want to stop having sex with each other. They decide to lie and tell Lily that they are boyfriend and girlfriend, though the lie clearly has elements of sincerity. Lily lets them out, and Barney and Robin go out to brunch. When Ted points out to Lily that Robin and Barney are lying to her, she responds that they don't realize they aren't lying to each other, as she watches them holding hands together. Later that night, after being left out of Tuxedo Night by Ted and Barney, Marshall shows up dressed to the nines at MacLaren's.  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V.

History Located in the Southampton Parish, Southampton Golf Club, as the course was originally known, was founded in 1965 under the chairmanship of Mr. Reginald Tucker, with land being purchased in July 1965 after being given the go-ahead on 15 June 1965 from G.H. Taylor Director of Public Works. The plan however was potentially jeopardised because some of the area was originally farmland and one owner refused to sell his property to the course. Undaunted, construction finally got under way in earnest on 1 December 1967, and the project was renamed Port Royal Golf Course. The course was the creation of golf course architect, Robert Trent Jones. Design had to be changed several times initially due to land agreements, however this rerouting lead to the creation of the world famous, and much photographed, spectacular 16th hole - the tee and green of which perch precariously on cliffs overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The course was finally completed and opened in 1970. More recently, it underwent renovation in preparation for the hosting of the 2009 PGA Grand Slam of Golf. A member of the original design team, Roger Rulewich, has headed up this $14.5 million project and the course was officially reopened on 21 July 2009.

Biography An only son to Cuban immigrants, Peter Betan was born in NYC, Manhattan in 1954. In 1958 his father pursued a career opportunity with the Hilton Hotels Corporation and with his wife and only son, left Manhattan returning to Havana Cuba acquiring a position at the newly constructed Havana Hilton. Unaware of Fidel Castro's swift military advance and eventual takeover they narrowly escaped Castro's Cuban revolution and moved to San Juan Puerto Rico in early 1960 where his father obtained a position at the Caribe Hilton. The family eventually returned to NYC in the summer of 1961 settling in Woodside, Queens. At age 11 in 1965, Peter Betan started playing on an acoustic guitar his father bought for him. Soon after, he began composing songs and inventing his own chord configurations and chord diagrams. Influenced by the Beatles and the British Invasion of the 60's, at age 12 he formed and named his first band \\"The Fabulous 5\\" Playing cover songs of the day and performing at the P.S. 152 grade school auditorium in Woodside, Queens. Attracted and influenced by the virtuosic acoustic rhythm guitar strumming style of Richie Havens from the 1966 \\"Mixed Bag\\" LP, twenty eight years later Peter Betan would be the opening act for Richie Havens at the Stephen Talkhouse Miami Beach in 1994.http://www.distriktmag.com/Downloads_files/distrikt%236.pdf pg76 A self taught fingerstyle guitarist, he studied music theory and played the E‚ô≠ Tuba in the school band while attending Bryant High School in Long Island City, Queens. Later in 1974 while attending Queensboro Community College in Bayside Queens, he was accepted in the All City orchestra after city wide auditions were held. While in High School, Peter Betan had the opportunity to audition for the Juilliard School but turned down the regimented orchestral / classical music career to pursue a career in instrumental guitar composition and songwriting. Singer-songwriter guitarists like John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, Leo Kottke, Neil Young, Greg Lake and Ian Anderson were among his major influences at that time. From 1975 to 1977 he formed a duo act and then later a trio performing strictly original music in small clubs in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, playing electric and acoustic guitars, singing lead and background vocals. In 1977 he had a short stint with an original hard rock band titled \\"Galax 19\\" with Juan Santana as the lead songwriter and guitarist (no relation to Carlos Santana) Peter Betan played second electric lead and rhythm guitar and was a contributing songwriter. The band recorded a 5-song demo and showcased for a few recording labels. From 1978 to 1982 he performed in clubs at New York's Greenwich Village with his original 5 piece Fusion based band titled the \\"Peter Betan Band\\" later retitled \\"The Next\\" being the songwriter, singing lead vocals, playing electric lead guitar, rhythm, and acoustic guitars. Fusion and jazz guitar players / composers like Jeff Beck, Larry Coryell, Al Dimeola, John McLaughlin, Kenny Burrell and George Benson were among his major influences at that time. In 1979 he enrolled in a jazz guitar improvisation course thru the New School in NYC being taught by jazz musician and teacher John LaBarbera. After the breakup of his band in 1982 Peter Betan continued composing, writing songs, recording demos and doing recording session work with local bands and songwriters in the NYC area playing electric lead and rhythm guitar. In 1980 he recorded a demo as a session electric guitarist with renowned flute and saxophone player Dave Valentin for composer Jeremy Beck titled: \\"A Mad Oppy\\". Peter Betan relocated to Miami Florida in late 1985 and resumed performing professionally as an independent original solo artist from 1987 to the present, dedicated to the fingerstyle guitar playing method and becoming an avid songwriter.

Centered on time travelling 20th century doctor Claire Randall and her 18th century Scottish Highlander warrior husband Jamie Fraser, the books contain elements of historical fiction, romance, adventure and fantasy. First published and released in the United States on September 22, 2009,Official website of Diana Gabaldon the novel continues the adventures of Claire and Jamie in the 18th century, as well as their daughter, Brianna MacKenzie and her husband, Roger MacKenzie, who returned to the 20th century at the end of the previous book, A Breath of Snow and Ashes. Plot summary In the 20th century at Lallybroch, Brianna, Roger, Jem, and Mandy are reading letters from Claire and Jamie from the past, one of which mentions hidden gold, with a location known only to Jem. William Buccleigh, Roger's Scottish ancestor, accidentally appears in their time. Given his date of death on the family record, Brianna and Roger know he is unlikely to make it safely back. Rob Cameron, one of Brianna's coworkers, kidnaps Jem, and appears that he has taken Jem into the past, and Roger and William travel through time to find them; but Rob appears at Brianna's home and orders her to tell Jem to disclose the location of the gold. Jem is locked underground at the dam where Brianna and Rob work, finds an electric train, and starts an escape; his fate is unseen. In the past, Lord William Ellesmere (actually Jamie's son but raised as Lord John Grey's stepson) is involved in the American Revolution as a Redcoat, but is repeatedly embarrassed until the battle of Saratoga, wherein he distinguishes himself. Arch and Murdina Bug go after the gold on Fraser's Ridge, during a confused confrontation Mrs. Bug shoots Jamie when he tells her to stop, and Ian shoots her. Ian feels guilty for killing Mrs. Bug; Arch vows to take his revenge when Ian has 'someone worth losing'. Claire, Jamie, and Ian leave their mountain home for Scotland to see Jenny, Ian, and their children, and also to recover Jamie's printing press. Before they can leave America, they become involved in the Revolutionary War; Jamie accidentally shoots the hat off William's head at Saratoga. A kinsman of Jamie's on the British side, Simon Fraser of Balnain, is killed, and Jamie and Claire are asked to take his body back to Scotland. Before they leave, a stranger tries to blackmail Jamie, but Ian kills him. Claire, Jamie, and Ian leave for Scotland to bury Jamie's relative and Ian leaves his dog Rollo with a Quaker woman named Rachel Hunter. Jamie, Claire, and Ian reach Scotland, where Ian the elder, husband to Jamie's sister Jenny, and Jamie's best childhood friend, is dying of consumption when they arrive. Ian and Jenny are ecstatic that young Ian has returned; but Jenny is hostile to Claire who is unable to cure Ian. Jamie apologizes to Laoghaire (his second wife) for their separation. Laoghaire's daughter (and Jamie's adopted daughter) Joan requires Laoghaire to marry her lover, a crippled servant, so that she (Joan) can become a nun. A letter from Laoghaire's daughter Marsali reveals that her son, Henri- Christian, is very ill. In this missive, Marsali beseeches Claire's help in treating him. Claire agrees to return to America to treat Henri-Christian, stipulating that Laoghaire marry her lover, stop taking alimony from Jamie, and help Joan become a nun. Claire saves Henri-Christian's life, with the help of Lord John, and saves Lord John's injured nephew Henry. Lord John's niece Dottie has come to America as well, in love with Rachel's brother, a Quaker physician named Denzell Hunter. Claire receives a letter from Jamie that Ian has died and Jenny has decided to leave Lallybroch. Word later arrives that Jamie has been lost at sea; and Claire is about to be arrested for being a spy, when Lord John insists on marrying Claire for her protection, as well as for the protection of Fergus, Marsali, and their children. Arch tries to kill Rachel, but Ian fights him, until William kills Arch. Jamie returns alive, with Redcoats after him, and pretends to take Lord John hostage and flees; but William realizes that Jamie is his father, flies into a rage, and storms out.

He is recognized for his contributions to a series of important aircraft designs, most notably the Lockheed U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird. Besides the first production aircraft to exceed Mach 3, he also produced the first fighter capable of Mach 2, the United States' first operational jet fighter, as well as the first fighter to exceed 400 mph, and many other contributions to various aircraft. As a member and first team leader of the Lockheed Skunk Works, Johnson worked for more than four decades and is said to have been an \\"organizing genius\\". He played a leading role in the design of over forty aircraft, including several honored with the prestigious Collier Trophy, acquiring a reputation as one of the most talented and prolific aircraft design engineers in the history of aviation. In 2003, as part of its commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers' flight, Aviation Week & Space Technology ranked Johnson eighth on its list of the top 100 \\"most important, most interesting, and most influential people\\" in the first century of aerospace. Hall Hibbard, Johnson's Lockheed boss, referring to Johnson's Swedish ancestry, once remarked to Ben Rich: \\"That damned Swede can actually see air.\\" Life Gary Powers in front of a U-2. Kelly Johnson was born in the remote mining town of Ishpeming, Michigan. His parents were Swedish, from the city of Malm√∂, county of Scania. His father ran a construction company. Johnson was 13 years old when he won a prize for his first aircraft design. He attended Flint Central High School and graduated in 1928, then went to Flint Junior College, now known as Mott Community College, and finally to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he received a Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Aeronautical Engineering. While attending grade school in Michigan, he was ridiculed for his name, Clarence. Some boys started calling him \\"Clara\\". One morning while waiting in line to get into a classroom, one boy started with the normal routine of calling him \\"Clara\\". Johnson tripped him so hard the boy broke a leg. The boys then decided that he was not a \\"Clara\\" after all, and started calling him \\"Kelly\\". The nickname came from the popular song at the time, \\"Kelly With the Green Neck Tie\\". Henceforth, he was always known as \\"Kelly\\" Johnson.Partly supported by In 1937, Johnson married Althea Louise Young, who worked in Lockheed's accounting department; she died in December 1969. In May 1971, he married his secretary Maryellen Elberta Meade of New York; she died after a long illness on October 13, 1980, aged 46. He married Meade's friend Nancy Powers Horrigan in November 1980. His autobiography, titled Kelly: More Than My Share of it All, was published in 1985. Johnson died at the age of 80 at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank after physical deterioration and the advancement of senility, caused by the hardening of his arteries connecting to his brain. During his visits to the hospital, his good friend Ben Rich watched his condition worsen, writing, \\"His eyes seemed unfocused and lifeless, and increasingly began to slip in and out of coherence. I could barely stand to visit him, and many times he seemed not even to recognize me.\\" He is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Los Angeles, California. Lockheed career Kelly Johnson participated in the design of the Lockheed Model 10 Electra, testing a model with a single vertical stabilizer in the wind tunnel of the University of Michigan. At the University of Michigan, Johnson conducted wind tunnel tests of Lockheed's proposed Model 10 airliner. He found the aircraft did not have adequate directional stability, but his professor felt it did and told Lockheed so. Upon completing his master's degree in 1933, Johnson joined Lockheed as a tool designer on a salary of $83 a month. Shortly after starting, Johnson convinced Hall Hibbard, the chief engineer, the Model 10 was unstable. Hibbard sent Johnson back to Michigan to conduct more tests. Johnson eventually made multiple changes to the wind tunnel model, including adding an \\"H\\" tail, to address the problem. Lockheed accepted Johnson's suggestions and the Model 10 went on to be a success. This brought Johnson to the attention of company management, and he was promoted to aeronautical engineer. After assignments as flight test engineer, stress analyst, aerodynamicist, and weight engineer, he became chief research engineer in 1938. In 1952, he was appointed chief engineer of Lockheed's Burbank, California plant, which later became the Lockheed-California Company. In 1956 he became Vice President of Research and Development there. Design of Lockheed A-3 (Mach 3 ramjet), sketch from Johnson's notebook Johnson became Vice President of Advanced Development Projects (ADP) in 1958. The first ADP offices were nearly uninhabitable; the stench from a nearby plastic factory was so vile that Irv Culver, one of the engineers, began answering the intra-Lockheed \\"house\\" phone \\"Skonk Works!\\" In Al Capp's comic strip Li'l Abner, Big Barnsmell's Skonk Works ‚Äî spelled with an \\"o\\" ‚Äî was where Kickapoo Joy Juice was brewed. When the name leaked out, Lockheed ordered it changed to \\"Skunk Works\\" to avoid potential legal trouble over use of a copyrighted term. The term rapidly circulated throughout the aerospace community, and became a common nickname for research and development offices; however, reference to \\"The Skunk Works\\" means the Lockheed ADP department. Here, the F-104 Starfighter and the secret reconnaissance planes U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird were developed. Johnson led or contributed to the development of a number of aircraft. A few examples illustrate the influence of his work. In the late 1930s, Johnson helped lead the team that developed the P-38 Lightning. Eventually, almost 10,000 of these fighters were built. They played a significant role in World War II. In 1943, responding to United States Army Air Forces' concerns about Nazi Germany's development of high performance jet fighters, Johnson proposed to develop a jet airplane in six months. The result, the P-80 Shooting Star, was completed on time and became America's first operational jet fighter. The need to find space to develop the P-80 also led to the creation of the facility that would later be called the Skunk Works. Johnson also led the development of the SR-71 Blackbird family of aircraft. Through a number of significant innovations, Johnson's team was able to create an aircraft that flew so high and fast that it could neither be intercepted nor shot down. No other jet airplane has matched the Blackbird's performance. Johnson also helped to design the Lockheed AQM-60 Kingfisher a decade before the famous SR-71. The Kingfisher was a highly successful single- engine Mach 4.3-capable ramjet aircraft composed mainly of steel, which was used to test American air defenses against nuclear missiles. The information and experience Johnson gained was later used to produce the A-12 spy plane for the Central Intelligence Agency. Johnson then used the combined knowledge of the Kingfisher and A-12 to produce the SR-71 Blackbird. In 1955, at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency, Johnson initiated construction of the airbase at Groom Lake, Nevada, later known as Area 51. This project provided a secret location for flight testing the Lockheed U-2. He served on Lockheed's board of directors from 1964 to 1980, becoming a senior vice president in 1969. He officially retired from Lockheed in 1975 and was succeeded by Ben Rich, but continued as a consultant at the Skunk Works. In June 1983, the Lockheed Rye Canyon Research and Development Center in Santa Clarita was renamed Kelly Johnson Research and Development Center, Lockheed- California Company, in honor of Johnson's 50 years of service to the company. A number of factors contributed to Johnson's extraordinary career. He was a very talented designer and engineer. For instance, he could quickly and accurately estimate design characteristics such as mass, characteristics that usually were determined through long calculations. He was also ambitious and an excellent salesman, aggressively promoting ideas while also earning others' trust. In addition, he created teams and a work environment where creativity and productivity could flourish. Aircraft contributions Kelly Johnson with an early variant of the U-2. While at Lockheed, Johnson designed the P-38 Lightning fighter, made Fowler flaps work on the Model 14 Super Electra, and played a major role in converting the type into the Royal Air Force's Lockheed Hudson on short notice in 1938. He worked on the development of the Constellation for Howard Hughes' TWA airline.

Kelly Johnson's 14 Rules of Management Johnson is sometimes cited as the originator of the KISS principle,Clarence Leonard (Kelly) Johnson 1910‚Äî1990: A Biographical Memoir (PDF), by Ben R. Rich, 1995, National Academies Press, Washington, DC, p. 13. and his famed \\"down-to-brass-tacks\\" management style was summed up by his motto, \\"Be quick, be quiet, and be on time.\\" He ran Skunk Works by \\"Kelly's 14 Rules\\": # The Skunk Works manager must be delegated practically complete control of his program in all aspects. He should report to a division president or higher. # Strong but small project offices must be provided both by the military and industry. # The number of people having any connection with the project must be restricted in an almost vicious manner. Use a small number of good people (10% to 25% compared to the so-called normal systems). # A very simple drawing and drawing release system with great flexibility for making changes must be provided. # There must be a minimum number of reports required, but important work must be recorded thoroughly. # There must be a monthly cost review covering not only what has been spent and committed but also projected costs to the conclusion of the program. Don't have the books 90 days late, and don't surprise the customer with sudden overruns. # The contractor must be delegated and must assume more than normal responsibility to get good vendor bids for subcontract on the project. Commercial bid procedures are very often better than military ones. # The inspection system as currently used by the Skunk Works, which has been approved by both the Air Force and Navy, meets the intent of existing military requirements and should be used on new projects. Push more basic inspection responsibility back to subcontractors and vendors. Don't duplicate so much inspection. # The contractor must be delegated the authority to test his final product in flight. He can and must test it in the initial stages. If he doesn't, he rapidly loses his competency to design other vehicles. # The specifications applying to the hardware must be agreed to well in advance of contracting. The Skunk Works practice of having a specification section stating clearly which important military specification items will not knowingly be complied with and reasons therefore is highly recommended. # Funding a program must be timely so that the contractor doesn't have to keep running to the bank to support government projects. # There must be mutual trust between the military project organization and the contractor with very close cooperation and liaison on a day-to-day basis. This cuts down misunderstanding and correspondence to an absolute minimum. # Access by outsiders to the project and its personnel must be strictly controlled by appropriate security measures. # Because only a few people will be used in engineering and most other areas, ways must be provided to reward good performance by pay not based on the number of personnel supervised. Johnson had a 15th rule that he passed on by word of mouth. According to the book \\"Skunk Works\\" the 15th rule is: \\"Starve before doing business with the damned Navy.

It ultimately derives from basset, where the banker (dealer) pays on matching cards. The term \\"monte\\" has also been used for a variety of other gambling games, especially varieties of three-card poker,Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, pg. 162, David Parlett ‚Äì Oxford University Press (1996) and for the swindle three-card monte. History The two-card version Mexican monte, and the four-card version Spanish monte, are card games played in Spain before coming to Mexico and then the American Southwest. They were originally played with Spanish playing cards and later with cards made expressly for the game, known as Monte cards, as well as modified standard decks. These games became popular in the United States, specially in Texas, after they were brought back by returning troops from the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1848.Carson, Bridget and Rhodes, Sue (2002) \\"The Soldier's Respite Civil War Gambling, How to Play Faro, Monte & Dice\\"Frederic Gomes Cassidy & Joan Houston Hall.

One or more people may play against the house, known as the \\"bank\\" or \\"banker\\", who is the dealer.Arnold, Peter (1989) \\"Monte Bank\\" The Complete Book of Card Games Gallery Books, New York, pages 214‚Äì215, Mexican Monte In some versions, the monte banker, or dealer, must have the whole of his bank, or money which he risks at the game, in sight upon the table. The play begins with the dealer drawing one card from the bottom of the deck and placing it face up on the table, this card becomes the \\"bottom layout\\". Similarly, another card is drawn from the top of the deck, known as the \\"top layout\\", and placed face up on the table, usually closer to the dealer. The remaining stack of cards, called the \\"monte\\", is placed face-down in front of the dealer. Sometimes a monte box was used to hold the monte. The players, sometimes known as punters, place bets on the layout of their choice, or on both. Starting with the player to banker's right and proceeding counter-clockwise, each player has one chance to place his stake on the layouts. After the last player has placed his stake, the banker turns the monte face-up. The card now showing is known as the \\"gate\\". The banker pays, one for one, any bet on a matching suit. The banker takes all the bets from a layout if the \\"gate\\" did not match the suit in the layout. Spanish Monte The play in four-card monte is similar. Instead of one card in the bottom and top layouts, the dealer takes two cards from the top and two more from the bottom of the deck and place them all slightly apart upon the table to form the \\"bottom layout\\" and the \\"top layout\\", respectively.\\"The Little Giant Encyclopedia of Card Games\\", pg. 278 Diagram Group 1995 The deal is valid whatever suit appears, even if all four cards are of the same suit. Except for the banker, each player may bet on either pair or both, by placing the bet between that pair. If the \\"gate\\" card's suit matches one or both of the cards in a layout, or even cards in both layouts, the players win any bets, but if no card is matched all bets are lost. This decreases the house odds somewhat, as there are frequently two suits in a layout, increasing the possibility of a match. Coup After the hand, known as \\"coup\\", the banker collects all losing bets and pays the winners one to one, all players whose bets matched the \\"gate\\" card in the layout. He then takes both layouts off the table, placing them aside to form a discard pile. Turning the \\"monte\\" face down, he takes the used \\"gate\\" card from the bottom of the deck and also puts it on the discard pile. He then deals for the next layout without shuffling or cutting the cards. Change of banker The bank and deal remain with one player up to a maximum of five \\"coups\\", six, or any previously agreed number of hands, when all of the cards are reshuffled together and in friendly play the bank (dealer) passes to the left. At least ten cards should remain unplayed to prevent players from calculating which suits still remain in the deck. If at any time the bank is emptied, bank and deal pass to the left. In casino play, the house retains the bank. Popular culture *John Wesley Hardin killed a man over a game of monte.Metz, Leon C.

Since this was an unauthorised publication of her work the likeness is questionable. Hannah Woolley, sometimes spelled Wolley, (1622 ‚Äì c.1675) was an English writer who published early books on household management; she was probably the first person to earn a living doing this. Life Her mother and elder sisters were all skilled in \\"Physick and Chirurgery\\" and she learned from them. Nothing is known of her father.Considine, John; Wolley, Hannah (b. 1622?, d. in or after 1674), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 From 1639 to 1646 Woolley worked as a servant for an unnamed woman, almost certainly Anne, Lady Maynard (d. 1647), during which time she learned about medical remedies and recipes. She married Jerome Woolley, a schoolmaster, in 1646 and together with him ran a free grammar school at Newport, in Essex. This is very near the Maynard family's house at Little Easton. In the school she put into practice her skills at \\"physick\\". A few years later, the Woolleys opened a school in Hackney, London. She had at least four sons and two daughters, and the marriage was remembered by Hannah as a happy one. She was widowed in 1661, and from that year on began publishing books on household management. She covered such topics as recipes, notes on domestic management, embroidery instruction, the etiquette of letter writing, medicinal advice, and perfume making. These proved to be very popular. Her first book, The Ladies Directory, was published at her own expense in 1661, and this was soon reprinted in 1664. Her second book, The Cooks Guide, was printed at her publisher's expense and is dedicated to Maynard's daughter, Lady Anne Wroth (1632‚Äì1677), and her own daughter, Mary. Woolley and almanac writer Sarah Jinner are considered to be the first women professional writers. Their writings show the freedoms that were available during the commonwealth and the restoration of the monarchy. Woolley earned a reputation as a successful physician, despite her amateur status and the unwelcoming environment for female medical practitioners at that time in history. She used her books as an advertisement for her skills, and invited her readers to consult her in person. She remarried in 1666 at St. Margaret's, Westminster, to Francis Challiner, a widower two years older than herself, but he died before February 1669. Her date of death is unknown. She did not react, as she had done previously, to another plagiarised work of 1675 called The Accomplish'd Ladies Delight, so it is likely that she did not live to see it appear.

Like her authentic works, these were reprinted frequently. There has been little critical discussion about Woolley until recently, and scholarly writing on her works remains quite limited. Most academic conversations concerning Woolley focus primarily on her position as a female in a traditionally male market and her opinion on women's education. However, recent publications suggest that future discussion of Woolley may expand to include conversations about the fluidity of authorship during the 17th century and the shifting definition of authorial ownership.

Canis gezi, a poorly known small wolf from the Ensenadan of South America, appears to have given rise to Canis nehringi, a Lujanian species from Argentina. Betra's analysis in 1988, places Canis dirus and Canis nehringi as sister taxa and as the most derived members of the genus Canis in the New World. The species was first described by Florentino Ameghino in 1902.Prevosti et al., 2004, p.32  Canis gezi  An artistic rendition of two possible appearances of the dire wolf, one based on a North American origin (left) and the other on a South American origin (right)Artwork by Sergio De la Rosa Martinez (refer to the Summary of this pix) Canis dirus made its appearance in South America in the late Pleistocene, and seems to have been restricted to the north and west coasts. Its remains have not been found in the area of Argentina that produced Canis gezi and Canis nehringi, and their remains have not been found elsewhere in South America. Some researchers have proposed that Canis dirus may have originated in South America.R. M. Nowak. 1979. North American Quaternary Canis. Monograph of the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas 6:1-154, page 106 LINK:B. Kurten and E. Anderson. 1980. Pleistocene mammals of North America 1-442 In 1988, a study of these two large South American wolves described them with Canis gezi found in South American Ensenadan deposits that relate to the North American late Blancan and Irvingtonian, and Canis nehringi found in South American Lujanian deposits of the Lujan Formation that relate to the Late Pleistocene. Given their similarities and timeframes, it was proposed that Canis gezi was the ancestor of Canis nehringi. The study indicated that Canis gezi was most similar to the late Irvingtonian Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis (proposed early Dire wolf) and was its sister taxa, but Canis nehringi had a closer relationship to Rancholabrean Canis dirus. The study found that Canis dirus was the most derived genus Canis species in the New World, and compared to Canis nehringi was larger in size and construction of its lower molars that were increased for more efficient predation.Berta, A. 1988. Quaternary evolution and biogeography of the large South American Canidae (Mammalia: Carnivora). University of California Publications in Geological Sciences 132:1‚Äì49. In 2009, Tedford proposed that because there was now seen a link between Canis armbrusteri and the Rancholabrean Canis dirus, that a case could be argued for a collateral South American lineage linking Canis gezi with Canis nehringi. These two clades share dental and cranial similarities developed for hypercarnivory, suggesting a common ancestor for both clades. In 2010, a study found that DNA analysis and the dental characteristics of South America hypercanivorous canids showed a \\"South American clade\\" and the Canis clade. Canis gezi was a member of the \\"South American clade\\" of carnivores, but Canis dirus and Canis nehringi were included as derived species in the Canis clade. Canis dirus was the sister taxon of Canis lupus, but the scientific scoring used in this study for Canis nehringi was identical to those observed in Canis dirus, which supports the proposal that both could have been the same species.

The story was written by Patrick Doughtie about his son Tyler, with the screenplay penned by Doughtie, Art D'Alessandro, Sandra Thrift and Cullen Douglas. The story took place in Nashville, Tennessee, but the movie was filmed in the Orlando, Florida area. Letters to God is based on the true story of Tyler Doherty, who was played in the film by Tanner Maguire. Parts of the story are real, and others were fictionalized, such as the character of a drunken mailman named Brady McDaniels (Jeffrey Johnson), who receives Tyler's \\"letters to God\\". The film was released to theaters on April 9, 2010, with mixed reviews. Despite opening at #10 at the box office, it fell just $92,000 short of its $3 million budget with a final gross of $2.9 million.  Plot  Tyler Doherty (Tanner Maguire) is an 8-year-old cancer patient with a strong faith in Jesus and a love for writing and sending letters to God. His local postman, Walter Finley (Christopher Schmidt), picked up Tyler's first letter to God. Unsure what to do with it at first, Finley hangs onto it along with Tyler's subsequent God letters. Later, as Finley is about to leave for an extended vacation, he is very worried about who will take over his route, knowing his regulars really rely on him. He hands over Tyler's letters to his boss, Lester (Dennis Neal), making it clear he expects them to be handled with care. Lester chooses to give Finley's route to Brady McDaniels (Jeffrey Johnson). He is a veteran, an alcoholic, and a regular at a bar where he is close to the bartender, Jack (Tom Nowicki), his former commanding officer. We eventually learn that Brady was arrested for DUI while his young son was in the back seat, resulting in losing custody of his child. Brady becomes terribly depressed and drinks away his days, and nearly loses his postal job because of it. Lester feels strongly that he should be patient with Brady because there is something in him worth saving. On Brady's first day on the route, he is chased by Mrs. Baker's dog, and trips over a sprinkler while running away from the dog, gets tangled in the hose and drenched. On another day, Tyler arrives home just as Brady finished dropping off the Doherty's mail, and Tyler vomits on Brady's shoes. Brady manages to survive the challenges on the route and starts getting to know Tyler. He becomes inspired by the youngster's unwavering faith and his courage as he faces cancer. Tyler tries to deal with a bully at school by not reacting to his insults and explaining what it's like to get radiation treatments. The bully, Alex, insults Tyler again so, in defense of her friend, Samantha jumps across the lunch table and pushes Alex's face into a pile of mashed potatoes. All the kids end up at the principal's office. As time goes by, Alex is affected as he sees that Tyler's faith helps him maintain a positive attitude, and it even helps Tyler forgive Alex's bad behavior. The two end up good friends and he starts hanging out with Samantha and Tyler. Tyler's illness has reached a point where the decision is made to stop his treatments because they are no longer effective. Continuing would only sap his remaining strength so he will be allowed to live out his days in relative comfort. At an event celebrating Tyler, Brady shares how his life has been impacted by Tyler and that he was led find faith in God. Tyler later succumbs to his illness and passes away at home. Tyler's best friend, Samantha, dedicates a mailbox for letters to God, saying about Tyler that \\"his life was a letter to God.\\" The film closes with a montage showing others of faith who battled and sometimes beat cancer.

In caring for his son, Doughtie lost his job and his house, and soon his son died as well. \\"Once he passed, I decided to write a book,\\" said Doughtie, who was unsure of where telling his son's story would lead. Doughtie took a screenplay class and soon wrote the original script for Letters to God. It was noticed by Christian filmmaker David Nixon, who co-produced Sherwood Pictures' successful Christian films Facing the Giants and Fireproof. It was assumed that any story involving Tyler would include Julie Buchanan, who stole money from his cancer fund; however, Tyler's true-life cancer is instead fictionalized: an alcoholic mailman intercepts Tyler's letters to God. Doughtie wanted Letters to God to be shot in Nashville, but it was ultimately filmed in Orlando, Florida for financial reasons. David Nixon, Tom Swanson and Kim Dawson are leading a group of investors in the development of three faith- based movies through Possibility Pictures, the first being Letters to God. The film had a production budget of approximately $3 million.  Possibility Pictures  Logo of Possibility Pictures Possibility Pictures is an Orlando- based Christian film production company, created by David Nixon, Kim Dawson (producer) and Tom Swanson (executive producer). Letters to God is their first production. The company is designed to be the \\"DreamWorks of faith-based movies.\\"  Release  Letters to God was released to theaters on April 9, 2010. Nixon said he hoped the film to run in theaters for three to four months, then for it to go to Blu-ray and DVD around July or August 2010. It was released on DVD August 10. The official trailer was released Christmas week, but Christianity Today was given early access to it. The filmmakers said Tim McGraw has agreed to show the movie trailer at 16 of his concerts because he lost a family member to cancer.  Box office  Letters to God released to theaters on April 9, 2010 in 897 theaters. It debuted #10 at the box office with $1,101,204.00 in its opening weekend. Similar to recent Christian film To Save a Life, Letters to God received strong box office results in smaller markets with a higher concentration of Christian moviegoers, including Charlotte, North Carolina, and Columbus, Ohio. Tracking for the film was highest among families and females. The film dropped 43% in its second weekend, $620,580, accumulating $2,020,830 in two weeks. It closed in June 2010 after grossing $2.85 million, falling just $150,000 short of its budget. Total domestic video sales have amounted to slightly over $6 million.  Reception  Letters to God received mixed reviews: generally negative from mainstream film critics and far more positive from Christian ones. On Rotten Tomatoes it has a 25% rating based on 20 reviews. On Metacritic it has a score of 31% based on 7 reviews. John Beifuss of The Commercial Appeal called the film a \\"sometimes moving, sometimes awkward blend of sentimental family drama, childhood cancer education and Christian proselytizing\\". Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film 1¬Ω out of 4 stars, \\"Letters to God is certainly family-friendly, [but] the blandness robs it of whatever emotion or redemption the filmmakers were shooting for.\\" The NYC Movie Guru gave the film a positive review, \\"Letters to God manages to be a bighearted, uplifting and captivating drama for all ages. It will inspire you to open your heart compassionately and to find hope, faith and comfort throughout your life‚Äôs hardships.\\" The film was extremely well received by Christian film critics. The Dove Foundation gave the film five stars. Phil Boatwright of the Baptist Press called the film \\"A triumph. One of the best films you and your family will see all year.\\" Ted Baehr of Movieguide said, \\"Letters to God is an impressive movie. It is extremely well written. The dialogue is edgy and drives the story forward. The production quality is first rate. There is even great attention to the music... the type of movie you want everyone to see, one of the most encouraging and inspiring movies in a long time.\\" Plugged In said, \\"Letters to God actually goes well beyond the tried-and-true tale of a sweet kid who has cancer. It does so by adding the spiritual dimension.\\" Soundtrack A CD featuring music from the movie and a song performed by Anne Marie Boskovich was released April 22, 2010. It has currently sold 3,000 copies.

Detroit: Gale, 2002. Biography In Context. Web. 8 Oct. 2013. was a noted librarian who worked for the promotion of the library as the center of all learning, in both public and academic institutions. Shores was recognized for his integration of audiovisual materials into library collections. He was named one of the ‚Äú100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century‚Äù by American Libraries, and the impact of his vision can be seen today in libraries across the country.Kniffel, L., Sullivan, P. & McCormick, E. (1999, December). 100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century. American Libraries 30, 11. p 38. Biography Early life Louis Shores was born Louis Steinberg on September 14, 1904 in Buffalo, New York. Shores was the third of five children of Paul and Ernestine (Lutenberg) Steinberg.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. pp.1-3. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. Both immigrants, Paul was painter specializing in portraits, while Ernestine supported the household as a seamstress. The family moved a couple of times in search of better jobs and education for their family. In 1919 Shores had his first job in a library, as a page at the Toledo Public Library. It was in Toledo, Ohio that Paul died in 1923. Education When he graduated from high school in 1922, Shores attended the University of Toledo.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. pp.5-6. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. He also moved from his public library job to a position in the university‚Äôs library. It was at this time that Shores began developing his opinion that libraries and their resources could provide an overall education superior to that of more traditional instruction given in classrooms.Shores, Louis. (1972) Library Education. pp. 9- 10. Littleton, CO: Libraries Unlimited. Louis changed his last name from Steinberg to Shores in 1926, as his older brother had done when he left their childhood home in 1920. The change of name goes unmentioned by Shores in his writings and therefore the reasoning behind it remains unknown. The same year Shores changed his name he graduated from the University of Toledo and followed his family to New York City, where he attended the City College of New York in order to earn a Master's degree in Education.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. p.10. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. Upon earning his Masters, Shores could not find a teaching position. Turning his attention to a different career he enrolled at the School of Library Service at Columbia University in 1927.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. pp.12-14. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. With his Masters in Library Service, in 1928 Shores took a position at the Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1930 Shores entered University of Chicago‚Äôs Graduate Library School in order to earn his doctorate, which he left uncompleted in 1931, to return to his job at Fisk University.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. pp.37-40. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. During his year in Chicago he met and married Geraldine Urist. He would later earn a PhD in 1933‚Äînot in Library Science, but in Education‚Äîfrom the George Peabody College for Teachers, with his dissertation (later to become a published book) ‚ÄúOrigins of the American College Library, 1630-1800.‚ÄùShifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. pp.41-42. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. Career Shores left Fisk to start a new library program at Peabody in 1933. His work at Peabody, shaping and developing the library program, was interrupted by World War II. Shores was a supporter of the US's entrance into the war and joined the Army himself in 1943, at the age of 39.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. p.89. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. His duties to the US Army kept him absent from Peabody until 1946, at which point disagreements about salary and work load caused the end of his association with the college.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. pp.96-97. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. In 1946 Shores accepted two positions: to be the first Dean of the Library School at Florida State University and an editorial advisor for the encyclopedia company, P.F. Collier & Son.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. pp.101-103. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. He would maintain these two jobs for the rest of his career. Shores contributed one of the most-used reference books of his time, Basic Reference Books.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. p.81. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. First released in 1939, the only thing that prevented it from becoming a true milestone in his life and the history of library science was his lackluster updating of the text. The last edition was completed in 1954 with the updated title, Basic Reference Sources.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. pp.273-274. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. One of the highlights of Shore‚Äôs career was the American Library Association accreditation of his Library School at FSU in 1953.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. p.137. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. In 1967 Shores was forced to retire due to health issues.Shifflett, Lee. (1996) Louis Shores: Defining Educational Librarianship. p.233. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. He continued to take on as much work as he could, as an editor and speaker, when his health allowed. Shores wrote more books in this period of his life than any other: seven post-retirement to his five previously.Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2009. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009. http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC Upon his retirement, FSU gave Shores the honor of dean emeritus until his death in 1981. The school also honored him by naming a building after him in 1981, the Louis Shores Building, which houses the library school to this day. Philosophy Shores believed that libraries were places of lifelong learning and that that learning should begin early. He extolled the importance of introducing children to books and reading in infancy and encouraging learning through the use of the libraries. The generic book Shores believed in an idea he referred to as the ‚Äúgeneric book‚Äù‚Äîhis term for all materials in the library. He first published this concept in a 1958 issue of the Saturday Review and later expanded it into a book called The Generic Book.Shores, Louis. 1977. The generic book: what it is and how it works. Norman, OK: Library-College Associates. In it, Shores outlined several different formats: Print (i.e. book or journal), Graphic (globe or photograph), Projection (film or slide), Transmission (radio or tape recording), Resource (person or object), Program (computer or machine) and Extrasensory (telepathy or clairvoyance). Shores talked about how all of these things were integral to learning and that the majority of them should be found in the library. The Materials Center Shores believed that the library should be the center of the educational institution. He believed that the librarian should not just find books, but also be a teacher, and should advise students on materials to further their independent study. Shores thought a person could get more out of his or her personal drive to learn than in any classroom, and that the library was the key to this learning.Shores, Louis. (1973) Audiovisual Librarianship. p. 10. Littleton, CO: Libraries Unlimited Shores also came to believe in the importance of media beyond books. He thought the stocking of films, slides, audio recordings and maps essential for a well-rounded library collection. However, Shores did not like the presence of audiovisual departments in school; he felt the library should house all the learning materials and that every librarian should be a media specialist. He even dreamed of a library where movies and books on a given subject would be shelved together.Shores, Louis. (1973) Audiovisual Librarianship. pp. 15-18. Littleton, CO: Libraries Unlimited In 1947, Shores put his philosophy to work when setting up the library at FSU. He called the library the ‚ÄúMaterials Center‚Äù to be more inclusive of all the kinds of resources therein, including 16mm films, filmstrips, discs, tapes, slides and transparencies among others.Shores, Louis. (1973) Audiovisual Librarianship. pp. 11-14. Littleton, CO: Libraries Unlimited. The Materials Center used color-coding to indicate the format of a resource in the card catalog and had the equipment necessary to use audiovisual materials, including one of the earliest ‚Äúlistening posts‚Äù where you could listen to recordings over headphones. It was an influential idea, but took time to take effect; it was not until the mid-1960s that librarians and media-specialist became one and the same at many schools.

Although he saw distinguished service in all three conflicts, he is best known for his exploits in the Dutch East Indies in 1810 and 1811, in which he was instrumental in the capture of the islands of Amboyna and Java. Cole's early career involved extensive service in the Caribbean Sea, operating against the French during the last years of the American Revolutionary Wars and serving in several large battles. During the peace that followed, Cole remained in the Navy and forged a working relationship with Captain Edward Pellew that would last two decades. During his later career, Cole was commended for his service on operations in Surinam, and was praised in 1808 for his part in a successful diplomatic mission to Fath Ali Shah, the ruler of Persia, although the aftermath of the mission would lead to a breakdown in his relationship with Pellew, by this time the British commander in the Indian Ocean. In 1810, Cole was sent to the Dutch East Indies during a campaign to seize the Spice Islands and launched an attack on the well-fortified island of Banda Neira. Despite a disastrous start to the operation, Cole personally led a tiny force of men into the main fortress on the island and captured it, prompting a total surrender. This was followed in 1811 with an invasion of Java, which Cole planned and successfully executed. Highly praised and well rewarded for his service, Cole entered politics at the end of the war and twice sat as a member of parliament before his death in 1836. Early life Christopher Cole was born in June 1770, the son of Humphrey and Phillis Cole, in Marazion, Cornwall. In May 1780 at age nine, Cole was sent to sea to accompany his brother John, chaplain on the Royal Navy ship of the line HMS Royal Oak under Captain Sir Digby Dent. Royal Oak was stationed off North America at the time, participating in the American Revolutionary War, and Cole subsequently accompanied Dent to HMS Raisonnable and then HMS Russell, the flagship of Commodore Sir Samuel Drake in the West Indies. While serving on Russell, Cole was engaged at the Battle of Fort Royal in April 1781. In June 1781, Cole moved ships again, joining with Drake. Princessa served in numerous actions over the following year, including the Battle of the Chesapeake in September 1781, the Battle of St. Kitts in January 1782 and the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782.Tracy, p. 85 Following the Treaty of Versailles that ended the war, Cole remained in service aboard his brother Commander Francis Cole's 14-gun brig-sloop at Halifax. In May 1783, Cole moved to under Captain Thomas Foley and remained on board until February 1785 when he moved to the frigate under the command of Captain Edward Pellew. Pellew and Cole were to have a lengthy and close working relationship over the next twenty years. Cole was in Winchelsea for three years before moving to HMS Crown at the recommendation of Drake. Crown was sent to the East Indies under Commodore William Cornwallis later in 1789, and Cole, who had passed his lieutenant's examination in January was frustrated by the lengthy delay in his promotion, occasioned by distance and the death of Drake in November. War with France Cole remained in the East Indies for the next four years, moving from Crown to HMS Minerva under Cornwallis and in June 1793 becoming an acting lieutenant aboard HMS Bien Aime under Captain Richard King. In September 1793, more than four years after passing his examinations, Cole was finally promoted to lieutenant and the following year joined HMS Cerberus off Ireland under Captain John Drew, at the direct order of Lord Chatham who ensured that Cole was the most senior lieutenant aboard despite his recent promotion. In June 1795, Cole moved to HMS Sans Pareil in the West Indies under Captain Lord Hugh Seymour and in 1799 took part in the invasion of Surinam, for which service Seymour awarded him promotion to commander in the prize ship HMS Surinam. During his time in command of Surinam, Cole achieved a number of successful cruises, including the capture of two privateers and the recapture of a merchant schooner in March 1800, and introduced new regulations aboard his ship that kept his men in good health in the Caribbean Sea. In 1801, Seymour died from a fever, but Cole's activities had already been noticed by Sir John Thomas Duckworth who replaced Seymour and Cole was made a post captain on 30 June 1801 in Duckworth's flagship HMS Leviathan, followed by command of the frigate HMS Southampton the following year. Shortly after taking command of Southampton the Peace of Amiens brought the Revolutionary Wars to an end and the frigate was paid off.Tracy, p. 86 Within a year the Napoleonic Wars had begun, and Cole was returned to active service, chosen by Pellew, now a rear-admiral, to command his flagship HMS Culloden. Pellew was sent out to the Indian Ocean in 1804, and Cole remained with him there for three years, participating in the Java campaign of 1806-1807\\\\. The stress of service in the Far East caused the relationship between the two men to break down, and in March 1807 Cole took command of the new frigate HMS Doris. In 1808, Doris was detached from Pellew's command to escort a diplomatic mission under John Malcolm to Fath Ali Shah, the ruler of Persia. Throughout the mission, Cole remained at Bushire in the Persian Gulf and was rewarded for his service with the thanks of the Governor General of India and a ¬£500 award, but his conduct was publicly criticised by Pellew. Following Pellew's replacement by Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury, Doris was sent to serve in the Strait of Malacca, on a mission to obtain a working relationship with the Spanish government in the Philippines. For his successful efforts he was given command of the frigate HMS Caroline in 1809 and the following year was given command of a squadron with which to attack the Molucca Islands on a free commission. Sailing to the well-defended island of Banda Neira, Cole planned an audacious attack on 10 August 1810, his troops storming the fortress and successfully capturing it. The following year he took a leading role in the planning of the invasion of Java, which was successfully completed under Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford. For his services, he was knighted in May 1812, awarded a specially minted medal and given an honorary doctorate by the University of Oxford. In 1813, Cole returned to Europe and took command of the ship of the line HMS Rippon in the Channel Fleet. In October 1813 he captured the damaged French frigate Weser, and in February 1814 he recaptured an extremely valuable Spanish treasure ship previously seized by a French warship. On 1 September 1814, Rippon was decommissioned and Cole's career at sea came to an end after 34 years on continual service.Tracy, p. 87 Politics and retirement As a reward for his services, Cole was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1815 and at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in the same year, was presented with the Order of Maria Theresa by the Austrian Empire and the Order of St George by the Russian Empire. He also married Mary Lucy, daughter of Lord Ilchester and widow of Welsh landowner Thomas Mansel Talbot, with whom he had long been connected. The couple had no children, although Mary had six surviving children from her first marriage. His fame in Britain for the Banda Neira operation was enough to see him elected as a member of parliament in 1817 for the Glamorganshire seat, although he lost the seat the following year. In 1820 he was elected again, retaining the seat until 1830 when he made way for his stepson Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot. The Navy honoured his service with command of the royal yacht HMY Royal Sovereign in 1828 and a position as a colonel of Royal Marines in 1830. He died in August 1836 at his home in Killoy near Cardiff, Wales. His wife survived until 1855, and his stepson spent sixty years in parliament.

Inspired by many artists, including Shel Silverstein, animation has become an important aspect to the development of Louden's overall visual language. Her first series of animations were included in a 2006 solo exhibition entitled \\"Character,\\" which was a survey of paintings, drawings, installation, prints and animation at the Neuberger Museum of Art, curated by Dede Young. Also in 2006, \\"Pool\\" was included in the Art Video Lounge exhibition curated by Michael Rush for the Art Basel Miami Art Fair. Since then, Louden has continued making animations, including her latest - \\"Untitled (in dialogue with Len Lye, \\"Free Radicals\\")\\" completed in 2017. Many of her animations were surveyed in various children's film festivals in the US in 2008-2009. In particular, \\"The Bridge,\\" completed in 2008, was shown at the Birmingham Museum of Art, Weatherspoon Art Museum, Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University and Gallery Joe in Philadelphia, PA. It was also screened at the Queens International Film Festival and the New York Downtown Film Festival Audience Choice Screening in 2009. Because of positive audience response at the screening, \\"The Bridge\\" was selected for inclusion in the New York Downtown Film Festival in 2010. Her animations have also been shown in many more film festivals nationally and abroad, including the Athens International Film and Video Festival in Athens, OH and the Honolulu International Film Festival, where she received an award for Excellence in Filmmaking in 2009. In 2010, Louden was the recipient of the Bronze Palm Award from the Mexico International Film Festival for \\"The Bridge.\\" Between 2011 and 2017, Louden was commissioned by the National Gallery of Art to both create new animations and to help curate three film screenings of abstract animation: Cin√©-Concert: Art in Motion! (2011), Cin√©-Concert: Abstract Film Since 1970 (2013), and Cin√©-Concert: Contemporary Experiments in Animation (2017). \\"Footprints\\", \\"Hedge\\", \\"The Bridge\\", and \\"Carrier\\" were screened in the East Wing Auditorium in 2011; \\"Community in 2013; and \\"Untitled (in dialogue with Len Lye, \\"Free Radicals\\")\\" in 2017. During these programs Louden's animations were screened with other notable works, such as: \\"Lines Horizontal\\" Norman McLaren (1962); \\"Two Space\\" Larry Cuba (1979); \\"Free Radicals\\" Len Lye (1958); \\"Symphonie Diagonal\\" Viking Eggeling (1924); \\"Silence\\" Jules Engel (1968); and \\"Chemical Sundown\\" by Jeremy Blake (2001), to name a few. All of the animations were accompanied by live piano and percussion compositions by Andrew Simpson. Stills of animations appear in various published catalogs, such as: \\"Character\\", \\"Taking Turns\\" and \\"The Bridge\\". Ten animations (2005‚Äì2011) are also included in the Iota Center's library collection.  Public works  \\"Reflecting Tips\\" - Yahoo! Corp.

Canada (Communication No. 694/1996) was a case decided by the UN Human Rights Committee in 1999. Facts Under the Education Act of Ontario every separate school was entitled to full public funding. Separate schools were defined as Roman Catholic schools. The Education Act stated: \\"1. (1) \\"separate school board\\" means a board that operates a school board for Roman Catholics; ... 122. (1) Every separate school shall share in the legislative grants in like manner as a public school\\". As a result, Roman Catholic schools were the only religious schools entitled to the same public funding as the public secular schools.U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 Para. 2.3 The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed the law in two cases, including Adler v. Ontario.U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 Para. 2.8-2.11 Mr. Waldman wished to provide his children with a Jewish education, and he faced therefore a financial hardship, which was not experienced by a Roman Catholic parent. He contended that the Education Act violated Articles 2, 18, 26, 27 of the Covenant.U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 Para. 3.1-3.5 HRC views The Committee held that \\"the Covenant does not oblige States parties to fund schools which are established on a religious basis. However, if a State party chooses to provide public funding to religious schools, it should make this funding available without discrimination. This means that providing funding for the schools of one religious group and not for another must be based on reasonable and objective criteria. In the instant case, the Committee concludes that the material before it does not show that the differential treatment between the Roman Catholic faith and the author's religious denomination is based on such criteria\\".U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 Para. 10.6 Therefore, it has found violation of Article 26 (prohibition of discrimination) in the case. The Committee decided that in view of its conclusions in regard to article 26, no additional issue arises for its consideration under articles 18, 27 and 2. Committee's member Martin Scheinin filed a concurring opinion, noting that \\"Providing for publicly funded education in minority languages for those who wish to receive such education is not as such discriminatory, although care must of course be taken that possible distinctions between different minority languages are based on objective and reasonable grounds. The same rule applies in relation to religious education in minority religions. In order to avoid discrimination in funding religious (or linguistic) education for some but not all minorities States may legitimately base themselves on whether there is a constant demand for such education\\".U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/694/1996 Individual opinion of M. Scheinin. Para. 5 Relation with other case law A day before Waldman decision, HRC rejected a similar complaint from several Canadians as inadmissible, pointing that \\"the authors while claiming to be victims of discrimination, do not seek publicly funded religious schools for their children, but on the contrary seek the removal of the public funding to Roman Catholic separate schools. Thus, if this were to happen, the authors' personal situation in respect of funding for religious education would not be improved. The authors have not sufficiently substantiated how the public funding given to the Roman Catholic separate schools at present causes them any disadvantage\\". Four HRC members, however, submitted a separate opinion, considering the case to be admissible and drawing parallel with Waldman v. Canada.U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/67/D/816/1998 (4 November 1999) Subsequent actions In November 2005, HRC repeated that Canada should adopt steps in order to \\"eliminate discrimination on the basis of religion in the funding of schools in Ontario.\\" This was later published in their concluding observations about Canada on April 20, 2006.

He was the winning pitcher in the Expos' first-ever game in franchise history against the Mets at Shea Stadium in New York City in April 1969.Wolf, Gregory H., Don Shaw. Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project Early career A left hander listed as tall and , Shaw was born in Pittsburgh but graduated from Grover Cleveland High School in Reseda, California, in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. He attended San Diego State University on a baseball scholarship and was selected by the Mets in the 35th round in the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. After two seasons in New York's farm system, Shaw made the 1967 Mets' roster out of spring training and spent his entire rookie campaign with them, working in 40 games, all in relief, and posting a 4‚Äì5 record and three saves, with a 2.98 earned run average. It would be his only full year in MLB. Won Expos' first-ever game Shaw spent most of with Triple-A Jacksonville. Although he was effective in five late-season appearances with New York, the Mets exposed him to the expansion draft, and Montreal chose him with their 21st selection, 40th overall. After making the Expos' maiden roster, he entered the first National League game in their history on Opening Day, April 8, 1969, in the sixth inning with the score tied, 6‚Äì6. He hurled three hitless innings, walking two, as Montreal surged in front, 11‚Äì6, aided by home runs from Rusty Staub and Coco Laboy. Shaw struggled in the ninth inning, allowing a walk and three hits, including a three-run, pinch-hit home run to Duffy Dyer, but he departed with Montreal still ahead 11‚Äì10. Carroll Sembera, who relieved him, put the tying and winning runs on base before nailing down the save.Retrosheet (8 April 1969), \\"Montreal Expos 11, New York Mets 10\\" With Shaw making 35 appearances, the 1969 Expos would go on to lose 110 games in and finish last in their division; the \\"Miracle Mets\\" would stun baseball by winning the National League pennant and 1969 World Series. Strong 1971 campaign Shaw started the 1970 season in Triple-A, and his contract was sold to the Cardinals in mid-May; he got into only 14 games all year due to a broken hand and didn't return to MLB until April 1971, when he was recalled from Tulsa and added to the St. Louis bullpen corps. Shaw responded with ten consecutive scoreless relief appearances, not allowing a run between April 29 and June 2, and picking up two wins and a save.Retrosheet: 1971 STL N Regular Season Pitching Log He then experienced a rough patch, with his earned run average rising to as high as 5.18 on June 25. But from then through season's end, he returned to effectiveness, finishing with a 2.65 earned run average and a 7‚Äì2 won‚Äìlost mark. However, a sore shoulder hampered him in ; he worked in only three full innings in eight early-season games before the Cardinals sold his contract to the Oakland Athletics. After he was hit hard in three appearances, Oakland sent him to Triple-A Iowa. He played in the high minors through 1973 and then retired from professional baseball.

Biography Robert Eria Telson was born in Cannes, France, in 1949. He grew up in Brooklyn, New York, son of Paula (n√©e Blackman) and David Telson. He began studying piano when he was five years old. By nine he had already performed a Mozart piece on television and given a concert of his own compositions. At 14, he wrote 72 love songs for his first girlfriend, Margie. At 16 and 17 he studied organ, counterpoint and harmony in France with the teacher Nadia Boulanger. He followed this with a degree in music from Harvard University in 1970. Telson also played organ and composed original songs for a rock band called \\"The Bristols\\" while he was a high school student at Poly Prep in Brooklyn, New York. Several of these were recorded at Decca Studios but never released. At Harvard, he formed another group called Groundspeed, which brought him back to the Decca Studios in 1967 to record a demo recording of his songs \\"L-12 East\\" and \\"In a Dream\\" with producer Dick Jacobs. This was released by the label in 1968. After the demise of Groundspeed, Telson formed the band \\"Revolutionary Music Collective\\", which included then-unknown singer Bonnie Raitt on lead vocals. After graduation from Harvard, Telson's first professional work was as a member of the Philip Glass Ensemble from 1972‚Äì1974. After that began his immersion in ethnic world musics, as the pianist of salsa bandleaders Tito Puente and Machito. He was then organist of the gospel group Five Blind Boys of Alabama, for whom he also composed, arranged and produced. Collaborating with director/writer Lee Breuer, in 1983 he composed the musical The Gospel at Colonus, an adaptation of Sophocles's Oedipus tale, featuring Morgan Freeman, the Five Blind Boys and the Soul Stirrers. Newsweek Magazine called it: \\"The best white man‚Äôs capturings of the essence of black music since Gershwin's Porgy and Bess.\\" As a composer, Telson received an Academy Award nomination for his song \\"Calling You\\" from the movie Bagdad Caf√©, as well as Pulitzer, Grammy and Tony Award nominations for his Broadway musicals \\"The Gospel at Colonus\\" and \\"Chronicle of a Death Foretold\\", an adaptation of the Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez novel. Telson has composed soundtracks for American, French, German and Argentinian films (including five for Percy Adlon), as well as a ballet score for Twyla Tharp (Sextet) His songs have been recorded by many international artists, such as Barbra Streisand, Natalie Cole, George Benson, Joe Cocker, Celine Dion, Wynton Marsalis, k.d. lang, Shawn Colvin, Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, Etta James, Jeff Buckley, and George Michael. According to The New York Times: \\"Mr. Telson has a remarkable talent for relating to musicians from diverse musical cultures and for writing stirring, dramatic music in non-Western European idioms.\\" They also described his music as \\"a compendium of world music styles brilliantly reimagined, embellished and sometimes made to overlap by Mr. Telson, a classically trained American composer and multi-instrumentalist\\".

In 1988, he kidnapped and sexually abused three children, and was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. Ferguson was forced by public hostility and news media attention to relocate his residence on numerous occasions, from various locations in New South Wales and Queensland. Early life Ferguson was born on 5 February 1948. He was born legally blind and attended St Edmund's School for the Blind at Wahroonga. In 1958, he appeared on the front page of The Sydney Morning Herald presenting a posy of flowers to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Although his age was reported as six, he was then ten years old. His parents subsequently separated and his mother took a new partner, whom Ferguson claimed sexually abused him for seven years, even after Ferguson was declared a neglected child and placed in a state home. Shortly after his abuser died, Ferguson says he \\"pissed on his grave\\". Criminal history According to court records, Ferguson's pre-1987 criminal history contains \\"many convictions for false pretences, various assaults on children and indecent assaults on females\\", including five convictions for child molestation. In 1987 Ferguson was imprisoned in Long Bay Jail after being convicted on multiple fraud charges. After being released from Long Bay Jail in July 1987, Ferguson, then aged 39, and his 23-year-old male lover, Alexandria George Brookes, abducted three children, two boys and a girl, from Sydney aged six, seven, and eight. Ferguson had previously got to know the children's father, who was a fellow inmate in Long Bay Jail, and Ferguson was told that the children had previously been sexually abused. Ferguson and Brookes flew the children to Brisbane, and sexually assaulted them in a house in the Brisbane suburb of Kedron. The following night, Ferguson and Brookes moved the three children to a motel in the suburb of Ascot, where they again abused the children. Police arrested Ferguson and Brookes at the motel, where they found Ferguson naked with the children. Ferguson told police, \\"I can help you. Pornography. Kiddy porn, I can get you kiddy porn.\\" Ferguson claimed he was innocent, accusing one of the boys he molested of committing the crimes, but a jury found him guilty of all counts of abduction and assault of the three children. He was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment, by a judge who noted there was no chance he would be rehabilitated. While in jail he refused to take part in rehabilitation programs, and attempted to obtain police photographs of his victims under the Freedom of Information Act. An order was obtained requiring Ferguson to report his whereabouts to police after fellow inmates reported plans by him to molest the eight-year-old daughter of the family with whom he would reside after being released. In 2003, New South Wales Police surveillance located Ferguson at Parramatta Public School. Ferguson was forbidden from entering schools and claimed he was trying to distribute cleaning products for groups needing to raise funds. A court convicted him under the NSW Child Protection Offenders Registration Act, and he was sentenced to a further 15 months' prison in the John Morony Correctional Centre. He was released in December 2004. The following year, in November 2005, Ferguson was charged with sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl at her home in the Queensland town of Dalby. In a rare legal move, the judge granted Ferguson a bench trial (without a jury), as he considered Ferguson would not receive a fair trial by jury, due to the enormous amount of media coverage. The judge found that while the girl had been molested when Ferguson, convicted child sexual abuser Allan Guy, and another man had been at her house, it could not be proven that Ferguson had been responsible for the abuse. Relocation After being released from jail in 2004, Ferguson was forced to move from numerous locations in Queensland, due to public pressure and media attention. Angry residents forced him to flee the towns of Bundaberg, Toowoomba and Murgon. In February 2005, he settled in Ipswich with another paedophile, but was again found by neighbours and the media. There were reports of rocks being thrown at his house. A judge awarded Ferguson $2,250 in compensation from an invalid Ipswich pensioner who pleaded guilty to threatening to kill him. Other protests have been more peaceable. In July 2008, he moved to a rural property near Miles, Queensland, but after word of his location spread, cars began to arrive at the property, and the police were called after 60 people began chanting anti-Ferguson slogans. In 2009, he moved into a public housing apartment in the Sydney suburb of Ryde where he was given a five-year lease. Some residents of the area were outraged at Ferguson's presence, after news organisations revealed where he was living - near a primary school and playgrounds. Angry males shouted on the street, and police found a Molotov cocktail near Ferguson's apartment building; Ferguson claimed that one man broke into his house and assaulted him. By 2010, neighbours had forced him to leave Ryde. New South Wales Police attempted to obtain a court order banning Ferguson from public pools and parks, after he began frequenting a pool during primary school children's swimming lessons. While the safety order was denied by a judge, they did succeed in obtaining an order requiring him to notify the child protection authority before engaging in charity activities that would put him in contact with children, a precaution that was prompted after he was spotted selling children's toys for a charity for which he had registered using his middle name, Ray. Ferguson had been selling them without a legally mandated permit and police approval. A program set up by the federal government agency Centrelink to reunite missing persons was suspended indefinitely in September 2009, after it was discovered that Ferguson had accessed the service to reunite with his 1987 criminal accomplice, Alexandria George Brookes. In 2010, controversy arose when a portrait of Ferguson with his mentor, Brett Collins from Justice Action, was entered in the Archibald Prize. NSW Premier Kristina Keneally said that it had gone too far in terms of artistic license. On 8 July 2012, Ferguson was spotted by The Daily Telegraph at Circular Quay in the Sydney CBD, selling RSPCA merchandise under the name, Ray Ferguson and holding up a tin of kangaroo-shaped biscuits. His stall offered various animal-shaped shortbread biscuits, pens, stickers and badges for the RSPCA. When confronted by journalist Clementine Cuneo, Ferguson declined to say whether he had notified police about his charity work. \\"They know about me, that's all I will say,\\" he said. That night the RSPCA said that it had no idea that the man named Ray who signed up as a volunteer fundraiser was a child sex offender. NSW Police obtained an order requiring Ferguson to notify the Child Protection Authority before engaging in any charity work that could put him in contact with children. Ferguson confirmed he was Dennis Ferguson, using his middle name for charity work. Police said that the details on the Child Protection Register could not be made public. Legislative changes In September 2009, in response to public anger at Ferguson living in the Ryde area in the Northern Suburbs region of Sydney, the Government of New South Wales under Premier Nathan Rees and the Housing Minister David Borger moved to introduce legislation to allow the government to evict child sex offenders from public housing. Critics dubbed the legislation the Dennis Ferguson Act, and said it was created as a result of the state government caving in to vigilantism. Death On 30 December 2012, Ferguson was found dead in his Surry Hills Flat in inner-Sydney. He had been dead for several days before his body was found. On 6 January 2013, News Limited reported that Ferguson deliberately ended his life by discontinuing his diabetes medication. However, friends said that Ferguson left no suicide note and was feeling confident about his upcoming court case, after being caught trying to sign up to do volunteer work with children in Bondi Junction in October and November. It also reported that shortly before his death, he had told supporters that police were making his life a \\"living hell\\". Ferguson's advocate, the Justice Action campaigner Brett Collins, said that the police continuously \\"undermined\\" Ferguson's efforts to redeem himself and claimed that the police had informed the media about his whereabouts at least twice. After Ferguson's death, his former counsellor, Wendell Rosevear, explained how Ferguson had worked to address his behaviour. In an interview with ABC News, Rosevear said that Ferguson was \\"honest about the dimensions of his own life, both victimisation and perpetration\\" and stated his opinion that such honesty is \\"the biggest predictor of someone's resolution.\\" See also * List of Australian criminals References Category:1948 births Category:2012 deaths Category:20th-century Australian criminals Category:21st-century Australian criminals Category:Australian fraudsters Category:Australian kidnappers Category:Australian people convicted of child sexual abuse Category:Australian people convicted of indecent assault Category:Blind people from Australia Category:Criminals from Sydney Category:Deaths from diabetes Category:Disease- related deaths in New South Wales Category:Prisoners and detainees of New South Wales Category:Prisoners and detainees of Queensland ","title":"Dennis Ferguson"},{"id":"24438975","text":"Lieutenant-General Zahid Ali Akbar (; b. 1933) , was an engineering officer in the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers, who oversaw the civil construction of the Army GHQ in Rawalpindi, and later directing the Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL), a top secret research facility developing the clandestine atomic bomb program in the 1970s.

In addition to his secretive role in the atomic bomb feasibility in the 1970s, he took up charge on collecting military intelligence on the India's nuclear program but later in the 1980s, he was appointed as an Engineer-in-Chief at the Army GHQ. His war appointment also included the command of the X Corps but appointed as Chairman of Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) as a secondment in 1984‚Äì89. In 1989‚Äì90, he then headed the Defence Science and Engineering Organization, and later Chairing the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), witnessing the national team winning the Cricket World Cup in 1992. His role in the atomic bomb program remains well hidden until memoirs written by dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan in 2009. Biography Early life and career in the military Zahid Ali Akbar Khan was born in Jullundur, Punjab in British India, in 1933. After the partition of India in 1947 that led to the independence of Pakistan from the British Empire, his family eventually moved to Lahore and completed his education from there. Akbar applied and was accepted at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, and decided to attend the Military College of Engineering in Risalpur in 1950 to study engineering. In 1953, he graduated with bachelor's degree in civil engineering with honours, and was commissioned as 2nd Lt. in the Corps of Engineers of Pakistan Army. Capt. Akbar also attended the Command and Staff College in Quetta, where he qualified and graduated as psc in the 1960s. His career in the civil engineering spent mostly with the Corps of Engineers, participating in the second war with India in 1965, where Major Akbar led the combat engineering company against the Indian Army. In 1967, Lieutenant- Colonel Akbar was directed towards joining the National Defence University (NDU), alongside with then-Lt-Col. Mirza Aslam Beg, and graduated with MSc in War studies in 1971. In 1973, Col. Akbar was sent to join the University of Engineering and Technology in Lahore, and graduated with the MSc in civil engineering, focusing towards the surveying, in 1975. Upon graduation in 1975, Col. Akbar was appointed to military secretary to then-President Fazl Illahi, and remained in this assignment until 1976 when he was promoted to Brigadier- a field officer rank in the Pakistan Army, only to be posted back at the Corps of Engineers. During this time, he aided to oversee in the matters of civil engineering of the Army GHQ at the vicinity of the JS HQ in Rawalpindi to President Illahi. Constructing Kahuta and directing of ERL In 1974, the program on producing the military-grade U92 started by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) under Munir Ahmad Khan after India announced of conducting of a surprised nuclear test at the Pokhran Test Range, an Indian Army base. Initially, the project was under Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, an engineer, who was utilizing the controlled gaseous method at the Air Force Laboratory then-located in the Chaklala Air Force Base. Though, Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood had been satisfied with the progress in 1975‚Äì76, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan was less so, eventually became a complaint of the progress and leadership led by Mahmood to Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who also agreed. Acting on advice from Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, Prime Minister Bhutto turned to his army chief General Zia-ul-Haq to find a capable engineering manager. In August 1976, Brig. Akbar had been well known of his involvement in the civil engineering projects with the Pakistan Army, and was approved by then-army chief General Zia-ul-Haq to be part of the clandestine atomic bomb programme. Brig. Akbar was asked with meet with Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan in this regards, and eventually complained of his military service for military engineering project but understood the nature the new assignment when he was briefed. Brig. Akbar surveyed the isolated and remote Kahuta Tehsil and decided to construct the national laboratory with Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan being the chief scientist. A draft report was submitted to then- Defence Secretary Ghulam Ishaq Khan who after conferring with General Ali Nawab authorized the acquiring of the land surveyed by the Corps of Engineers in 1976. Leading the massive construction efforts of building the national laboratory, Brig. Akbar had carefully scrutinized the papers of many civil contractors and had decided to give the contract of some very important buildings to Brig. Mahmoodul Haq Alvi (later Major-General) of the Corps of Engineers. In 1977, Brig. Akbar became one of the directors at Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL) and worked on interdisciplinary projects with the army engineers from Corps of EME. On 7 July 1978, Brig. Akbar was temporarily promoted to the two-star rank army general as it was felt that the title \\"general\\" would hold more sway with the academic scientists working on the confidential projects. However, upon his promotion, Akbar was transferred away from ERL on martial law administrative duty rather than appointed as Director General at ERL. Similarly in 1979 Akbar was not awarded the prestigious HI(M) medal alongside fellow 2 star General S A Nawab who was also working on the ERL project with Akbar. Eventually, Akbar became in-charge of ERL after he made Lt General and earned his Hilal i Imtiaz (Military) in the 1980s under President General Zia ul Haq. Earlier in his career, he had also worked as a field officer and a civil engineer at ERL. However, to suggest that as a field officer in the Army, with no foreign purchasing experience he was made responsible for establishing ERL in 1974, under Ghulam Ishaq Khan without being given a General officer rank, without a Director General appointment and without being awarded prestigious medals is difficult to imagine. Brig. Akbar worked extremely closely with PAEC chairman Munir Ahmad Khan to hold discussion on constructing the discuss the weapon-testing laboratories under the control environment, and was said to be extremely impressed with the breadth of Munir Khan's knowledge ranging from engineering to theoretical physics, and Khan's comprehensive understanding of the military affairs in the international politics. After meeting with President Zia-ul-Haq, Brig. Akbar recommended and lobbied for Munir Ahmad Khan's leadership in the program as Brig. Akbar noted to President Zia that Munir Khan had a breadth of knowledge of understanding the military affairs and knew the broad knowledge would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics, but chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance, mathematics, and engineering, which he found lacking in other civilian scientists. After the departure of Mubashir Hassan, Major General Akbar formed the committee that was assigned for meeting the needs for the classified projects and to supervise the financial funding, concerning the development of centrifuge facilities at Kahuta. Major-General Akbar took responsibility of making critical decisions on prioritizing the various methods of gas centrifuges and acquiring raw materials needed by the scientists and engineers. In 1980, Major-General Akbar was promoted to three- star army general, and took over the command of the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers as its Engineer-in-Chief to deal with senior people whose cooperation was required. Lieutenant general Akbar took the responsibility on operations research for collecting the military intelligence on India's nuclear program, after being aware of Israel's surprised airstrike on the Iraq's working nuclear power plant in 1981. Lieutenant general Akbar worked in close coordination with Air Chief Marshal Anwar Shamim, then-chief of air staff, on securing the national laboratories and nuclear infrastructure in the country. On foreign affairs, Lieutenant general Akbar assisted President Zia on intelligence matters to deftly neutralized international pressure by tagging Pakistan's atomic bomb programme to the aggressive designs of neighboring India's nuclear program. He met with Munir Khan and Agha Shahi, then-Foreign Minister, drew a five-point proposal as a practical rejoinder to world pressure on Pakistan to sign the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT)‚Äî the points including the renouncing of the use of nuclear weapons. Staff and War appointments in Pakistan Army In 1982, Lieutenant general Akbar left his charge as an Eng-in-C of Corps of Engineers, after being shifted as Adjutant-General at the Army GHQ. He left the directorship of ERL that had been renamed KRL in 1981 to honor Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan Lieutenant general Akbar oversaw the control over the nuclear infrastructure from military to civilian hands when Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission took control over the program to ensure the safety and prevention of nuclear accidents. On 31 March 1984, Lieutenant general Akbar was posted as GOC-in-C of the X Corps, working under Lieutenant general Mirza Aslam Beg, then-Chief of General Staff at the Army GHQ. He led the several military operations against the Indian Army on the Siachen when Indian Army seized the control over the glaciers from Pakistan. Lieutenant general J.D. Khan, his predecessor, gave him a detailed briefing about this operational plan and particularly stressed the importance of intelligence keeping a watch on Indian moves beyond Leh in Indian- controlled Kashmir. He became involved in many operations that were launched under then command of then-Brig. Pervez Musharraf working as his subordinate. After the war After the Siachen conflict in 1984, Lieutenant general Akbar was appointed by President Zia as the chairman of Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), an energy conglomerate, as a Secondment. During this time, he began cementing influential ties with the civil servants in the civilian bureaucracy, which irked Prime Minister M.K. Junejo. In 1987, he was in race for the four-star rank appointment and promotion but became involved in a major controversy between President Zia and the Prime Minister M.K. Junejo over the appointment of vice-chief of army staff, the operational command post of the Pakistan Army. Initially, President Zia had appointed Lieutenant general Akbar as vice-army chief over the senior-most Lieutenant general Mirza Aslam Beg, then-GOC-in-C of the XI Corps. However, Prime Minister M.K. Junejo refused to confirm that appointment, insisting on appointing the Lieutenant general Mirza Aslam Beg as vice-army chief on merit. Eventually, Prime Minister Junejo used his pejorative to elevate Lieutenant general Mirza Aslam Beg as vice-army chief and publicly announced in the news media of promoting Lieutenant general Mirza Aslam Beg to the four-star army general. Prime Minister Junejo directed Lieutenant general Akbar to take over the directorship of the DESTO, which was voided since President Zia kept him as chair of the WAPDA. In 1988, his appointment secondment to the chairman of WAPDA was later confirmed by confirmed by then-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1988 In 1989, Lieutenant general Akbar advised Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of placing the country's civilian nuclear power plants under his energy corporation that would end the international concerns but the request was not implemented despite Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto willingness. In 1989, Lieutenant general Akbar was posted back at the DESTO, eventually taking over the directorship, where he became involved in classified and sensitive projects of the military. He evaluated the flight performance of the PAC Super Mushshak aircraft that were being designed and built at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. He led DESTO's project in classified black projects to compete with missile gap with India, after the country test firing the short- range missile. His tenure eventually ended when most projects were moved to KRL and SRC, and realized that the postwar military and the civilian governments would not be given any assignment to him and as approaching in importance the one he had held the program in Kahuta. In 1990, he completed his tenure and eventually retired from the military, ending his 40-year long military service.  Post-retirement   Chairman Pakistan Cricket Board  After retiring in 1990 from his military service, Akbar was appointed as chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and it was during his term when Pakistan reached to the Final to face off with the English Cricket Team, and won the Cricket World Cup in 1992. He sought retirement from his public service, and was eventually succeeded by Nasim Hasan Shah in 1992.

Women in Church history have played a variety of roles in the life of Christianity - notably as contemplatives, health care givers, educationalists and missionaries. Until recent times, women were generally excluded from episcopal and clerical positions within the certain Christian churches; however, great numbers of women have been influential in the life of the church, from contemporaries of Jesus to subsequent saints, theologians, doctors of the church, missionaries, abbesses, nuns, mystics, founders of religious institutes, military leaders, monarchs and martyrs. Christianity emerged from within surrounding patriarchal societies that placed men in positions of authority in marriage, society and government, and, whilst the religion restricted membership of the priesthood to males only, in its early centuries it offered women an enhanced social status and quickly found a wide following among women. In most denominations, women have been the majority of church attendees since early in the Christian era and into the present.David Murrow (2005, 2011), Why Men Hate Going to Church. Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson. . Later, as religious sisters and nuns, women came to play an important role in Christianity through convents and abbeys and have continued through history to be active - particularly in the establishment of schools, hospitals, nursing homes and monastic settlements. Women constitute the great majority of members of the consecrated life within the Catholic Church, the largest of the Christian churches. In recent decades, ordination of women has become increasingly common in some Protestant churches. Laywomen have also been highly active in the wider life of churches, supporting the community work of parishes. Within Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, a particular place of veneration has been reserved for Mary, the Mother of Jesus, which has kept a model of maternal virtue central to their vision of Christianity. Marian devotion is however, generally not a feature of Protestantism. Apostolic age New Testament Christ in the House of Martha and Mary, Diego Vel√°zquez, 1618. This Gospel episode suggests that Jesus broke with the conventions of his age and provided religious instruction to women. The New Testament of the Bible refers to a number of women in Jesus' inner circle (notably his mother Mary, for whom the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy hold a special place of honour, and St. Mary Magdalene, who discovered the empty tomb of Christ), although the Catholic Church teaches that Christ appointed only male Apostles (from the Greek apostello \\"to send forth\\").Coppieters, Honor√©. \\"Apostles.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 10 Oct. 2014 Mary Magdalene kneeling within a Stabat Mater scene by Gabriel Wuger, 1868. Among the most famous accounts of Jesus directly dealing with an issue of morality and women is provided by the story of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery, from verses in the Gospel of John. The passage describes a confrontation between Jesus and the scribes and Pharisees over whether a woman, caught in an act of adultery, ought to be stoned. Jesus shames the crowd into dispersing, and averts the execution with the famous words: \\"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her\\". According to the passage, \\"they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last\\", leaving Jesus to turn to the woman and say \\"go, and sin no more\\". Another story contained in the Gospels concerning Jesus' attitude to women is the story of Jesus at the house of Martha and Mary. In this story Mary sits at Jesus' feet as he preaches, while Martha toils in the kitchen preparing a meal. When Martha complains to Mary that she should instead be helping in the kitchen, Jesus says that, on the contrary, \\"Mary has chosen what is better\\" (, New International Version). From the very beginning of the early Christian church, women were important members of the movement, although much of the information in the New Testament on the work of women has been overlooked.MacHaffie, Barbara J. Her story: women in Christian tradition. Fortress Press, 2006. . Since sources of information stemming from the New Testament church was written and interpreted by men, many assumed that it had been a \\"man's church\\". Recently, scholars have begun looking in mosaics, frescoes, and inscriptions of that period for information about women's roles in the early church. The historian Geoffrey Blainey wrote that women were more influential during the period of Jesus' brief ministry than they were in the next thousand years of Christianity. Blainey points to several Gospel accounts of Jesus imparting important teachings to women: his meeting with the Samaritan woman at the well, his anointing by Mary of Bethany, his public admiration for a poor widow who donated some copper coins to the Temple in Jerusalem, his stepping to the aid of the woman accused of adultery, and the presence of Mary Magdalene at his side as he was crucified. Blainey concludes that \\"as the standing of women was not high in Palestine, Jesus' kindnesses towards them were not always approved by those who strictly upheld tradition.\\"Blainey, Geoffrey. A Short History of Christianity, Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 19-20 There were women disciples present at Jesus' crucifixion. Women were reported to be the first witnesses to the resurrection, chief among them again Mary Magdalene. She was not only \\"witness,\\" but also called a \\"messenger\\" of the risen Christ.Maisch, Ingrid. tr. by Linda M. Maloney. Collegeville MN: Liturgical Press, 1998. Assemblies in the homes of believers As time went on, groups of Christians organized within the homes of believers. Those who could offer their home for meetings were considered important within the movement and assumed leadership roles.MacDonald, Margaret. \\"Reading Real Women Through Undisputed Letters of Paul\\" in Women and Christian Origins, ed. by Ross Sheppard Kraemer and Mary Rose D'Angelo (Oxford: University Press, 1999), 204 The New Testament Gospels acknowledge that women were among Jesus' earliest followers. Jewish women disciples, including Mary Magdalene, Saint Joanna, and Susanna, had accompanied Jesus during his ministry and supported him out of their private means. Although the details of these gospel stories may be questioned, in general they reflect the prominent historical roles women played in Jesus' ministry as disciples. Early spread of Christianity Paul Writing His Epistles, (16th-century depiction). There is much debate about St Paul's attitude to women in the church, however his early letter to the Galatians defied prevailing culture and offered a vision of gender equality: \\"there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Jesus Christ\\". Historian Geoffrey Blainey writes that women probably comprised the majority in early Christian congregations. This large female membership likely stemmed in part from the early church's informal and flexible organization offering significant roles to women. Another factor is that there appeared to be no division between clergy and laity. Leadership was shared among male and female members according to their \\"gifts\\" and talents. \\"But even more important than church organization was the way in which the Gospel tradition and the Gospels themselves, along with the writing of Paul, could be interpreted as moving women beyond silence and subordination.\\" Women may also have been driven from Judaism to Christianity through the taboos and rituals related to the menstrual cycle, and a society preference for male over female children.Sawyer, Deborah F. Women and Religion in the First Christian Centuries. Vol. 1. London: Psychology, 1996. Print. Religion in the First Christian Centuries. In his Short History of Christianity, Geoffrey Blainey wrote that the early Christians were \\"sympathetic to women\\": > Whereas neither the Jewish, nor the Roman family would warm the hearts of a > modern feminist, the early Christians were sympathetic to women. Paul > himself insisted in his early writings that men and women were equal. His > letter to the Galatians was emphatic in defying the prevailing culture, and > his words must have been astonishing to women encountering Christian ideas > for the first time: 'there is neither male nor female; for you are all one > in Jesus Christ'. Women shared equally in what is called the Lord's Supper > or Eucharist, a high affirmation of equality. Blainey goes on to note that \\"the debate about Paul's attitude to women will go on and on\\", for in later letters ascribed to Paul, it is written \\"let your women keep silence in the churches\\", although elsewhere Paul lays down rules for women for prayer and prophesying during religious services. The early Christian texts refer to various women activists in the early church. One such woman was St. Priscilla, a Jewish missionary from Rome, who may have helped found the Christian community at Corinth. She traveled as a missionary with her husband and St Paul, and tutored the Jewish intellectual Apollos. Others include the four daughters of Philip the Evangelist, from Caesarea, Palestine, who were said to be prophets and to have hosted St Paul in their home. However, some people, including the author of Acts, did not see women as true missionaries or leaders in their own right even though they did perform good acts in the community.Ferguson, Everett. Encyclopedia of Early Christianity. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. N.p.: Taylor and Francis, 1999. Print. Widows for example were recognized as a group in society but were not admitted into the clerical rank. While women did have roles in early Christianity, as Christianity became formalized with sacraments and hierarchization or church office, women's earlier public roles were restricted and regulated. Debatably Equal Partnership Between Men and Women Men and women in marriage have an equal partnership in the early church. In the bible, there are many quotes that explore this equality. One authentic Christian tradition is \\"Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord\\" while \\"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it\\".\\"The Ecumenical Review.\\" Seminars on Orthodox Spirituality and Role of Women in the Church. Not only are women supposed to love and put forth effort in a marriage, men are too. This equality gives a supportive base to marriage. Another quote from the bible is that ‚Äúwe are all one in Jesus Christ‚Äù.Galatians 3:28 In the time of early Christianity it was a new concept that was being practiced and preached. The oneness of humankind between male and female was a defining feature of this new religion. As stated before, women were given equality by adding the title of deacon (deaconess). This tradition continued until the 15th century, and still persists in some women's monasteries among the eastern churches and in Protestant churches. In Christian orthodoxy, the function of the two sexes is genuine (have equal roles) and seen as a mutual fellowship. Both men and women are to offer love and sacrifice, according to Jesus Christ. An orthodox text states that an Orthodox woman should not feel inferior to men simply because she cannot stand in front of the holy altar, for everything in the church is a result of cooperation. The equality between the sexes in the Christian church gives women more power and does not limit their potential. While some positions were not allowed for women, they still were able to get involved with the church. The equal partnership between men and women is not only seen in the religious aspect of Christianity but also in the social and home life. Patristic age Icon of the 5th-century hermit saint, Mary of Egypt, surrounded by scenes from her life (17th century, Beliy Gorod). During the early centuries of Christianity, there is evidence of a great deal of activity by women in the life of congregations. Women served as deacons and ladies of means like Lydia of Philippi acted as financiers. Women probably constituted the majority of Christians. Blainey notes that by around AD 300, women had become so influential in the affairs of the church that the pagan philosopher Porphyry \\"complained that Christianity had suffered because of them\\". Nevertheless, by the close of the Patristic era, a male hierarchy had established itself over church affairs, with priests and bishops running the congregations. Ministry restricted to men From the early patristic age, the offices of teacher and sacramental minister were reserved for men throughout most of the church in the East and West. Church Fathers on the role of women Origen (AD 185-254) stated that, > Even if it is granted to a woman to show the sign of prophecy, she is > nevertheless not permitted to speak in an assembly. When Miriam the > prophetess spoke, she was leading a choir of women ... For [as Paul > declares] \\"I do not permit a woman to teach,\\" and even less \\"to tell a man > what to do.\\"Origen, Fragmenta ex commentariis in epistulam i ad Corinthios Historian Philip Schaff records early church fathers of the 3rd and 4th centuries as teaching, regarding 1 Cor. 14: 34,35, > Tertullian, the second-century Latin father, wrote that \\"It is not permitted > to a woman to speak in church. Neither may she teach, baptize, offer, nor > claim for herself any function proper to a man, least of all the sacerdotal > office.\\" (\\"On the Veiling of Virgins\\"). Women saints St. Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine Women commemorated as saints from these early centuries include several martyrs who suffered under the Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, such as Agnes of Rome, Saint Cecilia, Agatha of Sicily and Blandina. In late Antiquity, Saint Helena was a Christian and consort of Emperor Constantius, and the mother of Emperor Constantine I. As such her role in history is of great significance as her son Constantine legalised Christianity across the Roman Empire, and became a convert himself - ending centuries of mistreatment of Christians. Similarly, Saint Monica was a pious Christian and mother of Saint Augustine of Hippo, who after a wayward youth, converted to Christianity and became one of the most influential Christian Theologians of all history. Other women contributed to the development of early Christian monasticism, seeking redemption in the wilderness, as with the hermit Saint Mary of Egypt (c.AD 344-421) who is venerated in Western, Eastern, Oriental and African Christianity, for entering a life of penitence and prayer in the deserts beyond the Jordan River, after arriving from Egypt as a prostitute.MacRory, Joseph. \\"St. Mary of Egypt.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 10 Oct. 2014  Middle ages  Our Lady of Vladimir, one of the holiest medieval representations of the Theotokos. As Western Europe transitioned from the Classical to Medieval Age, the male hierarchy with the Pope as its summit became a central player in European politics, however many women leaders also emerged at various levels within the Church. In the East, a similar male hierarchy prevailed around the Patriarch at Constantinople. However, women rose to play an active role in religion after the Fall of Rome: mysticism flourished and monastic convents and communities of women became powerful institutions within Europe. Marian devotion blossomed, setting a model of maternal virtue at the heart of Western civilization. In the West, the Roman Catholic Church was the major unifying cultural influence in Europe during the Middle Ages with its selection from Latin learning, preservation of the art of writing, and a centralized administration through its network of bishops. In the East, that role fell to the Orthodox Church and Byzantine Empire (the churches split in 1054). In the Roman Catholic|Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church, the priesthood and the ministries dependent upon it such as Bishop, Patriarch and Pope, were restricted to men. The first Council of Orange (441) forbade the ordination of women to the diaconate. With the establishment of Christian monasticism, other influential roles became available to women. From the 5th century onward, Christian convents provided an alternative for some women to the path of marriage and child-rearing and allowed them to acquire literacy and learning, and play a more active religious role. While non-aristocratic women were in many respects excluded from political and mercantile life in the Middle Ages, leading churchwomen were an exception. Medieval abbesses and female superiors of monastic houses were powerful figures whose influence could rival that of male bishops and abbots: \\"They treated with kings, bishops, and the greatest lords on terms of perfect equality;. . . they were present at all great religious and national solemnities, at the dedication of churches, and even, like the queens, took part in the deliberation of the national assemblies...\\".Montalembert, \\"The Monks of the West,\\" Bk. XV., cited in Oestereich, Thomas. \\"Abbess.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1.

Virgin Mary and female saints Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris, is one of many important cathedrals named in honour of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Geoffrey Blainey, writes that women were more prominent in the life of the Church during the Middle Ages than at any previous time in its history, with a number of church reforms initiated by women. Blainey cites the ever growing veneration of the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene as evidence of a high standing for female Christians at that time. Irish hagiography records that, as Europe was entering the Medieval Age, the abbess St. Brigit of Kildare was founding monasteries across Ireland. The Celtic Church played an important role in restoring Christianity to Western Europe following the Fall of Rome, due in part to the work of nuns like Brigid.Grattan-Flood, William. \\"St. Brigid of Ireland.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 10 Oct. 2014 Doctor of the Church St. Catherine of Siena was an influential 14th-century theologian who worked to bring the Avignon Papacy back to Rome. The Virgin Mary became increasingly important to Christian worship through the Middle Ages. She was conferred such titles as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven. Mary Magdalene's Feast Day was celebrated in earnest from the 8th century on and composite portraits of her developed from Gospel references to other women Jesus met. The art historian Kenneth Clarke wrote that, if art is taken as a guide, then only from the 12th century did the cult of the Virgin come to appeal to the popular imagination in the West. The great Cathedrals of France were dedicated to her: Notre Dame de Paris, Amiens, Laon, Rouen and Rheims. Chartres Cathedral in particular honoured Mary with the elaborate splendour of its architecture. St Bernard of Clairvaux preached of her as an ideal of beauty and mediator between humanity and God.Clarke, Kenneth. Civilisation, BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969. St. Clare of Assisi was one of the first followers of Saint Francis of Assisi. She founded the Order of Poor Ladies, a contemplative monastic religious order for women in the Franciscan tradition, and wrote their Rule of Life‚Äîthe first monastic rule known to have been written by a woman. Following her death, the order she founded was named in her honor the Order of Saint Clare, commonly referred to today as the Poor Clares.O'Hara, Edwin. \\"Poor Clares.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Considered by her contemporaries to have high levels of spiritual insight, she worked with the sick and poor, experienced \\"visions\\", gathered disciples and participated in the highest levels of public life through letters to the princes of Italy, consultations with papal legates and by acting as a diplomat negotiating between the city states of Italy. She counseled for reform of the clergy and was influential in convincing Pope Gregory XI to leave Avignon and restore the Holy See to Rome.Gardner, Edmund. \\"St. Catherine of Siena.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Teresa of Avila, 1991 page vii St. Joan of Arc Arguably the most famous female Catholic Saint of the period is St. Joan of Arc. Considered a national heroine of France, she began life as a pious peasant girl. As with other saints of the period, Joan is said to have experienced supernatural dialogues which gave her spiritual insight and directed her actions - but unlike typical heroines of the period, she donned male attire and, claiming divine guidance, sought out the King Charles VII of France to offer help in a military campaign against the English. Taking up a sword, she achieved military victories, before being captured. Her English captors and their Burgundian allies then arranged for her to be tried as a \\"witch and heretic\\", after which she was burned at the stake. A papal inquiry later declared the trial illegal. A hero to the French, sympathy grew for Joan even in England and in 1909 she was canonised a saint.Thurston, Herbert. \\"St. Joan of Arc.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 11 Oct. 2014 Monarchs from the Middle Ages to Post-Reformation St Olga of Kiev A network of European monarchies established power throughout Western Europe through the Medieval period. Men were generally given precedence to reign as monarch, however aristocratic women could achieve influence. A number of such women were singled out as model Christians by Pope John Paul II in his Mulieris Dignitatem letter on the dignity and vocation of women: Olga of Kiev, Matilda of Tuscany, Hedwig of Silesia, Jadwiga of Poland and Elizabeth of Hungary.Pope John Paul II, Mulieris Dignitatem, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, August 15, 1988 The first Russian ruler to convert to Christianity was Olga of Kiev around 950AD. She is an important figure in the spread of Christianity to Russia and commemorated by both the Catholic and Orthodox churches. Italian noblewoman Matilda of Tuscany (1046‚Äì1115) is remembered for her military accomplishments and for being the principal Italian supporter of Pope Gregory VII during the Investiture Controversy. Saint Hedwig of Silesia (1174‚Äì1243) supported the poor and the church in Eastern Europe and Jadwiga of Poland reigned as monarch of Poland and, within the Catholic Church, is honoured as the patron saint of queens and of a \\"united Europe\\". Saint Elisabeth of Hungary (1207‚Äì1231) was a symbol of Christian charity who used her wealth to establish hospitals and care for the poor. Saint Jadwiga of Poland is the patron saint of queens n the Catholic Church. As sponsor of Christopher Columbus' 1492 mission to cross the Atlantic, the Spanish Queen Isabella I of Castille (known as Isabella the Catholic), was an important figure in the growth of Catholicism as a global religion. Her marriage to Ferdinand II of Aragon had ensured the unity of the Spanish Kingdom and the royal couple held equal authority. The Catholic Monarchs then conquered the last Moorish bastion in Spain at Granada in January 1492 and seven months later, Columbus sailed for the Americas. The Catholic encyclopedia, credits Isabella as an extremely able ruler and one who \\"fostered learning not only in the universities and among the nobles, but also among women\\". Of Isabella and Ferdinand, it says: \\"The good government of the Catholic sovereigns brought the prosperity of Spain to its apogee, and inaugurated that country's Golden Age\\".Amad√≥, Ram√≥n Ruiz. \\"Isabella I.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 11 Oct. 2014 Queen Elizabeth I The Reformation swept through Europe during the 16th Century. The excommunication of Protestants by leaders of the Roman Catholic Church ended centuries of unity among Western Christendom. The refusal of Pope Clement VI to grant an annulment in the marriage of King Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon saw Henry establish himself as supreme governor of the church in England. Mary I of England, was his eldest daughter. She succeeded the throne and executed her Protestant half-sister Lady Jane Grey who was has been called the Nine Day Queen. Mary was the daughter of Catherine of Aragon, and thus remained loyal to Rome and sought to restore the Roman Church in England. Her re-establishment of Roman Catholicism was reversed after her death in 1558 by her successor and younger half-sister, Elizabeth I. Rivalry emerged between Elizabeth and the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots, finally settled with the execution of Mary in 1587. The religion of an heir or monarch's spouse complicated intermarriage between royal houses through coming centuries. Consorts of the Holy Roman Emperors were given the title of Holy Roman Empress. The throne was reserved for males, though women such as Theophanu and Maria Theresa of Austria, controlled the power and served as de facto Empresses regnant. The powerful Maria Theresa acquired her right to the throne of the Habsburg Monarchy by means of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, allowing for female succession - but had to fight the War of the Austrian Succession to secure her right to reign. Following victories, her husband, Francis Stephen, was chosen as Holy Roman Emperor in 1745, confirming Maria Theresa's status as a European leader. A liberal-minded autocrat, she was a patron of sciences and education and sought to alleviate the suffering of the serfs. On religion she pursued a policy of cujus regio, ejus religio, keeping Catholic observance at court and frowning on Judaism and Protestantism - but the ascent of her son as co-regnant Emperor saw restrictions placed on the power of the Church in the Empire. She reigned for 40 years, and had 16 children including Marie-Antoinette, the ill-fated Queen of France.L√∂ffler, Klemens. \\"Maria Theresa.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 11 Oct. 2014 Reformation and Baroque period Katherine von Bora The Protestant Reformation, closed convents in Reformed areas which effectively closed off the option of a full-time religious role for Protestant women, as well as one which had provided some women a life in academic study.Allen, Charlotte. \\"The Holy Feminine.\\" Journal of Religion, Culture, and Public Life, 1999 However, some convents (such as Ebstorf Abbey near the town of Uelzen and Bursfelde Abbey in Bursfelde) adopted the Lutheran faith. Many of these convents in eastern Europe were closed by communist authorities after the Second World War. They are sometimes called damenstift. One notable damenstift member was Catharina von Schlegel (1697-1768) who wrote the hymn that was translated into English as Be still, my soul, the Lord is on thy side. Besides the L√ºne abbeys, three exclusively female Lutheran orders for women open today are the Communit√§t Casteller Ring, the Daughters of Mary, and the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary. Although Communit√§t Christusbruderschaft Selbitz is mixed, it is almost entirely female. However, other convents voluntarily folded during the Reformation. For example, following Catherine of Mecklenburg's choice to defy her Catholic husband and smuggle Lutheran books to Ursula of Munsterberg and other nuns, Ursula (in 1528) published 69 articles justifying their reasons to leave their convent. Martin Luther himself taught that \\"the wife should stay at home and look after the affairs of the household as one who has been deprived of the ability of administering those affairs that are outside and concern the state‚Ä¶.\\"Luther, Martin. Lectures on Genesis 3:11. Among the many nuns who chose the domestic life over the monastic life was the wife of Martin Luther, Katherine von Bora.

In 1569 Lutheran Magdalena Heymair became the first woman ever to have her writings listed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. She published a series of pedagogical writings for elementary-age teaching and also wrote poetry. Calvinist Anne Locke was a translator and poet who published the first English sonnet sequence. In 1590, Christine of Hesse published the Lutheran psalm-book Geistliche Psalmen und Lieder. John Knox (1510‚Äì1572) also denied women the right to rule in the civic sphere, as he asserted in his famous First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women. Baptist theologian Dr. John Gill (1690‚Äì1771) comments on 1 Corinthians 14:34,35, stating > In Gen_3:16, \\"thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over > thee\\". By this the apostle would signify, that the reason why women are not > to speak in the church, or to preach and teach publicly, or be concerned in > the ministerial function, is, because this is an act of power, and > authority; of rule and government, and so contrary to that subjection which > God in his law requires of women unto men.

In A Very Short History of the World, Geoffrey Blainey wrote that, in removing the institution of the convent, the Reformation at first indirectly reduced the power of women, for convents had been places where women could achieve power and influence, as in Zurich where the Benedictine abbesses had helped administer the town. However, the Protestant belief that all people should be able to read the Bible, wrote Blainey, led to an increase in female literacy, as a result of the opening of new schools, and the introduction of compulsory education for boys and girls in places like Lutheran Prussia beginning in 1717.Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin; 2004. Michelangelo's Piet√† A general tenet of the Protestant reformers was that Marian devotion and the 'cult of Mary\\" and the \\"cult of saints\\" should be rejected. Thus, in the communities of Europe and North America that adopted Protestantism, the centuries-old rituals and theology associated with Mary and formal sainthood that had been built up by the Catholic tradition were largely expunged in the aftermath of the Reformation. Apart from convents being closed, images of Mary were in many cases torn down or decapitated. The Catholic Church meanwhile, responded to the Reformation with the Counter Reformation, which included a series of wars as well as exuberant baroque architecture and art was embraced as an affirmation of the faith and new seminaries and orders were established to lead missions to far off lands The importance of Marian devotion within Catholic life was kept firmly in place. Thus a new divide had arisen in Christianity: on the one hand Catholicism and Orthodoxy maintained Mary's place in Christian art and ritual; while on the other side, the new Protestant churches greatly reduced her significance. Many women were martyred during the Counter-Reformation, including the Guernsey Martyrs, three women martyred for Protestantism in 1556. One woman was pregnant and gave birth while being burned, the child was rescued but then ordered to be burned as well. Still other women, such as those living in the Defereggen Valley, were stripped of their children so they could be raised in Catholic in an institution. Renaissance and Baroque art produced new depictions of women in Christian art. According to Kenneth Clarke, while Mary had been in the Middle Ages \\"the supreme protectress of civilization\\" who had \\"taught a race of tough and ruthless barbarians the virtues of tenderness and compassion\\", during the Renaissance, Mary \\"became also the human mother in whom everyone could recognise qualities of warmth and love and approachability\\". These human qualities were presented by Catholic artists like Raphael, in his Madonna and Child portraits representing Mary with the infant Jesus, and Michelangelo in his pieta statue, depicting Mary cradling the dead body of Jesus following his crucifixion. During the Baroque period, religious depictions of women in Catholic Europe became not only exuberant, but often highly sensual, as with the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa by Gian Lorenzo Bernini.  Modern times  Catholic Sisters and the leper children of Hawaii in 1886. Catholic women played a central role in the developing or running of many the modern world's education and health care systems. Amidst the backdrop of Industrial Revolution and expanding European Empires, a number of notable educational and nursing religious institutes were established by or for Catholic women during the 17th-19th centuries; Christian women played a central role in the developing or running of many the modern world's education and health care systems. Out of other Christian traditions arose women like Florence Nightingale, who assisted with the development of modern nursing.\\"Florence Nightingale\\" By the 21st century, several Protestant churches were ordaining women, but Christianity's heartlands were shifting away from Europe, and while vocations to the religious life were in decline in the West, conversions to Christianity and religious vocations were expanding rapidly in Africa and Asia. Anglican and nurse, Florence Nightingale is widely credited with aiding the development of modern nursing.

Catherine Helen Spence Many Christian women were instrumental in the movement for women's suffrage which achieved its first successes in Britain's Australasian colonies at the close of the 19th century and spread across the democratic world.

In Australia, Unitarian preacher Catherine Helen Spence led calls for women's suffrage, and ran for political office after the South Australian Parliament became the first modern jurisdiction to allow women to do so.Eade, Susan. \\"Spence, Catherine Helen (1825‚Äì1910)\\", Australian Dictionary of biography In North America, organizations like the Woman's Christian Temperance Union agitated for the same reforms.National Council of Women of Canada For much of the early twentieth century, Catholic women continued to join religious institutes in large numbers, where their influence and control was particularly strong in the running of primary education for children, high schooling for girls, and in nursing, hospitals, orphanages and aged care facilities. The Second Vatican Council of the 1960s liberalised the strictures of Catholic religious life, particularly for women religious; however, in the latter half of the 20th century, vocations for women in the West entered a steep decline. A number of beatifications and canonisations took place of Catholic women from all over the world: St. Josephine Bakhita was a Sudanese slave girl who became a Canossian nun; St. Katharine Drexel (1858‚Äì1955) worked for Native and African Americans; Polish mystic St. Maria Faustina Kowalska (1905‚Äì1938) wrote her influential spiritual diary;Morneau, Robert. \\"Saints of the 20th Century\\", American Catholic and German nun Edith Stein who died at Auschwitz.\\"Teresa Benedict of the Cross Edith Stein (1891-1942)\\", Vatican News Service President Ronald Reagan of the United States presents Mother Teresa with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony, 1985 A number of Christian women are recalled as martyrs of the Second World War struggle against Nazism.

In modern times, after the Second Vatican Council, four Catholic women have been declared Doctors of the Church, indicating a re- appraisal of the role of women within the life of that Church: the 16th- century Spanish mystic St. Teresa of √Åvila, the 14th Century Italian mystic St. Catherine of Siena, the 19th-century French nun St. Th√©r√®se de Lisieux (called Doctor Amoris or Doctor of Love), and the 12th-century German nun St. Hildegard of Bingen. While Catholicism and Orthodoxy adhered to traditional gender restrictions on ordination to the priesthood, ordination of women in Protestant churches has in recent decades become increasingly common. As of 1996, over half of all American Protestant denominations ordain women,Hess, Beth B.; Markson, Elizabeth Warren, and Peter J. Stein, Peter J., Sociology, Allyn and Bacon, 1996 though some restrict the official positions a woman can hold. For instance, some ordain women for the military or hospital chaplaincy but prohibit them from serving in congregational roles. However, one-third of all seminary students (and in some seminaries nearly half) are female.Kling, David William.

Women in the Middle Ages occupied a number of different social roles. During the Middle Ages, a period of European history lasting from around the 5th century to the 15th century, society was patriarchal and this type of patriarchal control was assumed: ideally, women were to fall under male control regardless of class. Women held the positions of wife, mother, peasant, artisan, and nun, as well as some important leadership roles, such as abbess or queen regnant. The very concept of \\"woman\\" changed in a number of ways during the Middle Ages and several forces influenced women's roles during their period. Early Middle Ages (476‚Äì1000) Spinning by hand was a traditional form of women's work (illustration c. 1170). The Roman Catholic Church was a major unifying cultural influence of the Middle Ages with its selection from Latin learning, preservation of the art of writing, and a centralized administration through its network of bishops. Historically in the Catholic and other ancient churches, the role of bishop, like the priesthood, was restricted to men. The first Council of Orange (441) also forbade the ordination of deaconesses, a ruling that was repeated by the Council of Epaone (517) and the Second Council of Orl√©ans (533). With the establishment of Christian monasticism, other roles within the Church became available to women. From the 5th century onward, Christian convents provided an alternative to the path of marriage and child-rearing, to play a more active religious role. Abbesses could become important figures in their own right, often ruling over monasteries of both men and women, and holding significant lands and power. Figures such as Hilda of Whitby (c. 614‚Äì680), became influential on a national and even international scale. Spinning was one of a number of traditional women's crafts at this time, initially performed using the spindle and distaff; the spinning wheel was introduced towards the end of the High Middle Ages. For most of the Middle Ages, until the introduction of beer made with hops, brewing was done largely by women; this was a form of work which could take place at home. In addition, married women were generally expected to assist their husbands in business. Such partnerships were facilitated by the fact that much work occurred in or near the home. However, there are recorded examples from the High Middle Ages of women engaged in a business other than that of their husband. Midwifery was practised informally, gradually becoming a specialized occupation in the Late Middle Ages. Women often died in childbirth, although if they survived the child-bearing years, they could live as long as men, even into their 70s. Life expectancy for women rose during the High Middle Ages, due to improved nutrition. Eleanor of Aquitaine was a wealthy and powerful woman. High Middle Ages (1000‚Äì1300) Hildegard of Bingen conducted a number of preaching tours around Germany. Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122‚Äì1204) was one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in Western Europe during the High Middle Ages. She was the patroness of such literary figures as Wace, Beno√Æt de Sainte-Maure, and Chr√©tien de Troyes. Eleanor succeeded her father as suo jure Duchess of Aquitaine and Countess of Poitiers at the age of 15, and thus became the most eligible bride in Europe. Herrad of Landsberg, Hildegard of Bingen, and H√©lo√Øse d'Argenteuil were influential abbesses and authors during this period. Hadewijch of Antwerp was a poet and mystic. Both Hildegard of Bingen and Trota of Salerno were medical writers in the 12th century. Constance, Queen of Sicily, Urraca of Le√≥n and Castile, Joan I of Navarre, Melisende, Queen of Jerusalem and other queens regnant exercised political power. Female artisans in some cities were, like their male equivalents, organized in guilds. Regarding the role of women in the Church, Pope Innocent III wrote in 1210: \\"No matter whether the most blessed Virgin Mary stands higher, and is also more illustrious, than all the apostles together, it was still not to her, but to them, that the Lord entrusted the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven\\".Innocent III, Epistle, 11 December 1210 Late Middle Ages (1300‚Äì1500) Christine de Pizan became a professional writer after the death of her husband in 1390. In the Late Middle Ages women such as Saint Catherine of Siena and Saint Teresa of √Åvila played significant roles in the development of theological ideas and discussion within the church, and were later declared Doctors of the Roman Catholic Church. The mystic Julian of Norwich was also significant in England. Isabella I of Castile ruled a combined kingdom with her husband Ferdinand II of Aragon, and Joan of Arc successfully led the French army on several occasions during the Hundred Years' War. Christine de Pizan was a noted late medieval writer on women's issues. Her Book of the City of Ladies attacked misogyny, while her The Treasure of the City of Ladies articulated an ideal of feminine virtue for women from walks of life ranging from princess to peasant's wife. Her advice to the princess includes a recommendation to use diplomatic skills to prevent war: > \\"If any neighbouring or foreign prince wishes for any reason to make war > against her husband, or if her husband wishes to make war on someone else, > the good lady will consider this thing carefully, bearing in mind the great > evils and infinite cruelties, destruction, massacres and detriment to the > country that result from war; the outcome is often terrible. She will ponder > long and hard whether she can do something (always preserving the honour of > her husband) to prevent this war.\\" From the last century of the Middle Ages onwards, restrictions began to be placed on women's work, and guilds became increasingly male-only; some of the reasons may have been the rising status and political role of guilds and the increasing competition from cottage industries, which prompted the guilds to tighten their entrance requirements. Female property rights also began to be curtailed during this period. Marriage Medieval marriage was both a private and social matter. According to canon law, the law of the Catholic Church, marriage was a concrete exclusive bond between husband and wife; giving the husband all power and control in the relationship. Husband and wife were partners and were supposed to reflect Adam and Eve. Marriage in elite families was also used as an abuse of power and violence. Even though wives had to submit to their husbands' authority, wives still had rights in their marriages. McDougall concurs with Charles Reid's argument that both men and women shared rights in regards to sex and marriage; which includes: \\"the right to consent to marriage, the right to ask for marital debt or conjugal (sexual) duty, the right to leave a marriage when they either suspected it was invalid or had grounds to sue for separation, and finally the right to choose one's own place of burial, death being the point at which a spouse's ownership of the other spouse's body ceased\\". Regionally and across the time span of the Middle Ages, marriage could be formed differently. Marriage could be proclaimed in secret by the mutually consenting couple, or arranged between families as long as the man and woman were not forced and consented freely; but by the 12th century in western canon law, consent (whether in mutual secrecy or in a public sphere) between the couple was imperative. Marriages confirmed in secrecy were seen as problematic in the legal sphere due to spouses redacting and denying that the marriage was solidified and consummated. Peasants, slaves, and maidservants needed the permission and consent of their master in order to marry; and if they did not they were punished (see below in Law). Marriage also allowed for the couples' social networks to expand. This was according to who investigated the marriage of Henry Kroyl Jr. and Agnes Penifader, and how their social spheres changed after their marriage. Due to the couples' fathers, Henry Kroyl Sr. and Robert Penifader being prominent villagers in Brigstock, Northamptonshire, approximately 2,000 references to the activities of the couple and their immediate families were being recorded. Bennett details how Kroyl Jr.'s social network expanded greatly as he gained connections through his occupational endeavors. Agnes' connections expanded also based on Kroyl Jr.'s new connections. However, Bennett also signifies that a familial alliance between the couples' families of origin did not form. Kroyl Jr. had limited contact with his father after his marriage, and his social network expanded from the business he conducted with his brothers and other villagers. Agnes, though all contact with her family did not cease, her social network expanded to her husband's family of origin and his new connections. Widowhood and remarriage Upon the death of a spouse, widows could gain power in inheriting their husbands' property as opposed to adult sons. Male-preference primogeniture stipulated that the male heir was to inherit their deceased father's land; and in cases of no sons, the eldest daughter would inherit property. However, widows could inherit property when they had minor sons, or if provisions were made for them to inherit. Peter Franklin (1986) investigated the women tenants of Thornbury during the Black Death due to the higher than average proportion of women tenants. Through court rolls, he found that many widows in this area independently held land successfully. He argued that some widows may have remarried due to keeping up with their tenure and financial difficulties of holding their inherited land, or community pressures for the said widow to remarry if she had a male servant living in her home. Remarriage would put the widow back under the thumb and control of her new husband. However, some widows never remarried and held the land until their deaths, thereby ensuring their independence. Even young widows, who would have had an easier time remarrying, remained independent and unmarried. Franklin considers the lives of widows to have been \\"liberating\\" because women had more autonomous control over their lives and property; they were able to \\"argue their own cases in court, hire labour, and cultivate and manage holdings successfully\\". Franklin also discusses that some Thornbury widows had second and even third marriages. Remarriage would have affected inheritance of property, especially if the widow had children with her second husband; however there are several cases where sons from the widow's first marriage were able to inherit before the second husband. McDougall also notes like the varying forms of marriage, the canon law regarding remarriage varied across regions. Both men and women could have been permitted to freely remarry or may have been restricted and/or deemed to serve penance before remarrying.  Medieval elite women  In the Middle Ages the upper socioeconomic groups generally included royalty and nobility. Conduct books from the period present an image of the role of elite women being to obey their spouse, guard their virtue, produce offspring, and to oversee the operation of the household. For those women who did adhere to these traditional roles, the responsibilities could be considerable, with households sometimes including dozens of people. Further, when their husbands were away the role of women could increase substantially. By the High and Late Middle Ages there were numerous royal and noble women who assumed control of their husbands' domains in their absence, including defense and even bearing arms. Noble women were natural parts of the cultural and political environments of their time due to their positions and kinship. Particularly when acting as regents, elite women would assume the full feudal, economic, political and judicial powers of their husbands or young heirs. These women were never prohibited during the Middle Ages from receiving fiefdoms or owning real property during their husbands' lives. Noble women were often patrons of literature, art, monasteries and convents, and religious men. It was not uncommon for them to be knowledgeable in Latin literature.  Medieval peasant women  As with peasant men, the life of peasant women was difficult. Women at this level of society are usually considered to have had considerable gender equality,Pat Knapp and Monika von Zell, Women and Work in the Middle Ages. (though some scholars have argued that they had fundamentally the same subordinate status as women elsewhere in medieval societyBennett, Judith M. 1987. Women in the Medieval English Countryside: Gender and Household in Brigstock Before the Plague. P. 5-6. 'The findings described in the following chapters suggest that a bon vieux temps will not be found in the medieval countryside ... The evidence that follows indicates that rural women faced limitations fundamentally similar to those restricting women of the more privileged sectors of medieval society. Norms of female and male behaviour in the medieval countryside drew heavily upon the private subordination of wives to their husbands.') but this often meant shared poverty. Until nutrition improved, their life expectancy at birth was significantly less than that of male peasants: perhaps 25 years. As a result, in some places there were four men for every three women. Marxist historian Chris Middleton made these general observations about English peasant women: \\"A peasant woman's life was, in fact, hemmed in by prohibition and restraint.\\" If single, women had to submit to the male head of her household; if married, to her husband, under whose identity she was subsumed. English peasant women generally could not hold lands for long, rarely learnt any craft occupation and rarely advanced past the position of assistants, and could not become officials. Peasant women had numerous restrictions placed on their behaviour by their lords. If a woman was pregnant, and not married, or had sex outside of marriage, the lord was entitled to compensation. The control of peasant women was a function of financial benefits to the lords. They were not motivated by women's moral state. Also during this period, sexual activity was not regulated, with couples simply living together outside a formal ceremony, provided they had permission by their lord. Even without a feudal lord involved with her life, a woman still had supervision by their father, brothers or other male members of the family. Women had little control over their own lives. Middleton provided some exceptions: English peasant women, on their own behalf, could plead in manorial courts; some female freeholders enjoyed immunities from male peers and landlords; and some trades (such as ale-brewing), provided female workers with independence. Still, Middleton viewed these as exceptions which required historians only to modify, rather than revise, \\"the essential model of female subservience.\\" Overview of the medieval European economy In medieval Western Europe, society and economy were rural-based. Ninety percent of the European population lived in the countryside or in small towns. Agriculture played an important role in sustaining this rural-based economy. Due to the lack of mechanical devices, activities were performed mostly by human labour. Both men and women participated in the medieval workforce and most workers were not paid by wages for their labor, but instead independently worked on their land and produced their own goods for consumption. Whittle cautioned against the \\"modern assumption that active economic involvement and hard work translate into status and wealth\\" because during Middle Ages, hard work only ensured survival against starvation. In fact, although peasant women worked as hard as peasant men, they suffered many disadvantages such as fewer landholdings, occupational exclusions, and lower wages. Landownership To prosper, medieval Europeans needed rights to own land, dwellings, and goods. Land-ownership involved various inheritance patterns, according to the potential heir's gender across the landscape of medieval Western Europe. Primogeniture prevailed in England, Normandy, and the Basque region: In the Basque region, the eldest child -regardless of sex- inherited all lands. In Normandy, only sons could inherit lands. In England, the eldest son usually inherited all properties, but sometimes sons inherited jointly, daughters would inherit only if there were no sons. In Scandinavia, sons received twice as much as daughters' inheritance, yet siblings of the same sex received equal shares. In northern France, Brittany, and the Holy Roman Empire, sons and daughters enjoyed partible inheritance: each child would receive an equal share regardless of sex (but Parisian parents could favour some children over others). Female land-owners, single or married, could grant or sell land as they deemed fit. Women managed the estates when their husbands left for war, political affairs, and pilgrimages. Nevertheless, as time passed, women were increasingly given, as dowries, movable properties such as good and cash instead of land. Even though up the year 1000 female landownership had been increasing, afterwards female landownership began to decline. Commercialization also contributed to the decline in female landownership as more women left the countryside to work for wages as servants or day labourers. Medieval widows independently managed and cultivated their deceased husbands' lands. Overall, widows were preferred over children to inherit lands: indeed, English widows would receive one third of the couples' shared properties, but in Normandy widows could not inherit. Labor Generally, research has determined that there is limited gender division of labor among peasant men and women. Rural historian Jane Whittle described this gender division of labor thus: \\"Labor was divided according to the workers' gender. Some activities were restricted to either men or women; other activities were preferred to be performed by one gender over the other:\\" e.g. men ploughed, mowed, and threshed and women gleaned, cleared weeds, bound sheaves, made hay, and collected wood; and yet others were performed by both, such as harvesting. A woman's standing as a worker might vary depending on circumstances. Generally, women were required to have male guardians who would assume legal liability for them in legal and economic matters: For the wives of elite merchants in Northern Europe, their roles extended to commercial undertakings both with their husbands and on their own, however in Italy tradition and law excluded them from commerce; in Ghent, women had to have guardians unless these women had been emancipated or were prestigious merchants; Norman women were forbidden to contract business ventures; French women could litigate business matters, but could not plead in courts without their husbands, unless they had suffered from their husbands' abuses; Castilian wives, during the Reconquista, enjoyed favourable legal treatments, worked in family-oriented trades and crafts, sold goods, kept inns and shops, became domestic servants for wealthier households; Christian Castilian wives labored along with Jewish and Muslim free-born women and slaves. Yet over time Castilian wives' work became associated with or even subordinated to that of their husbands, and when the Castilian frontier region had been stabilized, Castilian wives' legal standing deteriorated. Both peasant men and women worked in the home and out in the fields. In looking at coroner records, which represent the lives of peasants more clearly, Barbara Hanawalt found that 30% of women died in their homes compared to 12% of men; 9% of women died on a private property (i.e. a neighbour's house, a garden area, manor house, etc.) compared to 6% of men; 22% of women died in public areas within their village (i.e. greens, streets, churches, markets, highways, etc.) compared to 18% of men. Men dominated accidental deaths within fields at 38% compared to 18% of women, and men had 4% more accidental deaths in water than women did. Accidental deaths of women (61%) occurred within their homes and villages; while men had only 36%. This information correlated with the activities and labours regarding the maintenance and responsibilities of working in a household. These include: food preparation, laundry, sewing, brewing, getting water, starting fires, tending to children, collecting produce, and working with domestic animals. Outside of the household and village, 4% of women died in agricultural accidents compared to 19% of men, and no women died from labors of construction or carpentry. The division of gendered labour may be due to women's being at risk of danger, like being attacked, raped and losing their virginity, in doing work in the fields or outside of the home and village. Three main activities performed by peasant men and women were planting foods, keeping livestock, and making textiles, as depicted in Psalters from southern Germany and England. Women of different classes performed different activities: rich urban women could be merchants like their husbands or even became money lenders; middle-class women worked in the textile, inn-keeping, shop-keeping, and brewing industries; while poorer women often peddled and huckstered foods and other merchandise in the market places, or worked in richer households as domestic servants, day laborers, or laundresses. Modern historians assumed that only women were assigned childcare and thus had to work near their home, yet childcare responsibilities could be fulfilled far from the home and -except breastfeeding- were not exclusive to women. In spite of the patriarchal medieval European culture, which posited female inferiority, opposed female independence, so that female workers could not contract out their labour services without their husband's' approval, widows have been recorded to act as independent economic agents; meanwhile, a married woman -mostly from among the female artisans- could, under some limited circumstances, exercise some agency as a femme sole, identified legally and economically as separate from her husband: she could learn artisan skills from her parents as their apprentice, she could work alone, conduct business, contract her labours, or even plead in law-courts. There was evidence that women performed not only housekeeping responsibilities like cooking and cleaning, but even other household activities like grinding, brewing, butchering, and spinning; and produced items like flour, ale, meat, cheese, and textile for direct consumption and for sale. An anonymous 15th-century English ballad appreciated activities performed by English peasant women such as housekeeping, making foodstuffs and textiles, and childcare. Even though cloth-making, brewing, and dairy production were trades associated with female workers, male cloth-makers and brewers increasingly displaced female workers, especially after water-mills, horizontal looms, and hop-flavoured beers were invented. These inventions favoured commercial cloth-making and brewing dominated by male workers who had more time, wealth, and access to credit and political influence and who produced goods for sale instead of for direct consumption. Meanwhile, women were increasingly relegated to low-paying tasks like spinning. Besides working independently on their own lands, women could hire themselves out as servants or wage-workers. Medieval servants performed works as required by the employer's household: men cooked and cleaned while women did the laundry. Like their independent rural workers, rural wage- labourers performed complementary tasks based on a gendered division of labour. Women were paid only half as much as men even though both sexes performed similar tasks. After the Black Death killed a large part of the European population and led to severe labour shortages, women filled out the occupational gaps in the cloth-making and agricultural sectors. Simon Penn argued that the labour shortages after the Black Death furnished economic opportunities for women, but Sarah Bardsley and Judith Bennett countered that women were paid about 50-75% of men's wages. Bennett attributed this gender- based wage-gap to patriarchal prejudices which devalued women's work, yet John Hatcher disputed Bennet's claim: he pointed out that men and women received the same wages for the same piece-work, but women received lower day-wages because they were physically weaker and might have had to sacrifice working hours for other domestic duties. Whittle stated that the debate has not yet been settled. To illustrate, the late medieval poem Piers Plowman paints a pitiful picture of the life of the medieval peasant woman: > \\"Burdened with children and landlords' rent; What they can put aside from > what they make spinning they spend on housing, Also on milk and meal to make > porridge with To sate their children who cry out for food And they > themselves also suffer much hunger, And woe in wintertime, and waking up > nights To rise on the bedside to rock the cradle, Also to card and comb > wool, to patch and to wash, To rub flax and reel yarn and to peel rushes > That it is pity to describe or show in rhyme The woe of these women who live > in huts;\\"William Langland, tr. George Economou, William Langland's Piers > Plowman: the C version : a verse translation, University of Pennsylvania > Press, 1996, , p. 82. Peasant women and health Peasant women during the time period were subjected to a number of superstitious practices when it came to their health. In The Distaff Gospels, a collection of 15th-century French women's lore, advice for women's health was plentiful. \\"For a fever, write the first 3 words of the Our Father on a sage leaf, eat it in the morning for 3 days and you will be cured.\\" Male involvement with women's healthcare was widespread. However, there were limits to male participation because of the resistance to males' viewing women's genitalia. During most encounters with male medical practitioners, women remained clothed because viewing a women's body was considered shameful. Childbirth was treated as the most important aspect of women's health during the period; however, few historical texts document the experience. Women attendants assisted in childbirth and passed their experiences to one another. Midwives, women who attended childbirth, were acknowledged as legitimate medical specialists and were granted a special role in women's health care. There is Roman documentation in Latin works evidencing the professional role of midwives and their involvement with gynaecological care. Women were healers and engaged in medical practices. In 12th-century Salerno, Italy, Trota, a woman, wrote one of the Trotula texts on diseases of women. Her text, Treatments for Women, addressed events in childbirth that called for medical attention. The book was a compilation of three original texts and quickly became the basis for the treatment of women. Based on medical information developed in Greek and Roman eras, these texts discussed ailments, disease, and possible treatments for women's health issues. The Abbess Hildegard of Bingen, classed among medieval singlewomen, wrote, in her 12th-century treatise Physica and Causae et Curae, about many issues concerning women's health. Hildegard was one of the most well known of medieval medical authors. In particular, Hildegard contributed much valuable knowledge in the use of herbs as well as observations regarding women's physiology and spirituality. In nine sections, Hildegard's volume reviews the medical uses for plants, the earth's elements (earth, water, and air), and animals. Also included are investigations of metals and jewels. Hildegard also explored such issues as laughter, tears, and sneezing, on the one hand, and poisons and aphrodisiacs, on the other. Her work was compiled in a religious environment but also relied on past wisdom and new findings about women's health. Hildegard's work not only addresses illness and cures but also explores the theory of medicine and the nature of women's bodies. Diet Just as Classical Greco-Roman writers, including Aristotle, Pliny the Elder, and Galen, assumed that men lived longer than women, medieval Catholic bishop Albertus Magnus agreed that in general men lived longer, but he observed that some women live longer and posited that it was per accidens, thanks to the purification resulting from menstruation and that women worked less but also consumed less than men. Modern historians Bullough and Campbell instead attribute high female mortality during the Middle Ages to deficiency in iron and protein as a result of the diet during the Roman period and the early Middle Ages. Medieval peasants subsisted upon grain-heavy, protein-poor and iron-poor diets, eating breads of wheat, barley, and rye dipped in broth, and rarely enjoying nutritious supplements like cheese, eggs, and wine. Physiologically speaking, women require at least twice as much iron as men because women inevitably lose iron through menstrual discharge as well as to events related to child bearing, including fetal needs; bleeding during childbirth, miscarriage, and abortion; and lactation. As the human body better absorbs iron from liver, iron salts, and meat than from grains and vegetables, the grain-heavy medieval diet commonly resulted in iron deficiency and, by extension, general anemia for medieval women. However, anemia was not the leading cause of death for women; rather anemia, which lessens the amount of hemoglobin in blood, would further aggravate such other diseases as pneumonia, bronchitis, emphysema, and heart diseases. Since the 800s, the invention of a more efficient type of plough‚Äîalong with three-field replacing two-field crop rotation‚Äîallowed medieval peasants to improve their diets through planting, alongside wheat and rye in the fall, oats, barley, and legumes in the spring, including various protein-rich peas. In the same period, rabbits were introduced from the Iberian Peninsula across the Alps to the Carolingian Empire, reaching England in the 12th century. Herring could be more effectively salted, and pork, cheese, and eggs were increasingly consumed throughout Europe, even by the lower classes. As a result, Europeans of all classes consumed more proteins from meats than did people in any other part of the world during the same period‚Äîleading to population growth that almost outstripped resources at the onset of the devastating Black Death. Bullough and Campbell further cite David Herlihy, who observes, based on available data, that in European cities in the 15th century, women outnumbered men, and although they did not have the \\"absolute numerical advantage over men,\\" women were more numerous among the elderly. Law Cultural differences across Western and Eastern Europe meant that laws were neither universal nor universally practised. The Laws of the Salian Franks, a Germanic tribe that migrated into Gaul and converted to Christianity between the 6th and 7th centuries, provide a well-known example of a particular tribe's law codes. According to Salic Law, crimes and determined punishments were usually orated; however as their contact with literate Romans increased, their laws became codified and developed into written language and text. Peasants, slaves, and maidservants were considered as property of their free-born master(s). In some or perhaps most cases, the unfree person might be regarded as of the same value as their master's animals. However, peasants, slaves, and maidservants of the king were regarded as more valuable and even considered to be of the same value as free persons because they were members of the king's court. ;Crimes concerning abduction If someone were to abduct another person's slave or maidservant and were proven to have committed the crime, that individual would be responsible to pay 35 solidi, the value of the slave, and in addition a fine for lost time of use. If someone abducted another person's maidservant, the abductor would be fined 30 solidi. A proven seducer of a maidservant worth 15 or 25 solidi, and who is himself worth 25 solidi, would be fined 72 solidi plus the value of the maidservant. The proven abductor of a boy or girl domestic servant will be fined the value of the servant (25 or 35 solidi) plus an additional amount for lost time of use. ;Crimes concerning free-born persons marrying slaves A free-born woman who marries a slave will lose her freedom and privileges as a free-born woman. She will also have her property taken away from her and will be proclaimed an outlaw. A free-born man who marries a slave or maidservant shall also lose his freedom and privilege as a free-born man. ;Crimes concerning fornication with slaves or maidservants If a freeman fornicates with another person's maidservant and is proven to have done so, he will be required to pay the maidservant's master 15 solidi. If anyone fornicates with a maidservant of the king and proven to do so, the fine would be 30 solidi. If a slave fornicates with another person's maidservant and that maidservant dies, the slave will be fined and also be required to pay the maidservant's master 6 solidi and may be castrated; or that slave's master will be required to pay the maidservant's master the value of the deceased maidservant. If a slave fornicates with a maidservant who does not die, the slave will either receive three hundred lashes or be required to pay the maidservant's master 3 solidi. If a slave marries another person's maidservant without her master's consent, the slave will either be whipped or required to pay the maidservant's master 3 solidi. Peasant women by status The first group of peasant women consisted of free landholders. Early records such as the Exon Domesday and Little Domesday attested that, among English land- owners, 10-14% noble thegns and non-noble free-tenants were women; and Wendy Davies found records which showed that in 54% of property transactions, women could act independently or jointly with their husbands and sons. Still, only after the 13th century are there records which better showed free female peasants' rights to land. In addition, English manorial court-rolls recorded many activities carried out by free peasants such as selling and inheriting lands, paying rents, settling upon debts and credits, brewing and selling ale, and - if unfree - rendering labor services to lords. Free peasant women, unlike their male counterparts, could not become officers such as manorial jurors, constables, and reeves. The second category of medieval European workers were serfs. Conditions of serfdom applied to both genders. Serfs did not enjoy property rights as did free tenants: serfs were restricted from leaving their lords' lands at will and were forbidden to dispose of their assigned holdings. Both male and female serfs had to labor as part of their services to their lords and their required activities might be even specifically gendered by the lords. A serf woman would pass her serfdom status to her children; in contrast, children would inherit gentry status from their father. A serf could gain freedom when released by the lord, or after having escaped from the lord's control for one year plus one day, often into towns; escaping serfs were rarely arrested. When female serfs got married, they had to pay fines to their lords. The first fine upon a female serf getting married was known as merchet, to be paid by her father to their lord; the rationale was that the lord had lost a worker and her children. The second fine is the leyrwite, to be paid by a male or female serf who had committed sexual acts forbidden by the Church, for fear that the fornicating serf might have her marriage value lessened and thus the lord might not get the merchet. Chris Middleton cited other historians who demonstrated that lords often regulated their serfs' marriages to make sure that the serfs' landholdings would not be taken out of their jurisdiction. Lords could even force female serfs into involuntary marriages to ensure that the female serfs would be able to pro- create a new generation of workers. Over time, English lords increasingly favoured primogeniture inheritance patterns to prevent their serfs' landholdings from being broken up.

Difference between Western and Eastern Europe  The status of women differed immensely by region. In most of Western Europe, later marriage and higher rates of definitive celibacy (the so-called \\"European marriage pattern\\") helped to constrain patriarchy at its most extreme level. The rise of Christianity and manorialism had both created incentives to keep families nuclear and thus the age of marriage increased; the Western Church instituted marriage laws and practices that undermined large kinship groups. From as early as the 4th century, the Church discouraged any practice that enlarged the family, like adoption, polygamy, taking concubines, divorce, and remarriage. The Church severely discouraged and prohibited consanguineous marriages, a marriage pattern that has constituted a means to maintain clans (and thus their power) throughout history. The church also forbade marriages in which the bride did not clearly agree to the union. After the Fall of Rome, manorialism also helped to weaken the ties of kinship and thus the power of clans; as early as the 9th century in Austrasia, families that worked on manors were small, consisting of parents and children and occasionally a grandparent. The Church and state had become allies in erasing the solidarity and thus the political power of the clans; the Church sought to replace traditional religion, whose vehicle was the kin group, and substituting the authority of the elders of the kin group with that of a religious elder; at the same time, the king's rule was undermined by revolts on the part of the most powerful kin groups, clans or sections, whose conspiracies and murders threatened the power of the state and also the demand of manorial lords for obedient, compliant workers. As the peasants and serfs lived and worked on farms that they rented from the lord of the manor, they also needed the permission of the lord to marry; couples therefore had to comply with the lord and wait until a small farm became available before they could marry and thus produce children. Those who could and did delay marriage presumably were rewarded by the landlord and those who did not were presumably denied said reward.2014\\\\. Medieval Manorialism and the Hajnal Line For example, Medieval England saw the marriage age as variable depending on economic circumstances, with couples delaying marriage until the early twenties when times were bad and frequently marrying in the late teens after the Black Death, when there were labor shortages and it was economically lucrative to workers; by appearances, marriage of adolescents was not the norm in England. In Eastern Europe however, there were many differences with specific regional characteristics. In the Byzantine Empire, Bulgarian Empire and Kievan Rus', the majority of women were well educated and had a higher social status than in Western Europe. Equality in family relations and the right to common property after marriage were recognized by law with the Ekloga, issued in Constantinople in 726 and Slavonic Ekloga in Bulgaria in the 9th century.Dimitrov, D. 2011. Byzantine Empire and Byzantine world, Prosveta - Sofia, p. 83 In some parts of Russia the tradition of early and universal marriage (usually of a bride age 12‚Äì15, with menarche occurring on average at 14) as well as traditional Slavic patrilocal customs led to a greatly inferior status for women at all levels of society. In rural South Slavic areas, a custom of women marrying men younger than themselves, in some cases only after the age of thirty, remained until the 19th century. The manorial system had yet to penetrate into Eastern Europe where there was a lesser effect on clan systems and no firm enforcement of bans on cross-cousin marriages. Orthodox laws banned marriages between relatives closer than third and fourth cousins.

It was committed on 10 August 1993 by Croatian Defence Forces (HVO) soldiers during the Bosnian War. In November 1999, Zagreb District Court found Ivan Bakoviƒá guilty in absentia and sentenced him to 15 year imprisonment. After Ivan Bakoviƒá was arrested, he was also tried in the Cantonal Court in Livno and found guilty of war crimes committed against the civilian population. In 2004, he was sentenced to 15 year imprisonment. Massacre The explanation of the verdict of the Zagreb District Court, with Ranko Marijan as a presiding judge, stated that Ivan Bakoviƒá, also known as Ikaƒç, appeared together with at least one unidentified person on 10 August 1993 in the village of Mokronoge, at the doorstep of the Be≈°laga family's house. Armed with an automatic and a machine- gun and wearing fatigues, they entered the house and aimed their weapons at Husein, Emir, Subha, Emira and Dika Be≈°laga, Ibrahim, Muharem and Mustafa Tiro, as well as at Sinha ƒêuliman. He ordered them to get out of the house. Together with his accessory, holding the victims at gun-point, he took them to a nearby forest, some 500 meters away and ordered them to lie on the ground, face down. Then, the two assailants fired at least 33 shots from the automatic gun and 51 shots from the machine-gun. All nine victims were killed on the spot. During the presentation of evidence before the Court, the most relevant was the shocking testimony of minor Amela Be≈°laga, who recognized the murderer on the night he came to their house. Bakoviƒá had been her father's best man at his wedding. When Bakoviƒá ordered them to lie down, her mother implored him: \\"Don't do that brother Ivan. Your dad was a good man\\". Bakoviƒá replied: \\"He might have been good, but I am an Usta≈°a\\", and took them out of the house.

In addition to these countries, it has been recorded as a non-breeding visitor in Paraguay, and possibly Brazil and Uruguay (it is unclear if it is a regular non-breeding visitor or only an accidental visitor to the last two countries). Visually it closely resembles the white-crested tyrannulet, but its voice is distinctive and its tail shorter. Considerable taxonomic confusion has surrounded this species, which for a period mistakenly was referred to by the scientific name Serpophaga griseiceps, a junior synonym of Serpophaga munda.

From analysis of the account by Peter Martyr, court chronicler, the ethnographer John R. Swanton believed that Chicora was from a Catawban group. In Hispaniola, where he and the other captives were taken, Chicora learned Spanish, was baptized a Catholic, and worked for Lucas Vasquez de Ayll√≥n, a colonial official. Most of the natives died within two years. Accompanying Ayll√≥n to Spain, de Chicora met with the chronicler Peter Martyr and told him much about his people. Martyr combined this information with accounts by explorers and recorded it as the \\"Testimony of Francisco de Chicora,\\" published with his seventh Decade in 1525. In 1526 Chicora accompanied Ayll√≥n on a major expedition to North America with 600 colonists. After they struck land at the Santee River and the party went ashore, Chicora escaped and returned to his people. Spanish encounter with natives at the Pee Dee River The Spanish had made repeated expeditions to the southeastern part of what is now the United States, where they explored areas around the Santee River in present-day South Carolina and Winyah Bay and other areas. Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n, oidor (judge) of the royal Audencia of Santa Domingo, commissioned Francisco Gordillo to make an expedition to the continent in 1520. Gordillo sailed north from Hispaniola through the Bahamas, where near the island of Lucayoneque he fell in with a caravel commanded by the slave raider Pedro de Quexos (Pedro de Quejo), who was trying to capture Arawak to sell as slaves, without success. Quexos happened to be a relative of Gordillo's pilot Alonzo Fernandez Sotil, and decided to join Gordilla's expedition, and in June 1521 the two struck land at what they called the River of San Juan Bautista (St. John the Baptist), probably the Pee Dee in present- day South Carolina. A crowd of curious natives gathered on the shore to watch the strangers. The natives fled when the Spanish approached in shallops, but two were caught, taken aboard a ship, given Spanish clothes, and returned ashore. The natives again swarmed the beach, seeing their comrades' return and changed appearance as a wondrous sign, since they had worn only buckskins before. The chief ordered 50 of his subjects to bring food for the Spanish. Once ashore, the Spanish were given presents and a guided tour for several days. They claimed the land for their king, and invited the natives aboard to see their ships. Gordillo had been ordered by de Ayll√≥n to cultivate friendly relations with the people to prepare for later colonization. De Quexos, eager for slaves, persuaded him to trick the natives; the Spaniards suddenly raised anchor and set sail for Santo Domingo with 70 of the natives still aboard, including the man who would be named Francisco. When they arrived, Ayll√≥n condemned the leaders for their treachery. He took the matter before a commission headed by Diego Columbus. The commission declared the captive natives to be free, and ordered them returned to the mainland, but such a trip never took place, as it was considered too costly. As recounted by Peter Martyr the court chronicler, according to colonial reports, most of the natives died within two years; many wandered the streets of Santo Domingo as vagrants, and few survived. One who survived was baptized Francisco de Chicora; he learned Spanish and worked for Ayll√≥n. Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n took the engaging young Indian to Spain and presented him to the royal court, where he told fantastical tales about his homeland of Chicora, and the neighboring provinces of what is now the Carolinas. \\"Chicora\\" (the name the Spanish gave to the area) was evidently one of several Siouan-speaking territories subject to the chief Datha of Duahe (also recorded in Spanish as Duhare). Francisco de Chicora described the people of Duhare as \\"white\\" and having \\"blond hair to the heels\\", and told of a gigantic Indian king called Datha who ruled a race of giants and of another race of men who grew long tails. Chicora met the court chronicler, Italian historian Peter Martyr, and recounted to him much about the customs of his people in Chicora and about the neighboring provinces. After returning to the Caribbean, in 1526 Ayll√≥n led an expedition to North America with three ships and 600 colonists, bringing de Chicora with him. After striking land at what Ayll√≥n named the Jordan River (now the Santee River in South Carolina), one of his ships went aground. As the party went ashore, de Chicora immediately abandoned the Spanish and fled to rejoin his own people. He disappeared from the historical record. Scholarly identification of Native provinces Researchers have worked to identify the provinces and tribes described by Chicora. They have analyzed phonetics of 16th-century Spanish, as well as the many languages of the North American tribes in the area, to reach their conclusions. * Francisco's home province, considered by Swanton to be on the lower Pee Dee River, was called Chicora. Scholars generally consider the people a Catawban group. Swanton (1940) proposed a connection with the Sugaree or Shakori; Rudes (2004) suggested Coree. * Duahre (or Duhare, many variant spellings) was a neighboring province described as home to Datha, the principal chief of several provinces. Ayllon is said to have marched through this province in 1526, en route to Guadalupe, where he built the short-lived colony of San Miguel de Guadalupe. The location and ethnicity of the actual people referred to in Chicora's tall tales of Duhare has been debated; candidates have included Catawban, Guale, and Cusabo. In 2004 Blair Rudes asserted that other linguistic evidence in Martyr's account points to the Iroquoian Tuscarora tribe, and specifically their town on the Neuse River called Teyurh√®ht√®. He suggests, for example, that Old Tuscaroran Teeth-ha (king) corresponded with the name \\"Datha\\", which he says may have been a title rather than proper name. He also notes close similarities between accounts of a religious ceremony as recounted by Francisco de Chicora, and one among the Tuscarora recounted by a European in the early eighteenth century. * Xapita - a province near Duahre where pearls were found, was identified with the name of the Sampit River. *Hitha (Yta) - a province ruled by Datha, possibly Etiwaw (Eutaw), a Cusabo subtribe. *Tihe - a province under Datha and inhabited by a priestly tribe. *Xamunambe - another of Datha's provinces. *Arambe, Guacaya, Quohathe, Tanzaca (Tanaca), Pahoc - These were other regions which the Spanish recorded visiting, where they noted the indigenous peoples had dark brown skin. Swanton suggests that Guacaya may correlate to Waccamaw (a Siouan tribe), and Pahoc to \\"Back Hooks\\". Rudes connects Quohathe with Coweta (a Muscogee (Creek) subtribe); Tanzaca with \\"Transequa\\", a village shown on a 1733 map on the Upper Catawba River; and Arambe with the Ilapi of Hernando de Soto (1541), also the Mississippian-culture village called Herape by Juan Pardo (1568), and the later Creek town Hilibi, which had moved farther west. *Inziguanin - described as a nation whose inhabitants had a myth that crocodile-like men had once lived in their land. Rudes suggested Inziguanin could be a reference to the Shawnee, though they were not attested in the southeast until long afterward. Other sources, such as Oviedo, Navarrete, Barcia, and Documentos Ineditos list additional provinces derived from Francisco de Chicora, some of which have been tentatively identified by Swanton and other researchers: *Yamiscaron - the Yamacraw or Yamasee tribe (Guale) *Orixa - a Cusabo subtribe on the Edisto River *Co√ßayo - the \\"Coosa\\" subtribe of the Cusabo, who lived on the upper South Carolina rivers. These \\"Coosa\\" were probably not related to the Muskogean-speaking Coosa chiefdom that De Soto encountered some 15 years later in present-day northern Georgia. *Pasqui - called the Pasque by Pardo, they lived inland near the Siouan Waxhaw tribe. *Aymi - possibly the Hymahi of De Soto and Pardo, placed by Hudson (1990) on the Congaree River, near where it joins the Santee. *Sona - possibly a Cusabo subtribe on the Stono River *Yenyohol - the Winyaw of Winyah Bay *Anica, Xoxi, Huaque, Anoxa - uncertain References * John R.

If p(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and x is chosen to be both a power of two and larger in magnitude than any of the coefficients of p, then the coefficients of each term of can be read directly out of the binary representation of p(x). One application of this method is to reduce the computational problem of multiplying polynomials to the (potentially simpler) problem of multiplying integers. If p(x) and q(x) are polynomials with known coefficients, then one can use these coefficients to determine a value of x that is a large enough power of two for that the coefficients of the product pq(x) to be read off from the binary representation of the number p(x)q(x). Since p(x) and q(x) are themselves straightforward to determine from the coefficients of p and q, this result shows that polynomial multiplication may be performed in the time for a single binary multiplication..

The worst flooding occurred across the Atlanta metropolitan area. Continuous rain, spawned by moisture pulled from the Gulf of Mexico, fell faster than the local watersheds could drain the runoff. Initial damages from around the state were estimated at $250 million. On September 26, Georgia Insurance Commissioner John Oxendine raised the estimated cost to $500 million with the potential for it to rise. Some 20,000 homes, businesses and other buildings received major damage and 17 Georgia counties received Federal Disaster Declarations. The flood is blamed for at least ten deaths. The floods were historic, breaking records that went back more than a century in some locations. The Chattahoochee River, the largest river in the region, measured water levels at a 500-year flood level. Beginnings Rain began falling on the Atlanta area on September 15, 2009, with the National Weather Service reporting only 0.04 inches that day at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Additional rain fell throughout the week, with only a trace amount recorded for September 18. However, a large rain event began to inundate the area on September 19. The official NWS monitoring station at the Atlanta airport recorded of rainfall from daybreak to 8pm (more than doubling the previous record for rainfall on that date), while outlying monitoring stations recorded of rainfall in a 13-hour period. Flooding began in one neighborhood that day, with the remainder of the area placed under a flash flood watch for the rest of the weekend. Effects NOAA rainfall map for one-week period ending September 23, 2009 Hundreds of people were rescued by boat from their homes, and at least ten people died, mostly in their cars by driving where water crossed the road, which motorists were repeatedly warned against on local radio and TV. The American Red Cross started emergency shelters in each county affected by the floods. Most Atlanta area school districts were closed September 21, due to floodwaters and the difficulty for school buses to get around the hundreds of closed roads. Chattahoochee River The Chattahoochee rose to the highest levels since Buford Dam was built. Water levels along the river rose over the 0.2 percent chance exceedence (500-year) flood at the gage location. The River reached its second-highest level ever in Vinings at Paces Ferry Road, and would have surpassed its 1916 record were it not for the impoundment built in the 1950s. Along the river in both Vinings and Roswell, a one percent chance exceedence (100-year flood) level was measured. Peachtree Creek topped its stream gauge and the bridge itself at Northside Drive, but remained just below its 1916 record. Nancy Creek, however, did reach a record level, destroying the Peachtree-Dunwoody Road bridge. Peachtree-Dunwoody Road bridge reopened March 23, 2010. Both Peachtree Creek and Nancy Creek are tributaries of the Chattahoochee River. The western side of the Interstate 285 beltway crosses the Chattahoochee River. This section of the interstate was completely underwater for several days. Many of the roller coasters and rides at Six Flags Over Georgia were partly underwater, with at least 80% of Great American Scream Machine submerged by the Chattahoochee River. Located along the Chattahoochee River in west Atlanta, the R.M. Clayton sewage treatment plant, the largest in the Southeastern U.S., was swamped with four feet of water as the river rose by twelve additional feet. Millions of gallons of untreated sewage were released into the rising waters. Other plants in Cobb and Gwinnett counties experienced similar spills. Also located near the Chattahoochee, a Kellogg Company food plant was flooded, resulting in the closure of the plant and a subsequent national shortage of frozen waffles.[Kellogg's: Atlanta floods led to waffle shortage http://www.ajc.com/business/kellogg-s-atlanta- floods-202056.html] Lake Lanier and Lake Allatoona Lake Lanier rose quickly, while Lake Allatoona soared to more than ten feet or three meters over full pool, using its flood reserve capacity for the first time after years of the 2006‚Äì2009 Southeastern U.S. drought. Lake Allatoona reached its highest level since 1990. Sweetwater Creek On Monday, September 21, Sweetwater Creek rose to its highest level ever. On September 22, The United States Geological Survey measured the greatest flow ever recorded on Sweetwater Creek, at . The flooding from the creek was met with water from the swollen Chattahoochee River, which blocked Interstate 20 west of Atlanta for two days. Many homes and businesses in the area were completely submerged. Cherokee County Interstate 575 was heavily blocked by Noonday Creek, which also blocked several other roads including Georgia State Route 92. The Little River also caused major problems in the same area, blocking the original parallel route of Georgia 5 (which was replaced by I-575 in the 1980s), and Arnold Mill Road, north and east of Woodstock. Commuters trying to get back home to Cherokee county found it took hours due to the numerous road closures and unmarked detours, extending the September 21, 2009 rush hour until after 9:00pm as people sat in gridlocked traffic. Cobb County Kennesaw State University in Cobb County received significant flooding on several parts of campus including the east parking deck. Several buildings and dormitories along Campus Loop Drive were flooded from a nearby creek and lake. Water rushing into the Social Science building reportedly rose up to the bottom of the hand-rail of the first floor stairs. Classes were cancelled at 1:00pm on Monday, September 21 for the remainder of the day and again on September 22 and 23 while damage was assessed and clean-up began. Pope High School was surrounded by water, which receded in time to let the students leave. Clarkdale Elementary School was flooded to the roof. Students were evacuated early September 21, while waters were ankle-deep. The Cobb County School District, wary of rising waters, let middle school students leave before elementary and high schools. Though because of heavy rainfall in Legacy Park subdivision, 3 buses had to return to Awtrey Middle School. Powder Springs Park and parts of Brownsville Road were completely submerged by floodwaters. City of Atlanta Inside the city limits of Atlanta, several neighborhoods were underwater, including Peachtree Hills. The Downtown Connector, a section where Interstate 75 and Interstate 85 run concurrent with each other and one of Georgia's busiest expressways, was submerged by the floodwaters. Several cars were swept into the water before police could redirect traffic. Appalachian Mountains landslides As a result of the flooding rains, many parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains became saturated. This caused a number of landslides and rockslides, including one in October, 2009 on Interstate 40 in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. This closed the highway for several months.http://www.wral.com/traffic/story/6278952/ Another rockslide occurred on U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee, in November, 2009. This section, known as the Ocoee Scenic Byway, was closed for several months.http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2009/nov/11/rock-slide- shuts-down-us-64-through-polk-county/242221/ The rockslide was captured in a dramatic video, which aired on many television news outlets.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39LCzBS8yOM A rockslide also occurred in February, 2010 on U.S. Route 129. This closed the section known as \\"The Dragon\\", along the Tennessee/North Carolina border, until summer. Government response Storms on September 21 were responsible for flooding over the South Eastern United States The governor of Georgia, Sonny Perdue, declared a state of emergency, and requested a disaster declaration from the U.S. government for 17 counties in Georgia. The counties were Bartow, Carroll, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, and Rockdale counties around Metro Atlanta, Catoosa, Chattooga, and Walker counties in far northwest Georgia and Stephens County in northeast Georgia. While state military assets, including elements of the Georgia National Guard and the Georgia State Defense Force, were placed on a heightened state of alert immediately following Governor Perdue's declaration, there were no reports that any military personnel were fielded in significant numbers. Beginning on September 24, President Barack Obama approved a Federal disaster declaration for all 17 Georgia counties requested by Governor Perdue. In the wake of these floods, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency has made strides to increase flood preparedness in Georgia through its Ready Georgia campaign.

The eight-part series is about cross-cultural, interracial and interfaith love. His globetrotting takes him to Palestine, the Philippines, Togo, Japan, Thailand, UK, Israel, Netherlands, the United States.http://www.tvtonight.com.au/tag/john-safrans- race-relations  Episodes  Episode 1 Episode 1 saw Safran travelling to Israel where his Palestinian boom mic operator made a donation to a sperm bank, then to the West Bank where a donation to a clinic was made by John, in an attempt to make half Jewish half Palestinian children - a \\"Jalestinian\\" Noting that he has dated three Eurasian women, Safran conducts an experiment by stealing and smelling the underwear of five Jewish and five Eurasian women (including Nicole Scherzinger of the Pussycat Dolls and actress Dichen Lachman) to see which he \\"prefers\\". Episode 2 Inspired by the 1961 book Black Like Me, Safran travels the streets of Chicago after undergoing makeup that makes him appear black. He interviews some militants, preaches at a predominantly black church and confronts people for using the word \\"nigger\\". Episode 3 After former Muslim terrorist Walid Shoebat tells Safran that his hatred of Jews was quashed after watching Fiddler on the Roof 300 times, Safran heads to the Palestinian territories, where he attempts to \\"de- brainwash\\" representatives of Fatah and Hamas by performing \\"If I Were a Rich Man\\" for them. Satisfied with their positive response, Safran performs the song on a Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation talk show. Safran attempts to rid himself of Jewish guilt about inter-racial relationships by flying a shiksa (non-Jewish woman) to Amsterdam, where he asks her to make out with him in Anne Frank's attic. He then travels to America, where Wayne Griffiths of NORM (the National Organization for Restoring Men) helps him to reverse his circumcision. Episode 4 Safran travels to Togo for a voodoo death, and later confronts his ex-girlfriend he remains obsessed with. Episode 5 Safran dons an Elephant Man disguise to try to discover whether he is attractive to Asian women, confronts his father about being a self-hating Jew, and takes matters into his own hands in a showdown with Holocaust-denier David Irving. Episode 6 With the help of his two best friends, Safran digs a hole next to his mother's grave and performs a Kabbalah ritual in order to ask her if she wishes for him to marry a Jewish girl. Unsatisfied with the response, he travels to Japan to take advantage of a service that allows patrons to hire people to be their relatives. He pours out his feelings to his \\"mother\\" who tells him that she believes real love and a connection are more important than race or religion. Episode 7 Safran explores Christian domestic discipline, the philosophy of Star Trek as a religion replacement, and goes on a date as a Thai lady boy to help get over his Eurasian ex- girlfriend. Episode 8 Safran attempts to prove ethnic identity is simply a social construct by undergoing a fake wedding ceremony to a Muslim (and relation of Osama Bin Laden) woman pretending to be Jewish and make a break from past and enter the world of post-race by subjecting himself to devotional crucifixion in the Philippines.

The episode is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \\"Chinga\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 12.8 and was viewed by 21.33 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully takes a vacation to Maine, where she encounters a bizarre case where the victims appear to have inflicted wounds upon themselves‚Äîapparently at the behest of a strange young girl. \\"Chinga\\" was co- written by noted horror author Stephen King after he asked to pen an episode of The X-Files. Carter rewrote portions of King's final draft, resulting in a shared writing credit for the entry. The supermarket shots were filmed in an actual supermarket, a first for the series, according to art director Greg Loewen. Chinga, the titular evil doll, was created by sewing together various doll parts, including an oversized head and a wig created from multiple hairpieces. Plot In Ammas Beach, Maine, Melissa Turner and her young daughter Polly go to the store; Polly carries with her an old doll that she calls \\"Chinga\\". Customers watch Polly and her mother, and Polly doesn't like it. Suddenly, Melissa sees a phantasmal vision of the store's butcher, Dave, with a knife stuck in his right eye. Melissa, terrified, decides to leave, but suddenly everyone in the store begins to claw at their eyes. Meanwhile, Dave, after seeing a monstrous reflection of Chinga, is compelled by an outside force to stab himself in the face. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is coincidentally in the area on vacation, and, after stumbling upon the carnage in the store, telephones Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Mulder, true to character, speculates that it might have been caused by dark magic or witchcraft. Scully dismisses Mulder's hypothesis and instead decides to watch the store's closed-circuit television recordings to gain a better understanding of what happened. She notices that, of all the customers in the store, only Melissa and Polly are not compelled to injure themselves. The police chief of Ammas Beach, Jack Bonsaint, offhandedly mentions that Melissa is rumored to practice witchcraft. Bonsaint tells Scully Melissa had formerly been married to a local fisherman, but he was killed when a hook on his winch ripped through his skull. Later, it is revealed that he found Chinga in a lobster trap and gave it to Polly as a present before he died. Bonsaint also reveals that a daycare teacher named Jane Froelich had once slapped Polly over her behavior. Meanwhile, Melissa and Polly meet with her friend, Buddy Riggs, a police deputy, at an ice cream shop. Melissa confides in Riggs that she has been having horrific visions of people dying. Riggs is startled and suggests that Melissa and Polly use his cabin to get away from Amma Beach. While Riggs and Melissa chat, Polly asks one of the workers for more cherries on her ice cream, but the worker insists that she needs to pay for them. Just then, the worker's hair gets caught in the mixer, but Riggs saves her from death. Scully and Bonsaint visit Froelich, who accuses Melissa of being the scion of a witch family. She also claims that Melissa has passed her evil onto Polly. Meanwhile, while heading out to Riggs' cabin, Melissa sees a bloody image of Froelich and decides to return to Amma Beach to save Froelich. While Melissa races back, Froelich is confronted by the enlarged Chinga and is forced to kill herself with a shard of a phonograph record. Soon thereafter, Melissa sees a vision of Riggs, and as expected, the deputy is forced to bludgeon himself to death with his own night stick. At her home, Melissa has a final vision, this time seeing herself with a bloodied hammer embedded in her skull. She decides to end the madness once and for all by burning Chinga. However, the doll somehow manages to extinguish the matches that Melissa lights. Scully and Bonsaint drive to Melissa's house and witness Melissa manically trying to burn her house down‚Äîwith her, her daughter, and Chinga all trapped inside. Chinga eventually overpowers Melissa, forcing her to grab hold of a hammer and beat herself. Scully and Bonsaint burst into the house, and Scully quickly tosses the Chinga doll into a microwave, where it bursts into flames and melts. The power over Melissa is lifted and she stops beating herself. In the final scene, a fisherman is seen pulling up a lobster trap, inside of which is the burned doll.Meisler, pp. 126‚Äì138 Production \\"Chinga\\" was co-written by noted author Stephen King. The episode was co-written by horror author Stephen King. King initially approached series co-star David Duchovny and informed him that he was a fan of the show and wanted to work on an episode.Meisler, pp. 138‚Äì139 After contacting series creator Chris Carter, he was hired as a guest writer (after first being offered the chance to write an episode of Millennium). During the writing process, King worked remotely at his home in Maine, sending drafts of the script for Carter to rewrite. Carter heavily edited the story, because, as he explained, \\"Stephen wasn't used to writing for Mulder and Scully [...] the Mulder-and-Scully story in his original draft didn't quite work\\". Carter helped finalize the draft, with one of his biggest changes being the separation of Mulder and Scully. Kim Manners, the director for the episode, later said, \\"I was very excited to be able to direct a Stephen King piece, and when it was all said and done, there was very little Stephen King left in it. The nuts and bolts were his, but that was really one of Chris' scripts.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 121 During filming, Gillian Anderson struggled with delivering her lines. She explained, \\"The way the script was originally read to me, initially seemed to me as if Scully kind of stepped up to the plate and played along with the sheriff's humor\\". Thus, she performed her lines in a \\"tongue in cheek\\" manner before Carter called her and told her that her lines were not meant to be humorous; he also informed her that the production staff was having to \\"edit out a lot of stuff\\" to correct the issue. Several of the episode's scenes were shot on location. For instance, the gas station scene was filmed at a real gas station across from the series' production headquarters. Likewise, the supermarket scenes were filmed in a real store named \\"Shop Easy\\" located in Port Coquitlam. The scenes required the supermarket to close before the Christmas holiday and be installed with up-right freezers.Gradnitzer and Pittson, p. 167 Reportedly, during the self-mutilation scene in the supermarket, a real customer stumbled onto the set, saw the commotion, and hurriedly left in a panic. The \\"Death Under Glass\\" scene featuring Dave the Butcher with a knife in his eyes was created in post-production with the help of a computer. Special effects supervisor Laurie Kellsen-George tested the scene on her nine- and eleven- year-old sons, explaining, \\"I gauge a lot of the show by whether my kids can stand them or not. If they can't, I figure I succeeded [...] 'Chinga' bothered them a lot.\\" Chinga, the titular evil doll, was created by sewing together various doll parts. An oversized doll's head was then attached to the body and fitted with \\"the world's largest wig\\". Unbeknownst to either Carter or King, the word \\"Chinga\\" is a colloquial Spanish swearword. Most of the makeup effects were created by artist Toby Lindala, who \\"appreciated the chance to [work on] a Stephen King project\\". Reception \\"Chinga\\" premiered on the Fox network in the United States on February 8, 1998. It earned a Nielsen rating of 12.8, with an 18 share, meaning that roughly 12.7 percent of all television-equipped households, and 18 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 21.33 million viewers.Meisler, p. 284 The episode later debuted in the United Kingdom on Sky One on April 19, 1998.Cornell, Day, and Topping, p. 411 However, because the title \\"Chinga\\" is a Mexican Spanish swear word \\"equivalent to 'fuck' and in very common usage\\", the episode was retitled \\"Bunghoney\\" when it aired in the UK.Cornell, Day, and Topping, p. 413 \\"Chinga\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Anna Redman of HELLO! Canada was positive toward the episode, and referred to it as \\"one of the series' best episodes\\". Erin McCann of The Guardian listed \\"Chinga\\" as one of the \\"13 best X-Files episodes ever\\". Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave a mixed review, awarded it a C‚Äì, and called it an episode that \\"seems like one of those ideas that sounds really, really great until someone thinks about for more than a minute.\\" Handlen argued that King was a wrong fit for The X-Files and that the resultant script was King \\"being asked to marry his voice to Carter's\\". He derided the plot and wrote that it was written \\"like someone (Darin Morgan, only not funny at all) doing a parody for the most familiar King tropes.\\" Handlen, however, did praise the violence in the episode, noting that he is \\"a sucker for gore\\", but ultimately called the episode \\"lousy\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \\"clumsy\\". The two argued that the premise of \\"Chinga\\" would have been better suited to a book or short story, as is King's forte. However, its translation to television resulted in an episode \\"so on the nose, it makes you wince.\\" Despite this, Shearman and Pearson complimented Carter's rewrites as well as the various jokes thrown throughout the episode.Shearman and Pearson, p. 133 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She called the entry \\"a major disappointment\\" and wrote that it \\"isn't scary in the least\\". Vitaris even argued that \\"it's unintentionally funny\\" and that the scenes with Mulder that are supposed to play as humor do not. Vitaris wrote that the episode was like the third season entry \\"Pusher\\", except with less focus; ultimately, the episode degenerates into \\"watching people get killed in various gruesome ways while Scully and Vonsant finally collect enough information [‚Ä¶] in the nick of time.\\" Despite the lackluster reception the episode garnered, several critics considered the entry scary. Katie Anderson from Cinefantastique named the scene wherein Dave the Butcher kills himself as the eighth \\"Scariest Moment\\" in The X-Files. Television Without Pity named the episode the ninth \\"Most Nightmare-Inducing\\" episode of the series, noting that \\"[t]his Stephen King- penned episode is your classic demonic doll story.\\"  See also  *Killer toys  Footnotes  Bibliography   *  External links  *\\"Chinga\\" at TheXFiles.com  Category:1998 American television episodes Category:Dolls in fiction Category:Television episodes set in Maine Category:Television episodes written by Stephen King Category:Television episodes about self-harm Category:The X-Files (season 5) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

It was situated about 26 km to the north-east of La Charit√©-sur-Loire on a tributary of the River Ni√®vre.  History  The abbey was founded in 1119 by Hugues of Thil, lord of Champlemy, and his wife Alix of Montenoison as the first daughter house of Pontigny Abbey. It became the burial place of several of the lords of Montenoison. It established one daughter house of its own, Chalivoy Abbey. At the end of the Middle Ages the monastery was held in commendam. During the French Wars of Religion the abbey was burnt down in 1568 by the troops of Wolfgang of Pfalz- Zweibr√ºcken. The abbey, by that time housing only three monks, was suppressed during the French Revolution in 1791.  Buildings  The house of the commendatory abbot survives, and has been converted into a large country house, and the former monastic estate is still farmed. Near the house three arcades of the cloister have been set up. Bases and capitals of the pillars from the church nave have also been discovered. The choir screen of the abbey church is now in the parish church of Varzy.

The park, known also by its initials MRVNA, is located east of downtown Newark amidst residential neighborhoods and other park land. Establishment of MRVNA was begun in 1975; eventually the park reached its current of forests, fields, creeks, and ponds. The most important of the creeks is Middle Run, which is a tributary of White Clay Creek, and flows mainly north to south through the park. The John C. Vansant House is located in the Middle Run Valley Natural Area. and A field along the Lenape Trail There is no admission fee for MRVNA. The main entrance is a gravel road that turns north off Possum Hollow Rd. (Past this entrance, a little further down along Possum Hollow Rd., can be found the headquarters of Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research.) A long connector trail extends north from the Lenape Trail to Papermill Park (a public park with ball fields, a jogging track and playground, located at the intersection of Paper Mill Road and Polly Drummond Hill Road). The primary roads that surround the park are Possum Park Road along the southwest, Smithmill Road on the north, Polly Drummond Hill Road on the east, and Paper Mill Road on the west. Fox Den Road cuts across the northern portion of the park. MRVNA borders and connects with two portions of White Clay Creek State Park: the Possum Hill area on the northwest and the Judge Morris Estate on the southeast. In addition, William Redd Park (of the city of Newark) can be accessed from the east side of Possum Park Road thus making possible a nearly continuous nature-park hiking route from the Judge Morris Estate on the east to the Newark Reservoir on the west. Most recently it has become possible to proceed from the northeastern corner of the park, at Smithmill Road, to the northwest along Middle Run via a recently established trail northwestward amidst residential areas, ending at Curtis Mill, from which one may reach the northeasternmost sector of White Clay Creek State Park by crossing Paper Mill Road. MRVNA accommodates automobiles in its parking lot off of Possum Hollow Road. The park area proper is meant for recreation on foot or on bicycle, with hunting allowed on occasion. There are 10 trails in the park with a total distance of . As with White Clay Creek State Park, trail markers help to guide visitors; and several footbridges and boardwalks ease crossing of creeks and other wet spots, with stone or concrete steps in a few places. While the trails consist primarily of packed dirt, certain spots along the trails include also structures made of logs for mountain-bikers to test their skill. The most important trails in MRVNA are Lenape Trail on the north, Double Horseshoe Trail on the southwest, Possum Hollow Trail on the south, and Snow Goose Trail on the southeast. This last trail is shared with White Clay Creek State Park, thus allowing connection across Polly Drummond Hill Road with Judge Morris Estate. In addition, there are several shorter trails and connectors (with and without names); a few spurs off of surrounding roads lead to MRVNA trails.

Summary It was held on November 1, 2009, at Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega, Alabama, and is the only race in the Championship Chase to utilize restrictor plates. This marks the first time the race was run in an early November spot, the slot formerly occupied by the Atlanta Motor Speedway event. Jamie McMurray won the race, his first since Daytona in 2007. The last 15 laps of the race were a duel between McMurray and David Stremme, who had never had a top-five in Sprint Cup competition. Stremme ended up 22nd after running out of fuel. Nationwide Series regular Robert Richardson Jr. made his first Cup start and finished 18th. Qualifying Because qualifying was rained out, the rules awarded points leader Jimmie Johnson the pole position. Single-file racing NASCAR told the drivers in the drivers meeting that they could not bump draft in the corners. That was followed by a controversial race where drivers drove in a single file line all the way around the track for a few segments. Many fans believed and still believe that that was a protest by the drivers to the new rule. Jimmie Johnson and Jamie McMurray all defended their actions. Johnson responded by saying, \\"No, there's not truth to that. When we hit single-file like that, we just know there's no need to race at that point. All that matters is from that last pit stop on.\\" Instead of deciding to wreck and dwindle down the field on Sunday, Johnson said the drivers finally got smart about how to approach the race. Everyone seemed to realize that you can't win if you aren't around at the end. McMurray, the eventual race winner, said, \\"It wasn't like everybody was in their cars and we were like, 'Let's get single-file and prove a point' or 'Let's just follow each other.' You had to be in the outside groove because that's where all the momentum was.\\" This continued with Casey Mears leading the line for many laps until the first round of green flag pit stops started. Race ends under caution With five laps to go, Ryan Newman's car flipped on the back straightaway, landing on Kevin Harvick, and also collecting Marcos Ambrose and Elliott Sadler. The race was briefly red-flagged as debris was cleaned up and paramedics cut Newman from his car. Newman was uninjured. After a green-white-checkered restart, a big wreck happened with two laps to go, causing Kurt Busch, Scott Speed, Mark Martin, Jeff Gordon and Robby Gordon to crash; Martin's car blew over, but landed back on its wheels. The race ended under the caution flag and McMurray was scored as winner.

Planned as the primary air defence missile system of the first generation of French guided missile ships, it was used only aboard the two s and as a retrofit to the cruiser . History In 1948 France embarked on a number of programs to develop guided missile systems, the aim being to keep pace with the other Great Powers. The proliferation of high-speed threats, be they underwater, surface or aerial threats, required the development of effective defences. High-priority programs were initiated to cover all areas: anti-aircraft, anti-surface and anti-submarine. Of these programs two achieved operational status; these were: *MALAFON (MArine LAt√©co√®re FONd i.e. Lat√©co√®re Naval underwater) for the anti- submarine role *MASURCA (MArine SURface Contre-Avions i.e. Naval surface anti- aircraft) for the area and high-priority air defense role France had already been working on an anti-aircraft missile the Maruca, derived from the wartime German Henschel Hs 117 Schmetterling. Although the MARUCA program was ultimately abandoned because of impracticability, experience from its development would not go to waste. In 1955 ECAN de Ruelle began work on a supersonic missile using solid-propellants. The MASURCA was a DTCN (Direction Technique des Constructions Navales i.e. Naval Construction Department) program working through ECAN de Ruelle and Matra. The first tests were made on the √éle du Levant, the focus moving in 1960 to the Ile d'Ol√©ron in a building especially built for experimentation. 50 test firings would be made in the period up to 1968, concluding with operational validation aboard the then newly commissioned frigate . After the initial version, known as the Mark 1, came the Mark 2 which benefited from knowledge and technology transfer from the United States. France was in the process of modernising its fleet escorts and it received data from the RIM-2 Terrier program offered by the United States as equipment for Dupetit-Thouars, and experience from the deployment of the RIM-24 Tartar aboard Kersaint, Bouvet, and Du Chayla. France subsequently developed the Mk2 mod2 (Mark 2 modification 2) which deployed from 1966. This was later improved to MK2 mod 3 standard in 1970, and was updated again between 1983 and 1985. MASURCA had been intended as the principal air defence weapon of France's first generation of guided-missile ships (known as FLE or fr√©gates lance-engins in the French parlance of the time). Initially MASURCA was to have armed the six units of the Suffren class, however with the termination of the class at two ships, the only ships to ship with the system were Suffren, her sister ship and, in her incarnation as a guided missile cruiser, the cruiser . Over time the number of missiles has declined with the winding down of the program and the retirement of is launch platforms. Duquesne was placed into reserve in 2009 replaced by the air-defence frigate . System characteristics The missile The complete missile weighed over two tonnes composed of two stages joined by pyrotechnic fasteners (designed to separate the two stages when the propellant in the first had been exhausted). The missile had a range of and possessed a large, for an anti-aircraft weapon, high explosive (HE) blast fragmentation warhead. This was perhaps to overcome shortcomings in accuracy as, coupled with a proximity fuse, any aircraft the missile failed to hit could still be caught in its blast. The booster was designed to expend all its fuel in about 5 seconds, accelerating the missile to a velocity of 800 meters per second (2880 km / h about mach 2.7) on separation. After separation of the two stages, and the missile was heading towards the target at a terminal velocity of Mach 3, the terminal radar guidance system was initiated. This mode of operation meant that the missile had a minimum intercept altitude of 30 m which in theory left it unable to intercept sea skimming anti-ship missiles and low flying aircraft. However even blind the 100 kg warhead meant that some result would have been achieved. MASURCA was manufactured in three versions: *The Mark 1: this was a basic version, it was used during all qualification tests but also for a time aboard the Suffren. *The Mark 2 Mod 2: this was the first operational version. This relatively primitive version was retired in 1975. *The Mark 2 Mod 3: this was the last operational version. The weapon system Laymen tend to think of a weapon system as consisting only of the weapon itself, in this case the missile, however with MASURCA (and for that matter most missile systems) this is far from the truth. Suffren seen from aft port, to the stern is the twin armed MASURCA launcher, forward of which (in two tiers) are the fire control radars, the large radome conceals the DRBI-23 three-dimensional radar. The MASURCA weapon system consisted of: * A twin arm launcher of 40 metric tons (44 short tons), high and wide, trainable in elevation and azimuth. Providing the initial direction of the missile to the target, it could launch missiles at elevations from +6¬∞ to +70¬∞. *A working chamber located to the rear of the launch arms and pedestal. This chamber permitted the mounting and unfolding of the rear tail control services and facilitated the loading of the missiles onto the launch arms. *A magazine consisting of two horizontal silos for the storage of 17 ready to fire missiles and space for a single missile to undergo verification for proper operation *A magazine for the storage of unassembled missiles. *A missile assembly cradle. It was difficult to assemble more than 12 missiles in a day's work, in particular ceramic components within the missiles were very susceptible to shock damage during assembly. *Two DRBR-51 tracking radars with two associated illuminators *Fire control Computer *A single DRBI-23 three-dimensional radar *A single SENIT 2 automatic tactical information processor *Target designators for weapon assignment Whereas the weight of 48 missiles is 96 metric tons (105.8 short tons), counting the entire weapon system as a whole, the weight was closer to 450 metric tons (496 short tons). This great weight imposed a limit on the minimum hull size that could deploy the system, and was one reason why MASURCA was limited to only three ships of the French Navy. Operation of the mod 2 and 3, and constraints MASURCA utilised semi-active radar homing for terminal guidance requiring radar illumination of the target by its parent warship. This was provided by two groups of DRBR-51 tracking and illumination radars, allowing MASURCA equipped ships to simultaneously engage two targets. Once a target had been identified by the DRBI-23 three-dimensional radar and prioritised, the two DRBR-51 radars would be locked onto the two most dangerous targets and once they have come into range the missiles would be fired. Missiles could be launched before targets come into range, anticipating their future position. It was also possible for more than two missiles to be launched simultaneously. Although only two could be actively controlled, the launch arms would send the following missiles in the right direction. If the first two missiles were destroyed or had missed, the following missiles could be immediately gathered in to re-attack the same target or, if the first target had been destroyed, allocated to attack another. However, at two tonnes, the MASURCA missile was not the easiest of missiles to handle, and reloading of the launch arms was relatively long, leading to a delay between the first and any subsequent salvo of missiles. This mode of operation was common to both the service variants of the MASURCA, the mod 2 and the mod 3. The mod 2 was relatively primitive, the missile had no way of perceiving the target other than through the proximity fuse, the missile operating in effect as a command guided one, the accuracy of the missile dependent on the tracking systems ability to maintain a lock on the target which could become indistinct with increasing range, altitude and speed of the target. The final service version, the mod 3, was a true semi- active radar homing (SARH) missile with a continuous-wave radar receiver built into the missile, which homed in on the CW radar return of the illumination radar. This CW return, reflected from the target, would be scattered in all directions however the closer the missile came to the target, the \\"brighter\\" the target would appear increasing the chance of a hit. In addition the reaction time of the missile reduced as the range to the target decreased, which was not true of the radio controlled mod 2. Deployment and operations The MASURCA was a medium-range area defence missile, intended not just for the self-protection of the vessel it is deployed aboard but to provide air defence to accompanying vessels. MASURCA was for over thirty years, together with other systems, responsible for providing anti-aircraft and anti-missile protection for the French carrier battle groups. The number of MASURCA ship-sets was repeatedly reduced in line with reductions in the French naval budget. The six complete systems that were initially ordered was very quickly reduced to five. Heavy and complex to introduce, MASURCA required a vessel with a minimum displacement of at least 5000 tons, requiring more expensive ships than France at the time was willing to fund. The budget allocation for 1960-65, adopted on 6 December 1960, therefore allowed for no more than three units of the Suffren class. However the third ship was to be finally cancelled in order to free funds for the purchase of 42 F-8 Crusader fighters to serve aboard the new carriers and . The third ship-set was destined for the helicopter carrier but was not available during her construction. This final MASURCA system was later to be installed aboard the cruiser Colbert during her 1970-1972 refit. This allowed the Marine Nationale to field a four ship squadron of RIM-24 Tartar equipped T-47 fleet escorts, in addition to three ships with, for their time, capable air defence systems, Suffren, Duquesne and Colbert. These three ships would be used on numerous missions to provide air-defence cover for French fleets and allies in peacekeeping and military operations: Lebanon (1980‚Äì86), Iraq (Daguet (1989), Gulf War (1990‚Äì91), Op√©ration Balbuzard (1993-1994, during the Siege of Sarajevo by the Serbs). MASURCA was retired from service in 2009 without ever having been fired in anger, it was replaced in service by the Aster 30 missile aboard the s Forbin and .

While he was supported by two particular friends, Weeden Butler and John Coakley Lettsom, his efforts were distinct from those of John Howard, and the Quaker group including Elizabeth Fry.Richard H. Condon, James Neild, Forgotten Reformer, Studies in Romanticism Vol. 3, No. 4 (Summer, 1964), pp. 240‚Äì251, at p. 250. Published by: Boston University. . . Early life Neild was born in Knutsford, Cheshire, where his family owned property. After his father died, which left five children, including James, and Neild's mother to be supported by carrying on business as a linendraper. After a brief education, Neild lived two years with an of his uncle, who was a farmer; then at the end of 1760, Neild obtained a situation with a jeweller in London, and was later employed by Thomas Heming, the king's goldsmith. In 1770, a legacy from his farmer uncle enabled Neild to set up in business as a jeweller in London's St James's Street. The venture proved a success, and in 1792 he retired on a fortune. Neild moved to Chelsea, London,Cheyne Walk, Chelsea and concentrated on philanthropy and campaigning; he worked especially in the field of prison reform. Penal reformer In his early London days, when visiting in 1762 a fellow-apprentice who was confined for debt in the King's Bench Prison, Neild felt the necessity of reforms. Subsequently he inspected Newgate, the Derby prisons, Liverpool, Bridewell, the Chester dungeons, and before 1770 a number of prisons in northern France. The harsh treatment to which prisoners were subjected almost everywhere stirred him into activism. A sermon by Weeden Butler in February 1772 caused Neild to raise funds to secure the release of debtors. On the formation in May 1773 of a Society for the Relief and Discharge of Persons imprisoned for Small Debts, Neild was appointed treasurer, and remained associated with the society for the rest of his life. In his capacity of treasurer he visited prisons in and about London, and made weekly reports. Fifteen months after the formation of the society 986 prisoners had been discharged, at a cost of a little less than ‚Ç§2,900. In 1779 Neild extended his inspection to Flanders and Germany. In 1781 he caught gaol fever at Warwick, and his ill-health, combined with business interests, for a time interrupted his philanthropic work. Later life Neild was High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1804, and a magistrate in several areas. In the latter half of 1809, during a four months' excursion in England and Scotland, he was presented with the freedom of Glasgow, Perth, Paisley, Inverness, and Ayr. He lived at 4 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, where he died on 16 February 1814. Works In 1800 Neild published his Account of Persons confined for Debt in the various Prisons of England and Wales ‚Ä¶ with their Provisionary Allowances during Confinement, as reported to the Society for the Discharge and Relief of Small Debtors. In the third edition, published in 1808, the results of further investigations in Scotland, as well as in England, were incorporated. Neild kept a diary of his prison tours, and wrote to his friend, Dr. John Coakley Lettsom, accounts of his experiences. Lettsom persuaded Neild to publish in the Gentleman's Magazine his \\"Prison Remarks\\"; they were prefaced by Lettsom, and led to an awakening of public interest. They could also make the prison authorities defensive, as the prison visitor Sarah Martin found in Great Yarmouth, some seven years after Neild made a damaging report in 1812. In 1812, after inspecting a number of prisons, Neild published State of Prisons in England, Scotland and Wales. Along with Jeremy Bentham's Punishments and Rewards (1811), Neild's book helped to trigger parliamentary pressure for reform.Philpotts, Trey. Companion to Little Dorrit, Helm Information, 2003, p. 95. Family Neild married, in 1778, the eldest daughter of John Camden of Battersea. They had two sons and a daughter. On his death he was succeeded by his younger son John Camden Neild, the recluse and miser. His elder son William was disinherited and went abroad, in circumstances that affected Neild's posthumous reputation.

The episode aired on October 19, 2009. Plot Peter Petrelli brings Hiro Nakamura to the hospital, where Hiro reveals his terminal state due to his brain tumor. Peter decides that perhaps Hiro had come to him to be saved and, after borrowing his power, visits Noah Bennet to see if he knows of anyone that could help. Knowing that Hiro has a tumor, which is living tissue, and that Claire Bennet's regenerative blood will only enlarge the tumor, Noah recalls a boy, Jeremy Greer, whom the company had studied during his time at the Company that had the ability to instantly heal near-death living things. Peter and Noah teleport to his house, where they find Jeremy's parents dead. Noah realizes that Jeremy's power may have changed to be able to take away life as well as give it. They are soon interrupted by Jeremy, who attempts to shoot them. Noah attempts to talk to him, but Peter teleports in and pushes Noah away. Jeremy fires and Peter stops time, but finds he wasn't fast enough as he turns to see his own blood spattering behind him. Peter collapses as time reverts to normal, and Noah convinces Jeremy to heal Peter. Jeremy is able to do so. Having acquired Jeremy's ability, Peter leaves to save Hiro, while Noah calls the police to report the parents' deaths and waits with Jeremy. Peter returns to the hospital but finds Hiro gone, having only left a message: \\"Save Charlie.\\" Sylar is still unable to remember anything, and Samuel Sullivan attempts to have him remember. Sylar instead finds himself remembering Nathan Petrelli's memories, and Samuel decides to have Damien return Sylar's true memories. In the house of mirrors, Damien touches Sylar, and he begins recalling everything, including his mother's death. Meanwhile, Samuel invites the police detective who had attempted to arrest Sylar earlier to his circus, in an attempt to bait Sylar into his old ways. Samuel tells Sylar where he his, implying he go kill him, and Sylar finds the detective in the house of mirrors. Sylar tries to tell him to leave, but he involuntarily hits him with his electric powers. The detective manages to get up. At this point, Edgar rushes in and kills the detective. Later, Sylar is welcomed into Samuel's family, with Lydia taking a particular liking to him. Edgar questions what use Sylar will be, but Samuel assures him he will be. Emma Coolidge is trying to understand her new ability, and asks Hiro how she can get rid of her powers. Hiro tries to convince Emma to embrace them, and invites Emma to a magic show he is putting on for the kids in the hospital. Hiro has her help in a disappearing act, where he stops time. Having touched Hiro, Emma is fascinated by the colors emanating from the applause. Later, Emma asks Hiro how he can stay so focused in the face of death, and Hiro mentions that he knew someone who also was dying but kept a positive attitude. Hiro reveals it to be Charlie Andrews, a waitress in Texas who had been one of Sylar's first victims and was dying from a brain aneurism. Hiro says he intends to save her, as he has been keeping a list to correct all the wrongs he's done. Emma tells him to wait for Peter first. Later, Emma plays the piano as Hiro watches. Emma tells him to head back to his room, but as Hiro turns to leave, he vanishes. Hiro is then shown to have traveled three years back in time, standing outside the diner where Charlie worked.

His mother, Ramayamma, died in 1923. Kotcherlakota Rangadhama Rao had an arranged marriage to Vaddadi Perramma, as was the custom in the region. On 6 December 1925, when Rangadhama Rao was 27, the couple's first child, Ramakrishna Rao, was born. Rangadhama Rao and Vaddadi Perramma had seven more children, four sons and three daughters: Venkata Rao (5 February 1928); Venkata Narsing Rao (27 June 1933); Ramaleela (24 April 1938); Lakshmi Narayana (23 July 1940); Lalitha Kumari (31 July 1941); Amarnath (8 June 1944); and Vijaya Vani (19 December 1945). Education His elementary education was at Maharaja's High School, Vizianagaram for the 3rd, 4th and 5th grades during 1904 and 1906. He joined in different schools each year in his early education. He was shifted to London Mission High School, Vizianagaram, for the 6th grade and studied 7th and 8th grades in Hindu High School at Machilipatnam. He passed his 10th grade (SSLC) in C.B.M. High School at Visakhapatnam and 12th grade (Intermediate), from Mrs. A.V.N. College at Visakhapatnam. Prof. K. Rangadhama Rao was in the first batch of students for the B.A. degree course in 1920 (there was no B.Sc. degree course at that time in Madras University) in the Maharajah's College in Vizianagaram. The B.A Degree course was initiated by Dr. Appadvedula Lakshmi Narayan in 1918.Biographical Memoirs, Appadvedula Lakshmi Narayan Prof. K.R.Rao took his M.A. in Physics from Tiruchirappalli in 1923. His research career started in 1923 when he enrolled as a Research Scholar for D.Sc. (Doctor of Science) from Madras University. He was awarded the D.Sc. Degree from Madras University and was selected for studies abroad from the Andhra University in 1928. This was a turning point in his quest for knowledge and research of his lifetime. Career In 1924, Dr. K. Rangadhama Rao joined Dr. A.L.Narayan as a research scholar in University of Madras. Both of them worked tenaciously to build up a first rate spectroscopic laboratory second to none in the country. They had then with them a constant deviation spectrograph, a small quartz spectrograph and a medium quartz spectrograph. All these were of low dispersion and low resolving power. At this stage of their work, they required an instrument of high dispersion and high resolving power, which they could not afford. So, K.R.Rao went to Calcutta, where a ten-foot concave grating was available in the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science of which C. V. Raman was Director and with the facilities provided there, they further extended their work on analysis of spectra in the visible and ultraviolet regions. He was guided in his research career by Prof. A.Fowler at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London in 1930 in Atomic Spectra for two years for which he was awarded the D.Sc. Degree from London University. In 1930, he had the opportunity of working under Prof. F.Paschen at the Physikalische Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin for six months and under Prof. Manne Seigbahn in Upsala, Sweden on Vacuum Spectroscopy for another six months. His interest in the field of Spectroscopy was so much that he built a Vacuum Spectrograph of his design with his own expenses at Potsdam, Germany. Prof. K.R.Rao's contribution towards physics has placed him in a high position even in his times. His contributions include development of Diatomic and Polyatomic Molecular Spectroscopy laboratory dealing with High Resolution Vibrational structure in electronic transitions, U.V.Absorption, Infrared Absorption, Raman scattering, Fluorescence and Phosphorescence and Crystal Spectra. He also reached the level of construction of microwave test benches and using these techniques he created different lines of investigations in dielectrics. He contributed to the development of Radio Frequency Spectroscopy which branched into Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. In India, work on NQR was first initiated by Prof. K. Rangadhama Rao in the Physics laboratories of Andhra University. Kotcherlakota Rangdhama Rao was the Principal of Andhra University Colleges from 1949-57. He was appointed as Emeritus Professor of Physics at Andhra University (1966‚Äì72) and was special officer for the establishment of Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupathi (1954). Contributions During his early life of work in the Physics department of Andhra University, Prof. K.R.Rao, established scholarships in his father's name, Kotcherlakota Venkata Narsinga Rao. Kotcherlakota Venkata Narsinga Rao Scholarship While a Reader in the Physics Department of Jeypore Vikram Deo College of Science and Technology, Rao instituted a Research Scholarship in memory of his late father.Annual Register of Andhra University Honours, distinctions and awards Prof. Rangadhama Rao was one of the foundation members for the AP Akademi of Sciences, nominated by the Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1963.AP Akademi of Science The Indian National Science Academy frequently conducts a Memorial Lecture Award in the honour of Prof. Kotcherlakota Rangadhama Rao since its inception in 1979.Indian National Science Academy Prof Rangadhama Rao Memorial Lecture Award Prof. Kotcherlakota Rangadhama Rao Memorial Lecture Award is given for the outstanding contributions in the subject of Spectroscopy in Physics.

Names The Chinese character ( in traditional Chinese; ' in Pinyin) means \\"bird\\". The Chinese character ( in traditional Chinese; ' in Pinyin) literally means \\"insect\\", but by extension can mean any creature that looks like a \\"worm\\", including invertebrate worms and reptiles such as snakes and lizards (and even the Chinese dragon). The character means \\"seal (script)\\". Other names for this kind of seal script: * Niao-Chong Script (). The Chinese character ( in traditional Chinese; ' in Pinyin) here means \\"script\\". * Niao- Chong Characters (). The Chinese character (' in Pinyin) here means \\"character\\". There are two subcategories (sub-styles): * Bird seal script (. Or, (the University of Michigan)) ** In this style, some parts of characters have a bird-like head and tail added. The bird style sign is a combination of two parts: a complete seal script character and one (sometimes two) bird shape(s). * Worm seal script (. Or, ) ** In this style, some or all the strokes are winding, thus producing a worm-like character, but there is no additional bird shape. Introduction and history Seal script evolved from oracle bone script, and diverged into different forms in the Spring and Autumn period, after the power of the Zhou dynasty waned and China began to divide into different states. This kind of seal script first appeared in the middle era of the Spring and Autumn period. It then became popular during the late Spring and Autumn period, and was most popular during the Warring States period. It was often seen in southern kingdoms, such as the Wu Kingdom (roughly today's Jiangsu Province), Yue Kingdom (roughly today's Zhejiang Province), Chu Kingdom (roughly today's Hunan and Hubei provinces), Cai Kingdom, Xu Kingdom, and the Song Kingdom. Each state in China during the Warring States Period had its own variety of script. These kinds of seal script declined after the Qin Dynasty, most likely due to the unification of writing scripts by Qin Shi Huang (unified into the small seal script), after his unification of China, although they were used during the Han Dynasty. Usage The bird seal script is often seen on bronze and iron antiques of the Yue Kingdom (roughly today's Zhejiang Province). The script was used on bronze and iron weapons, like swords, to indicate ownership or date of completion. The characters engraved on the famous Sword of Goujian provide a fine example. A few examples of the bird seal script can be seen in or on containers and jades of that period. The bird seal script was also used occasionally in the Han Dynasty seals (mainly the jade seals), as well as a few eaves tiles and bricks.„ÄäÈ∏üËô´ÁØÜÂç∞ÊäÄÊ≥ïËß£Êûê„Äã(The Analyses on the Techniques of Bird- Worm Script Seals), by Gu Songzhang(Ë∞∑ÊùæÁ´†); , ChongQin Press The worm seal script is more common in, and probably originated from the Wu Kingdom (now roughly Jiangsu Province) or Chu Kingdom (now roughly Hunan Province and Hubei Province).

Based out of Lisbon, Portugal, he continues to be one of the contemporary links in a chain of West African music that extends back in time hundreds of years.http://blogcritics.org/music/article/music-review-kimi-djabate-karam/ Early life Djabat√© was born into a poor but musically accomplished family in an area recognized as a center for music, dance, and other creative arts. His interest in music started at the age of three when he started playing the balafon, the African xylophone, quickly learning other traditional instruments. In his pre-teens he left home to the neighboring village of Sonako to study the kora. This helped him in the future by subsequently developing his guitar playing ability. His talent as a musician became much more than a childhood hobby for Djabat√© as he was required to play at local ceremonies to help contribute to the family income. This became a source of conflict for Djabat√© and his family. His parents and uncle forced him to perform against his will which took away from much of the free time other youth his age were enjoying. Djabat√©'s parents as well as his uncle, through pressuring him to perform, provided the young phenom with excellent training in traditional Mandingo music. However Djabat√© was also interested in popular African genres such as the local dance music style gumb√©, Nigerian Afrobeat, Cape Verdean morna, not to mention western jazz and blues, all of which have influenced his music. Musical career After touring Europe with the national music and dance ensemble of Guinea-Bissau, Djabat√© settled in Lisbon, Portugal. He has lived in Europe since, yet remains devoted to the music he grew up with in Guinea-Bissau. In Europe Djabat√© collaborated with various artists, including Mory Kant√© and Waldemar Bastos. In 2005, Djabat√© released his first solo album, Terik√©, which he released independently. Djabat√© second solo album, Karam, was released on July 28, 2009 under the label, Cumbancha. This one disc, fifteen song album has themes of social and political realities; the suffering of African people; the fight against poverty; freedom; women's rights; and love.

He was lead editor in the magazine The Education of Children (Œó ŒîŒπŒ¨œÄŒªŒ±œÉŒπœÇ œÑœâŒΩ Œ†Œ±ŒØŒ¥œâŒΩ) during the period from 1896 to 1948, during which time he was also the magazine's main author. His was the trademark signature \\"Œ£Œ±œÇ Œ±œÉœÄŒ¨Œ∂ŒøŒºŒ±Œπ, Œ¶Œ±ŒØŒ¥œâŒΩ\\" (\\"yours faithfully, Phaedon)\\", which he used in letters ostensibly addressed to the magazine. He was also the founder and editor of the Nea Estia magazine, which is still published. He became a member of the Academy of Athens in 1931, and founded the Society of Greek Writers (ŒïœÑŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒØŒ± ŒïŒªŒªŒÆŒΩœâŒΩ ŒõŒøŒ≥ŒøœÑŒµœáŒΩœéŒΩ) together with Kostis Palamas, Angelos Sikelianos and Nikos Kazantzakis. Life He was born on 9 December 1867 in Constantinople. His father, Dionysios, hailed from Zakynthos and his mother, Evlalia came from Constantinople. The family moved to Zakynthos soon after, where Gregorios spent his youth until 1883, when he enrolled in the University of Athens to study physics and mathematics. He never completed his studies: already in the first year, he had begun writing literature, which was his sole source of income at the time. In 1892 he moved permanently to Athens and in 1894 he married Efrosini Diogenidis. They divorced one and a half years later, having already had a daughter. In 1901 he married his second spouse Christine Kanellopoulos, with whom he had two daughters. He cooperated with several newspapers and magazines, in which he published many studies, articles, short stories and novels. In 1894 he became director of the Illustrated Estia newspaper and in 1896 the chief editor of The Education of the Children. From 1901 to 1912 he published literary works and studies in the Panathinaia, and from 1912 he cooperated with Ethnos newspaper, writing serialized novels. In 1927 he founded the magazine Nea Estia, whose director he was until 1934. His house, including his library, was destroyed during the Dekemvriana clashes in Athens in 1944. He died in Athens on 14 January 1951 and was buried at public expense. Works Prose Xenopoulos was a prolific writer. He wrote over 80 novels and a large number of short stories. He first became known to the literary world through his first novel: \\"Œü ŒÜŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒöœåœÉŒºŒøœÖ\\" (O anthropos tou kosmou, \\"Man of the world\\"). This novel and his next one, \\"Nikolas Sigalos\\" (1890), written in the New Athenian style, were not successful. He then turned for inspiration to his birthplace, Zakynthos, and as a result wrote some of his best novels, such as \\"Magaret Stefa\\" (1893) and ŒöœåŒ∫Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒøœÇ ŒíœÅŒ¨œáŒøœÇ (Kokkinos Vrachos, \\"Red Rock\\", 1905). These were followed by further novels in the New Athenian style: \\"Œü œÄœåŒªŒµŒºŒøœÇ\\" (O polemos, \\"War\\", 1914), \\"ŒüŒπ ŒúœÖœÉœÑŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ ŒëœÅœÅŒ±Œ≤œéŒΩŒµœÇ\\" (I mystikoi aravones, \\"The Secret Engagement\\", 1915) and the Ionian School novel \\"Laura\\" (1915), which was also one of his most admired. But his most ambitious work was the trilogy: \\"Œ†ŒªŒøœçœÉŒπŒøŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÜœÑœâœáŒøŒØ\\" (plousioi kai ftochoi, \\"The Rich and the Poor\\", 1919), \\"Œ§ŒØŒºŒπŒøŒπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ¨œÑŒπŒºŒøŒπ\\" (Timioi kai atimoi, \\"The Honest and the Dishonest\\", 1921), \\"Œ§œÖœáŒµœÅŒøŒØ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ¨œÑœÖœáŒøŒπ\\" (Tycheroi kai atychoi, \\"The Lucky and the Unlucky\\", 1924). Other novels include: \\"ŒëŒΩŒ±Œ¥œÖŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑\\" (Anadyomeni, 1923), \\"ŒôœÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≠ŒªŒªŒ±\\" (Isabella, 1923), \\"Œ§ŒµœÅŒ≠Œ∂Œ± ŒíŒ¨œÅŒºŒ±-ŒîŒ±Œ∫œåœÉœÑŒ±\\" (Teresa Varma-Dakosta, 1925). His novels are set in Athens and Zakynthos, and he is considered to be a proponent of the \\"urban novel\\". The main theme of his works is love, particularly love between people of different classes. His work has been criticised for putting quantity ahead of quality, with many sequels, and for pandering to the tastes of his readers with scenes which were sexually provocative for the period. However he has also been praised for his narrative strength and ability to hold the readers attention. Theatrical His first theatrical play was: \\"Œü œàœÖœáŒøœÄŒ±œÑŒ≠œÅŒ±œÇ\\" (O Psychopateras, \\"The Stepfather\\"), which was first performed in 1895. He cooperated with the \\"Nea Skini\\" theatrical troupe of Konstantinos Christomanos. His most famous theatrical plays are: \\"Œ§Œø ŒºœÖœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œå œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒöŒøŒΩœÑŒ≠œÉœÉŒ±œÇ ŒíŒ±ŒªŒ≠œÅŒ±ŒπŒΩŒ±œÇ\\" (To mystiko tis kontessas Valerainas, \\"The Secret of Countess Valerena\\", 1904), \\"Œ£œÑŒ≠ŒªŒªŒ± ŒíŒπŒøŒªŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒ∑\\" (Stella Violanti, 1909, with Marika Kotopouli), \\"Œ¶ŒøŒπœÑŒ∑œÑŒ±ŒØ\\", (Foititai, \\"Students\\"). In all he wrote 46 theatrical plays. In 1901 he played a leading part with Kostis Palamas in establishing the theatre \\"Nea Skini\\" and because of his fluency in many languages, he was aware of important intellectual developments in major European countries at that time. In addition, he wrote introductions for Henrik Ibsen. He also produced many translations. His first play to be performed at the Royal Theatre of Athens (renamed after renovation in 1932 as the National Theatre of Greece) was \\"Œü Œ∏ŒµŒØŒøœÇ ŒåŒΩŒµŒπœÅŒøœÇ\\" (O theios Oneiros, \\"Uncle Dream\\"). Categories of works He wrote dramas and comedies with the common subject, love. His work is a window into contemporary Greek society. His works are categorized by the place that they were written, some in Zakynthos and the rest in Athens. His work tried to find a balance between the Ionian School and the New Athenian School. * Zakynthian: \\"Stella Violanti\\", \\"Rachil\\", \\"Fotini Saranti\\", \\"O popolaros\\", \\"The secret of Contessa Valeriana\\". * Athenian: \\"Foititai\\", \\"Psychosavvato\\", \\"To anthropino\\". Literary criticism Xenopoulos is notable for his literary criticism. In the magazine \\"Panathinaia\\" (\\"Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ±\\"), he published a lot of reviews of famous Greek writers, such as Alexandros Papadiamantis, Demetrius Vikelas etc. In 1903 he was the first to introduce Constantine P.

It was disbanded and the headquarters was recreated as an Army headquarters in 1945. Formation General Sir Montagu Stopford, GOC XXXIII Indian Corps (right), confers with Major General J M L Grover, GOC 2nd Division (left) and Brigadier J A Salomons, Commander 9th Indian Brigade (centre), after the opening of the Imphal-Kohima road. The Corps was created at Bangalore in India on 15 August 1942. Its first commander was Lieutenant General Philip Christison. On 15 October 1943, Christison was transferred to command Indian XV Corps, which was then about to go into action in the Burma Campaign, and replaced as commander of XXXIII Corps by Lieutenant General Montagu Stopford. For much of its early history, the Corps was stationed in Southern India, preparing troops for several planned amphibious operations against the Japanese in the Indian Ocean. Fourteenth Army The corps was added to the order of battle of Fourteenth Army during the crisis of spring 1944. Japanese forces were besieging the British force at Imphal, with a detachment blocking the only road by which they could be relieved at Kohima. XXXIII Corps was dispatched to command the relief effort mounted from Assam. Its units were first concentrated around Dimapur, a vital railhead and logistic depot. Once sufficient troops had arrived, the British 2nd Division relieved the surrounded Indian 161st Brigade, which in turn relieved the defenders of Kohima. For several weeks, 2nd Division, joined later by the 7th Indian Infantry Division made repeated attacks to drive the Japanese from the positions they had captured on Kohima ridge, while the British 23rd Brigade (a Chindit formation) cut the Japanese lines of communication. Once the Japanese were forced into a retreat, the corps drove south to relieve Imphal. On 22 June 1944, troops from XXXIII Corps met Indian forces advancing north from Imphal, relieving the siege. The Corps then undertook the elimination of Japanese forces around Ukhrul, and the administration of several divisions resting after the battles. Late in 1944, a general offensive to liberate Burma began. At the start of the operation (Operation Capital), the XXXIII Corps was the right flank striking force of Fourteenth Army, with IV Corps on its left. After it was realised that the Japanese had forestalled the attack by withdrawing behind the Irrawaddy River, the corps became the left flank formation, attacking into the Shwebo Plain between the Chindwin River and the Irrawaddy. It consisted of the British 2nd Division, the Indian 19th and 20th Divisions, the motorised Indian 268th Infantry Brigade and the Grant and Stuart tanks of the 254th Indian Tank Brigade. During late February, the corps captured bridgeheads over the Irrawaddy on a wide front, distracting Japanese attention from the main thrust by IV Corps. During March, it launched its own offensives. The city of Mandalay was captured by the 19th Division, and the Japanese armies on the Irrawaddy were shattered. After a brief period of reorganisation, the corps was switched once again to the right flank of Fourteenth Army. The British 2nd Division was returned to India, and the Indian 20th Division took over its vehicles. During April, the corps (now consisting of the Indian 7th and 20th Divisions) advanced south down the Irrawaddy River valley. In early May, it linked up with other Indian troops who had captured Rangoon, the capital. Transformation The Allied command in Burma was rearranged in May, shortly after Rangoon fell. The Headquarters of XXXIII Corps was transformed into that of British Twelfth Army with Stopford promoted to the new command, with responsibility for further operations in Burma including the defeat of the Japanese breakout attempt in the Pegu Yomas in July and August 1945.

Reeves High went 8 years with a block schedule which consisted of four-day weeks which ran from 7:45 to 3:30. After low test scores the Allen Parish school board voted against it, which was met by negative reactions by village inhabitants and students alike.

It was recorded at an outdoor concert on August 16, 1986, held at Opus 40 in Saugerties, New York. The concert was filmed for a documentary about Rollins, directed by Robert Mugge, before being released on record in November 1987 by Milestone Records. G-Man received positive reviews from critics, some of whom called it one of Rollins' best albums.  Background  The performances on G-Man were recorded on August 16, 1986, at Opus 40 in Saugerties, where Rollins performed an outdoor concert with an ensemble that featured trombonist Clifton Anderson, bass player Bob Cranshaw, pianist Mark Soskin, and drummer Marvin \\"Smitty\\" Smith. The concert was originally filmed for Saxophone Colossus, Robert Mugge's documentary on Rollins. Some tenor saxophone parts were recorded in studio on April 9, 1987, and overdubbed onto the track \\"Kim\\", and G-Man was released in November of that year by Milestone Records. Critical reception In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau wrote that Rollins' ensemble sounds inspired by his innovative and radical saxophone playing on G-Man, which he called \\"jazz for rock-and-rollers to cut their teeth on. It's exciting, fun, a gas, all that stuff great rock and roll is supposed to be and so rarely is these days.\\" Larry Hollis of Cadence Magazine said it is the most satisfying record from Rollins' tenure at Milestone and highlighted the title track, calling it \\"an exhaustive steamroller that will stand up to return listens\\" because of how Rollins maintains interest with a variety of techniques and sounds: \\"Jagged lines breaking up smoother passages, random squeals, whinnies and shakes drawn from the honking R&B; history book or dropping down into the cellar for some low register long tones sometimes split into quick octave leaps\\". Christgau later named it the best album of 1987 in his list for the annual Pazz & Jop critics poll, and in 1990 he named it the fourth-best album of the 1980s. In a retrospective review for Wondering Sound, journalist Fred Kaplan cited G-Man as one of Rollins' greatest records and expressed amazement at his solos and strong rapport with the band, calling their music \\"head spinning\\". According to jazz critic Gary Giddins, the album was Rollins' \\"ultimate statement on the middle ground he sought between traditional constraints and free jazz‚Äîa disciplined howl of joy that seemed to steady him for the inevitable task of building a postfusion repertory\\". Jazz historian Scott Yanow was more reserved in his praise, writing in a review for AllMusic that Rollins is \\"in good form, saying little that it is new but delivering passionate messages with his typical spirit\\".

The novel is set in the same world found in the online video game Talesweaver, but has a different storyline. The world first appeared in a Korean online chatting program, 4Leaf. It has two parts; the first is Winterer, and the second is Demonic. The third part is \\"Blooded\\". Currently being published in \\"Kakaopage\\" This website is not available out side of Korea. Geography All nations are on a single continent shaped like Australia. The middle of the continent is dominated by a desert named \\"Mortal Land\\" (ÌïÑÎ©∏Ïùò ÎïÖ), literally \\"a land that when entered guarantees death\\". To the west is Anomarad, the main area of Talesweaver. The Anomarad area has a milder climate, compared to the northern areas such as Orlanne or Lemme. Before Ganapoly was founded, the whole continent was said to be an endless wasteland. Far to the south lies Ichabon Islands, and to the far north lies the Islands of the Moon. Kingdoms and their history Anomarad (ÏïÑÎÖ∏ÎßàÎùºÎìú): The capital city is Keltica (ÏºàÌã∞Ïπ¥). It is the main area of Talesweaver, and the Nenyaffle Institute is situated here. It has a mild climate. A few years before the novel, the republic government had fallen, and the political situation is still unstable. It is governed by royalty, and the republic resistance has a major hub here. Travachess (Ìä∏ÎùºÎ∞îÏ≤¥Ïä§): It is the south area of the continent, and is in a basin. This causes cold, dry winds from the mountains to sink down. The capital is Ron. It is the homeland of Boris Jineman, the main character of the first book, \\"Winterer\\". The government is a titular republic, but in reality the governor is elected by political ties. Mortal Land, an area of the ancient magic kingdom of Ganapoly (ÌïÑÎ©∏Ïùò ÎïÖ, Í∞ÄÎÇòÌè¥Î¶¨): Now a desert filled with ghosts and ruins, before the historical age it was an area of Ganapoly. Rugdurnense Union (Î£®Í∑∏ÎìúÎÑ®Ïä§ Ïó∞Î∞©): South-eastern area. It is a union of city-states. It has passed its peak of prosperity, and the capital is changed annually. * Durnensa (ÎëêÎ•¥ÎÑ®ÏÇ¨): A city- nation infamous for piracy and trading * Lekordable (Î†àÏΩîÎ•¥Îã§Î∏î): Due to the proximity to Mortal Land, there are many mercenaries * Rugran (Î£®Í∑∏ÎûÄ): The oldest nation in the union. Culture hub of the whole continent, and origin of the Silver Skull * Palshue (ÌåîÏäà): Separated from Durnensa * Haiakan (ÌïòÏù¥ÏïÑÏπ∏): South-eastern coastal area. The beautiful shores and sunny skies encourage rich people to buy vacation houses there. Ichabon Islands (Ïù¥Ïπ¥Î≥∏ Íµ∞ÎèÑ):Although the spelling from the official map is Ichanbon, a more exact romanization is Ikabone. The Arnim family owns this area. They are descendants of the Ganapoly. To prove their loyalty to Arnim family, they regularly pay tribute. The Anomarad people believe the islands are deserted. Two notable islands are Perriwinkle (ÌéòÎ¶¨ÏúôÌÅ¥) and Red Sky Island (ÎÖ∏ÏùÑÏÑ¨). Islands of the Moon (Îã¨Ïùò ÏÑ¨): Currently is independent of the nations of the continent. The only way to reach the island is by stopping at Ebb Island (Ïç∞Î¨ºÏÑ¨), between the continent and the Islands of the Moon. The people worship the Goddess of the Moon and want to reconstruct 'the ancient kingdom'. Many things resemble Ganapoly. The names of people are said to predict their life. People on the continent don't know the island exists. Sansruria (ÏÇ∞Ïä§Î£®Î¶¨ÏïÑ): Northeastern area of the continent, isolated by the sea and Mortal Land. One of this country's customs is it practices theocracy. They worship the god Sansru (which is the name of Sansruria's capital); only the high priestess can become Queen. The princess cannot marry before being enthroned. Lemme (Î†òÎØÄ): Northern area of the continent. Barbarians and civilized people coexist, yet the air is tense. The capital is Eltivo. Orlanne (Ïò§Î•ºÎûÄÎäê): The northwestern area of the continent. It is ruled by the Orlanne family. The capital is Orlie.Supplement (after the end of the book) and official map (before page 1) of the novel Ganapoly An ancient kingdom of magic which fell due to the Weapons of Evil (ÏïÖÏùò Î¨¥Íµ¨). It is said that everyone, including children and beggars, could use magic. The strongest magician was to take the throne and rule over Ganapoly. Ganapoly was situated in a great desert. Mortal Land was created because of the failed magic Prayer of Extinguishment (ÏÜåÎ©∏Ïùò Í∏∞Ïõê), which not only eradicated the evil scourging the land, but also whisked away the bodies (but not the souls) of the magicians casting the spell, causing them to become deranged ghosts.

Anarose Tikaram (ÏïÑÎÇòÎ°úÏ¶à Ìã∞Ïπ¥Îûå) ‚Äì She was the greatest magician after the Ganapoly fell. She sealed a fragment of the \\"Bleeding Spear\\", one of the artifacts that brought about the fall the Ganapoly. Aurellie LowerTikaram (ÏïÑÏö∞Î†êÎ¶¨Ïóê Î°úÏñ¥Ìã∞Ïπ¥Îûå) ‚Äì Descendant of Anarose and Ichabon. The Promised Ones (ÏïΩÏÜçÏùò ÏÇ¨ÎûåÎì§) ‚Äì They were the right arm of Ichabon von Arnim, first of the Arnim family and the first Demonic. When their promise didn't come true, they became ghosts after death. They follow Joshua, a descendant of Icavone. In the end, their promise is fulfilled and they pass into the Promised land, north of the continent. Kelslity Balmiad (ÏºàÏä§ÎãàÌã∞ Î∞úÎØ∏ÏïÑÎìú) ‚Äì Best friend of Ichabon von Arnim, and one of the Promised Ones. Many years after his death, he meets Joshua and becomes his friend. Teostid da Moro (ÌÖåÏò§Ïä§Ìã∞Îìú Îã§ Î™®Î°ú) ‚Äì Husband of Evnoa. He loves only Evnoa and doesn't care for Joshua. Enistam Voelf (ÏóêÎãàÏä§ÌÉÑ ÎµêÌîÑ) ‚Äì Friend of Teo, and a mage. He made the main part of Teo's plan, Max Cardi. Max Cardi (ÎßâÏä§ Ïπ¥Î•¥Îîî) ‚Äì He is a clone of Joshua. He was given the name by Joshua, to be used as a stage name. Salaryman (ÏÉêÎü¨Î¶¨Îß®) ‚Äì A assassin for hire. He is a top-class fighter. He chased Joshua, nearly killing him every time they met. His right hand was enchanted with a fragment of the Bronze Shield, one of the Weapons of Evil. He has a slight agoraphobia. Special items and abilities ;Winterbottom Kit: A piece of plate armor and a bastard sword. They are magical items of the Jineman family, and was found in the Ganapoly ruins. Their power is second only to the Four Evil Weapons when they were whole. :Snowguard ‚Äì A white chain armor. It was buried with Yepnen, and exists no more. :Winterer ‚Äì A white bastard sword. The sword only tries to achieve the wielder's wish. Many souls are trapped in it. ;Weapons of the Evil: Cause of the fall of the Ganapoly. The easiest way to destroy them is to implant them into the body of a living being; however, the being is controlled by and can use the power of the Weapon, thus making it hard to destroy. Another way to destroy them is to use the Prayer of Extinction. This method requires more than one highly skilled Ganapolian magician, and they must sacrifice their lives. :Bleeding Spear (ÌîºÌùòÎ¶¨Îäî Ï∞Ω) ‚Äì The largest fragment, the Spear was sealed in the underground of Twilight Island, part of Perriwinkle Islands. Anarose keeps the spear head sealed. :Brass Shield (Ìô©ÎèôÎπõ Î∞©Ìå®) ‚Äì The Brass Shield was said to be shattered into countless pieces by Evgenis. :Silver Helm (ÏùÄÎπõ Ìà¨Íµ¨) :Green-blue Cuirass (ÎÖπÏ≤≠Ïùò Ïû•Í∞ë) ;Dolls :Normal type: It looks like a human, yet only has enough intelligence to do simple, repetitive tasks. :Clone type: It is a complete clone, including memories, of a single person. It is usually controlled by a 'core' that is stored separately from the doll. ;Magic Mirrors :Common type: Door to its \\"pair\\" mirror. :Wish Mirror: Door to anywhere, including other dimensions or imaginary realms. They read the user's wish. Only two mirrors are known to have existed; one is in the capital city ruin of Ganapoly, and the other disappeared from Perriwinkle Island. ;Talents :Demonic ‚Äì It is talent in every field: magic, playing music, singing, logic, even ruling over and communicating with ghosts. Except Ichabon, Hispanie, and Joshua, all demonics ultimately went mad. :Tiella, Tigris ‚Äì A swordfighting style from Ganapoly. Tiella is a duel-wielding style, and Tigris uses one long sword. Because these swordsmanships are close to magic, they have special abilities. One skill of the Tiella strikes life energy directly, while in Tigris the speed of sword accelerates and the sword seemingly arcs in useless directions, only to strike at the weak points of the enemy. The sword style is described as \\"breaking the rhythm of the fight\\". :Holy Chant ‚Äì Magical songs that realizes magic from the music. Maximin's violin can play it, but he doesn't have sheet music. \\"Demonic\\" Joshua can sing it without training, but he doesn't know the theory for composing it. Only Isolestie and Boris know the theory and can compose and sing it. Evipiono can also sing, but he is a Ganapolian. Contradictions In book 3 of Demonic, Kelsnity (a ghost that follows Joshua) states that normal people cannot talk with ghosts. However, in book 7, a normal person, the consul of Periwinkle Islands hears not one, but four ghosts speak, and they were not speaking to the consul on purpose.

While Yanow's retrospective view differs dramatically from the generally favorable critical reaction accorded the album's release, one contemporary reviewer, jazz historian and Los Angeles Times critic Leonard Feather, foreshadowed Yanow precisely and passionately. Stating that the album, \\"complete with fleeting quotes from 'Pop Goes the Weasel', 'Jim', 'Mairzy Doats' and a dozen other sources, suggests what one might hear if any Rollins- like saxophonist were caught warming up in the dressing room,\\" Feather went further, taking some of his colleagues to task: > It is alarming that a genuine colossus of jazz, rightly hailed 25 years ago > as an emperor, can remove his raiments and be seen by responsible critics as > fully clothed. What is happening to critical responsibility? To Sonny > Rollins? To jazz? One star. Feather was not entirely alone; High Fidelity cited \\"Rollins' obvious discomfort and nervous flitting about,\\" which \\"ultimately grinds The Solo Album down to the level of a hip parlor game.\\" Still, theirs was decidedly the minority view. The New York Times critic Jon Pareles, writing shortly after the album's release, described it as \\"one of Mr. Rollins's most illuminating albums,\\" adding that it \\"may be as close as we can get to a great jazz musician's stream of consciousness.\\" Others sounded a similar theme, including Saturday Review's John Swenson, who described the album as \\"nearly an hour [of] Rollins develop[ing] stunning solo ideas that rank with some of the best playing of his career,\\" The Providence Journal's Jim MacNie, who called it \\"an amazing tour de force,\\" and The Boston Phoenix, which named it one of the top 10 jazz albums of 1985. The reviewer for The Saxophone Symposium, a periodical of the North American Saxophone Alliance, described his \\"considerable time spent\\" with Rollins' album as \\"[p]robably one of my most intense recent listening experiences,\\" while Musician's Chip Stern called the album \\"a wondrous thing, like the peak of some inscrutable mountain parting through the clouds for the first time,\\" noting its emphasis of \\"melodic rhythmic development over the harmonic,\\" and ascribing to Rollins' improvisation \\"a stately thematic inevitability that would do Mozart proud.\\" Track listing :All compositions by Sonny Rollins # \\"Soloscope, Part 1\\" - 28:15 # \\"Soloscope, Part 2\\" - 27:55 :*Recorded at the Sculpture Garden of the Museum Of Modern Art, NYC on July 19, 1985 Personnel *Sonny Rollins: tenor saxophone References Category:1985 live albums Category:Sonny Rollins live albums Category:Milestone Records live albums ","title":"The Solo Album"},{"id":"24441069","text":"Mikita Brottman (born 1966) is a British American non-fiction author, scholar, and psychologist known for her interest in true crime. Her writing blends a number of genres, often incorporating elements of autobiography, psychoanalysis, forensic psychology, and literary history.  Life and career  Brottman was born in Sheffield, England, and educated at St. Hilda's College and St. Hugh's College, University of Oxford, from which she received a D.Phil in English Language and Literature (1994). She was Visiting Professor of Comparative literature at Indiana University and was Chair of the Program in Humanities with an emphasis in Depth Psychology at the Pacifica Graduate Institute from 2008 to 2010.http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/arts/bs- ae-mikita-brottman-20160722-story.html She is a certified psychoanalyst and a full faculty Professor in the Department of Humanistic Studies at the Maryland Institute College of Art, in Baltimore. Brottman also works in the Maryland prison system and in forensic psychiatric facilities.  Themes  Brottman's work has included writing on horror films, critical theory, reading, psychoanalysis, animals, and the work of the American folklorist, Gershon Legman. Her articles and case studies have appeared in The American Journal of Psychoanalysis, New Literary History, American Imago, and other journals. Her essays have also appeared in a number of books and anthologies. Her book The Solitary Vice: Against Reading (2009) was selected as one of the Best Books of 2009 by Publishers Weekly, who said: \\"Sharp, whimsical and impassioned, Brottman's look at the pleasures and perils of compulsive reading is itself compulsively readable and will connect with any book lover.\\"Publishers Weekly Best Books of 2009 In 2018, a Spanish edition was published by Blackie Books, under the title Contra La Lectura. The most consistent focus of Brottman's work, however, is her reconsideration and transformation of the true crime genre. Thirteen Girls (Nine-Banded Books, 2012) is a story cycle of fictionalized narratives, each based on a real victim of a serial killer, each told from a different perspective. According to a review of the book in Rain Taxi, \\"Brottman‚Äôs grimly pragmatic literary stance recalls such earlier artists of the quotidian macabre as Shirley Jackson and Flannery O‚ÄôConnor: Thirteen Girls is an impressive successor to their stories of American dread.\\" The Maximum Security Book Club: Reading Literature in a Men's Prison (2016) describes Brottman's relationship with nine inmates in a reading group she started at Jessup Correctional Institution, a men's maximum security prison, and their reactions to the works of classic literature they read together. Her most recent book, An Unexplained Death - The True Story of a Body at the Belvedere (2018), is a discursive and philosophical meditation on suicide, voyeurism, missing people, deaths in hotels, and the author's obsessive investigation into the mysterious death of Rey Rivera in Baltimore's Belvedere Hotel in 2006. Described by James Ellroy as \\"a learned, lucid, and finally heartbreaking account of urban obsession,\\" the book has been short-listed for the 2019 Gold Dagger for nonfiction by the Crime Writers' Association of the United Kingdom. Brottman's true crime podcast, Forensic Transmissions, is a curated archive of unedited public domain audio files.  Personal life  Brottman is the partner of the American film critic David Sterritt.

A descendant of Sunny's Halo, he was sired by Fit to Fight and bred by Upson Downs Farm. Scrappy T was a multiple graded stakes winner but is remembered most for his collision with Afleet Alex and runner-up finish in the 2005 Preakness Stakes.Pedigee Online, Thoroughbred Database website;  Early career  His trainer, Robbie Bailes, picked Scrappy T at an auction in Florida at the Ocala Breeders Sale as a two-year-old and bought him for $35,000 for owner Marshall Dowell of Mechanicsville, Virginia. Scrappy T trained in a small work stable at the dilapidated Bowie Training Center. After breaking his maiden at Delaware Park, he finished second in his New York stakes debut at odds of 23-1 and two races later won the Count Fleet Stakes at 11-1. His next race was the grade three Whirlaway Stakes on Feb. 12, where he raced uncharacteristically off the lead and dug down in the stretch to finish third, missing first by 1-1/2 lengths. Scrappy T came back to race in the Wood Memorial Stakes as his final Triple Crown prep, which Bellamy Road won by a record margin with Scrappy T third. In the grade three $150,000 Withers Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack, he posted a one-length victory over six challengers. Pressing the early pace set by War Plan, the Fit to Fight gelding took charge turning for home and dug in to hold off a late run by Park Avenue Ball. War Plan held on for third as Scrappy T covered the one-turn mile in 1:35 on a sealed track listed as good.  Preakness Stakes  After the Withers, Scrappy T was entered in the grade one Preakness Stakes. He was listed on the morning line as the eleventh choice at 20-1 in a full field of fourteen stakes winners in the second jewel of the Triple Crown. The vast majority of public support was wagered on the top three finishers in the Derby: Afleet Alex, Giacomo, and Closing Argument. As the gates opened, Scrappy T had the best break and cleared the field. Going into Pimlico's famous club house turn, speedy Going Wild led the field followed by High Limit, Scrappy T, and Galloping Grocer. Down the back stretch, High Limit pulled in front and led for a half mile followed by Going Wild. Jockey Ramon Dominguez wrestled with Scrappy T to settle down and conserve some energy back in third. On the far turn, Scrappy T took the lead. In the meantime, favorite Afleet Alex weaved through traffic and came up on the outside flank of Scrappy T. Dominguez hit Scrappy T with a left-handed whip. Tasting his first left-handed whip, Scrappy T veered right suddenly and blew the turn while Afleet Alex was attempting to pass him. The horses collided, with Afleet Alex knocked to his knees. Jeremy Rose righted Afleet Alex and rode him to a four and three quarter length win with Scrappy T second ahead of Derby winner Giacomo and millionaire Sun King by five and six lengths respectively. He earned $200,000 for the runner-up finish and skipped the Belmont Stakes.  Retirement  Scrappy T retired before the 2008 season began. As a gelding, he could not go to stud. He now lives on the William Mason Farm on the family property in Powhatan, Virginia, fox hunting with his handler, Danielle Mason.

Jones was known as a quick and elusive runner, but was also noted for his numerous injuries which limited his international and club appearances. Club career Jones was a product of the Welsh Secondary Schools Rugby Union system, playing competitive matches while still a schoolboy. Educated at Porth Secondary School, and although wanting to play association football was forced towards rugby union as a schoolboy through the sporting curriculum of Llandovery College. Jones gained his first cap as part of the Welsh secondary schools team and came to the attention of the rugby world in a brilliant display in April 1932 in a Secondary Schools game against Yorkshire Schools. During the 1932/33 season Jones was given the captaincy of Llandovery.Smith (1980), pg 270. Before his eighteenth birthday Jones was already playing for Pontypridd and Cardiff, but after leaving Llandovery he was accepted into Cambridge and was selected for the university's rugby team. While there he teamed up with Wilf Wooller, though they both found themselves on the same losing side during the 1933 Varsity match. Jones managed only 22 appearances for Cardiff, mainly due to injuries sustained on the pitch. He suffered four broken bones before he reached the age of twenty, missed much of the 1936/37 season with a broken collar bone and injured his elbow on a comeback game in 1939.Thomas (1980), pg 88. International rugby career Jones was first capped for Wales in 1934, while still at Cambridge, at Cardiff Arms Park against England. The team is recognised as a mess, with 13 of the players being new caps resulting in an unbalanced pack with slow service. Jones was battered by England's Fry and Hordern which left him in tears during the game. Wales lost the game 9-0 and 5 of the new caps were never selected again, though Jones was not amongst them, returning for the next two games of the tournament against Scotland and Ireland; both saw Welsh wins. Jones returned to the Welsh squad the next year in the 1935 Home Nations Championship, and in the second game of the tournament against Scotland he scored his first International try. 1935 saw the touring New Zealand team arrive in Wales and Jones was selected for Wales to face them. Jones was a controversial choice as his inclusion split the half back unit of Haydn Tanner and Willie Davies who had been key in Swansea's victory over the All Blacks three months previous.Billot (1980), pg 106. In a tight game, which saw Wales's Don Tarr leave the field with a broken neck, Jones finished on the winning team as the All Blacks lost 12-13. In 1936 Jones played in all three games of the Home Nations Championship which saw Wales raise the trophy, scoring his second and final international try, again against Scotland. He missed the 1937 tournament as he was suffering from a broken collar bone. In 1938 Jones was selected to captain Wales for all three Championship games. The first game was against England in which Wales and Jones in particular were impressive in a 14-8 win. Wales may well have taken the title, after also beating Ireland, but were denied a win when Scotland were awarded a penalty two minutes before time when an unconscious Welsh player was deemed to be lying purposefully on the ball. Scotland successfully converted the penalty to win 8-6. Jones finished his Wales career captaining his team and narrowly missing the Grand Slam. International matches played for Wales WalesSmith (1980), pg 467. * 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938 * 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938 * 1935 * 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938 Later life Jones remained in rugby after he retired from playing. He became a national selector and was central in devising coaching policies for the Welsh Rugby UnionThomas (1980), pg 89. as Chairman of the WRU Coaching Sub-Committee. In the 1980-1981 season, Jones became President of the WRU in their centenary year. Jones would later receive an OBE for his services to the sport of rugby and in 1991 was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame. He died on 27 November 1990.

Early life Soegondo Djojopoespito was born as Soegondo on 22 February 1905 in the village of Tuban, East Java. His father, Kromosardjono, was an employee for forestry affairs and a headman in Tuban, while his mother was the daughter of a khotib (preacher) named Djojoatmodjo. He would later adopt the name Djojopoespito from his great-grandfather's brother. Djojopoespito began his education in 1911 at the Hollandsch-Inlandsche School (Dutch school for indigenous people) in Tuban. He graduated from the school, then continued to study at the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (junior high school) in Surabaya from 1918 to 1922. He then moved to Jogjakarta and continued his studies at the Algemene Middelbare School afdeeling b (high school for mathematics and science) from 1922 until 1925. During his time in Yogyakarta, Djojopoespito and his sister lived at Ki Hajar Dewantara's house. Influenced by Dewantara, Djojopoespito became active in the Jong Java organization during this period. According to his friends, Djojopoespito was considered an intelligent student who loved reading. Another friend of Djojopoespito, Professor Notosusanto, remarked that Djojopoespito was a smart but naughty and lazy student.  In the Union of Indonesian Students   Establishment  During his time in Yogyakarta, Djojopoespito was influenced by Ki Hajar Dewantara about Indonesian nationalism. The influence became stronger after he entered the Rechts Hoge School (RHS, High School for Law) in 1925. He regularly received the Indonesia Merdeka (Free Indonesia) magazine which was sent by the Perhimpunan Indonesia (Indonesian Union) in the Netherlands. The magazine was considered contraband in the Dutch East Indies at that time. The magazine influenced Djojopoespito, as he began to come to the house of Agus Salim, an activist from the Sarekat Islam (Islamic Union) movement. He also forwarded the magazine to some of his high school friends, such as to Suwiryo and Usman Sastroamidjojo. Sastroamidjojo then forwarded the magazine to his friend Muksinun. After that, Djojopoespito, Suwiryo, Sastroamidjojo, and Muksinun became close friends and began discussing political issues in Indonesia. In 1926, Sastroamidjojo graduated from the RHS, while Muksinun became more occupied. Although Djojopoespito was alone with Suwiryo, they managed to connect with three other college students, namely Sigit from RHS, and Goelarso and Darwis from STOVIA (medical school). Not long after their meeting, they decided to establish the Union of Indonesian Students. Sigit became the chairman of the union, Djojopoespito the secretary; Gularso, Darwis, Suwiryo, Djojopoespito, and Sigit were the core members of the union. Their main goal was to contact new students and leaders of student associations and convince them to join the union. The Union of Indonesian Students also printed secret pamphlets to overthrow the Dutch East Indies government. The pamphlets were distributed to political parties, mass organizations, and student associations. In 1927, after being appointed chairman of the Indonesian Clubgebouw (Indonesian Clubhouse), Sigit resigned from his position. He was succeeded as chairman of the union by Djojopoespito.  Second Youth Congress  As the chairman of the Union of Indonesian Students, Djojopoespito began attempts at integrating all the student associations in Dutch East Indies into the Union. He was inspired by the Association of Political Organisations of the Indonesian People, which at that time managed to unite all of the pro-Indonesian political parties in the Dutch East Indies, such as the Indonesian National Party, Islamic Union Party, and BU. Finally, in June 1928, Soegondo managed to form a committee which was consisted of representatives from student associations. Soegondo became the chairman of the committee. The committee decided to hold a youth congress to finalize the debate about the form of the new student union. Nationalist politicians, such as Sartono, Arnold Mononutu, Muhammad Nazif, and Sunario, assisted the committee to find the location for the congress, fund the congress, contact speakers for the congress, and set the time. Aside from the technical tasks, the committee also prepared the draft for the Youth Pledge that was planned to be read in the congress. The congress began at 7:30 PM on 27 October 1928 inside the Katholieke Jongelengen (Catholic Youth) building. Representatives of youth groups and political parties attended the congress, and members of the Volksraad such as Tjokorda Gde Raka Soekawati and Suryono also attended. Several Dutch also attended the congress as observers. The media and press reported on the event, and sent Wage Rudolf Supratman and Saerun as its representative. During the congress, there were two main incidents. The first occurred after a delegate used the word \\"independence\\". The word \\"independence\\" was banned in the congress, as that word was considered \\"political\\" and the congress was considered to be a non-political youth meeting. The second incident occurred after a delegate demanded that the \\"people of Indonesia should work hard so that the people could form a state equal to those of England, Japan, and other states\\". The second incident caused the delegate to be warned by the Dutch police, and Djojopoespito was asked to dismiss the congress. Djojopoespito refused the police's demands and asked for the help of Sartono to solve the problem. Sartono managed to solve the problem. The third and last session in the congress was held on the evening of 28 October 1928 in the Indonesische Clubgebouw building. The planned scout procession at the beginning of the session was cancelled after being banned by the Dutch police, causing dissatisfaction within the delegates. Thus, the session was opened with a speech about scouting from Ramelan and from Soenario. In the middle of the congress, Muhammad Yamin, who at that time was seated beside Djojopoespito, handed over a proposal for a resolution that was planned to be read at the end of the congress. Djojopoespito approved the resolution, and he passed the proposal to other delegates. The proposal was approved by all delegates. During the recess in the session, Wage Rudolf Supratman came to Djojopoespito and asked for his permission to play the Indonesia Raya song. After reading the lyrics, Djojopoespito was worried that the performance could cause some commotion. He then asked the advice of a Dutch in congress, Charles van der Plas. Van der Plas redirected him to the Police Commissary. Thus, Djojopoespito allowed Supratman to play the song, but without the lyrics. After the recess, the song was played and received ovation from the audience. The resolution, which was later dubbed as the Youth Pledge, was read at the end of the session.  Career  Soegondo Djojopoespito (second from right) during the arrest of Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, Sjahrir, and other Republican leaders. After chairing the Second Indonesian Youth Congress, Djojopoespito joined the Indonesian National Party in 1928. During this time in the party, he met again with his friend Suwiryo, who at that time dropped out of his university and became the secretary of the Indonesian National Party branch of Jakarta. In 1929, Djojopoespito's studies at the RHS, which were funded by a scholarship from the Dutch government, were halted. As a result, Djojopoespito dropped out of RHS. He found a job at the Gang Kenari People's School in Jakarta, and became the director of the school in 1930. In 1932, he moved to Bandung, and became the director of the Taman Siswa school in Bandung. As a teacher in the Taman Siswa school, he assumed the title of Ki. After the Indonesian National Party was dissolved in 1931, Soegondo joined the Indonesian Nationalist Education in 1933, then led by Sutan Sjahrir. He was tasked to recruit new members of the organization. For this purpose, he created a recruitment system called the beranting (branched) method, in which he reached out to three people and tasked those three to each reach out to three more people, and so on. As a result, the organization recruited hundreds of members in a relatively short time. In February 1934, the Dutch East Indies police organized a crackdown on the organization. The leaders of the organization, Mohammad Hatta, Sjahrir, Maskun, and Murwoto, were arrested and exiled to Boven Digoel. Djojopoespito, after being interrogated for five hours, was freed from any charges, but was banned from teaching. In 1934, Djojopoespito began publishing a weekly magazine named Penghidupan Rakjat (People's Living), but the magazine was closed in 1935 due to low circulation. From January to June 1935, he temporarily worked at the Central Statistic Office in Jakarta. His ban on teaching was revoked by the late 1935, and along with his wife, he established a school in Bogor, named Loka Siswa. Alongside the school, he also established a library and a weekly newspaper named Pasar Sabtu. His wife became the headmaster of the school, while Djojopoespito, with his friends Soejitno Mangunkusumo and Saubari, became the editor and administrator of the newspaper. Loka Siswa was closed in 1936 due to lack of student enrollment. After closing Loka Siswa, Djojopoespito moved to Semarang and began to teach at the Taman Siswa school in Semarang, while his wife taught at a school owned by Sigit. In 1938, he moved back to Bandung and was accepted as a teacher in the Handels Coloogium Ksatrian Institut there. In 1940, his wife was transferred in Jakarta and he followed her there, teaching in the Taman Siswa school in Jakarta. He also pursued a part-time job as a freelance reporter for the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad and the Indische Courant. Over time, he became more and more involved in his job as a reporter, and in 1941, he became the director of the Antara news agency, with Adam Malik as the editor and Pandu Kartawiguna as the administrator. During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Djojopoespito became an employee for the Shihabu (Justice Department), and worked in the Prison Affairs Section. His former friend in the high school, Notosusanto, became his superior. To test his proficiency, Djojopoespito was tasked by Notosoesanto to write a book about the history of the penitentiary system in the Dutch East Indies. Djojopoespito managed to finished the book on time. After the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, Djojopoespito joined the Paras (Socialist People's Party), which was led by Sutan Sjahrir. The party was merged into the Socialist Party of Indonesia (PSI) in December 1945. Djojopoespito became a member of the executive council of the party for educational affairs, while also serving as the chairman of PSI in Jogjakarta and Central Java. Following the appointment of Sudarsono as the Minister of Internal Affairs in the Second Sjahrir Cabinet, Djojopoespito succeeded him as the member of the Working Body of the Central Indonesian National Committee for economic affairs. He would hold this post until his appointment as the Minister of Societal Development in the Halim Cabinet on 17 August 1950. Djojopoespito was formally inaugurated as a minister on 20 January 1950. During his tenure, he stated that he would focus on the government's effort to reduce the size of the army by retaining only professional soldiers.

At the end of the expansion inflation was rising, possibly a result of increased deficit spending during a period of full employment. This relatively mild recession coincided with an attempt to start closing the budget deficits of the Vietnam War (fiscal tightening) and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates (monetary tightening).

One pound-foot is the torque created by one pound of force acting at a perpendicular distance of one foot from a pivot point. Conversely one pound-foot is the moment about an axis that applies one pound-force at a radius of one foot. The value in SI units is given by multiplying the following approximate factors: :One pound (force) = 4.448 222 newtons :One foot = 0.3048 m This gives the conversion factor: :One pound-foot = newton metres. The name \\"pound-foot\\", intended to minimize confusion with the foot-pound as a unit of work, was apparently first proposed by British physicist Arthur Mason Worthington. However, the torque unit is often still referred to as the foot-pound (ft‚ãÖlbf), and sometimes more specified as \\"foot-pound of torque\\". Similarly, an inch-pound (or pound-inch) is the torque of one pound of force applied to one inch of distance from the pivot, and is equal to of a pound-foot.

Norman Bethune Inaugurated on March 23, 1976, Norman Bethune Square is named after Norman Bethune (1890‚Äì1939), a Canadian doctor from Montreal. Although he was born in Gravenhurst, Ontario and died in China, it was in Montreal than Norman Bethune resided the longest ‚Äî for eight years, from 1928 to 1936. It was during his stay in Montreal that he became a renowned thoracic surgeon, that his socialist ideas and convictions took shape, guiding him to a profound commitment towards social and humanitarian causes including joining the Communist Party of Canada. While living in the city, Bethune innovated a number of ground-breaking medical instruments against tuberculosis. During the Great Depression, Bethune worked with Lea Roback and others to open a public clinic for the unemployed and poor as party of his cross-Canada advocacy for socialized medicine or public health care. After joining the Communist Party of Canada, he traveled to Spain as part of the International Brigades where he created one of the first mobile blood transfusion services during the Spanish Civil War. Bethune returned to Montreal to campaign for Republican Spain before leaving for China. Between 1938‚Äì1939, on the eve of World War II, Bethune traveled with the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and he eventually contracted blood poisoning and died in China. The People's Republic of China offered the statue of Norman Bethune to the city of Montreal. Redesign At the time of the 70th anniversary of the Bethune's participation in the World War II in China, the City of Montreal undertook a major renovation project of the square at a cost of C$3 million.

Originally written by Kazumasa Hirai and illustrated by Hisashi Sakaguchi (ÂùÇÂè£Â∞ö), the series has been readapted with a more violent and mature setting in 2007 by Yoshiaki Tabata and Yuuki Yugo. This new adaptation, also known as Wolf Guy: ≈åkami no Monsh≈ç, has been released as twelve volumes by Akita Shoten. A live-action film adaptation, titled ≈åkami no Monsh≈ç was released in 1973.  Plot  Akira Inugami is a new exchange student at Hakutoku Middle School, but there is another side of him that is secret. He is a werewolf. Homeroom teacher Akiko Aoshika walking home drunk, suddenly trips and is saved by Akira Inugami who then proceeds to walk away. Ms. Aoshika sees that he is a student and pursues him only for Inugami to be jumped by his old school rivals. The gang attacks Inugami without mercy and seems to beat him to death, yet he keeps getting back up. They then hit him with a car and he appears dead. They begin to rifle through his pockets. Ms. Aoshika faints soon after witnessing it. The gang was ambushed by a large animal, which no one can seemingly make out what it is entirely. When Ms. Aoshika awakens, she finds the gang dead around her and is escorted to her school by the police only to find that Inugami is her new exchange student. Ms. Aoshika singles him out and inspects his body physically, but finds no wounds or scars to solidify the events that happened the night before. Both are discovered by Ryuuko Konuma. Soon after being introduced to her class, his classmates start to bully him, particularly the Kuroda twins. One of them falls into a coma after he accidentally but fatally stabbed himself while trying to attack him. Dou Haguro, son to a Yakuza, returns to school after hearing about Inugami's resistance to their gang and lures him out to be beaten on top of the school's roof. He then carves the word \\"mutt\\" on his back but after they leave, Inugami's wounds are healed. Ms. Aoshika later goes to visit him, unknowingly seeing his werewolf form, and then gets attacked by a man and then an escaped lion from a nearby zoo. Inugami saves her but lets the authorities find her instead. Inugami's pacifism against Haguro's gang starts to gain attention throughout the school, both among the students and the school staff. School President and Vice President, Shirou Kouda and Noriko Kimura, along with Ms. Aoshika urges Inugami to speak out against Haguro's gang. Inugami refuses to speak because he believes their cause is useless. Ms. Aoshika later meets reporter Jin who warns her to stay away from Inugami but she is already falling in love with her student. As revenge for the younger twin brother, Older twin Kuroda gathers gangsters under Haguro's name to kill Inugami. For this offense, Haguro severs his pinky. Having heard from a witness on television that Inugami's \\"mutt\\" wound is gone, he asks Chiba and Ryuuko to investigate. To push Kuroda even further, Haguro kills the comatose younger twin brother with the older twin brother's knowledge and then supplies him with guns and grenades to go after Inugami. During a school conference with media, Inugami has lectures the media along with students and staff as sheep. The school is then under attack by Kuroda who open fired on everyone before Inugami kills him with his own grenade. Despite winning, he is overcome with guilt for not being able to prevent the school shooting from happening. He is later stalked by Haguro but leaves to watch as Haguro is hunted down by other assassins. Once taking care of them, Inugami scares Haguro with his werewolf form, hoping that he would stay away. Haguro sees that the wound \\"mutt\\" is longer on his back, but Chiba reported otherwise. This only caused Haguro to have an epiphany instead. Days after students returned to school, Haguro creates another mass shooting, hoping to get Inugami's attention. He then confronts Chiba who lied about Inugami's scar and violently tortured him before leaving him for dead at a hospital. Inugami, who found him, offers his blood as transfusion but Chiba did not survive. Later, he is revived by Inugami's blood and chases after Haguro. A large fiery battle ensues at Bay Bridge where Chiba had metamorphosed into a deformed monster, but Haguro eventually kills him by decapitation. After winning this battle, Haguro's ego becomes inflated and he kidnaps Ryuuko as bait to lure Inugami to him. After being tortured, Ryuuko instead diverts his attention to kidnap Ms. Aoshika whom Inugami had fallen in love with. Inugami is later given a URL to access a webcam of Ms. Aoshika's violent rape by several men, one of them being Haguro. He becomes greatly conflicted as he tries to resist his love for his teacher, as well as his loss of power during the New Moon. Through Ms. Aoshika's coworker Tadokoro, Inugami tracks down Haguro's residence but finds that Ms. Aoshika's rape had been uploaded on the internet. He is then lured to an empty plaza where Haguro, via webcam, asks him to transform into a werewolf or another video of Ms. Aoshika's rape will be publicized again. He becomes frustrated but manages to telepathically talk to her, both of them confessing their love for each other. He later meets Ryuuko who forces him to have sex with her; when Inugami refuses, she stabs him multiple times before offering a location to an abandoned hotel. Once there, Inugami fights against a pack of dogs, men, and heavy artillery before he reaches Ms. Aoshika. He releases her but cannot escape Haguro who has become mentally unstable and starts to consume every severed piece of Inugami's body, hoping to become just like him. Inugami lays dying and powerless before the Full Moon appears and temporarily gives him power to transform and finally kills Haguro. The authorities later manages to save them with Jin's and Tadokoro's help but separated the two victims. Ms. Aoshika wakes up from a 3-day coma and learns that Inugami passed away. After several failed suicide attempts, she then requests to fly to Alaska to live with the wolves who raised Inugami. Two months later, Inugami is revived by his own immortality as a test subject but only has the memory of promising to bring Ms. Aoshika to Alaska. While in Alaska, Ms. Aoshika and her wolves could hear a distant howl and they howl back. (Note: This plot by Tabata and Yugo differs greatly from the original novel written by Kazumasa Hirai.)  Characters  ;Akira Inugami (Inugami Akira Áä¨Á•û Êòé) The main protagonist of the story. A Japanese-American exchange student enrolled where Akiko Aoshika works. He is constantly bullied and abused by gang members (whom he usually ends up killing or maiming). His parents were killed when he was young by hunters, mainly because of their werewolf lineage, and was raised by a pack of wolves he had befriended. He can metamorphose into a werewolf in his own will. He is quite powerful during full moons and is weak only during the days of new moons. He is shown to be quite intelligent in matters that concern him. It is said that the reason he is bullied so badly is that, as a werewolf, normal humans have a natural subconscious fear of him. However, it is also shown that the student council, who betrayed him following the shooting and caused him to leave school, are wracked with guilt over their actions following Inugami's \\"death\\". He leaves school following a shooting perpetrated by Haguro's lackey, blaming himself for the event. In the manga's closing chapter, Akira decides to stop taking the abuse of humans, seeing them all (with the exception of Akiko) as demons and beasts, and gleefully slaughters Haguro's men. He is taken to a private research center in Arizona after killing Haguro and is experimented on with apparently no hope of escape, but in the last few panels Akira breaks the bonds holding him, implying that he will eventually escape and reunite with Akiko in Alaska. ;Akiko Aoshika (Aoshika Akiko ÈùíÈπø Êô∂Â≠ê) The female protagonist in the story. She is a homeroom teacher who met Inugami prior to his introduction in her class. She was saved from being gang-raped at the first part of the manga by Akira Inugami; much to her surprise, Inugami is later transferred to her classroom. She was a victim of rape when she was young, and was divorced from her husband. She escapes to Alaska after the final battle with Haguro and begins to live with several werewolves hiding in the wild, waiting for Akira to find her. ;Dou Haguro (Haguro Dou ÁæΩÈªí Áç∞) He is the main antagonist in the manga. Son of the T≈çmei yakuza group, Haguro is also a genius with an extremely well-built body and superhuman reflexes. Though he initially comes off as emotionless and merciless, after a confrontation with Inugami's true form (and powers), Haguro loses his mind and becomes obsessed with Inugami and his complete destruction, to the point where he can only have sex with his girlfriend while thinking about Akira or carving the word \\"mutt\\" into his flesh. Indeed, in their short \\"fight\\", Haguro was helpless and felt very humiliated, he who was since birth considered a monster by everyone he met, finally came across a \\"real monster\\" with real superpowers. He then proceed on committing several horrible acts throughout the series, including two rapes and one of the highest death tolls of the cast. He can also be seen as a very gifted individual, who despite his character and crimes, give a good representation of both the best and the worst of humanity. He even stated that fighting the werewolf with \\"materialistic weapons\\" was a stupid idea, and that what was needed was spiritual strength, henceforth a samurai sword, with which he happens to be very prominent. Haguro holds complex feelings for Akira Inugami, both an innate hatred and strange love tainted with jealousy. For him, slaying Inugami is a responsibility towards humanity (since he may very well be the only human with strength and determination to oppose Inugami and the possible wave of disaster that would come from his blood), but also a way to return to being a monster. During their final fight, Haguro devours several of Akira's fingers, gaining a fraction of his power in the process, he also realizes that he wants to eat Akira so that they may \\"become one\\", finally accepting that he loves Akira. After Akira metamorphosed into a wolf with bright white fur (apparently created by his love for Akiko), Haguro instinctively hugs Inugami but by doing that, he impales himself with his own katana, which had been rammed through Akira's abdomen. He makes a final plea for Akira to become one with him, but he dies before hearing Akira's answer and is dragged to hell by the souls of those he killed. ;Akira Jin (Jin Akira) Known as \\"The Villainous Wolf\\" in the reporting field. Like Inugami, Jin is also a werewolf and born under a bad star. Jin is often seen as the logical and sympathetic mind, especially to Ms. Aoshika. He usually appears before her either to tell her a piece of Inugami's history or personality, or to warn her to leave Inugami alone. Towards the ending of the manga when Ms. Aoshika tried to commit suicide multiple times, Jin metamorphoses into a wolf to remind her of Inugami and to continue living. Ironically, not too much is known about him because he is unwillingly to share that part of himself and no one else knows about his past. ;Ryuuko Konuma (Konuma Ryuuko) Classmate of both Akira Inugami and Dou Haguro, she is Haguro's sex mate. At the time when she was sent to investigate Inugami's scar, Ryuuko admits to being raped when she was younger because she \\"knows her own kind\\" (hinting at knowing Ms. Aoshika was also raped). She often follows Haguro's commands because she is bored, but becoming intrigued by Inugami's loner behavior, she becomes lustful for him and often daydreams about eventually having sexual intercourse with him. When Haguro betrays her and intends to torture her to lure Inugami out, she gave him Ms. Aoshika. Ryuuko becomes wrathful and envious when she finds out Inugami will only have sex with her to save Ms. Aoshika. She stabs him multiple times and fled. Ryuuko is last seen having sex with an older gentleman where she stabs him to death. ;Yuusaku Chiba (Chiba Yuusaku) Dou Haguro's right-hand man and classmate. He and his brother lost their parents at a young age and grew up in extreme poverty until Haguro's father takes them after seeing their skills in mixed martial arts. Chiba admits to being very afraid of Haguro, comparing him to a lion after he witnessed him beating a professional boxer. Since then, he has been loyal to Haguro and his father. Chiba normally does not directly initiate or participate in physical altercations which would taint his reputation as a professional since he longs for a career in it. When Inugami refuses to fight him, Chiba admits that he is the second person to make him recognize his own weakness and quits boxing. Chiba suffered tremendously when he lied to Haguro that Inugami still bore the \\"mutt\\" scar. He was beatened: his body crushed, his tongue bitten off, and was raped to death by an emotionally-driven Haguro. Through Inugami's blood, he was revived and sought revenge against Haguro. A fiery battle ensued where he metamorphosed into a hideous monster and he was eventually decapitated by Haguro. ;Kuroda Twins Haguro's lackeys. The Kuroda twins suffer from inborn phimosis, which does not allow either of them to masturbate. When found out, the twins refuse to cower and instead targeted the girl who made fun of them the most and the boy who bullied them by cutting off their noses. When Inugami enters their class, the younger Kuroda twin threw the knife at the board as a form of hostile intent. When this was ineffective, he tries to stab Inugami and instead stabbed himself. This angered the older Kuroda twin who tried in several occasions to embarrass and humiliate Inugami but was overpowered each time. When he tried to use Haguro's name to draw support out to defeat Inugami, Chiba intercepts and the support dispersed. Kuroda is punished by having his finger crushed and then severed by Haguro. The older Kuroda twin finally succeeds in being able to masturbate when his anger explodes at Ryuuko for laughing at his suffering. With confidence, he heads to the hospital to tell his younger twin brother only to find that his brother died. He did not know that Haguro was the one who killed him. Haguro gives him a mass selection of weapons, which Kuroda heads to the school during a media presence event and starts a mass school shooting. He was killed by his own grenade when Inugami threw it back at him.

Tom Price, first introduced as H.R. 3400 in the 111th Congress. The bill was initially intended to be a Republican alternative to the America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 (H.R. 3200), but has since been positioned as a potential replacement to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The bill was introduced in the 112th Congress as H.R. 3000, and in the 113th Congress as H.R. 2300. As of October 2014, the bill has 58 cosponsors. An identical version of the bill has been introduced in the Senate by Senator John McCain as S. 1851 (113th Congress). Major provisions of the Act include tax deductions and credits to aid in the purchasing of health insurance, the promotion of state-based high-risk insurance pools, the creation of individual and small employer membership associations and association health plans, allowing for interstate insurance markets, a reform of malpractice lawsuits, and loan and loan repayment programs. The Act intends to fund itself through cuts to future spending increases, more commonly known as sequestration, and expected declines in the uninsured population. The Act's effects on the general public and the federal budget have yet to be assessed by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). Provisions Sections 1 through 3 before the first title contain the Act's short name, table of contents, repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), repeal of the health care-related provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and a statement that the Act does not possess a guaranteed issue and community rating mandate. Title I ‚Äì Tax Incentives for Maintaining Health Insurance Coverage Section 101 creates a refundable income tax credit of a maximum of the lesser of either the aggregate amount of money paid in premiums in a single taxable year or the sum of the monthly limitations for months that the taxpayer or the taxpayer's qualifying members are considered eligible. The monthly limitation is one- twelfth of the sum of $2,000 ($4,000 if filing a joint tax return) and $500 per dependent. A maximum of two dependents can be claimed and the credit adjusts to inflation annually. The tax credit can only be claimed if the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse and dependents have purchased a qualified health insurance plan. The credit can be claimed in full by taxpayers at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Above 200% of the FPL, the percentage of the credit that can be claimed decreases by 1 percentage point for each $1,000 earned over 200% of the FPL. Section 102 directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create a payment system to allow for the credit to be paid directly to the insurance provider to cover premium expenses in advance. Under Section 103, individuals who are otherwise eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, a state child health insurance program (SCHIP), TRICARE, veterans' benefits, federal employee health benefits (FEHBP), or a group health plan subsidized by the employer may choose to claim the aforementioned tax credit instead of receiving any benefits under such program. Section 104 creates an itemized tax deduction for individuals equal to the amount paid in premiums by the taxpayer for qualified health insurance in a taxable year, provided that the deduction does not exceed the average value of the national health exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance. Section 105 prohibits funds authorized from the Act, as well as tax credits and deductions in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), from being used to pay for any abortion or to pay for any part of the costs of health insurance plans that cover abortion procedures, excluding instances in which the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest, or if the life of the mother is endangered. Section 106 further prohibits the federal government from discriminating against any health care professional, health care facility, health care organization, or health insurance plan that does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions. This prohibition extends to state and local governments that receive federal financial assistance. Section 107 lifts the 25% excise tax on nonconforming group health plans, plans that don't meet all coverage requirements, and exempts these plans from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), if any employee can choose to have the employer or employee organization pay a contribution of a minimum of the contribution amount to any health insurance provider for coverage instead of receiving coverage under the group health plan, and if any coverage provided to a participant or beneficiary is treated as a group health plan under section 9801 of the IRC, which permits group health plans to exclude individuals with preexisting conditions under certain circumstances. This extends to the FEHBP, in which contributions to all plans are to be equal irrespective of which benefits plan an employee is enrolled in. Section 108 prohibits states from establishing laws that would prevent any employers that are allowed an exclusion of gross income, a deduction, or a tax credit for the federal income tax for health benefits from automatically enrolling employees in a group health plan, on the condition that employees are to be enrolled in the plan with the lowest premiums, and that employees are given the option to opt out of auto-enrollment for the employer-sponsored plan. Employers are to provide their employees with a 30-day period to elect to opt out, after which employees will be automatically enrolled. Section 109 creates a new small business health care tax credit to replace the one currently present in the PPACA. The number of employees in a \\"small business\\", for the purpose of this tax credit, would be increased from 25 to 50. The maximum tax credit allowed is revised to be equal to $1,500 more than the sum paid in premiums for an auto-enrolled plan by the taxpayer in all previous taxable years. The tax credit is to be a part of the general business credit. Section 110 makes a number of modifications to several health tax deductions. Capitated payments to physicians and pre-paid physician fees are to be considered medical expenses under the medical expense tax deduction. Individuals eligible for treatment in the Veteran and Indian health systems will not be considered covered under a health plan merely because they receive periodic medical care from the foregoing health care systems, and will thus not be considered eligible for the health savings account (HSA) tax deduction for that reason. Title II ‚Äì Health Insurance Pooling Mechanisms for Individuals Subtitle A ‚Äì Federal Grants for State Insurance Expenditures Section 201 authorizes $300 million to be split between the states annually as a grant for states to establish their own qualifying high-risk or reinsurance pool or other risk-adjustment mechanism used for the purpose of subsidizing the purchase of private health insurance. Qualifying high-risk pools must cover only high-risk populations, their spouses, and dependents, offer multiple competing health plan options, and offer at least one or more high-deductible plan in combination with a contribution to an HSA. Qualifying reinsurance pools and other risk-adjustment programs must cover only the same individuals as qualifying high-risk pools, but only on a prospective basis under which the insurer cedes the insured to the pool in exchange for a reinsurance premium. Bonus payments made available under this section can only be used for providing health insurance coverage to certain individuals with prior group coverage, a reduction in premium trends, actual premiums, or other cost- sharing requirements, any expansion of the pool of high-risk individuals, or for adopting the Model Health Plan for Uninsurable Individuals promoted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). Subtitle B ‚Äì Health Care Access and Availability Section 211 allows for the creation of \\"individual and small employer membership associations\\" (IMAs), associations that make health insurance available to members of the association through contracts with health insurers. Rates for health insurance plans are to be determined by the insurer, and plans offered to any member of the IMA must be available to all members of the IMA. The IMA and its members are not to be held financially liable for any potential losses by the insurer. There are no limits as to where an IMA may operate within the country or how many IMAs may operate in a single geographic area. Coverage in the plans offered to IMAs must comply with state consumer protection laws and can be through a health maintenance organization (HMO), in connection with a preferred provider organization or licensed provider-sponsored organization, indemnity coverage through an insurance company, in connection with a contribution to a medical savings (MSA) or flexible spending (FSA) account, through coverage that includes a point-of-service option, or through any combination of those types of coverage. State laws regulating any benefits requirements, or composition and structure of IMAs, not including requirements under Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act, shall not apply to IMAs. Any IMA may choose to have its own criteria for individuals or small employers to enter, and insurers contracting with any IMA may choose to have premium discounts, rebates, or modification of copayments or deductibles for members in return for adherence to health promotion and disease prevention programs. Subtitle C ‚Äì Small Business Health Fairness Subtitle C of Title II can be referred to as the Small Business Health Fairness Act. Most provisions of this subtitle are amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Under Section 226, the amendments present in this subtitle go into effect within one year after enactment. Group health plans and other arrangements that provide benefits to employees and employees' beneficiaries of participating employers, that have a minimum of 200 participating and contributing employers, and have been in existence for at least 10 years, are grandfathered into the law. Section 222 allows for the creation of \\"association health plans\\" (AHPs), group health insurance plans sponsored by trade, industry, business, or professional associations that function primarily for non-medical care purposes. Members of any AHP must pay regular dues and these payments cannot change based on any member's health status. All AHPs are required to be certified by the applicable authority, and membership cannot be restricted to individuals of any particular trade or industry. Plans must be operated a 3-year basis by a board of trustees, whose members are individuals selected by employers in the AHP from the employers' company, so long as they are active participants of the company, and their employment is not directly related to the plan, excluding if members of the association are providers of medical care. The board of trustees is tasked with approving applications for participation in the plan and administering day-to-day affairs of the plan. An AHP may terminate if the board of trustees notifies in writing to participants and beneficiaries at least 60 days before termination, a plan exists to timely pay all benefits under the plan to the termination date, and if that plan is submitted to the applicable authority. Each participating employer in an AHP must be a member of the sponsor association, the sponsor, or an affiliated member of the sponsor. All persons receiving coverage must either be active or retired owners of a company (including self-employed), officers, directors, or employees of the participating employer, or beneficiaries of any of those groups. Discrimination against employers and employees eligible to participate in a plan is prohibited. Contributions to the AHP must be nondiscriminatory regarding health status, but can vary based on the claims experience of the plan. The number of covered individuals in a plan must be a minimum of 1,000 if the benefits do not provide health insurance coverage. For benefit plans that provide health insurance coverage, the coverage is required to be distributed by licensed insurance agents. For AHPs that solely offer health insurance coverage, or provide additional non-coverage benefits, reserves are to be established and maintained. These reserves must be sufficient for unearned contributions, for benefit liabilities which have been incurred, have not been satisfied, for which risk of loss has not yet been transferred, for administrative costs with respect to such liabilities, for any other plan obligations, and for fluctuations and a margin of error. Each plan must establish and maintain excess/stop loss insurance, and indemnification insurance for any claims the plan is unable to satisfy because of plan termination. For coverage plans that have additional benefits, a minimum reserve surplus of $500,000 to $2,000,000 must be established. The applicable authority can permit the plan sponsor to substitute cash holdings with securities, guarantees, hold-harmless arrangements, or any other financial arrangement to fulfill the AHP's financial obligations on a timely basis. Within 90 days of the Act's enactment, a Solvency Standards Working Group is to be established to enforce the Act's solvency standards, consisting of at least one representative from NAIC, the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA), the state government, existing self-insured arrangements, the associations, and of group health plans. In its quarterly reports, if the board of trustees determines the plan to be failing to meet solvency standards, then the board must consult with a qualified health actuary to enact corrective measures. If these measures are not enacted or if the solvency of the plan remains questioned, and the applicable authority believes the plan to continue to fail to meet solvency standards, then the board of trustees, under direction of the applicable authority, shall terminate the plan and take actions to satisfy any claims, as necessary to ensure that the plan provides benefits in a timely manner to its participants and beneficiaries. The Secretary is permitted, upon approval by a US district court, to appoint to an AHP a trustee to ensure that the AHP remains solvent. To receive certification, an AHP will have to file an application, coupled with a $5,000 fee, to the applicable authority. The application must include relevant information pertaining to the identity of the plan sponsor and board of trustees, the states in which it wishes to conduct business, a summary of the plan being offered, copies of any agreements between the plan and contract administrators, and a financial report of the plan's reserves, contribution rates, current and projected assets, liabilities, income, and expenses under the plan, and any costs of coverage to be charged, including operating expenses. Certification will not be granted in any particular state if less than 25% of the AHP's participants and beneficiaries are located in that state. Changes to any information regarding an AHP in the application must be described to the applicable authority. AHPs that offer additional non-coverage benefits will be required to receive certification annually. In filing an application, the board of trustees is required to consult with a qualified health actuary, who is to use assumptions and techniques that best enable the actuary to determine if the plan's projections are reasonable. States are permitted to impose a tax on contributions to AHPs at a rate equal to the amount of premiums or contributions received by the plan from a participating employer. The tax cannot be discriminatory or exceed the state's tax rate imposed on premiums or contributions received by insurers or HMOs for coverage in a group health plan. The amount of the tax assessed on a plan is to be reduced by the amount of any tax or assessment otherwise imposed by the state on premiums, contributions, or both received by insurers or HMOs for health insurance coverage, aggregate or specific excess/stop loss insurance, or other medical care-related insurance. Section 223 modifies some definitions in ERISA. If benefits provided under an employer or employee organization are medical, then a \\"single employer\\" can be multiple employers under a single health insurance plan. This treatment only applies if greater than 75% of the employees and former employees of the employers are covered under the plan. Section 224 makes it a crime for any person to willfully misrepresent aspects of an AHP, including certification, to any employee, any employee's beneficiary, the Secretary, or any state government. Upon designation by the Secretary, if an AHP is not certified or operating in accordance with the laws of the Act, then a US district court can order the plan or arrangement to cease activities, excluding if all benefits offered are health insurance and the AHP is abiding by state laws not otherwise in conflict with the Act. Section 225 directs the Secretary to work in cooperation with state governments in the enforcement of the Act. The primary domicile state of an AHP that provides health insurance coverage is to be recognized as the state in which the filing and approval of a policy type under the plan was initially approved. For other AHPs, the primary domicile state will be treated as the state in which the largest share of participants and beneficiaries of a plan reside. Title III ‚Äì Interstate Market for Health Insurance Section 301 allows for the creation of interstate cooperatives between state governments, including the District of Columbia (D.C.), to sell individual health insurance. In these cooperatives, insurers can choose which state serves as the \\"primary\\" state, the state whose laws regulate the insurance provider. Coverage laws of \\"secondary\\" states, states that are not the primary state, do not apply to the insurer, excluding if the secondary state requires the insurer to pay nondiscriminatory state taxes, to register with the state Insurance Commissioner for legal purposes, to submit financial reports of the insurer's financial condition, to comply with court injunctions, to participate in any state insurance insolvency guarantee association, and to comply with state laws regarding fraud, abuse, and unfair claim settlement practices. Insurers are required to disclose to individuals in secondary states information regarding the insurer's primary and secondary states and are required to submit to primary and secondary state Insurance Commissioners a copy of the plan, including quarterly financial reports certified by an independent public accountant, and an opinion on loss and loss adjustment expense reserves made by a member of the AAA or a qualified loss reserve specialist. Insurers cannot provide individual health insurance in secondary states if the Insurance Commissioner of those states do not use a risk-based capital formula for determining capital and surplus requirements for insurers. Similar to the PPACA, insurers in these cooperatives are prohibited from, upon renewal of a plan, reclassifying or changing premiums for individuals if the health status of the individual changes, excluding if premiums are changed or discounted based on activities in a wellness program. Plans offered in the secondary state must also be available in the primary state. Any state in the cooperative can require insurance issuers to receive a license to practice in that state. Individuals cannot buy health insurance in a secondary state if the plan's premiums in the primary state exceed 10% of the national average premium. An independent review process of appealing denied claims must be created for individuals covered under individual health insurance in order for an insurer to provide coverage in a secondary state. Individuals on the review board must not have any familial, financial, professional, or other conflict of interest in the review process. Each individual must be a licensed physician who practices in the same field as the condition of the individual appealing the claim. In reviews relating to children, at least one reviewer must have expertise in pediatrics. Compensation provided by the insurer to the reviewer must be reasonable and not related to the reviewer's decision. Title IV ‚Äì Safety Net Reforms Sections 401, 402, and 403 require state governments to disclose how they intend to cover at least 90% of eligible low-income children in government health care programs and group health plans, and to offer more than one health plan in SCHIP. States are prohibited from providing coverage to children with family income above 300% of the FPL. For children in families above 200%, states cannot pay for coverage unless they are currently providing and will continue to provide coverage to at least 90% of eligible children below 200% of the FPL. These requirements extend to pregnant women. Consideration of individuals' and families' income must be based on their gross, or pre-tax, income. Excluding requirements under Section 2102 of the Social Security Act, minimum coverage requirements and limitations on beneficiary cost-sharing do not apply to these group plans. If the plans do not cover immunizations, well-baby and well-child care, dental care, or emergency services, then SCHIPs must provide these benefits as supplemental benefits. Premium payments to group plans in a single fiscal year are to be restricted to a maximum of the product of the national per capita premium expenditure for the previous fiscal year, the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) for the state in that fiscal year, and the number of low- income children or pregnant women receiving coverage. Children are not to be enrolled unless the child's parent or guardian has been informed of the coverage and are given at least one opportunity per fiscal year to switch coverage. State health plans are required to state how they will notify potential beneficiaries, to provide such notification during applications for enrollment, and post a description of coverage options on a public website. Proof of enrollment for low-income children in a group health plan is to be made every six months. The per capita dollar amount paid by the state to the plan provider is required to be at least 90% of the value of the benefits and must be uniform across all plans offered. Title V ‚Äì Lawsuit Abuse Reforms Section 501 instructs the HHS Secretary to issue \\"best practice\\" guidelines for medical care as part of a contract with a qualified consensus- building organization and in cooperation with physician specialty organizations. These guidelines are to be updated biennially and will be made publicly available over the internet. If a defendant in any health care lawsuit related to the treatment of an individual proves that the treatment was in compliance with the guidelines, then the defendant will not be held liable unless liability is otherwise demonstrated by the plaintiff. The guidelines cannot be introduced as evidence of negligence or deviation in standard any health care lawsuit unless previously introduced by the plaintiff. Health care providers will not be presumed negligent with respect to treatment if they are not in compliance with the guidelines. Section 502 allows for grants to be awarded to states for the development, implementation, and evaluation of administrative health care tribunals to resolve disputes concerning injuries allegedly caused by health care providers. Before going to the tribunal, lawsuits would first be reviewed by an expert panel of three to seven licensed health care professionals or physicians of the same or similar specialty with respect to the lawsuit, so long as the panel's members have no material, familial, financial, or professional relationship with a party involved in the dispute. In disputes involving children, at least one member of the panel will have expertise in pediatrics. If the parties present in a dispute before the expert panel accept the determination of the panel concerning liability and compensation, then the compensation will be paid to the claimant and the claimant will forego any further legal action against the health care providers involved. If there is no agreement, the dispute is referred to the administrative health care tribunal. States are required to ensure that tribunals are composed of special judges with health care expertise, that the judges have the authority to make binding rules in written decisions on standards of care, causation, compensation, and related issues, to establish gross negligence as the legal standard for the tribunal, allow for the admission of evidence, and to provide for an appeals process for tribunal decisions to be reviewed by a state court. If either party is unsatisfied with the tribunal's decision, the party will enjoy the right to file their claim in a state court, but in doing so forfeit any compensation received during the tribunal process. Under section 503, damages equaling or exceeding $50,000 in a health care lawsuit can be paid back periodically instead of in full. Title VI ‚Äì Wellness and Prevention Section 601 allows for premiums and cost-sharing in group health plans to vary by up to 50% of the value of the benefits of the plan based on participation, or lack thereof, in any standards-based wellness program. Title VII ‚Äì Transparency and Insurance Reform Measures Section 701 aims to increase transparency in the process of claiming health insurance. Within 30 days, insurers are required to provide to the party requesting a claims report the information regarding aggregate paid claims experience by month, total premiums paid by month, total number of covered employees on a monthly basis by coverage tier, total dollar amount currently pending, and a description and individual claims report for individuals whose total paid claims exceed $15,000 during the 12 months before the date of the report. Within 10 days of receiving the report from the insurer, the party receiving the report can request for additional claims information, to which the insurer must respond by the 15th day. Insurers are not allowed to disclose any health information protected under HIPAA or stricter federal or state laws, but must disclose to the plan sponsor or administrator that protected health information is being withheld and why it is being withheld. Insurers are not obligated to provide reports to any particular employer more than twice in a 12-month time period or to any employer with fewer than 50 employees. Title VIII ‚Äì Quality Section 801 prohibits HHS from using data collected from comparative effectiveness research or patient-centered outcomes research to deny coverage of an item or service under any federal health care program. These research methods conducted or financially supported by the federal government will have to account for differences in the treatment response and patients' treatment preferences, including patient-reported outcomes, genomics and personalized medicine, the unique needs of health disparity populations, and indirect patient benefits. Section 802 further directs the HHS Secretary to create a formalized process for the development of performance-based quality measures to apply to physician services under Medicare. Title VIX ‚Äì State Transparency Plan Portal Section 901 allows for state governments to contract with a private entity to establish a \\"Health Plan and Provider Portal\\" website to standardize and make publicly available information regarding purchasable health insurance in the state, including price and coverage information. Portals cannot directly enroll individuals in health insurance plans or under a state Medicaid or SCHIP plan. Insurers cannot offer health insurance plans through the portal if they were involved in the creation of the portal or have an ownership interest in the plan portal. Individuals employed by insurers cannot serve as a director or officer for the private entity creating the portal or for the portal itself. With the exception of not being able to enroll in plans, the Act's portals are functionally similar to the health insurance exchanges of the PPACA. Title X ‚Äì Patient Freedom of Choice Section 1001 rewrites section 1802 of the Social Security Act (section 5000A of the IRC) to allow for Medicare beneficiaries to contract with any health care professionals that provide care covered under the Medicare program. Participation in a contract would not automatically render the health care provider as a participating or non- participating provider under Medicare, so claim payments made to non- participating providers are to paid as if the provider is participating. Contracts are to include all terms of the contract and beneficiaries are not to be held liable for any payments made in excess of those outlined in the contract. By signing the contract, the beneficiary agrees to be responsible for payments to health care professionals for items and services agreed to under the contract, for submitting claims to the Secretary and supplemental insurance plans for items and services covered under Medicare, and acknowledges that no limits or other payment incentives that would otherwise apply under Medicare will apply to the amount charged or paid to a beneficiary for items and services. The contract cannot be entered into during a time in which the beneficiary is experiencing an emergency medical condition or urgent health care situation. Beneficiaries can choose to have, as part of the contract, a provision that would enable the health care professional to file claims and assign payments to the eligible professional on behalf of the beneficiary. Individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid would not have access to this section's contract. Section 1002 prohibits states, D.C., and the unincorporated organized territories of the United States from setting limits on the amount of charges for services provided by health care professionals. Section 1003 prohibits the HHS Secretary and states from requiring any health care provider to participate in any health plan as a condition of licensure in that state. Section 1004 creates an itemized tax deduction for certain physicians. Eligible physicians must be certified by the American Board of Emergency Medicine or another appropriate medical specialty board for the specialty in which the physician practices. The deduction can be claimed if the physician incurs debt as a result of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) service requirements in a hospital required to comply with EMTALA. The amount of the deduction is to be equal to the Medicare fee schedule amount that would be received if the service were provided under Medicare Part B. Section 1005 prohibits the HHS Secretary from preventing any enrollee, participant, or beneficiary of any health benefits plan, excluding for Medicaid and TRICARE, from entering into any contract or arrangement for health care with any health care provider. Title XI ‚Äì Incentives to Reduce Physician Shortages Like the PPACA, title XI contains provisions authorizing loan and loan repayment programs for certain medical students and physicians, intended to address shortages of primary care physicians. Subtitle A ‚Äì Federally Supported Student Loan Funds for Medical Students Section 1101 allows the federal government to provide student loans specifically to certain medical students. Eligible medical students must be attending a public or nonprofit school of medicine or osteopathic medicine. Students entering a residency training program other than primary health care are not eligible for loan funds. Additionally, loans can only be received if a student intends to practice medicine up to the date that the loan is repaid in full. The loan repayment period cannot begin earlier than the end-date of any internship, residency, or fellowship training program directly related to the field the student intends to enter. Subtitle B ‚Äì Loan Forgiveness for Primary Care Providers Section 1111 authorizes the HHS Secretary to create a loan repayment program, provided that the individuals receiving aid agree to serve a minimum of five years as a primary care provider, have a graduate degree in medicine, osteopathic medicine, or another health profession from an accredited institution, and have been working as a primary care provider for at least five years or for at least three years in a medically underserved community. The maximum allowable loan repayment is $50,000 per individual, which can be paid in up to a maximum of $10,000 installments. Title XII ‚Äì Quality Health Care Coalition Section 1201 exempts health care professionals who are negotiating the terms of contract of a health plan, under which the professionals provide care items or services for which benefits are provided under such plan, from antitrust laws. This exemption does not extend to health care professionals who are negotiating plans in Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, FEHBP, and the Veteran and Indian health systems. This exemption will not confer the right to participate in any collective cessation of services to patients not otherwise permitted under existing law. Title XIII ‚Äì Offsets Subtitle A ‚Äì Discretionary Spending Limits Section 1301 decreases some of the Gramm‚ÄìRudman‚ÄìHollings Balanced Budget Act's nominal spending caps on discretionary expenditures, reducing the allowable amount of discretionary, or non-mandatory, spending for the federal government. This spending reduction would, in effect, be an expansion of the Budget Control Act of 2011's sequestration. Subtitle B ‚Äì Savings from Health Care Efficiencies Sections 1311 and 1312 require the HHS Secretary to provide reports to Congress detailing decreased Medicare and Medicaid payments to disproportionate share hospitals (DSHs), hospitals that serve a large number of poor people, as a result of this Act's provisions, the latter of which is to be done in consultation with community-based health care networks that serve low-income beneficiaries. If the national uninsurance rate decreases by eight percentage points because of the Act, then Medicare DSH payments are to be adjusted to provide empirical justification for payment, including hospital characteristics. For fiscal years 2019 to 2021, respectively, Medicaid DSH payments are to be reduced by $1.5 billion, $2.5 billion, and $6 billion if this reduction occurs. States with lower uninsurance rates would see a larger percent reduction in DSH payments, however the cuts cannot be targeted at hospitals with large volumes of Medicaid inpatients or hospitals that have high levels of uncompensated care. The Secretary is to release a report in each January of the preceding year detailing DSH allotments to each state. DSHs are further defined to exclude any hospitals that discriminate against any patients for non-health related reasons, such as race or national origin. Subtitle C ‚Äì Fraud, Waste, and Abuse Section 1321 increases funding to the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program (HCFAC) to $300 million per fiscal year. Funding to the Office of the Inspector General of HHS is increased to $100 million per fiscal year. Section 1322 directs the HHS Secretary and HHS Inspector General (IG) to identify instances of Medicare failing to be a secondary payer to an individual's private health benefits. The Secretary is directed to create clearer guidelines for identifying and resolving credit imbalances in which Medicare payments exceed the providers' charges or allowable amount. Section 1323 requires the HHS Secretary to conduct a criminal and financial background check of providers and suppliers seeking to participate in Medicare. To cover the costs of this check, an application fee is imposed on providers and suppliers applying for participation in Medicare. Applications must include information regarding previous affiliations with enrolled entities that have uncollected debt due to Medicare or Medicaid. If the Secretary finds that these affiliations pose an undue risk to Medicare or Medicaid, then approval can be denied or safety mechanisms can be established. Knowingly making false statements to the Secretary will result in exclusion from the Medicare program and a fine. During an initial, provisional period, providers and suppliers are to be monitored under extra scrutiny. The Secretary can impose a moratorium on approval of an applicant of up to 30 days to prevent fraud. Section 1324 creates a database to include claims and payment data for all components of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A second database is to be created through the consolidation of existing databases consisting of individuals and entities excluded from Medicare and Medicaid. Any providers or suppliers of one state that are included in the database would be prohibited from participating in Medicare or Medicaid in another state. A third database recording all sanctions imposed on providers, suppliers, and related entities is to be created. The HHS IG is to have access to each of these databases. If any entity knowingly submits falsely information that serves as the basis for Medicare or Medicaid payments, then the Secretary can impose a fine of up to $50,000 for each erroneous submission. Critical reaction While the Act has not been assessed by the CBO, former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, in a review for the conservative American Action Network, estimated that the bill would yield a net savings of $2.3 trillion over ten years, and would increase the number of insured individuals by 29% by 2016. He writes that the bill \\"will lower premiums in all categories of insurance except high deductible health plans in 2016. But due to slowing of premium increases, high deductible health plans will be 6 percent cheaper by 2023\\" and that it \\"will yield substantially lower premiums than current law in all insurance product categories with savings up to 19 percent for single policies and up to 15.1 percent in savings for family policies\\". Writing in the Washington Post, Ezra Klein said that the bill had some good ideas but that it would not work. In particular he said \\"its version of the health insurance exchanges will collapse pretty quickly because the bill contains *no individual mandate ensuring that the pool includes both healthy and sick individuals *no insurance market regulations stopping insurers from cherrypicking *no risk adjustment rebalancing the scales when they do.\\" He said \\"In other words, this looks much like the reforms that collapsed in Texas, and in California. Price isn't learning from past policy mistakes, and so he means to repeat them.\\" The good elements, he said, were its proposal for automatic enrollment (of employees in employer health care schemes) and the extension of tax exemption on the purchase of private insurance by buyers in the individual insurance market currently enjoyed by the employed. These, however, would be capped at \\"the average value of the national health exclusion for Employer Sponsored Insurance (and not at the true cost). He pointed out that this tax exemption amounts to a huge tax increase, but said that \\"(Tom) Price won't call it that\\". Presumably this is because the exemption is not specifically tax funded but would increase the deficit and would have to be paid for from taxes eventually. The medical journalist Maggie Mahar has criticized the bill for the suggestion that people with pre-existing conditions should be moved into high risk pools run in each state. She points out that existing state-based high risk pools can‚Äôt provide affordable coverage for nearly enough of the medically needy who have no other option, and that others have noted how \\"high-risk pools have been around for over 30 years and currently exist in 35 states, but they only cover about 207,000 Americans. The biggest barrier to enrollment is cost. High-risk pools are inevitably expensive because all of the enrollees have medical conditions that could potentially result in costly medical bills, which means the pools cannot spread costs across low-risk and high-risk individuals. Despite attempts to cap premium rates, the coverage is still unaffordable for many. In fact, a recent study found that premiums for high-risk pools are unaffordable for about one-third of eligible individuals.\\" References External links *Empowering Patients First Act of 2009 *Empowering Patients First Act of 2011 *Empowering Patients First Act of 2013 Category:Proposed legislation of the 111th United States Congress Category:Healthcare reform legislation in the United States Category:United States proposed federal health legislation ","title":"Empowering Patients First Act"},{"id":"24441716","text":"Richard H. Cosgriff, Sr., (December 15, 1845 ‚Äì November 2, 1910) was a Union Army soldier in the American Civil War and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor. An Irish immigrant, his family eventually settled in Wisconsin, where he would spend most of the rest of his life. Enlisting in an Iowa cavalry regiment, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for capturing a Confederate battle flag during an engagement in the last month of the war. After returning to Wisconsin, he worked as a businessman in the lumber and printing industries until his death at age 64. Early years Born in County Cork, Ireland, Cosgriff's family immigrated to the United States when he was three years old, in 1849. The family lived in Dunkirk, New York, for six years before moving to Ohio in 1855 and then to Wisconsin two years later. In Wisconsin, Cosgriff worked as a printer and a log rafter. In 1861, he rafted down the Mississippi River to Davenport, Iowa, and enlisted in the Union Army on September 25. Exactly two months later, he was mustered into service as a private with Company L of the 4th Regiment Iowa Volunteer Cavalry. He reenlisted for another term of service on December 21, 1863. Military service One week after the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, which ended all major engagements of the war, Cosgriff's unit moved towards Columbus, Georgia. Their intention was to capture the city's supply depots, naval yards, and weapons factories. On Easter Sunday, April 16, 1865, the 4th Iowa Cavalry and other regiments attacked a bridge over the Chattahoochee River which led into Columbus. When the Union general, James H. Wilson, called for cavalrymen to charge the covered bridge and capture the soldiers guarding it, Cosgriff volunteered. He and the other volunteers rode past two lines of entrenchments and fought hand-to-hand with the bridge guard. During the struggle, Cosgriff knocked down a Confederate flag bearer with the butt of his rifle, capturing both the flag and the bearer. The cavalrymen successfully subdued the bridge guard and captured two heavy guns. For these actions, Cosgriff was awarded the Medal of Honor two months later, on June 17. His official Medal of Honor citation reads: \\"Capture of flag in a personal encounter with its bearer.\\" The flag, from an unknown regiment, is now held by the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia. Later life With the war ended, Cosgriff was mustered out of the Army on August 8, 1865, in Atlanta, Georgia. Returning to Wisconsin, he worked as a farmer and founded a lumber business in Hudson. In 1871, he married Mary A. Coldthrust and moved to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin; the couple later had five children. He farmed in Minnesota for a few years but moved back to Wisconsin in 1887. Back in Chippewa Falls, he was involved in several business ventures, including a printing company. He died at age 64 and was buried at Hope Cemetery in Chippewa Falls. His grave can be found in section II, row 1.

An amphibious helicopter is a helicopter that is intended to land on and take off from both land and water. Amphibious helicopters are used for a variety of specialized purposes including air-sea rescue, marine salvage and oceanography, in addition to other tasks that can be accomplished with any non-amphibious helicopter. An amphibious helicopter can be designed with a waterproof or water-resistant hull like a flying boat or it can be fitted with utility floats in the same manner as a floatplane.McGowan, 2005, pp. 68, 84, 160. Development Helicopters have taken a primary role in air-sea rescue since their introduction in the 1940s.Evans, 2003, p. 264. Helicopters can fly in rougher weather than fixed- wing aircraft, and they can deliver injured passengers directly to hospitals or other emergency facilities. A practical amphibious helicopter first appeared in 1941 and the water-landing feature soon proved its worth. Non- amphibious helicopters were required to hover above the scene of a water accident and utilize a hoist but amphibious helicopters were capable of setting down on the water to effect a rescue more directly.Ostrom, 2004, p. 186. Fitted floats In 1941, Igor Sikorsky fitted utility floats (also called pontoons) to the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300, making the first practical amphibious helicopter.Sikorsky.com Timeline.

Pontoons can be filled with air or they can be utilized for storage of fuel or supplies. In 1949, Sikorsky produced the H-5H with both wheels and pontoons.Fitzsimons, Bernard, general editor.

Boat hull design A Canadian Forces CH-124 Sea King shows its boat hull, sponsons and wheeled landing gear. The Sikorsky S-62 Seaguard was the first amphibious helicopter made with a flying boat hull‚Äîthe prototype flew in 1958.Patillo, 2001, p. 209. Utilizing many components of the earlier S-55, the S-62 proved the idea, and Sikorsky flew their S-61 Sea King prototype in 1959 for the U.S. Navy, a model intended for anti-submarine warfare.McGowan, 2005, p. 118. Both the S-62 and S-61 were ready for delivery in 1961. Sikorsky produced 1100 S-61s, including some that were not watertight: a longer cargo-carrying version was given rear doors and a ramp. Sikorsky licensed other manufacturers such as Agusta, Mitsubishi and Westland to produce variants of the S-61.McGowan, 2005, p. 119. Amphibious helicopters came into their own in the 1960s when robust boat- hulled designs were produced in quantity for military and civilian operators. Amphibious helicopters paid dividends for rescue personnel who enjoyed greater safety and success during operations. Overwater operations that used non- amphibious helicopters relied to a higher degree on hoists, rescue baskets, and rescue swimmers. Nevertheless, beginning in the 1970s, amphibious models were steadily replaced by helicopter models unable to land on water, because of high amphibious aircraft development costs. The last amphibious helicopter model used by the United States Coast Guard was the Sikorsky HH-3F Pelican, retired in 1994.Lurch, Bruno. United States Coast Guard. Coughlan Publishing, 2003, p. 17. Resting on the surface of the water with the rotor stopped, in conditions of brisk wind and mounting surface waves, a boat-hulled helicopter with stabilizing floats on either side is less likely to remain upright than a non-boat helicopter fitted with utility pontoons.The Aeronautical Journal, Volume 73, 1969, p. 708. Royal Aeronautical Society. Difficulty in lifting off can be encountered, especially when heavily loaded or in increasing seas. Polish Navy Mil Mi-14PL The Mil Mi-14 has the same boat hull design as its rival, the US made Sikorsky S-61R. The Canadian Forces developed a technique called water bird for landing their CH-124 Sea Kings in water. Limited water capability Helicopters can be designed to withstand limited contact with the surface of a body of water. The 1958 Vertol HUP-2 was an amphibious development of the twin-rotor Piasecki H-25 which strengthened its hull and replaced lower nose windows with tough aluminum.McGowan, 2005, p. 62. The HUP-2 was provided with a pair of stabilizing outrigger floats positioned amidships.

He was posted to No. 8 Squadron to serve as an observer/gunner in the B.E.2c two-seater reconnaissance aircraft and light bomber. On 29 June his pilot, Lieutenant Vaisey, was badly wounded in combat and lost consciousness; Pickthorn managed to fly them back to base while also sending a message in morse requesting medical aid be ready when they landed.Shores et.al. (1990), p.304. On 13 November he received a mention in despatches for his \\"distinguished and gallant services and devotion to duty\\" from Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief of the British Armies in France. Pickthorn then trained as a pilot, being appointed a flying officer on 31 October 1916, and was posted to No. 32 Squadron to fly the DH.2 single-seat fighter. His first aerial victory came on 27 January 1917 when he shared in the destruction of a Type C reconnaissance aircraft between Courcelles and Achiet with Captain James Robb, Lieutenants Frank Billinge, T. A. Gooch, C. G. Eccles, and Second Lieutenant H. D. Davies. On 26 February he drove down out of control a Type D aircraft over Bucquoy, and on 6 March he destroyed an Albatros D.I east of Bapaume, also being wounded. On 21 March 1917 Pickthorn was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. The same day he forced down an Albatros D.I bearing skull and crossbones insignia behind the British lines at Lagnicourt. The pilot attempted to evade capture, but was shot and wounded by Australian troops. He turned out to be Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, who died from his wounds two weeks later. Pickthorn was awarded the Military Cross which was gazetted on 26 April 1917. His citation read: :Second Lieutenant (Temporary Lieutenant) Charles Edward Murray Pickthorn, Army Service Corps, Special Reserve, and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in attacking hostile aircraft, and in carrying out difficult reconnaissances. On one occasion, although wounded, he continued his combat and brought down a hostile machine. On two other occasions he brought down hostile machines in flames.\\" Pickthorn received a regimental promotion to lieutenant in the Army Service Corps on 1 July 1917, and on 8 January 1918 he received a special appointment as a flight commander, though graded as a squadron commander, with the temporary rank of major. He was again appointed a temporary major on 30 April 1918. Pickthorn's aircraft F904 in flight in 2011. On 8 November 1918, Pickthorn took command of No. 84 Squadron. Two days later, flying a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a, serial number F904, he destroyed a Fokker D.VII east of Mutagne. The following day, 11 November, the armistice came into effect, ending the fighting. Pickthorn's S.E.5a eventually became part of the Shuttleworth Collection based at Old Warden Aerodrome, Bedfordshire, where it remains in flyable condition. Post- war career Pickthorn continued to command No. 84 Squadron as part of the British Forces of Occupation in Germany until 5 April 1919, and on 1 May 1919 he was transferred to the RAF's unemployed list. On 12 December 1919 Pickthorn was granted a short service commission in the RAF with the rank of flight lieutenant, but this was cancelled on 6 January 1920. He finally relinquished his commission in the Army Service Corps on 1 April 1920. From October 1920 Pickthorn was in Chile, serving as one of the flying instructors under Major Frank Pilkington Scott contracted to instruct fliers of the Servicio de Aviaci√≥n Militar en Chile (\\"Chilean Military Aviation Service\\") at the Escuela de Aviaci√≥n Militar (\\"Military Aviation School\\"), eventually returning to England in 1921. He was subsequently awarded the Chilean Medal of Merit (2nd class) in 1925. Pickthorn was commissioned as flying officer on probation (Class A) in the Reserve of Air Force Officers on 23 March 1926, and was confirmed in his rank on 23 September.

Anwar along with, Dato' Onn Jaafar, Tan Sri Mohamad Noah Omar, Haji Syed Alwi bin Syed Sheikh al-Hadi and Syed Abdul Kadir Mohamad formed the United Malays National Organisation to counter the Malayan Union that was undermining the Malay Sultans's powers and threatened the Malays of their rights as Bumiputera. Political career Anwar was credited with giving the United Malays Organisation (UMO) its name. Zainal Abidin Ahmad later on added the word \\"National\\" into the name and thus becoming the United Malays National Organisation. After the Second World War, the Malayan Union was formed by the British and it was strongly opposed by the Malays as the union threatened Malay sovereignty over Malaya. Anwar, along with Haji Syed Alwi bin Syed Sheikh al-Hadi and Syed Abdul Kadir Mohamad, went to Batu Pahat to meet the district officer, Dato' Onn Jaafar, who was a close friend of Anwar's. Together, they created the idea of forming a single party that would be strong enough to oppose the Malayan Union. They were later on joined by Mohamad Noah Omar who became the first Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat. After the meeting, Anwar became the representative to Johor Bahru to rally the Malays together to join the proposed idea of forming one party. Onn Jaafar at that time, together with the Malays from Batu Pahat, had formed, the Johor Peninsular Malay Movement. (Pergerakkan Melayu Semenanjung Johor). The movement had drawn many from Johorean towns such as Muar, Tangkak, Pontian and Kluang. Onn Jaafar then asked his fellow companions on what name should they give the party. Anwar suggested \\"United Malays Organisation\\" (UMO). Everyone agreed. On that night, Onn wrote a letter to Utusan Melayu that published the letter, announcing the formation of UMO and proposed congress with other Malay parties to join UMO. A series of Malay congresses were held, culminating in the formation of the nationalist party, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) on 11 May 1946 at the Third Malay Congress in Johor Bahru, with Datuk Onn Jaafar as its leader. When Dato' Onn Jaafar became Chief Minister of Johor on 1 June 1947, Anwar became his private secretary. As Onn could not maintain two roles as Chief Minister of Johor and President of UMNO, he resigned as chief minister in May 1950. The following year, Onn felt disgusted with what he considered UMNO's race communalist policies, and called for the party to be opened to all Malayans and have UMNO change its name to United Malayans National Organisation. When his recommendations were met with hostility, he left the party on 26 August 1951 along with Anwar and formed the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP). The party failed to gain support.

Weiland is a director and producer of television commercials in the UK, having made over 500 commercials, including a popular and long-running series for Walkers crisps. He has also directed several British television series, including Alas Smith and Jones (1989‚Äì1992) and Mr. Bean (1991‚Äì1992). His feature film credits include Made of Honor (2008), Sixty Six (2006), Blackadder: Back & Forth (1999), Roseanna's Grave (1997), City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold (1994) and Leonard Part 6 (1987). Early years Weiland grew up in the Southgate section of London, England and attended De Bohun's school. He left school at age 17 and worked as a messenger before becoming a copywriter. Career Television commercials Weiland began his directing career making British television commercials. Weiland has made more than 500 commercials. Weiland's most successful advertising campaign was a series of television commercials for Walkers crisps. The commercials have featured celebrities, including English football striker Gary Lineker, boxer Lennox Lewis and Victoria Beckham. The commercials became enormously popular in Britain, leading Weiland to then say, \\"A friend said to me the other day that they've become like little Woody Allen films ‚Äì people want to appear in them. Lennox Lewis obviously didn't need the money but felt that he wanted to be more approachable to the British public. He was interesting, did a good job, as did David Seaman and Victoria Beckham.\\" Weiland is the owner of The Paul Weiland Film Company and has become a multimillionaire with his work on television commercials. In the 1990s, his company won the top British TV Awards prize for five consecutive years. Leonard Part 6 In 1987, Weiland made his debut as a feature film director with Leonard Part 6, a comedy starring Bill Cosby as secret agent who is called out of retirement to save the world from an evil genius who has developed the ability to brainwash small animals into killing humans. The film was a critical and box office bomb. The Village Voice called it \\"the worst film of the decade.\\" The Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"'Leonard Part 6' is a smug, tedious exercise in self-indulgence ... There's virtually nothing to laugh at in this film, and too much of everything else.\\" The Times noted that, although Weiland was the director, \\"clearly Cosby, as star, producer and idea man, is the auteur here.\\" His direction of Leonard Part 6 resulted in Weiland's being nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director. Asked years later about his work on the film, Weiland recalled: > \\"It was a terrible mistake. ... When anyone gets into that position (Bill > Cosby's position of power in the 1980s), they are surrounded by sycophants > and no one tells them the truth. But Cosby just wasn't funny. I couldn't > tell him directly. I'd say it feels slow, and he'd say 'You worry about > construction, let me worry about funny'.\\" \\"Cosby attributed most of the movie's problems to first-time director Weiland, whom he felt was too young and inexperienced. Cosby himself was producer and writer of the story\\" ‚Äì New York Times (24 January 1988) Mr. Bean Between 1991 and 1992, Weiland directed several episodes of the Mr. Bean television series starring Rowan Atkinson. In 2005, The Times wrote: \\"The director Paul Weiland made millions laugh with the television comedy series Mr Bean and Alas Smith and Jones.\\" City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold In 1994, Weiland returned to feature films as the director of City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold starring Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, Jon Lovitz and Jack Palance. The film was a sequel to the popular 1991 film City Slickers. In the film, Billy Crystal's character discovers a treasure map and sets off with Lovitz and Stern to find the treasure of gold in the Arizona desert. Blackadder: Back & Forth In 2001, Weiland renewed his partnership with Rowan Atkinson, directing him in the British television film, Blackadder: Back & Forth. The film is a time travel comedy in which Atkinson's character, Lord Blackadder, travels in a time machine to the Jurassic period, Sherwood Forest, and the Battle of Waterloo. Miranda Richardson, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Colin Firth and Kate Moss also appear in the film. Weiland was nominated for a BAFTA TV Award for his direction of the film. Sixty-Six Weiland's 2006 feature film Sixty Six is an autobiographical comedy-drama based on Weiland's bar mitzvah which was held on the same night as England's win over West Germany in the 1966 FIFA World Cup final. As a result of the football match, guests cancelled en masse, and only a handful showed up at the bar mitzvah. The film received generally positive reviews. The Guardian of London wrote that, \\"Despite the whimsical voice-over and gloopy, sentimental tone, it's a hard film to dislike and boasts a wonderfully lugubrious performance from Eddie Marsan as the round-shouldered schlub of a dad.\\" Made of Honor Weiland also holds the distinction of directing the last screen appearance of Sydney Pollack in the 2008 feature Made of Honor. Awards Weiland has won a BAFTA Award for The Storyteller: The Three Ravens and an Emmy Award for Living with Dinosaurs. He also won the President's Award for Lifetime Achievement at the Design & Art Directors Association. In 1983, he was nominated British Academy Award for Best Short Film for his work in directing the short film Keep Off the Grass.

After an unsuccessful fight against the Communist takeover of Russia, he became an American citizen in 1928. His engineering skills were useful to both Sikorsky Aviation and to Seversky Aircraft Corporation from 1926 onwards. In 1942, he helped Walt Disney produce Victory Through Air Power to support the American war effort. Pishvanov's interest in aviation ended only with his death in New York City in 1964. Biography Before World War I Aleksandr Pishvanov was born in Novocherkassk, the Russian Empire on 21 October 1893, into a farm family of a dozen children.Franks et al 1997, pp. 211-212. His family raised horses for the Russian cavalry, and wheat. Young Aleksandr disliked both horses and farming, so he gained a degree as an engineer. Pishvanov became interested in aviation while studying engineering. After graduation,Durkota et al, pp. 95-97. he cadged a ride in an airplane in 1912. He subsequently trained as a pilot at the Odessa Aero Club, and was granted Aviator's Certificate No. 190 in October 1913.Kulikov 2013, pp. 90-92. World War I service Pishvanov enlisted just after hostilities broke out, and began World War I as a Nijnichin in the cavalry, serving through Summer 1915, and winning all four classes of the Cross of Saint George. He then transferred to aviation. In Autumn 1915, he began pilot's training at the Sevastopol Military Flying School. He completed training on the Farman F.22 pusher on 28 January 1916, and progressed to learning the Voisin pusher. He finished this training on 26 March 1916; he graduated from the school the next month as a noncommissioned officer. In early May 1916, he was posted to the 27th Corps Detachment as a pilot of two-seater reconnaissance aircraft. On 11 June, Pishvanov and his aerial observer used a Voisin to launch a pointblank attack on an enemy Albatros in the vicinity of Krevo-Kamenka at 2,000 meters altitude. Though the Albatros dropped out of range and was flown rapidly behind its own lines, the aerial victory went unconfirmed. Two months later, Pishvanov was sent to the Moscow Military Flying School for fighter conversion training to further develop his skills. He graduated qualified on Nieuports on 9 July. He was then posted on 7 August 1916 to the 10th Fighter Detachment near Volhynia at its commander's request, on the southwestern end of the Eastern Front. Assigned to fly Nieuport 9s armed with a Lewis gun, Pishvanov flew his first fighter sortie on 2 October 1916. In December, the 10th Fighter Detachment shifted to Galazi, Romania to fly guard over pontoon bridges over the Danube River, in an assignment that included no air-to-air combat. While attached to the 10th Fighter Detachment, he used a Nieuport 21 to shoot down five enemy planes between 21 March and 7 July 1917.Franks 2000, pp. 86-87. After downing enemy two-seaters in the vicinity of Gala»õi on both 21 and 28 March 1917, he was promoted to Ensign and awarded the Order of Saint Anne, Fourth Class. On 15 April, he staked another victory claim, but it was unverified. On one mission during the Summer of 1917, Smirnov had a vodka-saturated watermelon lashed to his Nieuport's outer wing strut. While taking a flight to cool it, he came under antiaircraft fire and took evasive action. The watermelon loosed itself and \\"bombed\\" the enemy trenches below. A report to the 10th Detachment from 10th Army noted: \\"Although the large bomb did not explode, it appears to have caused a great deal of confusion.\\" Pishvanov found himself in a hard-fought aerial battle on 26 June 1917. He fought several opponents to a standoff despite a machine gun that temporarily jammed after his first firing pass, then having hand grenades thrown at him. After seven attacks, he emerged the victor over a two-seater. He then received the Order of Saint Stanilas Third Class. On 4 July, he fought in five clashes along the Siret River. In the last one, he scored his fourth confirmed victory when he downed an Austro-Hungarian reconnaissance craft, Hansa-Brandenburg C.I serial number 68.54, over Endependance, having raked the two-seater with a surprise burst of bullets from less than 40 meters range. On the morning of the 7th, he finished his victory tally by shooting down an enemy two-seater over Latinul. He chased it down from 4,400 meters to 1,200 meters. Ignoring a leg wound inflicted by the observer's gunfire, he destroyed it with a pointblank burst. He was awarded the Order of Saint George Fourth Class and the Order of Saint Vladimir Fourth Class with Swords and Bow for this action. Also, on 9 July 1917, he was honored by the Supreme Commander in Chief's Order 599, which appointed Pishvanov a military pilot. On 11 July 1917, he was wounded in combat, losing two fingers from his right hand. Closing to his usual close range to fire, he was wounded while his gun jammed. Undaunted, Pishvanov cleared the jam and chased the enemy plane back to its own territory. He then returned to base, only to wreck his Nieuport, number N1890. On 5 September 1917, as a replacement for the craft in which he had scored all his victories, he was re- equipped with Nieuport 17 serial number N4191. He would fly this craft in September and October 1917. In December 1917, he was promoted to Poruchik. Also in December, in the wake of the October Revolution, Pishvanov would defect to his native Novocherkassk; there he joined the Volunteer Army of Generals Anton Denikin and Mikhail Alekseyev. Post World War I During the Summer of 1919, Pishvanov began to fly a Sopwith Camel in operations of the 6th Aviation Detachment against the Red Army; he was mentioned in orders by General Alexander Kutepov. However, as the Volunteer Army retreated as 1919 turned into 1920, the 6th Aviation Detachment was withdrawn to Grozny. To escape the surrounding Bolshevik forces, Pishvanov flew to newly independent Georgia and joined the Georgian Army. He also found employment with an automobile company. When the Red Army invasion of Georgia came in early 1921, he escaped through Iran to Great Britain. There he served for a time as a pilot instructor in the Royal Air Force. In 1926, Pishanov emigrated to the United States to work for Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation as an engineer. He became an American citizen in 1928. In 1931, he changed employment to work for his fellow Russian emigre, Alexander de Seversky, at Seversky Aircraft Corporation. In 1942, Pishvanov and Seversky joined Walt Disney in making Victory Through Air Power to support the American war effort.

(August 15, 1867, Oestrich, now a part of the city Erkelenz, Kingdom of Prussia ‚Äì February 23, 1908, Denver, Colorado, United States) was a Roman Catholic priest of the Franciscan Order. While assigned to St. Elisabeth of Hungary Church in Denver, Colorado, Father Heinrichs was fatally shot while distributing communion. The shooter, a Sicilian Anarchist, later described his motivations as hatred of Catholicism. Biography Joseph Heinrichs was born on August 15, 1867, in Oestrich, near Erkelenz, Rhineland, Germany. Under persecution from Otto von Bismarck's Kulturkampf, the Franciscan Chapter of St. Elizabeth of Hungary fled their monastery in Fulda and settled at St. Bonaventure's Friary in Paterson, New Jersey. Although still studying in minor seminary, Joseph Heinrichs emigrated to America with them. On December 4, 1886, Heinrichs entered the Franciscan novitiate at St. Bonaventure's and received the monastic name Brother Leo. He took his final vows on December 8, 1890, and was ordained to the priesthood on July 26, 1891.\\"Leo Heinrichs, OFM\\", Franciscan Friars, Holy Name Province Between 1891 and 1907, Father Leo served in various positions in the New York and New Jersey area including pastor at Holy Angels parish in Singac (Little Falls), New Jersey.

As pastor, Heinrichs would distribute food to the poor every morning at the friary gate.\\"History\\", Parish of St Elizabeth of Hungary He had received permission to return to Germany to visit his family after an absence of over twenty one years; but postponed his journey until after June 7, 1908, when he planned to give First Communion to a class of seventy children. A week before his death, he preached at the Young Ladies' Sodality meeting, remarking, ‚ÄúHow sweet it is to die at the feet of Mary.‚Äù Death The murder of Fr. Heinrichs, contemporary Illustration Heinrichs normally celebrated the 8am Sunday Mass, but on Sunday, February 23, 1908, as he had a meeting scheduled that day, he switched with Father Wulstan Workman to take the 6am \\"Workingmen's Mass. Among attending Mass was fifty-year-old Giuseppe Alia (aka Giuseppe Guaraccio and Angelo Gabriele),\\"Awful Crime of Anachist\\", Indicator, Volume 19, Number 4, February 29, 1908 an unemployed shoemakerNew York Times, February 24, 1908. who had recently emigrated from Avola, Sicily. Alia took Communion at altar rail then flung the Host at the priest and drew a revolver. Seeing the gun, the altar boy tried to warn the priest,but it was too late. Heinrichs attempted to retrieve the fallen host and collapsed mortally wounded on the step of the Altar of Our Lady, and died minutes later.\\"The Assassination of Father Leo Heinrichs\\", The Messenger, vol.XLIX, Fordham University, 1908, p. 415 Aftermath While attempting to flee, Alia was tripped by parishioner, E.J.

Off-duty Denver police officer Daniel Crefin (or Cronin) arrested Alia after a brief struggle on the church steps.\\"Priest is Killed at the Altar\\", San Francisco Call, Volume 103, Number 86, 24 February 1908 At the police station, Alia, who did not speak English,Radelet, Michael. \\"The History of the Death Penalty in Colorado\\", University Press of Colorado, 2017 reportedly said, \\"I went over there because I have a grudge against all priests in general. They are all against the workingman. I went to the communion rail because I could get a better shot. I did not care whether he was a German priest or any other kind of priest...I left Italy three months ago and went first to Central America, and then came to Denver. I am an Anarchist, and I am proud of it. I shot him, and my only regret is that I could not shoot the whole bunch of priests in the church.\\" In the face of rumored threats of summary justice, Denver law enforcement moved Alia to Colorado Springs for his own protection. Doctor Joseph Cuneo, former Italian consul in Denver, and the then consul Baron Gustavo Tosti, also a physician, testified that they thought Alia insane.\\"The Assassination of the Denver Priest\\", The Public: A Journal of Democracy, Volume 10, March 18, 1908, p. 1211 The prosecutions experts said he was not. Alia was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to be hanged. Alia never expressed any remorse and made two escape attempts from death row. The first involved the attempted murder of a prison trustee and the second of the prison's deputy warden. In both cases, however, Alia was overpowered by corrections officers soon after leaving his cell. Denver police officers expressed a belief, however, that local anarchists had smuggled the knives Alia had used into the Colorado State Penitentiary. Following Alia's first escape attempt, the Italian Consul, Baron Gustavo Tosti, was interviewed. The Baron expressed a belief that Alia's behavior proved him to be mentally deranged. Even so, the Baron declared, \\"I have no intention of appealing to the Italian Government, or of trying to make this an international affair. It is purely a local case.\\"New York Times, March 15, 1908. Despite the pleas of the Franciscan Order, Giuseppe Alia was hanged on July 15, 1908 at the Colorado State Penitentiary in Ca√±on City. The Washington Herald reported Alia's execution as follows, > He went to the gallows fighting, biting, and snarling. The night noises of > the penitentiary had died away, when Warden Cleghorn summoned the murderer > from his cell, and through an interpreter, told him that the hour of his > death had arrived. Alia stood for just a moment glaring at the warden and > the attendants. Then he raised his head, uttered a string of oaths, and > offered his best physical resistance to accompanying the guards to the > gallows. The murderer was held by the warden's assistants until he had > exhausted himself; then he was supported to the trap, where the noose was > adjusted and he was hanged.Washington Herald, July 16, 1908, Page 1. Legacy After a Solemn High Mass of Requiem in Denver, Heinrichs' body was transported by rail to St. Bonaventure's Monastery in Paterson, New Jersey. Thousands of people attended the wake and mass. He was buried in Totowa, New Jersey's Holy Sepulchre Roman Catholic Cemetery.All Creeds Honor Murdered Priest, New York Times, March 2, 1908 Alia admitted that he has been in Chicago, St. Louis and other eastern cities, but disclaimed any knowledge or connection with anarchists in any of these cities. No anarchist literature was found in his room. He gave different explanations for the attack. Michele Presutto notes that the murder occurred at a time of anti-anarchism and anti- Italian prejudice. Presutto attributes Alia's anti-clericalism to a rivalry between the Catholic and Waldensian churches in Sicily.Presutto, Michele. ‚ÄúFearless Before the Lord: Giuseppe Alia and Religious and Political Radicalism‚Äù, Journal for the Study of Radicalism, vol. 13, no. 2, 2019, pp. 45‚Äì64.

San Francisco In late 1988 or early 1989, with Stricker back in the fold, Major Lingo moved to San Francisco, where they remained for a year. While there, they recorded a live album at the Starry Plough entitled Wild Blue Yonder, which was released in 1989. By early 1990, Major Lingo returned to Arizona, leaving behind Tim Alexander, who decided to remain in the Bay Area and soon thereafter joined Primus. 1990-1995 The period 1990-1995 saw much turnover among Major Lingo's lineup. Tony Bruno and John Ziegler remained constants, but Sally Stricker left the band again, to be replaced on vocals by Christine Thomas. Doug Williams took over on bass, and was soon in turn replaced by Darryl Icard, while Steve Botterweg joined on drums. By 1993, Stricker had returned for her third stint in the band, replacing Thomas, and the band recorded the EP All Through My Body, which was their first release to be issued on CD. In June 1995, Icard left the band, and after a summerlong songwriting hiatus, Stricker once again took over bass duties. 1995-present Since 1995, the lineup for Major Lingo has remained stable, with Bruno on slide, Ziegler on vocals and guitar, Stricker on vocals and bass, and Botterweg on drums and vocals. In 2000, the band released Pagan Moon, their first album in seven years. In 2002, they celebrated their 20th anniversary with a show in Jerome's Spook Hall, which featured most of the former members of the band joining the current lineup in various configurations, and saw the release of their odds- and-ends album Lost and Found. In 2007, they did the same with their 25th anniversary show, which featured 10 of the 11 past and current members of the band, and saw the release of their live CD Arizona Highway Band. 2012 Retirement In August 2012, Major Lingo announced via their webpage that they will be retiring at the end of the year, after 30 years as a band: :Friends, fans, family - there is barely a distinction: For Lingo these three words have come to mean one and the same. Yet, the time has come. After 30 years of adventures in song, dance, and love, we're calling it a day. :You've had a magical, profound effect on our lives; you've promoted our growth as song writers and performers by embracing all we have had to offer, and, yes, your generosity helped keep the Lingo van on the highways & put food on our tables. Above all, your movement and release fed our souls like nothing could ever achieve. :Instead of one extravagant, big send-off, our scheduled gigs will be our farewell. Let's call it our Fall Finale. We hope to see you there, if not in body, then in spirit. :Blessings & salutations. May we always hear, see and feel the music. :With love, :Sally, Tony, Steve and John Official Major Lingo Website (Scanned August 27, 2012) Major Lingo played their final show at Spook Hall in Jerome, AZ, on December 22, 2012 before a packed house. Sound Major Lingo has an unusually eclectic sound. As the Verde News describes it: :The Lingo sound is a mixed bag of country, blues, rock, reggae, Celtic, Caribbean Calypso and South America Salsa. There are African rhythms, Japanese motifs, Scottish folk ballads and raucous New Jersey roadhouse rock. It's not at all unusual to hear Major Lingo perform a Scottish Folk ballad to an African beat or add a reggae twist to a Beatles standard.: Relix Magazine described the Lingo sound in 1988: :(A)n infectious brand of folk rock and ska with celtic influences that have been turning on a lot of folks with their long jams and extremely danceable sounds. Relix Magazine 's Bay Area Bits, September/October 1988 (scanned June 18, 2010) and 1989: :The band has quite a distinctive sound that's rather hard to categorize, but is best described as eclectic 80's rock. For the most part they have strong rhythmic elements, and most of the songs feature plenty of use of electronic effects and searing slide guitar work. :A sample tape of live and studio material proved to be highly interesting. In the traditional \\"Flora,\\" they mix folky vocal sounds with pulsating rhythms and biting slide guitar work. \\"Walk A Free Man,\\" is another rhythmic cut that again features some innovative slide work and an infectious beat. In fact, it reminds me a bit of Big Country. Relix Magazine 's Too New To Be Known, March/April 1989 (scanned June 18, 2010) A recent article in The AZ Edge describes Major Lingo's sound: :A typical Lingo concert could include a mixed bag of country and blues, rock and roll, Irish jigs and Scottish folk, reggae and ska, and African and Caribbean music. Regardless of the band's playlist, which they make up while on stage, they guarantee to suck the audience out of their seats and spit them out on the dance floor. And mentions the importance of Tony Bruno's slide to their sound: :Although the band plays an eclectic lineup of original and cover songs, which Ziegler said they \\"rehearse on stage,\\" he and Botterweg agree that it is Bruno's lap steel guitar that gives the band its signature sound. :\\"He can sound like Hendrix, or like he's playing bagpipes or a sitar,\\" Botterweg said. :\\"He's probably the best slide guitar player that no one has ever heard of,\\" Ziegler added. \\"He's always been the 'major' in Major Lingo.\\" The Arizona Edge, March 3, 2011 (scanned March 9, 2011) Discography Major Lingo *Major Lingo (1985) *Beat for Heads and Feet (1985) *Ride (1987) *Wild Blue Yonder (1989) *All Through My Body (1993) *Pagan Moon (2000) *Lost and Found (2002) *Arizona Highway Band (2007) Major Lingo's Discography Page (scanned September 22, 2009) Tony Bruno *Flinch (1998) *Numbat (1999) *The Shanghai Chicken Thief (2001) John Ziegler and Dave Rentz *One by One (2001) Johnny Lingo Trio *Spirit Room Spirit (2008) References External links *Major Lingo's website *Major Lingo's myspace *Major Lingo reviewed in Relix Magazine's 'Bay Area Bits,' May 1988 *Major Lingo mentioned in Relix Magazine's Too New To Be Known, March/April 1989 *Tim Alexander talks about his time in Major Lingo in a Phoenix New Times article from 1997 *2011 Article on Major Lingo in The Arizona Edge Category:Musical groups established in 1982 Category:Musical groups from Arizona Category:1982 establishments in Arizona ","title":"Major Lingo"},{"id":"24441978","text":"The Bill Ritchie Handicap is an Australian Turf Club Group 3 Thoroughbred open quality handicap horse race for horses three years old and older, over a distance of 1400 metres, held annually at Randwick Racecourse, Sydney, Australia in September.

The use of corporate jargon is criticised for its lack of clarity as well as for its tedium, making meaning and intention opaque and understanding difficult. It is also criticized for not only enabling delusional thoughts, but allowing them to be seen as an asset in the workplace. The tone is associated with managers of large corporations, business management consultants, and occasionally government. Reference to such jargon is typically derogatory, implying the use of long, complicated, or obscure words, abbreviations, euphemisms, and acronyms. For that reason some of its forms may be considered as an argot.\\"corporate argot\\" in The Jargon Jumble: Kids Have 'Skeds,' Colleagues, 'Needs', Wall Street Journal, 24 October 2006 Some of these words may be actually new inventions, designed purely to fit the specialized meaning of a situation or even to \\"spin\\" negative situations as positive situations, for example, in the practice of greenwashing. The use of corporate speak is considered an indication of neoliberal beliefs and practices. Although it is pervasive in the education field, its use has been criticized as reflecting a sinister view of students as commodities and schools as retail outlets. Marketing speak is a related label for wording styles used to promote a product or service to a wide audience by seeking to create the impression that the vendors of the service possess a high level of sophistication, skill, and technical knowledge. Such language is often used in marketing press releases, advertising copies, and prepared statements read by executives and politicians.  Examples  Many terms have straightforward meanings in other contexts (e.g., leverage in physics, picked up with a well-defined meaning in finance), but are used more loosely in business speak. For example, deliverable is used to refer to anything that has to be done by a certain date to be verified by another party. The phrases going forward or moving forward make a confident gesture towards the future, but are generally vague on timing, which usually means it can be removed from a sentence with little or no effect on its overall meaning. Legal terms such as \\"Chapter 11\\" can be used: for example, Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code is about US bankruptcy. Polish corporate speak contains many borrowed English acronyms, words, and usages. In one study, 79% of respondents admitted to using vulgar words in daily communication. Furthermore, 63% thought the word \\"fuck\\" was vulgar, while 32% thought it was neutral., see page 99  See also  * Buzzword bingo * Corporate communication * Corporate identity * Corporate propaganda * Headlinese * Journalese * Legalese * Military terminology * Officialese * Weasel word  References   Further reading  * , regarded as an authoritative guide to legal language, and aimed at the practicing lawyer. * Maria Fraddosio, New ELS: English for Law Students (Naples, Edizioni Giuridiche Simone, 2008) is a course book for Italian University Students. * BBCi (2006) \\"Workplace jargon isolates staff\\" * IVP (2006) Press release: Investors in People 15th Anniversary IVP * Reef Business Information (2006) \\"Managers unable to communicate with staff,\\" Personnel Today  External links  * Business Terms and Business Jargon explained * Corporate gibberish generator * Corporatepoems.com Corporate language rating * Business Buzzword Generator * Example of a generator of random plausible business-speak sentences * Jargon Grader Database of over 700 corporate jargon terms * Business English dictionary for corporate jargon Category:Business terms Category:English dialects Category:Language varieties and styles ","title":"Corporate jargon"},{"id":"24442014","text":"is a Japanese actress and voice actress who works for Tokyo Actor's Consumer's Cooperative Society.

Career Ross was born in Detroit, Michigan, and served in the U.S. Army during WWII. After his return to Detroit following his discharge from the Army, he began marketing television sets in anticipation of the post-war growth of television broadcasting. Later, he began marketing clothing and pharmaceuticals, expanding into various international businesses such as steel, petro chemicals, and electronics. In 1972, Time magazine dubbed Ross, \\"one of the new Marco Polos\\", referring to his far-flung business activities. He was one of the first entrepreneurs to begin doing business behind the Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe with the then- Communist countries of Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania. His export-import business eventually expanded to include the USSR and mainland China. Concerned about the shortage of physicians and believing that more medical school admissions were needed, he began the Ross University School of Medicine in 1978. In 2003, he sold the for-profit school to DeVry Education Group for $310 million. He subsequently founded the University of Medicine and Health Sciences on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts in 2007.

George Brumder (May 24, 1839 ‚Äì May 9, 1910) was a German-American newspaper publisher and businessman in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Born in Breuschwickersheim, Bas-Rhin, France., Brumder emigrated to the United States, settling in Milwaukee, where he produced several publications that served the city's (and the state's) German- American community.  Background and marriage  He was the fifteenth of sixteen children born to Georg and Christina Brumder. In 1857, at the age of 18, Brumder emigrated to Wisconsin with his older sister, Anna Maria, to attend her wedding to a Lutheran minister, Gottlieb Reim. George's first employment was clearing land near Helenville, Wisconsin, though shortly after arriving in the United States, he bade his sister and new brother-in-law farewell and set off on foot on a 45-mile journey to Milwaukee. He became a member of a crew that laid Milwaukee's first street car tracks and later became the foreman of the crew--a fact he remained proud of throughout his life.Bruce, William George. History of Milwaukee, city and county, Volume 2. Chicago: The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1922. Brumder soon joined Grace Lutheran Church in Milwaukee where he met his future wife, Henriette Brandhorst, a Prussian immigrant who was born in 1841 and arrived in America in 1869. The two were married on July 16, 1864 and they invested what little money they had in a small bookstore George had opened a few months earlier at 306 W. Water Street.A trade label for Geo. Brumder Bookseller Cover of a 1919 Almanac published by the George Brumder Company nine years after Brumder's death.  Branching into publishing  The bookstore flourished and the Brumders added a small printing department and book bindery and began publishing books for the Lutheran Church, especially the Wisconsin Synod. Around the same time, a group of prominent German immigrants formed the German Protestant Publishing Company and selected the name Germania for their name of their first publication, a weekly and daily newspaper. That venture ran into financial difficulty due to cost overruns and limited circulation and the group sought Brumder's assistance. Under his stewardship, the publication eventually thrived. Brumder bought out controlling interest in the company in 1874. In 1897, Brumder bought the Milwaukee daily Abend-Post and Sontags Journal and changed the name of Germania to Germania Abend-Post. Brumder acquired several other papers over the years including the Lincoln Freie Presse (1904) and the daily Milwaukee Herold (1906). Brumder eventually controlled most of Milwaukee's German language newspapers and also owned German papers in Chicago and Lincoln, Nebraska, as well as in several other Wisconsin towns. He was also president of the Germania National Bank (1903‚Äì1910) and of the Concordia Fire Insurance Company (1897‚Äì1909). Among other business ventures, Brumder briefly owned the American League Boston Red Sox from 1903 to 1904,Joslyn, Jay (April 16, 1981). during their first pennant win.  Germania Building  Germania BuildingIn 1896, Brumder built a new headquarters for his growing publishing empire at 135 W. Wells St. The 8-story Germania Building, as it was called, was designed by German-trained architects Schnetzky & Liebert and was, at the time of its construction, the largest office building in the city of Milwaukee. In 1918, the building's name was changed to the Brumder Building in response to anti-German sentiment during World War I but was changed back to the Germania Building after a significant renovation in 1981. 17 years after Brumder's 1910 death, the printing presses were removed from the basement levels of the building, giving the city its first underground parking garage.

Chief among them are the park's lakes and ponds, outcroppings of serpentine rocks, and Staten Island's largest living thing, a tulip tree. Clove Lakes Park is home to many species of indigenous wildlife. Visitors can see fish such as black crappie, brown bullhead, bluegill, emerald shiner, pumpkinseed, largemouth bass, and carp; birds such as red-tailed hawk, belted kingfisher, double-crested cormorant, red-winged blackbird, Canada goose, and mallard: as well as reptiles and amphibians, like the common snapping turtle, eastern painted turtle, red-eared slider, and occasionally even the red-backed salamander. The park is also home to mammals such as eastern gray squirrel, muskrat, eastern cottontail, and eastern chipmunk. Interstate 278, built in 1964, goes through the cleft inside the park, connecting the then-newly built Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to the east and the Goethals Bridge to the west. When first proposed, the expressway was to be named the Clove Lake Expressway. The park is known for its cozy picnic accommodations and boating.http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/CloveLakesPark/facilities/rowboats Besides strolling down trails and paddling on its bodies of water to appreciate its beauty, visitors can also experience the park as a more modern recreation zone. Several baseball diamonds, a soccer field, basketball court, playgrounds, and a football field dot the park's landscape. The Staten Island World War II Veteran's Memorial Ice Skating Rink is an outdoor rink located in what could be called the \\"active\\" part of the park, close to its other fields and courts.

Bir pletok, a genuine Betawinese drink produced using flavors, with ginger as the primary fixing. The presence of bir pletok was an answer of the Dutch expansionism that accompanied the majority of their traditions (counting their propensity to take a brew while having save times either at twelve or night). The nearby individuals of Betawi made their own particular home-made brew and without a doubt it wasn‚Äôt a liquor based drink since a large portion of Betawi individuals were known as an unwavering Moslem. The Betawinese named it bir in the wake of seeing the Dutch drink genuine brew. The run of the mill approach to serve it is by shaking it until the point when froth like that of brew is shaped before it‚Äôs filled a serving glass. A bamboo tube was the first bundling of bir pletok. As the fluid put away in the tube and some ice shapes blended with the fluid, the bamboo is shaken for 1-2 minutes, delivering the dull hints of ‚Äúpletak-pletok‚Äù.

Coronation grapes are popular throughout Canada, and are available during a short period in late summer and early fall. These grapes are characterized by their \\"vibrant blue-purple\\" colour, similar to the related Concord variety. Development Agriculture Canada's Pacific Agri-Food Research Centre in Summerland, British Columbia developed the Sovereign Coronation grape in the 1970s. This project was directed by Lyall Denby, as part of the Plant Breeding Program. The Coronation grape is a hybrid of two North American varieties: the black Patricia (not to be confused with the white Lady Patricia) and the Himrod. Agriculture Coronation grapes are a \\"fairly hardy variety\\" of grape and are most productive in relatively cool climates. The grapes ripen as early as late August, and are consequently available earlier than traditional varieties. Availability ranges from late August to early September in Ontario and early September to early October in British Columbia. In 2007, an estimated 2.2 million kilograms of Coronation grapes were produced in Ontario. Despite having only been introduced to the Niagara region in 2000, in 2008 they were the most abundantly grown seedless table grape in southern Ontario. Use in cuisine The flavour of the Coronation grape has been variously described as a \\"sweet-and-sour taste that bursts in the mouth\\", \\"sophisticated [and] deliciously sweet\\", a \\"mild sweet taste\\", \\"distinctive [and] musky\\", and \\"an odd, off taste\\". The grapes can be eaten fresh, or incorporated into fruit preserves, sauces and desserts. The raw grapes can be stored in a refrigerator for up to ten days, or frozen without loss of colour or flavour.

He also ruled four Burggrafschaften (a sort of Viscountships) in the County of Tyrol, the Duchy of Carinthia and in the Archbishopric of Salzburg. Virgil von Graben was a powerful advisor to count Leonhard of Gorizia and emperor Maximilian I.  Biography  Virgil von Graben was a descendant of the Von Graben von Stein family, who sprang out from the Meinhardiner dynasty, who ruled the County of G√∂rz, County of Tyrol and the Duchy of Carinthia. His father Andreas von Graben was his predecessor as Burggraf of Sommeregg, the refuge of the Von Graben family. His mother was Barbara Hallecker, daughter of J√∂rg Hallecker. Von Graben was lord, Burggraf (Von Graben was a sort of stadtholder) and \\"Pfandherr\\" of Lienz, Lengberg and Heinfels and Burggraf of Sommeregg.

The boardwalk is the main feature of a public park that stretches from Fort Wadsworth and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to Miller Field, both part of the Gateway National Recreation Area. The park also contains numerous recreational facilities, including a skate park. Originally, the Staten Island shorefront was occupied by multiple amusement parks, which had closed by the 1930s. Construction on the boardwalk started in 1935 and was complete by 1937. Amusements continued to occupy the boardwalk until the late 1950s, when water pollution and other changes started to repel potential visitors. The boardwalk was restored under a multi-million dollar project in the late 1990s. However, it is still relatively lightly used: in 2017, South Beach and Boardwalk saw 334,000 visitors, about 5% of the visitor count at Coney Island.  Description  The South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk stretches between Fort Wadsworth to the north and Miller Field to the south. According to the second edition of The Encyclopedia of New York City, , the South Beach Boardwalk is the fourth-longest boardwalk in the world. From north to south, it runs through the neighborhoods of Arrochar, South Beach, and Midland Beach. When built it was wide for its length, half that of the Riegelmann Boardwalk at Coney Island, located across the Lower New York Bay in Brooklyn. The FDR Boardwalk was made with concrete and timber and contains several pavilions, restrooms, and \\"comfort stations\\" along its length. A boulevard, now known as Father Capodanno Boulevard, was built on the landward side of the boardwalk. A \\"protected\\" bicycle lane, segregated from other traffic, stretches the length of the boardwalk. The South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk is very lightly used compared to other beaches in New York City. In 2017, South Beach and Boardwalk saw 334,000 visitors, compared to 2 million at Orchard Beach in the Bronx, 5 million at Rockaway Beach in Queens, and 6.7 million at Coney Island.  History   Predecessors  Undated postcard of South Beach Staten Island's East Shore was originally settled by the Dutch, who created the modern-day neighborhoods of Midland Beach and South Beach. Though summer homes were built along the beach in the mid-18th century, these areas remained rural until the later portion of the century. By 1882, businessmen realized that the area could be developed as a resort, and amusements such as theaters, hotels, bathing pavilions, and casinos were added along the shore. In particular, two amusement parks were developed on the site of the modern-day boardwalk: Happyland Amusement Park and Midland Beach. In 1884, opened the South Beach Branch of the Staten Island Railway, which in turn led to the Staten Island Ferry at St. George Terminal. As a result of its easy accessibility from Brooklyn and Manhattan, the resorts evolved into amusement places similar to Coney Island. The sites of the amusement areas are now occupied by the South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk. The Roller Boller Coaster (1907‚Äì1917) was one of several coasters to be built in South Beach By the mid-1880s, South Beach's amusement area consisted of a boardwalk, a beach, and numerous rides. After much of the area was destroyed by a fire in September 1896, the Happyland Amusement Park, an enclosed park with numerous attractions and landscape features, opened on June 30, 1906. Among the park's attractions were a beachfront of , a pier, a boardwalk, a system of over 10,000 lights, and numerous attractions and roller coasters. Midland Beach, located southwest of South Beach, became a resort by the 1890s when the South Beach Branch came to the area. It contained a pier jutting into the Atlantic Ocean, where visitors could catch the steamboat William Story to the Battery at the tip of Lower Manhattan. The pier was so long that the Midland Beach Railway Company operated a miniature railroad to take fishermen and other visitors to the end of the pier. Like South Beach, it offered theater performances, a beach, picnicking areas, snack kiosks, numerous hotels and bungalows, and several amusement attractions and roller coasters. The beach also contained a boardwalk. During World War I, air and water pollution quality and fears of German attacks discouraged tourists from coming to Staten Island. However, visitation rebounded after the war, and by 1923 Staten Island was seeing record-high numbers of visitors, including 150,000 on a single day in June 1923. The parks were mostly destroyed following a series of devastating fires in the 1920s. A 1919 fire in South Beach destroyed much of the amusement area there. A pair of fires also affected Midland Beach in 1924: the first severely reduced the ability of boats to travel to Midland Beach, while the second destroyed part of the amusement area. Both amusement areas were rebuilt, only for both to burn down in 1929. One remnant of the amusement area, the South Beach Amusement Park at the northern end of South Beach, continued to operate through the end of the 20th century, though much of that park was destroyed in 1955. Beachland Amusements, an adjacent amusement arcade, operated from 1941 to 2006 and was the last amusement attraction on the South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk.  Construction  Woodland Beach boardwalk and casino A law passed by the New York State Legislature in 1930 allocated $1 million for the construction of a beach and boardwalk at Staten Island, running between Fort Wadsworth and Miller Field. In 1934, the New York City Board of Estimate changed the city's zoning map so that the shorefront along South, Graham, Midland, and Woodland Beaches would be public land. Subsequently, Staten Island borough president Joseph A. Palma proposed constructing a boardwalk to connect South Beach and New Dorp. The 2.5-mile boardwalk was to cost $2 million and would be built by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Part of the cost would be funded by the Public Works Administration. The project was expected to raise real estate prices, similar to previous boardwalk projects in New York City. On August 11, 1935, officials held three groundbreaking ceremonies with more than 10,000 spectators combined, which marked the start of construction. Work on the boardwalk itself did not begin until a month later. Palma estimated that the work would employ up to 4,000 people. New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) commissioner Robert Moses criticized the boardwalk, saying that its development would encourage private developers to block access to the beach. The project was described as a mixture of Coney Island's Riegelmann Boardwalk and Jones Beach. The plans called for a beach to be built before the boardwalk, but construction did not progress in that exact sequence, which resulted in some parts of the boardwalk site being flooded at high tide. As a result, WPA employees sometimes worked 6-hour days and other times worked less than 4 hours in a day. Nevertheless, the boardwalk was built relatively quickly, and the first section between Fort Wadsworth and South Beach was nearly completed by the end of 1936. Twelve jetties and a parallel beach section had also been completed, though a section across New Creek in Midland Beach was progressing slowly. By June 1937, the entire boardwalk was essentially completed.  Opening and early years  Hoffman Island (left) and Swinburne Island (right) seen from the boardwalk An official opening ceremony was held on July 4, 1937, and was attended by 25,000 people. Upon its opening the boardwalk was named after U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt, who participated in the ceremonies remotely. That September, three hundred bathhouses on the newly completed boardwalk burned down. The United States Army announced plans for a pier at Lily Pond Avenue, at the northern end of the FDR Boardwalk, in 1940. The pier would support their activities on nearby Hoffman Island and Swinburne Island. A NYC Parks rule initially prevented wounded war veterans from using the South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk due to regulations preventing wheelchairs from using the boardwalk. As a result, in 1945 Palma arranged an agreement whereupon these veterans could instead use Midland Beach, which at the time was privately owned.  1950s renovation  Staten Island borough president Edward G. Baker and NYC Parks commissioner Moses proposed a redevelopment of the South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk in 1953. Baker and Moses stated that the redevelopment of the boardwalk would serve to improve the quality of Staten Island's East Shore in general, similar to how the Rockaway Boardwalk's construction had improved the Rockaways. At the time, 1.2 million people per year were visiting the beach and boardwalk. The $6.46 million redevelopment of Staten Island's East Shore beaches was commenced the following March, though the project was not approved until that May. Moses also proposed to charge 25 cents for parking and 10 cents to enter the boardwalk, drawing up to 2.4 million people within 30 years. The development included adding bathhouses; parking lots with spaces for 7,000 cars; several small bus terminals; comfort stations; and recreational facilities such as playgrounds, baseball fields, handball courts, roller hockey fields, skateparks, shuffleboard courts, bocce courts, and checkers tables. Some of fill were dredged from the Lower New York Bay to protect the adjacent uplands. Moses claimed that in the original project, the area inland of the boardwalk was too narrow to accommodate recreational facilities, but that the city now had the land on which to build these facilities. The project also included the construction of Seaside Boulevard parallel to the boardwalk (now Fr. Capodanno Boulevard), the first section of which opened in 1957. The first portion of the renovation was completed in 1958. When the project was entirely completed in the 1960s, it included three sections, the original South Beach as well as two new sections at Graham and Midland Beaches. The renovation was performed in conjunction with the planning of what would become the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which would provide Staten Island's first physical connection to the rest of New York City. Close to $1 million for additional improvements to the South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk was allocated in 1967, and additional funds were disbursed under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977.  Decline  Bike lane The boardwalk started to decline in the 1950s because of issues such as water pollution, caused by sewage outflows from Manhattan and New Jersey flowing into the bay. By the 1960s, even some lifeguards were refusing to swim in the water near the South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk. Another issue was the withdrawal of Staten Island Railway services from South Beach in the mid-1950s, basically isolating the boardwalk from all except residents of nearby areas. The 1970s saw several arson attempts as well as a high concentration of drug users and prostitutes. In 1971, the city studied replacing the city's boardwalks with plastic to make them easier to maintain, though this did not come to fruition. The beaches along the South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk remained polluted, and in 1983, New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin rated the boardwalk's quality as \\"poor\\" due to polluted waters and badly maintained boardwalks. At the time, the beach only saw 1,200 visitors on a busy day. In 1985, a small part of the South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk, as well as three other city beaches and Central Park's Sheep Meadow, were designated as \\"quiet zones\\" where loud radio-playing was prohibited. In the mid-1980s, the NYC Parks budget increased greatly, allowing the agency to renovate two ballfields at the boardwalk in 1986, as well as install new benches. Meanwhile, the water pollution near the boardwalk became so bad that the city stopped placing lifeguards in 1990. The beach and boardwalk continued to be affected by vandalism, pollution, and general neglect.  Revival  The beachfront received a major overhaul during the 1990s. In May 1994, following an accidental fire that destroyed of the boardwalk, then-borough president Guy Molinari announced that the damaged section of boardwalk would receive a $650,000 renovation. Several million dollars of funds were allocated for multiple related projects. These included the conversion of parking lots into South Beach Park, which opened in June 1996; reconstruction of the fire- damaged section of boardwalk; and renovation of a playground. NYC Parks also started looking for concessionaires for a pavilion at Sand Lane, which had previously been damaged in a fire. New recreation facilities for senior citizens and a program of concerts were also added. The renovation of the South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk came with a cleanup of the waterfront, as well as full funding for lifeguards, who started working at South Beach again in July 1997. The rebuilt boardwalk opened in October 1997. Other improvements to the boardwalk were made under the administration of Molinari and his successor, James Molinaro. The improvements included the addition of a Dolphin Fountain at the boardwalk's northern end and a veterans' monument called Freedom Circle at its southern end. New parking lots, a $1.8 million pavilion, and new lighting were also installed. The Ocean Breeze Fishing Pier, a steel and concrete recreational pier, opened in September 2003. At , it is the largest oceanfront recreational pier built in the New York metropolitan area in over a century. According to one estimate, some $20 million had been allocated to the improvement of South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk since 1995. The beaches continued to suffer from pollution. A New York City Council report in 2004 designated South Beach and Boardwalk as the dirtiest of the city's seven beaches. A separate, independent survey in 2007 rated South Beach as being \\"challenged\\", though Midland Beach was in much better condition. In a 2009 survey, South Beach's boardwalk, facilities, and beach had been rated as being poorly maintained, but by 2011, it was rated as the best-maintained beach in the city, in even better condition than Midland Beach. Wi-Fi service from AT&T; was enabled along the boardwalk in 2012, making it one of several Wi-Fi hotspots around the city. That October, the South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk was damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Over a period of nine months, portions of the boardwalk were gradually repaired and reopened, and NYC Parks workers from other boroughs were sent to Staten Island to repair the boardwalk quickly. One damaged portion of the boardwalk, an ADA-accessible ramp to the beach, was not repaired until 2018.  Features  Monument to Vincent Capadanno, at the corner of Sand Lane and Father Capodanno Boulevard  Recreational areas  The South Beach‚ÄìFranklin Delano Roosevelt Boardwalk is composed of two main beaches: South Beach to the north of Sea View Avenue and Midland Beach to the south. The beaches contain facilities for baseball, handball, shuffleboard, bocce, checkers, volleyball, and roller hockey, as well as the Ben Soto Skate Park and the Ocean Breeze Fishing Pier. The boardwalk contains eight baseball fields along its length: five adjacent to Midland Beach and three adjacent to South Beach. Two of the baseball fields in Midland Beach are also shared with a rugby pitch. There is also a basketball court near the south end of the boardwalk, at Greeley Avenue. The Detective Russel Timoshenko Soccer Field, named after a police officer killed in 2007, is located further north on the beach at Slater Boulevard. The northern end contains three bocce boards near Drury Avenue and two volleyball courts near Doty Avenue. Three children's playgrounds exist along the route of the boardwalk. From north to south, they are Playland at Sand Lane; Midland Playground at Graham Avenue; and Midland Beach Playground at Greeley Avenue.  Statues and monuments  Fountain of the Dolphins is a statue at South Beach by sculptor Steven Dickey. It was donated in 1998 by the Staten Island borough president and consists of six bronze depictions of dolphins, attached to poles with multicolored water jets. The Capodanno Memorial was named after Father Vincent R. Capodanno, a local resident who was a chaplain in the United States Navy and was killed in 1967 during the Vietnam War. A granite monument on the boardwalk was dedicated to him in 1976, and Seaside Boulevard was renamed after Capodanno the same year. Located at Sand Lane and Fr. Capodanno Boulevard, the memorial consists of a bronze and steel tablet recessed in a granite stele. The Midland Beach War Memorial is located near Fr. Capodanno Boulevard and Midland Avenue. It is composed of a three-paneled upright slab of Barre granite. An eagle figure is inscribed atop the pedestal. Ben Soto Skate Park The Ben Soto Skate Park is a skateboarding and BMX biking park located at the Midland Beach Playground. The skate park is composed of concrete and metal. It was opened in 2005 and named in honor of a local Marine who died four years prior. By 2010, the skate park had deteriorated and the soon-to-be U.S. Representative for Staten Island, Michael Grimm, had promised to fix it. Since being renovated in 2011, the skate park has been criticized by local skateboarders and bikers who state that it lacks a variety of traditional skatepark features such as ramps.

The film is based on the manga Cromartie High School by Eiji Nonaka which had also been previously adapted as an anime series. Plot synopsis The film opens with a black-and-white documentary-like section which recounts the checkered past of Cromartie High, built in 1920 and destroyed six times since then. Then on to the present day school full of violence and thugs, a school so desperate for students, they even enroll a gorilla and a bad-tempered robot. Takashi Kamiyama (played by Takamasa Suga), a top student, comes to the school to try to join his hapless friend Yamamoto (Tak Sakaguchi in a cameo role) but Yamamoto can't even pass the entrance exams for Cromartie so Kamiyama is left to go it alone. His efforts to improve the school include starting a Global Defense Force to protect earth from aliens. The aliens when they do arrive are space apes Gori (screenwriter Sh≈çichir≈ç Masumoto in a furry suit) and lla (both straight out of the 1971 TV series Spectreman) and the plot becomes a series of parodies of science fiction films, martial arts movies and high school comedies among others. Production Director Yamaguchi has said that the author of the original manga, Eiji Nonaka told him to \\"Do whatever you want\\" when he learned that a film was to be made of the manga. Yamaguchi took him at his word and did not read the manga or look at the anime version before directing his film. Because of the episodic nature of the original manga, the screenplay took a year and a half to write. The name of Cromartie High School was taken from the American baseball player Warren Cromartie who was a star player in Japan for a number of years. Cromartie was unhappy that his name was being used for a school of thugs and delinquents and in 2005 filed an injunction to delay the screening of the movie.

Reception Todd Brown at Twitch Film gave a very positive review calling the film \\"deliriously fun stuff\\" with a \\"fantastic visual style\\" and \\"jammed with bursts of stylish action, visual gags, film references and as much plain old oddity as Yamaguchi can possibly jam in there.\\" However, Josh Ralske at AllMovie was disappointed by director Yamaguchi's \\"haphazard approach to his source material\\" and lack of focus but does say the film \\"provides a few genuinely clever and amusing off-the-wall moments\\". Another reviewer is more positive but stresses that the film is mainly for devotees of the manga and anime series and that the uninitiated may be unimpressed. The review concludes: \\"As sophomoric and cheap-looking as it is, Sakigake! Cromartie High School is also good, clean, impenetrable fun. Just make sure that you're a fan\\". The reviewer for Mania gives the film a B‚àí rating but also maintains that it is mostly for fans and that it \\"needs some familiarity in order to really enjoy a lot of it. Another take is the review on CinemaEye which gives it 4 stars with the comment \\"CROMARTIE HIGH SCHOOL doesn't make sense whatsoever. That is the true charm of it. The team behind this knew exactly what they were doing. Extremely entertaining on every level if you just roll with it.

It is a brick building constructed in the mid-1930s, serving the 12020 ZIP Code, which covers the village and the surrounding areas of the Town of Ballston. Designed by Louis A. Simon, supervising architect of the Treasury Department, it uses an extremely restrained version of the Colonial Revival architectural style common on most post offices in small towns from that period. Only one other post office in New York is similar to it. In 1988 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The post office is located on the south side of Front Street at the corner of Milton Avenue (NY 50/67), Ballston Spa's main street. It is raised slightly above street grade and set back slightly, with some shrubbery in the front. Two large maple trees are at the corners. Across both Front and Milton are two- and three-story commercial buildings. On its west is a driveway leading to the loading dock in back. It is a one-story, five-by-seven-bay steel frame structure on a raised foundation with a vertical brick watercourse. A wing with the loading dock extends to the west from the rear. The brick is laid in common bond rising to a flat roof and parapet with stone coping. The north (front) facade is centered around the round-arched main entrance, with modern aluminum and glass doors framed by a carved wooden fanlight surmounted by a vertical brick archivolt and keystone. \\"BALLSTON SPA N.Y. 12020-9998\\" is written in black lettering above the door. The windows on the front and lobby sections (the front three bays) on the sides have splayed brick lintels, keystones and stone sills. A stone course goes around the building above the top of the entrance archivolt. \\"UNITED STATES POST OFFICE BALLSTON SPA, NEW YORK 12020\\" is spelled out in bronze lettering above the course. Two sets of stairs lead up from the sidewalk to a curved walk with the main entrance steps in the center. They are stone with iron railings. At the top a wheelchair ramp comes in from the west. The entrance is flanked by two original bracketed lanterns. The door opens onto a glazed metal vestibule with glazed wooden doors leading into the lobby, which has been altered since the post office was built from an L shape to strictly rectangular. It is floored in ceramic tile and has a coved plaster ceiling. An original wooden dado remains on the east and north walls. Wooden framing remains on the bulletin boards and the entrance to the postmaster's office has a wood surround with denticulated cornice. History Following its incorporation as a village in 1807, Ballston Spa's post office was located in several different buildings, including at one point the Sans Souci opera house almost across the street from the present location. Eventually, given its role as the Saratoga county seat, pressure grew for a permanent, dedicated postal facility in the village. Congress did not authorize one for Ballston Spa until 1931, as part of an early relief program at the outset of the Great Depression. Since it was necessary to acquire the land, on which four buildings stood, it took until 1935 before it was built by a New York City-based general contractor within Congress's $85,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) limit and opened. Treasury Department Supervising Architect Louis A. Simon was in charge of the design. Like many post offices in small towns built during that period, it was a brick Colonial Revival building, following Treasury policy. Simon's design is an unusually restrained version of that style, with minimal use of its decorative features, compared to other contemporary New York state post offices such as the one in Scotia. Only one other Simon-designed post office from that era, the one in Ilion, shows similar restraint, down to the flat roof. The interior was later altered slightly, with the L-shaped lobby converted into a merely rectangular one and the dado removed from two of the walls. The teller windows were replaced with modern ones and aluminum lockboxes added. Other than that there have been no significant additions to the building.

Facts and proceedings Mrs. IgnatƒÅne stood for Latvian local elections to be held in March, 1997, as a candidate of Movement of Social Justice and Equal Rights party. Since 1993, she had a valid language aptitude certificate issued by five experts and stating that she had level 3 proficiency (the highest level) in Latvian language. On 5 February 1997, a Latvian language examination of Mrs. IgnatƒÅne was carried out by one inspector. On 11 February, she was struck off the list by decision of the Riga Election Commission, on the basis of an opinion issued by the State Language Board (SLB) to the effect that she did not have the required proficiency in the official language. IgnatƒÅne's appeal was refused by Latvian courts. She filed a complaint before HRC, being represented by Tatjana ≈Ωdanoka. HRC views The Committee noted that, \\"in this case, the decision of a single inspector, taken a few days before the elections and contradicting a language aptitude certificate issued some years earlier, for an unlimited period, by a board of Latvian language specialists, was enough for the Election Commission to decide to strike the author off the list of candidates for the municipal elections. [..] the State party does not contest the validity of the certificate as it relates to the author's professional position, but argues on the basis of the results of the inspector's review in the matter of the author's eligibility. [..] the State party has not contested counsel's argument that Latvian law does not provide for separate levels of proficiency in the official language in order to stand for election, but applies the standards and certification used in other instances. [..] the first examination, in 1993, was conducted in accordance with formal requirements and was assessed by five experts, whereas the 1997 review was conducted in an ad hoc manner and assessed by a single individual\\" (para. 7.4.). Therefore, the Committee concluded that \\"the annulment of the author's candidacy pursuant to a review that was not based on objective criteria and which the State party has not demonstrated to be procedurally correct\\" violated article 25 (right to participate in public life) of ICCPR, in conjunction with article 2.

To date, students from Mainland China, Canada, South Korea, USA and many European countries had participated in our exchange programme. ETIH (Tourism and Hotel School) Tourism and Hotel School was initially established in 1982 and reported to the Macao Government Tourist Office. The school started with a small teaching body of 7 and offered 2 courses, namely, Reception and Housekeeping, at its temporary premises located next to the Pousada de Mong-H√°. In the following years, more courses were added to the list such as culinary, languages and tour guiding. In 1993, as a strategy to support tourism development, Macao government decided to create a higher education institute which would focus only on tourism education and training. A committee was established to carry out its preparation works, and 2 years later, in 1995, the Institute for Tourism Studies was born. At the same time, Tourism and Hotel School was integrated to the Institute. Today, THS is one of the schools of the Institute providing courses to a varied range of students who join us with different objectives. Many youngsters attend pre-vocational courses to learn more about the industry before making their own academic and career choices; others, join professional programmes to obtain essential knowledge before start looking for their first job or before setting up their own business; industry staff take assessments to have their skills certified and recognized internationally; some aggressive workers come to acquire more skills and high-level knowledge to further develop their career; some people simply join our courses to learn something different. With the aim of further developing the local workforce and to push it to a higher level, besides offering courses to the general public, the school also works with local industry partners and community associations, customizing courses according to their needs. Programmes are offered at elementary, intermediate and advanced levels in the following categories: Hospitality and Catering, Heritage and Tourism, Retail, Business and Management, IT and Creative Studies, Health, Spa and Beauty, Language and Culture and Personal Development.

As Purnia lay adjacent to East Pakistan many Muslims left to migrate there, and the inhabitants of the village renamed it Pakistan after the Muslims who had left. Prior to the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, the district of Purnia bordered East Pakistan; afterwards Islampur subdivision was awarded to West Bengal. Before leaving the Muslims had handed over their property to Hindus of the neighbouring areas. Relations between Pakistan and India have historically been turbulent. The events surrounding the partition of 1947 have involved millions of refugees fleeing in either direction to escape violence.

The dam is high, with a storage capacity of of water.  History  The dam was one of the first units built of the Trinity River Division of the Central Valley Project, a federal water project intended to provide irrigation water to the eponymous Central Valley. Construction started in August 1960 with clearing operations around the dam site, and excavations for the spillway and outlet tunnels began in October. By late 1961, over one-half of the dam embankment was complete. The dam was topped out on February 7, 1963, and the reservoir was allowed to begin filling. On September 28, it was dedicated by President John F. Kennedy to a crowd of more than 10,000 people. Water diverted from the Trinity River through the Clear Creek Tunnel is stored behind Whiskeytown Dam before it is released into the Sacramento River. The water is released to the Sacramento through lower Clear Creek and the Spring Creek Tunnel. The latter furnishes water to the 180 megawatt (MW) Spring Creek Powerplant, which generates about 274 million kilowatt hours (KWh) annually. The lake and dam are named after the Gold Rush camp of Whiskeytown, which was submerged in 1963 with the filling of the new reservoir.

The capital, Canberra, experienced the dust storm on 22 September, and on 23 September the storm reached Sydney and Brisbane. Some of the thousands of tons of dirt and soil lifted in the dust storm were dumped in Sydney Harbour and the Tasman Sea. On 23 September, the dust plume measured more than in width and in length and covered dozens of towns and cities in two states.Largest dust storms in 70 years cover Sydney The Daily Telegraph By 24 September, analysis using MODIS at NASA measured the distance from the northern edge at Cape York to the southern edge of the plume to be 3,450 km. While the cloud was visible from space, on the ground the intense red-orange colour and drop in temperature drew comparisons with nuclear winter, Armageddon, and the planet Mars. The dust storm was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as a \\"pretty incredible event\\" that was the worst in the state of New South Wales in nearly 70 years. The phenomenon was reported around the world. The Weather Channel's Richard Whitaker said: \\"This is unprecedented. We are seeing earth, wind and fire together\\". It was later referred to as \\"The mother of all dust storms.\\" Meteorological situation First storm Map of Australia and New Zealand showing the progress of the dust affected area and dust plume at various intervals According to the New South Wales regional director of the Bureau of Meteorology, Barry Hanstrum, the cause was an \\"intense north low- pressure area\\" which \\"picked up a lot of dust from the very dry interior of the continent\\". Senior forecaster Ewan Mitchel said winds from a cold front picked up dust from north-east South Australia on 22 September. That night the winds strengthened to 100 km per hour and collected more dust from areas in New South Wales that were drought affected. Air particle concentration levels reached 15,400 micrograms per cubic metre of air. Normal days register up to 20 micrograms and bushfires generate 500 micrograms. This concentration of dust broke records in many towns and cities. The CSIRO estimated that the storm carried some 16 million tonnes of dust from the deserts of Central Australia, and during the peak of the storm, the Australian continent was estimated to be losing 75,000 tonnes of dust per hour off the NSW coast north of Sydney.Leys, J., Heidenreich, S. and Case, M. 2009. DustWatch interim report 22‚Äì23 September. DustWatch is funded by the Lower Murray Darling, Lachlan, and Murray CMAs, the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water NSW and Griffith University. The dust storm coincided with other extreme weather conditions which affected the cities of Adelaide and Melbourne. The dust is believed to have originated from far-western New South Wales and north-east South Australia. This includes an area known as the 'Corner Country', a dry, remote area of far-western New South Wales. In South Australia the dust may also have come from Lake Eyre Basin or the Woomera area, the latter raising concerns that it was radioactive and dangerous since the area contains the Olympic Dam uranium mine. Second dust storm A second dust storm, originating in the same area but believed to be smaller, reached Broken Hill and Cobar by 10 pm on 25 September 2009. This storm arrived in Sydney between 4 and 5 am on 26 September 2009, it pushed the EPA Air Quality Index into the 'Poor to Hazardous' range. However this was not as intense and had cleared by mid morning. The storm reached Brisbane on the evening of 26 September 2009, with the haze expected to clear by 28 September 2009. On 29 November 2009, another minor dust storm occurred, which decreased visibility to 5 km over Sydney.Sydney swelters in record November heat by BOM Impacts New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory The first city to be affected was Broken Hill, which was 'blacked out' at about 3:30 pm on 22 September 2009. At least one mine was shut down. It was also witnessed in Cowra. The storm blew across Canberra and the surrounding region by midday on 23 September 2009, before being washed away by overnight rain, the heaviest rainfall over Canberra in months. It was reported that the dust set off smoke alarms across the state and prompted increased demand for emergency services. Asthma sufferers were hospitalised. Rain was also reported to have resulted, with cricket ball-sized hailstones falling. The dust storm also reached the north coast of NSW on the morning of 23 September 2009. Coffs Harbour was affected by 7 am. At Coffs Harbour Airport visibility was down to 500 metres by 9 am and the airport remained closed until 10:30am. Grafton and the Clarence Valley were affected by 8:30 am. It caused flight delays at Ballina airport and flight cancellations for most of the day at Lismore airport with visibility at 700 metres. A local school rugby union carnival was also called off. Sydney View of Sydney Harbour Bridge covered in dust. The storm caused severe disruption to international flights‚Äîseveral early morning Air New Zealand flights from Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington had to return to New Zealand after finding themselves unable to land at Sydney Airport. These flights were listed as cancelled and many others were rescheduled to a later time. 18 international flights were diverted to Melbourne Airport or Brisbane Airport, while six others were cancelled altogether. There were delays of six hours reported for overseas flights, whilst domestic flights experienced disruption of as much as three hours. Roads were disrupted, including the main tunnel of the M5 East Motorway which was shut down. Building sites were closed. Ferry services were cancelled. Canterbury Park Racecourse's scheduled day of horse racing was abandoned. Schools were disrupted as those children who attended were distracted by the dust storm, while many parents kept their children home. School trips and sports activities were cancelled for the day, and children were directed to stay inside during breaks in some schools. Face masks experienced surging sales in Sydney as concerned residents rushed to protect themselves against the dust, with at least one retailer indicating she had sold more than during the swine flu pandemic. Queensland Dust storm at Surfers Paradise, Queensland beach (looking south) Residents of Windorah in South West Queensland reported low visibility on the morning of 22 September. By 23 September visibility in Toowoomba and Ipswich in South East Queensland was reduced to . Brisbane was affected by the dust storm, although low visibility was less of a problem at Brisbane Airport than it was at Sydney. The Gold Coast was also affected by the dust storm by 11.30 am, reducing visibility to . Work stopped at construction sites due to health concerns, powerlines were down in some areas, the Q-deck was closed and traffic was slow with motorists using headlights. False fire alarms resulted in the evacuation of the Southport Magistrates Court. Flights were able to depart but incoming flights were diverted. The beaches remained open with added 'no swimming' flags in unpatrolled areas. Two fishermen off the coast of South Stradbroke Island were lost and a helicopter was required to locate them. The dust storm reached Central and North Queensland by the evening of 23 September 2009. However the effect was less serious, with visibility between 50 and 7,000 metres. Commercial flights were not disrupted. Affected areas include Townsville, Blackwater, Rockhampton, Mackay, Cairns and the Gulf of Carpentaria (Normanton and Kowanyama). New Zealand Red dust from the storm reached New Zealand on the morning of 25 September 2009, behind a weather front that brought cold temperatures to the North Island. It was observed by satellite, atmospheric monitoring equipment (a beta attenuation monitor) at Auckland International Airport and by dust settling on the ground. Dust settled across Auckland as well as in the Northland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Taranaki districts of the North Island and it also reached the South Island's West Coast. Culture Roger Deakins, cinematographer of the film Blade Runner 2049, has stated that images of the dust storm in Sydney directly inspired the film's Las Vegas scenes. > With Las Vegas, Denis wanted it to have the red dust.

Leonard left school to work for a building contractor, which he left to avoid being fired, so became a full-time musician. The Corncrackers ran their own club, the \\"L\\" Club, featuring themselves and other local musicians, whilst also playing support to acts such as Johnny Kidd & The Pirates and The Hollies at a rival venue. When Rees left they continued as a trio; Keith Hodge then replaced Griffiths, but when Reynolds left to join the South Wales band The Jets, The Corncrackers broke up.Manband Archive history of The Jets Retrieved 14 October 2009 Leonard also joined The Jets, on keyboards, but preferred playing guitar, so reformed The Corncrackers with additional guitarist Brian Breeze, before replacing Vic Oakley as bass player in The Blackjacks, with whom he toured US bases in Europe. On his return, he rejoined The Jets, with Tony \\"Plum\\" Hollis on vocals, Martin Ace (bass) and Beau Adams (drums). There were other bands named The Jets on the circuit, so they changed their name to The Smokeless Zone and took residencies in Germany, including one at Hamburg's Top Ten Club where Tony Sheridan played with them. Adams was replaced by Terry Williams, but after more European residencies, they disbanded. When Breeze left the Corncrackers, Leonard rejoined, playing London residences and recording demos for EMI & CBS. When Hodge left, Terry Williams joined on drums and Martin Ace as a multi-instrumentalist. The band changed its style to psychedelia and its name to Dream; not sure what a \\"freak-out\\" was, they invented their own with shaving foam and confetti. In November 1968, Leonard joined The Bystanders, to replace Vic Oakley (again), just as the band changed their musical direction, from close harmony pop to a psychedelic/American west coast style, and their name to Man. Man Leonard initially stayed with Man until they were mixing their second album 2 Ozs of Plastic with a Hole in the Middle, then left to join his wife in Llanelli. He became productivity manager in a piano factory, but quit after supporting a wild-cat strike, and was accepted back into the band, whilst Man's original bass player and drummer were replaced by Leonard's former Dream colleagues, Martin Ace and Terry Williams.

He stayed until Man disbanded in December 1976, playing on all the albums from Rhinos, Winos, and Lunatics to All's Well That Ends Well. Iceberg again When Man disbanded, Leonard still had a solo record contract, so recorded Before Your Very Eyes, with Martin Ace, Terry Williams and others. Produced by Martin Rushent, the album release was delayed for five years, when EMI took over United Artists. He briefly played with Sean Tyla (ex-Ducks Deluxe) in the Tyla Gang, appearing on their 1977 album Yachtless, then reformed Iceberg, initially with Lincoln Carr (bass) and Terry Williams.

Man reform In 1983 Leonard disbanded Iceberg again, to join the reforming Man, playing with them until 1996, when he suffered a minor stroke. Man played as a trio until he recovered, and rejoined them in 1997. In 2002 Leonard issued Unfinished Business a CD of demos, rejects and out-takes. Later that year Micky Jones had several operations on a brain tumour, but in 2004, when Jones had recovered enough to rejoin, Leonard decided to leave Man again. Later Icebergs In 2004, Leonard formed another Iceberg, with former Man bassist Will Youatt, guitarist Clive \\"Snob\\" Roberts and Bob Richards (who continued drumming with Man). Roberts was diagnosed with lung cancer after their first gig, and died shortly after, being replaced by Brian Breeze, who was in turn replaced by Ray \\"Taff\\" Williams (not Ray Williams, the original Man bass player, who died in 1993). In 2004, Leonard also recorded a solo album Freedom and Chains, the studio time being sponsored by 56 \\"Angels\\" who are credited in the sleeve-notes; and in 2005, a collection of Iceberg recordings for 1970s radio shows, including John Peel, was released as Wireless. As of 2012 Iceberg were still performing, with Will Youatt (bass), Bob Richards (drums) and James Beck (guitar) backing Leonard. Writer and raconteur Leonard started his writing career with sleeve notes for the 1970s Man albums. After Man disbanded he wrote articles and reviews for Vox, Studio Week and other music magazines. His first autobiographical book Rhinos, Winos & Lunatics (1996) had limited sales, but his second book Maybe I Should've Stayed in Bed? (2000) received good reviews, prompting a second edition of the first book, which has since been translated into German. In 2003, The Fiction Factory acquired the film rights to both books. Leonard read extracts from the books for a series of BBC radio programmes It's Crazy Man which won \\"Best Radio Documentary\\" at the 2006 Celtic Film and Television Festival and were nominated for a Sony Radio Academy \\"Special Music Award\\" in 2006.Sony Music Awards 2006 Retrieved 30 September 2009 He has also toured a one-man show, retelling selections of his rock'n'roll anecdotes, interspersed with songs, and has regularly appeared at the Dylan Thomas Literary Weekend in Laugharne.

She lives and works in Kuopio, Finland.  Education  H√§nninen has studied at Lahti Institute of Design in Finland in 1994-1998 and Hochscule f√ºr Kunst und Gestaltung in Z√ºrich in 1997‚Äì1998. She became Master of Arts (Photography) from University of Art and Design (UIAH) in Helsinki in 2002. She is part of The Helsinki School.http://www.nannahanninen.com Nanna H√§nninen's Official Webpage, September 2009  Style and work  H√§nninen's works has been shown in several solo and group exhibitions. Many of her works are placed of national and international public collections as well as private ones. H√§nninen has made two commissioned public artworks. Walks from Dusk till Dawn to Centralposthus Bl√•mannen (The National Property Board of Sweden) in Stockholm, Sweden (2008) and Jungle and Powerplant of Kuopio: version in Red to Kuopio employment agency in Kuopio, State Art Collections, Finland (2009). She has published also two artist monographs: Fear and Security (Forlaget Bjerggaard, 2003) and Recordings (Kojodi press, 2007). Mental and social structures as well as experiencing the culture are the basic themes of H√§nninen's work. Her interest in photography is the tension between rational and irrational subjects and ideas or reality and fiction, which is given by photography itself. Even if some images and themes seem unreal or chosen randomly the photograph makes to keep relationships with the reality.  Series  Fear and security Fear and Security tells about the fear of losing control. When photographing more objects, instead of order, she started to see the idea of chaos in things. That became a series of pictures called Fear and Security. H√§nninen says that \\"There is a great paradox because by setting up security measures you cause insecurity of something\\". In these images H√§nninen has been trying to catch the idea of the society, which is filing, sorting and systemizing things to be more secure and organized. \\"Her work titles- Fear and Security, Keep Under Control, Information Failure- reinforce the idea that these stage-set-like, micro-theatrical scenes are visualized thought, visual aphorisms, emblematic abstractions. In a model-like manner they represent thoughts about the world, about tensions, opposition, overload, sources of error.\\" Introduction to Exhibition Order & Chaos, An Essay \\"The Imaging of Thought and Experience In the Work of Nanna H√§nninen\\" by Urs Stahel, Fotomuseum Winterthur, 2003. Psychological and mental mechanisms of the society as well as the 9/11 incident in New York City are the starting point of the series. The theme is still very current. Aesthetically these works are very simple and silent, even minimalistic. The New Landscapes In the series New Landscapes the photographs are taken from famous metropolises, buildings, factories, cemeteries, airports, towers - mostly strategically important places involving a mixture of lights in the scenery and a long exposure so that they become almost like short movies. These urban landscapes are basically drawings of body movements that can be seen on photographic material as rhythmical light lines where subject and the scenery melt into a single image. Pictorial motifs are divided into different surfaces; the abstraction and pictorial surface, into the human presence (breathing, heartbeat, laughter, talking, walking during the exposure time) and into the photography as media which in this case is moving closer a painting. The subject is still strongly presented, whereas the object - the scenery- is estranged and thus becomes easier to deal with. The works are often named geographically: Basel, New York's Brooklyn Bridge, the airport of Ponta Delgata, the port of Helsinki, the A5 autobahn. The New Landscapes follows H√§nninen's sociological interest towards individual who is sensing, understanding and placing herself in the outside world. The figurative language; minimalism and the reduction of information is more a visual method, which have references to symbolic or linguistic meanings (emptiness, infinity) but also it can be seen as an art historical references to modernist painting. As a result of all these pictures become concentrated narrations of recognition and moment as well as large colour abstractions that have profound significance of the surrounding reality. \\"Nanna H√§nninen documents with seismographic precision, the interplay between the movements of the real world before her eyes and her own world, her movements, her breathing and laughter, her hesitation. What we find here are highly abstract photographs with semi-translucent, intangible backgrounds and sketchy undulating movements, with lines contracting, expanding and entangling, with fields and clusters of color.\\" Nanna H√§nninen, recordings: An Essay \\"Experiences Enhance Thoughts\\" by Urs Stahel. Kodoji Press, 2007. The photographs have been re-worked by computer. Asymmetric Exposure Asymmetric Exposures is H√§nninen's series about her admiration of the skyscraper's as well as understanding of the fragility of those and common peace agreements in the society. The incident in New York on 9/11 is still influencing her work and this that can be seen in all her works through 2000-2009 either with direct research of it or by denial. Nanna H√§nninen is not only documenting the world as it is but also transforming the truth. \\"Nanna H√§nninen incorporates her own emotions and ideas about the Twin Towers attack in her interpretation of this milestone in modern history. The skyscraper thus becomes an image of the fragility of our civilisation and its fundamental lack of stability.\\" Exhibition Catalogue: Nanna H√§nninen, Asymmetriske optagelser, Text by Peter Michael Hornung, Galleri Bo Bjerggaard, 2008. She is stretching out the way of seeing and viewing things while having joy of playing with the exposure, time and light itself- the basic fundaments of photography. Nanna H√§nninen also sees a reference to patterns and ornaments used in islamic art where \\"figurative\\" pictures are not allowed. Asymmetric Exposures brought H√§nninen also to geometrical forms like the Platonic solids and especially the fifth- dodecahedron, which she saw through her newest photographs and as result of this she then for the first time made three- dimensional objects containing photographs in the form of dodecahedron. Plants / objects // paint Plants/Objects//Paint is the most recent series about artificiality, alienation and reality. The new group of works unifies photography and painting, questioning authenticity and imitation of life through this process. Plants are photographed in color, transformed into black and white images, then painted over in their original colors and once more photographed. Nanna's approach is very conceptual and abstract. 'I am not a painter but a photographer. Though in the first place I am a visual artist.', she says. She adds color artificially to the pictures, covering or emphasizing parts that are most important. The color, which was the original and true element, is recreated. Abstract elements such as life and reality often intertwine and overlap similar because of the endless change of time. It is the alienation of the nature itself and its circulation that affects her work.

It was released on September 1, 2009 and is presented as: a learning tool, an open ended computer game, an animation tool, and an engineering tool. The software is functional with: desktop and laptop computers, touch screen tablets, and interactive white board systems such as SMART Boards. The physics engine in Algodoo utilizes the SPOOK linear constraint solver by Claude Lacoursi√®re and a modified version of Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) computational method. This program has been used by many people including: educators, students, and children. Algodoo has remained as a popular choice from websites like List Of Freeware and Download Cloud for a physics sandbox program due to its complexity, simple GUI and free price.  History  In 2008, Emil Ernerfeldt created an interactive 2D physics simulator for his master's thesis project in computer science at Ume√• University in Ume√•, Sweden. This project was released for public and non-commercial use under the name \\"Phun\\" and gained considerable attention after a clip of Ernerfeldt using the software went viral on YouTube. In May 2008, Ernerfeldt brought the Phun project to Algoryx Simulation AB, a company founded in 2007 by Ernerfeldt's former supervisor at Ume√• University, Kenneth Bodin. In 2009, Phun was rereleased under the name \\"Algodoo\\" (a combination of the words algorithm and do). The name change was motivated by the fact that the word \\"phun\\" is used by many sites deemed inappropriate for younger users and the fact that trademarking \\"phun\\" was nearly impossible. In October 2011, Algoryx released two new versions: Algodoo for Education and Algodoo 2.0.0. In February 2017, Algodoo for iPad was updated to version 2.1.2 to maintain functionality with iOS 10. There now is a new 3D sandbox system called Algoryx Momentum, also made by Emil Ernerfeldt.  Graphical user interface  Algodoo's graphical user interface (GUI) incorporates several moveable toolbars generated around the edges of the screen including the top menu toolbar, the browser toolbar, the (general) toolbar, the tool options toolbar, the simulation controls/environment toolbar, and the properties toolbar. Among other things, these toolbars provide the user with the options to change language; run tutorials; browse and save scenes; find and share scenes online; draw, edit, and interact with scenes; zoom in and out; play and pause the simulation; undo and redo; turn on/off gravity, air friction, and a background grid; and change the properties of the selected object such as the material type and the color. Within the (general) toolbar users can use the following tools to create and move shapes: * Plane tool (A) - used to create infinite planes. * Brush tool (B) - used to draw shapes with brush strokes. * Circle tool (C) - used to create circles. * Drag tool (D) - used to move objects while the simulation is running. * Tracer tool (E) - used to attach a tracer to an object (which draws the path of where that object has traveled). * Fixate tool (F) - used to weld an object to the object behind it or the background. * Gear tool (G) - used to create gears with axles. * Axle tool (H) - used to connect an object with an underlying object or the background with an axle. * Sketch tool (K) - (multi- tool) a single tool with the functions of many of the other tools. * Laser pen tool (L) - used to create a laser. * Move tool (M) - used to move objects and fluids while the simulation is paused. * Chain tool (N) - used to create chains and ropes. * Thruster tool (O) - used to attach a thruster to an object. * Polygon tool (P) - used to draw free form shapes. * Scale tool (R) - used to change the size of the object (along both axes equally with SHIFT, by integer values such as 2x or 3x with CTRL). * Spring tool (S) - used to connect two objects with a spring (or to connect a single object and the background in a similar fashion). * Knife tool (T) - used to cut polygons along a drawn line. * Texture tool (U) - used to move, scale, and rotate the texture of an object (texture used here as in the mapping sense to refer to applying a picture to an object). * Box tool (X) - used to create rectangles (or squares with SHIFT) * Rotate tool - used to rotate objects and fluids. * Erase tool - used to erase objects, or planes. The drop down menu (accessed by double clicking or right clicking an object) includes several tools for liquifying, turning into sponges, cloning, and mirroring objects; for generating plots of physics-relevant quantities of the object (such as velocity vs. time or y-position vs. x-position); for selecting objects; for changing the appearance of objects (including the option to toggle the presence of velocity, momentum, and force vectors); for assigning text to an object; for changing the simulated material of the object (including such parameters as density, mass, friction, restitution, and attraction); for assigning and changing an object's velocity; for a list of the information about an object (including the area, mass, moment of inertia, position, velocity, angular velocity, momentum, angular momentum, energy (total), kinetic linear energy, kinetic angular energy, potential energy (gravity), potential energy (attraction), and potential energy (spring)); for assigning objects to various collision layers; for performing \\"geometry actions\\" (such as gluing objects to the background, adding center axles, adding center thrusters, attaching tracers, attaching gears, or transforming the object into a circle); for editing objects via constructive solid geometry (CSG); for assigning keystrokes for controlling the object; and for opening a script menu for that selected object(s). User-created simulations in Algodoo are referred to as scenes. With the tools listed above, users can create complex scenes. The easily accessible tools in Algodoo allow new users to quickly create simple things like cars or basic machines, while still allowing more experienced users to make more complex constructions like intricate Rube Goldberg machines. Major changes in the GUI since Phun Although Algodoo's GUI is essentially the same as in Phun, many significant changes were made in the available functionality. Two notable changes include a new optics modeling engine and a snap-to-grid feature allowing for higher precision scene creation. The inclusion of the optics modeling engine granted much more freedom in terms of using Algodoo's scripting language, Thyme, as users were thereafter able to initiate events by hitting an object with a stream of laser light. Other notable changes include the addition of a velocities menu, which allows users to set a geometry's velocity to a set value; incompressible water, which allows for much more realistic fluid simulation; the plotting menu; vector visualization; and many other new features, bug fixes, and improvements.  Educational research  In 2011, a computer science masters student at Ume√• University, Emanuel Dahlberg, completed his thesis on using the 2D mechanics in Algodoo to model electricity for the purposes of education. Several projects have since been published exploring how teachers can use Algodoo to help students learn about perpetual motion machines, the buoyant force, Archimedes' principle, Newton's cradles, rolling motion, oblique projectile motion, light refraction, and even Kepler's laws. Many of these studies highlight how Algodoo provides students with a unique environment to learn physics. One paper claims that allowing students to explore physics concepts in Algodoo motivates them to engage creatively in the classroom while \\"serving as a first step into the world of computing modeling in physics\\". Algodoo is largely based upon a constructionist learning paradigm. Outside of physics education, Algodoo has been used as a stepping stone for testing machines in a simulation before building them in the real world due to its simple user interface and quick learning curve compared to other physics simulators. According to Hackaday, \\"[Sarah] turned to Algodoo, a physics simulation where anyone can put shafts on rotating hubs, spin everything up, and see what happens.\\" File sharing Originally, the upload system for Phun was hosted by a small website at the Academic Computer Club from Ume√• University. The upload system was later moved to a Phunland site in an upload subdirectory and then moved again to the Phunbox file sharing directory created by Zuriki and Lukas Wolf (which contained 16,874 user uploadsPhunbox1's full scene directory). After several more changes to the upload system, the directory was finally moved to the Algodoo website under the name Doobox. After a user suggested that Doobox might not be a good name for the file sharing system (it was also the name of a software company, the name was then changed to Algobox, which was suggested by Chronos. Users of Algodoo can share the scenes they create via Algobox; the platform currently houses over 200,000 unique user-created scenes and is continuing to rise. Due to the decrease in the number of recent updates and Algodoo becoming free in 2013, many users have assumed that Algodoo is discontinued. Algoryx has yet to release a statement to confirm or deny this, but many long-time users have abandoned the program, leaving Algobox to have a sharp decline in scene submissions. During this time, there has been a rise of marble races, algothons (which is a portmanteau of Algodoo and -athlon), camps (where a bunch of people sign up and complete challenges to win), and \\"whodunnit\\" scenes (which are inspired from Danganronpa). Despite this, there are people who still make scenes that are of \\"higher quality\\" according to users on Algobox. This includes: realistic vehicles, electronics, combustion engines, and other machines.

Eurofins Group has an international network of more than 800 laboratories across 47 countries and a portfolio of over 150,000 validated analytical methods for characterizing the safety, identity, purity, composition, authenticity and origin of products and biological substances. Through research and development, in-licensing and acquisitions, the Group draws on the latest developments in the field of biotechnology and analytical sciences. Eurofins acquired German company MWG-Biotech and in 2011 of the US company Lancaster Laboratories, the latter being acquired for 150 million euros. Le monde entier s‚Äôarrache \\"les Experts\\" d‚ÄôEurofins, Capital, 1 December 2011 History Eurofins Scientific was founded in 1987 with 4 employees, when Gilles Martin purchased the rights to the SNIF-NMR technology from the University of Nantes, a patented analytical method used to verify the origin and purity of several types of food and beverages and identify sophisticated fraud not detectable by other methods. This technology had been researched and developed by his own parents, who were professors at the university. During this start up period (1987 to 1997), the SNIF-NMR¬Æ patent was registered and approved in the US and broadened to apply to a wider range of products than the original wine test, such as fruit juices and other non-alcoholic beverages. The strategy was then formulated to develop the offering in-house and to expand the range of tests provided to customers. From 1997, the focus for Eurofins was to buy the very best labs with unique technologies and know how with the potential for global recognition. Additionally the Group expanded to eight new countries and grew to include over 50 laboratory sites. Leading positions were built up in core markets (Food, Pharma and Environment) and also key segments such as genomic information and contaminants testing. This in turn enabled the group access to new, top-tier clients in the pharma and retailing sectors. This was funded firstly with the IPO in Paris in 1997 and then the secondary listing in Frankfurt in 2000. From 2002, Eurofins started developing the infrastructure to support the business, including a unified IT platform. Recent news On 1 July 2014, Eurofins purchased Viracor-IBT Laboratories from Ampersand Capital Partners for $255 million. The company will continue to be known as ViraCor- IBT. In May 2015, Eurofins acquired QC Laboratories in the US and Experchems in Canada as part of its North American expansion strategy. In June 2015, Eurofins announced the acquisition of Biomnis in France for 220 million euros.https://www.eurofins.com/media-centre/press-releases-2015/2015-06-22/ In September 2017, Eurofins Scientific announced to acquire EAG Laboratories (Evans Analytical Group), a scientific services company that serves technology and life-science-related industries. On 5 March 2018, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection announced to collect a $600,000 penalty from Eurofins QC, LLC (Eurofins QC in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania) for falsifying whole effluent toxicity test (WETT) results. Eurofins purchased Nanolab Technologies Inc, a service lab for the silicon valley industry, on 2 August 2018. Eurofins acquired MET Labs on 11 January 2018, which enabled them to have a Nationally Recognized Test Laboratory as established by OHSA. At the end of 2018, a deal was finalized between Eurofins and the JSTI Group for the acquisition of TestAmerica Environmental Services, LLC, adding 24 laboratories and 40 service centers to the Eurofins environmental testing network. On 3 June 2019, Eurofins reported that some of its IT systems were infected with ransomware and many servers and systems were taken offline.

He was an important counselor of Margaret of Parma, Grand Huntsman of Brabant and generally sided with Spanish politics in the early years of the Eighty Years War. Biography He was the son of Mich√®l de Berlaymont and Maria de Berault. He was lord of Floyon and Haultpenne, and baron of Hierges. In 1553, he became stadtholder of Namur. Berlaymont was knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, senior hunting master of Brabant, Flanders and Namur, member of the Council of State, hereditary chamberlain of finances and bailiff of the county of Namur. In 1567, he became a member of the much-dreaded Council of Troubles. In 1574, his home territory Berlaimont was elevated to the status of a county. In 1577, Berlaymont was one of the signees of the Union of Brussels, which he immediately repudiated. He is known for his famous comment on the Compromise of Nobles in 1566. The nobles had come to Brussels with a petition for Margaret of Parma, governess of the Netherlands, hoping to stop the persecution of Protestants. When Margaret asked who these people were, Berlaymont supposedly answered with \\"Ce ne sont que des geux\\" (they are but beggars) after which the Dutch rebels promptly adopted the name Geuzen as their own. Issue He was married to Adriana de Ligne Barban√ßon and had these children: * Gilles de Berlaymont (ca. 1540 - 1579), stadtholder of various territories of the Seventeen Provinces. Died at the Siege of Maastricht (1579) * Louis de Berlaymont (1542 - 1596), archbishop of Cambrai and prevost of Saint Servatius in Maastricht * Lancelot de Berlaymont, lord of Beauraing * Claude de Berlaymont (1550 - 1587), lord of Hautepenne, governor of Breda * Florent de Berlaymont (ca. 1550 - 1626), lord of Floyon, knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, stadtholder of Namur, Artois, Guelders and Luxembourg * Adrienne de Berlaymont (? - 1582), married John of Brandenburg * Yolande de Berlaymont (1560-?) * Marie de Berlaymont (?)

He is best known as the (co) architect of the Canton Tower in Guangzhou. Mark Hemel's view Mark's focus is on \\"global architecture\\". His main interest is to play a role in the expression and development of our contemporary culture. In his view Architecture can play an important and positive role in shedding light on potential routes \\"our\\" global culture could take. Mark Hemel: \\"The next generation of planners, architects and designers will have to get used thinking big, so making reference to big environmental challenges and mayor expected world population dynamic. Architects in particular will find themselves less and less powerful. We therefore have to focus on making our work more \\"information based\\" or we might get side-lined and more and more irrelevant\\". His solution is to strive for 'TRUE' integration of the different aspects of design and planning, starting with small steps at the time. He pleads for getting rid of the modern valuation-system of measuring everything in terms of money, efficiency and functionality, and instead calls for a more holistic valuation system that weighs small but essential and strategic influences against the more superficial and big and more obvious influences. Mark proclaims that \\"recent decades of science have shown us that we should not ignore the small, and that we should focus on the interrelationship of seemingly independent things. The world is a global world, everything on it, including the people, form one holistic whole. We should go beyond Modernism's mayor fault: splitting problems into sub-sets in order to solve them independently, in the process destroying the interrelationship.\\" He therefore pleads for \\"biological intelligence\\" to be introduced in the architecture and planning professions. Hemel is currently working on a book in which the term \\"biological intelligence\\" will be introduced. Influences Hemel was educated by American theorist Jeffrey Kipniss and UK architect Zaha Hadid as well as Dutch architects Herman Herzberger and Carel Weeber. He was particularly influenced by books of Richard Dawkins (The Selfish Gene 1976) Kevin Kelly (Out of Control 1995), Ilya Prigogine (Order Out of Chaos 1984) and Douglas Hofstadter (G√∂del, Escher, Bach). After his post graduate studies at the Architectural Association in London Mark began teaching at the AA. Besides an interested for everything that evolved or subconsciously developed, Mark also has a great interest in mathematics and geometry. During his studies in Delft he pursued mathematical courses in chaos theory. The reason for his interest in this is that chaos theory seems to explain why Modernism, in its purest form, is doomed to lead to disaster, and that the alternative \\"synthesis and integration\\" bears much more prospect. :\\"In contemporary architecture you see lots of forms that refer to nothing. And indeed, we want to make designs that are more 'informed'.\\" Hemel was chosen as one of Design- Build Network's \\"New Young Architects to Watch for 2010\\". Biography Mark Hemel was born in 1966 in Emmen, the Netherlands. Hemel graduated in 1993 from the Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands and in 1996 from the Architectural Association in London in the Graduate Design Program. After his studies in The Netherlands he received a scholarships for 1-year research in Africa and Asia from the Netherlands Foundation for Visual Arts, Design and Architecture. During this year he traveled through Ghana, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, India, and Indonesia concentrating his research on organic city- developments. Beside this he also developed an interest in vernacular tactics to cope with the omnipresent harsh environmental circumstances which he came across in Africa and Asia. He particularly studied the Dogon in Mali, the cities of Djenne, the people on the island of Nias, Indonesia, and the southern temple cities of India. Hemel worked and lived the first 9 years (1995‚Äì2003) of his professional life in London, United Kingdom. In 2003 he returned to the Netherlands to set up his practise in Amsterdam. Hemel is a tutor and educator. He has been a Unit-master at the Architectural Association in London from 1999 to 2008 and design-tutor of the post-graduate Environment and Energy program at the AA in London, since 2002. Over these years he experimented to develop performance-based architectural projects. Some of his students became very successful executing his new approach to architecture and were awarded various prizes. In 2003 Hemel was awarded the RIBA tutor prize related to Bronze Medal Award-winning of one of his students. Hemel has been active in multi-disciplinary groups trying to reinvigorate the dried-up architectural debate. He is a member of the do-group; an international inter- disciplinary research-group and participating in the Performing Arts Labs; a UK-based architectural research group sponsored by the United Kingdom's National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts. Hemel is registered as architect at the Stichting Bureau Architecten Register, The Hague, the Netherlands. Professional practice Hemel co-founded the firm Information Based Architecture together with his partner Barbara Kuit in 1998 while they were still based in London. The office is called \\"information based\\" in order to clearly break with the common state of architecture at that time that was producing uninformed \\"blobs\\". In 2003 they moved their office to Amsterdam, while they focus their work currently on Europe, China and Africa. They have won several high-profile competitions, the most important being the design for the tall Canton Tower which has recently been opened to the public. Hemel's attitude to architectural work can best be explained by the following statement: he believes that \\"architecture should be valued only after the physical form of architecture has come into being, and we should get away of valuing architecture on the basis of conceptual text, sexy images. Architecture cannot fully be photographed, not fully be described in text, and not fully be captured in an image.\\" Publications and reference material Hemel and Kuit's work has been published and exhibited widely. In 2002 they were shortlisted for the Young Architects of the Year Award in the United Kingdom. They have received support by the Dutch Department of Trade and Industry and received several encouragement-grants by the Netherlands Foundation for Visual Arts, Design and Architecture. Hemel is the author of a book entitled Supermodel, the making of the world's tallest TV tower (2011).

After retiring from the stage, she became a highly regarded singing teacher, serving on the voice faculties of the Curtis Institute of Music and the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University, and she taught Young Artists' Programs at Santa Fe Opera(Santa Fe New Mexico) and at Lyric Opera of Chicago. Biography Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to a family of Scottish and English descent, Harshaw had her earliest musical experiences singing in church choirs as a child. She often performed duets with her sister Miriam as well but never seriously contemplated a vocal career during her youth. After graduating from high school she worked for a telephone company. From 1928 to 1932 she was a member of the alto section of the Mendelssohn Club, a historic choir which at that time performed often with the Philadelphia Orchestra under conductor Leopold Stokowski. She proceeded to win a series of vocal competitions in the early 1930s which led to performances in Philadelphia and Washington D.C. Career Harshaw made her professional opera debut with the Philadelphia Operatic Society as Azucena in Giuseppe Verdi's Il trovatore on April 30, 1934. That same year she sang the Voice of the Mother of Antonia in The Tales of Hoffmann and the shepherd boy in Tosca with the Philadelphia Orchestra under conductor Alexander Smallens. She performed in a few more operas with the orchestra the following year, singing Giovanna in Rigoletto, Mamma Lucia in Cavalleria rusticana, and Katisha in The Mikado. She also portrayed Dame Hannah in Gilbert & Sullivan's Ruddigore with The Savoy Company on May 10, 1935 at the Academy of Music.Free Library of Philadelphia: Bound folders on the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Academy of Music In 1935 Harshaw won the National Federation of Music Clubs singing competition which gave her a $1,000 cash prize and led to her New York City concert debut on July 21 of that year at Lewisohn Stadium under conductor Jos√© Iturbi. Later that summer she appeared in several operas with the Steel Pier Opera Company in Atlantic City. In 1936 she entered the graduate program at the Juilliard School where she studied voice with Anna Schoen-Ren√© who had been taught by the legendary Pauline Viardot, daughter of the Spanish singer and pedagogue Manuel Garc√≠a. While there she sang the role of Dido in a 1939 student production of Henry Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. Walter Damrosch attended the performance and approached her afterwards, saying \\"My child, one day you will be Br√ºnnhilde\\". In 1940 she sang in productions of The Bartered Bride, Carmen, The Devil and Daniel Webster (opera), Le donne curiose, Faust, and The Gondoliers at the Chautauqua Opera. She also appeared frequently at the Worcester Music Festival during the early 1940s. In 1942 Harshaw won the Metropolitan Opera's \\"Auditions of the Air\\" (precursor to the National Council Auditions) which led to her d√©but at that house as the Second Norn in Richard Wagner's G√∂tterd√§mmerung on November 25, 1942 under the baton of Erich Leinsdorf. Over the next nine seasons she sang several other mezzo-soprano roles at the Met, largely in operas by Wagner and Verdi. Her Wagner roles during these years included Brang√§ne in Tristan und Isolde, Erda, Flosshilde, and Fricka in Das Rheingold, Erda in Siegfried, the First Norn and Waltraute in G√∂tterd√§mmerung, Fricka and Schwertleite in Die Walk√ºre, Magdalene in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, Mary in The Flying Dutchman, Ortrud in Lohengrin, Venus in Tannh√§user, and Kundry and the Voice from Above in Parsifal. Other roles in her Met repertoire included Amelfa in Le Coq d'Or, Auntie in Peter Grimes, Azucena, Amneris in Aida, Frugola in Il Tabarro, Genevi√®ve in Pell√©as et M√©lisande, Gertrud in H√§nsel und Gretel, Herodias in Salome, La Cieca in La Gioconda, Mistress Quickly in Falstaff, the Mother in Louise, the Third Lady in The Magic Flute, and Ulrica in Un Ballo in Maschera.Metropolitan Opera Archives Harshaw made her first foray into the soprano repertoire singing the role of Senta in The Flying Dutchman opposite Paul Sch√∂ffler in the title role on November 22, 1950. By 1954 she had completely left the mezzo repertoire, with the exception of Ortrud, and effectively succeeded Helen Traubel in the Wagnerian heroine roles of Br√ºnnhilde, Elisabeth, Isolde, Kundry, and Sieglinde. Her only non-Wagnerian role during her soprano years at the Met was Donna Anna in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Don Giovanni. She remained with the Metropolitan until the close of the 1963‚Äì1964 season. Her final and 375th performance at the Met was as Ortrud on March 10, 1964 with Jess Thomas as Lohengrin, Leonie Rysanek as Elsa, and Joseph Rosenstock conducting. During her many years at the Met, Harshaw was also active as a guest artist with opera houses throughout North America and Europe. She was committed to the San Francisco Opera between 1944‚Äì1947, portraying such parts as Amneris, Azucena, Brang√§ne, Fricka, Genevi√®ve, Herodias, La Cieca, Mistress Quickly, Ortrud, Ulrica, and the Nurse in Boris Godunov.San Francisco Opera Archives In 1948 she sang at the Op√©ra National de Paris as Amneris, Brang√§ne, and Dalila in Samson et Dalila, and in the National Opera in Havana, Cuba, as Brangane, with Kirsten Flagstad. In 1950 she made her first appearance with the Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company as Amneris, returning there in 1952 to sing Isolde. She was engaged at the Royal Opera, London from 1953‚Äì1956 and again in 1960, where she excelled as Br√ºnnhilde in Rudolf Kempe‚Äôs Ring Cycles. In 1954 she sang Donna Anna at the Glyndebourne Festival.Harshaw, Margaret Biography at operissimo.com (in German) In 1961 she made her debut with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company as Ortrud. She portrayed the title heroine in Giacomo Puccini's Turandot at the 1964 New York World's Fair. She also sang with opera companies in Cincinnati, New Orleans, San Antonio, Pittsburgh, Houston, Mexico, and Venezuela. She made several Latin American tours and was a soloist with many of the major American orchestras. Other roles in her repertoire included the Leonore in Fidelio, and the title role in Alceste. Last years In 1962, Harshaw joined the voice faculty at Indiana University, where she taught until 1993, becoming a Distinguished Professor of Voice. In 1989, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music from Westminster Choir College. For the Indiana University Opera Theater, Harshaw sang two performances of Puccini's Turandot on July 29 and August 8, 1964. She sang Kundry in four performances of Wagner's Parsifal on March 15, 1964, March 19 and March 22, 1967, and March 31, 1968. Her final operatic performance anywhere was at Indiana University on March 22, 1970 as Br√ºnnhilde in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre. She served on the faculty at the Curtis Institute of Music from 1970‚Äì1976, when the then opera department for which she primarily taught there was dissolved.

History The school site was previously owned by James David Waddell. His family bought the land in the 1840s and set up an orchard on what are now the school grounds. A cottage was built in 1867, now known as Waddell Cottage. Waddell lived in the cottage until 1969, by when the house and orchard were in a bad state of repair. Waddell had refused to put in running water or have the electricity connected. Because he hadn't paid his taxes, the land was resumed by the government as it was thought to be an ideal location for a high school. Local residents fought to have the cottage restored rather than demolished. Galston High School officially began in 1972, although the first classes were taught at Baulkham Hills High School. In 1974, the school's buildings opened on the current site and were added to until its final completion in 1982. The first HSC class to graduate was in 1977. The original school crest has the motto \\"Nitamur Neve Cedamus\\", which is taken from Lord Tennyson's Ulysses and translates as \\"Let us strive and not yield\\". In the early hours of 19 May 2014, Galston High School's library caught fire. This occurred from some technical difficulties in the electric wire systems.

It is seen at the steep natural slopes, road scars and ravines in the Tirupati ‚Äì Tirumala Ghat road in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. In 2001, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) declared the unconformity to be one of the 26 \\"Geological Monuments of India\\". GSI's commemoration document, published on the occasion of the 150 years anniversary celebration, provides an insight into the formation of the subcontinent, the orogeny, the paleoenvironment and the exotic collection of paleo-flora and fauna. The details provided for the Eparchaean Unconformity monument indicate that this feature forms the boundary surface between Proterozoic Nagari Quartzites and Archaean granite. The time gap between the formation of the two units is at least 500 Ma. At this location, the boundary is between sedimentary rocks of the Cudappah Supergroup, 1600 million years in age, and Archaean rocks comprising granites, gneisses and dolerite dykes that are more than 2100 million years old. This unconformity gives an indication of the enormous time gap in the creation of the earth's crust. Topography The geological monument is located in the Tirupati valley, which is bounded between () and (). The basin is delimited between the Palakonda-Velikonda and Sanambatla-Srikalahasti and Nagari ranges of the Eastern Ghats. Tirupati Temple, the most famous pilgrimage centre in South India is in the midst of the range of hills. The hills enclose the temple town to give it a form of an amphitheatre setting. Geology Plaque gives brief details of Eparchaen Unconformity The Tirupati hills are situated at the foot of a range of hills known by several names, including 'Seshachala', 'Venkatachala' and 'Balaji'. There are four geological units: :(1) Archaean rocks of the eastern Dharwar Craton (the granites and gneisses) :(2) the Eparchean unconformity (Quartzose sandstones overlying the granite with a distinct unconformity) :(3) Puranas (a general name for Proterozoic sedimentary sequences found in a series of basins deposited on the Indian Shield; including the Cuddapah Basin) Balasubrahmanyan, M.N. 2006. Geology and tectonics of India: an overview, Memoir No.9, International Association for Gondwana Research :(4) Quaternary deposits The Tirumala hills essentially of precambrian period are composed of sedimentary rocks - quartzites and intercalated shales, which are referred to as the Nagari quartzites, which forms part of the Cuddapah Supergroup. It is a subset of the Purana rock succession that rests above the archaean rocks. The hill ranges of the Tirumala rise to a height of (at Tirumala) from the average height of in the plains at Tirupati. The steep scarp of the ranges shows the Eparchian Unconformity's topographic, structural and denudational features. The sedimentary thickness of the Cudappah basin is of the order of , and includes volcanic sequences in the form of sills and dykes. A prominent Eparchaean Unconformity of the formation resting on the archaean peninsular gneissic complex is noted. Rocks of the Cuddapah Supergroup, and the overlying Kurnool Group, comprise the stratigraphic sequence of the basin. This feature is contiguous all along the defined Archaean-Cuddapah contact zone even though its age may vary along its traced path. Access The location of the Geological Monument is well connected by road, rail and air routes. The nearest railhead to Tirumala hills is Tirupati. The geological monument is located northwest of Tirupati town, at the point on the Tirupati ‚Äì Tirumala Ghat road. From Tirupati railway station the approach to the Tirumala temple is only by road, a distance of . The nearest airport is located at Renigunta, about away from the Tirupati city, which connects to Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore airports.

BigAirBAG also stands for the name of the cushion. It is used for training and entertainment for both professional and amateur riders.  History  The company was established in 2004 by Dutch snowboarders who wanted to improve their technical skills while having fun and without risking injuries. The BigAirBAG first gained popularity in the indoor parks throughout the Netherlands (SnowPlanet, SnowWorld ). Within two years, resorts around Europe and the world got their first BigAirBAGs. The BAB utilizes the latest tendency in the extreme sports to push the execution of the free style tricks to the limit.  BigAirBAG Technology  right The BigAirBAG is built upon the ‚Äòfall cushion‚Äô concept used in professional stunts. The BAB incorporates two air ‚Äòpillows‚Äô: the down one is firm, ensuring stability while the upper one is soft, enabling smoothness of the fall. Two electrical blowers are placed in the sides of the bag to keep it afloat while it is being used. It is (normally) placed in front of a kicker/in run and when a rider lands on it, the holes in the upper layer let air out thus absorbing the fall. The BAB has additional layers on the top (‚Äòimpact deck‚Äô) and on the sides to protect the cushions of damage. There are three sizes of the bag: 15x9m (49x30ft), 15x11m (49x30ft) and 17x11m (56x36ft). Recently full color graphics have been incorporated for branding the top and side decks. The decks are hand painted.  Locations  So far in Europe, the BigAirBAG is featured in 44 resort parks, in countries such as Switzerland, Italy, France, Austria, Turkey, Norway, Finland, Bulgaria, Spain, etc. Around the world, BigAirBAG is situated also in Dubai, Lebanon, Chile, New Zealand, Iran, etc. It is in partnership with Danish social network My Snowparks enabling users to map the resorts, share information about the parks, the weather conditions, etc. The BigAirBAG is also a part of Swatch summer and winter parks.  Events  The BigAirBAG regularly supports events in the Netherlands and worldwide. For five years now, they have had events and free style camps in Spaarnwoude, Den Bosch, Utrecht, Norway (Tacky Invitational Hafjell ), Andorra, Italy, etc. In 2006 BigAirBAG provided the support for the professional snowboarders competing for the world‚Äôs record in airtime in David Benedek‚Äôs Red Bull Gap Session.

He served as a burgrave and castellan governor in the Ortenburg estates, held by the Counts of Celje until 1456. Life Coat of arms of Andreas von Graben, 1531 fresco, St Michael's Church, Lienz Born at Kornberg Castle in the Duchy of Styria, Andreas von Graben was a descendant of the noble (edelfrei) Graben von Stein family, who sprang out from the House of Gorizia (Meinhardiner dynasty) ruling the County of G√∂rz, as well as the County of Tyrol and the Duchy of Carinthia in former times. He was the son of Friedrich I von Graben (d. 1422 at Kornberg Castle) and Katharina von Summeregk (Sommeregg); Burgrave Friedrich II von Graben was a brother of him. Andreas' nephew Ulrich III von Graben became a confidant of the Habsburg emperor Frederick III. Andreas\` sister (?) Veronica von Graben (d. 1467) was married to Philipp Breuner (d. 1458), and Elisabeth von Graben married with Georg von Auersperg (d. 1488). In 1442 Count Frederick II of Celje enfeoffed Andreas von Graben with the Lordship of Sommeregg. He served as a captain (Hauptmann, a sort of stadtholder) of the former Ortenburg estates and also as burgrave (Viscount) and knight at Sommeregg, which he chose as his residence. In 1445 he was involved in the fierce feud between Count Henry VI of Gorizia and his wife Catherine of Gara and later supported the military campaigns of his bellicose liege lord Count Ulrich II of Celje. In 1450 he was also named as Burggraf of Sternberg, near Wernberg. Upon the extinction of the Counts of Celje in 1456, their estates were seized by Emperor Frederick III of the Habsburg dynasty. He enforced a settlement with the Counts of Gorizia, whereupon Andreas von Graben had to renounce his conquests and also lost his office as stadtholder of the Ortenburg estates. Nevertheless, he still is documented as a liege lord around Vellach in 1458, and owner of Falkenstein Castle in 1462.

Origin Autonomous sentiments were developing amongst the local Turkmen population, with the formation of the Turkmen National Army (TNA) in February 1918. Concerned about this, the Bolshevik dominated Ashgabat Soviet appealed to , leader of the Tashkent Soviet for military support, and declared it would carry out a census of all arms-bearing men in the Russian majority town on 17 June 1918. However, this sparked off two days of rioting. The Tashkent Soviet dispatched some Red Guards led by V.

Ellis, University of California Press, 1963 p26 Ashkhabad Committee  On 14 July 1918 The Ashkhabad Executive Committee was founded by Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries following their successful revolt against the Bolsheviks of Tashkent. This committee took the name of the Trans Caspian Provisional Government in November 1918, but is generally referred to as the Transcaspian Government.The British Intervention in Transcaspia, 1918-1919 by C. H. Ellis, University of California Press, 1963 p27 The initial leadership consisted of: *Fyodor Funtikov, Socialist Revolutionary worker, President *Vladimir Dhokov, railway worker *D. Kurilov, railway worker *L. A. Zimen, school teacher and orientalist, Minister of Foreign Affairs Military action The Committee had around 1000 armed men, which consisted of Armenian and Russian troops. British opinion of these forces was less than complimentary. General Wilfrid Malleson had been dispatched by the British Government to resist the Bolshevik forces and assisted the Transcaspian forces by sending them a machine gun team across the border from India. This team stopped the Transcaspian forces being completely overrun by the Bolsheviks, early in the conflict. Malleson then sent an Anglo Indian unit to assist in what became referred to as the Malleson mission. The combined Anglo-Indian and Transcaspian force then went on to successfully engage the Bolsheviks, pushing them out of some of the major cities. The Government was largely in a weak position. It had no economy and was existing on the money it had gained from the Soviets when it took over. The main economy was based on cotton, however, it had no means to export this. It largely sought funds from the British, which it did not get, even for food the British military had used and promised to pay for. The execution of the Baku Commissars Isaak Brodsky's The Execution of the Twenty Six Baku Commissars depicting the Soviet view of the execution. On the night of 20 September 1918, under the leadership of Fyodor Funtikov, they executed the 26 Baku Commissars, which had fled Baku by ship to Krasnovodsk in Turkmenistan. The crisis of December 1918 In December 1918 there was a crisis in the Transcaspian Government. The Government felt it could not control the capital, and asked help from the British who helped by sending troops there. However the Government was fragile, Malleson's opinion being that they had at best a tenuous grip on their forces and people. In addition, Malleson had promised funds and not delivered them. The people started protesting and the Committee resigned. It was replaced by another committee, which was appointed by Teague-Jones. The New committee gradually eventually came under the influence of Denikin's Southern White Russian army, and his men came to bolster the force, creating the White Turkestan Army in January 1919. However, when the British withdrew in 1919, the Bolsheviks went on the offensive and defeated the Transcaspian forces. By 1920 the Tashkent Soviet had regained control of the area and the Transcaspian Government was no longer.

Located at 60 Yorkville Avenue, at its intersection with Bay Street, the complex is situated one block east of the former Four Seasons Hotel Toronto building at 21 Avenue Road. The complex was designed by Peter Clewes of architectsAlliance, and developed by Bay-Yorkville Developments. The taller tower was initially the 10th tallest building in Toronto, but by 2017, its position had fallen to 17th as other taller buildings were completed. The site had previously been the Bay Ford Lincoln car dealership, and it is next door to Toronto Fire Services Station 312. The penthouse, which occupies the entire 55th floor of the West Residence, sold for C$28 million, making it the most expensive condominium unit sold in Canada. The 55-floor complex contains 259 hotel rooms and 210 private condominium units. It offers a two-storey spa, Caf√© Boulud and bar (by international restaurateur and chef Daniel Boulud), and glass-enclosed event spaces. It was designed by architectsAlliance, with Page and Steele as Architect of Record. The project was developed by Bay- Yorkville Developments Ltd. (a joint venture of Alcion Ventures, LP, Menkes Developments, and Lifetime Homes), and it uses the \\"Four Seasons\\" trademark under licence. Before the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Four Seasons Hotels chairman and founder Isadore Sharp proclaimed the new location as being \\"...in a category by itself, a true Four Seasons in our hometown, our flagship hotel. It is a landmark development for the city of Toronto\\". History Lifetime Developments principal and developer Mel Pearl began efforts to find a location for a new Four Seasons hotel in 2002, and he negotiated a payment with the former owner, a German, of the block. There have been several previous Four Seasons properties at other locations in Toronto. The Four Seasons Motor Hotel The first Four Seasons-operated hotel in Toronto was The Four Seasons Motor Hotel, opened in 1961 at 415 Jarvis Street near Carlton. Built by architect Peter Dickinson, it operated as a motor inn before it was demolished and replaced by townhouses. Inn on the Park The next hotel operated by Four Seasons was the Inn on the Park, which opened in 1963. It became a Holiday Inn in the 1980s, and has since been demolished and replaced by the Lexus on the Park car dealership. Four Seasons Sheraton Hotel The Four Seasons Sheraton Hotel opened in 1972 as a joint venture between Four Seasons founder Issy Sharp and Sheraton. Unhappy with the partnership, Sharp sold his 49 percent interest in the hotel in 1976 for $18.5 million, and the hotel was renamed The Sheraton Centre of Toronto. Four Seasons Hotel Toronto The longest-operating Four Seasons property in the city was located on 21 Avenue Road at the intersection with Yorkville Avenue. It consisted of a 31-storey Brutalist concrete tower, with a low-rise podium that stretched south to Cumberland Avenue. It was built in 1972 as the Hyatt Regency Toronto. Issy Sharp bought the hotel in 1978 and renamed it the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto. The hotel was popular with celebrities when the Toronto International Film Festival was centred on the Yorkville area. However Sharp said the building \\"felt like driving into a garage.\\" The hotel closed on March 28, 2012 and was sold to developer Camrost-Felcorp, which converted it to a condominium development known as Yorkville Plaza.http://yorkvilleplaza.com/ The hotel's facade was renovated, while the podium containing the hotel function rooms, driveway and below-grade retail was demolished and replaced by a new retail complex.

The normal river level is the top of the bank behind them. The 2000s drought in Australia, also known as the Millennium drought is said by some to be the worst drought recorded since European settlement. This drought affected most of southern Australia, including its largest cities and largest agricultural region (the Murray‚ÄìDarling basin). It commenced with low rainfall conditions in late 1996 and through 1997, and worsened through particularly dry years in 2001 and 2002. By 2003 it was recognised as the worst drought on record. The year 2006 was the driest on record for many parts of the country and conditions remained hot and dry through to early 2010. The emergence of La Ni√±a weather conditions in 2010 rapidly ended the drought, and led to floods in some locations. The drought placed extreme pressure on agricultural production and urban water supply in much of southern Australia. It has led to the construction of six major seawater desalination plants to provide water to Australia's major cities, and to changes in the management of water in the Murray‚ÄìDarling basin, particularly the formation of the Murray‚ÄìDarling Basin Authority. Prelude to drought Beginning in the second half of 1991, a very severe drought occurred throughout Queensland which intensified in 1994 and 1995 to become the worst on record.Rankin, Robert. (1992) Secrets of the Scenic Rim. Rankin Publishers (page 151) By October 1994, part of the upper Darling River system had collapsed and the Condamine River had reverted to a series of ponds. Across the state 40% of Queensland was drought declared.Collie, Gordon. Dry tears of despair. The Courier-Mail. p. 29. 22 October 1994. From July to August 1995 the drought was further influenced by a strong El Ni√±o weather pattern associated with high temperatures. According to Primary Industries Minister, Ed Casey, \\"the drought affected region stretched in a 200 km to 300 km wide strip from Stanthorpe to Charters Towers\\".Collie, Gordon. Water crisis threatens towns. The Courier Mail p. 3. 3 June 1995 So few wheat and barley crops survived, about half the usual for that year, that grains had to be imported from other states.  Geographic and seasonal characteristics, and compounding factors  The Bureau of Meteorology has characterised the Millennium Drought as primarily affecting: * Southern Australia (rainfall in northern Australia was above average during the same period). * Cool season (April to October) rainfall, other than for Tasmania where rainfall was well below historical averages in both warm and cool seasons. Although the period of the Millennium Drought was characterised by several El Ni√±o weather patterns, which affect the entire southern Pacific region and typically bring hot and dry conditions to eastern Australia, it cannot be explained purely by natural variability. The Bureau of Meteorology concluded that climate change exacerbated the extent and severity of the drought. The effects of the drought on water availability was compounded by historically high temperatures over the same period. The Bureau of Meteorology's head of climate analysis, David Jones, released statistics showing that in 2007 South Australia, NSW, Victoria, the ACT and the Murray‚ÄìDarling basin all set temperature records by a very large margin. 2007 was the eleventh year in a row that the Murray‚ÄìDarling basin had experienced above average temperatures and was (at that time) Australia's sixth-warmest year on record. Jones warned that \\"There is absolutely no debate that Australia is warming... it may be time to stop describing south-eastern Australia as gripped by drought and instead accept the extreme dry as permanent.\\"Richard Macey This drought may never break Sydney Morning Herald 4 January 2008  Timeline  Rainfall deciles for Australia in 1997  1996 to 2000: patchy rainfall in the south-east  Dry conditions began to emerge in south-eastern Australia during late 1996 and accentuated during the strong 1997 El Ni√±o event. Rainfall in 1998, 1999 and 2000 was closer to average, with isolated areas affected by rainfall well below average.  2001 to 2005: El Ni√±o brings on strong drought conditions  Australian rainfall deciles for 2002 According to the Bureau of Meteorology, much of eastern Australia experienced a dry 2001. 2002 was one of Australia's driest and warmest years on record, with 'remarkably widespread' dry conditions, particularly in the eastern half of the country which was again affected by El Ni√±o conditions. It was, at the time, Australia's fourth-driest year since 1900. The El Ni√±o weather pattern broke down during 2003 but occasional strong rainfall in 2003 and 2004 failed to alleviate the cumulative effect of persistently low rainfall in south-eastern Australia, with some measurement stations having recorded below average rainfall for eight consecutive years. Rainfall in early 2005 remained below average, and better rainfall in the second half of the year again failed to break continuing drought conditions in the south-east.  2006 and 2007: extreme dry and hot conditions in the Murray‚ÄìDarling basin  Australian rainfall deciles for 2006 South-east Australia experienced its second-driest year on record in 2006, particularly affecting the major agricultural region of the Murray‚ÄìDarling basin. Despite slightly above normal summer/autumn rainfall, the late-winter to mid-spring rainfalls failed, resulting in the 2006 annual rainfall being 40 to 60% below normal over most of southern Australia. The average rainfall in the state of South Australia was the lowest since 1900 with only of rain recorded compared to the normal winter/spring average of . Across Victoria and the Murray‚ÄìDarling Basin the season was the second-driest since 1900. While New South Wales' rainfall was boosted by above normal falls along the north coast of the state, the state's average rainfall for the season was the third lowest since 1900. The situation was exacerbated by temperatures being the highest on record since the 1950s.Australian Drought and Climate Change , retrieved on 7 June 2007. In early 2007, senior weather forecasters predicted that the drought would ease along the east coast with a return to average rainfall from late February 2007. Forecasters believed that the El Ni√±o effect that had been driving the drought since 2006 had ended. However, this did not turn out to be correct as 2007 saw record temperatures across the south of Australia, and only patchy rain. Promising early year rains transitioned into a very dry July‚ÄìOctober period. Heavy rainfall in June and July, particularly in coastal regions of New South Wales and in Victoria's Gippsland region, together with tentative forecasts of a La Ni√±a event, brought hope that the drought may have ended. In August 2007, the Darling River flowed again after nearly a year of no flows; however, the Murray-Darling Basin experienced their seventh consecutive year of below-average rain and inflows into the Basin during the winter of 2007 were still amongst the lowest on record, though marginally better than those of the winter of 2006 which had been the driest on record. At the end of 2007 the Bureau of Meteorology estimated that south-eastern Australia had missed the equivalent of a full year's rain in the previous 11 years. Australian rainfall deciles for 2009  2008 and 2009: continuing hot and dry conditions  2008 and 2009 saw continuing hot and dry conditions in south-eastern Australia, with occasional heavy rainfall failing to break the continuing drought. The effects of the drought were exacerbated by Australia's (then) second-hottest year on record in 2009, with record-breaking heatwaves in January, February and the second half of the year. The drought in Sydney eased around April 2008 and Sydney's main water catchments reached 65 percent, 25 per cent fuller than they were at the same time the previous year. However, Victoria remained drought affected, with Melbourne's water supplies dipping to around 30% by July 2008. In Tasmania drought conditions worsened in 2008, with many areas reporting no significant rainfall for three years. Australian rainfall deciles for 2010  2010 and 2011: La Ni√±a finally breaks the drought  Australia's weather pattern transitioned rapidly to a wet La Ni√±a pattern during the autumn of 2010, resulting in record-breaking rains in the Murray-Darling basin and well above average rainfall across the south-east. For many locations this was the first year of above-average rainfall since 1996. The rainfall dramatically increased surface water storage and soil moisture, effectively ending the drought in the south-east. While 70% of New South Wales was in drought at the beginning of 2010, the entire state was officially out of drought by December. The entire state experienced its wettest spring on record. Several rivers, including rivers in the outback had flooded several times, and many dams were overflowing, including the Burrendong, Burrinjuck and Pindari Dams. Canberra's dams were above 90% capacity. The 2010 Victorian storms in March did little to help Melbourne's storage levels, but steady winter rains, and the 2010 Victorian floods in September, rapidly increased storage levels. Melbourne also recorded its average annual rainfall in 2010 for the first time since 1996, and its wettest spring since 1993. By 2011, Victoria was drought free for the first time in almost 15 years and was instead gripped by very wet conditions and severe flooding. Queensland experienced heavy storms in December 2010 and January 2011, resulting in widespread flooding. Despite Western Australia experiencing its fifth-wettest spring on record, drought in the South West, Gascoyne and Pilbara regions of Western Australia's intensified in 2010, with the regions experiencing their driest year on record. Perth's dams registered their lowest inflows on record with the city itself recording its third-driest year on record, along with the hottest spring on record. In South Australia, only two regions in the Riverland remained in drought. Heavy rains elsewhere led to bumper harvests over much of the state, this in turn led to the largest mouse plague since 1993 across parts of South Australia, West Australia and Victoria. While some farmers tried to replant, in some areas many gave up as millions of mice covered their fields. Farmers often characterised the plague as being worse than the drought.Kerry Staight Mouse plague 'worse than drought' ABC 5 July 2010 Effects of the drought  Agriculture  Victorian countryside Agricultural production was severely affected. Australia's cotton production had dropped, with the smallest area planted in 20 years, a 66% reduction compared to five years earlier which was considered a \\"normal\\" year. The crop had been half its usual size for three of the previous five years. Water use by the industry fell by 37% between 2000/01 and 2004/05, due mainly to the drought.ABS Water Account Australia 2004/05 figures quoted by Water and Cotton Fact Sheet of 13 February 2007 retrieved 5 March 2007 from Cotton Australia In the order of 20 cotton communities and 10,000 people directly employed by the cotton industry are impacted by the drought. The main areas affected were in New South Wales: Menindee where the area under production has reduced by 100%, Bourke has reduced the area under production by 99%, Walgett has reduced the area under production by 95%, the Macquarie River has reduced the area under production by 74% and the Gwydir River has reduced the area under production by 60%. Dry paddocks in the Riverina region during 2007 In Queensland the worse affected areas are Biloela which has reduced the area under production by 100%, at Dirranbandi there has been a 91% reduction, Central Highlands has reduced the area under production by 82% and Darling Downs has reduced the area under production by 78%. Bourke has had adequate water for only one cotton crop in the last five years.Water and Cotton Fact Sheet of 13 February 2007 retrieved 5 March 2007 from Cotton Australia Stock feed was also becoming scarce and farmers are finding it difficult to feed cattle and sheep. Dairy producers were hit particularly hard by the drought with 2004 a particularly bleak year in the sector, as a drought-caused drop in production sent revenue in the industry down by 4.5%.  Environment  In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term, maybe irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole Murray-Darling basin if it did not receive sufficient water by October of that year.BBC News: Australian rivers face disaster The very low flow to the Lower River Murray in South Australia (over Lock 1) resulted in the lowest water levels in over 90 years of records. The lowest water levels during the extreme low flow period were reached in April 2009 and represented a 64% and 73% reduction in the volume of Lakes Alexandrina and Albert respectively. The low water levels and inflows meant there was no outflow from the lake system during the extreme low flow period. During this period the lake levels fell below mean sea level (approximately +0.2 m AHD) downstream of the barrages, reversing the usual positive hydraulic gradient from the lake to the sea. The seawater intrusion, lack of flushing, evapoconcentration and increased resuspension resulted in severe water quality impacts Exposure and oxidation of acid sulfate soils due to falling water levels from 2007‚Äì2009 in the Lower River Murray and Lower Lakes also resulted in acidification of soils, lake and ground water.Mosley LM, Palmer D, Leyden E, Fitzpatrick R, and Shand P (2014). Changes in acidity and metal geochemistry in soils, groundwater, drain and river water in the Lower Murray River after a severe drought. Science of the Total Environment 485‚Äì486: 281‚Äì291. Large scale engineering interventions were undertaken to prevent further acidification, including construction of a bund and pumping of water to prevent exposure and acidification of Lake Albert. Management of acidification in the Lower Lakes was also undertaken using aerial limestone dosing. Ironically, the easing of the drought led to a large blackwater (low dissolved oxygen) event across a large area of the River Murray during high flows in 2011. Organic carbon (dead plant material) that had been retained in the landscape during the drought was mobilised into the river system and the breakdown of this consumed dissolved oxygen.Whitworth KL, Kerr JL, Mosley LM, Conallin J, Hardwick L, and Baldwin DS (2013). Options for managing hypoxic blackwater in river systems: case studies and framework, Environmental Management 114, 139‚Äì147. The environmental legacy of the drought persists in parts of the system. For example, as of 2014 Lake Albert salinity was still elevated four years after the drought, and acidity persists in soils and groundwater. Urban water Australia had previously relied solely on water from dams for agriculture and consumption. The drought changed the way Australia treated its water resources. Because of the long-term effects of the drought now showing, many state governments attempted to \\"drought-proof\\" their states with more permanent solutions such as grey-water water-recycling, government rebates for home-owners to install water tanks, and tougher restrictions on industries. The citizens of Toowoomba voted on, and rejected, a referendum on using recycled sewage water. As a result, no recycled sewage was added to Toowoomba's drinking supply. Most Australian mainland capital cities faced a major water crisis with less than 50% of water storages remaining.  Sydney  Plans for a desalination project in Sydney were temporarily halted in 2005 after public opposition and the discovery of new underground aquifers. By late 2006, however, with Sydney's water storages plunging to their lowest levels since the 1950s ‚Äì around 33% of capacity ‚Äì the authorities decided to reinstate the project. A$1.8 billion desalination plant was then constructed at Kurnell, in southern Sydney, opening in the summer of 2009‚Äì10. The drought in Sydney eased around April 2008 and Sydney's main water catchments reached 65 percent, 25 per cent fuller than they were at the same time the previous year.  Melbourne  Melbourne had rain up to 90% below the average for September and October 2006, compounding the problem of extremely low rainfall from the preceding winter months. Melbourne had also experienced high temperatures throughout October causing increased evaporation of water in dams and reservoirs, which resulted in their levels falling by around 0.1% a day. As a result of all these factors Melbourne was put on tight water restrictions and as of July 2009, water levels in its dams were at a mere 27% of capacity. Melbourne had had Stage 3a water restrictions from 1 April 2007, and narrowly avoided Stage 4 restrictions, with the minimum storage level of around 25.8% remaining above the threshold of 25% for enacting Stage 4. This led to the construction of the North-South Pipeline which would divert water out of the Goulburn River and supply it to Melbourne to meet water demands. Many towns in Victoria were close to running out of water, with some of the few Victorian towns without water restrictions being in the East Gippsland water area, where reservoir levels were above 80%. The Victorian Government also began building a $3.1 Billion 150Gl (gigalitre) desalination plant, one of the world's largest. When completed in 2011, it would be capable of supplying up to a third of Melbourne's water needs. The 2010 Victorian storms in March did little to help Melbourne's storage levels, but steady winter rains, and the 2010 Victorian floods in September, rapidly increased storage levels. 2010 saw Australia officially record its wettest spring on record due to a moderate to strong La Nina developing over the region. Water restrictions were reduced to stage 3 on 2 April, and stage 2 on 1 September.State government eases Melbourne's water restrictions, The Age  Brisbane  Brisbane combined Dam levelsBrisbane water levels reduced to under 20% of capacity, having had no substantial inflow for five years. Brisbane organised to be supplied via larger dams, a pipeline and possibly also recycling. A desalination project was initiated on the Gold Coast. The drought in Queensland had mostly eased with Brisbane recording very heavy rain in May 2009, and premier Anna Bligh announcing that South East Queensland was no longer experiencing drought.Drought over in SE Qld, ABC News, 20 May 2009 Brisbane's dams were now at full capacity with the state in general experiencing its wettest spring on record. The end of the drought and heavy spring rains in Queensland culminated with devastating floods in December 2010 and January 2011.  Perth  In November 2006 Perth completed a seawater desalination plant that will supply the city with 17% of its needs. In 2010 Perth's dams registered their lowest inflows on record with the city itself recording its third-driest year on record, along with the hottest spring on record.  Adelaide  Port Stanvac Desalination PlantIn South Australia work on a small pilot desalination plant at Port Stanvac, costing $10 million and with a capacity of 100,000 litres per day, commenced in January 2008,Work begins on pilot desal plant Jeremy Roberts, The Australian, 21 January 2008.

Retrieved 25 August 2011. Electricity supply The drought had a material impact on Australia's National Electricity Market, particularly during autumn and winter 2007. It reduced output from major hydro-electric generators Snowy Hydro and Hydro Tasmania, and also constrained output from some coal-fired generators that use fresh water for cooling. The Australian Energy Regulator found that these effects led to noticeably higher prices from around March 2007, but that these effects had largely eased by September. Policy responses National Plan for Water Security Then Prime Minister John Howard responded to extreme weather conditions to announce a major water policy reform agenda in January 2007, known as the National Plan for Water Security. This led to the passage of the Water Act (2007) by the Commonwealth Parliament, the formation of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority in 2008 and the publication of the Murray- Darling Basin Plan under the Gillard Government in 2012. Drought assistance On 27 April 2012, Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig stated that the two final areas in Australia receiving federal 'exceptional circumstances' drought support, Bundarra and Eurobodalla in New South Wales, would cease being eligible the following week. The Federal Government had provided $4.5 billion in drought assistance since 2001. The related move to end the exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidy program was criticised as premature by the NSW Farmers Association and National Farmers' Federation. Research has shown the failure of crops and the financial problems this brings about can lead to increased stress and even suicides in some cases. To counter this rural Victoria invested in improving their mental health services during the drought period of 2001 to 2007. This played a major role in reducing the number of drought related suicides during this period.

It took part in the Burma Campaign and was disbanded after the end of the war. World War II When Japan entered the war and drove British, Indian and Chinese forces from Burma in early 1942, XV Corps was formed from the Assam and Bengal Presidency District HQ on 30 March 1942, to defend Bengal, under the command of Eastern Army, which in turn was controlled by GHQ India. The Corps badge was an arrangement of three \\"V\\"s (signifying fifteen in Roman numerals) in black on a red background. Its first commander was Lieutenant General Noel Beresford-Peirse. On 9 June, Beresford- Peirse was appointed to command India's Southern Command (an army-level administrative HQ) and Lieutenant General William Slim, former commander of the disbanded Burma Corps, took over XV Corps. At this point, XV Corps HQ was at Barrackpur near Calcutta. The Corps had the multiple roles of defending Bengal and Orissa from Japanese invasion, maintaining internal security over a wide area of eastern India and training its raw units. In July, Eastern Army took over direct control of operations in the Burmese coastal province of Arakan (a move which in hindsight proved to be unwise), and XV Corps HQ was transferred to Ranchi in Bihar, with a training and internal security role. On 5 April 1943, XV Corps was hastily summoned to Chittagong to resume control of operations in Arakan, where a Japanese counter-attack had driven back the British and Indian troops. It proved too late to restore the situation with the exhausted troops, and the Corps fell back to the Indian frontier before the monsoon halted operations. On October 15, Slim was promoted to command Eastern Army (which subsequently became British Fourteenth Army). His replacement was Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Christison. Under Fourteenth Army, XV Corps resumed the advance in Arakan towards the end of the year. In the early months of 1944, the Corps gained the first significant success against the Japanese in the South East Asia, when they defeated a Japanese offensive in an engagement which came to be known as the Battle of the Admin Box. After capturing the defended area of the Mayu Range, operations in the Arakan were curtailed to allow resources to be concentrated on the central front in Assam. Fourteenth Army subsequently concentrated on the advance into Central Burma. XV Corps was removed from Fourteenth Army and directly subordinated to Allied Land Forces South East Asia so that the Corps could conduct an independent campaign through Arakan and down the coast of Burma. When the general offensive began in late 1944, XV Corps captured Akyab Island (with a vital airfield), launched amphibious flanking moves to intercept and defeat the retreating Japanese troops, and subsequently captured the Burmese port of Taungup and the islands of Ramree and Cheduba. Finally, units of the Corps mounted Operation Dracula, an amphibious assault on Rangoon, the Burmese capital. Rangoon was found to have been abandoned by the Japanese. Following the capture of Rangoon, XV Corps was again subordinated to Fourteenth Army and was withdrawn from Burma to prepare for Operation Zipper, an amphibious assault to recapture Malaya. However, the operation was overtaken by the Japanese surrender, and XV Corps was disbanded on 1 October 1945. Its headquarters was redesignated HQ Netherlands East Indies Command.Graham Watson, Allied Land Forces South East Asia 1945 , Orbat.com, accessed November 2008 The Netherlands East Indies Command went on to conduct operations in Java, including the Battle of Surabaya.

The area is generally flat, with one large hill named Ol Donyo Sabuk, which means Buffalo Hill in Maasai language. The Maasai of Kenya are nomadic people and they used to bring their animals to graze in these plains, when there were many buffaloes roaming here, hence the name. Colonial settlers evicted many local people and established coffee plantations. The people who chose to stay became squatters and worked on the settlers' coffee farms. After Kenya's independence in 1963, the settlers sold their coffee plantations to the local co-operative societies and left the country. A large part of the area had not been cultivated and so the squatters moved in and sub-divided it amongst themselves.

The 139-second (2m19s) piece is a continuous tracking shot of a frozen moment after an armoured van heist gone wrong, with robbers dressed in clown masks holding a pitched battle with police officers inside a hospital. The campaign surrounding Carousel was led by the central Philips team at DDB in London and produced by advertising agency Tribal DDB in Amsterdam. It was directed by Adam Berg, with production contracted to London-based production company Stinkdigital. The ad went on to become a huge critical success, winning the advertising industry's most prestigious award: the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. It is only the second online advertisement to win in the Film category, after Dove's Evolution in 2007. Scenes from Carousel were used in the music video for hip hop artist 50 Cent's single \\"Ok, You're Right\\". Sequence After a credit sequence, Carousel opens on a police officer kneeling on a parked police car. The camera pans across and travels past an armoured van in mid-explosion. It continues to the entrance of a hospital, where two officers are engaged in a firefight with a criminal in a clown mask, while a further two are dragging a clown out of a station wagon. The camera passes into the hospital to a reception desk, where a clown is kicking an officer through a glass window while others come up behind him. The camera rotates upwards to reveal another clown/officer pair in midair after falling from a balcony above. The camera travels up to the second floor, through an explosion into a corridor filled with clowns and officers, with several civilians cowering against the floor. Passing a ward where more figures are shooting at each other, the camera reaches a clown carrying a sack of cash who has just been shot in the back, before panning right to reveal a team of officers around a man stripped to his underwear. The camera exits the window and returns to ground level, to the pointing officer on the car (revealed to be number 219) at the start. It scrolls past the officer, who hides a clown mask and a sack of cash, revealing that he is in fact one of the criminals. The piece then begins a fresh loop from the beginning. Production Background and filming In January 2009, Philips announced its new Philips Cinema 21:9 line of LCD televisions, promoting them as being the first production television whose proportions matched that of a cinema screen.\\"Philips premieres the ultimate home cinematic viewing experience with the Cinema 21:9 LCD TV\\", Philips (Press release), January 2009. To inform consumers about the product's features, Philips collaborated with their central agency team at DDB in London and advertising agency Tribal DDB in Amsterdam with a request to create an advertising campaign based around an educational websiteClarke, Christine; \\"Nobody Move \\", Boards, June 1, 2009.

Retrieved September 22, 2009. and quickly came up with the idea of a piece composed of a single tracking shot. The team proposed the idea to several production companies, eventually settling on London-based production house Stinkdigital. After consultation with Stinkdigital about the possibility of having the tracking shot move through a frozen moment in time,White, Ed; \\"Stink‚Äôs Adam Berg takes us behind Philips ‚ÄúCarousel‚Äù \\", Boards, April 21, 2009.

Eventually, they settled on the concept of a robbery gone wrong, with the clown-masked robbers escaping through a crowded hospital. The brief created, the team began scouting for locations to shoot the ad. Several hospitals in Prague were looked at, but with a recent outbreak of influenza in the Czech capital, most were unavailable. To speed up the location scouting, director of photography Fredrik Backar and post supervisor Richard Lyons accompanied the recce teams. Eventually, the team discovered an old Communist university which had been converted into a sports college, and gained permission to dress the location as a hospital. An animatic was assembled exactly matching the proportions of the chosen location, though the action itself was made up by Berg as he went along. Tribal DDB had a schedule of seven weeks from the pitching to the end of post-production, and assigned two days for shooting the film itself.Clarke, Christine; White, Ed; \\"Behind Philips \\"Carousel\\" \\", Boards, June 30, 2009.

The path taken through the location was 100 m long, and was broken into seven shots. These were taken on Kodak Vision3 500T 35 mm film stock in an Arriflex 435 camera. Three cranes (a Fisher, a SuperTechnoCrane 50, and a Scorpio) and a motion-controlled rig were needed to produce the range of movement the camera takes through the scenery. Two versions of each of the shots were taken, one at 50 fps (instead of the usual 25 fps) to minimise any motion from the extras,Smith, Nicola; \\"Video advertising \\", New Media Age, July 22, 2009. Retrieved September 22, 2009. and a second \\"clean\\" shot with all extras and suspended vehicles removed, to aid in post-production editing. Post-production and website Even with 90 percent of the final footage and stunts captured in-camera, the post-production work required for Carousel was extensive. An initial telecine transfer was performed by colourist Jean- Clement Soret at The Moving Picture Company in London. The palette for each room was slightly altered to give the illusion of separate spaces,\\"Philips, Carousel \\", Moving Picture Company website, 2009. Retrieved September 22, 2009. and the colour grading was deliberately made \\"flat\\" to make video effects work easier. The footage was then passed to Stockholm-based visual effects company Redrum, where editing and 3D effects work was overseen by Richard Lyons, who had worked with director Adam Berg on his earlier JC Jeans advertisement. The first thing done was to stitch together the seven shots using video editing software Flame and Xpress Pro. 3-D elements such as flying debris, bullets, explosions and muzzle flashes were created by Magoo Studios using 3ds max. Other video effects work included wire removal and set extension. When the work was completed, another telecine transfer was performed to push the contrast and blend the added effects with the live- action footage. Carousel had been intended from the start to be primarily web- based,Maymann, Jimmy; Goodman, Jason; \\"Double Standards ‚Äì Has 'carousel'opened the doors to online film?\\", Campaign, July 24, 2009. Retrieved September 22, 2009. as it was felt that the length and level of violence in the piece were too great for screenings on television to be an option. A microsite was developed for the piece by Stinkdigital for Tribal DDB. Because of the time it would take to buffer a Flash video of Carousel's length, a number of tricks were used to disguise the video's loading time. Buffering begins while users select their internet connection type on a page designed to look like an MPAA certification, and continues through a cinematic title sequence. The length of the title sequence varies depending on the connection speed selected.\\"Film Grand Prix Winner: Carousel \\", Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival website, July 2009. Retrieved September 22, 2009. At certain points during Carousel, viewers can elect to switch to watching one of three short films blended into the tracking shot. When one of the films is selected, the effects which were added in post-production disappear, and the rigging used in production reappears. An actor portraying a member of the cast comes on to discuss an element of the filming or a feature of the product. In the first, the director of photography discusses the lighting techniques used in Carousel. In the second, the director discusses the cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio and interacts with one of the extras. In the third, the VFX supervisor expands on the post-production process, and through a fake video-editing interface alters various aspects of the scene. The scripts for these short commentaries were written by Tribal DDB, with input from Stinkdigital and Redrum. The soundtrack to Carousel was composed by Michael Fakesch. The music was altered for the Philips microsite by Stinkdigital so that, if users chose to move through the film at a different rate or in a different direction, the music would distort to match. Other features of the microsite included an Ambilight feature and the ability to switch at will between 21:9 and 16:9 aspect ratios. Release and reception The release of Carousel was a huge success. In just over two weeks, it had been viewed over half a million times, with visitors to the minisite spending an average of 5m20s watching the film. Of these, 50 percent used one or more of the interactive features of the site. A number of celebrities commented on the quality of the ad; actor Ashton Kutcher pointed followers of his Twitter account to it, and hip hop artist Kanye West referred to it as \\"hands down the best video of the year\\", Media publications made comparisons between Carousel and the opening scenes of the 2008 film The Dark Knight, in which criminals wearing clown masks rob a bank under instructions from The Joker.\\"Top Spots \\", Boards, May 1, 2009.

Soli was the dominion of Rhodes, Persian Empire (Achaemenids), Macedonian Empire, Seleucid Empire, Roman Empire and its successor Byzantine Empire. But after the great earthquake in 528, the city lost its former glory. In later years, the ruins of the city was a part of Umayyad Caliphate, Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, Crusades, Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, Ramadanids, and Ottoman Empire. In the early 20th century, there was only a small village just north of Soli, named after \\"Mezitoƒülu\\", an Oghuz tribe. The town municipality was established in 1968. But after the fast growth in population, the district of Mezitli is established within Greater Mersin and the municipality became one of Mersin intracity municipalities in 2008.  Population  According to 2012 figures the population of Mezitli is 140,326 (68.492 male and 71,834 female citizens). as of 2012 approximately % 14 of Mersin citizens are living in Mezitli.

History The club was founded in 1962 as Hapoel Kiryat Nazareth and competed in Liga Gimel for several seasons, before promoting to Liga Bet at the end of the 1971‚Äì72 season. The club changed its name in 1973 after Kiryat Nazareth gained city status and was renamed Nazareth Illit. The club won 1975‚Äì76 Liga Bet, but, due to the league system restructuring, the club remained in the league system's third tier, which became Liga Alef. In 1978‚Äì79 the club won Liga Alef North division and was promoted to Liga Artzit, then the second tier. In 1983‚Äì84 they finished second from bottom, and were relegated to Liga Alef. Two seasons later the club finished second from bottom in Liga Alef and dropped to Liga Bet. In 1998‚Äì99 the club finished as runners-up in Liga Alef North, and was promoted back to Liga Artzit, which was now the third tier following the formation of the Israeli Premier League in 1999. After narrowly avoiding relegation in 2000‚Äì01 when they finished one place above the relegation zone, the club finished as runners-up the following season, and were promoted back to the second tier. In 2003‚Äì04 they finished as runners-up (on goal difference), and were promoted to the top division for the first time in their history. In their first season in the Premier League the club finished fifth. Home matches were initially played at Maccabi Ahi Nazareth's Ilut Stadium, whilst their home ground had floodlights installed. They returned home in February 2005. However, the following season, 2005‚Äì06, they finished second from bottom (on goal difference), and returned to Liga Leumit. In 2007‚Äì08 they finished bottom of Liga Leumit, and were relegated to Liga Artzit. Despite only finishing seventh in Liga Artzit in 2008‚Äì09, F.C. Nazareth Illit were promoted back to Liga Leumit as restructuring meant the top seven clubs were automatically promoted. Since then, Nazareth Illit hasn't been relegated for 3 consecutive seasons, finishing seventh in 2009‚Äì10, 11th in 2010‚Äì11 and twelfth in 2011‚Äì12. In the 2012‚Äì13 season the club signed several new players, including Ibrahim Basit, Eran Malchin and Moti Malka; they finished second in the league, but lost 3‚Äì1 at home in a crucial match against Hapoel Ra'anana in the play-offs,Three on top: 3‚Äì1 for Ra'anana over Nazareth Illit Best Ball, 26.4.2013 with Ra'anana eventually promoted to the Israeli Premier League, whilst Nazareth Illit finished third and remained in Liga Leumit. In 2018‚Äì19 the club finished the regular season at the top of the table, but a collapse during the playoff phase, with the club collecting just 7 points out of 21, led the club to finish in third place and miss out on promotion.

MORPETH Biography Sir Douglas was born in Perth, Scotland and educated at George Watson‚Äôs College in Edinburgh. On leaving school in 1942, he volunteered for the army and subsequently served in the Royal Artillery in India, Burma and Malaya. He was demobilised in 1947 with the rank of Captain. He attended the University of Edinburgh from 1947 to 1949 where he graduated with a business studies degree. While at the University, Sir Douglas met Anne Rutherford Bell whom he subsequently married in May 1951, after which they moved to London. In 1951 he joined the Honourable Artillery Company (\\"HAC\\"), the oldest regiment in the British Army, and commanded the 1st Regiment HAC, Royal Horse Artillery, from 1964 to 1966. He was appointed Master Gunner within the Tower of London in 1966, a position he held until 1969. He was awarded the Territorial Decoration (\\"TD\\") in 1959. Sir Douglas qualified as an English chartered accountant (rather than a Scottish Chartered Accountant as the Scottish Institute had decided not to shorten training contracts for ex-servicemen) and joined George A. Touche & Co (now Deloitte), one of the few accounting firms in the UK at that time with international presence in the United States and Canada. He was made a Partner in 1958 and was appointed its Senior Partner in 1977, a position he held until his retirement from the firm in 1984. During his time as a partner, Sir Douglas played a significant role in growing the original firm of George A Touche & Co which when he retired was known as Touche Ross & Co and is now known as Deloitte. Sir Douglas became a member of the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1964 and served as President of the Institute (the youngest to be appointed at that time) in 1972. Soon after joining the Council, he was appointed Chairman of the Institute‚Äôs Parliamentary and Law Committee, which dealt with Company Law and Taxation. He started a campaign to simplify the tax system, which had become complicated by several new taxes introduced by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer. This campaign was successful and the Chancellor set up a Tax Reform Committee to which he was appointed. At his suggestion, the law was changed to allow property left to a widow in her husband‚Äôs will to be free of inheritance tax and he was also instrumental in the campaign to introduce the separate taxation of husbands and wives - which up until that point had been aggregated as one. He was one of the originators of the Accounting Standards Committee (\\"ASC\\") - whose objective was to develop definitive standards for financial reporting - and at its inception was appointed Vice Chairman. He was Chairman of the Institute‚Äôs Overseas Relations Committee for several years and which led to his becoming a key member of the International Accountants' Study Group and ultimately its Chairman. In 1972, as President of the Institute, he was instrumental in the founding of the International Accounting Standards Committee (\\"IASC\\") in London. The IASC was responsible for developing International Accounting Standards and promoting the use and application of these standards across the world. At the end of his Presidency of the Institute he was asked to join the CBI and chair the Tax Committee, but resigned after three years to become Chairman of the Inflation Accounting Steering Committee. This was required to produce a new accounting standard to set out how companies should prepare their accounts taking into consideration the level of inflation, which at the time was high and detrimental to business. This was adopted as SAP16 after a great deal of controversy and over 4 years work for the committee between 1976 and 1980.\\"British Tax-Law Change A Boon to U.S. Concerns; British Tax-Law Shift a Boon\\" By ROBERT D.

While as President he helped found a livery company. He persuaded the Council of the Institute to authorise it and, with the help and authority of the City of London, the Worshipful Company of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales was created with full livery status in 1976. He was Senior Warden in 1976, Master in 1977/8 and served as Senior Past Master. On retiring from Touche Ross & Co (now Deloitte) he was the first Chairman of the Trustees of the British Telecom Pension Fund, Chairman of Clerical Medical and General Assurance Group, director of the Allied Irish Bank, and director of several other companies before finally retiring at the age of 75. He was the honorary Treasurer of the Royal College of Music from 1981 to 1996 and was awarded a Fellowship of the Royal College (FRCM). Sir Douglas was a resident of Shamley Green in Surrey for over 50 years.

Geography The pass is a gateway that connects the Little Karoo and the Great Karoo, through a gorge with a 25 km road crossing the same river 25 times in the span of the 25 km. It runs between the modern town of Klaarstroom in the north, and the town of De Rust in the south. The mountains it crosses are those of the Swartberg range (Afrikaans for black mountain). The Swartberg is amongst the best exposed fold mountain chains in the world, and the pass slices through magnificently scenic geological formations. The Swartberg chain runs roughly east‚Äìwest along the northern edge of the semi-arid area called the Little Karoo in the Western Cape province of South Africa. To the north of the range lies the large semi-arid hinterland of South Africa, the Great Karoo. Much of the Swartberg is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Geological Journeys. Norman, N. and Whitfield, G. 2006 The over 2000 m high Greater Swartberg range in the distance, viewed from farmlands near the town of Oudtshoorn in the relatively well-watered south. History Early crossings Great Swartberg mountain range, seen from the south in stormy weather. The vast Great Swartberg mountain range formed an almost impenetrable barrier for much of the subcontinent's history - separating the Little Karoo in the south, from the Great Karoo of the arid southern African hinterland. The indigenous Khoi- San people had long inhabited the valleys on both sides of the range, and undoubtedly made successful crossings of these mountains. However these journeys were unfortunately not recorded. In 1800, a farmer from De Rust in the south made the first successful recorded crossing of this point of the range. His name, Petrus Johannes Meiring, was later commemorated in the name of the pass. Eventually, using the river's low point, he and Gerome Marincowitz, another farmer from the north of the range, even opened up a tiny bridle path, along the \\"Groote Stroom\\", which enabled the most intrepid travellers to journey through the mountains. In the coming years, Meiring was extremely active in building the campaign for a pass across the Swartberg. The route View of the Swartberg Mountain barrier from Klaarstroom in the arid north The great road engineer Thomas Charles John Bain View of a portion of the pass The Herrieklip, Meiringspoort The pass itself had its origins in a series of petitions from the local people on both sides of the mountains, and in the Molteno report, which ordered the pass's construction in response. John Molteno was an Italian immigrant farmer, who had just been elected to represent much of the Great Karoo region in the new Cape Parliament. In August 1854 he set off on horseback from the village of Beaufort West, together with the two great road engineers Thomas and Andrew Geddes Bain and a friend, Charles Pritchard. After several days journey the four riders reached the Swartberg, and they then spent considerable time exploring the valleys and mountains of the range. Among other routes, they made a crossing along the route that the current road follows. The Bains favoured a more eastern pass through the Swartberg, along the slopes they had explored in the Toorwater Poort. It was an easier, more efficient crossing to construct for engineering purposes, however it was 50 km east, which would have meant an extra 4 or 5 days travel for every journey across the mountains. Molteno's report therefore chose the route of the current pass. It created a select committee in 1856, which allocated funds, led to the surveying of the chosen route, and the employment of a team of paid labourers (not convict labour as was common at the time). The report envisioned the pass as a means of connecting the underdeveloped Karoo hinterland with the port at Mossel Bay, thereby stimulating exports from the hinterland and the overall Karoo economy.G. Ross: Romance of Cape Mountain Passes. New Africa Books. 2004. . p.89.L. Nell: The Great Karoo. Struik. 2008. p.94. Construction The initial allocated budget of ¬£5,000 was at the time considered vastly insufficient, but in the end the project costed only slightly more, at ¬£5,018. The likely possibility of frequent flood damage to the completed road in the ensuing years also needed to be considered. Construction commenced in August 1856, supervised by Adam de Schmidt, and under the overall management of the Bains. It was on this project that Andrew Geddes Bain developed his revolutionary technique for breaking up and cutting through large boulders. The first stage of building required the clearing of vegetation. He discovered that piling the recently cleared vegetation onto the rock and burning it caused the necessary heat to split the rock up. This was helped further by pouring cold water on the heated rock afterwards. The technique meant that blasting became rarely necessary. The pass was also the first major project of the young Thomas Bain. Once commenced, the entire 16 km pass was completed in only 223 days of work, opening on 3 March 1858. A procession of 50 carts, 12 wagons and 300 horsemen crossed it for the opening, and Andrew Bain suggested the name of \\"Meiring\\" for the pass, in honour of the farmer, Petrus Meiring.Meiringspoort - South African Mountain PassesMeiringspoort and Swartberg Nature Reserve Effects Mossel Bay, the intended port and harbour for the Karoo hinterland The initial report had conceived of the pass as a way of connecting farmers and businesses in the southern African hinterland, with the port at Mossel Bay. A measure of its success was that Mossel Bay's port structures had to be expanded almost immediately, to cope with the massive growth in exports. By the 1870s, in spite of the frequent repairs from flood damage, one eighth of the country's entire export wool produce was being transported through the pass.

The Royal Navy ordered Avon Vales construction three months after the outbreak of the Second World War. John Brown Shipbuilding & Engineering Company Ltd laid down her keel at their Clydebank yard on 12 February 1940, as Admiralty Job Number J1569. After a successful Warship Week national savings campaign in February 1942, Avon Vale was adopted by the civil community of Trowbridge, Wiltshire. Career Early operations Avon Vale began her career on convoy duty in the North Western Approaches with the Irish sea force. The destroyer was worked up at Scapa Flow with ships of the Home Fleet in March, being redeployed with the Irish Sea Force for convoy defence in Irish Sea in April. In May 1941, the Avon Vale was nominated for service in Gibraltar, where she was deployed for convoy defence with the destroyers and . In July, Avon Vale was deployed for escort duties in a Malta convoy GM1, which consisted a passage through the Western Mediterranean as part of Operation Substance. On 17 July the destroyer joined another convoy, WS9C, with the destroyers Eridge, Farndale and . Together the destroyers escorted the troopship , forming Convoy GM1, carried servicemen to Gibraltar before taking passage to Malta. On 20 July the destroyer sailed from Gibraltar to join Force X as escort through the Sicilian Narrows to Malta with , , , the cruiser , the destroyers , , , the destroyers forming Force H at Gibraltar, as well as Nestor, Eridge and Farndale. On 23 July the convoy found itself under close air attacks from Sardinian airfields, during which Manchester and were damaged and withdrawn from the operation. Service in the Eastern Mediterranean Avon Vale was detached from the convoy to escort the damaged Manchester on her return passage to Gibraltar. During August, Avon Vale was deployed in convoy defence at Gibraltar, from where she escorted Convoy HG72 on 2 September on its passage from Gibraltar to Liverpool, along with the destroyers Nestor, and the sloop . Avon Vale was then nominated for service in the eastern Mediterranean, taking passage through Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean, joining the flotilla at Alexandria in November. The destroyer was then deployed for support of the Tobruk garrison. On 27 November Avon Vale was deployed with the sloop as escorts for the merchantman SS Hanne taking supplies of munitions to Tobruk. The ships were attacked by the German submarine , which torpedoed and sank Parramatta. Avon Vale rescued the only twenty survivors from the sloop. On 30 November Avon Vale escorted another convoy, AT1, to Tobruk with the escort destroyer . The convoy was made up of the armed boarding vessels and the merchantman SS Kirkland which carried petrol. On 2 December the destroyer arrived at Tobruk with AT1, sailing back from Tobruk with Farndale on 5 December as convoy TA1. The convoy found itself under air attacks, during which SS Chakdina was sunk. Chakdina was carrying prisoners of war, amongst them General Ravenstein, who was rescued by Farndale. In January 1942, Avon Vale continued in her operations in support of Tobruk. In February, the destroyer was deployed with , , , , Eridge and Heythrop of the flotilla in convoy defence duties in the eastern Mediterranean. On 12 February Avon Vale formed part of the escort for Convoy MW9A, with the cruiser , destroyers , Heythrop and Eridge, which found itself under heavy and sustained air attacks on 13 February. Action in the Mediterranean On 20 March the destroyer joined the escort for Convoy MW10 to Malta, with Carlisle and ships of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla, which was covered by cruisers and destroyers of Mediterranean Fleet. On 22 March the convoy sustained dive bombing attacks, the whole movement done under threat of surface action with Italian heavy units including the battleship and three cruisers. Avon Vale sustained damage during these air attacks, and further damage was done after she was involved in a collision. The engagement by the covering force was able to prevent a full attack on the convoy. On 29 March Avon Vale was nominated for return to the United Kingdom for repairs. The destroyer met escort duties for the damaged cruiser during the patched cruiser's passage from Malta to Gibraltar. In April the destroyer left Gibraltar for Falmouth, where she was taken in hand at a commercial shipyard. Repairs and escort duties From May to June the destroyer was under repair, carrying post repair trials in July; during this period Avon Vale was nominated for service by the Western Approaches Command for the defence of convoys to and from Western Africa. After completing her work-up process, the destroyer joined Western Approaches Command for convoy defence. From August to September the Avon Vale was transferred to Freetown in continuation of her services. In October, Avon Vale began Atlantic convoy defence duties in continuation from Freetown. On 20 October she joined military convoy WS23, departing from Freetown with the cruiser , and the Greek destroyer Kanaris as escort during part of the passage to the Cape of Good Hope. On 23 October the destroyer detached from WS23 upon being relieved by the sloop and the cruiser , returning to Freetown. Avon Vale then passed to Gibraltar to escort military convoys before the allied landings in North Africa. On 8 November Avon Vale joined the Central Naval Task Force to support the landings at Oran. The destroyer was then released for convoy escort duties, a role which was carried out all through December in support of military operations in North Africa. Further damage In January 1943, Avon Vale was transferred to the 59th Destroyer Division, joining the escort destroyers , Farndale and at Gibraltar for convoy defence duties in the western Mediterranean. On 29 January Avon Vale suffered major damage after she was hit by an aerial torpedo, which destroyed the whole of the bow structure of the destroyer. The aft section was towed back to Gibraltar by the escort destroyer . Temporary repairs were carried out in February to ensure Avon Vale could be towed back safely for permanent repairs. In February the passage had to be deferred until a suitable convoy was available. From March to May the destroyer was deployed at Gibraltar awaiting tow, until she was towed back to the United Kingdom on 25 June as part of convoy MKS15. Avon Vale arrived in the UK on 7 July and was taken in hand for repair at HM Dockyard Chatham on 22 July. The forward structure was rebuilt, the whole repairs taking from August to December. The destroyer was under refit between January and March 1944, when she was nominated for transfer to the Royal Hellenic Navy, to be renamed the HHMS Aegaion. However, this transfer was not carried out because of the mutinous conduct of Greek mariners which manned Royal Navy units at Alexandria. In April Avon Vale carried out her post repair harbour trials, which were completed on 14 April with the commencement of the destroyer's sea trials. In May, upon completing the trials, and achieving worked-up service, the destroyer was nominated for convoy escort duties during the allied landings in Normandy. On 6 June Avon Vale was deployed at Portsmouth as part of Force L. The destroyer sailed from Solent with the escort of the Follow-up Convoy L1 from Nore. This escort was made up of the trawler and the 143rd MMS Flotilla. Back to the Mediterranean In July the destroyer was deployed for convoy defence. In August she was taken again under repairs in a Tyne commercial shipyard, from where she was nominated for service with the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean. Upon completing these repairs, Avon Vale took passage to join the flotilla at Alexandria. In September she was deployed with the flotilla in the Eastern Mediterranean, taking part in a number of operations to occupy several islands after the surrender of Italy. Avon Vale was then transferred to the Adriatic for convoy defence, patrols and in support of shore operations. While being deployed with , on 1 November, Avon Vale engaged German surface craft south of the island of Lussino, sinking the torpedo boat , and the corvettes UJ202 (Heinz Trautwein) and UJ208 (Klaus Wenke), and rescuing some of the survivors in Action of 1 November 1944. In December the destroyer was nominated for service in the East Indies after a refit in the United Kingdom. In January 1945 the Avon Vale joined the 16th Destroyer Flotilla, based at Harwich, pending her refit prior to service in the Indies. The refit was arranged at the port of Taranto, Italy. The destroyer was taken in hand for refit in March, which was completed in May. Upon completing the refit, the destroyer returned to the United Kingdom, for pay off and the recommissioning for her service overseas. The recommissioning occurred in June, while a work-up for operational service in the Mediterranean was carried out in July. In August the deployment was cancelled, and Avon Vale returned to the United Kingdom for pay off and a reduction to reserve. Post war status Avon Vale paid-off at Devonport, and was laid up in reserve at Plymouth on 10 December 1945. The destroyer was transferred to the Sheerness Reserve Fleet after a refit at HM Dockyard Sheerness in 1949. When Sheerness Division was closed, Avon Vale was transferred to Hartlepool and laid up there until placed on the Disposal List. The destroyer was sold to BISCO in 1958 for demolition by TA Young at Sunderland. Avon Vale arrived in tow at the breaker's yard on 15 May of that year.

It is widely attributed to the Filipino national hero Jos√© Rizal, who supposedly wrote it in 1868 at the age of eight. There is no evidence, however, to support authorship by Rizal and several historians now believe it to be a hoax. The actual author of the poem is suspected to have been the poets Gabriel Beato Francisco or Herminigildo Cruz. Prominence The oldest known copy of the poem appears in Kun sino ang kumath√¢ ngÃÉ \\"Florante\\": kasaysayan sa buhay ni Francisco Baltazar at pag-uulat nang kanyang karunungÃÉa't kadakilaan (1906) by Hermenigildo Cruz. Note that the poem uses the Philippine Commonwealth-era Tagalog spelling with a 'K'. If Rizal had indeed written it, it should have used the phonetically equivalent Spanish 'C'. The poem was widely taught in Philippine schools to point out Rizal's precociousness and early development of his nationalistic ideals. A passage of the poem often paraphrased as Ang Hindi marunong magmahal sa sariling wika, masahol pa sa hayop at malansang isda (English: 'He that knows not to love his own language, is worse than beasts and putrid fish') is widely quoted to promote the use of Tagalog among Filipinos. It is encountered most frequently during the Buwan ng Wika ('Language Month'), a commemoration of the establishment of the Filipino language as the national language of the Philippines. Publication history No manuscript for \\"Sa Aking Mga Kabat√†\\" written in Rizal's handwriting exists. The poem was first published in 1906, a decade after his death, in a book authored by the poet Hermenigildo Cruz. Cruz claimed that he received the poem from another poet, Gabriel Beato Francisco, who in turn received it in 1884 from an alleged close friend of Rizal, Saturnino Raselis. Jos√© Rizal, however, never mentioned anyone by the name of Saturnino Raselis.Hermenegildo Cruz (1906) (in Tagalog) Kun Sino ang Kumath√¢ ng ‚ÄúFlorante‚Äù, Kasaysayan Ng B√∫hay Ni Francisco Baltazar at Pag-uulat Nang Kanyang Karununga‚Äôt Kadakilaan. p. 188 Ang tulang it√≥ ay utang ko sa kaibigan kong si G.

Ang gino√≥ng it√≥ ay isang matalik na kaibigan ni Rizal na siyang nagkaloob sa kany√° (sa gur√≤) ng isang salin nitong tul√¢, tand√¢, d√Æ uman√≥, ng kanilang pagka-katoto. The poem may have actually been written by Cruz or Francisco. Pascual H. Poblete published a different account in his introduction to the 1909 translation Noli Me Tangere; Novelang Wicang Castila Na Tinagalog Ni Pascual H. Poblete (note old Tagalog spelling), he claims that the poem was well-known to Filipino poets during Rizal's childhood. This account was later repeated in Austin Coates' 1968 biography of Rizal, Rizal: Philippine Nationalist and Martyr, who further added that Juan Luna had a role in preserving the poem. This is not substantiated by any known evidence. The earliest known poems of Rizal in the National Historical Institute‚Äôs collection, Poes√≠as Por Jos√© Rizal, also date six years after the alleged writing date of \\"Sa Aking Mga Kabat√†\\". His own account of the earliest awakening of his nationalistic views, identifies it as the year 1872 ‚Äì the year of the executions of the priests Mariano G√≥mez, Jos√© Apolonio Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora.Jos√© Rizal to Mariano Ponce (April 18, 1889; 18 Rue de Rochechouart, Paris). Without 1872 there would not be now either a Plaridel, or Jaena, or Sanciangco, or would there exist brave and generous Filipino colonies in Europe; without 1872 Rizal would be a Jesuit now and instead of writing Noli me t√°ngere, would have written the opposite. At the sight of those injustices and cruelties, while still a child, my imagination was awakened and I swore to devote myself to avenge one day so many victims, and with this idea in mind I have been studying and this can be read in all my works and writings. The poem is never mentioned by Rizal himself in all of his writings, despite its apparent significance in terms of his future ideals. Authenticity Historian Ambeth Ocampo, National Artist of the Philippines and writer Virgilio S. Almario and others have debunked Rizal's traditional authorship of the poem based on the following: The poem uses the Tagalog word kalayaan (liberty/freedom). However, Rizal first encountered the word at least by 1882, when he was 25 years old ‚Äì 17 years after he supposedly wrote the poem. Rizal first came across kalayaan, or as it was spelled, kalayahan, through a Tagalog translation by Marcelo H. del Pilar of Rizal's own essay El Amor Patrio. The fluency and sophistication of the Tagalog used in the poem also do not match Rizal's grasp of the language. Although Rizal's native tongue was Tagalog, his early education was all in Spanish. In the oft-quoted anecdote of the moth and the flame from Rizal's memoir, the children's book he and his mother were reading was entitled El Amigo de los Ni√±os, and it was in Spanish. He would later lament his difficulties in expressing himself in Tagalog. In 1886, Rizal was in Leipzig working on a Tagalog translation of Friedrich Schiller's William Tell, which he sent home to his brother Paciano. In the accompanying letter, Rizal speaks of his difficulty finding an appropriate Tagalog equivalent of Freiheit (freedom), settling on kalayahan. Rizal cited Del Pilar's translation of his own essay as his source for kalayahan.Jos√© Rizal to Paciano Rizal (October 12, 1886; 40-11 Albertstrasse, Leipzig). I lacked many words, for example, for the word Freiheit or liberty. The Tagalog word kaligtasan cannot be used, because this means that formerly he was in some prison, slavery, etc. I found in the translation of Amor Patrio the noun malay√°, kalayahan that Marcelo del Pilar uses. In the only Tagalog book I have ‚Äî Florante ‚Äî I don't find an equivalent noun. Rizal also attempted to write Makamisa (the intended sequel to El filibusterismo) in Tagalog, only to give up after only ten pages and start again in Spanish. The 8-year old Rizal's apparent familiarity with Latin and English is also questionable. In his memoir as a student in Manila, a year after the poem's supposed writing date, he admitted only having 'a little' knowledge of Latin from lessons by a friend of his father. Rizal also did not study English until 1880, more than ten years after the poem was allegedly written. English was not a prominent language in the Philippines in 1869 and its presence in the poem is believed to betray later authorship during the American Commonwealth of the Philippines. The poem also makes use of the letters 'K' and 'W', whereas during Rizal's childhood, Tagalog spelling was based on Spanish orthography where neither letters were used. The letters 'C' and 'U' were used instead (i.e., the poem would have been spelled \\"Sa Aquing Ma√±ga Cabata\\"). The shift in Tagalog and later Filipino orthography from 'C' to 'K' and 'U' to 'W' were proposed by Rizal himself as an adult, and was later made official in the early 20th century by the Philippine government as per grammarian Lope K. Santos's proposal. Translation abakada in Baybayin, a native script of the Tagalog language. This script is perhaps alluded to by the author in the last stanza of the poem.

History  The reason for its founding was to cover the needs of the refugees after the 1974 Turkish invasion. Archbishop Makarios III Lyceum (Dasoupolis Lyceum) was established in 1978 in Nicosia. Originally the school functioned as a gymnasium (middle school) from 1978 to 1983. From then on up to 1986 it functioned as a gymnasium and a lyceum. Since 1986 it functions only as a lyceum. It is one of the biggest lyceums in Nicosia with around seven hundred students enrolling every academic year and one hundred staff. During the academic year 2014-15 the old building pulled down and a new, modern one was inaugurated. The newly constructed building.  Students' Activities   Publications  Teachers were always interested in cultivating to the students the respect to democracy and freedom of the press.

It supports general aviation with no commercial airline service scheduled. History Dreux airport was built in the 1920s as a grass airfield. In the 1930s it was upgraded to include two concrete runways, a primary 02/20 at 1692 m (5500 ft) and a secondary 12/30 at 1354 m (4400 ft). In addition, a control tower, terminal and a hangar provided services to passengers and aircraft. French use during World War II The French Air Force Arm√©e de l'Air used Dreux during the Battle of France. The Polish squadron G.C. I/145 was transferred north from Lyon Mions Airport to Dreux Vernouillet Airport during the later phases of the Battle of France. I/145 operated Caudron CR.714 fighter planes in air defence roles until France was over-run and Dreux was seized by the Germans in June 1940. Caudron CR.714 fighter plane of Groupe de Chasse I/145, June 1940 German use during World War II Seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the Battle of France, Dreux was used as a Luftwaffe military airfield during the occupation.

KG 51 was a fighter/bomber unit, and along with SKG 10 and JG 3, attacked Eighth Air Force daylight heavy bomber raids over Occupied Europe and Germany. Largely due to its use as a base for Fw 190 interceptors, Dreux was attacked by USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound general-purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) American use It was liberated by Allied ground forces about 21 August 1944 during the Northern France Campaign. Almost immediately, the USAAF IX Engineering Command 840th Engineer Aviation Battalions began clearing the airport of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft, and repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. Pierced Steel Planking was laid down over some filled in bomb craters on the main runway and it became fully operational for combat aircraft.

The C-47s pulled gliders in the airborne assault across the Rhine (Operation Varsity). After the war, the airport was returned to French civil control. Cold War With the outbreak of the Cold War in the late 1940s, negotiations began in November 1950 between NATO and the United States to establish air bases and station combat wings in France to meet European defense needs. During the negotiations for selection sites, the airport at Dreux was proposed by the United States for expansion into a modern NATO air base. However, the French government rejected the airfield at Dreux, citing the expansion of Orly Airport near Paris presenting a conflict with airspace traffic, and plans were in the works to expand Vernouillet into a commercial site. A completely new NATO airfield was eventually built near the village of Dampierre, about 10 miles to the west, to accommodate the United States Air Force as a tactical airlift base. That would become Dreux-Louvilliers Air Base (1955‚Äì1967).McAuliffe, Jerome J. (2005). US Air Force in France 1950-1967.

Current As mentioned before, with the expansion of Orly Airport, air traffic congestion became a severe problem and it was decided to close Dreux airport. The airport was torn down and its runways and other concreted areas removed.

Traditionally, it includes dermatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, reconstructive surgery and plastic surgery. It includes both surgical procedures (liposuction, facelifts, breast implants, Radio frequency ablation) and non-surgical procedures (radio frequency skin tightening, non surgical liposuction, chemical peel, high-intensity focused electromagnetic field, radio frequency fat removal), and practitioners may utilize a combination of both.International Association for Physicians in Aesthetic Medicine, IAPAM. Aesthetic medicine procedures are usually elective.  Statistics  *Worldwide, there were 20 million aesthetic procedures performed from 2014-2015. Cosmetic surgery is a major driver of medical tourism. In February 2018 the president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons said operations were performed on people who were not appropriate for surgery, and that unscrupulous practitioners have endangered their health for profit and that the cost of rectification for more than 1000 patients a year fell on the British National Health Service. *Countries that performed the most aesthetic procedures in 2014 were *In the US, there were more than 11 million aesthetic procedures performed from 2012-2013, and 83.5% of the procedures were nonsurgical. *In the UK, there were 50,000 cosmetic surgery procedures performed in 2013-2014. *Surgical aesthetic procedures account for 10% of the cosmetic procedures in the UK, and non surgical techniques constitute the remaining 90%. *In the US, the top 5 surgical aesthetic procedures were 1) Liposuction 2) Breast augmentation 3) Blepharoplasty 4) Abdominoplasty 5) Rhinoplasty *In the US, the top 5 nonsurgical aesthetic procedures were 1) Botulinum Toxin 2) Hyaluronic acid 3) Laser hair removal 4) Microdermabrasion 5) Photorejuvenation *In South Korea, there were more than 980,000 aesthetic procedures performed from 2014-2015. *In South Korea, the top 5 surgical aesthetic procedures were 1) Blepharoplasty 2) Rhinoplasty 3) Fat Grafting 4) Rhytidectomy 5) Hair Transplantation  Indications  Aesthetic medicine specializes in altering cosmetic appearance. It has diverse applications for dermatological and surgical conditions. It includes indications related to minimizing signs of aging such as skin laxity, wrinkles, and liver spots. Aesthetic medicine also plays a role in the treatment of excess fat, cellulite and obesity. Laser based therapies can be indicated for the treatment of scars, unwanted hair, skin discoloration, and spider veins.Medical Aesthetics Clinical Skin Protocols 2014 It is important that overall health is assessed by a physician to ensure that the symptom being treated (for example, weight gain and excessive hair) is not a sign of an underlying medical condition (like hypothyroidism) that should be stabilized with medical therapies. It is also very important for the medical aesthetician to be inclusive in providing a team approach for minimally invasive facial aesthetic procedures.

A multidisciplinary or team based approach is often necessary to adequately address an aesthetic need. To perform certain procedures, one must be a surgeon, medical doctor (Dermatologist/plastic surgeon/ENT surgeon/Oculoplastic surgeon) or maxillofacial surgeon /Cosmetic Dentist. However, many of the procedures are routinely performed by trained Medical Aestheticians or facial aesthetic nurse-aestheticians nurses. For example, Medical Aesthetician can perform progressive chemical peels. Medical Aesthetics requires specialized training and certification beyond a nurse license / aesthetic license. Counselors, psychologists or psychiatrists can help people determine if their reasons for pursuing aesthetic procedures are healthy and help to identify psychiatric disorders such as compulsive eating, anorexia, and body dysmorphic disorder. Reconstructive surgeons can help correct appearance after accidents, burns, surgery for cancer (such as breast reconstruction after mastectomy for cancer), or for congenital deformities like correction of cleft lip. Orthodontists work to improve alignment of teeth, often partially for aesthetic reasons, and oral and maxillofacial surgeons can perform cosmetic facial surgery & correct deformities of the mouth and jaw. Both orthodontists and maxillofacial surgeons can be assisted by dental technicians. American Aesthetic Association (AAA) provides aesthetic diploma courses such as cosmetic gynecology, hair transplant, etc. for physicians and surgeons to enhance their medical practice. Aesthetic Medicine is often a subset of other practices of medicine, for example a family physician who is board certified by the (AAFP) American Academy of Family Physicians, may also offer aesthetic medicine treatments. Often physicians such as these will join multi-specialty associations, like the AAAM (American Academy of Aesthetic Medicine), IAPAM (International Association for Physicians in Aesthetic Medicine) or ASLMS (American Society for Laser Medicine & Surgery) to further their education.

Jones records and produces the majority of his material by himself in the home studio in his bedroom. The VBS (Voluntary Butler Scheme) uses the technique of live looping at gigs, playing in parts on various instruments such as guitar, guitar synthesizer, drums, kazoo and ukulele. The debut album At Breakfast, Dinner, Tea was released on 7 September 2009 on Split Records. Singles from the album have been championed by the NME, BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 6, and XFM, and The VBS has played sessions for Huw Stephens, Marc Riley, Dermot O'Leary and Jon Kennedy. Declared \\"one to watch\\" in publications as diverse as Q and The Sun, and Suggs declared himself a fan, stating in an interview that \\"they are a very good band\\".  Biography  The Voluntary Butler Scheme came about in 2008, when a chance spotting on MySpace led to Rob Jones being asked to play a gig in Birmingham. He went ahead, playing six songs to a crowd of about 12, and subsequently decided that he no longer wanted to play with bands and that The VBS was the path he wished to follow. Since 2008, The Voluntary Butler Scheme has toured with Duke Special, Joe Lean & the Jing Jang Jong, Brakes, Jason Lytle (Grandaddy) & Adam Green. In July 2008 The Voluntary Butler Scheme did a session on the Dermot O'Leary's BBC Radio 2 show - performing \\"Trading Things In\\" and a cover of \\"Build Me Up Buttercup\\".  Debut album  The Voluntary Butler Scheme's debut album At Breakfast, Dinner, Tea was recorded in a month- long stint at a studio in Stockwell, with producer Charlie Francis (known for his work with REM and the High Llamas) and a handful of guest musicians. At Breakfast, Dinner, Tea has gained much attention with regard to the unusual and quirky lyrics. Q says \\"The lyrics of longing about running shoes, coffee, MP3 players and turning vegetarian are clearly quite daft but utterly endearing\\". A BBC Music Review states that Jones \\"has a wicked line in witty lyrics\\", and The Daily Growl commends his \\"quaintly observational everyday lyrics\\". The line 'wear a De La Soul t-shirt once in a while to make you feel more hip hop than you are' has even been put onto VBS merchandise T-shirts. Rob states of his lyrics, \\"I think it's about not trying too hard... You know, I read something Phil Spector said in some sound magazine, about the recording of \\"Be My Baby\\", and asking, 'Is it dumb enough? Are people gonna get it?' I'm not trying to make it dumb, but there's something in that - stuff feels so much more honest when it's simple.\\" The single \\"Trading Things In\\" contains the lyric \\"yes we can listen to La Bamba on your mp3 player\\". Mexican folk song \\"La Bamba\\" is one of Rob's all time favourites, though he states \\"I don't even know what the guy's singing about... it really doesn't matter. The way he sings it ‚Äì it just breaks your heart. And I remember thinking, oh, I can probably just talk about whatever I've been up to that day and it'll work.\\" The song \\"Trading Things In\\" was used on Grey's Anatomy in 9 October.

Before long, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) must fire several employees to save money, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) takes on new responsibilities, and Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) wheels and deals to spare her staffers from layoffs. Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) suspect that Kenneth is masking a deep dark secret. This episode of 30 Rock featured a number of cultural references to the legal crime thriller film The Pelican Brief (1993), and Liz Lemon parodying Steve Jobs's attire while giving a presentation. \\"Cutbacks\\" has received generally positive reception from television critics. According to the Nielsen ratings system, the episode was watched by 6.8 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 3.1 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot The TGS with Tracy Jordan crew have finished taping their fiftieth episode and decide to celebrate. Their boss, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), goes to the writers' room and tells the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), about how the whole company is undergoing cutbacks. After an unsuccessful presentation about TGS, Brad Halster (Roger Bart)‚Äîone of the consultants in charge of the cutbacks‚Äîinforms Liz that she needs to cut her annual budget by 25 percent. Liz, anxious about her employees losing their jobs, decides to use sexual bartering to solve the problem and asks Brad on a date, which he accepts. Liz dresses in the trashiest outfit she can find, and goes on her date. The next day, she discovers that cutbacks are still taking place at TGS, and confronts Brad. Realizing that he was being used, Brad charges Liz with sexual harassment and she is suspended from work for two weeks. Jack tells Liz that the budget review process will start over again, this time under his supervision. Meanwhile, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) becomes Jack's office assistant, replacing his former assistant Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy). Kenneth asks Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to feed his bird, as he is busy with two jobs now. Kenneth asks Tracy not to enter his bedroom, a request that makes Tracy curious. Believing Kenneth might be a serial killer, he tells Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and they decide to investigate Kenneth's bedroom. At Kenneth's apartment, they discover a bug bomb in his room, and reaching the conclusion that Kenneth is trying to poison them and they run out of his apartment. They forget to close the door and the bug bomb ends up killing the bird. When they tell Kenneth about his bird, he is more upset by the fact that Tracy and Jenna did not trust him, than the death of his bird. Tracy and Jenna, feeling horrible about what they have done, arrange a surprise for Kenneth at his apartment. When Kenneth goes home, he finds an entire collection of birds. Production \\"Cutbacks\\" was written by supervising producer Matt Hubbard (pictured). \\"Cutbacks\\" was written by series supervising producer Matt Hubbard, making it his seventh writing credit after \\"The Rural Juror\\", \\"Hard Ball\\", \\"The Collection\\", \\"MILF Island\\", \\"Reunion\\", and \\"Larry King\\". The episode was directed by Gail Mancuso, making it her sixth for the series. \\"Cutbacks\\" originally aired in the United States on April 9, 2009, on NBC as the seventeenth episode of the show's third season and the 53rd overall episode of the series. This episode of 30 Rock featured a guest appearance from actor Roger Bart, who played a man from a consulting firm in charge of the cutbacks in the 30 Rock workplace. Television announcer Don Pardo guest starred as Sid, the TGS announcer. Pardo was the announcer on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006. Fey and Tracy Morgan have both been part of the main cast of SNL. This was actor Todd Buonopane's second appearance as the character Jeffrey Weinerslav, an NBC Human Resource mediator. In this episode, Jeffrey informs Liz that a sexual harassment lawsuit has been filed against her for sexual bartering. Buonopane appeared in \\"Believe in the Stars\\" and later in \\"Jackie Jormp-Jomp\\". One filmed scene from \\"Cutbacks\\" was cut out from the airing. The scene was included on 30 Rock‚Äôs season three DVD as part of the deleted scenes bonus feature. In the scene, Kenneth is instructed by Jack to only interrupt his firing meetings if something important comes up. Kenneth believes that getting Showtime for three months from Time Warner Cable is something he should bring up to Jack, but Jack informs him that getting Showtime does not qualify as something important. Cultural references In this episode, Liz parodies business magnate Steve Jobs's (pictured) attire while giving her presentation about TGS. Throughout the episode, references are made to the 1993 legal crime thriller film The Pelican Brief. Kenneth tells Jack \\"I feel like I'm in The Pelican Brief. Do I already know too much?\\" after Jack explains to Kenneth what to do as his assistant. Later, Jack tells Liz to make her budget cuts, with Liz replying \\"What? That's it? I thought you'd tell me to cook the numbers or shred something or do some Pelican Brief stuff.\\" Finally, Tracy and Jenna decide to investigate Kenneth's apartment, which leads them to compare themselves to actors Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts, the two leads from the movie. In one scene of \\"Cutbacks\\", Liz parodies business magnate Steve Jobs's clothing attire while giving her presentation about TGS to Brad. Later, Tracy goes to Jenna with his suspicions that Kenneth might be a murderer. Jenna tells Tracy that she has knowledge when it comes to serial killers after playing a criminal profiler‚Äînamed Jill St. Ferrari‚Äîin an original Lifetime miniseries Hushed Rapings. When Tracy and Jenna go to Kenneth's apartment, they go to his bedroom and see a bug bomb in his room, which prompts Tracy to say \\"Oh no, Kenneth's a killer, and the Riddler is coming!\\", the latter is a reference to the comic book villain who leaves behind riddles, puzzles, and word games so that they can be solved. Star Wars is frequently referenced in 30 Rock, beginning with the pilot episode in 2006 where Tracy is seen shouting that he is a Jedi. Liz admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens, and while trying to get out of jury duty in Chicago and New York. Star Wars is also referenced when Tracy takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. In this episode, the TGS crew tells Liz \\"Do something Liz, you're our only hope\\", in regards to the cutbacks. This line was said by Princess Leia in the Star Wars movies, in which she was played by actress Carrie Fisher, who guest-starred in the season two episode \\"Rosemary's Baby\\". Tina Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference \\"started happening organically\\" when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference \\"in almost every show\\". Fey said that from then on \\"it became a thing where [they] tried to keep it going\\", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a \\"pretty high batting average\\". Fey attributed most of the references to executive producer and writer Robert Carlock, whom she described as \\"the resident expert\\". At the end of the episode, when Kenneth enters his apartment and sees all the birds given to him by Jenna and Tracy, he declares he has some naming to do. The last two birds he names \\"Lorne\\" and \\"Michael\\", a reference to the executive producer of Saturday Night Live, Lorne Michaels, who is credited on the screen during the line. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Cutbacks\\" was watched by 6.8 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It received a 3.1 rating/8 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, meaning that 3.1 percent of all people in that group, and 8 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. This was a decrease from the previous episode, \\"Apollo, Apollo\\", which was watched by 7.2 million American viewers. IGN contributor Robert Canning opined that \\"Cutbacks\\" was \\"solid\\", as it \\"included all the major players in familiar roles and provided some great laughs.\\" Canning complimented Roger Bart's performance noting that he played the part \\"very straight until the very end.\\" In regards to the Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth plot, he said that the overall ending was \\"a bit weak\\" but \\"the majority of the story worked well.\\" In conclusion, Canning gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10 rating. Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club noted that this episode was \\"broad as hell, with three incredibly whoopsie plot threads all driven by one of the most venerable office sitcom tropes (budget cuts), but it was redeemed not only by being funny as hell at its best, but by letting the unlikability of some of the main characters ‚Äì sometimes inadvertent, sometimes not, provide some of the strongest laughs in 'Cutbacks'.\\" Entertainment Weekly‚Äôs Margaret Lyons said that despite this episode not being \\"one of the show's most sophisticated [ones]\\" she still enjoyed it, citing that it had \\"some pretty fantastic lines ‚Äì and some really cute moments between Liz and Jack.\\" Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad said that \\"Cutbacks\\" was a \\"funny episode\\", but stated that he disliked Liz's actions, explaining that what she did was \\"creepy.\\" Sassone did not enjoy Tracy and Jenna believing that Kenneth was a murder \\"because of a wacky series of misunderstandings and assumptions\\" observing that this scenario has been played out \\"in every other sitcom since 1989.\\" Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger reported that he was \\"very unsatisfied\\" with this episode, though, noted that he preferred Liz's plot over Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth's. Overall, Sepinwall said that the episode was \\"meh\\".

Today this rule is widely used in educational research to evaluate the effect of class size on students' test scores. Maimonides' rule states that a class size may rise to an upper limit of 40 students. Once this quota is reached the class is cut in half, so instead of one class with forty-one students there are now two classes: one with twenty students and one with twenty-one students. Joshua Angrist and Victor Lavy (1999) have used \\"the nonlinear relationship between the local number of students and the class size predicted by Maimonides' rule to estimate the impact of class size on student performance, and evaluate the effect of being just below the number of students for whom an additional teacher would be brought up, and of being just above this number.\\" Their results have shown highly irregular patterns in class size that are precisely mirrored in student achievement.

Accessed 27 Mar 2012. He contributed several entries to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, wrote articles for music journals and magazine, notes for CDs, and published a number of books on music, both collected published annotations and new writings. Life and career Born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland), Steinberg left Germany in 1939 as one of the Kindertransport child refugees and spent four years in England. He immigrated to the United States in 1943 with his brother and mother and earned a degree in musicology from Princeton University (the classical-music scholar and pianist Charles Rosen was his roommate). After Princeton, he lived two years in Italy on a Fulbright scholarship, followed by a two-year stint in Germany with the U.S. Army. Once this posting ended, he became a faculty member of the Manhattan School of Music, where he taught music history. Steinberg taught at several colleges in New York and Massachusetts before he became music critic for the Boston Globe in 1964. His time with the Globe was not without controversy. While Steinberg was lauded for his writing, the high standards by which he gauged the performances he reviewed caused friction with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. At one time, the orchestra's members voted to ban Steinberg from attending its concerts. However, after almost 12 years with the Globe, he became program annotator for this orchestra. In 1979, he worked as publications director and artistic advisor for the San Francisco Symphony; he stayed until 1989. He was program annotator for a number of other orchestras during his career, including the New York Philharmonic and the Minnesota Orchestra, the latter of which he served as artistic advisor during the 1990s. In a 1995 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Steinberg said he saw his role as a critic and annotator as someone \\"building bridges and helping to create contact between listeners--nonprofessional listeners for the most part--and music.\\" Steinberg died in Edina, Minnesota, at the age of 80.Euan Kerr, Music writer Michael Steinberg dies, Minnesota Public Radio, 26 July 2009Janos Gereben, In Memoriam: Michael Steinberg, San Francisco Classical Voice, 27 July 2009Michael Steinberg remembered, Los Angeles Times, 26 July 2009 Bibliography *Steinberg, Michael, The Symphony (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1995). . *Steinberg, Michael, The Concerto (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998). . *Steinberg, Michael, Choral Masterworks: A Listener's Guide.

In 1845, an inheritance was settled on him, and when he turned 21, he set out to see the world. It is also speculated that he was one of the sons of Peter Borthwick, a descendant of Baron Borthwick, but there is no evidence to substantiate this claim. Work and life Borthwick traveled in Canada in 1847, south to New Orleans, and then northwards as far as New York, where he lived for some time, until he was struck with gold fever in May 1850, and quickly moved to California. He crossed the Isthmus of Panama at Chagres on a small sailing ship from Panama City, where he stayed until the spring of 1851, reaching San Francisco in the summer of that year. He traveled in gold rush California from 1851 to 1854, eagerly observing and sketching every ethnic group he met.Three Years in California, John David Borthwick, pp. 166-118 - William Blackwood & Sons, Edinburgh, 1857 A lithograph of a typical 19th century Chinese-American mining camp In 1853, he left for Nicaragua on his way to the Atlantic seaboard, then to Australia, and finally to Scotland via Panama in 1856. That year, Borthwick returned to Edinburgh and began organizing his notes for publication, and his paintings were exhibited in several galleries, including the Royal Academy. In 1857, he published materials from his California travels in Harper's Weekly, in California Magazine, and the reminiscence of his adventures in a book called Three Years in California. This book, which offers descriptions on mining techniques, personal interactions, transportation, crime, holidays, hotels and restaurants, entertainment of the social life of the era and the growth of California. It focused on his experiences and encounters in gold camps such as Sacramento, Coloma, Nevada City, Placerville, Downieville, Jacksonville, San Andreas and Sonora. It is considered one of the most entertaining and accurate depictions of the early Gold Rush period, and remains one of the classic first-person accounts of the Age of Gold in America. Borthwick illustrated his book with eight of his own lithographs, depicting card games, dances, mining operations, and Chinese emigrants. His attention to detail and his engaging portrayals are considered one of the most realistic representations of the time. Between 1857 and his death in 1892, he resided in Paddington, London, England. Borthwick's gambling kit A travel gambling kit that belonged to Borthwick was featured on the History show Pawn Stars. An expert deemed the kit authentic to the period and estimated the value at somewhere between $7,000-$10,000. The owner of the kit decided not to sell the item after learning this. However, the kit included 1880 era features, including royal flush artwork (not a feature of poker until the 1870s) and an 1880 revolver. The Pawn Stars episode refers to him as a professional gambler, but there is no evidence that he ever pursued gambling as a livelihood.\\"John David Borthwick, artist of the Gold Rush,\\" R. E.

This is considered an economically important species in the Indo-West Pacific, where it is usually collected both for food and for shell trading.Poutiers, J. M. (1998).in: FAO Species Identification Guide for Fishery Purposes: The living marine resources of the Western Central Pacific Volume 1. Seaweeds, corals, bivalves and gastropods. Rome, FAO, 1998. page 492. The map cowry was named on the basis of its distinct color pattern, because of the longitudinal lines and the easily distinguishable and sinuous mantle groove, which creates a resemblance to ancient maps.  Taxonomy  Leporicypraea mappa was previously subordinated into the genus Cypraea. In the currently most accepted taxonomy of the Cypraeidae by Lorenz & Hubert (2000), this species is considered to be within the genus Leporicypraea, with several subspecies. Recently, the division of this taxon in two or even three nominal species based on morphological and molecular characters has been suggested.  Subspecies  Subspecies of Leporicypraea mappa include according to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS):WoRMS : Leporicypraea mappa; accessed 19 October 2010] *Leporicypraea mappa admirabilis Lorenz, 2002 *Leporicypraea mappa aliwalensis Lorenz, 2002 *Leporicypraea mappa mappa (Linnaeus, 1758) The Indo-Pacific Molluscan also includes:ONIS Indo-Pacific Molluscan Database. retrieved 13 September 2010 *Leporicypraea mappa rosea (Gray, 1824) *Leporicypraea mappa panerythra (Melvill, 1888) *Leporicypraea mappa viridis (Kenyon, 1902) *Leporicypraea mappa geographica (Schilder & Schilder, 1933)  Shell description  Dorsal view of a shell of the map cowry, Leporicypraea mappa. The anterior end is towards the bottom Comparing the color pattern of the shell of Leporicypraea mappa (left) and an ancient Chinese topographic map (right) The maximum shell length of this species is up to 10 cm, but it more commonly grows up to about 8 cm. The shell of Leporicypraea mappa is globose, with a near elliptical, slightly elongate outline. In affinity to other Cypraeidae, the aperture of the shell is very narrow, and relatively long. Both the inner and outer lips are ornamented with arrays of small teeth, though the teeth of the outer lip are shorter and stronger in comparison to the teeth of the inner lip, which are thinner and more numerous. Its dorsal side is normally inflated, while the ventral side of the shell is slightly concave. The shell is colored white or cream, with several longitudinal brown lines, which are sometimes interrupted by circular empty spaces. The cursory dorsal mantle groove line is dissimilar to the shells general color pattern, completely devoid of lines, thus easily perceivable. Its sinuous appearance, with several branches and notches, makes it a diagnostic character for this species. This exotic color pattern gives an appearance similar to that of ancient maps, hence the specific and common names. Both the ventral side of the shell and the labral teeth may vary greatly in color, assuming shades of white or cream, or even purple, brown, orange or pink.Chicago Natural History Museum Bulletin. Vol. 28, no. 4, April 1957. Page 3.  Distribution  A map of the distribution of Leporicypraea mappa Leporicypraea mappa is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific. It is present in many regions, including East Africa, Madagascar, southeastern Red Sea, eastern Polynesia, southern Japan, Australia and New Caledonia. This exceptionally wide range may possibly be an artifact. Some conchologists claim that the taxonomy of the species is poorly resolved; if the map cowry is discovered to be cryptic species complex, then this could drastically change the range of its distribution. Ecology Habitat The map cowry lives in the intertidal and sublittoral zones, usually in coral reef areas, dwelling under slabs and stones at depths of 45 m. Human uses The flesh of the map cowry is edible, and it is commonly collected by local fishermen for food and shell trading wherever it occurs. It is sold in fish markets in the northern Philippines. The shells of Cypraea mappa (as it was previously known) were considered rare, exotic and beautiful, and were highly prized by private shell collectors in the late 1950s.

He was a colleague and friend of such famous scientists as the physicists John Randall and Maurice Wilkins; he had just finished the book he had been writing for the last few years, Dr. Groer and The General's Hat, about the history of Poland and the discovery of E. coli, when he died at his home in Chelsea, London, where he lived for many years in later life, on 24 July 2009 after battling what his doctors said, shortly before he died, was motor neurons disease, for about a year. He had previously been married to Dr. Jane Chomet, n√©e Janina (Jane) Rosita Friedman (Lwow, Poland, 10 March 1934 ‚Äì 19 February 1994; married 1957 [marriage dissolved 1972]). He is buried in a Jewish cemetery, run by the United Synagogue, in Bushey, on the outskirts of North West London. For the last 35 years and more of his life, he formed a partnership and marriage with Christine, his second wife and stepmother to his two sons and one daughter, Julian, William and Ann. Birth and education He often spoke with great pride about the beauty and architectural splendour of Drohobycz but retained bitter memories of the anti-Semitism that was prevalent in Poland at that time. When the war started, he was left with a friend of his mother as his parents were forcibly taken by the Russians to serve as doctors in the army. It was through this friend's immense act of kindness and bravery that he was able to hide for most of the war and survive the horrors that enveloped Poland during the 1940s. After the war he escaped to England, where he was soon joined by his parents who set up a medical practice in Stamford Hill in North London. While in his mid teens, they sent him to a \\"yeshiva\\", a Jewish seminary, run by an orthodox Jewish movement known as the \\"Lubavitch\\". But soon after he ran away, with the intention of becoming a tailor, never to return. His father tracked him down and made sure he got down to some serious studying which eventually took him to study physics at what was then known as Regent Street Polytechnic. From there he went to do research at what would become his intellectual home for most of his life: King's College London. His intellectual excellence was recognised early on with the offer of a lectureship while still a postgraduate. He became a passionate and dedicated teacher and mentor to many science students during his 40-year tenure. Many of his former pupils remember him as someone who could make a physics lecture fun and entertaining. Academic career While a postgraduate student he had been witness to the behind-the-scenes events of one of the greatest scientific adventures of modern time. Maurice Wilkins was the leader of the King's biophysics team whose work made a major contribution to the discovery of the structure of DNA which ultimately became the bedrock of all modern genetics, including the mapping of the human genome. Wilkins shared a Nobel prize for his efforts and subsequently formed a mutually respectful relationship with Chomet, whose continuous prompting led Wilkins to write an autobiography and give his version of arguably the most important scientific discovery of the last 100 years. He was appointed demonstrator in Physics at King's in 1956, lecturer in 1963; he subsequently retired in 1987, returning part-time as a visiting lecturer.KCL \\"Comment\\", the College newsletter; Issue no. 189, September 2009 He was justifiably proud to be associated with King's DNA 'legends' and in the 1993 organised a highly successful 40th anniversary commemoration of the 1953 discovery and subsequently published a sought after book of the proceedings. Anyone who went to King's had his seal of approval; he was fiercely proud of his students, of fellow scientists, doctors, graduates, academics, and alumni from King's. He would always be able to come up with an expert who was either down the corridor or preferably a former pupil of his who had gone on to excel in their chosen field to answer to a question Away from his dedication to teaching science, he translated numerous cutting edge scientific research papers and text books from Russian into English both during and after the height of the cold war, but he had never formally studied Russian as a language. He was very supportive of Russian scientists who were trying to work in the West. He was really a true polymath: a physicist, author, journalist, historian, publisher. When he was not teaching students he was writing articles for The Times on all sorts of science subjects or writing restaurant reviews for New Law Journal. He also probably held the world record for the greatest number of letters published in The Times newspaper on all sorts of subjects, he had maybe 101 published. With Christine, his partner who would later become his wife, he even found time to stage conferences for audiences as diverse as funeral directors and dentists, and publish several niche books such as Why Is British Architecture So Lousy? For someone who rarely had a drink and could not play a musical instrument, he was an expert on wine and classical music. He was a frequent contributor to Physics World magazine\\"Interactions\\", the Institute of Physics newsletter; November 2009 and his obituary subsequently appeared in \\"Interactions\\", the monthly newsletter to members of the Institute of Physics. Post academic career On retiring from lecturing at King's, he turned his intellectual rigour from physics to history. What followed was an acclaimed biography of one of Queen Victoria's daughters, Princess Helena. His detailed research led to a unique collection of Royal material which led to an audience with the Queen, and some photographs of them in discussion; the book was called Helena, A Princess Reclaimed. Soon after was another hugely forensic literary effort as he uncovered the secrets of how a Frenchman conned his way into 19th- century royal circles by pretending to be a count. When his consultant recently told him he had a serious illness, Chomet's main concern was whether he would have time to finish writing his current book, fortunately he managed it. Although he was not an overtly religious man, he had a huge respect for the traditions for Judaism, his roots and the huge pain and sacrifices of his ancestors. In 1990, he wrote and published a book entitled Outrage at Auschwitz. The introduction was written by Immanuel Jakobovits, who at the time was the chief rabbi of British Jewry. That book and its message had a significant impact. It restated the sanctity of Auschwitz as a Jewish cemetery, a holy place that must not be desecrated. He was completely adamant about this and drew on the expert knowledge of religious scholars, both Jews and others, to explore why a Carmelite convent had chosen to build on the site of Auschwitz. His book, also supported by Sir Sigmund Sternberg, a notable figure in British, Jewish and European society, helped build a case to persuade Pope John Paul II, the \\"Polish Pope\\", to have the convent removed from Auschwitz. It also helped secure an apology from the Pope for the anti- semitism meted out by the Catholic Church to Jews over centuries. The motivation for writing the book may have been a school friend of his who probably perished at Auschwitz. He was committed to ensuring that the sanctity of this place where his friend and the hundreds of thousands of others were murdered would remain intact. Auschwitz was also a Polish town. Its real name, before the Nazis took it over, was actually \\"Oszienchem\\". He also did other mitzvahs, good deeds, of which we know very very little about. He often went about it in his own quiet way on a grand scale and sometimes on a smaller scale too. Another of his personality traits was his intellectual sense of humour which had a rather unusual range. He was once overheard at a dinner party sharing jokes about superstring theory with two of Britain's top scientists, jokes that probably only a handful of people could understand, let alone laugh at.

All are operated by the Aquariums Division of the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources since 1976 and are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. All three aquariums feature dive shows, live animal encounters, and feeding programs. North Carolina Aquarium at Fort Fisher Sign for the aquariumThe focus of the North Carolina Aquarium at Fort Fisher, in Kure Beach, is to educate visitors about the waters of the Cape Fear region. The aquarium was recently named among the Best Aquariums in the United States by the Travel Channel and is one of the Top Ten Attractions in North Carolina. The Cape Fear Conservatory, the visitor's first stop in the aquarium, features freshwater life. In this large, tree-filled atrium, streams, ponds and swamps are home to frogs, snakes, bass, catfish, and perch. Box turtles hide among the Conservatory's groundcover. American alligators native to North Carolina occupy one of the larger exhibits in the Conservatory. An albino alligator exhibit opened in 2009. In 2006, the aquarium opened an exhibit featuring the venomous snakes of the region, including several species of rattlesnake, copperheads, and cottonmouths. The Coastal Waters Gallery, which includes the Coquina Outcrop Touch Pool, provides hands-on opportunities to learn about sea urchins, horseshoe crabs, whelks, and other creatures of a rocky outcrop surf zone. Masonboro Inlet Jetty features the fishes common around a wave-washed rock jetty, an indoor salt marsh, a sea horse habitat, and a loggerhead sea turtle display. The Open Oceans Gallery includes Sharkstooth Ledge, which features fish common to offshore North Carolina, such as pufferfish, hogfish, and filefish. The gallery also displays octopus, jellyfish, and corals native to the state's waters. A new multimedia suite features an extinct whale-eating shark called Megalodon. This exhibit, opened on July 1, 2011, includes projections on a 23-ft curved screen, as well as interactive holograms and touch-screen interfaces. Holding , Cape Fear Shoals is the largest of the aquarium's saltwater exhibits. The -deep replica of an offshore reef affords two-story, multi-level views of large sharks, stingrays, groupers, and moray eels. The Spadefish Sculpture outside the main entrance of the North Carolina Aquarium at Fort Fisher. The Exotic Aquatics Display features animals native to Indo-Pacific and other ocean regions. These displays include spiny lobsters, the red lionfish (Pterois volitans), and a North Carolina native, the spotted scorpionfish. They are both known for their inconspicuous, venomous spines. Lionfish are native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but in 2000 were confirmed as having established themselves in North Carolina. Australian spotted jellies, recently invasive in U.S. coastal waters, are among the gallery's newer exhibits. In June 2012, the aquarium opened the Bamboo Shark Touch Pool exhibit which allows visitors to touch live bamboo sharks. Bamboo sharks are considered harmless to humans and the aquarium hopes to educate visitors about sharks through interaction. The Pacific Reef Display features living corals, giant clam, anemones, cardinalfish, hawkfish, clownfish, wrasses, surgeonfish, and nearly a dozen other fish species. Expansion The facility closed in November 1999 for a major expansion and reopened in March 2002. The new construction increased the size of aquarium systems from to . The expansion included the creation of the Cape Fear Shoals tank, a exhibit recreating the hard bottomed coral reefs off the coast of North Carolina.  North Carolina Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores Since reopening, the North Carolina Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores has continued to feature aquatic animals of North Carolina. Notable among them are sand tiger sharks, a green moray eel measuring about six feet long, a goliath grouper approaching four feet, and a number of sizable nurse sharks, sandbar sharks and various game fishes. Most of the larger creatures inhabit the aquarium's centerpiece exhibit, the Living Shipwreck. Along with hundreds of schooling fishes and other animals, they create a swirl of constant motion around a replica of U-352, a German submarine that lost a World War II battle with a Coast Guard cutter off the North Carolina coast.Hall, Martha and Tabbie Nance. Insider‚Äôs Guide: North Carolina‚Äôs Central Coast and New Bern. 2007. Page. 104. The aquarium's three river otters also have lived up to expectations of stardom. With the help of the public, two were named Neuse and Pungo after North Carolina rivers. Neuse and Pungo came to the aquarium when they were about a year old in 2006. Eno, the third otter, was brought to the aquarium at four weeks old in April 2008, after his mother was killed by a car near White Lake. Aquarists bottle-fed him until he could trade formula for fish and other solid food, and helped him learn to swim. Now he's strong, healthy, energetic and playful. Wide viewing windows bring their playful antics and underwater agility to child-eye-level, and the lively pair enchants people of all ages. Nimbus at The North Carolina Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores, December 2011 The North Carolina Aquarium also features two hands-on exhibits: the Tidal Touch Pool, featuring a large variety of aquatic invertebrates, and Skate and Ray Encounters.Hall, 2007 On August 11, 2010, a rare white sea turtle was brought to the aquarium for care. Nimbus, as the turtle was named, was weak and smaller than the average loggerhead hatchling. It turned up when a hatched-out Pine Knoll Shores nest was excavated for baby turtles left behind. Hampered by a cleft palate, it had to be coaxed into eating. It lagged behind in growth, also, but appears to be catching up with other hatchlings of the same age. Nimbus is on exhibit in the Tidal Waters Gallery. The turtle is something of a rock star at the aquarium ‚Äî especially with visiting school groups. Throughout the year the North Carolina Aquarium offers free daily programs, including: live animal programs, animal feeding presentations, a \\"Live Dive!\\" show, puppet shows, quiz games and hands-on activities. A number of special activities are available for a small fee. In the summer, beginning June 1, the North Carolina Aquarium offers snorkeling, surfing classes, night treks to search for nesting sea turtles, on board collection and river cruises, kayaking and canoeing excursions, and fishing courses. Kayaking, canoeing and fishing programs continue into the fall, when seafood cooking classes are also offered. Behind-the-scenes tours, Dinner with the Critters, and Breakfast with the Rays are offered year-round. North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island entrance to North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island The North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island is a facility located on the Outer Banks. Aquarium visitors are able to explore some of the state's ecosystems and learn about the animals inhabiting them, beginning with Coastal Freshwaters and ending at the Open Ocean exhibit, also called the Graveyard of the Atlantic. This 285,000 gallon, exhibit houses the largest collection of sharks in the state, along with many species of game fishes. It also features a replica of the USS Monitor, a Civil War ironclad which sank off the coast of Cape Hatteras in late December, 1862. Alligators, various species of turtles, fish, and the ever-popular North American river otters are featured in Wetlands on the Edge. One alligator is leucistic, meaning he has reduced pigmentation in his skin. He is mostly white with patches of brown and blue eyes, making Bleu a fitting name. The Sea Turtle Assistance and Rehabilitation (STAR) Center opened to the public on June 27, 2014. The STAR Center is a 3,000 square-foot expansion, allowing staff and volunteers to maintain an excellent level of care for sick and ailing sea turtles. Eight tanks along with an examination room, food prep areas, and storage greatly improved upon the original rehab center. Visitors have the opportunity to see the turtle patients through viewing windows on the tanks and hear their recovery stories from the people who help them every day. When they are fully rehabilitated, the sea turtles are released back into the wild, some with satellite transmitters to track their movements. After learning about sea turtles at the Center, diagnose and care for a replica of an injured sea turtle in the interactive and hands-on exhibit Operation: Sea Turtle Rescue. Touch a stingray, a white-spotted bamboo shark, or a sea star in the Close Encounters exhibit. Free programs are offered every day, and, for an additional fee, guests can see and learn even more about our animals during a behind-the-scenes tour or participate in a camp or other special activity. Stroll along the educational soundside pier, a popular location for wedding ceremonies. The aquarium is equipped to host receptions and other special events, even underwater weddings. Open-water certified divers can participate in the aquarium Shark Dive program and get up-close and personal with sharks in the Graveyard of the Atlantic exhibit. Jennette's Pier In 2002, the NC Aquarium Society purchased Jennette's Pier in Nags Head, the oldest pier along the Outer Banks, with plans to refurbish it as an outreach site. Those plans were put on hold in September 2003, when Hurricane Isabel destroyed the structure. Plans were made to completely rebuild Jennette's as a concrete structure with a pier. $25 million was set aside for construction which began in early 2009. On May 21, 2011, Jennette's Pier was finally reopened to the public.
