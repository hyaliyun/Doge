Description and history The Loring House Apartments occupy a landscaped parcel of in Portland's Nasons Corner neighborhood. It is set on the north side of Brighton Avenue (Maine State Route 258), just east of the point where it crosses Interstate 95. It consists of a cluster of 2-1/2 story brick buildings, with a central 3-1/2 story main building, all linked together by connecting wings. The outer buildings are only modestly styled, with hipped or gabled roofs, and windows set in segmented-arch openings. The main building has more elaborate Colonial Revival elements, including a balustraded porch, and a hip roof with modillioned cornice. A central dormer is filled with a Palladian window. Portland has been providing some sort of facilities for the assistance of the indigent since the 18th century. This property was built in 1902-04 for the \\"convenience and economy\\" of providing such facilities in a single place. This type of facility fell out of fashion in the second quarter of the 20th century, and it was then converted into a hospital, providing subsidized medical services to the city's poor. In the early 1980s it was converted to senior housing.

Among those kings were the Attalids of Pergamon, who occupied a prominent position at the highest point of the Sacred Way, close to the temple of Apollo where they erected their ex votos. Description The highest part of the Sacred Way and the area around the temple of Apollo in Delphi was one of the most prominent positions in the sanctuary and was built at a relatively late date. To the right there is a square situated at a height of 2.5 meters above the temple's level, on a specially made terrace, constructed under order of the king Attalus I of Pergamon (240‚Äì197 B.C.). The square encloses a total surface of about 1000 sq m (measuring 41√ó23 meters) and constituted an extension of the temple area to the east. The western end was delimited by a late archaic treasury which remains to this date unidentified. Initially there were erected four monuments, which are considered contemporary: they comprise a Doric portico covering the northern part of the square (later transformed into a cistern), dedicated by Attalus I and repaired by Attalus II;Roux, G., (1952) \\"La terrasse d'Attale I a Delphes,\\" BCH 76, pp. 141‚Äì196, 184‚Äì185 an \\"oikos\\" (house) in the northeastern corner; the base of a column in the northwestern corner, where the statue of Attalus I stood; finally a rectangular pedestal made of porous stone, of unidentified use. The incomers to the sanctuary entered from the east and those following the Sacred Way entered by means of a staircase starting next to the ex voto of the Rhodians. Slightly later, in 182 B.C., Attalus' successor, Eumenes II, erected a bronze statue of himself mounting a horse, the base of which is still extant today next to the monument of his predecessor.Queyrel, F., (2003),Les portraits des Attalides: Fonction et representation, Biblioth√®que des √âcoles Fran√ßaises d'Ath√®nes et de Rome 308, Paris.

Plot A 12-year-old boy plays a shooter video game in a darkened living room behind blinds, but is surprised when his mother arrives with a box, saying it contains a present for him. She then goes upstairs to answer a phone call. The boy opens the box, revealing an energetic puppy. The boy's delight turns to disdain as he sees the puppy is missing most of its left front leg. Disgusted, he kicks the puppy away and continues his game. Unperturbed, the puppy finds a red rubber ball under a cabinet and clumsily brings the ball to the boy, inviting him to play. The boy does his best to ignore the puppy but is soon won over by its determination and spirit, in spite of himself. The boy shuts off the video game and happily goes outside to play fetch with his puppy, revealing that he walks with crutches and his left leg is missing below the knee.

The PSE was designed to detect vibrations and tilting of the lunar surface and measure changes in gravity at the instrument location. The vibrations are due to internal seismic sources (moonquakes) and external (meteoroids and impacts from the spent S-IVB and LM ascent stages). The primary objective of the experiment was to use these data to determine the internal structure, physical state, and tectonic activity of the Moon. The secondary objectives were to determine the number and mass of meteoroids that strike the Moon and record tidal deformations of the lunar surface. Specification The PSE unit was constructed principally of beryllium and had a mass of 11.5 kg, including the electronics module and thermal insulation. It was housed in a drum-shaped enclosure 23 cm in diameter and 29 cm in height. The enclosure was rounded on the bottom and rested on a leveling stool. The PSE consisted of two main subsystems, a sensor unit and an electronics module. The sensor unit contained three matched long-period (LP) seismometers aligned orthogonally in a triaxial set to measure one vertical and two horizontal components of surface motion. The horizontal component seismometers were very sensitive to tilt and were leveled to high accuracy by means of a two-axis motor-driven gimbal operated by ground command. A third motor adjusted the vertical component seismometer in the vertical direction. A fourth, short-period (SP) seismometer with a resonant period of 1 second measured vertical motion at a peak sensitivity of 8 Hz and a response range from 0.05 to 20 Hz. A thermal shroud and 6-W heater for thermal control comprised the rest of the experiment package. The thermal shroud was aluminized mylar which covered the instrument and the ground surrounding the base out to about 75 cm radially. A gnomon and level sensor were mounted on the top center of the shroud. The shroud was modified slightly from the one used on Apollo 12. Total power drain varied from 4.3 to 7.4 W. Layout of the Apollo 14 ALSEP The seismometers consisted of an inertial mass on a sensor boom suspended by springs and hinges, a capacitor plate and a damping magnet. The LP seismometers could function in a flat-response mode and in a peaked response mode. In the flat response mode, the LP seismometers had a natural period of 15 s. In the peaked-response mode, they acted as underdamped pendulums with a natural period of 2.2 s. Sensitivity to ground motion peaked sharply at 0.45 Hz in peaked response mode with a useful frequency range of 0.004 to 2 Hz. Maximum sensitivity was enhanced by a factor of 6 in the peaked response mode, but sensitivity to low-frequency signals was reduced. All seismometers could detect ground motions as small as 0.3 nm. At tidal frequencies, gravitational acceleration was measured by monitoring the feedback current used to center the seismometer mass. The sensitivity of the instruments was 0.008 mgal. The lunar surface impacts of the spent S-IVB and LM ascent stages were used as external calibration sources for the seismometers. The known mass and velocity of these stages at surface impact and the lunar impact point coordinates enabled the computation of energy generated at impact and the point of energy application. (The calibration characteristics were determined by measuring seismometer response to these energy sources.) Deployment upright=1.1 The seismometers were deployed on February 5, 1971, and operated at reduced gain while the astronauts were on the lunar surface and turned to maximum sensitivity for most of the time after that. The ALSEP central station was located at . The passive seismic experiment was deployed 3 meters north of the central station. At deployment, the LP vertical seismometer was unstable in the flat response mode, so all three LP seismometers were operated in peaked-response mode until 17 November 1976 when the problem was rectified. The gimbal motor operating the leveling for the LP horizontal Y seismometer showed intermittent malfunction. The Apollo 14 ALSEP suffered several periods of loss of signal, in one case for over two months. All data were lost for these periods and commanding of the instruments was not possible. Seismic disturbances were noted throughout the lunar day, but particularly near sunrise and sunset, these were believed to be due to expansion and contraction of the mylar shroud and/or the cable to the central station.

Barnet Jr. and Arthur Reef. Known for creating an international public relations network entitled PR International, which was essentially Barnet & Reef's operating organization abroad, Barnet & Reef worked in the international market until it merged with Harshe-Rotman & Druck in 1964. After a series of mergers in the 1980s, it became part of what is now Ruder Finn. History Barnet & Reef, founded in 1958 by Sylvan M. Barnet Jr. and Arthur Reef, was one of the first agencies to deliver public relations programming internationally. Prior to creating their firm, Reef held many positions in Latin America, the Far East, and Europe, including Germany during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Barnet was the manager of an international newspaper in Paris, the manager of the European Edition of the New York Herald Tribune, and the head of Tribune‚Äôs syndicate and news service in New York. Their first-hand experiences of the fall out of WWII, along with the effects of the Marshall Plan, and the rise of the Iron Curtain in Europe pushed Reef and Barnet into the world of international public relations and spurred the creation of Barnet & Reef. The firm opened with a staff of only fifteen people in 1959. During its prime in the early 1960s, Barnet & Reef boasted associates in 48 different countries. Realizing that creating Barnet & Reef offices in each of the regions would be expensive and impractical, Barnet and Reef created a network called PR International of over 40 personnel worldwide. Barnet & Reef merged with Harshe-Rotman & Druck in 1964. In 1982, Harshe- Rotman & Druck merged with Ruder & Finn, a firm which now operates as Ruder Finn. = Arthur Reef = Arthur (Art) Reef (September 21, 1916 - January 17, 2008) of New York City, is the son of Herman Reef and Eva Reef. Reef is predominantly known as one of the co-founders of Barnet & Reef. Prior to establishing his own public relations firm, Reef worked for Ruder & Finn from 1955 to 1957. At the time Ruder & Finn was a small public relations firm based out of New York. After working at Ruder & Finn, Reef founded Barnet & Reef with Barnet. The two lead Barnet & Reef from 1957 to 1964. In 1964, Barnet & Reef merged with Harshe-Rotman & Druck. After the merger, Reef took an offer from American Metal Climax (now known as AMAX). AMAX did not have any established public relations or communication related departments. Reef worked to create these departments and give them full access to the CEO and decent financial backing. Reef worked under three CEOs of AMAX before returning to consulting for international public relations. In 1994, Reef retired to Florida. = Sylvan Barnet = Sylvan (Barney) Barnet Jr. (August 5, 1919 - January 7, 2015) is best known for co-founding Barnet & Reef with Arthur Reef. He spent his life working heavily in a multitude of facets of international communications including publishing, public relations, advertising, and government. Before his time at Barnet & Reef, Barnet held a position as the General Manager of the European Edition of The New York Herald Tribune in Paris. Barnet then partnered with Reef to lead Barnet & Reef from 1957 to 1964. In 1964, Barnet & Reef merged with Harshe-Rotman & Druck. Barnet went to work for the government after Barnet & Reef merged. He joined the Department of Commerce as Deputy Director of the US Travel Service to promote both international tourism and business development in the US and in 1968 became the Vice President of Public Relations and Area Development at American Airlines. Additionally, Barnet served as Deputy Executive Director of the International Advertising Association before becoming a representative to the United Nations and Vice Chairman of Rotary International where he served as Chair of The NGO Executive Committee, and a member of the NGO Committees on Sustainable Development, and Population and Development. =Notable works= Some of Barnet & Reef's most notable accounts included Dow Chemical and Merck, Sharpe & Dohme International, AMF International, Burlington Hosiery, Goodyear, John Deere, United Fruit, the International Advertising Association, and the U.S. Aid‚Äôs Indian Investment Centre. Their first ever assignment was for AMF International where they helped open bowling lanes in London. While working for their client, Barnet & Reef invited everest mountaineer, Edmund Hillary, to throw the first bowling ball. Another notable account was the newly independent Eastern Nigeria. The IAA contacted Barnet & Reef and they met up with Nigerian chiefs to sign a contract. Barnet & Reef described this account as ‚Äúthe best account ever with fees paid in dollars each year in advance by Barclay‚Äôs.‚Äù =Legacy= Barnet and Reef were awarded the Atlas Awards for Lifetime Achievement in 2004 for their work with the firm and in the creation of PR International.

The main facade is five bays wide, with a central entry with marble floor sheltered by a gabled porch, and a Palladian window above. The interior retains original features from the early 19th century, including hand-forged hinges and latches made by the building's most prominent resident, Jonas Galusha. The oldest portion of the house is the small rear ell, which was built by Galusha in 1783. The front part of the house was built in 1805, supposedly to a design suggested by local master builder Lavius Fillmore. The house was home to Galusha until his death in 1834.

Bova after allegedly speeding and running red lights while driving his wife, who was in labor, to the hospital. His wife later sued Los Angeles for wrongful death, and was represented by Johnnie Cochran, but lost the case. However, the event did help spur the building of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital in South Central.  Life  Deadwyler was born on February 19, 1941 in Gainesville, Georgia. He was the oldest of three children. He met his wife Barbara (nee, Buffington) in Kindergarten and they married in 1960. Shortly after, they moved to Kansas then Chattanooga, Tennessee and finally, Los Angeles. The Deadwylers had two children together. At the time of his death, Barbara Deadwyler was pregnant with their youngest son, Michael.  Shooting  Barbara Deadwyler, Leonard's wife was 8 months pregnant and began experiencing what she believed to be labor pains. Deadwyler tied a white handkerchief to the car's antenna, to signify an emergency, a common sign in Georgia, where the couple had moved from a year earlier. While driving, Deadwyler ran through several red lights while speeding, causing a police chase that began at 108th St. and Avalon Blvd., which he mistook as a police escort. Bova eventually pulled the car over at 60th St. and Avalon, where he approached Deadwyler with his gun drawn and leaned into the car. Bova testified that the car lurched forward, causing his gun to go off and shoot Deadwyler at point blank range. Deadwyler's wife stated that no such movement had taken place and that Bova \\"shot him for no reason.\\"  Investigation and inquest  During testimony, the State proffered that Deadwyler had a .35 blood-alcohol level and was drunk. His widow refuted this, as he had not been drinking and an alcohol level that high would make it very difficult for an individual to function and drive safely at a high speed. Bova testified that the car had lurched forward while the defense argued that it would be near impossible as the car had been parked behind another vehicle. On May 31st, 1966 a coroner's jury ruled Deadwyler's death an accidental homicide, with one juror calling it an \\"excusable homicide.\\" The jury, who deliberated for two hours and thirty-five minutes consisted of eight men and one female. Only one member of the jury was black. At the time, it was the longest inquest over the death of a single individual in the Los Angeles County Coroner's office lasting eight days with testimony from 49 witnesses and 87 exhibits and the first televised inquest in California.

On December 1, 2015, the show was renewed for a second season before the first season aired. The pre-launch renewal is a first for the cable net, which ordered 12 episodes for the second season. On January 5, 2017, truTV renewed the series for a third season of 13 episodes, which began airing on January 14, 2019. The series was canceled on April 24, 2019.Ben Roy on Twitter About Those Who Can't is a half-hour show, based in Denver, Colorado, that follows three dysfunctional teachers, played by show creators Adam Cayton-Holland, Andrew Orvedahl and Ben Roy of the Denver-based comedy troupe The Grawlix. More inept than the kids they teach, they're out to beat the system as they struggle to survive each day on their own terms. Maria Thayer stars as the school librarian with a bubbling passion for life. The show is set in the fictional Smoot High School, named after the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. The show was originally set up for Amazon Studios who paid $50,000 to shoot the pilot. Amazon gave it a script order for 6 more episodes but ultimately did not order it to series.https://deadline.com/2014/12/those-who- cant-pilot-trutv-1201310730/ The show was acquired by truTV as their first- ever full-length scripted comedy and was ordered with 10-episodes. The acquisition was part of truTV's comedy-driven ‚ÄúWay More Fun‚Äù programming initiative. When the show was first created, Cayton-Holland stated they wrote the character of Abbey Logan (originally played by comedian Nikki Glaser), the high-school librarian, as the love interest. Orvedahl stated that in the pilot, Abbey \\"just sort of lived in the library and served only to flirt with Adam‚Äôs character.‚Äù The character and role was revised for the shows run at truTV and Abbey is stated to have become \\"one of the gang\\" with all the characters now on equal footing. The show holds a TV-MA rating due to language and sexually suggestive humor. Its title is a reference to the George Bernard Shaw idiom \\"those who can, do; those who can't, teach.\\" Cast =Main= *Adam Cayton-Holland as Loren Payton. A Spanish teacher who dwells on the fact that he once spent a semester in Spain, Loren is a major hipster who would rather spend his time at brewery openings than in the classroom. Loren is a spoiled and self-absorbed narcissist who grew up with wealthy parents. Adam Cayton-Holland *Andrew Orvedahl as Andy Fairbell. A gym teacher/JV volleyball coach/health teacher, Fairbell has a good heart but his na√Øvet√© and lack of social skills often leaves him on the receiving end of abuse from others as a result. He has been described as a \\"human golden retriever.\\" Andrew Orvedahl *Ben Roy as Billy Shoemaker. Shoemaker is a former high school punk rocker with tattooed arms and massive anger management issues. Separated from his wife, with whom he shares a son, he struggles to reconcile his past as an anti-establishment troublemaker who spent several years touring with his punk band, \\"Capitalist Emulsification,\\" with his adult life as a history teacher and responsible family man. Ben Roy *Maria Thayer as Abbey Logan. The school librarian, who serves as the voice of reason against the other main cast and their schemes but is shown to be just as depraved as the others when pushed. Maria Thayer *Rory Scovel as Principal Geoffrey Quinn. The naive school principal, who is just as incompetent as the teaching staff. Quinn considers \\"cool guy\\" Loren Payton to be his best friend, but it is mostly a one-sided friendship. =Recurring= *Sonya Eddy as Tammy, the secretary to Principal Quinn. She is often the only sensible person in the school, but is largely ignored and ridiculed. Tammy and Loren Payton have a strong mutual dislike. *Kyle Kinane as Rod Knorr, an alcoholic teacher at Smoot. He is rarely sober at school, other than a few short stints of abstinence, and often gets caught up in the schemes of the other teachers.

Often distills cr√®me de menthe and is a big fan of Se√±or Frog's margaritas. *Susie Essman as Leslie Bronn, the school's home ec teacher.

Miller as Uncle Jake, owner of a local pizzeria and Loren's cousin. *Mark Hoppus as Measles, one of Shoemaker's former bandmates, *Michael Madsen as Officer Callahan, the new school police officer, who is revealed to be blind and riding out his service until retirement. *Will Sasso as Coach Irontoe, a former Denver Bronco whom Cattie appoints as new football coach, but is secretly stealing from the school. *Kurt Angle as Coach Joe Donnelly, wrestling coach for a rival school whom Abbey has a crush on.

It was released on July 22, 2008 via Raster-Noton label. Background The word \\"Unitxt\\" means the processing of rhythmic patterns (unit = unit of measurement, element) and information (txt = data, language). The album is the first installment in a trilogy, followed by 2011‚Äôs Univrs and 2018's Unieqav. Alva Noto initiated the Uni trilogy when he was booked to play live at the legendary club UNIT in Tokyo, so the project was started to adapt his music accordingly for the club's unique environment. Reception Dimitri Nasrallah of Exclaim! wrote \\"Unitxt, however, is a major leap forward from both Transform and the kind of glitch music that made headways at the turn of the century. Nicolai is working with more complex arrangements here and he appears more willing to let things get a bit messy, allowing sharp bursts of dissonance to enter the mix. It¬ís fitting that nostalgia for the more serious techno of Mille Plateaux, Max Ernst and Raster-Noton has lately drifted back into the minimal mindsets of new acts like Shed and Stefan Goldmann, artists who find the current club culture a bit too formulaic and crowded to produce anything new. A release like Unitxt is a fitting and timely portrait of an uncompromising master at work\\". Lukas Suveg of Tiny Mix Tapes stated \\"A curious dichotomy exists in Unitxt, the latest album from Carsten Nicolai, a.k.a. Alva Noto. Nicolai‚Äôs work relies on mathematical processes to govern rhythm (rather than traditional sequencers), utilizing machine noises ‚Äî modems, telephones, and fax tones ‚Äî for most of its sounds. On Unitxt, Alva Noto applies these frigid clicks and blips to an innate form of human expression: each track is about 120 bpm, and the rhythms, though often heavily obscured or syncopated, are entirely in 4/4 time ‚Äî the basic ingredients for a dance album\\".

Born in Diviciorii Mari, Cluj County, in the Transylvania region, his parents were Ioan Giurgiuca, a priest, and his wife Pelaghia (n√©e BƒÉie»ôu). He attended high school in Gherla from 1918 to 1923, followed by the literature and philosophy faculty of Bucharest University from 1925 to 1929. He taught high school at Aiud (1929-1931), Uioara (1931-1933), Brad (1933-1934), Cluj (1934-1936; 1939- 1940), Sighi»ôoara (1936-1939) and Bucharest (1949-1965). From 1933 to 1934, he headed Abecedar magazine in Brad, at first with George Boldea and later with Teodor MurƒÉ»ôanu, Pavel Dan, Mihai Beniuc and Grigore Popa. He also worked as an adviser at Editura Miron Neagu in Sighi»ôoara and from 1965 to 1970 was editor-in-chief of Colocvii magazine. Giurgiuca made his published debut in 1925, shortly after high school, with poems in the style of George Co»ôbuc, »òtefan Octavian Iosif and Octavian Goga that appeared in the Turnu Severin magazine Datina. His work also appeared in Universul literar, the Aiud Rom√¢nia literarƒÉ, »öara noastrƒÉ, G√¢ndirea, G√¢nd rom√¢nesc, Tribuna, Gazeta literarƒÉ and Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ. His first book was the 1938 Anotimpuri, followed by Dincolo de pƒÉdure in 1943; both were typical of Transylvanian poetry imbued with nostalgia for the village and for nature. Distraught by Romania's loss of Northern Transylvania in 1940, he set down protests in verse. He was marginalized during the first phase of the Communist regime, and did not publish for over two decades, either because he was not allowed to do so or because he had no wish to practice socialist realism. Poemele verii (1964), C√¢ntece de »õarƒÉ (1967) and Semne pe scurt (1972) were the final three volumes of a poet focused on the euphoria of the sun and elegiac contemplation. Poeme, an anthology that included a few unpublished verses, appeared in 1989. He put together two anthologies of other authors, Poe»õi tineri ardeleni (1940) and Transilvania √Æn poezia rom√¢neascƒÉ (1943). Giurgiuca translated numerous Hungarian authors, including Zsigmond M√≥ricz, K√°lm√°n Miksz√°th, G√©za G√°rdonyi, Istv√°n √ñrk√©ny and J√≥zsef Darvas.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic»õionarul biografic al literaturii rom√¢ne, vol.

Based in Burton-upon-Trent in England, the company was formed by a number of prominent business men in February 1902. Ernest E. Baguley, who had apprenticed in the rail industry with Hawthorn Leslie and Company, and then W. G. Bagnall, saw the potential of the motor car, and in 1901, Baguley designed a steam-engine for a motor car. His employer at the time, Bagnalls, were not interested in the concept, so he left the company and joined the Ryknield Engine Company as manager in November 1902. The company established a factory on Shobnall Road in Burton, and they started producing cars in 1903, offering both petrol and steam engines as options. The company primarily targeted the cheaper end of the market, and produced a 10 horsepower car, with options either as a four-seater, or a light delivery van. This was later supplemented with 15 and 20 horsepower models, and in 1905 one of the 15 horsepower cars was entered into the 1905 International Tourist Trophy by Arthur Clay, and was one of only eighteen cars to complete the endurance race. In late 1905, the company endured financial difficulties, and was eventually sold to Wilfred Clay, who had set up the Ryknield Motor Company in early 1906. In contrast to the cars that had previously been produced, the new company targeted the commercial market. The connections of the Clay family, along with the booming brewery business in Burton-upon-Trent, gave the company a good market for their trucks. They were able to adapt the chassis of the 10 horsepower car to produce a small, one ton, truck, while a larger, 8 litre, 35 horsepower model was manufactured for longer distance journeys. They manufactured an even bigger truck, with a 9.8 litre engine, and trialled a motor bus. However, the company was not particularly successful, and in mid-1910, the company was placed in receivership, and was sold to Baguley Cars, which had both Wilfred Clay and Ernest Baguley on its board, the latter as managing director.

It is loosely based on the strategic board game Diplomacy.Joe White, App Advice, \\"Subterfuge is a Week-Long, Social Multiplayer Like No Other\\", April 5, 2016Ron Carmel, Noel Llopis,\\"Subterfuge: A week long game of strategy and diplomacy \\", February 15, 2016 The game takes place in an underwater world where players use diplomacy and tactics to defeat their opponents.Charlie Hall, Polygon, \\"Subterfuge is the Most Cunning Game on IOS Right Now, Here's How it Works\\", February 19, 2016 It features minimalist art, except for the specialist portraits, which were drawn by Shane Nakamura. Gameplay Subterfuge takes place in real time to allow for diplomacy; an average game lasts for about a week but can be longer or shorter. Despite taking a week to play, the developers claimed the game was still \\"short\\". A game can have anywhere from 2 to 10 players. Diplomacy is highly encouraged in Subterfuge, and players only communicate through in-game messages that can be sent to other players.Chris Priestman, Gamastruta, \\"A Brawl and a Race: Designing for the Long Game in Subterfuge\\", March 25, 2016 This allows for negotiation of strategy and teamwork which is vital for players to win. To win a normal game, a player must gain 200 neptunium, through mines which can be made through the use of combat units. Throughout the game, players fight over outposts spread across the map in an attempt to increase production capacity and rate for combat units. \\"Dominion rules\\" are also available, where instead of getting Neptunium, the goal is to control a certain amount of outposts.How Sneaky: Backstabbing Simulation Subterfuge Gets a Major Update\\", April 5, 2016 =Time machine= Due to the 24 hour nature of the game, Subterfuge does not require a player to be in the game to issue moves (orders); players can instead plan orders in advance using the time machine. This feature allows for complex maneuvers to be performed. The time machine also allows the viewing of past events and a prediction of the future based on player knowledge. The time machine works by letting players go to the time they wish to have the order executed; they then play the game as if it were in the present. When the set amount of time has passed, the order will be carried out, even if the player is not present. Developer Ron Carmel said that he implemented this feature based on previous experience playing \\"Neptune's Pride\\", which lacked this feature, leading to inconvenience.Chris Priestman, Kill Screen, \\"Subterfuge is a Strategy Game for parents and Busy People\\", February 25, 2016 While most players can only schedule four moves using the time machine, players who have bought the full game can issue an unlimited amount of future orders.Ron Rich, Gamezebo, \\"Subterfuge Review: Waiting to Surface\\", April 4, 2016 The time machine also moves forward when you launch a submarine, which shows the player what the map will look like when the sub arrives.

(Nieuwe Generatie Voetbal Bond, English, New Generation Football Association) is a member association of the Surinamese Football Association founded on 1 January 1930. History The N.G.V.B. was founded on 10 August 1924 as the K.V.B. (Kathlieke Voetbal Bond, English, Catholic Football Association), but officially changed their name to the N.G.V.B. on 1 January 1930. The name was an acronym for Nederlandsch Guyana Voetbal Bond (English, Dutch Guyanese Football Association). Together with the S.V.B. they were the top two football associations in the country, and a strong rivalry ensued. The goals of the NGVB were as follows: * To promote association football in Suriname and to play football in Suriname and propagate the various game systems, and to exercise the oversight there of as the official governing body. * To act as governing body and reach Inter-colonial and International agreements in terms of football games in Suriname. * To honor the technical and moral needs of all association members. Prior to the foundation of the Catholic Football Association, there was another Catholic governing body of football in Suriname, namely the Katholieke Sport Centrale (English, Catholic Sports Center). Founded on 25 June 1919, the Catholic Sports Center hosted football matches on the football grounds behind the St. Petrus and Paulus Cathedral on the Gravenstraat. This organization ceased to exist in 1921. The NGBV was the primary representative of association football in Suriname in the beginning years of the Sport. As the first association to travel abroad, traveling to British Guyana in May 1925. The N.G.V.B selection reached its height in the 1930s when players such as Hans Nahar, John Wessels, Holband, Michel Kersout, Imro Schoonhoven, the De Vieira brothers and the De Chehin brothers, represented the association Internationally. The association was commonly called the 'Patro' by the people of Suriname, having brought forth such teams MYOB (Mind Your Own Business), Olympia, Boys, Xerxes, Hallo and SDO. In March 1932, a selection of the N.G.V.B. participated in the Walcot Cup in Guyana, yielding the following results:   The N.G.V.B. won the Walcot Cup in 1931 and in 1932. Goal difference was not taken into account at the time. In May 1936, the N.G.V.B. traveled to British Guiana with a selection of their best players for a series of friendly matches, yielding the following results:      The N.G.V.B. players who participated in the aforementioned games were: A. Drielingen, A. Vieira, Ch. van Aals, M. Holtuin, J. Haakmat, Riboet, J. Tjon Poen Tjoen, M. Kersout, A. Rayman, L. Kluivert, F. Veldhuizen, C. Corte, R. King, F. Gomes, H. Pinas, E. van West, J. Tjon A Tjauw, G. Schoonhoven (capt.) and J. Amo. =National competition= Apart from participating in International tournaments, The N.G.V.B. also organized an annual competition for the national championship, running parallel to the SVB Hoofdklasse, the competition of their rival association. RKVV Olympia won the championship in 1928, while Hallo won in 1929. =Other tournaments= Apart from the N.G.V.B. national competition, the association also organized the Neptune Beker (English, Neptune Cup), the Olympia Toernooi (English, Olympia Tournament) and the Anna Margaretha competition. The Anna Margaretha competition was won by Boys in 1936, and by Mari√´nburg the following year. In 1936 and 1937, NGVB won the Walcot Cup in British Guiana. The winning 1937 selection consisted of the following players: * Drielinger (GK) - (Olympia) * Pinas (DF) - (Surinam) * Vieira (DF) - (Mari√´nburg) * Holtuin (MF) - (Olympia) * Moe (MF) - (Olympia) * Tjon Poen Tjoe (MF) - (Mari√´nburg) * Henricus (FW) - (Mari√´nburg) * Kersout (FW) - (Mari√´nburg) * Schoonhoven (FW) - (MYOB) * Nahar (FW) - (Mari√´nburg) * Veldhuizen (FW) - (Mari√´nburg) On the bench: W. Amo, Suydon, F. Purperhart, Profijt, Cameron, Kersout and Goudmijn. Coaches: J. Wessels and J. Chehin ;N.G.V.B. results at the 1937 Walcot Cup:   Succession Following the foundation of the Surinaamse Voetbal Bond (SVB, English, Surinamese Football Association) in 1920 and their joining of FIFA, the global governing body of football, the rivalry of the two associations intensified, much to the disadvantage of the NGVB, since the SVB were the only Internationally recognized football association for Suriname. The NGVB saw a steep decline in relevancy until 1954, when they joined the SVB as a member association. The NGVB were responsible for hosting tournaments and league games among the youth teams of the various clubs and districts in the country. The name of the association was again changed that year, this time to Nieuwe Generatie Voetbal Bond (English, New Generation Football Association). In 1961, Martin Dongen joined the N.G.V.B, taking full control of managing the youth department. The associations playing field was worn out, and a new facility needed to be built. On Sunday, 4 June 1961 the N.G.V.B. Stadion was opened, and the N.G.V.B. and its functionality within Surinamese football was restored. See also * N.G.V.B.

They defined it as when \\"movement from one item to another is provoked as an artifact of the activity of another or a group of others\\".Dourish, P. and Chalmers, M. (1004). Running out of space: models of information navigation. Proceedings of HCI'94, Glasgow, August 1994. According to later research in 2002, \\"social navigation exploits the knowledge and experience of peer users of information resources\\" to guide users in the information space.Chen, C., Cribbin, T., Kuljis, J., Macredie, R., 2002. Footprints of information foragers: behaviour semantics of visual exploration. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 57, 139‚Äì163. With all of the digital information available both on the World Wide Web and from other sources, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate and search efficiently. Studying others' navigational trails and understanding their behavior can help improve one's own search strategy by helping them to make more informed decisions based on the actions of others.Dieberger, A. et al., Social Navigation: Techniques for Building more Usable Systems. Interactions (Nov. - Dec 2000), 37..45. \\"The idea of social navigation is to aid users to navigate information spaces through making the collective, aggregated, or individual actions of others visible and useful as a basis for making decisions on where to go next and what to choose.\\"Svensson, H√∂√∂k, Coster - Designing and Evaluating Kalas: A Social Navigation System for Food Recipes Prior to advancement of Web 2.0 and the Social Web, the World Wide Web had been a solitary space where users did not really have knowledge of where anyone else was browsing and navigating at the same time or different times. Social navigation can help to give users a sense of social presence. The scope of research on social navigation has been increasing especially as information visualization improves. Displaying social information in virtual spaces allows the modeling of user behavior to make digital systems feel more social and less solitary.  Supporting theories and techniques  The concept of social navigation is supported by several theories. Information foraging theory studies human behavior when they are seeking, gathering, sharing and consuming information.Pirolli, P., & Card, S. (1999). Information foraging. Psychological review,106(4), 643. Information foraging theory applies optimal foraging theory (OFT) to human behavior when they navigate to information.Bonabeau, E., Dorigo, M., & Theraulaz, G. (2000). Inspiration for optimization from social insect behavior. Nature, 406(6791), 39-42 It explains how people get benefit from other people based on history- rich digital objects which explains the idea of used items or paths. For examples, a used book that has notes, highlights and underlines is different from a new book, and footprints where people follow others‚Äô footprints to get the right direction. History- rich digital objects help people to find the target faster and more efficient.Wexelblat, A., & Maes, P. (1999, May). Footprints: history- rich tools for information foraging. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (pp. 270-277). ACM. Information foraging, also, is an alternative to food foraging and ant colony optimization which states that information human-hunters follow others‚Äô paths to reach their target in an optimal time. The optimal information has to maximize the value of the information that is gained per unit cost (like time or effort). This theory supports collaborative activities.Pirolli, P., & Card, S. (1995, May). Information foraging in information access environments. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems (pp. 51-58). ACM Press/Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. It is a guide for designers to build good interfaces where users can get benefit from others research. The weaknesses of this theory are when people trace information in a wrong direction, there‚Äôs no way to re-direct them unless they figure it out, and optimization is not always the case on human behavior; humans make decision when they are satisfied with the result. Information patch model studies time that is spent in navigation in filtered information and clustered information and works to optimize the overall information in an optimal time. Information scent model determines value of information using the most useful cues which have been done by other users. Information diet model (prey selection) explains how people select the target information based on others selection which leads to optimal satisfying information. The mere design of webpages also plays an important role in how a user interacts with the internet in a social manner. There is a correlation between accessibility and popularity.Yen, B. P.-C. (2077). The design and evaluation of accessibility on web navigation. Decision Support Systems(42), 2219-2235. The more functional a website is, the more traffic it will receive. A more frequented web service will naturally be a more social experience. There are numerous factors that contribute to accessibility such as location of the page on a website, properties of a page, number of hyperlinks on a page, and possible ways of arriving at the page.Spence, R. (1999). A framework for navigation. Int. J. Human-Computer Studies(51), 919-945.Campbell, C. S., Maglio, P. P. (1999). Facilitating navigation in information spaces: Road-signs on the World Wide Web. Int. J. Human-Computer Studies(50), 309-327. Every person has a different approach to surfing the web. Internet navigation is defined as \\"The creation and interpretation of an internal (mental) model, and its component activities are browsing, modelling, interpretation and formulation of browsing strategy.\\" There is a theory that if a user calibrates their browsing strategy to reflect their interests, more interesting pages will be found. Uninformed chugging through hyperlinks can be misleading and result in a higher proportion of unwanted sites being accessed.Dieberger, A. (1997). Supporting social navigation on the World Wide Web. Int. J. Human-Computer Studies(46), 805-825. To improve surfing, users should formulate a strategy, browse content, and then adjust based on how they judge the quality of the session. Bookmarking is way to ensure you return to sites that appeal to your interests. This is the building block of social navigation as it creates a hyperlink that is saved for future browsing. When a population bookmarks the same page visits it frequently, it forms a sense of community. Recently, live updating of other present users adds another dimension to the social aspect of web browsing. For example, Facebook has a small green circle next to specific names in the chat window indicating those users are also on the site. How we communicate with others using web mediums is a foundation of social navigation. Collaborative filtering is another technique that is prevalent and utilized in social navigation. It suggests that if users were presented search results based on traffic by others who share similar social interests, it would result in a more rewarding and efficient experience.Beydoun, G., Manasseh, G., Kultchitsky, R. (2007). Evolving semantic web with social navigation. Expert Systems with Applications(32), 265-276. For example, Amazon.com has a \\"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\\" feature that presents shoppers with other products bought by users that are similar to the user. This streamlines the flow of web browsing and gets people in touch with more relevant pages. Social navigation can also be discussed in different types of virtual worlds. Munro shares some original conceptions when considering social navigation. One of them is, instead of individual interaction, it can be presented as \\"a way of moving through an information space and exploiting the activities and orientations of others in that space as a way of managing one's spatial activities\\". Munro also points out that spatial navigation, which mostly depends on the structure itself, like landscape or map, can be contrasted with social navigation. User may even have interactions not only with the data and objects in this specific space, but also other individuals and their interactions with it.Munro, A., H√∂√∂k, K., Benyon, D. (2012). \\"Social Navigation of Information Space\\"  Social navigation support in information space   Traces of users' activities  As users navigate through online communities they leave traces of their activities, both intentional and unintentional. Intentional traces include posts, responses to other users‚Äô posts, number of friends, uploaded media, and other activities where users intentionally share information. Unintentional traces include browsing history, times spent on particular pages, bounce rates and other activities where users‚Äô actions are automatically logged by web servers into server logs. Bj√∂rneborn categorizes online community users as ‚Äútrace leavers‚Äù (i.e. users who leave actionable items) and \\"trace finders\\" (i.e. users who follow traces left by trace leavers). These participatory activities can guide other users‚Äô information seeking behavior and influences features of social search and social navigation. Combining trace-leaving activities of social browsing with the concept of social search relies on recording and reusing focused search activities of like-minded searchers to produce search results that are better suited to the needs of a particular online community, as demonstrated by Freyne et al. Websites such as Amazon.com use traces of users' activities such as history of purchases or product reviews to generate recommendations for other users (e.g. \\"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought...\\"). Online platforms for collaborative software development such as GitHub rely on activity traces (number of repositories, history of activity across projects, commits and personal profiles to determine its users' reputations in the community. User activity traces can be used to model users‚Äô behavioral patterns and trends in order to determine online communities‚Äô health (whether a community would flourish or diminish). Such models can also be used to predict propagation and future popularity of content, or predict voting results before voting even occurs. Furthermore, activity and traffic patterns can be used for evaluating performance of existing systems, improving site usability, as well as site architecture and infrastructure.  Tag-based Social Navigation People are seeking for useful information everyday, and there are mainly two strategies to explore and discover an information space. The first one is the regular search: people know what they are searching for. Under this context, users have a target information in mind. They usually first need to formulate a search query in mind and then search that query in the search engine, such as Google. In contrast, another search strategy is navigation, where people do not really need a target information in mind but rather explore through pieces of information by following certain hyperlinks. It is usually considered that navigation has advantage over search since recognizing what we are looking for is much easier than formulating and describing the information people need, which also refers to the \\"vocabulary problem\\". Therefore, social tagging serves as a new social way of organizing a set of resources. This free-form annotation approached the \\"vocabulary problem\\" from a new social angle. Social tagging systems allow people to annotate a set of resources according to their own needs with freely chosen words‚Äîtags, and share them with other users of the social tagging system.The result of this human-based annotation of resources is called Folksonomy, which refers to a fold-generated taxonomy. Examples of such social tagging systems are BibSonomy, CiteULike, Flickr, or Delicious. Tag-based navigation is thus the process to find path between information resources in a tag-based information system. The navigation process is usually supported by either a tag cloud or navigate through a tag hierarchy. = Tag Cloud = Tag cloud is a textual representation of the topic or subject collectively seen by the users and it captures the \\"aboutness\\" of the resource. On the one hand, tag cloud has many benefits. It is simple to build, intuitive to understand, and widely used. It can also represent the three types of relationship among users, tags, and resources in the tagging systems. On the other hand, since there exists the limitation on size of the tag cloud that can be presented in the screen, selecting the best tags and structuring the information space to present the relationships in the tag cloud would be an important issue. Tag clouds are very simple, they can be applied to support the user in multiple ways. Researches find that tag cloud is usually more useful for the following four different tasks, as illustrated by Rivadeneira et al.: * Search: finding the presence or absence of a given target * Browsing: exploring the cloud without a particular target in mind * Gaining visual impression about a topic * Recognition and matching: recognizing the tag cloud as data describing a specific topic Researches also found that different Layouts is useful in performing different tasks. In addition, researches also demonstrated that tag clouds typography (font size/position) matters: font size has a bigger impact on finding a tag than other visual features like, e.g., color, tag string length and tag location. Tag cloud evaluation: based on the previous researches, below are list of common ways to perform tag cloud evaluation: * Use certain evaluation metrics for tag clouds with respect to coverage, overlap and selectivity * User navigation model that combined with the evaluation metrics allows a tag cloud evaluation with respect to navigation * User study to evaluate tag-based information access in image collections * Examined the navigability assumption (the widely adopted belief that tag clouds are useful for navigation), they found that it does not hold for every social tagging system = Tag Clustering = As mentioned previously, one of the main issues with social tagging data is the lack of structure. Synonymy, polysemy and homonymy or problems regarding the semantic of the tags are additional issues related to tagging data. Previous research demonstrate us different algorithms for clustering tagging data which could tackle the above problems by organizing the tags according to a classification schema. Depending on the classification schema, there are two main categories: flat and hierarchical clustering algorithms. Flat Classification can refer to three main methods: # Content-based method: one very widely adopted algorithm for tag cloud selection is TopN algorithm proposed by Venetis et al. # Network- based method: split a graph of connected tags into clusters, ideas from the concept of modularity. # Machine learning method: consider the semantic relationship between tags. Similar idea from the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. Hierarchical Tag Clustering refers to create a hierarchical structure out of unstructured tagging data. This way, hierarchical structure can be seen as the users‚Äô mental maps of the information space, thus the hierarchies can be used as a navigational aid in different ways. Hierarchical Tag Clustering can also refer to three main methods: * Hierarchical K-Means is the method that adapted the K-Means algorithms to work with textual data and create a tag hierarchy in a top-down manner * Affinity Propagation characterizes each data sample according to its ‚Äùresponsibility‚Äù and its ‚Äùavailability‚Äù values. The input of the algorithm is a set of similarities between data samples provided in a matrix and the output of the algorithm is a hierarchy, and each node in the hierarchy represent a unique tag * Generality in Tag Similarity Graph method includes the following steps: *# The input of the algorithm is a similarity graph of tags *# Set the most general node (can be measured based on different graph centralities) to be the root of the hierarchy *# All other nodes are added to the hierarchy in descending order of their centrality in the similarity graph based on the following rules: *## Calculate the similarity between all currently present nodes in the hierarchy and the candidate node *## If their similarity is above a given threshold: the candidate node is added as a child of the most similar node in the hierarchy *## Otherwise, the candidate node is added as a child of the root node * Typical versions for centrality measure and similarity measures:  Degree centrality as centrality measure and co-occurrence as similarity measure (DegCen/Cooc)  Closeness centrality and Cosine similarity (CloCen/Cos) = Modeling Navigation in Social Tagging Systems = Modeling tag-based navigation is important for understanding the processes taking place in a social tagging system and how the system is used. There are two essential factors to understand modeling tag-based navigation in social tagging systems: basic modeling framework for navigation and theories understanding of the ability of folksonomies to guide navigation.  Basic Modeling Framework for Navigation  Markov chain models: * Navigation on the Web can be seen as the process of following links between web pages * Markov chain models assign transition probabilities between web pages (also called states) * First order Markov chains (the transition probability between states depends only on the current state) are more commonly used Decentralized Search: * Navigation in a network can be modeled by the message-passing algorithm decentralized search * The message holder passes a message to one of its immediate neighbor nodes until the target node is found * That is, at each step, the decision of where to go is made by the local knowledge of the network only * Finding a path to a node (already realized in web navigation)  Theoretic Suitability for Search  Different scholars also provide the theoretic support to argue the suitability of Folksonomies as a navigational aid, there are mainly four perspectives as illustrated below: * Network theoretic perspective has two aspects: The general navigability of a folksonomy as a graph; or The ability of tag hierarchies to guide navigation in such a graph * Information theoretic perspective suggest to see social tagging as the collective effort of creating a mental map that summarize an information space * Information foraging perspective: describe the human information seeking in a digital environment * Tagging vs. Library approach: discussed the pros and cons of the ‚Äútagging system‚Äù. They proposed a definition of a controlled vocabulary and compared unrestricted free-form vocabularies emerged in social tagging systems to controlled vocabularies  Pragmatic Folksonomies Evaluation  Evaluation method introduced in this section is based on the paper by Helic et al. ‚ÄùPragmatic Evaluation of Folksonomies‚Äù. The author proposed in the paper the general idea that people can leverage on the OUTPUT produced by folksonomy algorithms (hierarchical structures) as INPUT (background knowledge) for decentralized search for the following reasons: 1) The performance of decentralized search highly depends on the quality of the hierarchical clustering results that developed to facilitated navigation. 2) The performance of the decentralized search algorithm depends on the suitability of folksonomies. 3) Therefore, the authors proposed that we can leverage the simulation method on decentralized search to evaluate the suitability of folksonomies.  Implementation examples  = Educational systems = Various applications of social navigation have been studied in educational systems. One such example is Knowledge Sea II. Compared to traditional approaches (so-called Closed Corpus), this system is able to gather online information (named Open Corpus) and feedback from different sources. Group traffic is used as feedback to indicate social navigation information such as \\"the most important parts of the textbooks\\". After a classroom study, Knowledge Sea II system shows better performance in visualization of content relevance of the textbook and satisfaction of student users. Mertens and his colleagues optimize an existed system: virtPresenter, with addition of hypermedia navigation concept. bookmarks, footprints and structural elements are integrated to help users to access lecture recordings and support social navigation for the future users as well. The new version of virtPresenter shows better performance in social navigation function such as: visualization, week-based filtering and exchangeable bookmarks. Farzan and Brusilovsky introduce the AnnotatEd system, which combines functions of web annotation and adaptive navigation support to synergize social navigation application in web- based education. With implementations of web annotation and social navigation support (SNS), this AnnotatEd system could integrate into Knowledge Sea II or ASSIST-ACM. AnnotatEd integrated Knowledge Sea II has been evaluated for six semesters in School of Information Systems University of Pittsburgh, which shows the significantly higher positive user attitude towards this new system because of its social navigation integration. = Urban mobile information system = In Marcus Foth‚Äôs (2008) book, a system called CityFlocks is introduced to show social navigation implementation in urban mobile information system. This implementation is described in more details by Bilandzic et al. (2008) earlier. In the article, to solve so-called ‚Äúsocially blind‚Äù problem even based on booming of mobile phone user, CityFlocks is designed enabling web annotations combined with coordinates upon physical targets in the city. Also, this social navigation implementation could be applied in direct or indirect way. To achieve this, focus groups are chose to collect requirements and problems in social navigation. Accordingly, CityFlocks is designed and generated using appropriate techniques such as Google maps and information retrieval. User tests of CityFlocks indicated that an indirect approach is more acceptable than a direct one, because of the concerning of talking to a complete stranger. = Prototypes = Two prototypes of social navigation system have been introduced: ‚ÄúJuggler‚Äù and ‚ÄúVortex‚Äù. The ‚ÄúJuggler‚Äù system combines MOO, a textual virtual environment, and a Web client. The ‚ÄúVortex‚Äù system uses an alternative way: simplified desktop, to present URLs. = History-enriched implementation = History- enriched implementation of social navigation is based on the making the traces of behavior of latent users visible to future users. The implementation of such idea can be traced back to the first system introduced by Wexelblat and Maes who introduced an information spaced enriched with various social navigation mechanisms: document map, navigation paths, and documents' annotations and signposts.Wexelblat, Alan, and Pattie Maes. \\"Footprints: history-rich tools for information foraging\\". Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM, 1999. They used six properties in Footprints system, Proxemic versus Distemic, Active versus Passive, Rate of Change, Degree of Permeation, Personal versus social, and Kind of Information. More examples of history-rich information spaces has been implemented in different context such as educational domain,Brusilovsky, Peter, et al. \\"Social navigation for educational digital libraries\\". Procedia Computer Science 1.2 (2010): 2889-2897. location-based networking, and food recipes. Social Navigation Network (SoNavNet), a location-based social networks (LSBN) application, devised by Karimi and his team, is aimed at sharing navigation experience. Other than simply showing the shortest time or distance like Google Maps, users‚Äô specific experience and recommendation are underlined. With both geo-position and message function, SoNavNet allows users to send request to their friends while present their current location and Points of interest(POI), from which, they will acquire route and venue information oriented to their needs.Karimi, Hassan A., et al. \\"SoNavNet: a framework for social navigation networks\\". Proceedings of the 2009 International Workshop on Location Based Social Networks. ACM, 2009. Svensson and his team created a recipe recommendation system, European Food On- Line(EFOL), which equips with both direct (chatting with other user) and indirect navigation (collaborative filtering) approaches. Social Navigator was implemented as a Java servlet for modelling users' behavior and net-based communication usages.Svensson, Martin, et al. \\"Social navigation of food recipes\\". Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems. ACM, 2001. = Embedded visualization implementation = Social navigation implementation plays a significant role in guiding users to forage information they need. Visualization is an indispensable part when showing information in great detail. Willett and his team designed Scented Widgets, which improves navigation in both popular and undiscovered realms with embedded visualization. They implemented scent metrics with a standard interface widget and used visual encoding for data. Hue, Saturation, Opacity, Text, Icon, Bar Chart and Line Chart are scent encodings to highlight various information, which can display different types of data at the same time. They used Java Swing and the platform‚Äôs pluggable look and feel functionality to create and change widgets at runtime. In order to design a user-friendly interface, they followed Scent Encoding, Layout, and Composition guidelines which gave clear instruction in how to use scent widget better showing multiple information.Willett, Wesley, Jeffrey Heer, and Maneesh Agrawala. \\"Scented widgets: Improving navigation cues with embedded visualizations\\". Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on 13.6 (2007): 1129-1136. = Implementation in Usable Security = Given a file sharing system, every user can determine which files in their own computer can be shared through the network. Initially, user have to configure these security- related settings on their own. Because of being uninformed, about eight out of ten users would unintentionally leak their private information such as credit card information or address, which can cause unexpected results. Based on this problem, Paul DiGIoia and Paul Dourish from University of California, Irvine have introduced a ‚ÄúPile Metaphor‚Äù model which using social navigation idea to solve this specific issue. The design of ‚ÄúPile Metaphor‚Äù model focuses on two major parts. First of all, users can be shown that how other users in this system decide which files are shared, which are not. And such information will be shown directly in the appearance of the folders, that is to say, different folder appearances indicate different sharing levels. Based on this straightforward design, users can easily know that whether their decision is appropriate or not. Secondly, the ‚ÄúPile Metaphor‚Äù model also shows the extent that how many people in the whole system have read one user‚Äôs own file. This feature is achieved by showing the tidiness of the pile. For example, the more times a pile of file are read, the messier the pile is. Again, based on this direct information, users will reconsider which files can be shared continuously, and which should be set as invisible to the public. There are two major advantages regarding the ‚ÄúPile Metaphor‚Äù model. First, introducing this model to a system does not change the fundamental design of the system. This model is like a small plug-in, and will have significant influence on the users. Second, this model will not detract users from their work, because every security-related features will be shown directly on the user‚Äôs interface.Digioia, Paul, and P. Dourish. \\"Social Navigation as a Model for Usable Security.\\" Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security, SOUPS 2005, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Usa, July 2005:101-108. =Implementation in human- robot interaction= One of the common methods people used in the field of social navigation is to construct proxemic, which can be connected with human- robot interaction. A study shows interests in different kinds of navigation behaviors humans expect from a robot in a path crossing scenario. The study focuses on two main questions of robot behavior. First, what is the definition of expected actions? Then, can spatial relationship help with the expected action? The result reveals that spatial relationship actually relates to the behavior, which leads to a possible prediction to the expected action.Lichtenth√§ler,C. Peters,A. Griffiths,S. Kirsch,A.(2013).\\"Social Navigation - Identifying Robot Navigation Patterns in a Path Crossing Scenario\\".pp 84-93. doi:10.1007/978-3-319-02675-6_9  Drawbacks of social navigation  Social navigation can be used in so many fields that most people can benefit from it, and also wants to join it to gain more benefits. However, as the saying goes, ‚Äúevery coin has two sides‚Äù, so does social navigation which also has some drawbacks that can be used by malicious users who are intended to mislead the public or obtain private information about specific person. Researchers Meital Ben Sinai, Nimrod Partush, Shir Yadid and Eran Yahav from Israel Technion did some experiments in 2014 and wrote an article, ‚ÄúExploiting Social Navigation‚Äù, to discuss about the results. According to the article, attackers can use plenty of machines to fake users‚Äô behavior and fabricate information to mislead other real users. In this case, they attacked a real-time traffic software which allows users to report traffic news, and broadcasts these messages to others. These researchers used phony users to fabricate traffic information like obstruction or traffic jams and successfully let the system mislead real users with other itineraries. This can cause several problems, as the researchers mentioned. One problem is that real users would take more time and more money to go another longer way compared with the origin way which cost much less. What‚Äôs more, this attack may lead people to unsafe routes or sometimes non existent routes, which cause security related issues. To solve for this challenge of social navigation, social navigation systems sometimes verify the users‚Äô identities through verification codes. The verification technique will lead to another problem of social navigation, information disclosure. In accordance with the article mentioned above, the four researchers discussed that malicious attackers may make use of the information of a specific user and gain plenty of private information of the user, such as the place he/she usually goes to, the route which he/she usually drives and so on. These information will also cause security-related issues, since attackers can use such information to track other people with vicious intention.Sinai M B, Partush N, Yadid S, et al. Exploiting Social Navigation[J]. Eprint Arxiv, 2014.  Recent trends and implementation in products  As popularity of social networks and social web grows, great deal of data can be collected through the footprints of users left behind as they interact within different social computing systems. This growth has led into more novel and diverse implementation of social navigation support, including in Education, Media, News, and Tour Guide Systems. Implementation of Social Navigation in shared 3D environment works in the similar way, as allows users to see trail and information of others who used to be in the same place before in the virtual world. This architecture has been evaluated through a prototype system, proving its performance and usability.Vosinakis, S.; Papadakis, I., \\"Virtual Worlds as Information Spaces: Supporting Semantic and Social Navigation in a shared 3D Environment,\\" in Games and Virtual Worlds for Serious Applications (VS-GAMES), 2011 Third International Conference on , vol., no., pp.220-227,4-6 May2011 Bosch improved real navigation systems for driving, used social navigation to reduce driving time on the road. The model even considered altruism and CO2 emission in a novel way, which has been evaluated in Bay area, achieving improvement of 10%.A. van den Bosch, B. van Arem, M. Mahmod and J.

The film focuses on the conflict between labor unions and corporations, and was created during a time in the company's history when its directors were making industrial for-hire films to support their social-issue, union-focused documentaries. The Last Pullman Car won first prize at the Athens International Film Festival and was broadcast on PBS. It was featured on the Learning Channel Independents Series and went on to screen at several other film festivals around the world. The film's relevancy continues to the present day, and in 2011 it was screened in Pullman by South Side Projections to mark 30 years since the closure of the site.  Synopsis  The Last Pullman Car follows the efforts of the United Steelworkers Local 1834 to prevent the Pullman-Standard Company from shutting down operations in Pullman, Chicago. The plant had opened in 1864 when George Pullman began selling his famous railroad sleeping cars. Yet in 1981, the industrial empire began to break down, leaving the Pullman workers fighting for their jobs and the future of the American rail car industry. Ultimately, their effors failed, as the local union was ignored by even their own national union and the plant was shuttered.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=598990 on 2016-02-10 Description The length of the shell attains 10.7 mm, its breadth 3.9 mm. (Original description) The small, narrow shell has a turriculate shape with an angle of spire, about 22¬∞. The body whorl is shorter than the spire. The shell is clathrate. The aperture is pyriform. The canal is short. Sculpture: The spire-whorls contain three spiral equidistant cords, which are crossed by longitudinal also equidistant threads, forming small beads at the intersections, and squarish interstitial depressions. There are about twenty- one beads on a row. On approaching the base the spirals are getting narrower than the interspace, and the beading less prominent. Upon the beak there are small irregular threads crossed obliquely by the plications of the old beaks. The colour of the shell is greyish-white. The spire is turriculate, not very conspicuously shouldered, longer than the body whorl. Protoconch: The outer shelly layer has scaled off and it is impossible to give a description. The nucleus is globular and obliquely tilted. The seven whorls are narrowly angled and excavated above, their sides almost straight. The base of the shell is convex and narrowed to a short and anteriorly sinuated beak. The suture is bimarginate, above by a minute threadlet, below by a broad and heavy cord which is obliquely irregularly plicated. The aperture is pyriform, angled above, with a concave inner wall, ending in a short broad canal, which turns slightly to the left. The outer lip is curved and imperfect The lines of growth would indicate that the sinus is situate in the excavation below the sutural cord, that it is small and moderately deep. The inner lip spread as a thin layer narrowly over the body, broader over the columella, which is first straight and then slightly twisted to the left, ending in a sharp point.R. Murdoch and H.

ÂÆùÈ°∂Â±±Ôºè ÂØ∂È†ÇÂ±± also known as Mount Baoding, Precious Summit Mountain, and Summit of Treasures) is a Buddhist site in Chongqing. The site is located on a limestone outcropping at an elevation of 500 meters, fifteen kilometers north of the city of Dazu, a market town that dates to 758 CE and the city is ringed by religious sites dating from 892 to 1249 CE. Primary construction at Baodingshan took place during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127‚Äì1279 CE) but it remained largely unknown to the outside world until its reopening to the public in the 1980s, the earliest documented research on the site dating to 1944. The site has since been designated a World Heritage Site since 1999, falling within the collective grouping of Dazu Rock Carvings, a reference to the district in which Baodingshan is located. Dazu County covers 1400 square kilometers northwest of Chongqing on the road to Chengdu. During the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279 CE), this area of the Chengdu plain was considered one of the wealthiest regions in China. Consisting of a mile and a half of carvings, numbering over 6000 total, Baodingshan is an atypical Chinese Buddhist site for a variety of reasons: it includes both large scale iconic works as well as intricate narrative tableaux; it represents a variety of Buddhist schools of thought ‚Äì Huayan, Chan, Pure Land, and Esoteric; it has copious amounts of Buddhist texts carved in conjunction with imagery; and it was constructed within 70 years under the supervision of one man, Zhao Zhifeng (ËµµÊô∫È£é). Baodingshan consists of two main parts joined by a temple, Shengshousi [Sagacious Longevity Temple Âú£ÊâãÂØ∫Ôºè ËÅñÂ£ΩÂØ∫]. Best known to the outside world is Great Buddha Bend [DafowanÂ§ß‰ΩõÂºØÔºèÂ§ß‰ΩõÂΩé] due to its impressive collection of 31 tableaux featuring imagery such as the parinirvana of the historical Buddha, the hells scenes, the Peacock Queen and numerous other narrative tableaux, the most widely reproduced being the Taming the Wild Ox. Great Buddha Bend also claims some of the biggest Chinese versions of certain Buddhist works ‚Äì in particular the Hell tableau and the 1000-Armed 1000-Eyed Avalokitesvara or Guanyin figure. This area of Baodingshan follows the natural contours of the landscape, a rocky semi-circle formed by the nearby river. At Great Buddha Bend, the carved works flow from one tableau into another‚Äîlarge, deeply cut reliefs reaching dimensions as great as 26 feet high by 66 feet wide. Visitors encounter an uninterrupted series of carvings totaling 30 connected tableaux punctuated by two caves, giving the illusion of a handscroll. Several authors have even likened Baodingshan‚Äôs Great Buddha Bend to ‚Äúan illustrated storybook.\\" The most obvious difference between Great Buddha Bend and other Chinese cave sites is the lack of caves, or even cave-like niches, in which the statues would normally be positioned. Caves at Buddhist sites such as Dunhuang and Yungang were seen as a necessary part of the religious process. They were places where the worshipper entered into a ‚ÄúBuddha-world‚Äù and performed rites of circumambulation or made offerings to an icon. The other area of Baodingshan is Little Buddha Bend [Xiaofowan Â∞è‰ΩõÂºØÔºèÂ∞è‰ΩõÂΩé], a smaller area situated above and behind the temple where some scholars have argued initiation rituals were carried out. It is within Little Buddha Bend that one finds the Founder‚Äôs Pagoda, a carved work on which is seen images of the Tang dynasty local layman Master Liu ‚Äì famous for his ten austerities that are depicted at Baodingshan as well as at other sites in Sichuan ‚Äì as well as an image of Zhao Zhifeng, the monk credited with Baodingshan‚Äôs creation. Equally important is the inclusion of a carved Buddhist scriptural catalogue on the lower levels of the pagoda, with some scholars noting that the catalogue‚Äôs presence points to perhaps a different function for the text seen at the site as a whole. Other areas of Baodingshan include the Vimalakirti Hall, situated at the pinnacle of the summit, and the Longevity Pavilion located just above the Oxherding sequence of texts and images in Great Buddha Bend. Baodingshan has seen considerable growth in the last decade, with a new highway being built to Dazu from Chongqing to speed up access and new buildings and roads being constructed at Baodingshan itself. Scholarship on the site has also increased, from only minimal treatment of the site by Chinese scholars in the form of archaeological assessment being done up until the 1980s to volumes of essays being published annually. Early Western language work by H. Sorensen, A. Howard and K. Kucera has since been augmented by increasing interest among foreign scholars brought on by Baodingshan‚Äôs movement onto the global stage and its subsequent acquisition of World Heritage status. The Dazu Academy of Rock Carvings now holds an international conference every five years to commemorate that landmark bringing together scholars from all over the world, the last of which was held in fall 2014.

He is Director and Professor of Historic Preservation at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (Columbia GSAPP). Early life and education Jorge Otero-Pailos was born in Madrid, the only son of Justo Otero, a landscape painter and forestry engineer, and Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Pailos, a computer scientist. His early childhood was marked by international travel to historic sites, facilitated by his mother's employment by Iberia Airlines, and Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy, which made it easier for Spaniards to go abroad.Laura K. Raskin, Turbulent Stillness: Jorge Otero- Pailos and Experimental Preservation, (Masters Thesis: Columbia University, 2010), 18. He attended the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de Madrid, an international secular school in a country where Catholic education was the norm. His father taught him painting. In 1985, Otero-Pailos traveled to the United States through a study abroad program, and was a foreign exchange student at Barrington High School, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, where his art teacher introduced him to Frank Lloyd Wright, and encouraged him to study architecture. Otero-Pailos received a Bachelors of Architecture (1994) and a Masters of Urban Design (1995) from Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, where he was awarded the Richmond Harold Shreve Award for best graduate thesis.Cornell Journal of Architecture, v. 6, (1999),142 He studied design with the Texas Rangers (architects) Colin Rowe, John Shaw, and Lee Hodgden, and studied theory with art historian Hal Foster, who introduced him to psychoanalytic theory, and became a pupil of philosopher Susan Buck-Morss, who trained him in Critical Theory. In 1991, he founded the student journal Submission, to advance theoretical discourse within the school. Together with fellow students Alfonso D‚ÄôOnofrio and Jess Mullen-Carey, he conceived and directed the public television series V.E.T.V. (Visual Evangelist Tele Vision), which explored the relationship between architecture, broadcasting and digital media. V.E.T.V. featured surrealist scenes acted by fellow students and narrated by Otero-Pailos, spliced between interviews with Mark Jarzombek, Rem Koolhaas, Mark Wigley, Susan Buck-Morss, and others.Merrill, Nancy, ‚ÄúLocal Channel to Air Video Produced by C.U. Students‚Äù, The Cornell Daily Sun, (October 14, 1994) p 3.  Academic career  In 1995, Otero-Pailos moved to San Juan to join Jorge Rigau in the effort to found the New School of Architecture at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico. Otero-Pailos was the school's first full-time professor. He received the Angel Ramos Foundation Research Grant to continue his investigation of the relationship between architecture and media, this time focused on the portrayal of Puerto Rican social violence and architecture in the news.Ferrer, Melba, ‚ÄúTV Violence and Architecture,‚Äù The San Juan Star, (November 22, 1996) p 21 This research led him to co-organize with Vikramaditya Prakash ‚ÄúRe-Envisioning San Juan: Identity Politics and Architecture,‚Äù an international symposium and workshop leading to socially engaged proposals for public art in San Juan.Ferrer, Melba, ‚ÄúArchitecture Project Gives a Closer Look into Past and Future,‚Äù The San Juan Star, (September 26, 1996) p 29 He continued to produce and exhibit his paintings, collages and sculptures made of recycled materials in galleries,Ferrer, Melba, ‚ÄúGallery Shows that Architecture is an Art Form, Too‚Äù, The San Juan Star, (August 22, 1997) p26. and wrote opinion pieces about architecture and urbanism in the press.‚ÄúEl Superacueducto y la Ciudad‚Äù, El Nuevo D√≠a, (June 29, 1997), p N-7 In 1997, Otero-Pailos conducted doctoral studies at the MIT School of Architecture and Planning under Prof. Mark Jarzombek, and wrote a dissertation on the history of architectural phenomenology, which was later published as the book ‚ÄúArchitecture‚Äôs Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern‚ÄùJorge Otero- Pailos, Architecture‚Äôs Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern, (Minneapolis and London: University of Minnesota Press, 2010) In 2002, Otero-Pailos was appointed Assistant Professor of Historic Preservation at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. In 2004 he founded the journal Future Anterior,Liz Holmes, ‚ÄúAlumnus Starts Preservation Journal,‚Äù in Cornell College of Architecture, Art and Planning Newsletter (Fall 2004): 23. the first scholarly journal in the US to focus on the history theory and criticism of historic preservation, published by the University of Minnesota Press. He has contributed to numerous scholarly journals and books including the Oxford Encyclopedia of Aesthetics, and Rem Koolhaas‚Äô Preservation Is Overtaking Us (2014). In 2016, he was appointed as the Director of Historic Preservation at Columbia University GSAPP. In 2018, Columbia GSAPP launches country‚Äôs first PhD program in historic preservation. Otero-Pailos collaborated with Dean Amale Andraos and Dean Emeritus Mark Wigley to create the program. https://archpaper.com/2018/01/columbia-gsapp-first-phd-historic-preservation/ Collaborations with architects  = Masterplan for New Holland Island with WORK AC = In 2013, Otero-Pailos was selected as Preservation Architect to work on New Holland Island, an 8-hectare site located the historic center of St. Petersburg, Russia. Otero-Pailos collaborated with Work Architecture Company, Master Planner and Design Architect. The client team was Dasha Zukhova and Roman Abramovitz. Otero-Pailos won the American Institute of Architects Merit Award (2013) for his contribution to this project. Artistic career  = Influences = In an interview with M.I.T. Art Initiative, Otero-Pailos cites his father as a key figure in his artistic development. Otero-Pailos explains how his father would bring him along as \\"he would set up easels at the Prado Museum, copying paintings by Goya\\" and how \\"Trips to the Parthenon in Greece and Teotihuacan in Mexico cultivated a lifelong interest in architecture and its connection to art.\\" Otero-Pailos credits Krzysztof Wodiczko, a Polish artist who works on architectural facades and monuments for making him realize that ‚ÄúArt can make monuments speak in a contemporary language.‚Äù Otero-Pailos further credits Leila W. Kinney, the Executive Director of Arts Initiatives and the Center for Art, Science & Technology, at M.I.T, for introducing him to sculptor Eva Hesse, whose work with latex became a major influence for Otero-Pailos. = The Ethics of Dust (2008 to present) = The Ethics of Dust is a series of artworks where Otero-Pailos transfers the pollution on monuments onto latex casts. The title of the series indicates a dialogue with John Ruskin, one of the founders of preservation. Each work in the series is distinguished by the subtitle, which takes the name of the monument. Works in the series thus far include: * The Ethics of Dust: Ex- Alumix (2008) * The Ethics of Dust: Doge's Palace (2009) * The Ethics of Dust: Carthago Nova (2013) * The Ethics of Dust: Trajan's Column (2015) * The Ethics of Dust: Maison de Famille Louis Vuitton (2015) Garage magazine, Talk with Jorge Otero-Pailos, http://garagemag.com/talk-jorge-otero-pailos/ accessed February 10, 2016 * The Ethics of Dust: Old United States Mint (2015) * The Ethics of Dust: Westminster Hall (2016)Artangel, Jorge Otero-Pailos, The Ethics of Dust: Westminster Hall, https://www.artangel.org.uk/project/the- ethics-of-dust/ accessed June 21, 2019 =Distributed Monuments (2017 to present) = Distributed Monuments is a body of work made of dust transferred onto latex casts and enclosed in light boxes. Each cast is extracted from distinct site-specific interventions performed by Otero-Pailos as part of his series of works called The Ethics of Dust. The artworks‚Äô materials come from monuments such as Westminster Hall in London, the Doge's Palace in Venice, or the U.S. Old Mint in San Francisco. Designed to be easily transported, Otero- Pailos explains in an interview for ArtSpace that the work \\"questions our relationship with building as cultural objects and inspire us to care for the object as such, to become cultural stewards.\\" The Distributed Monuments series was first exhibited at the Seaman's House, a 2017 exhibition in the Chelsea district of New York City curated by Helen Allen Smith, and second at the Chicago Architecture Biennial 2017 titled Make New History curated by Artistic Directors Sharon Johnston and Mark Lee of the Los Angeles‚Äìbased firm Johnston Marklee. Otero-Pailos' contribution to the Chicago Architecture Biennial received positive critical reviews. =R√©p√©titeur (2018) = Otero-Pailos was invited by New York City Center to create a site-specific art installation as part of the Center's inaugural program of visual art commissions and the Merce Cunningham Centennial. Otero-Pailos was one of three artists invited, alongside photographer Nina Robinson, and conceptual artist Lawrence Weiner. Otero-Pailos created a series of artworks titled R√©p√©titeur, a work reflecting on the history of dance and the labor involved with passing on the knowledge of a dance to a new generation of dancers. The installation derives its name from the term ‚Äúr√©p√©titeur,‚Äù a person entrusted with teaching, coaching, and rehearsing a choreographer's work. It is the first time that Otero-Pailos not only uses his signature language of dust and liquid latex, but also introduces sound collages, and flips the verticality of the wall onto the horizontality of the floor. The exhibition received positive critical reviews from the press including an art review in the New York Times in April 2019 (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/arts/design/jorge-otero-pailos- repetiteur.html) =Space-Time 1964-2014= Space-Time is a reconstruction of Harold Edgerton's iconic 1964 photograph ‚ÄúBullet Through Apple,‚Äù done in collaboration with the MIT Museum, the Edgerton Center, and the MIT Department of Architecture.

Otero-Pailos decided to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù this. In his photograph, the bullet travels left to right, rather than right to left as in the original. =Continuous Cities= Continuous Cities is a series of work consisting of city maps that the artist has collected since the '90s and on which he has painted patterns. In discussing the work in an interview with ArtSpace, Otero-Pailos says that he considers \\"Cities as the major long-lasting monuments that we are collectively constructing together as a civilization.\\" References https://www.metropolismag.com/ideas/arts-culture/jorge-otero-pailos- repetiteur-dance/ https://news.columbia.edu/content/historic-preservation- program-conserves-the-past-for-the-future https://news.columbia.edu/content/on-exhibit-materializing-dance https://news.artnet.com/art-world/editors-picks-october-15-1361176 https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/13257-interview-with-jorge-otero- pailos?v=preview Category:Preservationist architects Category:21st-century architects Category:Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning alumni Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation faculty ","title":"Jorge Otero-Pailos"},{"id":"49386138","text":"Mainframe computers are computers used primarily by businesses and academic institutions for large-scale processes. Before personal computers, first termed microcomputers, became widely available to the general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe computers and the relatively smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant. During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these computers. Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only be understood by the specific machine or computer type they were developed on. While many of these games were lost as older computers were discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal computers, or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers. Early computer games began to be created in the 1950s, and the steady increase in the number and abilities of computers over time led to the gradual loosening of restrictions on access to mainframe computers at academic and corporate institutions beginning in the 1960s. This in turn led to a modest proliferation of generally small, text-based games on mainframe computers, with increasing complexity towards the end of the decade. While games continued to be developed on mainframes and minicomputers through the 1970s, the rise of personal computers and the spread of high-level programming languages meant that later games were generally intended to or were capable of being run on personal computers, even when developed on a mainframe. These early games include Hamurabi, an antecedent of the strategy and city-building genres; Lunar Lander, which inspired numerous recreations in the 1970s and 1980s; Civil War, an early war simulation game; Star Trek, which was widely ported, expanded, and spread for decades after; Space Travel, which played a role in the creation of the Unix operating system; and Baseball, an early sports game and the first baseball game to allow player control during a game. Background IBM System/360 Model 30 mainframe computer at the Computer History Museum Mainframe computers are powerful computers used primarily by large organizations for computational work, especially large-scale, multi-user processes. The term originally referred to the large cabinets called \\"main frames\\" that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers. Prior to the rise of personal computers, first termed microcomputers, in the 1970s, they were the primary type of computer in use, and at the beginning of the 1960s they were the only type of computer available for public purchase. Minicomputers were relatively smaller and cheaper mainframe computers prevalent in the 1960s and 1970s, though they were still not intended for personal use. One definition from 1970 required a minicomputer to cost less than US$25,000. In contrast, regular mainframes could cost more than US$1,000,000. By the end of the 1960s, mainframe computers and minicomputers were present in many academic research institutions and large companies such as Bell Labs. While the commercial video game industry did not yet exist at that point in the early history of video games and would not until the early 1970s, programmers at these companies created several small games to be played on their mainframe computers. Most of these spread only to other users of the same type of computer and therefore did not persist as older computer models were discontinued; several, however, inspired future games, or were later released in modified versions on more modern systems or languages. These early mainframe games were largely created between 1968 and 1971; while earlier games were created they were limited to small, academic audiences. Mainframe games also continued to be developed through the 1970s, but the rise of the commercial video game industry, focused on arcade video games and home video game consoles, followed by the rise of personal computers later in the decade, meant that beginning in the 1970s the audience and developers of video games began to shift away from mainframe computers or minicomputers, and the spread of general-purpose programming languages such as the BASIC programming language meant that later mainframe games could generally be run on personal computers with minimal changes, even if initially developed on a mainframe. Early games The very first computer games began to appear in the 1950s, starting with Bertie the Brain, a computer-based game of tic-tac-toe built by Dr. Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. While the status of these games as video games depends on the definition used, the games developed during this time period ran on the large antecedents of mainframe computers and were primarily developed for the purposes of academic research or to showcase the technological development of the computers on which they ran. Access to these computers, located almost exclusively in universities and research institutions, was restricted to academics and researchers, preventing any development of entertainment programs. Over the course of the decade, computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches, and computers themselves spread to more locations. By the 1960s, improvements in computing technology and the early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers, which would later be termed minicomputers, led to the loosening of restrictions regarding programming access to the computers. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), access to the TX-0 experimental computer was opened to students and employees of the university. This in turn led to the development of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect. The games created for the TX-0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through. When the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer was installed at MIT in 1961, the community built a video game to showcase its abilities, Spacewar!, which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP-1 systems and later on other mainframe computers. Over the course of the decade, computers spread to more and more companies and institutions, even as they became more powerful‚Äîby 1971, it is estimated that there were over 1000 computers with monitors, rather than the few dozen at the beginning of the 1960s. While different computers could generally not run the same programs without significant changes to the programs' code, due to differences in the physical hardware or machine languages, the expansion of the computing industry led to the creation of catalogs and user groups to share programs between different installations of the same series of computers, such as DEC's PDP line. These catalogs and groups, such as the IBM program catalog and the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society (DECUS), shared small games as well as programs, including, for example, \\"BBC Vik The Baseball Demonstrator\\" and \\"Three Dimensional Tic-Tack-Toe\\" in the April 1962 IBM catalog, and dice games and question and answer games in the DECUS newsletter. The Sumerian Game (1964) for the IBM 7090, a strategy video game of land and resource management, was the first educational game for children. Mainframe games were developed outside of the IBM and DEC communities as well, such as the 1962 Polish Marienbad for the Odra 1003. By the latter half of the 1960s, higher-level programming languages such as BASIC which were able to be run on multiple types of computers further increased the reach of games developed at any given location. While most games were limited to text-based designs, rather than visual graphics like Spacewar, these games became more complicated as they reached more players, such as baseball and basketball simulation games. Access to the computers themselves was also extended to more people by systems such as the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS), which connected several thousand users through many remote terminals to a central mainframe computer. By the 1967‚Äì68 school year the DTSS library of 500 programs for the system included, John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz wrote, \\"many games\\". Over a quarter of the system's usage was for casual or entertainment purposes, which Kemeny and Kurtz welcomed as helping users to become familiar with and not fear the computer. They noted that \\"we have lost many a distinguished visitor for several hours while he quarterbacked the Dartmouth football team in a highly realistic simulated game\\". 101 BASIC Computer Games A PDP-8 minicomputer on display at the National Museum of American History In 1971, DEC employee David H. Ahl converted two games, Hamurabi and Lunar Lander, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter he edited, both ones he wrote and reader submissions. In 1973, he published 101 BASIC Computer Games, containing descriptions and the source code for video games written in BASIC. The games included were written by both Ahl and others, and included both games original to the language and ported from other languages such as FOCAL. Many of these ports were originally mainframe computer games. 101 BASIC Computer Games was a best seller with more than 10,000 copies sold, more sales than computers in existence at the time. Its second edition in 1978, BASIC Computer Games, was the first million-selling computer book. As such, the BASIC ports of mainframe computer games included in the book were often more long-lived than their original versions or other mainframe computer games. Hamurabi in particular is mostly known for its appearance in Ahl's book. After hearing of The Sumerian Game, Doug Dyment at DEC created his own The Sumer Game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL-69 languages, but an expanded, uncredited version of the game was included in 101 BASIC Computer Games as Hamurabi, and later versions of the game, even in FOCAL, referenced the new title over the old. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is an antecedent to the city-building genre. The other game Ahl originally ported to BASIC, Lunar Lander, appeared in the book in three different forms. The original version of the game was called Lunar, and was originally written in FOCAL for the PDP-8 by Jim Storer while a high school student in the fall of 1969. A different version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC. Ahl converted Jim Storer's FOCAL version to BASIC, changed some of the text, and published it in his newsletter. A year or so later, all three BASIC versions of the game appeared in 101 BASIC Computer Games, under the names ROCKET (Storer version), ROCKT1 (Peters version), and ROCKT2 (Labaree version). All three text-based games required the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the moon by entering instructions to the rocket in response to the textual summary of its current position and heading relative to the ground. Ahl and Steve North converted all three versions to Microsoft BASIC, changed the collective name to Lunar Lander, and published them in Creative Computing magazine in 1976; that name was used in the 1978 edition of BASIC Computer Games. Modern recreation of Star Trek, running in a Linux command terminal Another game from the book is Civil War, a text-based computer game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their money to spend on food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. Ahl credited the game in 101 BASIC Computer Games to L. Cram, L. Goodie, and D. Hibbard, students at Lexington High School, and to G. Paul and R. Hess of \\"TIES\\" for converting the game into a two-player game. Civil War was later one of a number of text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems. Possibly the most popular of the mainframe games that appeared in Ahl's book was Star Trek. The game is a text- based computer game that puts the player in command of the Starship Enterprise on a mission to hunt down and destroy an invading fleet of Klingon warships. Unlike the other text-based games, however, it did not use written responses to player input, but instead had character-based graphics, with different characters used as graphical symbols to represent objects. It was initially developed by Mike Mayfield in 1971 on an SDS Sigma 7 mainframe. The game was also unlike many of the other mainframe games in the book in that it was originally written in BASIC; by the time the book was published, it had been widely copied among minicomputer and mainframe systems and modified into several versions. It was one of these, renamed by Ahl as Space War, that appeared in 101 BASIC Computer Games. The 1978 version of the book contained a Microsoft BASIC port of Super Star Trek, an expanded version of the game first written in 1974, and this version was ported to numerous personal computer systems of the era; Ahl stated in the book that it was difficult to find a computer installation that did not contain a version of Star Trek. Multiple updated versions in a wide variety of languages have been made since. By 1980, Star Trek was described by The Dragon magazine as \\"one of the most popular (if not the most popular) computer games around\\", with \\"literally scores of different versions of this game floating around\\". Other games Gameplay image of Space Travel Some mainframe games that did not appear in 101 BASIC Computer Games have still had a lasting impact. One such game was Space Travel, developed by Ken Thompson in 1969, which simulates travel in the Solar System. The player flies their ship around a two-dimensional scale model of the solar system with no objectives other than to attempt to land on various planets and moons. The player can move and turn the ship, and adjust the overall speed by adjusting the scale of the simulation. The ship is affected by the single strongest gravitational pull of the astronomical bodies. The game was developed at Bell Labs, and was ported during 1969 from the Multics operating system to the GECOS operating system on the GE 635 computer, and then to the PDP-7 minicomputer. While porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed ideas for his own operating system, which later formed the core of the Unix operating system. Space Travel never spread beyond Bell Labs or had an effect on future games, leaving its primary legacy as part of the original push for the development of Unix. Another influential early mainframe game was Baseball, a sports game that was created on a PDP-10 minicomputer at Pomona College in 1971 by English major Don Daglow. Baseball was the first baseball video game that allowed players to manage the game as it unfolded, rather than just picking players at the beginning of a game. The program is documented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Baseball was continually updated through 1974, and distributed to other PDP-10 installations. The text-based game had each player control the pitcher or the batter; they would enter their intention to, for example, pitch to or walk the batter, or switch hitters. The batting player could direct on-base players to steal, and the batter to hit.

First mentioned on oracle bones dating to the early 11th century BC, Dapeng was a contemporary of the late Shang dynasty, with whom it shared an ambiguous relationship. At times, the two polities were allies and trading partners, but at least on two occasions war broke out among them, eventually leading to Dapeng's destruction by King Di Xin of Shang around 1060 BC.  History  According to the Spring and Autumn period's Guoyu (Discourses of the States), the Han dynasty's Shiben (Genealogy), and the Tang dynasty's Kuodi Zhi (Record of Geography), Dapeng was founded by Peng Zu (lit. \\"Ancestor of Peng\\"), who was made marquis by the kings of the Shang dynasty. After his death, the state declined under his descendants. Due to the lack of contemporary written sources, it remains impossible to verify this information. Archaeological excavations at Qiuwan, likely the kingdom's capital, have shown that the state was under strong Shang influence since the early Yinxu period (c.1400 BC). According to the Warring States period's Yu Gong, the whole Xuzhou area, including Dapeng, regularly sent tribute to the Shang centres in the Central Plain. Major tributary goods included pearls, shells, and rare woods. Archaeological findings seem to corroborate these records, as large quantities of shells have been uncovered from Qiuwan, and the Xuzhou area appears to have served as major trading hub since the 3rd millennium BC. Under the rule of King Wu Ding (1250‚Äì1192 BC), hostilities broke out, and the Shang dynasty possibly invaded Dapeng. According to Sima Qian, Dapeng and its ruling dynasty were eventually destroyed by the Shang royal army in the 11th century BC due to the \\"unjust behaviour\\" of Peng Zu's successors. Modern historians such as Chen Mengjia, Li Xueqin, and Shima Kunio believed that this campaign against Dapeng is likely related to King Di Xin's military expedition into the Huai River valley that was recorded on oracle bones. A few decades after the destruction of Dapeng and the abandonment of Qiuwan, the state of Xu emerged in its direct vicinity. It remains unknown if there was any relation between these two polities.  Religion  The people of Dapeng, influenced by both Shang as well as local traditions, probably practised human sacrifice. At Qiuwan a sacrificial altar was found, consisting of a one meter high natural stone, surrounded by three large, erected stones. Around these stones, 22 human and 10 dog skeletons were found; most humans were executed by blows to the head. Twenty were then buried in a crouched position, the head to the ground with their arms tied behind their backs. The other two were only represented by their skulls. The remains dated from 1400‚Äì1000 BC, indicating that the site was used for a long time. The excavators interpreted the findings as sacrifices to the Sheji, God of Earth, who was symbolized by standing rocks, prayed to for a good harvest, and whose cult was prevalent among the eastern tribes as well as the Shang people.

Life Bostani was born in Debbi√© in November 1819 and baptized 8 days later. Having chosen the priesthood at a young age, Bostani enrolled in the Ain-Warca Maronite university where he studied Syriac, Arabic, Latin, Italian, rhetoric, philosophy, dogma, moral, canon law, the calendar and Church music. He was ordained a Maronite priest on 12 October 1842 by the rector of the university. Upon leaving the university, Bostani taught Syriac and Arabic at the Maronite seminary of Tyr and Sidon for two years. He then returned to his university to teach the youth enrolled there. He had only been teaching for a year that he was quickly called upon by his relative, the Archbishop of Tyre and Sidon Abdallah Bostani, who named him his private secretary. In 1845, Pierre Bostani was called by the Maronite Patriarch to serve as his private secretary, treasurer of the Patriarchy, judge for ecclesiastical affairs, and Vicar General of the Maronite Patriarchy. He would hold this position for 11 years. On 28 July 1856, Maronite Patriarch Massad named him Coadjutor-Archbishop of Tyre and Sidon alongside his relative the Archbishop Abdallah Bostani who was becoming very old and weak. He also received the title of Bishop of Saint-John-Acre. He immediately set out to preach in his diocese, repairing the various abuses and combatting the advances made by the Protestant missionaries in converting the people. His biography states that he challenged, on four distinct occasions, the Protestant ministers to public discussions of faith and religious doctrine in front of six thousand people in the villages of Deir al-Qamar and Hasbeiya. Bishop Pierre Bostani Eug√®ne Poujade, the French Consul of Beirut, travelled with his relative Bishop Abdallah Bostani to the 1845 synod in Dimane for the election of the new Patriarch of the Maronites. He states that he was the oldest Bishop present. He says of him: \\"he was a small old man full of youth, very active and filled with gaiety. His liveliness was inexhaustible, he either apostrophized the peasants on the road or worried about the food he would find in Meyfouk. But behind this gaiety was a character of steel who had braved a thousand dangers. The Druze, in the last conflict, had burnt his convent and destroyed everything he owned, he was ruined.\\" Poujade states that Bishop Abdallah Bostani particularly regretted a painting of the Virgin Mary given to him by Emir Bechir II that had been burnt by the Druze in the conflicts. The Apostolic Delegate had replaced this loss with a painting of the Virgin Mary inspired by Sassoferrato which he gave to Bishop Abdallah Bostani. Following the sectarian violence which afflicted Mount Lebanon in the 1840s, Bishop Abdallah Bostani made \\"an impassioned plea to the women of France\\" stating: \\"thus would our freedom be restored to us; are we not united with you, O French in heart? Is not our blood and honour your blood and honour?...Our enemies curse and deride us saying: where are your French friends? Where are your Christian kings? Where are their warships and soldiers? Did they come to your aid, O infidel dogs?...It was our love for France and our calling upon her for support that has brought upon us these catastrophes\\". Bishop Abdallah Bostani had fervently applauded the Maronite delegate to Rome, Bishop Nicolas Murad, in his tour of European capitals pushing for the return of a Christian government to Mount Lebanon. Keeping him supplied with petitions of supplication from his parishioners, Abdallah Bostani sent Bishop Murad letters and petitions which decried the violent conditions \\"in the bishopric that Bustani had served so faithfully for forty years\\". Cardinal Fransoni, the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, was asked by Murad and Bostani to plea the Holy See for the return of stability to Mount Lebanon, including the return of Bashir II as governor. During the Civil War of 1860, Archbishop Bostani's archdiocese suffered terribly, with 101 churches destroyed and 13 priests killed. Though having gone into hiding to avoid being killed, Archbishop Pierre Bostani was widely celebrated for having tried to save the Christians fleeing the massacres in Jezzine in 1860. Having come to his door, Bostani took them in and wrote Mr. Derighello, the French Consul in Sidon, for armed protection so the group may travel safely to Sidon. Though many would be killed en route, a few arrived safely to Sidon where they received shelter at the French Consul's residence. Bishop Pierre Bostani was very thankful to the French Empire of Napoleon III who had sent a fleet of 6000 men to Lebanon following the 1860 Civil War. In a letter to Charles Schefer (1820‚Äì1898), Napoleon III's envoy to Lebanon and the French Foreign Ministry's First Secretary Interpreter for Oriental Languages, Bishop Bostani wrote that the French have come \\"to protect the Christians and deliver them from oppression and tyranny\\". The Maronite Patriarch communicated to Schefer that the arrival of French forces to Lebanon had \\"saved us from imminent total ruin\\". Pierre Bostani became Archbishop of Tyre and Sidon on October 5, 1866. As this archdiocese neither had an official seat nor any buildings, Pierre Bostani purchased in 1860 an old palace in Beiteddine which he restored and enlarged thus making it a seminary and the official seat of his archbishopric. He restored seven churches which had been destroyed, and built six others. He founded the college of Saint Joseph in Jezzine and restored an hospice and a Maronite monastery both located in Deir al-Qamar. The French historian Baptistin Poujoulat made the following observation of Bishop Pierre Bostani in 1860: \\"In general, all the Maronite bishops are recommended by their virtue and knowledge of science. One of these, Boutros Bostani, a child of the country, has in him something of F√©nelon and Bossuet. He is gentle, pious, persuasive; he is knowledgeable, invicible in his faith, eloquent. He has upheld, recently, magnificent battles against Anglicanism which aims to take hold, in vain, of the Catholic mountain. These honorable struggles have given him the name Thunder of the Protestants. Too poor to pay for professors in his college of Machemouch√©, he is personally responsible for almost all the education. Within this college, thrice burnt by the Druze and twice rebuilt by the Bishop, he taught not only theology but also philosophy, history, Arab and Syriac literature, and jurisprudence\\". Like many Maronite bishops at this time, Pierre Bostani was the de facto diplomatic representative of his bishopric vis-√†-vis the European nations represented in Lebanon. For example, he had been prudent in overly trusting the new French consul appointed to Beirut, Count Bentivoglio. Though the brother-in-law of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Colonna- Walewski, an illegitimate son of Napoleon I, Bostani feared that Bentivoglio was indeed not French but an Italian who had no former schooling in the art of diplomacy. Bostani spoke of the fact that Bentivoglio had served in the Italian army as a major and was only French by nationality. He referred to him as the \\"Consul Intruder\\". He particularly attacked the Consul for enriching himself from funds sent from France for the needy, accusing him of spending 12000 francs for the road in front of his residence to be paved \\"so that his lady belles could be comfortable when calling on him\\". Like many Maronite bishops, Bostani and the Maronites \\"were in the habit of having recourse to the consuls of France as if they were French themselves\\", stating that \\"their blood had been mixed for many generations\\". Travels to Rome, Paris, Constantinople Bostani accompanied Maronite Patriarch Massad on his trip to Rome in June 1867 to attend the 1800th anniversary of the martyrdom of Saints Peter and Paul. Patriarch Massad was the second Maronite Patriarch to travel to Rome after Jeremy el-Amchiti had done so in the 13th century. It was in Rome that Archbishop Bostani was named Assistant to the Pontifical Throne by Pope Pius IX on June 17, 1867. In becoming Assistant to the Pontifical Throne, Pierre Bostani immediately entered the Papal nobility as Count of Rome. Following Rome, Patriarch Massad and Bostani travelled to France where they met Napoleon III. The delegation then journeyed to Constantinople where they were received by Sultan Abdul-Aziz in his palace. Archbishop Bostani was presented with the Ottoman Order of the Medjidie. Two years later, Patriarch Massad requested that Archbishop Bostani head the Maronite delegation that would attend the First Vatican Council in Rome in 1869. On Friday 1 July 1870, during the 80th General Congregation of the Council, Archbishop Bostani celebrated the official mass in the Vatican. The Council had just met when King Victor Emmanuel II attacked Rome and deposed Pope Pius IX. Pius IX suspended the Council indefinitely on October 20, 1870. Arrest and exile On 1 June 1878, Archbishop Bostani was arrested and exiled to Jerusalem under order of Governor Rustem Pasha who personally blamed the Archbishop of violently turning the Maronite population against his authority.http://booksnow1.scholarsportal.info/ebooks/oca9/5/annalescatholiqu25pari/annalescatholiqu25pari.pdf Never before had a Maronite prelate been exiled under order of an Ottoman governor. The Maronite population wrote to the Ottoman Grand Vizier, as well as the ambassadors of France, Russia, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Austria to protest the arrest and exile of the Archbishop. Cardinal Guibert of Paris and Bishop Dupanloup of Orl√©ans both summoned the French government to pressure the Ottoman Porte in reinstating Archbishop Bostani to his archdiocese. Governor Rustem Pasha was immediately called to the Sublime Porte in Constantinople to justify his actions. Upon the insistence of the French government, Archbishop Pierre Bostani returned to his Archdiocese on a French warship on 9 November 1878 Overseen by the Maronite Patriarch himself, the Maronites celebrated the return of their Archbishop with grand festivities that were long remembered by the Lebanese afterwards. In his book on the history of Ottoman Lebanon, Engin Akarli argues that prelates such as Bostani and Archbishop Dibs of Beirut purposefully rallied the Maronites against the Ottoman government following the Ottoman state's defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878. Unfortunately for Bostani, the French ambassador in Constantinople and the British consul in Beirut, including the Apostolic Delegate Luigi Piavi, all sided with Rustem Pasha against him. French pressures at home would ultimately push the French government in reinstating Bostani.

It measured the fluxes of electrons and ions with energies from 40 eV to 20 keV. The primary purpose of the experiment was to examine plasma particles originating from the Sun and the low-energy particle flux in the Earth's magnetic tail. Design The CPLEE had a mass of , a stowed volume of 2540 cubic cm, and used 3.0 W power normally and 6.0 W at night when the survival heater was on. The main part of the instrumentation consisted of two electrostatic analyzers. One of these (analyzer A) pointed toward local lunar vertical, and the other (analyzer B) to a point 60 deg from vertical toward lunar west. Both detectors had fields of view of 4 x 20 degrees; for analyzer A the long axis of the field of view was oriented N-S, and for analyzer B, E-W. As a first approximation, both detectors could be considered to point in the ecliptic plane. Each analyzer consisted of a set of direction-defining slits, deflection plates, five small-aperture (1 mm nominal) C-shaped channel electron multipliers, one large-aperture (8 mm nominal) helical channel electron multiplier and 6 accumulators. For a given voltage applied to the deflection plates, the five small-aperture multipliers were arranged to count particles of one polarity with differing energies, while the large-aperture multiplier simultaneously made a wide-band measurement of particles of the opposite polarity. During each 19.2-s interval in the automatic mode of experiment operation, deflection voltages of zero (twice, for background and calibration) and plus and minus 35, 350, and 3500 were applied to the deflection plates for 2.4 s at each voltage. Each analyzer would make measurements for 1.2 s and transmit while the other analyzer was operating. The little-used manual mode permitted the continuous application of a single deflection voltage, thus increasing temporal resolution for particles in a limited portion of the spectrum. Useful data obtained during each 19.2-s interval (automatic mode) where, for each analyzer, 1.2-s accumulated counts of electrons and ions in 18 energy windows between 40 eV and 20 keV. The windows utilizing all 6 detectors at 35 V are centered roughly at 40, 50, 65, 70, 95, and 200 eV, the windows at 350 V are 10x and at 3500 V are 100x these values. A dust cover with a 63Ni radioactive source on the underside over each aperture for calibration protected the instrument. The instrument was designed by Prof. Brian J. O'Brien, who was a professor in the Department of Space Science at Rice University. After he left Rice University in 1968, his postdoctoral student David L. Reasoner (PhD., 1968) took over the job of PI of the instrument and its data analysis. Two Rice University students earned PhD's analyzing CPLEE data: Frederick J. Rich (PhD, 1973) and Patricia H. Reiff (PhD, 1975). Apollo 14 ALSEP layout Timelines The ALSEP central station was located at . The charged particle lunar environment experiment was deployed approximately 3 meters northeast of the central station. Leveling to 1.7 degrees, tipped to the east, was accomplished with a bubble level and east-west alignment to within 1 degree with a Sun compass. The instrument was deployed at approximately 18:00 UT on 5 February 1971 and commanded on at 19:00 UT for 5 minutes of functional tests. A checkout procedure was conducted on 6 February from 4:00 to 6:10 UT. Following LM ascent on 6 February at 18:49 UT the dust cover was commanded to be removed at 19:30 UT. The experiment worked normally from deployment until April 8, 1971, when the power supply for the analyzer pointing away from lunar vertical (analyzer B) failed. The other analyzer continued to function normally until June 6, 1971, when a partial failure of the power supply occurred. Operation of this analyzer was intermittent for the rest of 1971. During most of 1972, operation was continuous during lunar night and intermittent during lunar day because high temperatures caused a low voltage condition in the power supply. From December 1972 to February 1973 operation was continuous, after which time the voltage problems occurred again. The Apollo 14 central station signal was lost on 1 March 1975 and reacquired on 5 March. Loss and reacquisition of signal happened sporadically until termination of the ALSEP experiment. Loss- reacquisition occurred in 1976 on 18 January - 19 February, 17 March - 20 May, 8 June - 10 June, 9 October - 12 November and in 1977 on 30 July - 4 August. The CPLEE experiment was in standby mode when the ALSEP stations were turned off on 30 September 1977.

His father was the industrialist-politician and book dealer Antoine-Augustin Renouard. His maternal grandfather was Charles-Gr√©goire de Beauchamps. He attended the prestigious Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand (school) a few hundred meters to the south of the city centre, and then relocated to London where he began a business career, working for a banker.

However, in 1928, he was elected as general secretary of the DMA, also winning a seat on the executive of the MFGB. He stood repeatedly for other offices in the MFGB: vice-president in 1931, 1932 and 1934 and president in 1930 and 1939, but was never successful.

The population is greatest in the rainy season. Adult midges spend the day in shady spots such as between the buttress roots of large trees, in crevices in logs, in hollow stumps or in piles of husk debris. They emerge at variable times of day to swarm near their hiding locations, and disperse in the late afternoons and early mornings. Most midges do not move further than about . The females lay batches of up to about ninety eggs on damp piles of plant debris. The eggs hatch after two or three days and the larvae pass through four instar stages before pupating at about twelve days. The adults survive for about a week and there are thought to be about twelve generations of the midge per year. Both sexes feed on the pollen of the cacao flower, but four times more males visit the flowers than do females.

It is the eighth installment in the Saw film series. The film stars Matt Passmore, Callum Keith Rennie, Cl√© Bennett, and Hannah Emily Anderson. The plot follows a group of people who find themselves forced to participate in a series of deadly \\"games\\" inside a barn. Meanwhile, the police leads an investigation on a new series of murders that fit the eponymous Jigsaw Killer's modus operandi, who has been dead for almost a decade at this point. 2010's Saw 3D was originally deemed the final installment of the series, before Lionsgate commissioned the production of Jigsaw from a pitch by Stolberg and Goldfinger. Filming began in November 2016, with post-production following in January. The film was released by Lionsgate in the United States on October 27, 2017. Jigsaw received mostly unfavorable reviews from critics, but was a commercial success, grossing $103 million worldwide against a $10 million budget. A ninth installment in the series, Spiral, is set to be released in 2021. Plot Nearly a decade after the death of John Kramer, criminal Edgar Munsen is pursued by the police. After being cornered by Detectives Halloran and Keith Hunt, he claims that he must start another \\"game\\" in exchange for his own survival, and activates a remote trigger before it gets shot out of his hand; however, a shot hits Edgar in the chest and he collapses. Elsewhere, five people ‚Äì Mitch, Anna, Ryan, Carly, and an unconscious man ‚Äì awaken inside a barn with buckets on their heads and chains around their necks. A tape recording from John Kramer explains that they have all sinned and must sacrifice some blood to survive before the chains begin pulling them towards a wall of buzzsaws. Most of the group survives by cutting themselves, except for the unconscious man, who awakens too late. Their next test reveals that Carly is a purse snatcher, who accidentally caused the death of an asthmatic woman. To save the others from being hanged, she must inject herself with one of three needles ‚Äì one containing an antidote to a poison in her system, another one saline, and the last one acid. She refuses, so Ryan stabs her with all three, killing her and saving the others. Halloran and Hunt investigate the discovery of corpses that appear to be the unconscious man and Carly, whose deaths fit John's modus operandi. Halloran becomes suspicious of pathologists Logan Nelson and Eleanor Bonneville. Later, Edgar is abducted from the hospital, and his corpse is found inside John's grave when it is exhumed by the police. Meanwhile, Ryan attempts to escape through a door with the words \\"No Exit\\" on it, but his leg falls through loose floorboards, and is ensnared by wires. Another tape recorder reveals that he will be punished for breaking the rules and must pull a lever to be \\"set free.\\" Anna and Mitch enter a silo and are trapped inside, forcing Ryan to pull the lever and sever his leg to rescue them. Eleanor reveals to Logan that she is a fangirl of Jigsaw and has built replicas of many of his traps in her studio but now fears that this might incriminate her. Hunt follows them and informs Halloran. Elsewhere, Mitch is revealed to have sold a motorcycle with a faulty brake to John's nephew, resulting in his death, and is tested by being lowered into a funnel with a spiral-shaped blade powered by a motorcycle engine inside. He attempts to stop the blade by reaching a brake at the bottom of the funnel but is ultimately killed. Halloran finds a corpse appearing to be Mitch in Eleanor's studio and calls for her and Logan's arrest. Logan convinces Hunt to let them go after telling him that the bullet which hit Edgar was fired by Halloran, whom he and Eleanor suspect is the new Jigsaw killer. Eleanor deduces the game's location and she and Logan depart for the barn, with Halloran in pursuit. Meanwhile, Hunt finds jigsaw-shaped pieces of flesh in Halloran's freezer, further incriminating Halloran. In the barn, Anna and Ryan are shackled and meet John Kramer face- to-face, still alive apparently, who reveals that Anna suffocated her baby and framed her husband, and Ryan caused his friends' death in a car accident. Their final test involves a shotgun, which John claims is the key to their survival, and he leaves after telling them they've gotten his message backward. Anna attempts to shoot Ryan, but the gun backfires and kills her. Ryan realizes the keys to his and Anna's chains were inside the gun and got destroyed when Anna fired it and is left to die. Logan and Eleanor are ambushed by Halloran at the barn. Eleanor escapes, while Halloran is drugged by an unseen assailant. Logan and Halloran awaken in collars rigged with laser cutters, and are told to confess their sins to survive. Halloran forces Logan to go first, and he confesses to mislabeling John's x-rays years prior, causing his cancer to go undiagnosed; despite confessing, Logan is apparently killed. Halloran then admits to allowing criminals to walk free for personal gain and his collar deactivates. Logan is revealed to still be alive, and also the man who apparently died in the first barn game, which occurred ten years prior. Deciding that Logan should not die over an honest mistake, John saved him and recruited him as his first apprentice. Logan then reveals that he framed Halloran as the new Jigsaw killer as revenge for releasing Edgar, who killed his wife, and that he recreated the barn games using other criminals that Halloran let go as victims. Claiming that he and Halloran were the final participants and that Halloran broke the rules by forcing him to go first, Logan reactivates his collar, killing Halloran, and leaves after saying he \\"speaks for the dead.\\" Cast * Matt Passmore as Logan Nelson * Tobin Bell as John Kramer / Jigsaw * Callum Keith Rennie as Detective Halloran * Cl√© Bennett as Detective Keith Hunt * Hannah Emily Anderson as Eleanor Bonneville * Laura Vandervoort as Anna * Paul Braunstein as Ryan * Mandela Van Peebles as Mitch * Brittany Allen as Carly * Josiah Black as Edgar Munsen Production =Development= Saw 3D was intended to be the final Saw film. The film was set to be split into two parts, but Lionsgate only allowed the filmmakers to make one more film after Saw VI under-performed at the box office. According to Saw 3D writers Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton, because of the change, \\"the big reveal of Dr. Gordon was a bit underserved ... perhaps creating more questions than answers. There were several ideas [we] never quite figured out. But [I] don't want to say what they were, because you never know what might happen in the future.\\" After the intended conclusion, Lionsgate ceased making Saw films, while waiting to hear a pitch that they thought made it worthwhile to resurrect the series. Jigsaw was conceived when writers Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger, who had spent two years pursuing the opportunity to write a Saw entry, proposed their vision. It became known in July 2016 that brothers Michael and Peter Spierig would direct the film. The producers Mark Burg and Oren Koules had also produced the previous entries in the Saw series. Composer Charlie Clouser has described the film as a \\"reinvention\\" of the series, opining that \\"the Spierig brothers can deliver a fresh take on the material that will establish a new story line and new characters that can carry the saga into the future\\". The directors further detailed their approach as being \\"Saw for 2017\\", and Michael Spierig explained, \\"It's perhaps not quite as vicious, and more fun. But it's still full of gore, that's for sure. It's got a really great mystery, and there are very interesting twists\\". =Filming= In October 2016, production was confirmed to have commenced under the working title of Saw: Legacy. The film was shot in Toronto in November 2016, and entered post-production by January. On March 2, 2017, Bloody Disgusting revealed the first plot details and a full actor list, confirming that Tobin Bell would return in the role of John Kramer. In June 2017, the Motion Picture Association of America listed the film under the official title of Jigsaw, rating it R, for \\"sequences of grisly bloody violence and torture, and for language\\". On August 14, 2017, the film passed uncut in the United Kingdom with an 18 Certificate by the BBFC. In regard to the new title, writer Josh Stolberg clarified that \\"when a writer is writing a movie, they put something on the cover page to separate it from other films. So when we were writing this film, the title read Saw: Legacy but it was never official or 'decided'.\\" Marketing =Poster releases= On September 16, 2017, Lionsgate released five posters to promote Jigsaw. The posters show off people in the traditional Billy the Puppet makeup, captioned \\"He is Everything. He is Everywhere. He is Everyone\\". The release of the posters was Lionsgate's way of reasserting the series' dominance over the Halloween season. =Halloween Blood Drive= The Annual Blood Drive is the series' tradition, where before the release of the films in October, mobile blood stations are set up around the United States, where fans who donate blood receive a free ticket to see the respective film of that year. The tradition started in 2004, after the overwhelming success of Saw, and continued for each of the sequels until it stopped in 2009 before the release of Saw VI. Due to the arrival of Jigsaw in October, the blood drive was revived for another year, promoting the film with eight posters released by Lionsgate, featuring \\"Nurses\\" Grae Drake, Dan Rockwell, Susanne Bartch, Nyakim Gatwech, Shaun Ross, Mosh, Mykie, and Amanda LePore. As of September 25, 2017, 120,000 pints (57,000 L) of blood had been donated, which has led to over 360,000 lives being saved.https://movieweb.com/jigsaw-movie-posters- nurses-saw-8-blood-drive/ Music Charlie Clouser, who provided the score for all previous entries in the Saw series, returned to score Jigsaw. Clouser re-imagined the music of the Saw franchise, following the six-year hiatus between Saw 3D and Jigsaw. Clouser stated in 2016, \\"this will be an opportunity [for me] to re-imagine how [I] approach the score, and [I] will be trying a more stark, bold, and stripped-down approach that will be more in line with the strong vision that the Spierig brothers are bringing to the table\\". The soundtrack of the film was distributed digitally on October 27, 2017. Some tracks from the film can also be found on Volume 2 of the Saw Anthology Collection. Release Jigsaw was released in the United Kingdom on October 26, 2017, and in the United States theatrically on October 27, 2017. It was featured in IMAX screenings for the first week of its theatrical run. =Box office= Jigsaw has grossed $38.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $64.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $102.9 million, against a production budget of $10 million. In the United States and Canada, Jigsaw was released alongside Thank You for Your Service and Suburbicon, and is projected to gross around $20 million from 2,941 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $1.6 million from Thursday night previews at 2,400 theaters, just below the $1.7 million Saw 3D made from midnight screenings seven years prior, and $7.2 million on its first day. It went on to open to $16.64 million, finishing first at the box office but marking the second lowest debut of the franchise. In its second weekend the film dropped 61% to $6.56 million, finishing third behind newcomers Thor: Ragnarok and A Bad Moms Christmas. In its third weekend, the film dropped another 47% and made $3.43 million, finishing fifth. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 4.76/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Jigsaw definitely won't win many converts to the Saw franchise, but for longtime fans, it should prove a respectably revolting‚Äîif rarely scary‚Äîdiversion.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported women under 25 (21% of the film's audience) and older males (30%) gave it a 76% and 70% overall positive score, respectively. IGN gave the film a score of 4.5/10, writing \\"The good news is, Jigsaw is not the worst horror movie of the year. The bad news is, it's still bad enough that that's the good news...[It] doesn't capture what made the Saw franchise work in the first place.\\" Darren French of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"C\\", calling it disappointing and overly long. Bloody Disgusting gave the film two and a half out of five, saying the film \\"while being a fun ride, fails to justify its existence with a story that is overly familiar and a twist that doesn't live up to most of its predecessors\\". Varietys Owen Gleiberman found the film \\"garishly rote\\" saying \\"For 92 minutes, it more or less succeeds in sawing through your boredom, slicing and dicing with a glum explicitness that raises the occasional tingle of gross-out suspense but no longer carries any kick of true shock value.\\" Germain Lussier of io9 largely panned the film saying \\"[it] is one of the better films in the franchise. Unfortunately, that's not saying much.\\" =Home media= Jigsaw was released digitally on January 9, 2018, and on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on January 23, 2018. It was the first Saw film to be re-released in 4K. Sequel The ninth installment of the Saw franchise known as Spiral is an upcoming American horror film that is the sequel to Jigsaw. The sequel film, directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, stars Chris Rock, Samuel L. Jackson, Max Minghella, and Marisol Nichols. Production took place in Toronto from July to August 2019. Lionsgate Films planned to release Spiral in theaters on May 15, 2020, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was moved to May 21, 2021.

The site is located 741 metres above sea level (and 200 metres above the valley floor) at the southwest end of the Serra Grossa. The site covers over 4 hectares and is 650 metres long and 150 metres wide. The site is now an archaeological park, surrounded by pine forest and bush but accessible by road.  History of investigation  The site was first described in 1909 by Luis Tortosa. The first archaeological excavations were begun in 1928 by the newly created Servicio de Investigaci√≥n Prehist√≥rica of the Valencian Community. Four campaigns were carried out between 1928 and 1931. 250 rooms were excavated and a number of important artefacts were recovered, including the Guerrero de Mogente, small lead plaques with inscriptions in the Southeast variant of Iberian, and weapons and jewellery. In newspapers of the time, the site was described as a \\"new Pompeii\\". Further excavations have been carried out in the 1990s and this century.  Fortifications  Wall and west (main) gate (Bastida de les Alcusses) The site is walled, with walls more than 3 metres thick at the most vulnerable points. Four gates give access to the interior of the site, three at the western end and one at the eastern. Two towers extrude from the wall at the western end, where the main gate is located. The gatehouses all contain internal benches, possibly guard posts or spaces for controlling the passage of goods. The gates themselves were wooded, reinforced with iron bands. The stone lower half of the gates and walls is still in existence while the upper half, which would have been built from adobe bricks and included a walkway, is lost. At the western end, an additional external area may also have been more weakly fortified, perhaps as a refuge for people in the surrounding area. The secondary gates at the western end were blocked up during the occupation of the site, presumably to improve defensibility.  Urban layout and domestic architecture  The buildings are organised around a central street that runs from east to west through the middle of the town. Secondary streets run perpendicular to this main street and some open plazas were left without buildings. A communal granary is found in the centre of the site. The houses are of different sizes, ranging from 20 to 150 metres squared. The houses have the same building technique as the walls, with adobe bricks above a stone base. The walls would have then been whitewashed and sometimes even painted. The houses are of a single floor but the flat roof (at a slight angle) was accessible and may have been used for some activities. There may have been around ninety to one hundred and twenty houses over the whole site, housing a population of 450 to 840 persons. The central part of each house was a hearth, the meeting point and symbol of family life. A storage room at the back was used to keep foodstuffs and tools. Further spaces housed milling equipment and more specialised activities such as metallurgy, weaving and other artisanal activities.  Everyday life: agriculture and trade  Agricultural tools recovered at the site Bronze votive figure of ox with plough (Bastida de les Alcusses) Agricultural and pastoral tasks were a fundamental part of everyday subsistence. The principal crops were unirrigated cereals (barley, wheat and millet) as well as legumes (broad beans and peas). Fruits and nuts were also important, especially olives, vines, almonds and figs. Cultivation was done with wooden ploughs reinforced with iron ploughshares, of which a number have been found in the houses of the town. Other agricultural tools found at the site include billhooks, sickles, hoes and rakes, forming one of the most complete tool assemblages known for pre- Roman agriculture in Spain. The most common livestock were sheep and goats, with some bovines and pigs. These animals were used for milk, wool, leather and meat, and were also necessary for ploughing and to pull carts. Some wild species were also hunted, included rabbits, hares, deer, mountain goats and wild boar. Finally, fish hooks found at the site indicate that the nearby Canyoles river was also an important food source. Trade and commercial activities were also an important part of the economic life of the town. Weights and balances have been found, doubtless used in commercial transactions and perhaps related to the small silver and bronze ingots also found at the site. The silver was obtained through the cupellation of lead, carried out in some houses. One of the inscribed lead plaques found on the site is inscribed with a list of names, with different quantities written beside each name and many of the names crossed out. This plaque is generally interpreted as a form of account or receipt. The plaque is 180 by 40 millimetres and 1 millimetre thick and was found in the excavations of 1928, rolled up and placed under a grinding stone in department 48. Various objects found in the excavations also point to connections across the Mediterranean. From the Strait of Gibraltar there are amphoras that contained salted fish products and included amongst the local tablewares are plates and cups imported from Athens. Some of these imported pieces were imitated by Iberian potters.  Social structure  The Guerrero de Mogente (7.3 cm), a bronze votive discovered in 1931 by Vicente Esp√≠ while working in Department 218. (Bastida de les Alcusses) The inhabitants of la Bastida lived in a stratified society. Status and wealth are shown in jewellery, house size and imported goods. The Guerrero de Mogente likely represents a high status man: the figure is represented as naked to show his heroic nature, and carries the distinctive Iberian curved sword (falcata), a small round shield (caetra), and wears a helmet with a large plume. The offerings deposited in the principal (west) gate, also indicate the symbolic importance of a full panoply including sword and shield. The association of swords with ploughs may also indicate that such figures also controlled good agricultural lands. High status women may have been signalled through fine clothing and are associated with loom weights.  Destruction and abandonment  The settlement was occupied for only a short time before being destroyed around 330 BC. As such, it was probably only inhabited for three or four generations. The blockage of two of the gates, remains of a fire, and the numerous weapons and personal items found in the streets all indicate a rapid and violent end to the site's occupation. The context of the sack of La Bastida is unclear but most likely relates to conflicts between different Iberian groups, although whether all the combatants were from the local area or groups from further afield were involved is unknown. Competition between the many sites in the area for control of the important transport route from the coast into the southern Meseta, or control of arable land in the Canyoles valley may have been motivating factors.  Visiting times  Reconstruction of the main room of an Iberian house (Bastida de les Alcusses) The Museum of Mogente/Moixent and the site of La Bastida may be visited all year round. Entry to the site is free. The site is open from 10am to 2pm and from 4pm to 6pm (winter months) or from 4pm to 8pm (summer months), Tuesday to Sunday. The site has a guide service as well as information panels for self-guided visits. Immediately outside the site, a full-scale replica of an Iberian house has been reconstructed using the appropriate materials and techniques. In addition, many of the items recovered from La Bastida can be seen at the Valencian Museum of Prehistory.

He is most-known for his Chesterfield cigarettes advertisements and Steinway & Sons portraits that ran during the early 1900s. Chambers also illustrated stories for writers W. Somerset Maugham and Pearl S. Buck, among others. These appeared in various magazines including, Cosmopolitan, Harper's, and Redbook. Personal life and education Charles Edward Chambers - The Bride Chambers was born on August 9, 1883 in Ottumwa, Iowa to Horatio Cox Chambers (1849-1914) and Rosa A. Lee Chambers (1849-1920). He had one sibling, Helen Lee Chambers (1880-1899). Chambers received his education in art from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Later, he attended the National Academy of Design, where he studied under George Bridgman. One of Chambers' teachers was Fanny Musnell (1884-1920). She was an illustrator for national magazines including, Cosmopolitan and Woman's Home Companion. Her style of illustration influenced Chambers, and the two would eventually marry. They remained together till her death in 1920. Chambers later remarried to Pauline True (1912-?), the model from his 1933 Red Cross painting. On November 4, 1941, Chambers died in New York, New York. He is buried in Ottumwa Cemetery in Iowa. Career In the beginning of his career, Chambers illustrated a short story series centered on con man, Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford. Throughout his career, he would continue to illustrate short stories for writers, Pearl Buck, Louis Bromfield, Faith Baldwin, and W. Somerset Maugham. These would appear in the magazines, Harper's, Cosmopolitan, Woman's Home Companion, Ladies' Home Journal, and McCall's. 1919 Harper's cover illustrated by Chambers Chambers' illustrations worked for both advertisements and editorial assignments. He would frequently contribute to Harper's Monthly; many times his illustrations wound up on the cover. His illustrations also appeared on the cover of Redbook magazine. For years, Chambers had an exclusive contract with Cosmopolitan magazine. \\"Food Will Win the War\\" in Yiddish In 1917, during World War I, Chambers illustrated a poster for the United States Food Administration, titled \\"Food Will Win the War.\\" On the poster, it reads: \\"Food Will Win the War. You came here seeking freedom. You must now help preserve it. Wheat is needed for the allies. Waste nothing.\\" Its target demographic was immigrants. To further drive this point, the poster was produced in many languages: Yiddish, Italian, Spanish, and Hungarian. In the 1920s, Chambers was commissioned by Steinway & Sons to paint portraits of popular pianists. These portraits of pianists, which included Sergie Rachmaninoff, Josef Hoffman, Alfred Cortot, and Paderewski, were widely reproduced for nine years. Chambers was also commissioned by Chesterfield cigarettes. His series of billboard advertisements ran for five years. In 1931, these depictions of radiant models smoking, alongside a memorable catchphrase, was considered by Advertising Outdoors as, \\"the most beautiful posters ever painted.\\" In all, he illustrated 45 billboard displays for Chesterfield cigarettes. Chambers was also responsible for illustrating billboard advertisements for Palmolive soap. His illustrations set high standards for twenty-by-four outdoor posters of the time. In 1912, Chambers became a member of the Society of Illustrators. He was later President of the Artists Guild and member of the Allied AA. Chambers' style of painting has been described as, \\"extremely competent, marked by subtlety of value and color.\\" Other critics have said that because of the \\"polish\\" of his paintings, one would think he had studied at the French Academy. The use of color was considered his strength. In 1931, he was awarded the 2nd Altman Prize at the National Academy of Design exhibition for his portrait of artist John Alonzo Williams. In 2010, Chambers was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Society of Illustrators.

Since 1982, they have produced hand-painted figurines designed to educate children, with the stated goal of teaching the importance of nature and conservation through play. The company's offerings include more than 1,000 products, spanning from the mystical to the historical‚Äîdinosaurs, wildlife, dragons and fairies, horses and farm life, reptiles and sea life. History Safari Ltd was founded in 1982 by a German-born husband and wife team, Bernard and Rosemarie Rubel. Their goal was to aid in wildlife conservation by raising awareness of endangered species. Inspired by a deck of educational playing cards featuring photographs of endangered animals, they initially began by photographing native species in Florida and selling postcards of the photos at zoos and other attractions. The Rubels would later return to Germany and lay eyes on the educational figurines that led them to develop the museum-quality figurines Safari manufactures today. The company soon expanded to offer toys based on dinosaurs and prehistoric life, utilizing the paleontology community to aid in making the most scientifically accurate figure based on current research. This led to the company's partnership with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. As a result of the partnership and realistic quality of the figurines, Safari was considered a leader in the animal figurine niche. Presently, Safari Ltd is run by the Rubels‚Äô grandson Alexandre Pariente, who heads the company with his wife, Christina Pariente. Under Alexandre's tenure the company has invested more in developing online resources, including an in-house wikisource coined SafariPedia that encourages children and educators to use it in tandem with Safari Ltd products. Brand Bernie the Gator is Safari Ltd's mascot and pays homage to founder Bernard Amadeus Rubel. The alligator is a popular animal commonly associated with the state of Florida, where Safari Ltd is headquartered. Design All figurines are phthalate and lead free, and adhere to worldwide testing standards. A group of professional sculptors research each animal's anatomy prior to creating a lifelike model. This model is then sent to the manufacturer for large scale production, and each figurine is hand painted in order to capture the animal's unique and distinctive features. Each figurine in inscribed with its name on the belly on the animal (in English) to aid in easy identification of the animal. Retailers The company is headquartered in Miami Lakes, Florida, selling to a principal market within the United States, but services international markets as well. Safari Ltd sells to distributors and retailers around the globe, providing museum-quality figurines to zoos, museums, aquariums, specialty toy stores, gift stores, arts and crafts stores, educational stores and more.

The airborne sensor operator is considered a principal flight crew or aircrew member.  Past and present  The modern airborne sensor operator profession began in 1858 when Gaspard-Felix Tournachon ‚ÄúNadar‚Äù first took aerial photographs of Paris from a hot air balloon.Paul R. Baumann, Remote sensing and airborne sensor operator duties continued to grow from there; one of the first planned uses of remote sensing and operators occurred during the U.S. Civil War when manned and unmanned balloons were flown over enemy territory with cameras.Northstar Gallery, The first governmental-organized air photography missions were developed for military surveillance during World Wars I and II but reached a climax during the Cold War.Paul R. Baumann, However, the airborne sensor operator profession developed ever so more in all industry sectors during these decades with the advancement of radar, lasers, radio/signal receivers and electro- optical/infra-red technology. Today, with the advancement of smaller and more powerful remote sensing systems along with smaller and economical manned and unmanned platforms, the airborne remote sensing industry is expanding in line with many other expanding industry sectors that in the past could not afford and/or try to apply this capability. With this, the airborne sensor operator profession continues to expand and support the need for ever more precision Information.  Overview  = Responsibilities & duties = The primary responsibilities of an airborne sensor operator are to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft, effectively operate assigned remote sensing systems and support the processing, exploitation and dissemination of collected information. Some of the general duties of an airborne sensor operator are: ‚Ä¢ Flight and sensor planning, ‚Ä¢ Sensor installation, testing & maintenance ‚Ä¢ Flight & crew management ‚Ä¢ Collection management ‚Ä¢ Sensor operations ‚Ä¢ Quality control (QC) of acquired data ‚Ä¢ Processing, exploitation and dissemination of acquired data = Industry sectors = The specific industry sectors that require airborne sensor operators are varied. The primary sectors are in the commercial surveying, science, public safety & security and defense. Most airborne sensor operators either work for specific government organizations or aerial surveying-imaging firms specializing in data acquisition & processing versus directly with the end user. In the commercial sector, airborne sensor operators primarily support the agricultural, construction, power supply and mining industries. They routinely support crop monitoring, power line mapping, pipeline monitoring, and geophysical surveying. However, airborne sensor operators support many other sectors that include radio & television, private security, marketing and real estate.Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Association, In the science & academic sector, airborne sensor operators primarily support both the commercial and academic communities with developing and testing new remote sensing technology and advancing the knowledge base of specific academic disciplines. In the academic sector, airborne sensor operators are currently supporting archeologist, geologist and meteorologist to integrate remote sensing data into their various disciplines, methods and studies.Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Association, In the public safety & security sector, airborne sensor operators primarily support law enforcement and firefighting operations. In the law enforcement sector, the sensor operator is known as a Tactical Flight Officer (TFO) which includes many air- to-ground coordination responsibilities besides managing the aircraft's primary sensors.Ken Solosky 30 Oct 2008, Furthermore, airborne law enforcement sensor operators support border-control, maritime security and counter- narcotic operations. In the firefighting sector, sensor operators are used in forest firefighting‚Äù Lead Plane‚Äù functions, metropolitan & urban firefighting support and search & rescue operations.American Helicopter Services & Aerial Firefighting Association, In the defense sector, airborne sensor operators primarily support intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance collection operations. The type of collection and systems they manage are in the military disciplines of Signal Intelligence (SIGINT), Measurement Intelligence (MASINT), and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT).Federation of American Scientists, However, airborne sensor operators also operate in many other military roles which include tactical combat operations and Combat Search & Rescue (CSAR).Rob Powers, ‚ÄúAFSC 1U0X1, Unmanned Aerospace System (UAS) Sensor Operator‚Äù, About.com ‚Äì Careers-Military, = Platforms and systems = Airborne Sensor Operators perform their functions on/with both manned and unmanned aircraft with either active or passive sensors.Jeffrey S. Myers and Richard L. Miller, In regard to manned platforms, Airborne Sensor Operators operate on board large to small fix-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. The typical fixed-wing aircraft used in commercial, academic and public safety operations is either single or twin engine general aviation airframes (C-172, TECNAM 2006, King Air) with a minimum capability to support a crew of two, power supply, workstation, sensor payload, data links and endurance to meet collection requirements.Airborne Technologies, Fix-Wing, The typical fix-wing aircraft used in military operations varies from small single or twin engine general aviation airframes (C-332 Skymaster) to purpose built military airframes like the P-3 Orion, S-3 Viking and the new P-8 Poseidon, to large wide-body jet aircraft (RC-135) with multiple work stations and long endurance capabilities.The Spyflight, C-337 and RC-135, The typical manned rotorcraft (R22/44, Eurocopter EC145, Bell 205 SH-60 M/R Seahawk) used by all industry sectors is either light turbine or twin engine helicopters with a minimum capability to support a crew of two, power supply, workstation, sensor payload, data link and endurance to meet collection requirements.Airborne Technologies, rotary-wing, In regard to unmanned platforms, airborne sensor operators operate off-board of fixed-wing and rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The primary categories of UAVs that airborne sensor operators support are Mid-Altitude Long Endurance (MALE / RQ-1, Heron) and High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE / RQ-4, RQ-9) systems.UVS-INFO, Micro, small or tactical UAV systems usually require one operator who acts as both pilot and sensor operator. Typically, a UAV sensor operator is positioned next to the UAV operator/pilot at a stationary or mobile Ground Control Unit (GCU) with computer hardware & software to manage both flight, sensor and data-link operations. In regard to sensors, airborne sensor operators work with either active sensors or passive sensors. The typical active sensors used by sensor operators are Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and sonar.Nick Oza, 5/26/2011, Bright Hub, The typical passive sensors used by sensor operators are electro-optical/ infrared (EO/IR), Hyper- spectral, RGB cameras, Thermal cameras, magnetometers and communication/signal receivers.Nick Oza, edited by: RC Davison‚Ä¢updated: 5/20/2011, Bright Hub,Penn State College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, Besides the different type of platforms and sensors that airborne sensor operators work with, operators routinely work with various other types of aircraft systems (emergency, navigation, radios, intercom, data links and data recorders) or ground data processing, exploitation and dissemination hardware & software. = Training = At a minimum, an airborne sensor operator should have the required knowledge or training to effectively operate in the flight environment, operate sensors and provide a usable product to the end user. The following knowledge areas define the baseline of a proficient airborne sensor operator: ‚Ä¢ Theory of flight and aeronautics ‚Ä¢ Meteorology ‚Ä¢ Manned & unmanned aircraft systems & capabilities ‚Ä¢ Aerial navigation ‚Ä¢ Radio & communication operations ‚Ä¢ Flight & airfield operations and procedures ‚Ä¢ Crew resource management (CRM) and human factors (HF) ‚Ä¢ Electro-magnetic spectrum ‚Ä¢ Passive sensor systems & capabilities ‚Ä¢ Active sensor systems & capabilities ‚Ä¢ Sensor operations and maintenance ‚Ä¢ Mission planning & mission management ‚Ä¢ Processing, exploitation and dissemination systems & capabilities The training avenues for airborne sensor operators are either informal or formal. Informal programs consist of on-the-job-training with limited classroom training and immersion with current operations. Informal training usually takes place in-house of established commercial airborne surveying & imaging firms or academic organizations. Formal training routinely consists of initial training and advance training programs. Formal training programs are primarily provided by defense organizations, law enforcement departments and by a limited number of commercial training firms for a fee.National Defense and the Canadian Armed, Airborne Electronic Sensor Operator,L-3 Wescam, The length of each type of training avenue is based on the complexity of the duties required, systems and the resources available. Informal training usually takes from several days to several weeks while formal training programs take several weeks to one year. = Work conditions = Airborne sensor operators work in all kinds of conditions, so it depends on what industry sector one works in. In general, the working conditions get better as an operator gains experience and are able to have a larger, wider choice of who they fly for and what sort of flying that agency or company does. The working conditions vary from working for a regional aerial surveying firm on a part-time base to working full-time in a large organization where there is a career path and other additional duties. Most airborne sensing operators have a variable work schedule, working several days on and several days off based on tasking, availability of assets and weather. A large percentage of sensor operators spend a considerable amount of time away from home because of the diverse locations of collection areas. When airborne sensor operators are away from home, the agencies or companies provide lodging accommodations, transportation between lodging and the airfield or launch/recovery location, and an allowance for meals and other expenses. Remote sensing organizations operate flights at all hours of the day and night, so work schedules often are irregular. Sensor operators are paid hourly in smaller firms and a salary in larger organizations. Benefits are rare but are usually offered at the larger agencies or companies. Average pay is $20 to $30 an hour and the average salary for airborne sensor operator jobs is $41,000 to $54,000.Simply hired, Simply Salary,Indeed.com, However, the average airborne sensor operator hourly wages or salaries can vary greatly due to company, location, industry, experience and benefits.

It was announced during Mobile World Congress as the successor to the 2015 LG G4. The G5 is distinguished from its predecessors by its aluminum chassis and a focus on modularity; the lower housing which holds the battery can be slid from the bottom of the device, and replaced by alternative add-on modules that provide additional functions, such as a camera grip or a high- fidelity audio module with DAC. A lower-spec variation, dubbed the LG G5 SE, is sold in selected markets. The G5 received mixed reviews; while the device's design was praised for its shift to a metal construction while maintaining the ability to remove its battery, the modular accessory system was panned for its limited use cases and inability to perform hot swapping. LG's software was also panned for the quality of its customizations.  Specifications  = Hardware = The G5 is constructed with an aluminum unibody chassis; a \\"micro- dizing\\" process utilizing a plastic primer was used to conceal seams required for the antenna. A rounded rectangular protrusion houses the camera components, and the bottom houses a USB-C connector. Unlike previous G models, the G5's volume buttons were re-located from the back of the device to its side bezel, but the circular power button‚Äîwhich now also contains a fingerprint reader‚Äîremains on the rear. The lower \\"chin\\" can be detached to remove or replace the battery, as well as install add-on modules to add additional functionality. The battery plugs into these modules, which is reinserted to replace the stock \\"chin\\". The G5 utilizes a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 system-on-chip accompanied by 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM, and has 32 GB of internal storage expandable via micro SD card. The G5 includes a 5.3-inch 1440p IPS display. The G5 features two rear-facing cameras; a 16-megapixel primary camera, as well as an 8-megapixel 135 degree wide-angle camera. As with the G4, the rear camera also provides color spectrum sensor and infrared autofocus features. A downgraded variation, LG G5 SE, is sold in selected markets such as Latin America and China. It utilizes a Snapdragon 652 system- on-chip (instead of Snapdragon 820) and only has 3 GB of LPDDR3 RAM (instead of 4 GB). = Software = The LG G5 is bundled with Android 6.0 \\"Marshmallow\\". Citing confusion between removing shortcuts to apps and uninstalling them entirely, the G5's home screen does not feature an \\"app drawer\\", and instead places all apps on pages of the main home screen similarly to iOS. However, there is a setting to enable the app drawer on the home screen. The LG software includes an \\"always-on display\\" feature which persistently displays a clock and notifications on-screen when the device is in standby. LG G5 does not support Android Marshmallow's \\"adoptable storage\\" feature. In November 2016, LG began to deploy an upgrade to Android 7.0 \\"Nougat\\". Android 8.0 \\"Oreo\\" was released in September 2018.  Accessories  The \\"Quick Cover\\" accessory was unveiled prior to the unveiling of the device itself; it is semi-translucent and features a window for the always-on portion of the screen. Touch inputs can be made through the cover and semi-translucent screen for actions such as accepting calls. A line of accessories for the G5 branded as \\"Friends\\" were unveiled alongside the phone itself, including a wired head-mounted display known as the LG 360 VR (which attaches via the device's USB-C port), the LG 360 Cam virtual reality camera, and the LG Rolling Bot. These accessories are all managed via the LG Friends Manager application on the device, which automatically pairs and synchronizes with these devices. The 360 VR is not compatible with the G5 SE model. Two accessories utilizing the expansion slot system were unveiled; the \\"LG Cam Plus\\" accessory adds a grip to the rear of the device that incorporates physical camera controls, a jog wheel for zoom, as well as a supplemental battery. The \\"LG Hi-Fi Plus\\" accessory is a collaboration with Bang & Olufsen which adds a DAC, an amplifier, Direct Stream Digital audio support and upsampling, and is bundled with B&O; Play H3 earbuds. LG stated that it would allow the co-development of third-party \\"Friends\\" to integrate with the G5.  Reception  The LG G5's overall design was praised for its shift to a metal construction. The Next Web was critical of its design, arguing that the rear of the phone looked too \\"boring\\" because it was simply a rounded rectangle with a camera enclosure and power button that \\"protrude in an oddly wart-like manner\\" and a visible seam for the chin, and noting that the lack of curvature and its \\"hollow\\" feel made the design of the G5 \\"less premium\\" than that of the G4. Techradar was also mixed on LG's decision to re-locate the volume keys back to the bezel but maintain the rear-mounted power button as a fingerprint reader, noting that front and side-mounted fingerprint readers were easier to use‚Äîespecially if the device is sitting flat. Due to its use of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 system-on-chip, the G5's specifications were considered to be more competitive in comparison to other flagships, unlike the G4, which used a model with reduced core count to avoid the overheating issues of the Snapdragon 810. Techradar felt that the G5's performance was on par with the Snapdragon 820-based version of the Samsung Galaxy S7 sold in the United States, and that \\"in day-to-day use, and when not directly compared to its rivals' performance in a lab, it feels super slick.\\" The modular accessory system received mixed reviews due to the limited number of modules designed for it, as well as the inability to hot swap modules due to the design of the system, which requires the removal of the battery. The accessories themselves also received mixed reviews; Techradar felt that the Cam Plus and the Hi-Fi Plus were too expensive to justify their price and effects on the device's size, but that it was \\"satisfying to set autofocus by half shutter key\\" with the Cam Plus. However, The Next Web praised the design for \\"solving\\" the historic exclusion of user-replaceable batteries from metal phones, noting that \\"at least having the option for customizability is pretty awesome, not to mention replacing your battery after its capacity drops in a year or two. That's something no other metal smartphone can claim.\\" However, the metal case does not permit wireless charging, supported by earlier phones of the \\"G\\" series. The display was praised for its brightness, although The Next Web felt that its color temperature was too cool, producing a \\"distractingly blue-green hue\\" that was exacerbated by the prominent use of white in its user interface. The software of the G5 also received mixed reviews, with particular criticism directed to the removal of the app drawer from LG's default home screen. The always-on display on the G5 was praised for being more useful than that of the Galaxy S7 due to its support for displaying all notifications, and not just specific types. The Next Web lamented LG's removal of the Dual Window feature‚Äîalbeit believing the removal may have been due to the inclusion of native dual window functionality on Android Nougat, and that LG's customizations were \\"all around less useful than Samsung's\\".  Issues  LG smartphone bootloop issues that mainly plagued the G4 line also carried over to the G5, and the G4 lawsuit against LG was amended to include the G5, among other models, however the Canadian model is not part of this suit, leaving Canadian consumers on the hook for defective units.

The film stars Vijay Antony and Arundhati Nair, with Charuhasan, Y. G. Mahendra, Siddhartha Shankar and Kitty amongst others forming the secondary cast. Based on the novel Aaah! by Sujatha, the film revolves around a software engineer who gets into trouble after he starts hearing strange voices asking him to kill a woman named Jayalakshmi. Along with a Telugu dubbed version titled Bethaludu, the film released theatrically on 1 December 2016.  Plot  The film opens with Dinesh (Vijay Antony) and his boss (Y. G. Mahendra) visiting a psychiatrist. Here, Dinesh tells the doctor that he had been listening to a voice for a few days and it has been troubling him. Upon questioning the source of the voice, Dinesh tells that the voice sounds like that of God, if he were present really. The doctor asks Dinesh to come along with him for a personal treatment where Dinesh tells him that he had killed his friend Ravi. The doctor asks Dinesh to relax and hypnotises him in his sleep where he asks him various questions. It is revealed that a clever Dinesh had been recently married to a beautiful orphan Aishwarya (Arundhati Nair) who had contacted him through a matrimonial site. After their return from their Honeymoon trip, Dinesh starts hallucinating and listening to voices in his head. Also, his best friend Ravi who comes to help him gets killed in an car accident due to Dinesh. Dinesh catches the bus and goes to slum area in prostitute's place who is also named Jayalakshmi. Dinesh tries to kill the prostitute as voices had told him to do so. But, she runs away and people catch him.The Psychiatrist hypnotises Dinesh and sends him back to when he was ten years old. The voice in Dinesh's head keeps telling him to die and Dinesh sees miserable things on TV screens, computer screens and distorted bruised faces near the windows. After the treatment, the doctor tells Dinesh not to wander off alone and tells his boss that Dinesh has got disturbed memories of his past life. On returning home, a disturbed Dinesh aimlessly runs away from home and reaches Tanjavore in a train. While in the train he hears the same voice in his head directing him to that village and he names Sharma, Gopal, Natraj and Jayalakshmi. As soon as he gets down he hires an auto to find what happened to him and who is the voice. Upon investigating he finds out a picture of Sharma (Vijay Antony in his previous life) was a respected bachelor who adopted a boy Gopal and later married Jayalakshmi (Arundhati Nair). Things go smooth until Nataraj (Arav) enters the school. Jaylakshmi and Nataraj get close and have an illegal baby who takes the name of Sharma as his father. Though the talks go through the village, Sharma still loves and cares for the baby. One day when Nataraj passes through Sharma's house, an angry Sharma tries to rush out and confront Nataraj. In this chaos, the baby falls down and dies. Jayalakshmi runs away after this incident. Two weeks later, both Sharma and Gopal are found dead on the banks of a river and Jayalakshmi, Nataraj are absconding. The case gets closed as they are not tracked down. Unknown to everyone is that, Jayalakshmi returns and meets Sharma asking for forgiveness, which he readily does. Jayalakshmi feeds him food which is poisoned and later Nataraj and Jayalakshmi kill him and Gopal for killing their baby. Then, they abandon their bodies near a river bank and run away. A disturbed Dinesh wakes up to find himself in the mental asylum where he is being treated. Aishwarya comes to him with a tiffin box to feed him. Dinesh who has Sharma's soul inside him charges upon Aishwarya who looks like Jayalakshmi because he and Gopal were killed the same way. He is sedated and left inside his room for a few days where Sharma refuses to accept leave Dinesh's body. In the meanwhile Aishwarya goes missing leaving behind a letter after she gets a call from Thomas. It is revealed that Aishwarya had married Dinesh, just to test a drug on him. But guilt drives her to become a good husband-loving woman and she refuses to do any harm to him. and that the drug had caused him to remember his past. Thomas calls up Dinesh and asks him to bring back the evidences that were stolen from his guest house.

It generally arises in the conversion of imperative programs into purely functional ones. So, for instance, consider this JavaScript program, written in a non-store-passing- style: var lastWasA = false // a treebin represents a binary tree of strings. // a treebin is either // - a string, or // - {l : , r: } // does an in-order traversal of this tree's // leaves contain an 'a' followed by a 'b'? function aThenB(treebin) { if (typeof(treebin) = \\"string\\") { if (treebin = \\"a\\") { lastWasA = true; return false; } else if (treebin = \\"b\\") { if (lastWasA) { return true; } else { lastWasA = false; return false; } } else { lastWasA = false; return false; } } else { // not a string, must be an internal node: return ((aThenB(treebin.l))(aThenB(treebin.r))); } } This contains a reference to a global variable. In store-passing style, the value of the global variable (or variables) is passed along to each call, and also returned from each call and threaded through the next call. The code might look like this: Note that each call takes an extra argument, and two values are now returned; the ordinary return value, and a new value representing the state of the formerly mutable variable. Store-passing style can be quite painful to write, but can help to eliminate race conditions by isolating state within function calls, and can potentially make code more parallelizable.

Early life  Hargreaves was born in Yorkshire[dubious]https://jubb.one- name.net/getperson.php?personID=I1559&tree;=JUBBproven to James Arthur Hargreaves, and was the eldest of four children. He was educated at Mill Hill School and then studied medicine at University College London, where he was involved in the students' dramatic society. Hargreaves then attended University College Hospital Medical School, where he had the opportunity to become house physician and house surgeon. Hargreaves was unable to take up this appointment because the death of his father[dubious]https://jubb.one- name.net/getperson.php?personID=I1559&tree;=JUBBproven required him to take paid work to support his younger siblings. Hargreaves was reluctant to spend time on unnecessary postgraduate training and examinations when he had already secured the first openings in his chosen specialism. Therefore, instead of pursuing Membership of the Royal College of Physicians, he began his career in psychiatry serving at Hill End Hospital in St Albans, whilst simultaneously working as a clinical assistant to Bernard Hart at University College Hospital. He later worked at Cassel Hospital, Penshurst, Kent. In 1933, Hargreaves married Eva Byrde. Together they had four daughters. In 1938, Ronald was appointed full physician at the Tavistock Clinic and Eva gained her diploma in anaesthetics.  War service  When World War II broke out, Hargreaves volunteered for the Royal Army Medical Corps to serve as a psychiatrist. Whilst waiting to be called up, he read up on Army history, regulations, structure and training. He paid particular attention to Fortescue's History of the British Army and a book on Army psychiatry written by the American psychiatrist Thomas Salmon at the end of the First World War, and used the expertise gleaned from these works to impress Army personnel who were sceptical about psychiatrists. Nevertheless, he was accepted in the specialism and was commissioned as a medical officer (MO) on 1 April 1940, as a Lieutenant in the RAMC (128236).https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34891/supplement/4159/data.pdf Hargreaves began his war-work in Northern Command as the Command Psychiatrist. The posting was a fortunate one, and may not have been entirely coincidental, as the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of Northern Command was Sir Ronald Adam, who was known to be particularly keen to find new, objective and empirical methods for selection and training: Hargreaves could hardly have found a more sympathetic commander, and it would be interesting to examine the interaction between the two and the relation this had on the evolution of new procedures within the command. In any case, Hargreaves and his Tavistock colleagues were themselves very interested in the Army's system of selection, and only a few months after joining up, Hargreaves was experimenting with the use of Raven's Progressive Matrices as a way of screening out unsuitable recruits. His work on psychological methods of selection and allocation helped to bring about the creation of the Directorate for the Selection of Personnel, a General Service Selection scheme (GSS), and War Office Selection Boards (WOSBs). As well as his work on selection, Hargreaves also participated in work on neuroses. His research into causes of psychoneuroses in soldiers demonstrated that men with no predisposition to psychological breakdown, based on family history and childhood behaviour, were still at risk. He argued that more attention should be paid to the circumstances of the breakdown, rather than purely focussing on background and patient history. He shaped the work conducted at Northfield Military Hospital by encouraging Harold Bridger to follow up on the group therapy work that Wilfred Bion and John Rickman had initiated, and by passing information on the Northfield experiments to Karl Menninger for the Journal of the Menninger Clinic. In due course, Hargreaves was promoted out of the Command, to take his ideas Army-wide, based at the War Office. In addition, he also liaised with the United States Army and the Canadian Army, whom he advised on the use of psychological staff, when visiting North America in 1943 as Consultant to the Army. In the course of his military career, Hargreaves was promoted from Lieutenant to Lieutenant-Colonel and, at the end of the war, his contribution to military psychiatry was recognised with the award of a military OBE, in the New Year's Honours of 1946.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37407/page/20/data.pdf  Post- War  After his release from the Army, Hargreaves worked for a time at the Tavistock Institute and then as a medical officer at Unilever. In 1948, he was invited by Brock Chisholm to become the first chief of the mental health section of the new World Health Organization (WHO), a Geneva-based agency of the United Nations, where he was an advocate of the concept of mental hygiene. Hargreaves worked at the WHO from 1948 to 1955, when he retired in order to take up an academic post at home. In 1955 he was appointed Nuffield Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Leeds, where he was also awarded an honorary MSc in 1957. At Leeds, Hargreaves worked with colleagues such as Max Hamilton, running trials on chlorpromazine. Hamilton and Hargreaves developed a number of scales to measure anxiety, including the HAMA. Hargreaves was elected MRCP in 1959 and FRCP in 1962. As well as working for the university, Hargreaves served on the Medical Research Council, the Royal Medico- Psychological Association, and the British Medical Association. He also collected flamenco records and had an expert knowledge of flamenco dancing. Hargreaves' wife Eva died at the beginning of 1962 and Ronald himself also died young, after an operation, on 18 December of the same year.

According to his New York Times notice of death, his assignments in the Kennedy years included service on a task force on foreign aid, handling White House African Affairs and then finally, handling White House Latin American Affairs which was to become his specialty which he would turn into an ambassadorship during the Johnson Administration. After his ambassadorship ended, Dungan was appointed to become the State of New Jersey's first Chancellor of Higher Education, serving from 1967 to 1977. In 1967 New Jersey was widely viewed by college admission officers as being one of the nation's weakest higher education systems. They also called it a \\"cuckoo state\\" for its poor record of keeping residents from going to school elsewhere. When his 10 years at this post ended in 1977, the New Jersey college system had grown from six to eight colleges and had a \\"vastly increased\\" student population. However, then President of Rutgers, Edward J. Bloustein, said of former Ambassador Dungan in 1975: \\"He's a nice guy, but he does not understand the nature of universities.\\" In 1977, Dungan became the Executive Director of the Inter-American Development Bank. Dungan was born in Pennsylvania and his lawyer father was involved in the politics of the Democratic Party according to his New York Times notice of death. During World War II he served in the U.S. Navy as a Flight Instructor and then attended Saint Joseph's University in the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania under the G.I. Bill. He married twice and had and four sons and three daughters with his first wife who died before him in 1987. In 1956, Dungan became a legislative aide to Democratic Party Massachusetts U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy. In 1960, he worked on JFK's campaign to become the 35th U.S. President.

The halt was a request stop. It appeared in Bradshaw's Guides from September 1916 to July 1920 and in the GCR timetable dated 5 May 1919 . A printer's proof ticket shows the halt as \\"Eastern Ent. to Imm Dock\\". Overview The electric railway was built primarily to carry workers between Grimsby and Immingham Dock which the Great Central Railway had built on a greenfield site in a sparsely populated area. The line was built by the Great Central and remained in railway ownership up to closure in 1961. It therefore appeared in railway timetables and it was possible to buy through tickets between any of the stops on the line and anywhere on the national railway network, though there never was any physical connection with any conventional track, nor with the tramways in Grimsby and Cleethorpes. In modern parlance the vehicles would be described as trams, but they were typically referred to locally and in publications such as Bradshaw as \\"cars\\" or \\"tramcars\\", with related things being called names such as \\"tramcar halt\\" and \\"tramcar bridge.\\" \\"Car\\" was always a more common short form than \\"tram.\\" Location and facilities Eastern Entrance to Immingham Dock tramcar station was situated exactly where its name implies, at the eastern boundary of dock land at Habrough Marsh Drain bridge three quarters of a mile from the terminus near the dock's lock gates. At this point road and rail merged, with the tracks changing to grooved tramway common throughout all road tramways. This spot was and remains the eastern boundary of dock property. In 2012 this was a continuously staffed entrance checkpoint with barriers to road vehicles and pedestrians. In the 1950s and 1960s the spot was completely unmarked, with not so much as a sign to indicate entering or leaving dock property. The halt was provided here from mid-1916 to July 1920, but its purpose is unclear. It may have been a version of the modern checkpoint or to serve works which ended with the war. The line was a tramway, no platforms ever existed at any of the stopping places; passengers were expected to board and alight from the roadway or trackside cinders according to the location. The \\"stations\\" were much more commonly referred to a s \\"halts\\" or \\"stopping places.\\" Passengers bought tickets on board from the conductor. The line's two termini - Corporation Bridge and Immingham Dock - were the only halts on the line to attempt anything along the lines of railway nameboards, both proclaimed themselves in very large letters to be a \\"TRAMWAY STATION.\\" The line from the station The line from the terminus eastwards to the dock property boundary was conventional double track running alongside the dock road, giving the appearance of a conventional railway, except for the absence of fencing between road and rail. At Habrough Marsh Drain bridge three quarters of a mile from the terminus near the dock's lock gates. road and rail merged, with the tracks changing to grooved tramway common throughout all road tramways. This spot was and remains the eastern boundary of dock property and was the site of Eastern Entrance to Immingham Dock tramcar halt. From this point road and tramtracks climbed southeastwards up one of the two \\"hills\\" on the whole line, i.e. the bridge over the conventional Grimsby District Light Railway line near Immingham East Junction. This bridge, which was in regular, heavy road use in 2013, was known locally as \\"tramcar bridge.\\" At the other side of the bridge was \\"Tramcar Halt\\", or, formally, Immingham Town. Services Unusually among British tramways services ran round the clock, particularly to provide for railway workers based at Immingham engine shed, whose duties often involved starting or finishing at unsocial hours. Traffic was highly peaked, with convoys of tramcars leaving and arriving to match shift changes at the dock. It was normal for several tramcars to rest at Dock station between peaks. In 1956 over a million passengers used the line and even with deliberate rundown a quarter of a million used it in its last twelve months up to closure in July 1961. Closure The line took some years to die, being cut back at the Grimsby end in 1956 then reduced to peak services only in 1959, when it disappeared from Bradshaw and through ticketing beyond the line was withdrawn. Formal closure of the line and Dock tramcar station came on Monday 3 July 1961, with the last tramcars running on Saturday 1 July 1961 when a convoy of six tramcars set off, nominally at 14:03. The last tramcar of this convoy and therefore the last through the site of the halt was Number 4. Aftermath The first track on the line to be removed was at Dock tramcar station, to give increased parking space. The process of demolition was piecemeal and even in 2013 many hints of the line remained, such as spun concrete masts near Tramcar Bridge. No trace of Eastern Entrance to Immingham Dock Halt remained.

The organization was founded in 2012 and is the flagship project of The Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center (CEC), a non-profit organization that supports entrepreneurs on their path to building high- growth, sustainable businesses that serve as platforms for economic development and civic leadership. Led by CEO Howard A. Tullman, 1871 has become a major hub of Chicago's technology and entrepreneurial ecosystem and hosts over 400 early-stage companies as well as nationally recognized accelerators, industry-specific incubators, and tech talent schools.  History  In the early 2000s, some of the major players in Chicago's economy were Chicago Ideas Week and TechNexus. Due to emerging competition in the space, in 2012 TechNexus decided to shift their target market audience to more well-developed and established companies such as the Illinois Technology Association, Emerge, and 200 more. This allowed for 1871 to open in Chicago's ecosystem to help foster new enterprises and support corporations that were already based in Chicago.  Community  1871 offers work space to over 200 companies. Their partnerships and sponsorships with UPS, Google For Entrepreneurs and Chase give the people working there broader exposure to the greater tech space. 1871 also offers free work space to students from Trinity Christian College, DePaul University, University of Illinois, Illinois Institute of Technology or DeVry University, University of Chicago, Northwestern and Loyola. 1871 also hosts networking events and workshops.  Funding controversy  As a non-profit incubator, 1871 takes money from the state to bring in capital for these tech startups. Critics including CEO of Novel Coworking, Bill Bennet, believe \\"we shouldn't use the state money that way,\\" stating that \\"it doesn't make sense to me why we should use taxpayer funds to subsidize one place.\\" One of the main arguments against the funding is that there are other non-state funded avenues for statups to find affordable working spaces, like WeWork. Tullman, CEO of 1871, argues the space provides resources other coworking spaces could not, like mentoring, workshops and events for the entrepreneurial community. The tax statements of 1871's parent company, Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center (CEC) are public. The Chicago Tribune estimates 27% of their 2013-14 earnings were reported on their tax statement as \\"salaries, compensation and benefits.\\"  Expansion  In April 2016, 1871 officially opened their 3.0 expansion, which enlarges the space by another 41,000 square feet. This expansion created more classrooms and office spaces for some of their largest companies such as Impact Engine, Accenture and Options Away. The expansion was funded entirely by themselves and the Chicago Entrepreneurial Center, with no government grant assistance The estimated encounters of 1,000 people they have on a daily basis has grown to 2,000 people with the 3.0 Expansion. Over 500 companies are now working out of 1871.  Further Reading and Viewing  This is 1871 by Chicago poet Nate Marshall, Created for the facility's grand opening, February 29, 2012.

It is situated on the Mellemarmen pier on the industrial section of the Port of Aarhus in Aarhus city center. The silos represent the transition from manual to mechanized labor during the second wave of industrialization in the early 20th century and is symptomatic of the relationship between agriculture, industry and transport in the city. The Five Sisters were the first reinforced concrete structure to be erected in Aarhus and at the time it was the only building apart from the cathedral to rise above the city.  History  In the 1800s grain was typically stored in bulk or in sacks in storehouses or merchant's attics in a process that was both labor intensive and physically demanding. The risk of the products rotting or catching fire combined with the rising amount of cargo arriving made it necessary to find a more modern solution. In the 1890s silos were increasingly used. The earliest were placed inside existing buildings but later on dedicated structures of reinforced concrete became the norm. In 1898 the farmer's cooperative Jysk Andelsfoderstofforretning (JAF) was established and headquartered in Aarhus for the purpose of managing and selling agricultural products. The company became one of the largest in the country, opening trade hubs throughout the realm. In 1927 the silo complex was erected in the south harbor with designs by the architect Hjalmar Kj√¶r. The new structure heralded a change in labor processes with physically demanding work being replaced by electrical engines and elevators. Initially the silos had capacity for 12000 cubic meter oilseed and 13800 cubic meter grain while the lifting systems could handle 120 metric tonnes per hour. Building the silos into one structure made it possible to aerate the grain by moving it from one silo to another with electrical cup elevators and later vacuums. The elevators was also used to load and unload cargo ships and at the same time unloading coal became mechanized with cranes. The system was the beginning of a greatly reduced labor force in the port. The productivity benefits quickly became apparent; ships increased in size proportionally to the amount of cargo that could be handled. The Five Sisters was the first but other complexes followed shortly; Aarhus Oliefabrik built a 20.000 cubic meter silo and in 1930 Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet completed another large silo complex. In 1969 JAF merged with a number of other companies to form Dansk Landbrugs Grovvareselskab (DLG) which still owned the silo complex in the 2010s. The Five Sisters were initially not received well due its size and industrial appearance. The cathedral had since the 1500s been the dominating feature of the skyline and the equally tall silos were by many considered an eyesore in comparison. However, some architects have also noted them as an inspiration for later industrial and functionalist architecture.  Architecture  The Five Sisters was designed by architect Hjalmar Kj√¶r and engineer J√∏rgen Christensen. It was the largest silo complex in the Nordic Countries when it was completed and it was a technologically advanced replacement for the former storehouses. The complex includes 5 silos and a storehouse in 2 stories constructed of white painted re-enforced concrete with smooth, homogeneous facades absent any decoration. The area chosen was swampy in a newly developed part of the harbor making it necessary to use a piled foundation with 1200 14 meter long poles. The warehouse sits on a floating raft foundation. The Five Sisters marks the beginning of industrial Functionalist architecture in Denmark but can be best described as Neoclassical in style due to its historicist references. The name of the complex references the division of the silos into 5 parts inspired by the front gabled canal houses seen in Amsterdam and other Dutch cities. It's a combination of a modern technological engineering solution with architectural references to the past and stands as a unique structure in the 1920s functionalist architecture.

Year round it is home to a population of around 10,000 people and in the summertime it spikes to over 100,000 people. In World War II the people that flocked to Martha's Vineyard were soldiers. With Camp Edwards being on Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard became used as a training ground for the soldiers. Martha's Vineyard was used by the Army, Navy and Air Force from 1941 through 1945 with training missions that ranged from landings on beaches, climbing cliffs and bombing practice.  Army  Stationed at Camp Edwards, the United States Army used Martha's Vineyard to train and practice beach landings and beach assaults. The U.S. Army took part in missions where they loaded up boats with the soldiers, supplies and ammunitions on the Cape, and would then sail across the channel, around the Vineyard and then land on the beaches. Once landed, the troops would have to safely exit the landing crafts and remove the supplies as well. While doing so, another group of troops was positioned in the woods and on the Gay Head Cliffs of Martha's Vineyard in order to simulate live gunfire and bombing rounds. The soldiers who landed on the beach would then have to move up and clear the woods and take control of the beach. These missions were created to simulate the planned landings on the beaches of Normandy during D-Day. If the troops were unable to complete these missions they would not be allowed to ship out and take part in the storming of the beaches in Normandy. Another practice mission that the U.S. Army did to prepare for storming the beaches was practicing climbing the Gay Head Cliffs. The United States Military had knowledge of the cliffs that Normandy had on some of their beaches, specifically Pointe Du Hoc. Again the soldiers would boat over from Camp Edwards and then land on the beach before the cliff. They then had to move up towards the cliffs while under simulated gunfire. The soldiers then had to successfully climb up the cliff. Once at the top they were tasked with taking out fake enemy outposts to seize control of the cliff and allow the rest of the troops onto the beach. This mission prepared the soldiers for capturing Pointe Du Hoc and has been credited with being what led the soldiers to so much success in the actual taking of Pointe Du Hoc. A small island off the southern coast of Martha's Vineyard known as ‚Äò Noman‚Äôs Land‚Äô also played a vital role in World War II training. Noman's Land was purchased by the United States military to use as a bombing target. The soldiers were sent to Martha's Vineyard and were told to go to specific locations on the island, primarily on the beaches. Once in position, the soldiers were tasked with setting up mortars and dialing the mortars on to No Man's Land. After the mortars were dialed in, the soldiers used Noman's Land as a practice target area to gain essential experience. These missions took place at all different times of the day and in all different weather conditions. This was so the soldiers would be prepared for any weather condition they would face when landing in Normandy.  Navy  For the Navy, their training in Martha's Vineyard consisted mostly of assisting the Army in their maneuvers. Martha's Vineyard has many beaches, some of which have very calm waters and other that are known for waves of up to five feet. With the varying water conditions, these beaches gave the Navy plenty of practice for driving the boats in rough and uncontrollable water conditions. This practice allowed for the captains of the boats to test their limits and be able to safely land their boats on the beaches. Once on shore, the naval units joined in with the Army and participated in the capture of the beaches. The Navy also took advantage of Nomans Land. They would practice launching mortars from their small launching boats as well as from their bigger gunboats, carriers and destroyers. This bombing practice continued for more than 40 years and has lasting effects until today. Although Noman's Land is considered a wildlife refuge now there are still live munitions littered on the island, some of which regularly wash up on shore at the beaches of Martha's Vineyard. = Collaboration with Air Force = One of the bigger missions the Navy took part in was submarine destruction. Together with the Air Force, the Navy partook in locating and destroying submarines that were found off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and Cape Cod. The Air Force was responsible for flying and trying to locate submarines through the air while the Navy tried locating them while sailing around the waters. Once located, the Naval ships had to track down and destroy or deter the submarines from the waters around Massachusetts.  Air Force  The Air Force mainly took advantage of Martha's Vineyard Airport. They used the airport for new pilot training and for aircraft carrier training. Aircraft carrier training meant that they put a marker on the runway to shorten the distance to be the length of the deck of an aircraft carrier. This teaches pilots how to gain the most speed in the shortest possible time to be able to pull up and take off from an aircraft carrier, which is a very important task. Once airborne these pilots would then take advantage of Nomans land the same way the Army and Navy did. They would fly around Martha's Vineyard and practice making bombing runs on Nomans land. Some of these practice bombs being powerful enough to leave a 3 foot wide by 3 foot deep crater on the island. These bombing runs, like all of the other training done on Martha's Vineyard was all for preparation to storm the beaches of Normandy.  Island assault  In one joint training mission with the Army, Navy and Air Force, they simulated a takeover of the island. In preparing to do so they acted as if the island was held by German troops and they needed to infiltrate the island and capture it. To make things as realistic as possible the beaches were covered with barbed wire, beach obstacles and demolitions were planted on the beaches and also further inland. The demolitions were set up to replicate naval gunfire support, artillery and land mines. Along with these obstacles the 75th Composite Infantry Training Battalion was sent to the island beforehand to act as the German troops and to try to defend the island. The 75th Training Battalion did not have many soldiers in their unit, so umpires and flags were also used to simulate Germans. To assault the island one Air Force company of parachute infantry from Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, was directed to parachute onto the island near the airport at E-hour or 6 am. Once on the ground their job was to take control of the airport and set up an operating base as they would in a real- life scenario. As this was going on the Army and Navy are directed to send troops to land by boat, clear the beaches and then move inward to help seize the airport.  British involvement  When stationed at Camp Edwards, the U.S. troops were trained by their superiors and also by a group of British soldiers. They British soldiers came from the Number 1 Commandos, Suffolk Regiment, the Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal Navy and the Royal Corps of Signals. These elite British soldiers trained the U.S. troops in hand-to-hand combat, military strategies and also ran through their training missions with them.  Bibliography  * Becker, Marshall O.

After leaving Emmerdale, Oates transferred to Coronation Street as the series producer, a move which was praised by ITV personnel. While in the position, the show's ratings and critical acclaim increased, although Oates' darker storylines received mixed critical response and led to the soap being reported to Ofcom for the inclusion of violent imagery during the pre-watershed time frame.

At a show press event, Oates explained that she wanted to introduce a \\"greater breadth of storylines\\" and use more of the soap's talented cast.

He commended her \\"groundbreaking and socially important stories\\", including Pat Phelan's villainous spree and the light-hearted humour between characters.

He described Oates as \\"an extraordinarily talented woman ‚Äì very intelligent, very capable and a very good storyteller\\".

From then on, Oates was to gain sole responsibility for the show. Oates relished in the chance to be involved in the production of the three shows. She commented, \\"I'm excited about meeting the teams and talent behind each show and can't wait to get stuck in and tell some unmissable stories.\\" Mark Linsey, the CCO of BBC Studios, called Oates a \\"dynamic, passionate and creative storyteller\\" and looked forward to her joining the studios.

She added that she had recently been researching the history of EastEnders in preparation for joining the soap.

As of 2015 Dial-A-Carol entered its 56th season, in which it garnered national attention from sources such as ABC News, and Jimmy Kimmel Live. USA Today College wrote that Dial-A-Carol shattered previous records by receiving over 10,000 calls in 2015 for one-week span. History Snyder Sanctum member Steve Price participates in Dial-a-Carol in 1962 (Daily Illini 11 December 1962) Dial-a-Carol is the longest running tradition in the university's housing department. Betty Gordon, a desk clerk at the time for Snyder Hall on campus, is commonly credited with conceiving of the Dial-a- Carol idea around 1960. She came up with the idea for students on the second floor of Snyder Hall to play holiday records over the phone. By 1962, students were already answering more than 4,000 calls. Soon, student carolers replaced records and now sing for callers from all 50 states and around the world. 2006 was the first year that Dial A Carol was featured on the BBCs Radio One show which resulted in hundreds of calls flooding the phone lines for days. Critical Reception An advertisement for Dial-a-Carol (Daily Illini, 12 December 1975) In December 2015, Jimmy Kimmel made a spoofed televised segment of Dial-a-Carol with \\"Hanu-kall-the singing Hanukkah Hotline\\".

He is credited with coining of the term \\"Futurology\\". Early life Flechtheim was born in Nikolaev (then Russian Empire, now Mykolaiv, Ukraine), into a Jewish family, the son of bookseller Herrmann Flechtheim (1880‚Äì1960) and his wife Olga, n√©e Farber (1884‚Äì1964). In 1910 the family moved back into the father's hometown of Westphalian M√ºnster, where his relatives had a grain trade business, and later to D√ºsseldorf. The art dealer Alfred Flechtheim was his uncle. His family being secular, Flechtheim did not receive religious upbringing. In later life (after Second World War in West Berlin) he became a member (as a non-denominational humanist) of the German Freethinkers Association (later Humanist Association of Germany). After graduating from the Hindenburg School (now Humboldt-Gymnasium D√ºsseldorf) in 1927, he became a member of KPD which he left after five years, following a trip to Moscow (his mother's native city) in 1931, and having began to detest the ideological narrowness of the movement. Flechtheim studied law and political science at the universities in Freiburg, Paris, Heidelberg, Berlin, and finally Cologne. From 1931 to 1933 he completed his legal clerkship at the Higher Regional Court of D√ºsseldorf. He was awarded his Doctorate in Law in 1934 for his work on Hegel's criminal theory, while studying in Cologne under Carl Schmitt. Emigration and Academic Career in United States After Nazi takeover of power in 1933, Flechtheim was dismissed from civil service as being Jewish and a member of Neu Beginnen. In 1935 he was jailed for a total of 22 days. He emigrated to Belgium and then to Switzerland, where he was awarded a scholarship to continue his studies at the Graduate Institute of International Studies (HEI) affiliated with the University of Geneva, where he graduated in 1939 (University of Cologne stripped him of his degree in 1938). In 1939 he established contacts with Institute for Social Research in Geneva, and then emigrated to the United States, having accepted the fellowship offered by Max Horkheimer, the director of the Institute, when it was relocated to Columbia University in New York City. There he met Erich Fromm, Herbert Marcuse, and also became acquainted with Isaac Asimov. In December 1942, he married Lili Therese Factor, the daughter of Emil Faktor, the former chief editor of the Berliner B√∂rsen-Courier, their daughter Marion Ruth was born on September 26, 1946. Until 1943 Flechtheim taught at the University of Atlanta. After many of his students were drafted into military service, he became an Assistant Professor at the Bates College. During the Second World War Flechtheim joined the US Army. In 1946 he returned to service in a rank of lieutenant colonel, joining for several months the Office of the US Chief of Counsel for War Crimes in Germany. From 1947 to 1951 he continued his academic career in the United States as a university lecturer. Return to Germany and Participation in Politics In 1947 University of Heidelberg awarded Flechtheim a doctorate for his work (published in 1948) on KPD in Weimar Republic. He applied for the reinstatement of his Law degree from Cologne University, which was also granted in 1947. From 1952 to 1959 Flechtheim was a full professor at the German University of Politics. After the integration of that institution into the Free University of Berlin in 1959, he became a professor of political science at the local Otto-Suhr-Institut, the position he held until his retirement in 1974. In political life, Flechtheim became a co-founder of the liberal-left Republican Club in West Berlin, remaining a member of Social Democratic Party of Germany for ten years until 1962, and becoming member of the Greens in 1981. He has published a variety of books, essays, and articles in newspapers (including Frankfurter Rundschau and Die Zeit). Flechtheim was a founding member and vice president of German chapter of the International Federation for Human Rights, a member of the PEN Club, the council of peace studies and the Board of Trustees of the German Society for Peace and Conflict Studies. Flechtheim was an active supporter of the International War Resisters. On August 9, 1985, in interview for Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung he commented on what he detested the most: \\"inhumanity\\" and the war of the people against each other. Following the German reunification Flechtheim was one of the few that argued in favour of \\"third way\\" of synthesis of both Western and Eastern position on a basis of \\"democratic socialism\\". Flechtheim died on the eve of his 89th birthday in his adopted hometown of Berlin, and was buried in Dahlem Cemetery plot 2, next to some of his political friends interred there. Futurology In 1943 Flechtheim coined the term \\"Futurology\\" as a systematic and critical treatment of problematic related to Future studies. In his 1945 publication Teaching the Future he called for the development of courses dealing with the future. In his 1969 essay Discussion on Future Research he explained that it \\"... was the attempt to discuss the evolution of man and his society in the hitherto forbidden future tense. I held that, by marshaling the ever growing resources of science and scholarship, we could do more than employ retrospective analysis and hypothetical predictions; we could try to establish the degree of credibility and probability of forecasts.\\" In 1970 he published his work Futurology: The battle for the future. In it he criticized both the future studies in the West, and the technocratic approach promoted in the socialist countries, instead promoting a model of the \\"liberation of the future.\\" Flechtheim's concept of futurology around that time was based on the process of social evolution that was emerging in Eastern and Western Europe, leading a \\"Third Road\\" beyond capitalist and communist systems and would mean a new democratic alternative to existing societies.

It closed in 1810 and the buildings have been demolished except for one wing which is still seen in an alley off Falkoner All√© (between No. 112 and No. 120). Falkonerg√•rden is commemorated in Frederiksberg Municipality's shield as well as in the names of several buildings and public spaces. History The bridge between Falkoner All√© and Jagtvej viewed from the east Im 1662, Cron Prince Christian went on a European journey which took him to Louis XIV's court where he was first introduced to falconry. Back in Denmark, he established Falkonerg√•rden as a facility for stabling of peregrine falcons in 1670. It was situated next to the Ladeg√•rd Canal at his mother queen downer Sophie Amalie's new summer retreat Prinsesseg√•rden in Holl√¶nderbyen (as Frederiksberg was then called) to the west of Copenhagen. The peregrine falcons were annually brought home from Iceland and Norway, which were then ruled from Denmark. The birds were used by the king for falconry but also as highly praised gifts for foreign rulers by the Danish kings on their journeys abroad. Falkonerg√•rden was in the beginning referred to as Jagt-Huset (\\"The Hunting House\\") and occasionally also used for stabling of the king's hunting dogs. The street Falkoner All√© is Halkonerg√•rden's former driveway and was former driveway and was gated at each end. A stone bridge was built across the Ladeg√•rd Canal from where a track ran north, providing royal hunting parties with a shortcut on their way to J√¶gersborg Dyrehave. It was expanded into a wider, tree-lined avenue used for hunting in 1750 and later developed into the busy thoroughfare Jagtvej. Falkoner All√© was opened to the public after H√∏marken (literally \\"Hayfield\\"), an area to the north belonging to Ladeg√•rden, originally a farm under Copenhagen Castle, was auctioned off. The Falkonerg√•rden closed in 1810 and the last falcons were gifted to the Portuguese court. The buildings were then used as a wax candle factory. It produced perfume and soap under the name Falkonerg√•rdens Fabrikker (\\"Falkonerg√•rden's Factories\\"( until the 1910s. The buildings were then torn down except for a single wing which is still seen in the alley between No. 112 and No. 120. Legacy The shield of Frederiksberg Municipality features three falcons in commemoration of Galkonerg√•rden and the role it has played in the municipality's history. One of two memorial fountains on Sankt Thomas Plads feature a falconer. Falkonerg√•rden is also commemorated in the toponyms Falkoner All√© and Falkoner Plads (Falconer Square). Falkonerg√•rdens Gymnasium was named after Falkonerg√•rden in 191 in spite of the fact that it unlike Frederiksberg Fymnasium, Frederiksberg's other public gymnasium, is located far from Galkonerg√•rden's historic location. Its former name was Dr. Priemes Vejs Gymnasium.

Afghanistan is 164th in the world and 36th among the less-developed countries that have received WTO membership. Receiving WTO membership is a long process; Afghanistan was admitted after 11 years of negotiations. Afghanistan is among the least developed countries in the WTO and there are some expectations that their accession might impact newly emerged industries in the country.  The Background of WTO  After World War II, the original intention was to create a third institution to handle the trade side of international economic cooperation, joining the two ‚ÄúBretton Woods‚Äù institutions: the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Over 50 countries participated in negotiations to create an International Trade Organization (ITO) as a specialized agency of the United Nations. However, these negotiations failed as the draft ITO Charter extended beyond world trade disciplines. Meanwhile, 15 countries had begun talks in December 1945 to reduce and bind customs tariffs. With the Second World War having only recently ended, they wanted to give an early boost to trade liberalization and begin to correct the legacy of protectionist measures which remained in place from the early 1930s. As a result of these negotiations, the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was born, with 23 founding members (officially ‚Äúcontracting parties‚Äù), in Geneva in 1947. For almost half a century (until 1994), the GATT‚Äôs basic legal principles remained much as they were in 1948, and several other meetings were held on further decreasing tariffs, among other relevant issues. For example, the Kennedy Round in the mid-sixties brought about a GATT Anti- DumpingIn economics, ‚Äúdumping‚Äù is a kind of predatory pricing, especially in the context of international trade. It occurs when manufacturers export a product to another country at a price either below the price charged in its home market or below its cost of production. The purpose of this act is sometimes to increase market share in a foreign market or to drive out competition. Agreement. The Tokyo Round during the seventies was the first major attempt to tackle trade barriers that do not take the form of tariffs and to improve the system. The eighth meeting, the Uruguay Round of 1986-94, was the last and most extensive. It led to the creation of the WTO and a new set of agreements. Essentially, the WTO is a mediator among member states facing trade problems with other member states. The GATT focuses on trade in goods, while the WTO deals with trade in services and intellectual property.  Chronology of Afghanistan‚Äôs membership in WTO  The WTO was established in 1994, during which time Afghanistan was involved in a civil war and did not have a strong central government capable of joining the organization. With the emergence of the Taliban, Afghanistan's Mujahedeen government was not recognized and its representatives to the UN were not accepted. Additionally, economic sanctions were placed on Afghanistan at that time. Due to these circumstances, Afghanistan was not eligible for WTO membership. However, after the new regime was established under the leadership of Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan officially asked for membership to the WTO on November 21, 2004. Following the official request from Afghanistan, WTO established a working party, consisting of 28 countries and led by the Netherlands, on December 13, 2004. These countries included China, Pakistan, Tajikistan, India, Japan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the European Union, among others; most had trade ties with Afghanistan. Afghanistan presented its Trade Policy Memorandum on March 31, 2009, and the questions and replies were sent on July 26, 2010. The working party held five meetings which took place on the following dates: 31 January 2011; 18 June 2012; 7 December 2012; 25 July 2013; and 11 November 2015. Eventually, the Working Party presented its finalized report to WTO on 13 November 2015. Afghanistan received membership after Afghan First Deputy Chief Executive Mohammad Khan signed the protocol at the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference in Nairobi, Kenya on December 17, 2015.  The policy of Afghanistan toward the WTO  Generally, Afghanistan‚Äôs goal to become a member rested in the belief that Afghanistan would develop economically and would benefit from trade-related freedoms and privileges. It was also believed that its trade- and transit-related problems would dissolve and it would be able to attract foreign investment. Afghanistan, in order to receive the membership in the WTO, brought about some internal reforms around trade, its economy, and investments. It signed 9 bilateral agreements related to goods and 7 others related to services. The main aim of the WTO is to open borders for trade and reduce tariffs. Accordingly, Afghanistan has put an average of a 13.5% tariff on products, 33.6% on agricultural products, and 10.3% on non-agricultural products. Afghanistan joined the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) upon accession into WTO. This agreement asks all participants to completely eliminate duties on IT products covered by the ITA. Afghanistan‚Äôs export tariffs will also be bound for 243 tariff lines. Of these, 29.6% are bound at 10%, 24.2% are bound at 2.5%. On services, Afghanistan has made specific commitments in 11 services sectors, including 104 subsectors.  Positive and Negative impacts of Afghanistan‚Äôs membership in WTO  = Advantages = Resolving Disputes: one of the aims behind establishing the WTO was to help member nations resolve their trade-related disputes. Equal Treatment: Joining the WTO gives Afghan exports access to all WTO member markets on a Most Favored Nation (MFN) basis. This means that Afghan exports will be eligible for the best treatment that the country provides to the goods of other WTO members. For example, if the European Union grants the United States a low tariff on its potatoes, then Afghan exports must be given the same low tariff on exports of Bamiyan potatoes to the European Union.  Free Trade  The WTO aims to increase free trade in the world and remove obstacles toward it. Therefore, Afghanistan not only has access to the markets of 146 countries, but its exports would not face high tariffs in other countries.  Transit Dispute Settlement  Afghanistan is landlocked country which has caused difficulties in the area of trade. Joining the WTO provides Afghanistan a forum to resolve its transit-related problems via this organization. WTO rules will not force Pakistan to revise the Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan Transit Trade Agreement to allow Afghanistan access to Indian markets. = Disadvantages =  Threat to Newly Emerged Industries  Governments in some countries that have recently started to become industrialized try to increase tariffs on importing goods in order for the domestic industries to survive in rivalry with foreign industries; however, Afghanistan, due to getting WTO membership, would not be able to increase tariffs on importing goods. Thus, newly emerged domestic industries could suffer in competition with foreign industries and could be defeated by imported goods. Some believe that this may lead to increased unemployment in the country.  Ending Subsidy  The WTO emphasizes eliminating agricultural and industrial subsidies, which could have a deep impact on Afghanistan‚Äôs agricultural and industrial exports. 228  Reduction in Revenue  Afghanistan will not be able to put high tariffs on imports.

The film tells the story of a lowly pi√±ata vendor from a small town in El Salvador and the struggles that befall him after an extortion letter is left on his doorstep. Malacrianza is the first fiction film from El Salvador since 1969 which has also had the first worldwide release. The film was released on October 4, 2014 at the AFI Silver Latin American Film Festival. Plot Don Cleo is a humble pi√±ata vendor from a small town in El Salvador who receives an extortion letter at his doorstep. The letter instructs him to deliver $500 in 72 hours or he will be killed. The amount seems near impossible for the seemingly destitute Don Cleo, as he navigates through his reality, neighborhood, relationships and the few aspirations he still has. Don Cleo exhausts every opportunity to raise the money, gathering as much as possible from friends and acquaintances. Yet, as much as he tries, Don Cleo finds himself in more trouble than when he started. With no other hope to survive, Don Cleo decides to face his fears and stands up to his transgressors. Production The film was shot on location in El Salvador. Many scenes from the film were shot in gangster-dominated areas, and reflect the violence that the director saw in his own life. The script was based on a collection of real stories collected by Arturo Men√©ndez.

The sound of a cassotto register is warmer, less sharp than that of a register with unenclosed reeds. Technology The cassotto enclosure works as a passive frequency filter, attenuating higher frequencies and reinforcing lower ones (Resonance). Instruments with cassotto have a sound quality distinctly different from instruments without. Usually only some reed blocks are placed in the cassotto enclosure, typically for low reed sets 16' and/or 8'. The remaining treble reed blocks are mounted straight. The firm √ñllerer built a diatonic instrument with cassotto without register switches and two 8' (M) reed sets. Making a cassotto for diatonic instruments is quite more difficult due to the different reed plate arrangement. For chromatic accordions, a cassotto does not perform equally in every tone. On piano keyboards, the reed plates for black keys are usually located closer to the filling than those for most white keys. On chromatic button keyboards, two reed sets are typically distributed across 3 or 2 reed blocks (the latter solution often requiring particularly slim reed plates). The cassotto effect tends to be stronger the further the reed plates are from the filling. Cassotto registers are only available on few (and usually higher quality) accordion models. Especially famous are the Beltuna, Pigini, Bugari and √ñllerer models. In traditional German accordion making, the cassotto barely plays a role. One can find only a few cassotto registers in German accordions, but they can be found in the Hohner Morino and Gola models, and the Harmona (Klingenthal) Cassotta, Supra & Supita models. There is a special construction in the Weltmeister Cassotta (374 + 414) also known as \\"Klingenthaler Spezialcassotto\\" or \\"F√ºllungscassotto\\". In those models the reed blocks are arranged in one plane like with ordinary accordions. The effect of cassotto eis produced by a small \\"Canopy\\"(\\"Vordach\\") under the treble hood forming the cassotto hollow. An advantage of this construction is that reed plates are better accessible for tuning than with a traditional cassotto construction. Sound The effect of a cassotto is various instruments less pronounced with various instruments. The impact is therefore also not commonly evaluated. An individual assessment is required for each instrument. Oftentimes the cassotto Sounds will be described as warm and chubby. Due to the filter effects, there are few strong, pronounced overtones. There is some interaction between the types of sound materials and the cassotto. Frequencies between 500 Hz and 1000 Hz will be strengthened in general, but not evenly. Some frequencies will stand out more than others, over 1000 Hz everything will be rather subdued. The sound effects of the cassottos can be described as: *The sound interference effect, corresponds to a spoken \\"o\\" or \\"a\\" *The muffled sounds, in contrast, correspond to an \\"o\\" or \\"a\\" with umlauts.

Formerly part of the site was a natural monument, established in 1954 and known as the Petrified Forest Natural Monument, covering about . This area has remnants of a forest preserved in stone, that had been growing on the site before the upthrust of the Andes some 150 million years ago. In December 2012, further land was added and the protected area was reclassified as a national park with a total area of . The site Until recently the site covered an area of . However the National Parks Administration acquired two adjacent areas and included them in the protected area, forming a unit of . The park is in the Patagonian steppe ecoregion where the climate is cool and dry in summer, and cold and fairly dry in winter, with less than precipitation and strong westerly winds. The fossilised trees were first discovered in 1925 and have been the subject of much research since. Many sections of trunk are preserved and lying on the surface of the ground, some being in diameter and others as long as , and fossilized cones from the trees have also been found. History Fossilised cones of Araucaria mirabilis About 150 million years ago, during the late Jurassic period, the area occupied by this national park had a stable climate with abundant moisture. Dense forests with giant trees grew here, among which were Araucaria mirabilis, an ancient relative of modern species of Araucaria, a kind of evergreen conifer. This changed at the start of the Cretaceous period, when volcanic eruptions, which coincided with the start of upthrusting of the Andes mountains, buried some of the Patagonian territory in ash and lava. Part of the forests covered by ash were subjected to the processes of petrification. This process requires the fallen tree to be in an oxygen-free environment which preserves the original plant structure and general appearance, but which periodically gets inundated by mineral-rich water, replacing the organic structure with silica and other minerals. The end result is petrified wood. Some of the fossilised trees were tall and in diameter. The site is of particular interest because it shows that the climate of this part of Patagonia was much wetter before the Andes intercepted the humid airflow from the west. Climate The climate of the park is characterized as being cold, arid, and windy with large temperature swings between day and night. Mean temperatures range from in summer to in winter. Temperatures can reach up to in summer while in winter, they can drop to . The park receives of rainfall per year, which is mostly concentrated in the summer months. Snowfall can occur during winter. Flora and fauna The vegetation in the park is mostly low spiny shrubs adapted for living in arid environments; these include Caesalpinia gilliesii, Berberis microphylla, Arthrophyllum rigidum, Chiliotrichum diffusum, Mulinum spinosum and Fragaria chiloensis. The flightless lesser rhea is known from the park and mammals present include the guanaco, the dwarf armadillo, the culpeo fox and the South American gray fox.

Aphonopelma behlei and A. vogelae, at one time considered separate species, are now considered to be synonyms. Description Aphonopelma marxi is generally dark brown to black in colour, very hairy, with some orange to red hairs on the abdomen. The mature male's carapace ranges from long, the mature female being larger, with a carapace from long. The total body length of a female, including the chelicerae, is around . A. marxi can be distinguished from other species of the genus living in the same places by its dark colour, overall hairy appearance, size and habitat. In males, the ratio of the length of the femur of the first leg to the length of the metatarsus of the same leg is greater than 1.69, whereas in similar species the ratio is smaller. In females, the ratio of the length of the femur of the first leg to the length of metatarsus of the third leg is greater than 1.76, being smaller in similar species. Taxonomy The species was first described by Eug√®ne Simon in 1891 as Eurypelma marxi. The original type specimen on which the species was described has been lost; in 1997, T. R. Prentice designated a neotype. Placement in the genus Aphonopelma was first made by Andrew M. Smith in 1995. Smith also recognized two species, A. behlei and A. vogelae, that in analyses performed by Hamilton et al. in 2016 were not distinguished from A. marxi on either morphological or molecular grounds, and so were treated as junior synonyms. Aphonopelma marxi belongs to the \\"Marxi species group\\" ‚Äì a group of mainly black species, often found in high-elevation habitats. Other species of the group include A. catalina, A. chiricahua, A. madera, A. peloncillo and A. vorhiesi. Distribution and habitat Aphonopelma marxi is widely distributed in areas of higher elevation in the \\"Four Corners\\" region of northern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, southwestern Colorado, and southeastern Utah. It is found in a variety of habitats, including mixed conifer forests and sagebrush steppe. The species is described as \\"very common\\" in these areas, but is difficult to find as it normally remains in its hidden burrow.

The loss of life made this disaster, in terms of loss of life from the sinking of a single vessel, the fourth-worst tragedy in the history of the Great Lakes. Characteristics The Phoenix was built in 1845 in Cleveland, Ohio or Buffalo, New York. It was built with the then-new technology of twin screw propellers instead of side-mounted paddlewheels. The ship was long, with a beam of , a depth of and a displacement of 302 tons. Career The Phoenix spent its career making trips between Buffalo and Chicago. The ship was owned by Pease and Allen of Cleveland. Final voyage The Phoenix departed Buffalo on 11 November 1847, for its last trip of the year. It was carrying around 275 passengers, mostly Dutch immigrants, and a crew of 25 commanded by Captain G. B. Sweet. The ship also carried a cargo of molasses, coffee, sugar, and hardware. While on Lake Erie Captain Sweet fell and injured his knee badly enough that he was forced to stay in bed for the rest of the journey. The first mate, H. Watts, took command. The Phoenix reached Manitowoc, Wisconsin just before midnight on 20 November. The ship took on cordwood for fuel and unloaded cargo while waiting for the weather to improve. The Phoenix departed Manitowoc at 1 am on 21 November. About two hours out of Manitowoc, the fireman tending the Phoenix's boilers noticed that the pumps were not working properly. He reported this to the ship's second engineer, but was ignored; he later reported that the water in the boilers was dangerously low, but was again ignored. The Phoenix aflame At 4 am, clouds of smoke started billowing from the ship's engine room. The ship's passengers were alerted, and the first mate organized the crew and passengers into a bucket brigade in an attempt to fight the fire. The fire soon grew out of control. First Mate Watts ordered the ship turned towards shore, but the fire overwhelmed the engine room and the ship drifted to a halt about five miles from shore and nine miles from Sheboygan. The Phoenix carried only two lifeboats, with a capacity of 20 people each. These were quickly launched: the first with Captain Sweet and 20 others, the second carrying 19. By the time the lifeboats reached the shore, those aboard were exhausted from rowing, and unable to return to try and rescue more people. Meanwhile, the Phoenix was being consumed by flames. The crew and passengers tore apart the cabin and threw the pieces overboard to use as floats. The water was freezing cold; most of those who managed to find wreckage to cling to succumbed to hypothermia. Those who remained on the ship tried to climb upward to rigging, but the rigging burned and collapsed, sending those on it into the fire below. In the nearby town of Sheboygan, a justice of the peace named Judge Morris woke and spotted the flames on the lake. He ran down to the harbor and woke the crew of the steamer Delaware, who began building up the steam needed to take their ship out to assist. At around the same time the captain of the schooner Liberty saw the flames, and he and his crew manned the ship's lifeboat and rowed for the Phoenix. By the time the Delaware arrived at around 7 am, the Phoenix had burned to the waterline. The Delaware found only three survivors: the ship's clerk and a passenger clinging to the rudder chains, and an engineer clinging to a door. The boat from the Liberty arrived soon after, followed by one of the Phoenix's lifeboats. The Delaware retrieved five bodies from the water, then took the hull of the Phoenix and the Liberty's lifeboat in tow. The Delaware towed the wreck to Sheboygan, where it was beached by the city's north pier. Aftermath The exact death toll from the Phoenix is not known. The owners of the ship claimed that no more than 190 died, but the ship's clerk estimated that the number of lives lost was at least 250. 43 people were saved; 40 in the lifeboats and three rescued by the Delaware.Gendisasters Partial listings of some of the victiums numbering 31 of whom 25 are identified by name The engine, boiler, and cargo were later salvaged from the hulk of the Phoenix. The Delaware would later come across the scene of another Great Lakes disaster. On 17 June 1850 when the G. P. Griffith burned with a loss of at least 241 of the roughly 300 people aboard, the Delaware arrived on the scene. Too late to rescue survivors, the Delaware could do no more than tow the burning wreck to shore, just as it did with the Phoenix. The Delaware itself sank on 3 November 1855 with the loss of 11 lives.

Daochos II, son of Agias, a politician from Pharsalus and supporter of Macedonia, was a hieromnemon at the delphic sanctuary from 336 to 332 B.C. He dedicated the ex voto as a sign of honour to his prominent family. The ex voto of Daochos at the Delphi Archaeological Museum Description A statue of Agias, son of Acnonius, and winner of the pankration in three Panhellenic Games. This statue occupies Position III of the Ex voto of Daochos. Height: 2 metres (6 feet 7 inches) The ex voto of Daochos was the sculpted ex voto of the tetrarch of Thessaly Daochos II to the god Apollo, which had been placed in the Treasury of the Thessalians to the northeast of the temple of Apollo in Delphi. The ex voto dates probably between 339 and 334 B.C., in the time when Daochos II was hieromnemon of Pharsalus in the Delphic Amphictyony. Other dates have, however, been proposed. Initially it was thought that the ex voto stood free. However, recent studies concluded that the monument was probably situated within the Treasury of the Thessalians, built around 361 B.C. by Agelaus.Jacquemin, A., Laroche, D., 2001, Le monument de Daochos ou le Tr√©sor des Thessaliens, BCH 125, 2001, pp.305-332 The ex voto had the form of a sculpted complex comprising nine figures: eight members of the family of Daochos and one of a god, possibly of Apollo. All figures were accompanied by inscriptions which facilitated their identification. Only the god's figure does not bear an inscription. The figures presented are those of Acnonius, Agias, Telemachus, Agelaus, Daochus I, Sisyphus I, Daochus II and Sisyphus II. The presence of Agias in this group led the scholars to attribute the entire complex to the workshop of Lysippus, as the latter had created a statue of the Thessalian leader in Pharsalus.Sj√∂qvist, E., 1996, Lysippus, Cincinnati =Position I= The statues were found fragmented during the Great Excavations, in 1894.

It was first established in 2015. ShanghaiPRIDE Film Festival is one of three unconnected LGBT film festivals in the city. Shanghai Queer Film Festival, launched in September 2017, is a volunteer-run, not-for- profit event, and aims to help facilitate and promote the work of filmmakers from Chinese and other Asian backgrounds. CINEMQ, launched in 2015, is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit collective, focused on queer short film from Asia and around the world. Other Chinese-language LGBT film festivals in the region, which also feature international LGBT films with Chinese subtitles, include Beijing Queer Film Festival, Hong Kong Lesbian & Gay Film Festival and Taiwan International Queer Film Festival. Background ShanghaiPRIDE Film Festival was established by filmmakers and people involved in the Shanghai arts scene, in conjunction with ShanghaiPRIDE, an LGBT group itself established to highlight a range of LGBT issues. ShanghaiPRIDE Film Festival was, in turn, established to create awareness and promote tolerance for the LGBT community through film. It was launched in 2015 to support new queer Chinese filmmaking talent. It also hosts workshops, Q & A Sessions and panel discussions with some of the leading figures in Chinese LGBT cinema. The festival takes place in June every year as part of ShanghaiPRIDE. Screenings are free and open to all. History ShanghaiPRIDE festival, launched in 2008, has always featured film screenings. PRIDE director Raymond Phang states: ‚Äúscreenings were very secretive ‚Äì very small-scale, with 20 or 30 people at most. You wouldn‚Äôt know the venue until a few hours before.‚Äù According to Variety, foreign consulates provided financial support for the screening fees of certain titles, venues, and often their own cultural section‚Äôs libraries of LGBT-related titles from 2010. A formal, fully fledged film festival was founded in 2015 by Matthew Baren and Alvin Li. Baren is a Shanghai-based filmmaker, while Li is an LGBT volunteer who lives in the US and China. ShanghaiPRIDE Film Festival first opened from June 12‚Äì21, 2015. The first festival was themed, 'Queer Family,' and featured film screenings, including live Q & A sessions and workshops. It also featured short films from around the world, and invited submissions from Chinese LGBT filmmakers. The festival opened with the Mainland Chinese premiere of Lilting (2014) and opening night was attended by the film's star, actress Cheng Pei Pei. The 2016 festival was held June 17‚Äì26, with the theme 'gender,' with a program of films on gender minorities. The 10 day event featured 40 films, a short film competition, workshops and panel discussions. The festival opened with the Mainland Chinese premiere of Tangerine (2015) Other highlights included a specially recorded message from Sir Ian McKellen, and a 20th anniversary screening of East Palace West Palace, attended by director Zhang Yuan. The festival includes a short film competition, for films which 'tell stories of Chinese LGBTQ experience.' According to festival director and programmer Matthew Baren, \\"Film is very important to the LGBT movement in China. So much of [LGBTQ cinema] is dominated by the West. We wanted to support Chinese stories, Chinese faces.\\" Five awards are judged by film industry professionals. Past judges have included filmmakers Hong Khaou, Quentin Lee and Kit Hung, as well as musicians Erica Lee and MIIIA. The top prize includes being presented at the internationally well-established Iris Prize and a chance for film producers to win funding for their forthcoming production. Baren departed the festival in 2016, and was succeeded by Wing Shen for its 2017 edition. The 2017 festival will be a much smaller event, taking place on two non-consecutive days. It will be held on 11 and 18 June 2017. In 2019, the festival was directed by Raymond Phang, a Malaysian who is also the overall director of ShanghaiPRIDE festival.

From 1902 to 1905, he served as the Vice Consul in Tangier and later as Consul General in Tangier from 1905 to 1906. During his tenure as a diplomat in Morocco he participated as a negotiator in the Perdicaris affair. On July 20, 1908, he was appointed to serve as the first Consul General to the Ethiopian Empire while the Senate was in recess. The Senate recommissioned him on December 9, 1908, and he presented his credentials on July 6, 1909, officially opening relations between the United States and Ethiopia. However, due to health problems he only served for one year. The vice consul general in Ethiopia would maintain relations until his death three years later. The British took control of relations until the consulate was formally closed as there wasn't a high enough level of commerce to justify another commercial treaty with Ethiopia.

The complex is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein family. The transporter contains three protein components: * ZnuA, a periplasmic zinc- binding protein. * ZnuB, an integral membrane protein that transports zinc across the cytoplasmic membrane. * ZnuC, an ATPase responsible for coupling ion transport to ATP hydrolysis. The expression of ZnuABC is regulated by the zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein and is induced by conditions of zinc starvation. Because zinc is often a limiting factor in bacterial infections, some pathogenic bacteria are heavily dependent on ZnuABC to scavenge zinc from the environment in an animal host. The periplasmic protein ZnuA interacts with ZinT, another component of the regulon controlled by Zur, which is also involved in periplasmic zinc homeostasis.

Founded in 2013, Master & Dynamic designs and manufactures headphones, earphones, speakers, and audio accessories. Master & Dynamic is geared towards the creative community. The company has partnerships and collaborations with Kevin Durant's Thirty Five Ventures, camera-maker Leica, and Louis Vuitton. The company sponsors the arts program at Harlem Village Academies, a public charter school network in Harlem. History Master & Dynamic was founded by Jonathan Levine and Vicki Gross. Levine had previously launched two consumer product companies, and when his teenage son was unable to find headphones that appealed to him, Levine realized there was an opportunity in the market. He partnered with Gross to establish Master & Dynamic in 2013. He subsequently came across a pair of 1940s headphones at a Washington, DC museum, and because they had been built with durable materials such as leather and metal, they remained intact. Levine then hired Swedish industrial designer M√•rten Wallby and together they designed Master & Dynamic's first headphones and earphones. They were constructed with long lasting materials such as stainless steel, heavy grain leather, forged and machined anodized aluminum and woven copper cable. The Director of Product Design is Thomas Wilson. Master & Dynamic launched in May 2014 with an initial product line composed of two headphone and two earphone models. The initial reviews from media outlets including CNET and Wired focused on the quality of the design, sound, and build of the earphones and headphones. In 2014, Master & Dynamic announced that they had teamed with NeueHouse, a multi-disciplinary coworking collective, to develop a noise- isolating microphone for use in open offices and other environments. Working directly with the collective's membership, Master & Dynamic released the final product, a boom mic, in January 2015. They have partnered with Zero Halliburton on an audio toolkit, and the New York-based fashion house Proenza Schouler on a collection of 3 limited-edition headphones. Two hundred of each design were produced.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-12/the- headset-redeemed-master-dynamic-s-boom-mic In November 2015 the company added vegan alcantara headphones. Master & Dynamic has provided financial support for the Harlem Village Academies arts and music education programs since 2013. Contributions from Master & Dynamic have established HVA High's foundational art program, which offers 2D and 3D art classes within the high school. Master & Dynamic headphones were provided to allow students to work independently and in small groups in their music classes. The company also supports The Center for Arts Education, a non-profit arts organization for children in New York City. In 2017, Master & Dynamic and the camera-maker Leica began collaborating, producing the \\"Master & Dynamic for 0.95\\" collection of headphones with Leica-themed designs. In January 2019 Louis Vuitton partnered with Master & Dynamic to release the wireless Louis Vuitton Horizon Earphones, which feature the fashion brand's monogram. In May 2019, Thirty Five Ventures, the company owned by basketball player Kevin Durant and sports business executive Rich Kleiman, announced it had become an equity partner in Master & Dynamic. Products =Headphones and earphones= The ME05 earphones, released in November 2015, are constructed with solid brass and titanium- coated custom drivers. The first run sold out within three days and a second run sold out after positive reviews were published. The MW60, Master & Dynamic's first wireless headphones, were released in December 2015. Wired wrote, \\"there is no better wireless headphone.\\" The MW50, a wireless version of Master & Dynamic's original MH30 on-ear headphones, was released in November 2016. In May 2018, Master & Dynamic added the MW50+, a two-in-one over-ear and on-ear set of headphones. In September 2018, Master & Dynamic released its MW07 True Wireless Earphones. The earphones received a 2019 Red Dot Design Award and a CES 2019 Innovation Award. In 2019, Master & Dynamic added the MW07 Plus, featuring extended battery life, and the MW07 Go, with water resistance. In May 2019, Master & Dynamic released its MW65 wireless headphones, featuring noise-cancellation technology. The MW65 received a CES 2020 Innovation Award.

Members of the MPE family are found in a large variety of Gram- negative and Gram-positive bacteria and facilitate the translocation of lipid- linked murein (aka peptidoglycan) precursors. A representative list of proteins belonging to the MPE family can be found in the Transporter Classification Database.  Structure  Members of the MPE family consist of 370-420 amino acyl residues with 9 (RodA; TC# 2.A.103.1.2) or 10 (FtsW; TC# 2.A.103.1.1) putative transmembrane Œ±-helical spanners. Experimental evidence for a 10 TMS model has been reported for FtsW of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The S. pneumoniae protein has both its N- and C-termini in the cytoplasm, a large (~ 60 residue) cytoplasmic domain between TMSs 4 and 5, and a large (~ 80 residue) extracytoplasmic loop between TMSs 7 and 8. Function Bacterial cell growth necessitates synthesis of peptidoglycan. Assembly of peptidoglycan is a multistep process starting in the cytoplasm and ending in the exterior cell surface. The intracellular part of the pathway results in the production of the membrane-anchored cell wall precursor, Lipid II. After synthesis, this lipid intermediate is translocated across the cell membrane. The translocation (flipping) step of Lipid II requires a specific protein (flippase). Mohammadi et al. (2011) showed that the integral membrane protein FtsW (TC# 2.A.103.1.1,4-7), an essential protein for cell division, is a transporter of the lipid-linked peptidoglycan precursors across the cytoplasmic membrane. Using E. coli membrane vesicles, they found that transport of Lipid II requires the presence of FtsW, and purified FtsW induced the transbilayer movement of Lipid II in model membranes. The best-characterized members of the family are the FtsW cell division protein, the RodA rod shape determining protein (both of E. coli; TC# 2.A.103.1.2) and the SpoVE protein of B. subtilis (TC# 2.A.103.1.3). They have been shown to function in the translocation (export) of lipid-linked murein precursors such as NAG-NAM- pentapeptide pyrophosphoryl undecaprenol (lipid II). They interact with murein synthases as well as two transpeptidases (PBP2 and PBP3). In Gram-negative bacteria the ftsW gene is physically linked to murG (TC# 9.B.146), which is responsible for the final cytoplasmic step in the synthesis of lipid II before it is flipped to the periplasmic side of the membrane. They may therefore be part of a tunneling device directing the flow of murein precursors to the membrane enzymes that insert the precursors into the preexisting murein sacculus. =Transport reaction= The following reaction is catalyzed by the proteins of the MPE family.

The film stars Liao Fan, Jiang Wenli, Chin Shih-chieh, Song Jia and Song Yang. Plot Grandmaster Chen, the last surviving practitioner of the Wing Chun style of martial arts, arrives in Tianjin with the desire to open a martial-arts school. Upon defeating all of Grandmaster Zheng's disciples, Chen receives an offer from Zheng to establish a school jointly, which Chen declines. Zheng then threatens to expel Chen from the city. He gives Chen another offer: if Chen can train a disciple to defeat the eight schools of Tianjin, then Chen will be allowed to open his school. Zheng reveals that he plans to defeat the disciple after the eight schools are defeated, thus enhancing his own reputation. Meanwhile, Chen decides that he should marry a local woman, and proposes to a waitress named Zhao. One day, Chen and Zhao are beset by thugs, whom Chen easily defeats. This catches the attention of Geng a local rickshaw-puller, who visits Chen's residence. Chen approves of Geng's courageous personality and decides to take Geng as his disciple. Geng turns out to be a prodigy in Wing Chun and helps Chen to attain some of the needed victories well ahead of schedule. However, this draws the ire of an organized crime leader named Madame Zou, who attacks Chen, forcing the latter to distance himself from Geng. Later, Zhao realizes that Chen intends to betray Geng, leading Chen to expel her from the house. Zheng is visited by a former student, Lin, who is now an officer in the military. Lin requests that Zheng fight with him on camera, so he can send the film to the Viceroy. Zheng thoroughly defeats Lin in sparring, but Lin proceeds to ambush Zheng and seriously injure him, revealing himself to have been secretly in Madame Zou's employ. Zheng decides to leave Tianjin and settle in Brazil. Chen, realizing that he and Geng are in danger owing to Madame Zou, offers to take Geng and leave Tianjin, but Madame Zou prohibits them, because she does not want to be perceived by the public as a bully. Instead, she allows Chen to open a school for a year, after which he must leave Tianjin, and sends thugs to assassinate Geng. When that fails, she sends Lin to attack Geng. Geng is stabbed and dumped in the countryside of Tianjin, but instead of seeking medical aid, he chooses to walk back into Tianjin, whereupon he dies of blood loss. On the day when Chen is to open his school, he visits a tea-girl who tells him about what happened to Geng, and shows him one of Geng's books which has Geng's bloodstains inside the pages. Chen is visibly moved, and during the opening ceremony, attacks Lin, who fights back with the assistance of Madame Zou's thugs. Chen manages to kill Lin before the thugs subdue him. He then offers to share his secrets and to train students for Madame Zou in return for not being executed. While getting ready for a demonstration, Chen flees from captivity, and the entire martial arts community of Tianjin, all nineteen schools, chase after him. Upon being trapped in a narrow alleyway, Chen defeats each of the nineteen masters in a duel, but decides to spare Madame Zou's life. Chen then boards a train for Guangdong, thinking that Zhao is already on her way there. However, Zhao had not yet left Tianjin, and is captured by Madame Zou. The latter spares Zhao and sends spies to follow her, with the aim of delivering a message to Chen warning him to keep silent about what happened.

HJalmar Kj√¶r was the son of soap manufacturer Hans Kj√¶r and Kathrine Rasmussen. He attended a technical college before he was admitted to the preparatory course of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1894 and graduated as an architect in May 1896. Kj√¶r established a design office in Odense in 1898 and lived there for most of his life. His works in Odense spans residential and public buildings, bridges, roads and streets. Outside Odense he designed buildings in the cities of Copenhagen and Aarhus and restored several manors on Fuenen and Lolland. Among them are two very different Catholic Apostolic Churches in Copenhagen and Aarhus respectively, the St. Nicholas' Church in Aarhus and the church on Krigersvej in √òsterbro, Copenhagen. In Aarhus he also built the Five Sisters silo complex which was the largest in the Nordic countries at the time and the first structure in the city made of reinforced concrete. The building is notable for the five front gabled silos inspired by canal houses in Amsterdam and other Dutch cities combined with a modern and high-tech engineering solution to industrial needs. The silos have smooth, white facades absent any decoration in the functionalist style prevalent at the time and is today an Industrial Heritage Site. During the National Exhibition of 1909 in Aarhus he also designed Skansepal√¶et.

Background Heleringer (pronounced \\"hell ringer\\") is the oldest of six children of Robert C. Heleringer (1926‚Äì2005) and the former Mary Lou O'Donnell (1927‚Äì2004). Robert C. Heleringer, also known as Bob Heleringer, and his father, A. M. Heleringer (1898‚Äì1964), founded and operated for a half century Heleringer's Furniture Company in Louisville. Heleringer attended Our Lady of Lourdes School in Louisville, where he was taught by the Roman Catholic Ursuline Nuns of the Immaculate Conception and acquired a keen interest in U.S. history. He graduated as an eighth grader in 1965 and went to Trinity High School in 1969. He worked in the family furniture store during high school. The Heleringers had first lived on the South End of Louisville near Churchill Downs but later moved to a larger residence at St. Matthews, a suburb on the East End of Louisville. Heleringer was born in the week between the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness races. His maternal grandfather from whom he acquired his middle name, Leo O'Donnell (1896‚Äì1993), was a Thoroughbred trainer who co-founded the Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Association. Heleringer's mother and his siblings raced horses in the 1990s and early 2000s and acquired a winner in Put Me In. Heleringer worked as a mutuel clerk and racing official at various locations while he attended the Roman Catholic Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, from which he graduated in 1973. He then enrolled at the University of Louisville School of Law, at which he was the editor of the student newspaper. He graduated in 1976 and immediately launched his law practice. In 2000, he was named an \\"Honored Alumnus\\" by his law school. Political life In his twenties, Heleringer campaigned for fellow Republicans Gene Snyder, a U.S. representative for Kentucky's 4th congressional district, and Jon Ackerson, a state senator and later state representative for Jefferson County who successfully recommended Heleringer for the position as \\"administrative assistant\\" to the then eight-member Republican Senate Caucus, long before the Republicans obtained the majority in the state Senate in 2000. In the 1979 state election, Heleringer in a vigorous campaign unseated the Democratic Representative Bob Benson. Heleringer ran as a staunch opponent of abortion, which had been legalized in all states six years earlier by the United States Supreme Court. Unlike most opponents of abortion, Heleringer also opposed capital punishment: \\"I think it's wrong to take a life regardless of what that person has done.\\" He compared lethal injections to \\"sanitizing\\" legal executions. As a legislator, Heleringer was the vice-chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, from which berth he became known for criticism of excessive state spending on contracts. He has worked for organizations which represent the disabled and the horse industry. In 1985, Representative Heleringer was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for mayor of Louisville; he lost to the Democrat Jerry Abramson, who was subsequently the first Louisville Metro Mayor. In 2006, Heleringer was the unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor on an intra-party ticket headed by Steve Nunn of Barren County, the son of former Governor Louie B. Nunn. Steve Nunn, who had entered the legislature at the same time as Heleringer, lost the gubernatorial nomination to U.S. Representative Ernie Fletcher, who then became the first Republican to win the Kentucky governorship since Louie B. Nunn. Steve Nunn is now serving a life sentence for the murder of a former fianc√©e. In 2008, Heleringer ran unsuccessfully for the Kentucky State Senate. In 2015, Heleringer finished second among twenty-one candidates for the seat on the state 30th District Court for Jefferson County vacated by the retiring Judge Michele Stengel. With 19,432 votes (11.6 percent), Heleringer lost to Democrat Todd Hollenbach of Louisville, the former two-term state treasurer who led the field with 32,340 (19.2 percent). Kentucky has no runoff elections in such situations; so plurality prevails. Personal life When he was campaigning in 1979 for the legislature in the same election in which Louie B. Nunn unsuccessfully sought to return to the governorship, Heleringer met Cynthia \\"Cindy\\" Carby, a young woman whom he signed up to vote. Despite some reservation from her father, the couple married the next year and had four children in eight years: Sarah (1981), Ann (1982), Tommy (1984), and Philip (1989). Heleringer told his bride that while they might not become wealthy, life would never be dull. With their children all grown, the Heleringers refurbished his boyhood home in St. Matthews, where they reside. They also spend part of the year in Vermont. Heleringer is an instructor at the Equine Industry Studies program at the University of Louisville. As there was no textbook for the original course, Heleringer began to prepare a book. After thirteen years, he completed Equine Regulatory Law, which also encompasses the history of the horse racing industry. He also teaches equine studies at the women's school, Midway University in Midway, Kentucky. In December 2015, Heleringer resigned as the executive director of the Kentucky Equine Education Project, an advocacy group established in 2004. KEEP, as it is known, announced a future statewide focus, rather than concentration on Louisville, Lexington, and the capital city of Frankfort and the dropping of its former lobbying activities on behalf of casino gambling. Heleringer writes occasional columns, mostly political, for the Louisville Courier-Journal.

Early life and education  Born November 24, 1904 in New Utrecht, New York. Her father was John G. Tjaden, a structural engineer. Tjaden graduated from Jamaica High School at the age of 15. Rejected from Columbia University‚Äôs architectural program because she was too young, Tjaden waited a year to meet the age requirements for Cornell University‚Äôs School of Architecture. As a land grant institution, Cornell was required to admit women. Tjaden completed the five-year course in four years and graduated from Cornell University in 1925 with a bachelor's degree in architecture at the age of 19. She was the only woman architect in her graduating class.  Career  In 1929, at the age of 24, Tjaden became the youngest registered architect in New York State. In 1938, she became the first woman admitted to the Brooklyn Chapter of the American Institute of Architects and for many years was the only female member of the organization.Obituary of Olive Tjaden Van Sickle. Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, FL) (Published as Sun-Sentinel) - March 18, 1997Edition: FINALSection: LOCALPage: 7B She specialized in residential architecture, and was chosen to design a home for the 1939 World's Fair. She designed more than two thousand buildings in her career. On the recommendation of a Cornell dean, Tjaden was hired by a Mineola, NY architecture firm and began designing ‚Äúdistinctive homes for people of moderate means.‚Äù From the 1920s to 1940s, Tjaden supervised the design of more than 400 homes in the Garden City area of Long Island, New York. Tjaden's designs included flourishes such as formal breakfast rooms and sweeping staircases. One of her most admired elements was her use of stained glass windows, particularly a colorful peacock door designed by her and constructed in England. The homes were meant to sell for around $12,000. According to Nassau County Historical Society member Millicent Vollono ‚ÄúShe would sometimes do a whole block of homes using five or six kinds of styles. When you go through those neighborhoods now, the homes look different, but they all fit together.‚Äù A Tudor mansion Tjaden designed in Woodmere, NY for a distiller was featured in a 1935 edition of ‚ÄúGood Housekeeping‚Äù magazine. Tjaden's former home on 11th Street in Garden City is marked with a weather vane representing her career- a young woman holding a caliper and sitting astride a T-square. Tjaden often hosted social events for women at her home and the house served as an advertisement for her work. In 1943, she moved to Florida to capitalize on the building boom of the era. Once in Florida she ceased working on individual homes, but wrote a column for an architectural journal and designed garden apartments. She also served as program director and member of the board for the Museum of Fine Arts in Fort Lauderdale. Personal life and legacy Olive Tjaden Hall Tjaden married Carl G. Johnson of Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1945. At the time, Tjaden was reported to live in Garden City, New York. Tjaden died at the age of 92 and left most of her $12 million estate to Cornell. A building housing part of Cornell‚Äôs College of Architecture, Art and Planning was named in her honor in 1981.

In 1834 she became a servant in Benjamin Franklin Hardin's home. Hardin lived on a plantation outside of Liberty. Paine participated in the Runaway Scrape; and during 1836 and 1837, served Mexican officers captured at the Battle of San Jacinto and housed at William Hardin's plantation.

Ackerson represented District 30 in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1976 to 1977 and again from 1984 to 1997. In the interim, he was from 1978 to 1983 the District 34 member of the Kentucky State Senate, also based in Jefferson County. Background Ackerson is one of three children of Louis E. Ackerson (died March 1984) and the former Sara M. Romans. His brother, Robert Louis \\"Bob\\" Ackerson (1934-2008), was also a Louisville lawyer and an Episcopalina. These Ackersons are interred at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville. His sister, Mary Beth Ackerson (born 1936), worked in the health services industry. Ackerson graduated from the Methodist- affiliated University of Indianapolis in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the University of Louisville School of Law in Louisville. He practices law in the firm of Ackerson & Ackerson. Political life In 1978, Ackerson persuaded his seven Senate Republican colleagues to hire the young Louisville attorney Bob Heleringer as their administrative assistant. Heleringer, the son of a Louisville furniture dealer and the grandson of a horse trainer, subsequently served in the Kentucky House from suburban Louisville from 1980 to 1991. Ackerson himself left the Senate after the Democratic majority in 1982 moved his district to rural southeastern Kentucky, including Clinton and McCreary counties near the Tennessee state line. Ackerson objected to the redistricting on grounds that 96,000 suburban constituents would no longer have local representation. He instead returned to the Kentucky House. From 1999 to 2002, Ackerson served on the Jeffersontown City Council in Jefferson County but relinquished the position to run unsuccessfully in the nonpartisan election for mayor held on November 5, 2002. In 2008, Ackerson came out of political retirement to win the District 18 seat on the Louisville Metro Council. He defeated Ellen L. Reitmeyer, a figure in the local Republican Party, for the right to succeed the retiring council member Julie Raque Adams. Reitmeyer had been a legislative aide to Adams. The Democratic candidate for the seat, Mike Perkins, cited a lack of funding and withdrew to leave Ackerson without opposition. From 2009 to 2012, he served alongside his son, attorney Brent Thomas Ackerson, a Democrat, who represents District 26 on the Metro Council. Brent and his brother, Marc Alan Ackerson, are sons by Jon Ackerson's former wife from whom he was divorced, the former Patricia Ormerod (1944-2012). She is interred beside her family at Evergreen Cemetery in Louisville. Ackerson's second wife is Kay B. Ackerson, formerly Kay Meurer, the former wife of businessman Gerald Meurer. She is a real estate broker who earlier served for three terms on the Jeffersontown City Council. Early in his term on the Metro Council, Ackerson became the subject of media interest when his office aide, Sherlon R. Worthington, abruptly left the position after having accused Mrs. Ackerson of interfering with her own duties. Worthington wrote that Mrs. Ackerson \\"came in my office and asked me what my problem was. I told her she was my problem.\\" From 2004 to 2007, Ackerson was a director of the Kentucky Employers' Mutual Insurance Authority during the administration of Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher. Ackerson is considered a Moderate Republican, but he supported Rand Paul for the United States Senate in the 2010 election. In 2011, Ackerson endorsed the reelection of Democratic Governor Steve Beshear for a second term. Beshear unseated Fletcher in the 2007 campaign. Beshear subsequently appointed Ackerson to represent employers on the Unemployment Insurance Commission for a term extending from January 1, 2013, to October 26, 2016. In 2012, Ackerson lost his primary election for the Metro Council seat by 37 votes (1,306 to 1,269) to Marilyn Parker, a favorite of the Tea Party movement, who subsequently carried the general election as well. Like Ackerson, Parker supported Paul for the Senate in 2010. Ackerson had formerly attended Tea Party meetings and expressed surprise that the group had moved against him in favor of Parker.

It has smooth, mottled bark, linear to narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven or nine, white flowers and hemispherical or cup-shaped fruit.bark Description Eucalyptus gillenii is a multi-stemmed mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, mottled grey and brownish bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section and lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are dull, green to blue-green, linear to lance- shaped or curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven or nine in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded to conical operculum. Flowering occurs from February to April or from November to December and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody globular, hemispherical or cup-shaped capsule long and wide, containing dark brown, pyramid-shaped seeds long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus gillenii was first formally described in 1926 by Alfred Ewart and Lesley Kerr in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria from samples collected near Mount Gillen by Ewatt in 1924. It is named for Francis James Gillen who was an anthropologist, ethnologist and the first postmaster at Alice Springs. Mount Gillen in the MacDonnell Ranges, where the type specimen was collected from, was also named for the same man. Distribution and habitat This mallee is common on rocky hills in the central and south- western areas of Central Australia, especially in the MacDonnell Ranges and Petermann Ranges of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is less common on Mount Wooltarlinna and Mount Lindsay in the Birksgate Range of far north-western South Australia and there is an outlying population at Skirmish Hill in the Dean Range in Western Australia. It grows in crevices on and at the base of rock domes in water run-off areas. In South Australia it often occurs with Corymbia eremaea and Eucalyptus intertexta. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified in Western Australia as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Mallee red gum is a hardy grower and is both frost and drought tolerant.

W. Nix (1880 ‚Äì 1949) was an American preacher who recorded 54 sermons and gospel songs in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He is best remembered for his commercially successful sermon, \\"Black Diamond Express to Hell.\\" Nix's recordings were reintroduced when he was credited as a major influence on Thomas A. Dorsey, the \\"father of gospel music.\\" However, the minutes of the 1921 National Baptist Convention confirm that Nix's brother, William Nix, Jr., was actually the influence on Dorsey. Accordingly, nearly all of A.W.'s sermons have been reissued on Document Records and compilation albums. Biography A.W. Nix was born in Harmony Hill, Texas in Rusk County in 1880, moving later to Longview, Texas in Gregg County. In 1906, Andrew was licensed as a minister, beginning at Shiloh Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas. He has been described as a plainspoken speaker, but one who demonstrated his knowledge of formal study by incorporating historical figures into his sermons, most notably \\"The Matchless King.\\" In the 1920s, Nix signed with Vocalion Records, as record companies discovered the market in the black community for recordings by preachers. In Nix's recording period, which was between 1927-1931, he completed 54 (three unissued) sermons that, for the most part, featured him as the lead vocalist. The only other preacher to best Nix's numbers during this time was Reverend J. M. Gates of Atlanta, Georgia, who recorded over 200 sermons. Nix's recording techniques and sermon focal points closely resembled Gates' approach. In 1927, Gates recorded two sermons, \\"Hell Bound Express Train\\" and \\"Death's Black Train Is Coming\\", which are thought to influence Reverend Nix's best-known work, \\"Black Diamond Express to Hell\\". Six total recordings under the same title were recorded by Nix as a continuation of the previous, and, like Gates, he begins to include congregation members who have their own speaking roles. \\"Black Diamond Express to Hell\\" chronicles various stops made by a train with \\"sin the engineer, pleasure the headlight, and the Devil the conductor\\". In a more extensive description, writer Martha Simmons explains how \\"Nix names various stops that a train takes on its way to hell. Stops include Liars Avenue, Drunkardville, and Gambling Tower. Before each stop, Nix intones and thunders the phrase, 'Next station!'. At each stop, he gives the characteristics of the types of people likely to board the Black Diamond Express ‚Äì gossipers, liars, gamblers, and more\\". With the success of \\"Black Diamond Express to Hell\\", the Reverend established the precedent for the recorded sermon series, a method which became successful for several other preachers of the era. By 1940, Nix had disappeared from public attention and he died in 1949. Several compilation albums feature his sermons, with \\"Black Diamond Express to Hell\\" being found on The Gospel Book, Gospel: Negro Spirituals, Rough Trade Shops, and Goodbye, Babylon, among others. In the mid-1990s, Document Records released an album which focuses solely on the Reverend's work called Rev. A. W. Nix: Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order (1927‚Äì1928). The Reverend's homiletic preaching, expressive articulation, and soulful singing has continued to influence others of the practice. Thomas A. Dorsey credited Nix's brother, William, with singing \\"I Do, Don't You?\\" spurring his religious conversion at the National Baptist Convention in Chicago, in 1921. As Dorsey recalled: \\"my heart was inspired to become a great singer and worker in the Kingdom of the Lord  and impress people just as the great singer [Nix] did that Sunday morning\\".

Nardone is an American women's employment advocate and nonprofit director. She is the executive director of New Ventures Maine, a career counseling and employment development program for middle-aged and older women who have been thrust into the role of family breadwinner due to the death or disability of a spouse, divorce, or separation. Nardone has been one of the directors of the organization, headquartered at the University of Maine at Augusta, since its inception as the Maine Displaced Homemakers Program in 1978. She was inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame in 1991. Early life and education Nardone grew up in Presque Isle, Maine, the daughter of Orlando Nardone and Sara (Sally) Culberson Nardone. She has one sister and one brother. Her father died suddenly of a heart attack in 1965, forcing her mother to reenter the workforce after twenty years as a homemaker. After graduating from high school in 1966, Nardone attended Westbrook College in Portland, Maine on a scholarship and graduated with an associate degree, entering the workforce as a secretary. In the 1970s she moved to Cape Cod to work as a day care teacher, and earned her bachelor's degree through University Without Walls, run by the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She later attained a master's degree in educational administration at Wheelock College in Boston. At the age of 30, she returned to Maine to work in women's advocacy. Maine Displaced Homemakers Program In 1978 Nardone co-founded the Maine Displaced Homemakers Program and became its director. The program, headquartered at the University of Maine at Augusta, assisted middle-aged and older women thrust into the role of family breadwinner after the death or disability of a spouse, divorce, or separation. These women were called \\"displaced homemakers\\" because their original goal had been to nurture their families in the home rather than enter the workforce. The program provided \\"prevocational training\\", employment counseling, job placement assistance, and a statewide toll-free information and referral line for job-seekers, and interacted with local, state, regional, and national organizations to increase employment opportunities and business development. By 1993, 1,000 women annually were signing up for the program, and its budget had grown from $15,000 in 1978 to nearly $1 million in 1993. In the mid-1990s the program was renamed the Maine Centers for Women, Work and Community. In the 2000s it began widening its focus to meet the needs of women wishing to broaden their professional and business opportunities. By 2010, Women, Work and Community had set up 18 locations around the state providing individual career coaching and seminars on financial management and starting a business. In 2016 the program was rebranded as New Ventures Maine, with Nardone continuing as executive director. Awards and honors In 2008 Nardone was named the Women in Business Champion by the Maine and New England chapters of the Small Business Administration. She is also the recipient of the 1989 Progress Award from the Maine Commission for Women, and the 1991 Maryann Hartman Award from the University of Maine Women's Studies Program. She was inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of Fame in 1991. In 2015 a Gilda E. Nardone Scholarship Fund was established at the University of Maine at Augusta to assist university students who undertook a career development or business development training program through New Ventures Maine.

She and her husband, E. Donnall Thomas (Don), partnered to research leukemia and other blood disorders, and developed the technique for transplanting bone marrow.  Early life and education  Thomas was born and raised in Texas, attending public school in her hometown of San Antonio throughout her childhood. She studied journalism at the University of Texas at Austin.  Career and research  Thomas decided to switch to medicine and moved to New England Deaconess Hospital, where she qualified as a hematology technician. Thomas graduated from medical technology training in the 1940s and worked as a technician for other physicians while her husband completed his degree and got his laboratory. Thomas worked part time in her husband's lab while their children were young. In the 1950s, Don became physician-in-chief at Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in New York, and the work on bone marrow transplant began. In 1963 they moved to Seattle and continued their research at the University of Washington School of Medicine. They conducted research together at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center beginning in 1975, when it was founded and where she was, for fifteen years, chief administrator of the clinical research division, of which Don was the director.

Featuring Hrishikesh, Vivek, Narain, Sanchita Shetty and Miya in the lead roles, the film's score and soundtrack is composed by Anirudh Ravichander. The film began production during early 2016 and was released on 17 February 2017. Plot Film starts with Shiva and his gang visits a bungalow. They experience spooky incidents in the haunted bungalow. Cast * Hrishikesh as Shiva * Vivek as Raj * Narain as Praveen Thomas * Sanchita Shetty as Riya * Miya as Thulasi * Amzath Khan as Suresh (Nepali) * Arjun Chidambaram as Kural * Andreanne Nouyrigat as a Russian lady Production The film began pre-production works during October 2015, with composer Anirudh Ravichander revealing that he would work on a film titled Rum directed by Sai Bharath and starring his cousin, Hrishikesh, in the lead role. The project was announced to be funded by All in Pictures, while the director stated that it would be a \\"horror-heist film\\". After completing a course in filmmaking in Canada, Sai Bharath had finished the script three years prior to the beginning of the shoot. He had approached Hrishikesh, who was looking to appear in his first lead role, after playing a supporting role in Velaiilla Pattadhari (2014). In February 2016, the film's first look poster was unveiled, with Sanchita Shetty and Miya revealed as the film's lead actresses. Narain, Vivek and Amzath Khan were also announced to be playing supporting roles in the film. The title Rum was revealed by the makers to be an ancient Tamil word meaning \\"verdict\\", rather than the alcohol as widely presumed. The shoot of the film began in February 2016 in Chennai and was finished by June 2016. During May 2016, the team shot for a fast-paced gaana song titled \\"Peiyo Phobilia\\" in a dense forest in Padappai and set up a campsite on location. The final schedule for the film began on 1 June 2016 and carried on for fifteen days until completion. Soundtrack The film's music was composed by Anirudh Ravichander, while the audio rights of the film was acquired by Sony Music. The album released on 2 November 2016 at an event held at Park Hyatt, Chennai with the lead cast and crew in attendance. Prior to the release of the album, a single track titled \\"Hola Amigo\\" was released in April 2016. Anirudh collaborated with Malaysian rapper Balan Kashmir for the song which carried the theme of intolerance, and the song subsequently went viral on social media after it was promoted by American DJ Diplo. A second single, \\"Peiyophobilia\\", was also released in September 2016 and featured vocals by actor Silambarasan, who collaborated on a film soundtrack with Anirudh for the first time. Behindwoods.com stated \\"Rum is an EDM intoxicant from Anirudh, which is addictive\\". Release Originally produced by Vijay Raghavendra, the film‚Äôs Tamil Nadu theatrical rights were sold to Shri Sai Circuit 6000, with the makers releasing the film in 150 screens across Tamil Nadu. Upon release, the film received a positive review from The New Indian Express, with the critic stating \\"in the first half, both horror and humour have worked out well\\", \\"in the second half that the plot loses steam\\" but \\"it peps up again towards the end\\". In contrast, Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu wrote \\"Rum feels incoherent, and you wonder if it‚Äôs because the director was trying to be avant-garde, or whether he just ran out of film\\", stating that \\"the film has no spirit\\". A reviewer from Sify.com stated \\"Rum is an average horror comedy\\" and that the \\"major problem with Rum is that technically the film is amateurish and delivers very little in terms of novelty\\". The reviewer added the film \\"has more laugh-out-loud moments than jump-in-your-seat jolts\\" and that \\"it is just dull, lazy film making from debutant director Sai Bharath\\". Behindwoods.com states it was \\"a horror comedy that has nothing new to offer\\", concluding that \\"the film lacks clarity and moves cluelessly in its initial moments\\". The film will also be released in Telugu as Manthri Gari Bangla in 2017.

Its initial role was to convert trainee pilots to jets using De Havilland Vampire T.5 single seat jets and Vampire T.11 twin-seat jets. In March 1962 these types were exchanged for the Vickers Varsity T.1 twin piston-engine navigational trainers. The school took new graduates who had completed basic pilot training and provided further training in the handling of multi-engine aircraft as a precursor to posting onto Bomber or Transport squadrons/units. The Varsity remained in service with 5 FTS until early in 1974 when it was replaced in the role by the Scottish Aviation Jetstream T.1. 5 FTS was disbanded on 31 December 1974 when the need for training on piston engined aircraft reduced.

As early as 1815, he purchased merino sheep from William Jarvis for his farm. Additionally, Cockrill purchased the 1,000-acre Tulip Grove from Andrew Jackson Donelson for US$53,000 in 1854. Cockrill won many prizes at the Middle Tennessee Fair and the Tennessee State Fair, two agricultural fairs. Additionally, he won a prize for the finest wool on exhibition at the 1851 World's fair in London, England. He was also the recipient of a gold medal from the Tennessee legislature \\"as a testimonial of distinguished merit and unrivaled success in wool-culture, and other agricultural pursuits\\" in 1854. He was featured in De Bow's Review for the superior wool of the sheep he raised. Additionally, he considered building cotton mills with four other planters in his county. He became known as the \\"Wool King of the World\\". Cockrill was the owner of a cotton plantation in Mississippi, with 135 African slaves at one point. Prior to the American Civil War of 1861-1865, Cockrill sold the plantation and 240 slaves he owned; he retained 60 slaves and brought them to Tennessee. By then, he was worth an estimated US$2 million, and he was the richest Tennessean. Cockrill was a supporter of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He loaned US$25,000 in gold to the CSA, and he gave them wool to make Confederate uniforms. When the Union Army invaded, they took his land and stole his cattle. Cockrill was arrested and sent to jail for his Confederate support. Personal life, death and legacy Cockrill married Susan Collinsworth, the daughter of Edward Collingsworth, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, and the sister of James Collinsworth, who served as the 1st Chief Justice of Texas from 1836 to 1838. They had three sons: Benjamin F. Cockrill, who married Sallie, the daughter of Senator Ephraim H. Foster; James Robertson Cockrill, who married his cousin Mary Cockrill; and Mark Stirling Cockrill, who married Mary Hill Goodloe. They also had three daughters: Julie, who married Edward S. Cheatham, the son of Congressman Richard Cheatham; Jane, who married William Watkins; and Henrietta, who married Albert Gallatin Ewing, a Confederate veteran who served under Nathan Bedford Forrest during the war. Cockrill died on June 27, 1872 in Nashville, Tennessee. He was buried at the Mount Olivet Cemetery. His cattle was inherited by his son Mark S. Cockrill and his horses were inherited by his other son, Benjamin F. Cockrill. His daughter Henrietta inherited his house on Charlotte Avenue surrounded by 4,000 acres. Cockrill was inducted into the Tennessee Agricultural Hall of Fame in 1944. The same year, a bronze plaque in his honor was installed at the Tennessee State Capitol.

He has previously worked for the American Ring of Honor (ROH) and Mexican Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), where he was known under the ring name , named after the Japanese God of thunder, and was part of La Ola Amarilla (\\"the Yellow Wave\\") alongside Okumura, Kamaitachi and Fujin. Early life Sho Tanaka was born on August 27, 1989, in Uwajima, Ehime, Japan. While in high school he became involved with Greco- Roman wrestling, something he continued to practice as he attended Tokuyama University. At Tokuyama he was the vice-captain of the wrestling team, competing in the 7th All-Japan University Championship for Greco-Roman wrestling, where he came in third over all. Professional wrestling career Inspired by New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) wrestler Hiroshi Tanahashi Tanaka attended the NJPW Dojo in February, 2012 training for his professional wrestling career. =New Japan Pro-Wrestling (2012‚Äì2016)= Tanaka in September 2015 On November 11, 2012 Tanaka made his pro wrestling debut in the opening match of the NEVER: Shodai NEVER Musabetsu Kyu Oza Kettei Tournament 1st round show where he lost to Takaaki Watanabe. Tanaka competed as one of NJPW's \\"Young Lions\\" a class of rookie wrestlers who work mostly against each other early on, wearing all black gear and with no particular ring character, all part of the structured learning process in NJPW. Throughout 2013 and 2014 Tanaka often faced off against fellow Young Lion Yohei Komatsu, with both men trading victories in both singles and tag team competition. By 2015 Tanaka and Komatsu had begun teaming together on a regular basis, including working together in the New Japan Rumble as part of Wrestle Kingdom 9 on January 5, 2015. The two teamed up to eliminate Tiger Mask and Taichi but were both eliminated by Tama Tonga Tanaka was called upon to replace an injured Rey Cometa on a NJPW/Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre co-promoted Fantastica Mania 2015 show on January 14. Tanaka and Stigma lost to La Peste Negra (\\"The Black Plague\\"; B√°rbaro Cavernario and Mr. Niebla) On February 11, 2015 Tanaka defeated rival and occasional tag team partner Yohei Komatsu in the opening match of NJPW's 2015 The New Beginning in Osaka show. In June and July 2015 Tanaka represented NJPW in Pro Wrestling Noah's Global Junior Heavyweight League. During the tournament he earned two points by defeating Hitoshi Kumano but lost to Daisuke Harada, Zack Sabre Jr. El Desperado, Kenoh and Yoshinari Ogawa to be eliminated from the tournament. At the 2015 Destruction in Kobe show Tanaka and Komatsu defeated fellow Young Lions David Finlay and Jay White. In early 2016 it was announced that Tanaka and Komatsu would compete in the 2016 Fantastica Mania series of shows, competing in what NJPW called the \\"Yohei Komatsu and Sho Tanaka send-off game\\", announcing that the two would travel to Mexico and work for CMLL as part of their continued in-ring skill development. The team worked the opening match for each of the six Fantastica Mania events, losing each time. =Overseas learning excursion (2016‚Äì2017)= Tanaka and Komatsu became be the latest in a long line of young Japanese wrestlers to travel to Mexico to learn the lucha libre style. In Mexico, Tanaka was given the ring name Raijin, named after the Japanese God of Thunder, teaming with Komatsu who would be known as Fujin, named after the Japanese God of Wind. The duo made their Mexican debut on January 31, 2016, teaming up with Okumura, forming the most recent version of La Ola Amarilla (\\"The Yellow Wave\\"). The group was joined by Kamaitachi, a previous NJPW trainee who has worked for CMLL since 2014. In October 2016, Tanaka and Komatsu, now billed as \\"Sho\\" and \\"Yohey\\", The Tempura Boyz, began working regularly for American promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), with whom NJPW also had a working relationship. =Return to NJPW (2017‚Äìpresent)= On October 9, 2017, at King of Pro-Wrestling, Tanaka and Komatsu, billed as \\"Sho\\" and \\"Yoh\\", returned to NJPW, when they were revealed as Rocky Romero's new tag team Roppongi 3K. The two defeated Funky Future (Ricochet and Ryusuke Taguchi) in their return match to become the new IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions. Through their affiliation with Romero, Sho and Yoh also became part of the Chaos stable. On November 5 at Power Struggle, Roppongi 3K defeated Super 69 (ACH and Ryusuke Taguchi) in the finals to win the 2017 Super Jr. Tag Tournament. On January 4, 2018, Roppongi 3K lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) at Wrestle Kingdom 12 in Tokyo Dome, but won it back on January 28 at the New Beginning in Sapporo. Roppongi 3K lost the tag team championships to El Desperado (wrestler) and Yoshinobu Kanemaru at the NJPW 46th Anniversary Event in March 2018. In May 2018, he entered the Best of the Super Juniors tournament. He finished the tournament with 3 wins and 4 losses, failing to advance to the finals. In October, Sho and Yoh entered the 2018 Super Junior Tag League, winning the tournament for the second time in a row to face El Desperado and Yoshinobu Kanemaru at Wrestle Kingdom 13. However, an earlier loss to the team of Shingo Takagi and Bushi made the title match a triple threat, that Takagi and Bushi would go onto win, with Takagi pinning Sho. At New Japan‚Äôs 47th Anniversary Event, Sho and Yoh would defeat Takagi and Bushi to win the championships for a 3rd time. Sho would then start to call out Takagi for a singles match, even hoping to face Takagi in the Best of the Super Juniors 26 finals. Takagi and Sho would meet on the first night of the tournament with Takagi defeating Sho. In June, Roppongi 3K would lose the Junior Tag Team Championships to the team of El Phantasmo and Taiji Ishimori. In November, Sho and Yoh would win the Super Junior Tag League for the 3rd time in a row. At Wrestle Kingdom 14, Roppongi 3K would defeat Phantasmo and Ishimori to win the titles for a 4th time. Roppongi 3K would make their first successful title defense against Desperado and Kanemaru at The New Beginning in Osaka. They would make their second successful title defense against Rocky Romero and Ryusuke Taguchi on the first night of the New Japan Road tour. Following New Japan‚Äôs return to producing wrestling shows, Sho entered the 2020 New Japan Cup avenging his loss to Shingo Takagi in the first round before losing to Sanada in the second.Sho challenged for his first singles title, the NEVER Openweight Championship, against Takagi at Dominion 2020 and lost. Professional wrestling style As a junior heavyweight, his style is a high-flying one, however unlike most junior heavyweights, Sho incorporates a lot of power moves such as powerbombs, spears, and his finishing move Shock Arrow (cross-arm piledriver). Also, he incorporates his MMA background to his moveset.https://411mania.com/wrestling/csonka-10-post-wwe-matches-for-the- revival/ Mixed martial arts career Tanaka was scheduled to make his mixed martial arts debut on May 27, 2017, fighting Nicholas Trochez in Queens, New York for Golden MMA Championships.

The name was used originally for the progressive trance sound she formed with keyboardists Dave Shaffer and Jake Knights. Music career In December 2001, Taylor brought dubplates of the group's track \\"Free Your Mind\\" to the Winter Music Conference in Miami and handed them out to all of the DJs she admired. She picked up the phone months later, and it was superstar DJ Danny Tenaglia looking to license the track for his Back to Basics collection. The track was an underground dance classic being played by Tiesto, Paul Oakenfold, Ferry Corsten globally in concerts and on club floors around the world. The Free Your Mind track was signed by Rob DiStefano of Twisted Records(America) and the \\"Free Your Mind\\" single which was released in 2003 quickly climbed the dance charts where it was a top 10 dance track in Billboard magazine. Sapphirecut made the news when Taylor contacted the popular and electronica oriented file-sharing network, Soulseek, in an effort to stop the group's music from being shared amongst users. She was concerned that the label she signed the track to would not get any revenue and was concerned for fellow artists. When Soulseek's server host Verio became aware of the situation, they dropped the network and it was unavailable for weeks. Sapphirecut's actions soon became a hot topic on forums across the Internet. Taylor has told interviewers that she choose the Sapphirecut name when she realized that a sapphire needle is used to create a dub plate at a friends new dub plate press Scrunch Recordings in 2001. She found this out when she was helping physically balance his new dub plate press and learned these were used as the original template of vinyls. She decided to be released as a sound globally carried by these type of cuts and named the original sounds that were created in her studio in Philadelphia, Sapphirecut. Sapphirecut has produced many original and remixed releases. She has albums and singles released on various labels including her own label OSP. Sapphirecut is digitally released by Ingrooves and Isolation network. Her album is a mixture of electronic songs written and mixed by Sapphirecut and played by various co artists. Sapphirecut was one of the pioneers opening the airwaves in the Northeast US, California and Maui to club and electronic music with her 2-hour weekly FM/AM/Internet radio program where electronic and dance music played openly from around the globe and DJ/Producers and Electronic Musicians were featured weekly with interviews with fresh shows running for 5 years until 2012. Sapphirecut created the show in her home studio where she used international calls or her recording booth when artists were in town to create the interview content. She mixed the weekly 2 hour show with fresh announced music and served as a talk host, distributing the show for no compensation as a global community service. Reruns have played at various stations since that time. She has had various artists like Markus Schulz, Dfuse, Infusion, David Guetta, etc. as featured artists and created separate heading for each station the show ran was on. In 2006, Sapphirecut co created Videohouse Live with local video and fine artists in Philadelphia which served as a creative visual and musical exchange. The show was a visual original film/fine art program running as both a dinner and late night club event. It was viewed in digital and 3 D forum using submitted works from the art community in Philadelphia. Sapphirecut DJed the event and played at this VJd event in the World Cafe Live in Philadelphia working with the various artists such as the Art Institute of Philadelphia's Instructor Brian Yetzer, as well as visual artist and VJ's Lauren Galante and Masa. Sapphirecut also DJ'ed other Videohouse events at Emerald City in Philadelphia with other VJ's and artists. Sapphirecut asked for no personal compensation for this community service.

The former school building was originally listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The land the old schoolhouse was located on was quite low and flooding and drainage had become a problem. Changes in the city's water system would have affected the area. The Nodaway Valley Historical Society had created a museum with a display of rural schools and the beginnings of 4-H near the fairgrounds. The Goldenrod Schoolhouse was moved to the museum in January 1993. Because of the move it was removed from the National Register in August 1993, and it was returned again the following year.

Thousands of these mods exist,Cadenhead 2014, p. 367 and users can download them from the internet for free. Utilizing additional software, several mods are typically able to be used at the same time in order to enhance gameplay.Van Schaik and Vledder 2015, p. 107 The Minecraft modding community is one of the most active modding communities. Its mods are one of the main reasons behind Minecraft's overall success. Minecraft mods are available for computer and mobile versions of the game, but legacy console versions cannot be modded. Mods for the Bedrock version of the game made using Minecraft API are known as \\"add-ons\\". Technical feasibility Minecraft is a video game particularly known for its adaptability for modifications. Over the course of the years, many independent programmers have made use of that in order to create additional content for the game, known as \\"mods\\". The Java Edition of Minecraft (available for Windows, macOS, and Linux) can be modded through the client or server. Client mods require the player to add files to their game folder and install a mod launcher/loader such as Forge, while server modding leaves the player's game folder untouched and only changes the behavior of the server, to which the player can then log on in order to play a varied game. Client mods can change the behavior or appearance of any aspect of the game, and commonly add new blocks, items, mobs, vehicles and even dimensions. Client mods can result in loss of performance (due to resource demands) for older or weaker computers, especially if the player combines many mods together in a \\"modpack\\"; however, some client mods can increase the game's performance. Modifications to the Java Edition of Minecraft are possible because for each new major version of the game, the community reverse-engineers Minecraft source code, which is written in Java.Koene 2015, Hour 1, pg. 1. Mojang and Microsoft provide little official support for this (for example, the game provides no modding API for Java, although Mojang does provide methods for deobfuscating the game), but the EULA permits non- commercial mods. Modding for the mobile and console versions of Minecraft on the Bedrock codebase is different as that iteration of the game is written in C++ rather than Java. Players who wish to mod their game on Bedrock codebase versions have a simpler process due to the version's built-in official support for \\"add-ons\\", which can be installed faster than Java Edition mods, and require no external mod loaders.  History  Although the first version of Minecraft was released in May 2009, client-side modding of the game did not become popular in earnest until the game reached its alpha stage in June 2010. The only mods that were released during Minecraft Indev and Infdev development stages were a few client-side mods which had minor changes to the game. With the release of Alpha, the first server-side mods began to appear. One of them was hMod, which added some simple but necessary tools to manage a server. Michael Stoyke, also known as Searge who would later go on to work for Mojang, created Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP), which was later renamed to Mod Coder Pack, keeping the same acronym. MCP was a tool which decompiled and deobfuscated Minecraft code. MCP would recompile and reobfuscate new and changed classes, which can be injected into the game. But, if multiple mods modified the same base code, it would conflict. To solve this problem, Risugami's Modloader was created; Modloader prevented any conflict occurring due to multiple mods modifying the same base classes or game resources. Towards the end of 2010, new mods were released which featured more content than previous ones. Minecraft was now preparing to move into its beta development phase, and popular mods such as IndustrialCraft, Railcraft and BuildCraft were first released. As opposed to their predecessors, these mods had the potential to change the entire game instead of simply tweaking minor aspects of it. Bukkit, a server-side mod intended to replace hMod was also released during this time. CraftBukkit, a server software which implemented the Bukkit API was also released. Bukkit allowed server owners to install plug-ins which modified the server's way of taking input and giving output to the player without players having to install client-side mods. Around November 2011, the Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge were released. Forge allowed players to be able to run several mods simultaneously. Forge utilized MCP mappings. Forge also released a server version of Forge, which allowed mods to be run on servers, which eventually led to people creating modded servers. Forge ended the necessity to manipulate the base source code, allowing separate mods to run together without requiring them to touch the base source code. Forge also included many libraries and hooks which made mod development easier. MineCon 2012, where Minecraft lead developer Jens Bergensten held a talk. After Minecraft was fully released in November 2011, the game's modding community continued to grow. In February 2012, Mojang hired developers of the Bukkit to work on an official modding API, allowing mod developers easier access to the Minecraft game files. Bukkit was then maintained by the community. A fork of CraftBukkit, called Spigot which was backward compatible with plugins was also in development. An Alternative to forge named Liteloader was released. Liteloader made modding very simple and promoted adding new content instead of modifying existing content. Like forge, Liteloader also used MCP mappings. In 2013, Forge Mod Loader soon replaced Risugami's Modloader as Modloader wasn't being updated in time by its developers. In early 2014, a new server software named Sponge, which had a very powerful plugin API compared to Bukkit, and was also compatible with running Forge mods was released. Sponge also introduced mixins, an alternatively to modifying byte code. Soon, Liteloader implemented mixins into their API allowing developers to modify in-game content. In mid-2014, Spigot released a server software made to link many servers together. The project was called BungeeCord, and had a separate plugin API from spigot and spigot plugins could work side by side with BungeeCord. Many popular Minecraft servers use BungeeCord to link up Minecraft servers together. PaperMC also released a modified version of BungeeCord called Waterfall, which included optimizations that were not present in Spigot. Concern arose following Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang in late 2014. Members of the modding community feared that Minecrafts new American owners would put an end to Mojang's established practice of giving free rein to mod developers. Despite the concerns, Microsoft did not announce any changes to Mojang's policies, and modding was unaffected. In April 2015, Microsoft announced that it was adding a Minecraft Mod Developer Pack to Microsoft Visual Studio, granting users of the application creation software an easier way to program Minecraft mods. Microsoft released the new pack open source and free of charge, amidst a drive to push towards more open source software. In September 2016, a new modding toolchain known as Fabric was released. Fabric devised its own set of free mappings to use instead of MCP mappings. Fabric also used Sponge's mixins. Fabric was very light and did not have all the elements of a forge mod, and could also be released from developmental snapshot versions of Minecraft, which other mod loaders could not. A new Windows 10 version of Minecraft was announced shortly after which, unlike the previous versions, was to be programmed in C++. This announcement sparked concern amongst the game's fanbase that the Java-based versions would end up being phased out entirely, which would hamper the production of mods as C++ is not as \\"reverse engineerable\\" as Java is known to be. However, Mojang developer Tommaso Checchi reassured fans on Reddit that modding was \\"too important\\" to Minecraft for the Java-based versions to be discontinued. In April 2017, Mojang announced the upcoming creation of the Minecraft Marketplace, where players would be able to sell user-created content for the Windows 10 version of the game (running on the Bedrock codebase). Although this new digital store would specialize in adventure maps, skins, texture packs, PC World did note that this addition would move the Windows 10 version \\"a bit closer to the moddable worlds familiar to classic players\\" of the original Java Edition. In 2018, Forge underwent a large rewrite, partially because of the large changes in Java Edition version 1.13 and to support their new long-term support system for upcoming versions. This made many modders use 1.12.2 as their primary version. Mod Coder Pack stopped receiving updates after 1.12.2. Liteloader was not updated for 1.13, and in its succession came Rift. Rift was a light mod loader for 1.13 to 1.13.2 which also used mixins. However, Liteloader and Rift did not release a mod loader for servers, so Liteloader and Rift mods could only run on the game client. A new server software for 1.12.2 named Magma was released, which allowed using PaperMC plugins and Forge mods together. In late 2018, Fabric underwent a complete rewrite. Mappings' names were changed and more hooks were added to make modding easier. Fabric also began becoming very popular and 1.14 modding began to split between Forge and Fabric. Forge released their new long-term support system for Java Edition version 1.14, and updating mods to newer versions was made easier. In August 2019, Microsoft decided to partner with Nvidia to add support for ray tracing technology. This new update is expected to be released in 2020. =Controversies= Over the course of the years, there have been mod-related controversies with Minecraft. One surrounded a mod called GregTech, which was aimed at increasing Minecrafts difficulty. In 2013, its developer, Greg, noticed that some of GregTech's added recipes had been overwritten by another mod named Tinkers' Construct. Greg, in retaliation, deliberately inserted code into GregTech which would crash the game client if it detected any other mods (such as Tinkers' Construct). The authors of both mods later settled their dispute. Another surrounded the mod Bukkit, an API which enabled others to install server-side mods.Cadenhead 2014, p. 2 In 2014, the leader of the Bukkit team Warren \\"EvilSeph\\" Loo (who previously worked for Mojang) announced that development would cease, and Mojang stepped in to save the project. With Mojang's announcement, the intellectual rights to the project became ambiguous. Licensing conflicts arose between the original creators of Bukkit and maintainers, largely revolving around the who \\"owned\\" the project after the primary maintainers resigned. One major contributor tried to pull the rights to use their code in the game, effectively forcing Bukkit to fall in a state of disrepair for a time. Another controversy came about in March 2017, when Slovakian cybercompany ESET revealed that 87 examples of trojan horse malware were distributed through the Google Play Store under the guise of Minecraft mods. Their purpose was to either aggressively display ads or con players into downloading other apps. Combined, these fake mods gathered over one million downloads in the first three months of 2017. Mod content The mod Tinkers Construct adds foundries to the game, which can be used to smelt raw metals into parts for custom-made tools and weapons. The total number of Minecraft mods is hard to calculate because of how numerous they are. One repository website, CurseForge, features over 55,000 mods . But there are multiple repository websites, which feature all kind of different mod categories like \\"Planet Minecraft\\" or \\"ModForest\\". The types and sorts of content added by these modifications also take on many different forms. For instance, there are mods that add new dimensions that can be visited by the player. The Galacticraft mod allows players to build rockets in order to fly to the Moon and several planets, and collect their resources and Twilight Forest creates a dimension that enables players to explore a fantasy-style forest and hunt for treasures. Some mods mainly focus on technology, and add an assortment of machines that can help the player to automate the production of certain in-game materials. Examples of technology- oriented mods include Extra Utilities, a mod that introduces various machines that can be used to generate power, and a random assortment of other blocks and items; BuildCraft, a classic mod known for its many variants of machines, pumps, and pipes; and IndustrialCraft, a mod which adds metals, electric tools, generators, including nuclear reactors, jetpacks, powered armor, and nuclear items. In addition to IndustrialCraft metal weapons, other projects allow for an even wider range of available weaponry: Flan's Mod has modern- style warfare including guns, tanks and grenades,Van Schaik and Vledder 2015, p. 113 while Tinkers' Construct allows players to forge and customize their own tools and weapons, some involving a foundry or a forge. Other mods attempt to customize the natural elements in Minecraft, with mods like Natura and Forestry adding new trees and crops, with the latter adding multiblock automatic farms, beekeeping and butterfly-keeping. Mo' Creatures, on the other hand, focuses rather on allowing more animal species into Minecraft, while Pixelmon (since said to be shut down on the official site) supplements the game with monsters and mechanics from the Pok√©mon franchise. Fossils & Archaeology provides for dinosaurs, while CustomNPCs and Millenaire upgrade the game's NPC's. Not all mods will add gameplay elements, however. Others merely tweak the GUI, for example by adding a minimap, try to smoothen the game rendering, like Optifine, or by allowing the player to browse through all the items in both the base game and the player's mods and look up how to craft them, like JEI (Just Enough Items). Optifine is also the most popular mod to bring shaders support to Minecraft. They completely change the game look by adding shadows, dynamic lights and reflective surfaces. They are, however, very hardware-demanding. =Modpacks= Mods are sometimes grouped together in so-called \\"modpacks\\", which can be easily downloaded and played by the end user without requiring the player to have extensive knowledge on how to set up the game.Van Schaik and Vledder 2015, p. 119 Content creators use that to their advantage in order to allow mods to interact so that a particular experience can be delivered, sometimes aided by throwing configuration files and custom textures into the mix. The most popular modpacks can be downloaded and installed through launchers, like the Twitch Desktop App, Feed the Beast, RLcraft, Technic Launcher and ATLauncher. Official recognition In 2012 Mojang claimed to be starting work on a repository for Minecraft mods. Their help website lists video tutorials that teach the player how to install and play Minecraft mods. Minecrafts creator Markus Persson admitted in 2012 that he was initially skeptical of mods, fearing that the usermade content would threaten his vision for the game. Persson says he came around, as he claims to have realized that mods are \\"a huge reason of what Minecraft is\\". In some cases, authors of mods even ended up getting a job at Mojang, and some in-game features, such as pistons and horses, were originally from mods. In 2016, Mojang announced their official support for mods for the Bedrock version of Minecraft, where they are known as \\"add-ons\\". Influence =Minecraft itself= Mods have influenced the main Minecraft game on three occasions. Mod developer Dr. Zhark added horses to the game through the Mo' Creatures mod. Later on he helped Mojang adapt horses for use in standard issue Minecraft. Pistons were also originally a part of a mod too, but impressed Minecrafts creators so much that they added the feature to the main game. Mojang also admitted that they admired all of the work done on server side modding API Bukkit. In 2012, the Swedish company ended up hiring the lead developers of the project. =Education= Minecraft is a game which is occasionally used in schools for educational purposes. Minecraft mods are credited for being a gateway for children to pick up coding and programming. Several educational projects have been created to further encourage students to learn coding through Minecraft, including LearnToMod, ComputerCraftEdu, and Minecraft: Pi Edition, all of which are offered free to teachers. Programming classes utilizing Minecraft were also started by the University of California, which aims to teach children aged 8‚Äì18 how to program applications. In 2011, MinecraftEdu formed to sell a version of Minecraft to schools that enabled the teaching of a wider variety of subjects including language, history and art. In January 2016, Microsoft announced a new tool, \\"Minecraft: Education Edition\\", which would be designed specifically for classroom use and which would continue on the legacy of \\"MinecraftEdu\\" to teach a wide variety of subjects using Minecraft. In The Parent's Guidebook to Minecraft, author Cori Dusmann denotes that homeschooling and Minecraft make for an interesting match, as creating simple mods can be an \\"illustration of scientific principles,\\" to which homeschooling providers are receptive.Dusman 2013, p. 214 The idea of introducing Minecraft into school curriculums was resisted by Tom Bennett, who serves as an adviser to the British government. According to Bennett, Minecraft was a gimmick, and schools would do well to \\"drain the swamp of gimmicks\\" and resort to just books for teaching. Bennett's condemnation was rebutted by a number of journalists for The Guardian, who thought that Minecraft in schools was a worthwhile innovation. Critical reception PC Worlds Nate Ralph calls installing mods for Minecraft \\"a somewhat convoluted process\\", but does admit it could serve the player who desires \\"a little more out of the experience\\" of playing the game. Max Eddy of PC Magazine also raises a point concerning the process of setting up a game augmented with mods, claiming \\"it seems rather complicated\\" and that at first he was \\"too afraid to mod Minecraft at all\\", but learned to appreciate it when he realized that modding Minecraft is \\"pretty forgiving\\". Eddy does nevertheless mention that he feels Mojang's fast development pace regarding the main game has slowed down the progress of the most popular mods. Similarly, Benjamin Abbott of Metro agrees that adding mods to Minecraft is \\"a thorough pain in the backside\\", though he concedes that \\"the result is usually worth it\\". Minecraft mod Galacticraft was mod of the week in PC Gamer in July 2013. At San Jose Mercury News, George Avalos claims that mods are definitely suited for \\"mainstream enthusiasts\\", but does warn that precaution must be taken in order to avoid downloading \\"dangerous and spammy software\\" when looking for Minecraft mods. Avalos also remarks that installing mods will probably require adult attention, even though Minecraft typically appeals to children.

It is intended to overcome the problem of cancers becoming resistant to monoclonal antibody therapies. Mechanism of Action The EGFR signaling pathway is often exploited by many different types of cancers, and therefore is a common drug target. MM-151 can be used to block these oncogenic signaling pathways in order to prevent tumor growth and survival. In addition, the mixture of antibodies can bind multiple parts of the EGFR molecule, so the cancer cannot develop resistance by mutating one site at a time. Clinical Trials = Clinical Trial NCT01520389 = A Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of solid tumors with MM-151 began in January 2012. This non- randomized, open-labeled, dose-escalating phase 1 trial was conducted with 112 patients with varying tumor types. There were four participating locations for this trial in the United States; University of Colorado Denver, Horizon Oncology Research Inc., Roswell Park Cancer Institute, and South Texas Accelerated Research Therapeutics, LLC. The primary goals of the trial were to verify the safety of MM-151 and determine the dose of MM-151 alone and in combination with irinotecan to be used for a phase 2 trial. There were 3 arms involved in this trial; MM-151 dose escalation, MM-151 expansion in KRAS wild type colorectal cancer, and MM-151 + irinotecan. Merrimack Pharmaceuticals released preliminary results from trial NCT01520389 in June 2014 after presenting at the annual conference for the American Society of Cancer Oncology (ASCO). MM-151 was found to be acceptable by safety regulations for EGRF therapies in addition to expressing promising clinical activity for patients with colorectal cancer (8 patients maintained stable disease for 4 month and 2 patients had a partial response). The clinical trial was completed in January 2016, and the final analysis of trial data was published in June 2016. It was found that 21% of metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with MM-151 over the course of the trial responded positively to treatment. In addition, tumor size decreased in 45% of patients. The results prove MM-151‚Äôs ability to combat resistance of other EGRF therapies in patients that have already been heavily pre-treated. A phase 2 trial for MM-151 is planned to exclusively treat patients with colorectal cancer. = Clinical Trial NCT02538627 = A second phase 1 clinical trial involving MM-151 began in August 2015. For this trial, MM-151 was administered in combination MM-121 (another antibody produced by Merrimack Pharmaceuticals). The trial consists of 2 parts: Dose escalation, and expansion. The trial is structured similar to previous trials with MM-151 but slightly more selective with patients diagnosed with Colorectal Cancer, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck only. The trial is expected to be completed in December 2016. = Clinical Trial NCT02785068 = In May 2016, Merrimack announced their partnership with Baxalta for an upcoming phase 1 clinical trial. Merrimack's MM-151 and ONIVYDE¬Æ (irinotecan liposome injection, also known as nal-IRI) will be used in combination to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. ONIVYDE¬Æ is FDA approved and has been successful in treating metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas by inhibiting topoisomerase I function. The study will begin as a phase 1 safety clinical trial, but is planned to transfer into a phase 2 efficacy study after the maximum dosage is determined. Although Merrimack is still recruiting patients, the trial is scheduled to be completed in October 2018.  Commercialization  = Company Information = MM-151 is made by Merrimack Pharmaceuticals ‚Äì a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ONIVYDE¬Æ was FDA approved in October 2015 and became Merrimack's first commercialized drug, but they currently have 4 novel antibodies, including MM-151, involved in clinical trials and many more in pre-clinical stages. In November 2008, Merrimack began a very important collaboration with Adimab LLC. Under this agreement, Merrimack was issued a research license and granted ‚Äúworldwide, non-exclusive, royalty free right to use materials provided by Adimab to perform non-clinical research during the evaluation term.‚Äù Merrimack has paid Adimab a technology access fee, research fees (based on estimated research costs), and a fee for achieving certain technical milestones in advance. In addition, Merrimack has agreed to pay up to $13.5 million to Adimab per therapeutic area as certain regulatory milestones are reached, and has an obligation to pay Adimab royalties based on sales of future therapeutic products. Four antibodies (including MM-151) were created as a result of this collaboration, and at least one of the anti-bodies must be involved in the commercialization of a future product for Merrimack to fulfill their obligations to Adimab. Merrimack increased their total research and development expenses by 16% from 2014 to 2015 (from 138.5 million to 161 million). However, the spending on development of MM-151 specifically decreased by $3.7 million from 2014 to 2015, with a total of $5,329,000 spent on development of MM-151 in 2015. Instead, Merrimack increased funding to support MM-151 manufacturing and on-going clinical trials by $2.1 million in 2015. = Investment Information = Merrimack Pharmaceuticals is a publicly traded company listed as \\"MACK\\" in the Nasdaq Global Market. The current stock price as of November 2016 is $6.16 with a range of $4.39-$9.63 over the past year. = Intellectual Property = MM-151 is protected under patent both inside and outside of the United States until at least 2032. Merrimack has additional patents and a Patent Cooperation Treaty pending for treatment of colorectal cancer specifically with MM-151 which will be in effect until at least 2035 if approved.  Future of MM-151  Merrimack is currently in working on choosing patients that have a high probability for successful therapeutic treatment with MM-151 based on key bio- markers for EGFR pathways.

The work is a survey of the development of Western political thought as reflected through the prism of Roy's philosophical ideas and includes a presentation of his own original thinking about \\"New Humanism.\\" History =Background= Indian political philosopher M. N. Roy began work on what would be his final major project, Reason, Romanticism and Revolution, in 1948.Ramendra Nath, Manbendra Nath Roy (1887‚Äî1954),\\" Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, www.iep.utm.edu/ Roy's process of research, writing, and revision would continue for nearly half a decade, with the final typescript prepared for the press in April 1952. In introducing his work, Roy asserted that modern civilization faced a \\"cultural and moral crisis\\" that compelled thoughtful people to seek a return to society's \\"humanist tradition.\\"M.N. Roy, Reason, Romanticism and Revolution: Volume One. Calcutta: Renaissance Publishers, 1952; pg. v. Roy attributed this crisis to a negative byproduct of the 19th Century victory of skepticism and empiricism over other more immutable and deterministic belief systems ‚Äî a process which not only \\"set human spirit free\\" but which also ushered in new forms of subjugation. \\"If empiricism deposed reason from the seat of the supreme judge, pragmatism subordinated moral values to practical considerations,\\" Roy declared. Reason, Romanticism and Revolution was in some ways an extension of an argument begun by Roy in his 1946 book, Beyond Communism to Humanism, in which the centralism and deterministic economic basis of Marxism was rejected as well as the atomized society associated with individualism, in favor of a loosely structured \\"radical democracy\\" of self-governing local units which administered society at a local level, coordinating a cooperative economy.\\"Manabendra Nath Roy, 1887‚Äì1954,\\" in Robert Benewick and Philip Green (eds.), The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political Thinkers. London: Routledge, 1998; pp. 276-277. Attempting to move past Marxism, Roy presented his book as a grand \\"humanist interpretation of cultural history\\" which also sought to \\"outline a comprehensive philosophy which links up social and political practice with a scientific metaphysics of rationality and ethics.\\"Roy, Reason, Romanticism and Revolution: Volume One, pg. vi. =Structure= Dust jacket of the Indian first edition of Volume Two of Reason, Romanticism and Revolution, published posthumously in 1955. Roy's book attempted to systematically review the development of Western political philosophy from the birth of modern thought through the Age of Enlightenment, the emergence of 19th Century Romanticism and Liberalism as a reforming ethos, as well as the Marxist response. Roy perceived Marxism at an impasse and posited his own theory of a \\"New Humanism\\" as an alternative to what he characterized as the \\"Crisis of the Twentieth Century.\\" Volume One (1952) :Chapter 1: Introduction :Chapter 2: Human Nature :Chapter 3: The Law-Governed Universe :Chapter 4: The Revolt of Man :Chapter 5: Revolt of the Angels :Chapter 6: The Natural Law :Chapter 7: Birth of Modern Philosophy :Chapter 8: The New Science :Chapter 9: The Enlightenment :Chapter 10: The Great Revolution‚ÄîI :Chapter 11: The Great Revolution‚ÄîII Volume Two (1955) :Chapter 1: Reaction and Romanticism :Chapter 2: History of Romanticism :Chapter 3: Romantic Extravagance :Chapter 4: Liberalism: Origin and Tradition :Chapter 5: Fallacies of Liberalism :Chapter 6: Utilitarianism :Chapter 7: Neo-Classical Rationalism :Chapter 8: Hegel to Marx :Chapter 9: Marxism :Chapter 10: The Twins of Irrationalism :Chapter 11: The Crisis of the Twentieth Century :Chapter 12: The Way Out :Chapter 13: New Humanism =Critical response= Reason, Romanticism and Revolution proved to be Roy's best-known work, generating critical attention in European intellectual circles during the decade of the 1950s.Innaiah Narisetti, M.N.

Location The road starts at Busega, a neighborhood in Makindye Division in the city of Kampala. It continues in a southwesterly direction, through Kyengera, Nabbingo and Nsangi to end at Mpigi, a distance of approximately . The approximate coordinates of the road, near the town of Maya, are 0¬∞15'54.0\\"N, 32¬∞25'49.0\\"E (Latitude:0.265012; Longitude:32.430288). The expressway is a component of the Kampala‚ÄìMasaka Road. Background The current road is a two-lane single carriageway in good condition. The government of Uganda plans to widen the road to a four-lane dual carriage highway, as part of its efforts to decongest Kampala. The construction is planned to be funded under a public-private partnership arrangement. The design includes four major interchanges at Nabbingo, Nsangi, Maya and Lugala. These interchanges will allow connection with the Kampala Northern Bypass Highway and the Entebbe‚ÄìKampala Expressway. The government of Uganda has secured funding of US$91 million (UShs322 billion) to fund the section between Busega and Mpigi. The section between Kibuye and Busega is to be expanded by China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), with funding from the Exim Bank of China, once CCCC has completed the Entebbe-Kampala Expressway. Timetable In 2014, the China Communications Construction Company, which was also commissioned to build the Entebbe‚ÄìKampala Expressway, was contracted to construct an interchange at Busega which connects the two expressways. To save money and time, the same contractor was hired to construct the section between Kibuye and Busega, measuring about . In December 2016, the Daily Monitor reported that construction was expected to begin in 2018 and last three years. In July 2019, after delays, the construction contract was awarded to a consortium of Chinese companies, that includes China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and China Railway 19th Bureau Group Company Limited. Construction is expected to last 36 months, with commission planned in the second half of 2022. Construction began in May 2020 and completion is expected sometime in 2023. Construction costs Application for funding has been made to the African Development Bank (AfDB). The estimated cost of the road was budgeted at approximately US$100 million, as reported by the Daily Monitor. The cost is now budgeted at US$91 million (loan from AfDB) plus $41 million contributed by the government of Uganda for a total of US$132 million. In July 2019, the Daily Monitor newspaper quoted the contract price at Shs547 billion (approx. US$150 million), partly borrowed from the African Development Bank (AfDB). The New Vision, another Ugandan newspaper reported that the entire construction cost was funded by an AfDB loan.

Franklin (1892-1934, also known as Madame N.A. Franklin) was a Texas beautician and entrepreneur. Her business, geared towards beauty products for black women, was ranked third in the country behind Annie M. Turnbo-Malone's company and Madame C.J. Walker's \\"beauty empire.\\" Her cosmetics were \\"meant to flatter, rather than lighten darker skin tones.\\" Franklin's beauty products were never patented.  Biography  Franklin was born in Cuero, Texas. She was married on June 7, 1907, though she kept her name and passed on her last name to her daughter, Abbie. In 1910, she moved to San Antonio and opened a salon inside her home. During that time, she also sold her homemade hair products door-to-door to black families. She was consciously emulating other \\"beauty moguls\\" like Walker. Franklin moved to Fort Worth in 1916. She operated a beauty salon there for a short time before she moved to Houston. In 1917, she opened the Franklin School of Beauty Culture. She also opened a manufacturing center for beauty projects in the same year. In 1922, Franklin moved to Chicago, and taught the \\"Franklin way\\" of hair styling to others. She established a headquarters on South State Street, a branch on Grand Boulevard and a manufacturing plant for her beauty products on East 35th Street in Chicago. She maintained her original school in Houston, even as she was expanding into other locations. In Houston, W.L. McCoy was the general manager of her salon, overseeing a renovation of the building in 1924. She began to prepare her daughter, Abbie to take over the business; in 1927, they formed the N.A. Franklin Association of Beauty Culture. In 1930, due to health reasons, she turned over her business to Abbie and her son-in-law, James H. (J.H.) Jemison. When Franklin died in 1934, her business was inherited by Abbie and Jemison.  Legacy  Abbie and Jemison continued to promote Franklin's beauty school, although they withdrew from Chicago and focused on Houston after 1934. Franklin's beauty school is still in operation in Houston. It is considered the \\"oldest continuously operated beauty school in Texas,\\" and before desegregation, was the largest African American beauty school in the Southern United States.

It then flows southeast through the west side of the city and the Oregon State University campus to enter the river near Reser Stadium and Avery Park. It passes under U.S. Route 20, concurrent here with Oregon Route 34, between the stadium and Marys River, about from its confluence with the Willamette River. The creek is about long. Its flow is altered by two dams, one in the forest and one on the university campus. Named tributaries of Oak Creek from source to mouth are Alder, Skunk, and Mulkey creeks and a more recent addition, Lamprey Creek, closest to the mouth. The total length of the main stem plus tributaries is about . Watershed The Oak Creek watershed covers about of which about , or 5.5 percent is paved. The university manages about 40 percent of the basin, some of it on campus near the mouth and some in the forest along the upper reaches. History Patricia Benner of the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife at Oregon State University, in a 1984 study of historic changes to Oak Creek, cited evidence of the one- time existence of three lumber mills on the upper reaches of the main stem and its tributaries and a carding mill along the lower main stem. The mills likely involved artificial dams, which blocked fish passage, and holding ponds and at least one flume, and these altered the stream flow and temperature. Along the lower reaches, there is evidence of channelization and in-fill of marshy areas. Although the stream course remains essentially the same as in the 19th century, the stream is less braided and its riparian zones less vegetated and more paved, all of which affect the fish and other organisms in the Oak Creek watershed. Flora and fauna Second-growth forest dominates the land near the headwaters. Species include shrubs, red alder, and big leaf maple near the creek and its tributaries. Douglas fir and grand fir as well as oak, madrone, and Pacific yew grow on the ridge tops and hill slopes. Bald Hill Natural Area, along Mulkey Creek, was maintained as savanna by the Kalapuya people before early settlers, the Mulkey brothers, homesteaded here in 1845 and began farming. In 2013, the Greenbelt Land Trust bought the property, which consists of forest‚Äîincluding Oregon white oak on the higher ground‚Äîmarshy savanna, braided stream channels and beaver ponds. The Trust, a conservation group concerned with the mid-Willamette Valley, is restoring damaged wildlife habitat while using the property for food production, hiking trails, and education. In the 21st century, the stream supports populations of cutthroat trout. It also provides overwintering habitat for young Chinook salmon that ascend Marys River. Deer, beaver, and an occasional bear or cougar frequent the forested headwaters. Recreation Irish Bend Covered Bridge is a pedestrian bridge that spans Oak Creek on university property. Originally a bridge over Willamette Slough near Monroe, it was moved to Oak Creek in 1989. The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Oak Creek Trail, part of the Bald Hill Farm and Bald Hill Natural Area Trail System, runs along the creek for about in northwest Corvallis. The trailhead is along Northwest Oak Creek Drive.

It was built from 1885 to 1930s. It is also known as Hof's Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Stanton House was constructed in 1885 for John Frederick Hof, who had owned the land since 1867, and replaced two timber shops on the same block. Townsville was established in 1864 by partners John Melton Black and Robert Towns and was gazetted as a port of entry in 1865. It grew quickly as a supply centre and by 1873 the port was receiving international as well as coastal traffic. Improvements were carried out to improve port facilities and to allow larger ships to anchor. By 1880 Townsville was the port for several major goldfields and had opened the first stage of the railway line westwards through Charters Towers and beyond, consolidating its importance as a port and mercantile centre. Retail business was an important part of this development. John Frederick Hof arrived in Victoria from Germany in 1856 and worked on a number of goldfields in that colony as a carrier. Moving to Queensland in 1861, he followed a variety of occupations before working again as a carrier at the Cape River diggings in North Queensland. He also took up speculative ventures in mining, acquiring a crushing plant at Georgetown in partnership with Willmett. In 1882 this was sold to the Papa Company and Hof moved to Townsville at the beginning of 1883 with a view to building a set of shops on his Flinders Street block. Recent fires had destroyed a number of buildings in Flinders Street and it was declared a first class area, where only building in stone, masonry or metal was permitted. This meant that timber buildings from the first stage of settlement were being replaced with substantial masonry ones, an encouragement to do likewise even for those whose property had escaped fire damage. Because of the subsequent building boom, labour and materials were scarce and some buildings remained at the planning stage for extended periods. Presumably in response to this, Hof set up the Brunswick Brick and Tile Works and is said to have used bricks produced by himself for \\"Hof's Buildings\\" completed in 1885. This and other buildings effected a redevelopment of the street which reflected the success of the town as a commercial centre. By 1900 there was a line of handsome and fashionable buildings down both sides of Flinders Street. Hof's new premises were 2 storeys high and comprised 3 shops with an entrance hall and stairway leading to offices on the upper floor. Leases were immediately taken out by Otto Geburek and Michael Sandstein and Philip Harris. The Beale & Co. Ltd piano and musical instrument showroom, who occupied the largest of the premises, held a special event with demonstrations of piano playing in late May to mark their opening. Willmett's printery business next door responded to a perceived need by offering sheet music for sale. A number of tenants leased space in the building for many years. The New Zealand Insurance Company's initial lease began in 1906 and they did not move out until 1935, the Mains Roads Commissioner had offices in the building throughout the 1930s and by 1944 were occupying space on the top floor extension added in the late 1930s. When this occurred the original decorated parapet was not reinstated. In 1933 the building was purchased by the Corporation of the Diocesan Synod of North Queensland, although it was already used as the Diocesan Registry. The building was named \\"Stanton House\\" in honour of George Henry Stanton who became the first Bishop of North Queensland in 1878. The Diocese sold the building in 1978. It has changed hands several times since and continues to be leased for various commercial purposes. Although renovations have taken place, the layout and functioning of the 3 original shops and offices are still discernible. At the time of heritage listing, Timezone, an amusement centre, occupied most of the ground and first floors. They no longer operate in Townsville; by May 2015, the building was vacant, boarded up at ground floor, and advertised for sale. In January 2016, the building was still being advertised for sale.  Description  Stanton House is one of a group of nineteenth century commercial buildings situated at the eastern end of Flinders Street, the major commercial street of Townsville. The building backs on to Melton Hill and the top storey does not run for the full depth of the building. The two lower storeys are of brick rendered at the front and the later section to the top is of concrete and is much plainer in form. The street elevation is asymmetrical and has two pairs of windows on one side of the entrance and stairwell and three windows on the other, indicating the position and size of the original shop space. The fenestration on both upper floors demonstrates this arrangement of space. The ground floor has modern shop fronts with aluminium framed windows sheltered by a modern cantilevered awning. The front door is flanked by glass panels and has glass transoms. The timber staircase to the first floor remains, as do most internal walls. The first floor has rounded headed windows separated by decorated pilasters and a smaller central window at the head of the staircase. The top storey has similarly spaced rectangular windows and is very plain. The parapet is severely plain and conceals the metal clad roof.  Heritage listing  Stanton House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The rapid growth of Townsville in the late 19th century occurred because of the way in which North Queensland was developed by the establishment of key ports as commercial and administrative centres. Stanton House, as a substantial masonry commercial building of the 1880s, demonstrates the prosperity of Townsville in that period when considerable redevelopment was taking place in the city centre. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Stanton House, in spite of alterations, is a good example of a commercial building of its era, being a set of substantial masonry shops with offices above. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. In form, scale and detail, Stanton House makes a major visual contribution to the streetscape of Flinders Street. It forms part of an important group of nineteenth century commercial buildings at the eastern end of the street. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As the Anglican Diocesan Registry for many years it has an association with the development of the church in North Queensland.

According to Chinese mythology, Cangjie, who had four eyes and remarkable cognizance, created Chinese characters after observing natural phenomena such as the footprints of birds and animals (Yang et al. 2008: 84-86). In Modern Standard Chinese usage, the Cangjie method of inputting characters into a computer is more common than with the ancient Cangjiepian proto-dictionary. In the name CƒÅngji√© or CƒÅng Ji√©, cƒÅng ÂÄâ/‰ªì means \\"storehouse; warehouse\\" and is sometimes written Ëíº/Ëãç \\"dark green; blue; gray; ashy\\", which is a common Chinese surname. The character È†°/È¢â is only pronounced ji√© in this name, and is usually pronounced xi√© \\"stretch the neck; fly up (of birds)\\". The piƒÅn ÁØá in Cangjiepian originally meant \\"bamboo strips used for writing (before the invention of paper)\\", which was semantically extended to \\"sheet (of paper/etc.); piece of writing; article; chapter; section; book\\". The sinologists Li Feng and David Branner (2011: 217) describe pian as \\"separate textual unit\\". The original Cangjiepian, like most Qin and Han era books, was written on bamboo and wood strips. History In the traditional history of Chinese lexicography, the first proto-dictionary primers were the Eastern Zhou dynasty Shizhoupian \\"Historian Zhou's Chapters\\", the Qin dynasty Cangjiepian, and the Han dynasty Jijiupian. The Chinese lexicographers Heming Yong and Jing Peng (2008: 34) say these texts that arranged characters into categories \\"acted as the catalyst for the birth of ancient Chinese dictionaries\\". During the Warring States period (475-221 BCE), there was a wide and confusing variety of unstandardized Large Seal Script characters, with the same word being written in several different ways. After Emperor Qin Shi Huang had conquered all other Warring States and unified China in 221 BCE, he adopted a language-reform proposal made by the Legalist Li Si and promulgated a decree of Shutongwen Êõ∏ÂêåÊñá \\"Writing the Same Character\\". It mandated using a consistent writing system based on the Small Seal Script, which was comparatively simpler and easier to write than Large Seal Script (Yong and Peng 2008: 18). In a logographic language like Chinese, correct character writing is fundamental for efficiency of information transfer. The emperor ordered his chancellor and two other ministers to compile a standard Small Seal character wordbook in three parts. The 7-chapter Cangjiepian compilation was overseen by Li Si, the 6-chapter Yuanlipian Áà∞Ê≠∑ÁØá \\"Explanation of Difficult Words\\" by Zhao Gao, and the 7-chapter Boxuepian ÂçöÂ≠∏ÁØá \\"Extensive Knowledge of Words\\" by Humu Jing ËÉ°ÊØãÊï¨ (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 197). They simplified, standardized, and disseminated a national standard script for the first time in China (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 199). These three textbooks were officially issued and circulated during the short-lived Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE) (Hayhoe 1992: 28, Greatrex 1994:101). Scholars in the early Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) combined these three Qin texts into one book, and transcribed the original Small Seal script into the standard Han Clerical script. Ban Gu's Book of Han records, > the teachers and learned people in the towns and villages combined The > Cangjie Primer, The Yuanli Primer, and The Scholarly Primer [i.e., > Boxuepian] under one cover and segmented the book into fifty-five chapters, > each chapter containing sixty characters. This new textbook retained the > original title The Cangjie Primer. (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 52) This 3,300-character Cangjiepian, commonly called the Sancang ‰∏âÂÄâ \\"Three Cangs\\", became popular and was widely recognized as the standard textbook for character learning (Yong and Peng 2008: 34-35). Scribes at the beginning of the Han were expected to be able to recite 5,000 characters, which is more than the original Cangjiepian (Feng and Branner 2011: 351). The Book of the Han (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 28) further says that about 60 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han (r. 74-49 BCE), the Cangjiepian was \\"filled with obsolete characters that are difficult for ordinary teachers to read\\". The emperor called for scholars who could pronounce them correctly, and Zhang Chang was chosen. After he died in 48 BCE, his grandson-in-law Du Lin ÊùúÊûó completed the Collections of Cangjie Exegesis (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 101), which was lost by the Sui dynasty (518-618) (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 199). The Cangjiepian had a serious pedagogical shortcoming: some Chinese characters could only be understood with the help of specialized annotations, and many came forth (Yong and Peng 2008: 35). The Han philosopher and philologist Yang Xiong (53 BCE‚Äì18 CE) first revised the Cangjiepian and wrote the Cangjiexunzuan ÂÄâÈ†°Ë®ìÁ∫Ç Collections of Cangjie Exegesis supplement, which had 5,340 characters (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 47, 81). In the reign of Emperor He of Han (88-105 CE), Jia Fang Ë≥àÈ≠¥ compiled another supplement named the Pangxipian ÊªÇÂñúÁØá. During the Jin dynasty (265-420) period, the Cangjiepian, Xunzuanpian, and Pangxipian were combined into one 3-chapter book with the title Cangjiepian, also called the Sancang. According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms (biography of Jiang Shi, tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 215), in the early Cao Wei dynasty, Zhang Yi (fl. 227-232) wrote the Picang Âü§ÂÄâ The Augmented Cangjie Glossary, Guangya The Broad Ready Guide , and Gujin zigu Âè§‰ªäÂ≠óË©Å The Exegesis of Ancient and Contemporary Characters. Guo Pu (276 ‚Äì 324) wrote a commentary to the Sancang, which is lost (Yong and Peng 2008: 34). Fan Ye's Book of the Later Han (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 101) says that when Xu Shen started compiling the Shuowen jiezi, he used ten dictionaries and primers, including the Cangjiepian (inclusive Sancang version) The Cangjie Primer, Cangjiezhuan ÂÄâÈ†°ÂÇ≥ The Biography of Cangjie, both Yang Xiong's and Du Lin's Cangjiexunzuan ÂÄâÈ†°Ë®ìÁ∫Ç Collections of Cangjie Exegesis, and the Cangjiegu ÂÄâÈ†°ÊïÖ The Exegesis of the Cangjie Primer. The Cangjiepian was continuously used until the end of the Tang Dynasty, when the last remaining copies were destroyed during the Huang Chao Rebellion (874‚Äì884). Various Qing dynasty (1644-1912) scholars partially reconstructed the text by collecting fragments quotations of the Cangjiepian in works such as the Wenxuan and Taiping Imperial Reader (Yong and Peng 2008: 27). Archeologists have discovered Cangjiepian fragments in several locations, including the Dunhuang manuscripts from the Mogao Caves in Gansu province, at Juyan Lake Basin in westernmost Inner Mongolia, and most notably at the Shuanggudui archeological site, located near Fuyang in Anhui province (Wilkinson 2000: 49). In 1977, archeologists excavated a (165 BCE) Han dynasty tomb at Shuanggudui and discovered a cache of texts written on bamboo strips, including the Yijing and Chuci. The Cangjiepian version has 541 characters, nearly 20 percent of the complete work, and is longer and more legible than the other fragments; Theobald (2011) provides pictures of these strips. The presence of the Cangjiepian in several early Han tombs shows that it was, \\"if not a common manual for elementary instruction, at least not a rare work\\" (Greatrex 1994:104). While some academics conclude that the Cangjiepian \\"demonstrated the prototype of a modern Chinese dictionary\\", Yong and Peng (2008: 28) believe this character-learning textbook's format was \\"not particularly standardized and consistent to the eye of a modern lexicographer\\". Nevertheless, they admit it is undeniable that the Cangjiepian \\"laid a solid foundation and initiated an enlightening start in character standardization, corpus construction, and source material accumulation\\". Text The excavated Han dynasty bamboo-slip Cangjiepian edition has two outstanding features in layout: rhymed 4-character phrases that are easy to recite and remember, and character collation that is semantically grouped and graphic radical-oriented (Yong and Peng 2008: 52) First, the Cangjiepian format has rhymed (in Qin period Old Chinese), 4-character phrases/sentences that are easy for children to recite and memorize. Take the Preface for example, > Cangjie creates characters [*s-ta Êõ∏] for educating the young [*s…ô.l…ô-s Âó£]. > The youth are summoned [*taw-s Ë©î] and they should learn to be serious, > cautious, respectful, and self-disciplined [*kÀ§r…ôk-s Êàí]. They should make up > their mind and study hard [*s…ô-lo≈ã-s Ë™¶] and show perseverance in reading and > reciting day and night [*tr…ôk-s ÁΩÆ]. If selected to serve as officials in the > government [*s-r…ô î Âè≤], they should be qualified in calculating, accounting, > discriminating good from evil, and ruling [*C.lr…ô Ê≤ª]. They should be trained > to be the elites [*[…°]ur Áæ§] and the exceptional but not the deviants [*…¢…ôk-s > Áï∞].) (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 53, OC reconstructions from Baxter-Sagart > 2014) The Cangjiepian adapted the prevalent style of writing Chinese poetry in 4-character lines, which dates back to the (11th-7th centuries BCE) Classic of Poetry. Later poetry was composed in 5- and 7-character lines Some Cangjiepian passages seem incongruous for a children's primer, for instance (quoted by Yan Zhitui, tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 53), \\"The Han Dynasty annexes the whole world and all the kingdoms observe its decrees. Its ruling will be like slaughtering the pigs and pulling down the fences. For those kingdoms that disobey, they will be denounced, suppressed, and destroyed\\". Second, the Cangjiepian collated characters on the basis of semantic fields (already used in the 3rd- century BCE Erya dictionary) and graphic radicals (later used in the 121 CE Shuowen Jiezi). Some sections give characters for words that are synonyms, antonyms, or otherwise semantically related. An example of words meaning \\"length\\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 55) is: c√πn ÂØ∏ \\"inch\\", b√°o ËñÑ \\"thin\\", h√≤u Âéö \\"thick\\", gu«éng Âª£ \\"wide\\", xi√° Áãπ \\"narrow\\", h«éo Â•Ω \\"good\\", ch«íu ÈÜú \\"ugly\\", ch√°ng Èï∑ \\"long\\", and du«én Áü≠ \\"short\\". Other sections give characters that share a common radical, and furthermore, the sequence of radicals generally resembles the sequence of the 540 radicals in the Shuowenjiezi. For one example (Yong and Peng 2008: 28), the \\"door radical\\" ÈñÄ (which is generally used to write words semantically related to \\"doors\\") is seen in the sequence kƒÅi Èñã \\"open\\", b√¨ Èñâ \\"close\\", m√©n ÈñÄ \\"door\\", and l«ò Èñ≠ \\"town\\" all fall under the heading of, for their meanings are all related to the concept of \\"door\\". For another, \\"sickness radical\\" Áñí (seen in many characters denoting \\"illness; sickness\\") is seen in all but one of the series b√¨ng ÁóÖ \\"illness\\", ku√°ng ÁãÇ (with the \\"dog radical\\" Áä≠) \\"madness\\", cƒ´ Áñµ \\"blemish\\", gƒÅng Áñï \\"head sores\\", ch√®n Áñ¢ \\"fever\\", and y√°ng Áòç \\"sore\\". In addition, some Cangjiepian passages explain semantic extensions and polysemy, such as \\"\\"Êé™ means ÁΩÆ \\"to handle\\", also ÂÆâ \\"arrange\\", and also ÊñΩ \\"implement\\"\\" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 149). The original Cangjiepian did not have explanatory notes for difficult characters and words, but some received editions have interpretations and glosses added to characters, which are obviously accretions from scholars of later periods (Yong and Peng 2008: 28). The Tang Dynasty dictionary by Xuan Ying (ÁéÑÊáâ), the Yiqie jing yinyi \\"Pronunciation and Meaning in the Tripitaka\\" quotes the Cangjiepian (Yong and Peng 2008: 54) to say, ÁóèÂâµ‰πü Èü≥Â¶ÇÈÆ™È≠ö‰πãÈÆ™, \\"Wƒõi Áóè [also pronounced y√°ng or y√≤u] means chu√†ng Ââµ \\"wound\\", and is pronounced like the fish wƒõi ÈÆ™ \\"sturgeon\\".\\" References *Feng, Li and David Prager Branner (2011), Writing & Literacy in Early China, University of Washington Press. *Greatrex, Roger (1994), \\"An Early Western Han Synonymicon: The Fuyang Copy of the Cang Jie pian\\", in Outstretched Leaves on his Bamboo Staff: Essays in Honour of G√∂ran Malmqvist on his 70th Birthday, ed. by Joakim Enwall, Association of Oriental Studies, 97‚Äì113. *Hayhoe, Ruth (1992), Education and Modernization: The Chinese Experience, Pergamon Press. *Needham, Joseph, Lu Gwei-djen, and Huang Hsing-Tsung (1986), Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 6 Biology and Biological Technology, Part 1: Botany, Cambridge University Press. *Theobald, Ulrich (2011), Cangjiepian ÂÄâÈ†°ÁØá, Chinaknowledge *Wilkinson, Endymion (2000), Chinese History: A Manual, revised and enlarged, Harvard University Asia Center. *Yang, Lihui, Deming An, and Jessica Anderson Turner (2008), Handbook of Chinese Mythology, Oxford University Press. *Yong, Heming and Jing Peng (2008), Chinese Lexicography: A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911, Oxford University Press.

She had a PhD in insect physiology from the University of Cambridge and was a member of the Royal Entomological Society of London. Early life Marks was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1918, and was known by the name Pat or Patricia for the Cathedral she was christened in (St Patrick's Cathedral). Her father, Ted (Edward Oswald) Marks, born in Brisbane in 1882, was a geologist and inventor (later an ophthalmologist) from a family of doctors. Ted Marks, travelled to Ireland twice to undertake his studies because of the absence of a university in Queensland. He left for Ireland in 1913 to conduct his medical studies and married Nesta Drury, also of Brisbane, in 1914. Their daughter Pat was born following his service in WW1 An only child, Pat Marks and her family returned to Australia in 1920, residing in Wickham Terrace, Brisbane for over 60 years alongside a large extended family. After attending St John's Cathedral School in Brisbane and the Glennie Memorial School in Toowoomba as a boarder, where she left as Dux of the school in 1934, she enrolled in the University of Queensland. She was interested in becoming a veterinarian, but her father encouraged her to pursue entomology. The Marks family had a strong interest in the natural sciences and the importance of science serving the community. Marks excelled at swimming at school, was an accomplished horsewoman, getting her first horse at age 5, and participated in hockey at UQ. She also swam later for Cambridge. Weekends were spent at her grandfather's farm at Camp Mountain near Samford, where the family ran horses. Marks graduated from UQ with a B.Sc. in 1938, principally studying zoology, and gained her Honours (second class) degree in the parasitology of marsupial animals in 1939. She would earn a M.Sc. in 1940, studying under supervisor, Dr Ronald Hamlyn- Harris. Dr Hamlyn-Harris was Brisbane's then leading entomologist studying the biological control of mosquitoes.  Early career  In 1939, Marks began work as Assistant Curator of the Pathology Museum in the newly established University of Queensland Medical School. However she balanced her interests in medicine and entomology by tutoring medical students who were taking classes with her former lecturer, F. Athol Perkins. Marks became a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of Queensland in 1943, working for the Department of Entomology and Mosquito Control Committee (MCC). Due to the outbreak of WW2 and the movement of Australian troops into New Guinea where high levels of malaria existed, mosquito control became a significant issue. Casualties from malaria outstripped war related casualties Outbreaks of Dengue Fever affected both Brisbane and Cairns. Marks was brought in to assist F. Athol Perkins in providing material for the Army to use in their Malaria training schools. Marks continued to work to identify Queensland mosquitoes and research their taxonomy and breeding biology, so that adequate measures could be applied to control the risk of disease carried by them. She identified the breeding behaviour of many mosquitoes including Aedes culiciformis. She would also be tasked with going into areas with unexpectedly large numbers of mosquitoes. Her work for the Health department's eradication program of Aedes aegypti led to this mosquito's disappearance in the Brisbane area where it had caused Dengue Fever outbreaks. In 1955, two entomologists who had worked in the South Pacific during World War II, Willard V. King and Harry Hoogstraal, named a mosquito they collected at Hollandia, Netherlands New Guinea, in 1945, Culex marksae to honor her; the corethrellid midge Corethrella marksae is also named in her honor. Study in Europe Marks worked for both the Queensland Health department and UQ until 1949 when she took leave to visit Europe. She visited Amsterdam, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the British Museum of Natural History (now Natural History Museum). Marks continued her research while overseas, completing her PhD in insect physiology at the University of Cambridge, Newnham College. She joined the Royal Entomological Society of London while at Cambridge. Later research She returned to Australia in 1951 where she undertook fieldwork for Dr Bill Reeves in Mildura, Victoria and in Townsville in 1952, exploring outbreaks of Murray Valley encephalitis. Another member of this team was Dr Josephine Mackerras, who Marks would work with on many occasions. She would travel to the Torres Strait Islands on research expeditions for the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR). In 1954, Marks made a significant collection of marine insects off Low Isles Reef of far North Queensland. Other members of the expedition included Dr Mackerras, Isobel Bennett and Dorothy Hill. Marks discovered a tiny marine insect on the reef near Heron Island, where a UQ research station was being established. It was named Corallocoris marksae in recognition of her discovery. From 1951‚Äì1973 she managed a number of projects including a study of the insects used by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Wildlife Survey Section for the introduction of myxomatosis in rabbits. This included collecting specimens in rural Australia and the Torres Strait Islands. She also trained many of Queensland‚Äôs health inspectors. In 1958, Marks travelled to New Guinea for three months with funding from the Bishop Museum of Hawaii, and travelled to a remote region near the Mamberamo River. She would make later expeditions to New Guinea in 1959, 1961, 1966 and 1979. Marks transferred to the QIMR when the Mosquito Control Committee was disbanded in 1973, working as the Principal Entomologist. However QIMR had no room for her until 1976, so she remained at UQ during that time. Retirement activities Marks retired in 1983 but continued to work at QIMR, and transferred her research energies to history, specifically of science, scientists and their professional societies. She also researched local and Queensland history, attending Brisbane History Group meetings and functions. After she inherited part of her family's farm at Camp Mountain near Samford, she joined the Samford Historical Society. She researched and championed protection of the Samford Bora rings (indigenous ceremonial sites) in the 1970s. Marks retired to Samford in 1982, raising and riding horses until she was 80. In 1973, a new Regulation 13A of the Australian Federal Customs Act 1901‚Äì1971 was added, which thwarted efforts of major researchers to exchange biological specimens between museums and researchers overseas for research or to obtain specimens for permanent collection in overseas museums. Marks and many other entomologists fought this regulation speaking to government officials, politicians and working with the Australian Academy of Science. The matter would drag on for ten years, before the regulation would disappear from the Act. Awards and memberships Marks was a member of sixteen societies including the Entomological Society of Queensland, Australian Entomological Society and President of the Royal Society of Queensland in 1959. She was a long time member of the Queensland Naturalists Club (1937‚Äì2002) having been involved with them in her youth through camps and was their President in 1952. She was a long time member of the Australian Conservation Foundation. She edited the Fraser Island issue of the journal Queensland Naturalist. She wrote entries for the Australian Dictionary of Biography on early naturalists, and gave addresses to many to meetings and seminars. In 1981, she received the Australian Natural History Award of the field Naturalists Club of Victoria. In 1986, she shared the Belkin Award from the American Mosquito Association for excellence in systematics. In 1990 she was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for her services to science, and in particular to entomology. Elizabeth Nesta Marks died in 2002. Writings Marks, Elizabeth N. Studies of Queensland Mosquitoes. Brisbane: University of Queensland Press, 1947. Other major publications included the Atlas of Common Queensland Mosquitoes (1966) and the 12-volume set The Culicidae of Australasia (1980‚Äì1989). She published Insects of Australia, a history of Australian entomology in 1991. In 2004, she co-wrote a memoir with Kathleen Cummins, Mosquitoes and Memories: Recollections of 'Patricia' Marks.  Legacy  Elizabeth Marks alone or jointly described 38 new mosquito species (for example, Culiseta arenivaga Marks, 1968), as well as new species of fruit flies, bugs, cockroaches and ticks. Another 43 species of mosquito identified by her, have yet to be described satisfactorily. She was well known for her practical streak, being able to solve problems with inventive solutions. She was equally famous for her Army metal soup ladle which was used to collect mosquito larvae and as an oar when an outboard motor might break down. Geoff Monteith of the Queensland Museum described her as \\"a woman of imposing presence and strong personality, with a sense of obligation to her science and the community in a broader context\\". She wrote her autobiography with Kathleen Cummins, entitled ‚Äì Mosquitoes and Memories: Recollections of ‚ÄòPatricia‚Äô Marks. This was published posthumously in 2004. Over 70 boxes of her papers were donated to the University of Queensland Library upon her death. Many items relating to the social history of Queensland including furniture and cars were donated by Pat Marks and her extended family to the Queensland Museum, John Oxley Library at the State Library of Queensland, the Samford Museum and Queensland Art Gallery. The E.N. Marks' insect collection was donated to the University of Queensland. The Marks family farm was sold off, but the old cottage now exists at the Queensland University of Technology‚Äôs Samford Ecological Research Facility (SERF).

By 1846, Knox Grove was a settlement of roughly 14 families covering an area of . The following year, the first schoolhouse was started out of the (now abandoned) home of Mr. Knox. In 1848, an American black bear weighing was reported as being killed by a group of men in the northern reach of the grove. That same year, a post office opened under the name of Ovid. By 1855, the Illinois Central Railroad's choice of routing led to the creation of the nearby town of Sublette, where the majority of the population of Knox Grove shortly relocated. Ecology Bartlett Woods lies in a flat depression between the Theiss and LaMoille moraines which were deposited during Pleistocene glaciation. Within the woods, several shallow ravines drain excess water from the mesic upland forest into Bureau Creek. The most common tree species are sugar maple, red and white oak, red elm and basswood. To a lesser extent, black walnut, butternut and hophornbeam can be found in certain areas of the preserve. The herbaceous layer contains regionally common wildflowers such as doll's eyes, columbine, trout lily and miterwort.

In the game, the player takes the role of the editor of a newspaper torn between personal opposition to the government and threats to the lives of the editor's wife and children if the editor does not generate loyalty among the population. Originally created as a warm up for a Ludum Dare game jam, The Republia Times was nominated in two categories in the Games for Change Awards.

The player determines which stories are included in each day's issue of the Times, and how much prominence each story receives. The player has to balance publishing pro-government stories to convince a skeptical public to support the oppressive government, while also publishing popular gossip stories to increase readership.

It was built from 1897 to 1898. It is also known as Jubilee Hall and Parish Room. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Synod Hall was opened during the first week of January 1898. Townsville was founded in November 1864. Although it is not known when the first Church of England services were held in the township it is known that the first services were conducted in the Court House, which was built by March 1866. These services were conducted by local lay preachers or itinerant ministers. In February 1866 Rev Mr Searle, visiting minister from Bowen, requested the appointment of an incumbent to the parish of Townsville with Rev James Adams accepting the position by mid 1866. On 24 December 1872 land for a church was purchased on Melton Hill by trustees James Gordon, Frederick Walker and William Aplin. In February, 1884 control of the land passed to the Corporation of the Diocesan Synod of North Queensland. On 18 November 1887 tenders were called for the construction of a \\"Parish Room\\", to be built to a design prepared by Townsville architectural firm Eyre and Munro. The building does not appear to have been constructed at that time because the Mayor and Alderman of the Townsville Town Council received a letter, dated Thursday 30 December 1897, from St James Parochial Council inviting them to the official opening of the Jubilee Hall on the following Wednesday 5 January 1898. The new hall, constructed in 1897, the Diamond Jubilee Year of Queen Victoria, was given the name Jubilee Hall. 1887, the year tenders were first called for a \\"Parish Room\\", was the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The 1897 hall may have been constructed to a design by Townsville architect Walter Morris Eyre, a member of the Cathedral Committee and supervising architect for the Sydney firm of Blacket and Sons, designers of St James Cathedral. Eyre took over the supervision of the construction of the Cathedral after the Diocese dispensed with the services of Arthur Blacket on 5 March 1890. By 1897, Eyre who was no longer in partnership with Munro, was practicing as an architect, civil engineer and building inspector. He was also still on the Cathedral Committee and it seems probable that he designed the Jubilee Hall. After it was constructed the hall became a focus for parish and diocesan activities including the gathering of the Ninth Synod of the Anglican Diocese of North Queensland who met in 1898 soon after the building was opened. The name was later changed to Synod Hall, probably because the Synod of the Anglican Diocese of North Queensland continued to hold their meetings in the building. In 1899 Miss Florence Buchanan of Thursday Island, was invited by Bishop Christopher Barlow to work among Chinese and Japanese children in Townsville. A Japanese school was opened in Synod Hall by Miss Buchanan and a school for Chinese children was opened in the Mission Hall, constructed below Synod Hall. The Japanese school continued at least until 1902 when Miss Buchanan returned to Thursday Island. The mission hall was destroyed in Cyclone Leonta in 1902 and does not appear to have been rebuilt. At one time the Anglican High School for Girls (later St Ann's School) held classes in the hall and in 1903, while repairs were being carried out after St James Cathedral was damaged during Cyclone Leonta, Synod Hall was used for church services. Several early photographs show the Synod Hall from the early 1900s. The land between the hall and the cathedral was level, with access to the hall via a driveway rising up between the buildings. The north- western verandah has changed little, but there was a handrail between the posts with blinds behind. The south-eastern verandah was similar to the other, being open at the front with some infill panels of boarding between posts towards the rear. This confirms that the present Green Room was a later addition, perhaps between the wars. At the front is a decorative fretwork panel above the gable tie. On the flat land between the two buildings, photographs from the inter-war period show a structure which appears to be a tennis court. The hall, used as a parish centre for one hundred years, lost this central role after a new parish building was constructed on a nearby site in the 1980s. In keeping with its past role as a social and administrative centre, the building was leased to the Townsville Little Theatre in October 1994 and was used as a rehearsal studio, performance venue and headquarters for the theatre company. In December 1998, the Townsville Little Theatre moved to other premises.  Description  Synod Hall is nestled into the south-western side of Melton Hill, which separates Townsville's central business district from Cleveland Bay, and is part of the foothills to the east of Castle Hill. The hall is sited to the east of St James Cathedral on a small terrace, with thicket behind and the stony hillside falling away from the front of the building. The principle facade overlooks the city centre to the south, and is prominent from Denham Street, a major thoroughfare. The hall is a rectangular timber building on a near north-south axis, with verandahs along both sides. The gabled roof is painted corrugated iron, with a gabled ridge vent running most of its length, and a lean-to roof to each verandah. At each end of the ridge is a finial-like timber cross. The building is set close to ground level on a concrete slab, with the timber framing mounted on hobs. The walls are lined with chamferboards and the timber framing exposed externally. Above the windows and within the gables the walls are sheeted with chamferboards externally also. The southern facade facing the city has three tall narrow openings, symmetrically arranged. The outer two are a pair of timber louvre shutters, with corrugated iron hoods over. The central opening has similar shutters and a fixed panel of louvres above, plus a more ornate gabled hood. The building is approached from the elevated carpark to the west. The western verandah is open, apart from a small store to the rear also of exposed framing. The verandah is framed in stop-chamfered posts and rafters. Opening onto the verandah are two substantial sliding doors clad in beaded boards, with panels of open timber battening above. Other doors are also boarded. The eastern verandah is enclosed as a kitchen, clad with external chamferboards and glass louvres, and lined with fibrous cement sheet. Towards the rear, the Green Room projects past the line of the verandah, and is clad in chamferboards with panels of fixed timber louvres. The internal walls of the hall are the beaded face of the horizontal cladding boards. There is a timber floor to the hall, and a timber stage to the northern end. The ceiling is divided into six bays by curved and moulded timber brackets, joined by tie rods across the room. A pressed metal ceiling rose is centred within each bay. The ceiling also is lined with beaded boards, running diagonally where the ceiling rakes up to the collar tie. Behind the stage are two windows of adjustable timber louvres, trimmed with moulded architraves and with triangular pediments over.  Heritage listing  Synod Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Synod Hall demonstrates the early development of Townsville and the growth of the Anglican Church in North Queensland. It housed the meetings of the Synod, church services during repairs to the Cathedral, school classes and social and community functions. It is one of a group of buildings, including St James Cathedral, which still form the focus of the Anglican Church in Townsville. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Built in 1897, it is one of few surviving examples of a timber public building constructed with an exposed timber frame, a technique important in the development of North Queensland. It is also one of few surviving timber public buildings in Townsville from that period. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Its design demonstrates a response to the tropical climate with the use of a substantial roof vent, side verandahs and sliding doors, and timber shutters and window hoods. These hoods, shutters and other ornamentation of the primary facade combine to form a composition of architectural competence. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The hall, whilst not imposing, is a landmark on the city side of Melton Hill. It overlooks the Central Business District of Townsville, and is readily appreciated from Denham Street, a major thoroughfare. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The hall has had a long association with the Anglican community, functioning as a parish centre for almost a century.

Its end objective was the capture of the forward fighter base at Muang Soui on the Plain of Jars. Although it succeeded in taking the air base, it failed to remove a concentration of Communist troops at the Sala Phou Khoun intersection of Routes 7 and 13. Overview The French loss of the First Indochina War led to the establishment of the independent Kingdom of Laos by the 1954 Geneva Agreements. While Laotian neutrality called for a ban on foreign military forces save for a French advisory mission. However, North Vietnamese troops had settled in northeastern Laos to support a Lao communist insurrection. The Laotian Civil War was the result.Castle, pp. 7‚Äì12, 15‚Äì18.Dommen, pp. 30‚Äì34. Background Although the administrative capital of Vientiane had suffered through the Battle of Vientiane and several subsequent coups,Conboy, Morrison, pp. 107, 123-125, 156-158. there had been only one early military operation in Military Region 5Operation Triangle in July 1964.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 110-112.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 118-125. However, beginning 5 August 1971, there would be another.Conboy, Morrison, p. 302. Phou Khao Khouai The new offensive, code named Phou Khao Khouai (\\"White Buffalo Mountain\\") began at Moung Kassy on Route 13 on 5 August 1971, on the sole road between Vientiane and Luang Prabang. Two Royalist battalions, Bataillon Commando 206 (BC 206), and Bataillon Infanterie 6 (BI 6) were detailed for the attack, along with a commando company from the Military Region 5 Commandos. Their objective was a highway sweep north on Route 13, leading to capture of the forward fighter base at Muang Soui on the branching Route 7. Moving north from Moung Kassy on 5 August 1971, the Royalist column crept through the rain for the following fortnight, meeting only sporadic Communist opposition. It came to a halt against the defended Routes 7/13 intersection at Sala Phou Khoun. Unable to force entry into the mouth of Route 7, the Royalist column veered off Route 13 to parallel Route 7 to its south. The flanking movement penetrated 15 kilometers before being balked by a Pathet Lao battalion. Phou Khao Khouai stalled there for about a month, until mid- September. Phou Khao Kham The stalled offensive force was removed from the ridge where it had encamped, and leapfrogged over the foe to be landed at a vacant Auto Defense de Choc (ADC) site, Xieng Dat. They were refurbished for three days in preparation of a heliborne assault on Muang Soui; in the process, the operation was renamed Phou Khao Kham (meaning Gold Mountain). On 24 September 1971, 62 Commando Raiders from Military Region 2 (MR 2) were picked up by two 21st Special Operations Squadron (21st SOS) helicopters. The Raiders were inserted in locations six kilometers both southwest and southeast of Muang Soui. Covered by U.S. A-1 Skyraiders, the Raiders moved from the hills into town. By dark, they had occupied it. Early 25 September, six copters from the 21st SOS began lifting soldiers from BI 6 onto Muang Soui's runway. They landed under an umbrella of both U.S. and Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) tactical air power. Both RLAF and Air America helicopters carried in BC 206 and the commando company. By noon, sporadic Communist mortar and light machine gun fire died off as they retreated northwards. Result The Royal Lao Government recaptured and held the forward tactical aircraft base at Muang Soui.

After graduating from the Warren Academy and from Amherst, he entered Harvard Law School. However, he soon dropped law school, entering Andover Theological Seminary where he graduated in 1853. The next year he was ordained as a congregational minister. Throughout most of the rest of his life he served at various churches throughout Massachusetts. In 1861, he built his own greenhouse to study botany. He predominantly worked as a field botanist in the Eastern states. In 1888, he retired from the ministry to focus on botany full-time. That same year, he traveled to South America to collect and study specimen. In 1890, he returned home with 20,000 specimen of plants, as well as field notes. Soon after the return from his excursion, he was named curator of the herbarium at Columbia University in New York City. Additionally, he taught classes on botany throughout the area. He died at his son's house in 1894 in Boston, Massachusetts. He was a member of the Torrey Botanical Society. Selected publications * New species of Potamogeton with Notes upon some published Forms.

Early life and high school Bird grew up in Corbin, Kentucky and played football and basketball and ran track at Corbin High School. He was one of four brothers, all of whom played sports at Corbin and later in college. In football, he led his team to the state championship as a junior and was selected All-State as a junior and senior. He also set the state scoring record his junior year and the national scoring record his senior year, the latter in which he scored 264 points. In basketball, he averaged 32 points per game as a senior. The school later retired his No. 66 football jersey. College Bird attended the University of Kentucky and played football for head coach Blanton Collier. He played five positions for the Wildcats, including halfback, kick returner, wide receiver, and defensive back. He was chosen as Southeastern Conference (SEC) Sophomore of the Year in 1958 after leading the conference in receptions and receiving yards. He was a second-team All-SEC selection in 1959 and a first-team All-SEC selection as a senior in 1960. Bird led Kentucky in receiving and all-purpose yards in each of his three seasons playing for the team. His proudest achievement was beating Tennessee all three seasons. In 1958 and 1959 he scored every point Kentucky made against Tennessee. He played in three all-star games following his senior season and was the most valuable player of the All-American All-Star Game. In 1997 his No. 21 jersey was retired by Kentucky. In 2005, he was elected as a charter member into the University of Kentucky Athletics Hall of Fame. Pro football and later life Bird was drafted in 1961 by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League and the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League, though he did not play for either team.

The text is from a set of poems by the German poet Friedrich R√ºckert (1788‚Äì1866). It is the third poem in a set of four. This song is set for solo voice and piano.  Description and analysis  R√ºckert's poem was originally untitled. Schubert used the poem's first line as the title of the song. R√ºckert later titled his poem \\"\\" (Stay with me). Franz Liszt transcribed many of Schubert's songs for piano, including \\"\\" (S. 558/3). The melody and harmonies are all Schubert's but with the addition of Liszt's own interpretation, while still staying true to the original meaning of R√ºckert's poem. The piece is in triple meter () and is marked larghetto (fairly slow) and pianissimo (very soft). The piece is in bar form and its original key is E-flat major. It starts with both hands playing broken triads softly and slowly in treble clef. The simplicity of the melody makes this piece that much more difficult to sing as it requires perfect legato and breath control. Any inconsistencies in the sound can disrupt the 'peace' of the poem. Schubert sets tender and gentle themes to R√ºckert's words, and the simplicity of the piano line further enhances the meaning of the song. The progression of the harmonies repeat with the bar form, always establishing the key of the piece. With a pianissimo and larghetto marking and the piano part light in texture, Schubert sets up the poem for the first few lines, \\"You are peace, the mild peace,\\" in the introduction. The piece has five verses. The first and second verses are almost exactly identical to the third and fourth, with the exception of one note. The fifth (and final) verse is the start of the B section (\\"\\"). Both the piano and the voice have a marking of pianissimo up until measure 57, when there is finally a crescendo. This is in the first few bars of the B section. In measure 59, Schubert marks forte. Here is the climax as well as the highest note of the piece along with a decrescendo. There is then a bar of rest and Schubert marks the next entrance at pianissimo once again. Perhaps this is to reinforce the mood of the song. \\"What could be more restful than silence?\\" Schubert repeats this text, thereby creating a sixth verse. He then ends the vocal line on the dominant (B-flat), which leaves the piano to resolve the harmony. Throughout the piece, Schubert sets words like \\"pleasure\\" on the tonic, and words like \\"pain\\" on the dominant harmonies.  Text  Sheet music with original and translated into Ukrainian lyrics Other settings \\"Du bist die Ruh\\" was also set to music by Fanny Mendelssohn in her Opus 7 in 1839.

Programs The most popular majors include psychology, economics, sociology, digital communications arts, anthropology, liberal studies, political science, history and English. History Oregon State University first offered studies in liberal arts in 1868. According to the College of Liberal Arts website, students began showing greater interest in sciences and technology by the early 1900s. The trend forced administrators to de-emphasize liberal arts as a major over the subsequent four decades. By World War II, courses in liberal arts began to grow in popularity again and Oregon State University President A.L. Strand created the first divisional majors in humanities and social sciences at the university in 1959. The university later added the School of Humanities and Social Sciences in 1961 and continued to expand liberal arts studies throughout the 1960s. In 1973, the school became formalized as the College of Liberal Arts. Early departments included the Humanities, Social Sciences and the Fine and Performing Arts.

His father William Edward New (1875‚Äì1968) was Scots-Irish, and his mother, Josephine Colston New (1875‚Äì1955), was full blooded Cherokee. New was the youngest of ten children. He earned Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Art Education from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). After graduating, he taught painting at the Phoenix Indian School in Arizona, and then enlisted in the US Navy in 1941.\\"Lloyd Kiva New: Art, Design, & Influence.\\" Museum of Contemporary Native Arts. 2016. Accessed 10 February 2016. Fashion design New moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, where in 1945 he opened a fashion boutique in the Arizona Craftsmen Court in Scottsdale, Arizona. His label, named Kiva, first focused on leather purses, belts, and hats. In 1948, he expanded to a full clothing line. He collaborated with major Native American artists, including Manfred Susunkewa (Hopi), Charles Loloma (Hopi), and Andrew Van Tsinhajinnie (Navajo). His boutique flourished through the 1940s and 1950s. When Miss Arizona Lynn Freyse competed for Miss America in 1957, she wore a Kiva New-designed dress. Kiva designs sold to Neiman- Marcus. Institute of American Indian Arts Initially, New envisioned a \\"design laboratory\\" that taught young Native American students how to make a living through their arts. This evolved into the Institute of American Indian Arts, which New co-founded with Dr. George Boyce and opened in Santa Fe in 1962. The school, initially a high school and then later a college, was funded by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. New served as the inaugural art director and later president of the school. The purpose of the school was to provide an education which fostered pride in students' indigenous heritage and featured the development of skills designed to improve their economic opportunities.

ABC Classic FM In 2003 he was appointed Artistic Associate at Sydney Theatre Company (STC); in 2007 he became Associate Director. He left the company in 2012. In 2016 he joined Belvoir as an Artistic Associate. Career Wright began as an actor, joining Jean-Pierre Mignon's Australian Nouveau Theatre (Anthill) in late 1991. In 1992 he resumed working with Barrie Kosky (who had directed him in student productions at Melbourne University) as a member of Gilgul, a Melbourne company exploring Jewish cultural identity. He acted in their productions of The Dybbuk (1992), Es Brent (1993), The Wilderness Room (1995) and The Operated Jew (1996). He began writing for the theatre in the late 1990s, although he continued performing into the early 2000s. This Is a True Story, a monologue dealing with a death row case, which he wrote and performed, had multiple seasons and later toured to Sydney and London. Lorilei: A Meditation on Loss, based on another death row case, and performed by Anna Galvin, played in Melbourne, Sydney, Edinburgh, London and Vancouver in 2003, and has since gone on to be performed in other nations such as Belgium and Pakistan. The BBC Radio 4 radio version of Lorilei won the Gold Prize for Drama at the Radio Academy Awards in 2007. In 2006 he again resumed working with Kosky, writing The Lost Echo, an eight-hour adaptation of Ovid's Metamorphoses. At the 2007 Helpmann Awards this production won five awards, including Best Play and Best New Australian work. Wright's adaptation of The Women of Troy was awarded Best Mainstage Production at the 2008 Sydney Theatre Awards. In 2009 his co-adaptation of Shakespeare's history plays, performed under the title The War of the Roses, was directed by Benedict Andrews for Sydney Theatre Company. This production collected four Helpmanns in 2009, including Best Play, and was listed as the theatre masterpiece of the decade by The Monthly in October 2011. Wright's 2012 play On The Misconception of Oedipus played at Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne and Perth Theatre Company, under the direction of Matthew Lutton. It won four Green Room Awards that year including Best Writing.

The work was commissioned by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and was first performed on April 23, 2015 by the soprano Jessica Rivera, mezzo-soprano Kelley O'Connor, tenor Thomas Cooley, baritone Nmon Ford, bass Evan Boyer, the actors Steven Cole and Shannon Eubanks, and the Atlanta Symphony Chorus and Orchestra under the conductor Robert Spano. Composition Creation/Creator has a duration of 81 minutes and is composed in 15 movements: #Elephant in the Dark #God-Tapestry #Pan Gu and the Egg-Shaped Cloud #An Unknown Woman #Poets of Science #Laboratories of the Universe #In the Eternal #This Dream, Strange and Moving #Two Girls #Ms. Margaret Cavendish #Between Green Thread and Broccoli #The Creation #An Angel in the Marble #The Music it Makes #All Things Bound in a Single Book The music combines elements rock and roll, world music, and classical music. The text of the piece is drawn from various sources, including the legend of Pangu from Chinese mythology and the works of the American author James Weldon Johnson. =Instrumentation= The work calls for soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor, baritone, bass solos, actor, actress, mixed choir, and an orchestra of two flutes (second doubling piccolo), two oboes (second doubling cor anglais), three clarinets (second doubling alto saxophone, third doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons (second doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, harp, electric guitar, electric bass, synthesizer, timpani, percussion, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere performance, Mark Gresham of ArtsATL highly praised the piece, writing, \\"Theofanidis may well have himself a landmark work in Creation/Creator. It is only superficially akin to Haydn's Creation in theme as an oratorio. While Haydn's work dealt with human creativity only as a subtext to the Biblical creation story, it is central to Theofanidis' oratorio. If considered only from a point of the composer's choices of texts alone, it is a work that will spark the interest of contemporary audiences.\\" References Category:Compositions by Christopher Theofanidis Category:2015 compositions Category:Oratorios Category:Music commissioned by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Creation/Creator"},{"id":"49392564","text":"Charlot Salwai Tabimasmas (born 24 April 1963)\\"Hon.

FS406-22 is an archaea in the genus Methanocaldococcus. It is an anaerobic, piezophilic, diazotrophic, hyperthermophilic marine archaeon. This strain is notable for fixing nitrogen at the highest known temperature of nitrogen fixers recorded to date. The 16S rRNA gene of Methanocaldococcus sp. FS406-22, is almost 100% similar to that of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, a non-nitrogen fixer.  Discovery and isolation  Methanocaldococcus sp. FS406-22 was isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent fluid. Hydrothermal vents are located on the ocean floor where plates are moving tectonically apart, for example volcano sites and by mid ocean ridges. These mid ocean ridges provide a large supply of food for aquatic marine animals. The particular vent that strain FS406-22 was isolated from, is located on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the Pacific Ocean near volcanic activity. Mausmi P. Mehta and John A. Baross isolated strain FS406-22 in September 2004 during the New Millennum Observatory cruise. The Thomas G. Thompson vessel made this cruise possible and journeyed off to the Axial Volcano. A remotely operated vehicle (ROPOS) sampled vent fluid from marker 113 using a hydrothermal fluid and particle sampler (HFPS). Marker 113 is a vent located at 1525 meters deep in the southeast corner of the caldera. This vent was active before the last eruption of Axial Volcano in January 1998.  Characteristics  = Ecology = Methanocaldococcus sp. FS406-22 is a deep sea marine Archean. It is a hyperthermophilic methanogen that fixes nitrogen. Strain FS405-22 grows at an optimal temperature of 92 ¬∞C, allowing it to thrive near volcanoes. Strain FS406-22 prefers to inhabit specifically hydrothermal vents on the deep sea floor. Lastly, this marine archaean does not sporulate. = Morphology = This particular strain of Methanocaldococcus is cocci in shape. FS406-22 is gram negative and is not pathogenic to humans. Strain FS406-22 is a free-living marine archaean and motile via flagella.  Physiology and metabolism  Methanocaldococcus sp. FS406-22 is an anaerobic marine archaean that is able to fix nitrogen at extreme depths. Being a hyperthermophilic extremophile, it lives in an extremely hot environment for example, a hydrothermal vent, which can range anywhere from 75 ¬∞C to 110 ¬∞C.\\"Complete sequence of chromosome of Methanocaldococcus sp.

FS406-22 is a hyperthermophilic nitrogen fixing archaea and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii DSM 2661 is unable to fix nitrogen. Other related species and strains of Methanocaldococcus that reside in the same Order include: Methanococcus aeolicus, Methanocaldococcus fervens, Methanotorris igneus, Methanocaldococcus infernus, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanothermococcus okinawensis, Methanococcus vannielii, Methanococcus voltae, and Methanocaldococcus vulcanius.  Significance  Methanocaldococcus sp. FS406-22 is significant due to its ability to fix nitrogen and reduce it from N2 to NH3 in an optimum temperature of 92 ¬∞C. This is an extremely important discovery to the scientific community as this optimum Nitrogen reduction in 92 ¬∞C is a total of 28 ¬∞C higher than the previously recorded nitrogen reduction of the methanogen, Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus. Before the discovery of Methanocaldococcus sp. FS406-22, Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus was the most thermophilic microorganism, fixing nitrogen at 64 ¬∞C. This particular discovery has potential to reveal a much wider range of conditions for life not only, in the seafloor biosphere but also, other ecosystems that are nitrogen deficient. Looking further into this methanogen, it was found that the 16S rRNA gene of Methanocaldococcus sp. FS406-22, is 99% similar to that of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii DSM 2661. This odd 1% divergence between FS406-22 and M. jannaschii is due to a previous separation of ancestral genes. The revelation of a hyperthermophilic, diazotrophic, archaea (strain FS406-22) may be due to the evolutionary history of nitrogenous. The phylogenetic analysis of nitrogenous and chlorophyll iron proteins suggests that an ancestral iron protein duplicated and diverged into nifH and anfH genes. This divergence of genes is estimated to have happened before the separation of the Domains bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Strain FS406-22 contains a functional nifH gene which is able to encode dinitrogenase reductase whereas M. jannaschii does not possess this gene, explaining the 1% divergence between the two species.

Nima created and leads the category of consumer food testers. The first product, a gluten sensor was released in for general availability in February 2017. The second product, a peanut sensor was released for general availability in September of 2018. Nima caters to the millions of people who have food sensitivities and food allergies, and require additional data before making a decision at mealtime. The company's mission to enables people to be their healthiest selves by giving them the power to know what‚Äôs in their food. The founders of Nima met at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and have severe food sensitivities and family members with extreme food allergies. They were personally motivated to find a solution to help improve the chances of staying healthy and social when eating outside of the home for themselves, their families and the millions of people who are actively avoiding certain foods to stay healthy. Nima was born out of MIT in 2013. Nima was acquired by an unknown company in 2020. Whether by decision or Covid19 impact, testing capsules for the testing unit have become unavailable for purchase on Amazon, the distributor of testers and capsules since 2019. Testers are still available to purchase but do not include testing capsules.  How to use Nima  A food sample is placed in a one-time use capsule, which is inserted into the Nima sensor. Once the test begins, the food is mixed with proprietary antibodies and analyzed by the sensor in under 5 minutes. Nima delivers a binary result for the sample tested for gluten and peanut. The gluten sensor is tuned to 20 parts per million for gluten and 10 parts per million for peanut. If the sample contains 20ppm or more of gluten, Nima is designed to deliver a gluten found indication, to indicate gluten was found. If the sample contained 10ppm or more of peanut, Nima is designed to deliver a peanut found for the sample. If there is no detectable gluten or peanut, Nima will display a smiley face to indicate that there was no detectable target protein in the sampled food. The device has not been approved by the FDA, and the developers contest that such approval is not necessary because they \\"are not using it to diagnose or manage disease.\\" Nima has also developed a companion application for iOS and Android, connected through Bluetooth, that allows users to connect with other Nima owners and find allergen information for specific restaurants and packaged foods. The company plans to eventually expand its technology to detect other allergens, such as dairy and tree nuts. They are also exploring detection methods for additives, GMOs, preservatives and possible causes of food poisoning.  Nima science, accuracy and validation  Nima uses antibody based chemistry to detect proteins in food at the parts per million level for both gluten and peanut. The Nima science has been third party validated and published in peer reviewed journals. Nima reports accuracy as the ability to detect gluten in samples of food at 20ppm and above, and to detect peanut in samples of food at 10ppm and above. Nima reports above 97% accuracy when comparing the performance of gluten and peanut detection to the leading food diagnostic lab ELISA tests for traces of gluten at the range of 20ppm and above in food samples and peanut at the range of 10ppm and above. Dr. Stephen Taylor, founder and director of the Food Allergy Research and Resource program, concludes on behalf of the validation study for Nima gluten, \\"We conclude that the portable, handheld Nima gluten sensor functions reliably detect gluten residues at appropriate levels in a range of different foods. The foods were deliberately chosen to represent the wide range of products that might be available as gluten-free options. In our opinion, use of the Nima device will protect the health of gluten-sensitive consumers, if properly used on foods with reasonably uniform gluten distribution.\\" Nima also has published third party validation for the Nima peanut sensor. In addition to the third party validation, Nima's validation studies have been published in peer reviewed journals , including Food Chemistry , The Journal of Food Protection. Studies of Nima's food testing data has also been published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology A clinical study by researchers and clinicians at the Columbia University Celiac Disease Center found that Nima improved the quality of life of adult Celiacs.  Nima's Limitations  Nima Labs, Inc, the company behind Nima, communicates that Nima is a supplement and extra data point to what users are already doing to try and avoid gluten and peanut when eating out. As quoted on the Nima packaging, \\"Nima test results are only representative of the sample and are not a guarantee of the entire dish. Use of this product should not replace education, medical advice, compliance with food labeling and adherence to avoidance strategies. Failure to use this product in accordance with the instruction could result in serious injury or death. Neither the Nima device or individual capsules are designed to be ingested or eaten.\\" While Nima works on most food types, Nima's sensing technology has a few limitations, including detection of proteins in hydrolyzed and fermented foods for gluten. This is most challenging for gluten detection in the case of soy sauce and alcohol - Nima cannot detect gluten in soy sauce or alcohol. The peanut sensor also has limitations for some high concentrations of ingredients. The full list of limitations are published and linked on the Nima FAQs website.  Gluten in unexpected places - one out of 3 dishes labelled gluten-free at restaurants found to have gluten  The majority of Nima users use Nima when eating out at restaurants and testing samples of food that may be higher risk for cross contamination, such as shared friers, gluten-free pizzas cooked in pizza ovens with non-gluten items, sauces, marinades, grill marks. When testing at home, Nima users typically test packaged foods with unclear ingredients or no gluten or peanut ingredients but not labelled gluten-free or peanut-free. Nima users can share their test results on the Nima app and see what other people are testing. A study by the Columbia Celiac Disease Center analyzed thousands of Nima user test results and found that gluten was present in one out of three gluten-free labelled dishes in restaurants.  Reception  Generally, Nima has been positively received in the market place, with recognition by top publications, including:Time magazine's best Inventions and Popular Science 12 Most Important Health Innovations of the Year An investigative reporter as part of the Rossen Reports put the Nima peanut sensor to the test on The Today Show with positive results.

Island Conservation has therefore focused its efforts on islands with species categorized as Critically Endangered and Endangered on the IUCN's Red List. Working in partnership with local communities, government management agencies, and conservation organizations, Island Conservation develops plans for, and implements the removal of, invasive alien species, and conducts field research to document the benefits of the work and to inform future projects. Island Conservation's approach is now being shown to have a wider beneficial effect on the marine systems surrounding its project areas. In addition, invasive vertebrate eradication has now been shown to have many benefits besides conservation of species. Specifically, the approach has been found to align with 13 UN Sustainable Development Goals and 42 associated targets encompassing marine and terrestrial biodiversity conservation, promotion of local and global partnerships, economic development, climate change mitigation, human health and sanitation and sustainable production and consumption. To date Island Conservation has deployed teams to protect 994 populations of 389 species on 52 islands. The work of Island Conservation is not without controversy, This is documented in \\"Battle at the End of Eden\\". Restoring islands requires removing whole populations of an invasive species. There is an ethical question whether humankind has the right to remove one species to save others. However, a 2019 study suggests that if eradications of invasive animals were conducted on just 169 islands, the survival prospects of 9.4% of the Earth's most highly threatened terrestrial insular vertebrates would be improved. History Island Conservation was founded by Dr. Bernie Tershy and Dr. Don Croll, both Professors at UCSC's Long Marine Lab. These scientists learned about the story of Clipperton Island which had been visited by ornithologist Ken Stager of the Los Angeles County Museum in 1958. Appalled at the depredations visited by feral pigs upon the island's brown booby and masked booby colonies (reduced to 500 and 150 birds, respectively), Stager procured a shotgun and removed all 58 pigs. By 2003, the colonies numbered 25,000 Brown Boobies and 112,000 Masked Boobies, the world's second-largest Brown Booby colony and largest Masked Booby colony. Much of organization's early focus was working in Mexico in conjunction with its sister organization, Conservaci√≥n de Islas, in the Gulf of California and off the Pacific Coast. Subsequently, Island Conservation expanded its geographic scope to the Channel Islands of California, Pacific Coast of Canada, The Aleutians Islands, Hawaiian Islands, and finally to the Pacific, Caribbean, and South America. Island Conservation has always had a strong scientific grounding. Over 70 peer-reviewed publications in major journals such as Biological Conservation, Conservation Biology and Proceedings National Academy of Science have been authored or co-authored by Island Conservation staff and contractors. Partnerships As Island Conservation does not have management responsibility over any islands itself, all projects are in partnership with the island owner/manager, island users, local communities and regulatory authorities. Since its founding in 1994, the organization has developed partnerships with over 100 organizations.\\"2014 Annual Report\\" , Island Conservation, p. 17. Partners include conservation organizations, government agencies, regulatory agencies, scientific institutions, and international conservation consortiums. Island Conservation is a member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Alliance for Zero Extinction, and has a Memorandum of Understanding with the US Fish & Wildlife Service, and BirdLife International amongst others. Advisory Council  The organization's founding Advisory Board is composed of prominent scientists, practitioners, and authors in the fields of conservation biology and invasive species including Paul Ehrlich, Jos√© Sarukh√°n Kermez, Russell Mittermeier, Harold Mooney, David Quammen, Peter Raven, Michael Soul√©, and Edward O. Wilson Programs  =North America= In this region, Island Conservation currently works in the United States and Canada. In the United States, the Anacapa Island Restoration Project was completed in 2002 and benefited the Scripps's Murrelet, Cassin's Auklet, and Anacapa Deer Mouse. The Lehau Island Restoration Project was completed in 2006 which benefited Newell's Shearwater, and Black-Footed Albatross. Subsequently, projects completed include the Hawadax Island Restoration Project in 2008, the San Nicolas Island Project in 2010, and the Palmyra Island Restoration Project in 2011. Key federal government partnerships in North America include in the US Department of Interior, USFWS, NPS, the US Department of Agriculture-APHIS, National Wildlife Research Center, NOAA, Parks Canada Agency, and Environment and Climate Change Canada. Island Conservation is working with the following Non- governmental organizations: Coastal Conservation Association (CA), Bird Studies Canada, American Bird Conservancy, The Nature Conservancy, and Conservaci√≥n de Islas. =Pacific= Since 2010, Island Conservation has contributed to the development and implementation of island restoration projects in Australia (Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island), French Polynesia (Acteon-Gambier Archipelago Restoration Project in 2015. ), Tonga (Late Island and numerous small islets), Republic of Palau (including within the Rock Islands Southern Lagoon World Heritage Area), Federated States of Micronesia (Ulithi Lagoon), and New Caledonia (Walpole Island). Island Conservation is an active member of the Pacific Invasives Partnership. Other key partnerships include Invasive Species Council, Birdlife International, New Zealand Department of Conservation, SPREP and the Ornithological Society of French Polynesia. =Caribbean= In this region, Island Conservation works primarily in Puerto Rico, The Commonwealth of The Bahamas, and the Dominican Republic. In May 2012, Island Conservation and the Bahamas National Trust worked together to remove invasive house mice from Allen Cay to protect native species including the Allen Cay Rock Iguana, and Audubon's Shearwater. Since 2008, Island Conservation and the USFWS have worked together to remove invasive vertebrates from Desecheo NWR in Puerto Rico, primarily benefiting the Higo Chumbo cactus, three endemic reptiles, two endemic invertebrates, and to recover globally significant seabird colonies of Brown Boobies, Red-footed Boobies, and Bridled Terns. Future work will focus on important seabird populations, key reptile groups including West Indian Rock Iguanas, and the restoration of Mona Island, Alto Velo, and offshore cays in the Puerto Rican Bank and The Bahamas. Key partnerships include the USFWS, Puerto Rico DNER, the Bahamas National Trust, and the Dominican Republic Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. =South America= In this region, Island Conservation works primarily in Ecuador and Chile. In Ecuador, the R√°bida Island Restoration Project was completed in 2010. A gecko (Phyllodactylus sp.) found during monitoring in late 2012 was only recorded from subfossils estimated at more than 5,700 years old. Live R√°bida Island endemic land snails (Bulimulus (Naesiotus) rabidensis), not seen since collected over 100 years ago, were also collected in late 2012. This was followed in 2012 by the Pinzon and Plaza Sur Island Restoration Project primarily benefiting the Pinz√≥n Giant Tortoise, Opuntia galapageia, Gal√°pagos Land Iguana. As a result of the project, Pinzon Giant Tortoise hatched from eggs and were surviving in the wild for the first time in more than 150 years The current focus in Ecuador is Floreana Island with 55 IUCN threatened species present and 13 extirpated species that could be reintroduced after invasive mammals are eradicated. Partners include: The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, Ministry of Environment (Gal√°pagos National Park Directorate, Gal√°pagos Biosecurity Agency), the Ministry of Agriculture, the Floreana Parish Council and the Galapagos Government Council. In 2009 Chile, Island Conservation initiated formal collaborations with CONAF, the country's protected areas agency, to further restoration of islands under their administration. In January 2014, the Choros Island Restoration Project was completed benefiting the Humboldt Penguin, Peruvian Diving-Petrel, and the local eco-tourism industry. The focus of future work includes the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve and the Juan Fern√°ndez Archipelago.

Houser (born June 21, 1977) is the director of the University of Illinois Marching Illini. In addition to his responsibilities with the university‚Äôs marching band, he is also the current Associate Director of Bands and the Director of Athletic Bands at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. Along with serving as the director of the Marching Illini, his duties include conducting the Hindsley Symphonic Band, the basketball and volleyball bands, while also teaching other courses. Houser is often called upon to serve as an ambassador for the University. Houser is also known for being knowledgeable on the history of the University of Illinois Band program and is an advocate for furthering the program‚Äôs history of innovation. Bands under Houser's direction have performed at events at the national and local level, ranging from the Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day Parade and the NBC Today Show to the ISSMA State Marching Finals and the IMEA State Convention. Bands under Houser‚Äôs direction also performed at Chicago Bears Games, the Hollywood Christmas Parade, the Indianapolis 500 Parade, the Outback Bowl Parade and Half-Time Show, the Target Thanksgiving Day Parade, the Washington DC National Memorial Parade, as well as included performances with Maynard Ferguson and the Dallas Brass. Houser is also the Director and Head Clinician for the Smith Walbridge Clinics, one of the largest marching band/leadership camps of its type in the United States of America.  Education, Personal Life, and Early Years  Houser grew up in North Liberty, Indiana and attended John Glenn High School in Walkerton, Indiana. Instead of studying law at a college in the Midwest as his parents had initially wished, Houser chose to spend his undergraduate years at the University of Florida, where he would go on to major in music education and perform as a trumpet player and eventually drum major of the Gator Marching Band. After starting his teaching career in public high schools, in 2007, Houser decided to go back to school and was a student of James Keene and Pete Griffin at the University of Illinois, where he pursued a master's degree in wind band conducting. While a student at Illinois, Houser served as a graduate assistant where he conducted athletic bands and assisted with directing the Marching Illini, the band over which he would eventually assume full leadership a few years later. In 2007, Houser married Abbey Houser. Career = Eastern Illinois University (2008-2011) = Houser began his collegiate-band-directing career at Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois where he served as the Associate Director of Bands and Director of Athletic Bands. The Eastern Illinois University Marching Panthers was the first college marching band Houser directed. = University of Illinois Marching Illini (2011-present) = After a last-minute resignation of director Pete Griffin, the University of Illinois began their summer search for a new director of the University of Illinois Marching Illini, the marching band that is part of the nation‚Äôs first collegiate band program. This search ultimately resulted in the hiring of Houser, who would now return to lead the program he had served as a graduate assistant for just three years before. During Houser‚Äôs first five years as a faculty member at the University of Illinois, the band has grown to a record-size of 375 members. Under Houser‚Äôs direction, the band has performed at Chicago Bears home football games; an It's On Us rally held by Vice President Joe Biden; the Dublin St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Parade; and many other events separate and apart from athletic events at the University. The band‚Äôs most notable performance during Houser‚Äôs first five years at Illinois was during the 2015 Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving Day Parade. The band was selected to perform in the preeminent position at the end of the parade bringing in Santa Claus. Houser had previously co-directed the Macy's Great-American Marching Band for many years, and therefore had experience preparing for the unique performance at Herald Square. = 2015 Ohio State Recruitment = In April 2015, it became known that the Ohio State University was actively recruiting Houser to serve as the director of their marching band. Despite his participation in the interview process, and finalist-status, Houser ultimately made the decision to remain at the University of Illinois. In an interview about Houser's choice to stay, Jeff Magee, the director of University of Illinois‚Äô School of Music described Houser as a ‚Äúpillar‚Äù of the Illinois Bands program. = \\"Pay It Forward\\" Initiative = In addition to the work that the band does on the field, Houser believes the band can and should use its fame and manpower to help give back to the community. During his time at the university, the band has taken on numerous causes and held unique fundraisers, most notably the \\"Sousaphone 5K.\\" After the first year the race was held, Houser agreed to run the 5K the following year while wearing a sousaphone if the band raised $5000 in an effort to generate additional hype and create an incentive that would help raise more money. Another notable charitable endeavor during Houser's time at the university was the piccolo section's participation in a dance marathon. = Smith Walbridge Clinics = In addition to his responsibilities at the University of Illinois, Houser is also the President of the Smith Walbridge Drum Major Clinics. Houser first joined the staff in 1995 and eventually was named president. Smith Walbridge is the oldest camp of its kind and draws students from all across the country, and around the world every summer. =Macy's Great American Marching Band= Houser has been selected to conduct the Macy's Great American Marching Band six times.

The film, directed by John McDougall and produced by Stuart Legg, was an account of the value of steel in war production in Canada during the Second World War. The film's French version title is Le front d'acier.  Synopsis  In 1940, Canadian heavy industry is converting to a war footing, with a new \\"front of steel\\" confronting the Axis powers, led by Nazi Germany. Steel is the weapon of war used by the nation that had chosen \\"guns before butter\\" and unleashed its lightning blitzkrieg attacks on Europe. The Allied nations realized that only steel could challenge steel, and in the United Kingdom and Canada, industrial workers responded with total energy and efficiency. On the home front, industrial production soared with factories converting to munitions in 100 Canadian cities and towns, with committed Canadians entering the workforce in large numbers. Precision and standardization allowed for rapid production of steel products. As the epitome of a new mechanized steel weapon, the light and simple to use Bren gun was manufactured in Canada in a complex operation that involved 2,800 smaller processes employing 18,000 tools and jigs. Steel is also used in thin sheets to create the submarine chasers coming from Canadian shipyards, in the trucks, armour and ambulances rolling out of factories that were formerly manufacturing automotive products, even in steel ball bearings, critical parts for mechanized warfare. On the \\"front of steel\\", it is \\"soldiers in dungarees\\" that will make the difference between winning and losing in modern warfare and Canada is playing its part.

The Front of Steel was a compilation documentary edited to provide a coherent story, that relied heavily on newsreel material, including \\"enemy\\" footage, in order to provide the background to the dialogue.. Additional footage was shot for the film by cinematographers Alfred Jacquemin and Roy Tash, with on-location sound recording by technicians Maurice Metzger and Walter Darling. The unusual use of intertitles similar to those used in silent film, overlaid over film images, provided onscreen dialogue for the audience.

The complex with later additions later served a range of different functions before it was demolished in the early 1920. History Christian III built a farm referred to as Ladeg√•rden about which hardly anything is known at Nyby outside Copenhagen 1548. The building later associated with the name was established by Christian IV in 1623. The estate covered all of present-day Frederiksberg Municipality. Its purpose was to provide produce for the royal household, grazing for its livestock and feed for the royal mews. A building g with room for 500 pieces of cattle was destroyed in a storm in 1628 and a new, three-storey brick building was constructed in its place. The complex was surrounded by bastions and a moat that was fed with water from the Ladeg√•rd Canal as well as Rosen√•en, a branch which emptied into the sea at Kalvebod Beach. The farm was never an economic success and some of the land was sold off to a group of Dutch farmers from Amager. The building was destroyed during the Swedish siege of Copenhagen in 1658-59. The ruin was purchased by Christoffer Gabel in the earlu 1660s. In 1710, it was converted into a military hospital. During the outbreak of plague 1711-13, it was used as a plague hospital alongside nearby Vodroffg√•rd, housing one hundred patients at a time. On 27 June 1723, the director of the Military Hospital Barracks applied for permission to establish a spinning mill and weaver at Ladeg√•rden. Shortly thereafter plans arose to transform the building into a workhouse. In 1768, Ladeg√•rden was sold to the City of Copenhagen. The residents of Sankt Hans Hospital, a mental institution based in another former plague hospital, which was located at Kalvebod Beach, was then transferred to the Ladeg√•rden site but the institution kept its name. The two facilities co-existed at Ladeg√•rden until 1816 when Sankt Hans Hospital was moved to Bistrup at Roskilde. 1880:Residents of Ladeg√•rden with brooms on the way to town to work Dormitory Ladeg√•rden was once again left unused for until it was once again used as a workhouse from 1822. In 1834, it was expanded with a penal labour facility. In 1908, the indigent residents moved to the newly established institution Sundholm on Amager. The buildings were demolished in connection with extension of Rosen√∏rns All√© in the 1920s. The Radio House was built on the western part of the site. The gore between √Öboulevard, Rosen√∏rns All√© and Julius Thomsens Gade was transferred from Frederiksberg to Copenhagen Municipality and redeveloped with housing.

Grassi was known for his humble and pious nature with a strong devotion to the Marian devotions of Loreto to where he made pilgrimages on an annual basis. Grassi was seen in Fermo as a famous confessor and a counselor who often served as a mediator between warring factions. But among the Oratorians he was known for his strong devotion to the Rule of Saint Philip Neri. Pope Leo XIII celebrated his beatification on 30 September 1900. Life Vincenzo Grassi was born on 13 November 1592 in Fermo to distinguished parents who ensured that Grassi's childhood was both simple and pious. His father died when he was ten around the same time he had contracted a long illness. After the death of his father he began a period of spiritual direction under Father Ricci who had known Saint Philip Neri himself. Grassi studied at the Curate of Saint Peter and also attended the Church of S. Spirito dei Padri dell'Oratorio for additional studies. He assumed the name of \\"Antonio\\" after he entered the Oratorians on 11 October 1609. Grassi was later ordained to the priesthood on 17 December 1617 and received ordination from the Bishop of San Miniato Alessandro Strozzi. During his studies he garnered considerable knowledge of Sacred Scripture as well as Saint Thomas Aquinas and the Church Fathers. In his duties as a priest he was known for his devotion to catechetical work and for preparing children for the reception of the sacraments. He also spent hours in the confessional and claimed that the main task of a priest was to help and to console parishioners who needed to confess their sins. The Governor admired him to the point of putting Grassi's portrait in the town hall as a form of commemoration and recognition for his services as a mediator between warring factions. His devotion to charitable works was boundless: he provided to all those who were poor and sought alms to continue his work. The extent of this was so proverbial that fellow Oratorians criticized him for excessive donations and works ‚Äì but Grassi said that Divine Providence would provide and would work through them. In 1625 he travelled on a pilgrimage to Rome to obtain the Jubilee indulgence of Pope Urban VIII. During this pilgrimage he visited the churches and other places that were related to the life of Saint Philip Neri; he learnt much more about him from Father Consolini who served as a guide. Soon word of his personal holiness would reach Urban VIII and his advisors and this won Grassi the esteem of the pope. On an annual basis he also made a Marian pilgrimage to Loreto where on one occasion a miracle took place: lightning struck him that knocked him unconscious but left him unharmed and his clothes singed; this took place on 4 September 1621. In 1635 he was elected as the superior of the Fermo Oratorians. Grassi suffered a period of ill health in 1671 and had at his bedside the Archbishop of Fermo Giannotto Gualterio who was with him when he died on 13 December 1671; Grassi said to his confreres: \\"What a beautiful thing it is to die as sons of Saint Philip!\\" His remains were buried in the Chiesa del Carmine di Fermo. Beatification The Cardinal Leandro Colloredo ‚Äì a fellow Oratorian ‚Äì demanded that the cause for beatification be opened in Fermo. It led to a subsequent investigation on his life of heroic virtue and the verification of two miracles attributed to his direct intercession. Following the fulfilment of these prerequisites Pope Leo XIII beatified him on 30 September 1900.

Some years later, due in part to an increasingly fractious relationship with her mother, Mary FitzGerald leaves Starkey Manor to take up a position on the Continent. Racked with grief at her daughter's departure, Bridget keeps to her cottage until Madam Starkey brings her a young spaniel, Mignon, who becomes her constant companion. She receives occasional letters from Mary, the last informing her that she was going to marry a gentleman. Upon the deaths of Squire and Madam Starkey, Bridget is left alone at the cottage. After a long period without word from Mary, Bridget leaves the cottage for the Continent in search of her daughter, accompanied by Mignon. Years of unsuccessful searching later, she returns suddenly. Not long after her return, a hunting party goes shooting on the manor. One of the party, Mr Gisborne, is in a foul mood, and shoots Mignon for fun when it crosses his path. Distraught that the only remaining creature she loved is now dead, Bridget calls on the saints to curse Mignon's killer, vowing that the creature he loves best will become a terror loathed by all. It is at this point that the Narrator, who lives with his uncle in London to be trained in his legal practice, enters the story. Taking up a complicated inheritance case involving some property in Ireland, he makes enquiries in Ireland and on the Continent and discovers that the heir to the properties is a Bridget FitzGerald. Visiting her at her cottage, the Narrator is struck by Bridget's grief at the loss of her daughter, and promises to help discover her whereabouts. During a holiday in Harrogate, the Narrator becomes interested in a striking young woman and her older companion Mrs Clarke, whom he sees on his walks across the moors. Eventually, he becomes acquainted with the couple, and he falls in love with the young woman. His eventual marriage proposal is rejected by Mrs Clarke, who tells him that there is a terrible secret which would prevent him from marrying her ward. When he presses the matter, Lucy recounts how two years before, she had become afflicted by the constant presence of a trouble- making demonic doppelganger. Her father sent her to live in the moors with Mrs Clarke to lead a pious life in order to free herself from the curse. Initially sceptical at Lucy's tale, the Narrator's incredulity disappears after he witnesses her demonic double firsthand. That afternoon, the Narrator is informed by a letter from Sir Phillip that Mary Fitzgerald had a child with Mr Gisborne. Piecing together the clues, he realises that Lucy is the child and therefore the granddaughter of Bridget and heir to the Irish estates. Furthermore, he and Mrs Clarke realise that Bridget had unwittingly caused Lucy's condition when she cursed Mr Gisborne, not knowing that he was the father of her own granddaughter. Still in love with Lucy, the Narrator and his uncle throw all their energy into attempting to undo the curse. Revisiting Bridget's cottage in an attempt to get to the root of the curse, the Narrator informs her of the unintended consequences of her words, sending her into a paroxysm of guilt and grief. By the next morning, Bridget has vanished from the cottage, with the curse still not lifted. With Bridget gone, the Narrator settles into despondency in his uncle's chambers in London. One night some months later, they are visited by Father Bernard, a Catholic priest from Lancashire, who explains that he brings information about Bridget Fitzgerald. When on a recent visit to Antwerp in the Austrian Netherlands, he happened upon her outside a church and took her confession. After hearing of her curse, he instructed her to undertake acts of charity as penance, and as a result, Bridget joined the Antwerp convent of Poor Clares, taking the name Sister Magdalen. The Narrator travels to Antwerp, and stays there even as active rebellion breaks out amongst the Flemish against their Austrian rulers. Caught up in a skirmish, the Narrator sees Poor Clare nuns rushing to assist the wounded despite the heavy gunfire. By coincidence, Mr Gisborne, leader of the Austrian garrison, is set upon by the rebels, but is saved by Sister Magdalen, who recognises him and takes him to her cell to tend to his wounds. Days after the battle, the sound of a bell tolling can be heard coming from the convent; a bell that will only be rung when a nun is starving to death. Despite the war-induced famine, the people of Antwerp, including the Narrator, rush to the convent to assist. On reaching Sister Magdalen's cell, they find Mr Gisborne, having been nursed back to health by his curser. Rushing onwards, the crowd comes to the convent's chapel, and sees Sister Magdalen lying on a bier having just received absolution. With her dying breath, she whispers, \\"The curse is lifted.\\"Gaskell, p. 102 Publication history Gaskell's short story was first published in serialized form in 1856 in Charles Dickens' popular weekly magazine Household Words. The three chapters appeared on the 13, 20, and 27 of December of that year.Martin, above no. 1 Gaskell had previously used the magazine to serialize her much longer works, Cranford and North and South in 1851-3 and 1855 respectively.Peter Keating, \\"Introduction\\" to the Penguin edition of Cranford (1976). (London, 1986).Patricia Ingham, \\"Introduction\\" to the Penguin Classics edition of North and South (1995) It later appeared in Round the Sofa and Other Tales, an anthology by Gaskell which used an elaborate framing device to link the many different stories.Laura Kranzler, \\"Notes\\" in the Penguin Classics anthology Gothic Tales (2000). In most publications of The Poor Clare since then, whilst the text from Round the Sofa has been used, the framing device has been omitted. Themes Religion is an important theme in The Poor Clare. Roman Catholicism, largely illegal in England at the time during which the novel is set, features prominently, with most characters being Catholics. The \\"otherness\\" of the Catholic faith in England, emphasised by Bridget's patently Catholic devotions to the Virgin Mary and the saints add to her mysterious nature. A. W. Ward, in speaking on the \\"considerable Roman Catholic element\\" in the story's setting of Lancashire, writes that, \\"No setting could, therefore, have been more appropriately chosen for a story in which faith and superstition, bitter hatred and passionate devotion, are the \\"anthetically mix'd\\" ingredients.\\"A. W. Ward, \\"Introduction,\\" Cousin Phillip and Other Tales, Vol. 5 of The Works of Mrs. Gaskell (London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1906), p. xx. Most of the sympathetic characters, Bridget, the Starkey family, Sir Phillip, who saves Bridget from the local Protestants who would have burned her for a witch,Gaskell, E. (2000) The Poor Clare. In Kranzler, K (ed.) Gothic Tales (p. 87). London: Penguin Books Ltd. (Original work published 1856) and, presumably, Lucy herself, are all catholic. The Poor Clare convent is presented as being beyond rebuke, and Father Bernard is even referred to as \\"a good and wise man\\".Gaskell, p. 95 This is especially striking considering Gaskell's strict Unitarian faith and general dislike towards Catholicism and the Irish.Martin, pg. 37 Gaskell's Unitarianism is reflected in the moral rationalism she employs in her treatment of \\"evil\\" throughout the story.Rebecca Styler. \\"The Problem of 'Evil' in Elizabeth Gaskell's Gothic Tales. Gothic Studies. 12:1. (2010). Available online at https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-2342383191/the-problem-of-evil-in- elizabeth-gaskell-s-gothic Despite the male narrator, feminism is another theme in The Poor Clare. Bridget is a powerful woman who confronts the patriarchal establishment through her own powers.Martin, pg. 35 She has a \\"strong will\\" and \\"strong nature\\", which enable her to exert control over not just her employers the Starkey family, but the rest of the local population as well.Martin, pg. 36 A single woman the entire story, Bridget's later joining of the Poor Clares further subverts the expectations of women at the time. The service-centred life of a convent, independent of male control, stands in stark contrast to the motherhood and household-oriented role expected of women in Gaskell's era.McArthur, Tonya Moutray. \\"A Devotion of Resistance: The Revisiting of Female Monasticism in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century British Literature\\".

Francisco Guzm√°n Carmigniani (born 24 May 1946), known as Pancho Guzm√°n, is a former professional tennis player from Ecuador. Biography Guzm√°n, the son of a banker, began playing tennis at the age of seven and trained at the Guayaquil Tennis Club. He was 11 when he won his first national title and in 1961 was a finalist in the Orange Bowl. In 1963 he made his Davis Cup debut for Ecuador, for a tie against Trinidad and Tobago, aged only 17. In the 1965 French Championships, Guzm√°n was in the unusual situation of exiting in the third round, without even playing a match. He received a first round bye, then benefited from a walkover in the second round when number one seed Manuel Santana had to withdraw. In the third round he lost in a walkover to Bill Hoogs. He made the third round again at the 1966 French Championships, but this time featured in the tournament, with wins over Mike Belkin and Terry Ryan. In the mixed doubles he partnered with Helen Gourlay to make the semi- finals. Curiously he is listed as losing in a walkover for the first round of the singles in every French Open from 1967 to 1971. His most famous moment came in the 1967 Davis Cup when he defeated Arthur Ashe in the reverse singles to complete a surprise victory for Ecuador over the United States in the Americas Inter-Zonal Final. The tie was played on Guzm√°n's home court in Guayaquil. He began started with a loss to Cliff Richey in the first match of the tie, before Miguel Olvera levelled it at 1‚Äì1 going into the doubles. Guzm√°n then teamed up with Olvera to win the doubles rubber, 8‚Äì6 in the fifth set. Guzm√°n secured the tie in the first of the reverse singles in a match against Ashe which went the distance. He lost two of the sets 0‚Äì6, including the first, but was able to prevail in five. Ecuador widely celebrated the win across the country and the El Universo newspaper used a headline that translates to \\"A victory for history\\" to describe to triumph. This qualified Ecuador for Inter-Zonal semi final against Spain in Barcelona and where they were no match for the European team who eliminated them from the tournament. He came from two sets down to beat Bob Lutz in a 64-game marathon opening round match at the 1968 Wimbledon Championships. Later in the year he competed in the exhibition tournament for tennis at the 1968 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal in men's doubles with Teimuraz Kakulia. At the 1969 Canadian Open he made it as far as the quarter-finals of the singles, where he was two points away from upsetting top seed John Newcombe in the fifth set, as well as making the semi-finals in the doubles, with Dick Crealy. In 1974 he made his last Davis Cup appearance for Ecuador. He featured with a total of 14 ties and finished his representative career with 13 wins from 37 matches.

The town consists of 13 small villages with a combined population estimated at 2,500, mostly consisting of Bai people with a small population of Hui and Han residents. Xizhou is located about from the shores of Erhai Lake to the east, and to the Cang Mountain to the west. Xizhou has been historically important as a trading post along the Tea Horse Road, it was once home to a landing strip and radio station for the Flying Tigers during WWII, has been home to notable rulers and governors of local polities past and present, and has gained notoriety in modernity for its high concentration of preserved and restored traditional Bai architecture and protected heritage sites. History Although Xizhou's ancient origins are unclear, the fertile valley that Xizhou lies in has been continuously inhabited for thousands of years. The history of Xizhou dates back to the Sui Dynasty (581 - 618 AD) when it was first incorporated by General Shi Wansui. Soon after, the simultaneous creation of the Nanzhao Kingdom (737 - 902 AD) and the formation of the Tea Horse Road (8th - 20th Century) in the 700s AD had a huge influence on the town's future. Xizhou was located only a few kilometers from the political and military capital of the Nanzhao Kingdom, and benefited from the kingdom's expertise in architecture and engineering. During this era, it served as a military fortress and a temporary palace for the King on Nanzhao. The Yuan dynasty (1271 - 1368 AD) imported a sizeable Muslim population from Northern China and Central Asia to fill high political positions throughout modern Yunnan, and many of the region's Muslim inhabitants can trace their ancestry back to these series of migrations. The Mongol Empire also brought the region their practice of making cheese from cow's milk and whey, a tradition originating in the grassland steppes of Mongolia but one that many families in Xizhou continues today. During the Ming dynasty (1368 - 1644) Xizhou prospered in business and trade on the Tea Horse Road. Bai merchants traveled extensively from Southeast Asia to Tibet, trading their region's tea, marble, and handicrafts. This era brought Xizhou a scholarly reputation, beginning a tradition of writing the names of students who passed the national exam on a large gate in the town square, a tradition that continues today for Xizhou residents who have achieved success in academia, business, and politics. After the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1912) business thrived and it became common for children of wealthy families to go abroad for their studies. Xizhou again became a center of academia, gathering professors and intellectuals after Huazhong University relocated here from Wuhan, earning the nickname \\"Cambridge of the East.\\" Yale-in-China also relocated to Xizhou during World War II to escape the Japanese occupation of eastern China. The Flying Tigers had a radio station and air strip in Xizhou during WWII. During World War II, the American and Chinese armies cooperated in Yunnan as the Flying Tigers, uniting in their fight against Japan. The Americans had superior technology and the Chinese had strategic bases, so the two armies cooperated and shared supplies and materials, working together for several years from bases throughout Southwest China. Xizhou had a small base, airstrip, and radio station which was the first point of contact when planes carrying supplies from Burma first arrived over the Himalayan mountains. Geography Xizhou is located north of Dali's old town and about from Dali's new centre, Xiaguan. It is located on a fertile plateau between the Cangshan mountain range to the west and Erhai lake to the east at an elevation of 2,000 m. Places of interest A Bai reflecting wall in the Linden Centre.A large gate in Xizhou's town square. * Xizhou's daily morning market is one of the largest in the Dali valley and draws farmers and vendors from nearby villages. * Daci Temple () is an ancient structure that was occupied by Japanese troops during World War II and used by Hunan University for 8 years after the war. The temple has statues and icons from different religious beliefs including Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and the Bai people's Benzhu () folk religion. It became a protected heritage site in 1986. * The Linden Centre is housed in a traditional courtyard mansion restored by two Americans. * The town square () is an open space for public gathering with restaurants, food stalls, Xizhou baba (a dough pie served savory or sweet, a local delicacy), and a large marble gate adorned with the names of notable past and present Xizhou residents. * Yan Family Compound (), a well preserved and partially renovated structure in the town square. The compound has been converted in a museum of Xizhou's history and Bai architecture. This site was the original residence of Yan Zizhen, a wealthy businessman from the early 20th century, and is a pristine example of high Bai architecture. * Huadianba () is a high elevation plateau about 4‚Äì5 hours from Xizhou on foot. This grassy plain is home to a small population of herders and their yaks, horses, and sheep. * Zhoucheng () is a town located north of Xizhou, and has developed a reputation for its finely crafted traditional style tie dye (). Culture Raosanling () is the most important religious festival in the calendar of the Bai people. It takes place in three villages in the Dali valley during the fourth lunar month and lasts for three days, each major activity taking place at a different location. The second day's activity takes place in Xizhou. * On Day 1, worship takes place at Qingdong temple at the foot of Wutai peak, some north of the old city of Dali. This is always the busiest day: not only is the temple jam-packed with worshippers who bring food offerings, but outside a large market takes place almost all the way from the main road to the temple. * On Day 2, the action moves to a smaller temple near the waterfront in a small village east of Xizhou. Focus of the day is on singing and entertainment, with many groups performing Bai opera - particularly later in the afternoon in the school-yard not far from the temple. * Day 3 sees the temple of Majiuyi, only six kilometres from Dali, become the centre of attention. The Dongjing music association plays in the temple before worship moves to a small shrine on the lake-front later in the afternoon. The Bai people traditionally serve a special Three Course Tea ceremony during weddings and as a welcome to their guests. The three courses include bitter, sweet, and strange, which represent the different phases of a human life. Three Bai women wearing their traditional headdresses. Although men have abandoned traditional Bai attire in recent decades, many women still wear a distinctive headdress whose shape, materials, and colors correspond to a short poem about the natural beauty of the Dali valley. Wind, flowers, snow, and moonlight (È£éËä±Èõ™Êúà) are each symbolically depicted on Bai women's headdresses. The Bai traditionally practiced a matriarchal organization of society, which is still evident in their architecture and selected social gender roles. Under the eaves of many grand entranceways to homes and buildings, a golden phoenix (female) dominates a series of smaller dragons (male) from above, representing the higher social position of women in society. Similar to Yunnan's Naxi and Tibetan matriarchal culture, Bai men traditionally were in charge of the home and raising children while women were the primary breadwinners for their families. Much has changed to Bai culture over the past century, and these traditional gender roles are far less discrete today. Many buildings in Xizhou are protected heritage sites and some are centuries old. The best documented aspect of Bai culture in Xizhou is the traditional architecture. The history of world class engineering, architecture, and education Xizhou has enjoyed was combined with a period of great financial success in business during the 19th century, and resulted in hundreds of tastefully constructed Bai courtyard style homes that merge traditional local structures with styles imported from across Lijiang, eastern China, and abroad. Many of the buildings were occupied by the Chinese military or served a purpose to local and provincial level governments and spared during the Cultural Revolution, a period of time that many old buildings in China didn't survive. Due to the shared values of Xizhou citizens, many of these structures have become protected heritage sites, some protected at the national level like the Great Wall. An iconic and important attribute of Bai architecture is the inclusion of a large, white reflecting wall in courtyard homes. Wealthier homes will often designate one wall to be a reflecting wall while the other three serve as living spaces (‰∏âÊàø‰∏ÄÁÖßÂ£Å). The reflecting wall serves a practical and symbolic purpose; the white color creates a lighter space in the courtyard especially in the afternoon, it typically faces west in Xizhou to reflect evil spirits that dwell in the depths of Erhai lake away, and it reflects luck and prosperity into the room directly opposite, which is considered to be the most important room in the courtyard. The use of marble in Bai architecture is commonplace due to its abundance and easy access. Marble is incorporated into many courtyard homes' floors, stairs, pillars, and is commonly used as artwork or decoration. Unlike many other parts of the world, when marble is used as art or decoration the price is not decided by its quality but by its aesthetic. In Chinese, the word 'marble' is 'Â§ßÁêÜÁü≥' which literally means 'Dali stone.' Marble is found in other parts of China, but the production of marble in the Dali valley has been famous for many years. Fresh Bai cheese (‰π≥Êâá) is stretched and dried on bamboo. Unusual for China, the Bai people produce and eat cheese (‰π≥Êâá) made from cow's milk and whey. Usually made in small batches and stretched out like a fan over parallel bamboo poles to dry in the sunlight, this cheese is eaten like a snack or used in cooking. It is also a main ingredient in the second course of the Three Course Tea ceremony. The Bai's cheese can be eaten fresh, dried, or fried and is usually served with a sweet sauce, sugar or rose jam. Erkuai (È•µÂùó) is a locally produced rice product bought as a brick and served as either flat strips or noodles. Traditionally, making erkuai was very labor-intensive and only manufactured in large groups for festivals, but with the introduction of machines the production process became efficient enough to produce large amounts of erkuai for cheap consumption, and it can now be found and purchased at Xizhou's market every day. Tie dye (ÊâéÊüì) is a specialty handicraft product produced in nearby Zhoucheng. The Bai people have been making tie dye fabric for generations with naturally rendered dye. It's common to find a temple in Xizhou that hosts statues depicting gods and spirits from different religions coexisting harmoniously. Even symbols from contradictory systems of belief like Confucianism and Taoism can be seen side by side, along with those from Buddhism and the Bai Benzhu (Êú¨‰∏ª) folk religion. There is a small mosque in Xizhou in the Northwest corner, but even this place of worship has evidence of cultural exchange in its traditionally Bai architecture, much of which bears heavy Benzhu influence. Economy The local economy is mostly agricultural, many of Xizhou's local farms grow rice and corn in the summer rainy season and garlic and broad beans during the dry season the rest of the year. There are two growing seasons and the entire valley grows a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, and many families raise their own chickens, pigs, cows, and sheep for personal use or for the market. Rooftop solar panels are becoming very common in the Yunnan countryside as a cost-effective way to heat domestic water. Like many other rural agricultural communities in Yunnan, some Xizhou farmers are starting to realize the potential of organic practices and the incorporation of green technology like solar and wind power to cut costs. In addition to farming, construction and skilled production of marble and wood make up a majority of the economy. Marble production and refinement has a long history in the valley, due to its abundance and easy access to reserves in the Cangshan mountains. Its proximity to Dali's old town has also exposed modern Xizhou to a daily dose of tourism. Many locals have taken advantage of this opportunity and cater to the emerging tourism industry by opening up restaurants, coffeeshops, and guesthouses in town. Transportation Xizhou is a short bus ride from Dali's old town, accessible by buses from both the 214 highway and the Dali-Lijiang road (Â§ß‰∏ΩË∑Ø). Buses from old town should take about 30 minutes and cost around 7 RMB. Xizhou is small enough to walk through its entirety in a few minutes, but horse carts and bicycles are a popular mode of transportation. Education Xizhou's history has a deep focus on academic success and has hosted temporary campuses for Huazhong University and Yale-in- China during the past century. Today, the town is home to public schools for locals year round, and several times a year the students of Sidwell Friends School from Washington, D.C. and Shanghai American School use Xizhou as a satellite campus to study Chinese history and culture and undertake research projects on a variety of subjects.

He was one of the best two-year-olds in Britain in 1991 when he won three of his five races including the Stardom Stakes and the Racing Post Trophy and was regarded as a major contender for the following year's British Classic Races. He failed to win in a three-year- old season which was disrupted by injury but finished third in the International Stakes. He remained in training 1993 but never raced again and did not stand as a breeding stallion. Background Seattle Rhyme was a chestnut colt with a broad white blaze and long white socks on his hind legs bred in Maryland by the Meadow Grove Farm. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Seattle Dancer, a horse who originally found fame as a yearling when he was auctioned for a world record price of $13.1 million in 1985. As a racehorse he showed well above average ability in a brief track career, winning the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial and finishing second in the Grand Prix de Paris. The best of his other winners were Caffe Latte (Ramona Handicap), Que Belle (Preis der Diana) and the Kentucky Oaks runner-up Pike Place Dancer. Seattle Rhyme's dam won two minor races from nine starts in Britain in 1982 and 1983 and later raced in the United States. She was descended from the broodmare Inquisition, making her a distant relative of the German Derby winner Surumu. As a yearling in September 1990 the colt was consigned to the Keeneland sale and was bought for $55,000 by the bloodstock agent Charlie Gordon-Watson.Seattle Rhyme auction history The colt entered the ownership of H J Renn and was sent to Europe where he was trained throughout his racing career by David Elsworth. Racing career =1991: two-year-old season= Seattle Rhyme began his racecourse career in the Granville Maiden Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot Racecourse on 27 July and started a 12/1 outsider in a seven-runner field. Ridden by Willie Carson he started poorly but recovered to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths from the favourite Underwater. Pat Eddery took over the ride when the colt was moved up in class for the Group Three Solario Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse on 30 August. After being restrained in the early stages he finished strongly for finish second, a neck behind the Mark Prescott-trained Chicmond, just ahead of Artic Tracker and Mack the Knife. Two weeks later he was moved up in distance for the Listed Stardom Stakes over one mile at Goodwood Racecourse and started favourite against five opponents. After turning into the straight in second place he took the lead two furlongs out and drew clear to win by three lengths from Rokeby with Alhijaz (later to win three Group One races in Italy) a length and away in third. Cash Asmussen replaced Eddery when Seattle Rhyme was sent to France and stepped up to Group One level for the Grand Crit√©rium over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 5 October. Starting at odds of 5.8/1 he took second place in the straight before finishing third behind Arazi, Rainbow Corner with St Jovite in fourth. Three weeks later, with Asmussen again in the saddle. the colt started 2/1 favourite for the Racing Post Trophy over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. His best of his seven opponents, according to the betting, were Thourios (third in the Dewhurst Stakes), Mack the Knife (second in the Royal Lodge Stakes) and Ninja Dancer (winner of the Autumn Stakes). Thourios and Ninja Dancer disputed the early lead with the favourite close behind. In the straight Seattle Rhyme moved forward, took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away to win by three and a half lengths from Mack the Knife with the outsider Assessor (later to win the Prix Royal Oak and the Prix du Cadran) in third. =1992: three-year-old season= Seattle Rhyme suffered injury problems, including a badly bruised hoof, as a three-year-old and missed the first half of the 1992 season, including the 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby (for which he had been ante-post favourite) and Royal Ascot. He eventually returned in a minor event at York Racecourse on 10 July and started 1/2 favourite but was beaten into second by the Paul Cole-trained Speaker's House. Despite his defeat he was moved back up to Group One class and was matched against older horses for the first time in the International Stakes at the same track on 18 August. Starting a 16/1 outsider, he produced arguably his best effort as he finished third behind Rodrigo de Triano and All At Sea, with the other beaten horses including Dr Devious, Terimon and Kooyonga. On his next appearance, Seattle Rhyme started 8/11 favourite for the September Stakes over eleven furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse on 5 September. He raced at the rear of the five-runner field in a slowly-run race and when the contest developed into a sprint he was unable to quicken and finished third behind Jeune and Red Bishop. On 4 October, Seattle Rhyme was sent to France for the second time to contest the 1992 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp. Ridden by Michael Roberts, he raced prominently in the early stages but dropped away quickly in the straight to finish seventeenth of the eighteen runners behind Subotica. Two weeks after his run in France, Seattle Rhyme started a 20/1 outsider for the Champion Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. On what was to be his final racecourse appearance he faded in the last quarter mile and finished eighth of the ten runners behind Rodrigo de Triano. Seattle Rhyme remained in training in 1993 but never raced again. He never stood as a breeding stallion and may have died before the end 1993.

It was discovered in the region of the sanctuary of Athena Pronaia.Perdrizet, P., 1908, Fouilles de Delphes: Monuments figures: petits bronzes, terres cuites, antiquites diverses, Paris It is a particularly rare object, as the majority of Mycenaean figurines belong to the types Œ¶ (phi) and Œ® (psi). The figurine has aroused the interest of scholars, as it has been considered to constitute a precursor of Pythia seated on a tripod. The theory has not been proved, as it is still believed that the cult of Apollo had not been yet established in the Mycenaean period with the same ritual as later.
