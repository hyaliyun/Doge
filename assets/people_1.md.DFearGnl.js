The population was 2,091 at the 2010 census. Chicago Road In 1824 the United States Congress passed the General Survey Act, intended to create and maintain military roads through what was then the west of the country. One third of the funds allocated went to build a road between the strategic army posts of Detroit and Fort Dearborn, at the little town of Chicago. Known as the Chicago Road, it followed the old Sauk Trail and opened the entire area for settlement. Also in 1824, the land around today's Manchester was surveyed by John Mack, who noted it as being \\"a good mill seat.\\" John Gilbert, who had recently completed work on sections of the Erie Canal, agreed with John Mack, and on May 10, 1826 he purchased of land along the Raisin River at that location. Early village history Originally from upstate New York, John Gilbert resettled to Ypsilanti, Michigan, in 1831. In 1832, he decided to turn his attention to the extensive land tracts he held in the area. He commissioned the construction of a grist mill along the Raisin River upon the land he had purchased in 1826. The original plat of the village of Manchester was prepared by surveyor Hiram Burnham and dated 1833, but was not formally filed until March 25, 1835. The location was chosen to take advantage of water power from the river and named after Manchester, New York. Soulesville In 1833, James Soule purchased a large tract of land about downstream from Manchester. He built a small settlement he named Soulesville. Though the two settlements initially competed against each other, on March 16, 1867, both settlements were incorporated into the village of Manchester. The Manchester Village Office and Manchester Public Library are located on the site of the former settlement.

In 1853 the settlement was divided between separate schools so lost its intimate social cohesiveness, although the southwest corner of Packard and Platt Roads was the location for a station on the Ypsi-Ann Interurban from 1891 until its closure in 1929. The surrounding locale grew in population to become the Platt Community, whose social life centered on the Platt School District in the Township. The community incorporated as the City of East Ann Arbor in 1947, and voted to be annexed by the City of Ann Arbor in 1956.

Weather and climate The weather in Saline is highly variable and is greatly influenced by the Great Lakes. Saline experiences a four-season climate, with summer temperatures reaching as high as 105 °F and temperatures falling as low as -29 °F in the winter. Average high temperatures in the summer range between 70 °F and 85 °F, with average high temperatures in the winter ranging from 15 °F to 35 °F. Precipitation falls year round, with snow being the main form of precipitation during the winter months. Saline experiences an average yearly snowfall of , with most of that coming from \\"Snowstorms\\" and \\"Clippers\\". \\"Lake effect\\" is a common sight in Saline during the winter months; however, the snow is typically much lighter than the heavy accumulations that occur on the western side of the state, which is closer to Lake Michigan. The Great Lakes influence the weather in other ways in Saline, bringing constant clouds in the winter, even with dry air masses in place. Summers are cooler than those in surrounding states, with cool breezes off the Great Lakes when the water temperature is colder than the air temperature. The main weather hazard in Saline—as well as in all of Southeast Michigan—is severe thunderstorms and snowstorms. Tornadoes, high winds, large hail, and lightning are the most frequent causes of death from weather in the area.

Foster bought a mill site on the Huron River at what is now Scio in 1835. The community was platted by Dr. Cyril Nichols from Vermont. A post office was established in 1835. The office was moved to Delhi Mills and renamed in February 1871, though the Scio office was re-established in September 1871. The post office took its name from the township; however, early township records were destroyed by fire, and it is uncertain why \\"Scio\\" was chosen. There are at least three origins suggested for the name. The first suggests it derives from the Greek island of Chios, and the second that it was named after Scio, New York, although that town was also named for Chios.\\"History\\", About Scio Township, Scio Township, Michigan Thirdly, by coincidence scio also means \\"I know\\" in Latin, so following the American Civil War some people assumed this was the origin of the name. Documents regarding the naming of townships in the State of Michigan archives indicate that Scio Township and its northern neighbor Webster Township were named on the same date, unlike other townships in Washtenaw County. This date followed the establishment by the United States of America of diplomatic relations with the modern nation of Greece, following the Greek War of Independence (1821–1830). U.S. Senator Daniel Webster had introduced a resolution, recorded in the Congressional Record, that is widely considered one of his better orations (printed in the Collected Works of Daniel Webster). He advocated that the USA be the first nation to diplomatically recognize Greece. Webster referred to the 1822 destruction of Scio, the then-current French translation of Chios (, pronounced /ˈçio̞s/), derived from the Genoese dialect. In Webster's era, French was the language of international diplomacy. Eugène Delacroix's 1824 painting The Massacre at Chios and numerous publications brought the Greek cause to the attention of Americans. Ypsilanti Township was named after the first leader of the secret organization that coordinated the beginning of the revolution, Alexander Ypsilanti (). The City of Ypsilanti was named after the victor of the final battle of the revolution, Alexander's brother Demetrius. The sister townships of Scio and Webster were named as a monument to the birth of the new Greek republic, the end of its citizen's subjection, and the first American senator to support their nation. Delhi Mills was platted as \\"Michigan Village\\" by Jacob Doremus in 1836, but was renamed Delhi. In 1842, Norman C. Goodale, known as the founder of Delhi Mills, acquired all the unsold lots. The Scio post office was transferred here in 1871 and operated until 1903.

The population was 3,991 at the 2010 census. As a western suburb of Metro Detroit, Belleville is southeast of Ann Arbor and southwest of Detroit. Belleville is located just south of Interstate 94 and is surrounded by Van Buren Township. Belleville Lake is the principal geographic feature, and the city is also home to the National Strawberry Festival. History The community was named in honor of landowner James Bell by adroitly choosing the French word for \\"beautiful town\\". The hamlet was platted in 1847 with the main thoroughfares still used today designated Main, Liberty, and High Street. About 1881, the Belleville depot on the Detroit line of the Wabash Railroad began serving travelers from across the region and the country. Belleville was established as a village in 1905, when its governance separated from Van Buren Township by an act of the State Legislature. Located on the Huron River which was a natural trade route, the village had long been a thriving center for lumber businesses with saw mills located along the shores of the river. The large expanses of woodlands were removed to make way for farmland, industry and increasing population. To generate more electrical power in the region, in early 1926 the Detroit Edison Company built the French Landing Dam on the river east of Belleville, thereby creating Belleville Lake. Belleville Lake is the largest inland lake in Wayne County, stretching 6 miles and covering 1,200 acres. The traditional downtown is nestled on the southern shore of Belleville Lake. Belleville achieved city status on 14 May 1946. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (5.00%) is water.

A very small portion of the city extends into Monroe County. At the 2010 census, the city population was 9,878. History Flat Rock began as a Wyandot settlement. It was later designated as a reservation for the Wyandot, and still functioned as such in 1830.Helen Hornbeck Tanner. Atlas of Great Lakes Indian History. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1987) p. 134 The first European-American settlers in Flat Rock were Michael Vreeland and his five grown sons between 1811 and 1820. Michael had been captured by British Rangers during the Revolutionary War and released after American independence. The family purchased . The town was called the Village of Vreeland until 1838 when the Vreeland family sold off the majority of the land and relinquished control of the area. The Vreeland families built the first grain and lumber mill, having brought the grinding stones from New York. Descendants of Michael Vreeland still live in the town and attend Flat Rock public schools, being the seventh generation to reside in the town their family founded. The first mention of any settlers in the area later to become Flat Rock was made by a French priest, Father Jean Dilhet. In describing his parish in 1798 he included \\"Grosse Roche\\", referring to a settlement named after the outcropping of limestone rock on the south side of the Huron River. In 1818, a land office opened in Detroit, and Soloman Sibley purchased of land. In 1824 it was sold to Michael and Jacob Vreeland. The villages of Vreelandt and Smooth Rock were platted on part of this acreage. At this time there were Huron, Seneca, and Wyandot Indian villages in the area. With the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, large numbers of people, especially from New York, came to Michigan to settle. By 1828 the village had four stores, two saw mills, a wool carding mill, a flour mill, and 250 inhabitants - serving as a center mainly for farmers who lived in the area immediately surrounding the settlement. The village of Flat Rock was platted and recorded in 1838 by the Gibraltar and Flat Rock Land Co. They were attempting to build a canal to connect Lake Erie with Lake Michigan. This effort ultimately failed. Henry Ford was attracted to the water power of the Huron River, and in 1925 he established the Ford Motor Company Lamp Factory along its banks. The Flat Rock Dam was constructed to provide hydroelectricity to the factory. The area was incorporated as a village in 1923 and as a city in 1965. While Flat Rock is a rapidly growing community today, even with its growth, it remains a unique \\"small town\\" with many of its residents having roots reaching back to the 1800s. From the 1930s until the early 1960s an airport was located in Flat Rock. The grass airfield was known as Nan-Bar Airport, named for the owner's two daughters, Nancy and Barbara. During World War II Nan-Bar Airport served as an accessory airfield for Naval Air Station Grosse Ile. Navy pilots used the airfield for short field landing instruction, as well as for emergency landings.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is primarily within Wayne County, but a portion of the city lies in Monroe County, because the border along the Huron River follows the course of the river in 1923, the year Flat Rock was incorporated as a village. At the time, the river had two meanders, but they have since been filled in. Flat Rock has a higher overall tornado average than the state of Michigan as a whole, and a 40% greater average than the United States as a whole. Two F4 tornadoes have hit Flat Rock—one in 1956 and another in 1965 resulting in 23 deaths and over 300 injuries. The city is listed by the U.S. Census Bureau as belonging to both Wayne County to the north and Monroe County to the south. In the 2010 Census, the city is listed as having a total land area of , while mentioning no measurable land area or population statistics within Monroe County. However, the city is still listed in several categories as being part of Monroe County. The official Flat Rock city website also mentions the city's boundaries extending into Monroe County.

History  Downtown Garden City Welcome Sign The origins of Garden City started with the transfer of the property to John Lathers from Andrew Jackson for in October 1835. The city was patterned after the \\"garden city\\" concept that became popular in England during the 19th century, with most home sites sectioned off into plots to allow adequate farming area to support the family with fruit and vegetables. Most sites are now considerably smaller, some as small as 40 feet by 135 feet, with little room for gardening of fruits and vegetables, though the city maintains some large lots where an extra street has not been placed between two of the older streets, such as between some parts of Bock Street and John Hauk Street where Donnelly Avenue does not cut through. In June 1927, Garden City became a village, with Arnold Folker as Village President. Six years later the village became the city of Garden City. Areas of interest in Garden City include the first Kmart store (opened 1962, closed in early 2017), the first Little Caesars (opened May 1959, closed in October 2018), located at 32594 Cherry Hill Road, and the first dine-in McDonald's in Michigan. The honeymoon cottage of Henry Ford and his wife, Clara Jane Bryant, was moved here from Dearborn in 1952.

The population was 10,371 at the 2010 census. The township encompasses several islands in the Detroit River, of which the largest is named as Grosse Ile. Named by French explorers in 1679, Grosse Île means \\"Big Island\\". Later taken under British rule after 1763, the island was not settled by European Americans until after the United States achieved independence in the American Revolutionary War. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and (50.72%) is water. Grosse Ile is the largest island on the Detroit River. The township of Grosse Ile is composed of twelve islands, although the community is most often identified with the main island (which residents simply refer to as \\"The Island\\"). Grosse Ile's main island is technically composed of two islands. Grosse Ile Township is one of only seven municipalities in the state of Michigan to consist entirely of islands, including St. James Township, Drummond Township, Bois Blanc Township, Mackinac Island, Peaine Township, and Sugar Island Township. The tip of the main island's northern section is named Hennepin Point in honor of the 17th-century French explorer Father Louis Hennepin. It is uninhabited and separated from the remainder of the northern section by an unnamed canal that cannot be navigated in a power boat. The southern section of the main island is separated from the northern section by the Thorofare Canal, which runs on a diagonal course from east to west connecting the main channel of the Detroit River with the Trenton Channel of the river. The southern section of the main island is connected by bridges to Elba Island, Meso Island (also known as Upper Hickory Island), Hickory Island, and Swan Island, which are all inhabited. Grosse Ile Toll Bridge Not far from the shoreline of the main island in the river lie Calf Island, Celeron Island (charted as Tawas Island), Dynamite (also known as Powder House Island), Fox Island, Stony Island, and Sugar Island, which are all uninhabited. Stony and Celeron are owned by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Calf Island is owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a part of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. The other islands are privately owned. The low- lying Mamajuda Island is off the northeastern tip of Grosse Ile and is visible only during times of low water level. Two bridges connect the main island to the mainland of Michigan. The bridge on the north end of the island is called the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge (off-white color). The bridge on the south end of the island is officially named the Wayne County Bridge (light green in color), but is commonly called the \\"Free Bridge\\" by locals. History =Founding and early times= The Potawatomi occupied areas of the island, which they called Kitcheminishen, and areas in this region for a long period prior to European encounter. They were one of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires. The flags of three nations—France, England, and the United States—have flown over Detroit and Grosse Ile since the first French explorers visited the island during the late 17th century. The early French explorers named the island as la grosse île—the \\"big island\\" in French. Father Louis Hennepin, a Catholic priest and missionary, accompanied fellow French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1679 on the ship Le Griffon in exploring the Great Lakes. The Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church on Grosse Ile says that Father Hennepin came ashore and said mass at a location on the east shore of the island near the present site of St. Anne's Chapel. No record exists of this event, but Father Hennepin wrote in his journals about the fruit orchards and wild animals on Grosse Ile, showing he was here. The north end of Grosse Ile is named Hennepin Point in his honor. French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and his convoy of 25 canoes sailed down the Detroit River and camped on the shore of Grosse Ile during the evening of July 23, 1701. On the morning of July 24, Cadillac returned upriver and landed ashore, where he claimed French possession of the territory under the authority of King Louis XIV. This site is in present-day Detroit, near the present intersection of West Jefferson and Shelby streets. Grosse Ile maintained its own name and identity as a community through the 18th century. The British established control of the island and present-day Michigan in 1763 after their victory in the French and Indian War. They anglicized the spelling to \\"Grosse Isle\\". Although the Potawatomi, like most Native Americans, did not have the same sense of property ownership as did Europeans and Americans, they considered the island to be part of their ancestral lands. On July 6, 1776, they deeded the island to brothers Alexander and William Macomb, brothers from Albany who had become leading fur traders and merchants in Detroit, partly from selling supplies to the British at Fort Detroit and the local Indian Department. They were so successful that they added a partner for their Detroit trade. (Alexander Macomb later returned to New York, settling in New York City. He became wealthy from land speculation in southern states. He lost his fortune after buying nearly 4 million acres of land in upstate New York in the postwar period and not being able to resell it rapidly enough.) David B. Dill Jr. \\"Portrait of an Opportunist: The Life of Alexander Macomb\\", Watertown Daily Times, (September 9, 1990). First of a 3-part series The Macomb brothers likely believed that by purchasing this deed through the transfer of items of value, they had obtained full ownership rights. They are considered to be the founders of the European-American community on the island and the first legal owners of Grosse Ile. =Settlement to present= Settlement started in the 19th century. At least three homes still standing on the island were built during this period by a descendant or relative of the Macomb brothers. The Rucker Homestead, the oldest structure in use on Grosse Ile, has portions that date to 1816. The front structure was added by John Anthony Rucker in 1835.\\"Grosse Ile: A Historical Timeline\\" The Rucker-Stanton House on West River Road was built in 1848 by the great-grandson of William Macomb. The Wendell House on East River Road was built in the late 1860s by John Wendell, who married a granddaughter of William Macomb. Westcroft Gardens, a Michigan Centennial Farm located on West River Road, is operated by descendants of the Macombs. Westcroft, which is open to the public, features a nursery well known for growing and selling hybrid azaleas and rhododendrons. Westcroft is one of the oldest farms in Michigan still owned by the same family. Most of the original buildings at Westcroft Gardens are still standing and well preserved. Macomb Street of the central business district of Grosse Ile was named in honor of the New York brothers. A monument commemorating the day that the tribal chiefs and elders signed the deed to the Macomb brothers is located at the foot of Gray's Drive and near the shoreline of the Detroit River. The original deed, which was written on parchment, is stored in the Burton Historical Collection at the Detroit Public Library. =Trenton Channel and boating= A section of Grosse Ile waterfront Boating has been both a means of transportation and recreation since the first residents lived on the island. Native Americans used canoes to travel between Grosse Ile's islands and the mainland in Michigan and Canada. Early European settlers primarily used sail- powered vessels to travel to and from the islands. By the late 19th century, Grosse Ile was known as a popular destination for recreational boaters. It was also served by steamboats operating from Detroit and small towns along the river and lakes. During this time period Sugar Island, which is one of the twelve islands commonly considered to comprise Grosse Ile, featured an amusement park, dance pavilion, and bathing beach. Paddle steamers regularly carried people from Detroit and other points along the Michigan side of the Detroit River to Sugar Island. During this era and into the early 20th century, a number of wealthy residents from Detroit and other nearby towns built summer homes along the shoreline (mainly on the southern end) of Grosse Ile in order to enjoy views of the Detroit River or Lake Erie. The interior section of the island was sparsely populated, as most of the land was undeveloped woodlands or part of farms. The residential population of Grosse Ile totaled 802 at the 1920 U.S. Census. The majority of houses were located around the perimeter of the island and main roads crossed the community chiefly in either a north–south or east–west direction. In 1894, the federal government funded and constructed a series of channel range lights to assist ships to avoid shallow areas in the Detroit River and its shoreline. The northernmost of the channel range lights was the Grosse Ile Light, which is now the only lighthouse remaining on the island. The original 1894 Grosse Ile lighthouse resembled a water tower on stilts, as it was constructed on wooden pilings along with a walkway to shore. It was rebuilt in 1906 and designed as the classic white structure that has become one of the iconic landmarks on the island. The lighthouse is considered a symbol of Grosse Ile; its image is used on the masthead of the Ile Camera community newspaper and many other places. The lighthouse's beacon was turned off in the 1940s, and the structure is no longer an important navigation aid for lake freighters. Small boaters still refer to the lighthouse in their navigation of the area. In 1965, the Grosse Ile Township purchased the lighthouse from the U.S. Department of the Interior for $350, with funds provided by the Grosse Ile Historical Society (GIHS). The GIHS was given the responsibility to preserve and maintain the lighthouse. The GIHS annually holds a tour of the lighthouse during a weekend each fall, which is the only time of the year that it is open to the public. Island resident Cameron Waterman invented the outboard motor and successfully tested his invention during February 1905 in the ice-filled Detroit River off the shore of Grosse Ile. He established the Waterman Marine Motor Company in Detroit. The company eventually manufactured and sold up to 1,000 outboard motors per year until Waterman sold the business in 1917. During the fall of 2005, the GIHS celebrated the 100th anniversary of Waterman's invention by hosting a public exhibition featuring fully restored Waterman outboard motors. These are highly collectible and very rare. During the Prohibition era, Grosse Ile became a crossing point for bootleggers illegally smuggling alcoholic beverages from Canada. They typically arrived at the island via small speed boats. During the winter months, some daring smugglers drove cars across the frozen river. =Aviation and military= Naval Air Station During the 1920s and 1930s, a small airport on the southern end of Grosse Ile was the location of historic early aviation activities. The Curtiss-Wright Flying Service operated a flying school at the airport. The Aircraft Development Corporation built the world's first all-metal airship, the ZMC-2, for the Navy in a large hangar. Amelia Earhart is rumored to have stopped at the airfield on occasion. Grosse Ile was the home of a U.S. Navy base for forty years. The U.S. Naval Air Station Grosse Ile opened in 1929 after three years of construction of seaplane and dirigible facilities. During World War II, the naval base developed into an important center for military flight training. The base was expanded considerably to accommodate large numbers of American and British fliers who trained on the island. As a young man during WWII, George H. W. Bush was stationed at the base for training during 1945 for about two months. He later became a politician and President of the United States. During the height of the Cold War, in 1954 the U.S. Army installed an Ajax-Nike missile base at the airfield; it was functional until being decommissioned in 1963. The Navy closed the base during November 1969. The federal government transferred it in 1971 to the township government for civilian use as a municipal airport. Today, the Grosse Ile Municipal Airport is used primarily for general aviation. It has also been the site of public airshows. Occasionally it serves as a temporary docking area for blimps that visit southeastern Michigan to fly over major sporting events. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) operates the Large Lakes Research Station in one of the buildings on the airport grounds. The airport campus is also the site of Grosse Ile Township Hall, which was moved to this location in 2000 from Macomb Street, and a number of private businesses. =Railroads and bridges= In 1873 the Canada Southern Bridge Company, a subsidiary of the Canada Southern Railroad Company, established a railroad from the Michigan mainland to the island that carried both passengers and freight. The company laid tracks across Grosse Ile and built bridges over the Detroit River to enable trains to be transferred to a ferryboat on Stony Island (one of the islands near the east shoreline of Grosse Ile's \\"main island\\"). Once on the ferryboat, the train cars were taken to Ontario, Canada across the river, where they were put back on a rail track to travel to Buffalo, New York and other points east. Canada Southern operated trains on this route for about ten years before ceasing service due to financial difficulties. After Canada Southern ended its operations, the Michigan Central Railroad (MCR) operated a train that provided service between the island and Trenton, Michigan. From Trenton, travelers could connect with trains or streetcars to Detroit and other cities in the region. In 1904, the Michigan Central Railroad built a small brick and stone depot along the tracks near East River Road on the east side of the island. Train service peaked during the early 20th century, but rapidly declined after Edward W. Voigt's Grosse Ile Bridge Company opened the Grosse Ile Toll Bridge for automobile traffic on November 27, 1913 (Thanksgiving Day). The bridge, which is privately owned, is on the west side of the island and connects to the city of Riverview. After automobile traffic crossing the bridge became the most popular means of traveling to and from the island, the Michigan Central Railroad ceased daily passenger service in early 1924; in 1929 it ended its occasional freight service. During 1931, the county government converted the Michigan Central Railroad's defunct rail bridge crossing the Trenton Channel into the Wayne County Bridge for use by vehicular, bike and pedestrian traffic. The rail tracks across the island were replaced by a roadway that is now known as Grosse Ile Parkway. The Wayne County Bridge is commonly referred to as the \\"Free Bridge\\" by residents because of it does not charge a toll. Today, about three-quarters of the vehicle traffic going to and from Grosse Ile travels over the Wayne County Bridge, while one-quarter crosses the Toll Bridge. The Toll Bridge has been hit twice by lake freighters, causing it to close temporarily (in 1965 and in 1992). The Wayne County Bridge was closed to vehicle traffic for major renovations between May 2, 2007, and December 21, 2007. During the 2007 county bridge closure period, the Toll Bridge provided the only route for vehicles to travel to and from the island. =Grosse Ile Historic District= Today, the MCR train depot is owned and operated as a community museum by the Gross Ile Historic Society (GIHS). Nearby is the old U.S. Customs House, which was relocated to the current site in 1980 from Macomb Street. The GIHS also owns the Custom House, and these are the only structures in the National Historic District along East River Road that are regularly open to the public. The district features Saint James Episcopal Church, the oldest church building on the island, constructed during 1867 in part with funds provided by a freed slave named Elizabeth Denison. The district includes six homes, built from the 1840s to 1860s, that are outstanding examples of period architecture, particularly Gothic Revival and Jacobethan Revival. =Modern times, growth and preservation= Grosse Ile has good views of commercial shipping and pleasure boat traffic on the Detroit River. Lake freighters and oceangoing ships traveling to destinations around the Great Lakes regularly pass near the east side of the island, where the main channel of the Detroit River separates Grosse Ile from Ontario, Canada. While the shoreline areas of Grosse Ile feature the majority of historically significant places and structures, approximately a dozen 1920s-era homes in the Jewell Colony subdivision, located in the middle of the island, are listed on the Michigan Register of Historic Places. Jewell Colony was the first planned subdivision on the island. During the later 20th century, Grosse Ile had a significant increase in the rate of residential development, given its advantageous location and other amenities. By the 1980 census, the population of Grosse Ile had increased to approximately 9,300— about 106% over its population in the 1960 census. Fearing the destruction of the natural character and small-town charm of the community, during the early 1990s the Grosse Ile Township established an \\"Open Space Program\\", to be funded by a voter-approved dedicated local property tax to buy undeveloped land. The township acquired large tracts of environmentally sensitive land to slow the pace of development, preserve the environment, and protect housing values. In 1993, a group of residents established a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization named the Grosse Ile Land & Nature Conservancy, to aid in the protection and stewardship of the diverse natural resources on the island. A number of private owners donated environmentally important woodland and wetland areas to the Conservancy to protect them (and to get a tax write-off.) The U.S. EPA granted stewardship responsibilities to the Conservancy for a marsh and upland area on the federally owned section of the Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. This tract of land, which at one time was the location of the Navy's seaplane base and later the Army's Nike missile base, has been restored to its natural state; it features rich biodiversity and rare coastal wetlands. Named the Nature Area by the Conservancy, this land is periodically used by local teachers and Boy Scout groups to teach children about nature and the importance of conservation. Grosse Ile is a community of about 10,371 residents. Money magazine ranked Grosse Ile as one of the \\"Top 100 Best Places to Live\\" in 2009. Culture Grosse Ile Township Hall The annual \\"Islandfest\\" (formerly \\"Azalea Festival\\") takes place around Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. On the same site as Islandfest, the Grosse Ile Youth Recreational Association (GIYRA), a 501c3 charity, runs a haunted house every Halloween. GIYRA coordinates the youth sporting events for the island children. The sports offered by GIYRA are Football and Cheer, Flag Football, Basketball, Baseball and Softball. The island has an indoor tennis facility: six courts inside an old hangar at the city's municipal airport. New ownership has taken over the Tennis Center; they have refinished the courts and are conducting other renovations. The Grosse Ile Soccer Association coordinates the township's soccer league. The rapidly expanding soccer association, which started by hosting a recreational league, has expanded into a larger association. The Grosse Ile Soccer Association has more than 15 select travel / premier level teams on top of the in-house recreational program. Grosse Ile's community theatre, The Islanders, is Downriver's oldest theatre club and one of the oldest civic theatre groups in the state of Michigan. The club has been active on Grosse Ile since 1925, when friends and neighbors developed a means of entertainment during the long Michigan winters. The first major play was produced on May 21, 1926, by a group of 40 founding members. The Grosse Ile High School Robotics Team, 'The Wired Devils', is the island's first robotics team. It is part of the larger community of FIRST teams in Michigan as a whole. The team has grown to more than fifty members since its founding in 2014. Grosse Ile social clubs include the Grosse Ile Yacht Club, the Ford Yacht Club, the Elba-Mar Boat Club, the Grosse Ile Golf and Country Club, West Shore Golf Course, Water's Edge Golf Course, the Kiwanis Club of Grosse Ile, and the Grosse Ile Rotary Club (founded in 1947). Education Grosse Ile Township Schools serves the township. On the island, there are two elementary schools: Parke Lane Elementary which serves grades K-2nd, and Meridian Elementary which serves grades 3rd-5th. The Grosse Ile Middle School enrolls students in 6–8, and Grosse Ile High School provides college preparatory education for grades 9–12. Their mascot is the Red Devil. In 1999 the former middle school was demolished in favor of a new and more up-to-date building. In the process, the historic adjacent school, built in 1911, was demolished amid much controversy. The controversy centered around the desire of many township residents to preserve a historic structure in which many lifelong residents had received their education, and had been the original school building for the island as well. In 2001, Grosse Ile was ranked the highest out of 88 school districts in Michigan by The Detroit News. Demographics The U.S. Census Bureau also defined Grosse Ile Township as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2000 Census so that the community would appear on the list of places (like cities and villages) as well on the list of county subdivisions (like other townships). The final statistics for the township and the CDP were identical. As of the census of 2000, there were 10,894 people, 4,122 households, and 3,293 families residing in the township. The population density was 1,133.9 persons per square mile (437.7/km2). There were 4,335 housing units at an average density of 451.2 per square mile (174.2/km2). The racial makeup of the township was 95.23% White, 0.36% African American, 0.34% Native American, 2.74% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.29% from other races, and 1.00% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.61% of the population. There were 4,122 households, out of which 34.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 72.8% were married couples living together, 5.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.1% were non-families. 17.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 2.99. In the township the population was spread out, with 24.9% under the age of 18, 5.1% from 18 to 24, 23.4% from 25 to 44, 34.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.0 males. The median income for a household in the township was $87,062, and the median income for a family was $96,226. Males had a median income of $71,777 versus $42,430 for females. The per capita income for the township was $42,150. About 1.9% of families and 2.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.4% of those under age 18 and 2.6% of those age 65 or over. The township is considered to be among the safest communities in Michigan. It is highly affluent and is isolated in the river, with two bridges connecting it to the mainland.

As a train (or other vehicle) rounds a curve at speed, objects inside the train experience centrifugal force. This can cause packages to slide about or seated passengers to feel squashed by the outboard armrest, and standing passengers to lose their balance. Tilting trains are designed to counteract this; by tilting the carriages towards the inside of the curve it compensates for the g-force. The train may be constructed such that inertial forces cause the tilting (passive tilt), or it may have a computer-controlled powered mechanism (active tilt). The first passive tilting car design was built in the US in 1937, and an improved version was built in 1939. The opening of WWII ended development. Talgo introduced a version based on their articulated bogie design in 1950s, and this concept saw use on a number of commercial services. Among these was the UAC TurboTrain, which was the first (albeit short-lived) tilting train to enter commercial service in 1968 in the USA and Canada. Parallel experiments in Japan and Italy through the 591 Series and the Fiat Y 0160 developed into the highly successful 381 series which began services in 1973 and is still in service today; and the Pendolino family currently in use across 11 countries since 1976. All of these had problems with short curves like those in switchyards, where they tended to sway about. Also, because of the way the carriages always swung outward, they placed more weight on the outside of the curve, which limited their improvement in corner speed to about 20%. Starting in the late 1960s, British Rail began experiments with their Advanced Passenger Train (APT) which pioneered the active-tilt concept. This used hydraulic rams on the bottoms of the carriages to tilt them, rotating them around their centre point rather than swinging outward. This had the advantage of keeping the carriage centred over the bogies, which reduced load on the rails, and could be turned off when navigating switches. Due to lengthy delays, the APT did not begin test runs until 1981 and entered commercial service only briefly in 1985. By this time, the Canadian LRC design had become the first active tilting train to enter full commercial service, starting with Via Rail in 1981. Fiat developed their Pendolino design into the most successful type of tilting train, with over 500 trains active in Europe. The concept of active tilt as a whole has been independently developed by many companies. Active tilting systems are widely used today.  Design  ICE-T (DB class 411) leaves a curve, showing cars tilted to different degrees. Aeroplanes and bicycles tilt inwards when cornering, but automobiles and trains cannot do this on their own. Vehicles with high centres of gravity rounding sharp curves at high speeds may topple over. To make their turns easier, the outer edge of a roadway of a high-speed highway or outer rail of a railway may be canted (raised) upward around the curve. The combination of tilt and centrifugal force combines to produce an effective acceleration that is down through the floor, reducing or eliminating any sideways component. The particular angle of tilt (\\"superelevation\\") is determined by the intended vehicle speed — higher speeds require more banking. But with a growing desire in the 1960s and 1970s to build high-speed rail networks, a problem arose: the amount of tilt appropriate for high-speed trains would be over-tilted for lower-speed local passenger and freight trains sharing the lines. Japan's early bullet train efforts of the 1960s avoided this problem by laying all-new lines as part of a re-gauging effort, and France's TGV followed the same pattern. Other operators did not have this luxury and were generally limited to much lower speeds. Spain's national railway RENFE took a domestic invention, the Talgo, and developed it into a reliable high-speed train for a low-traffic-density railway. British Railways invested heavily in tilting- train technology to overcome the limitations of a rail network located in space-constrained built-up areas. Italy's Trenitalia and the Japan National Railways have used tilting technology to speed express trains on conventional tracks through mountainous terrain. Tilting trains are meant to help reduce the effects of centrifugal force on the human body, but they can still cause nausea, a problem that was widely seen on early \\"passive\\" tilting trains that exactly balanced the outward force. The effect could be felt under maximum speed and tilt, when the combination of tilting outside view and lack of corresponding sideways force can be disconcerting to passengers, like that of a \\"thrill ride\\". More limited and slower tilt could be achieved using active, or 'forced', tilting mechanisms. In trains adopting these mechanisms tilt is initiated by computers, which 'force' train bodies to tilt at specific angles based on track information. This information could be stored on board or detected using a sensor at the front of the train or using Automatic train stop beacons. The slight delay in reacting to this information leads to a short period of sideways force while the cars react. It was found that when the cars tilt just at the beginning of the curves instead of while they are making the turns, there was no motion sickness. Researchers have found that if the tilting motion is reduced to compensate for 80% or less of lateral apparent force, then passengers feel more secure. Also, motion sickness on tilting trains can be essentially eliminated by adjusting the timing of when the cars tilt as they enter and leave the curves. A similar technology widely adopted across Asia and Oceania, known as controlled passive tilt, achieves a similar effect by using on-board computers to limit tilt, initiated using inertia (as in traditional passive tilt). Automatic train stop beacons are used to inform computers of the precise location of these trains and limit natural tilt to angles specified by track data. = High-speed trains = The JR N700 Series Shinkansen, the first tilting train on Japan's high speed network. A high-speed tilting train is a tilting train that operates at high speed, typically defined as by the European Union to include for upgraded track and or faster for new track. Tilting trains operating at or more on upgraded track include the Acela Express in the USA, the X 2000 in Sweden, the Pendolinos and Super Voyagers on the West Coast Main Line in Great Britain, and the ICE TD in Germany (the latter two being diesel powered). Some older high-speed lines were built for lower line speeds (≤ ); newer tilting trainsets can maintain higher speeds on them. For example, the Japanese N700 Series Shinkansen may tilt up to one degree on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, allowing the trains to maintain even on radius curves that previously had a maximum speed of . Many high-speed trainsets are designed to operate on purpose-built high-speed lines and then continue their journeys on legacy lines, upgraded or not. Where the legacy lines justify it, a tilting train may operate at higher speeds on the latter, even if below the normal threshold, whilst operating at or faster, usually with tilt disabled, on the high speed lines. History =Pendulum car= CBQ No. 6000, one of three experimental Pendulum cars, at Vancouver in the 1940s. The first experimental tilting train concept was the pendulum-suspension \\"chair\\" cars designed by the Pacific Railway Equipment Company. The first prototype, with an articulated bogie system, was built in 1937 and tested on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway that year. The company built another three pre-production models in 1939, using more conventional fore-and-aft bogies, and these saw some use with the San Diegan, among others. Mounted on high springs, the car tilted inwards on curves to counterbalance the cant deficiency with the induced centrifugal force. The opening of World War II prevented any immediate orders, and the concept was not taken up again in the post-war era. =SNCF experiment= In 1956, SNCF experimented with a self-propelled pendulum car, which also relied on centrifugal force. This experiment demonstrated the need for an active suspension system to tilt the coach bodies. =Talgo Pendular= Talgo Pendular in Prague, 1993 The Spanish Talgo company had introduced the first widely successful shared-bogie system, which allowed cars to be connected end- to-end using a single bogie instead of each car having its own bogies at either end. This design saves weight and can reduce rail wear. In the early 1950s, RENFE experimented with passenger cars that combined the Talgo bogie with a new passive tilting system. This system used a large A-frame connected to the centre of the bogie that was as high as the cars. At the top of the A was a bearing system that the cars attached to, and a spring and damping system to smooth its motion. Because the cars were connected at this high point, they could swing to either side around the bearing axis, and this caused them to naturally pendulum outward on curves. The first test of a Talgo in the United States was the John Quincy Adams with Fairbanks-Morse P-12-42 tested by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1957–1958. Due to technical troubles and the precarious financial state of the New Haven railroad, the trainset was set aside. The idea caught the interest of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, who began development of what would become the UAC TurboTrain using the same system. The TurboTrain entered service in the US and Canada in 1968. The first successful European tilting train design was the Talgo in Spain, developed in the 1970s as a lightweight, fast train using passive tilt. The Spanish National Railway, RENFE, adopted the system widely, but was restricted to the Iberian peninsula initially. The first full commercial application of passive tilting trains appeared in early 1980s with the Talgo Pendular. Talgo is currently in its 21st generation of production. Talgo trains are in service in various parts of Europe, and built under licence in Latin America and Asia. In North America, Amtrak uses Talgo trains in its Cascades service in the Northwest. The first Talgo tilting series were the \\"pendular\\" ones from 400 series onwards. =UAC TurboTrain= The Turbo remained in service in Canada into the 1980s, and is seen here in VIA Rail livery. The first tilting train to enter into regular service in North America was the United Aircraft TurboTrain, used by Canadian National Railways in 1968. It should be rightfully considered the first tilting train in service in the world. It assured daily service between Montreal and Toronto at speeds of 160 km/h, until it was replaced by Bombardier LRC trains in 1982, reaching the maximum speed of 225 km/h during Canadian trials. United Aircraft Turbos were also used by Amtrak between Boston and New York. The UAC Turbos had a passive tilt mechanism based on a four-bar arrangement, and they inspired the second generation of TALGO trains. =Pendolino= ETR 401 near Ancona ETR 600, in service since 2006. In Italy, the studies for a tilting train started in the mid 1960s and the concept was patented in 1967 by two engineers of Fiat railway materials, Franco di Maio and Luigi Santanera. A number of prototypes were built and tested, including an automotrice (self-propelled) derived from ALn 668, the ALn 668 1999 diesel car, provided with tilting seats in order to test the concrete effects of active tilting technologies. The first working prototype using a tilting carbody was ETR Y 0160, an electrically powered car launched by FIAT in 1969. This was the first to be christened Pendolino. This design led to the construction of a whole EMU in 1975, the ETR 401, built in two units by FIAT. One was put into public service on 2 July 1976 on the Rome- Ancona (later extended to Rimini) line, operated by Italian State Railways. Between Roma and Ancona (km. 295), the train took 2 hours and 50 minutes, while the ordinary trains took 3 hours and 30 minutes. The train had four cars and was mostly considered a travelling laboratory for the new technology. Initially the ETR 401 was conceived as the first of a series of four trains, but the government lost interest to the project, because of financial problems, and the envelopment was temporarily interrupted, as the service in 1983 and the train was used in demonstration campaigns to foreign countries, like Germany, Switzerland, Cechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. A second unit was built for service to the wide-gauge RENFE Spanish lines, in 1977, under the nickname of Platanito. The service didn't last of long, because the problems of Spanish tracks made Platanito little useful. New interest of the Italian government to the project in the mid 1980s, and the introduction of new technologies, led to the revise of the project of the ETR 401 with electronical systems, that led to the introduction of the slightly more advanced ETR 450, the first Pendolino to enter regular service in the world. Characterized by an 8-car configuration, and a maximum tilt reduced to 8° from the 10° of the ETR 401, for safety and comfort reasons, ETR 450 could run the Rome-Milan line in under four hours, at speeds up to 250 km/h. Passenger numbers increased from 220,000 in 1988 to 2.2 million in 1993. In 1989, the already old technologies an concepts of some parts of the ETR 450, and the introduction of new technologies in traction, led to the development of the next generation, the result was the ETR 460, styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro, train that began service in 1996. Though plagued by technical teething problems, the ETR 460 introduced several innovations, such as more powerful AC asynchronous motors. Furthermore, the pistons actuating the tilting action were placed in the bogie instead of on the carbody sides: this permitted the reorganisation of the vestibules and passenger compartment areas, improving comfort. The bogie-to-body connection is extremely simple and easy to make, with clear advantages for maintenance. ETR 460 keeps axle load to an extremely low level (14.5 ton/axle), to allow the train to negotiate curves up to 35% faster than conventional Intercity trains (locomotive plus coaches). The body, which exploits large aluminium extrusion technology, has substantial modularity and allows for extremely low axle weight, whilst fully respecting the highest safety standards, and allows the best exploitation of the space with different loading gauges. ETR 460 was built in only 10 units. Improved versions include ETR 470 for the Italo-Swiss Cisalpino company, the ETR 460 France, later called as ETR 463, used by FS to the route Milan Lione, and the ETR 480, used by Trenitalia under AC-powered Italian high speed lines. A total of 34 EMUs of the ETR 460/470/480 series were built for FS. The development of the Pendolino technology continued in the Italian factories of Alstom and the next generation, the New Pendolino, was delivered to Trenitalia and Cisalpino as the ETR 600 and the ETR 610 from 2006. Italian Pendolinos and their derivatives still represent the most popular solution for active tilting in passenger trains. The technology still in use today is almost the same developed by Fiat Ferroviaria in the 1960s-70s. The British version of the Pendolino, the British Rail Class 390, is a electric tilting train operated by Avanti West Coast. The train is known as Class 390, and runs on the West Coast Main Line (London Euston to Glasgow Central, Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly). Class 390s commenced operation in 2001 with only one being in a major derailment. Due to signalling constraints, Class 390s are limited to in regular service. =Japanese designs= The 381 series, the first tilting EMU to enter regular service globally. Tilting trains have long been a mainstay of express services on Japan's conventional-speed, narrow gauge network. The interurban Odakyu Electric Railway began Japan's first experiments in tilting technology in the 1960s by fitting pneumatic bogies to their electric railcars,「小田急座談 (Part1) 車両編」、『鉄道ピクトリアル アーカイブスセレクション』第1号、電気車研究会、2002年9月、 6-16頁。 while the Japanese National Railways pioneered their form of passive-tilt technology on their experimental 591 series EMU with commercial express services on mountain lines in mind. The first commercial tilting EMU in Asia entered service in 1973 as the 381 series EMUs on Shinano limited express services operating on the hilly Chūō Main Line between Nagoya and Nagano, and is still in operation on the \\"Yakumo\\" service on the Hakubi Line despite its shortcomings in ride quality and increased track wear due to its tilt mechanism that allowed up to 5° of tilt. The JR Shikoku 2000 series DMU negotiating a tight curve on Shikoku's mountainous railway network. During the final years of the Japanese National Railways, experimentation on mechanically-regulated passive tilt - a combination known as 'controlled passive tilt' (制御付き自然振子式), where tilt is initiated passively but controlled (and slowed down) by computers through mechanical active suspension - culminated post-privatisation with the 2000 series DMU, built for JR Shikoku and introduced on the Shiokaze and Nanpū limited express services in 1990. With problems of ride nausea and track wear alleviated, the benefits of tilting trains on the country's mountainous Cape gauge (1,067mm) railway system soon became apparent and since then these 'semi-active' tilting trains have seen widespread use on limited-express trains throughout the archipelago. Particularly well-known diesel and electric examples of this generation of tilting trains include JR Hokkaido's KiHa 281 series, JR East's E351 series, JR Central's 383 series, JR Shikoku's 8000 series, and JR Kyushu's 885 series. This generation of designs has seen some popularity overseas - the 8000 series serves as the basis of the Electric Tilt Train built for Queensland Rail's Cape Gauge network. The 885 series, built as part of the Hitachi A-train family, serves as the basis of the Taiwanese TEMU1000 series tilting EMU for Taroko Express services, and some non-tilting variants including the British Rail Class 395 and British Rail Class 801. The Taiwanese TEMU1000 Series, based on the JR Kyushu 885 Series Later developments in pneumatic active suspension - based on the DB Class 403 built decades earlier - created a generation of trains with more limited tilt (around 2°) but are more economical to build and easier to maintain. The experimental 300X Series built in 1995 developed into the N700 series, the first revenue-earning tilting Shinkansen unit in 2007. Applications to Shinkansen lines - which would not have benefitted greatly with mechanical tilting mechanisms due to their already shallow curves that allow high speeds anyway - allowed for greater ride comfort, less track wear and slightly higher speeds leading to increased frequency. The simplicity of this technology made it possible for smaller private operators to introduce tilting trains, such as the Odakyu 50000 series VSE, a luxurious sightseeing express train with active suspension introduced not to increase speeds but to enhance ride comfort; and even cheap enough to be applied to commuter stock, such as JR Hokkaido's KiHa 201 series, which improved speeds and frequencies on Sapporo's partly non-electrified suburban railway system. This is also one of the only applications of tilting technology on 'metro-style' commuter trains to date. The KiHa 201 DMU, a unique application of active suspension technology to a commuter train. = German designs = 611 508 in Nuremberg An ICE TD in regular service in 2002 Deutsche Bundesbahn started tests with tilting trains in Germany with its class 634 in 1967 when some class 624 DMUs were equipped with passive tilting systems. As the passengers experienced motion sickness, the tilting technology was disabled and later removed. The tests continued with the prototypes of the following class 614 units, but due to the again unsatisfying results the serial types were delivered without tilting system. Another early train with tilting technology was Deutsche Bundesbahn's class 403 (today this number is used by ICE 3) high speed EMU. Following its InterCity services until 1979, it was also used for airport transfers between Düsseldorf and Frankfurt (see also: AiRail Service). Class 403 was able to tilt 4°, but the fixed pantographs limited this to 2°. Shortly after the train had gone into service the tilting technology was disabled as many passengers experienced motion sickness because the pivotal point was too low. The next attempt was made with DMUs and the well proven Italian hydraulic active tilting system. Between 1988 and 1990 DB commissioned 20 class 610 units for fast regional traffic. This time the results were quite satisfying and allowed a significant reduction of running times. Class 610 was followed by class 611 which basically was built for the same purpose (fast regional traffic with up to on twisting non- electrified lines). Class 611's tilting system was electric, with a maximum 8° tilt, based on military technology from the Leopard tank. However, after coming into service in 1996 this 50-unit class experienced problems both with the newly developed tilting system as well as chassis and axles, so it was judged not successful. The tilting system was out of service until 2006, when hardened axles and system updates finally solved the problems. In consideration of these problems DB ordered a full re-engineering, resulting in the development of class 612. Starting in 1998, a total of 192 units were commissioned by DB. The tilting system was reliable, but when in 2004 cracks were detected in a number of wheel sets, again wheels and axles had to be replaced. Today class 612 is back to tilting operation and forms the backbone of DB's fast regional service on non-electrified lines. Additional units were sold to Croatia, where they are used for InterCity services. Finally in 1999, DB was able to use tilting technology for its InterCityExpress services, when with class 411 and 415 an electric high-speed tilting train was commissioned. While classes 401 to 403 (without tilting technology) were to cover the newly built or modernized high speed lines at up to (class 403), classes 411 and 415 with maximum speed of were designed for older twisting main lines. A total of 60 class 411 and 11 class 415 (shorter version) have been built so far. Both classes worked reliably until late 2008 when cracks were found on an axle during a routine check. The tilting mechanism has been switched off since 23. October 2008 and the maintenance intervals were drastically reduced which led to major service disruptions. Much of the technical layout is derived from the ICE 3. Austria's ÖBB has purchased three units in 2007, operating them jointly with DB for services from Germany to Austria. Even though DB assigned the name ICE-T to class 411/415, the T originally did not stand for tilting but for Triebwagen (self-propelled car), as DB's marketing department at first deemed the top speed too low for assignment of the InterCityExpress brand and therefore planned to refer to this class as IC-T (InterCity-Triebwagen). Rather luckless was class 411/415's adaptation for diesel services. In 2001 a total of 20 units were commissioned for use on the Dresden-Munich line, but these class 605 (ICE-TD) units experienced trouble from the start. After the breaking of an axle in 2002, all remaining 19 units (one fell off a working platform) were taken out of service. Even though one year later the trains were admitted to service again, DB judged their operation to be overly expensive. In 2006 those trains were used for amplifier trains and since 2008 they run on the Hamburg-Copenhagen route. =Light, Rapid, Comfortable= Via Rail Canada LRC In 1966, a consortium of Canadian industrial firms began considering a conventionally-powered competitor to the TurboTrain, eventually emerging as the LRC (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) in the early 1970s. This design also used an active-tilt system, but one of very different form than the ATP. The carriages rode on two C-shaped channels mounted across the top of the bogies. Tilt was accomplished by rams that pushed the bottom of the carriage side to side along these channels. Amtrak experimented with the LRC in 1980, but retired it seven years later. In Canada, it entered service in 1981, beating the ATP into service and becoming the first operational active- tilt system. The LRC carriages remain in use today, although the tilt mechanisms are being removed to reduce weight and maintenance costs. Bombardier has since used updated versions of the LRC carriages for Amtrak's Acela Express, the third generation of tilting ICE, the new generation of fast British trains (Super Voyager) and the experimental JetTrain. =Advanced Passenger Train= The Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was initially an experimental project by British Rail, with the train entering service in 1984. Although eventually abandoned, the train was the pioneer of active tilt to negotiate tight curves at higher speeds than previous passive tilting trains. For various reasons, political and technical, after running in service for a year, the train was withdrawn. In the 1970s and 1980s, British Rail wanted an advanced fast train to negotiate the UK's twisting and winding Victorian-era rail system. Conventional trains were limited in speed due to the twisting nature of the network. APT-P The engineers at the research division, opened in 1964, had already carried out fundamental work on vehicle dynamics, with the APT to a degree an extension of this. The existing Chief Mechanical and Electrical Engineers department was overlooked by the new project, creating resentment with its engineers. The work included experimentation with aluminium bodies, turbines, suspension and bogies, and active tilt. The APT-E (E for experimental) was powered by gas turbines; the APT-P (P for prototype) was electric. With no tilting, the train was developed to break the British rail speed record. Tilting trains using passive tilt were not new, but it was uncommon and not widely implemented. The engineers decided that active tilt was the key to negotiating curves at much higher speeds. The train had hydro- dynamic brakes and lightweight articulated bodies, with two power cars in the centre of the train. When the prototypes were built, worked and proven, the engineering development team was disbanded and the trains handed over to British Rail's in-house engineering department to build. The developing engineers moved on to different fields while British Rail engineered the train into a production model. The BR engineers, who had little to no involvement in the development of the train, changed some of the prime and proven engineering aspects. For example, they changed the active tilt mechanism to air (pneumatic), rather than the well-developed and proven hydraulics. The trains were introduced in 1981, but almost immediately taken out of service. During initial tests, some passengers complained of being nauseous due to the tilting motion. Subsequently, it was learned that this could be prevented by reducing the tilt slightly, so that there was still some sensation of cornering. The APT-P trains were quietly reintroduced into service in mid-1984 and ran regularly for a year, the teething problems having been corrected. However, the political and managerial will to continue the project, by building the projected APT-S production vehicles in numbers, had evaporated under an in- house engineering management who felt slighted and by-passed in a project they did not develop. Despite being an eventual success, the project was scrapped by British Rail in 1985, more for political reasons than technical. Much of the technology developed for the power cars was subsequently used in the non- tilting InterCity225 British Rail Class 91 locomotives, which run on the East Coast Main Line route from London to Leeds and Edinburgh. =X 2000= The Swedish X2 at Graversfors In 1990 Swedish railways introduced a high speed service called X 2000. The train uses an active tilting system enabling higher speeds of () on standard track. =TGV Pendulaire= In 1998 SNCF bowed to political pressure (the tilt-train was a credible threat to the TGV dedicated high-speed line network) and put in service an experimental TGV pendulaire. Only the passenger trailers were tilting while the two heavy power cars kept non-tilting bogies. Following the test program, it was converted back to a TGV-PSE train. =InterCity Neigezug= The SBB RABDe 500 in 2004 Switzerland got its first tilting train ever in its territory (discounting the Cisalpino, which entered Switzerland in 1996) on May 28, 2000. The ICN (InterCity Neigezug, or InterCity Tilting Train) was made by Bombardier, including a tilting-system designed by SIG (today ALSTOM). It started service on the line from Geneva via Biel/Bienne and Zürich to St Gallen. It was a major carrier in the national exhibition Expo.02. =Bombardier SuperVoyager= Diesel-electric powered British Rail Class 221 serve Holyhead, Chester, Bangor and Wrexham. Technology An Electric Tilt Train. In 1999, an Electric Tilt Train set an Australian speed record of 210 km/h, making it the fastest narrow-gauge train in service.

Demonstration of the Tilting-Technology of a SBB RABDe 500 in stand. Many of the problems with motion sickness are related to the fact that traditional servo systems respond inappropriately to the changes in trajectory forces, and even small errors whilst not being consciously perceivable cause nausea due to their unfamiliar nature. The original Fiat ETR 401 used individual gyroscopes in each carriage so there was inevitably a lag, even though nausea had not been a major problem with this train. The APT was supposed to overcome this problem by using gyroscopes at the ends of the train and a master/slave control system which defined a \\"tilting curve\\" for the whole train. It would appear that the technology of the era was not able to implement this technique as well as required. Modern tilting trains are profiting from state-of-the-art signal processing which senses the line ahead and is able to predict optimal control signals for the individual carriages. Complaints about nausea have by and large become a thing of the past. Some tilting trains run on narrow gauge railways. In Japan there are many narrow gauge lines in mountainous regions, and tilting trains have been designed to run on these. In Australia, the service between Brisbane and Cairns by the QR Tilt Train claims to be the fastest narrow-gauge train in the world, running at . The Electric Tilt Train also holds the record for the fastest narrow- gauge train by maximum test speed, reaching 210 km/h.

As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 5,421. Grosse Pointe is an eastern suburb of Metro Detroit along Lake St. Clair. It shares its northwestern border with the city of Detroit and is about northeast of Downtown Detroit along East Jefferson Avenue. It is one of five affluent communities within the Grosse Pointe collection of cities, which also includes Grosse Pointe Farms, Grosse Pointe Park, Grosse Pointe Shores, and Grosse Pointe Woods. History Grosse Pointe was incorporated as a village in 1880, but at that time also included what is now Grosse Pointe Farms. The community was divided along its present lines in 1893 over issues of allowing the sale of alcohol. It was incorporated as a city in 1934.Walter Romig, Michigan Place Names, p. 242 Together with \\"The Park\\" and \\"The Farms\\", \\"the City\\" comprises part of the southern Pointes, which are older and more densely populated than the northern Pointes (Grosse Pointe Woods and Grosse Pointe Shores). It became heavily populated between 1910 and 1930 as one of Detroit's first commuter suburbs; in the previous century, Grosse Pointe was home to cottages, resorts, farms, and widely spaced lakefront mansions. Grosse Pointe (\\"the City\\"), Grosse Pointe Farms, and Grosse Pointe Park make up the Grosse Pointe South High School district. Downtown Grosse Pointe, along Kercheval Avenue from Neff to Cadieux, nicknamed \\"The Village,\\" is considered by many to be the central downtown for all five of the Grosse Pointes, although each of them (except Grosse Pointe Shores) has several blocks of retail properties. Geography The Grosse Pointe waterfront at Neff Park According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The water is part of Lake St. Clair. The street layout of Grosse Pointe is basically a grid inside of its Cadieux, Mack, and Fisher Road boundaries. Inside this small rectangle, most blocks contain rows of single-family homes built between 1910 and 1950, on parcels wide on average. Some streets offer large backyards, such as Washington and Lakeland, while other streets are more compact. In some areas homes are configured in a traditionally urban, close- together fashion, while other nearby blocks may offer yards up to wide. Home sizes and styles vary widely, from , but slightly under on average. Most of the largest homes are within a few blocks of the lakefront; there are several blocks of mansions south of Kercheval Avenue. Predominant architecture includes the neo-Georgian, Tudor revival, Dutch Colonial, and arts and crafts styles. Some Victorian homes and traditional bungalow homes can also be found, mostly just north and south of the Village retail district. Some blocks, generally just south of the Village, have townhouses and apartments. Most of these were built in the 1920s, and can be seen along St. Paul, Maumee, and Jefferson avenues, mostly west of Rivard Boulevard, and between Notre Dame and Cadieux south of the Village retail district. There are retail and low-rise office buildings along Kercheval Avenue in the Village district, on Fisher Road near Grosse Pointe South High School, and along Mack Avenue bordering Detroit. Climate This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Grosse Pointe has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \\"Dfb\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Grosse Pointe, Michigan Demographics An upscale historic neighborhood in Grosse Pointe =2010 census= As of the census of 2010, there were 5,421 people, 2,236 households, and 1,481 families residing in the city.

Downtown development The City's Master Plan permits additional growth in downtown Grosse Pointe, also known as \\"The Village\\", allowing an expansion of the shopping- and amenities-focused district. In particular, two lots (on either side of St. Clair Avenue) currently used for municipal parking directly north of the current row of retail are the focus of planned development. The former Jacobson's Department Store building along Kercheval, west of St. Clair, has been completely redeveloped. Upper-floor office space accompanies a slate of new retailers, including a Trader Joe's grocery occupying specialized space in the renovated building. In addition, a new building rose in 2011 to replace the former Kroger grocery store at the corner of Kercheval and Notre Dame Street. Education Grosse Pointe Public School System operates public schools. Lewis Maire Elementary School in Grosse Pointe and Pierce Middle School in Grosse Pointe Park serve the western half of the city, while Père Gabriel Richard Elementary School and Brownell Middle School, both in Grosse Pointe Farms, serve the other half.

In 1893, the portion of the village east of Fisher Road broke off and incorporated as the Village of Grosse Pointe Farms after a dispute over the location of a tavern. It was not until 1949, however, that the village incorporated as a city.  Geography  Saint Paul on the Lake Catholic Church (1899) in Grosse Pointe Farms, one of many landmarks along Lakeshore Drive - French Gothic by Harry J. Rill. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The water is part of Lake St. Clair. The Farms has a more varied topography and streetscape than the other southern Grosse Pointes. While Grosse Pointe and Grosse Pointe Park are built on a standard street grid and are basically flat, Grosse Pointe Farms is partially built on the same grid flowing out of Detroit, but also features districts with irregular, curving street paths. A low but noticeable ridge runs through the center of the city. The Farms also contains the \\"point\\" in Grosse Pointe, where, just east of the Grosse Pointe War Memorial, there is a large bend in the lakeshore, such that those on the shoreline face east, instead of south, as they do when on the shoreline of neighboring Grosse Pointe, closer to the entrance of the Detroit River. The cityscape varies widely, with large sections of old homes ranging from bungalows to mansions, and a few newer sections with ranch houses or luxury homes built on subdivided estates. The Farms has a downtown on Kercheval Avenue combining historic buildings with newer, neo-traditional storefronts.

The population was 11,555 at the 2010 census. Bordering on Detroit with frontage on southern Lake Saint Clair, it is the westernmost of the noted Grosse Pointe suburbs, with the oldest overall housing stock of the five cities. Grosse Pointe Park is east of downtown Detroit and thus is home to many who commute to the city on a daily basis. The area is often referred to simply as 'GPP' or \\"The Park\\".  History  Before incorporation as a city, the area that would become the city of Grosse Pointe Park was incorporated as the Village of Fairview, which spanned Bewick Street in the west to Cadieux Road in the east in Grosse Pointe Township. The city of Detroit annexed part of the village in the township from Bewick Street to Alter Road in 1907. Fearing further annexation, the part of the village east of Alter Road incorporated as the Village of Grosse Pointe Park later that year. Seeking further annexation protection from Detroit and independence from its township, the village reincorporated as a city in 1950.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The water is part of Lake St. Clair. Grosse Pointe Park has about of borders with Detroit, with one border between Alter Road and Wayburn to the southwest, and another along Mack Avenue to the northwest; its third border on land is with the city of Grosse Pointe along Cadieux Road to the northeast.  Cityscape  The Buck-Wardwell House on Jefferson Avenue, built in 1840, as the first brick house in Grosse Pointe The neighborhoods in Grosse Pointe Park are built on a standard grid street pattern which flows out of Detroit, and housing ranges from tightly-packed single- and multi-family brick houses, often rentals, on the far west side of the Park, to rows of traditionally-styled single family homes generally averaging over , to multimillion-dollar mansions, some of which are found on the lakeshore. The west side of the city features mixed-use neighborhoods, where retail, schools, and churches are within close walking distance. The rest of the city is basically residential, but at the eastern edge residents are in close walking distance to \\"the Village\\" shopping district in Grosse Pointe. Many of the houses in the Park were built prior to World War II, and many of these were designed by noted architects using the finest materials. Windmill Pointe Drive, and streets such as Bishop, Kensington, Yorkshire, Edgemont Park, Three Mile Drive, Devonshire, Buckingham, Berkshire, Balfour, Middlesex, and Nottingham among others, each have dozens of large, architecturally significant homes. These mansions and mini-manses were often placed on large lots which were often split up, the result being that some post-war ranch style homes are mixed in with homes of traditional design. Windmill Pointe, circa 1900s Grosse Pointe Park includes a large neighborhood located on Windmill Pointe, the edge of which marks the entrance to the Detroit River and the end of Lake St. Clair. A large lakefront park with a pool, gym, movie theaters, and gathering spaces for residents only is found at this spot. At the base of the point, at the foot of Three Mile Drive, is another large park, Patterson Park, which is known for its skating rink and walking trails. One way that people distinguish geography in Grosse Pointe Park is by location north or south of Jefferson Avenue, the south side being generalized as Windmill Pointe. The Park also includes a section known as the \\"cabbage patch,\\" an area of town with densely-packed multi-family houses in contrast to the single-family homes with larger lots that populate the vast majority of the Grosse Pointes. The cabbage patch is generally considered to be the northwest corner of the city, bounded by Mack, Wayburn, Jefferson, and Somerset, with a small extension south of Jefferson on Nottingham and Beaconsfield. The region's name can be seen in various local establishments such as the Cabbage Patch Cafe and Cabbage Patch Saloon. Grosse Pointe Park, along with Grosse Pointe and Grosse Pointe Farms, is in the Grosse Pointe South High School district. There are two Grosse Pointe Public School System elementary schools in the Park: Defer and Trombly schools, in addition to one middle school: Pierce Middle School. The eastern Park is also served by Maire Elementary in Grosse Pointe in the Village district. Then serves the one high school, South High School off Fisher Road. There is one private school in the Park, the K-8 St. Clare of Montefalco Catholic School on Charlevoix and Audubon streets.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 22,423. Hamtramck is surrounded by the city of Detroit except for a small portion of the western border that touches the similarly surrounded city of Highland Park. Hamtramck is by far the most densely-populated municipality in the state of Michigan. Known in the 20th century as a vibrant center of Polish-American life and culture, Hamtramck has attracted new immigrants in the 21st century, especially from Yemen and Bangladesh. In 2015, it is said to have the first Muslim-majority city council in the history of the United States, with four of the six council members being Muslims. Name Hamtramck is named for the French-Canadian soldier Jean François Hamtramck, who was the first American commander of Fort Shelby, the fortification at Detroit. It was originally known as Hamtramck Township. History Hamtramck was originally settled by German farmers, but Polish immigrants moved into the area when the Dodge Brothers plant opened in 1914. Poles used to make up a large proportion of the population. It is sometimes confused with Poletown, a traditional Polish neighborhood, which used to lie mostly in the city of Detroit and includes a small part of Hamtramck. As of the 2010 American Community Survey, 14.5% of Hamtramck's population is of Polish origin whereas in 1970 it was 90% Polish.Seidner, Stanley S. (1976). In Quest of a Cultural Identity: An Inquiry for the Polish Community. New York: IUME, Teachers College, Columbia University. ISBN ERIC ED167674. Over the past thirty years, a large number of immigrants from the Middle East (especially Yemen), South Asia (especially Bangladesh), and Southeastern Europe (especially Bosnia and Herzegovina) have moved to the city. As of the 2010 American Community Survey, the city's foreign born population stood at 41.1%, making it Michigan's most internationally diverse city (see more at Demographics below). The population was 43,355 in the 1950 Census, and 18,372 in 1990. Hamtramck was primarily farmland, although the Detroit Stove Works employed 1,300 workers to manufacture stoves. In 1901, part of the township incorporated as a village to gain more control over the settlement's affairs, and by 1922 the village reincorporated as a city to fend off annexation attempts by the neighboring city of Detroit. By the mid-1920s, 78% of the residents of Hamtramck owned their own houses or were buying their houses.Vinyard, p. 184. Around that time, the factory workers made up 85% of Hamtramck's heads of households. Of those factory workers, about 50% were categorized as not skilled workers.Vinyard, p. 183-184. In 1910, the newly founded Dodge Main assembly plant created jobs for thousands of workers and led to additional millions of dollars in the city. Dodge Main quickly expanded and became important to Hamtramck. Before the construction of Dodge Main, Hamtramck was a largely rural town. With the establishment of the Dodge Main assembly plant came a large influx of Polish immigrants who pushed out the incumbent German politicians. It was after this that Hamtramck was considered a Polish-American town. By the end of the 20th century and the closing of Dodge Main, followed closely by General Motors razing of key parts of the polish neighborhoods, the ethnicity of the region quickly shifted from traditionally Polish descendants to new Middle Eastern and South Asian immigrants. By the elections of 2015, the city is said to have been the first to elect a Muslim-majority council in the country.  Geography  According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Hamtramck is mostly surrounded by Detroit except for its small common border with the city of Highland Park, which is in turn surrounded by Detroit. Hamtramck lies about from the center of Detroit. The I-75 freeway roughly runs along this city's western border and I-94 runs near its southern border. Furthermore, according the U.S Census Bureau, Hamtramck is bordered by Detroit starting from Carpenter Ave on the northwest end cutting the zip code 48212 into a fraction and chopping away streets from Conant St. to Dequindre St.. Then the border rides along Conant St. before it makes a big outward slash from Contant St. (Hamtramck devours Conant) towards Alpena Ave. Here is more from U.S Census Bureau:(You must zoom into Hamtramck to find it's Borders)  Culture  Hamtramck flourished from 1910 to 1920 as thousands of European immigrants, particularly Poles, were attracted by the growing automobile industry. The city has grown increasingly ethnically diverse but still bears many reminders of its Polish ancestry in family names, street names and businesses. A recent survey found 26 native languages spoken by Hamtramck schoolchildren. The city's motto was \\"A League of Nations\\". Neal Rubin of The Detroit News wrote in 2010 that despite the demographic changes, \\"In a lot of ways, Hamtramck still feels like a Polish enclave.\\"Rubin, Neal. \\"First-generation seniors at Hamtramck High adopt culture of prom .\\" The Detroit News.

In 1987, Detroit television station WDIV ran one episode of a local sit-com called Hamtramck which featured former Detroit Tigers pitcher Dave Rozema and a cameo by manager Sparky Anderson. It was met by poor reviews and protests by many Polish-Americans, and was canceled before airing a second episode. At the time of the 2000 census, Hamtramck was again experiencing considerable growth, with over 8,000 households and a population of almost 23,000.

In 1997, the Utne Reader named Hamtramck one of \\"the 15 hippest neighborhoods in the U.S. and Canada\\" in part for its punk and alternative music scene, its Buddhist temple, its cultural diversity, and its laid back blue-collar neighborhoods. In May 2003, Maxim Blender selected Hamtramck as the second \\"Most Rock N' Roll City\\" in the U.S., behind Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York City. Hamtramck is home of several of Michigan's most distinguished music venues. In January 2004, members of the Al-Islah Islamic Center requested permission to use loudspeakers for the purpose of broadcasting the Islamic call to prayer.

The current Hamtramck city hall is a former hospital building. In 1927 the Hamtramck Municipal Hospital, housed in a Georgian Revival building, opened.

The population was 11,776 at the 2010 census. Along with Hamtramck, the city is completely surrounded by Detroit. History The area that was to become Highland Park began as a small farming community, on a large ridge at what is now Woodward Avenue and Highland, north of Detroit. In 1818, prominent Detroit judge Augustus B. Woodward bought the ridge, and platted the village of Woodwardville in 1825. The development of the village failed. Another Detroit judge, Benjamin F. H. Witherell, son of Michigan Supreme Court justice James Witherell, attempted to found a village platted as Cassandra on this site in 1836, but this plan also failed. By 1860, the settlement was given a post office under the name of Whitewood. After a succession of closures and reopenings of the rural post office, the settlement was finally incorporated as a village within Greenfield Township and Hamtramck Township under the name of Highland Park in 1889.InfoMI.com, accessed April 18, 2007 Highland Park Ford Plant In 1907, Henry Ford purchased just north of Manchester Street between Woodward Avenue and Oakland Street to build an automobile plant. Construction of the Highland Park Ford Plant was completed in 1909, and the area's population dramatically increased in 1913, when Henry Ford opened the plant's first assembly line. The village of Highland Park was incorporated as a city in 1918City of Highland Park Official History to protect its tax base, including its successful Ford plant, from Detroit's expanding boundaries. In 1910, Highland Park, then a village, had 4,120 residents. Between 1910 and 1920 during the boom associated with the automobile industry, Highland Park's population grew to about 46,500, an increase of 1,081 percent, reaching its peak around 1927. The growth of Highland Park and neighboring Hamtramck broke records for increases of population; both municipalities withstood annexation efforts from Detroit.\\"Detroit Suburbs Ahead in Census.\\" The New York Times. May 16, 1920. Retrieved on April 11, 2009. In 1925, Chrysler Corporation was founded in Highland Park. It purchased the city's Brush-Maxwell plant, which would eventually expand to 150 acres and serve as the site of the company's headquarters for the next 70 years.Highland Park 2011 Master Plan , accessed 20 October 2011 Arthur Lupp of Highland Park founded the Michigan branch of the Black Legion in 1931; it was a secret vigilante group related to the Ku Klux Klan, which had been prominent in Detroit in the 1920s. The Legion had a similar nativist bent and its members were opposed to immigrants, Catholics, Jews, blacks, labor organizers, etc. Many public and business officials of Highland Park, including the chief of police, a mayor, and a city councilman, joined this group. Lupp and others were among the 48 men indicted and convicted following the murder of Charles Poole in May 1936; eleven were convicted in that murder. Investigations revealed the Legion had been involved in many other murders or conspiracies to murder during the previous three years, for which another 37 men were convicted.George Morris, \\"The Black Legion Rides\\", New York: Workers Library Publishers, August 1936, Internet Archive, accessed 16 September 2015Richard Bak, \\"The Dark Days of the Black Legion\\" , Hour Detroit magazine, March 2009, accessed 16 September 2015 These convictions ended the reign of the Legion. In 1944, the Davison Freeway was opened as the country's first modern depressed urban freeway, running through the center of the city. It was completely reconstructed and widened in 1996 and 1997 to improve its safety. Ford Motor Company demolished large sections of its Highland Park plant in the late 1950s. With the loss of industrial jobs, the city suffered many of the same difficulties as Detroit: declines in population and tax base accompanied by an increase in street crime. White flight from the city accelerated after the 1967 Detroit 12th Street Riot. Ford's last operation at the factory, the production of tractors at its Model T plant, was discontinued in 1973, and in 1981 the entire property was sold to a private developer for general industrial usage. The city population was majority black and impoverished by the 1980s. Chrysler, the city's last major private sector employer, moved its corporate headquarters from Highland Park to Auburn Hills between 1991 and 1993, paying the city $44 million in compensation. The move dislocated a total of 6,000 jobs over this period. Known as \\"The City of Trees,\\"Binelli, p. 182. the town was thickly forested until the 1970s. The spread of Dutch elm disease required many old trees to be cut down. From 2001 to 2009, the city was controlled by an emergency financial manager appointed by the State of Michigan because of Highland Park's mounting fiscal crisis. In August 2011, more than two-thirds of the streetlights in Highland Park were removed by the city, due to an inability to pay a $60,000 per month electric bill. The street lights were not only turned off, but decommissioned, or removed from their posts. The city advised residents to keep porch lights on to deter crime.Binelli, p. 183. In 2012, Mark Binelli, author of Detroit City is the Place to Be, wrote that Highland Park is \\"the Detroit of Detroit\\" due to being in an overall poorer condition than the City of Detroit. He stated that \\"[t]here was occasionally talk of Detroit absorbing Highland Park\\" but because the City of Detroit is uninterested in \\"adding more crime, blight, and desperately poor people to its own mean buffet of urban pathologies\\", the proposal to take Highland Park is \\"wishful thinking\\".

Government and infrastructure =Municipal services= Highland Park is governed under the council-mayor form of government wherein an elected mayor is the chief executive officer of the city, and the council its legislative body. The mayor appoints city officers such as the city attorney, the director of community and economic development, finance director, and the water department director, though, the council has the power to refuse or accept the appointments. The city council consists of five members elected at large who serve terms of four years. The highest vote getter becomes council president for that term.The Charter of the City of Highland Park (1968) The city levies an income tax of 2 percent on residents and 1 percent on nonresidents. However, using the Public Act 72 of 1990, Governor John Engler appointed an emergency financial manager to take over the city's financial operations in December 2000, effectively relegating the mayor, city council, and other elected public officers to advisory roles. Ramona Henderson-Pearson was appointed the city's first emergency financial manager. In 2002, Henderson-Pearson laid off most city workers. She shuttered several city buildings including the McGregor public library and the old Civic Center buildings on Gerald Street. Her successor, Arthur Blackwell, was appointed in 2005 and fired in April 2009 for over-payments that he received. The third and final emergency financial manager, Robert Mason, returned the city to local control in July 2009.\\"Mason Named Highland Park Financial Manager\\", Department of Treasury.

Given Highland Park's rapid growth and industrialization in the 1910s and 1920s, the police and the municipal government moved to purpose-built buildings in 1917 and 1927, respectively. The first municipal building was expanded and altered several times until it became the headquarters of the Highland Park Fire Department (HPFD), established in 1917. At its peak, the fire department employed about 84 firefighters and had four fire stations across the city.\\"Fire Department.\\" (Archive) City of Highland Park. Retrieved on November 1, 2013.

In 1984 the police and fire departments were merged into a Public Safety Department. The fire departments again became a separate entity in 2005. By that time, the headquarters building on Gerald Street was deemed uninhabitable. The department moved to an old, 40000 sq. ft. warehouse at 12900 Oakland Park Boulevard, near Oakland Avenue and the Davison Freeway at the edge of the city, where it remained until 2013.

In 1860 a new post office was opened with the name Catville but changed its name to New Boston by 1868. Other early settlements included Belden, platted in 1857 by Frances J. Belden and now known as Willow, and Waltz, platted in 1872 by Joseph Waltz. On March 17, 1835 the northeastern portion of Huron Township was set off and organized as Romulus Township. Within a few weeks, on April 6, 1835, the northwestern portion of the township became Van Buren Township. On April 6, 1840 the western half of the remaining portion of Huron Township organized as the township of Sumpter, creating the current boundaries of township. The Waltz Road–Huron River Bridge, first constructed in 1924 and later replaced in 2017, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A post office named \\"Moulin Rouge\\" was established there in December 1857. Robert Inkster, a Scotsman born March 27, 1828, in Lerwick, Shetland, operated a steam sawmill on present-day Inkster Road near Michigan Avenue in the early 1860s. The post office was renamed \\"Inkster\\" in July 1863. The village had a station on the Michigan Central Railroad by 1878. It incorporated as a village in 1926 from parts of Nankin Township and Dearborn Township. After much legal wrangling by the city of Dearborn, Dearborn Township, and the village of Inkster to sort out final borders for these communities, Inkster was incorporated as a city in 1964. In the 1920s and 1930s, African-Americans working in Henry Ford's Dearborn factories settled in Inkster, as it was closer to their work than Detroit, while they were not allowed to live in Dearborn itself.Binelli, p. 25. \\"The blacks working at the Rouge didn't necessarily want to commute all the way from Detroit but they weren't welcome in Dearborn, so they began settling in the regrettably named suburb of Inkster (which in fact commemorates an early Scottish settler, Robert Inkster).\\" As a result of the police beating of Floyd Dent in January 2015, which was caught on a police vehicle's dash cam and released to the public, the victim was awarded $1.4 million.

The population was 28,497 at the 2010 census. The City of Northville is adjacent to the northern part of the township but is administratively autonomous. Portions of Northville Township were incorporated into the Village of Northville, which later incorporated as the City of Northville. Portions of the township have also since been annexed to the city. The most recent annexation was property owned by the City of Northville as part of the Rural Hill Cemetery. A majority of the township is served by Northville Public Schools. A small portion of the township is served by Plymouth-Canton Community Schools. The entire township is served by the Northville District Library and by its own police and fire departments. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.96%, is water. History While the village of Northville developed within the borders of Plymouth Township from the 1820s, Northville Township itself did not exist until 1898. At that time, local residents, allegedly feeling slighted by Plymouth Township officials being more focused on Plymouth Village, decided to split off into a separate township. In this way, the former Plymouth \\"SuperTownship\\" (which formerly included all of Canton, Plymouth, and Northville Townships) became split into Plymouth Township and Northville Township. Northville Township later became a charter township in 1985. =ZIP code= In response to the rapid growth of the township, a new 48168 ZIP code was introduced in June 2005 to those living south of Seven Mile Road. Those living on or north of the road (as well as those living in the city of Northville) kept the 48167 zip code, as well as any residents with a 48170 ZIP code (Plymouth). =2009 budget crisis and proposed public safety layoffs= In late September 2009, just more than a month after the hospital property purchase, the Northville Township Board of Trustees stated that they were operating with a budget deficit. The Board began the process of asking department heads and directors to find ways to cut their budgets. One of the proposed cuts was the laying off of 5 police officers and 2 public safety dispatchers, roughly a 15-20% reduction in police manpower. The Northville Township police union went door-to-door passing out flyers to educate the public on the board proposed cuts and to invite the public to voice their opinions on the issue to the township Board of Trustees. On October 1, 2009, Northville Township residents voiced their displeasure over proposed public safety cuts on the 2010 budget. Several of the residents in attendance criticized the Township Board of Trustees for not doing more to maintain the public safety department. Board members came under scrutiny for supporting the August ballot initiative to buy the of the former Northville Regional Psychiatric Hospital property, knowing that there was a budget shortfall. Several residents argued that the Board should have asked for a millage to support their current level of service, instead of asking voters to support the land purchase. Township trustees stated that the two issues were unrelated.http://www.hometownlife.com On October 15, 2009, a little more than two months after the Psychiatric Hospital property vote, the Northville Township Board of Trustees approved the 2010 fiscal budget. The budget, as approved, authorized the laying off of 5 police officers and 2 public safety dispatchers. The budget also required many of the township's non-union employees to take mandatory furlough days. In an attempt to prevent police layoffs, a local lottery winner proposed to give Northville Township the money necessary to make up for the alleged public safety budget deficit, approximately $640,000. The Board of Trustees turned down the offer stating that one of its conditions, the maintenance of current public safety staffing, was not a condition they could legally accept. The Board of Trustees stated that if the police officers’ union were to agree to concessions, then the layoffs would be avoided. Residents continued to publicly voice their displeasure with the Board’s decision, with some residents even suggesting a possible campaign to recall the members of the township board.http://www.hometownlife.com/article/20091022/NEWS12/910220430/1029/D.A.R.E.+program+to+be+cuthttp://www.hometownlife.com/article/20091022/NEWS12/910220427/1029/Township+going+to+try+to+limit+layoffshttp://www.hometownlife.com/article/20091022/NEWS12/910220426/1029/Lottery+winner+s+proposed+gift+falls+through Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 21,036 people, 8,119 households, and 5,569 families residing in the township.

It was built in 1952 and was closed in 2003. =2002–2006= It was announced that the NRPH was to be closed by the Department of Community Health (DCH) on November 18, 2002. By May 2003 all patients had been transferred to a community setting or another state run psychiatric facility. Due to ineffective controls and oversight of the NRPH's closing in 2003, and purchasing, receiving, and payment processes, there is still much unused and used equipment left in the buildings that lost all value during storage. The hospital was closed because of several reasons. First, a declining number of patients in the statewide mental health system. Second, a decline in the workforce, resulting from an early retirement rate, caused the hospital to be shut down. At the time of the closing NPH had 536 employees and 239 patients. The property was sold in a May 2005 auction to REI/Schostak (REIS) for $31.5 million. =2007–2008= In October 2007, the sale of the property to REIS was closed. REIS planned to develop the property into an $800 million, mixed-use residential, office, and retail development called 'Highwood'. Due to the fact that Northville Township would only allow a scaled-down version of Highwood, REIS moved employees to the property in mid-October 2007 for security and to vote to annex the property into neighboring Livonia on August 5, 2008, which approved the original plans for Highwood. Northville and Northville Township residents largely opposed the annexation, which was possible without their consent. Only residents of the area being annexed and the city/township trying to annex the area could vote in the annexation. Residents of the Township started an organization known as 'Stop Annexation'. On August 5, 2008, the residents of the property and Livonia voted against annexation. =2009–present= On August 4, 2009, residents of Northville Township voted to purchase a majority of the property for $23.5 million. REIS will retain to develop into or less of retail. An owner of a house worth $300,000 would see a tax increase of $144 (per year). Using REIS tax dollars, Northville Township will clean the property extensively. The property will become open, natural space with trails. http://www.detnews.com/article/20090805/METRO02/908050373/1009/rss02 The main building of the hospital is being demolished by Adamo Demolition but due to higher level of asbestos than anticipated the demolition is delayed and expected to commence in 2019.

The population was 9,132 at the 2010 census. The city of Plymouth is surrounded by Plymouth Township, but the two are administered autonomously. Plymouth is a western suburb of Metro Detroit and is located about west of the city of Detroit. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. It is located east of Ann Arbor and west of Detroit, just south of the M-14 highway and west of Interstate 275. Culture The City of Plymouth has a variety of shops and restaurants surrounding Kellogg Park, the de facto center of town. The Inn at St. John's, a hotel conference center and golf resort, is located in Plymouth. The city offers more than fifty recreation programs for all age groups, an NHL-size ice arena and twelve parks. It also organizes major community events such as the popular Fall Festival, Ice Sculpture Spectacular and the Art in the Park, and access to the Plymouth-Canton school district, with a unique complex composed of three high schools located on one campus and is now one of the highest populated high school campuses in the country with close to 6500 students and over 800 faculty members. The Barefoot Productions theater company is located on Main Street. alt= The Plymouth Ice Spectacular, the largest and oldest ice carving festival in North America, is held every year in Plymouth in late January. Founded in 1982 by then 25-year-old Scott Lorenz, the weekend-long event draws an average of 500,000 people to Plymouth each year and has helped establish ice carving as a world-class competitive event. Since 2008, Plymouth has been home to the Green Street Fair, held over a weekend each May. Featuring green-themed exhibitors and activities, the event has become a yearly tradition. In 2011, the event was attended by about 90,000 visitors. Plymouth's \\"Art in the Park\\" is Michigan's second largest art fair. Visitors have enjoyed Plymouth Art in the Park since its inaugural event in 1980. Plymouth Art in the Park, founded, directed and managed by mother and daughter team Dianne Quinn and Raychel Rork, celebrated its 33rd show in 2012. The event hosts over 450 artists and 300,000 attendees each year. Another very popular community tradition/event is Plymouth's Fall Festival. This annual event is held the weekend after Labor Day. The Fall Festival is an event for all ages with numerous rides and other attractions. Other events include Plymouth's \\"Music in the Air\\", held every Friday night June through September, beginning at approximately 7:00 pm, showcasing a number of bands performing a wide variety of music. The Historic Old Village hosts events such as \\"Bumpers Bikes and Bands\\", the \\"Old Village Restaurant Crawl\\", and the family-friendly \\"Haunted Halloween\\" on Liberty Street. The Old Village is located on Plymouth's north side and borders Hines Park. History Plymouth was first settled in 1825, incorporated as a village in 1867, and became a city in 1932. = Foundation = The first settlers to come to what is now known as Plymouth, Michigan, were Keziah (Benjamin) and William Starkweather. Farmers from Preston, Connecticut, they purchased of land from the United States government on March 11, 1825, for $1.25 per acre. The Starkweather clan had lived in Preston at least as early as 1694, according to records of a land gift in which Captain John Masons gave land to Robert Starkweather, William's grandfather. William, ninth born of 11 siblings, and his wife Keziah brought their firstborn son Albert to the area and built the first home in Plymouth, at what is now the southwest corner of Main Street and Ann Arbor Trail. The first home was a lean-to, and was later replaced by a log cabin, which has since been lost to time. William's eldest son Albert died at age 20 while attending the newly formed University of Michigan as a sophomore. George Anson Starkweather, William's second-born, was the first non-Native American born within the boundaries of what is now known as the city of Plymouth. His father William died at 44 years of age, from typhoid fever, and his mother Keziah two years later, leaving their eldest son George at 20 years of age. William and Keziah's home in Old Village (circa 1835) is located at 557 North Mill Street. The history section of the City of Plymouth website indicates that The City of Plymouth was settled by Luther Lincoln on April 2, 1825, though according to the United States Department of the interior – Bureau of Land Management, in a letter from Mr William H. Richards, Director and Chief, Branch of Surveys, in his letter to Karl Starkweather dated April 29, 1954, he states that upon inspection of the tract books held by the Bureau: \\"Of interest to you personally are the notations of the CASH entries Nos. 1195, 1199, 2991, and 3241 of William Starkweather, for SW1/4 sec. 26, E1/2SE1/4, sec. 27 E1/2NW1/4 sec. 25, E1/2SW1/4 sec. 34 respectively on March 11, 1825, March 14, 1825, April 29, 1829 and February 15, 1830.\\" The two 1825 parcels that Starkweather purchased from the federal Government totaled . Luther Lincoln, on the other hand, was granted two land patents by the federal government in 1825. One was in town 1 south, range 8 east, for an parcel – the north east quarter of the Western half of section 33, and an additional parcel in Town 1 South, Range 9 east, which is roughly the core of the city of present-day Wayne. Lincoln's former parcel ranged both inside and outside of the present boundaries of the City of Plymouth. The land was roughly bounded on the west side by present-day Mill Street, extended east to a border near or at the present Riverside park, on the north by the CSX Tracks, and on the south approximately by an east–west line drawn at the point where Mill Street (Lilley road) intersects with Union street near where the entrance of Riverside Park is. Regardless of when his land patent was granted, Lincoln built his place of business, his saw mill, and abode, near the eastern boundary of his land, along the Rouge River. His actual abode and saw mill was always outside the city limits. William Starkweathers home however, was at the very center of town, on the South West corner of Main and Ann Arbor Trail, at the exact site where Panera bread is today. Therefore, since Starkweather's home was always within city Limits, and since Lincoln's home and place of business, his saw mill, which was built along the Rouge River, were always outside the city limits of Plymouth, William, who brought his entire family with him and built a lean to at the Panera site as the first home, was the first settler within city limits. = Growth = In 1830, William purchased an parcel of land on Plymouth Road, outside of the present Plymouth city limits, where the Unisys plant now stands. William and Keziah then sold their land in downtown Plymouth and in 1831 purchased an parcel of land in what was then called \\"North Village\\" (now called \\"The Historic Old Village\\") from John Norris Jr, whom originally purchased the tract from the federal Government. Four years later, William sold this same tract of land in Old Village to his brother Erastus at over a 400 percent profit. Two years later, Erastus sold it back to his brother William at a profit. In 1831, William then purchased an parcel of land, now bordered by Joy Road, Baywood, Ann Arbor Road and Sheldon Roads. That same year he purchased an parcel of Land in Nankin Township, in the area of present-day Westland, in the approximate area of just north of the Warren and Hix Roads intersection bordered by the east side of Hix. He also jointly with David Rider purchased an tract of Land in Livonia, on Plymouth Road, the land now occupied by the Ford Motor Company Livonia Transmission Plant. In 1844, William died. Two years later his wife Keziah died. The land in Old Village was then passed to William's son, George A Starkweather. After his marriage to Lydia (Liddy) Amelia Heywood in 1861, George Anson Starkweather and R. G. Hall were partners in a general store facing Kellogg Park. The partnership dissolved in 1870, and George built a dry goods store on the southeast corner of Liberty Street and Oak Street (now Starkweather), which he operated until 1901. George's wife, Lydia Amelia Heywood, was the adopted daughter of Mary Davis, of Plymouth. Liddy, as she was known as a little girl, was born in Wayne, Michigan, and was adopted at age 4 by Mary Davis after both of her parents died of typhoid. Lydia Amelia Heywood was also known as Amelia Davis prior to marriage, as she took on the Davis family name. George felt that the railroad coming to North Village would give it a commercial advantage over the Kellogg Park area. In the 1860s, he convinced the Detroit and Howell Railroad Company to build through the town. The first actual construction on the entire (east–west) D & H line began in Plymouth on February 6, 1867, at a ceremony where a cherry wood tie was fashioned on the spot and laid on the center line of the road, at Shearers Cut. Work during the time of the D&H; was never completed; the line was completed under a new company. The Detroit and Howell Railroad was merged into the Detroit, Howell and Lansing Railroad, and later merged into the Detroit, Lansing and Lake Michigan Railroad. It was under the DL & LM RR that the line between Detroit and Lansing was opened for public use, in August 1871. At the end of 1876, after operating for only five years, the DL & LM went into receivership and was reorganized as the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad. The DL&N; was then merged into the Detroit, Grand Rapids and Western Rail Road, which was finally merged into the Pere Marquette Railway in January 1900. The PM was in 1947 merged into the C & O, which later became the Chessie System, and as of 1987, is now known as CSX. , over Plymouth's 144-year history in Michigan railroading, the east–west line through Plymouth had been operated under nine different names. The history section of the City of Plymouth, MI web site states that the railroad station in Plymouth, was built by the \\"Pere Marquette Railroad\\" in 1871. This is not entirely accurate. The \\"Pere Marquette Railroad\\", did not exist until 1899. Although the \\"Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad\\", was chartered in 1857, PM did not take over operations of the lines through plymouth, nor did it build anything along the lines, until during or after 1900, with the merger of three railroad lines – the \\"Flint and Pere Marquette\\", the \\"Detroit, Grand Rapids and Western\\", and the \\"Chicago and West Michigan\\" Railways. The north–south rail line through Plymouth was built by the Holly, Wayne and Monroe Railway. After construction was complete, The Holly, Wayne and Monroe Railway merged into the Flint and Pere Marquette system, May 30, 1871. In 1900, both lines (north–south and east–west) that ran through Plymouth, came under ownership of the newly formed Pere Marquette railway as stated above. The first ever steam locomotive that pulled into Plymouth, came from Wayne, Michigan on the north–south line, on April 27, 1871, and was known as the Grand \\"Excursion\\" by rail. So at least on that day, the Holly, Wayne and Monroe Railway was in actual operation. The source for this first steam locomotive that came to Plymouth, comes from Celestia Young's diary entry of that date, in which she states, \\"A lovely showery day. I tried to see instead of working out of doors, Grand 'Excursion' to Plymouth by rail – this afternoon – Wayne Brass Band & Star Spangled-Banners.\\" Celestia was the sister in law of Jehial Davis (Step Father to George Starkweather's wife Lydia Amelia), and was a close family friend of the Starkweather family, whom for a time was a housekeeper for George A Starkweather. Celestia was known as \\"Aunt Celestia\\", to the grand children of George, and was as a sister, to George Starkweather's wife Amelia. Starkweather was responsible for cutting Oak Street North through his farm in order to reach his new store and the train station. After his death in 1907, Oak Street was renamed Starkweather in his honor. In addition to his other pursuits George Starkweather took an active civic role. He served as a member of the State Legislature in 1854, had several terms as Township Supervisor, 16 years as Justice of the Peace, and was Plymouth Village President in 1898. George Starkweather's grandson, Karl Hillmer Starkweather (who changed his name from Karl Starkweather Hillmer), was a respected and lifelong Plymouth resident and local historian, and Ford Motor Company employee at the Wilcox Lake Tap Plant in which he was shop steward. He died on May 1, 1969. His father, Lewis Hillmer, also served as village president for a time. Notable streets in Plymouth are named after some Starkweather family members, including Blanche (after Blanche Starkweather, daughter of George Starkweather), Karmada (after the grandchildren of George Starkweather – Karl, Max and Davis), Davis – after Davis B Hillmer – youngest grandson of George Starkweather, Starkweather (formerly Oak Street), Amelia (after Lydia Amelia Heywood – Davis -Starkweather) – George Starkweather's wife, and Rose – after Rose Hillmer, eldest grand daughter of George Starkweather. Starkweather Elementary School was named after George Anson Starkweather of Plymouth, which was converted to an adult education center. It was the first elementary school built in Plymouth largely through the efforts of grandson Karl Starkweather, who promoted the need for a ward school in Plymouth to local residents. Karl's wife, Mary E Starkweather, and Karl's mother (George's daughter Mary K. Starkweather – Hillmer), were charter members of the Plymouth Historical Society. Daisy Manufacturing Company, now Daisy Outdoor Products, started in 1882 in Plymouth as the Plymouth Iron Windmill Company. In 1886 Plymouth inventor Clarence Hamilton introduced a new idea to the windmill company. It was a combination of metal and wire, vaguely resembling a gun that could fire a lead ball using compressed air. Lewis Cass Hough, then president of the firm, gave it a try and, after his first shot, enthusiastically exclaimed, \\"Boy, that's a daisy!\\" The name stuck, and the BB gun went into production as a premium item given to farmers when they purchased a windmill. The gun was such a huge success that Plymouth Iron Windmill soon began manufacturing the Daisy BB gun in place of windmills. On January 26, 1895, the company's board of directors officially voted to change the name to Daisy Manufacturing Company, Inc. = Recent history = Much to the dismay of Plymouth residents, Daisy moved its corporate offices and manufacturing facilities from Plymouth to Rogers, Arkansas in 1958. In 2003 the former Daisy factory was converted to Daisy Square Condominiums despite being situated next to an active freight rail line. The front wall of the Daisy factory was left standing to be built into the apartment building. The wall has since been demolished. In 2009 Plymouth Township was named 28th Best Place to Live in the United States by CNN Money Magazine.

The population was 48,362 at the 2010 census. History Springwells Township and Bucklin Township were formally organized and laid out by gubernatorial act on April 12, 1827. Postal regulations prohibiting two post offices having the same name required, when a township was subdivided, unique names had to be found. The Bucklin name was extinguished when it was split on October 29, 1829 along what is now Inkster Road into Nankin Township (west half) and Pekin Township (east half), named as a result of a wave of interest in China. In March 1833, Pekin was renamed Redford and the southern half became Dearborn Township on April 1. The name Redford was chosen because Indians and pioneers forded the River Rouge where the river runs through Redford.Burton, Clarence M. et al., The City of Detroit, Michigan, 1701-1922, vol. 2., p. 1581. (Detroit: S.J. Clarke, 1922) \\"Rouge\\" is French for \\"red.\\" The township used to go all the way to Greenfield Road, but in the 1920s the eastern portions of the township were annexed by Detroit. This annexation ceased in 1926 when the township was given \\"charter\\" status by the Michigan legislature. In 1918 there was a post office named \\"Five Points\\" operating between 6 Mile Road and 7 Mile Road along the road of that name. Redford is the site of Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School, whose hiring practices spurred the 2012 Supreme Court Case Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v.

The population was 7,903 at the 2010 census. It is named after the River Rouge (from the French \\"rouge\\" meaning red), which flows along the city's northern border and into the Detroit River. The city includes the heavily industrialized Zug Island at the mouth of the River Rouge. History The small settlement incorporated as a village in 1899 within Ecorse Township. In 1922 as the city of Detroit expressed interest in annexing land in the township, the Village of River Rouge incorporated as a city on April 3 to avoid being annexed. A month later Detroit completed annexation of land in the township immediately to the west of River Rouge. One of the most important historical associations with River Rouge is its relationship to a Great Lakes freighter, the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, which sank in 1975 in a fierce storm in Lake Superior, with the loss of all 29 crew. The ship was constructed in 1958 at the Great Lakes Engineering Works in River Rouge and was the largest ship on the lakes at the time. The city had its peak of population in 1950, when industry was the mainstay of the local economy. Restructuring of heavy industry and movement of jobs offshore have taken a toll of the city; the loss of jobs resulted in loss of population. In 2015 the population is less than half of what it was in 1950. Many workers who had the flexibility to seek jobs in other areas moved away. Outward migration has resulted in a shift in the racial demographics of the city. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Riverview was incorporated as a village in 1923 and became a city in 1959. History The August 9, 1812 Battle of Monguagon between Americans and a British-Indian coalition took place in today's Riverview. Native Americans were led by the famous Shawnee warrior Tecumseh, who was wounded in the engagement. The Americans gained a tactical victory at Monguagon but suffered a strategic defeat when US forces returned to Detroit after the fight without reopening their supply line to Ohio. Much of the location remains undeveloped in a green area bounded by Pennsylvania Road to the north, Colvin Street to the south, Electric Avenue to the east, and Vreeland Park to the west, which is also part of the battlefield. In 1950, Riverview only stretched as far west as the western end of Trenton's two northern boundaries. The rest of what is today Riverview was still part of the unincorporated Monguagon Township at that point.1950 Census. Population Vol. 1. pp. 22–32 In the 1950s and 1960s, during the Cold War, the Department of Defense (through the United States Army) operated Nike missile launch site D-54 on the site of what is now Young Patriot's Park.

The population was 30,047 at the 2010 census. Southgate was incorporated as a city in October 1958, which was one of the last remaining portions of the now- defunct Ecorse Township. History Pierre Michel Campau was the first white settler in Southgate. He moved into the area in 1795, which subsequently became a farming community. Other people from the Detroit area at the Rouge and Detroit Rivers followed him to Southgate. Historically a rural area of Ecorse Township, the areas within present-day Southgate were originally platted with street grids beginning in the 1920s - though most developments did not start until just after World War II. Among the oldest residential areas in the city is the Old Homestead neighborhood, on the east side. There are two accounts of the city's name: Southgate is described in local guides as being the \\"South Gate\\" or entrance to the Metro Detroit area. \\"A metropolitan daily picture story\\" in late 1956 also gave this explanation.\\"'Schaferson' Suggested for Township City.\\" Wyandotte Tribune, December 6, 1956.

At the 2010 census, the city population was 18,853. A Shawnee village was built in the area by war chief Blue Jacket after the 1795 Treaty of Greenville. The area later became the site of the Battle of Monguagon between Americans and a British-Indian coalition during the War of 1812. The battle is commemorated with a Michigan State Historical Site marker in present-day Elizabeth Park, which was the first county park in Michigan when it was established in 1919. Portions of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge are within the southern portion of Trenton. The area was once part of the now-defunct Monguagon Township. Trenton was incorporated as a village in 1855 and again as a city in 1957. The city is part of the Downriver collection of communities south of Detroit on the west bank of the Detroit River. Trenton is known for its waterfront and growing boating community. Major industries include Chrysler Trenton Engine Plant, Solutia, and the Trenton Channel Power Plant. Beaumont Hospital – Trenton is located within city limits and has 203 beds. The former McLouth Steel plant is also located in the city. The city operates the Trenton Veterans Memorial Library and a historical museum. History The founder of Trenton is considered to be Abram Caleb Truax, a member of the territorial militia in attendance when General William Hull surrendered Detroit to the British General Isaac Brock early in the War of 1812. After the war, in 1816, Truax acquired a large tract of land in the Michigan Territory along the Detroit River from the U.S. government and constructed a sawmill, church and store in what is today downtown Trenton. When Territorial Governor Lewis Cass organized Monguagon Township in 1827, Truax became the first Township Supervisor. He laid out the village of Truaxton in 1834. A post office had been established there named \\"Monguago\\" in 1828 with Truax as the first postmaster. The post office name was changed to \\"Truago\\" in 1837, and to \\"Trenton\\" in 1847, after a type of limestone mined from a local quarry. The village was platted and recorded under the name Trenton in 1850 by Abram Truax's son and daughter George Brigham Truax and Sophia Slocum, the wife of industrialist Giles Slocum. The Slocum family estate was given to the county, becoming what is known as Elizabeth Park, named after Elizabeth Slocum. In 1834 an industrialist, Giles Bryan Slocum, constructed a dock, making Trenton a major hub of steamboat traffic. In 1846, Capt. Arthur Edwards founded the Detroit & Cleveland Steamboat Company in Trenton. Through the late 1880s Trenton, like several Downriver communities, was known for its extensive shipyards. Sibley, Michigan would not be incorporated into Trenton until 1929. Trenton was incorporated as a village in 1855. A Detroit businessman and later Michigan's first U.S. attorney, Solomon Sibley, started a limestone quarry near Trenton, near what is today Fort Street and Sibley Road. Materials from the quarry were used to construct structures in Detroit, most notably Fort Detroit along the Detroit River. The quarry was later sold to Austin Church, who used limestone to make baking soda, which he sold under his family's nameplate, Arm & Hammer. In 1900 the quarry was the site of the Sibley Quarry explosion. Through the late 1880s and even early 1900s, Trenton prospered because it was roughly a day's journey between Detroit and Monroe, Michigan, which meant people traveling between the two cities would have to stop overnight in Trenton. Trenton annexed the village of Sibley (along the modern Riverview border) in 1929, extending the city's northern boundary to modern- day Sibley Road. Trenton was incorporated as a city in 1957. In 1920 a small light railroad ran along West Jefferson to Wyandotte. The rail services ended in 1934. The tracks were removed in 1942 for the war effort.

It is owned by Detroit Edison, a subsidiary of DTE Energy. It had 6 turbine generators with 13 coal-fired boilers when first commissioned. Each unit produced a rated 50 megawatts of electricity. Five short smoke stacks exhausted gases from the boilers. These were the first Detroit Edison units to use pulverized coal rather than the older style stoker-fired beds of coal. They were also the first power plants in the US to use electrostatic precipitators to capture fly ash from the stacks. Electrostatic precipitators, however, were in use in other industries at the time. In 1950, a second plant started up at the same site and adjoined the first plant. It had two turbine generators, #7 and #8, with a rating of 120 megawatts each. Two short smoke stacks released gases from the four boilers. Finally in 1968, Unit #9 was placed in service. It is a 550-megawatt turbine generator fed by a single boiler. It adjoins the high side plant and is located on the south side. One 563-foot-tall smoke stack is used for this unit. Soon afterwards, another stack, identical to the #9 stack, was erected to replace the two short stacks on the high side plant. Both tall stacks remain in service as of 2012. The characteristic striped smokestacks were constructed with an innovative “smokestack within a smokestack” design to reduce the level of pollutants released. The inner smokestacks were lined with asbestos to achieve this, which ended up later being removed at great cost. The plant strives to keep its area pollutant-free. In 2002, the facility was designated a corporate wildlife habitat by the Wildlife Habitat Council. Because of their efforts, the Trenton Channel Power Plant and Sibley Quarry were co-awarded the Wildlife Habitat Council's Corporate Habitat of the Year award in 2004. By the mid-1970s, the low side plant was decommissioned and the boiler house was eventually demolished. In the 2010s, all generators except #9 were closed. The power plant is scheduled to close by 2023, because DTE Energy is planning to change to natural gas and renewable energy power plants.DTE to shut down three coal plants within 7 years, Frank Witsil, Detroit Free Press, June 8, 2016 =McLouth Steel Trenton Plant= Aerial view of the McLouth Steel Plant in Trenton In 1948, McLouth Steel purchased riverfront land along Jefferson Avenue to begin building its second complex. Between the land purchase and the buildout, the project cost more than $100 million and by 1949, the first ingots were poured at the site. By 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill.

McLouth ultimately shuttered for good in 1996, and with it, the Trenton Plant. The plant was sold later that year to the Detroit Steel Company. Through the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. The plant's many failed startup attempts led to Wayne County's 2017 foreclosure on the site, after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes. MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing its port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways. The site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List in May 2019.. Demolition and cleanup is currently being led by Crown Enterprises and overseen by the EPA and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE). All buildings are scheduled to be demolished by December 2020. =Beaumont Hospital= A Beaumont Hospital opened up on Fort Street in 1961 as a community hospital in Trenton. Specialties there include diabetes and endocrinology, gastroenterology and GI surgery, geriatrics, nephrology, neurology and neurosurgery, orthopedics, pulmonology and urology. =Trenton Engine Plant= The Trenton Engine Plant is a Chrysler factory in Trenton, Michigan. The north factory opened in 1952 and underwent major expansion in 1969. Trenton Engine was the site chosen for production of the 2.2 L four- cylinder engine which debuted in 1980 in the K-cars. In 1985, the north factory underwent another expansion, and later in 2005, Daimler Chrysler reportedly invested $297 million in order to expand the Trenton Engine plant to prepare to build a new 4.0 L version of the SOHC V6 and to also revitalize the 3.8 line. The north factory stopped manufacturing engines in May 2011, and Chrysler announced that it would invest $114 million to repurpose one-fifth or nearly 400,000 square feet of the plant for the production of core components for the Pentastar V-6 engine. In November 2012, the company announced that it would invest an additional $40 million to add a flexible production line that can run both the Pentastar engine and the Tigershark (I-4) engine. The south factory opened in 2010. Its current product is the 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine, and the 2.0L FCA Global Medium Engine L4 engine. Education Trenton has four public schools with more than 3,000 students total. * Anderson Elementary School * Hedke Elementary school * Arthurs Middle School (formerly known as Monguagon Middle School) * Trenton High School A portion of Trenton, north of King Road, is in the Riverview Community School District.

In October 1980, the city of Trenton made an attempt to auction off the building and property, but the auction was canceled after the rear of the building was broken into and vandalized, according to the Trenton Times newspaper. The headstone of the building was nearly destroyed when the building was demolished in October 1980, but an effort by then-councilman William Muddiman rescued the piece from utter destruction, according to the Trenton Times. The headstone with the school's name that once hung above the entrance of the school currently rests at the front of the Slocum Truax Park. It is the last remaining piece of the former school.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 17,593. Wayne has a long history of automotive and transportation related manufacturing. Ford Motor Company currently has two plants here; Wayne Stamping & Assembly and the Michigan Assembly Plant, formerly known as the Michigan Truck Plant. State Wayne Theater (1946) Michigan Assembly Plant History The site of Wayne was crossed by the Sauk Trail, and due to this, the area was visited by Potawatomi and French fur traders for years before permanent settlement. The first settler was George M. Johnson, who built a small log cabin on 80 acres of land in 1824 (a state historical marker can now be found at the site). The cabin served as a tavern for travelers along the trail, by then known as the Chicago Road. The area soon became known as Johnson's Tavern. After a few years, the tavern was sold to Stephen G. Simmons, who continued to operate the business until he murdered his wife while in a drunken rage. Simmons was arrested and taken to Detroit, where he was tried and hanged September 24, 1830. He became the last person to be executed in Michigan by Michigan, as the territory abolished capital punishment shortly thereafter. In 1832, Ezra Derby bought the tavern and land from the Simmons heirs and began establishing a settlement. Derby built a sawmill, store, mill, blacksmith shop and the first frame dwelling for himself. In 1834, a plat was recorded in Detroit with lots and a town square under the name Derby's Corners. In 1836, the name of the settlement was changed to Wayne, in honor of Revolutionary War General Anthony Wayne. Soon a small hamlet began to develop, which was accelerated by the arrival of the Michigan Central Railroad in 1838. The Chicago Road that ran through Wayne was paved with oak logs in 1850, becoming the Detroit and Saline Plank Road. In 1867 it was changed to its current name of Michigan Avenue. In 1869, Wayne was incorporated as a village with a population of about 800 people. (In 1960 Wayne officially became a city.) Many major industries have located in the village over the years. The Prouty and Glass Carriage Factory was the first, moving from Detroit in 1888. At the time, this made Wayne the largest carriage and sleigh producer in the country. In 1899, the Detroit interurban railroad (a streetcar system connecting Detroit to outlying towns) reached Wayne and ran until 1929. Ray Harroun, winner of the first Indianapolis 500, built the Harroun motor car in Wayne from 1916–21. The Gotfredson Truck was produced from 1924–27, and The Graham-Paige car company made vehicles in Wayne from 1928–36. Stinson Aircraft was also located at the nearby Detroit Industrial Airport and produced small planes from 1926–48. The Michigan Assembly Plant was built in 1957, and the Gar-Wood company built garbage trucks and hydraulic equipment from 1947–72. Other major companies located in Wayne include Unistrut and Wayne Industries. The population and industrial production around Wayne significantly increased after World War II.Hodson, Archie, ed., Columbia Gazeteer of the United States and Canada, (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995) p. 704 Education The Wayne- Westland Community School District operates public schools serving the city.

History =Early history= The Octagon House, part of the Westland Historical Park Nankin Mills The Westland Center M-153) in central Westland, MI During the 18th century, the area was inhabited by the people of a Potawatomi Native American village. Other tribes, particularly three Algonquian tribes, used the area as hunting territory. Before becoming Westland, the area had several other names. Though white settlers did not begin to settle the area until about 1824, they began passing through at the beginning of the 19th century. Bucklin Township was first organized in 1827 and included what is now the cities of Westland, Livonia, Garden City, Inkster, Wayne, Dearborn, Dearborn Heights and Redford Township. The Norwayne subdivision is one of the oldest areas of the city, having existed for over 65 years. The area was built immediately after World War II to provide temporary housing for returning soldiers who worked in nearby factories. In late 2009 the City of Westland received $2.061 million to radically clean up, restore and rehabilitate this historic district. This is through Stimulus/Recovery funds and was allocated under the NSP - Neighborhood Stabilization Program of 2008. Please see the City of Westland Development for additional details. This project is expected to be completed by 2013 and was highlighted in the 2009 State of the City mayoral address. =Later history= By 1960, Nankin's population had increased to 70,000, giving the area the distinction of being the state's largest township. During the early 1960s, the city of Livonia wanted to annex the part of Nankin in which a large shopping mall, Westland Shopping Center, was to be built. The shopping center eventually opened in 1965, joining Northland and Eastland malls in Southfield and Harper Woods, respectively. In reaction to Livonia's annexation attempts, the people of Nankin voted on May 16, 1966, to change the remainder of the township to the City of Westland. At that time, it was the fourth largest city in Wayne County. Politics The Westland City Hall Sign The current mayor of Westland is William (Bill) Wild.

The population was 2,165 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Aitkin County. History Before the establishment of City of Aitkin, a transient community of Lexington was located at the mouth of the Ripple River, at its confluence with the Mississippi River.Mitchell, Samuel Augustus. Map of Minnesota and Dakota. Philadelphia: Charles Desilver. 1859. However, maps from the 1860s erroneously depict the village of Ojibway (or Ogibeway) at the mouth of the Ripple River. (Today the town here is known as Riverton.) Due to the importance of regional trade at Lexington, the route of the Northern Pacific Railroad was planned to pass near there. Aitkin was founded in 1870 when the Northern Pacific Railroad was extended to that point, replacing and annexing Lexington. The city and county were named for William Alexander Aitken, a partner of the American Fur Company and chief factor of the company's regional operations in the early 19th century. The development of industries attracted people to the town. In the late 19th and early 20th century, a massive wave of immigrants, mostly from present-day Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavian countries, moved into the Aitkin area to work in the logging and riverboat industries. They were able to start working before they had learned much English. After the Great Depression and World War II, the logging industry declined. The area developed as a farming community, based on production of cattle and poultry, which continued until the late 1970s to early 1980s. A creamery Hakes, Boyd. Mutual Creamary History, Aitkin, MN. Aitkin Historical Society. circa 1980. Retrieved July 31, 2013. http://www.aitkincohs.org/docs/mutual_creamery_history.pdf and a turkey plant were important to the town's economy. With the decline of small family farms in agriculture, many abandoned farms can be seen throughout the county. By the 1990s, Aitkin had changed again, developing as a community for retirement and tourism, especially with its lake areas. The tourism and service industries are central today. Health care, education, human services, and non-profit organizations are some of the major contributors to the modern-day Aitkin economy, along with the hospitality industry. Aitkin has been affected by occasional flooding of the Mississippi River. Major notable floods had reached past , such as the 1950 flood, and nearly , such as the summer flooding in 2012. The 2012 flood was one of the first floods that overflowed into the lake areas, flooding the cabins, since it was caused by heavy rainfall instead of melting snow. Five properties in Aitkin are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the 1901 Patrick Casey House, the 1902 Potter/Casey Company Building, the 1911 Aitkin Carnegie Library, the 1916 Northern Pacific Depot, and the Aitkin County Courthouse and Jail (built in 1920 and 1915, respectively).

The department's request would have meant a 27% increase in property taxes.

Transportation Minnesota State Highway 65 serves as a main route in the city. History The earliest record of settlers in the Ham Lake area goes back to 1855, and in 1856, the settlers established a town located just south and west of a lake shaped like a ham. The settlers platted and sold lots for a community they named Glen Carey, a Scottish name meaning \\"beautiful valley\\". The location was widely advertised as a future city. However, in 1857, all of the houses were destroyed by a prairie fire. Some of the inhabitants barely escaped with their lives saving only a very few household goods. The settlers soon left the area as they had nowhere to live. There was no more settlement until 1866, when a Norwegian man settled in the area. He was soon followed by other Scandinavians. The Scandinavian settlers found it difficult to pronounce the Scottish name of Glen Carey. Since no official name had been chosen by the people, the commissioners named it Ham Lake, after the lake which had acquired that name on account of its shape. The early settlers found the soil well suited to farming as it was not as rocky as they had been accustomed to in Scandinavia. Through the years, dairying became an important industry. The pioneer farmers soon found the soil well suited to growing potatoes and this became an important commodity for both cash sales and trading. Ham Lake Township would split from Grow Township (Andover) in 1871.https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1880/vol-01-population/1880_v1-10.pdf From the early 1900s through the 1930s, potato farming was at its peak in then named Ham Lake Township. Some of the farms remaining today are the sod farms in the southeast part of the city, where the ground is low and the soil black and heavy making it well suited to this crop as well as corn and potatoes in some places. In 1894, when the population was over 400 people, a group of farmers joined together to form a cooperative and built a creamery. Several general stores were built there shortly afterwards. What became the main store in town, Soderquist's, was built on land sold to the Soderquist family by the Olson family, who had extensive landholdings along what would later become Highway 65. Like many small American communities, over time all the \\"old\\" families became related through marriage. Although many of the establishing families have since moved away from Ham Lake due to increasing property taxes and crowding, these familial connections remain firm, and many members of the families are still in close contact. In 1922, a service garage was opened in the northern part of Ham Lake. A Fire Department was established 1969, with Eldon Hentges as the first Fire Chief. Ham Lake officially became a city on January 8, 1974, with Eldon Hentges serving as the first Mayor.

The population was 744 at the 2010 census. The city is a small enclave within the city of Columbia Heights and consists of 16 city blocks. Minnesota State Highway 65 (Central Avenue) serves as a main route, running on the town's eastern edge. The majority of the town's residents live in the 263 mobile homes, across four trailer parks, that sit within the city's borders. Hilltop is one of only two incorporated cities in Minnesota that consist primarily of manufactured housing; the second is another Twin Cities suburb, Landfall, Minnesota.Brad Zellar, Pushing Tin , City Pages, January 29, 2003, Accessed June 10, 2009. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Hilltop is an enclave within Columbia Heights—that is, entirely surrounded on all borders by Columbia Heights. History The land where Hilltop exists was originally an unincorporated part of the former Fridley Township, a civil township next to the city of Fridley. The land had a dairy farm and later was the Oak Grove Riding Academy and Stables. The first trailer park, Trailer City, opened on the land in the 1940s; another park, Sunnyside, soon opened next door. Residents of two trailer parks became concerned that the township was planning to remove the mobile homes. In 1956, led by Trailer City Park owner Les Johnson, they approached neighboring Columbia Heights and requested to be annexed by the city. Columbia Heights turned down their request, so Johnson circulated a petition to have the residents vote on incorporation. The petition for incorporation passed smoothly, 137 to 34, and Hilltop was created. The city was named after a nearby drive-in cinema. Columbia Heights soon annexed all the land surrounding Hilltop, and began to make antagonistic moves towards the young town, at one point threatening to halt Hilltop's water and sewer service for punitive reasons. Another item of conflict was Hilltop's plan to issue liquor licenses, which would compete with Columbia Heights' own municipal liquor store that accounted for a third of the city's operating budget. Instead of initially contracting with Columbia Heights, Hilltop opted to contract its fire protection from Fridley and establish its own police department by hiring a retired highway patrolman as police chief and three part-time officers. By 1959, tensions rose to the point where the Metropolitan Municipalities Commission, a predecessor of the Twin Cities-wide Metropolitan Council, asked the then-State Attorney General Walter Mondale to contest the Hilltop charter to the Minnesota Supreme Court. Hilltop's first mayor was William Wychor, who instituted ordinances prohibiting activities such as \\"fortune tellers and other such like imposters\\"; \\"a person known to be a pickpocket, thief, burglar, yeggman, or confidence man and having no visible or lawful means of support\\"; and anyone \\"procuring or attempting to solicit money or any other thing of value by falsely pretending and representing himself to be blind, deaf, dumb, without arms or legs, or to be otherwise physically deficient\\". By 1961, Hilltop was growing in population and tax revenue after attracting construction of a strip mall including a supermarket, drugstore, and liquor store, in addition to a bowling alley (with liquor license) and motel. Media in Columbia Heights began insinuating that Hilltop's liquor licenses were illegal, but were unable to provide evidence. The town constructed its own water tower in the mid-1960s, which allowed it to tap the Minneapolis water supply and end its conflict with Columbia Heights. In 1967, the town's population had doubled from inception to 1,039. Tension between the rival cities began to abate in 1968, when Hilltop mayor Vivian Caesar and Columbia Heights mayor Bruce Nawrocki met alongside their respective city councils to discuss mutual issues. The city's police department closed in 1972, when one of its officers drove the town's only squad car into a tree and ruined their only source of transportation. Unable to afford a replacement, the police department was disbanded and the town instead paid the Columbia Heights Police Department for service; rescue services were also contracted to Columbia Heights on a per-incident fee. The city led the Twin Cities area in population loss during the 1970s, going from a high of 1,015 to 817 in 1980. Due to the town's small size and the fascination with the trailer park stereotype, what were sometimes smaller incidents caused major headlines in the media of the area. In 1970, then-mayor George Reiter attempted to replace the female village clerk because he believed men were temperamentally better suited for the position, a view held by many of his supporters in the city. Murders were especially troubling for the residents. In 1976, there was a triple homicide in the city, perpetrated by Edwin Clay Hull and Ronald D. Gilbert – both received life sentences.http://www.leagle.com/decision/1978844268NW2d576_1817http://www.leagle.com/decision/19781174269NW2d905_11112 In 1980, three prison escapees were captured hiding out in the trailer of one of their mothers; and in 1987, there was a murder-suicide involving a brother and sister. In 1991, city manager Karen Danz, who had stood in the position for 20 years, was arrested and convicted of embezzling over $200,000 from the city treasury. With an annual budget of only $250,000 at the time, the crisis nearly drove the city to bankruptcy and jeopardized its police protection agreement with Columbia Heights. The city was ultimately saved by insurance and a fidelity bond. In 1995, the city received more unwanted attention when the Star Tribune carried a headline that \\"Tiny Hilltop is Crime Capital\\" due to its 131 serious crimes in 1994, which worked out to one for every six residents. Government Hilltop's government consists of a mayor and a three-person city council. The city manager is the town's only full-time employee. As of 2003, the mayor's salary was $300 a month, and council members received $250 a month. Police services are contracted to Columbia Heights Police Department based on an annual fee; rescue services are also handled by Columbia Heights on a per-incident fee. Fire department services are contracted to the Columbia Heights Fire Department.

The world's largest turkey  \\"Big Tom\\" in 2018 The city is best known as the home of \\"Big Tom: the World's Largest Turkey.\\" Frazee has long been a part of the turkey industry. In 1984, turkey growers and committee members got together and decided to put up a giant turkey statue to honor the town. At the cost of $20,000 to build, the group commissioned artist Shell Scott to construct the statue which was built on a metal frame and covered in cement, fiberglass, cardboard, and insulation. The statue, named \\"Big Tom\\", was finished in 1986 and stood tall earning Frazee the title of \\"Home of the world's largest turkey.\\" Due to Big Tom's physical makeup, the statue needed frequent repairs. There were also complaints that Big Tom was not proportioned like a real turkey. The area committee decided that they needed a new Big Tom and commissioned artist Dave Oswald. On July 1, 1998, during the removing process for Big Tom, the statue caught fire from a cutting torch, which was being used to remove the wings. On September 19, 1998, a new statue arrived in Frazee in three pieces on a flatbed trailer. The new \\"Big Tom\\" took eight hours to assemble, standing over tall and wide. It weighs over 5,000 pounds, having 1,000 pounds of steel reinforcement. It has 3,000 to 4,000 separate fiberglass feathers, which took the D.W.O. Fiberglass Company over 2,000 hours to make.

It was administered at the local level by publicly elected French and English school boards, changed in 2020 to school service centres. Teachers are represented by province-wide unions that negotiate province-wide working conditions with local boards and the provincial government of Quebec.  Preschool, primary and secondary education  *Optional preschool, also known as pre-kindergarten (prématernelle), is available for children that have attained 4 years of age on September 30 of the school year. *Kindergarten (maternelle) is available province-wide for children that have attained 5 years of age on September 30 of the school year. *Mandatory elementary education (école primaire) starts with grade 1, through to grade 6. Secondary school (école secondaire) has five grades, called secondary I-V (Sec I-V for short) or simply grades 7-11 (No 12th grade). Students are 12 to 17 years old (age of September 30), unless they repeat a grade. Upon completion of grade 11, students receive their high school diploma from the provincial government. =Religion in schools= Formerly, school boards were divided between Roman Catholic and Protestant (called \\"confessional schools\\"). Attempts were made to set up a Jewish school board before the Second World War, but it failed partly due to divisions within the Jewish community. This confessional system was established through the British North America Act, 1867 (today the Constitution Act, 1867), which granted power over education to the provinces. Article 93 of the act made it unconstitutional for Quebec to change this system. Consequently, a constitutional amendment was required to operate what some see as the separation of the State and the church in Quebec. The Quebec Education Act of 1988 provided for a change to linguistic school boards. In 1997, a unanimous vote by the National Assembly of Quebec allowed for Quebec to request that the Government of Canada exempt the province from Article 93 of the Constitution Act. This request was passed by the federal parliament, resulting in Royal Assent being granted to the Constitutional Amendment, 1997, (Quebec). In the 1996-1997 school year, Quebec had 156 school districts including 135 Catholic districts, 18 Protestant school districts, and three First Nations districts. The school districts operated 2,670 public schools, including 1,895 primary schools, 576 general or professional secondary schools, and 199 combined primary and secondary schools.\\"Les réseaux scolaires publics et privés.\\" Government of Quebec. January 28, 1998. Retrieved on December 21, 2012. \\"En 1996-1997, on dénombre 156 commissions scolaires dont 135 reconnues comme catholiques, dix-huit reconnues comme protestantes, et trois à statut particulier qui desservent principalement les élèves autochtones.

De ce nombre, 1 895 écoles donnent uniquement l'enseignement primaire, 576, uniquement l'enseignement secondaire général ou professionnel, alors que 199 écoles offrent à la fois l'enseignement primaire et l'enseignement secondaire.\\" When public schools were deconfessionalized in 2000, Catholic and Protestant religious education classes along with nonreligious moral education classes continued to be part of the curriculum. Article 5 of the Quebec Public Education Act had been modified in 1997 so as to allow minority religious groups to be allowed religious education classes of their faith where their number were large enough, but this was removed in 2000. Then, in order to prevent court challenges by these same minority religious groups wanting specialist religious education in schools, the government invoked the notwithstanding clause, which expires after a maximum of 5 years. In 2005 the government of Premier Jean Charest decided not to renew the clause, abrogate Article 5 of the Public Education Act, modify Article 41 of the Quebec Charter of Rights and then eliminate the choice in moral and religious instruction that existed previously and, finally, impose a controversial new Ethics and religious culture curriculum to all schools, even the private ones. The ERC course has been taught starting in September 2008. Several court challenges have been launched against its compulsory nature. =Private schools= Quebec has the highest proportion of children going to private schools in North America. The phenomenon is not restricted to the well-to-do. Many middle- and lower-income families send their children to private schools. The government of Quebec gives a pro-rata subsidy for each child to any private school which meets its standards and follows its prescriptions, reducing tuition costs to approximately 30% of non-subsidized private schools. Most of the private schools are secondary institutions, though there are a few primary schools, most of them serving precise religious or cultural groups such as Armenian Orthodox Christians or certain Jewish faiths. Approximately 17% of the high school population of Quebec currently attends a private high school. The figure is even higher in urban centres such as Montreal, where 30% of high school students are in the private sector.Learning in Quebec. ourkids.net. Retrieved Apr 25, 2018. A study released in August 2004 by the Quebec Ministry of Education revealed that, over the preceding five years, the private sector had grown by 12% while the public sector had shrunk 5.6%, with a slightly steeper rate in the last year. Private secondary schools usually select their students by having them go through their own scholastic exams and by making a study of the entire primary school record. The Quebec public sector teachers' unions oppose any form of subsidy to private schools. They claim (1) that private schools select only the brightest and most capable students and reject children with learning difficulties, and argue (2) that by doing this they leave a burden to the public sector. Private schools usually have teachers who are not unionized, or who belong to associations not affiliated with the main body of Quebec public sector teachers' unions. The debate over the subsidies has been going on for several decades. = Polyvalentes = A polyvalente (English: comprehensive) is a multi-functional secondary school specific to the Quebec school system. The difference between a polyvalente and a regular high school is that a polyvalente also contains a section dedicated to vocational training, in addition to general training. However, the term has not been officially used since February 10, 2001. It is preferable to use the term école secondaire (secondary school) for any type of institution where a high school education is offered, except for institutions already known as polyvalente The first polyvalentes were created during the 1960s under the initiative of education minister Paul Gérin-Lajoie. =Language in schools= Quebec has publicly funded French and English schools. In primary and secondary schools, according to the Charter of the French Language, all students must attend a French language school, except: * students with a parent who did most of their elementary or secondary studies in English in Canada and is also a Canadian citizen * students who have already done all or most of their elementary or secondary studies in English in Canada, or who have a sibling who has received most of their education in English in Canada, as long as a parent is a Canadian citizen. Many attend publicly funded English schools. These rules do not apply to temporary residents of Quebec or First Nation children. If a parent had the right to attend English schools, but did not, they do not lose the right for their children. English is taught as a second language in French primary schools from grade 1 onward, and a few schools also offer English immersion programs for advanced students. English schools offer a large range of programs that include French as a second language, French immersion, and fully bilingual programs that teach both English and French as first languages. = Bill 40 = On February 8th, 2020, Bill 40 was passed to get rid of the 69 school boards that have been running for 175 years. This included 60 French school boards and nine English school boards. Bill 40 did not affect Quebec's three Indigenous school boards. The political party, Coalition Avenir Québec, passed Bill 40, although there was much opposition from other political parties, as well as teachers' unions, parent groups, etc. With the elimination of the school boards, they have been turned into school service centres. The abolishing of school boards is said to save the government more than $10 million. Quebec has tried to take power away from school boards by limiting their responsibilities. Their reason for this is to try to improve the quality of education in Quebec. Bill 40 is seen as a complement to the Charter of French Language, also known as Bill 101.Bill 101 was adopted to increase the use of French in comparison to English.Bill 101 states that all students must attend a French language school unless they have a parent who did a majority of their schooling in English and is a Canadian citizen or the student did a majority of their schooling in English already. =French= The 60 french school service centres are now to be run with five staff members, five parents and five members of the community. =English= On the other hand, English school board commissioners remain on the job until November 1st 2020 but they will then involve four staff members, four community representatives and between eight and seventeen parents. The english school boards of Quebec invoked Article 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, which is the official language minority education rights. They take legal action to get exempted from Bill 40. Post-secondary education Students may pursue post-secondary education after completing compulsory schooling (elementary and secondary) in Quebec. Post-secondary education in Quebec includes two levels: college education and university education. Of note, the term 'post-secondary' in this entry is used specifically within the context of Quebec. Unique to Québec, this level is a bridge between compulsory schooling and university education. At the university level, education is provided by individual universities. These institutions have an education structure tantamount to that found elsewhere in North America. =Colleges= College education is given by institutions known as Colleges. Both private and public institutions (Cegeps, which is officially coined in French as Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel) of this type exist within the province. Unique to Québec, college education serves to bridge compulsory schooling and university education, since it is the only province that requires 11 years of study (instead of 12) to obtain a high school diploma. For admission purposes, Canadian provinces other than Quebec do not consider completion of grade 11 in Quebec (Sec V)—or, more simply, the secondary diploma of Quebec—to be sufficient for university admission (or admission at other post-secondary institutions). Hence, although some exceptions exist, successful completion of college education in Quebec is generally required to gain qualifications for university admission. Students who enter college can specialize in a number of different technical or pre-university fields. The term of study is two years for pre-university and three years for most vocational or technical diplomas. Students completing college earn the Diplôme d'études collégiales sometimes with other designations attached to this title. Of interest, the term CEGEP can only legally be used to describe the state-run post-secondary (post-grade 11) schools, where tuition is free. The 26 private institutions which offer a post-secondary program recognized by the Quebec Ministry of Education receive a subsidy for each of their 15,000 students, and grant the same diplomas as the public colleges. Unlike the state-run colleges, the private post-secondary schools do not have to combine pre-university and vocational programs in one institution. About half offer pre-university and the other half offer vocational programs. Holders of the two-year college diploma still must complete a minimum of three years of university education in order to obtain a bachelor's degree. Under Canadian law, bachelor's degrees from government-accredited universities in Canada are considered equal, whether from Quebec or other provinces. Those unfamiliar with Quebec may wonder if three-year university programs there are therefore equal to four- year university programs in other provinces, or in other countries where four- year first university degree programs are the norm. However, given that college diploma holders are granted up to one year of advanced standing credit at any university, it is clear that this is not the case. What exists in Quebec is simply a different structure of education than in other provinces, which ultimately yields exactly the same total duration of study when years of secondary and post-secondary study are combined. Graduates of two-year college programs often receive up to one year of advanced standing at universities outside of Quebec, but no more than this. Effectively, the first year of college study is considered equivalent to grade twelve in all other provinces, while the second year is considered to be equal to the freshman university year. Chronologically and legally, this is true and has been in effect for the entire modern era of education in Canada. =Universities= Primary school, secondary school, and college add up to 13 years of pre-university study, one more than other provinces (although part of college study is post-secondary, as evidenced by the treatment of college diplomas in and outside of Quebec). For this reason, most undergraduate university degrees in Quebec universities are three years in length for Quebec students who have obtained a college diploma. Universities from outside Quebec have four-year bachelor's degree programs, because secondary study in all provinces outside of Quebec ends with grade 12 (rather than secondary study ending with grade 11 and then being followed by two years of college study, as in Quebec). University education in Quebec is much like in other North American jurisdictions. In addition to formerly private institutions, the government of Quebec founded a network of universities in several cities across the province, called the Université du Québec. All universities in the province have since become public in a similar fashion to other Canadian provinces. From the standpoint of post-secondary institutions outside of Quebec who may be trying to determine transfer credit, there are essentially two ways in which to interpret the two-year college program, bolstered by local and countrywide legislation. The first option is to remove the first year of college study from consideration, since it is in fact the twelfth year of study overall in Quebec (similar to grade 12), and the laws of the land throughout Canada dictate that a high school diploma from Quebec lacks one additional year in order to be considered the equivalent of a high school diploma elsewhere. The second option would be to include both years of college study in the evaluation, knowing that the maximum of possible transfer credit/advanced standing is one year at the freshman level. This second option is viable if one is uncomfortable with using the chronological separation of year 12 and year 13 as their rationale, especially since college courses are not necessarily all taken in a predetermined chronological order, as the order can vary from student to student. Quebec subsidizes post- secondary education and controls tuition fees, resulting in low student costs in university education. There are three levels of tuition: Quebec resident (lowest level), Out-of-province Canadian resident (tuition set to average Canadian tuition) and International tuition (highest). The Quebec resident tuition is only available to residents of Quebec, residents of jurisdictions that have bilateral agreements with the Quebec government, and to students enrolled in French literature or Quebec studies programs. Greater Montreal has eleven universities, founded over the course of 200 years. In 2015, it had more than 155,000 students (full-time equivalent), or 65% of Quebec's student population.

History of Otrey Township As Told By Nellie Otrey McLane 1873-1958 William Otrey was born in Somerset, England, coming to America when he was four years old. He and his brother Thomas enlisted in the army during the Civil War. After the war, they took their mustering out pay coming to Chicago where they invested in trappers outfits. Setting out from there they trapped their way to Kandiyohi where they spent the winter with an English family named Hart trapping and working for their board. They arrived in Big Stone County just two days after the Ole Bolsta family and found a location to their liking on the shores of the lake that still bears their name. Long Tom Lake was named by William for his brother, Tom. They continued their trapping operations very successfully taking their furs to the Green Leaf store east of Litchfield, MN for it was there they received the best prices. Their supplies were also hauled from this store. The next year Mrs. Otrey came to live here. Mr. Otrey helped new settlers set traps and taught them the ways of living on the prairie. Some said that had it not been for Mr. Otrey they might have starved. A group of friendly God-fearing Indians lived in the grove near the Otreys during the winters. They were peaceful and good neighbors. Once they invited the white family to one of their services. It was not customary for them to invite white people to take part in their activities, but they spoke of Mr. Otrey as God’s man and asked him to sing for them. He was glad to comply and sang the hymn “O Happy Day.” The Otreys were not particularly anxious that the township be named for them. At first it was called Trenton because one of the settlers had come from a town named Trenton. However, William Campbell felt that it should be named for the Otreys because they had settled their first and it was through his efforts that the name was changed.

Education Maple River West Middle School is located in Amboy. As the name implies it was a middle school, which serviced 6th, 7th, and 8th graders. In the spring of 2009, the board members of The Maple River School District, Independent School District #2135, voted in favor of closing the Amboy middle school and reorganizing the student body in an effort to cut costs. Elementary students of Amboy normally go to schools in Minnesota Lake or Mankato, while middle or high school students usually attend schools in Mapleton, Lake Crystal or Mankato. History Shelby Township was organized in 1858, the year Minnesota achieved statehood. The township's main inducement to settlement was its rich prairie loam, rendered still more attractive by the availability of wood lots along the Blue Earth River. By 1860, Shelby Township was the most populous in Blue Earth County. In addition to its 315 residents, it also sustained a small but thriving village known as Shelbyville, located in Section 35, about two miles south of modern Amboy. In the early 1860s Shelbyville hosted the county fair. The town included a hotel, church, schoolhouse, mill, two stores, a blacksmith shop, a wagon shop, and a post office. By 1875, Shelby Township was a relatively mature agricultural area, well known for grains and livestock. At that time, the township's population was 800, and it remained at approximately the same level for the next thirty years. Despite such overall stability, there were some significant population shifts within the township itself. The main catalyst for change was the St. Paul and Sioux City Railway (later a part of the Omaha Road), which in 1879 built a north-south branch line through Blue Earth County. In several townships along the proposed route, residents offered the railroad financial incentives to locate a depot in their vicinity. For reasons that are not completely clear, the citizens of Shelbyville declined to do so. On September 2, 1879, they voted down a proposition to give the railroad a $10,000 grant. A week earlier, however, a group of farmers residing two miles north of Shelbyville had made the railroad an offer of their own. The farmers' proposal, which was accepted, was to buy forty acres of land for the railroad, if the railroad would lay out town lots, build a depot, and build a grain elevator. The town, named Amboy, was laid out in October 1879. This triggered the death of Selbyville, which was deserted within three years, the buildings having been moved to other locations. Incorporating as a city in 1887, Amboy had more than 400 inhabitants by the turn of the century.

One was 32-year-old William Riley Robinson. In June 1854 Robinson and his companion Lucius O. Hunt, traveled from Wisconsin to visit Blue Earth County. Robinson and Hunt arrived and came upon the three nearby lakes; Loon, Crystal, and Lily Lakes and marveled at their beauty. Robinson and Hunt returned for their families and headed back to settle in the Lake Crystal area. The families were also joined by two other men and their families, Calvin Webb and Samuel Thorne. Mr. Robinson and his family settled in a log cabin on the south shore of Crystal Lake, a few feet south of where the Robinson House is today. While Mr. Hunt and his family settled in a log cabin on the south shore of Lily Lake, now where the Holy Family Catholic Church is. Each men took plots of land one mile long and half a mile wide (the dividing line being modern day Main Street), the deeds of which properties were signed by President James Buchanan. Mr. Webb settled in the Judson Township, while Mr. Thorne took a claim on Crystal Lake. The local natives were great beggars who kept tabs on the newcomers. The Sioux even continued to hold their tribal dances in the Grove on Crystal Lake, which is now Robinson Park. One day, Mrs. Robinson was trying to put her baby to sleep, however a native chief ‘Standing Buffalo’ (Tatanka-Najin) and his friends were making several loud yelps. After the natives made a frightening yelp, Mrs. Robinson then grabbed a whip and almost struck ‘Standing Buffalo’. The whip missed, 'Standing Buffalo' gave her a wicked look, and calmly walked away. If Mrs. Robinson had hit him, the settlement would most likely have been massacred. In August 1862, Mr. Robinson was awakened early one morning by a knock at his door. It was an old Native American friend of his, and several other natives, in war paint. The natives told Mr. Robinson and his family to leave the settlement, as the people there and of the surrounding territory were to be massacred. The natives also warned to not tell anyone, especially Mr. Hunt, as Robinson's Native friend wanted to scalp him personally. Days passed, and Mr. Robinson noticed there was an absence of natives in the area. Robinson snuck into a nearby camp and learned that everything his native friend had said was true. Robinson began to warn the settlement, who all escaped to the fort at Mankato. The natives discovered the settlement empty, and in a rage, burned the settlement. Eventually the Native uprising was subdued and the settlers returned and rebuilt their homes. Mr. Hunt would build a brick house in 1869 that would be torn down in the mid-1900s, which is now where the Holy Family Catholic Church is today. Robinson built his brick house in 1870, which is still standing as a historical building on East Robinson Street. =Town founding and 1800s= Originally, in June 1857, a town named Crystal Lake City was planned out on the southwest shore of Crystal Lake, however, it failed to become reality. In October 1868, The Valley Railroad, Later the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis, & Omaha Railroad, was competed in the area. The railroad, after looking for potential locations, choose Lake Crystal as a location for a new station. And so Lake Crystal began along the railroad, and was surveyed platted by Mr. Robinson and Mr. Hunt in 1869. The railroads' engineer, General Judson W. Bishop of Saint Paul, named the town after nearby Crystal Lake. A post office began operation in Lake Crystal in 1869, and has been in operation since. By December 1, 1869, the town possessed a grain elevator, hotel, school house, grocery and drug store, hardware store, two general stores, harness shop, cooper shop, and a doctor's office.Lake Crystal Guide and Chamber Directory Lakeside Press ©2008 Lake Crystal was incorporated as a city on February 24, 1870.

The economics of Lake Crystal was adversely affected by the grasshopper invasion of 1873, when millions of grasshoppers devoured all the crops. The plague lasted for many years, until June 1877, when all the grasshoppers fled. It took years to recover, and wasn't until 1882 that good quantity's of wheat could be marketed at the local grain elevator.

History Shelby Township was organized in 1858, the year Minnesota achieved statehood. The township's main inducement to settlement was its rich prairie loam, rendered still more attractive by the availability of wood lots along the Blue Earth River. By 1860, Shelby Township was the most populous in Blue Earth County. In addition to its 315 residents, it also sustained a small but thriving village known as Shelbyville, located in Section 35, about two miles south of modern Amboy. In the early 1860s Shelbyville hosted the county fair. The town included a hotel, church, schoolhouse, mill, two stores, a blacksmith shop, a wagon shop, and a post office. By 1875, Shelby Township was a relatively mature agricultural area, well known for grains and livestock. At that time, the township's population was 800, and it remained at approximately the same level for the next thirty years. Despite such overall stability, there were some significant population shifts within the township itself. The main catalyst for change was the St. Paul and Sioux City Railway (later a part of the Omaha Road), which in 1879 built a north-south branch line through Blue Earth County. In several townships along the proposed route, residents offered the railroad financial incentives to locate a depot in their vicinity. For reasons that are not completely clear, the citizens of Shelbyville declined to do so. On September 2, 1879, they voted down a proposition to give the railroad a $10,000 grant. A week earlier, however, a group of farmers residing two miles north of Shelbyville had made the railroad an offer of their own. The farmers' proposal, which was accepted, was to buy forty acres of land for the railroad, if the railroad would lay out town lots, build a depot, and build a grain elevator. The town, named Amboy, was laid out in October 1879. This triggered the death of Shelbyville, which was deserted within three years, the buildings having been moved to other locations. Incorporating as a city in 1887, Amboy had more than 400 inhabitants by the turn of the century.

The population was 13,522 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Brown County. Located in the triangle of land formed by the confluence of the Minnesota River and the Cottonwood River, the city is home to the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, the Hermann Heights Monument, Martin Luther College, Flandrau State Park, and the August Schell Brewing Company. New Ulm is the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of New Ulm. U.S. Highway 14 and Minnesota State Highways 15 and 68 are three of the main routes in the city. History =Settlement= The first white settlers of New Ulm, 1854. The city was founded in 1854New Ulm Chamber of Commerce by the German Land Company of Chicago. The city was named after the city of Neu-Ulm in the state of Bavaria in southern Germany. Ulm and Neu-Ulm are sister cities, with Ulm being situated on the Baden-Württemberg side and Neu-Ulm on the Bavarian side of the Danube river. In part due to the city's German heritage, it is a center for brewing in the Upper Midwest, home to the August Schell Brewing Company. In 1856, the Settlement Association of the Socialist Turner Society (\\"Turners\\") helped to secure the city's future. The Turners originated in Germany in the first half of the nineteenth century, promoted with the slogan, \\"Sound Mind, Sound Body\\". Their clubs combined gymnastics with lectures and debates about the issues of the day. Following the Revolutions of 1848, substantial numbers of Germans emigrated to the United States. In their new land, Turners formed associations (Vereins) throughout the eastern, midwestern, and western states, making it the largest secular German American organization in the country in the nineteenth century. Following a series of attacks by nativist mobs in major cities such as Chicago, Cincinnati, and Louisville, a national convention of Turners authorized the formation of a colony on the frontier. Intending to begin a community that expressed Turner ideals, the Settlement Association joined the Chicago Germans who had struggled here due to a lack of capital. The Turners supplied that, as well as hundreds of colonizers from the east who arrived in 1856.Alice Felt Tyler, \\"William Pfaender and the Founding of New Ulm,\\" Minnesota History 30 (March 1949): 24-35; Grady Steele Parker, editor, Wilhelm Pfaender and the German American Experience (Roseville, Minn.: Edinborough Press, 2009). As a representation of Turner ideals, the city plan reflected those values. The German Land Company hired Christian Prignitz to complete a new plan for New Ulm, filed in April 1858. This master plan for New Ulm expressed a grand vision of the city's future. At the heart of the community stood blocks reserved for Turner Hall, the county courthouse, and a public school, representing the political, social, and educational center of the community. The westernmost avenues were named after American heroes George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Thomas Paine—the latter three noted for their freethinking philosophies. Members obtained the means to support themselves — in harmony with nature — through the distribution of four-acre garden lots located outside of the residential area. Historian Dennis Gimmestad wrote, \\"The founders’ goals created a community persona that sets New Ulm apart from the Minnesota towns founded by land speculators or railroad companies.... The New Ulm founders aspired to establish a town with a defined philosophical, economic, and social character\\".Dennis Gimmestad, \\"Territorial Space: Platting New Ulm,\\" Minnesota History 56 (Summer 1999): 340-350. Also see Rainier Vollmar, \\"Ideology and Settlement Plan: Case of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and New Ulm, Minnesota,\\" address to the Brown County Historical Society, May 18, 1991, tape recording, Brown County Historical Society. Kiesling House was one of three downtown buildings to survive the Dakota War and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. =U.S.–Dakota War of 1862= In the Dakota War of 1862, the city was attacked twice by Dakota warriors from a nearby reservation on the Minnesota River to the west. Retreating behind barricades that protected the city center, local citizens fought back, supported by volunteer militia who arrived from other towns to support the city's defense. Much of the town outside the barricades was burned. =1881 Tornado= On July 15, 1881, New Ulm was struck by a large tornado that killed 6 and injured 53. =World War I and II= Between the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and U.S. entry into the conflict, the citizens of New Ulm closely followed events in Europe, with the local newspapers sometimes printing news from relatives and friends in Germany. In an unofficial referendum in early April 1917, local voters opposed war by a margin of 466 to 19. Even as President Woodrow Wilson prepared his Declaration of War, a Brown County delegation arrived in Washington, D.C., to voice its opposition to that action. On the national level, the Wilson administration organized an active campaign to suppress antiwar fervor, joined on the state level by Minnesota Governor James Burnquist. The Minnesota Commission of Public Safety was granted broad powers to protect the state and assist in the war effort. Specific actions taken by the commission included surveillance of alleged subversive activities, mobilization of opposition to labor unions and strikes, pursuit of draft evaders, and registration and monitoring of aliens. Given the German heritage of New Ulm, federal and state agents began to visit the city soon after America's entry into the conflict, filing reports to offices in Washington and St. Paul. Locally, several business and civic leaders joined in efforts to root out antiwar fervor. On July 25, 1917, when a massive rally, attended by 10,000 people, was held on the grounds of Turner Hall to, as a flier stated, “enter a protest against sending American soldiers to a foreign country.” Speakers included Louis Fritsche, mayor, Albert Pfaender, city attorney and former minority leader of the Minnesota House of Representatives, Adolph Ackermann, director of Dr. Martin Luther College, and F. H. Retzlaff, a prominent businessman. Federal and state agents mingled through the crowd, gathering information. A month later, Governor Burnquist removed Fritsche and Pfaender from their positions, while the Commission of Public Safety pressured the college to fire Ackermann. These blows sharply divided the community — on one side, many residents took the removals as an attack on the city's heritage and traditions. Albert Pfaender was the son, and Fritsche, the son-in-law, of the city's principal founder, Wilhelm Pfaender. On the other side, prominent local businessmen, including flour mill managers, feared economic repercussions and promoted pro-war parades and bond drives.New Ulm Review, May 23, 1917. For an overview of these events, see Carl H. Chrislock, Watchdog of Loyalty: The Minnesota Commission of Public Safety During World War I (St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society, 1991). During World War II, German POWs were housed in a camp to the immediate southeast of New Ulm, in what is now Flandrau State Park. In 1944 a New Ulm family was fined $300 for removing a prisoner from the camp, housing him and taking him to church.Dean B. Simmons, Swords into Plowshares, Cathedral Hill Books, 2000 Historic Sites =Turner Hall= New Ulm Turner Hall, with the oldest section constructed in 1873, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It is the oldest Turner Hall in the United States still in its original use. The north half of the building is a combination of exterior wall elements of a 1901 hall/theater that burned in 1952, with a 1953 interior and main facade. Turner Hall remains one of the most active in the country and one that continues its original mission at the same location after more than 150 years. Its Rathskeller is likely the oldest continuously used bar in Minnesota, while its gymnastics program is also the oldest in the state. The Rathskeller features murals of scenes from Germany, painted by Guido Methua (1873), Christian Heller (1887), and Anton Gag (1901). These were recently restored with support from a grant from the Minnesota Historical Society.Daniel J. Hoisington, A German Town: A History of New Ulm, Minnesota (Edinborough Press, 2004). =Brown County Historical Society= The Historical Museum is housed in the old post office building, listed in the NRHP. The Brown County Historical Society, located at 2 North Broadway houses 3 floors of exhibits and one of the largest archives in the state. It contains over 5,500 family files, microfilm of census, naturalization, church, cemetery and birth and death records as well as business and history files.Brown County Historical Society =Defender's monument= Located at Center and State Streets, Defender's Monument was erected in 1891 by the State of Minnesota to honor the memory of the defenders who aided New Ulm during the Dakota War of 1862. The artwork at the base was created by New Ulm artist Anton Gag. The monument has not been changed since its completion (except for being moved to the middle of the block). =Hermann monument= Hermann Heights Monument The Hermann Monument in New Ulm dominates the Minnesota River valley from a hill overlooking the city. Inspired by a similar monument called Hermannsdenkmal near Detmold, Germany, this figure served as a symbol for members of the Sons of Hermann, a fraternal organization of German Americans. In 1885, the 362 Sons of Hermann lodges across the country committed themselves to the construction of a monument representing their cultural heritage. Through the efforts of Minnesota's 53 Sons of Hermann lodges, the monument was built in New Ulm, home to many German immigrants. The sculptor chosen for this project was a German sculptor from Ohio, Alfons Pelzer. A delegation from New Ulm visited Ulm in 2009 and went up to the Teutoburger Forest and Detmold in the North of Germany to commemorate the 2000 year anniversary of the Varus battle, when Arminius, a chieftain of the Germanic Cherusci, defeated a Roman army in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.{cn} =German Bohemian monument= A monument to German-Bohemian immigration to America is located in New Ulm. It was erected in 1991 by the German-Bohemian Heritage Society to honor the German-Bohemian immigrants who arrived in this area of the US, most by way of a boat landing on the Minnesota River some 150 yards to the east. The immigrants came mostly from small villages, with the largest number from the village centers of Hostau, Muttersdorf, and Ronsperg. Most of the immigrants were Catholic farmers who spoke a Bohemian dialect of German. Inscribed in granite slabs around the base of the monument are the surnames of over 350 immigrant families. Many of these names are still prominent in the region. As more and more immigrants arrived, not all of whom could farm, they settled in the city of New Ulm and some of the small communities to the west and north. The bronze statue that rests on top of the granite base was designed and sculpted by Leopold Hafner, a German-Bohemian sculptor who now lives near Passau, Germany. The monument is located at 200 North German Street and is open year-round. Culture =Glockenspiel in Schonlau Park= The Glockenspiel bell tower New Ulm's glockenspiel is one of the world's few free- standing carillon clock towers. It stands 45 feet high, and its largest Bourdon (bell) weighs 595 pounds while the total weight of the bells is two tons. The bells chime the time of day in Westminster style. =Minnesota Music Hall of Fame= In 1990, the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame was established in New Ulm. The museum displays music memorabilia from around the state. =Polka capital of the nation= Music was always a part of life in New Ulm, especially with the arrival of the musically-inclined Sudeten Germans in the 1870s. Whoopee John Wilfahrt's successful career opened the door to what became known as \\"Old-Time\\" music. After him, other local bands such as those led by Harold Loeffelmacher, Babe Wagner, Elmer Scheid and Fezz Fritsche kept New Ulm well known around the state and region. They even produced nationally popular recordings. With the opening of George's Ballroom and the New Ulm Ballroom and the start of KNUJ radio station in the 1940s, New Ulm billed itself as the \\"Polka Capital of the Nation\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20070206132950/http://www.newulm.com/about/history.html For years New Ulm's famous Polka Days were known worldwide by polka lovers. The festival was held each year in July. Polka Bands played on Minnesota Street and people danced and drank beer until well past midnight. Parking meter checker stands by his police vehicle which is imprinted with the German word for police (Polizei). It is part of the town's highlighting its German ethnic origins.

A portion of the city lies within the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation and serves as one of three administrative centers for the Indian Reservation. The population was 12,124 at the 2010 census. History Former Con-Wed plant (now a USG Corporation facility) in Cloquet, 1973 Cloquet began as a group of small settlements around three sawmills: Shaw Town, Nelson Town, and Johnson Town. These later became known as Knife Falls after a local waterfall over sharp slate rocks, and later as Cloquet. The area was platted in 1883 and the village of Cloquet was incorporated from the three settlements in 1884. It became a city with a mayor and city council in 1904. The word \\"Cloquet\\" first appeared on a map of the area by Joseph N. Nicollet in 1843 which named the Cloquet River, a tributary of the Saint Louis River, and the Cloquet Rapids to the north. \\"Cloquet\\" is a French surname but historians researching the name of the river and city have found no definitive answer, and are reduced to speculations. One of these is that the river might have been named after 19th century French scientists, the Cloquet brothers Hippolyte and Jules, with the settlement later being named after the river.  * The area was the site of the 1918 Cloquet Fire, which destroyed much of the town and killed approximately 500 people. Cloquet is famed in American economic history because before and after World War II it was home of the strongest consumers cooperatives of the country. The Cloquet Coöperative Society (founded in 1910) operated two cooperative stores which handled food, hardware, shoes, dry goods, and furniture. Other cooperative services included a building supply store, a coal yard, a mortuary, an auto repair shop and a gas service station. In 1939, the co-op did 35% of the business in the town, and 18% in Carlton County. By the mid-1950s, the consumer society had a membership of 4,262 out of a population of 8,500. This was a national record, given the fact that the total business of all American co-ops combined represented only 0.5% of the economy. The Finnish cooperative groups of the area also had an influence on the American cooperative movement in general. In the 1970s the area of the city was increased to over ten times what it had been in 1970. Despite this, the population of the city still declined between 1970 and 1980, even though the number of separate residences in the city increased.Guide of CLoquet, Minnesota =Architecture= Cloquet is home to the R.W.

Caregivers try to recognize and respond to babies' bodily needs and enable them to urinate and defecate in an appropriate place (e.g. a toilet). Caregivers may use diapers (nappies) as a back-up in case of \\"misses\\" some or all of the time, or not at all. EC emphasizes communication between the caregiver and child, helping them both become more attuned to the child's innate rhythms and control of urination and defecation. The term \\"elimination communication\\" was inspired by traditional practices of diaperless baby care in less industrialized countries and hunter-gatherer cultures. Some practitioners of EC begin soon after birth, the optimum window being zero to four months in terms of helping the baby get in tune with their elimination needs, although it can be started with babies of any age. The practice can be done full-time, part-time, or just occasionally.  Origins  Keeping babies clean and dry without diapers is standard practice in many cultures throughout the world. While this practice is only recently becoming known in industrialized societies, it remains the dominant method of baby hygiene in non-industrialized ones. The terms elimination communication and natural infant hygiene were coined by Ingrid Bauer and are used interchangeably in her book, Diaper Free! The Gentle Wisdom of Natural Infant Hygiene (2001). Bauer had traveled to India and Africa, where she noticed that while most mothers carried their diaperless babies constantly, she saw no elimination \\"accidents\\" as would be expected in industrialized countries where babies wear diapers almost continuously from birth. Subsequently, she raised her own children with minimal use of diapers, and eventually began to share her approach with other mothers and caregivers—initially through Internet-based parenting support groups and eventually through her book and website.'Diaper Free! The Gentle Wisdom of Natural Infant Hygiene (2001) Prior publications introducing Western parents to this practice include the booklet Conscious Toilet Training, by Laurie Boucke (1979), the book Trickle Treat: Diaperless Infant Toilet Training Method, by Laurie Boucke (1991), a pamphlet entitled Elimination Timing, by Natec (1994), and the more extensive Infant Potty Training: A Gentle and Primeval Method Adapted to Modern Living, by Laurie Boucke (2000). Boucke was influenced by an Indian friend who taught her how mothers in India care for babies without diapers, and she adapted the method to fit her Western lifestyle. Boucke later co-produced an in-depth DVD entitled Potty Whispering: The Gentle Practice of Infant Potty Training (2006) and co-authored articles for medical journals. While the terms elimination communication and infant potty training have become synonymous, many caregivers who practice EC do not consider it to be a form of \\"training\\", per se. \\"Nappyless technique\\" is a term some mothers in the UK prefer to describe babies who use a potty. EC is viewed primarily as a way to meet the baby's present needs and to enhance attachment and communication in general. In that sense, EC is often likened to breastfeeding. \\"Toilet mastery is, of course, an inevitable consequence\\", writes Bauer, \\"Yet it's no more the goal of Natural Infant Hygiene than weaning is the goal of breastfeeding\\" (2001, p. 217). Today, one often hears the terms \\"natural infant hygiene\\", \\"infant potty training\\", \\"nappy-free\\", \\"infant pottying\\" and \\"elimination communication\\" used synonymously.  Benefits  According to The Diaper-Free Baby by Christine Gross-Loh, EC offers a wide range of advantages. Because EC lessens families' reliance on diapers, this helps reduce the environmental impact of discarding disposable diapers and/or washing cloth diapers, and saves families hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in disposable diapers. EC babies are free from the problems of conventional diapering such as diaper rash, diaper change battles, not being able to explore diapered parts of their bodies, vulnerability to urinary tract infections, and potentially delayed or difficult potty training. Gross-Loh also reports that EC promotes a unique and wonderful bond between babies and caregivers.\\"The Diaper-Free Baby\\" by Christine Gross Loh (Los Angeles: Regan, 2007) Parents report that the squat or \\"potty\\" position that they tend to use to hold their baby in order to go is very comfortable for the baby. The position aligns the digestive tract and supports relaxation, as well as contraction of the pelvic floor muscles, helping babies to release their urine or stool and simultaneously build control of the urinary and anal sphincter muscles. This especially helps babies who are suffering from mild constipation. Many babies find defecating to be an unsettling process, especially as they transition to solid food. With EC, parents hold their infant in a supportive position as they defecate into the toilet or a suitable receptacle, offering loving emotional and physical support during this process.  Criticisms  Conventional potty training advice is based on late 1990s research by Thomas Berry Brazelton, who introduced the \\"readiness approach\\". He writes that \\"widespread acceptance of readiness and independent toileting have since been supported by clinical experience and resulted in agreement that a child should be ready to participate in toilet training at approximately 18 months of age and be trained completely by 2 or 3 years old.\\" He argues that trying to toilet train before this age could be coercive and therefore psychologically damaging.Instruction, Timeliness, and Medical Influences Affecting Toilet Training by T. Berry Brazelton, MD et al..* Brazelton acknowledges that elimination communication is both possible and desirable, but he believes it is difficult to perform in Western society. In particular he cites a mother's return to work as an obstacle to elimination communication. He also argues that parents should not be made to feel guilty if they cannot communicate with their babies in this way.A new/old way to toilet-train baby Deseret News Archives, by Berry Brazelton and Sparrow. His neutrality on the subject has been questioned since he has worked as a consultant for Procter & Gamble, manufacturer of Pampers diapers, including appearing in a Pampers commercial.  Components  The main components of EC are timing, signals, cueing, and intuition. = Timing = Timing refers to identifying the infant's natural timing of elimination. Newborns tend to urinate every 10–20 minutes, sometimes very regularly, which makes timing extremely useful. Older babies may still be very regular, or may vary in timing based on when they have last eaten or slept. As infants get older, the time between eliminations will increase. By six months, it is not uncommon for babies to go an hour or more without urinating while awake (babies, like adults, rarely urinate during a deep sleep). Timing varies radically for defecation, as some infants may have several bowel movements a day, while others may only have one every few days. Parents report that some babies as young as three months will appear to hold all their bowel movements until they are held in a particular squat position, as long as this is offered regularly enough. Parents also offer the potty at various times according to routine, e.g. after a feed, after waking, just before bath or bed. In the West, infant potty training historically relied on timing as the main method of training.Lekovic, Jill M. Diaper-Free Before 3. New York: Three Rivers Press. 2006.Schaefer, Charles E. and Theresa Foy DiGeronimo. Toilet Training Without Tears. New York: Signet. 1997. = Signals = Signals are the baby's way of informing a caregiver of an elimination need. Some babies signal very clearly from the beginning, while others may have very subtle signals, or no signal at all. These signals vary widely from one infant to another. Examples include a certain facial expression, a particular cry, squirming, or a sudden unexplained fussiness, among others. Signals are most effectively observed if the baby is left without diapers for the first couple of weeks of starting elimination communication. Babies who are nursing will often start unlatching and relatching repeatedly as they feed when they need to eliminate. For defecation, many babies may grunt or pass gas as a signal. As babies get older their signals become more conscious and babies often point to, or look at, a caregiver or potty to indicate need. Older babies can learn a gesture or baby sign for \\"potty\\". Later they may learn a word as part of their early acquisition of language. = Cueing = Cueing consists of the caregiver making a particular sound or other cue when they provide the baby with an opportunity to eliminate. At first, the caregiver can make the cueing sound when the baby is eliminating to develop an association between the sound and the action. Once the association is established, the cue can be used to indicate to the baby that he or she is in an appropriate potty place. This is especially useful for infants who may not recognize public toilets or unfamiliar receptacles as a \\"potty\\". Common sound cues include \\"psss psss\\" for urination and \\"hmm hmm\\" (grunting) for defecation. Older babies (late starters) may respond better to more word-like cues. Cues do not have to be auditory; the act of sitting on the potty itself or being held in position can serve as a cue, or the sign language sign for \\"toilet\\" can be a cue. The American Sign Language sign for \\"toilet\\" involves forming a hand into the letter \\"T\\" (a fist with the thumb inserted between the first and middle fingers) and shaking the hand side to side from the wrist. = Intuition = Intuition refers to a caregiver's unprompted thought that the baby may need to eliminate. Although much intuition may simply be subconscious awareness of timing or signals, many parents who practice EC find it an extremely reliable component.

History The Kettle River area of Carlton County, Minnesota, was settled by a large concentration of Finnish Immigrants in the years leading up to the First World War and the influence of those immigrants is still noticeable even today. On October 12, 1918, the 1918 Cloquet Fire caused by sparks on the local railroads left much of western Carlton County area devastated. Several hundred persons were killed by the fire and thousands more left homeless. The only building left standing in Kettle River following the fire was the bank that was made of brick. This building still stands in Kettle River, near the center of the town on the west side of State Highway 73. Following the fire, with most people homeless and destitute, the Spanish Influenza outbreak of 1918 wreaked even more havoc on the local peoples, taking more lives.

History =Early history= Ten thousand years ago, the Glacial River Warren flowed through the area and left deposits of clay, sand, gravel, and fine silt soils as well as the Minnesota River. Carver and the surrounding Minnesota River Valley were occupied by a Native American, pre-Columbian Woodland Culture from approximately 1200 B.C. to A.D. 1850. In 1834, there was a Wahpeton village at the present-day location of Carver, led by Chief Mazomaini; early maps indicate it was located on either side of the mouth of Carver Creek where it meets the Minnesota River.Carver Historic District - 2008 MINNESOTA SESQUICENTENNIAL EDITION, City of Carver, 2008, Accessed July 20, 2009. Pierre-Charles Le Sueur became the first European to navigate the Minnesota River, and between 1683 and 1700 made explorations of the region on behalf of King Louis XIV of France. In 1766, Jonathan Carver explored the area on behalf of the British Empire, and made maps as he searched for a western water route that flowed across North America to the Pacific Ocean. He named a small branch flowing into the Minnesota River \\"Carver's River\\", strongly correlated to the Carver Creek of today. In 1805, French trader Jean-Baptiste Faribault established the Little Rapids trading post just upriver of present-day Carver; the post, on behalf of the Northwest Fur Company, was visited by Voyageurs, Coureur des bois, Dakota Indians, and Christian missionaries. =Boomtown= The 1851 Treaty of Traverse de Sioux, signed between the Dakota and the U.S. Government, legally opened the area to white settlers. Before the Treaty was fully ratified, Axel Jorgenson, an immigrant from Fredrikshald, Norway, settled in the area by 1852 as a sooner. Jorgenson laid claim to that would become Carver. He called the area Lukenborg (or Luksenborg), but called it Fulton. In order to augment his barge transport business, to and from St. Paul, he opened a cheap hotel, the Hotel Luksenborg. Temperance Hotel (1857) A land boom in the 1850s led to widespread speculation along key river locations. Carver's position between navigable sections of the Minnesota River, as well as Carver and Spring Creeks, was an ideal location for a steamboat and barge terminal for transferring cargo. In 1854, Jorgenson sold his claim to the Carver Land Company, a group of seven speculators, who planned to plat and develop a town. Among the investors were Alexander Ramsey, the former Territorial Governor, and Levi Griffin, the first Sheriff of Carver County. Ramsey was responsible for naming the town Carver. The Town of Carver was platted in 1857 and lots were divided up among the seven according to their investment. By 1855, Carver already had a tailor, a hotel, a boarding house, a building designer, a carpenter, a livery stable, a blacksmith, two shoemakers, and a general store. When the town was platted in 1857, it already had 35 buildings; the school district was established the same year and was known as Minnesota School District #1 for a century. Also during this period, the steamboat The Antelope was making daily round trips between Carver and St. Paul, a one-way river run of . Steamboats brought passengers and immigrants, who rapidly opened up the surrounding area to settlement by farmers who could buy land from the U. S. government for $1.25 an acre, as well as the supplies needed to grow these settlements. Typical residence in the historic district The Panic of 1857 caused many frontier settlements to collapse. One such community, Louisville, located directly across the Minnesota River in present- day Louisville Township, collapsed and many of its buildings were moved to Carver. In 1858 Carver had a small gold rush when gold was purportedly found in Spring Creek. By 1860, immigrants who had previously come from the Eastern U.S. were supplanted by those from Sweden and Germany. The Dakota War of 1862 erupted in the region as most of the regions soldiers were embroiled in the concurrent American Civil War. Between 400 and 500 pioneers in southern and western Minnesota were killed as war parties attacked settlements throughout the region. Many settlers sought refuge in Carver due to town's steamboat transportation, which offered evacuation to Fort Snelling, if needed. The town was spared, but rumors of its attack caused residents of Shakopee to flee to Fort Snelling. =Decline= Minnesota Valley Oil Company Gas Station (1925) The arrival of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway in 1871 marked the decline of Carver's importance, as cargo and passenger traffic quickly shifted to the new mode of transportation. Telegraph service quickly followed. In 1877, Carver incorporated as a village. Northwestern Bell connected the town with phone service to the Twin Cities in 1893. Carver businesses suffered during the twin events of Prohibition and the Great Depression, causing the city to go into several decades of economic stagnation, leading to the decay of many historic houses and commercial buildings. The April 1965 flood of the Upper Mississippi River affected the lower part of old Carver and deepened the depression. The Flood Control Act of 1965 led to the creation of a floodwall to keep the Minnesota River at bay. =Restoration= Carver City Hall On June 25, 1969, Carver-on-the-Minnesota, a non-profit historic preservation organization formed to purchase, renovate and save key properties. While some progress was made during the 1960s-70s, the deaths of founding members caused the organization to stall and several important buildings were lost. The Carver Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, making it one of the first historic districts in Minnesota. The years of decline had actually helped preserve a number of important historic structures from ever being redeveloped, and the historic district includes eighty-seven buildings and four structures of commercial, religious, residential and social importance. The City of Carver created the Heritage Preservation Commission in 1989 as a supporting group of appointees to aid the City Council and Planning Commission on historic preservation issues. In 2006, Carver attained Certified Local Government status by the Minnesota State Historic Preservation Office. In summer 2007, the White House named Carver a Preserve America Community.Preserve America Community: Carver, Minnesota, Preserve America, March 9, 2009, Accessed July 20, 2009.

The population was 23,770 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Carver County, which is part of the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Guardian Angels Catholic Church in Chaska was built with the characteristic yellow Chaska brick. Chaska's history reflects the influence of the Native American culture. The first inhabitants are believed to be the Mound Builders, whose ancient communities are marked by mounds in City Square. Later, the Dakota (commonly known as the Sioux) were the primary nation in this region known as the Big Woods. Although the Indian mounds located in Chaska City Square indicate the immediate area was inhabited years before 1769, that's the year Chaska's recorded history began. In 1776, Jonathan Carver explored the lands along the Minnesota River and chronicled his journeys. French Canadian fur traders traveled the waterways, trading with the Dakota in the early 19th century. During this time, Jean-Baptiste Faribault established a trading post in Chaska. In 1851, the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux officially opened Little Rapids, as Chaska was then known, to settlement. Soon after, speculators moved into the new territory. Among the earliest was Thomas Andrew Holmes who, in August 1851, claimed a clearing as the Chaska townsite. The name \\"Chaska\\" is derived from a Dakota word often given as a name to the first born male child. Records show that David L. Fuller purchased the \\"Shaska\\" townsite from Holmes in 1852. In 1857, the townsite was platted by the Shaska Company. In the same year, construction began on the original Carver County Courthouse located where the post office and KleinBank now stand in downtown Chaska. Chaska was incorporated as a village in 1871 and, by special legislative charter, as a city in 1891. An abundance of high quality clay led to the start of brick making in 1857. By the 1880s, as a result of the clay resources, Chaska was a thriving brick manufacturing center. Bricks were shipped by boat to Saint Paul and, although the city grew as a result of steamboat trade, it was not until the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway was built through town in 1873 that rapid expansion began. With the advent of the 20th century came other industries, including the processing of beet sugar and other agricultural products; flour making, butter making, the canning of peas, corn, and tomatoes, and the curing of sauerkraut and pickles. National polls named Chaska the eighth-best city in the United States in 2007 and 20th best in 2009. In September 2016, Chaska hosted the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine National Golf Course. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The downtown portion of Chaska lies on the Minnesota River. Chaska Boulevard (Old Highway 212), Pioneer Trail, U.S. Highway 212, and Minnesota State Highway 41 are four of the main routes in Chaska. Demographics Chaska Community Center Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Chaska's population averaged about 2,000 and the nature of the city remained unchanged. The city retained its small-town image until the 1950s when the transition to a metropolitan community began. The expansion of the seven-county metropolitan area reached Chaska in the 1960s. With that expansion came the introduction of the Jonathan New Town design concept in 1966. The Jonathan \\"new town\\" development within Chaska brought new land, new jobs and new people to the community. This period of transition and expansion continues today. Dozens of modern industries have located to Chaska and continue to do so; residential construction adds 300 to 400 new homes per year; commercial business continues to expand offering a variety of retail and service opportunities to its residents; redevelopment of commercial areas in the downtown began in the 1980s and still continues. Although the community has seen much growth, development regulations and sound planning have ensured Chaska's small sense of community and the preservation of its rich heritage. In early 2005, the city of Chaska annexed the remaining portion of Chaska Township. Current plans for the area include a residential \\"smart growth\\"-styled development. A new spike in the population occurred after the construction of the Highway 212 freeway passing through the heart of Chaska, serving as a fast, direct, link to the heart of the Twin Cities. This freeway includes a bus rapid transit route serving Chaska with fast, efficient mass transit, along with convenient access to the Light Rail system which connects the southwest suburbs to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul.

It is surrounded by Pike Bay Township. Cass Lake had a population of 770 in the 2010 census. It is notable as the headquarters location of Minnesota Chippewa Tribe and Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, as well as the Chippewa National Forest. The city is located on the shore of its namesake Cass Lake, which was named in honor of Michigan Governor Lewis Cass. Cass Lake is part of the Brainerd Micropolitan Statistical Area. It reached its peak of population of over 2,100 in 1920. Since 1950, the combination of decline of small town retailers, suburbanization, and decreased employment in forest industries have resulted in steadily decreasing population. Economy Forest products have historically been an important part of the local economy. The Glenmont Lumber Company opened a sawmill in the autumn of 1898, followed by Scanlon-Gipson Lumber Company opening a planing mill in the summer of 1899. Both operated until the sawmill burnt in 1902. The Julius Neils Lumber Company opened a 30 mft sawmill, planing mill, and 8 mft lath mill in May 1900, operating until 1923. The Northern Pine Crating Co. opened a wooden box factory in the autumn of 1907, operating until the mill burned c.1950. Wheeler Lumber Bridge and Supply Co. opened a post-peeling plant in 1949, followed by a wood-treating plant in 1951. This facility was expanded in 1959 and 1971. Wheeler was purchased by St. Regis Paper Company in 1968; St. Regis later purchased a sawmill as well Frank's Mill (opened 1939). After the purchase of St. Regis by Champion International in 1985, the corporation closed the facility. The sawmill was purchased by Cass Forest Products and continues to operate (as of 2010). Tourism has been an increasingly important component of the local economy since the earliest days of the community. Numerous resorts and campgrounds in the area cater to sport fishing, hunting, camping, and watersports. Due to the cold winters, tourism is highly seasonal. The Federal Government has been an important local employer since 1902, when the Minnesota Forest Reserve was established. Cass Lake was selected as the location of the Forest Supervisor's Office. Following passage of the Emergency Conservation Work Act of 1933 and establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps, Cass Lake was the headquarters for the Chippewa Sub-District, responsible for management of over a dozen camps. Among the CCC projects completed in Cass Lake were the monumental log-construction Forest Supervisor's Office (1936) and establishment of the Lydick Nursery (1934), which produced millions of seedlings for reforestation work. In 1922, the Bureau of Indian Affairs established the Consolidated Chippewa Agency to serve all the Ojibwe tribes in Minnesota, with the exception of Red Lake. It selected Cass Lake as its headquarters. Later, the Indian Health Service opened a hospital and clinic (1937) to serve the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. Following passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and establishment of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, tribal headquarters were located in Cass Lake. Cass Lake is also location of the headquarters of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, which operates the Cedar Lakes Casino. There are a variety of small businesses that keep the Cass Lake economy thriving. Education Cass Lake is located in Independent School District 115 (Cass Lake-Bena School District). Cass Lake–Bena Elementary School is located within the city limits, while Cass Lake–Bena High School and Middle School are located approximately 1 mile south of town. Elementary school classes began in 1899 and the high school opened in 1904. Students also attend the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig School in nearby Bena, a Bureau of Indian Affairs-funded elementary and secondary school established in 1975. Leech Lake Tribal College, a two-year tribal college, is located approximately 3 miles northwest of town. History The area was inhabited for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples. In historic times, the Ojibwe/Chippewa moved west and south from the Great Lakes region, settling across present-day Minnesota. The village was established in 1898 with the construction of the Great North Railway. The post office was originally established as 'Tuller' in December 1898, named after the brother-in-law of the first postmaster. When this was known, residents quickly lodged protests with the Postmaster General and by the end of March 1899, it was renamed 'Cass Lake'. The forest industry has historically supplied many jobs, but has been susceptible to boom-and-bust cycle. Between 1898 and 1923, the city was dependent on lumber mills utilizing pine from the surrounding forests. Depletion of the pine resource was followed by utilization of lower value species at a box factory which operated until 1950, and a wood treatment plant operated by Wheeler Lumber between 1949 and 1985. From 1983 until 2009, Potlatch Corporation and its successor Ainsworth operated an oriented strand board plant in nearby Farden Township, which provided employment to many residents. Cass Forest Products, an employee-owned company, operates a sawmill that has been in operation since 1939, and is one of the largest forest product producers in Minnesota. The former wood-treating plant operated by Wheeler Lumber within the city limits has been designated a Federal Superfund site, due to soil and groundwater contamination by the wood treating compounds creosote, pentachlorophenol, and ammoniacal copper arsenate. In 2003, Elaine Fleming was the first Native American to be elected as mayor of the town., \\"Progressive City Leaders\\", The Nation, June 18, 2005, pp. 18-19.

The population was 156 at the 2010 census. The city was named after its founder, Jim Long. It is roughly four hours north of the Twin Cities. It is part of the Brainerd Micropolitan Statistical Area. Minnesota State Highway 84 serves as a main route in the community, and Minnesota State Highway 200 is nearby. Longville is a popular summer tourist destination and services the many cabins on nearby Long Lake and the much larger Woman Lake. Its population swells to around 5,000 in the summer, including the cabin dwellers. Longville Welcome Sign Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. Longville is part of the Northern Minnesota's glacial plain, which was flattened by glaciers during the most recent glacial advance. During the last glacial period, massive ice sheets at least thick ravaged the state's landscape and sculpted its terrain. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. Since the landscape is going through post- glacial rebound, it is poorly drained, creating Cass County's numerous lakes and rivers. Long Lake is very deep, up to , and drops off rather quickly from shore. This is very unusual for lakes of this size in the region. They are normally no more than deep. Longville's cultural landscape and its surrounding lands can be characterized as seasonal and recreational. The bulk of human activity occurs in the summer when the cabin owners vacation at their lake homes, and the activities they engage in are mostly recreational. History The area was inhabited for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of Indians. Before European settlement, the Ojibwe moved into the area from the Great Lakes, pushing out the historic Dakota peoples, such as the Assiniboine and Hidatsa. European American settlers followed the early fur traders and trappers, and encroached on Native American territories. Longville started around 1906 as a logging town in what is now Cass County. Fishing was very popular in early Longville and is still prevalent today. Tourism later grew as a service industry. In the 20th century, people from urban areas came to more rural areas for recreation associated with lakes, fishing, hunting and water sports. All the roads in and around Longville were dirt until the 1920s. Much of the downtown was rebuilt during the mid-20th century. Many of the cabins in the surrounding landscape were built in the late 1960s and 1970s. By the 1980s the Longville area was almost fully developed. The town has changed little since 1990, not suffering from the overdevelopment plaguing other Cass County towns. Economy Socio-economically, Longville is both white and blue- collar, as the economy is primarily made up of two sectors, services and real estate. A large number of service industries such as a marina, hardware stores, grocery stores, gas stations, and bait shops support the cabins. These industries share the economy with the more white-collar industry of buying and selling real estate. Most of the real estate is focused on the purchasing and selling of cabins and lake homes, which are often quite expensive, making real estate one of the region's top-paying occupations. Unlike boats, cars, and other expensive toys like snowmobiles and jet skis that can be bought elsewhere and brought to Longville (thus not benefiting the local economy), real estate cannot be bought elsewhere. Longville's diverse service economy includes a grocery store, gas station, bar, coffee shop, bait shop, supper club, realty services, airplane rides, boat maintenance, three hardware stores, a library, clinic, bank, airport, multiple art galleries, gift shops, pizza parlor, ice cream shop, mini golf, sporting goods and a chicken wing restaurant. All these businesses support the cabin owners. Longville services not just nearby Long Lake, but many other lakes in the area, including the much larger Woman Lake, a well-known fishing lake. Few of the summer visitors spend much time earning wages or on other compensation-based activities. They instead drive the local service economy, which depends on them. Many of the service businesses are only open in the summer as there is not enough customer traffic in the winter to be profitable. This differs from the regular maintenance and upkeep that cabins require such as mowing grass, cleaning bathrooms, and hauling brush. These types of activities are considered \\"work\\" but usually are done by a homeowner not working for an employer. Longville has a weekly newspaper, the Pine Cone Press-Citizen. Wildlife Long Lake is not a good walleye lake. It has only a handful of them. It was stocked with walleye around 2000. But it is very scenic and good for viewing wildlife from boats. And it is an excellent northern pike lake. They are easy to catch at the dropoffs, where the lake goes from 20–25 to 50 feet deep in just a 5-foot space.. One good place to catch northern pike is around the two grassy islands toward the lake's northern end. Sunfish and bluegills are also very common and easy to catch off the dock. Longville is home to many types of birds, including waterfowl, forest birds, and eagles. Nearby lakes are home to many common loons, the state bird of Minnesota. Common loons are often seen on Long Lake. Bald eagles also inhabit the region. They can be seen flying above Long Lake and picking fish out the water. It is not uncommon to see a bald eagle fly over Long Lake with a fish in its talons. Multiple small forest mammals make the Longville region home. Beavers can be found in the area's many marshes, streams, and ponds. Raccoons are known to tear apart cabin trash cans. Martens and fishers can also be found in the woods along with the much smaller and more common mink. Wolverines used to inhabit the forests but are now extinct in Minnesota, last seen in 1920. In the 1800s mountain lions were fairly common in the area, but they are now endangered in Minnesota. Conversely, white-tailed deer are commonly seen in the woods and along the highway into town from the east. Bears also inhabit the area. Porcupines like to gnaw on cabin floorboards and are considered pests. The area is home to numerous feral lab dogs that escaped from their hunter owners. Timberwolves also inhabit the region, but are difficult to spot because they live mainly in dense forest and marsh areas.

Lindström is located from the Wisconsin state line, and less than two hours from cities including Duluth, St. Cloud, and the Twin Cities area. When looking at the town from above, it looks like it could be an island due to the surrounding lakes. The landmass of Lindström consists mainly of lakes (including South Lindstrom Lake, North Lindstrom Lake, and Green Lake). With so many lakes, Lindström is a destination for fishers from all over the world. History Lindström's old water tower, a community landmark Lindström was settled predominantly by Swedish immigrants and their families. In 1853, Daniel Lindström left Sweden in search of a nice piece of land to settle in the United States. Lindström was platted in 1880. The town of Lindström was incorporated in 1894. Many other Swedish emigrants traveled with Daniel Lindström. Joris Per Anderson, half brother to Daniel Lindström, came in 1850 leading a party from Hassela, Sweden. In the party was Erik Norelius, whose personal journals in part formed the basis of Vilhelm Moberg’s novels of the Swedish emigration to the United States, The Emigrants. Moberg's novels have two main characters, Karl Oskar and Kristina Nilsson. The novels depict the hardships Swedish emigrants endured en route to America. A bronze statue of the author, holding his bicycle as if ready to ride away, stands on a stepped platform in Chisago City’s town park. An image of Karl Oskar and Kristina remains Lindström’s logo today. Since 1990, anyone who has taken U.S. Highway 8 from north of Forest Lake to Lindström has driven on the Moberg Trail.Lindström's Larger than Life Couple (by Moira F.

It is a northern town on the North Shore with a population of 1,351 at the 2010 census.[6] It is also the county seat and sole municipality of Cook County.[7] Prior to inhabitation by French Canadian settlers and prior to Minnesota's statehood, Grand Marais was inhabited by the Anishinaabe indigenous people, the thriving woodland people also known as the Ojibwe. The Ojibwe name for the area is Gichi-biitoobiig,[8] which means \\"great duplicate water,\\" \\"parallel body of water\\" or \\"double body of water\\" (like a bayou), a reference to the two bays which form this large harbor of Lake Superior.[9] The area was a bustling fur trading station since the 1700s, and the French Canadian Voyageurs termed the settled village ‘Grand Marais’ which is French for \\"Great Marsh\\", referring to a marsh that, in early fur-trading times, was 20 acres (8.1 ha) or less in area, nearly at the level of Lake Superior, and situated at the head of the little bay and harbor that led to the settlement of the village there. Another small bay on the east, less protected from storms, is separated from the harbor by a slight projecting point and a short beach. Also, ‘Grand Marais’ also may mean \\"sheltered water area,\\" as the harbor has natural breakwall rock outcroppings, providing for a natural safe harbor for early Lake Superior explorers. Located on the east side of Grand Marais is Chippewa City. Chippewa City thrived in the 1890s, with about 100 families living in the village. The historic Francis Xavier church still stands slightly north of town, just off Highway 61. The church began as a Jesuit mission from Fort William, Ontario in 1855 to minister to the Ojibwe residents of the area. The permanent structure was built in 1895 and was used until declining attendance forced it to close in 1936. The Cook County Historical society restored the site between 1970 and 1974 and it was added to the National Register in 1986. Grand Marais is a gateway to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), with the Gunflint Trail, historically a footpath for travelers and fur traders from inland lakes to Lake Superior. It is now County Road 12, a paved National Scenic Byway that begins in Grand Marais and ends at Saganaga Lake in the BWCAW, near the U.S. border with Ontario. It provides access to many of the entry points in the BWCAW. The area is home of several nonprofit educational institutions, such as the Grand Marais Art Colony and the North House Folk School, and art galleries featuring the work of local and regional artists. Grand Marais is also the hometown of 300 Entertainment recording artist Cobi.[10]  Geography  Gunflint Trail in Grand Marais According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Grand Marais is located on the northwestern shore of Lake Superior in northeastern Minnesota. It is an entry point for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, situated at the beginning of the Gunflint Trail. The Superior Hiking Trail passes near Grand Marais, and Judge C. R. Magney State Park is nearby, with its unusual Devil's Kettle waterfalls. The land surrounding Grand Marais slopes up to form the Sawtooth Bluff, a dramatic rock face visible from nearly any vantage point in the city. Adjacent to the bluff is Pincushion Mountain, a large bald monolith with dramatic views of Lake Superior and the inland wilderness. Grand Marais Harbor is protected by Artist's Point, a barrier island formed by lava that was connected to the mainland by gravel deposited by lake currents, forming a tombolo. An Arctic–alpine disjunct community survives there. Road access to Grand Marais is by Minnesota Highway 61, which heads northeast, following the shore of Lake Superior, and is known as the North Shore Scenic Drive. The Gunflint Trail (Cook County Road 12) begins in Grand Marais and heads northwest, away from the lake and into the Boundary Waters region. Grand Marais is located 110 miles northeast of Duluth and 38 miles southwest of the Canada–US border.

The population was 2,104 at the 2010 census. Mountain Lake was initially composed mostly of the 1,800 Low German (or more specifically, Plautdietsch) speaking Mennonites from Russia who settled there between 1873 and 1880. Although the city has gradually become more diverse, with the more recent addition of immigrant groups including Lao, Hmong, and Hispanic people, a significant percentage of its inhabitants still have Mennonite surnames. History The city of Mountain Lake was formally platted on May 25, 1872. It has had a post office in operation since 1871. =Original settlement= The name \\"Mountain Lake\\" is usually attributed to early settler, William Mason. The city's official website recalls, “the first white settler to the area, William Mason, found a shallow 900-acre lake with three islands. The two smaller islands just broke the water's surface. The third much larger, higher island looked to Mason like a mountain rising from the lake. He named the lake Mountain Lake and the island Mountain Island.” The top of the island was covered with trees, and could be seen for miles around, thus serving as a landmark to early settlers. The story continues that in 1871 the St. Paul & Sioux City Railway had selected \\"Midway\\" as the name of the village, since it was located midway between Saint Paul, Minnesota and Sioux City, Iowa. However, Mason insisted that the village being platted be named \\"Mountain Lake\\". Locomotive with the St. Paul & Sioux City Railway Demand for more tillable farmland and construction advances led to the draining of the original lake in 1905–06, which was located in Mountain Lake township, southeast of town. However, in 1937-38 a dam, bridge, and outlet were constructed by the Works Progress Administration at a new site in Midway township to create a new Mountain Lake. This lake, located on the north edge of town, also has an island. The large island of the original lake – now just a hill amidst the surrounding cornfields – became a county park which has since 1973 been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Archeological evidence suggests that early settler William Mason was not the first to appreciate the unique qualities of the original lake's island. Artifacts unearthed in a 1976 dig indicated evidence of habitation as early as 500 BC, thus making the location the oldest human habitation yet to be discovered in the state of Minnesota. =Mennonite immigration and influence= The coming of the railroad in 1873 played a big role in the expansion of the village. By the time Mountain Lake was formally incorporated in 1886, it had a population of three hundred people, primarily composed of Mennonites immigrating from southern Russia (present-day Ukraine). In 1873, Mennonite immigrants from the Ukraine (at that time, Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire) began to arrive in Mountain Lake, having been recruited by William Seeger, a member of the Minnesota State Board of Immigration. Seeger had specifically targeted Mennonites, “because they were believed to be hard workers of good character.” The majority of these Mennonite families came from the Molotschna Colony, located near the present-day city of Melitopol, Ukraine. However, a number of Manitoba Mennonites originally from the Chortitza Colony, near the present-day Ukrainian city of Zaporizhia, also settled in the Mountain Lake area. By 1880, it is estimated that some 295 Mennonite families had settled there. Because Mountain Lake was already an established community and its surrounding farmland largely surveyed, the Mennonites could not arrange themselves in the traditional communal villages they had been accustomed to in their Ukrainian colonies. This forced them to adapt to American-style, single family farms and to live amongst their non-Mennonite neighbors. As settlement continued, the Mennonites of Mountain Lake had soon established a successful and cohesive community, “based primarily on agriculture and local commerce.” For many decades thereafter, they retained the speaking of Plautdietsch, the Mennonite variation of Low German. On October 14, 1889, the Konference der Vereinigten Mennoniten-Brueder von Nord America, was founded in Mountain Lake. Elder Aaron Wall, founder of the Bruderthaler Church of Mountain Lake and Elder Isaac Peters of the Ebenezer Church of Henderson, Nebraska were instrumental in the establishment of this new Mennonite denomination. Known today as the Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches (FEBC), for many years the conference was popularly called the Bruderthaler Conference, because of the influential nature of the Mountain Lake founding church. In 1914 the name was officially changed to The Defenceless Mennonite Brethren in Christ of North America. The name was changed once again, in 1937, to Evangelical Mennonite Brethren (EMB). The denominational headquarters was located in Mountain Lake until 1956. Around the year 1905, several local men founded the Mennonite hospital of Mountain Lake. The institution struggled until 1912, when it was sold and reorganized as the Bethel Deaconess Hospital. The physicians in charge were Dr. Piper of Mountain Lake and Dr. Sogge of Windom, who were assisted by three deaconess sisters. The hospital was managed by a local board of directors consisting of one member from each of the town's five Mennonite churches. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. Minnesota State Highway 60 serves as a main route around the city, running generally east to west. Secondarily, County Road 1 runs north and south through town.

Sports =Baseball= Mountain Lake's baseball team (playing as Mountain Lake/Butterfield-Odin) took third place overall in the Minnesota State High School League baseball tournament in 1993. They shared their third place honors with Sebeka, due to a rain cancellation which precluded the actual playing of the 3rd/4th place game. The Mt. Lake Area baseball team captured a conference championship in 2014 under head coach Tim Snyder. Probably Mountain Lake's most decorated baseball player, Grant Wall, appears numerous times in high school and collegiate record books.

They participated in the state's first-ever basketball tournament, a 13-team, statewide invitational in 1913, hosted at Carleton College in Northfield. Under coach Henry Griebenow, Mountain Lake narrowly lost to Fosston by a 29 - 27 score in the state's inaugural championship game. Mountain Lake's Peter Guenter was the first tournament's high scorer, with 71 total points, averaging 17.8 points over the tournament's 4 games. They were also state runners-up in the 1915 and 1917 tournaments. Then in 1939, Mountain Lake won the state title in single class competition against Minneapolis Marshall, by a score of 37 – 31 under Coach Ray Bassett. Minnesota High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame basketball and football coach, Burt A. Munson, guided Mountain Lake boys' basketball teams to four (1946, 1948, 1951, and 1952) state tournament appearances. Mountain Lake's Burt Munson Field is named in his honor. The most recent state tournament appearance in 2013 (playing as Mountain Lake Area), was under Head Coach Shawn Naas, assisted by coaches Nate Brinkman, Larry Hempeck, Paul Metcalf, and Steve Thiessen. Their 2012–13 season record was 24 wins and 6 losses. On January 10, 2014, Coach Naas achieved his 300th career coaching victory. 2014 graduate Carter Kirk set all time records in Mountain Lake basketball history in points scored (2150) and rebounds (1350).

According to the 2010 census, the population was 384. The township was organized in 1871. Geography Mountain Lake Township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.17%, is water. It derives its name from the (now drained) lake of the same name which existed within its borders. Otherwise, there are several small creeks flowing in the township. Except for the extreme southern portion of the town of Mountain Lake, which is primarily located in Midway township, there are no incorporated towns within the township. An early historical source describes the land within its borders thus, \\"It is excellent land and produces immense crops of all grains and grasses common to this latitude.\\" History Mountain Lake Township was formally organized on May 6, 1871, at a meeting in the home of A. A. Soule. (The village of the same name, which encompasses a small part of its northern boundary, was platted on May 25, 1872.) It is a full thirty-six section township, located directly south of Midway township, west of the Watonwan county line, north of Jackson county, and directly east of Lakeview township.The author or transcriptionist incorrectly says \\"Lakewood\\" instead of \\"Lakeview\\" township. Lakewood township does not exist. = Early history = The name \\"Mountain Lake\\" itself is attributed to the township's earliest non- Indian inhabitant, William Mason. As told on the city's (of the same name) website, “the first white settler to the area, William Mason, found a shallow 900-acre lake with three islands. The two smaller islands just broke the water's surface. The third much larger, higher island looked to Mason like a mountain rising from the lake. He named the lake Mountain Lake and the island Mountain Island.” The almost circular island, located in the center of the lake, was flat on top and rose about forty feet out of the water. The top of the island was covered with trees which could be seen for many miles, thus serving as a land-mark and a guide for early settlers. The township was named from the lake which contained the prominent island. Demand for tillable farmland and construction advances led to the lake's draining in the 1905–06 timeframe. The original lake's largest island – now a tree-covered hill amidst the surrounding farmland – has become a county park, which since 1973 been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Archeological evidence unearthed in a 1976 dig revealed remnants of a Fox Indian inhabitation from what could be as early as 500 B.C., making the former island's location within the township the oldest human habitation yet to be discovered in the state of Minnesota. = Formation = On May 6, 1871, Daniel D. Bates and others presented a petition at the organizational board meeting held in the home of A. A. Soule, requesting that \\"township 105, range 34 be set off and called Mountain Lake township.\\" At the organizational meeting, the aforementioned Daniel D. Bates and A. A. Soule, plus M. Jacobson were appointed election judges and S. H. Soule was appointed clerk. The legal description of the newly formed townships was: \\"Commencing at the northeast corner of township 105, range 34, thence south to the southeast corner of said township and range; thence west to the southwest corner of said township, thence east to the northeast corner of said township and to the northeast corner of said township, thence to the place of beginning.\\" = Mennonite settlement = Mennonite immigrants from Ukraine (at the time, Ukraine was part of Russia) began to arrive in the Mountain Lake area in 1873, having been recruited by William Seeger, a member of the Minnesota State Board of Immigration. Seeger had intentionally targeted these Mennonite farmers, “because they were believed to be hard workers of good character.” Because the township's farmland was already surveyed, the Mennonites could not arrange themselves in the traditional communal villages they had been accustomed to in their Ukrainian colonies. This forced them to adapt to American-style, single family farms and to live amongst their non-Mennonite neighbors. As settlement continued, however, they soon established a successful and cohesive farming community, “based primarily on agriculture and local commerce.” Many of the township's current residents are descendants of these immigrants. The township contains a historic cemetery dating to circa 1880, located in section 22 of the township, where some of the pioneer Mennonite residents are buried. The population of the township in 1895 was 612 and the 1900 census counted 512 inhabitants. = Hutterite settlement = In 1994, the Neuhof Hutterite Colony in Mountain Lake township was founded as a division of the Spring Lake Hutterite Colony of Oldham, South Dakota. The Neuhof Colony reports 64 residents. Neuhof is associated with the Hutterite branch known as Schmiedeleut. In 2005, a second Hutterite colony was formed as a branch of the Upland Hutterite Colony of Letcher, South Dakota, called Elmendorf Christian Community. This community is an independent colony, with a Hutterite tradition. Elmendorf reports 135 residents. Elmendorf is affiliated with a group of independent Hutterites known as the Hutterite Christian Communities.

The population was 7,610 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Brainerd Micropolitan Statistical Area. Minnesota State Highways 210 and 371 are two of the main routes in the city. Geography Baxter is just north of Minnesota's geographical center, in a terminal moraine area created by the Superior Lobe of the Labradorian ice sheet. The city is home to numerous lakes and ponds. Baxter is bordered on the west by Cass County and on the east by Brainerd. The Mississippi River marks the southern border but expansion both north and south is possible. Along with the rest of Crow Wing County and parts of the adjoining counties, Baxter is part of the Brainerd Lakes Area. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. History Baxter owes its existence partly to the 1920s operation of a (since closed) large tie-treating plant, owned by Northern Pacific Railroad. Farming was also an important early industry. Baxter was incorporated on May 25, 1939. The town is named after Luther Baxter, an attorney for the railroad who served in the Minnesota Legislature and as a colonel in the Civil War. Tourism and various service industries have become Baxter's biggest employers, and numerous housing subdivisions have been developed in the wooded area west of Minnesota Highway 371, which passes through the town. Owing to the amount of unused land in the area, commercial development along the highway itself has also increased in recent years, though it has tended to conform to the pattern of urban sprawl. Superfund site and environmental damage The Burlington Northern (Brainerd/Baxter) United States Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site is on the boundary between Brainerd and Baxter. The site served as a Burlington Northern Railroad tie treatment plant 1907 and 1985. During that time, wastewater generated from the wood-treating process was sent to two shallow, unlined ponds. This created a sludge that contaminated both the underlying soils and the groundwater with creosote and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\\"Burlington Northern (Brainerd/Baxter) Fact Sheet\\" , EPA, 07/13/12 Demographics =2010 census= As of the census of 2010, there were 7,610 people, 2,963 households, and 2,110 families living in the city.

Crosby is adjacent to its twin city of Ironton, in the Cuyuna iron range. History Crosby was built for the sole purpose of mining. It was named for George H. Crosby, a businessman in the mining industry. Crosby was the location of Minnesota's worst mining disaster, the Milford Mine disaster. On February 5, 1924, a new tunnel was blasted too close to nearby Foley Lake, and water rushed in, killing 41 miners. In the 1932 local elections, Karl Emil Nygard was elected president of Crosby's Village Council, making it the first city in the United States to have a Communist mayor. In August 1957, David G. Simons, a 35-year-old Air Force major, climbed to nearly above the earth as part of Project Manhigh.
