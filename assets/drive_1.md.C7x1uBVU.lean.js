The sculpture is dedicated to Debrew's mother, Katie May Artis Debrew and all single mothers in the world. Condition This sculpture was surveyed in 1993 for its condition and was described that \\"well maintained\\". However, since 2005, the fountain has only been filled sporadically, due to cracks in the fountain. In lieu of repairing the fountain, Howard has considered removing the fountain, leaving the sculpture \\"suspended over a solid plaza.\\" In 2007, Howard's Blackburn Center director, Roberta McLeod, passed out fliers and considered raising money to fix the fountain, desiring to leave it a working fountain unlike other fountains on campus, which were no longer running.

It is located in the median of Highway 4 at Hillcrest Avenue in Antioch, California.  Design  The station serves as the eastern terminus of the eastern Contra Costa extension known during construction as eBART and after construction as BART to Antioch. BART to Antioch is a diesel multiple unit (DMU) line which extends from the Pittsburg/Bay Point station, passing through Pittsburg. Antioch station serves the central area of Antioch in addition to commuters to job centers in San Francisco and other areas. It is also expected to attract passengers from Oakley, Brentwood, and Discovery Bay, communities that were envisioned as part of the original extension but could not be included due to cost. BART plans to extend service southeast to Brentwood and upgrade the extension to full BART service while pushing the DMU portion further out.  Security and staffing concerns  Preliminary designs called for a station without an agent present, nor restrooms or escalators. This prompted concern from the community and the plans were redesigned to add these features, however the station will only have one employee present at any given time, one agent or one maintenance worker at a time. An extra police beat will be added. This caused concern among Antioch residents and the Antioch Police Department may have to cooperatively police the station. The lack of a full-time station agent has resulted in security issues after opening.  Start of service  Initially planned to open in 2016, the station's service date was delayed until May 26, 2018. BART anticipated the station would serve 1,575 round trips per day based upon a supposed opening in 2015. Two weeks following the beginning of service in 2018, ridership was observed to be about 3,000 round trips per day, overloading the station's parking facilities and causing riders to illegally park nearby. The station has 1,012 parking spaces. Soon after opening, the agency began planning an additional 1,600 parking space facility north of the station site. In October 2018, BART announced plans for a $16.4 million, 800-space lot east of the station, which would open in 2020. In November 2019, the BART board approved a $9.9 million contract for an 850-space lot, which is expected to open in early 2021.

It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory for the UN after large numbers of United States Army (US) and Republic of Korea Army (ROK) troops repelled a strong North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA) attack. Holding a line north of P'ohang-dong, An'gang-ni, and Kyongju, the so-called \\"Kyongju corridor,\\" the ROK I Corps was unexpectedly hit with an attack by the KPA's II Corps, part of the wider Great Naktong Offensive. The ROK troops, already demoralized and struggling to maintain a strong defensive line, were easily pushed back from their positions. US units were called in to assist the ROK to repel the attack. Fighting was heavy and the two sides fought to capture and recapture P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni, with the KPA seeking to break through the Kyongju corridor as a way to attack the UN base at Pusan. However, with large amounts of UN air and naval support, the US and ROK forces were able to rout and force back the KPA troops after two weeks of fighting.  Background   Pusan Perimeter  From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North, the KPA had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the ROK and the UN forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The KPA strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the KPA to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the KPA used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which KPA troops could not outflank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN forces. When the KPA approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter. Throughout August, the KPA 6th Division, and later the 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan, initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam-ni and Battle Mountain. These attacks stalled as UN forces, well equipped and with plenty of reserves, repeatedly repelled KPA attacks. North of Masan, the KPA 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area. In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it, and on August 19, the KPA 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties. In the Taegu region, five KPA divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu. Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the KPA 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack. On the east coast, three more KPA divisions were repulsed by the ROK at P'ohang-dong during the Battle of P'ohang-dong. All along the front, the KPA troops were reeling from these defeats, the first time in the war their strategies were not working.  September push  In planning its new offensive, the KPA command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN naval forces. Instead, they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN units in that city. As part of this mission, the KPA would first cut the supply lines to Taegu. On August 20, the KPA commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units. The plan called for a simultaneous five- prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the KPA to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered. The easternmost of these was for the KPA 12th and 5th Divisions break through the ROK Capital and 3rd Infantry Divisions to P'ohang-dong and Kyongju.  Battle  Map of the Pusan Perimeter Defensive line in September 1950 the Kyongju corridor is the northeasternmost sector The KPA attack struck first on the UN's right flank on Korea's east coast. Although the KPA II Corps general attack in the north and east was planned for September 2, the KPA 12th Division, now with a strength of 5,000 men, started to move forward from the mountains earlier than planned, from where it had reorganized after its defeat in the Kigye and P'ohang-dong area. The division was low in food supply, weapons, and ammunition, and its men suffered from low morale. On August 26, US and ROK officers in the P'ohang-dong and Kigye area were optimistic; they congratulated each other on having repulsed what they thought was the last serious threat to the Pusan Perimeter.  Early attack  Facing the KPA 12th Division was the ROK Capital Division. At 04:00 August 27, a KPA attack overran one company of the ROK 17th Regiment, Capital Division, north of Kigye. This caused the whole regiment to buckle and retreat. Then the ROK 18th Regiment to the east fell back because of its exposed flank. The ROK 17th Regiment lost the town of Kigye in pulling back, and the entire Capital Division fell back to the south side of the Kigye valley. At a briefing in Taegu on August 27, Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker showed his concern over this development. One of those present was Major General John B. Coulter who had arrived in Korea about a month earlier. Half an hour after the briefing ended, Walker ordered Coulter to observe the ROK troops on the east. Coulter flew to Kyongju, arriving there at 12:00 that day. Walker in the meantime formally appointed Coulter Deputy Commander, Eighth Army, placing him in command of the ROK I Corps which controlled the Capital and 3rd Divisions, the US 21st Infantry Regiment, the 3rd Battalion, US 9th Infantry Regiment and the 73rd Medium Tank Battalion, less C Company. Coulter designated these units Task Force Jackson and established his headquarters in the same building in Kyongju in which the ROK I Corps' commander and the KMAG officers had their command post. When he arrived at Kyongju that day, Coulter found ROK I Corps disintegrating rapidly and in low morale. Walker had instructed him to issue his orders to the ROK I Corps commander as advice, which Coulter did. Coulter had the mission of eliminating the KPA penetration in the Kigye area and of seizing and organizing the high ground extending from north of Yongch'on to the coast at Wolp'o-ri, about north of P'ohang-dong. This line passed north of Kigye. Coulter was to attack as soon as possible with Task Force Jackson to gain the first high ground north of Kigye. The US 21st Infantry Regiment was moving to a position north of Taegu on the morning of August 27, when Walker revoked its orders and instructed it to turn around and proceed as rapidly as possible to Kyongju and report to Coulter. The regiment departed Taegu at 10:00 and arrived at Kyongju that afternoon. Coulter immediately sent the 3rd Battalion north to An'gang-ni where it went into a position behind the ROK Capital Division.  UN counterattack  Coulter's plan to attack on August 28 had to be postponed. Major General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, told him he could not attack, that there were too many casualties and the South Korean were exhausted. The KPA 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division, at a time he deemed favorable, advised ROK Brigadier General Kim Suk Won, the division commander, to counterattack, but Kim refused to do so. The next day Kim said he was going to move his command post out of P'ohang-dong. The KMAG adviser replied that the KMAG group was going to stay in P'ohang-dong. Upon hearing that, Kim became hysterical but decided to stay for the time being to avoid loss of face. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the KPA from consolidating their gains. The ROK disorganization was so great in the face of continued KPA pressure that Task Force Jackson could not launch its planned attack. The US 21st Infantry was in an assembly area north of An'gang-ni and ready for an attack the morning of the 28th, but during the night the ROK 17th Regiment lost its position on the high ridge northward at the bend of the Kigye valley, and the attack was canceled. The ROK regained their position in the afternoon but that night lost it again. At the same time, elements of the KPA 5th Division penetrated the ROK 3rd Division southwest of P'ohang-dong. Coulter directed the 21st Infantry to repel this penetration. During the day on August 29, B Company, 21st Infantry, supported by a platoon of tanks of B Company, 73rd Medium Tank Battalion, successfully counterattacked northwest from the southern edge of P'ohang-dong for a distance of , with ROK troops following. The US units then withdrew to P'ohang-dong. That night the ROK's withdrew, and the next day a US infantry-tank force repeated the action of the day before. The 21st Infantry then took over from the ROK 3rd Division a sector extending north and northwest of P'ohang-dong. Also on August 29, the ROK Capital Division, with US tank and artillery support, recaptured Kigye and held it during the night against KPA counterattacks, only to lose it again at dawn. UN air attacks continued at an increased tempo in the Kigye area. ROK troops reported finding the bodies of many KPA, apparently killed by air attack. They also found many suits of white clothing scattered on the ground, abandoned when KPA soldiers changed from civilian disguises into military uniforms. With this air action in the Kigye area, US naval vessels continued their efforts to help stop the KPA 5th Division on the east coast. A cruiser and two destroyers concentrated their firepower on the Hunghae area north of P'ohang-dong where the KPA 5th Division's troop assembly and forward supply center were located. On August 29 and 30 the three vessels fired almost 1,500 5-inch shells at targets there in support of the ROK 3rd Division. Despite this aerial and naval support, on August 31 the battle continued to go against the ROK forces both at Kigye and P'ohang-dong.  Kigye recaptured  UN aerial observation on September 1 discovered the KPA were moving southward in the mountains above Kigye and P'ohang-dong. The next day another major attack was forming north and northwest of Kigye. In the afternoon, KMAG advisers with the Capital Division estimated that 2,500 KPA soldiers had penetrated a gap between the ROK 17th and 18th Regiments. North Korean attacks on the Kyoongju corridor, August 27 – September 15, 1950 At the same time, KPA pressure built up steadily north of P'ohang-dong, where the KPA 5th Division fed replacements on to Hill 99 in front of the ROK 23rd Regiment. This hill became almost as notorious as had Hill 181 near Yongdok earlier because of the almost continuous and bloody fighting there for its control. Although aided by UN air attacks and artillery and naval gunfire, the ROK 3rd Division was unable to capture this hill, and suffered many casualties in the effort. On September 2 the US 21st Infantry attacked northwest from P'ohang-dong in an effort to help the ROK recapture Hill 99. A platoon of tanks followed the valley road between P'ohang-dong and Hunghae. The regimental commander assigned K Company Hill 99 as its objective. The 21st Infantry made very slow progress in this attack and casualties were heavy. By 15:25 that afternoon, K Company could account for only 35 of its men, the rest killed, wounded or missing. The company was unable to take Hill 99 from the well dug-in KPA who threw large numbers of hand grenades to repel all efforts to reach the top. Two tanks of the 6th Tank Battalion were lost in this attack, one in a mine field and another because of a thrown track. At dusk a KPA penetration occurred along the boundary between the ROK Capital and 3rd Divisions east of Kigye. The next morning, September 2 at 01:30, the KPA 12th Division, executing its part of the coordinated KPA II Corps' general attack, struck the Capital Division on the high hill masses south of the Kigye valley. This attack threw back the ROK 18th Regiment on the left in the area of Hills 334 and 438, and the ROK 17th Regiment on the right in the area of Hill 445. By dawn of September 3, the KPA penetration there had reached the vital east–west corridor road east of An'gang-ni. As a result of this gain during the night, the KPA 12th Division had advanced and the Capital Division all but collapsed. This forced Coulter to withdraw the 21st Infantry from the line northwest of P'ohang-dong and concentrate it in the vicinity of Kyongju. The 2nd Battalion had joined the regiment on August 31, but Coulter had held it in the task force's reserve at An'gang-ni. That battalion now took up a horseshoe-shaped defense position around the town, with some elements on high ground east where they protected the Kyongju to P'ohang-dong highway. The rest of the regiment closed into an assembly area north of Kyongju. At the same time, Walker started the newly activated ROK 7th Division toward the KPA penetration. Its ROK 5th Regiment closed at Yongch'on that afternoon, and the ROK 3rd Regiment, less its 1st Battalion, closed at Kyongju in the evening. Walker also authorized Coulter to use the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry; the 9th Infantry Regimental Tank Company; and the 15th Field Artillery Battalion as he deemed advisable. These units, held at Yonil Airfield for its defense, had not previously been available for commitment elsewhere.  Fall of An'gang-ni  During the day on September 3, KMAG advisers at P'ohang-dong sent Coulter a message that the ROK 3rd Division commander was preparing to withdraw from P'ohang-dong. Coulter went immediately to the ROK I Corps commander and had him order ROK 3rd Division would not withdraw. Coulter checked every half-hour to see that the division stayed in its P'ohang-dong positions. That night, September 3–4, the remainder of the ROK I Corps front collapsed. Three KPA T-34 tanks overran a battery of ROK artillery and then scattered two battalions of the newly arrived ROK 5th Regiment. Following a mortar preparation, the KPA entered An'gang-ni at 02:20. An hour later the command post of the Capital Division withdrew from the town and fighting became increasingly confused. By 04:00 US tanks ceased firing because remnants of the Capital Division had become intermingled with KPA forces. At daylight, G Company, US 21st Infantry, discovered that it was alone in An'gang-ni, nearly surrounded by the KPA. ROK troops had disappeared. At 18:10, G Company withdrew from the town and dug in along the road eastward near the rest of the 2nd Battalion, 21st Infantry at the bridge over the Hyongsan-gang. KPA held the town and extended southward along the railroad. Receiving orders to withdraw and join the regiment above Kyongju, the 2nd Battalion, 21st Infantry had to fight through a KPA roadblock on the east side of the Hyongsan-gang southeast of An'gang-ni. Upon arrival, it discovered that G Company was missing and the battalion had to turn around and get G Company. The 2nd Battalion fought its way back north and found G Company at the bridge. Reunited, the battalion fought its way out again, with tanks firing down the road ahead of the column and into the hills along the sides. KPA fire knocked the tracks off three US M46 Patton tanks. US artillery then destroyed them to prevent KPA use. The 2nd Battalion arrived in the Kyongju area shortly before 12:00.  Kyongju threatened  By 12:00 on September 4, KPA units had established roadblocks along the Kyongju-An'gang-ni road within of Kyongju. A gap existed between the ROK 3rd and Capital Divisions in the P'ohang-dong area. But the big break in the UN line was in the high mountain mass west of the Hyongsan valley and southwest of An'gang-ni. In this area northwest of Kyongju there was an gap between the Capital Division and the ROK 8th Division to the west. From that direction the KPA posed a threat to the railroad and the road net running south through the Kyongju corridor to Pusan. Faced with this big gap on his left flank, Coulter put the US 21st Infantry in the broad valley and on its bordering hills northwest of Kyongju to block any approach from that direction. The situation at Kyongju during the evening of September 4 was tense. Kim Hong Il, The ROK Corps' commander, proposed to evacuate the town. He said that the KPA were only away on the hills to the north, and that they would attack and overrun the town that night. Coulter told him that he would not move his command post. Coulter put four tanks around the building where the command posts were located. Out on the roads he stationed KMAG officers to round up ROK stragglers and get them into positions at the edge of the town. One KMAG Major stopped ROK troops fleeing south, sometimes having to do so with a pistol. The expected KPA attack on Kyongju, however, never came. The KPA turned east, crossed the highway north of the town, and headed toward Yonil Airfield. The next day the US Air Force (USAF), attacking KPA gun positions north of Kyongju along the road, found many targets in the Kigye- Kyongju-P'ohang-dong triangle as they caught the KPA advancing in the open.  Fall of P'ohang-dong  At 02:00 September 5, Lieutenant Colonel Rollins S. Emmerich, one of the ROK I Corps' KMAG advisers, hastened to Yonil Airfield where he conferred with Lieutenant Colonel D. M. McMains, commanding the 3rd Battalion, 9th Infantry, stationed there, and informed him of the situation in P'ohang-dong. Emmerich obtained a platoon of tanks and returned with them to the town. He placed the tanks in position and awaited the expected KPA armored attack. At 05:30 he received information that elements of the ROK 22nd Regiment had retreated in the face of KPA attack. KPA troops entered this gap and just before 11:00 the US tanks in P'ohang-dong were under heavy KPA machine gun fire. Five KPA SU-76 self-propelled guns approached and began firing. At a range of one city block the US tanks knocked out the lead gun, killing its three crew members. In the ensuing exchange of fire the other four withdrew. Emmerich then directed air strikes and artillery fire which destroyed the other four guns. But that afternoon at 14:35 the order came to evacuate all materiel and supplies from the Yonil airfield. That night, September 5–6, events reached a climax inside P'ohang-dong. At midnight, after 10 rounds of KPA mortar or artillery fire struck near it, the ROK 3rd Division command post moved to another location. KPA fire that followed it to the new location indicated observed and directed fire. The ROK division commander, Brigadier General Lee Jun Shik and several members of his senior staff claimed they became sick. The division withdrew from P'ohang-dong, and on September 6 it was again in KPA hands. The ROK command relieved both the ROK I Corps and the ROK 3rd Division commanders. At this time new commanders were appointed for these major commands. Brigadier General Kim Paik Il took command of ROK I Corps, while Capital Division came under command of Colonel Song Yo Ch'an, and ROK 3rd Division came under command of Colonel Lee Jong Ch'an. Because the big gap between the ROK Capital and 8th Divisions made it impossible for ROK I Corps at Kyongju to direct the action of the 8th Division, the ROK transferred that division to the control of ROK II Corps on September 7, and attached to it the ROK 5th Regiment, 7th Division. This shift of command came just as the KPA 15th Division penetrated the ROK 8th Division lines to enter Yongch'on in the Taegu-P'ohang-dong corridor. From west of An'gang-ni the ROK 3rd Regiment drove toward Yongch'on, attempting to close the gap.  US 24th Infantry Division arrives  The gains of the KPA in the east on September 4 caused Walker to shift still more troops to that area. The day before, he had ordered the US 24th Infantry Division to move from its reserve position near Taegu to the lower Naktong River to relieve the US 1st Provisional Marine Brigade in the Naktong Bulge area of the US 2nd Infantry Division front. It bivouacked that night on the banks of the Naktong near Susan-nil. On the morning of the 4th, before it could begin relief of the US Marine Corps forces there, the 24th Infantry Division received a new order to proceed to Kyongju. The assistant division commander, Brigadier General Garrison H. Davidson, proceeding at once by jeep, arrived at Kyongju that evening. Division troops and the US 19th Infantry Regiment started at 13:00 the next day, September 5, and, traveling over muddy roads, most of them arrived at Kyongju just before midnight. Major General John H. Church, the 24th Division commander, had arrived there during the day. All division units had arrived by 07:00, September 6. Coulter knew the KPA 15th Division had crossed the Taegu lateral corridor at Yongch'on and was heading in the direction of Kyongju. On September 6, he ordered the US 21st Infantry to attack the next day up the valley and bordering hills that lead northwest from Kyongju into the high mountain mass in the direction of Yongch'on. When it attacked there on September 7 the 21st Infantry encountered virtually no opposition. At 12:30 Eighth Army redesignated Task Force Jackson as Task Force Church, and at 13:00 Coulter departed Kyongju for Taegu to resume his planning duties. Church was now in command on the eastern front. That afternoon, September 7, Church canceled Coulter's order for the 21st Infantry to attack into the mountains. He felt it was a useless dispersion of troops and he wanted the regiment concentrated near Kyongju. Church made still another change in the disposition of the task force. On the 8th he moved its command post from Kyongju to the vicinity of Choyang-ni, south. He believed the command post could be more easily defended there in the open if attacked than in a town, and that traffic congestion near it would be less.  Deadlock  ROK troops advance to the front lines near P'ohang-dong in 1950. Fighting continued between the KPA and the ROK Capital Division on the hills bordering the valley from An'gang-ni to Kyongju. The US 3rd Battalion, 19th Infantry, became involved there just after midnight on September 8–9. A KPA force attacked K Company and drove it from Hill 300, a defensive position midway between An'gang-ni and Kyongju. KPA held the hill during September 9 against counterattack. Farther north, on the left side of the valley, the ROK 17th Regiment attacked and, with the support of the US 13th Field Artillery Battalion, captured Hill 285 and held it against several KPA counterattacks. On the opposite, east side of the valley the ROK 18th Regiment made limited gains. These battles took place in drenching typhoon rains. Low-hanging clouds allowed very little air support. The rains finally ceased on September 10. In this second week of September elements of the KPA 5th Division had spread out over the hills west, southwest, and south of P'ohang-dong. One KPA force, estimated to number 1,600 men, reached Hills 482 and 510, southwest of Yonil Airfield. Facing this force were two regiments of the ROK 3rd Division, which held a defensive position on the hills bordering the west side of the valley south of the airfield. KPA pressure threatened to penetrate between the two ROK regiments. On the evening of September 9, Church formed Task Force Davidson to eliminate this threat to Yonil. The airfield itself had not been used since the middle of August except for emergency landing and refueling of planes, but evacuation of USAF equipment, bombs, and petroleum products was still in progress. Davidson commanded the task force, which was composed of the US 19th Infantry, less the 3rd Battalion, the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Infantry, the 13th Field Artillery Battalion, C Battery of the 15th Field Artillery Battalion, A Company of the 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion, the 9th Infantry Regimental Tank Company, two batteries of antiaircraft automatic weapons, and other miscellaneous units. With the KPA having cut off all other approaches from the Kyongju area, the task force spent all of September 10 making a circuitous southern approach to its objective. It arrived in its assembly area at Yongdok-tong, south of Yonil Airfield, at 19:00 that evening. Davidson early that morning had flown on ahead from Kyongju to Yongdok-tong. Emmerich was there to meet him when his light plane landed on the road. On the flight over, Davidson looked for but did not see any KPA soldiers. Emmerich told Davidson the KPA had driven the ROK troops from Hill 131. This hill was on the southern side of the boundary between the two ROK regiments holding the Yonil defensive position. Davidson and Emmerich agreed that the ROK troops would have to recapture Hill 131 during the night and that then the task force would attack through the ROK 3rd Division to capture the main KPA positions on Hill 482. They thought that if the task force could establish the ROK troops on Hill 482 they should be able to hold it and control the situation thereafter. Emmerich took Davidson to meet the ROK 3rd Division commander. Davidson told him that he was in command in that area and informed him of his plan for the attack. That night the ROK troops succeeded recapturing Hill 131 and restoring their lines there. In this attack the ROK 3rd Engineer Battalion fought as infantry, and under the leadership and guidance of Captain Walter J. Hutchins, the KMAG adviser to the battalion, contributed heavily to the success.  North Koreans repulsed  The next morning, September 11, the 19th Infantry passed through the left-hand ROK regiment just south of Hill 131 and, with the 1st Battalion leading, attacked west. At 09:30 it captured without opposition the first hill mass west of its starting point. The 2nd Battalion then passed through the 1st Battalion and continued the attack toward Hill 482 (Unje-san), westward across a steep-sided gorge. There, KPA held entrenched positions, and their machine gun fire checked the 2nd Battalion for the rest of the day. The morning of September 12 four aircraft from No. 77 Squadron RAAF struck the KPA positions with napalm, and an artillery preparation followed the strike. The 2nd Battalion then launched its attack and secured Hill 482 about 12:00. That afternoon, ROK forces relieved Task Force Davidson on the hill mass, and the task force descended to the valley southwest of Yongdok-tong for the night. On September 13, Task Force Davidson returned to Kyongju. While this action was in progress near Yonil Airfield, the week-long battle for Hill 300 north of Kyongju came to an end. A regiment of the ROK 3rd Division captured the hill on September 11. In midafternoon the 3rd Battalion, US 19th Infantry, relieved the ROK troops there. Scattered over Hill 300 lay 257 counted KPA dead and great quantities of abandoned equipment and weapons, some of it American. In this fighting for Hill 300, the US 3rd Battalion, 19th Infantry, 37 men killed. September 12 is considered as the day when the KPA offensive in the east ended. By that date, the KPA 12th Division had been virtually destroyed and the KPA 5th Division was trying to consolidate its survivors near P'ohang- dong. Aerial observers reported sighting many KPA groups moving north and east. The ROK 3rd Division followed the withdrawing KPA 5th Division, and the ROK Capital Division advanced against the retreating survivors of the KPA 12th Division. On September 15 some elements of the Capital Division reached the southern edge of An'gang-ni. Reports indicated that KPA troops were retreating toward Kigye. With the threat in the east subsiding, Eighth Army dissolved Task Force Church, effective at 12:00 September 15, and the ROK resumed control of the ROK I Corps. Eighth Army also ordered the US 24th Infantry Division to move to Kyongsan, southeast of Taegu, in a regrouping of forces. The US 21st Infantry Regiment had already moved there on the 14th. The US 9th Infantry was to remain temporarily at Kyongju in Eighth Army reserve.  Aftermath  North and South Korean forces suffered heavily in the battle, each side inflicted large numbers of casualties on one another. The exact numbers of casualties are impossible to determine. Both sides are known to have suffered heavily. Following the counterattack at Inchon on 15 September and the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter starting on 16 September, the KPA units in the sector fled back north, no more than a few thousand troops from the KPA 5th and 12th divisions were known to have returned to North Korea. US casualties, in the meantime, were relatively light. In the eastern battles during the first two weeks of September, the ROK troops, demoralized though they were, did most of the ground fighting. US tanks, artillery, and ground units supported them. Uncontested UN aerial supremacy and naval gunfire from offshore also supported the ROK, and probably were the factors that tipped the scales in their favor. After the initial phase of their September offensive, the KPA labored under what proved to be insurmountable difficulties in supplying their forward units. The KPA system of supply could not resolve the problems of logistics and communication necessary to support and exploit an offensive operation in this sector of the front. Nevertheless, the breakthrough was severe enough that the Eighth Army considered pulling back for several days, eventually deciding to stand its ground.

April 17, 1715) was a Scots trader and the first Indian agent of the Province of Carolina. He is best known for recording Native American customs and practices in the 1690s and 1700s, and for articulating visions and policies that guided colonial policy toward Indians. Apparently a settler in the failed Scottish colony of Stuarts Town (near present-day Port Royal, South Carolina), he traveled widely throughout the southeast, ranging as far as the Mississippi River,Nairne, pp. 3–5 and served in the Carolina provincial assembly. He was tortured to death by Yamasee in April 1715 during the Yamasee War.Crane, pp. 168–169  Early life  The early life of Thomas Nairne is for the most part unknown, It is known that before he was one of the Indian agents for the Province of Carolina he had arrived in South Carolina from Scotland in 1695. In that same year he married to his wife Elizabeth Quintyne, a widow and mother of four children. In 1698 they had a son together named Thomas.  Political works  After arriving in South Carolina Thomas Nairne found a political role quite quickly. In 1707 Nairne became a representative of the House of Commons Assembly for the Colleton County. As a member of the House of Commons Assembly he was key member in the group organized to oppose the current Governor Nathaniel Johnson. The group's objective was to draft new laws such as changing the Indian trade with the goal to remove the governor from being involved in the Indian trade. In the early 1700s the House of Commons created the office of Indian agents through the Board of Indian Commissioners act.  Indian agent  Thomas Nairne is known for being the first Indian agent for South Carolina. As an Indian agent his job was to manage and supervise the delicate cross culture trading between the colonists and the Indians, and resolve any issues that may arise between them. Thomas Nairne didn't just work to maintain peace with the tribes, but also to create and bolster allegiances between the British colonists and the Indian tribes in an effort to overpower the other European colonists. As an Indian agent some of Thomas Nairnes feats including arresting the Governor's son on charges of enslaving friendly Indians and illegally stealing deerskins, this wound up to backfire though as Governor Johnson charged Nairne with treason and he was forced to return to England to defend his actions. He also played the role of strategist as an Indian Agent going out to Indian Tribes to build alliances and strengthen their hold on the land. His most well known exploit happened during the conflicts between the English and the French, Nairne devised a plan to put pressure or seduce the Indians who had allied with the French, and use the Creek Indians to come down upon the French from the Tallapoosa River with a fleet of 80 canoes with 500 Indians coming by canoe, and another 1000 coming by land. In Nairnes memorial he claimed that he \\"ventured my life and made peace with the Choctas\\" (Moore, 1985, p. 52) and had amassed an army which stood willing to do his bidding. Ultimately the plan never made it to fruition as the French counteracted swiftly to bring the Choctaws and Chickasaws loyalties back to them. Neither the French nor the English were able to amass an Indian army against the other power and they continued to maintain their respective allies through the end of the Queen Annes War.  Death  Thomas Nairne's death came at the hand of the Yamasee Indians during his second tenure as an Indian agent. Thomas Nairne and another fellow Indian agent, John Wright, were dispatched to smooth over any lingering issues with the Yamasee. On April 14 they had a feast with the Yamasee and ensured them that any grievances would be redressed. After the feast the Englishmen went to bed satisfied that all issues had been resolved and there would be no more problems. Awaking on April 15, which was good Friday, they heard the sound of their calvary. The night before the Yamasee Indians decided there would be no peace and that the wrongdoings of their people had gone too far. At dawn the Indians were riding in killing any all Europeans without discrimination. Nairne was met with a stake at the center of the village. He was tortured for three days by the Yamasee before ultimately passing away on April 17, 1715. Notes  References  * Covington, J. W. (n.d.).

Plot Scene from The Pagan Trader Henry Slater (Donald Crisp) stops at a South Pacific island looking to obtain a cargo of copra. He is informed that half-caste Henry Shoesmith, Jr. (Ramon Novarro) owns the largest plantation, but is rather indolent. Meanwhile, Shoesmith is lolling around, while admirer Madge (Renée Adorée), wishes she had met him before she became a fallen woman. Then the young man hears a woman singing aboard a ship. He swims out and is strongly attracted to Tito (Dorothy Janis). She, however, rebuffs him. When the narrow- minded Slater first meets Shoesmith, he is quite rude to the native, but soon changes his manner when he learns who the young man is. The easygoing Shoesmith does not take offense, and is delighted to be formally introduced to Tito, Slater's half-caste ward. Slater starts to bargain for copra and is pleasantly surprised when Shoesmith offers him as much as he wants for free. He takes the precaution of having Shoesmith sign a contract to that effect. Tito eventually falls in love with Shoesmith, but Slater has other plans for her. He tells Shoesmith to stay away from his ward, using the excuse that Shoesmith has no ambition. He suggests to the naive younger man that he take out a bank loan and build up his business. Then he sails away with Tito and his copra. Shoesmith follows Slater's advice and runs a store, but Madge warns him he does not know what he is doing (he allows every customer to buy on credit). When Slater returns, Shoesmith asks Tito to marry him. She agrees. However, Slater informs the puzzled Shoesmith that the loan payments are overdue and that he is foreclosing on all of Shoesmith's property. In addition, Slater informs his ward that he will \\"sacrifice\\" himself to protect her by marrying her himself. Shoesmith is too late to stop the wedding, but while Madge distracts the guests, he carries Tito off to his native home. Slater finds Tito while Shoesmith is away, takes her back to his ship and starts to beat her. Shoesmith follows, and a fight ensues. The younger man wins, and he and Tito swim back toward the island. However, when they spot approaching sharks, they have no choice but to head back to Slater, pursuing in his dinghy. Slater takes Tito aboard, but keeps his rival at bay with a sword. Shoesmith swims under the boat to the other side and topples Slater into the water, where the sharks get him. The young couple return to their idyllic home.

These are probably best described as flame structures, or perhaps ball-and-pillow structures. Backpack is around half a meter high. A small reverse fault runs through the outcrop in the centre of the image. Soft-sediment deformation structures develop at deposition or shortly after, during the first stages of the sediment's consolidation. This is because the sediments need to be \\"liquid- like\\" or unsolidified for the deformation to occur. These formations have also been put into a category called water-escape structures by Lowe (1975). The most common places for soft-sediment deformations to materialize are in deep water basins with turbidity currents, rivers, deltas, and shallow-marine areas with storm impacted conditions. This is because these environments have high deposition rates, which allows the sediments to pack loosely.Allen, John R. L. Sedimentary Structures, Their Character and Physical Basis. Vol. 2. Amsterdam: Elsevier Scientific Pub., 1982. Print Types of soft-sediment deformation structures *Convolute bedding forms when complex folding and crumpling of beds or laminations occur. This type of deformation is found in fine or silty sands, and is usually confined to one rock layer. Convolute laminations are found in flood plain, delta, point-bar, and intertidal-flat deposits. They generally range in size from 3 to 25 cm, but there have been larger formations recorded as several meters thick.Boggs, S., 2006, Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy (4th ed.), Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, p.94-97 *Flame structures consist of mud and are wavy or \\"flame\\" shaped. These flames usually extend into an overlying sandstone layer. This deformation is caused from sand being deposited onto mud, which is less dense. Load casts, technically a subset of sole markings, below, are the features which form alongside flame structures. Flames are thin fingers of mud injected upward into the overlying sands, while load casts are the pendulous knobs of sand that descend downwards into the mud between the flames. *Slump structures are mainly found in sandy shales and mudstones, but may also be in limestones, sandstones, and evaporites. They are a result of the displacement and movement of unconsolidated sediments, and are found in areas with steep slopes and fast sedimentation rates. These structures often are faulted. *Dish structures are thin, dish-shaped formations that normally occur in siltstones and sandstones. The size of each \\"dish\\" often ranges from 1 cm to 50 cm in size, and forms as a result of dewatering. Pillar structures often appear along with dish structures and also form by dewatering. They have a vertical orientation, which cuts across laminated or massive sands. These formations can range from a few millimeters in diameter to larger than a meter. *Sole markings are found on the underside of sedimentary rocks that overlie shale beds, usually sandstones. They are used for determining the flow direction of old currents because of their directional features. Sole markings form from the erosion of a bed, which creates a groove that is later filled in by sediment.Boggs, S., 2006, Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy (4th ed.), Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, p.98-99 *Seismites are sedimentary beds disturbed by seismic waves from earthquakes.Seilacher, A., 1969, Fault-graded beds interpreted as seismites, Sedimentology, 13, p. 15-159Seilacher, A., 1984, Sedimentary structures tentatively attributed to seismic events, Marine Geology, 55, p. 1-12 They are commonly used to interpret the seismic history of an area.Bachmann, G.H., Aref, M.A.M., 2005, \\"A seismite in Triassic gypsum deposits (Grabfeld Formation, Ladinian), southwestern Germany\\", Sedimentary Geology, 180, p. 75–89 The term has also been applied to soft sediment deformation structures,Ettensohn, F.R.; Rast, N.; Brett, C.E.

The lyrics for \\"The Way You Love Me\\" are about a woman in a committed relationship, whose sexual desire for her lover leads her to openly and explicitly describe her feelings for him. It features rough and aggressive vocals by Hilson. The clean version of the song was generally well received by music critics who called it raunchy, and praised how the intense vocal delivery of Hilson matched effectively with the rapid pace and heavy beat of the song. Several of them also chose it as a stand-out track from No Boys Allowed. The song's accompanying music video was created as a mini-movie, and was directed by Laurieann Gibson. It features cameo appearances from JoJo, Faith Evans, Dawn Richard, Columbus Short and Polow Da Don. After its premiere on November 28, 2010, on a hip-hop site WorldStarHipHop.com, it received negative criticism from critics because of the limited amount of clothing Hilson wore in the video. Some critics also stated that certain scenes of the video nearly resembled those of a pornography movie. Hilson told Hot 97s Angie Martinez, that she would not be making any apologies for the explicit lyrics as well as the provocative video. Additionally, in an interview with celebrity blogger Perez Hilton, she defended the clip calling the video \\"racy\\" but in line with the perspective of her album. She also firmly stated that she would not allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and cannot do. Background Ross performing in 2011 \\"The Way You Love Me\\" was written by Stanley Benton, India Boodram, Paul Dawson, Hilson, Kesia Hollins, Jazmyn Michel, William Roberts and was produced by Polow da Don and Hollywood Hot Sauce. The song features additional vocals from rapper Rick Ross. Before the release No Boys Allowed, \\"The Way You Love Me\\" leaked online on November 7, 2010, and a music video was filmed for it. Both received much coverage by several media outlets who deemed the lyrics as explicit and the video as provocative because of the limited amount of clothing Hilson wore in it. On the unedited version of \\"The Way You Love Me\\" Hilson uses more sexually explicit phrasing and repeatedly uses the word \\"fuck\\". In December 2010, Keri confirmed a clean version of the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made. The line \\"I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets\\" was replaced by \\"I got the kind of lovin' that'll keep you out the streets\\", and the word \\"fuck\\" was replaced with the word \\"thug\\", while in others it was removed altogether. Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: \\"When I got the record, I most definitely knew she was going to another level and I was excited for [Hilson]. I love to see the creative side. She's a sexy female and I think she showed that. When I think of Janet Jackson when I was coming up and she was doing her Control thing, I loved it. So if that's the feeling that young people [are getting] or whoever is feeling the music, if that's the inspiration they get, I think it's dope.\\" Composition \\"The Way You Love Me\\" is an R&B-dance-pop; song which displays influences of electro, and rock music. It features a \\"squealing\\" synth, a banging fast-paced beat, screaming, rough as well as at times hoarse vocals and blaring sonics. According to the staff members of Idolator, the beat in the background is augmented by hand-claps similar to that of \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" (2008) by Beyoncé Knowles, most noticeable toward the end. According to a press release by Interscope Records, the song's lyrics make reference to a \\"raw infectious club-thumping message to female empowerment\\" and about being in a committed relationship. She further said the sentiment reflected in the song is \\"exactly what her girls are apt to shout behind closed doors\\" and that the lyrics are meant to reflect a woman's many moods and shifting desires: \\"I write from a female perspective, but I'm also telling men what women are really thinking and feeling about them. I don't want to be held and caressed every night. I'm talking about one man in the relationship. I'm not talking about being a slut and a whore.\\" As stated by Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song features an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a \\"frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery.\\" During the bridge and the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: \\"Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / You know how I like it Daddy when you hit the spot / Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when I climb up on top\\". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is \\"so good, I'll make you think the bed is my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets\\" just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: \\"She looks like an angel, but she's sexy as hell.\\" As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back. Reception The clean version of \\"The Way You Love Me\\" garnered generally positive reviews from music critics who noted the effective melding of the intense vocal delivery of Hilson with the rapid pace and banging beat of the song. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that all the five songs Hilson penned for No Boys Allowed, with the exception of the \\"frantic electronic firework 'The Way You Love Me', are too featureless to make an impression.\\" Ben Hatliff of The New York Times commented that Hilson \\"gets a certain energy out of bossiness\\" on \\"The Way You Love Me\\" which according to him, goes far for a mainstream female singer in its boasting and sexual hunger. He also added that \\"it sometimes seems as if it were not a man at all she wants to boss around but Rihanna.\\" Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Hilson moves \\"to a gritted-teeth half-rapped, half-sung approach\\" for \\"The Way You Love Me\\". He went on complimenting the heavy beat of the song which according to him, matches the \\"shouted vocals\\" of the singer on the song. Andy Kellman of Allmusic called \\"The Way You Love Me\\" the most emblematic track on No Boys Allowed. He praised the line \\"I got the kinda lovin' that'll keep you off the streets\\" and describing the song as rowdy and sexually direct, he concluded that it could be ideal for \\"the soundtrack to a straight-to-DVD Showgirls sequel.\\" Glenn Gamboa of Newsday found that Hilson gets incredibly riled up on \\"The Way You Love Me\\". Rob Sheffield chose \\"The Way You Love Me\\" as one of the high points that are worth digging out and called its content \\"electro-porn.\\" Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly called the song a \\"raunchy\\" one. Chris Parkin Yahoo! Music commented that the \\"fantastic banger 'The Way you Love Me' [...], [a] filthy song, that makes like the oversexed, doolally cousin of Beyoncé Knowles' \\"Crazy in Love\\" (2003). Idolator's staff members described \\"The Way you Love Me\\" as a \\"pretty much the definition of down-and-dirty, adequately conveying a sexual energy perfect for, shall we say, a 'particular' type of dancing.\\" They also said that vocals of Hilson sound \\"less like it was recorded during the throes of passion and more like someone just cut her off on the freeway\\". However, they ended up saying that the song works. Neil Miller, Jr. of UR Chicago called \\"The Way You Love Me\\" an undeniable standout on the record thanks to its \\"serious bass to rattle your trunk, some tweaked out synth stabs, and Hilson's bad bitch attitude.\\" By contrast, Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine said that it seems that Hilson has begun trusting her ability \\"to thrust her hips toward recoiling cameras more than she believes in the power of her vocal track.\\" Controversy The unedited version of \\"The Way You Love Me\\" received very negative reception from music critics. The song has come under severe condemnation for its explicit lyrics, particularly the lines \\"Fuck me, fuck me\\" and \\"I got the kinda pussy that'll keep you out the streets\\". Critics accused the singer of swerving into a racy lane just for page views and album sales for No Boys Allowed. However, she insisted that she \\"was setting the record straight.\\" In an interview with Hot 97s Angie Martinez, Hilson stated firmly that she would not apologize for the explicit lyrics or the provocative video: Hilson later told Jocelyn Vena of MTV News that she was indeed a little bit surprised by the reaction she was getting concerning \\"The Way You Love Me\\". She clarified that the song was not just sexual: \\"In that record I'm talking about one guy, I'm talking about one night and this is what I want on this one night, and I'm not afraid to say it. Not just sexual, I just mean whatever—open your mouth. That's empowering to me. That's what the song is about.\\" In an interview with Perez Hilton, Hilson said that she cannot allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and what cannot do. She also dismissed the negative reviews, because she knew some women were \\"empowered\\" by its message. She added that listeners have to be fearless and stand for what they believe in and concluded by saying that \\"The Way You Love Me\\" is not meant for children. Music video A scantily dressed Hilson shown licking a metal door, one of the provocative scenes of the music video. The music video for \\"The Way You Love Me\\", a mini-movie of about seven minutes long, was shot in Los Angeles during October 2010 and was directed by Laurieann Gibson. It premiered on November 28, 2010 on a hip-hop site, WorldStarHipHop.com. It also features cameo appearances from JoJo, Faith Evans, Dawn Richard, Columbus Short and Polow Da Don. According to Rap-Up, \\"[Hilson and her girls] work their charm on the boys, including Rick Ross, Columbus Short, and Polow Da Don.\\" In the video, Hilson plays \\"femme fatale B.B.\\". The video was released to iTunes Stores on December 7, 2010. Synopsis The video begins in a room with a man named Fuzz (Polow da Don) telling B.B. (Hilson) and her gun-slinging women crew consisting of Boots (JoJo), Danja (Evans), and Money (Dawn Richard) about bringing in Hilson's boyfriend into custody. After Hilson assures Jammal that she can handle it, the song begins and Hilson are seen wearing outfits of black bikinis as they dance seductively to the song's chorus and verse. Meanwhile, Hilson and her crew are back in the room preparing themselves with scenes of Hilson grinding against a large vault door. As the song moves to the pre-chorus, Hilson and her crew are shown at a party, mingling with the male guests and handing them drinks. As Ross' verse begins, he, Short and da Don are shown at the party as Hilson's crew grind themselves around them and Hilson kisses Short's head. The song pauses and Hilson and her crew move into a room with Polow da Don, Short, and Ross sitting in chair with other men in the background. Unexpectedly, her crew all pull out their guns. Short (who has turned out to be Hilson's target) is able to respond almost immediately by having his men pull out their guns. Seeing they are evenly matched, Short agrees to let Hilson take him into custody, with Hilson removing her top and locking them both in handcuffs. The two walk upstairs, where Short pushes Hilson against the wall and they kiss on the stairway. The video ends with Short following Hilson upstairs while the words \\"To be continued...\\" appear on the screen. Reception Music critics universally criticized the video because of the limited amount of clothing Hilson wore in it. In an interview with gossip hound Perez Hilton, Hilson defended the clip, calling the video \\"racy\\" but in line with the perspective of her album: \\"If you put it in context with my album, my album is called No Boys Allowed but really it means no bullshit allowed. In this album, I was screaming in a room — just like I was screaming in the song — I was screaming in a room with all my girlfriends, yelling all the shit we really say.\\" Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote: \\"A platinum-blond Keri gyrates, thrusts, licks and gets (way) low as she laces the song with enough saucy language and expletives to make your favorite rapper blush.\\" while Jocelyn Vena the same news division of MTV commented that even though there are several cameo appearances in the mini-move, it is ultimately Hilson's \\"scantily clad popping and locking that has everyone buzzing.\\" Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine called the video \\"overproduced and under-clothed.\\" Mariel Concepcion of Billboard wrote that she first saw the video for \\"The Way You Love Me\\", it seemed like Hilson was trying a bit hard to her. However, part of her could appreciate that Hilson does what she wants and that she is confident enough to do it. Concepcion further stated: \\"Then I watched the above interview she did with Perez Hilton, and it made me respect her even more. She stood her ground and made no excuses for her words or her visuals, and I can dig that.\\" Niki A. M. of Vibe wrote that Hilson \\"made quite tails wag with her titillating video\\" and that \\"men reeled over the scantily clad vixen gyrating and shouting sexplicit phrases like \\"fuck me\\" while females seethed in disappointment over her crotch shots that went viral just days ago.\\" Becky Bain, writing for Idolator, stated that \\"the stilted dialog between Hilson and Columbus Short near the end of the mini-movie as well as the former's delivery makes the scene come off like the beginning of a porn movie, and unsurprisingly, the scene ends much like a porn movie.\\" References 2010 songs Dance-pop songs Keri Hilson songs Music videos directed by Laurieann Gibson Song recordings produced by Polow da Don Songs written by Keri Hilson Songs written by Rick Ross Songs written by Hollywood Hot Sauce ","title":"The Way You Love Me (Keri Hilson song)"},{"id":"30002259","text":"Ramiz Hasanov Ayvaz oglu (; born August 20, 1961) is an Azerbaijani politician who serves as the Chairman of State Committee on Standardization, Metrology and Patents of Azerbaijan Republic.

On that date the STAVKA ordered: The initial composition of the Don Front was as follows: *1st Guards Army - Kirill Moskalenko, *21st Army - Nikolay Krylov, *24th Army - Dmitry Timofeyevich Kozlov, *63rd Army - Vasily Kuznetsov, *66th Army - Rodion Malinovsky, *4th Tank Army - Vasily Kryuchenkin, *16th Air Army - Sergei Rudenko.

History  North Korea's relations with the Palestine Liberation Organization began in 1966. Kim Il- sung and Yasser Arafat had a very close relationship and North Korea provided aid to the Palestinians. North Korean support for the PLO began in the 1970s and included the supply of small amounts of arms and military aid. North Korean arms in the Middle East included aid to several leftist factions and revolutionary movements such as the PLO and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. North Korean arms and aid to Palestinian factions continued until the opening up of China under Deng Xiaoping and political reforms in the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev during the 1980s. After the fall of the Soviet Union, North Korean involvement in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict declined and North Korea shifted from the exporting of revolution to pragmatism. Since then North Korea has continued to support the Palestinian cause and has strongly condemned every Israeli action in the region. During the Gaza War (2008–09), North Korea harshly condemned Israeli actions. A Foreign Ministry spokesman denounced the killing of unarmed civilians and called it a crime against humanity as well as a threat to the Middle East Peace Process.

This term has traditionally been used when referring to performers in a daytime soap opera.  SAG-AFTRA rules  An under-five role falls between an extra (a nonspeaking role) and a day player (a full part). Per SAG-AFTRA, for an under-five the total number of words in the five lines or less must be below 50. Exceeding this reclassifies the role as a full part, which constitutes a substantial rise in pay. An extra may be upgraded to under-five status if they interact with principals or are given direction in a way that furthers the plot. Prior to the 2012 merger of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), actors performing as under-fives as members of AFTRA became eligible for SAG membership after one year. Post merger, actors performing with an under-five contract operate as members of the consolidated union. Through November 16, 2016, the minimum pay rate for an under-five actor on a soap opera is $451 for a one-hour show, and $369 for a -hour show. By comparison, the minimum pay rate for a principal on a soap opera is $1,038 for a one-hour show, and $778 for a -hour show. The pay rate for a background actor on a soap opera is $150 for a 1-hour show, and $115 for a -hour show.  Under-five work  An under-five role can be a stepping stone to bigger roles.

Other vernacular names include Cornish salmon and herring hake. It is a predatory species which was often netted alongside one of its favoured prey, the Atlantic herring, thus the latter common name. It is found in the eastern Atlantic from the Norway and Iceland south to Mauritania and into the Mediterranean Sea. It is an important species in European fisheries and is heavily exploited with some populations thought to be being fished unsustainably. Description Merluccius merluccius Merluccius merluccius is a slim-bodied fish with a large head and large jaws on which are set a number of large curved teeth, the lower jaw has two rows of teeth and the upper jaw has one row. The inside of the mouth and the branchial cavity are black. The body is at its widest just behind its head. It has two dorsal fins; the first is triangular in shape, high with a short base, while the second is long, nearly the same length as the anal fin, and both the second dorsal fin and the anal fan have a slightly convex profile. The first dorsal fin has a single spine and 7 to 10 fin rays; the second dorsal fin has 36 to 40 fin rays and the anal fin has 36 to 40 fin rays. The tips of the pectoral fins extend to the level of the origin of the abnal fin in young fish which are less than in standard length but does not do so in adults. The caudal fin is well-developed and has a truncate margin. The lateral line is straight and darker than the background colour. It is blue-grey on the back, silvery on the flanks and whitish on the underside. They grow to but this is rare and a more common larger size is . Distribution Merluccius merluccius is found in the eastern Atlantic from Norway and Iceland, south along the European coast to the Straits of Gibraltar and south along the west coast of Africa to Mauritania. It also occurs in the Mediterranean Sea. It extends into the Black Sea but it is restricted to the southern shorelines of this sea. In the Baltic Sea it does not normally extend further east than the Kattegat but it has been recorded as far east as Lithuania. Habitat and biology The European hake is normally found at depths of between and , although it may also occur within a wider range of depths, being found from inshore waters as shallow as down to . During the day it stays close to the bottom and at night it becomes more active and uses more of the water column. This species has a very long spawning period which differs between populations, spawning occurs latest in the more northerly populations, in the Mediterranean spawning lasts from December to June, February-May in the Bay of Biscay, April–July off western Iceland, and May–August off western Scotland. In the Adriatic Sea spawning occurs throughout the year but peaks in summer and winter. The female hake are partial spawners which can lay eggs four or five times during a spawning season with rests in between. Spawning occurs between 100 and 300 m depth in the Mediterranean and in the Celtic Sea at depths no greater than . In the Adriatic the recruitment of young hake into the breeding stock has two peaks, the first peak occurs in the spring and the second one in the autumn. Juveniles live on muddy bottoms up to the age of 3 years old when they move towards the coast. Most females attain sexual maturity during their seventh year at around in length, while for males this occurs in their fifth year and on attaining a length of in the Atlantic, whereas in the Mediterranean, males mature at and females at . The females are faster growing than the males and each female has a fecundity which is reported as 2 to 7 million eggs per female. They live to a maximum age of 20 years old. The principal spawning grounds are in the southern portion of its range in the canyons and rocky bottoms of the Bay of Biscay in the shelf break area. The maximum production of eggs occurs at depths of approximately . The larvae are either deposited in the nursery areas of the Bay of Biscay or swept further out to sea, depending on the direction of the current. The more larvae deposited in the nursery areas is highly correlated with successful recruitment of adult hake into the population. After two months, the eggs hatch and the juvenile hake demonstrate a diel vertical migration, staying near the muddy bottoms during daylight hours and ascending to feed at shallower depths during the night. The adults also prefer to rest near the bottom during the day but they do not ascend to as near the surface as the juveniles Individual hake may be seen foraging alone near the seabed but higher in the water column they tend to feed in shoals. Small European hake up to long, those less than a year old, feed mostly on crustaceans such as krill, mysids and amphipods. It is at this stage of their lives that they prefer deeper water. As they grow and become more piscivorous they migrate to shallower areas where they start to feed on fish. In the Adriatic their main prey are pilchard (Sardina pilchardus), European sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), as well as Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), Horse mackerel Trachurus spp. and they can also be cannibalistic. Cephalopods were also recorded in the stomachs of sampled hakes from the Adriatic. In the north east Atlantic this species has been recorded feeding on blue whiting, horse mackerel and clupeids and it is regarded as an apex predator in this area. In the central Mediterranean Sea the young hake, between and in total length, fed predominantly on the euphasiid Nictiphanes couchi and the mysid Lophogaster typicus with decapods as secondary prey. At total lengths between and had a more varied diet with an increased utilisation of euphausiids but they also consumed an increased number of decapods, these were from a wide variety of species, such as Chlorotocus crassicornis, Alpheus glaber, Plesionika heterocarpus, Pasiphaea sivado, and Solenocera membranacea with fish and mysids being less important. Small cephalopods especially Sepiolidae, Sepietta oweniana and Alloteuthis media were also taken. As the hake grows larger fish become more important in the diet, hake with total lengths of between and have diets dominated by clupeids, especially pilchards and anchovies. Once a length of was attained the fish had shifted to an entirely piscivorous diet and the favoured prey changed to centracanthids such as Spicara flexuosa and Centracanthus cirrus with the importance of clupeids declining at the same time. Decapods were also taken, especially Processa spp. and Solenocera membranacea while mysids, euphasiids and cephalopods were not a feature of the diets of these larger fish. The rate of cannibalism recorded increased with increasing size with the larger fish having a diet consisting of up to 71% smaller conspecifics. In the Atlantic off the Portuguese coasts a study found that hake were opportunistic feeders and preferred the demersal fish species that were most abundant at any given time with the main prey blue whiting, Atlantic mackerel, chub mackerel, European anchovy and pilchard. Its habit of feeding on clupeids led to the vernacular name \\"herring hake\\", this may lead to hake being netted along with the herring. This is consistent with a 19th- century account: \\"It is a very voracious fish, devouring great numbers of herrings and pilchards; hence it is frequently called the Herring Hake.\\" Parasites Merluccius merluccius parasites have been well studied and as many as nineteen species of metazoan pararsited have been identified on hake in a single study from the Mediterranean. These included five species of ectoparasite, one species of monogean and four species of copepod and fourteen species of endoparasite made up of platyhelminths: four digeneans, two cestodes and six nematodes: as well as two acanthocephalans. Fisheries Hake - Mercato Orientale - Genoa, Italy - DSC02485 Merluccius merluccius is one of the most important demersal quarry species for fisheries over the western European continental shelf and this means that it is extensively studied. This species is vulnerable to overfishing because it grows slowly and the females attain sexual maturity at a relatively old age. However, there is still some uncertainty around both its population structure and the state of the stocks. More than 160,000 tonnes were landed in 1955 compared to approximately tonnes in 2000 although this increased to nearly tonnes in 2009 and 2010. Around were landed during 2011 at United Kingdom ports, and this catch was valued £22.5 million, however only 200 tonnes of hake were consumed in the UK that year, so most of this catch was exported. There are two main stocks of European Hake in the Atlantic, a northern and a southern one. The northern stock is thought to be being exploited within its safe biological limits and to have an increasing population, although in 2011 the total allowable catch was succeeded by up to 30%. The southern and Mediterranean populations are thought to be being overexploited and the fisheries to be outside sustainable limits. For example, in the Gulf of Lions hake constituted an important fraction of commercial landings but the stock has been overexploited so that only juveniles and young adults occur on the continental shelf following decades of intensive bottom trawling. The main fishing areas where hake at caught are to the north and west of Scotland, the west and South of Ireland, the Bay of Biscay, the Portuguese coast and the western coast North Africa. Conservation The northern European hake stock has recovered since the introduction of measures in 2001. Fisheries are regulated through restrictions on fishing effort, such as selectivity, fishing closures and minimum landing size. Additionally, individual states lay down their own regulations on matters such as minimum landing size, examples being Turkey where the minimum landing size is or Morocco where it is , this is also the European Union's minimum landing size. M. merluccius has been assessed on some Regional red Lists and the population in the Mediterranean is classed a Vulnerable, in the Baltic as Near Threatened and that in the Eastern Central Atlantic as Least Concern. Overall the Northeast Atlantic stock appears to be expanding its range, and of the two distinct stocks, northern and southern, the northern stock has shown an increase in stock biomass, which over the five years to 2015 increased by a factor of five. On the other hand, the southern stock is still overfished, albeit slightly, and the stock biomass in the 10 years to 2015 increased. Therefore, the IUCN class Merluccius merluccius as Least Concern. Use as food Pescada á galega European hake is mainly sold in its fresh form, but it may also be frozen, dried, salted and canned. The flesh has a mild flavour, more subtle than that of cod with a white flaky texture. The raw flesh is quite soft but when it has been cooked the texture changes to firm and meaty. In France this popular species is marketed as \\"colin\\" and occasionally as \\"saumon blanc\\", i.e. \\"white salmon\\". It is also a popular food fish in Iberia where it is grilled, pan-fried and baked. The meat can be matched with strong flavours and hake is often cooked with tomatoes, garlic, chorizo and paprika.

It was set up in the course of Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. Formation Ukrainian People's Militia, created in June 1941, preceded the official founding of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police in mid-August 1941 by Heinrich Himmler. There is conclusive historical evidence indicating that members of the Ukrainian Militia took a leading role in the 1941 Lviv pogroms, resulting in the massacre of 6,000 Polish Jews, after the German army reached Lwów (Lemberg) at the end of June in Soviet-occupied eastern Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine). Initially the Ukrainian militia acted independently, with the blessings of the SS, but later were limited to joint operations (Aktionen) with German units or otherwise functioned directly under the Nazi command.Jakob Weiss, The Lemberg Mosaic, New York: Alderbrook Press, 2011; pp. 165–174 (chpt. Prison Massacre), 206–210 (chpt. Petlura Days). The Ukrainian People's Militia was active in occupied territories behind the Wehrmacht lines, assisting the German Security Police and the Einsatzgruppen while the army kept advancing in the direction of Zhytomyr, Rivne and Kiev. Heinrich Himmler was appointed Chief of SS and Police for the Eastern Territories on 17 July 1941 and decreed the formation of the Schutzmannschaften from among the non-German auxiliaries. In mid-August he regrouped the indigenous militia which had sprung up under the military rule to form the core of the official Ukrainische Hilfspolizei. Before that, members of the Ukrainian militia in formerly Polish cities with sizeable Polish-Jewish presence compiled lists of targets for the branch offices of the KdS and assisted with the roundups (as in Stanisławów, Włodzimierz Wołyński, Lutsk). In Korosten, the Militia rounded up 238 Jews described as \\"a source of continuous unrest\\" and carried out the killings by themselves.Ronald Headland (1992), Messages of Murder: A Study of the Reports of the Einsatzgruppen of the Security Police and the Security Service, 1941–1943.

With about 25,000 inhabitants, it is one of the most populated borough of Mainz and comes before Oberstadt and after Neustadt as the second biggest part of the capital town.  History  Protohistory The history of Gonsenheim reaches back to the Neolithic Era, the Chalcolithic Europe (2800 to 2400 B.C.). Finds of prehistoric people in Gonsenheim can be dated back to the late Neolithic period (2800 BC to 2200 BC). The Beilde pot find in the Gewann Auf dem Kästrich (today: \\"An der Ochsenwiese\\") near the Gonsenheim railway station is probably of supra-regional significance for Gonsenheim's prehistory. Here, in 1850, five polished flat Jadeite axes were found in the sand dunes typical of Gonsenheim, which can be assigned to the Late Neolithic period. These axes were of high material value at that time and were probably imported from the Maritime Alps. From the time of the hill grave culture (1600-1300/1200 BC) there are some grave finds from hill graves in Gonsenheim; the settlements belonging to them could not yet be located. Traces of human settlements in Gonsenheim can be dated for the first time to the Late Bronze Age (Urnfield Period, ca. 1200 to 750 BC). From this time there are secured settlement finds in the western Gonsbach valley. These settlement traces date back to the late Urnfield period or even to the early Iron Age or Hallstatt Period, which began in 750 BC. The Hallstatt period was associated with a significant increase in the number of settlements in Mainz, including Gonsenheim. Traces of settlements from both the older and the younger Hallstatt periods were found, for example on the lower slope of Gleisberg or Mühlweg. In the younger Iron or Latène Age (approx. 450 BC to 15 BC) the Gonsbachtal seems to have been uninhabited again according to current knowledge. It was reserved for a Celtic settlement of the later Latène period in Mainz-Weisenau to become the nucleus and eponym of the Roman Mogontiacum. Romans When Mogontiacum belonged to the Roman Empire, the Roman road Mogontiacum-Bingium (Bingen) was near Gonsenheim. At Gleisberg a villa rustica with numerous building and small finds such as mosaic floors, wall plastering, remains of a Roman bath house and a water pipe belonging to it could be found. Numerous other small finds such as coins, terracottas, glass vessels in many parts of the village as well as the presence of Roman cremation tombs in the area of today's industrial estate prove the presence of the Romans in Gonsenheim. In the valley of the Gonsbach in 2013/2014 extensive structural remains from the time around the 4th century were found during renaturation work, which could be identified by the responsible archaeologists as a stud farm, which was possibly operated by the military stationed in Mogontiacum. After the collapse of the Limes in the middle of the 3rd century, at the latest from the 4th and 5th centuries onwards, the Roman-Celtic rural population of Gonsenheim probably fled to the better fortified town of Mogontiacum. Its importance grew as a human settlement which became Gonsenheim by the foundation of a Merovingian settlement in the 6th century. This foundation expanded quickly due to the favorable location for agriculture. In 1938 Gonsenheim was suburbanised as a part of Mainz. Nowadays, Gonsenheim is still partially rustic and rural in character, despite its nearly 70 years affiliation to Mainz. Besides the old village core around St. Stephans church and the Renaissance town hall, there are the workers' quarters and mansions established in the middle of the 19th century, the tower blocks, with about 6.000 people living there, the commercial zone „Am Hemel“ and much nature like the small, but geo- ecologically and botanical supra-regionally important nature reserve of Mainz Sand Dunes „Großer Sand“ as well as parts of the Lennebergwald, the biggest connected forest in Rheinhessen. Franks Despite the extensive pre- Franconian history, the foundation of a permanently inhabited settlement in Gonsenheim dates back to Franconian times. The founder was probably a Franconian nobleman named Gunzo, who founded a larger farm in the area of today's Gonsenheim as the germ cell for the later settlement. The establishment of villages with the name ending -heim is typical for settlement foundations in the course of the so-called Frankish colonisation, which took place in the late 5th to 7th centuries. Gonsenheim is one of the villages founded in other Mainz suburbs such as Hechtsheim, Bretzenheim, Ebersheim or Laubenheim, which also date from this period. Already on 13 November 774 Gonsenheim was mentioned for the first time as \\"Guntzinheim\\" in a deed of donation of King Charlemagne to the monastery Fulda. In another deed of donation to the abbey of Lorsch dated 30 May 775 (deed no. 1090 dated 30 May 775), the town is named \\"Gunsenheim im Wormsgau\\". A donation of a certain Teurath, who gave the abbey five yokes of farmland and a meadow in the Gunsenheim district, was documented. Further, partly extensive donations to various monasteries (above all Lorsch) followed, especially in the Carolingian period, when Gonsenheim was a \\"royal estate\\". Altogether Gonsenheim is mentioned in five documents in the 8th century.  Location  The following communities border on Gonsenheim clockwise: in the north Mombach, in the east Hartenberg-Münchfeld, south Bretzenheim (Mainz) and Drais, in the west Finthen and northwest Budenheim. Gonsenheim lies in the Mainz basin on the Rheinhessen Plateau.  Climate  Like the rest of Rheinhessen (ROR), Gonsenheim is protected by Hunsrück, Taunus, Odenwald and Donnersberg. The annual rainfall is below 500 liters per square meter (19.7 in), which comes near to a semi- arid to Mediterranean climate.  History   Gonsenheim today  After its incorporation into Mainz, Gonsenheim's history as an independent village ended. Daily life did not change significantly; Gonsenheim remained a rural location. During the bombing of Mainz in World War II Gonsenheim was bombarded several times, causing nearly 600 civilian casualties. On 21 March 1945 American forces freed the suburb, ending the Third Reich for Gonsenheim.

History The manor house of Wittringen The noble family von Wittringen was first mentioned in an official document from 1263. Knight Ludolfus de Witteringe is today believed to have erected the castle around that time. The exact date is, however, unclear. Another document from 1394 mentions Heinrich von Brachtbecke, a distant ancestor of Nestlé manager Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, as the castle’s owner. The three Wolfsangeln of Brabeck's family crest were later also included in the crest of the city of Gladbeck. In 1438, the Herzog of Cleves granted the von Oeffte family enfeoffment of 50 percent of Wittringen. The family later acquired the other half and was thus the castle’s sole possessor for the next 150 years. In the mid-sixteenth century, Wittringen was given to the family of the Knights von Capellen as a betrothal gift. During the Thirty Years’ War, it was plundered by Hessian troops in 1642. In 1922, Freiherr Vittinghoff-Schell, then the owner of Wittringen, sold the castle to the city of Gladbeck. In the following years, it was extensively overhauled, using historic maps and plans. The manor house was re-modelled in its original style of the Dutch Renaissance. Since 1928, Wittringen has been home to the museum of Gladbeck (Museum der Stadt Gladbeck) and today it also hosts a restaurant. The castle is surrounded by spacious forests, parks and the Gladbeck Stadium.

Current anchor stores include Best Buy, HomeGoods, Kohl's, and Target. History Hawley Lane Mall opened in 1971 with two anchor stores, Caldor (featuring a two-story design and belt escalators) and a Waldbaum's supermarket. Other, smaller stores such as B. Dalton booksellers and Hawley Lane Shoes have also called the mall home. A third anchor store, Sage-Allen took up residence on the mall's new upper level in 1982. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the mall became less profitable due to expansions at both the Milford Crossroads & Trumbull Shopping Park malls. Sage-Allen went out of business in 1993, merging with to become Filene's, which in turn closed the Hawley Lane store so as not to compete with its larger locations in both Milford and Trumbull. Steinbach then took over the space between 1997 and 1999 before they went bankrupt. Caldor also went bankrupt in 1999, while at the same time all Waldbaum's stores closed and left the state. This left the mall with no anchor stores. Sale and new era Shortly after purchasing the mall, National Realty and Development Corp. spent $8 million on a refit of the entire property in 2005. The firm also managed to add Kohl's and then HomeGoods as new anchor stores, which were quickly followed by Target and Best Buy.

Child (1857–1931) was an entrepreneur who managed development and ranching companies in southern Montana. He was most notable as a founder and longtime president of the Yellowstone Park Company, which provided accommodation and transportation to visitors to Yellowstone National Park from 1892 to 1980. Child was, with park superintendent and National Park Service administrator Horace Albright, singularly responsible for the development of the park as a tourist destination and for the construction of much of the park's visitor infrastructure. Early life Stage coach at the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel Harry W. Child was born in San Francisco in 1857. After abandoning a course of educational preparation in Massachusetts for Harvard, Child returned to San Francisco via Panama. Back in San Francisco he helped to establish the San Francisco Stock Exchange in 1882. He arrived in Helena, Montana with his proceeds from that venture and established himself in mining, transportation and banking. By 1887 Child was working as manager of the Gloster and Gregory silver mines, owned by J. & W. Seligman & Co.. Somewhat later, Child successfully managed the construction of a smelter in Great Falls.Barringer, p. 36 Child became known for a bold approach to business. In 1887 he was involved in a labor dispute at the Gregory mine, negotiating a $250,000 payment to the miners, collecting the cash in Helena, and evading robbery attempts on the way back to the mine. In hindsight, the entire incident may have been set up by Child to obscure his own management error.Barringer, p. 37 In 1887 he In 1889 formed the short-lived Helena, Hot Springs and Smelter Railroad. One of his partners in the venture was his brother-in-law Edmund Bach. In 1892 Child and Bach formed the Yellowstone Park Transportation Company along with partners Silas Huntley (another brother-in- law) and Aaron and L.H. Hershfeld. Yellowstone Park Company Old Faithful Inn The Yellowstone Park Transportation Company had an exclusive agreement with the Northern Pacific Railway to transport arriving railroad passengers into the park. The railroad owned a majority interest in the Yellowstone Park Association, which ran the majority of the in-park Yellowstone hotel concessions. After the railroad's minority partners and managers in the YPA left the company, Child, Huntley and Bach bought the YPA in 1898 with financing from the railroad. Child became president of the company. Huntley died and Bach suffered political scandal. Bach and Huntley's stock reverted to the Northern Pacific, but Child bought enough of the stock to own half the business by 1905, and in 1907 bought the remainder from the Northern Pacific, which sought to divest itself of the company after the Northern Securities scandal. Again, the Northern Pacific provided financing of the purchase. In 1909 Child reorganized the company, dissolving the YPA and creating the Yellowstone Park Hotel Company, with himself as president, his son Huntley as treasurer and his son-in-law William Nichols as secretary.Barringer, p. 39 The Canyon Hotel Child aggressively expanded the hotel concession. At the turn of the century, the Upper Geyser Basin, the largest concentration of geysers in the world and home of Old Faithful, was a half-day's ride from the nearest hotel. Child obtained permission to build a hotel at the Upper Geyser Basin. He had met Robert Reamer, a young architect from San Diego, while both wintered in La Jolla, California. Child set Reamer to design and construct the Old Faithful Inn in 1903, which became an iconic example of rustic log construction. At about the same time Child and Reamer expanded the Lake Hotel and another hotel at the Yellowstone Canyon.Barringer, pp. 44-47 The same year, Child accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on his grand tour of Yellowstone. Child would also accompany Warren Harding in 1923, Calvin Coolidge in 1927, and future president Herbert Hoover in 1928. Child also conducted the King of Sweden through the park, receiving a knighthood in return.Barringer, pp. 82-83 In 1905, the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled against Child and the Northern Pacific in an unfair trade practices dispute with William Wylie, operator of several tent camps in Yellowstone. Thwarted in his attempt to drive Wylie out of business, Child recruited investors to buy out Wylie, while Child remained in the background. The newly acquired company kept the Wylie name and was incorporated as the Wylie Permanent Camping Company. With improvements to services mandated by Child, the camping business expanded rapidly.Barringer, p. 50 Reamer, by now a close family friend, accompanied Harry and Adelaide Child on a European tour in 1909. The next year he designed a new Canyon Hotel for Child, built on a scale far greater than any previous park building. The Canyon Hotel quickly became the premier hotel in the park.Barringer, pp. 47-48 In 1911 Child added the Yellowstone Park Boat Company to his portfolio, offering excursions on Yellowstone Lake.Barringer, p. 48 However, Child gave up a portion of his share of the Wylie Permanent Camping Company to friend and competitor F. Jay Haynes, who operated photography concessions in the park, and who held the Union Pacific Railroad's hotel concession in the park. Until this time the Union Pacific concession was largely theoretical, but with the extension of rail service to West Yellowstone, Montana, the UP and Haynes became a threat to Child's core business. The sale effectively bought Haynes' cooperation as a competitor.Barringer, p. 53 Other ventures In Helena, Montana, Child developed Green Meadow Ranch. Child bought the property in 1887 on behalf of investors that included executives of the Northern Pacific Railroad, selling it at a substantial markup to the St. Paul and Helena Land and Improvement Company. In 1914 Child bought back the property, by then a poultry-raising venture,Barringer, p. 53 and brought in Reamer to design an enormous Swiss Chalet-style house, barn, blacksmith shop and granary complex. The house burned in 1924, and the barn in 1956. The granary and blacksmith shop remain, and are the object of preservation efforts. Child also developed Oro Fino Terrace, a complex of six three-story units under one roof at 802-812 North Benton Avenue, designed by Saint Paul architect Ralph Edgerton. Built in 1887, Oro Fino Terrace burned in 1985. In 1913 Child and partner Charles Anceney established the Flying D Ranch, covering in Madison and Galltin counties. By 1920 the ranch comprised and leased another . Automobile tourism Yellowstone Park Transportation Company warehouse in Gardiner, Montana Yellowstone Park White bus Automobiles remained banned in Yellowstone long after they were admitted in other national parks, due to the influence of Child and the Northern Pacific.Barringer, p. 62 In 1916, as part of an effort to exert Park Service control over concessioners, Park Service director Stephen Mather dictated a settlement between Yellowstone concessioners that sold all of Haynes' interests apart from his photography business to Child, while Child gave up his interest in the Wylie camping operation to a new organization, in return for the park's motorized transportation concession.Barringer, p. 65Haines, pp. 364-365 As a result of this deal, Child became the beneficiary of three railroads: the Northern Pacific, the Union Pacific, and the Burlington. Child used the railroads' resources to borrow money for a fleet of custom-built White Motor Company touring buses and touring cars. Child closed the Fountain Hotel, which was no longer needed as a relay point.Barringer, p. 67 Child suffered bouts of ill health beginning in 1916, the result of diabetes and other problems. Mather and assistant Horace Albright were concerned about the future of the Yellowstone concessions should Child die, since his Child's son Huntley so angered Mather in 1916 that he was no longer permitted to conduct business with the Park Service.Barringer, pp. 70-71 Child suffered financial difficulties in 1917 as a result of the decline in tourism that accompanied the United States' entry into World War I, but emerged healthy enough to consider re-absorbing the Wylie camping concession when it became available in 1918, which had suffered more heavily in the downturn.Barringer, p. 69 However, former Wylie employee Howard Hays arranged to purchase the concession with Park Service approval, renaming it the Yellowstone Park Camp Company in 1919. But by 1924, with Hays in ill health, Child bought the Yellowstone Park Camps Company, renaming it the Yellowstone Park Lodge and Camps Company, effectively cementing a monopoly of the major Yellowstone concessions.Barringer, pp. 72-74 Marriage and descendants The Executive House at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park, home of the Child family when in Yellowstone Harry Child married Adelaide Dean in 1883. Their children included Huntley Child, who managed the Yellowstone Park Hotel Company during his father's illness in 1916, angering Stephen Mather, which resulted in his expulsion from the company by his father. Daughter Ellen Child Nichols married William Nichols, who started as secretary to his father- in-law in 1907 and became president of the Yellowstone Park Company at Child's death in 1931. Ellen became chairman of the company in 1963 and was treasurer in 1965, selling the Yellowstone Park Company to Goldfield Enterprises in 1966. Child died in 1931 at his winter home in La Jolla, California. References Sources *Barringer, Mark Daniel.

Legislature of the state of Maine Also known as \\"Our Lady of Victories\\", it is a bronze statue mounted on a granite base, depicting a female figure, clad in armor covered by flowing robes, with a furled flag in one hand and a mace and shield in the other. The figure is an allegorical representation of Victory. On two sides of the base stand bronze groups of three figures, one depicting soldiers, and the other sailors. The sculpture was created by Maine sculptor Franklin Simmons and the base was designed by New York City architect Richard Morris Hunt. The site's original landscaping, now substantially altered, was by Portland architect Francis H. Fassett. Its creation was made possible by fundraising activities of the local Grand Army of the Republic lodge. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 1, 1998. 1825 city hall 1825 city hall in 1886, demolished 1888 for the Soldiers and Sailors Monument Before it incorporated as a city in 1832, the Town of Portland built its first town hall in 1825. Over the building's sixty-three years it was also known as Market Hall and Military Hall. The original simple gable structure was modified in 1833 by Charles Quincy Clapp, who had the cupola removed from the roof and a portico added to the front, updating the building to the Greek Revival style. In 1827, the upper floor housed the second public gymnasium in the US, founded by eccentric and influential writer, critic, and activist John Neal. The gym was based on Turnen gymnastics that Neal learned in London from German refugee Carl Voelker. The first floor in the building's early years housed stalls used by farmers to sell agricultural products. The building was the site of the Portland Rum Riot in 1855, involving Mayor Neal Dow and resulting in one death. It was replaced by a new city hall in 1862 on Congress Street at the head of Exchange Street. The old city hall was demolished in 1888 and replaced by the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, at which time Market Square was renamed Monument Square.

It is a Grade I listed building. History Sir Cloudesley Shovell The first guildhall in Rochester was located further south along the High Street on a site where the Clock House is now situated. The current building, the second guildhall, was constructed in 1697. The design for the main frontage involved four bays: the ground floor was left open, apart from some paired Tuscan order columns, to allow markets to be held; the first floor was designed with four windows with white plaques in the middle commemorating the completion of the building in 1697 and also the financial contribution made by Sir Stafford Fairborne. At roof level a large round-headed pediment was erected above which was a bell-turret was placed. A weather vane in the form of an 18th-century warship was added in 1780. Wings were added on the right in 1838 and on the left in 1893. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber: both the council chamber and the staircase have magnificent plaster ceilings, which were given in 1695 by Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell, who was the Member of Parliament for the City of Rochester at the time. The council chamber featured in the novel Great Expectations by Charles Dickens published in 1861. For much of the 20th century, the council chamber was the meeting place of the City of Rochester but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Borough of Medway was formed in 1974.

Stephen E. Rubin, Ph.D, of Westport, Connecticut, originally designed the hierarchy of mathematical objectives for Center School in New Canaan, Connecticut. Grand Haven Area Public Schools adapted the hierarchy and contracted Tom Orzechowski, systems engineer, to develop a networked DOS version of the management software in the summer of 1992. Kirby Chittenden provided design consultation for the graphical user interface and the software functionality. Additional design support was provided by Melinda Brink, principal of Peach Plains Elementary School, and the school's math coordinator, Jean Sharp. Implemented at Peach Plains Elementary School in Grand Haven, Michigan, in the fall of 1992, instructional groups called terminals are composed of students who have mastered the critical prerequisites of some 250 objectives within 28 areas of mathematical knowledge. Individual learner mastery of the non-linear hierarchy of mathematical objectives is carefully monitored by teachers and curriculum management software allowing all students to advance through the same curriculum, albeit at different times.Chittenden, K.L. (1993) Outome based mathematics: A case study in change. Education 695 final project. Grand Valley State University.  Design  A Section of the Mathematics Hierarchy CPM was designed around the developmental philosophy that learning is more a function of time rather than ability.Rubin, S.E. (1990) Public schools should learn to ski: A design for educating in the 21st century. International Journal of Educational Management, 4 (4), 5-17. Within this design, elementary students leave their homerooms each afternoon to participate in a multi-age instructional group called a terminal. Students flow in and out of these terminals as they are able to demonstrate mastery. These instructional groups are organized according to two criteria: # Everyone in a terminal shares a common need to learn the same thing, with the group formed around a specific skill, objective, or outcome; and # Everyone in a terminal has already mastered the objectives that are prerequisite to learning this new objective. Classes in various mathematical strands such subtraction (S), decimals (L), statistic and probability (SP) are open and closed as student eligibility increases or decreases respectively. This fluency allows for all students to move through the hierarchy at developmentally appropriate times.Rubin, S.E. (1993). Resource-based education: It’s like inviting kids to a buffet instead of a sit-down dinner. The New England League of Middle Schools Journal, 6 (1), 8-13.  Delivery  Teachers often provide a focused whole group instruction based upon one of some 250 objectives available to students. In addition, students may participate in independent or small group activities using classroom manipulatives, learning center activities, cooperative learning groups, peer tutoring, and computer courseware. Instructors have full latitude to decide what will be used in the way of resources to bring each student to the point of mastery. Not all students achieve success on the same day and in the same way. Level of mastery, rather than rate, is emphasized. A criterion referenced test allows the student to demonstrate mastery of the terminal objective. The management software then assigns the student to an open eligible class the next day. The software also determines which classes need to open and close based upon student eligibility.  Technology  CPM Management Software Locale Feature Early management software, designed to operate on the Apple II platform, did not take full advantage of developments in relational database management. In addition, advancements in object- oriented program language allowed access to information from various sources in a substantially more graphic form. The new management software developed by Tom Orzechowski integrated eight independent databases with the object- oriented characteristics of Borland's Paradox (database) software development engine.Orzechowski, T. (1993) Outcome based curriculum management system. [Computer program]. Grand Rapids, MI: Author. An integral part of Orzechowski's development process is that of a student's Locale, or their whereabouts in the hierarchy of mathematical objectives. The Locale (see diagram) provided data about each child's skill set and functioned as a decision making tool and gateway for enrolling students in appropriate classes each day.

Development In December 2010, it was announced that Phillips had joined the cast of Hollyoaks as Liberty Savage. Phillips came to the attention of Hollyoaks producers after submitting her song \\"Missing You\\" to be used on the show. The song was used in established character Steph Cunningham's (Carley Stenson) final episode, in which she died in a fire. Phillips penned the song after being inspired by Steph's cervical cancer storyline. Following a strong response to the song, producers invited Phillips to audition for the role of Liberty, a character they had been developing for \\"some time\\" and she was successful. Liberty made her first appearance on 10 December 2010. Channel Four described Liberty as being \\"beautiful, bubbly but very spoilt\\". Matalan described her as 'much wronged' and the Daily Star described her as 'feisty'. When the Hollyoaks titles were updated, Liberty was included along with Ethan, Will and Dodger. The producers took advantage of Phillips singing skills, and got her to sing of Adele's 'Make You Feel My Love' (originally written and recorded by Bob Dylan). Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy called it a 'show stopping performance'. On 18 June 2011 it was revealed that Liberty was to perform on stage at T4 On The Beach taking Theresa and Ethan with her. It was then said that Philips will become the first person to perform as two people, as while Liberty gets her big break, Phillips will also perform her own solo material. Speaking of this Philips said, I'm so excited to perform at T4 On The Beach. It will be my biggest audience to date so it's a little scary but I just can't wait to get out there and perform. I hope the fans like the episode of Hollyoaks too. I love the idea of dropping in my scenes from T4OTB in episodes just two days later. It's going to be tight but it's all very exciting!\\" The episode aired on 14 July 2011. Notable Relationships Ethan Scott and Theresa McQueen Before she entered Hollyoaks, it was revealed that Liberty was engaged to fellow newcomer Ethan Scott (Craig Vye). Vye said \\"It's quite a casual relationship to begin with - she thinks about it more seriously than [he does]. She thinks that [they're] engaged.\\" A love triangle between Liberty, Ethan and Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) is formed. Liberty becomes friends with Theresa, but Theresa meets Ethan and a mutual attraction between them grows. In April 2011, Liberty and Ethan have their engagement party. Vye told soap opera reporting magazine Soaplife that Ethan is in love with Liberty, but does not love her enough to marry her. \\"There is a point where [Theresa and Ethan] share a moment and realise something could happen between them.\\" Vye teased the love triangle saying, \\"Liberty has been quite needy with the whole wedding thing, but Ethan sees her in a different light when she gets all standoffish with him,\\" Vye told Soaplife of the storyline. \\"He sees her sing at Chez Chez and it's clear he's still smitten.\\" he confirmed that him and Liberty were going to get back together saying, \\"He's fallen for Theresa yet part of him still loves Liberty,\\" he said. \\"They share a kiss and it looks like they're secretly back on.\\" Vye finished saying that Ethan's actions could end badly. Ethan got his comeuppance on 22 July 2011. An insider said, “Playing around with three bolshie blondes isn’t the smartest thing he could have done.“It’s going to be interesting to see what happens next.” Family In March 2011, media entertainment website Digital Spy reported that Liberty's brothers, Will (James Atherton) and Dodger (Danny Mac) and father Dirk (David Kennedy), would be introduced. The website said the family would cause chaos following their arrival. Of the family, a Hollyoaks statement said: \\"The new family will take the village by storm and are set to rub all the McQueens up the wrong way. The Savage family get evicted from their home when Dirk can't keep up with the payments. Liberty is furious to come home and find her house all boarded up but big brother Dodger has a new house for them to live in! While the McQueens are away on holiday, Dodger moves his family into the empty house and declares squatters' rights! How will the McQueens react to their new housemates?\\" It was later revealed Joe Tracini had been cast as Liberty's cousin Dennis. Talking about Dennis's relationship with Liberty, Tracini talked to Digital Spy in an interview saying, \\"Liberty loves him. Liberty tends to just go through life and accept things, so she's a big fan of Dennis's, which is nice. Departure On 13 July 2013, executive producer Bryan Kirkwood announced that Liberty would be written out of Hollyoaks. He explained that following her on-screen absence she will make a \\"brief return\\". Liberty secures a record deal and Dennis and Leanne hold a surprise leaving party for her. All of Liberty's family attend, and Liberty later leaves for Los Angeles to follow her dream of becoming a singer. Reintroduction On 22 May 2018, it was announced that Liberty would be reintroduced with the role being recast to Jessamy Stoddart. A spokesperson for Hollyoaks confirmed the recasting: \\"Liberty later left Hollyoaks to pursue a music career in LA after landing a record deal, but the reality of the LA dream turned out to be a little less shiny than she had anticipated and it's time to return home. She has missed her family and is excited to make up for lost time with Dirk and get to know her extended family better. Just like she did when she was younger, she will be the glue that holds the family together.\\" Stoddart's debut scenes as Liberty aired on 5 June 2018. Reception Porter (Theresa) praised both the characters of Ethan and Liberty for being introduced saying,\\"Yeah, it's been really good. When new people start, you remember what it was like for you when you first joined the show and all of the new things you experienced. You feel for them as well, because they've come into a big crowd of people and they don't know anyone's name. Craig and Abi have been fun to work with.\\".

He was afterward known to recite the jingle > To grow crops to sell is to speculate like hell, but to grow crops to eat > keeps you standing on both feet. In his new home he established a newspaper, The Los Angeles Daily Fruit World, and in 1900 began a \\"magazine-type newspaper\\" called The Western Empire, which he used as an instrument to sell agricultural land. Hartranft's first real estate development was in 1892, in Glendale and Montrose, California.

He called this effort the \\"Fourth Home Extension Colony.\\"History, City of Wasco Bolton Hall in Tujunga In 1907 he helped establish the \\"Little Landers\\" colony of Tujunga, which was based on the principle that everything a family could need might be gained through farming the property that they owned and that \\"land had value only if people lived on it.\\" He donated a parcel of land for the construction of Bolton Hall, which was used as a community center, a city hall and, finally, a historical museum. In 1910 Hartranft began the first \\"auto stage,\\" or motorbus, route from Tujunga to Los Angeles in a \\"two-cylinder Buick pick-up truck with no top and seats along the sides.\\" In 1939 he claimed his service gave Tujunga the distinction of being the first town in the United States to have used bus transportation. That was when he was an honored guest as a new bus line began operating between Tujunga and North Hollywood. A Los Angeles Times reporter described Hartranft as \\"the 'Socrates' of the green Verdugo Hills\\" when the land developer made the principal speech at the April 1923 dedication of a cross atop the peak of newly named Mount McGroarty, in honor of California's recently deceased poet laureate, John Steven McGroarty. Hartranft was an unsuccessful candidate in California's 11th Congressional District in November 1932 on the Liberty Party ticket. He came in third after the Republican and Democratic candidates but garnered 13.9 percent of the vote.JoinCalifornia.com In 1939 Hartranft published a book, Grapes of Gladness, as a counterpoint to John Steinbeck's disturbing work, The Grapes of Wrath. In it, Hartranft spoke of the \\"communistic implications\\" of Steinbeck's \\"notoriously inaccurate\\" novel Robert E. Morsberger, Steinbeck and Censorship, California State University at Pomona and argued that \\"California still has room for all who can feed themselves from our endless-chain gardens, instead of from the State Treasury.\\" A Los Angeles Times reviewer said the book described how > the Digger Indians could live on native plants and roots.

It was affiliated with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and served students of McHenry County, Illinois. The school opened in 2004 and closed in 2019. The school's colors were black and red and its mascot was the Saints. History FLHS was founded in August 2004 with a freshman class of eight students. The first class of ten students graduated in 2008. The school was initially located at St. John's Lutheran Church in Union, Illinois. In January 2006, it moved to the unused Hawthorn school building north of Marengo, Illinois. In 2009, the school again moved to Crystal Lake, Illinois, which provided a more central location. In September 2013, FLHS purchased the building it was leasing from Immanuel Church with the expectation to handle its growth for 7-10 years. In a July 2018 letter to students and parents, Faith Lutheran Board Chair Steven K. Wright said that the school would be closing for the upcoming academic year due to declining enrollment and increasing debt. A fundraising campaign allowed FLHS to remain open for the 2018-2019 school year. However, the school closed permanently after the end of that school year. Academics The school had a low student-teacher ratio and touted its high ACT average, which generally averaged between 25 and 26. In 2014, the senior class averaged 27.1 and averaged over $70,000 each in scholarship offers. The school offered classes in theology, science, art, mathematics, physical education, English, social studies, practical skills, and the languages of Spanish, Latin. AP classes and a dual credit programs through McHenry County College and Grand Canyon University were offered. School life Student body The school worked with international programs to host exchange students from Brazil, Paraguay, China, Panama, Thailand, Germany, France, and South Korea. Approximately 5–8 percent of the students were international. Athletics FLHS was a member of the Northeastern Athletic Conference (NAC) and participated in a co-op with Alden Hebron High School in which FLHS students playe on Hebron's football, baseball, and softball teams. Alden Hebron Students could also participate on Faith's golf and boys' volleyball teams. FLHS fall sports included boys' golf, girls' volleyball, and co-ed cross country. Winter sports were boys' basketball and girls' cheerleading. The Faith Saints also competed in co-ed track and field and boys' volleyball during the spring season. Student organizations Student Council was a student government that organized extracurricular programs as well as running fundraisers to help with the school's annual trip to Wisconsin Dells for its Jr/Sr Prom. Hands and Feet for Christ (HFC) was a group dedicated to community service. Illinois YMCA Youth and Government allowed students to travel to the Illinois State Capitol where students acted as delegates to pass mock legislation. A chapter of the National FFA Organization was started on the campus in 2015. The school published a newspaper and yearbook and had several a number of other campus organizations including drama, band, choir, Book Club, and Spanish Club.

He was signed by the 49ers as an undrafted free agent in 2011. He played college football at Notre Dame. Early years Williams grew up in Altamonte Springs, Florida, and attended Lyman High School, where he played football for coach Bill Caughell. In his junior year, Ian was responsible for 83 tackles, 23 tackles for loss (TFL), 12 hurries, 4 forced fumbles, 2 sacks, 4 fumble recoveries and 4 passes broken up, as the Greyhounds won their third straight 5A district title and beat Melbourne High School for Lyman’s first Florida playoff win in school history. Williams continued his dominance from the defensive tackle position in 2006, recording over 40 tackles, 18 TFL, and 12 sacks. He was recognized as the 120th rated prep player nationally on ESPN 150's listing and 30th on the South Florida Sun-Sentinel list of top 50 Florida prospects. Williams was heavily recruited, receiving scholarship offers from Notre Dame as well as most of the top southern programs in the country, including the Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Florida, Mississippi, and South Carolina. Before her death in 1995, Ian's maternal grandmother, Lily May Green, had told Ian's mother Natalie Williams that her grandson would one day play for the University of Notre Dame. Not wanting to influence his decision, Natalie waited until after Ian signed with Notre Dame to tell her son of his grandmother's prescient forecast. College career Freshman year Recruited to play nose tackle in then-defensive coordinator Corwin Brown's 3–4 system, Williams played in all 12 games his freshman year, starting two. He totaled 45 tackles, 19 solo stops, 1.5 TFL on the year and was named a Freshman All-American. His 45 tackles were the third most for any freshman defensive lineman in Notre Dame history. He ranked sixth on the team in tackles and was the only player ranked in the top 12 in tackles on the team who did not start at least four games. Sophomore year Williams appeared in all 13 games for the Irish, making 7 starts. He had 40 total tackles including 2 TFL, in addition to a pass break up. Williams anchored the defense against Pittsburgh amassing 6 tackles and 2 TFL. He recorded 7 tackles against Navy, 8 against Syracuse, and 3 tackles and a pass break up against the USC Trojans. Junior year The Irish made a switch to the 4-3 defense under Jon Tenuta. Williams shifted from a 3–4 nose tackle to a 4–3 defensive tackle. Williams played in all 12 games, starting 8. He recorded 39 tackles, 6 TFL, a pass breakup and his first career interception. Senior year New Irish defensive coordinator, Bob Diaco, switched the defense back to a 3–4 scheme. Williams thrived in a return to his natural position at nose tackle, anchoring the middle of the Irish defensive front and recording 37 tackles, 2 sacks and an interception in 7.5 games. Williams suffered an MCL sprain against Navy on October 23, 2010. The injury did not require surgery, but it did force Williams to miss the last four games of his senior season. Prior to the injury, he was one of only two players to appear in every game of his four-year Notre Dame career (Kerry Neal is the other). Williams returned to practice in early December healthy enough to play for Notre Dame in the Hyundai Sun Bowl against the University of Miami Hurricanes on December 31, 2010. Professional career San Francisco 49ers Williams was signed by the San Francisco 49ers as an undrafted free agent following the 2011 NFL Draft on July 25, 2011. On March 11, 2013, Williams signed a two-year contract extension with the 49ers. On September 15, 2013, Williams broke his left ankle in a game against the Seattle Seahawks and was subsequently placed on injured reserve, effectively ending his season. On September 9, 2015, Williams was named a defensive team captain by head coach Jim Tomsula. Williams originally signed a five-year $27.5 million contract with the 49ers on March 9, 2016. However, on March 21, 2016, the deal was reduced to one–year, $3 million after Williams failed his physical following ankle surgery. On October 27, 2016, Williams was released with an injury settlement.

Nationalore was racing's richest maiden (non-winning horse), with earnings of $318,227. Nationalore was by Video Ranger (fourth in the 1990 Kentucky Derby) out of Romantic Jet. He was trained and bred by his owner, Myung Kwon Cho. As a two year old, he ran ten races, finishing second twice. That year, his fourth race in 34 days, and his most lucrative result, was third place in the Grade I Breeders' Cup Juvenile, which earned him $120,000. As a three year old, he was entered into the Kentucky Derby with career earnings of $283,767 from 15 races. Although Nationalore had won no races when he entered the Derby, he had earned more money than seven other starters in the race. Before the race, his assistant trainer, Rafael Martinez, said that Nationalore was better suited to distances longer than those in the races he had been running, and the Derby, being a quarter-mile longer, would suit him better. Nationalore went on to finish ninth from a field of 15 runners. Nationalore was five years old when he was euthanized on 12 July 2000 after falling in a race at Hollywood Park and fracturing his shoulder. His final race was his 26th start.

Bernard Jackson (November 4, 1927 – July 16, 1996) was an American playwright who founded the Inner City Cultural Center in Los Angeles. Inner City was one of the first arts institutions in the United States to promote multiculturalism. The facility nurtured the careers of numerous performers including Beah Richards, George Takei, Edward James Olmos, Nobu McCarthy and Forest Whitaker. Biography Background Clarence Bernard Jackson was the only child of Clarence I. and Ruth R. (Brown) Jackson, who were both originally from Dinwiddie County, Virginia. His father was employed as a doorman at an apartment building. The younger Jackson grew up in the Bedford- Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, New York, where he was involved in one of the city's toughest street gangs. Because he was able to speak Spanish, Jackson often served in a diplomatic capacity. When he enrolled in the High School of Music and Art, Jackson was able to escape the negative influences of his neighborhood and obtain a broader view of the world. He subsequently attended Brooklyn College and pursued a master's degree in music at UCLA. Career In 1959, he co-wrote (with James Hatch), the book and music for Fly Blackbird, a musical dealing with civil rights. The production featuring a multi-ethnic cast was very popular with Los Angeles audiences, if not with critics. Fly Blackbird opened off-Broadway in 1961 and received an Obie Award for Best Musical the following year. In the wake of the Watts Riots, he founded the Inner City Cultural Center in Central Los Angeles. Unlike other arts organizations that catered to one ethnic group or another, Inner City was operated under the concept of multiculturalism and provided assistance to a wide variety of cultural institutions. This included Luis Valdez's El Teatro Campesino, the East West Players and the Bilingual Foundation for the Arts, founded by Carmen Zapata. Inner City's multi-cultural approach did not come without criticism from the black artistic community and the mainstream press, despite the fact that Inner City was also the largest producer of black theatre in Los Angeles. Jackson was also a proponent of non-traditional casting. For example, in 1975, Inner City produced Maggie The Mouse Meets The Dirty Rat Fink, a Christmas musical that was written by Jackson. In the production, a black man and woman were cast as the parents of a Japanese daughter and a Chicano son. The following year, Jackson staged, Langston Hughes Said, a musical tribute to the Harlem Renaissance writer. The production included Hughes's one-act play, Soul Gone Home and featured a Chinese mother with her son played simultaneously by two actors, one black and the other Chicano. Throughout his thirty years as executive director of the Inner City Cultural Center, Jackson nurtured numerous artists at various stages in their careers. He died on July 16, 1996. In the wake of his death, playwright George C. Wolfe recalled how Jackson encouraged him to stage one of his early projects, \\"Tribal Rites, or The Coming of the Great God-bird Nabuku to the Age of Horace Lee Lizer.\\" \\"Though I've been involved in many projects since,\\" Wolfe said, \\"this production was perhaps the most crucial to my evolution\\" as an artist.

In his racing career, he ran in both Europe and North America, winning six races, most notably the Arlington Million as a five-year-old in 2000. Following his retirement, he showed promise as a stallion before dying at the age of eight. Background Chester House was a dark bay horse bred by his owner, Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms breeding operation. He was sired by Mr. Prospector and out of the El Gran Senor mare Toussaud and was his dam's first foal. Toussaud later produced Belmont Stakes winner Empire Maker. Chester House was sent to be trained in England by Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Race career Chester House started his record in England with a win in his first outing. He then won the class B Rosehill Stakes at Doncaster, the Listed Steventon Stakes at Newbury and the Listed Huxley Stakes at Chester. He recorded his first group race win in the Group Three Brigadier Gerard Stakes by five lengths. After about three showings in four more group races in England, his connections entered him in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic. Before the race, he was relocated to the United States to be trained by Robert Frankel. Chester House had no previous experience on dirt, stumbled at the start and was last for almost half of the race. He then made steady progress to finish fourth, less than three lengths behind the winner, Cat Thief. After the Classic, he remained in the United States to compete in turf races. After losing his first six starts, he won the Grade 1 Arlington Million by three lengths with Jerry Bailey riding. His connections then retired him and sent him to stud at the U.S. division of Juddmonte Farms. Stud career Chester House showed promise as a sire of winners in a brief stud career. Most notable of his offspring in North America is the champion mare Ventura, who won the 2008 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint and the 2009 Woodbine Mile against colts along with several other Grade 1 wins. Ventura earned over $2 million. Chester House had a second Breeders’ Cup winner in the colt Muhannak, who won the 2008 Breeders’ Cup Marathon and was a Grade 3 winner in Ireland. Chester House's other winners included grade 1 winner Divine Park; the multiple grade 2 winner Spring House (who raced for 5 seasons); grade 2 winner Warning Zone; and grade 3 winner Stonehouse, along with many more minor stakes winners. The best of his European runners was Phoenix Tower Standing at $25,000 for a guaranteed live foal, Chester House offered the Mr. Prospector blood line at a much lower price than similar stallions like Kingmambo or Fusaichi Pegasus. Death In May 2003, Chester House’s handlers noticed that he wasn’t doing well. A vet visit showed he was anaemic and had contracted pneumonia. Further test showed these were secondary sicknesses as he had developed a type of cancer called Myelodysplastic Syndrome. Chemotherapy began at once in order to save his life, but the illness progressed so rapidly that Juddmonte Farms managers decided to euthanise the horse on June 28, 2003.http://www.juddmonte.com/news/2003/ChesterHouse.aspx Juddmonte.com/News References 1995 racehorse births 2003 racehorse deaths Racehorses bred in Kentucky Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Racehorses trained in the United States Thoroughbred family 6-d ","title":"Chester House"},{"id":"30003751","text":"Toussaud (May 6, 1989 – January 5, 2009) was a bay mare bred and raced by Juddmonte Farms. Sired by El Gran Senor out of an In Reality mare, Image of Reality, Toussaud achieved much on the track and in the breeding shed.  Race career  Toussaud raced in both Europe and the US, excelling on grass surfaces. At three she won against males in the Van Geest Criterion Stakes (Gr.3) in England and placed in both the Calor Silver Trophy and Fed Brew Lager Beeswing Stakes. At four, she was shipped across the pond and again won against the colts in the American Handicap (Gr.2). She then won the Gr.1 Gamely Breeders’ Cup Handicap (now just the Gamely Stakes). She also added the Wilshire Handicap (Gr.2) and the Autumn Days Handicap to her list of victories.Toussaud Pedigree  Legacy  Toussaud was the dam of five graded stakes winners, including champion sires and Grade 1 winners Chester House and Empire Maker. All of her graded winners where sired by different stallions. The only stallion she ever re-visited was A. P. Indy, and neither of the two resulting foals ever raced. Honest Lady, Toussaud’s second foal and third highest earner, was a grade 1 stakes winner and became the dam of a Grade 1 stakes winner, First Defence. Two more of Toussaud's get are Chiselling (Secretariat Stakes (Gr.1) winner) and Decarchy, who won the Gr.2 Frank E. Kilroe Mile Handicap. Decarchy had a modest stud career. Chiselling was to be sent to South Africa to stand stud duty for Andreas Jacobs and the Scott Brothers, but before the flight on July 30, he was diagnosed with the neurological disease Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis. Press releases stated that he would remain in Kentucky to receive treatment and would be shipped out at a later date to start preparing for his 2005 stud season. However, he seems to have never made it South Africa and has no reported offspring. Toussaud produced some non-champions as well, including her A. P. Indy fillies named Mesmeric and Gateway. Both fillies were retained by Juddmonte Farms and are in its broodmare band. Another of Toussaud's daughters a filly by Kingmambo, Tinge, also never set foot on the race track. Civilisation (by Gone West) is Toussaud's only foal to race but never win. Tolerance (by Seeking the Gold) won once in three starts before returning to Juddmonte Farms to become a broodmare like her other sisters.Toussaud's Offspring  Death  Although Toussaud met with much success in the breeding shed, she was often ill and became too physically fragile to rear her own foals.Toussaud Named Broodmare of Year In 1995, she developed laminitis after producing her first foal, Chester House, and five years later she underwent colic surgery to fix an impaction. Her propensity for illness seems to be another trait she passed on to her offspring, as both Chester House and Chiselling where struck with debilitating diseases, though neither sickness was genetically inherited. Toussaud was pensioned in late December 2007 due to her worsening laminitis.Toussaud Pensioned Toussaud was euthanized in 2009 at the age of 20 due to declining health and complications from laminitis. “Mentally, she was as content and as happy of a mare as there was,” Juddmonte manager Garrett O’Rourke said. “Physically, she just started to wear down. She was 20 years of age, but she probably lived a few extra years [with the physical issues]. It gets to be a time when their physiques just can’t stand up to it.” “She endured a lot in her life and just kept on pulling it out. To have health problems and still become a Broodmare of the Year, it’s quite amazing. To be around her, she always reminded me of one of those people that we all know in life that has misfortune and never complains. To me, that’s the most admirable type of person, and that’s exactly how she was. She was always the same Toussaud, every single morning, happy to see you.”Toussaud Dies References 1989 racehorse births 2009 racehorse deaths American racehorses Racehorses bred in Kentucky Kentucky Broodmare of the Year Thoroughbred family 6-d ","title":"Toussaud"},{"id":"30003775","title":"1982 Washington State Cougars football team"},{"id":"30003777","text":"House of the Wolf (Bayt al-Deeb, ) is Ezzat el Kamhawi's fourth novel and eighth book.

Often there is sufficient systemic evidence to help the physician decide between any one of the aforementioned possible systemic diseases. For those patients who present with only vasculitis of the retinal vessels, great investigative effort (Chest X-ray, blood test, urinary analysis, vascular biopsy, ophthalmology assessment, etc.) should be undertaken to ensure that a systemic disease is not the hidden culprit.

Although delivered in 1976 both ships only entered real service in 1993, after their sale to Bonny Gas Transport Bermuda Shell, a subsidiary of Nigeria LNG Limited. Under their original names (Gastor and Nestor), the ships never transported any cargo.Helderline website on LNG Lagos, visited 10 December 2010Short history on Gastor and Nestor om Bluefunnel website History When first built in 1976–1977, the ships were sister ships owned by different companies: the Dutch Nedlloyd and US based Ocean. They were built at the Chantier d'Atlantique shipyard of St. Nazaire, France. After completion they did not go into service for nearly two decades and were both laid-up for years in the Scottish Loch Striven as there was insufficient work for them to cause their owners to place them into operation into the LNG transport market. A few years after completion it was discovered that there was a construction error in the insulation of the huge gas-tanks. These LNG carriers store their cargo at near atmospheric pressure and this requires that the gas is cooled down to the boiling temperature of LNG: . The cargo is at this temperature when loaded and then the temperature is maintained at this level using insulated tanks and, over time, some of the gas vaporizes which keeps the cargo cool despite the (intentionally low) incoming heat flux from the surrounding environment in the ship and the ocean. Both ships returned to the shipyard for repairs and then returned to storage in Loch Striven as there was still no work for them. The tonnage of the ships is 68,122 The building costs of each ship was €60 million; they were sold in 1991 for approximately €15 million each and came in service around 1993. At the time these ships were the largest ships ever built at the Chantier d'Atlantique shipyard and a special large drydock was built for this project. After the completion of several large tankers in the 1970s this drydock was not used again until the yard was commissioned to build the new ocean liner by Cunard.Documentary on Discovery Knowledge Building of the Queen Mary 2 on YouTube. Gastor Gastor was built for the Dutch company Nederlandse Scheepvaart Unie, part of the shipping-company Nedlloyd. (Later Nedlloyd and P&O; joined forces and formed P&O; Nedlloyd specializing in container shipping until this company was sold to A. P. Moller-Maersk Group or Maersk for short). The construction-number for the yard was 26 and the (current) IMO number is 7360124 The ship was built to transport LNG from the newly discovered gas-fields in Algeria to the West-European markets via the Dutch port of Delfzijl. Due to economic development at the time and the after effects of the 1973 oil crisis this project never materialized and after completion the ship was laid up in Loch Striven. LNG Lagos In 1993 Gastor was sold and renamed LNG Lagos and finally entered service under the new owner Bonny Gas Transport - Shell Bermuda. The ship carries cargo for that company to and from Nigeria. Before entering service the -now- LNG Lagos was fitted with a new bridge system by Litton Marine services (part of Sperry Marine Northrop Grumman) at the Sobrena shipyard in Brest (now Damen Shipyard). The last registered position of the ship was registered in 2015 in the Java Sea and since then no further AIS positions were registered.myshiptracking ais data, august 2019 Since 2016 new LNGtankers with names LNG Port Harcourt 2 and LNG Lagos 2 have been built.

This ship was built to transport gas from Indonesia to the United States but suffered the same fate as Gastor being laid-up in Loch Striven between 1976–1993, except for a quick return to the shipyard in the mid 1980s when a construction/design error was being repaired: the isolation of the main gas tanks was not built according to the design and requirements and the shipyard had to repair that.

Life Joan Franks Williams was born in Brooklyn, on April 1, 1930 to her father, Harold Franks, and her mother. Both of her parents enjoyed classical music, leading Williams to absorb the world of classical music through piano and viola lessons and frequent attendance to live concerts and performances. She attended the Highschool of Music and the Arts in Manhattan and continued with music into her college studies. Williams earned a bachelor's in Music Education from the Eastman School of Music in 1952, and a Bachelor's and master's degrees from the Manhattan School of Music 1961. While still in New York, she met her future husband Irving Williams on a blind date in Manhattan; suitingly, they enjoyed a live symphonic performance followed by dinner. Joann married Irving in 1954, and moved to Seattle with her family in 1962. In Seattle, she founded New Dimensions in Music (NDM), a non-profit organization that was one of the early and most influential promoters of new music in the Pacific Northwest. As a part of NDM she also established the first electronic music studio in Seattle. In 1971, the Williams family moved to Tel Aviv in Israel. Williams continued the NDM live concert series of contemporary concert music alongside contemporary radio broadcasting through the Israel Broadcasting Authority, making her responsible for all the contemporary chamber music radio being broadcast within the country. Within the concert series, over 150 pieces by 100 different composers were performed, as well as compositions of her own production. She represented Israel at the ISCM World Music Days in Europe four times, and served on ISCM's international jury. Having created over 30 of her own works, conducting a successful execution of the NDM concert series in Seattle and Israel, and spreading new contemporary musical works throughout Israel through the Israel Broadcasting Authority, Williams returned to Seattle in 1988. Having been diagnosed with Parkinson's, her and her husband enjoyed hiking at the coast, skiing, and being near their grandchildren. On January 30 at the age of 72, Williams died of complications from Parkinson's disease. Joan Franks Williams is survived by her husband, Irving; son David Williams, and two grandchildren, all of Seattle; and father, Harold Franks, of New York City.  Musical Background  With the influence of her parents, Williams took part in frequent visitations to classical performances and concerts within New York. She studied violin and piano as a child and continued her musical studies in the High School for Music and the Arts in Manhattan. Continuing to pursue music in college, she studied music education at the Eastman School of Music, ultimately earning a bachelor's degree in Music Education. Williams also obtained a Bachelor's and master's degree from the Manhattan School of Music, studying under Wayne Barlow, Vittorio Giannini, Ralph Shapey, Stefan Wolpe, Vladimir Ussachevsky, and Roman Haubenstock-Ramati. Upon moving to Seattle, she was responsible for establishing the first electronic music studio within the city and lectured at the New School of Music regarding contemporary composition, writing, and production.  Career  Over the years of her contemporary music career in composition, conducting and organization of contemporary concerts in Seattle and Israel, and broadcasting of contemporary music throughout the entire country of Israel, Williams had created and performed over 30 works of her own, performed around 150 contemporary and classical pieces composed by over 100 composers and has been credited with bringing the contemporary music scene to Seattle and Israel. Within Seattle, upon lecturing at the New School of Music and creating the first electronic music studio within the city, Williams is most renowned for creating and organizing the New Dimensions in Music concert series in Seattle; that she would later continue to organize after her move to Israel in 1971. These concert series featured both classical and contemporary performances in hopes to give audiences the experience to be a part of the contemporary shift in modern-day music composition as well as the promotion of the contemporary genre as well. From the Oxford Press describing one of the many pieces performed at the NDM concert series in 1967: “The first event of the festival was at the same time the last in the season of New Dimensions in Music, the series with which for five years now Joan Franks Williams has made Seattle increasingly aware of the musical present. Outstanding on this occasion was Suderburg's sensitive \\"Entertainments for Violin and Cello,\\" invitingly entitled Chamber Music I. Each movement, notably the second, demonstrated with unusual clarity that music does not have to have a tonic and a dominant to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. This new work held its own with the now classic songs of Webern (Op. 25) and Dallapiccola (1948). Suitable as vehicles for their performers were Wolpe's Form for Piano and Harvey Sollberger's Two Oboes Troping - the oboes are really hocketing. A strange relic, on this program, of the dead days of ready- to-serve electronics was Mario Davidovsky's Electronic Study #3, the staring stereophonic speakers checking off once more the vocabulary of the available equipment. Continuum, performed for the first time, was diverting but too elaborately staged for full appreciation of the music composed by Mrs. Williams.” In addition to the New Dimensions in Music Concert series, Williams also initiated the Israeli Composers Plus One Concert Series during her 17 years abroad. These concert programs included music specifically written to feature audience participation; an element that had influenced her compositional works greatly. Several of her works incorporate acting, improvisation, and staging such as Shimshon Hagibor, a ‘mini comic melodrama written in 1975 (translates to Samson the Hero/the Mighty). Her 1974/1975 piece, Frogs features a recorded tape of frogs croaking in the courtyard of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. Williams enhanced the Israeli avant-garde at the time, not only as a radio producer, but also through her uncommon and slightly humorous interpretation of the avant-garde in her own works. Works She wrote over thirty pieces, around twenty of them while she was in Israel. Her works include mostly chamber music, some of her most famous include: *From Paterson (Text: William Carlos Williams) *Kassandra (1963) *Haiku (chamber, 1969) *Haiku (orchestra, 1972) *Frogs (vocal-chamber, tape, 1974) *Samson the Hero (vocal-chamber, tape 1975) *You too, Brutus! (mezzo solo, 1976) *Rudolph Heinemann in Bonn (trombone, 1978) *Sevenths to Eight (1979) *The Love of Therese du Meun (voice, piano, viola, 1980) *Song of Songs (1983) *Leah (1986) “Credited with bringing contemporary music to Seattle in the 1960s.” Making sure to include her audience members within the concert experience, she produced a performance of a sculptor building a box around audience members. The instruments featured and resembled the hammer's thud as it struck nails and the clank of wooden boards through percussive elements from wind, brass, and percussion instruments. Another composition mixed an orchestra performance with ambient sounds of the city and a bus that transported the musicians. Another, Frogs, premiered on opening night of the Northwest Chamber Orchestra in 1974. A composition in atonal style, it included frogs croaking, sung haikus and instruments.

He serves as president of Consumer Watchdog, a nationally recognized, leftist, nonprofit public interest group. Court helped pioneer the HMO patients' rights movement in the United States. He has also led campaigns to reform insurers, politicians, banks, oil companies, and utilities. The Los Angeles Times dubbed Court \\"a tireless consumer advocate.\\"Nicholas, p3 Court is the author of Corporateering: How Corporate Power Steals Your Personal Freedom and the co-author of Making A Killing: HMOs And The Threat To Your Health. His newest book, The Progressive's Guide to Raising Hell: How To Win Grassroots Campaigns and Get the Change You Voted For was released September 15, 2010. Court is also a regular Los Angeles Times op- ed contributor and a commentator on National Public Radio's Marketplace. Early career and education Originally from Suffern, New York, Court attended Pomona College in Claremont, California and earned a degree in history.Nicholas, p3 Upon graduation in 1989, Court canvassed door-to-door to raise money for the enforcement of insurance reform ballot initiative California Proposition 103, which passed on November 8, 1988.Nicholas, p3 From 1990 to 1994, in the wake of President Clinton's welfare reform plan, Court worked as a homeless advocate and community organizer for an interfaith lobbying group called JERICHO and as the associate director of Harbor Interfaith Shelter.Nicholas, p3 During this period, Court began pioneering the unusual activism tactics he became known for later in life. For example, in an effort to save public assistance programs in Los Angeles County, Court bussed hundreds of homeless people from skid row and signed each of them up for the two-minute public comment, required by law, to talk about their plight and how the city's cuts would affect them. Consumer Watchdog In 1994, Court joined fellow consumer activist and Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield to build Consumer Watchdog then known as the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. Consumer Watchdog named Court president of the organization in 2003. HMO Patients' Rights Court began his career at Consumer Watchdog as the head of Californians for Quality Care, working to reform the HMO system in the state. Here his theatrical style of muckraking matured. For example, during a legislative meeting in Sacramento, Court and his team placed a red herring on the table to signify that the proposed HMO reform was a deliberate attempt to divert attention.Nicholas, p3 He also created a daily \\"HMO casualty of the day,\\" where he faxed patient faces and stories to lawmakers to show how HMOs were hurting citizens of the state. Court's pioneering work for HMO patients' rights made Consumer Watchdog a national voice in the HMO reform debate. In 1996, Court worked with Rosenfield and the California Nurses Association to have a first patients' bill of rights proposition placed on the California ballot. However, Proposition 216 failed to pass garnering only 38.7% of the vote.Los Angeles Business Journal, p1 In 1998, Consumer Watchdog advocated for legislation, ultimately signed into law by California Governor Gray Davis, to extend broad need rights to HMO patients.Los Angeles Business Journal, p1 To bring attention to the issue, Court dumped a truck load of pinto beans at an HMO industry conference to point out Consumer Watchdog's opposition to HMO \\"bean counters\\" overriding doctors' decisions.Benson, p1 Most of the legislative package passed with the help of the California Nurses Association in November 1998.Los Angeles Business Journal, p1 After California had the strongest HMO patient protection laws in America. Many of the provisions of California's bill were included in the national U.S. Patients' Bill of Rights Act, which passed Congress in 2001.Los Angeles Business Journal, p1 Financial Privacy Court fought for financial privacy legislation in 2002. The legislation, which required consumers to opt in before financial services companies shared their personal information with other companies, had public support, but lawmakers wouldn't move it forward. Court wanted to expose how much personal information was for sale on the Internet for a relatively cheap price. To prove his point, Court published the partial social security numbers legislators opposed to financial privacy on his website. As a result of his tactics, and the signature gathering help of e-loan's Chris Larsen, Governor Davis signed the \\"country's toughest financial privacy legislation.\\"Nicholas, p1 Arnold Watch In 2003, Court launched Arnold Watch to expose Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's ties to special interests. Consumer Watchdog also targeted four Schwarzenegger-backed proposition on the ballot in a special election in 2005. Specifically, Proposition 74, which would have lengthened the time it takes for teachers to get tenure, Proposition 75, which would have limited public employee unions' political spending, Proposition 76, which would have limited California's spending and Proposition 77, which would have removed lawmakers ability to redistrict the state. Consumer Watchdog's grassroots efforts lead to the defeat of the propositions and changed Schwarzenegger's governorship. Oil Watchdog In 2005, Court helped create Oil Watchdog, a subgroup of Consumer Watchdog tasked to \\"expose about the profiteering, power, and unscrupulous practices of the oil industry.\\"http://www.oilwatchdog.org/articles/?storyId=3711 He worked to bring attention to Proposition 87, a \\"$4 billion program with goal to reduce petroleum consumption by 25%, with research and production incentives for alternative energy, alternative energy vehicles, energy efficient technologies, and for education and training\\", funded by a \\"tax of 1.5% to 6% (depending on oil price per barrel) on producers of oil extracted in California.\\"Official title and summary The proposition was voted down by the voters, 54.7% opposed to 45.3% in favor. Insurance Reform During 2010, Court and his team fought Proposition 17, a $16 million attempt by Mercury Insurance Group to repeal a key provision of Proposition 103. Consumer Watchdog and its sister organization the Campaign for Consumer Rights \\"argued that the measure would have allowed Mercury and other companies to impose surcharges of as much as $1,000 on drivers who have not had continuous coverage.\\" To raise awareness of the fact that an insurance company was trying to hide its sponsorship of Proposition 17, and its CEO was afraid to debate the merits of the proposal in public, the group sent a man in a chicken suit to legislative hearings on the measure. The group was outspent 12-to-1, but the measure was defeated on June 8, 2010. Inside Google Court works closely with John Simpson on Consumer Watchdog's Inside Google project. Funded by the Rose Foundation, Inside Google's goal is to educate the general public \\"about the need for greater online privacy, and to hold Google accountable for tracking consumers online without explicit permission and for exhibiting its monopolistic power in dangerous ways.\\"http://insidegoogle.com/about/ In 2010, to bring attention to Google's privacy issues, Consumer Watchdog checked networks in California Representative Jane Harman's home to see if her unencrypted Wi-Fi network might have been tapped when the company captured images for the Google Streetview service of Google Maps. Also in 2010, the group created a cartoon video of Google CEO Eric Schmidt as an ice-cream truck driver interested in gathering data about the children on his route. The video aired in Times Square and received media attention. Because of Consumer Watchdog's work, Google allegedly tried to influence the Rose Foundation to halt funding for Inside Google.Kang, p2 Works Making A Killing Published in 1999 by Common Courage Press, Court, with co-author Francis Smith, wrote Making a Killing: HMOs and the Threat to Your Health. The book presents case histories of Americans who have been hurt by the HMO industry. As well, the book suggests ways the HMO system could be more beneficial to consumers. Ralph Nader called the book \\"a gripping story of excessive power without restraint that comes down hard on powerless and defenseless people. Corporateering Corporateering: How Corporate Power Steals Your Personal Freedom…And What You Can Do About It was published by Tarcher Putnam in 2003. The book's premise is that corporations rob consumers of personal freedoms. Court outlines strategies to reverse the damage. The Associated Press called the book \\"A thought-provoking look at the condition of American society.\\" The Progressive's Guide to Raising Hell Court's newest book, The Progressive's Guide to Raising Hell: How to Wage Winning Campaigns, Pass Ballot Box Laws and Get the Change We Vote For was released September 15, 2010 by Chelsea Green Publishing.

Courses and research are meant to support the readiness of civilian and military personnel working with the American armed forces. History Original building for Defense Race Relations Institute. DEOMI was established in 1971 as the Defense Race Relations Institute (DRRI) based on lessons learned from the Civil Rights Movement.DEOMI website. Set against a national policy of inequality and segregation, and problems both in the civilian world and the military linked to racial tension and hostility, military leaders understood that working together across racial lines was not only the right thing to do but also a necessary element in terms of military readiness. Consequently, an inter- service task force was convened to study \\"causes and possible cures of...disorders within the military.\\" Chaired by Air Force Major General Lucius Theus, the task force resulted in Department of Defense Directive 1322.11, establishing the Race Relations Education Board, and led to the 1971 establishment of the DRRI at Patrick AFB, Florida, under the leadership of the first director, Col. Edward F. Krise, USA. In July 1979 the name was changed to the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute, to reflect the growing array of issues included in DEOMI courses, including sexual harassment, sexism, extremism, religious accommodation, and anti-Semitism. More than 20,000 reserve and active duty military members and civilian employees of the American armed forces have graduated from DEOMI since its creation. The history of race relations in the U.S. military has sometimes been described in phases, beginning with Phase I, Executive Order #9981 issued by President Harry S. Truman, integrating the Armed Forces of the United States. Phase II, programs of education, were initiated to deal with the situation of \\"racial unrest.\\" The establishment of the DRRI began this new phase in the history of race relations—and later, diversity training in its many forms.Wayne, George H., \\"Perspectives on Race Relations: Time to Consider Phase III,\\" Air University Review, March-April 1974.

McDonald and his team began to develop a capability for DEOCS that went beyond merely providing a near real-time survey service for Commanders, and began to develop a continuous performance support and improvement system around the assessment capability called the 'Assessment to Solutions' system. The concept is that Commanders and their Equal Opportunity Advisors or Command Climate Specialists need real-time support not only in carrying out the complex task of a complete climate assessment to detect issues before they evolve, but also should be presented with evidence-based solutions to meet their unique diagnosed needs within their organizations. Furthermore, after using it to establish a base line upon assumption of command, follow-up surveys can also assess progress. The survey can be taken on line by military personnel. The Claiborne D.

The southern terminus of State Route 206 is at a T-intersection with State Route 541 approximately east of the unincorporated community of Bladensburg. Its northern terminus is east of the village of Brinkhaven at its junction with U.S. Route 62. Route description State Route 206 passes through the northwestern quadrant of Coshocton County and enters into the southwestern corner of Holmes County. There are no segments of State Route 206 that are included within the National Highway System. History State Route 206 was established in 1924. Its original path followed the current stretch of State Route 229 from Mount Vernon east to its eastern terminus at U.S. Route 36, and U.S. Route 36 for a short distance from State Route 229 to the current western junction of U.S. Route 36 and State Route 206. Two years later, State Route 206 was re-aligned. Now, State Route 206 followed the current State Route 541 from Martinsburg to the current southern terminus of State Route 206, and then the current routing of State Route 206 from that point northerly to the eastern junction of what is now State Route 715 (then known as State Route 42). In 1935, State Route 206 was shortened, as the portion along what is now State Route 541 was re-designated as State Route 271. At this point, the highway now ran from its current southern terminus to the eastern State Route 715 junction, which as of 1935 was designated as U.S. Route 36. Then, in 1937, State Route 206 took on its current shape as it was extended northerly to its current northern terminus at U.S. Route 62 east of Brinkhaven.

Tourist Attractions ;Mabira Forest Reserve Mabira forest is located in the tropics north of the shoreline of Lake Victoria, immediately to the west of the River Nile. Mabira covers an area of . It is the biggest forest reserve in central Uganda and its one of the few surviving rain forests remaining in Uganda. Mabira is well known for Ecotourism which started way back in the early 1980s. The forest harbors in excess of 300 species of birds, many of which are rare; including the pied hornbill, superb sunbird, grey parrot, crowned eagle, black-billed turacos and the endangered Nahan's Frankolin. There are over 300 plant species, some of which are of medicinal value. Among the services offered to tourists are guided forest walks, camping sites, picnic sites and environmental education and entertainment with local drama groups. There is a network of trails to facilitate the exploration of the forest. ;River Nile The Nile is the world's second-longest river, measuring an estimated in length. It starts its journey on the outskirts of Jinja and traverses Uganda, southern Sudan, Sudan and Egypt to empty into the Mediterranean Sea at Alexandria. The river is of great geographical and historical importance locally and internationally. In Uganda, the Nile has cultural importance as well as economic significance. Many communities along its shores derive their livelihood from fishing its waters. At its point of origin, Uganda has built three hydroelectric dams which provide electricity to many citizens in Uganda and neighboring countries. Uganda plans three (3) other dams further upstream later in the present decade. In Sudan and Egypt, the river is considered to be the 'source of life' as its waters are used for irrigation and the support of agriculture for multitudes of people living along the river since time immemorial. ;The Source of the Nile River Nile forms the border between Njeru in Buikwe District on the west and Jinja, Uganda in Jinja District on the east. At this point, the river flows from Lake Victoria to begin its three-months journey to the Mediterranean Sea. This point, viewed from Njeru, is visited by tourists and holidaymakers for its scenery. The deep waterfalls that John Hanning Speke saw in 1862 and named \\"Ripon Falls\\" were submerged when construction on Nalubaale Dam began in 1947. The dam was completed in 1954.

Parygin was a specialist in a sphere of philosophical and psychological problems of social psychology – its history, methodology, theory and praxeology.  Biography  Parygin was born in Leningrad, USSR, where he survived the Siege of Leningrad. After school he attended Saint Petersburg State University where he studied philosophy (1948—1953, diploma with distinction). In 1961 he defended a theses about a problem of the social mood. In 1967 defended a doctoral theses Social Psychology as a science (questions of history, methodology and theory).Парыгин_Б_Д_8_1967  Research  After graduation he was teaching philosophy at Saint Petersburg State Pediatric Medical Academy (1957–1962). In 1965, Saint Petersburg State University publishing house had released Parygin’s first monograph Social Psychology as a Science, which became a bibliographical rarity. In 1967, a revised edition of the monograph (15,000 copies) was translated into Czech, Bulgarian, Portuguese and Spanish. From 1968 Parygin was at the head of the Philosophy Department of a Herzen University. There he created the laboratory of the social and psychologic studies and social psychology faculty which was the first one in the Soviet Union. Many first-rate scientists lectured there: Andreeva G. M., Bodalev A. A., Gumilev L. N., Klimov E. A., Lomov B. F., Porshnev B. F., Firsov B. M., Yadov V. A. and others. Аnd books edited by Boris Parygin were published. In 1971, Parygin’s work titled The Basics of Socio-Psychological Theory was published (20,000 printed copies). In his book, Parygin presented the concept of the main social and psychological problems and first of all—the question of personality and human communication. This book drew a wide response in a scientific sphere of the Soviet Union and abroad. The monograph was republished in Germany (Cologne, 1975, 1982, Berlin, 1975, 1976) and in Japan (Tokyo, 1977).

At the meeting of Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1972), however, Parygin was called a leader of international revisionism of Marxism because of his independent interpretation.Parygin Interview Later he was accused of the intention to substitute Marxist philosophy by the Personality psychology. Due to this, he had got a different job in a Social and Economic Problems Institute, where he organized and led the department of socio-psychologic problems of the labor collectives. The results of his work have found reflection in his books The Scientific-Technical Revolution and personality (1978), \\"Social and psychological climate of the collective\\" (1981), Social psychology of territorial self-government (1993) and others.

Though fictional, it was greatly influenced by Wittenborn's relationship with his father, who was a psychopharmacologist. Structure The novel has three different parts. Book One concerns a psychologist, Will Friedrich, in the competitive Yale psychology department of the 1950s and his pursuit of an anti-depressant and the serious effects it has on a student. \\"Book Two\\" occurs seven years later and is told from the perspective of Will's newborn son, Zach, who is eventually kidnapped by the student (who had apparently murdered one of Friedrich's sons). Book Three followed a grown-up Zach, now recovering from drug addiction, as he tries to piece his life together and figure out what has happened to his family. Plot summary The novel Pharmakon is divided into three parts. The first part of the novel, titled \\"Book 1\\", takes place in the 1950s and centers around Will Friedrich; a middle aged, nontenured professor of psychology at Yale University. Though extremely smart and known around campus for his ability to take a set of data and \\"calculate the standard deviation in his head\\", Will is having a hard time figuring out an idea to climb the social ladder into the upper circles of the Yale elite. This all changes when will overhears Dr. Bunny Winton about an exotic plant called \\"gai kau dong\\" or, \\"The Way Home\\". She describes how this plant has been used by a native tribe in New Guinea to calm people after traumatic events. He and Winton begin testing on the same plants used by the New Guinea tribe. After isolating the active ingredient in the plant, Winton and Friedrich test the drug on rats and experience positive results. One of their test subjects, Casper Gedsic, is originally described as a \\"bearded with pimples and peach fuzz, too shy to look a person in the eye.\\" almost immediately begins to see a change; Casper's new found confidence enables him to clean up his appearance and befriend Whitney Bouchard, a rich, Yale football player. After the drug trial concludes, Friedrich received a call from an intoxicated Whitney, talking about how Casper had changed ever since he stopped taking his medication and how he had created a list of everybody he blamed for his current state of despair, with Friedrich and Dr. Winton being at the top. Casper appears at Friedrich's house while Will was outside with his wife and children. With a gun at his side, Casper begins to approach, but then changes his mind and leaves. The police arrive at Winton's home to see that Bunny Winton had been shot dead and her husband had been beaten in paralysis. The police immediately rush back to Friedrich's house to protect him and his family in case Casper came back. As Friedrich was talking to the police and everybody was speculating why Casper may have left them alone at first, Will's youngest son, Jack, is found drowned in a birdbath in the garden outside. \\"Book II\\" begins approximately seven years after the conclusion of the first part. Will Friedrich has moved his family away from the New England area to Rutgers University in New Jersey in an attempt to start over away from the Casper incident. Casper was sentenced to a lengthy term in the Connecticut State Hospital for the criminally insane. The rest of the story is told from Zach's perspective. At one point, young Zach is left home under the care of his irresponsible older sister, and, while setting up a lemonade stand, Casper arrives and takes Zach to a remote lake for \\"swimming lessons\\", and allows Zach to fall into the water. Zach begins to drown, but Casper saves him and brings him home. Casper had recently escaped from the mental hospital with plans on exacting revenge on Will Friendrich. After all these years, Casper was convinced that it was Friedrich's fault that he felt depressed again once he stopped taking \\"The Way Home\\". When Zach gets dropped off at his house, his parents are frantically searching for him with help from the police. They soon are able to realize that it was Casper who had taken Zach \\"swimming\\", but they are dumbfounded on why he would let Zach live. After about a week of searching by the police, they are finally able to track down Casper once again and place him in a higher security mental hospital, which he never escapes from for the remainder of his life. Though Zach was relatively safe, this event traumatized him for the rest of his life. \\"Book 3\\" begins 21 years after Zach goes to college, going through cocaine withdrawal. The reader learns that Zach dropped out of Yale and moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. He hasn't talked to a majority of his family for years, especially his parents. His attempt at making contact goes horribly awry when his father sees him and recoils, thinking that Zach is just there to rob them. This enrages Zach and he storms off and goes to live with an old friend in the city, never speaking to his parents again. The book ends with Will lying in bed at night, trying to cry because he knows the therapeutic values of tears, but he is unable to. After all the anti-depressants he had helped make during his lifetime, he wonders if there is any way somebody can prescribe tears. Critical reception Pharmakon has received mostly positive reviews from critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times describes Pharmakon as \\"a smart, eccentric coming-of-age story about an entire culture's maturation process, not just one about the workings of a single family.\\" The Seattle Times writer Mark Lindquist declared Pharmakon as \\"a smart, pharmaceutical pick-me-up.\\" Though there are multiple good reviews, there have also been some negative ones. Due to the somewhat disjointed way the story was written, some critics found it a bit hectic. David Daley of USA Today said that the novel was \\"moments of genius, surrounded by confusion and bloat.\\" Other critics, such as Lionel Shriver of The Telegraph, felt that the story started off great, that it started to lag towards the second half making it \\"almost a wonderful novel.\\" References External links *http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/4347283/Pharmakon-by- Dirk-Wittenborn-review.html *http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/14/books/14masl.html 2008 novels Yale University Novels set in Connecticut ","title":"Pharmakon (novel)"},{"id":"30004958","text":"Students Aspire is a public artwork by American artist Elizabeth Catlett, located at 2300 6th Street NW on the Howard University campus in Washington, D.C., United States.

Description This bronze relief shows an African-American male and female figure in profile facing each other. The figures each have one hand on each other's waist and the other hand is raised above their heads. The raised hands are reaching towards a middle disk; part of a set of five which form an arch over the figures. Each disk has an image of a scientific or technological symbol. Beneath the figures is a square relief of the root system of a tree and at the end of each root is a face. It is signed \\"EC 77.\\" Information A plaque is placed on the wall just beneath the relief reading: :ELIZABETH CATLETT 1915– :1977 :THE SCULPTURE AND THE :CHEMICAL ENGINEERING WING :WERE MADE POSSIBLE BY A :GRANT FROM THE :EXXON EDUCATION FOUNDATION History of the piece Elizabeth Catlett was chosen to be the artist for this work by vote from faculty, staff and students of the College of Engineering. In 1973, a $600,000 grant from the Exxon Education Foundation was being used to construct the chemical engineering wing of the University's engineering building.Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Howard University Archives, HUA Subject Files, Folder Title: H.U. Art Exxon offered an additional $30,000 to fund art for the new engineering wing and that gift was approved in 1974. An art committee was set up to manage the selection of the artist for the project. Twenty-two artists were invited to participate and fourteen responded. A total of eight sketches of proposed artworks were submitted for display in the lobby of the engineering building and based on the response, four of the eight artists that submitted work were invited to submit maquettes of their proposed sculptures. Upon submitting their maquettes, artists spoke at the College about their proposals. In 1976, a vote was held and staff, faculty and students from the engineering school voted. Catlett's work won the contest. The sculpture was dedicated on May 12, 1978. Geraldine Pittman Woods spoke at the dedication. Description from Elizabeth Catlett > “The two students are holding each other up to express unity rather than the > competition that exists in education. The equal sign signifies scientific as > well as social equality—that everyone should be equal; men to women, > students to faculty, blacks to everyone else. The students form the trunk of > a tree. The medallions are arranged in a triangle like branches and the > plaque represents the roots.” She went on to say: “I was happy to have the > suggestions of the faculty and students. I listened to what they had in mind > and then I incorporated that in my own way.” – Elizabeth Catlett Condition This sculpture was surveyed in 1993 for its condition and it was determined that treatment was needed.

The German light, minelaying cruisers and attacked a westbound convoy of twelve colliers and their escorts. The two escorting destroyers and nine neutral Scandinavian ships were sunk off Shetland, Scotland. Admiralty code breakers had uncovered the call signs of Bremse and Brummer and by direction finding knew that they had sailed from Wilhelmshaven to Lister Tief (Lister Deep) north of Sylt but an operation as far north as the Scandinavian collier route was not anticipated. Both of the British destroyer commanders were commended for their bravery, though some members of the Admiralty felt that by leaving the convoy to engage a superior enemy force, they had left the merchant steamers open to attack. Other British ships did not receive reports of the attack until late afternoon, were not in a position to intercept and the German cruisers returned safely to port. The British called the attack on neutral vessels and giving no time for the crews to abandon ship an outrage and the Germans denied allegations that their ships had fired on survivors in the water.  Background  Net mine barrage The Admiralty anticipated that several U-boats would return to Germany via the North Sea in early October 1917 and planned to attack them with a larger force than that used in a similar operation in July. On passage through the North Sea, U-boats sailed between two minefields to the east of the Dogger Bank and the Outer Silver Pit, a funnel long, wide at the north end, narrowing to at the southern end. A ten- day period of observation was planned and a barrage of underwater mine nets was to be laid at the narrow end of the funnel. At the wide (northern) end, four submarines mounted a standing patrol; further south, two destroyer leaders, fourteen destroyers and a yacht patrolled between the latitudes of the Moray Firth and the Firth of Forth. The mine nets, from net drifter fishing boats, were to be placed at the northern part of the next section between the Firth of Forth and Flamborough Head. The nets were to be watched by four destroyers and sixteen trawlers, the commander of that section sailing in a yacht, HMY Goissa. The southernmost end of the funnel, where U-boats had to skirt British minefields on the Dogger Bank, was to be patrolled by Harwich Force. The operation consisted of 24 trawlers, 42 net drifters, 21 destroyers, a flotilla leader and four submarines. To maintain the standing patrols required between 15 destroyers and flotilla leaders and 29 (in early October), 18 destroyers of Harwich Force participated. To keep U-boats submerged, patrols on the northern sections began on 27 September. Stormy weather forced the destroyers in the middle section back to port three times and twice to abandon their patrol lines to ride out the storms. The submarines, patrol ships and net barrage boats saw nothing of note during the operation but the net drifters reported nine underwater explosions as the nets were being strung out. The explosions were taken to be premature explosions of mines caught in the nets. As dark fell more explosions were heard, two green rockets were spotted at the east end of the net line and more explosions were heard. On 3 October, hydrophones detected a submarine at the west end of the nets, an explosion and then silence. Other boats' hydrophone sets gave similar indications. Until 9 October, nothing more was heard until , an R-class destroyer, was attacked north of the net barrage and gave the alarm. Before the U-boat was expected to reach the nets, another was seen and attacked, then a U-boat engine was heard clearly and a depth charge was dropped. By now the nets and mines were so damaged by the stormy weather as to be ineffective and on 10 October the operation was terminated. The Director of Naval Intelligence reported a month later that three U-boats had been destroyed close to the mine trap and German sources later confirmed that U-50, U-66 and U-106 had been sunk. Coast and river mining After the success of the mine trap at the beginning of October and the mines laid across the Heligoland Bight, U-boats had begun to use the Kattegat into the Baltic Sea for outbound and return journeys. German minesweepers were constantly busy clearing mines and German battleships supported the minesweepers. The British devised a plan to lay mines close to the German coast and river mouths, while the High Seas Fleet was operating in the Baltic. While the arrangements were being made, four light cruisers, twelve destroyers and a destroyer leader were ordered to attack the German minesweepers operating in the German Bight. As soon as the preliminary operation was ready, the Admiralty ordered the operation to be postponed and all light cruisers and the twelve destroyers were to prepare to sail to intercept a German surface force believed to be in the North Sea. The Admiralty code breakers of Room 40 had uncovered the call signs of and and by direction finding, knew that they had sailed from Wilhelmshaven in the Jade Bay to (Lister Deep) north of Sylt. An operation as far north as the Scandinavian collier route was discounted. In the absence of intelligence of German intentions, Admiral David Beatty, the commander of the Grand Fleet, was constrained to scour the North Sea. Six light cruisers from Rosyth, with six destroyers, were ordered to the Bovbierg Light by on 16 October, to patrol a line south-west from Denmark towards the Horns Reef channel about offshore. A light cruiser squadron from Scapa Flow, accompanied by five destroyers, was to be off Jaederens Point in south-western Norway by to observe a line from the point to Hanstholm in north Denmark, across the west end of the Skagerrak. Two more light cruiser squadrons, each with five or six destroyers, were sent to patrol lines in the central North Sea by noon on 16 October. After notice from the Admiralty that would be reconnoitring on the same day, Beatty ordered an aircraft-carrying battlecruiser to conduct a sweep eastwards from just north of Middlesbrough. Prelude The Scandinavian Convoy In April 1917, the British began shipping coal north from the Humber Estuary to Lerwick in the Shetland Islands and then across the North Sea to Norway. The quota of required daily convoys from Lerwick, most being neutral ships, usually escorted by two British destroyers from eight detached from the Grand Fleet, supported by several armed trawlers. To 1 July, 351 ships made the eastbound journey from Lerwick and 385 the voyage westwards from Norway, an average of 368 round trips a month, for the loss of twenty ships. In July, ten ships were sunk by the attacks of SM U-67, SM U-60 SM U-94, SM U-52 and SM UC-55, from 454, a loss of 2.2 per cent. Seven depth charge attacks were made by escort ships to no effect and was torpedoed while escorting colliers northwards to Lerwick. In anticipation of the added difficulty of escorting colliers in the autumn, winter and spring, several cruisers were sent to the Humber. The Scandinavian convoys had been a considerable success but had to sail in waters where they were vulnerable to German surface vessels for most of the journey. The return voyage began in Bergen in Norway, a neutral port where sailings could be observed by Germans and the use of neutral ships made it impossible to keep convoy procedures and sailings secret. 15 October convoy Escorting the Scandinavian Convoy which departed Lerwick on 15 October were the destroyers (Lieutenant Commander Charles Fox, escort leader) and (Lieutenant Commander Edward Brooke) along with two naval trawlers, and . The destroyers were armed with three guns, three 2-pounders and two torpedo tubes each. Around noon on 16 October Mary Rose left the convoy to join the next convoy west assembling at Bergen as Stongbow saw to the dispersal of the eastbound colliers to their destinations. Mary Rose departed from Bergen with the twelve ships of the westbound convoy on the afternoon of 16 October. Mary Rose sailed beyond the convoy and after dark, when Strongbow made rendezvous, the destroyers were unable to communicate. Strongbow sailed on the port side of the convoy, which was spread out to the north and north-west. The night of 16/17 October passed quietly and by on 17 October, half an hour after dawn. Mary Rose was still ahead of the convoy. There was a fresh breeze [] blowing from the south-west raising a heavy swell but visibility was good. Neither destroyer commander had been informed of the sailing of a German surface force, the steps taken to intercept them or that an alarm covering the North Sea had been in force for two days. German sortie U-boat reports gave the impression that much shipping was moving between Lerwick and Bergen in Norway and the commander of the High Seas Fleet, () Admiral Reinhard Scheer, ordered an attack by surface ships. German bases to the south of the route made a surprise attack at the east end of the convoy route feasible; that the short days and stormy weather in the autumn and winter increased the possibility that a sortie could go unobserved was as obvious to the Imperial German Navy () as to the British. By forcing the British to reinforce the escorts of the Scandinavian convoy, a surface ship attack could help the wider U-boat campaign. The new, fast, minelaying light cruisers Brummer ( Max Leonhardi) and Bremse ( Siegfried Westerkamp), with a speed of , each armed with four naval guns and two (22-pounder) anti-aircraft guns, were chosen for an operation against the Scandinavian convoy and disguised to look like British C-class cruisers. Brummer and Bremse kept wireless silence and Brummer had a wireless interception team on board to jam British signals. On 17 October, a westbound convoy of two British, one Belgian, and nine Scandinavian ships was off Lerwick.  Action  Soon after lookouts on Strongbow spotted two unusual vessels approaching at a distance of over converging on the destroyer. Three challenges were signalled to the ships and the third challenge received an erroneous reply and Brooke called the ship to action stations. When the range was down to within and before the crew could reach action stations, the German ships opened fire with their guns. The first German salvoes at Strongbow cut the main steam pipe and many members of the crew below decks were scalded to death; Brooke was wounded and the ship was left dead in the water, with its decks covered with casualties. Other hits knocked out the wireless before the signaller could raise the alarm. Mary Rose also sent a wireless signal as it closed with the German ships and another station asked for the signal to be repeated but Brummer jammed the signal. The German ships jammed every subsequent attempt by the British to transmit a distress call. Brooke ensured that the code books and confidential papers had been jettisoned then ordered the ship to be scuttled; the survivors took to the water in a Carley float at about The German cruisers inflicted more damage on Strongbow while Elise was manoeuvring to rescue the crew and the ship sank at about Fox heard the gunfire astern, assumed that a U-boat had attacked the convoy and turned towards it, with enough time to go to action stations, hampered by not being able to use the torpedoes and guns at the same time because the range and deflection transmitters were not working. Fox soon saw the German cruisers and attacked at high speed, opening fire at about from a range of . The nearest German ship replied with erratic fire but at as Fox changed course, the German ships hit Mary Rose; at about Fox gave the order \\"abandon ship\\"and eight men got away on a Carley float. The German ships then attacked the convoy; P. Fannon and the three British ships escaped but the nine Scandinavian ships were sunk. Elise escaped and returned when the coast was clear to rescue survivors, including 45 men from the crew of Crossbow. The German ships returned to base without casualties or damage. Other British naval forces in the area did not receive news of the engagement until almost too late to intercept Brummer and Bremse.  Aftermath  Analysis The event was regarded as an outrage by the Allies who protested that the attack on neutral ships was illegal and that the Germans gave the crews of the merchant vessels no time to evacuate, thus resulting in a large loss of civilian life. Both of the British destroyer commanders received credit for bravery, though some members of the Admiralty felt that by leaving the convoy to engage a superior enemy force, they had left the merchant steamers open to attack. Casualties About 250 Allied and Scandinavian sailors were killed and at least fifty others were wounded. Fox died along with about seventy others from Mary Rose, only two officers and eight men surviving. Strongbow lost half of her complement; four officers and 44 men being rescued. The German ships were accused of shelling survivors in the water but they denied the accusation.

The fledgling Portuguese fleet was defeated, bringing a quick end to the brief Luso- Castilian war that begun in 1336. Background In 1328, the Alfonso XI of Castile married his cousin, Maria of Portugal, a daughter of his maternal uncle King Afonso IV of Portugal. But the marriage soon turned to scandal, when, shortly after, Alfonso XI dispatched Mary to a convent and took up openly with his mistress, Leonor Núnez de Guzmán. Hoping to avail himself of disaffection among the Castilian nobility, Afonso IV of Portugal declared war on Afonso XI Castile in 1336, citing the mistreatment of his daughter. The Genoese captain Emanuele Pessagno (Manuel Pessanha) had been hired by King Denis of Portugal in 1314 to develop a permanent navy. Pessanha, who was made the first admiral of Portugal in 1317, was eager to try out his new fleet. Soon after the declaration of war, the fledgling Portuguese fleet of 20 galleys, commanded by Pessanha, was dispatched to the coasts of Andalusia, intending to disembark a Portuguese amphibian force to seize Seville. However, the fleet was fended off and the landing prevented. Pessanha's fleet spent much of the remainder of 1336 off the coasts of northern Castile, supporting Afonso IV's invasion of Galicia. The Castilians responded with counter- invasions in the regions of Minho (led by Fernando de Castro) and the Alentejo (led by Alfonso XI himself). In the Spring of 1337, Pessanha set out from Lisbon with a fleet of 30 galleys, to once again attempt a landing on the Andalusian coast. But simultaneously, a Castilian fleet of 40 galleys sailed out of Seville, under the Galician captain Alfonso Jofre Tenório (Señor de Mogue), probably intending a similar landing on the Portuguese coast. Violent tempests prevented an encounter, and both fleets, damaged by the storms, were forced to return to port for repairs. Both fleets set out once again in early July, Pessanha's Portuguese fleet now reduced to 20 galleys and Tenorio's Castilian fleet reduced to 30. The battle The Portuguese and Castilian fleets finally met each other near Cape St. Vincent (the southwestern tip of Portugal). With the wind in their favor, the Portuguese gained the initial advantage and managed to seize as many as 9 Castilian galleys early in the encounter. But the winds soon changed and the luck turned. Tenorio's Castilian fleet fell on the Portuguese and soon overwhelmed them with their larger numbers. Jofre Tenorio managed to capture the captain's galley and took Pessanha prisoner. With their admiral gone, the Portuguese fleet broke up and took flight, with the Castilian galleys in pursuit nearly all the way back to Lisbon. In all, the Portuguese lost 14 galleys - 8 captured, 6 sunk.  Aftermath  Alfonso Jofre Tenorio did not attempt a landing, but hauled his prizes back to Seville. The victorious admiral was greeted there by a delighted Alfonso XI. The Portuguese prisoners, including the admiral Pessanha, were paraded in triumph through the streets of Seville. The defeat of the Portuguese fleet brought the Luso-Castilian war to a sudden halt. Afonso IV of Portugal reluctantly agreed to a truce mediated by the Bernard de Alby, Bishop of Rhodes (legate of Pope Benedict XII) and the Bishop of Rheims (envoy of Philip VI of France). The final peace and reconciliation between Afonso IV and his son-in-law Alfonso XI was effected only two years later, with the Treaty of Seville in July 1339, mediated by Maria of Portugal. Among the treaty's provisions was a commitment by Afonso IV of Portugal to assist Alfonso XI of Castile against an impending Marinid invasion force, then assembling in Morocco. This would culminate in the Battle of Río Salado in October 1340. Notes References * Quintella, Ignacio da Costa (1839) Annaes da Marinha Portugueza, v.1.

Television Klein's first television series, The Link, premiered on The National Geographic Channel on Friday May 25, 2012. The show is about the history of human innovation, tracing the connections between the world's greatest inventions in art, science, medicine, finance and more, from ancient times up to the present day. Each episode spans a dozen or so technologies, and traces how each one was dependent on the capabilities provided by the one before it. It is a modern version of James Burke's documentary television series, Connections. After that, Klein hosted a short series call Smart China, , debuting on Discovery Channel Saturday September 3rd, 2016. The show is about world changing innovations created across China and their implications for improving the environment, cities, travel, and more. Klein also co-produced the series Game Vision , for Discovery Channel, which debuted on Saturday September 16th, 2017. The series is focused on how games have evolved throughout history and are likely to evolve into the future, with an emphasis on sociocultural impact, technology, and the ways that games bleed over into our everyday lives.

The book was also featured on radio outlets such as NPR and KUOW. Crows In 2008 Klein displayed his thesis project at New York University's ITPITP (Interactive Technology Program) program. This thesis posited that synanthropic species (those that have adapted to living near or in human habitats) could be trained to contribute something useful through interaction with new systems as opposed to acting as parasites in a human environment. The demonstration of this was a deviceA vending machine for crows which dispensed peanuts and coins in a series of steps designed to teach the crows to drop coins into a slot in exchange for a peanut. Klein later spoke about this project at the TED conference and referenced the concept of synanthropy in his Make Magazine articlemakezine.com: The Civilized Cat makezine.com, 2009-10-19, via makezine.com on 2010-11-03 on training your cat to use the toilet. The authenticity of his thesis and claims made during a December 2008 interview with a New York Times reporter (and, by implication, his TED talk) were called into question by the publication of a correction by the paper April 2009. The correction stated the experiments never succeeded in teaching the crows to drop the coins into the slot. Klein issued a response to this correction on his website, in which he claims The Times damaged the overall project. Hacking Klein's speeches and articles frequently center on hacking as a theme, in which he reappropriates the term from its common misconception (as executing malicious computer attacks) to instead emphasize the unorthodox reworking of existing systems (systems thinking) for mutual benefit. This theme is elaborated on in his speeches to explain how he was able to achieve exploits such as publishing a book by giving it away for free, training crows to fetch coins, and reworking the employee/employer relationship.

History Richard Strauss wrote Enoch Arden for the actor Ernst von Possart, who in 1896 had assisted him in obtaining the post of Chief Conductor at the Bavarian State Opera. He wrote it while engaged in composing Don QuixoteLa Jolla Music Society and finished it in February 1897. Strauss and Possart toured together widely with the melodrama, in a German translation by Adolf Strodtmann.Music Web InternationalAnswers.com It was well received by audiences and Strauss's reputation was enhanced more by it than by his symphonic poems. The following year Strauss capitalised on its success by writing Das Schloss am Meere (The Castle by the Sea) to words by Ludwig Uhland.James Pritchett: Richard Strauss: Melodramas The work has been described as falling within the genre of incidental music. It consists mainly of brief interludes indicative of changes of time and setting, as well as moments of punctuation and commentary. Each of the two parts is introduced by a prelude and concludes with a postlude. Strauss uses leitmotifs to identify each of the characters: Enoch Arden (a chordal sequence in E flat), Annie Lee (a rising figure in G), Philip Ray (a melody in E), the sea (G minor).Audiophile Audition He does not develop these into melodies as such, but uses them statically. There are long passages where the piano is silent. Because of the sparse nature of the music, performances of Enoch Arden are largely dependent on the speaker rather than the pianist. Criticisms of the piece as a musical work per se do not do it justice, as it was never intended to be primarily a piece of music but a dramatic presentation with musical accompaniment. Enoch Arden was popular in its day, but slipped into obscurity when fashions changed and recitations, declamations and melodramas came to be considered passé. In recent years the work has attracted some notable names in both the speaker's role, including Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Jon Vickers, Michael York, Claude Rains, Benjamin Luxon, Patrick Stewart and Gwyneth Jones, and the pianist's role, including Glenn Gould, Emanuel Ax, and Marc-André Hamelin. Performances The English opera singer Richard Temple performed the work various times in the early 20th century, including at Steinway Hall in New York. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau presented the work in German a number of times from 1993. He also recorded the work twice, in the mid-1960s and again in 2003.

Women have a later age of onset and on average they are diagnosed 2 to 10 years later than men.Lindamer, Laurie A., James B. Lohr, M. Jackuelyn Harris, and Dilip V. Jeste. \\"Gender, Estrogen, and Schizophrenia.\\" Psychiatryonline.org. American Psychiatric Association, 2004. Web. 16 Nov. 2010. . In fact, the first onset of schizophrenia for men occurs around the ages of 20 to 25, while in women the first onset generally occurs between the ages of 25 to 30 years.Riecher-Rössler, Anita. \\"Schizophrenia in Women.\\" Medscape. WebMD, 8 Apr. 2004. Web. 9 Dec. 2010. . However, it has also been noted that in women a second peak in schizophrenia occurs at the ages of 40 to 45. During this period there is a significant drop in estrogen levels in the body. These factors have led researchers to believe that estrogen may have an effect on psychosis in women. In support of the above mentioned conclusions many studies have been performed. Doctors Lindamer, Lohr, Harris, and Jeste conducted a study to determine age of onset of schizophrenia in which they examined gender differences in 194 patients ranging in age from 35 to 97. They found that the mean age for onset in men was 30, while in women it was 39. (It is important to note that this is just one study, and overall averages come from a combination of different studies). About 37% of the women developed schizophrenia at the age of 45, while only 16% of men reported the same. Thus, more women than men experience late onset schizophrenia. This indicates that there is indeed another peak for women at the age of 45 and women do develop schizophrenia later in life. Another study was conducted on older men and women to determine how schizophrenia affects them. The study consisted of 36 women and 86 men, all of similar age. More women than men were found to have paranoid schizophrenia and suffered more from severe positive symptoms rather than negative symptoms. All of this information is consistent with other studies showing that women have a later age of onset of schizophrenia and suffer more from severe positive symptoms rather than negative symptoms. Estrogen and dopamine Genetic factors have much to do with developing schizophrenia.\\"New genetic findings in schizophrenia: Is there still room for the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia?\\" Frontiers in Behavioural Neuroscience 4 (2010).

In fact the \\"heritability of schizophrenia is around 80%, and a first degree relative has a 5 to 10 fold increase in the risk of developing the disorder compared to the risk for the general population.\\" It seems that individuals with schizophrenia inherit problems associated with dopamine in the brain.

Voit. \\"Computational Modeling of Synaptic Neurotransmission as a Tool for Assessing Dopamine Hypotheses of Schizophrenia.\\" Theime eJournals. N.p., 2010. Web. 9 Dec. 2010. . This led to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Animal studies provide evidence that estrogen regulates dopamine systems. In the studies performed on animals estrogen seems to act as a barrier to dopamine receptors. Thus estrogen may prevent the increase in dopamine found in patients with schizophrenia. This directly supports the idea that estrogen acts as a deterrent. This would explain why women have peak in the onset of schizophrenia in their late forties since at this time estrogen levels drop in women, causing the dopamine to increase, resulting in psychotic symptoms. Biochemical studies prove contradictory to this approach. In these studies the estrogen either increased or decreased dopamine receptors, depending on the time allotted for the experiment. This contradicts the theory that estrogen inhibits dopamine receptors, therefore acting as a protectorate against schizophrenia. Estrogen as a treatment Estrogen is often used to treat schizophrenia in women.American Friends of Tel Aviv University. \\"Estrogen in the fight against schizophrenia.\\" ScienceDaily. N.p., 25 Jan. 2010. Web. 9 Dec. 2010. . According to an online science article, \\"Prof. Ina Weiner of Tel Aviv University's Department of Psychology and her doctoral student Michal Arad have reported findings suggesting that restoring normal levels of estrogen may work as a protective agent in menopausal women.\\" This supports the theory that estrogen acts as a protectorate against schizophrenia. According to Dr. Weiner it has been known for a long time that when estrogen levels are low women are more susceptible and respond poorly to anti-psychotic drugs, thus supporting the use of estrogen as a treatment. In the study Dr. Weiner and Arad performed, ovaries were removed from rats resulting in low estrogen much like in menopause. As a result of the ovaries removal the rats showed schizophrenia like symptoms. To test if estrogen replacements work in reducing schizophrenia symptoms the rats were then given estrogen, and as predicted the schizophrenia symptoms decreased. The anti-psychotic drug haloperidol was also given to rats, but showed no signs of relieving the schizophrenia-like behavior, providing evidence for the effectiveness of estrogen in comparison with other anti-psychotic drugs. They also found that estrogen is effective for relieving schizophrenia in both male and female rats. In addition they found that low amounts of estrogen increase the effectiveness of anti-psychotic drugs. Although this study suggests that estrogen helps in alleviating symptoms, many argue that it could have side effects such as cervical cancer and heart attacks. Vivelle-dot, an estrogen patch As a result of her study, Dr. Weiner concluded that women suffering from schizophrenia should be given estrogen supplements in their mid-twenties and in their forties, when estrogen levels are decreased. This would improve the effectiveness of anti-psychotic drugs and would help in assisting women with schizophrenia in maintaining a normal lifestyle without peaks of schizophrenia in their forties. Dr. Weiner also believes that since men are less likely to develop schizophrenia after the age of forty, it is likely that estrogen is the \\"culprit\\". In 2008 a study was done to test the effectiveness of estrogen patches on schizophrenia patients.Gever, John. \\"Estrogen Patch Boosts Schizophrenia Treatment Success.\\" medpage. N.p., 4 Aug. 2008. Web. 9 Dec. 2010. . Over a period of four weeks the individuals tested showed a reduction in positive symptoms; however they showed no differences in negative symptoms. It is still not known exactly how estrogen helps in alleviating schizophrenia, however from this study the researchers felt that perhaps estrogen causes \\"rapid actions on cerebral blood flow and/or glucose metabolism\\". They also recognized that receptors for estrogen are located throughout the brain, thus the hormone estrogen can regulate neurotransmitters. They also noted that although in the short term estrogen can have positive effects, they are unsure of its reliability in the long term. However, they stated that they believed that estrogen could also be used in men, as previously found in other studies. Another study done in 1995 also showed that estrogen relieves positive symptoms in patients. In this study .02 mg of estrogen was administered to premenopausal women with schizophrenia. They found that at first the estrogen increased the efficiency of neuroleptics, but over a long period of time the effect of the estrogen reversed and decreased the efficiency of the drugs. The researchers concluded that while estrogen helps in the short term, in the long term it can be detrimental. These results were also found in the study mentioned previously.

Its common names refer to its distinctive, elaborate color pattern of small and large dark spots, which include \\"clown faces\\" beneath each dorsal fin. Reaching in length, this species has a very slender body with a short, flattened head and a large lobe of skin in front of each nostril. The first dorsal fin is placed behind the pectoral fins but ahead of the pelvic fins. Taxonomy The first specimens of the magnificent catshark were caught during a 1989 joint Thai-Burmese survey of the Myanmar continental shelf, and described by Peter Last and Vararin Vongpanich in a 2004 issue of the Phuket Marine Biological Center Research Bulletin. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin magnificus (\\"noble\\" or \\"splendid\\"), and refers to its \\"strikingly beautiful\\" coloration. The type specimen is a female long, collected by Weera Pokapunt aboard the FRTV Chulabhorn. Distribution and habitat The magnificent catshark is only known to occur in the northern Andaman Sea, off the coast of Myanmar. It inhabits water deep near the outer edge of the continental shelf. Description The largest magnificent catshark on record was long. Its body is firm and very thin. The head is rather flattened and tapers to a short, slightly bell-shaped snout. The nostrils are sizable and divided by well-developed lobes of skin on the anterior margins; the incurrent openings are tubular in appearance. The large, horizontally oval eyes are placed moderately high on the head and bear rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids); there are prominent ridges underneath. The mouth forms a long, wide arch with very short furrows at the corners. The teeth are tiny with typically three cusps in males and five cusps in females; the central cusp is the longest. The upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are over 80 tooth rows in the upper jaw. There are five pairs of gill slits; papillae (nipple-like structures) are present on the gill arches. The two dorsal fins are triangular with rounded apexes and gently concave trailing margins. The first dorsal fin is slightly larger than the second and originates behind the pectoral fin bases, while the second originates roughly above the rear of the anal fin base. The pectoral and pelvic fins have rounded tips, with the former much larger and broader than the latter. The pelvic fins of males have rather elongated, blunt-tipped claspers. The low, triangular anal fin is much smaller than either dorsal fin. The caudal fin is short, with a barely developed lower lobe and a distinct, enlarged tip on the upper lobe. The skin is covered by overlapping dermal denticles; the denticle crowns are narrow and placed on narrow stalks, with three teeth on their posterior margins. The coloration is distinctive, consisting of a dense variegated pattern of dark markings ranging from tiny to larger than the eye, on a brownish background. In particular, there are three spots above a fourth curved spot, forming a \\"clown face\\", beneath each dorsal fin. The spots extend onto the dorsal and anal fins, and the upper surfaces of the pectoral and pelvic fins. The underside varies from plain white to grayish with faint blotches. Biology and ecology Virtually nothing is known of the natural history of the magnificent catshark. Males attain sexual maturity at around long. Human interactions The conservation status of the magnificent catshark has not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Only five specimens are presently known to science.

Wuwei succeeded his father Yizhixie in 114 BC and died in 105 BC. He was succeeded by his son, Er Chanyu. Reign Wuwei Chanyu ruled during the reign of the Han emperor Wudi (r. 141–87 BC), after Wudi broke the heqin peace and kinship treaty with the Huns. His reign was marked by relative peace, with intensive diplomatic activities. The Huns intended to restore the heqin peace and kinship treaty with the Han empire. In turn the Han Empire wanted to weaken, isolate, and bring the Xiongnu into submission. Neither party succeeded in their main objective, but the Chinese further undermined the Xiongnu's' situation by splitting off their Wusun branch. Wuwei was a son of Yizhixie, and came to the throne by agnatic primogeniture succession. The Chinese annals did preserve his title before the enthronement.Bichurin N.Ya., \\"Collection of information on peoples in Central Asia in ancient times\\", vol. 1, p.42 Life Wuwei Chanyu succeeded his father in 114 BC. In the autumn of 111 BC, Gongsun He and Zhao Ponu led 25,000 cavalry against the Xiongnu, but failed to engage them. In 110 BC Wudi assembled in Shuofang (朔方城) a 180,000-strong cavalry army, and sent Guo Ji to notify Chanyu about the mobilization. When Guo Ji arrived, the Chanyu's master of ceremony asked him about the purpose his arrival. Guo Ji, with polite evasion, said that he wished to disclose it personally to the Chanyu. Chanyu admitted him. Guo Ji told him: “If the Chanyu is in a position to mount a campaign and fight with the Chinese state, the Son of Sky himself, he is waiting for you at the border with an army; and if he is not in a position to fight, he should turn his face to the south and recognize himself a vassal of the House of Han.” Wuwei was so enraged by this ultimatum that he immediately beheaded his master of ceremony and arrested Guo Ji, sending him off to Baikal in exile.Bichurin N.Ya., \\"Collection of Information on Peoples in Central Asia in Ancient Times\\", vol. 1, p.43 In spite of that, Chanyu was not inclined to attack the borders of China. Instead he gave rest to the troops and horses, and went hunting. In 110 BC, Wuwei rejected Han suggestions that he should submit to Han authority. At one point Wuwei was persuaded to pay a visit to Chang'an but cancelled the trip when news reached him that an advance Xiongnu dignitary had died on the way there. Convinced that he had been killed by the Han, Wuwei rejected all offers of peace. In 108 BC, Zhao Ponu sallied out with 25,000 cavalry against the Xiongnu but could not find them. He then attacked Loulan Kingdom and Jushi Kingdom with only 700 cavalry, subjugating them. His name meant \\"raven cord\\" in Chinese. In Old Chinese it would sound like \\"Qagwi\\", close to \\"Qagan\\". Death and successor In 105 BC, Wuwei Chanyu died on the 10th year of his reign. His son Wushilu, who was still a child, was proclaimed a chanyu according to their custom of agnatic primogeniture succession, and was named Er Chanyu.Bichurin N.Ya., \\"Collection of Information on Peoples in Central Asia in Ancient Times\\", vol. 1, p.46 Possibly there were no elder eligible candidates.

He has been called the \\"painter of presidents\\", because he painted portraits of Theodore Roosevelt, William H. Taft, and Herbert Hoover.Peter Hastings Falk. Who Was Who in American Art. Sound View Press. 1999. David W. Forbes. Encounters With Paradise: Views of Hawaii and Its People, 1778-1941. University of Hawaii, Honolulu. 1992.  Biography  George Burroughs Torrey in his studio (before 1900) He was born in the old Astor House in New York City. His parents were Joseph and Harriet Louise Burroughs. He had his first studio at 543 Fifth Avenue, where he drew and painted portraits. He moved to Paris, and had a studio there by 1893, just two doors from the Hungarian painter Mihály Munkácsy, on the Boulevard Malesherbes, and began his studies with Léon Bonnat, Jean-Joseph Benjamin- Constant and Alfred Philippe Roll. Roll used to come into his studio twice a week to criticise his work. In 1895, he exhibited his first salon portrait. He was particularly impressed with and influenced by the work of the portrait painter Carolus-Duran and the mural painter Pierre Puvis de Chavannes Torrey returned to New York in the spring of 1897, still retaining his Paris studio, where he spent six months of each year until 1906, He gave an exhibition at the Waldorf-Astoria and in the fall of 1897, he started leasing a studio at 543 Fifth Avenue. In the summer of 1902, he painted his first portrait of King George I of Greece at Aix-les-Bains, which now hangs in the palace at Athens. Two years later, he painted another portrait of George I of Greece, who presented it to his sister, Queen Alexandra of England. This portrait hung in the queen's private apartments at Buckingham Palace. When the second portrait was completed, the King gave a dinner in honor of Torrey at Aix-les-Bains and awarded him the Order of the Savior, and at the same time expressed his wish that Torrey go to Athens and paint a portrait of Queen Olga. The portrait of President Theodore Roosevelt was painted for Secretary of the Navy Paul Morton, who wished to present it to the city of Chicago, his former home. Secretary Morton had his own portrait painted by Torrey for the Navy Department. For a long time, Torrey lived at 27 East 35th Street. His house featured a \\"Pompeian Hall\\" that was decorated with vines and a Louis Quinze room. He hosted lavish dinners and vaudeville entertainment for guests such as the opera singers Geraldine Farrar, Antonio Scotti and Enrico Caruso.  Memberships  He was a member of the Union League, Home, and Studio Clubs.  Family  Torrey married Almirita Howes in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on November 10, 1891. She divorced him in 1912/13. He later married Lillie Hart Gay Torrey, a Hawaii artist. He spent much time in Hawaii, and painted numerous portraits of business people and politicians. He was related to Capt. Isaac Burroughs, who helped finance the Bridgeport Public Library. Several of Torrey's paintings were donated by his widow to the public library, including as a large painting of Capt. Bill Lewis at the wheel of a boat sailing on Long Island Sound.  Assessment  Portrait Sir Caspar Purdon Clarke, oil on canvas, 1907, Victoria and Albert Museum Seascape, oil on canvas, c. 1935, Honolulu Museum of Art Torrey in his days was a popular painter and drawer of the Gilded Age, even if his style went out of fashion over time. Torrey extensively studied the early English portraitists, whose influence is manifest in his glowing colour, and in the decorative disposition of his draperies. At the turn of the 19th century, he was acclaimed as a \\"fair draughtsman\\" with a \\"delicate, pretty color scheme\\", with his chief merit lying in refinement. He has had many sitters, and his portraits of ladies have a refined quality. His portraits are good in likeness, with graceful poses, details and textures of gowns and clothes in color. It is also argued however, that his seascapes should be counted as his best work. The Harvard Art Museums, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the National Museum of American History (Washington, DC), U.S. Navy Museum (Washington, DC), the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Wadsworth Atheneum (Hartford, CT), and the Yale University Art Gallery are among the public collections holding work by George Burroughs Torrey.

The film explores the psychology of ragging (hazing/initiation) and its disastrous effects on a student's psyche. It was directed by writer-director Manish Gupta, who had previously written Sarkar (2005) and directed The Stoneman Murders (2009). The film, starring Vatsal Sheth, Tulip Joshi and Mukesh Tiwari, was released worldwide on 21 January 2011. Plot One night at the boys' hostel at Jaigarh University, a senior student Feroz (Mukesh Tiwari) and his goons harass freshman geek Vishnu Pandey (Subeer Goswamin), stripping him down, molesting him and forcing him to act like a dog. His cries for help fall on deaf ears. Karan (Vatsal Sheth), an engineering freshman, arrives at the hostel. He meets Vishnu, Nilesh (Ramesh Chandane) and Bobby (Nirmal Soni) and befriends them. That evening, Akshay, a gang leader, tries to extort money from him in front of dozens of senior males. When Karan refuses he is beaten and Akshay takes him to Feroz. Feroz asks Karan to drink a glass of his urine and throws it at Karan's face when he refuses. Vishnu tells Karan Feroz has deliberately been unsuccessful in his exams so that he can continue to live in luxury in the hostel and has become the general secretary by intimidating the students. He is politically well-connected, and is expected to stand for local elections within a few years. Karan is refused help by the corrupt hostel warden, Sharad Saxena, who is loyal to Feroz and Karan is beaten even more in his presence. Feroz and his goons later ask Karan to do a striptease. When he refuses, they drag him out to the field, strip him naked in front of everyone and mock him. He is helped by Vishnu, Nilesh and Bobby. At the library, Karan breaks down crying as he recalls his humiliation. Science student Payal (Tulip Joshi) asks if he's okay and they become friends. Feroz's sadistic activities escalate and he starts selling drugs to students. Meanwhile, Karan and Payal fall in love. Once, when Karan is with Payal, Karan is called by one of the goons for ragging. Karan refuses, so Akshay comes to him with a mini-gang of five. They instigate Karan by trying to harass Payal. Karan retaliates and ends up beating them all, particularly Akshay. Feroz asks Akshay to take help from a gangster of his contact. When the gangster arrives with his goons Karan explains and convinces him that Feroz is using them. The gangster then tells Karan to contact him if he needs help. After this damage caused to his reputation by Akshay, Feroz expels Akshay from the gang and threatens him to leave the hostel within 24 hours. Feroz offers Karan Akshay's place but is declined. He tells Karan that they will no longer bother him as long as he minds his own business. Over the year he and his goons continue to torture freshmen. Some bear it without resistance while some leave. After a year, a naïve and weak new freshman, Pawan (Vinamra) arrives. In his room, he finds the goons, with Vishnu, Nilesh and Bobby, who have been corrupted by Feroz and are now part of his gang. They now believe that ragging results in manhood and this strains their relationship with Karan who befriends Pawan. One night, Feroz brings a prostitute to the hostel and asks Pawan to have unprotected sex with her to be witnessed by the entire gang and the warden. Karan interferes, saving Pawan although he takes a beating from Feroz. He is advised by Vishnu, Nilesh and Bobby to mind his business but he ignores them. Later he helps Pawan study for an exam while Feroz and his gang watch porn. When Karan leaves, Feroz and the gang, intoxicated and aroused, enter Pawan's room and rape him. A traumatized and pant less Pawan hangs himself from the ceiling fan with blood dripping down his legs, suggesting he was sodomized. The reluctant dean, under pressure from the trustees, blames the suicide on Pawan's psychological problems. Feroz warns Karan not to go to the press or he will rape Payal like he raped Pawan. Karan breaks up with Payal and sends her away to protect her. Later Karan procures a gun presumably from the gangster. That night, Karan locks all the hostel gates, goes to Feroz's room and shoots Vishnu, Bobby, Nilesh and the warden three times each. He gets into a fight with Feroz and his goons although he takes a vicious beating. Once he is holding the upper hand, despite the dean pleading with him not to kill Feroz as it will ruin his life, he shoots Feroz nine times, and ends the gang's reign of terror over the hostel. Production On the topic of Mukesh Tiwari being a bit too old to be a cast as a college student, Manish Gupta responded, \\"Mukesh Tiwari has been cast on purpose due to his age. He is shown to be a guy who's been failing for years together in order to remain in the university. He has a political agenda for being in the university. Using his clout as a student leader, he is attempting to enter state politics. The most shocking part is that guys like Mukesh Tiwari exist in real life. Each character in the film and each scene has been derived from heavy research and therefore has a base in reality.\\"Hostel discussion forum Passion for Cinema Respondents validated the director's comments about the harsh realities: Ajitesh Pathak said, \\"Innumberable examples of the Mukesh Tiwari character can be found in Kashi Vidyapeeth University in Banaras. How do you think leaders like Lalloo and Nitish Bhardwaj started their political journey. It was in University, where they just either keep failing or keep enrolling themselves in courses. People as old as 45 years old are still students. Excellent topic, Manish. I know there will be comparisons with Haasil and Gulaal, because of the premises of the subject, but I hope people see it as an entirely different subject, as it is truly unique.\\" Srikanth added, \\"People like these do exist in real life. Osmania university, Hyderabad is one such place where a lot of students do one degree after another or they keep failing for number of years in order to stay at university.\\" Soundtrack The music was composed by Virag Mishra.

Located at Southeast 37th Avenue and Tenino Street along Johnson Creek, the site is named for a mid-19th century family named Johnson that encouraged public use of its land along the creek. The park has paved and unpaved paths for hiking. A loop trail and boardwalk off the Springwater Corridor runs through the park. Ecology A good area for bird- watching, the park attracts owls, pigeons, kingfishers, and herons. In late spring and early summer, Tideman Johnson's big-leaf maples, alders, and other trees are frequented by warblers, grosbeaks and mourning doves. Other birds commonly seen in the park include sapsuckers, woodpeckers, chickadees, and bushtits. During a restoration project completed in 2006, workers identified 22 fish species in the creek at Tideman Johnson and counted 23 Chinook salmon and 107 steelhead trout. Maintenance Portland's Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) undertook the 2006 project to repair a sewer line that runs through the park. In 1922, when it was constructed, the Lents Interceptor sewer was buried about beneath Johnson Creek. Over the years, the stream washed away the fill above the pipe, exposing it to possible damage.

It produces and shares oral histories by American diplomats and facilitates the publication of books about diplomacy by diplomats and others. Its Foreign Affairs Oral History program has recorded over 2,500 oral histories and continues to grow; its book series includes over 100 books. ADST is located on the campus of the Foreign Service Institute in Arlington, Virginia.  Organizational mission  ADST promotes the importance of U.S. diplomacy by capturing, preserving, and sharing the experiences of America’s diplomats and other foreign affairs professionals to enrich diplomatic practitioners’ professional knowledge and strengthen public appreciation of diplomacy’s contribution to the national interest. ADST programs include: * Recording the oral histories of diplomats, family members, and others; * Facilitating the preparation and publication of books on diplomacy; * Contributing to diplomatic case studies and educational materials; * Supporting professional education at the Foreign Service Institute.  Oral history project  ADST's major initiative is the Foreign Affairs Oral History Project'. ADST interviews American diplomats after departure from government service about their career experiences and professional insights and assessments of leaders, successful and unsuccessful policies, and foreign conflicts. The oral history project was begun in the 1980s by retired U.S. Foreign Service officer Charles “Stu” Kennedy, who, after listening to several eulogies given at an ambassador's funeral, became concerned that the historically valuable personal recollections of U.S. diplomats might be lost forever if not recorded. Originally sponsored by Georgetown University's Lauinger Library, ADST subsequently assumed ownership of the project. The oral history collection is regularly referenced by scholars, authors, and media, including The Washington Post', The Atlantic, C-SPAN, RealClearPolitics, and others. Since 1986, ADST’s Foreign Affairs Oral History Program has recorded more than 2,500 interviews with former participants in the U.S. foreign affairs process. Collectively, these oral histories span over 80 years and provide first-person accounts of many dramatic incidents in U.S. diplomacy, such as the Iran hostage crisis, the Beirut and Nairobi bombings, accounts from World War II, the Vietnam War, and more recent narratives from 9/11, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Annually about 60 new interviews are added. The collection also contains significant oral histories dealing with U.S. diplomacy provided by universities and presidential libraries. The oral history collection has become one of the largest in the country on any subject and the most significant archive on foreign affairs. Oral histories have been used as source material for several books, such as John Pomfret’s The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom: America and China, 1776 to the Present, Derek Leebaert's Grand Improvisation: America Confronts the British Superpower, 1945-1957, Timothy Weiner's Legacy of Ashes, and Margaret MacMillan's Nixon and Mao: The Week That Changed the World. The Oral History Collection is a part of the Library of Congress American Memory collection. It is unclassified, available to the public, and can be found at the Library’s Frontline Diplomacy website. It is also available on ADST’s site under Oral History Interviews. Other ADST resources include the video series “Tales of American Diplomacy”, podcasts, and articles highlighting “Moments in U.S. Diplomatic History”; several resources have overlapping content in different formats to increase accessibility. ADST’s education landing page features six model high school lesson plans on diplomacy, based on oral history primary source material for educators. Country readers and subject readers comprising excerpts from oral histories compiled by country or topic facilitate research and enhance background knowledge. In order to honor and highlight the diversity of the Foreign Service, ADST has compiled a legacy collection of the oral histories of African American diplomats and diplomats of Latino descent.  Publications  ADST has facilitated the Dept 2018 and beyond/adst.org/publications/ publication of over 100 books pertaining to diplomacy, international history, and the Foreign Service. Books published in its Diplomats and Diplomacy Series include Nicholas Platt’s China Boys: How U.S. Relations with the PRC Began and Grew, Jane C, Loeffler’s The Architecture of Diplomacy: Building America’s Embassies, Herman J. Cohen’s The Mind of the African Strongman: Conversations with Dictators, Statesmen, and Father Figures, Joyce E. Leader’s From Hope to Horror: Diplomacy and the Making of the Rwanda Genocide, autobiographies of Brandon Grove, Robert H. Miller, and David Newson, and dozens of others. Among the life stories in ADST’s Memoirs and Occasional Papers Series are those of Diego Asencio, John Gunther Dean, Ginny Carson Young, Deane R. Hinton, and Robert E. Gribbin. ADST is a 501(c)3 organization headquartered at the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center in Arlington, Virginia. Its founders included retired ambassador and Foreign Service Institute director Stephen Low, Richard B. Parker, and Herbert Hansell.

It was built to safeguard American settlers in Yavapai County. History Fort Date Creek is located along Date Creek near the OX Ranch and was originally named Camp McPherson for General James B. McPherson at its founding on January 23, 1867. The fort was initially a temporary base protecting the road from La Paz to Prescott during the Hualapai War. Just after being founded, it was abandoned for a new post named Camp Skull Valley, twenty-five miles to the north in March 1867. On May 11, 1867, the fort was reopened and renamed Camp Date Creek and later Fort Date Creek. The fort itself was moved a short distance twice, but always remained along the creek. In 1868 the garrison included two infantry companies from the 14th Regiment and beginning in 1869, the area became an important center for fighting hostile native Americans. A temporary reservation was established at the fort in 1869 for the Hualapai people but by 1874 the United States Secretary of War declared that it was no longer needed for military purposes. Fort Date Creek then became a settlement for American pioneers for several years. As of today a few adobe buildings and a cemetery mark its location.

She was of 90 tons (bm) and was armed with twelve 4-pounder guns. Then in August 1799, the hired armed vessel Tartar participated in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. The expedition was under the command of Admiral Adam Duncan and the Duke of York. Some 250 craft of all sizes transported 17,000 troops from Margate Roads and the Downs across the Channel on 13 August. Due to bad weather it was 21 August before they anchored off Kijkduin. The next day Vice Admiral Mitchell sent a summons to Vice Admiral Samuel Story, calling on him to surrender his fleet. When he declined, the Duke of York landed his army near Den Helder on 27 August under covering fire from the fleet. Den Helder was occupied the following day when the garrison evacuated the town. The expedition then took possession of 13 old warships laid up in ordinary. On 30 August, Mitchel again summoned Story. This time Story agreed to surrender his squadron of 12 modern warships. The Royal Navy purchased 11 of these. The Dutch surrender, without any resistance, became known as the Vlieter Incident. As a result of the surrender, Duncan's fleet was awarded prize money, in which Tartar shared. Possibly related vessels Tartar was a popular name for British privateers with some 23 letters of marque being issued between 1793 and 1815, covering what appear to be some eight or so different vessels. Among these there was one 90-ton cutter. She was armed with eight 2-pounder guns and six swivel guns. Her crew of 24 men was under the command of Benjamin Jelly Worthington, and her letter was dated 25 February 1793.Letter of Marque, p.89 – accessed 25 July 2017. Benjamin Jelly Worthington received a second letter of marque, dated 5 July 1794, for the cutter Tartar, of 100 tons (bm), armed with ten 2-pounder guns and having a crew of 23 men. Whether this vessel became the hired armed cutter or whether Worthington sailed in a different vessel is an open question.

Comparison  Software support   Flash  Originally, web browsers could not render Flash media themselves, and required the proprietary freeware plugin Adobe Flash Player. Until 2008, there was no official specification by which to create an alternative player. Alternative players have been developed before 2008, but they support Flash to a lesser degree than the official one. Flash support is built in to Google Chrome, Internet Explorer 10 (and later), and Microsoft Edge. The latest version of the Adobe Flash Player runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, RIM, QNX and Google TV. Earlier versions run on Android 2.2-4.0.x (Flash has been released for 4.0, but Adobe announced that they will discontinue support for Android 4.1 and higher.) (Flash 11.2), GNU/Linux (Flash 11.2, except for Pepper Flash which is maintained and distributed by Google, not Adobe), PlayStation 3 (Flash 9), PSP (Flash 6). Adobe Flash Lite runs on Wii, Symbian, Maemo Linux, Windows Mobile, and Chumby. Apple never allowed Flash to run on iOS, the operating system which runs on iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch and Apple TV. Apple never had plans to do so, even after Adobe announced Flash Player's end-of- life in July 2017. Apple has officially dropped support for Adobe Flash from the macOS version of Safari 14 released on September 17 2020 for macOS 10.14 Mojave & macOS 10.15 Catalina. In February 2012, Adobe announced it would discontinue development of Flash Player on Linux for all browsers, except Google Chrome, by dropping support for NPAPI and using only Chrome's PPAPI. In August 2016, Adobe announced that, beginning with version 24, it would resume offering of Flash Player for Linux for other browsers. Adobe will stop traditional support for the Flash platform in 2020, both Firefox and Google Chrome are phasing out support of Flash.https://www.bubbleshooter.net/blog/2019/12/05/the-end-of-flash/  HTML5  All web browsers support HTML and other Web standards to various degree. Adobe released a tool that converts Flash to HTML5, and in June 2011, Google released an experimental tool that does the same. , versions of browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari implement HTML5 to a considerable degree. However, some portions of the HTML5 specification were still being implemented by browser makers. As of January 2015, YouTube defaults to HTML5 players to better support more devices.  Vendor neutrality  Until 2008, the use of Flash was covered by restrictive licenses. The conditions prohibited use of the specification to develop any software (including players) which could render or read (and thus convert) SWF files, and required the output SWF files to be compatible with Adobe's players. In 2008, restrictions on use of the SWF and FLV/F4V specifications were dropped, and some specifications were released. However, the \\"SWF File Format Specification Version 10\\" allegedly did not contain all the needed information, did not contain much information that hasn't been previously known by the community, and itself could not be copied, printed out in more than one copy, distributed, resold or translated, without written approval of Adobe Systems Incorporated. Flash is not an open standard. It is controlled by one firm, Adobe Systems. In contrast, HTML5 is controlled mostly by a committee, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). Various people have praised Flash over the years for rendering consistently across platforms. Constructing sites in Flash is a way to prevent code forking, whereby different versions of a site are created for different browsers. Speaking at 'Adobe Max' in 2011, Itai Asseo likewise said that, unlike HTML5, Flash offers a way to develop applications that work across platforms. HTML5, he said, is currently implemented differently (if at all) by different browsers. Although the Flash browser plugin is not supported on the Apple iPhone OS, Flash applications can be exported to Adobe AIR, which runs on that operating system as a native application. In the same talk, Mr. Asseo lamented the return to another browser war (as seen in the late 1990s). If Flash falls out of favor, he said, web developers will either have to develop many different versions of their web sites and native applications to take into account different HTML5 implementations, deny access to browsers that do not support their version of HTML, or dramatically reduce the functionality of their sites in order to deliver content to the least-advanced browser.  Authoring  Constructing Flash websites using Adobe tools is relatively easier than with integrated development environments for CSS, HTML, and JavaScript; however, many of Adobe's tools are expensive and proprietary software. Tools for HTML5 are just starting to come to market; in the meantime, Adobe has released a first version of a Flash-to-HTML5 conversion tool for existing content and are working on creating new tooling for HTML5 as well, like Adobe Edge. Because HTML5 is an open format, tools like those for Flash can be built for it, too. Applications like Hype and Adobe Edge are already on the market.  Performance  Flash has a better performance than HTML, as a comparison of Flash with HTML in 2010 listed Flash as being faster than the other technologies, when used for non-video animations, although they are catching up. Some users, more so those on macOS and Linux, have complained about the relatively high CPU usage of Flash for video playback.\\"Flash – CPU Usage – FPS – Frame Rate.\\" Online posting. 10 December 2008. Reader discussions, Adobe Support Forums. 10 December 2010 This was partially because the Flash plugin did not use the GPU to render video. Adobe has responded to some of those criticisms in the 10.1 and 10.2 releases of the Flash plugin by offloading H.264 video decoding to dedicated hardware and by introducing a new video API called Stage Video. The use of the newer ActionScript 3.0 inside Flash movies instead of the older ActionScript 2.0 improves code execution speed by a factor of around 10. The software routines written by developers can also affect the performance of applications built in Flash, reasons that would affect HTML5 animations as well.  DRM  Flash includes DRM support. The main HTML 5 standard does not include any digital rights management functionality directly, instead the Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) specification describes a communication channel between web browsers and digital rights management (DRM) agent software. The EME is not a complete DRM implementation, but just a specification for how the DRM implementations might operate. Historically, before EME introduction implementations could support DRM, for example in codecs. The proposal to add DRM features to HTML5 itself has been criticized by those who consider openness and vendor-neutrality (both server- and client-side) one of the most important properties of HTML, because DRM is incompatible with free software, and in the proposed form potentially not more vendor-neutral than proprietary plug-ins like Flash.  Accessibility  Both Flash and HTML text can be read by screen readers. However, special care must be taken to ensure Flash movies are read correctly. For example, if a Flash movie is set to repeat indefinitely, this can cause a screen reader to repeat the content endlessly. Selecting the \\"Make object accessible\\" check box in Adobe Flash Professional will create a text-only version of the object for screen readers. It will also hide any motion from the screen reader. Since Flash content is usually placed on a single webpage, it appears as a single entry in search engine result pages, unless techniques like deep linking are used with libraries like SWFAddress to provide multiple links within Flash websites and web applications. User interface widgets in Flash objects don't always behave like their host native counterparts. Keyboard, mouse and other accessibility shortcuts may not work unless the webpage developer explicitly adds support for it.  Search engines  Both Flash content and HTML content can be indexed by Google, Yahoo!, and Bing, although bi-directional text (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew) is not supported by Google. Yahoo! added support for indexing Flash sites in 2008, although Google had been able to index them for several years before that. Bing added support for Flash sites in 2010.  iOS devices  Apple has been promoting HTML5 as an alternative to Flash for video and other content on the iOS, citing performance reasons for not allowing Adobe Flash Player to be installed on iOS devices, including the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad. Flash applications can be packaged as native iOS applications via the Adobe Integrated Runtime and the iOS Packager.

A JTF-E headquarters may be formed per Joint Publication 3-40 (JP 3-40) one of two ways: 1) An existing headquarters designated by a Combatant Commander with Joint Elimination Coordination Element (JECE) augmentation and 2) Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) establishing a JTF-E by utilizing the JECE and another existing headquarters. WMD elimination operations are actions to systematically locate, characterize, secure, disable, or destroy WMD programs and related capabilities. The objective of WMD elimination operations is to prevent the looting or capture of WMD and related materials; render harmless or destroy weapons, materials, agents, and delivery systems that pose an immediate or direct threat to the Armed Forces of the United States and civilian population; and exploit, for intelligence purposes, program experts, documents, and other media, as well as previously secured weapons and material to combat further WMD proliferation and prevent regeneration of a WMD capacity. A JTF-E should possess the following capabilities:http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_40.pdf *(1) Coordinate, through the supported Combatant Commander (CCDR), to ensure an interagency approach to isolate the adversary's WMD program. This includes capabilities used to isolate personnel, equipment, material, agents, weapons, and delivery systems that may not be controlled at the tactical level. These include capabilities to monitor and coordinate denial measures to close down cross border proliferation and ex-filtration of WMD, related material, means of delivery, and program personnel. *(2) In coordination with, and with assistance from, maneuver forces, locate, seize and secure WMD, WMD sites, means of delivery, related-material, and expertise across a broad scope of programs. *(3) Coordinate exploitation of WMD sites and individuals associated with WMD programs. *(4) Conduct rapid destruction/render harmless nonnuclear WMD or WMD agents (e.g., mixed chemical and biological agents) in various dispositions (bulk, rounds, submunitions) for force protection purposes. *(5) Integrate the exploitation of WMD infrastructure (e.g., plutonium reprocessing and high-enrichment uranium facilities); WMD R&D; (e.g., nuclear research reactors); and WMD weapons, components, and materials. *(6) Redirect expertise. When directed, transfer former adversary's personnel with WMD- related expertise or their personnel files to the lead USG agency for threat reduction cooperation. *(7) When directed, initiate redirection of WMD programs and catalogue dual-use facilities in preparation for transfer to the lead OGA for threat reduction cooperation or similar mission. *(8) Locate, seize, and control illicit or excess radiological materials. *(9) Exploit and, if necessary, destroy WMD-capable missile systems and other delivery systems. *(10) Report potential imminent threats discovered in accordance with JOPES and supported CCDR procedures. *(11) Recommend reprioritization of WMD program components based on exploited sites. *(12) Remain in compliance with related treaties; and establish and maintain chain of custody of seized materials, records, and personnel for further exploitation or transfer to legal authorities. *(13) Coordinate and deconflict existing nuclear render safe capabilities with JTF-E operations. This construct evolved from the 2006 and 2010 Quadrennial Defense Reviews to become the Standing Joint Force Headquarters for Elimination (SJFQ-E) and was assigned to Defense Threat Reduction Agency in 2012.https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a612272.pdf That role was eliminated in 2018 when USSTRATCOM gave up its lead DoD responsibility to plan for and advocate counter-WMD issues to USSOCOM.

History In late 2008, a HTC roadmap leaked to the technology press featuring future HTC devices. One of these was labeled the HTC Trophy. A BlackBerry reminiscent phone, the device sported a 3-inch touchscreen with a portrait Qwerty keyboard and a trackball. For several years, this phone was not heard of again, largely due to the internal shakeups going on at Microsoft involving the move from Windows Mobile 7.0 to Windows Phone 7 Series (Later renamed Windows Phone 7), as well as problems with development of the KIN devices. When Microsoft announced its new mobile OS at Mobile World Congress 2010, most journalists assumed that the HTC Trophy had been abandoned. But a new model (codenamed HTC Spark) began to appear in leaked spy shots, and the phone was released as the HTC 7 Trophy to international markets on October 21, 2010. In January 2011, a leaked internal document to Microsoft employees appeared on Engadget's website. It offered the phone for $199.99 to Microsoft employees. Many took this to mean that the phone would soon be launching on Verizon's network. After several more leaks, Verizon announced the phone on May 19, 2011 to be available in early June.Verizon Announces WP7 HTC Trophy, Confirms Release Date, Price Pocketnow It was discontinued by the end of January 2013. Product Specifications The Trophy features a 3.8\\" capacitive touchscreen display that is a WVGA LCD panel on international versions, and a WVGA SLCD panel on the US Verizon version. The phone has a 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor (QSD8250) with 512 Mb of ROM and 576 Mb of RAM. International versions have 8 GB of built-in storage on a (non-user accessible) microSD card, while US versions have 16. Verizon has updated the Trophy smartphone with a new update to the HTC Trophy 8107. The updated will fixes a Gmail syncing issue, a location access issue, an email issue involving Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 and disappearing virtual keyboards. International vs. US In addition to having specification differences, the Trophy and 7 Trophy have slight design differences as well. The 7 Trophy features a bright yellow battery compartment (typical of HTC Windows Mobile devices in the past), whereas the Trophy has a bright red battery compartment (to acknowledge the phone's Verizon ties). Press images of the Verizon device also appear to show a small circular cutout beneath the battery door, and above the Windows Phone logo. This circle is an external antenna port cover.

Particular standouts are ...

He had been dismissed after repeated problems with drinking and general work habits. An armed confrontation with the editor ensued on 24 March 1880.

Baker waxy cap, the brown almond waxy cap or the tawny almond waxy cap, is a species of fungus in the family Hygrophoraceae. It is characterized by its medium to large, relatively slender-statured fruit bodies with an almond odor, and growth often on or near rotting conifer wood. The slimy cap is brown in the center and cream to white near its curved edges. The gills and the stem are white, and in moist environments are often covered with droplets of a translucent liquid. The mushroom is known only from the United States, where it is common in coniferous forests throughout the Pacific Northwest. It was initially collected in Washington State on Mount Baker, a volcano. Although edible, the mushroom is not considered to be of high quality. Taxonomy and naming The species was first described scientifically by American mycologists Alexander H. Smith and Lexemuel Ray Hesler in a 1942 publication. The specific epithet bakerensis refers to Mount Baker, a volcano in the North Cascades of Washington State in the United States, where the mushroom was first collected. It is commonly known by various names, including the \\"Mt. Baker waxy cap\\", the \\"brown almond waxy cap\\", and the \\"tawny almond waxy cap\\". Description The cap margin is rolled inward, and the gills are closely spaced. Characteristically, this young specimen has droplets of a clear liquid beaded on the margin, gills, and upper stem. Young fruit bodies of H. bakerensis have rounded caps with cottony margins that are rolled inward; as the mushrooms mature the caps flatten out and the margins may lift upward. The diameter of the cap reaches between . The center of the cap is colored yellow-brown, tawny or amber, reducing to nearly white at the margin. The cap surface is slimy when wet, and sticky as it gets older and dries out. Beneath the slime layer are hairs that are plastered tightly to the surface, which clump together a few at a time to form many little streaks. The firm white flesh of the cap is thick— near the stem attachment—and tapers evenly to the margin. It does not change color when cut or bruised. It has a mild taste and a characteristic fragrant odor that resembles almonds, or \\"crushed peach pits\\". The waxy gills are decurrent or bluntly attached to the stem. The gill spacing is close to subdistant—between 56–88 individual gills reach the stem, with 2–3 tiers of short lamellulae (shorter gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The gills have even edges, and are narrow but become broad in large caps (8–12 mm), ranging in color from creamy white to pinkish-buff. They do not discolor when they are bruised. Young specimens often have drops of a clear liquid beaded on the gills. The gills of dried specimens darken considerably. The stem is long, thick at the apex, solid (i.e., not hollow), and either equal in width throughout or narrowed downward. Its color is white to pale pinkish-buff, with a dry surface. The top portion of young specimens have a cottony, fine whitish powder near the top, but this sloughs off as it matures. Like the gills, the top of the stem is often beaded with drops of translucent liquid in moist weather. The spores are ellipsoid, smooth, and measure 7–9 by 4.5–5 µm. They are yellowish when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are four-spored, and measure 40–54 by 6–8 µm. There are no cystidia on the gill faces or edges. The cap cuticle is an ixotrichoderm—a layer of gelatinized tissue where the distal portion of the filamentous hyphae are different lengths and the hyphae themselves are arranged perpendicular to the surface; this layer of gelatinous hyphae is between 100 and 250 µm thick. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of the cuticle and the gill tissue. Edibility The mushroom is edible, but considered to be of low quality. Smith does not recommend the mushroom for consumption, noting, \\"I have been informed by a number of collectors that the species is edible, but many of them thought it was a Clitocybe or a Tricholoma!\\". Similar species Hygrophorus variicolor is very similar in overall appearance, differing only in having a stem made slimy by a gelatinous partial veil. H. tennesseensis is another lookalike species, but has a farinaceous odor (like raw potatoes) and a bitter taste. H. arbustivus is a European species found under oaks. The \\"clay waxy cap\\" (H. discoideus) is another lookalike European species; there is a North American equivalent H. discoideus var. californius found at high elevations in the Sierra Nevada. Other North American species of Hygrophorus with an odor of almonds include H. agathosmus (which has a gray cap), H. monticola (larger spores), and H. vinicolor (which has larger spores and an unpleasant taste). Collybia oregonensis has a similar coloration and odor, but has adnexed or notched and non-waxy gills. Habitat and distribution Hygrophorus bakerensis is an ectomycorrhizal species, and forms a mutualistic relationship with compatible host plant by forming a sheath around their root tips. In this way, the fungus gains carbon and other essential organic substances from the tree and in return helps the trees take up water, mineral salts and metabolites. It can also fight off parasites and predators such as nematodes and soil pathogens. Associated tree species include Douglas-fir. The fruit bodies of H. bakerensis grow scattered, clustered, or in groups on the forest floor under conifers. They are common at elevations of throughout the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and the northern Rocky Mountains, and have been collected from California, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. It has been found as far north as Hazelton, British Columbia east to Quebec, Canada. Fruit bodies typically appear from September to December, and they can be very common.

Introduction The activities of the microbes are measured using geophysical imaging techniques. A lot of these techniques are based on the measurement of electric potential anomalies, which in this case can arise from microbes, their growth, metabolic by-products, and microbially mediated processes. The primary way in which these anomalies are generated can be explained by the electrical double layer. The effects are most visible when low frequency field is used as the surface charge of microbes is of low mobility.

Biography  Early life and education  Alice Merrill Horne (called Allie in her youth) was born in Fillmore, Utah Territory, to Clarence Merrill and his wife Bathsheba (Kate) Smith. Her maternal grandparents were George A. Smith and Bathsheba W. Smith. Horne earned a teaching certificate and degree in pedagogy at the University of Deseret (now the University of Utah). She also studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and was later instructed privately by artists John Hafen, George M. Ottinger, J. T. Harwood, Herman Haag, Mary Teasdel, and Henry Taggart. Alice Merrill Horne married George H. Horne in 1890. They met while Alice Horne was organizing a Shakespearean Society. George would spend much of his career as a banker in Salt Lake City. Early in their marriage, George served as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the southern United States, and during this time Alice worked as a schoolteacher at the Washington School in Salt Lake City. George and Alice had six children. Horne was made chair of the Utah's Liberal Arts Committee for the 1893 Columbian Exposition and World's Fair in Chicago.  Political Career and Leadership Positions  In 1898, Horne was elected to the Utah House of Representatives (3rd Utah State Legislature) representing the Salt Lake Eighth District. She served for one term (1898-1900) and made many notable contributions in a short time. She advocated for many bills that eventually became law. While many of them revolved around the arts and education, she did not limit her influence to those areas alone. While in the state legislature, she was a key force behind enacting a bill to create a state art institute and to create a state art collection. The latter is today named the Alice Art Collection after her (State of Utah Art Collections). Professor William M. Stewart of the University of Utah brought a scholarship bill to her and asked for her help with it. It was passed, and by 1921 had provided more than 8,000 students with scholarships. Among others, Horne campaigned for a Public Health bill, an Art bill, and a Fish and Game bill. She served on the Rules, Public Health, and Education and Art committees during her term in office and was also chair of the new University Land-Site Committee that oversaw the acquisition for the current site of the University of Utah. In 1901, Horne was called as a member of the general board of the LDS Church's Relief Society. She served on the board until 1916 and during part of this time was chair of the art committee. In 1904, she served as a delegate on behalf of the Relief Society to the International Congress of Women held in Berlin, where she delivered two addresses. She served as president of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers from April 11, 1903, to April 24, 1905. She was a leader and advocate in numerous other ways, including as a regent of the Daughters of the Revolution and the Chair of the Utah branch of the National Peace Society. Horne also played a role in organizing the Women's Chamber of Commerce in Salt Lake City as well as the Smokeless Fuel Federation. Horne authored two books at this time in her life: Devotees and Their Shrines and Columbus, Westward Ho!. The former is a handbook of Utah art and artists that aligns with her continual promotion of the arts throughout her life's work. A portion of her introduction to the book reads, \\"God has created gifts, and men work so that we are not without poets, painters, sculptors, architects, craftsmen, gardeners and home makers. So long as talent and industry unite there will be art—original, spontaneous, inspirational—the kind that lives.

Many departments of the U.S. Federal Government play a role in smoking cessation. Health and Human Services (HHS): The most prominent role of the US Government comes under the authority of several agencies within the Department of Health and Social Services. * Food and Drug Administration (FDA): H.R. 1256: Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was signed into law as Public Law No:111-31, on June 22, 2009. This law grants the Secretary of HHS and the FDA extensive powers to regulate production, marketing and use of tobacco products. The 2010 case Sottera, Inc v. Food & Drug Administration found that electronic cigarettes are a type of tobacco product, not a \\"drug\\" or \\"device\\" or combination product, and, therefore, fall under the Tobacco Control Act. The Act grants the FDA the power to collect and record information concerning contents of cigarettes and to disseminate that information to the public. * National Institutes of Health (NIH): through its National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA): supports grants for research on drug abuse, including nicotine addiction. Some of these grants study cessation programs. NIDA also publishes non-technical reports of this research for benefit of the public, as well as publications that summarize what is known about nicotine addiction and tobacco cessation programs. * Office of the Surgeon General: Publishes in print and on the web, a variety of materials related to smoking health issues and cessation of smoking. * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): through its Office of Smoking and Health (OSH) is the lead federal agency for comprehensive tobacco prevention and control. * Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS): reimburses costs for limited counseling by physicians and other healthcare providers. Medicare will pay for certain approved prescription drugs, and not for over-the-counter treatments such as nicotine patches or gum, under Medicare Part D coverage. * Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ): through its Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) published a report in 2005, \\"Tobacco Use: Prevention, Cessation and Control\\", based on a systematic review of literature using data from the Surgeon General's 2000 report, Cochrane Collaboration Reviews and several other systematic reviews and meta-analysis. * National Cancer Institute (NCI): maintains several resources for consumers: Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates cigarette packaging and government warnings.

The show is organized by the Wanneroo Agricultural Society (Inc.) and is held in the City of Wanneroo,http://www.wanneroo.wa.gov.au/Lifestyle/Events/Wanneroo_Show_2009 in the northern metropolitan area of Perth, where it has been traditionally held since the first show in 1909. Featuring numerous competitions in the areas of agriculture, arts and crafts, photography, cooking, art, beer and wine and horticulture as well as commercial attractions including rides, showbags and commercial stands, the Wanneroo Show has grown to attract 15,000 people a year.  History  The first Wanneroo show was officially opened by John Forrest on 21 April 1909. Following a resolution of the Wanneroo Road Board on 7 November 1908;http://www.wanneroo.wa.gov.au/Lifestyle/Heritage/History_of_Wanneroo :\\"... that Members of the Board form themselves into a committee for the purpose of forming an Agricultural Society to promote a Show in the district\\" .https://www.wannerooshow.com/society/ In the 24 April 1909 edition of the Western Mail, a report regarding the first Wanneroo Show appeared under the heading 'A Successful Display', and continued to describe events and activities that were part of the Show. Among the invited guests attending the inaugural Wanneroo Show were Sir John and Lady Forrest accompanied by several other dignitaries from the Western Australian State Government. There were cancellations in 1917–18 & 1942–45. 2020 will see a reduced show caused by COVID-19 pandemic.  The Modern Show  Each year the Wanneroo Show showcases agricultural, horticultural and other associated industries available in the Wanneroo region.  Transport and parking  The Shows increasing attraction and attendance has created new problems for the Wanneroo Showgrounds venue. Parking has become an increasing problem, with limited parking available at the Showgrounds. Car parking is available for show attendees off Ariti Avenue in the carpark outside the Showgrounds main gate, plus within the Showgrounds. Avoid parking on road verges around the Showgrounds or in areas adjacent to Yellagonga Regional Park. Parking within these locations is not permitted for show attendees, and the police will issue infringement notices to offenders. Additional parking is available within the carpark located at the rear of the City of Wanneroo Administration Building (off Dundebar Road) with over 300 bays available. Extra carpark spaces are available throughout the Wanneroo Town Centre. A free shuttle bus operates from the City of Wanneroo Administration Building carpark to the showgrounds between 6:00pm to 10:30pm on Friday and 3:00 to 10:30pm on Saturday.  Shows and performances  Stage shows, including singers, dancers, bands and a range of other performers, field events, displays, competitions and many other activities and attractions are available at the Wanneroo Show on Friday evening and all day Saturday.  Wanneroo Show Idol  The Wanneroo Show Idol talent competition has become a tradition at the Show during recent years, with many talented entrants taking part and providing brilliant entertainment.  Showbags and sideshow alley  The scope of the Show has also expanded. Although it includes traditional events – such as animal competitions – its agricultural focus has been somewhat replaced by a commercial fairground atmosphere. The show offers a wide variety of showbags and rides within sideshow alley. Margaret Cockman Pavilion during 2010 Wanneroo Show  Exhibitions  Each year the Margaret Cockman Pavilion plays host to numerous exhibits of produce and craft. There is also a children's section where a range of awards, prizes and trophies are awarded for the best exhibits in the various classes on display.  Wanneroo Agricultural Society  The Wanneroo Agricultural Society, which is the organizing body for the show has been active since 1909 and was initially created in order to assist in developing the small community of agricultural growers.

Like other cyclins, they function by binding and activating cyclin-dependent kinase. They are responsible for initiating entry into a new mitotic cell cycle at Start. As described below, Cln3 is the primary regulator of this process during normal yeast growth, with the other two G1 cyclins performing their function upon induction by Cln3. However, Cln1 and Cln2 are also directly regulated by pathways sensing extracellular conditions, including the mating pheremone pathway. Cln3 Cln3 is thought to be the main regulator linking cell growth to the cell cycle. This is because it is the most upstream regulator of Start and because, unlike other cyclins, concentration of Cln3 does not oscillate much with the cell cycle (see Cln3). Rather, Cln3 activity is thought to increase gradually throughout the cycle in response to cell growth.Morgan, David. The Cell Cycle: Principles of Cell Control. New Science Press Ltd., London, 2007; pp 32. Furthermore, Cln3 levels differ between mother and daughter cells, a difference that explains the asymmetry in cell cycle behavior between these two cell types.Di Talia et al. Daughter-Specific Transcription Factors Regulate Cell Size Control in Budding Yeast, PLoS Biology 2009 Cln3 regulation also responds to external signals, including stress signals that stop division.Gari, Eloi, Tom Volpe, and Hongyin Wang. \\"Whi3 Binds the MRNA of the G1 Cyclin CLN3 to Modulate the Cell Fate in Budding Yeast.\\" Genes and Dev (2001): 2803-808. Cln1,2 The G1 cyclins CLN1 and CLN2, upon transcriptional activation by Cln3 in mid-G1, bind Cdk1 (Cdc28) to complete progression through Start. These cyclins oscillate during the cell cycle - rise in late G1 and fall in early S phase. The primary function of G1/S cyclin-Cdk complexes is to trigger progression through Start and initiate the processes leading to DNA replication, principally by shutting down the various braking systems that suppress S-phase Cdk activity in G1. G1/S cyclins also initiate other early cell-cycles events such as duplication of the spindle pole body in yeast. The rise of G1/S cyclins is accompanied by the appearance of the S cyclins (Clb5 and Clb6 in budding yeast), which form S cyclin-Cdk complexes that are directly responsible for stimulating DNA replication. Cln1 and Cln2 are involved in regulation of the cell cycle. Cln1 is closely related to Cln2 and has overlapping functions with Cln2.\\"CLN1/YMR199W Summary.\\" Yeast Genome. 12 Dec. 1999. Web. . For instance, Cln1 and Cln2 repress the mating factor response pathway at Start. Additionally, both Cln1 and Cln2 are expressed in late G1 phase when they associate with Cdc28p to activate its kinase activity. Lastly, late G1-specific expression for both of them depends on transcription factor complexes, MBF and SBF.

Ottinger, by Charles Roscoe Savage. George Martin Ottinger (1833–1917) was a 19th-century artist, educator and actor in Utah Territory. Ottinger was born in Springfield Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and then raised in New York City. He was raised as a Quaker. At age 17 (in 1850), he joined the crew of a whaling ship. By age 20 he had circumnavigated the globe and done gold digging in California. He then studied art under Robert Weir for a time before going to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. For the next two years, Ottinger worked as a painter of miniatures in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He then moved to Kentucky where he worked as a photograph tinter as well as a fruit merchant. Ottinger returned to Pennsylvania to continue to study art in 1857. In 1858 he joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) at the urging of his mother. In 1859 he went to Richmond, Virginia where he worked as an artist.Pioneer Photpgraphers of the Far West: A Biographical Dictionary In 1861 he came to Utah Territory in the Milo Andrus Pioneer Company. He formed a partnership with the photographer Charles Roscoe Savage. There was so little demand for their work in Salt Lake City that for part of 1861 they traveled through Idaho Territory doing jobs related to photography. Ottinger also did scenery painting for the Salt Lake Theatre as well as acting. In 1863, he became principal of the Deseret Academy of Arts, which was also a joint venture with Savage. In 1861, Ottinger married Mary Jane McAllister Cullin. They only had one child before she died. In 1864, he married Phoebe Neslen. In 1867, Ottinger began painting a series on the Spanish conquest of the Americas beginning with \\"The Last of the Aztecs\\". In 1879, Ottinger went with Savage as an art missionary to learn artistic skills in Europe. On his return, he did murals in the St. George, Logan and Manti Temples. From 1876 to 1890 Ottinger was head of the Salt Lake fire department, overseeing its transformation from a volunteer to a paid organization in 1883. Ottinger taught art at the University of Deseret beginning in 1881 and continuing until 1892. He was a key influence on many later Utah artists. Ottinger was also for many years part of the Nauvoo Legion. In 1894, he was appointed Adjutant General of Utah and in this position oversaw the organization of the Utah National Guard.

It was introduced in 2010 in conjunction with Pac-Man Championship Edition DX for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Galaga Legions DX was the second game to use the brand, being released in 2011. Two other games were in production under the Namco Generations label, a Metro-Cross sequel named Aero-Cross and a remaster of Dancing Eyes, both of which were cancelled. The Namco Generations brand was conceived and lead by chief producer Hideo Yoshizawa, known as the creator of Klonoa and Mr. Driller, and assisted by Tadashi Iguchi. The idea behind the series was to recreate the healthy proximity between developers and consumers that the original Namco company had done, and to modernize and garner interest in their older franchises. Each Namco Generations game came with a digital newsletter that provided information on upcoming titles, developer interviews, and gameplay tips. Updates on the project began to slow down as the years progressed, before ultimately being shuttered in late 2012. Publications have deemed the Namco Generations project as a failure. They considered the company's unusual silence towards it and the general lack of a wider audience to have contributed to its downfall, alongside the two cancelled games being generally unimpressive and not living up to expectations. Both Pac-Man Championship Edition DX and Galaga Legions DX remain available on their respective platforms — the 2013 update to the former, renaming it to Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+, removes all instances of Namco Generations from the game. History The Namco Generations series was lead by chief producer Hideo Yoshizawa. A highly-respected game developer in Japan, he is best known as the creator of Klonoa and Mr. Driller, two widely-successful series for developer Namco. The idea for the project came from an attempt by Namco Bandai Games to recreate the healthy proximity between developers and consumers, which was a common trait of the original Namco company. Namco Bandai also saw it as an opportunity to revive and modernize many of their older intellectual properties, and to revive interest in them. The name and idea of the label is derived from the video game newsletter Namco Community Magazine NG, published in Japan throughout the 1980s and early 1990s as a way for Namco to connect with their fans and provide news on their upcoming titles. Assisting in production of the series came from Tadashi Iguchi, the designer for Pac-Man Championship Edition and Galaga Legions, both of which were successful updates of classic arcade games. When laying down the foundations for the brand, the company focused primarily on allowing consumers to interact directly with developers through digital newsletters and social media platforms, which they felt would allow for more feedback on projects. Namco Bandai Games America vice president Carlson Choi told IGN that the brand was to \\"[solidify] NAMCO BANDAI Games' commitment to provide high quality and compelling content through the digital space.\\" The company also wanted the branded games to \\"raise the bar\\" in terms of content, and to allow players to experience these older games in a brand-new way. Namco Bandai officially unveiled the Namco Generations brand on November 16, 2010. Three games were announced for release under the label: Pac-Man Championship Edition DX and Galaga Legions DX, both being updates of Iguchi's previous projects, and Aero-Cross, a modernized remake of Metro-Cross. Each game featured an option to view a special \\"NG News\\" digital newsletter, which featured developer interviews, gameplay tips, and information regarding upcoming titles. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX was released a day later on November 17 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 to critical acclaim, being listed among the greatest video game remakes of all time and as a good example on how to successfully revive a classic video game. Galaga Legions DX was published several months later on June 29, 2011 also to positive reception, specifically towards its unique gameplay and presentation. In June 2011, Namco Bandai unveiled a fourth game under the brand, a reboot of the Japan-exclusive arcade game Dancing Eyes. Due to the game's strong sexual nature and for being rather obscure, it was met with dire confusion from publications. Siliconera speculated that modern remakes of Battle City, Rally-X, and Starblade were also in the works. Updates on the project began to slow down by the end of 2011, with the company posting very little information regarding the brand and the games under production for it. In April 2012, Japanese magazine Famitsu reported that Namco Bandai decided to cancel the reboot of Dancing Eyes. In December, it was revealed that Aero-Cross, and subsequently the Namco Generations label as a whole, were also cancelled. Namco Bandai cited \\"various circumstances\\" as the reason for the project's termination. Publications have speculated the lack of interest and a wider audience caused the brand to be discontinued. The DX versions of Pac-Man Championship Edition and Galaga Legions are still available on their respective platforms, the former removing the Namco Generations newsletter entirely when it was updated in 2013. Video game publications have deemed the Namco Generations brand as a failure, saying that a general lack of a large audience and silence towards the project were factors in its downfall. JG Fletcher of Engadget blamed the cancellation of the remaining two games and a general lack of updates from Bandai Namco for the Namco Generations label being discontinued. He noted the company's unusual quiet nature towards the project in general, as well as commenting that neither of the cancelled titles lived up to the expectations of the first two games. Fletcher also felt that Dancing Eyes felt more like a tribute to an \\"amusing\\" idea rather than an attempt to truly resurrect an older IP, writing: \\"I'm not overly interested in seeing increasing amounts of polygonal skin. Rather than prurient interest in cartoon women, my fascination with Dancing Eyes is more about seeing Namco pay tribute to something that was, at best, an amusing idea, and at worst, something Namco had no sense reminding people of.\\" Siliconera showed disappointment towards the project's cancellation for being the end of an era for the company, saying: \\"With no more Namco Generations titles in the pipeline, it looks like the age of modernized Namco arcade games is over.\\" See also *ShiftyLook Notes References External links * Official website Video game publishing brands Bandai Namco Holdings Defunct brands ","title":"Namco Generations"},{"id":"30007032","text":"City Island in the Bronx, New York.

In 2010, Boyle entered a three-way Democratic Primary in the 172nd state legislative district. The other two candidates were Democratic activist Tim Kearney and school teacher and community activist, Daniel Collins. Boyle finished first, beating both of his opponents by 30-point margins. In the general election, he faced former Speaker of the House John Perzel, who was seeking re-election despite his involvement in the \\"Bonusgate\\" scandal. Boyle won the election against Perzel, capturing 53.8% to Perzel's 46.1%. It was a significant upset that bucked the strong Republican winds blowing in 2010. Boyle was sworn in as the Representative from the 172nd PA House district in January 2011. In 2012, Boyle was challenged in the Democratic Primary. His opponent was once again Daniel Collins, who was endorsed by the Philadelphia FOP and many other city unions. Boyle again defeated Collins, winning 66% of the vote to Collins' 34%.

He was born in Dhaka, Bengal Presidency. Originally named Bijoy Chandra, Manishi was the fifth child, and third son, of Purnashashi Devi and Kula Chandra Dey. He died in Kolkata at the height of his career at 56 years of age. Manishi Dey was the younger brother of Mukul Dey, a pioneering Indian artist and dry point etcher.Satyasri Ukil: \\"Mukul Dey: Pioneering Indian Graphic Artist.\\" Mukul Dey Archives, updated 16 March 2013. Their two sisters, Annapura and Rani, were accomplished in arts and crafts as well.Satyasri Ukil: \\"Manishi Dey: The Elusive Bohemian.\\" art etc. news & views, February 2012 Bengal Women, painted around 1950 by Manishi Dey  Early life and education  In 1917, at the age of eight years, Manishi Dey's father died and he was sent to the Santiniketan school Patha Bhavana, which was founded by the Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore. He seemed to dislike the preparatory conventions of Santiniketan and became mutinous. His education changed favourably when he came in contact with Abanindranath Tagore’s Bengal School of Art, the nephew of Rabindranath Tagore. He became one of the most versatile students of Abanindranath, whose other close students also included Nandalal Bose, Asit Kumar Haldar, Sarada Ukil, Mukul Dey, K. Venkatappa and Jamini Roy. These were the leading artists that spread the form and spirit of the neo-Bengal school throughout India. The political and religious developments in the Indian subcontinent were a major influence during the life of Manishi Dey. Just shortly before his birth, Bengal was partitioned into an Eastern and Western part, known as the Partition of Bengal (1905). The area was divided a second time in 1947, known as the Partition of Bengal (1947). It was only after the death of Manishi Dey that Bengal became an independent country in 1971 after the Bangladesh Liberation War. These political changes during the colonization and decolonization of India were a major influence on the education of Dey. Abanindranath Tagore promoted traditional Indian culture in his teachings, which built the foundation for the artistic works of Manishi Dey throughout his life.  1928–1947: Monochrome Period  One of the major sources of Manishi Dey's inspirations were his travels as he traversed tirelessly throughout the Indian subcontinent in search of varied and newer visual idioms. His voyages helped him becoming a finished artist in 'Indian Painting' and the water colour 'Wash' technique, an art style he used masterfully in his works. In 1928, Manishi Dey's brother Mukul decided to settle in Santiniketan and to become the first Indian principal of Government School of Arts in Calcutta, a position he held until 1943. Almost in stark contrast to his steady brother Mukul, the year 1928 marked the start of series of exhibitions all over India. At just 19 years of age, Manishi Dey held his first solo show 1928 in Calcutta where his brother was establishing himself. Many exhibitions followed, including in Nagpur (1928), Madras (1929), Bangalore (1930), Ceylon (1930), Bombay (1932), Shrinagar (1932), Arah (1934), Benares (1934), Nainital (1936), Bombay (1937), Pune (1939), Kolhapur (1940), Baroda (1942), Gwalior (1944), Delhi (1947). In 1946, his works were exhibited by the All India Fine Arts and Crafts Society (AIFACS) in New Delhi, jointly with other leading Indian artists such as Amrita Sher-Gil and Sailoz Mookherjea.International Contemporary Art Exhibition. The Council Of The All India Fine Arts & Crafts Society, New Delhi (1946) Manishi Dey interacted closely with artists like M. F. Husain, F.N. Souza, S.H. Raza, Sailoz Mookherjea and Shantanu Ukil in New Delhi during the late-1940s and early-1950s. He later became a member of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group (PAG), which was founded in 1947. PAG was one of the most influential forces on modern Indian painting, even though it was disbanded within a decade in 1956. The association with the group helped Dey to embrace cubist art and a variety of other media.Roger Baschet. \\"La peinture asiatique - Son histoire et ses merveilles.\\" Paris, Editions S.N.E.P.

New York Times (19 August 2008) His broad interests can also be seen in a collaboration with Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa, the Sri Lankan theosophist and philosopher. In 1930, Manishi Dey illustrated the title of a booklet with lecture notes by Jinarajadasa.Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa. \\"Lecture Notes with cover design by Manishi Dey.\\" Adyar: Madras, Theosophical Publishing House; 1st Edition, 1930  1948–1966: Red and Orange Period  At the end of World War II, buoyed by the newly established Indian Independence, Manishi Dey's works changed radically and got a new freshness and vitality that lacked in his early years. A main influence was the Bombay Progressive Artists Group, which enabled him to exchange with numerous leading artists of his time. In 1949 he painted a series of twenty-two moving images of non- Muslim refugees from Pakistan that captured the agony and pain of their flight. During the following years, he continued exhibitions, including in Bombay (1950), Allahabad (1953), Bangalore (1957), Ootacamund (1959), Madras (1960) and Trivandrum (1961). Through his wide prominence, he became one of the leading artists to promote traditional Indian Cultural Heritage.

Bartholomew published critical writings for more than three decades about Indian art, and he was deeply integrated in the art movement at the time of India's transition into independence.

Legacy  The works of Manishi Dey have been exhibited for many years in various Indian Museums and Galleries, such as the National Gallery of Modern Art NGMA in Mumbai, the State Lalit Kala Akademi in Luknow, Uttar Pradesh, the Delhi Art Gallery, the Allahabad Museum, the Salarjung Museum, Hyderabad, Kala Bhavan in Santiniketan and in the Samdani Art Foundation in Dhaka, one of the largest collections of Bangladeshi and Indian art worldwide.

Anime differs from American animation in the range of its audiences and themes. Anime is made for young teenagers and adults more often than are American cartoons, and often deals with more serious themes. Anime and manga incorporate a multitude of genres such as romance, action, horror, comedy, drama and cover a wide variety of topics like teen suicides, high school rivalries, and social commentary, and more subjects. Described as a gateway for many fans that takes them to a whole new culture; it is used as a way to learn about Japan. People who are avid devotees to anime in the United States affectionately refer to themselves as otaku, although in Japan the term is similar to geek, and is commonly frowned upon by society. Much like punk and goth, anime has become a subculture. Anime in the United States Anime culture in the United States began as a niche community that had a grassroots foundation built by groups of fans on the local level. Some of the earliest televised anime to air in the United States were Astro Boy, Speed Racer, and Gigantor, which gained popularity with many American audiences during the late 1960s. Anime shows that aired in the United States up until the 1980s were usually heavily altered and localized, such as Science Ninja Team Gatchaman becoming Battle of the Planets in the 1970s, and the mecha show Macross becoming Robotech in the 1980s. Takara's Diaclone and Microman mecha toylines also became the basis for the Transformers franchise in the 1980s. Small patches of isolated communities started to form around collective interest towards this new medium, which seemed reminiscent of familiar Disney visuals and Warner-Brothers narratives. One of these communities was the first anime fan club called the Cartoon/Fantasy Organization (C/FO), formed in Los Angeles, California during 1977; club actives involved monthly meets in order to watch newly aired anime. The early popularity was driven by fan-subtitled content and remained that way until much later, when inter-connected entrepreneurs from Japan and the United States saw an opportunity for business through this new medium. These business opportunities eventually led to the founding of Streamline Pictures, the United States' first anime import company in 1989, thus starting anime's widespread commercialization. Over the next dozen years, anime fans became more connected through fan-held conventions and the internet. These groups began to develop new social identities, centered around what they saw as an overall interconnected community. A subculture began to grow around the United States revolving around people who identified with the social identity “Anime fan.” The strong imagined community built by the fandom since the earliest days was both the backbone and reason for the subculture's growth. Today, early 2000s anime shows like Pokemon have become almost universally recognized media in the United States. This love for anime in the United States has even brought out well known movie stars to produce and star (their voice) in these series. Michael B. Jordan, from Black Panther & Creed fame, is starring in his own series and producing the series gen:LOCK. This has helped the genre to grow more and this has helped sales and influence many creators. Anime which is a type of Japanese art is used by some American teachers to teach Japanese culture in classrooms. It draws student interest and increases their contribution to the course as it is an entertaining form of learning. Many already have great interest in the popular culture of anime mainly due to the popularity of some such as pokeman, making its use as a teaching tool very effective. Students new to it are equally intrigued by this style of learning and generally adapt with minimum difficulty. They get to learn not just the culture of Japan to satisfy the course syllabus through anime short videos but also get to know how anime is created.  Anime fan-culture  Although anime can be considered by some as distinctly Japanese animation, some scholars and fans relate to them by their animated nature similar to the works of Walt Disney. Researchers found that this created a subset of people that distinguish themselves from the similar subculture of Japanophiles. The fandom originally proliferated using participatory media via the nature of fan- subbing anime, or the English subtitling of the original Japanese shows. The fans of anime usually referred to as Otaku have been credited as the ones who ushered anime into America. Anime serves as a channel where many are initially introduced to Japanese culture and for others the only connection with Japan they can ever have. Some avid fans however choose to go the extra mile of visiting Japan in person to experience the culture they have viewed through the world of anime in real life. This voluntary labor connects people on a global scale as fans from all over the world participate in and benefit from the collective community's work. During the 1990s, industry officials viewed fan-subtitlers as useful to the budding Anime industry, as they used fan production to see where potentially profitable markets might lie. Interviews from some of the earliest fansubbers reveal that most of them subscribed to an unspoken code that they should not make a profit from their illegal activities. However, most distributors did ask to be reimbursed for the cost of the tape and for shipping. Whether through fansubbing or professional industry-translated anime and manga, the North American distribution of anime and manga has been primarily an import business for the Japanese-produced content. However, due to the nature of its roots, the fandom is better thought of as a hybrid of American and Japanese cultural notes. It is also viewed that the current generation are using their intense love for anime, which is a cultural object to distinguish themselves from prior generations. Interview with modern-day anime fans reveal that some have no interest in its Japanese roots, merely that they enjoy the fashion or particular facets of the fandom. Scholars highlight the reason for this phenomenon as being the increasing hybrid factor of anime caused by integrating North America's popular culture characteristics. Because of the nature of imports, scholars found that the natural selectivity of anime importing by American companies cause the perception of anime to grow increasingly Western, as anime itself as a medium covers a broad range of genres. Anime would later go on to infiltrate one of the biggest cartoon networks in the United States— the fittingly named Cartoon Network. This has had a huge impact on a new generation of viewers by introducing them to anime and it's a distinctive style. If one were to watch some of the original Cartoon Network series, such as The Amazing World of Gumball and Teen Titans Go, one could see how they utilized the anime style with their animation (such as face expressions that are commonly seen in Japanese media) and even their theme song. The Amazing World of Gumball in particular has a lot of references to various animes, which while being a nice treat for those already invested in the media, will let newer views become familiarized with animesque media should they ever come by it. It has become so popular; they have even created a special time slot for new series and re- occurring popular series on their Saturday night Toonami segment. There is a rich culture that is brought out in the anime; you can watch about Japan's early history about the samurai and the bloody wars that are associated with them. Having these types of “historical” anime gives people an insight on how Japan became how it is today, granted it does have some creator interpretation on the story which might not be historically accurate. But these animes like Rurouni Kenshin gives the viewer a glimpse in the Meiji era and has plenty of action and romance as well. This has influence other American shows like Samurai Jack and Afro Samurai: Resurrection that had the voice of Samuel L. Jackson. Anime conventions Primarily the function of anime conventions in the United States is to give a place to fans of anime, manga and Japanese culture. There are a range of informational panels offered at these conventions from the basics of Japanese language and culture to cutting edge news about anime releases in Japan and the US. Anime conventions also provide performances and vendors of Japanese goods, manga, anime, figurines and Anime related merchandise. Most American anime conventions are fan operated, the increase in popularity starting in the '90s, sprung forth a long-standing list of annual conventions, such as Anime Expo, AnimeFest, Otakon, and Anime Boston, which continue to today with numbers of attendance reaching over 100,000. Anime influence and sales Through the last two decades the introduction of anime into American mainstream culture has furthered its popularity. Such famous titles as Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and most importantly Pokémon have influenced anime's appeal to young Americans.http://publications.epress.monash.edu/doi/pdf/10.2104/cc100012 \\"Anime already makes up an estimated 60% of all broadcast animation across the world.\\" \\"ICv2 estimates the size of the North American anime market at $275-300 million\\" (in retail dollars).\\" In the search for a global market for local Japanese artwork such as anime other related products, companies like Sony and Sumitomo brought their products to America. In the United States, the period referred to as \\"the golden age\\" of Japanese anime started from the middle of 1990s. Japanese Anime sales to the United States was 3.2 times higher than revenue made from the exportation of steel from Japan to the States in 2003. Many people tapped into the booming anime market and developed consumer products which centered on the current lifestyle . It served as a bridge that connected Japan and America through artwork. To compete with its Japanese competitors, many production companies in the US have adjusted their style to one inspired by anime to hold onto their viewers. An important example that has sparked much controversy in the animation world would be Avatar: The Last Airbender. A popular show on Nickelodeon, the characters have a distinct anime style, even the expressions and mannerism drawn evoke that of anime style. Teen Titans on Cartoon Network is yet another example of anime's influence on cartoons, as well as a popular comic strip turned cartoon called The Boondocks. In recent years there has also been development of Anime developed in the United States in collaboration with Japan, examples would be the Netflix original series Neo Yokio and Castlevania (TV series) based on the video game series.The globalization of Asian cultures such as anime is mainly fueled by economic gains. Unlike American cartoons where they have a lot of standalone episodes where you can jump into the series and enjoy the series, Japanese anime is more of a complex story-line that builds on the previous episodes. This is why it is so popular in the United States since people can get to know the characters better and become invested in the series and at times dress up like them for conventions or just Cosplay (costume play). The show incorporates real life in the series where the viewer can see the person attend High School, which is similar to the ones in real life. They can learn a lot about the Japanese culture which enticed people to want to learn more about the culture and even possible visit Japan. With the Anime boom and how much revenue is created from this, the United States has jumped on board to create their own shows with anime style animation. You can see this in the Avatar: The Last Air-bender as well as its sequel, The Legend of Korra.  Manga in the United States  Along with the translating and purchasing of Japanese manga in the United States, this led to the development of artists and writers in the country to develop their own manga. These were called Original English Language manga (OEL manga for short). These comics were mostly a retelling of a piece of American entertainment, such as Disney films, or perhaps a sequel to a movie, TV series, or adaptation of a video game. Manga influences and sales Calvin Reid of Publishers Weekly estimated that the \\"Total U.S. manga sales in 2007 rose about 10%, to more than $220 million, and about 1,468 titles are estimated to have been released last year.\\" With the popularity of manga on the rise graphic novel artists are beginning to adapt their style to that of manga. Manga provides diversity in the graphic novel department not seen in the American comic book industry. In a different trend celebrities are getting their hands into the manga market, rock star Courtney Love has published her own manga called Princess Ai. The production of original English language manga has started. CBR columnists Joe Casey and Matt Fraction describe the increase of manga sales in the United States, \\"Manga is the 900-pound bear in the comics shop. Inescapable, unavoidable, and impossible to ignore, the manga explosion is either going to go away—which is bad, as so many mass-market bookstores seem to be bulking up their comics supply based on manga's lead—or manga will continue to grow—also bad, as the direct market scrambles to keep up. The entire industry is being forced, month by month, little by little, into a paradigm shift not seen since the advent of the direct market in the early '80s, all thanks to these strange little books from far away.\\"  Video games  Since the early 1970s, Japan has been home to some of the most famous and influential video game companies in the world; some of the most well-known include Nintendo, Sega, Sony, Namco, Capcom, Konami and Square Enix. The games produced by the companies are extremely well known across the world, including famous arcade games such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man, and incredibly popular franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear, Street Fighter, Sonic the Hedgehog, Pokémon and Resident Evil. Numerous Japanese games have been ranked among the best games of all time, and have spawned sequels, remakes and adaptations. American cosplayers Cosplay of Rozen Maiden The term \\"cosplay\\" corresponds to an abbreviation of the English words costume play, though the term was coined in Japan the practice is not solely Japanese. The use of the term cosplay applies to any costumed role play outside of theaters. Characters are often taken from popular Japanese fiction. Popular sources that fans draw from include anime, manga, video games, comic books, and graphic novels. American cosplayers practice this form of fandom at anime conventions. However, there are a growing number of web pages and photo sites dedicated to the art of cosplaying, such as DeviantArt and Cosplay.com. Music Miyavi Japanese pop and rock music acts are also increasing in popularity amongst US listeners. Such artists include L'Arc-en-Ciel, Miyavi, T.M.Revolution, Hikaru Utada, Asian Kung-Fu Generation, Dir En Grey, Yellow Magic Orchestra, and Susumu Hirasawa. Growing in popularity by the year these performers have toured the United States at least twice playing at small venues in Boston, New York City and Los Angeles each time increasing their fan base. Japanese American artist Hikaru Utada released an English debut album in 2004, her single \\"Devil Inside\\" topped the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Airplay charts. Dir En Grey, in early 2006 started touring the US. Japanese idols, like Morning Musume, AKB48 and S/mileage are now becoming known in the US thanks to the internet. In 2009, Morning Musume performed at Anime Expo and in 2010 AKB48 played there. Also in 2010, influential metal band X Japan performed their first US tour, selling out most shows. In April 2011, Berryz Kobo played at an anime convention in Washington. Japanese manga art has also influenced American music artists and singers, such as Pharrell Williams whose music video It Girl (Pharrell Williams song) contains a wide array of anime style artwork. Even the electronic musicians Daft Punk have used anime artwork in several of their music videos such as Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, One More Time (Daft Punk song) and Something About Us (Daft Punk song). Live- action film and television The following Japanese live-action film and television genres have also had a significant influence on American popular culture: *Jidaigeki (Japanese historical fiction) Samurai cinema (chanbara) examples include Akira Kurosawa films such as Seven Samurai, The Hidden Fortress and Yojimbo Ninja fiction see Ninjas in popular culture *Tokusatsu (Japanese science fiction) Kaiju (monster films) examples include Godzilla, Gamera and Ultraman Sentai (superhero shows) examples include the Ultraman, Super Sentai (Power Rangers) and Metal Hero (VR Troopers) franchises *J-drama examples include manga adaptations such as Great Teacher Onizuka, Hana Yori Dango and Nodame Cantabile *J-horror examples include the Ring and Grudge franchises Martial arts Popular Japanese martial arts include judo, ju- jitsu, aikido, and Okinawan martial arts such as karate.

It was first discovered in 1988 by Yanagisawa and team and belongs to a family of three endothelin peptide isoforms (ET-1, ET-2, ET-3), which constrict blood vessels. ET-2 is encoded by genes on separate chromosomes to its isoforms and is mainly produced in vascular endothelial cells of the kidney, placenta, uterus, heart, central nervous system and intestine. It becomes present in the blood of animals and humans at levels ranging from 0.3pg/ml to 3pg/ml. ET-2 acts by binding to two different G-protein coupled receptors (GCPRs), the endothelin A receptor (EDNRA) and the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB).  Function  As ET-2 has a very similar homology to ET-1, differing only in two amino acids (with Trp6 and Leu7 instead of Leu6 and Met7) it was often assumed that the two endothelins were similar in synthetic pathway and mechanism of action. As ET-1 is abundant in the body while ET-2 is almost undetectable, ET-1 was more convenient to research, this assumption has meant ET-2 is relatively under-researched. Equally, limited studies have been conducted using VIC, a vasoactive intestinal peptide and the peptide equivalent to ET-2 in mice. However, recent research evidence suggests a distinct roles and features of ET-2. Unlike the other endothelins, ET-2 knockout mice (with the EDN2 gene globally removed from their genetic code) are retarded in growth, hypoglycemic, hypothermic and have ketonemia, resulting in early mortality. These differences between ET-1 and ET-2 may be attributed to differing gene expression and the synthesis of different peptides by endothelin converting enzymes (ECEs). ET-2 is a potent vasoconstrictor and has been implicated in ovarian physiology, as well as diseases relating to the heart, immunology, and cancers.  Clinical significance   Ovarian follicle rupture  Ovulation occurs at around day 14 of the human menstrual cycle and refers to the release of an egg, characterised by the rupture of a preovulatory ovarian follicle. This process is driven changes in oestrogen-regulated feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to a surge of Luteinising Hormone which drives follicular rupture. There is a complex molecular dialogue for ovulation which involves the coordinated expression of many key proteins, including ET-2. Within the follicle, ET-2 expression is confined to a group of steroid-producing stromal cells called granulosa cells, where its production peaks transiently at the final stages before ovulation (periovulatory stage). In the mouse, there is a surge of ET-2 around two hours prior to ovulation, this is thought to act as one of the driving forces for follicular rupture. Much of our current understanding of ET-2 and its role during ovulation comes from rodent model experiments. However, there are some interspecies discrepancies, with stark differences identified between the mouse and bovine ovary. The mechanisms underlying ET-2-induced follicle rupture are debated, with most theories suggesting a mechanical contraction pathway. ET-2 is believed to act on the follicle by binding to and stimulating EDNRA, which is expressed constitutively on the external layer of theca cells (another type of steroid-producing stromal cell). This causes smooth muscle cells surrounding the ovary to contract. This smooth muscle layer encapsulates the ovary but is absent at the site where the oocyte is expelled, creating a region of low surface tension which weakens the follicle wall and promotes the release of an egg. ET-2 also binds to and activates EDNRB, which is constitutively expressed by granulosa cells and theca interna. There is controversy surrounding the role of ET-2 signalling at this receptor. Some studies suggest that EDNRB activation by ET-2 regulates follicular rupture by antagonising effects of EDNRA stimulation. Alternatively, EDNRB may propel follicular rupture by inducing nitric oxide signalling. This results in local vasodilation, contributing to the rise in follicular fluid pressure seen in the periovulatory phase.  Cardiovascular system  ET-2, like ET-1, has a role in modulating vascular tone. This can have implications for blood pressure control. A specific EDN2 gene polymorphism has been correlated with essential hypertension and alternative studies have shown associations between certain rare ET-2 polymorphisms and lower diastolic blood pressures. The ET-2 gene has been shown to co-segregate with blood pressure in rodent studies; a potential reason for the link. However, transgenic rats expressing the human ET-2 gene under the control of the human endothelin promotor are normotensive (blood pressure in normal range), despite these studies suggesting that overexpression of ET-2 results in glomerulosclerosis. This suggests that further investigation into the role of ET-2 in blood pressure is warranted. As a strong positive inotrope, endothelin-2 has an impact on the human myocardium and for this reason, endothelin-2 antagonists have been shown to improve exercise tolerance and inhibit clinical deterioration in pulmonary hypertension. ET-2 demonstrates a positive chronotropic and proarrhythmic effects. A study showed a significant association of a specific polymorphism of the EDN2 gene with increased incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Overall, the evidence suggests that ET-2 could modulate vascular tone, tissue morphology and remodelling.  Breast tumour cell invasion  Since reports of increased ET-2 expression in human breast cancer (2002), there has been growing interest in ET-2 within cancer pathogenesis. There is increased expression of the ‘endothelin axis’ consisting of 21 amino acid peptides (ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3), two GPCRs and two activating peptidases in invasive breast cancer. This increased expression is not seen in non-invasive tissue. This is further supported by observations from patient biopsies, endothelin expression is associated specifically with regions of the tumour that are invasive and is more common in whole tumours with lymphovascular invasion (i.e. the invasion of cancer cells into the lymphatic system). In vitro, when breast tumour cell lines with endothelins are stimulated, the phenotype becomes invasive. Invasion through an artificial membrane can be stimulated, particularly when co-cultured in the presence of macrophages. The association between endothelins, poor prognosis and invasion suggests the endothelin axis is an interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of invasive breast cancer. The breast tumour microenvironment is particularly hypoxic which allows it to modulate the expression of numerous ‘pro-tumour’ genes including endothelins. This hypoxic environment can be replicated in vitro, resulting in increased expression of ET-2 by breast tumour cells. This increased ET-2 expression provides the tumour with autocrine protection from hypoxia-associated apoptosis allowing growth of the tumour. Further research using mice with breast tumours in hypoxic conditions showed that the addition of ET-2 increased the survival of tumour cells suggesting the upregulation of ET-2 in hypoxic tumours may explain the increased invasive potential and worse prognosis than their well oxygenated counterparts.

We're simply saying, 'We know what you're up against and we support you.'\\" The FTA Show's official statement of purpose was: The show first travelled around the continental U.S. performing for soldiers, sailors and marines at various military bases, including Fort Bragg, Fort Ord and the naval and marines bases in San Diego before departing for Hawaii and Asian U.S. bases The film The documentary begins with a message in white letters against a black screen which states that it \\"was made in association with the servicewomen and men stationed on the United States bases of the Pacific Rim\\". The filmmakers want the viewer to know the film, and tour it documents, were done with GIs and they want the viewer to see the tour from a GIs point of view. The opening message then states the film is also done with the GIs friends \\"whose lands they presently occupy.\\" So, even more unusually, the filmmakers want the viewer to watch from the perspective of the people in the countries occupied by U.S. military bases. As the film unfolds we see the both the FTA Tour itself and we see interviews with GIs and we see footage and interviews with their \\"friends\\", the local people in the countries visited. One author described this later element of the film as \\"explicit solidarity with the fight for economic and political rights by the ordinary peoples of the lands it visits.\\" For example, there is a sequence in Olongapo City, Philippines where the U.S. Naval Base at Subic Bay was located. There is footage of Filipino pro-democracy demonstrators \\"protesting against the U.S. government's desire to keep the Philippines in a perpetually 'semi-feudal' state. One demonstrator explicitly acknowledges a natural 'identity of interests' between Filipinos and the American GI against American imperialism.\\" These demonstration scenes are interspersed with a \\"vaudeville skit on the FTA stage in which Jane Fonda and Holly Near dance la Folies Bergre to the tune of Bomb Another City Today! GIs speak out To help the viewer understand the perspective of rank-and-file soldiers, the filmmakers interview active duty GIs. In fact, the film only focuses about half it's time on the tour itself, the rest is taken up with GI interviews and footage of local people and events. We see a marine explaining he is against the war and talking about writing home to tell his mother; \\"how can you write your mother and tell her?\\" he asks, but when he decides to do it he is pleasantly surprised to hear that \\"she fully understood and she was happy that I felt that way\\". A black GI complains that things are tough at home and asks \\"so why should we go over there and put our lives down?\\" Then a woman in the Air Force describes why she enlisted right after high school; \\"no job, no money... 'the Air Force came along and there I was.'\\" We also see several black marines talk about the racism in the military and at home and about \\"their reluctance to fight in Vietnam that arises from their sense of commonality with the Vietnamese as oppressed nonwhite peoples.\\" The FTA Song FTA was a common troupe expression as shown in this button from the GI group Movement for a Democratic Military Several of the tour's skits are interspersed with footage of the cast singing the show's theme song, The Lifer's Song (or The FTA Song). The song is an irreverent ditty written around the common troop expression FTA, which really meant \\"Fuck The Army\\" and which, in turn, was a play on the Army recruitment slogan \\"Fun, Travel and Adventure\\". During the Vietnam War, FTA was often scrawled on the side of walls and scratched onto bathroom stalls. The song tells the story of a pro-military \\"lifer\\" who is trying to figure out what FTA means. He hears it in \\"Leesville\\", \\"Waynesville\\", \\"Fayetteville\\", and \\"a Texas paradise called Killeen\\" - all towns with major military bases. Just \\"three little words\\" he complains, \\"but I can't find out what they mean.\\" Is it \\"Future Teachers of American\\", \\"Free The Antarcticans\\", \\"Free The Army?\\" Help me, the singers appeal to the audience. On the tour, when the troupe came to the last line they always hesitated, encouraging the audience to supply the real meaning of FTA, which the GIs invariably did with a thundering \\"FUCK the Army\\". \\"Extra letters and words were added as needed, depending upon the composition of the audience. FTA would become 'FTAF' or 'FTN,' or 'FTM' or all four at once, spelled out in a triumphant, expletive-filled list.\\" In the film we see \\"the singers exaggeratedly trying to contain themselves\\" as they reach the first word in the last line. \\"[I]t seems the singers want the audience to understand that they really want to say 'Fuck the Army,' but they perform the pretense that they can’t quite or won’t, for whatever reason, bring themselves to do it the first time through. The second time, as they are making the long, drawn-out beginning of the word, Len Chandler turns and says quietly (but the mic picks it up) 'say it!' and they do..., they shout 'Fuck the Army.'\\" Reaching out to women GIs During the later parts of the tour, which are those included in the film, new material was added into the show addressing other issues swirling in the political currents of the early 1970s, including women's issues, particularly as they confronted women in the military. One skit has a clearly pregnant soldier's wife being told by the military doctor to \\"go home and take two APCs [an aspirin compound] and come back when the swelling goes down.\\" Another example is the song Tired of Bastards Fucking Over Me written by Beverley Grant and sung by Fonda, Near, Martinson and Donegan. Sung to \\"an audience composed in large part of visiting enlisted women in the USAF\\", it describes experiences of everyday sexism from a woman's point of view, \\"with each brief narrative punctuated by a chorus\\": A professor of film described this combining of women's issues with GI antiwar sentiment, as positing \\"a total continuity...between a woman's right to control her body and that of a young male GI to refuse to give his body in a futile war.\\" When these feminist elements were combined with the multi-racial cast and anti- racist message, the tour and film \\"stood in sharp contrast to Bob Hope’s show. Whereas Hope made racist jokes, FTA embraced racial equality and took seriously the grievances of non-whites. While Hope joked about sexual assault and unapologetically objectified the women in his cast, FTA endorsed women’s liberation and featured women as full participants in the show without forcing them to don sexually provocative clothing.\\" Skits Alaimo as the Sargent and Sutherland as the Private Various sketches or skits from the show are shown throughout the film. Many of them reflected the common dislike of enlisted soldiers for their officers and non-commissioned officers, which became particularly sharp during the Vietnam War. In one sketch a Sergeant (played by Michael Alaimo) tells a soldier, \\"I think I’m gonna get me a watchdog.\\" \\"What do you need a watchdog for, Sarge?\\" replies the GI, \\"You’re surrounded by two hundred armed men.\\" “That’s why I’m gonna get me a watchdog,\\" says the Sarge. In Okinawa, we see a performance by a group of Okinawan musicians who have joined the show. The lyrics of their songs (shown in subtitles) \\"are sharply critical of U.S. presence on the island. The singers stand straight at the microphones, their eyes closed. At the song’s conclusion the audience instantly roars with applause.\\" Pro-Vietnam War hecklers There is a particularly interesting confrontation shown in the film that occurred the night they performed just outside Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan. There was \\"an audience of nearly 1,400 included some 500 GIs.\\" Some pro-Vietnam War hecklers tried to disrupt the show and were quoted as saying \\"they liked to go to Vietnam to kill people because they made $65 extra a month in combat pay.\\" In the film, you can see other members of the audience begin to heckle the hecklers and then Donald Sutherland speaks to the crowd, \\"If you want them to leave, would you tell them?\\" The audience erupted in \\"noisy agreement\\" while a number of sailors from the USS Oklahoma City \\"slowly but surely, confidently but peacefully\\" escort the hecklers out of the auditorium while Len Chandler leads the crowd in shouting “Out! Out! Out!” There has been some speculation that the pro-war hecklers were \\"undercover agents and provocateurs\\", which was not an uncommon tactic used by police agencies during the Vietnam War era, but no proof has emerged either way. Donald Sutherland reads Johnny Got His Gun The film ends with Donald Sutherland reading from Dalton Trumbo’s 1938 novel Johnny Got His Gun: Film's release and controversy F.T.A. was released in July 1972, \\"within days of Fonda’s infamous visit to Hanoi\\", and seems to have suffered from the political fallout of Fonda's travels. The film \\"was in theatres barely a week before it was pulled from circulation by its distributor, American International Pictures.\\" Even more, \\"[m]ost copies were destroyed\\", which seems to indicate an attempt to prevent any future for the film. Many have suspected the film's disappearance \\"was the result of government intervention.\\" According to Parker, the film's director, \\"the film disappeared after Sam Arkoff, head of AIP, received a call from the White House.\\" David Zeiger, who has been involved in resurrecting the original film, has been quoted as saying he believes Parker. \\"There's no proof, but I can't think of another reasonable explanation for Sam Arkoff, a man who knew how to wring every penny out of a film, yanking one starring Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland from theaters at a big loss (and, apparently, destroying all of the prints, since none were ever found).\\" Remastering and release In 2009, David Zeiger, the director of Sir! No Sir!, a film about the GI resistance to the Vietnam War, finished resurrecting the original F.T.A. film. It was shown publicly in Los Angeles in early 2009 at the American Cinematheque with a panel that included two of the original performers in the show. It was also shown at the IFC Center in New York City and had its broadcast premiere on the Sundance Channel on February 23, 2009. Footage from the film and discussion of the FTA Show is included in Zeiger's 2005 documentary film Sir! No Sir!. Reception \\"According to a Washington Post reviewer who attended a screening of the film, the black humor in F.T.A. had Vietnam veterans 'laughing harder than anyone.'\\" Dr. Mark Shiel, Lecturer in Film Studies at King's College London, commented in a 2007 essay that the film \\"brought together elements of the Old and New Lefts, radical politics and Hollywood celebrity, in an exceptional, and exceptionally powerful, way.\\" The NY Times reviewer said the show itself \\"must have been very funny\\", but felt \\"as presented in the movie, most of the show doesn't seem very funny\\". He did describe, however, a \\"striking sequence\\" when \\"an anti-American guerrilla theater pageant in the Philippines...momentarily turns revolutionary passion into a romantic gesture of extraordinary beauty.\\" He also praises the \\"lovely ballad singing of Rita Martinson.\\" A Los Angeles Times reviewer, after viewing the 2009 remastered version, described the show as a \\"fascinating documentary\\" that \\"mixes protest songs with broad and bawdy skits, taking potshots at military chauvinism and top-brass privilege.\\" He concluded, \\"what it lacks in finesse, it makes up for with a raucous energy.\\" The Harvard Crimson described the film as \\"bouncing through satiric routines on the bungling authority that got us involved in Vietnam.\\" The reviewer also felt the \\"routines and the film anticipate that a certain set of opinions will be held by the audience, that the young military people and the young movie-goer will share its anti- military, anti-Vietnam [War] position.\\" Michael Atkinson, writing on IFC.com, called the film \\"a document of disarming anti-authoritarian nerve\\" and says \\"the spirit of the thing is infectious and energizing\\". He also notes that the \\"film is, in any case, remarkable for how little it is known and how rarely it’s been seen\\".

Before her appointment at Yale, she served as the assistant professor of Hebrew studies, Department of Near Eastern Studies, at Princeton University, where she completed her first book Between the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds (1997) based on her PhD work. Her first monograph was awarded the Solo Baron prize from the American Academy for Jewish Research. Her second monograph, Gentile Impurities and Jewish Identities (2006), was a finalist for the National Jewish Book award, and her third monograph, What's Divine about Divine Law? Early Perspectives, has won three prestigious awards. From 2017-2019, Hayes served as President of the Association for Jewish Studies.  Personal life  Hayes was born to Australian parents living in the United States. According to Hayes, the family moved frequently in her early years before her parents chose to return to Australia, taking their 11-year-old daughter back with them. She credits her parents' interest in philosophy, religion, literature, and world culture as instrumental in shaping her own intellectual passions, including her eventual study of Jewish history, culture, and religion. Upon finishing high school, Hayes returned to the United States to study at Harvard University. There, Hayes relates that she stumbled into the Harvard University Hillel and began to teach herself to read Hebrew. She interrupted her undergraduate studies in 1982 and worked as a volunteer on an Israeli Kibbutz. She entered graduate school in 1986, and spent the 1987-88 academic year studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In 1988 she married Michael Della Rocca (now a professor of Philosophy at Yale University) and has two sons. She completed her doctorate in 1993 and became Assistant Professor of Hebrew Studies in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at Princeton University. In 1996, she became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at Yale University where she gained tenure in 2002. Hayes was awarded a New Directions Fellowship from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 2003 that enabled her to pursue studies in legal history and legal theory. She has been a visiting professor at the Tel Aviv University Faculty of Law (2015), a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School (2018), and a fellow at the Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies (2018). Since 2015, she has been a Senior Faculty Fellow at the Shalom Harman Institute of North America. Education Hayes attended Harvard University and received her B.A. summa cum laude in the Study of Religion in 1984. She continued her education at the University of California, Berkeley, (including an exchange year at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem) earning first an M.A. in 1988, and her PhD in 1993. Her PhD dissertation, \\"Between the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds: Accounting for Halakhic difference in selected Sugyot from tractate Avodah Zarah\\" sought to compare and account for halakhic differences between the two Talmuds.  Scholarship  Hayes' scholarship addresses a wide range of historical, literary, legal, and philosophical topics in biblical and rabbinic literature. Her second book, Gentile Impurities and Jewish Identities: Intermarriage and Conversion from the Bible to the Talmud, is a work of cultural history. It examines the diverse ways in which biblical, Second Temple, and rabbinic sources employ purity language to construct Jewish identity and to inscribe and police community boundaries with varying degrees of porousness. Her most recent book, What's Divine about Divine Law? Early Perspectives, traces two radically distinct conceptions of divine law – Greco- Roman natural law grounded in reason and biblical law grounded in divine being's will  that emerged in antiquity and confronted one another in the Hellenistic period. According to Hayes, their confrontation created a cognitive dissonance for those who felt compelled to negotiate the claims of both traditions. In a series of interconnected close readings, Hayes charts the creative and conflicting responses to this cognitive dissonance. Second Temple and Hellenistic Jewish authors sought to minimize the distance between classical and biblical understandings of divine law by attributing to the Torah the qualities deemed definitive of the divine natural law by the Stoic tradition: truth, rationality, universality, and immutability. By contrast, Paul sought to widen the gap, representing the Torah of Moses as possessing none of the traits of the Hellenistic divine/natural law and all of the traits of conventional positive law. Hayes argues that a third path was taken by the talmudic rabbis, whose unique and surprising construction of divine law resisted the Hellenistic and Pauline conceptions that would come to dominate the Christianized west. In 2006, Hayes' Introduction to Hebrew Bible course was selected by Yale as a pilot for the university's Open Courses online platform allowing anyone around the world to access course materials and recordings of the lectures. In addition to publishing numerous books and publications, Hayes has also dedicated time to institutions supporting Jewish Studies research and scholarship. From 2012 to 2016, Hayes served as the co- editor of the Association of Jewish Studies Review. In 2017, she was elected president of the Association for Jewish Studies.

Its name derives from the Lilies (\\"giglio\\") depicted on the reverse entwined around a cross. The coin weighed 4 grams. This type of coin was widely copied in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially by the Turks, such as the Emir of Saruhan.European and Islamic trade in the early Ottoman state by Kate Fleet p.15Catalogue of the Byzantine Coins by Dumbarton Oaks, Alfred Raymond Bellinger, Philip Grierson, Whittemore Collection (Fogg Art Museum) p.33 Background Charles I of Anjou, the younger brother of Louis IX of France, left his son the Kingdom of Naples and a coinage system with both gold coins and groschen size silver coins. Charles II of Anjou initially continued this coinage, but he took office in a period of financial difficulty throughout Europe and circumstances forced him to replace it. Changes in the relative market prices of gold and silver, widespread counterfeiting and clipping (i.e. shaving metal from the edge of precious metal coins), and prevalent rumors that the mint was debasing the coinage prevented his silver coins from circulating. Attempts to fix the problem with legislation in 1293, 1298 and 1301 only made matters worse. Seeing his coins exported, Charles II of Anjou made a complete change in 1303. He stopped minting gold coins entirely, and replaced his father's silver saluto d’argento with a heavier silver coin officially called a carlino but widely known as a gigliato. Medieval European Coinage, Volume 14, South Italy, Sicily, Sardinia. Philip Grierson and Lucia Travaini, page 219. Gigliati in Naples Charles II of Anjou's silver gigliato was the same diameter as the dominant silver coin of its time, the French gros tournois, or as the grosso rinforzato being struck by the Roman Senate, i.e. 24 m.m.. It contained 4.01 grams of .929 fine silver, or 3.73 grams of pure silver. Its types were more typical of French gold coins, especially Philip the Fair's petit royal d’or, than Italian silver coins.Medieval European Coinage, Volume 14, South Italy, Sicily, Sardinia. Philip Grierson and Lucia Travaini, page 220. The obverse shows the king in majestatum, i.e. seated on his throne. In this case the throne had lions on either side and the king holds a scepter and an orb topped with a cross. The legend, KAROL SCD DEI GRA IERL ET SICIL REX, i.e. Charles the second king of Jerusalem and Sicily, requires a bit of explaining. Charles I expanded his empire in to the Balkans and purchased a claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1277, even though Christians had not ruled that city since the Sultan Saladin drove them out in 1187. By 1303, the last remnant of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Acre, was lost too, but the title was still prestigious. Moreover, the island of Sicily, which Charles I of Anjou had conquered in 1266, had been lost in a 1282 revolt called the Sicilian Vespers. Charles II of Anjou himself was captured in the ensuing war and had renounced his claims to Sicily as a condition of his release in 1288. His ally the pope immediately released him from this promise, and the 1302 Peace of Caltabellotta justified his use of the title King of Sicily for what is now more accurately called Naples, so the coin legend was appropriate.Charles I and Charles II, Encyclopædia Britannica, pages II.755 and II.756 of the 1982 edition The reverse shows a cross with fleur-de-lis on the ends of its arms and more fleur-de-lis in its angles. This profusion of lilies gave the coin its nickname, gigliato, after the Provençal name for them, gillat. The legend, HONOR REGIS IVDICIVM DILIGIT, i.e. the honor of the king loves judgment, is from Psalm 99.4 and was appropriate to the pious Charles II. The same legend was used again much later on coins of James VI of Scotland.Coin Mottos and Their Translations, Stuart Mosher Robert the Wise Charles II of Anjou's third son and successor, Robert the Wise became a leader of the Guelph, i.e. pro-papal, party in Italy. He paid for his campaigns against the Ghibelline, i.e. pro-imperial, party by minting vast numbers of gigliati.Coins in History, John Porteous, page 110 In the reign of Ladislaus the Magnanimous (1386-1414), however, a shortage of silver throughout Western Europe forced him to downscale his coinage to half and quarter gigliati with the same designs.Monete e Zecche Medievali Italiane, Elio Biaggi, coins 1652 and 1653 The gigliati was such a success that it outlasted the Angevin dynasty. After the revolt of 1285 separated them for Naples, Sicily had adopted its own coin denominations and used them for anti- Angevin propaganda. When Alfonso V of Aragon reunited Naples and Sicily in 1442, he adopted the gigliato of his now conquered arch-enemy. If this amounted to admitting that the Neapolitans had created a superior coinage, a change in the reverse design left no doubt which side had prevailed. All the fleur-de-lis which gave the coin its nickname, and which were the symbol of France, gave way to a coat-of-arms which, in the well understood heraldic symbolism of the day, showed that Aragon had taken over Angevin Naples and its claim to Jerusalem.Coins in History, John Porteous, page 112 Spread of the Gigliato The marriage of Charles I of Anjou and the countess of Provence in 1246 had given his dynasty control of that French region. In 1330, Robert the Wise began striking gigliati there. At the time, Provence hosted the Avignon Papacy and Pope John XXII began striking a version of the gigliato at Avignon.The Silver Coins of Medieval France, James Roberts, page 361 The pope was still seated on a lion throne, but now wearing a mitre and holding a cross. The cross on the reverse still had fleur-de-les on its arms but none in its angles. Pope Clement VI replaced the cross in the reverse with the crossed keys insignia of the papacy and Pope Urban V moved both the papacy and these coins to Rome. They became such an important part of papal coinage that even the Antipope John XXIII struck them.Papal Coins, Allen Berman, coins 176, 182, 196, and 256 Silver gigliato of Hélion de Villeneuve, Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes, 1319-1346. Other mints in Provence, especially those along the Rhône river imitated the gigliatoThe Silver Coins of Medieval France, James Roberts, coins 6863 to 6867 but one native of Provence took them farther afield. Hélion de Villeneuve became grand master of the Knights Hospitaller and found that its Greek influenced coinage did not facilitate trade. He replaced it with coins having the weight standard of the gigliato, and a reverse type clearly derived from it, but with an obverse based on the seal of his order. Although Neapolitan gigliati were more common in the eastern Mediterranean, it appears that he copied the issues from Provence.Coins in History, John Porteous, page 110 The marriage of Charles II of Anjou to the daughter of Stephen V of Hungary gave his grandson Charles Robert a claim that country and he became king in 1308. He started striking large silver coins there, copying the obverse type of the giglatio but using the reverse for heraldry which symbolized his descent from both Stephen V of Hungary and Charles II of Anjou.Coins in History, John Porteous, page 111 Silver gigliato of Sarukhan, Bey of Magnesia, 1313-1348, ruler of Lydia, western Turkey. Expansion of the Angevin Empire was not the only factor in the spread of the gigliato. The bankers who administered their Neapolitan mints also did business in the Levant and hoards show that many gigliati made their way there.Medieval European Coinage, Volume 14, South Italy, Sicily, Sardinia. Philip Grierson and Lucia Travaini, page 214. And gigliati were imitated in the eastern Mediterranean too. Some imitations such as the one shown are clearly intended to be mistaken for the originals. Others, like the ones struck at Chios used distinctive designs.Coins in History, John Porteous, page 110 References Obsolete Italian currencies Silver coins Coins of Italy History of Naples Medieval Italy Anatolian beyliks Medieval currencies ","title":"Gigliato"},{"id":"30007574","title":"Give Me a Ring Sometime (song)"},{"id":"30007579","title":"1957 Philippine House of Representatives elections"},{"id":"30007640","text":"Clarence LeRoy Vaughn (September 4, 1911 – March 1, 1937) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball.

Bolton collaborated with Robert Dale Owen during Indiana's 1850–1851 constitutional convention to include the recognition of women's property rights in the revised state constitution of 1851. Bolton was little known outside of Indiana, and her writings have been mostly forgotten. \\"Paddle Your Own Canoe\\" (1850), her most famous poem, and \\"Indiana,\\" a poetic tribute to her longtime home, are among her best-known poems. Early life and education Sarah Tittle Barrett was born on December 18, 1814, in Newport Barracks, Kentucky. She was one of Esther (Pendleton) and Jonathan Belcher Barrett's six children. Sarah was named for her paternal grandmother, Sarah (Tuttle) Barrett. Lemuel Barrett, her paternal grandfather, served in the Maryland militia during the American Revolutionary War. James Pendleton, her maternal grandfather, was a cousin of President James Madison.Dowling, pp. 2, 5.Cottman, p. 182. The Barrett family moved to Indiana when Sarah was a child around the age of three and settled on a farmstead in an area that was mostly wilderness in Jennings County, near present-day Vernon, Indiana. In 1823, when Sarah was around the age of nine, her father moved the family from their isolated farm to Madison, Indiana, so that the children could attend local schools. Sarah Barrett learned to read and write while attending school in Madison. She also began to write poetry at an early age. At the age of thirteen her first published poem appeared in the Madison Banner. As a young woman she became a regular contributor of poems to newspapers in Madison, Indiana, and Cincinnati, Ohio. Her poems attracted the attention of Nathaniel Bolton (July 25, 1803 – November 26, 1858), who was also coeditor of the Indianapolis Gazette, the first newspaper published in Indianapolis, Indiana.Dowling, p. 11. Marriage and family Sarah Barrett married Nathaniel Bolton on October 15, 1831. The couple immediately moved to Indianapolis, where Sarah gained a wide reputation as a poet while her husband was editor at the Indianapolis Democrat and State Gazette, the new name of the Indianapolis Gazette. The Boltons also purchased a farm at Mount Jackson, which was a short distance west of Indianapolis along the National Road (present-day West Washington Street). When financial difficulties forced the Boltons to return to the farm on a full-time basis, they operated their farmhouse as a public tavern. It soon became a gathering place and social hub for state legislators and others.Gugin and St. Clair, eds., pp. 26–27. The Boltons were the parents of two children, Sarah Adah \\"Sally\\" and James Pendleton.James, James, and Boyer, eds., pp. 191–92. In addition to running the tavern with her husband and caring for the family, she continued to write poetry. In 1845 the Boltons sold their farm to the State of Indiana as the site for what became known as the Indiana Hospital for the Insane, later renamed Central State Hospital.Bodenhamer and Barrows, pp. 334–35, 397–98.http://www.imhm.org/ From 1851 to 1854 Nathaniel Bolton served as state librarian, and in 1854 he became clerk of a U.S. Senate committee in Washington, D.C. In 1855 President Franklin Pierce appointed him as U.S. Consul to Geneva, Switzerland. Sarah Bolton accompanied her husband to Europe. While Nathaniel conducted diplomatic duties in Switzerland Sarah traveled with their daughter. Ill health forced Nathaniel to resign after two years of diplomatice service and the family . During this time Sarah acted as a correspondent for the Cincinnati Commercial. they returned to Indianapolis in 1858. He died a few months after their return to Indiana.Dowling, pp. 20–23, 33. Following the death of her daughter, Bolton helped care for her young grandson, Bolton Smith, who received his early education in Switzerland. After Bolton Smith's return to the United States, he became a lawyer and investment banker, as well as active at the national level with the Boy Scouts of America in Washington, D.C. The early deaths of her daughter and first husband inspired Bolton's poem, \\"Two Graves.\\"Dowling, pp. 36, 154. On September 15, 1863, five years after the death of her first husband, Sarah Bolton married Judge Addison Reese, of Canton, Missouri. The couple lived in Missouri for two years, but she found the climate unhealthy and returned to Indianapolis. Afterward, she only used the surname of Reese for business and legal matters, retaining the surname of Bolton for other purposes. After the failure of her second marriage, Bolton traveled in Europe for several years, including two years in residence at Dresden, Germany, before returning to Indiana, where she spent the remaining years of her life.Dowling, p. 40. Career During her first marriage Sarah Bolton continued to write poetry in addition to running the family's household and helping in her husband's publishing office.Cottman, p. 183. After the sale of the family farm at Mount Jackson in 1845 and Nathaniel Bolton's appointment as state librarian in 1851, the Boltons returned to Indianapolis, where Sarah continued to write poetry and became an active supporter of women's property rights. Nathaniel also became involved in civic and government affairs. Sarah Bolton became a well-known poet in Indiana, eventually becoming the state's unofficial poet laureate. However, despite the acclaim that Bolton received in her home state, she was not widely known elsewhere. Bolton's poems appeared in newspapers and periodicals such as Harper's Weekly, but her literary work was not always attributed to her by name.Cottman, pp. 184–85. Over the years Bolton's writings were mostly forgotten. Two of her best-known poems are \\"Indiana,\\" a poetic tribute to her longtime home, and \\"Paddle Your Own Canoe.\\" Bolton typically received little to no compensation for her work, although the Cincinnati Commercial once paid $15 for three of her poems. Several collections of her poetry were also published. Poems (New York, 1865) was Bolton's first collection of poetry, followed by The Life and Poems of Sarah T. Bolton (Indianapolis, 1880), and Songs of a Life-Time (Indianapolis, 1892). Paddle Your Own Canoe, and Other Poems, published posthumously in 1897, is largely a reprint of Songs, with the addition of a few poems. Bolton's poem, \\"Paddle Your Own Canoe,\\" her most famous poem, was later set to music. \\"I Cannot Call Her Mother\\" and \\"A Reply to Katy Darling\\" are among her other musical compositions. As with her other writing, Bolton received little if any compensation for her songs, even after the sheet music was published and sold. In addition to writing poetry and composing music, Bolton was active in efforts to secure property rights for women in Indiana. Although Robert Dale Owen is credited with securing passage of women's property rights, Bolton collaborated with him in efforts to lobby support from members of the Indiana General Assembly. She also lobbied delegates attending the state's constitutional convention in 1851 in Indianapolis. In an 1851 letter to Bolton, Owen congratulated her efforts to the cause, which included writing numerous articles and letters for Indiana newspapers in support of women's property rights. While her husband served as U.S. consul to Geneva, Switzerland, in the mid-1850s she served as hostess for consul visitors and as a correspondent for the Cincinnati Commercial. After her return to Indiana, she continued to pursue her interests in social reform and a career as a poet. Later years In 1871 Bolton purchased \\"Beech Bank,\\" a farm about southeast of Indianapolis on the outskirts of present-day Beech Grove, Indiana. Bolton later returned to Indianapolis, where she continued to write poetry until her death in 1893. Death and legacy Bolton's gravestone at the Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis. Bolton died in Indianapolis, Indiana, on August 4, 1893. She is buried at Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery beside the remains of her first husband, Nathaniel Bolton. A simple inscription and epitaph marks her grave: \\"Sarah T. Bolton, 1814–1893, The first singer in a new land.\\" Bolton was considered Indiana's foremost female poet for many years and its unofficial poet laureate. A complete collection of her poetry was published in Indianapolis in 1886. She was also called the \\"Pioneer Poet Laureate of Indiana\\".Mary Jean DeMarr, \\"Sarah T(itle Barrett) Bolton\\" in Most of Bolton's writings, including her narrative poetry, were idealistic and expressed her nostalgic views of early pioneer and farm life. Her poetry also had a \\"religious spirit,\\" which present-day readers may consider overly \\"sentimental and trite.\\" However, some of Bolton's poems show her concerns for social justice and sympathy for supporters of radical causes. For example, \\"Ne Dormiat Deus\\" expresses Bolton's concerns for women's inequality; \\"Evicted,\\" \\"Two Scenes,” and \\"Ye Sons of Toil\\" describe inequalities among social and economic classes; and \\"The Doomed Anarchist, \\" a poem inspired by Chicago's 1886 Haymarket affair, protests the death penalty.

He is most well known for having had Emperor Zhaozong of Tang under his control at his power base at Hua Prefecture (華州, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) from 896 to 898 and slaughtering the imperial princes while Emperor Zhaozong was there.  During Tang Dynasty   Background and early career  Han Jian was born in 855, during the reign of Emperor Xuānzong of Tang. He was from Xu Prefecture (許州, in modern Xuchang, Henan). His ancestors, including his father Han Shufeng (), had served for generations in the army. When Qin Zongquan took over Cai Prefecture (蔡州, in modern Zhumadian, Henan) in 880,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. he encouraged people to join his army, and Han Jian did. In 881, when the eunuch general Yang Fuguang was able to persuade Zhou Ji the military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered at Xu Prefecture) to renounce his allegiance to Huang Chao — a major agrarian rebel who had captured the Tang capital Chang'an, forced then-reigning Emperor Xizong (Emperor Xuānzong's grandson) to flee to Chengdu, and declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qi — and return to the Tang fold, Yang also persuaded Qin to send forces to contribute to the war efforts against Huang's Qi state. Yang organized his army into eight corps, commanded by Lu Yanhong, Jin Hui (), Wang Jian, Han Jian, Zhang Zao (), Li Shitai (), and Pang Cong () respectively. Han thereafter served under Yang. Yang Fuguang died in 883 while stationed at Hezhong Circuit (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) and still fighting against Huang. Instead of continuing to fight against Huang, Lu decided to take his troops and rove around the region, pillaging as he went.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. Wang, Han, Zhang, Jin, and Li followed him as well.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Later in 883, Lu captured Xingyuan (興元, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) the capital of Shannan West Circuit (), expelling the military governor Niu Xu () and claiming the title of acting military governor. He commissioned Han and the other Zhongwu corps commanders as prefects within Shannan West, but did not allow them to actually report to their prefectures. He was particularly suspicious of Wang and Han because of their deep friendship, but wanting to comfort them, he often treated them well. Wang and Han realized Lu's intentions, however, and in fall 884, with Emperor Xizong's trusted eunuch Tian Lingzi secretly tempting them with offers of good treatment, they, along with Zhang, Jin, and Li, abandoned Lu and fled to Chengdu to serve under Tian. After Emperor Xizong returned to Chang'an in 885 after Huang's defeat, Han was made the defender of Tong Pass and the prefect of Hua Prefecture.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 40.  Governance at Hua Prefecture   Prior to Emperor Zhaozong's stay at Hua Prefecture  At that time, the Tang empire was divided between warlords, most of whom were only interested in battling and seizing more territory. However, as the prefect of Hua Prefecture, Han Jian encouraged the refugees from the wars to settle in Hua and promoted agriculture. It was said that within a span of a few years, both the Hua prefectural government and the people of Hua were wealthy. The popular sentiment at the time greatly praised him, along with Cheng Rui the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (荊南, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. By 890, Han was carrying the title of military governor as well, of a newly created Zhenguo Circuit (),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. which included only Hua Prefecture and nearby Tong Prefecture (同州, also in modern Weinan).Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 62, appendix. That year, when Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong declared a general campaign against Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) and put the chancellor Zhang Jun in command of the operations, Han personally led his army to join Zhang's and was also responsible for supplying the army. The imperial army, however, was dealt a blow when Zhang's deputy commander, Sun Kui (), was captured in an ambush by Li Keyong's adoptive son Li Cunxiao. Subsequently, when the imperial army and Li Keyong's main army met, Han carried out a nighttime attack against Li Cunxiao but was repelled. After Han's defeat, the armies from Fengxiang (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Jingnan (靜難, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi, not the same circuit Cheng ruled) deserted the imperial army. After Li Keyong's army further defeated Zhang and forced the imperial army into a defensive posture at Jin Prefecture (晉州, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), the armies from Baoda (保大, headquartered in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi) and Dingnan (定難, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) Circuits also abandoned the imperial army, leaving Zhang and Han defending Jin Prefecture with troops sent by Li Keyong's archrival Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Shanxi). Li Cunxiao put Jin under siege, but after deciding that capturing a chancellor would be a bad idea, he lifted the siege and allowed Zhang and Han to flee, and they did. To flee back west across the Yellow River, they were forced to tear down local residents' homes and use the building material to construct rafts. The defeat left the imperial army in shambles, although the extent of damage to Han's own army is unclear. Subsequently, Li Keyong, as a condition for resubmitting to the imperial government, demanded the exiles of Zhang and fellow chancellor Kong Wei; however, instead of going into exile, both Zhang and Kong fled to Hua, where Han put them under his protection. In 891, after accusations of treason were made against the powerful eunuch Yang Fugong (Yang Fuguang's brother), Emperor Zhaozong sent imperial guards to attack Yang's mansion. Yang fled to Yang Fuguang's adoptive son Yang Shouliang the military governor of Shannan West, and they, along with Yang Fugong's other adoptive sons or nephews Yang Shouzhong (), Yang Shouzhen (), and Yang Shouhou (), all of whom were nearby governors, rose against the imperial government. In spring 892, Han, along with Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang, Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan, Li Maozhen's brother Li Maozhuang () the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered in modern Tianshui, Gansu), and Wang Xingyu's brother Wang Xingyue () the military governor of Kuangguo Circuit (匡國, headquartered at Tong Prefecture) (thus showing that Han had lost control of Tong by this point), submitted a petition for Emperor Zhaozong to declare a general campaign against Yang Fugong and his adoptive sons/nephews and make Li Maozhen the overall commander of the operations. Emperor Zhaozong hesitated, believing that if Li Maozhen conquered the Yangs' territory, he would be even harder to control, but Li Maozhen launched the campaign anyway without imperial sanction, forcing Emperor Zhaozong to eventually agree to the campaign. Li Maozhen eventually defeated the Yangs, forcing them to try to flee to Li Keyong (except Yang Shouhou who seemed to die a natural death around that time); on the way, they were intercepted and arrested by Han's soldiers. Han delivered them to Chang'an, where they were executed. Li Maozhen took over their territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. In 895, a succession dispute that rose after the death of Wang Chongying the military governor of Huguo Circuit (護國, new name for Hezhong) brought Han and his allies Li Maozhen and Wang Xingyu into direct dispute with the imperial government and Li Keyong. Wang Chongying's brother and predecessor Wang Chongrong had adopted Wang Ke, the biological son of his brother Wang Chongjian (), as his own son, and after Wang Chongying's death, the soldiers at Hezhong, with Li Keyong's backing, wanted Wang Ke to succeed Wang Chongying. However, Wang Chongying's own biological sons Wang Gong the military governor of Baoyi Circuit (保義, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) and Wang Yao () the prefect of Jin had wanted Wang Gong to take over instead, and thus induced Han, Li Maozhen, and Wang Xingyu to lobby Emperor Zhaozong on Wang Gong's behalf. Emperor Zhaozong approved Li Keyong's request and rejected that of Han and his allies, leaving the three feeling humiliated. Wang Xingyu and Han were further displeased that their requests to take over two Shence Army bases were rejected as well. In summer 895, Han, Li Maozhen, and Wang Xingyu decided to march on Chang'an. They accused the former chancellors Wei Zhaodu and Li Xi, whom they viewed to be against them, of corruption, and when Emperor Zhaozong refused to execute Wei and Li Xi, they executed Wei and Li Xi anyway. They also forced Emperor Zhaozong to issue an edict transferring Wang Ke to Kuangguo, Wang Gong to Hezhong, and Wang Xingyue to Baoyi, before returning to their own circuits (but leaving troops at Chang'an to watch over Emperor Zhaozong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Han's and his allies' actions spurred Li Keyong into action. He quickly defeated and killed Wang Yao, and then advanced across the Yellow River, putting Hua Prefecture under siege. Han's pleas to Li Keyong to lift the siege were initially spurned by Li Keyong, but Li Keyong, after hearing that Li Maozhen and Wang Xingyu were both intending to capture Emperor Zhaozong, advanced quickly toward Jingnan. (Li Maozhen's and Wang Xingyu's forces at Chang'an did, in fact, dispute among themselves and each attempted to capture Emperor Zhaozong, but Emperor Zhaozong, under protection by the imperial guards, fled into the Qinling Mountains instead and eluded capture.) Li Keyong put Jingnan's capital Bin Prefecture () under siege; Wang Xingyu tried to flee, but was killed in flight by his own subordinates. Li Maozhen and Han, in fear, became very submissive in their attitude toward the imperial government. Li Keyong subsequently requested permission from Emperor Zhaozong to destroy Li Maozhen as well, but Emperor Zhaozong, wanting to maintain a balance of power, forbid him, and he subsequently withdrew — and it was said that after Li Keyong's withdrawal, Li Maozhen and Han again became arrogant. In 896, Emperor Zhaozong tried to alleviate the pressures that Li Maozhen and Han were putting on the imperial government by recruiting new soldiers for the imperial guards, putting them under the commands of several imperial princes. Li Maozhen declared that the imperial princes were planning to attack him and that he would defend himself, mobilizing his own forces to again march on Chang'an. Emperor Zhaozong sought emergency aid from Li Keyong, but Li Keyong was unable to respond. When Li Maozhen then defeated Li Sizhou () the Prince of Qin and approached Chang'an, Emperor Zhaozong decided to take the imperial officials and princes and flee Chang'an — which Fengxiang forces then entered and burned. After leaving Chang'an, he initially intended, at the recommendation of Li Jiepi () the Prince of Yan, to flee to Hedong. However, Han made several petitions to Emperor Zhaozong, urging him to head to Zhenguo instead, arguing that if Emperor Zhaozong went as far as Hedong, he would never be able to return to the Chang'an region. Emperor Zhaozong and his attendants also were hesitant to make the long trek to Hedong, and so went to Zhenguo instead.  During and after Emperor Zhaozong's stay at Hua Prefecture  Emperor Zhaozong's chancellors (at that time, Wang Tuan, Sun Wo, and Lu Yi), who fled with him to Zhenguo, were apprehensive of Han Jian and were not daring to decide on policy matters. Emperor Zhaozong, in response, issued an edict asking Han to participate in the policy decisions, but after Han declined, cancelled the request. Meanwhile, another chancellor who had been removed at Han's behest, Cui Yin, sought aid from Zhu Quanzhong, who had submitted a petition asking Emperor Zhaozong to move the capital to Luoyang; Zhu made a posture to attack Han and wrote Han to suggest that Cui should be restored. Han, in fear, recommended Cui's restoration, and Cui was subsequently restored. Emperor Zhaozong subsequently bestowed the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling () on Han. He also put Sun in command of the operations against Li Maozhen and had Han be Sun's assistant as well as the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆, i.e., Chang'an region), preparing to attack Li Maozhen. However, Han did not want the emperor to attack his long-time ally, and Li Maozhen also submitted petitions begging forgiveness, and the imperial army was never put into actual attack mode. Meanwhile, Han, apprehensive of the imperial army soldiers that the imperial princes who fled to Zhenguo with Emperor Zhaozong commanded, falsely accused them of plotting treason, going as far as having soldiers surround Emperor Zhaozong's provisional palace clamoring for the princes to be stripped of their commands. Due to this threat, Emperor Zhaozong was forced to strip the princes of their commands, and to execute the imperial guard command Li Yun (), who had up to that point protected Emperor Zhaozong well. Han then put the imperial princes under effective house arrest, leaving Emperor Zhaozong with no forces that he could command. Knowing that Emperor Zhaozong was displeased with him, he tried to alleviate the displeasure by urging Emperor Zhaozong to create his oldest son Li You the Prince of De crown prince. Emperor Zhaozong agreed and created Li You crown prince (changing his name to Li Yu) and Li Yu's mother Consort He empress. Also around the same time, Han falsely accused two of Emperor Zhaozong's close associates, the astronomer Ma Daoyin () and the physician Xu Yanshi () and had them executed, and then used the excuse that Sun and a new chancellor, Zhu Pu, were associated with Ma and Xu, to have Sun and Zhu removed from their chancellor positions.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In summer 897, Li Maozhen, whose ally Gu Yanhui the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (東川, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) had suffered repeated defeats by Wang Jian (who by that point had taken over neighboring Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu) and was expanding his territory), submitted a petition urging Emperor Zhaozong to punish Wang for attacking Dongchuan. In response, Emperor Zhaozong, trying to use this as an excuse to recover Fengxiang, issued demoting Wang to be a prefectural prefect, transferring Li Maozhen to Xichuan, and making Li Sizhou the military governor of Fengxiang. When Li Sizhou headed for Fengxiang, Li Maozhen refused to let him take over the circuit, and put him and his soldiers under siege. It was only after Han wrote a letter to Li Maozhen that Li Maozhen lifted the siege against Li Sizhou to allow Li Sizhou to return to Zhenguo. Subsequently, as Wang also refused to yield Xichuan to Li Maozhen, the orders were cancelled. Soon after Li Sizhou's return, Li Jiepi also returned from Hezhong, where he had gone to seek aid from Li Keyong — thus exposing the fact that Li Keyong, who had suffered defeats lately, would be unable to come to the emperor's aid. With the possibility that Li Keyong might intervene removed, Han submitted a petition demanding the deaths of Li Sizhou, Li Jiepi, and the other imperial princes, on accusations of treason. Emperor Zhaozong tried to alleviate the situation by not acting on Han's petition, but Han and the eunuch Liu Jishu the acting director of palace communications then acted on their own and executed Li Sizhou, Li Jiepi, Li Yun () the Prince of Dan, Emperor Zhaozong's uncle Li Zi the Prince of Tong, and seven other princes. Meanwhile, Han sent threats to Li Maozhen's adoptive son Li Jitang (), who was then the military governor of Kuangguo, and Li Jitang fled back to Fengxiang, allowing Han to take over Kuangguo. Emperor Zhaozong thereafter made him the military governor of Kuangguo, in addition to Zhenguo. Meanwhile, Zhu Quanzhong made repeated requests to have Emperor Zhaozong move to Luoyang. Both Li Maozhen and Han were apprehensive that Zhu would attack west, and therefore decided to repair the palaces at Chang'an to have Emperor Zhaozong return to Chang'an. They also made peace with Li Keyong. The palace reconstruction was completed in spring 898, and Han personally went to Chang'an to inspect them. In autumn 898, Emperor Zhaozong and his court returned to Chang'an, while Han remained at Zhenguo. Emperor Zhaozong bestowed the honorific title of acting Taifu () on him, and converted Hua Prefecture into a special municipality, Xingde (), making Han its mayor. He also created Han the Duke of Xu.  Submission to Zhu Quanzhong  In 901, after Emperor Zhaozong had been deposed by Liu Jishu and Wang Zhongxian () in 900 but then restored by Shence Army officers who were loyal to him, Cui Yin proposed to Emperor Zhaozong that all of the eunuchs be massacred. The plan became known to Liu's and Wang's successors Han Quanhui and Zhang Yanhong (), who, fearful of being killed, entered into an alliance with Li Maozhen and tried to have Cui removed. Cui, in turn fearful that the eunuchs would have him killed, requested that Zhu Quanzhong bring an army to Chang'an to act against the eunuchs. Hearing that Zhu had launched his troops, Han and Zhang forcibly took Emperor Zhaozong to Fengxiang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. Meanwhile, as Zhu's forces approached the region, Han Jian's subordinate Sima Ye (), whom Han had made the acting military governor of Kuangguo, surrendered Kuangguo to Zhu. Zhu sent Sima back to Zhenguo to have him relay Zhu's message — that if Han did not surrender, Zhu would attack. In fear, Han sent his deputy military governor Li Juchuan () to surrender. The retired chancellor Zhang Jun met with Zhu and persuaded him that Han, who had long been allied with Li Maozhen, must be removed. When Zhu met him to rebuke him for his past deeds, Han blamed them on Li Juchuan. Zhu executed Li Juchuan but spared Han. Wanting to remove Han from the scene, however, he made Han the military governor of Zhongwu and transferred Zhongwu's military governor Zhao Xu () to Kuangguo. It was said that the large amount of tax revenue that Han had obtained and saved during Emperor Zhaozong's stay at Hua Prefecture (Xingde Municipality having been abolished by this point) now fell into Zhu's hands. Zhu subsequently put Fengxiang under siege. In 903, with Fengxiang suffering from a terrible famine due to the siege, Li Maozhen surrendered Emperor Zhaozong to Zhu and sued for peace.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. Zhu, with the emperor in his hands, began to consider usurping the throne. He first forced Emperor Zhaozong to kill Cui (who by now was aware of his intentions and were trying to raise an imperial army to counter it) and then forced Emperor Zhaozong to abandon Chang'an and move the capital to Luoyang. As Emperor Zhaozong went on the journey to Luoyang, he stopped at Hua Prefecture and stayed for some time there. At one point, Zhu went to meet him, along with Han, and he held a feast in their honor. Han, however, warned Zhu that Emperor Zhaozong might be planning to assassinate him at the feast (Han did so by stomping on Zhu's feet during the feast), and therefore Zhu cut the feast short and left it.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. Zhu thus became grateful to Han. Subsequently, Zhu made the Chang'an region into a new Youguo Circuit (佑國, headquartered at Chang'an) and made Han the military governor of Youguo. However, in 906 (by which time Emperor Zhaozong had been assassinated under Zhu's orders and succeeded by his son Emperor Ai), apparently concerned that given Youguo's vicinity to Fengxiang that Han might collaborate with Li Maozhen again, Zhu transferred Han to Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong) and transferred the military governor of Pinglu, Wang Zhongshi (), to Youguo.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265.  During Later Liang  In 907, Zhu Quanzhong forced Emperor Aizong to yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu. He made Han Jian acting Situ (司徒, one of the Three Excellencies) and gave him the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making Han a chancellor, and in 908 gave Han the greater chancellor title of Shizhong ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. It was said that by this point, Emperor Taizu was often violent and unreasonable, and very few officials dared to make suggestions to him. Han, however, would do so, and he appreciated Han's advice. In 909, however, Han was removed from his chancellor post and given the honorary title of Taibao ().Zizhi Tongjian, 267. In 910, with Zhongwu and Kuangguo's names having been swapped in 908, Han was made the military governor of Kuangguo (i.e., the old Zhongwu Circuit). In 912, Emperor Taizu was assassinated by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, who falsely claimed that the assassination was by Emperor Taizu's adoptive son Zhu Youwen the Prince of Bo and had Zhu Youwen killed. Zhu Yougui then took the throne. In the aftermath of Emperor Taizu's death, the armies throughout the Later Liang realm became disturbed, but Han took no precautions against any disturbances at Kuangguo. Soon thereafter, his officer Zhang Hou () started a mutiny and killed Han. Han's son Han Congxun (), whom Zhu Yougui had sent to Kuangguo to announce the news of Emperor Taizu's death, was also killed in the mutiny.

The competition was entered by over 5,700 people Australia-wide. Entrants had to send in a video audition for the chance to host the new channel. Lobo was selected along with Kayne Tremills to be the face of the station and host its flagship show, Studio 3. As well as Studio 3 and during her time with the ABC, Lobo also hosted The World Animal Championships alongside Prank Patrol host Scott Tweedie and Wacky World Beaters – which saw her become a daily fixture on Australian TV. She presented coverage of the 2010 Schools Spectacular with Kayne Tremills and musician John Foreman. Lobo has also appeared on an episode of Gardening Australia. In 2013 Lobo came second in the Nagasaki Speed Eating World Championships. Lobo moved to the UK in 2014 to continue her career in television. She was employed by the BBC and hosted children's programmes. Lobo was the solo host of a music travel show called Pop Slam, which ran for two seasons on CBBC. In each episode, Lobo would pit top bands and singers against each other to find the 'greater' pop star. The bands/solo artists included One Direction, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Cheryl Cole and the Arctic Monkeys. As well as airing in the UK, the show was also shown in other countries. Lobo combined hosting that show with continuity presenting for CBBC. During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Lobo was a member of the BBC Alternative commentary team alongside Barry Davies (play-by-play) and Hacker T. Dog (color). In addition to television, Lobo has been affiliated with Cricket Australia as their youth ambassador. In her work with the organization she has been the face of the Milo In2Cricket kids development program, MC’ed the KFC T20 Big Bash Series, been a member of the commentary team for the live coverage of the Women’s International T20 series, MC’ed internal stakeholder events, and been a correspondent for both the Alan Border Medal and Ashes Tours. Lobo has also worked for the Melbourne Renegade (boundary riding and vox pops) during the Big Bash season.

Although referred to as a Japanese castle, it did not have a donjon (tenshu) or serve as the residence of a land-holding noble, and therefore is probably more within the definition of a hill fort, rather than a true castle. Built by Mōri Motonari, Miyao Castle was part of a greater plan to bait and trap his enemy, Sue Harukata, which culminated in the Battle of Miyajima in 1555. The site of Miyao castle is located in Hamano-cho on the island of Miyajima, Hatsukaichi city, Hiroshima Prefecture. Background In 1551, Sue Harukata revolted against his lord Ōuchi Yoshitaka, forcing him to commit seppuku. Sue effectively led the Ōuchi family and its armies, which ruled over Aki Province. In 1554, Mōri Motonari, as a fellow vassal of the Ōuchi clan, took up arms against Sue. The heavily outnumbered Mōri force attacked and defeated Sue at the Battle of Oshikibata. Mōri later departed from the mainland to build Miyao Castle on Itsukushima, popularly known as Miyajima. Castle construction As site for Miyao Castle, Mōri Motonari selected a 30-meter hill called in the northwest corner of the island, near the main shrine and overlooking the channel between Miyajima and the mainland. Miyao Castle was designed as a on a piece of land at the foot of steep-sided mountains, including the 535-meter Mount Misen. The castle area could be approached by sea on three sides. Thus, Miyao Castle was intended to be highly visible and fairly vulnerable. The castle was hastily built with the forthcoming battle in mind. About 1,000 laborers were employed, and it took them about one month to build it to Motonari's satisfaction. Stone walls had to be built in order to buttress the weakly tamped earthen foundation which, without support, would have easily collapsed. A permanent donjon (tenshu) was probably never built. Battle of Miyajima When construction of Miyao Castle was complete, Motonari departed for the mainland, leaving a small garrison to defend the castle. In late September 1555, Sue Harukata took the bait, attacked, and took the castle with overwhelming force. Within days, Motonari and his allies maneuvered into their respective positions and stormed Miyao Castle from three sides. While a landing force approached from the sea, two other groups had landed on the other side of the island, travelled overland, and attacked the castle from behind. Although Motonari's forces were heavily outnumbered, he knew the land and the castle's weaknesses, and thus had the tactical advantage as well as the element of surprise. Motonari's forces were able to kill, capture, or scatter the occupying defenders and re-take the castle. The battle became an important milestone in the history of western Japan. Aftermath No records specify what was done with Miyao Castle after the Battle of Miyajima. It was poorly built to begin with, a temporary fortification intended as bait in an elaborate trap. Of further consideration is the fact that Miyao Castle was built on sacred ground, and the ensuing battle was itself an act of desecration in a place where neither birth nor death are supposed to occur. Following the battle, resident Shinto priests conducted elaborate ceremonies in order to remove the pollution of death. Therefore, it is generally believed that Miyao Castle was abandoned by the Mōri clan. The site was probably plundered for its stones and lumber, to be used as construction materials elsewhere. The site of Miyao Castle is now a small park on top of Yougai Hill. There is an explanatory signboard and a small shrine there. The hill is bounded on all sides by residences, shops restaurants, hotels, and ryokan; access to the park is via two staircases on opposite sides of the hill, one of which is very near the ferry docks. The Miyao Castle site is given little or no attention in the tourist literature of Itsukushima, and so it is rarely visited.

It is a shrub with small leaves and orange flowers at the ends of its branches. It has the most widespread distribution of the eremaeas with considerable variation in its characteristics so that three varieties are recognised. It was the first Eremaea to be described formally but was not originally given the name Eremaea. Description Eremaea pauciflora is an erect, spreading or densely foliaged and rounded shrub sometimes growing to a height of . The leaves are long, wide, linear to narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base. Sometimes one or 3 veins are visible on the lower surface. The flowers are orange and are borne singly or in pairs on the ends of long branches which grew in the previous year. The flowers have 5 sepals which are densely hairy on the outside surface and there are 5 petals, long. The stamens are arranged in 5 bundles, each containing 17 to 47 stamens. Flowering occurs from July to January and is followed by fruits which are woody capsules. The capsules are long, smooth and variable in shape.Regans Ford E. pauciflora fruit Taxonomy and naming Eremaea pauciflora was originally known as Metrosideros pauciflora, having been formally described in 1837 by the Austrian botanist, Stephan Endlicher.

Winnicott used true self to describe a sense of self based on spontaneous authentic experience and a feeling of being alive, having a real self.Salman Akhtar, Good Feelings (London 2009) p. 128 The false self, by contrast, Winnicott saw as a defensive façade, which in extreme cases could leave its holders lacking spontaneity and feeling dead and empty, behind a mere appearance of being real. The concepts are often used in connection with narcissism. Characteristics Winnicott saw the true self as rooted from early infancy in the experience of being alive, including blood pumping and lungs breathing – what Winnicott called simply being.Mary Jacobus, The Poetics of Psychoanalysis (Oxford 2005) p. 160 Out of this, the baby creates the experience of a sense of reality, a sense that life is worth living. The baby's spontaneous, nonverbal gestures derive from that instinctual sense,D. W. Winnicott, \\"Ego Distortion in Terms of True and false self ', in The Maturational Process and the Facilitating Environment (London 1965) p. 121 and if responded to by the mother, become the basis for the continuing development of the true self. However, when what Winnicott was careful to describe as good enough parenting – i.e., not necessarily perfect!Simon Grolnick, The Work & Play of Winnicott (New Jersey: Aronson 1990) p. 44 – was not in place, the infant's spontaneity was in danger of being encroached on by the need for compliance with the parents' wishes/expectations.Rosalind Minsky, Psychoanalysis and Gender (London 1996) p. 118 The result for Winnicott could be the creation of what he called the false self, where \\"Other people's expectations can become of overriding importance, overlaying or contradicting the original sense of self, the one connected to the very roots of one's being\\".Winnicott, quoted in Josephine Klein, Our Need for Others (London 1994) p. 241 The danger he saw was that \\"through this false self, the infant builds up a false set of relationships, and by means of introjections even attains a show of being real\\",Winnicott, quoted in Josephine Klein, Our Need for Others (London 1994) p. 365 while, in fact, merely concealing a barren emptiness behind an independent-seeming façade.Rosalind Minsky, Psychoanalysis and Gender (London 1996) pp. 119–20 The danger was particularly acute where the baby had to provide attunement for the mother/parents, rather than vice versa, building up a sort of dissociated recognition of the object on an impersonal, not personal and spontaneous basis.Adam Phillips, On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored (London 1994) pp. 30–31 But while such a pathological false self stifled the spontaneous gestures of the true self in favour of a lifeless imitation, Winnicott nevertheless considered it of vital importance in preventing something worse: the annihilating experience of the exploitation of the hidden true self itself. Precursors There was much in psychoanalytic theory on which Winnicott could draw for his concept of the false self. Helene Deutsch had described the \\"as if\\" personalities, with their pseudo relationships substituting for real ones.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 445 Winnicott's analyst, Joan Riviere, had explored the concept of the narcissist's masquerade – superficial assent concealing a subtle hidden struggle for control.Mary Jacobus, The Poetics of Psychoanalysis: In the Wake of Klein (Oxford 2005) p. 37 Freud's own late theory of the ego as the product of identificationsJacques Lacan, Ecrits: A Selection (London 1997) p. 128 came close to viewing it only as a false self;Adam Phillips, Winnicott (Harvard 1988) p. 136 while Winnicott's true/false distinction has also been compared to Michael Balint's \\"basic fault\\" and to Ronald Fairbairn's notion of the \\"compromised ego\\".J. H. Padel, \\"Freudianism: Later Developments\\", in Richard Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (Oxford 1987) p. 273 Erich Fromm, in his book The Fear of Freedom distinguished between original self and pseudo self – the inauthenticality of the latter being a way to escape the loneliness of freedom;Erich Fromm (1942), The Fear of Freedom (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul 2001) p. 175 while much earlier the existentialist like Kierkegaard had claimed that \\"to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair\\" – the despair of choosing \\"to be another than himself\\".Quoted in Carl Rogers, On Becoming a Person (1961) p. 110 Karen Horney, in her 1950 book, Neurosis and Human Growth, based her idea of \\"true self\\" and \\"false self\\" through the view of self-improvement, interpreting it as real self and ideal self, with the real self being what one currently is and the ideal self being what one could become. (See also Karen Horney § Theory of the self). Later developments The last half-century have seen Winnicott's ideas extended and applied in a variety of contexts, both in psychoanalysis and beyond. Kohut Kohut extended Winnicott's work in his investigation of narcissism,Eugene M. DeRobertis, Humanizing Child Development Theories (2008), p. 38 seeing narcissists as evolving a defensive armor around their damaged inner selves.Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (London 1988) p. 136 He considered it less pathological to identify with the damaged remnants of the self, than to achieve coherence through identification with an external personality at the cost of one's own autonomous creativity.Heinz Kohut, How Does Analysis Cure? (London 1984), pp. 142, 167. Lowen Alexander Lowen identified narcissists as having a true and a false, or superficial, self. The false self rests on the surface, as the self presented to the world. It stands in contrast to the true self, which resides behind the facade or image. This true self is the feeling self, but for the narcissist the feeling self must be hidden and denied. Since the superficial self represents submission and conformity, the inner or true self is rebellious and angry. This underlying rebellion and anger can never be fully suppressed since it is an expression of the life force in that person. But because of the denial, it cannot be expressed directly. Instead it shows up in the narcissist's acting out. And it can become a perverse force.Lowen, Alexander. Narcissism: Denial of the true self. Simon & Schuster, 2004, 1984. Masterson James F. Masterson argued that all the personality disorders crucially involve the conflict between a person's two selves: the false self, which the very young child constructs to please the mother, and the true self. The psychotherapy of personality disorders is an attempt to put people back in touch with their real selves.Dr. James Masterson, expert on personality disorders; at 84 Symington Symington developed Winnicott's contrast between true and false self to cover the sources of personal action, contrasting an autonomous and a discordant source of action – the latter drawn from the internalisation of external influences and pressures.Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 2003) pp. 36, 115 Thus for example parental dreams of self-glorification by way of their child's achievements can be internalised as an alien discordant source of action.Polly Young- Eisandrath, Women and Desire (London 2000) pp. 112, 198 Symington stressed however the intentional element in the individual's abandoning the autonomous self in favour of a false self or narcissistic mask – something he considered Winnicott to have overlooked.Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 2003) p. 104 Vaknin As part of what has been described as a personal mission by self-confessed narcissist and author Sam Vaknin to raise the profile of the condition.Simon Crompton, All about Me: Loving a Narcissist (London 2007) p. 7 Vaknin has highlighted the role of the false self in narcissism. The false self replaces the narcissist's true self and is intended to shield him from hurt and narcissistic injury by self-imputing omnipotence. The narcissist pretends that his false self is real and demands that others affirm this confabulation, meanwhile keeping his real imperfect true self under wraps.Vaknin S The Dual Role of the Narcissist's False Self For Vaknin, the false self is by far more important to the narcissist than his dilapidated, dysfunctional true self; and in contrast to the psychoanalysts he does not believe in the ability to resuscitate it through therapy.Samuel Vaknin/Lidija Rangelovska Malignant Self-Love (2003) pp. 187–88 Miller Alice Miller cautiously warns that a child/patient may not have any formed true self, waiting behind the false self facade;Alice Miller, The Drama of the Gifted Child (2004) p. 21 and that as a result freeing the true self is not as simple as the Winnicottian image of the butterfly emerging from its cocoon.Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (London 1988) p. 135 If a true self can be developed, however, she considered that the empty grandiosity of the false self could give way to a new sense of autonomous vitality.Alice Miller, The Drama of Being a Child (2004) p. 45 Orbach: false bodies Susie Orbach saw the false self as an overdevelopment (under parental pressure) of certain aspects of the self at the expense of other aspects – of the full potential of the self – producing thereby an abiding distrust of what emerges spontaneously from the individual himself or herself.Susie Orbach, Bodies (London 2009) p. 67 Orbach went on to extend Winnicott's account of how environmental failure can lead to an inner splitting of mind and body,D. W. Winnicott, Winnicott on the Child (2002) p. 76 so as to cover the idea of the false body – falsified sense of one's own body.Susie Orbach, The Impossibility of Sex (Penguin 1999) pp. 48, 216 Orbach saw the female false body in particular as built upon identifications with others, at the cost of an inner sense of authenticity and reliability.Susie Orbach, in Lawrence Spurling ed., Winnicott Studies (1995) p. 6 Breaking up a monolithic but false body-sense in the process of therapy could allow for the emergence of a range of authentic (even if often painful) body feelings in the patient.Susie Orbach, Bodies (London 2009) pp. 67–72 Jungian persona Jungians have explored the overlap between Jung's concept of the persona and Winnicott's false self;Mario Jacoby, Shame and the Origins of Self-Esteem (1996) pp. 59–60 but, while noting similarities, consider that only the most rigidly defensive persona approximates to the pathological status of the false self.Polly Young-Eisendrath/James Albert Hall, Jung's Self Psychology (1991) p. 29 Stern's tripartite self Daniel Stern considered Winnicott's sense of \\"going on being\\" as constitutive of the core, pre-verbal self.Daniel Stern, The Interpersonal World of the Infant (1985) pp. 7, 93 He also explored how language could be used to reinforce a false sense of self, leaving the true self linguistically opaque and disavowed.Daniel Stern, The Interpersonal World of the Infant (1985) p. 227 He ended, however, by proposing a three-fold division of social, private, and of disavowed self.Michael Jacobs, D. W. Winnicott (1995) p. 129 Criticisms Neville Symington criticised Winnicott for failing to integrate his false self insight with the theory of ego and id.Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 2003) p. 97 Similarly, continental analysts like Jean-Bertrand Pontalis have made use of true/false self as a clinical distinction, while having reservations about its theoretical status.V. R. Sherwood/C. P. Cohen, Psychotherapy of the Quiet Borderline Patient (1994) p. 50 The philosopher Michel Foucault took issue more broadly with the concept of a true self on the anti-essentialist grounds that the self was a construct – something one had to evolve through a process of subjectification, an aesthetics of self-formation, not something simply waiting to be uncovered:Paul Rabinov ed., The Foucault Reader (1991) p. 362 \\"we have to create ourselves as a work of art\\".Quoted in Jon Simons ed.

A professional hunter, less frequently referred to as market or commercial hunter and regionally, especially in Britain and Ireland, as professional stalker or gamekeeper, is a person who hunts and/or manages game by profession. Some professional hunters work in the private sector or for government agencies and manage species that are considered overabundant, others are self-employed and make a living by selling hides and meat, while still others are guiding clients on big-game hunts.  Australia  In Australia several million kangaroos are shot each year by licensed professional hunters in population control programmes, with both their meat and hides getting sold.  Germany  German professional hunters (″Berufsjäger″) mostly work for large private forest estates and for state-owned forest administrations, where they control browsing by reducing the numbers of ungulates like roe deer or chamois, manage populations of sought after trophy species like red deer and act as hunting guides for paying clients.  Southern and Eastern Africa  Professional hunter (left) with a guest hunter (right) stalking African big-game in the Kalahari Desert, Namibia The countries of Southern und Eastern Africa, especially Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, are major destinations for big-game hunting tourism in Africa. Local professional hunters, often simply referred to as PH, act as hunting guides for paying guest hunters and manage safari hunting businesses.  United Kingdom  Professional stalker Niall Rowantree standing next to a red deer stag shot on Ardnamurchan estate in the Scottish Highlands. British professional stalkers and gamekeepers primarily work on large estates, especially in the Scottish Highlands, where they most commonly manage red deer, common pheasant, red grouse and French partridge. In their heyday at the outset of the 20th century an estimated 25,000 professional stalkers and gamekeepers were employed in the UK, while today there are some three thousand.  United States   Unregulated hunting in the 19th and early 20th century  American bison were hunted almost to extinction in the late 19th century primarily by market hunters and were reduced to a few hundred by the mid-1880s. In a North American context the terms market hunter and commercial hunter are predominantly used to refer the hunters of the 19th and early 20th century, who sold or traded the flesh, bones, skins and feathers of slain animals as a source of income. These hunters focused on species which gathered in large numbers for breeding, feeding, or migration and was organized into factory- like groups that would systematically depopulate an area of any valuable wildlife over a short period of time. The animals which were hunted included bison, deer, ducks and other waterfowl, geese, pigeons and many other birds, seals and walruses, fish, river mussels, and clams. Populations of large birds were severely depleted through the 19th and early 20th century. The extermination of several species and the threatened loss of others caused popular legislation effectively prohibiting this form of commercial hunting in the United States. Hunting seasons were eventually established to conserve surviving wildlife and allow a certain amount of recovery and re-population to occur. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act signed in 1918 regulated hunting and prohibited all hunting of wood ducks until 1941 and swans until 1962.  Federal and States agencies  Aerial shooting of feral pigs from a helicopter by the Texas Wildlife Services Agencies like the federal Wildlife Services (not to be confused with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service), part of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and its equivalents on the state level employ professional hunters for lethal as well as non-lethal control of wildlife, for example, dealing with wildlife preying on livestock (or humans) and engaging in bird control to prevent bird strikes. The federal Wildlife Services alone has a staff of around 750 professional hunters. It works on around 565 airports around the United States to identify and reduce threats posed by bird strikes.

He was the son of Thomas Cave, a Liberal Member of Parliament, and one of his brothers was George Cave who would become a Conservative Home Secretary and a Viscount. Basil Cave worked for the Foreign Office as a civil servant and was appointed Vice-Consul of British East Africa in 1891. In 1893 he was placed in command of a number of soldiers during civil disorder on Zanzibar and in 1895 was appointed Consul to the country. The Consul-General, AH Hardinge being away, Cave was responsible for starting the Anglo-Zanzibar War in 1896. He issued an ultimatum to Khalid bin Barghash who had seized the throne on the death of Sultan Hamad. The resulting 38-minute war, the shortest in history, ended with victory for Britain and the installation of their chosen Sultan, Hamoud bin Mohammed. Cave was rewarded with appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1897 and accompanied Zanzibari Prince Ali bin Hamud to the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902. He received promotion to Consul-General in 1903 and issued orders that resulted in the quelling of a mutiny in the Sultan's army in 1907. He left the country in 1909, being posted to Algeria where he was said to have worked hard to \\"strengthen the friendship between the French and the British peoples\\". Cave was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1925 and was also a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.  Early career  Basil Cave was born on 14 November 1865. He was the son of Thomas Cave, the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Barnstaple. Basil had five sisters and four brothers, including George Cave, who was a distinguished lawyer, Conservative MP, Home Secretary in David Lloyd George's First World War coalition government, and a Viscount. George Cave would later marry the sister of Lloyd Mathews, who was well acquainted with Basil (Cave was present at his bedside when he died in 1901) and served as First Minister of Zanzibar for much of his posting there.. Basil Cave was a civil servant with the British Foreign Office and on 20 March 1891 was appointed Vice-Consul of \\"British Sphere in East Africa, situated to the north of the German Sphere, to reside at Mombasa\\". On 19 February 1892 he married Mary Creighton McClellan at the Consulate on Zanzibar, with a blessing following at Christ Church Anglican cathedral. The couple had two children, Joy Mary Cave and Kenneth McClellan Cave, Kenneth later served in the Royal Artillery, reaching the rank of Brevet Major and winning the Military Cross. Upon the death of Ali bin Said of Zanzibar on 5 March 1893 it was decided to land 200 British marines to maintain order, looting and violence being customary upon the death of a Sultan, and to ensure the succession of Hamad bin Thuwaini. During these events Cave was placed in command of a guard of marines and native soldiers at the British Agency.  Anglo-Zanzibar War  Cave became the resident Consul of Zanzibar on 1 June 1895, facing a significant diplomatic crisis the next year. On 25 August Sultan of Zanzibar Hamad bin Thuwaini died, his nephew Khalid proclaiming himself sultan. The British authorities had the right to appoint the Sultan and had chosen Hamoud bin Mohammed. The Consul-General, AH Hardinge, was away in Britain at the time and it fell to Cave, as the most senior British diplomat present, to issue a warning to Khalid. He did so in person at the Sultan's palace alongside General Mathews, but was ignored and Khalid began fortifying the area... Cave continued to send messages to Khalid informing him that the British government considered this an act of rebellion and requesting that he stand down his troops and renounce the sultancy. This was ignored and Cave telegraphed his superiors at the Foreign Office for authorisation to use force.. He also informed all other foreign official not to recognise Khalid, to which they agreed.. During this time of unrest Mrs Cave lent her sitting rooms at the Consulate as a refuge for the European ladies of the town and instructed her cook to provide for them.. The British government's approval came the next day and Cave received reinforcements in the form of a small flotilla of Royal Navy vessels led by Rear-Admiral Harry Rawson.. Cave entered further negotiations with Khalid but these proved unsuccessful and he was forced to issue an ultimatum to leave by 9 am the next morning or he would open fire.. On the morning of 27 August Cave refused further attempts at compromise from Khalid and, receiving the message that \\"We have no intention of hauling down our flag and we do not believe you would open fire on us\\"; Cave replied \\"We do not want to open fire, but unless you do as you are told we shall certainly do so\\". At 9.02 the bombardment of the palace commenced, signalling the start of the Anglo-Zanzibar War.. The war, the shortest in history, ended 38 minutes later after 500 defenders had been killed or wounded and the palace set alight, without British loss... Khalid fled the palace and, with some of his supporters, sought refuge at the German consulate.. The Germans refused to extradite Khalid and eventually, despite Cave's protests, he was smuggled out by the German Navy to Dar es Salaam in German East Africa..  Post-war Zanzibar  Having successfully installed the chosen sultan, Hamoud, Cave was rewarded with appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1897. He was active in campaigning against slavery in Zanzibar, which was finally abolished in 1897. One of Cave's duties was to accompany Prince Ali bin Hamud to Britain as a representative of Hamoud at the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902.. Hamoud died whilst Cave and Ali were en route and Cave informed the Prince once they reached Djibouti on the return journey. It was also his responsibility to formally inform Ali that the British government had chosen him as his father's successor and that Mr A. Rogers, the First Minister, would act as regent until Ali was 21... Cave was promoted to Consul-General on 9 July 1903, with the role of commercial agent being added to his duties on 8 July 1904. During a mutiny of the Zanzibar Army in 1907 Cave received a request for British assistance from the Sultan and, no British vessel being within 100 miles of the island, was forced to ask for assistance from the German Navy. The Germans responded, sending a vessel to the Stone Town harbour which overawed the mutineers and allowed their officers to restore order.  Later life  Cave left Zanzibar in 1909, being appointed Consul-General for Algeria, resident at Algiers, on 1 April. His efforts in that country resulted in Lieutenant-General Gordon Casserly dedicating his book \\"Algeria To-day\\" to Cave and his wife \\"in token of admiration of the good work that they have done for the empire by their efforts to strengthen the friendship between the French and the British peoples\\".. Cave was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1925, allowing him to use the title of \\"Sir\\". Cave was also a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Basil Cave died in 1931; two photographs of him are in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery.

History Although Indian migration to Oman is apparently for the purpose of spreading their commercial activities and mutually sharing the profits, their mutual good relations are believed to have existed as early as the 7th century. It was however, in 15th century since when the Indian merchants had started undertaking commercial activities in Muscat in a quite systematic manner. As an important port-town in the Gulf of Oman, Muscat attracted foreign tradesman and settlers, such as the Persians, the Balochs and Gujaratis. The Indian community then consisted essentially of traders and financiers from Kutch and Sindh. Some of the earliest Indian immigrants to settle in Oman were the Bhatias of Kutch in Gujarat, who have had a powerful presence in Oman dating back to the 16th century. It was during the 19th century that some Khojas Asharuddeen Tharammal reached there, and who are presently well-integrated in Oman; some of them hold even ministerial positions. A few Indian families predominantly from Gujarat which have been living in Oman since many centuries, have developed their enterprises into the colossal business houses.Global Indian Origin - Migration Oman Admittedly, the settlement of the Indian migrants in Oman has become possible only because of Omani government's liberal policy in granting its citizenship to foreign nationals. It is conceivably the only Arab country in Arabian Peninsula, which has taken such dynamic initiative, which has proved to be enormously beneficial to them in many respects. Any person irrespective of his religion or race, who has completed at least 20 years in Oman, is treated as eligible to apply for its citizenship. That's why about a thousand Indians have so far became Omani citizens. Religion The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi performed Abhishekam at the historic Lord Shiva temple, in Muscat, Oman on February 12, 2018 Oman holds an exceptional position among all the Persian Gulf countries in terms of Basic Law of the State promulgated in December 1996, which guarantees the freedom of worship to all its inhabitants, irrespective of their religious beliefs. Such liberal policy of the government has made it possible that presently there are two Hindu temples where congregations are held regularly. One of these temples is more than hundred years old. The Hindus have been granted the rights of cremation as per their religious rites. There are nearly four temporary gurudwaras (2 in Muscat, 1 in Salalah and Sohar each), which have been built in the labour camps. Oman also has seven churches for various Christian sects living in this country. Recently the Omani government has allowed the Indian Community to build a permanent gurudwara and a temple in Oman of the likes that are seen in India itself (The current temples and gurudwaras are small, temporary, and bounded to a compound). Demographics The Indian community in Oman is regarded to be among the most prosperous communities in the country. At present, Indians constitute almost 20% of Oman's total population of 2.3 million (2010 census), as they are the largest expatriate community in the country. There are 448,000 Indian migrant workers in Oman. The Indians in Oman belong to various professions and businesses. Almost 25% of them are unskilled workers, 30% of them semi-skilled, and 35% are skilled ones. The other 10% consist of professionals such as engineers, bankers, financial experts, managers/executives and businessmen. There are around 2,000 Indian doctors in Oman, who work in different hospitals and healthcare centers of the country. Some of them are working with the local newspapers and magazines; particularly those being published in English. The majority of Indians in Oman come from Kerala, accounting for 60% of all Indian nationals in the country. Education Indian School, Al Wadi Al Kabir There are a number of Indian curriculum and community-run schools in Oman, including #Indian School (Darsait) #Indian School (Al-Ghubra) #Indian School (Al Wadi Al Kabir) #Indian School (Muscat) #Indian School (Sohar) #Indian School (Seeb) #Indian School (Nizwa) #Indian School (Ibri) #Indian School (Ibra) The local Omanis are prohibited from studying in these schools.

The Fury name has also been used by Royal Enfield Motors in India for a 175 cc motorcycle and for a new 499 cc single in their range for 2011. Development Launched in 1959, the 499 cc Fury was planned for the US export market to compete against the BSA Gold Star and Velocette Venom. Developed from the Royal Enfield Bullet and sharing many of the cycle parts, the Fury had an aluminium alloy barrel with cast iron liner and a high compression piston. The engine was specially tuned to increase the Bullet's 27 hp (20 kW) to 40 bhp (30 kW). Intended for serious off road and competition use, the Fury was supplied with optional lights, mounting an optional rev counter, an rear wheel and a front wheel. Only 191 Furies were made between 1959 and 1963, when production ended. Enfield Fury 175 The 'Fury' name was revived by Enfield India for a licensed copy of the German Zündapp KS175. Royal Enfield (India) assembled the 163 cc Fury from parts imported from Germany when Zündapp Motorcycles ceased production and closed their factories in 1984. It had five-speed gearbox, a hydraulic Brembo disc brake and a sleeveless hard chromed cylinder barrel, all were a first on a motorcycle in that country. 2011 Royal Enfield Fury The Royal Enfield Fury name has been used again for a new 499 cc single-cylinder model by Royal Enfield India and forms part of their range for 2011. The new Fury has fuel injection and is the first Royal Enfield motorcycle in 40 years with twin exhaust pipes. The new Fury is supplied with a chrome headlight and digital instruments, with a fibreglass single seat unit incorporating a rear light. With maximum power of 27.2 hp (20.3 kW) at 5250 rpm, however, the new Fury has more in common with the modern Royal Enfield Electra than the original Fury of 1959.

It is the oldest of the three ONIX standards, and is widely implemented in the book trade in North America, Europe and increasingly in the Asia-Pacific region. It allows book and ebook publishers to create and manage a corpus of rich metadata about their products, and to exchange it with their customers (distributors and retailers) in a coherent, unambiguous, and largely automated manner. Overview The ONIX for Books standard provides a free-to-use format for passing descriptive metadata about books between publishers, data aggregators, book retailers and other interested parties in the publishing industry. Metadata concerning one or more book titles can be stored in a suitably formatted XML file known as an 'ONIX message' ready for dissemination. Whereas other data standards exist for storing the contents of a book - the text, layout and graphics - the ONIX for Books standard holds information about the book, similar to, but more extensive than, the information one would typically find on the cover or title page of a printed book or in a library catalog. The ONIX for Books standard provides a way to communicate information about a book's author, publisher, price, publication date, physical dimensions, synopsis and many other details besides. The standard is quite extensive and most publishers currently provide only a few dozen of the many hundreds of pieces of information that the standard is designed to carry. Versioning ONIX for Books Release 1.0 was published in 2000. Revisions were made in releases 1.1, 1.2 and 1.2.1. Release 2.0 was issued in 2001. A backwards-compatible version, Release 2.1, arrived in June 2003. Three minor revisions intended for general use have been made since then, the most recent in January 2006. A further revision intended solely for use in Japan was issued in 2010. Release 3.0 was published in April 2009 with some corrections in 2010, and the first minor revision (labelled 3.0.1) was issued in January 2012. A second minor revision (3.0.2) was published in January 2014 and a third in April 2016. The latest version is 3.0.7, released in October 2019, and the standard continues to evolve to meet new business requirements as they emerge. This 3.0 release has not yet completely replaced 2.1, though implementation of 3.0 is widespread and continuing to grow. There is also an Acknowledgement message format (published 2015) which recipients of ONIX data files may send to confirm receipt of ONIX messages. The authors have stated that any new revisions will be based on, and backwards-compatible with, Release 3.0.EDItEUR website ONIX overview The international steering committee announced in January 2012 that support for version 2.1 would be reduced at the end of December 2014. Releases 2.1 and 3.0 share a set of 'Codelists' or controlled vocabularies, that are extended regularly to allow new types of information to be carried without having to revise the main specifications. From Issue 37 of the controlled vocabularies, additions are applicable only to ONIX 3.0, and ONIX 2.1 is limited to Issue 36 or earlier. Usage The ONIX for Books standard can be used to communicate a great deal more information than most publishers currently choose to provide. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the standard is designed for use with many different types of book and no single publication is expected to use all of them. The standard also provides for the inclusion of sales and pricing information which a publisher may not wish to freely distribute outside their organization. And while the ONIX for Books standard has been around since 2000, many publishers are still getting to grips with producing ONIX messages; the task is made easier if the amount of information provided for each title is kept to a minimum. However, studies have found that a richer selection of metadata is associated with enhanced sales of books and eBooks.Nielsen white paper The link between metadata and sales (UK market, 2012 The importance of metadata for discoverability and sales (UK, 2016) See also *MARC standards *BIBFRAME References Sources * EDItEUR – ONIX for Books overview * BISG – Metadata committee, ONIX for Books Markup languages Industry-specific XML-based standards Bibliography file formats ","title":"ONIX for Books"},{"id":"30008387","text":"Katarina Bulatović (; born 15 November 1984) is a retired Montenegrin handball player, right back.EHF profilehttps://www.gyorietokc.hu/hu/hirek/hir/6815 Career Internationally she represented Serbia and Montenegro and Serbia, before opting to play for Montenegro in 2011.

Frodsham Hodson (1770–1822) was an English churchman and academic, the Principal of Brasenose College, Oxford from 1809. Life He was the son of the Rev. George Hodson, and was born in Liverpool, England, on 7 June 1770. He entered Manchester Grammar School in January 1784, and left it in 1787 to go to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. on 14 January 1791, M.A. 10 October 1793, B.D. 1808, and D.D. 1809. In May 1791, he succeeded to a Hulmean exhibition, and was afterwards elected a Fellow of Brasenose College. In 1793, he gained the university prize for an essay in English prose on \\"The Influence of Education and Government on National Character\\".Oxford Engl. Prize Essays, 1836, vol. i. In 1795, Hodson was chosen lecturer at St George's Church, Liverpool, and subsequently became chaplain there. His persistence in holding the chaplaincy, although he rarely in later years visited Liverpool, gave offence in the town. In 1803–4 and again in 1808-10, he filled the office of public examiner at Oxford. In 1808 he was appointed rector of St Mary's, Stratford-by-Bow. In 1809, he vacated his benefice on being elected principal of Brasenose College. He presided over the college for thirteen years, and took a leading part in the affairs of Oxford University. He served the office of Vice-Chancellor in 1818, and was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity, with the appurtenant canonry of Christ Church and rectory of Ewelme, in 1820. It was believed that Lord Liverpool intended Hodson for a bishopric, but he died, after a short illness, on 18 January 1822, aged 51. He was buried in the ante-chapel of Brasenose College, where he was commemorated in a Latin inscription by Edward Cardwell. Works Hodson edited Thomas Falconer's Chronological Tables, 1796. His probationary exercise as a fellow of Brasenose was published in the same year, entitled The Eternal Filiation of the Son of God asserted on the Evidence of the Sacred Scriptures, pp. 81\\\\. His only other works were three sermons published at Liverpool, and printed in 1797, 1799, and 1804. Family Hodson married, on 30 June 1808, Anne, daughter of John Dawson of Mossley Hill, Liverpool. He left four daughters and a son. His widow died on 23 April 1848.

History  Polymer Char was founded by B. Monrabal in 1992 in the Valencia Technology Park, in Spain, being registered with the name of Polymer Characterization, S.A. Its initial goal was to develop a commercial Crystallization Analysis Fractionation (CRYSTAF) instrument based on technology developed by Monrabal at Dow Chemical Company laboratories in the Netherlands to measure chemical composition distribution in semicrystalline polymers. A CRYSTAF prototype was presented at Pittcon in 1994. The first product was acquired in 1995 by a petrochemical company in South Korea. The company has also developed techniques and instruments for polymer characterization, and more specifically, for polyolefin (polyethylene and polypropylene) characterization. Polymer Char's technology is present in the petrochemical and research and development industries in over 20 countries in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.  Analytical instrumentation  The company develops analytical instruments for polymer analysis. ;Chemical composition distribution Chemical composition distribution (CCD) together with the molar mass distribution (MMD) and their interdependence define the microstructure of a polyolefin.

The band has experienced several lineup changes, with guitarist Eugen Nuțescu and keyboardist Kovács András being the only remaining members from the first lineup. Their style has varied greatly, from progressive rock with jazz and etno influences to alternative rock and indie rock (most notably after the release of their fourth studio album, Different Parties). Kumm toured in countries like Italy, Germany, Czech Republic and Hungary. They were also included in the lineup of several European festivals, such as Pepsi Sziget (in 2002 and 2008), Sárvár, 4+4 Days In Motion and Peninsula. As of February 2014, Kumm released six studio albums and eight videos. History Formation and early years (1997–1999) Kumm were formed by guitarist Eugen Nuțescu (also known as Oigăn) and keyboardist Kovács András, after the disbanding of their former musical projects, Short Cuts and Talitha Qumi. Kovács wanted to form a new band, which was supposed to be, musically speaking, a fusion between jazz, rock and ethno and asked Oigăn if he was interested to be part of his project. Shortly after, they were joined by saxophonist Meier Zsolt (a former member of Short Cuts), drummer Pap Joco, and a girl named Cilu who sang lead vocals. Their first demo was recorded in December 1997. Some of the songs from this release (such as \\"Listen to My Songs\\" and \\"Dancing On the Wires\\") were to reappear later on their debut album, while a re-recorded version of the song \\"Red Coffee\\" was included on their third studio album, Angels & Clowns. After the recording of the demo, Cilu decided to quit the band. In February 1998, the band was invited to play in a club from Cluj, called Music Pub. At that time, the band did not have a name, so the members were forced to come up with something. They chose the name Kumm, which is based on a wordplay (\\"kumm\\" means \\"sand\\" in Tatar, and its phonetic pronunciation means \\"how\\" in Romanian). Their first notable concerts took place in Cluj and Timișoara (at StudentFest). In September the band managed to release a demo, consisting on seven songs, which was entitled Listen to My Songs (Don't Listen to My Words). On 4 January 1999, the band was invited to play for the first time in Bucharest, at Lăptăria lui Enache. In March same year, after their second concert in Lăptăria lui Enache, the band met Ernesto (Mr. Scarecrow) Bianchi, who later became their manager. Afterwards, Kumm were invited to play in Hungary at an alternative rock festival at Sárvár; they also underwent their first lineup changes: in April, Pap Joco returned to his hometown, Sfântu Gheorghe, while Meier Zsolt joined the musical project of Harry Tavitian, called Orient Express. They were replaced on a temporary basis by drummer Csergö Dominic (Domi) and saxophonist Petö Zoltán (Zoli); shortly after, Domi replaced Joco definitively. Towards the end of the year, the band started the negotiations with music label Soft Records in order to prepare for recording the debut album. Moonsweat March (2000–2002) In February 2000, Kumm spent three weeks in the studio Glas Transilvan from Cluj to record their first album, entitled Moonsweat March. The album featured ten songs and a bonus track, called \\"Ce și cum\\" (Romanian for \\"What and how\\"), which was their only song with Romanian lyrics. After finishing the recording phase, saxophonist Meier Zsolt left the band and was replaced by Petö Zoltán. During the recording, Oigăn played guitar as well as bass guitar, but, as this was impossible during live shows, Kumm were soon joined by bassist Keresztes Levente. Moonsweat March was officially released in April 2000. It received the prize for the best debut album of the year 2000 from Musical Report magazine and was nominated at the category \\"Best Alternative Album\\" at the Romanian Music Awards (). During the summer, the band was invited to play at several festivals (including Sárvár, Hungary). The fall of 2000 brought them an invitation to Posada Rock Festival and the release of their first video, \\"Ce și cum\\", which was filmed by TVR2. In March 2001, Kumm composed a second song in Romanian, which was later featured on a compilation (released in June same year), that contained several tracks of other alternative rock Romanian bands, such as Nightlosers, Luna Amară or Implant Pentru Refuz. The song, which was recorded at the same time with a new version of \\"Marty\\", the fourth track from their album, was called \\"Șapte seri\\" (Romanian for \\"Seven Evenings\\"). The band also released a video for the song, which later peaked at number ten in the MCM Romania chart. During that year, Kovács and Oigăn played a few concerts with Dan Byron under the name Naked Lunch, covering songs by Led Zeppelin, Björk and Kumm. Kovács also composed and played live the music for a play entitled \\"Ithaca Dream\\". In September, the whole band appeared on stage with the actress Ramona Dumitrean in a spectacle-concert called \\"Apocalipsa dupa Martha\\" (\\"Apocalypse after Martha\\"), produced by The French Cultural Centre from Cluj. In November, Byron joined Kumm, replacing Oigăn as lead singer. His first appearance on stage with Kumm was at a gig in December. Byron and Oigăn spent some time composing the music for the short movie \\"After leaving\\", directed by C. Cârcu. After that, the band entered the studio in February 2002 to record the second studio album. Confuzz (2002–2003) The second Kumm album, Confuzz (wordplay of \\"confuz\\", the Romanian word for \\"confused\\"), was released in June 2002. Unlike their first album, Confuzz is mostly sung in Romanian. On this album, Kumm started to make the transition to alternative rock, but they kept their ethno influences and added psychedelic sounds. Following the release, the band started to promote it across the country; they also had the chance to perform at several festivals, such as Days of Cluj, Fête de la Musique (Bucharest), and, most notably, Pepsi Sziget. Furthermore, Csergö Dominic, Petö Zoltán, Oigăn and Byron appeared in a play called \\"Pâine, orbi și saxofoane\\" (Romanian for \\"Bread, blind men and saxophones\\"), for which they also wrote the music. In the fall of 2002 the band filmed their third video, for the song \\"1000 de chipuri\\" (\\"1000 Faces\\"). The video was directed by Szakáts István and featured actor Sebastian Marina. The first months of 2003 found some of the Kumm members involved in other projects. Kovács was invited to play on Luna Amară's debut album, Asfalt (Asphalt) (on a track called \\"Roșu aprins\\"), while Byron and Domi formed a new band, called Urma, with Mani Gutău as lead vocal; shortly after, they also released an album, Nomad Rhymes. In the spring, Moonsweat March and Confuzz were distributed worldwide by the French label Musea Records. In April, Kumm participated at the Iuliu Merca Festival, making their first cover of a Romanian song, Semnal M's \\"Râul\\" (\\"The River\\"). Autumn brought them a contract with the Italian label Cramps Records. Shortly after, saxophonist Petö Zoltán left the band and was replaced by Mihai Iordache (ex-Sarmalele Reci, ex- Timpuri Noi). Drummer Csergö Dominic also retired for a while, and was temporarily replaced by Lorant Antal. Following this new lineup change, the band entered the studio, recording five songs in English. Four of them were included on an EP called Yellow Fever, which was officially released on December 5 at Sala Palatului, in Bucharest. At the end of the year, they filmed their fourth video, for the song \\"Butterflies\\". Angels & Clowns and departure of Byron (2004–2005) Dan Byron (center), the lead vocal of Kumm between 2001 and 2005, performing in Sarajevo with his band byron. At the beginning of 2004, Kumm finished composing the songs for their third studio album, Angels & Clowns. The band spent the first month of spring in the studio, recording the new album. This release included the English version of \\"1000 de chipuri\\", called \\"Million Faces\\" (later the band also recorded an Italian version, \\"Mille Facce\\"), a new version of \\"Dictionary\\", a song from their debut album, with Byron singing lead vocals, and a rewritten and improved version of \\"Red Coffee\\", one of the songs from their first demo. Angels & Clowns, the title track, was the first Kumm song to reach the first place in a music chart. In the summer of 2004, the band toured Italy for the first time. At the Gondola d'Oro Festival from Venice, the song \\"Mille Facce\\" won the prize for the best rock song. After returning in Romania, bassist Keresztes Levente decided to give up on music for architecture. The new Kumm bassist, Uțu Pascu (Blazzaj/BAU) made his debut with the band at Stufstock Festival. Shortly after, the band left Romania again and spent three weeks touring in Italy. In February 2005, Kumm officially released Angels & Clowns, first in Bucharest, then in several other cities across the country. In spring, they played four gigs in Germany, where they met Anja Strub, who was later to become their manager. After performing at Peninsula Festival and Stufstock, the band returned to Germany for another concert, which was their last concert with Byron as lead singer, as he left the band in September. While trying to find a new vocal, the members of the band also found time for their own projects: Iordache appeared as guest on Luna Amară's second studio album, Loc lipsă (Missing Place), on a track called \\"Din valuri ard\\" (\\"I Burn From Waves\\") and concentrated on his jazz music project, which also featured Oigăn and Uțu Pascu, while Csergö Dominic released a new album with Urma, entitled Anger as a Gift. In November, Kumm were joined by the actor and singer Cătălin Mocan, formerly the lead vocal of the band Persona from Timișoara. Mocan was officially confirmed as the new lead singer of Kumm in January 2006. Different Parties and the tenth anniversary of the band (2006–2009) Cătălin Mocan (shown here during a 2010 Kumm concert), was confirmed as the lead singer of Kumm in January 2006. The first concerts of Kumm with the new lineup took place at the end of January 2006. In March and April the band entered the studio and recorded a fourth album, Different Parties. It was considered their most diversified album to date. Before the official release, the band made a three weeks tour of Germany, with ten concerts (last three of them in Berlin) after which they performed a few gigs in Timișoara, Arad and Oradea. The official release of the album took place in Bucharest, on June 2. In March 2007, after several gigs across the country, Kumm started their third tour of Germany, which lasted three weeks. The band performed in Berlin, Stuttgart, Ulm, Karlsruhe and Freiburg. After returning to Romania, they continued to play in different music pubs around the country and participated in the summer of 2007 to many festivals, such as Fête de la Musique, Rock'n'Coke Festival, Școala Ardeleană Festival, Cramps Festival and Peninsula. On October 29, 2007, Kumm celebrated their ten years anniversary with a concert held at the Romanian Opera, KUMM – 10 ani și 1000 de Chipuri (KUMM – 10 Years and 1000 Faces). They invited Luna Amară, Timpuri Noi, ZOB, Travka, Ada Milea and The MOOoD to perform as guests. Each of these bands performed a song on their own and a Kumm song. The former members of the band participated as well. On the same occasion, Kumm also released a box-set entitled Lo-Fi Poetry, with songs, pictures and rare recordings from their ten years of musical activity. In December, bassist Uțu Pascu left the band, and was replaced in January 2008 by Sorin Erhan (Firma, Urma). On August 16, 2008, Kumm performed at the Sziget Festival, being the only Romanian band invited. It was their second performance at Sziget. On March 6, 2009, Oigăn released Sex With Onions, his first solo album, and, according to his own words, his last. The official release was celebrated with a gig at Silver Church. Mihai Iordache, Csergö Dominic, Alexei \\"Alioșa\\" Țurcan (ex-Travka), Andrei Filip (Timpuri Noi, L'Orchestre de Roche, The Mono Jacks, RedRum) and Forrest (ZOB) appeared as guests. The album received favorable reviews. On 12 March 2009, Kumm received the prize for Best Rock on 2008 from the magazine Actualitatea Muzicală (Musical Actuality). On 30 May 2009, it was officially confirmed that drummer Csergö Dominic was not part of Kumm anymore, and had been replaced by Paul Ballo (Go to Berlin, The Amsterdams). Later, Oigăn talked about how they acquired their new drummer: \\"We made a list with several drummers we liked, we saw him at a live concert, and after that, due to the Mafia that exists on Romanian music scene, where everybody knows everybody, we got his phone number, we met in a bar, he came to an audition and we chose him because he's really talented and very funny.\\" Far From Telescopes (2009–2011) Kovács András of Kumm playing at the official release of the \\"Pop Song\\" video from the Far From Telescopes album in Silver Church, Bucharest. On August 14, 2009, Kumm released the video for the song \\"Morsa\\" (translation: \\"Walrus\\") during a concert in El Grande Comandante. The English version of the song, \\"Man in a Can\\", was to appear on their fifth studio album. On October 22 the band announced in a press conference at Clubul Țăranului Român the release of their fifth studio album, Far From Telescopes, which took place on October 30, 2009, at the Silver Church Club in Bucharest. Far From Telescopes was produced under their own license. The recordings were made at the Vița de Vie studio, with Gabi \\"Pipai\\" Andrieș as sound engineer. The mastering was made by Mastervargas Studio, New York City. The album appeared on iTunes on January 11, 2010. The title was explained by Oigăn in an interview: \\"It was really difficult for us to find a name. We broke a lot of deadlines, the album almost failed to be produced, yet we couldn't decide. At the end, right when we were playing the lo-fi songs, Cătălin sang that line and we all felt that this was describing the serious part of the album as well as its playful part.\\" The album featured Rozie, a good friend of the band, as guest vocalist on \\"Pink Balloon\\" and the Meloritm children choir on \\"Fishing in the Swimming Pool\\"; furthermore, their ex-singer Byron was also invited as backing vocalist on \\"Mister Superman\\". The band added three lo-fi recordings on the album: one of them at the beginning, before the song \\"Mister Superman\\", the second towards the middle of the album (the song \\"Bad Day\\", which is the only lo-fi song that has a title and appears on track list) and the third as hidden track, after the end of the last song, \\"Fishing in the Swimming Pool\\". Singer Cătălin Mocan came up with this idea: \\"These are recorded in a kitchen. We're really aboulic, we contradict each other a lot, so we had a lot of songs we had to give up on. I felt a little bit sorry for some of the songs we gave up. So I came up with this lo-fi idea, and that's how I convinced my mates to put on the album the songs I particularly liked. That's how 'Bad Day' entered the album.\\" Most of the reviews were positive. A critic called Far From Telescopes \\"perhaps the most mature and professional Kumm album\\" In December, the first single, \\"Pop Song\\", peaked at number 1 in Radio Guerrilla's Top Show. Kumm playing at Jukebox Club in Bucharest. Left from right: Mihai Iordache, Oigăn, Cătălin Mocan. At the beginning of 2010, Kumm changed their lineup again. On 17 February they announced bassist Sorin Erhan was replaced by Alexandru Miu (Go to Berlin). Meanwhile, Paul Ballo composed and released \\"Chroma\\", the first song of his new project, Hot Casandra – during the year, this was to be followed by a few more songs. In March their song \\"Police\\" was aired on Radio Guerrilla, entering on seventh place in Top Show and reaching first place two weeks later. In April, Paul Ballo and his ex-bandmate from Go to Berlin, Matei Țeposu started a new electronic music project, called Trouble Is. On April 22, 2010, Kumm released their sixth video, \\"Pop Song\\", at a concert held in Silver Church Club, Bucharest. On September 25, drummer Paul Ballo announced on his Facebook page that he was not part of Kumm anymore. His statement was confirmed indirectly by the band two days later, on September 27, when the new Kumm site was launched. A new lineup appeared on the site, with new drummer John Ciurea (formerly with Tep Zepi). The next day, on September 28, Kumm announced the lineup change on their Facebook and Twitter pages. The first gig with the new drummer took place in Lăptăria lui Enache, on October 2. In an interview which appeared on October 5, Ballo talked about the whole situation, explaining that he knew that at a certain point he would have left the band, but he didn't expect to be fired. He cited as a possible reason for separation the fact that he was also involved in other projects, so his bandmates believed that he was not paying enough attention to the band. The ex-drummer said that he thought at certain moments that, musically speaking, the band was somehow stagnating, adding \\"I did not have time to get involved in the (album) production, especially the sound of my drums. That was a reason for me to complain, because I wasn't quite satisfied with the drum sound, and they disagreed with me.\\" In the same interview, Paul Ballo also talked about his own musical projects, specifying that he wanted to release a video with Trouble Is and continue as a drummer in Go to Berlin. In December 2010, Radio Guerrilla started to air the song \\"Beautiful Country\\", which soon reached the first place in the Top Show. In March 2011, Kumm announced on their Facebook official page the departure of Alexandru Miu and the returning of Uțu Pascu, stating: \\"Our new bassist is our old one\\". No further explanations were given. Fifteenth anniversary of the band, departure of Cătălin Mocan and A Mysterious Place Called Somewhere (2011–2014) Kumm performing in Colectiv Club, March 2014. Left from right: Mihai Iordache, Oigăn, John Ciurea, Ana- Cristina Leonte, Uțu Pascu, Kovács András. On June 3, the band released a new song, called \\"Foul Play\\", during a concert in Clubul Țăranului Român. The song was aired for the first time at Radio Guerrilla, on June 7. \\"Foul Play\\" was also launched on the internet, as a free download. In October 2011, the band toured Germany and Switzerland. In November, Kumm released a new single called \\"Eskimo\\", during a campaign entitled \\"Where Do Broken Hearts Go? By Kumm\\". The campaign debuted with a contest for fans, who had to send an email with the answer to the question \\"Where do broken hearts go?\\", thus having the chance to win a special prize offered by the band. A national tour followed soon after. In 2012, Kumm celebrated their fifteenth anniversary with a national tour, \\"Kumm 15 ani\\" (\\"Kumm 15 Years\\"). The first two concerts were held in Cluj (October 19, Flying Circus Pub) and Bucharest (November 1, Silver Church). Both concerts featured byron as opening act; ex-members of Kumm Dan Byron and Csergö Dominic performed as guests with the band. The Bucharest concert also featured Mani Gutău from Urma and Artanu'. On January 22, 2013, the band announced on their Facebook page the departure of their lead singer Cătălin Mocan and their decision to continue as a five piece band, with Oigăn assuming Mocan's vocal duties. Kumm also confirmed that they were working on their sixth studio album. The first concert with the new lineup was held in Flying Circus Pub, Cluj, on February 1; the band performed with Călina Curticăpean as guest vocalist, and kept touring with her for a while. On May 17, Kumm released a video for the song \\"Să nu spui nimănui\\" (Romanian for \\"Don't tell anyone\\"), produced by Kovács András. The song featured Călina Curticăpean at vocals and was the band's first song in Romanian since \\"Morsa\\". During the summer of 2013, jazz musician Ana-Cristina Leonte joined the live lineup of the band, replacing Curticăpean as guest vocalist.

Mission Druid Heights was a bohemian community on the southeast flank of Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, California, about a mile from the Pacific Ocean. It was founded by carpenter Roger Somers and poet Elsa Gidlow, along with their partners on five acres of a former chicken ranch.

It was created on 21 November 2010 through the merger of the municipalities of Medeglia, Bironico, Camignolo, Rivera and Sigirino. History Medeglia is first mentioned in 1195 as Medellia. Bironico is first mentioned in 1296 as Bironico. Camignolo is first mentioned in 1296 as Camigiollo. Rivera is first mentioned in 1296 as Sorenzino. In 1348 it was mentioned as Rivera. Sigirino is first mentioned in 1335 as Sezelino. Medeglia Medeglia village During the High Middle Ages, Medeglia was probably part of the old valley community of Carvina which eventually came under the authority of Lugano. In 1501-03 Medeglia and Isone were transferred to the county of Bellinzona, but they remained part of the pieve of Agno. It became part of the parish of Bironico in the 13th century. Then, in 1585, it became the center of a vice parish. It finally broke away from the old parish and became a full parish in 1888. The parish church of St. Bartholomew was first mentioned in 1328. The romanesque core of the church was renovated and rebuilt in the 15th and 17th centuries. The local economy of the village was based on animal husbandry and forestry. Starting in the 16th century the residents of Isone and Medeglia bought forests and pastures as far away as Robasacco, Contone, Cadenazzo, Sant'Antonino and Camorino while at the same time opening up trade relations with Bellinzona. To escape poverty and limited farm land, in the 19th century many inhabitants emigrated. The majority of these emigrants moved to Argentina and California. The mountain pastures of Medeglia were classified in 1996 as a wetland of national importance. In 2000, three-quarters of the working population worked outside the municipality. Bironico Rivera-Bironico train station By 1000, Bironico was the secular and religious center of the Carvina region, which included the middle and upper Vedeggio valley. In the Early Middle Ages it was under the authority of the bishop of Como. Eventually the rights to over the village were acquired by the city of Como. At the end of the 13th century, the Rusca, a noble family from Como, lived in the community. After living in the village for a time, them moved into Bironico Castle in 1328. They remained in the owners of the castle until 1416. After the Swiss Confederation invasion, Bironico became a local administrative center. Beginning in the 16th century, an inn at the bridge over the Leguana river served as a meeting place of the Confederation's ministers. The parish church of St. Martin was first mentioned in 1267. Historically, the local economy relied on traditional alpine agriculture. During the 19th century poverty and limited farm land encouraged many residents to emigrate. Today there is some industry in the village, but most workers commute to jobs in the lower Vedeggio valley, Lugano and Bellinzona. Camignolo In the Middle Ages Camignolo was part of the parish of Bironico and valley community of Valle Carvina. One of the major landholders in the village was the Como Cathedral. The village was home to the San Ambrogio castle by 1348. Very little is known about the castle, but it was probably destroyed by the Swiss Confederation in the 16th century. It became a vice-parish under Bironico in 1670, and then broke away to become a full parish in 1809. The parish church of S. Pietro e Paolo is first mentioned in the 15th century. It was rebuilt to its current appearance in 1670. The chapel of St. Ambrogio was probably built in the 10th-century, but it first appears in records from 1348. The interior of the chapel is richly decorated with 15th century and late Romanesque frescoes. It was restored in 1976-79. The village is still mostly agrarian though there has been some industrialization. Like other communities in the valley, during the 19th century many residents emigrated to escape the poverty and limited farm land. It has slowly developed into a minor regional center and a secondary school was built in the village. Rivera The church of Santa Maria degli Angeli was built on the Alpa Foppa meadow above Riveria. The oldest traces of a settlement in the area include scattered artifacts and graves from the Iron Age and the Roman era. In the Middle Ages, Rivera was part of the valley community of Carvina. In the 13th century Como Cathedral possessed estates in Sorencino. Starting in 1678, representatives from the twelve members of the Swiss Confederation in Ticino met in Casa dei landfogti before they assembled in Lugano. Rivera was a member of the parish of Bironico, before it became an independent parish in 1754. From 1779 until 1793, the parish church of S. Spirito was rebuilt. The villagers earned their living from agriculture, mostly through traditional alpine farming and herding. During construction of the Ceneri tunnel in 1872-82, the population increased sharply. The completion of the road in 1811 and the construction of the tunnel and the station led to the emergence of a new district in the flatter part of the valley. This area forms the northern boundary of the agglomeration of Lugano. The base station of the Monte Tamaro gondola opened in 1972 in Rivera. Sigirino In the Middle Ages, Sigirino belonged to the territory of the Carvina valley community. In a land register of 1296, Como Cathedral was the major landholder in Sigirino.

Pre-war career He was born in Skjeberg, and had middle school education and petty officer training. He joined the Labour Party in 1923. In the same year he was hired in the office of the newspaper Østfold Arbeiderblad, where he started a journalistic career in 1924 as subeditor. He later worked for Arbeiderbladet in the years leading up to World War II. In Østfold Brandstorp chaired the Østfold District of Workers' Sports from 1927 to 1929, and was a national board member of Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund. He represented Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund at the Fourth Congress of the Red Sport International in 1928, together with Thorvald Olsen, Thor Jørgensen, Natvig Pedersen and Eigil Eriksen. Brandstorp was elected to the Red Sport International executive committee, replacing Thor Jørgensen. He supported the membership of Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund in the Red Sport International at the time. However, in the spring of 1929, Brandstorp wrote an article in Den Røde Ungdom where he suggested that AIF should withdraw from the Red Sport International. He was now afraid that worker-sportsmen in Norway viewed the Red Sport International as a communist organization and thus refrained from participating in workers' sports. The article sparked a debate, and at a Red Sport International executive plenary meeting in Kharkov in May-June, in which Brandstorp participated, he was ordered to resign from the executive committee. Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund interpreted this move as an ultimatum. The November 1929 national convention of Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund voted in favour of retaining membership in the Red Sport International, but demanded that the International would not interfere in the links between Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund and the Labour Party and Norwegian Trade Union Confederation. According to the decision passed at the conference, Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund became subordinated to these two bodies. Brandstorp was elected new editor of the workers' sports magazine Arbeideridrett. Arbeideridrett' went defunct in 1930. From 1931 he was an office manager in Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund. A communist workers' sports federation, Kampforbundet for Rød Sportsenhet, was eventually formed in Norway. Brandstorp participated in merger negotiations between Arbeidernes Idrettsforbund and Kampforbundet for Rød Sportsenhet in 1933. Also in 1933, Arbeideridrett resurfaced as a monthly magazine with Brandstorp as editor. It finally ceased publication in January 1935. World War II During the war, and the German occupation of Norway, Brandstorp was a member of Milorg. He was also involved with Hjemmefrontens Ledelse. He was arrested by Gestapo, but managed to flee to Sweden where he was a secretary in the Norwegian legation in Stockholm from 1944 to 1945. Post-war career After the war Brandstorp was hired in the Norwegian Ministry of Defence. He held the military rank of Colonel when he in 1947 became the first leader of Forsvarets undervisnings- og velferdskorps, an organization for the general well-being of military servicemen off duty. In 1946 he had chaired a committee that looked into whether this was needed, and he was later a member of other committees. He left in 1962, and worked for the Norwegian Armed Forces Museum for a short time before dying in late 1963.

His last years were plagued by ill health: he suffered agonies from kidney stones, and his death was caused by an accidental drug overdose, which he took in an effort to relieve the chronic pain.As reported by The North-British Intelligencer October 1776 Family Yorke was born in Northampton, son of the Reverend John Yorke. The future Lord Chancellor, Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, was his cousin. William, unlike Philip, is said to have been only a mediocre lawyer, who owed his career advancement largely to his family connections. He was educated at the Charterhouse and the University of CambridgeBall, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 London John Murray 1926 Vol. 2 p.207 and was called to the Bar about 1723. Not much is recorded about his legal practice: in 1743 he was appointed a judge of the Irish Court of Common Pleas.Ball Judges in Ireland p.207 Career Yorke found life in Ireland agreeable, writing enthusiastic letters to his friends at home about the warmth of Irish hospitality and the civilised conversation he enjoyed there. For his Chief, Henry Singleton, he had the greatest regard both as man and judge, and their personal ties were strengthened in 1744 when Yorke married Singleton's widowed niece Charity Cope, the daughter of Henry's brother Rowland Singleton, vicar of Termonfeckin, County Louth, and his wife Elizabeth Graham. Charity brought him a comfortable fortune, with which he bought Rathmines Old Castle from the Temple family, and rebuilt it.No trace of Rathmines Castle remains today, but it probably stood at the site of present- day Palmerston Park, Rathmines- see Deirdre Kelly Four Roads to Dublin O'Brien Press 1995 As Singleton's health began to fail, Yorke nudged him gently towards retirement: in 1753 Singleton stepped down as Chief Justice, and was replaced by Yorke; soon afterwards Singleton accepted the sinecure of Master of the Rolls in Ireland. Ironically, having worked so hard to become Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, Yorke found that he was unsuited to the office. In particular, like many judges in Ireland at the time, he found going on assize an ordeal, and he may already have begun to suffer from the kidney stones which caused him such agony in later life. Even before Singleton died in 1759 Yorke was hoping to take his place – in the end he settled for another sinecure, Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland.London Chronicle 31 March 1761 In 1761 he was created a Baronet, of Dublin.leighrayment.com Baronetcies: Yarrow to Yule He resigned as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1763 and retired to England shortly afterwards.Ball Judges in Ireland p.207 Death He died at Brentford in 1776: Elrington Ball has an interesting reference to the cause of death as \\"accidental poisoning\\".Ball, F. Elrington Judges in Ireland p.207 A contemporary newspaper report elaborates the story, and states that the poisoning was the result of an unfortunate mistake by his servant. Yorke, who was suffering agonies from a kidney stone, had been prescribed laudanum (liquid opium) to alleviate the pain. Although the servant had been instructed by the apothecary as to the proper dosage, on the day in question he evidently forgot his instructions, and simply handed a full bottle of laudanum to Yorke, who was in such pain from his kidney stone that he drank it all at one sitting. He died an hour later from the effects of the overdose.The North- British Intelligencer October 1776 His widow died in 1779, aged 72.\\"Historical Account of Charter-House\\" London 1808  References  English politicians Chancellors of the Exchequer of Ireland People educated at Charterhouse School Alumni of the University of Cambridge 1776 deaths 1700 births Baronets in the Baronetage of Ireland William Members of the Privy Council of Ireland People from Northampton Deaths by poisoning Chief Justices of the Irish Common Pleas ","title":"Sir William Yorke, 1st Baronet"},{"id":"30008800","text":"Heinz Hildebrandt (born February 13, 1943) is a Danish former football player and manager.

She is best known for guitar compositions, many of them for the distinguished Japanese guitarist (also her husband) Kazuhito Yamashita, and organizes the guitar quintet that bears his name. She has twice won the Otaka Prize. Career After graduating at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, she completed her postgraduate studies at the same institution. Support from the Asian Cultural Council resulted in a residency in New York for several months in 1992-93, where she returned in 1998 to premiere In Their Shoes, a music and dance collaboration. From 1998-1999 she served as composer-in-residence for Orchestra Ensemble Kanazawa. Her commissions include Academic Festival Overture for the hundredth anniversary of Kyoto University, the double concerto Kyoto: Reverberation for the Kyoto Protocol Treaty in 1997, and Piano Concerto No.1 \\"Memories of January\\" composed for the seventieth anniversary of the Japan Music Competition in 2001. Fujiie was asked to write the compulsory piece for participants in the Fifth Musashino-Tokyo International Organ Competition of 2004, and At the Tomb of Fra Angelico for Organ and Orchestra (also a commission) was composed to be performed by the winner of this same competition in 2006. Her Guitar Concerto No.3 \\"Autumn Reverie\\" was premiered in Seoul, 2011. Kazuhito Yamashita Family Quintet Since 2001, a major focus for Fujiie has been organizing the guitar quintet Kazuhito Yamashita Family Quintet, for which she also composes. Kasane is their main repertoire and typifies the music of a bygone era. This quintet seeks to revive the quintessential and older musical traditions of both Europe and Japan when such music was known and valued, and whose echoes can still be heard in the classic Japanese 11th century novel The Tale of Genji. In this piece, four guitars, multi-layering with shifting tonal colors, represent the various plucked stringed instruments of old Japan. Recent repertoire especially written for the quintet includes A Cantastoria of One Thousand and One Nights for five guitars, Suicho-Tsushimanoraku for three guitars, vocals and stones, and Morokoshi ni tsukawasu tsukai no fune Naniwa yori izuru toki haha ga ko ni okureru uta for vocal, 5 guitars and Japanese Bugaku dance. This last piece accords to the poetry sung by the mother of one of the members of a ship used on a Japanese mission to Tang dynasty China which departed in the year 733 AD. She composed this poetry on seeing her son off at Naniwa-kyō port, calling to a skein of cranes in the sky to ask to warm the traveler whenever there was a layer of frost on the field. Fujiie has made three CDs with the Kazuhito Yamashita Family Quintet and has been invited along with them to many music festivals such as the Rome International Guitar Festival in 2004, the Cordoba Guitar Festival in 2007 and 2011, the Open Guitar Festival 2011 in the Czech Republic and others. Keiko also composes for orchestra and choir and has also written chamber music and opera. One area of interest is the Gagaku ancient court music in Japan, which she researches, also composing for this instrumental ensemble. Recognition Fujiie was presented with the Kenzo Nakajima Award in 1996 for her monologue opera Nina de Cera. She is among the very few Japanese composers to have twice won the Otaka Prize awarded by the NHK Symphony Orchestra for the previous year's outstanding composition; in 1995 for Beber for orchestra and in 2000 for Guitar Concerto No. 2 Koisucho.

It is an aquatic plant native to marine environments on the coastlines of mostly northern sections of North America and Eurasia. Distribution This species is the most wide-ranging marine flowering plant in the Northern Hemisphere.den Hartog, C. (1970). The seagrasses of the world. Verh K Ned Ak Wet Adf North-Holland, Amsterdam 59: 1-275. - in Möller, T. Zostera marina (Linnaeus 1753), Eelgrass (Angiospermophyta). Helsinki Commission: Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission. It lives in cooler ocean waters in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and in the warmer southern parts of its range it dies off during warmer seasons.Flora of North America It grows in the Arctic region and endures several months of ice cover per year.Borum J., et al., (Eds.) (2004.) European seagrasses: an introduction to monitoring and management. European Union: Monitoring & Managing of European Seagrasses. It is the only seagrass known from Iceland. It can be found in bays, lagoons, estuaries, on beaches, and in other coastal habitat. The several ecotypes each have specific habitat requirements. It occurs in calmer waters in the sublittoral zone, where it is rarely exposed to air. It anchors via rhizomes in sandy or muddy substrates and its leaves catch particulate debris in the water which then collects around the bases of the plants, building up the top layer of the seabed. Description and reproduction This flowering plant is a rhizomatous herb which produces a long stem with hairlike green leaves that measure up to 1.2 cm wide and may reach over 1.0 m long. It is a perennial plant, but it may grow as an annual. The rhizome grows horizontally through the substrate, anchoring via clusters of roots at nodes. The plant is monoecious, with an individual bearing both male and female flowers in separate alternating clusters. The inflorescence is about 10 cm long.Parnell, J. and Curtis, T. 2012. Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press The fruit is a nutlet with a transparent coat containing the seed. The plant can also undergo vegetative reproduction, sprouting repeatedly from its rhizome and spreading into a meadow-like colony on the seabed known as a genet.Fonseca, M., et al. (2003). NOAA joint pilot project on eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) recovery in San Francisco Bay. NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science. One meadow of cloned eelgrass was determined to be 3000 years old, genetically. When undergoing sexual reproduction, the plant produces large quantities of seeds, at times numbering several thousand seeds per square meter of plants. The plant disperses large distances when its stems break away and carry the fertile seeds to new areas, eventually dropping to the seabed. The seagrass is a favorite food of several species of waterfowl, which may also distribute the seeds. Ecology This Zostera grows in muddy and sandy shores only at and below spring tides. This plant is an important member of the coastal ecosystem in many areas because it helps to physically form the habitat and it plays a crucial role for many other species.Wyllie- Echeverria, S. and M. Fonseca. (2003). Eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) in San Francisco Bay, California from 1920 to the present. NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science. For example, it provides a sheltered spawning ground for the Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). Juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) hide in eelgrass beds as they grow.Hanson, A. R. (2004). Status and conservation of eelgrass (Zostera marina) in eastern Canada. Canadian Wildlife Service Technical Report Series #412. The blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) attaches to its leaves. The green alga Entocladia perforans, an endophyte, depends on this eelgrass.UK Marine Special Areas of Conservation A great many animals use the plant for food, including the isopod Idotea chelipes and the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. The Atlantic brant (Branta bernicula hrota) subsists almost entirely on the plant. When the eelgrass dies, detaches, and washes up on the beach, a whole new ecosystem is founded; many species of insects and other invertebrates begin to inhabit the dead plant, including the amphipod Talitrus saltator, the fly Fucellia tergina, and the beetles Stenus biguttatus, Paederus littoralis, and Coccinella septempunctata.Jedrzejczak, M.

Granulosicoccus coccoides sp. nov., isolated from leaves of seagrass (Zostera marina). Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 60 972-76. Threats Populations of the plant have been damaged by a number of processes, especially increased turbidity in the water; like most other plants, eelgrass requires sunlight to grow. One plant may adapt to light level by growing longer leaves to reach the sun in low-light areas; individuals in clear or shallow water may have leaves a few centimeters long, while individuals in deeper spots may have leaves over a meter long. Human activities such as dredging and trawling damage eelgrass meadows; practices used in scallop and mussel harvesting in the Wadden Sea have cleared much eelgrass from the sea bottom there. Aquaculture operations and coastal development destroy colonies. Pollution from many sources, including riverside farms, sewage lines, fish processing plants, and oil spills, damage eelgrass meadows. Conservation and restoration efforts of Zostera marina habitats have been plenty since their rapid decline started several decades ago. Invasive species have been shown to have a negative effect on eelgrass and associated ecosystems. In Nova Scotia, the invasive exotic green crab (Carcinus maenas) destroys eelgrass when it digs in the substrate for prey items, or by directly eating eelgrass seeds. The decline of eelgrass in Antigonish Harbour has resulted in fewer Canada geese, which feed on the rhizome, and fewer common goldeneye, which eat invertebrates that live in eelgrass meadows. The slime mold Labyrinthula zosterae caused a \\"wasting disease\\" of eelgrass resulting in large-scale losses in the 1930s; localized populations are still affected by the slime mold today. During this time, populations of the eelgrass-eating Atlantic brant dropped. Remaining geese ate less-preferred food plants and algae, and hunters subsequently noticed that brant meat began to taste different. Even today, brants no longer migrate over the Nova Scotia area.  Genomics and evolutionary adaptations  The Zostera marina genome has been sequenced and analyzed by Olsen et al. in 2016 and the resulting article has been published in Nature. The approximate genome sequence of Z. marina is 202.3 Mb and encodes approximately 20450 protein-coding genes (of which 86,6% are supported by transcriptome data). The assembled genome was found to consist of large numbers of repeat elements accounting for 63% of the assembled genome. The researchers revealed key adaptations at the molecular biological level that have occurred during evolution of Z. marina, an angiosperm that has adopted a marine lifestyle. Genome analysis revealed that Z. marina lost the entire repertoire of stomatal genes, genes involved in volatile compound biosynthesis and signaling (such as ethylene and terpenoids) as well as genes for ultraviolet protection and phytochromes used for far-red sensing. Besides these gene losses, also gene gain events have been described, mostly involving the adjustment to full salinity and ion homeostasis. Also macro-algae like cell wall components (low-methylated polyanionic pectins and sulfated galatans) have been described, unique for Z. marina compared to other angiosperms. Human uses People have long used this plant species as roof thatching in some areas. It has been used as fertilizer and cattle fodder in Norway for centuries.Alm, T. (2003).

He is best known for the Fabergé Museum in Baden-Baden, which is the first private Russian-owned museum outside of Russia. Ivanov has no business holdings or interests, but the value of his massive art collection makes him a billionaire. In spring 2010, he said that a Middle Eastern collector offered him $2 billion for his Fabergé collection, the world's largest Fabergé jewellery collection with more than 3,000 items. Ivanov's tastes extend to many areas, and he also collects dinosaur fossils, ancient Greek and Roman art, pre-Columbian gold, Old Master paintings, Impressionist paintings, Orthodox icons, and he also has one of the finest collections of vintage automobiles. Ivanov's most significant purchase was the 1902 Fabergé egg made as an engagement gift to Baron Édouard de Rothschild. Ivanov bought it at Christie's in London on November 28, 2007, for 9 million pounds ($18.5 million at the time), because he thought that it is Fabergé’s \\"finest ever.\\"Ivanov Vies Faberge, Boosts $2 Billion Museum Collection, Bloomberg  Early life and career  Born in Pskov, Russian SFSR, in 1962, Ivanov served in the Soviet Navy before making his studies in Moscow, eventually graduating in Law from Moscow State University. In the late 1980s, as the Soviet Union began to allow some capitalism, Ivanov was one of the first Russian businessmen to start trading in computers, and he quickly built up a successful and lucrative business. He began collecting Fabergé eggs and other art soon afterwards, because he had bags full of cash that he didn't know what to do with. Despite the minor relaxation of state repression under Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet society remained a place of severe restrictions, and terrible deficits of all consumer goods. Alexander Ivanov is also an artist, pioneering his own form of abstract painting that utilizes geometric images create with extremely vibrant colors whose pigments are partly made from very expensive and rare minerals. The presence of such precious ingredients is one reason that his first painting sold at auction went for 60 000 pounds at Bonhams on December 1, 2010 in London. , Bonhams  Activities as art collector   Fabergé Museum  In May 2009 Ivanov opened the Fabergé Museum in the German spa city of Baden-Baden. Besides the Rothschild Faberge Egg, other items in the museum collection include a rare silver decanter in the form of a rabbit, and Karelian Birch, the last Imperial Easter Egg, made of Karelian birch with gold and diamonds for Easter 1917. Czar Nicholas II, however, was deposed before he could give it to his mother. When Ivanov first bought the Karelian egg, some experts resisted because its existence wasn't known previously. Ivanov now has a convincing group of documents that his researchers found in the Russian state archives, proving that the egg is genuine. It has been shown at a number of major international exhibitions and is now accepted by scholars, he says.Ivanov Reveals $1.5 Billion Faberge Surprise for Germany , Bloomberg Ivanov said his museum building cost about 17 million euros to buy and renovate, including a 1 million euro security system. He chose Baden-Baden, near Germany's western border, because it's \\"close to France, a resort for the rich, and historically it has always been the most popular resort for Russians.\\" He has stated that the local government has been supportive. Peter Carl Fabergé was official supplier to the Russian Imperial court from 1885 to 1917. It also catered to the growing demand for luxury items from the Russian Empire's newly rich as the economy boomed in the two decades before World War I. In addition to Easter eggs, Fabergé made a wide range of jewelry and decorative artworks, the most famous of which are semi- precious stone and jeweled figures of people, animals, and vases with flowers. The company had international brand recognition, with a shop in London, and among its international customers were the Queen of England, and the King of Siam (now Thailand). After 1917 Bolshevik revolutionaries began to sell off Imperial treasures, and Fabergé's artworks became popular with American collectors, first with Armand Hammer in the 1920s, and then later with Malcolm Forbes in the 1960s. When Russian billionaires appeared on the market in the early 2000s, prices soared to record levels. Ivanov said another reason why he opened the museum in Germany was security. He told Britain's The Independent newspaper: \\"It's very difficult [in Russia] because of all the administrative barriers. You have to be indebted to someone, and you can never feel that your collection is safe – not from the state, not from bandits, not from anyone. In Germany we spend serious money on security of course, but at least you know that the state itself won't do anything.\\" In April 2009, just a month before the opening of the Fabergé Museum, a company called Fabergé Ltd., registered in the Cayman Islands, filed a lawsuit against the Fabergé Museum claiming it owned the rights to all things named \\"Fabergé\\". This legal action made the Fabergé Museum's first year a difficult one because the museum was barred from using the Fabergé name, which meant no advertising or even a sign on the door. In January 2010, a German court upheld the Fabergé Museum's right to use its name. In December 2014, Russia's President Vladimir Putin gifted the Rothschild Egg to the State Hermitage Museum. Days before this gift was made, British and German Customs officers raided the Faberge Museum looking for the egg. The museum said that the officers' actions were politically motivated, coming amid tensions between the West and Russia, and hoping to ruin the gift ceremony and embarrass Russia's head of state.

However, the goods yard had since been dismantled and replaced by a parking lot for RFI and Trenitalia employees, and the goods shed had been converted to storage. The architecture of the former goods shed is very similar to that of other Italian railway stations. There is also a small one-storey building that housed the station chapel. All of the station buildings are rectangular in shape. The station yard comprises three tracks. Each of them has a platform sheltered by a canopy. The platforms are connected by an underpass. Passenger and train movements The station had about 600,000 passenger movements each year. It was served by both regional and InterCity trains. The main destinations of passengers embarking at the station were Ventimiglia, Genoa and Milano Centrale. Train services The station was last served by the following service(s): *EuroCity services (Thello) Marseille - Cannes - Nice - Monaco - Ventimiglia - Genoa - Milan Interchange In the square in front of the station, there were bus stops for the following lines: * Sanremo-Andora (public transport by Riviera Trasporti); * Imperia's urban service.

The sweep of the narrow beam thus produced gives the flashing effect. Aerobeacons were originally developed for aviation use, most familiarly as aerodrome beacons, but they also saw extensive use in lighthouses. They were far cheaper to manufacture and maintain than classic glass Fresnel lenses, and more rugged; and they could be mounted exposed to the weather. Historic models include the DCB-24, which used a single parabolic reflector; the DCB-224, a double-beamed version of the DCB-24; and the DCB-36, which used a system of plastic Fresnel lenses.

A boy, about 3-years of age, appeared to him and said, \\"Your faith in Aso God is very deep, and you are going to Aso in spite of heavy snow.

It is a composite basketball statistic that is derived from basic individual statistics: points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers and shot attempts. The efficiency stat, in theory, accounts for both a player's offensive contributions (points, assists) and their defensive contributions (steals, blocks), but it is generally thought that efficiency ratings favor offense-oriented players over those who specialize in defense, as defense is difficult to quantify with currently tabulated statistics. NBA EFF The NBA publishes online all of the basic statistics recorded officially by the league. Individual player efficiency is expressed there by a stat referred to as 'efficiency' and abbreviated EFF. It is derived by a simple formula: : The formula was created by Kansas City sports reporter and statistician Martin Manley. DPR DPR (short for Defensive Player Rating) is a stat that shows the Defensive prowess of a player showing their in game ability and defensive impact to their team by using a per game formula that equates for the amount of time spent on the court and taking into account position competition pace and era as well as other factors. This is the formula: (Player spg+ Player bpg/team minutes played)-(times blown by*Pace of Players Era)* Total Average of Possessions+( Players DRTG*Team Pace)/Total number of years played PER The most commonly used alternative to the EFF is the player efficiency rating developed by ESPN basketball statistician John Hollinger. It is denoted as PER, and is derived by a very complex calculation designed to compensate for different teams' varying style of play, among other factors. PER scores do not differ markedly from EFF scores, but player rankings will not be the same in both systems. A PER of 15 is considered average across the entire league (not true of EFF), and serves as a simple benchmark against which any player may be quickly compared to indicate his approximate net worth to an NBA franchise. Teams intending to compete for the championship typically seek to enlist at least two star players with high efficiency ratings above the low twenties. A PER of 30 over a span of more than a few games is considered exceptionally high. According to the modified PER formula used at Basketball-Reference.com, the highest PER ever achieved over an entire single season in the NBA was 31.90 by Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2019–20. Wilt Chamberlain held the distinction of being the only player with a PER over 30 over an entire single season for 2½ decades, after having a PER of 31.84 in 1962–63. No other player surpassed 30 until Michael Jordan in 1987–88 with a PER of 31.71. Since then, Jordan repeated the accomplishment three more times, and the milestone has also since been eclipsed by David Robinson, Stephen Curry, Shaquille O'Neal (three times), Tracy McGrady, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James (four times) and Anthony Davis. No PER statistics are available pre-1951–52 as the 'minutes played' statistic was first recorded during that season. Some currently active NBA players known for consistently high efficiency ratings include, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Kevin Durant, and Dwight Howard. Player efficiency rating NBA records: * Highest career player efficiency rating: Michael Jordan (27.91) * Highest single-season player efficiency rating: Giannis Antetokounmpo (31.90 in 2019–20) * Highest career playoff player efficiency rating: Michael Jordan (28.60) * Highest single-season playoff player efficiency rating: Hakeem Olajuwon (38.96 in 1988)  EuroLeague and EuroCup  The EuroLeague, its second-tier level competition, the EuroCup, and several European national domestic leagues, use a different type of formula to determine the ratings and efficiency of players, called the performance index rating (PIR): *\`(Points + Rebounds + Assists + Steals + Blocks + Fouls Drawn) - (Missed Field Goals + Missed Free Throws + Turnovers + Shots Rejected + Fouls Committed).\` See also * Player efficiency rating * Offense efficiency rating * Basketball statistics * Fantasy basketball * Advanced statistics in basketball * True shooting percentage References External links * Career efficiency leaders from Basketball-Reference.com * Efficiency (EFF) leaderboard from NBA.com * Basketball terminology Basketball statistics ","title":"Efficiency (basketball)"},{"id":"30009053","title":"Bodybuilding at the 2010 Asian Beach Games"},{"id":"30009055","text":"Cricket in the Cayman Islands is an established sport.

It first became organised in the Cayman Islands from 1940 and was contested between the districts of West Bay and George Town. By the 1970 the game became structured and more organised, starting with 5 teams and the construction of the Smith Road Oval. The rapid growth of the economy of the Cayman Islands saw many expatriates move to the islands, with them came many people from cricketing nations who helped to fuel a growth in the sport on the islands. In 1997, the Cayman Islands were admitted to the International Cricket Council as an Affiliate member. In 2000 they made their debut in international cricket in the Americas Cricket Cup, where they finished 4th and gained their first international victory over Argentina. In the same year the Cayman Islands became the first Affiliate to play List A cricket when they took part in the 2000/01 Red Strip Bowl competition. In 2002, they gained Associate membership of the International Cricket Council. By 2005 they were taking part in the ICC Intercontinental Cup, where the Cayman Islands made their debut in first-class cricket against Bermuda and later against Canada. The team lost both matches heavily and has not appeared in first-class cricket since. Since then the Cayman Islands have dropped rapidly down the cricketing pyramid of the World Cricket League and will now take part in the 2012 ICC World Cricket League Division Five. Governing body Cayman Islands Cricket Association is the official governing body of cricket in the Cayman Islands. Its current headquarters is in Grand Cayman. Cayman Islands Cricket Association is the Cayman Islands representative at the International Cricket Council. Domestic competitions Men's domestic cricket in the Cayman Islands is split into 2 divisions: Clico Cayman Division 1 and Clico Cayman Division 2. Matches are played in one-day and Twenty20 formats. The islands also have 3 women's cricket clubs. Domestic teams Listed below are the current 7 most senior men's cricket clubs that make up the Clico Cayman Division 1, the highest level of domestic cricket in the Cayman Islands:Cayman Islands domestic teams *By Rite Cricket Club *Esso Tigers Cricket Club *Greenies 1 Cricket Club *Lime Schools Cricket Club *Paramount Cricket Club *Police Cricket Club *Prison Cricket Club Grounds There are currently plans to develop four further cricket grounds in the Cayman Islands.

Holcomb was the longest serving mayor of San Bernardino, California, to date. He held office as San Bernardino's mayor from 1971 until 1985, and returned to office again from 1989 until 1993. Holcomb has been widely credited with preserving the independence of the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District and its local water supply. Biography Early life Holcomb was born on March 1, 1922 in San Bernardino, California to Grant Holcomb and Eleanor Burkham Holcomb. Holcomb was the great-grandson of prospector William F. Holcomb, who first discovered gold in 1860 while hunting for bears in the San Bernardino Mountains near Big Bear Lake. The region of William Holcomb's discovery in the San Bernardino Mts. is still known as Holcomb Valley. Bob Holcomb's father, Grant Holcomb, served as the Mayor of San Bernardino from 1925 until 1927. He graduated from San Bernardino High School in 1940 and enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. However, Holcomb left UC-Berkeley before completing his bachelor's degree in order to enlist in the U.S. Army on October 13, 1942. Holcomb served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II for three years as a B-17 pilot with the 412th Bomb Squadron, 95th Bomb Group. He flew military bombing missions from the United Kingdom to Nazi Germany during the war. Holcomb was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army on October 26, 1945. He married his wife, Pearl \\"Penny\\" Pennington, on July 7, 1946. The couple had four children - Jay, William, Robert and Terri Lee. Holcomb returned to the University of California, Berkeley, where he completed his Bachelor of Arts in law on June 16, 1949. He then received a law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1950. He worked as an attorney for fourteen years before entering public office in 1964. Political career He began his political career as a leading opponent of a proposed merger between San Bernardino's local water district, San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, with the larger Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), based in Los Angeles. During the 1964 election, voters in the eastern San Bernardino Valley were asked in a ballot question whether they wanted to keep the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District as an independent entity or merge it into the neighboring Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Holcomb spearheaded the campaign to preserve local water rights for the city of San Bernardino. Supporters of the merger, which included San Bernardino's major media, political and business figures, argued that the city would suffer water shortages if local communities did not link with the MWD, which draws its water supply from the Colorado River. Proponents of the merger included the editor and editorial board of San Bernardino's major newspaper, The San Bernardino Sun, which was called the Sun-Telegram at the time. To counter the influence of The San Bernardino Sun-Telegram editorial page on the water issue, Holcomb founded and distributed his own small, weekly newspaper, \\"The Independent Press\\" (later re-founded as the City's major weekly published media retitled \\"San Bernardino's Free Press\\"), to publish opposition views of the proposal. Holcomb successfully led the election campaign to retain the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District's independence. Voters defeated the proposal in 1964 and Holcomb has since been widely credited with retaining San Bernardino's local water rights. Shortly after the water merger's electoral defeat, then San Bernardino Mayor Donald G. \\"Bud\\" Mauldin appointed Holcomb president of the city's Board of Water Commissioners on May 4, 1964. Holcomb's preservation of San Bernardino's local water rights is also credited with attracting California State University system to the city, which constructed California State University, San Bernardino. A local supply of water was needed to construct the campus. Mayor of San Bernardino Holcomb served as Mayor of San Bernardino from 1971 until 1985. He returned to office again from 1989 until 1993. Holcomb oversaw the completion of several new projects in the city during his tenure. These included the construction of the San Bernardino City Hall; the western headquarters of the Little League; the Central City Mall, which is now called the Carousel Mall; and the San Bernardino County administrative center. An eleven-foot statue of Martin Luther King Jr. was also installed in San Bernardino under Holcomb's direction. Holcomb died of heart failure at Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center in Loma Linda, California, on November 29, 2010, at the age of 88. He was survived by his wife since 1946, Penny Holcomb, and three children - Terri Lee Holcomb-Halstead, William Holcomb and Robert Holcomb. His fourth child, Jay Holcomb, died in 1977. On May 6, 2014, San Bernardino City Unified School District's Board voted unanimously to rename Little Mountain Elementary School after Holcomb.http://www.highlandnews.net/news/schools/article_b30b540e-d6dc-11e3-8ecc-0019bb2963f4.html References 1922 births 2010 deaths American military personnel of World War II Military personnel from California California Republicans Mayors of San Bernardino, California University of California, Berkeley alumni University of California, Hastings College of the Law alumni ","title":"Bob Holcomb"},{"id":"30009185","text":"Den nye lægen () is a 1943 Norwegian drama film directed by Rasmus Breistein, starring Jon Lennart Mjøen.

He was born in Ålen as a son of Jonas Monsen Storli (1715–1791) and Karen Svendsdotter Aspaas (born 1717). His mother was a first cousin of Svend Aspaas. In February 1777 he married Dorothea Wollan, but the marriage did not last. From October 1793 he was married to Elisabeth Sofie Müller (1772–1810). After her death he married Anna Margrethe Hagerup (1768–1840), a daughter of Christian Frederik Hagerup, in March 1811. Mons Lie was the ancestor of several notable people. His grandson Mons Lie (1803–1881) married a sister of Erik Røring Møinichen and had the daughters Erika (Nissen), Ida and Thomasine Lie. Another grandson Michael Strøm Lie (1807–1852) was the father of well- known writer Jonas Lie, who also married Thomasine Lie. Lie made his way from the family farm Storli, via Røros where he was an errand boy for Peder Hjort, to the regional center Trondhjem where he was hired as a clerk for auditor- general Andreas Klingenberg. He advanced in the ranks within Klingenberg's business. From 1793 to 1811 he practised as an attorney (prokurator) in Trondhjem city. He was also fire chief from 1800, and member of the city's council (rådmann, must not be confused with the democratic city council introduced by law in 1837) from 1808. From 1817 to his death he was the chief of police in the city. He died in August 1827 in Trondhjem. He was also a songwriter. Research points out that his songs were widespread in the 19th century, but only one song has been preserved in written form. \\"Sang for de trondhjemske Soldater\\" is found in O.

It was built about 1840 and is a two-story, wood-frame clapboard house in the Italian Villa style. It consists of four sections: the original, two-story central section built about 1840; the extension to the original section built about 1860; a wind added about 1870; and a three-story western addition completed in the 1890s. See also: It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description The house, located at 30 Hylan Boulevard, is an early Victorian country villa built in the early 1840s. Its site, a broad elliptical mound on Staten Island's North Shore, faces northeast and commands a magnificent view across the Narrows to New York Harbor. As seen today, the two-story, clapboard-covered McFarlane–Bredt house (formerly New York Yacht Club) stands on its original site, and although it has been divided into several apartments, the exterior appears much as it did at the turn of the century. The main entrance is centered on the southern side, placed there for convenient access to the carriage drive. The fancifully-designed hood above the paneled double door was obviously intended to resemble a canvas pavilion. Narrow latticed posts support a sharply concave tin roof with a wooden valance of pointed jigsaw ornament depending from the eave. On the second floor, directly above the main entrance, is a shallow balcony resting on a pair of console brackets and having a delicate wooden railing diamond design. A casement window opens into this balcony and above it is a smaller version of the decorative wooden awning of the porch. All the windows of the second floor in the older part of the house have these attractive wooden canopies above the casements. The windows of the first floor have double-hung six-over-six sash. The cornice is most unusual in that it has an extremely wide overhang supported by very long brackets which are quite shallow in depth, stepping backward in four thin layers with a wooden acorn pendant hanging from the end of each tier. The east wing of the 1870s has a similar cornice in smaller scale with two drops per bracket, while the west wing of the 1890s has rather short brackets with one pendant, each. In addition to the main entrance in the original house, each wing also has a front door. The western entrance has a narrow porch with a row of jigsaw wooden hearts decorating the eave, while the eastern door has only a small square stoop with a plain flat roof above it. The northern part of the house with overlooks the Narrows probably was considered the \\"front\\" in the same manner as were the facades of houses built facing the Hudson River. The main feature of this side of the house is the long open veranda with flat wooden posts of diamond trelliage and small paired brackets above the ornamental jigsaw work along the edge of the roof. Full length casement windows which have frames with crossetted corners open onto the veranda from the various first-floor* rooms, and centered in each of the three—sided bays is a handsome French door with a demi-lune transom. The outer edges of these two openings are decorated with continuous narrow borders of ruby-red glass. All the windows of the house, as well as the French doors, were originally equipped with wooden louvered exterior blinds, hut these have been removed except for a few which cover spaces that were designed as false windows. The pitch of the main roof is quite flat, but directly above each of the two-story bays it rises to form a jerkin head gable which aids in giving more definition to the bays and additional architectural interest to the roofline. There are a total of four brick chimneys which serve the numerous fireplaces within the house. The westernmost wing, probably of the 1890s, is nearly square and rises three stories above a red brick foundation to a pyramidal hipped roof. With an additional story, this section would have presented itself as a tower — more in keeping with high Victorian taste. However, since the wing is very plain in design, it was probably intended for use as servants' quarters. The original windows of this section were two-over-two double-hung wooden sash which have been replaced with adjustable louvered-glass jalousies. The entire house is painted a deep shade of grey with white trim; the original color scheme is not known. History  Early use  The house was built for Henry and Anne McFarlane, shortly after they purchased the property in 1841. If an architect designed the house for the McFarlanes, he remains unknown. McFarlane himself was an early developer of Staten Island. Clifton, the location of the house, was one of Staten Island's early romantic suburbs. A map dated January 1846, shows the McFarlane house as originally built with a wide two-story central bay fronted by a broad veranda, facing the Narrows. Also shown are an ice- house, a gardener's cottage, stables, two greenhouses, and a fish pond. The greenhouses are drawn as directly abutting the line of the neighboring property which had been bought, in 1844, by John H. Austen, a New York City auctioneer. In 1846, the McFarlanes sold the land (2.7 acres) and the dwelling to Daniel Low for $9,000. In 1847, Low sold to Richard Williamson, and three years later, in 1850, Williamson sold to Henry Dibblee, of Southfield. Dibblee, a dry-goods merchant, occupied the house until 1865 when he sold it to Almira Wolfe (Mrs. Nathaniel) for $25,000. The $25,000 purchase price which Mrs. Wolfe paid to Henry Dibblee in 1865 was a huge sum for that time and an indication that the property was well improved and in excellent order. Since Dibblee lived there for fifteen years, it may be assumed that he did a number of things which added to the value of the place. He may have done a considerable amount of landscaping, and he must have been responsible for the first addition to the west end of the house which nearly doubled its size. This section featured another projecting room-end and an extension of the veranda. Great care was taken to copy exactly all of the original detailing so that the house appeared to have been built all at one time. It served for three years (1868–1871) as the clubhouse of the New York Yacht Club and became the second home of that organization. While headquartered in Clifton, the club first successfully defended the America's Cup, the world's foremost yachting event. In post-Civil War years, the character of yachting changed greatly and immensely rich men who owned large steam-yachts became members of the club. They did not have such an intense interest in sailing and their ships were manned by full-time paid crews. They stepped up the social life of the club and wanted a more elegant establishment — after all, the Royal Yacht Squadron was housed in a former royal castle at Cowes. It was also onerous to have to go to Staten Island and back just for a party. The clubhouse at Clifton was found to be inadequate for large gatherings and in 1871 it was sold to Frederick Bredt, merchant, for $16,000.^ Because Bredt was the first owner after the New York Yacht Club, his name has been historically associated with the house. Meanwhile, the New York Yacht Club occupied a huge casino-type structure located directly on the waterfront at Stapleton which it maintained as a shore station until 1878. In 1872, the New York Yacht Club moved to Manhattan where they took up quarters in the Leonard Jerome mansion at Union Square and 26th Street, sharing the building with the Jockey Club.12 This arrangement lasted until 1884 when the Yacht Club moved to a house which they bought at 67 Madison Avenue. The final move occurred in 1901 when the New York Yacht club first occupied its present home at 37 West 44th Street. This handsome limestone Beaux-Arts building with a most remarkable facade which exhibits carved-stone waves, shells, seaweed, dolphins, and the stern-ends of three baroque sailing vessels, was designed by the architects Warren & Wetmore and was designated a New York City Landmark on September 11,-.1979. Later owners and changes The former New York Yacht Club building at Clifton has had two more additions since it was sold in 1871. It is not likely that Frederick Bredt enlarged the house since he held it for only three years, selling the place to George D. Ives in 1874. Bredt had a mansion named Beechwood on a very large comer lot across Pennsylvania Avenue (the former name of Hylan Boulevard) and he probably never lived in the villa. However, Ives owned the house for a lengthy period, and the style of the wing added to the east could indicate a date in the 1870s. This wing respects the basic design of the original house, but its somewhat lower ro^f makes an awkward connection to the older section. In 1891, the property was bought by James Thompson who held it until 1908, although his daughter, Jeanette, was the owner until 1948. It is probable that Thompson built the three-story addition at the extreme western end which stylistically appears to have been built in the 1890s.^^ This section — bold and square and tall — is quite different in appearance from the rest of the building. In 1948, Jeanette Thompson, then living on Belair Road, sold the house to T. Gilbert Brouillette, who lived there until 1961. In the years that followed, developers purchased the property, and the Austen house next door as well, and ownership changed a number of times. Finally, in 1975, the City of New York acquired both properties with the idea of creating a public park and preserving these choice remnants of old Staten Island on their beautiful site beside the Narrows.

Location and access The Bayshore Blufflands Preserve is located on the western shore of the Door Peninsula approximately west of Carlsville and north of Sturgeon Bay. There are parking areas at the east and west end of the property, and trails provide access into and through the site. Description Rising 150-200 feet (45-60 m) above the low terrace of Green Bay, the steep carbonate cliffs and outcrops support numerous rare land snails including the cherrystone drop snail (Hendersonia occulta), a state-threatened species. Aspen, sugar maple, red oak, hemlock, and white cedar grow out of the talus affording complete shade to the escarpment maintaining the cool and damp conditions, which support a lush growth of mosses. The unique site conditions also support such uncommon species as climbing fumitory, mountain maple, bulbet fern, common polypody, and fragile fern. Above the escarpment is a dry- mesic forest of red and white pine with red oak. The ground layer is dominated by round-leaved dogwood with northern bush honeysuckle, zig-zag goldenrod, big-leaved aster, and bracken fern. The site slowly grades into a richer, more mesic forest containing sugar maple, beech, and red oak with hemlock, and white pine. Also present is a wet-mesic forest of white cedar, big-tooth aspen, and black ash. Several white cedars reach impressive sizes here. Below the escarpment are seasonally flooded forests dominated by silver maple, and green ash with swamp white oak, American bladdernut, and great water-leaf. The site contains many rare plants including dwarf lake iris (Iris lacustris). Other noteworthy species within the SNA are variegated horsetail (Equisetum variegatum), Hooker's orchid (Platanthera hookeri), long-spurred violet (Viola rostrata), and large-flowered ground-cherry (Leucophysalis grandiflora).

Others became security guards, mainly in the urban areas. The number of Nepalese workers going to Malaysia has increased in the recent years due to the recovery from global recession and the removal of levy. Nepalese foreign employment agencies think that Malaysia might revise its decision to absorb labour from Nepal. As far as Malaysia is concerned, Nepal is the second largest labour supplying country after Indonesia.The Kathmandu Post - Nepali workers’ image dents in Malaysia Most Nepalis work in small restaurants, hotels, factories and industries.Nepali Times - Nowhere to turn Recently, the Malaysian government has decided to stop hiring Nepalese workers, reasoning that they want to give priority to their own increasing number of unemployed countrymen.Nepalnews.com - Malaysia to stop hiring Nepali workers In Malaysia, Nepalese workers have formed 73 organisations related to political parties.

It is estimated that there are about 0.2 million foreign illegal workers in Malaysia with about 50,000 from Nepal alone.

The plight of Nepalese workers abroad is not new and many recruiters and employers in Malaysia continue to get away with exploitation because the workers have nowhere to turn. However, it seems the Malaysian government is more concerned about the welfare of Nepalese workers than the Nepalese government.

To begin with its shareholders were the state of Prussia, the Province of Hanover und the town of Sankt Andreasberg. After 1924, it was operated by the Hanover State Light Railway Office.  History  The Oder Valley Railway opened in 1884, before the rack railway was built. This line connected Sankt Andreasberg via Bad Lauterberg to the South Harz Railway (Northeim–Nordhausen) in Scharzfeld. The terminus of the Oder Valley Railway was the (\\"state railway station\\"), of St. Andreasberg West. The station was located at the foot of the Glockenberg hill. The location of the Oder Valley Railway station, remote from the village centre in a deep valley, was rather inconvenient for the townsfolk of St. Andreasberg. So as early as 23 June 1903, the local council had sent proposals to the railway administration in Kassel explaining three options for extending the railway to the town centre. Extending the adhesion-based Oder Valley Railway did not seem feasible due to the high cost. The railway had to climb 70 metres in height, which would have been only possible by artificially extending the line to achieve an acceptable grade for an adhesion railway. As a result, a rack railway based on the Abt system was proposed. Three different options for the route were evaluated: * following the road through the Sperrlutter valley with a maximum gradient of 1 in 12 * following the Wäschegrund with a comparable incline * climbing out of the Sperrlutter Valley and cutting through the Grüner Hirsch with a maximum gradient of 1 in 6 After further negotiations it was decided in 1906 to build the third option with a slightly altered loop and a maximum gradient of 1 in 8.2. Construction started on 1 April 1911. During the winter of 1912/13, work had to be halted for several months, which meant that laying the track and the rack rail only started in April 1913. The route was 1,636.15 metres long and required 1,543.61 metres of double-bar, rack rail. The concession to operate the railway was received on 5 June 1911. It was granted by the district president of Hanover and permitted the operation of a steam railway for the next 100 years. The rack railway was officially opened on 19 June 1913, but goods operations had already started 3 days earlier so that employees could familiarise themselves with the operation. The railway had two, triple-axle, rack railway, steam engines and two, twin-axle, passenger coaches. The railway become unprofitable in the 1950s and should have been modernized. In addition, safety had become a concern after an accident on the Drachenfels Railway. This led to the closure of the railway on 17 August 1959.  Rack rail operation  Former railway embankment of the rack railway section On 19 July 1913 the line was officially opened at the Stadtbahnhof station on the Glockenberg. Goods workings had started three days earlier in order to familiarize railway staff with operations. Initially, five pairs of trains were timetabled daily, each with a journey time of about 15 minutes (at a top speed of 8 km/h). In the 1920s, only two pairs of trains ran daily due to the effects of the First World War, a lack of coal and declining goods and passenger traffic), and, from 1932, even busses and lorries were used. The Second World War and Deutsche Bundesbahn's intentions to close the line from Bad Lauterberg to St. Andreasberg West caused further problems. Only a great storm of protest kept the Oder Valley Railway open and also encouraged plans to modernise the rack railway. But neither the acquisition of a modern diesel rack railway locomotive, which could run through from Scharzfeld to St. Andreasberg, nor the electrification of the line could be carried out due to cost. The last attempt to save the line was the use of DB Class VT 98 railbuses: Dr. Paul Schöning, head of the Brunswick mechanical engineering department, drove a railbus without any authority or permission, on the inclined part of the route on 18 September 1957 and determined that the railbus would have had to be fitted with additional brakes for the downhill run. But they were never employed in service.  Closure  Former wayside halt at Schwalbenherd Dennert Fir Tree in memory of the railway In 1955, the Lower Saxony Ministry for the Economy and Transport warmed that operations on the St. Andreasberg rack railway were very unprofitable. Rapidly rising traffic on the roads and the lack of modernization of the line made the end of the rack railway ever more likely. A serious accident on the Drachenfels Railway in September 1958, which killed 18 and injured 100 people, was cited, at a business meeting on 28. November 1958, in announcing the closure of the line in Sankt Andreasber. Consequently, rail services ceased on 1 January 1959 after 46 years of operations, on safety grounds, even though the cause of the accident on the Drachenfels line was not directly applicable. The last train probably worked the line on 23 April 1959. On 17 August 1959 the rack railway was officially closed and work began immediately on lifting the track. The St. Andreasberg Railway Company (St. Andreasberger Eisenbahn GmbH) operated a bus service until 30 May 1965 when it was taken over by the DB. The surviving station building was a resort administrative office and then, until 2005, an artist's studio. The large roof overhang is a bus station today. The old trackbed has been partially tarmacked and leads to the barbecue site of Waldarbeiter. In addition the old locomotive shed is used by a local bus company as a garage.

A pilot was shot in May 1992, starring George Newbern, Anne Le Guernec, Robert Knepper, Kurtwood Smith, Max Grodenchik, and Carrie-Anne Moss,IMDB Entry for Doorways but was not picked up, and the project was shelved. In 2010, IDW Publishing developed an adaptation of the TV pilot into comic book format. Plot A mysterious feral woman, known only as Cat (Anne Le Guernec), appears in the middle of a motorway, causing some cars to crash. She fires a weapon at a truck, which explodes, and she is injured by a fragment of the resulting shrapnel. She is taken to a hospital where she is cared for by Dr. Thomas Mason (George Newbern). After he finishes work, Thomas visits his girlfriend Laura (Carrie-Anne Moss), with whom he discusses his mysterious new patient. Meanwhile, three dark-clad beings and a floating podium (containing a Dark Lord) appear on the motorway at the same location where Cat appeared. The next day Thomas discovers Cat has been removed from the hospital and is confronted by FBI Special Agent Trager (Kurtwood Smith), who escorts him to a secret underground lab and holding facility. There, Dr. Roth (Max Grodénchik) explains to Thomas that Cat's weapon (the \\"phut BOOM\\" gun) and her bracelet (the \\"geosyncronator\\") have an unusual mixture of organic and technological properties, and don't appear to have been designed for human hands. Thomas is brought to Cat, who is being detained; and he gives her back her bracelet, which allows one of the dark-clad beings, Thane (Robert Knepper) to track her. Cat escapes the holding facility with Thomas' help, and together the two drive towards a \\"door\\". Cat explains that Thane is chasing her and that, unless they reach the \\"door\\" before it closes, she will be trapped and killed by Thane. She further explains that the \\"door\\" leads to a parallel universe safer for her. The two reach the \\"door\\" and are confronted by Thane, who kills Trager and several FBI agents who were also tracking them. They manage to escape through the \\"door\\", just before Thane can catch them, and end up in a world where, 15 years ago, a microbe gene was created to clean up an oil spill, but it ate all petroleum in the world. They hitch a ride on a wagon with Jake (Hoyt Axton) and his granddaughter Cissy (Tisha Putman), who give them a ride to the nearest truck stop. While at the truck-stop, Cat detects that her pursuers have materialized in this world also and tries to steal Jake and Cissy's horses to escape from them. Cat and Thomas are arrested by this world's version of Agent Trager and are held overnight to be escorted to jail in the morning. The following day as Thomas and Cat are being escorted to jail by Trager, they hear Jake and Cissy's wagon being attacked by a bike gang, Cat rescues Cissy from being attacked, but Jake is shot by the bike gang. Thomas stabilizes Jake, and arranges with Trager to get Jake transported to a hospital in Denver. In Denver, Cat locates their next \\"door\\", but they are blocked by Thane and his colleagues, until Trager (once again) sacrifices himself to allow the two to escape to a new adventure. Cast and characters * George Newbern as Dr. Thomas Mason, a medical doctor who is adept at magic since his father was a stage magician, and at the start of the show serves as an ER doctor. He has a girlfriend, Laura (who is a lawyer) and is very content with his life until everything is changed completely when he meets Cat. She brings him with her through a 'Door' to a parallel world where things are similar, but different, to our world. * Anne Le Guernec as Cat, former servant of Thane, and the Dark Lord. Cat is a fugitive from a parallel Earth ruled by aliens, who lands on this Earth and is quickly injured. She is taken to hospital where she meets Thomas, but is taken from there to an FBI holding site, where she is rescued by Thomas. The pair hitch-hike to the nearest 'Door' to another parallel world, and escape to an Earth where petrol has disappeared. * Robert Knepper as Thane, servant of the Dark Lord. Thane is from this same parallel Earth as Cat, that is ruled by aliens, and he is a servant to one of these aliens (\\"the Dark Lord\\"), and was the owner of Cat. He doesn't consider himself human, rather a hunter of humans. He has several bio- enhancements, including a set of claws emerge from the back of his hands. * Kurtwood Smith as Special Agent Trager, who investigates Cat's appearance. * Carrie-Anne Moss as Laura, a lawyer who is Thomas' girlfriend. * Max Grodénchik as Dr. Roth, an FBI researcher who investigates Cat's equipment. * Hoyt Axton as Jake, a friendly wanderer in a parallel world. * Tisha Putman as Cissy, Jake's granddaughter. Production Development George R. R. Martin pitched the concept for Doorways in 1991 to various television networks, and ABC agreed to pick up the show. The pilot was produced with Columbia Pictures. Martin spent much of 1991 redrafting and polishing the pilot script. This process continued until, in January 1992, production was given the green light. Anne Le Guernec was cast as Cat, but the actor that the production company wanted for Thomas, George Newbern, was in the middle of shooting a movie. After several hundred more auditions, it was decided to defer the shooting of the pilot until Newbern became free in May 1992. The series was originally called Doors (the portals that Tom and Cat travel through are always called Doors rather than Doorways), but this was changed after ABC expressed concern that it may be confused with either the rock band The Doors or the Oliver Stone biopic The Doors. In August 1992, a rough cut of the show was shown to ABC executives, who reacted enthusiastically and ordered six additional scripts for the show. Martin worked on those scripts for the next six months with Michael Cassutt, Ed Zuckerman, Steve De Jarnatt, and J. D. Feigelson. In May 1993, ABC announced that they would not be picking up Doorways.  Connection to Sliders  There has been speculation that Sliders was inspired by Doorways, in which the main cast also were fugitives fleeing through parallel worlds, while carrying a device that tells them where and when the next Doorway opens. At the time of Sliders' launch, Evelyn C. Leeper noted the similarities to Doorways.https://www.imdb.com/Reviews/33/3378 In response to rumors that Sliders creator Tracy Tormé applied for a writing position on the show, Martin clarified in a 1995 post on GEnie that it was Tormé's agent that inquired about the position, and Tormé has denied any connection between the two. In other media Book The first draft of the pilot script appeared in George R. R. Martin's 1200 page GRRM: A RRetrospective in 2003, which was republished in 2006 as Dreamsongs: A RRetrospective. Comicbook adaptation Artist Stefano Martino did not view the TV pilot before drawing the comic On August 30, 2010, IDW Publishing announced its forthcoming adaptation of Doorways was to be in four parts. When speaking of the parallel worlds, editor Mariah Huehner says \\"One of the most interesting is a world with no oil. Which is pretty timely.\\" Explaining the plot, she says: > It's a dark sci-fi/fantasy, that's not unlike the Twilight Zone in terms of > taking an ordinary person and suddenly confronting them with very bizarre > events and people. Tom is a total \\"good\\" guy, loves his girlfriend, likes > his job, and just wants to help people. But when Cat shows up she turns his > comfortable world upside down.IDW Announces 'Doorways' Martin noted in the first issue of Doorways that artist Stefano Martino has not seen the pilot, and the visual representations of the characters and architecture are totally changed. He goes on to say that in the medium of comics without the constraints of budget there is more creative freedom. Martin says that the comic version \\"is much cooler than the television show could ever have been.\\" Issue #1 was released in November 2010. All four issues were collected as a hardcover in July 2011. References External links * Unaired television pilots Television pilots not picked up as a series Works by George R. R.

The palace was begun in 1442 by architect Giovanni Pace, also known as Sodo, in an economically flourishing period for Ancona. It was built near the port, which was the trade point of the mercantile republic in medieval times, in order to provide a meeting point for the traders. The building was restored in 1558-1561 after a fire, under the direction of Pellegrino Tibaldi, who also frescoed the central hall. The current façade was designed by the Dalmatian architect Giorgio da Sebenico, who worked to it in 1451 to 1459. It is divided into four vertical sections, topped by a pinnacle. Each one has a statue, representing (from left), Hope, Fortitude, Justice and Charity. The two side sections have two stained glass, ogival windows. In the upper sectors are blind double mullioned windows and, in the centre, is an equestrian statue of the Roman emperor Trajan. The Loggia was damaged by the Allied bombings during World War II, and was restored in the late 20th century.

Despite lacking a formal artistic training, he decided to add a paintbrush and canvas to his usual tools, to great effect: His surrealist, childlike style struck a chord with audiences and art collectors the world over. Today, he is being mentioned  and exhibited  together with the likes of Joan Miró and Antoni Tàpies.\\"Kati Krause, Sixeart Gives Graffiti Style a Museum Quality (April 24, 2009), The Wall Street Journal/Arts and Entertainment  Style  His artwork is a powerful composition of colors and geometrical forms.

History The Bentley Field, located on the UK continental shelf in block 9/3b in 110 m of water, contains approximately in-place of heavy (10 to 12 oAPI) viscous (1500 cP) crude. The field is four-way dip closed at uppermost Palaeocene, lowermost Eocene, Dornoch sandstone level, and covers an area of about 16 km by 5 km at a depth of around 1.1 km TVDss. The reservoir is high porosity (33%), net to gross pay (90%) and with ultra-high apparent horizontal permeabilities approaching 50 Darcies based on flow-test measurements, but consistent with unconsolidated sand. Appraisal History The field was discovered in 1977 with the Amoco 9/3-1 vertical exploration well, which discovered an 81 ft oil column in high quality Dornoch sandstone. The field was subsequently licensed to Conoco who appraised it with two further vertical wells (9/3-2A and 9/3-4) in the 1980s. These confirmed the presence of a large accumulation, estimated at that time to be similar to today’s figure at around 900 MMstb in-place. Attempts to gas- lift the 9/3-1 well failed due to the viscous nature of the Bentley crude, whilst an attempt to flow 9/3-2A using a downhole pump failed due to mechanical reasons. With two failed tests and an oil price below $20/bbl Conoco relinquished the license in the mid 1990s. There was no further activity on the block until 2003 when Xcite applied for, and were awarded, a Promote License on the block during the UK 21st Licensing Round. This was the first licensing round in which Promote Licences had been awarded and represented an important initiative from the UK licensing authorities to encourage small and new-start companies to acquire and promote acreage. The license was converted to a Traditional License in 2005 prior to Xcite’s first appraisal well (9/03b-5) in 2008. This well was a vertical appraisal well, drilled at the end of 2007 and successfully flow-tested in January 2008. This was followed two more wells drilled November 2010 (9/03b-6 and 9/03b-6Z) to identify reservoir structure and characterise reservoir properties. The resultant flow-test delivered a surface constrained, final stabilised rate of 2,900 stb/day. In August 2012 a successful extended well test was performed to gather more data on the reservoir properties and water cut by using the jack- up Rowan Norway. In October 2012 after 60 days, Xcite Energy announced the successful conclusion of the extended well test, with the 9/3b-7 and 7Z wells successfully suspended for future use as production wells. The Bentley crude oil produced during the extended well test was stored on a floating storage unit Scott Spirit, and was sold to BP as per the off take agreement. Reserves The recoverable reserves are estimated at of heavy oil (API 10-12) and total oil in place is in excess of . Development Since 2013 Xcite Energy Resources has been working with and signed memorandums of understanding with a number of industry partners to do pre-FEED/assurance engineering prior to arranging financing. The industry partners include AMEC, ARUP, Teekay Shipping, AIBEL AS, Baker Hughes and China Oilfield Services Limited. The company has also signed a collaboration agreement with Statoil and Shell in May 2014 to make available and share field-specific technical and operational information for the evaluation of potential synergies and collaboration between the Bentley and Bressay Fields, and another collaboration agreement in October 2014 with EnQuest and Statoil in order to evaluate the potential utilisation of common gas import infrastructure between the Kraken, Bentley and Bressay fields. In October 2015 the Bentley license was reviewed in order to ascertain the appropriate field determination boundary for agreement with the OGA and the boundary of the Bentley oil field has been accepted subject to formal FDP approval. Xcite announced in February 2016 that they had successfully completed a technical review of the first phase of the Bentley field development with the Oil and Gas Authority to ensure that the plan meets the OGA's policy objectives of maximising the economic benefit to the UK of its oil and gas resources. At the same time the company announced that they anticipate submitting a field development plan to the OGA in 2016. The Bentley field is planned with a phased development. The first phase development, with a 5-year drilling programme, and focused on the northern area of the field will be followed by a second phase, which will focus on the western and south areas of the Bentley field. As the Bentley development will be short of fuel gas for meeting its power generation and process heat requirements, the first phase development plans is to include a 10 km 6\\" pipeline from a tie-in to the Kraken field for fuel gas import. Technical and engineering work streams are largely complete and it is expected that the field will commence operation approximately three years after FDP approval from the UK Government. FDP submission is currently pending commercial and funding discussions which are ongoing as of May 2016. The company announced in their 2015 third quarter results that technical and commercial due diligence on the Bentley field had been completed by a potential field development partner, but that they remained very actively engaged with a wide range of parties in order to maximise the opportunity to secure the required funding. Separately, that the company has committed a significant amount of time to a technical review of the Bentley field development concept with the United Kingdom Oil and Gas Authority. In late May 2016 Xcite Energy announced that they had reached agreement on the principal commercial terms for the development funding of the first phase of the Bentley project, but that they require a partner to join the development group. Separately, the company is running a tender process to select an EPCIC contractor for the MOPU and FSO and to finalise a drilling rig contract.

It spans the Estuary of Bilbao, linking the neighborhoods of Casco Viejo and Abando. The third bridge to stand on the site, it was completed in 1938. The original bridge was opened in 1848 and the second in 1878. The Arriaga Theater, the Arenal de Bilbao (Bilbao Arenal) park, the Estación de Concordia (Concordia Train Station) and the Bailén Skyscraper (the first skyscraper of the city) can be seen from the bridge.  History  Along with the growth of Bilbao, the urban centre of the city expanded beyond the old original seven streets, and started to expand over territories of the, by that time, elizate of Abando. In fact, the transit of people moving from Abando to Bilbao or from Bilbao to Abando grew every year and became more fluid. As the only bridge that crossed the Estuary of Bilbao was the San Antón Bridge, it became a necessity and a priority to build a new bridge that would connect both banks of the river.  Iron Bridge (1845 - 1876)  The bridge project was introduced in 1844, and it was built during 1845, to be finally opened in 1847. Once finished, it became the third bridge that crossed the river and also became the main connection between Bilbao and the elizate of Abando. It had an iron structure (it was the first known Spanish bridge made by casting) and it was a moveable bridge.Puentes sobre la ría de Bilbao, desde El Arenal hasta el Príncipes de España Absolut Bilbao The bridge was named Isabella II.Conociendo El Ensanche de Bilbao The Queen Isabella II herself wanted to see the bridge during her visit to the city in 1865, in which the Prince of Asturias (which later would become the King Alfonso XII) joined her. In 1866 the internal structure of the bridge, which allowed it to open and close (moveable bridge) stopped working. Until 1870, a toll had to be paid in order to cross the bridge. During the following years, several floods and other causes damaged severely the bridge. Three of its original arches were replaced with sections of wood. The bridge suffered more damage on the Carlist Wars, when a bombardment fell over the city on April 2, 1874. Finally, on April 11 and April 12 of the same year, the bridge was partially destroyed in a flood. In 1876 one of its arches was placed on Udondo River (Leioa) where it is today. .A tail of two Spanish cast-iron bridges  Stone Bridge (1878 - 1937)  View of the Estuary of Bilbao and the City Hall from the bridge. In 1876, after the destruction of the original bridge, one of the projects by Adolfo de Ibarreta was approved. The project included a new three-arch bridge made of stone. The new bridge was opened to public on December 1, 1878. The new bridge limited the fluvial transport to barges and small steam boats. This bridge, also called Isabella II, had a bigger surface for road transit, which allowed tramways connect both sides of the river using the bridge. In June, 1937, during the Civil War, the bridge was demolished and a temporary one was built with pieces of wood and barges.  Reinforced Concrete Bridge (1938 - present time)  In June, 1938, a new reinforced concrete bridge was opened where the old Isabella II bridge was located. The new bridge was called Puente de la Victoria (Victory Bridge). In 1980, the name of bridge was changed from Victory Bridge to the current one, Puente del Arenal (Arenal Bridge).

China under the Qianlong Emperor launched four invasions of Burma between 1765 and 1769, which were considered as one of his Ten Great Campaigns. Nonetheless, the war, which claimed the lives of over 70,000 Chinese soldiers and four commanders, is sometimes described as \\"the most disastrous frontier war that the Qing dynasty had ever waged\\", and one that \\"assured Burmese independence\\". Burma's successful defense laid the foundation for the present-day boundary between the two countries. At first, the Emperor envisaged an easy war, and sent in only the Green Standard troops stationed in Yunnan. The Qing invasion came as the majority of Burmese forces were deployed in their latest invasion of Siam. Nonetheless, battle-hardened Burmese troops defeated the first two invasions of 1765–1766 and 1766–1767 at the border. The regional conflict now escalated to a major war that involved military maneuvers nationwide in both countries. The third invasion (1767–1768) led by the elite Manchu Bannermen nearly succeeded, penetrating deep into central Burma within a few days' march from the capital, Ava (Inwa). But the bannermen of northern China could not cope with unfamiliar tropical terrains and lethal endemic diseases, and were driven back with heavy losses. After the close call, King Hsinbyushin redeployed his armies from Siam to the Chinese front. The fourth and largest invasion got bogged down at the frontier. With the Qing forces completely encircled, a truce was reached between the field commanders of the two sides in December 1769. The Qing kept a heavy military lineup in the border areas of Yunnan for about one decade in an attempt to wage another war while imposing a ban on inter-border trade for two decades. The Burmese, too, were preoccupied with the Chinese threat, and kept a series of garrisons along the border. Twenty years later, when Burma and China resumed a diplomatic relationship in 1790, the Qing unilaterally viewed the act as Burmese submission, and claimed victory. Ultimately the main beneficiaries of this war were the Siamese, who reclaimed most of their territories in the next three years after having lost their capital Ayutthaya to the Burmese in 1767. Background Topography of Shan State, where major campaigns took place The long border between Burma and China had long been vaguely defined. The Ming dynasty first conquered Yunnan borderlands between 1380 and 1388, and stamped out local resistance by the mid-1440s. The Burmese control of the Shan States (which covered the present- day Kachin State, Shan State and Kayah State) came in 1557 when King Bayinnaung of the Toungoo dynasty conquered all of the Shan States. The border was never demarcated in the modern sense, with local Shan sawbwas (chiefs) at the border regions paying tribute to both sides. The situation turned to China's favor in the 1730s when the Qing decided to impose a tighter control of Yunnan's border regions while the Burmese authority largely dissipated with the rapid decline of the Toungoo dynasty. Qing consolidation of borderlands (1730s) Qianlong in his early reign The Qing attempts for tighter control of the border were initially met with fierce resistance by the local chiefs. In 1732, the Yunnan government's demand of higher taxes led to several Shan revolts at the border. Shan resistance leaders united people by saying \\"The lands and water are our properties. We could plow ourselves and eat our own produces. There is not a need to pay tributes to foreign government\\". In July 1732, a Shan army, mostly consisted of native mountaineers, laid siege to the Qing garrison at Pu'er for ninety days. The Yunnan government responded with an overwhelming force numbered around 5,000 and lifted the siege. The Qing army pursued further west but could not put down persistent local resistance. Finally, the Qing field commanders changed their tactics by allying with neutral sawbwas, granting Qing titles and powers, including Green Standard captainships and regional commanderships. To complete the agreements, the third ranking officer of Yunnan traveled to Simao personally and held a ceremony of allegiance. By the mid-1730s, the sawbwas of the border who used to pay dual tributes, were increasingly siding with the more powerful Qing. By 1735, the year which the Qianlong Emperor ascended the Chinese throne, ten sawbwas had sided with the Qing. The annexed border states ranged from Mogaung and Bhamo in present-day Kachin State to Hsenwi State (Theinni) and Kengtung State (Kyaingtong) in present-day Shan State to Sipsongpanna (Kyaingyun) in present-day Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan. While the Qing were consolidating their hold at the border, the Toungoo dynasty was faced with multiple external raids and internal rebellions and could not take any reciprocal action. Throughout the 1730s, the dynasty faced Meitei raids that reached increasingly deeper parts of Upper Burma. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Burma revolted and founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. By the mid-1740s, the authority of the Burmese king had largely dissipated. In 1752, the Toungoo dynasty was toppled by the forces of Restored Hanthawaddy which captured Ava. By then, the Qing control of the former borderlands was unquestioned. In 1752, the Emperor issued a manuscript, Qing Imperial Illustration of Tributaries, saying that all \\"barbarian\\" tribes under his rule must be studied and reported their natures and cultures back to Beijing. Burmese reassertion (1750s–1760s) Alaungpaya In 1752, a new dynasty called Konbaung rose to challenge Restored Hanthawaddy, and went on to reunite much of the kingdom by 1758. In 1758–59, King Alaungpaya, the founder of the dynasty, sent an expedition to the farther Shan States (present-day Kachin State and northern and eastern Shan State), which had been annexed by the Qing over two decades earlier, to reestablish Burmese authority. (Nearer Shan States had been reacquired since 1754). Three of the ten farther Shan state sawbwas (Mogaung, Bhamo, Hsenwi) and their militias reportedly ran away into Yunnan and tried to persuade Qing officials to invade Burma. The nephew of Kengtung sawbwa and his followers also fled. The Yunnan government reported the news to the Emperor in 1759, and the Qing court promptly issued an imperial edict ordering reconquest. At first, the Yunnan officials, who believed that \\"barbarians must be conquered using barbarians\\", tried to resolve the matter by supporting the defected sawbwas. But the strategy did not work. In 1764, a Burmese army, which was on its way to Siam, was increasing its grip of the borderlands, and the sawbwas complained to China. In response, the Emperor appointed Liu Zao, a respected scholarly minister from the capital to sort out the matters. At Kunming, Liu assessed that the use of Tai-Shan militias alone was not working, and that he needed to commit regular Green Standard Army troops. First invasion (1765–1766) Ava army in a 19th-century painting In early 1765, a 20,000-strong Burmese army stationed at Kengtung, led by Gen. Ne Myo Thihapate, left Kengtung for yet another Burmese invasion of Siam. With the main Burmese army gone, Liu used a few minor trade disputes between local Chinese and Burmese merchants as the excuse to order an invasion of Kengtung in December 1765. The invasion force, which consisted of 3,500 Green Standard troops along with Tai-Shan militias, laid siege to Kengtung but could not match battle-hardened Burmese troops at the Kengtung garrison, led by Gen. Ne Myo Sithu. The Burmese lifted the siege and pursued the invaders into Pu'er Prefecture, and defeated them there. Ne Myo Sithu left a reinforced garrison, and returned to Ava in April 1766. Governor Liu, in his embarrassment, first tried to conceal what had happened. When the emperor became suspicious, he ordered Liu's immediate recall and demotion. Instead of complying, Liu committed suicide by slicing his throat with a stationery knife, writing as blood was pouring from his neck: \\"There is no way to pay back the emperor's favor. I deserve death with my crime\\". While this kind of suicide in the face of bureaucratic failure apparently was not unusual in Qing China, it reportedly enraged the Emperor nonetheless. Sorting out the Mien (the Chinese word for \\"Burmese\\") was now a matter of imperial prestige. The Emperor now appointed Yang Yingju, an experienced frontier officer with long service in Xinjiang and Guangzhou. Second invasion (1766–1767) Emperor Qianlong's banner men Yang arrived in the summer of 1766 to take command. Unlike Liu's invasion of Kengtung, located far away from the Burmese heartland, Yang was determined to strike Upper Burma directly. He reportedly planned to place a Qing claimant on the Burmese throne. Yang's planned path of invasion was via Bhamo and down the Irrawaddy River to Ava. The Burmese knew the route of invasion in advance, and were prepared. Hsinbyushin's plan was to lure the Chinese into Burmese territory, and then surround them. The Burmese commander in the field Balamindin was ordered to give up Bhamo, and instead stay at the Burmese stockade at Kaungton, a few miles south of Bhamo on the Irrawaddy. The Kaungton fort had been especially equipped with the cannon corps led by the French gunners (captured at the battle of Thanlyin in 1756.) To reinforce them, another army led by Maha Thiha Thura and posted at the easternmost Burmese garrison at Kenghung (present-day Jinghong, Yunnan), was ordered to march to the Bhamo theater across the northern Shan states. Trap at Bhamo–Kaungton As planned, the Qing troops easily captured Bhamo in December 1766, and established a supply base. The Chinese then proceeded to lay siege to the Burmese garrison at Kaungton. But Balamindin's defenses held off repeated Chinese assaults. Meanwhile, two Burmese armies, one led by Maha Sithu, and another led by Ne Myo Sithu, surrounded the Chinese. Maha Thiha Thura's army also arrived and took position near Bhamo to block the escape route back to Yunnan. The impasse did not favor the Chinese troops who were utterly unprepared to fight in the tropical weather of Upper Burma. Thousands of Chinese soldiers reportedly were struck down by cholera, dysentery, and malaria. One Qing report stated that 800 out of 1,000 soldiers in one garrison had died of disease, and that another hundred were ill. With the Chinese army greatly weakened, the Burmese then launched their offensive. First, Ne Myo Sithu easily retook the lightly held Bhamo. The main Chinese army was now totally holed up in the Kaungton-Bhamo corridor, cut off from all supplies. The Burmese then proceeded to attack the main Chinese army from two sides Balamindin's army out of Kaungton fortress, and Ne Myo Sithu's army from the north. The Chinese retreated eastwards and then northwards where another Burmese army led by Maha Thiha Thura was waiting. The two other Burmese armies also followed up, and the Chinese army was destroyed entirely. Maha Sithu's army which had been guarding the western flank of the Irrawaddy, then marched north of Myitkyina and defeated other lightly held Chinese garrisons at the border. The Burmese armies proceeded to occupy eight Chinese Shan States within Yunnan. Aftermath Victorious Burmese armies returned to Ava with the captured guns, muskets and prisoners in early May. At Kunming, Yang began resorting to lies. He reported that Bhamo had been occupied; that its inhabitants had begun wearing Manchu-style pigtails; and that the Burmese commander, Ne Myo Sithu, after losing 10,000 men had sued for peace. He recommended that the emperor graciously accept the peace offer to restore the normal trade relations between the two countries. The Qianlong Emperor however realized the falsity of the report, and ordered Yang back to Beijing. On his arrival, Yang committed suicide at the order of the Emperor. Third invasion (1767–1768) Chinese mobilization After the two defeats, the emperor and his court could not comprehend how a relatively small country like Burma could resist the might of the Qing. For the Emperor, it was time for the Manchus themselves to come into the picture. He had always doubted the battle- worthiness of his Chinese Green Standard armies. The Manchus saw themselves as a warlike and conquering race and the Chinese as an occupied people. He commissioned a study of the first two invasions, and the report reinforced his biases—that the low battle-worthiness of the Green Standard armies was the reason for the failures. In 1767, the Emperor appointed the veteran Manchu commander Ming Rui, a son-in-law of his, as governor-general of Yunnan and Guizhou, and head of the Burma campaign. Ming Rui had seen battle against the Turks in the northwest and was in command of the strategically key post of Ili (in present-day Xinjiang). His appointment meant that this was no longer a border dispute but a full-fledged war. Ming Rui arrived in Yunnan in April. An invasion force consisting of Mongol and elite Manchu troops rushed down from northern China and Manchuria. Thousands of Green Standards from Yunnan and Tai-Shan militias accompanied this force. Provinces throughout China were mobilized to provide supplies. The total strength of the invasion force was 50,000 men, the vast majority being infantry. The mountains and thick jungles of Burma kept the use of cavalry forces to a minimum. The Qing court now seriously considered the threat of illnesses among its troops; as a precaution, the campaign was planned for the winter months when diseases were believed to be less prevalent. Burmese mobilization The Burmese now faced the largest Chinese army yet mobilized against them. Yet King Hsinbyushin did not seem to realize the gravity of the situation. Throughout the first two invasions, he had steadfastly refused to recall the main Burmese armies, which had been battling in Laos and Siam since January 1765, and laying siege to the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya since January 1766. Throughout 1767, when the Chinese were mobilizing for their most serious invasion yet, the Burmese were still focused on defeating the Siamese. Even after the Siamese capital was finally captured in April 1767, Hsinbyushin kept part of the troops in Siam during the rainy season months in order to mop up the remaining Siamese resistance during the winter months later that year. He actually allowed many Shan and Laotian battalions to demobilize at the start of the rainy season. As a result, when the invasion did come in November 1767, the Burmese defenses had not been upgraded to meet a much larger and a more determined foe. The Burmese command looked much like that of the second invasion. Hsinbyushin again assigned the same commanders of the second invasion to face off against the Chinese. Maha Sithu led the main Burmese army, and was the overall commander of the Chinese theater, with Maha Thiha Thura and Ne Myo Sithu commanding two other Burmese armies. Balamindin again commanded the Kaungton fort. (Given that the main Burmese army was only about 7,000 strong, the entire Burmese defense at the start of the third invasion was most likely no more than 20,000.) Main battle routes of the third invasion (1767–1768) Chinese offensive Ming Rui planned a two-pronged invasion as soon as the rainy season ended. The main Chinese army, led by Ming Rui himself, was to approach Ava through Hsenwi, Lashio and Hsipaw, and down the Namtu river. (The main invasion route was the same route followed by the Manchu forces a century earlier, chasing the Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming dynasty.) The second army, led by Gen. E'erdeng'e, was to try the Bhamo route again. The ultimate objective was for both armies to clamp themselves in a pincer action on the Burmese capital of Ava. The Burmese plan was to hold the second Chinese army in the north at Kaungton with the army led by Ne Myo Sithu, and meet the main Chinese army in the northeast with two armies led by Maha Sithu and Maha Thiha Thura. At first, everything went according to plan for the Qing. The third invasion began in November 1767 as the smaller Chinese army attacked and occupied Bhamo. Within eight days, Ming Rui's main army occupied the Shan states of Hsenwi and Hsipaw. Ming Rui made Hsenwi a supply base, and assigned 5,000 troops to remain at Hsenwi and guard the rear. He then led a 15,000-strong army in the direction of Ava. In late December, at the Goteik Gorge (south of Hsipaw), the two main armies faced off and the first major battle of the third invasion ensued. Outnumbered two-to-one, Maha Sithu's main Burmese army was thoroughly routed by Ming Rui's Bannermen. Maha Thiha Thura too was repulsed at Hsenwi. The news of the disaster at Goteik reached Ava. Hsinbyushin finally realized the gravity of the situation, and urgently recalled Burmese armies from Siam. Having smashed through the main Burmese army, Ming Rui pressed on full-steam ahead, overrunning one town after another, and reached Singu on the Irrawaddy, 30 miles north of Ava at the beginning of 1768. The only bright spot for the Burmese was that the northern invasion force, which was to come down the Irrawaddy to join up with Ming Rui's main army, had been held off at Kaungton. Burmese counter-attack Ava At Ava, Hsinbyushin famously did not panic at the prospect of a large Chinese army (about 30,000) at his doorstep. The court urged the king to flee, but he scornfully refused, saying he and his brother princes, sons of Alaungpaya, would fight the Chinese single-handed if they had to. Instead of defending the capital, Hsinbyushin calmly sent an army to take up position outside Singu, personally leading his men toward the front line. It turned out that Ming Rui had overstretched himself, and was in no position to proceed any farther. He was now too far away from his main supply base at Hsenwi, hundreds of miles away in the northern Shan Hills. The Burmese guerrilla attacks on the long supply lines across the jungles of the Shan Hills were seriously hampering the Qing army's ability to proceed. (Burmese guerrilla operations were directed by Gen. Teingya Minkhaung, a deputy of Maha Thiha Thura). Ming Rui now resorted to defensive tactics, playing for time to enable the northern army to come to his relief. But it was not to be. The northern army had suffered heavy casualties in their repeated attacks against the Kaungton fort. Its commander, against the express orders of Ming Rui, retreated back to Yunnan. (The commander was later publicly shamed and executed on the orders of the Emperor.) The situation turned worse for Ming Rui. By early 1768, battle- hardened Burmese reinforcements from Siam had begun to arrive back. Bolstered by the reinforcements, two Burmese armies led by Maha Thiha Thura and Ne Myo Sithu succeeded in retaking Hsenwi. The Qing commander at Hsenwi committed suicide. The main Qing army was now cut off from all supplies. It was now March 1768. Thousands of Bannermen from the freezing grasslands along the Russian border, began dying of malaria as well as Burmese attacks in the furnace-like hot weather of central Burma. Ming Rui gave up all hope of proceeding toward Ava, and instead tried to make it back to Yunnan with as many of his soldiers as possible. Battle of Maymyo In March 1768, Ming Rui began his retreat, pursued by a Burmese army of 10,000 men and 2000 cavalry. The Burmese then tried to encircle the Chinese by splitting the army into two. Maha Thiha Thura had now assumed the overall command, replacing Maha Sithu. The smaller army, led by Maha Sithu, continued to pursue Ming Rui while the larger army led by Maha Thiha Thura advanced through the mountainous route to emerge directly behind the Chinese. Through careful maneuvering, the Burmese managed to achieve complete encirclement of the Chinese at modern-day Pyinoolwin (Maymyo), about 50 miles northeast of Ava. Over the course of three days of bloody fighting at the Battle of Maymyo, the Bannerman army was completely annihilated. The slaughter was such that the Burmese could hardly grip their swords as the hilts were slippery with enemy blood. Of the original 30,000 men of the main army, only 2500 remained alive and were captured. The rest had been killed either on the battlefield, through disease or through execution after their surrender. Ming Rui himself was severely wounded in battle. Only a small group managed to break through and escaped the carnage. Ming Rui himself could have escaped with that group. Instead, he cut off his queue and sent it to the emperor as a token of his loyalty by those who were escaping. He then hanged himself on a tree. In the end, only a few dozen of the main army returned. Fourth invasion (1769) Intermission (1768–1769) The Qianlong Emperor had sent Ming Rui and his Bannermen assuming an easy victory. He had begun making plans about how he would administer his newest territory. For weeks, the Qing court had heard nothing, and then the news finally came. The Emperor was shocked and ordered an immediate halt to all military actions until he could decide what next to do. Generals returning from the front line cautioned that there was no way Burma could be conquered. But there was no real choice but to press on. Imperial prestige was at stake. The Emperor turned to one of his most trusted advisers, the chief grand councilor Fuheng, Ming Rui's uncle. Back in the 1750s, Fuheng had been one of the few senior officials who had fully backed the Emperor's decision to eliminate the Dzungars at a time when most believed that war was too risky. On 14 April 1768, the imperial court announced the death of Ming Rui and the appointment of Fuheng as the new chief commander of the Burma campaign. Manchu generals, Agui, Aligun and Suhede were appointed as his deputies. Now, the top rung of the Qing military establishment prepared for a final showdown with the Burmese. Before any fighting resumed, some on the Chinese side sent out peace feelers to the court of Ava. The Burmese also sent signals that they would like to give diplomacy a chance, given their preoccupations in Siam. But the emperor, with Fuheng's encouragement, made it clear that no compromise with the Burmese could be made. The dignity of the state demanded a full surrender. His aim was to establish direct Qing rule over all Burmese possessions. Emissaries were sent to Siam and Laotian states informing them of the Chinese ambition and seeking an alliance. Ava now fully expected another major invasion. Hsinbyushin had now brought most of the troops back from Siam to face the Chinese. With the Burmese fully preoccupied with the Chinese threat, the Siamese resistance retook Ayutthaya in 1768 and went on to reconquer all of their territories throughout 1768 and 1769. For the Burmese, their hard-fought gains of the prior three years (1765–1767) in Siam had gone to waste but there was little they could do. The survival of their kingdom was now at stake. Qing flotilla A Burmese war-boat on the Irrawaddy River Chinese battle plan Fuheng arrived in Yunnan in April, 1769 to take command of a 60,000-strong force. He studied past Ming and Mongol expeditions to form his battle plan, which called for a three-pronged invasion via Bhamo and the Irrawaddy river. The first army would attack Bhamo and Kaungton head-on, which he knew would be difficult. But two other larger armies would bypass Kaungton and march down the Irrawaddy, one on each bank of the river, to Ava. The twin invading armies on each side of the river would be accompanied by war boats manned by thousands of sailors from the Fujian Navy. To avoid a repeat of Ming Rui's mistake, he was determined to guard his supply and communication lines, and advance at a sustainable pace. He avoided an invasion route through the jungles of the Shan Hills so as to minimize the Burmese guerrilla attacks on his supply lines. He also brought in a full regiment of carpenters who would build fortresses and boats along the invasion route. Burmese battle plan For the Burmese, the overall objective was to stop the enemy at the border, and prevent another Chinese penetration into their heartland. Maha Thiha Thura was the overall commander, the role which he had assumed since the second half of the third invasion. As usual, Balamindin commanded the Kaungton fort. In the last week of September, three Burmese armies were dispatched to meet the three Chinese armies head-on. A fourth army was organized with the sole purpose of cutting the enemy supply lines. Hsinbyushin had also organized a flotilla of war boats to meet the Chinese war boats. The Burmese defenses now included French musketeers and gunners under the command of Pierre de Milard, governor of Tabe, who had arrived back from the Siamese theater. Based on their troop movements, the Burmese knew at least the general direction from where the massive invasion force would come. Maha Thiha Thura moved upriver by boat toward Bhamo. Invasion As the Burmese armies marched north, Fuheng, against the advice of his officers, decided not to wait until the end of the monsoon season. It clearly was a calculated gamble; he had wanted to strike before the Burmese arrived but he had also hoped that \\"miasma would not be everywhere.\\" So in October 1768, towards the end of (but still during) the monsoon season, Fuheng launched the largest invasion yet. The three Chinese armies jointly attacked and captured Bhamo. They proceeded south and built a massive fortress near Shwenyaungbin village, 12 miles east of the Burmese fortress at Kaungton. As planned, the carpenters duly built hundreds of war boats to sail down the Irrawaddy. But almost nothing went according to plan. One army did cross over to the western bank of the Irrawaddy, as planned. But the commander of that army did not want to march far away from the base. When the Burmese army assigned to guard the west bank approached, the Chinese retreated back to the east bank. Likewise, the army assigned to march down the eastern bank also did not proceed. This left the Chinese flotilla exposed. The Burmese flotilla came up the river and attacked and sank all the Chinese boats. The Chinese armies now converged on attacking Kaungton. But for four consecutive weeks, the Burmese put up a remarkable defense, withstanding gallant charges by the Bannermen to scale the walls. A little over a month into the invasion, the entire Qing invasion force was bogged down at the border. Predictably, many Chinese soldiers and sailors fell ill, and began to die in large numbers. Fuheng himself was struck down by fever. More ominously for the Chinese, the Burmese army sent to cut the enemy line of communication also achieved its purpose, and closed in on the Chinese armies from the rear. By early December, the Chinese forces were completely encircled. The Burmese armies then attacked the Chinese fort at Shwenyaungbin, which fell after a fierce battle. The fleeing Chinese troops fell back into the pocket near Kaungton where other Chinese forces were stationed. The Chinese armies were now trapped inside the corridor between the Shwenyaungbin and Kaungton forts, completely surrounded by rings of Burmese forces. Truce Military Minister Fuheng The Chinese command, which had already lost 20,000 men, and a quantity of arms and ammunition, now asked for terms. The Burmese staff were averse to granting terms, saying that the Chinese were surrounded like cattle in a pen, they were starving, and in a few days, they could be wiped out to a man. But Maha Thiha Thura, who oversaw the annihilation of Ming Rui's army at the battle of Maymyo in 1768, realized that another wipe-out would merely stiffen the resolve of the Chinese government. Maha Thiha Thura was said to have said: :Comrades, unless we make peace, yet another invasion will come. And when we have defeated it, yet another will come. Our nation cannot go on just repelling invasion after invasion of the Chinese for we have other things to do. Let us stop the slaughter, and let their people and our people live in peace. He pointed out to his commanders that war with the Chinese was quickly becoming a cancer that would finally destroy the nation. Compared to Chinese losses, Burmese losses were light but considered in proportion to the population, they were heavy. The commanders were not convinced but Maha Thiha Thura, on his own responsibility, and without informing the king, demanded that the Chinese agree to the following terms: # The Chinese would surrender all the sawbwas and other rebels and fugitives from Burmese justice who had taken shelter in Chinese territory; # The Chinese would undertake to respect Burmese sovereignty over those Shan states that had been historically part of Burma; # All prisoners of war would be released; # The emperor of China and the king of Burma would resume friendly relations, regularly exchanging embassies bearing letters of good will and presents. The Chinese commanders decided to agree to the terms. At Kaungton, on 13 December 1769 (or 22 December 1769), under a 7-roofed pyathat hall, 14 Burmese and 13 Chinese officers signed a peace treaty. The Chinese burned their boats and melted down their cannon. Two days later, as the Burmese stood to arms and looked down, starved Chinese soldiers marched sullenly away up the Taiping valley; they began to perish of hunger by thousands in the passes. Aftermath At Beijing, the Qianlong Emperor was not pleased with the treaty. He did not accept the Chinese commanders' explanation that the fourth stipulation—exchange of embassies bearing presents—amounted to Burmese submission and tribute. He did not permit the surrender of the sawbwas or other fugitives nor the resumption of trade between the two countries. At Ava, Hsinbyushin was furious that his generals had acted without his knowledge, and tore up his copy of the treaty. Knowing that the king was angry, the Burmese armies were afraid to return to the capital. In January 1770, they marched to Manipur where a rebellion had begun, taking advantage of Burmese troubles with the Chinese. After a three days' battle near Langthabal, the Meiteis were defeated, and their raja fled to Assam. The Burmese raised their nominee to the throne, and returned. The king's anger had subsided; after all, they had won victories and preserved his throne. Still, the king sent Maha Thiha Thura, the decorated general, whose daughter was married to Hsinbyushin's son and heir-apparent Singu, a woman's dress to wear, and exiled him and other generals to the Shan states. He would not allow them to see him. He also exiled ministers who dared to speak on their behalf. Although hostilities ceased, an uneasy truce ensued. None of the points in the treaty was honored by both sides. Because the Chinese did not return the sawbwas, the Burmese did not return the 2500 Chinese prisoners of war, who were resettled. The Qing had lost some of the generation's most important frontier experts, including Yang Yingju, Ming Rui, Aligun, and Fuheng (who eventually died of malaria in 1770). The war cost the Qing treasury 9.8 million silver taels. Nonetheless, the Emperor kept a heavy military lineup in the border areas of Yunnan for about one decade in an attempt to wage another war while imposing a ban on inter-border trade for two decades. The Burmese for years were preoccupied with another impending invasion by the Chinese, and kept a series of garrisons along the border. The high casualties of the war (in terms of the population size) and the ongoing need to guard the northern border seriously hampered the Burmese military's capability to renew warfare in Siam. It would be another five years when the Burmese sent another invasion force to Siam. It would be another twenty years when Burma and China resumed a diplomatic relationship in 1790. The resumption was brokered by the Tai-Shan nobles and Yunnan officials who wanted to see trade resume. To the Burmese, then under King Bodawpaya, the resumption was on equal terms, and they considered the exchange of presents as part of diplomatic etiquette, not as tribute. To the Chinese however, all of these diplomatic missions were considered as tributary missions. The Emperor viewed the resumption of relations as Burmese submission, and unilaterally claimed victory and included the Burma campaign in his list of Ten Great Campaigns. Significance Territorial changes Burma's successful defense laid the foundation for the present-day boundary between the two countries. The border still was not demarcated, and the borderlands were still overlapping spheres of influence. After the war, Burma remained in possession of Koshanpye, the nine states above Bhamo. At least down to the eve of the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824, the Burmese exerted authority over the southern Yunnan borderlands, as far as Kenghung (present-day Jinghong, Yunnan). Likewise, the Chinese exercised a degree of control over the borderlands, including present- day northeastern Kachin State. Overall, the Burmese were able to push back the line of control up to one that existed before the Qing consolidation drive of the 1730s. However, the war also forced the Burmese to withdraw from Siam. Their victory over the Qing is described as a moral victory. Historian G.E. Harvey writes: \\"Their other victories were over states on their own level such as Siam; this was won over an empire. Alaungpaya's crusade against the Mons was stained with treachery; the great siege of Ayuthaya was a magnificent dacoity\\", though he described the Sino-Burmese war \\"a righteous war of defense against the invader\\". Geopolitical The main beneficiaries of the war were the Siamese, who took full advantage of the Burmese absence to reclaim their lost territories and independence. By 1770, they had reconquered most of the pre-1765 territories. Only Tenesserim remained in Burmese hands. Preoccupied by the Chinese threat, and recovering from the depletion of manpower from the war, Hsinbyushin left Siam alone even as Siam continued to consolidate its gains. (He was finally forced to send Burmese armies to Siam in 1775 in response to a Siamese-backed rebellion in Lan Na a year earlier). In the following decades, Siam would become a power in its own right, swallowing up Lan Na, Laotian states, and parts of Cambodia. From a wider geopolitical standpoint, the Qing, and the Qianlong Emperor, who hitherto had never faced defeat, now had to accept—albeit grudgingly—that there were limits to Qing power. A historian of Chinese Military History, Marvin Whiting, writes that the Burmese success probably saved the independence of other states in Southeast Asia. Military For the Qing, the war highlighted limits to their military power. The Emperor blamed the low battle-worthiness of his Green Standard armies for the first two failed invasions. But he was to concede later that his Manchu Bannermen too were less suited to fighting in Burma than in Xinjiang. Despite sending in 50,000 and 60,000 troops in the last two invasions, the Qing command lacked up-to-date information about invasion routes, and had to consult centuries-old maps to form their battle plan. This unfamiliarity exposed their supply and communication lines to repeated Burmese attacks, and allowed their main armies to be encircled in the last three invasions. The Burmese scorched earth policy meant that the Chinese were vulnerable to supply line cuts. Perhaps most importantly, the Qing soldiers proved ill-suited to fight in the tropical climate of Burma. In the last three invasions, thousands of Chinese troops became ill with malaria and other tropical diseases, and many perished as a result. This neutralized the Chinese advantage of superior numbers, and allowed the Burmese to engage the Chinese armies head-to-head towards the end of the campaigns. The war is considered the peak of Konbaung military power. Historian Victor Lieberman writes: \\"These near simultaneous victories over Siam (1767) and China (1765–1769) testified to a truly astonishing elan unmatched since Bayinnaung.\\" The Burmese military proved that they were able and willing to take on a far superior enemy, using their familiarity with the terrain and the weather to their maximum advantage. (The Battle of Maymyo is now a military case study of infantry fighting against a larger army.) Yet it proved that there were limits to the Burmese military power. The Burmese learned that they could not fight two simultaneous wars, especially if one of them was against the world's largest military. Hsinbyushin's reckless decision to fight a two-front war nearly cost the kingdom its independence. Moreover, their losses, while smaller than Qing losses, were heavy in proportion to her much smaller size of population, hampering their military capability elsewhere. Konbaung's military power would plateau in the following decades. It made no progress against Siam. Its later conquests came only against smaller kingdoms to the west—Arakan, Manipur and Assam.

J. Hughes Business House, also known as C.J. Wilson Store, is located at 70 Ocoee Street in Cleveland, Tennessee, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description The two-story red brick building was built in the 1840s, not long after the platting of the city of Cleveland in 1838. The building design is described by the Historic American Buildings Survey as having \\"embellishments\\" that demonstrate \\"the civic pride and leadership of J. H. Craigmiles\\", while otherwise being similar to many small-town commercial buildings of the era. Facing the street there is a one-story, three-bay cast-iron front, estimated to have been added around 1880. It includes a recessed, panelled, double door and a pair of display windows made from plate glass and is topped by a decorative cast-iron architrave. The second-story windows have limestone sills and are topped by segmental arches. Decorative iron work ornaments the vents above the windows. The facade is crowned by a cornice made from stamped tin. Other decorative elements are found in the brick work below the windows and corbelled brick work below the cornice. History The building's first recorded owner was William H. Tibbs, who operated a retail store. He sold the building in 1850, but continued to be associated with the building, which housed the Tibbs and Surguine Dry Goods Store as of 1860, when Cleveland was described as \\"an active business place\\" with about 20 stores. In subsequent years, Tibbs partnered with W.J. Hughes to operate a store in the building, and Hughes became the sole proprietor after Tibbs died. Around 1890, a saloon operated by F. P. Kelly and J. P. Cooper took the place of the store. One of five saloons in the city, it closed down some time after the city of Cleveland enacted a prohibition ordinance in 1903. The building was later sold to C. J. Wilson, who opened a store there in 1909; his son J. L. Wilson later took over the business. The C.J. and J.L. Wilson Dry Goods store remained in business until J. L. Wilson's circa the early 1970s. As of 1983, the building housed a law office.

Built in 1904 and enlarged in 1911, it housed Portland's largest department store for many years, and is a fine example Renaissance Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. It now houses the primary campus facilities of the Maine College of Art. Description and history The Porteous, Mitchell and Braun Company Building is located in Portland's Arts District at the upper end of Congress Street. It occupies the middle portion of a city block on the south side of Congress Street, between Oak and Brown Streets. It is a five-story structure, with a steel frame and brick walls clad in limestone-colored terra cotta. The ground floor facade is entirely modern, with glass and stone, and is topped by a marquee identifying the building's current occupant, the Maine College of Art. The second through fourth floors are divided into six bays, articulated by fluted pilasters. Each bay houses a three-part window, with a larger central pane separated by smaller side ones by slender engaged columns. Between the floors are decorative panels. The top floor is separated from the others by a dentillated cornice, and also has six bays separated by pilasters, each bay housing three round-arch windows. A corbelled cornice tops the structure. The building was constructed in 1904 to plans by architect Penn Varney of Lynn, Massachusetts, for the Portland dry goods firm of Watson, Miller & Company, and was originally three bays wide. In 1906 that firm was acquired by the Connecticut retailer Porteous, Mitchell and Braun, which doubled the building's size in 1911, and commissioned the unifying facade from local architect George Burnham. Further expansions enlarged the building to the rear, reaching Free Street by 1953. Porteous operated on the premises until 1991, and was for many years the city's leading department store. The building then underwent restoration and adaptation for use by the Maine College of Art. See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Portland, Maine *Charles Q.

His family comprises his mother (Kalaranjini) and his widowed sister Raji (Nandini) and her two kids. There is also his eldest sister (Zeenath), who is married to a businessman named Sundaran (Sreehari). One day, while Sooryanarayanan is on a hospital visit with his niece, he sees someone who sends the shivers down his spine. That someone is Simon Thekkilakaadan (Vijayaraghavan), who is crippled and in a wheelchair, and presents a rather pitiful sight. Thekkilakaadan is accompanied by his sons and others. On seeing them, Sooryanarayanan is shocked and frightened, and hides away in corner. On his way back home, he recollects the incidents of his past, beginning with his father Harinarayanan (Saikumar), a gifted singer of classical music, who was his guru too. From there his memory traces events one by one. He remembers how he nursed ambitions of becoming a good singer himself, and how shocked he was when he came to know of the huge debts incurred by his father in the course of looking after the needs of the family. He sets out to get a job to help his father clear the liabilities and joins a bank. Things are going fine when one day he accidentally meets his college-mate and friend Cheriyan (Suresh Krishna), who is a former minister. The meeting is destined to be a turning point in Sooryan's life and gradually he meanders into a world of crime and goondaism.

Biography Saeki was born in Osaka as the son of a Buddhist priest. He was interested in art from an early age, and imitated the Impressionist style Kuroda Seiki while learning art in middle school. He moved to Koishikawa (now part of Bunkyō in Tokyo) in 1917 to study art under Takeji Fujishima and enrolled in the western art department of the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in 1918. He married fellow painter Yoneko Ikeda in 1921. In the summer of 1924, Saeki moved to France with his wife and daughter. He attended the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, where fellow Japanese painter Katsuzo Satomi introduced him to the Fauvist painter, anarchist and journalist Maurice de Vlaminck, who was strongly critical of his work, and whose comments influenced his later technique. Saeki favored portraiture and landscape paintings of Parisian city scenes, especially the backstreets, bars and buildings in the style of Maurice Utrillo or Vincent van Gogh. In 1925, two of his works were accepted by the Salon d’Automne. Saeki returned to Japan in 1926 at the urging of his family and formed an artists' society called \\"1930-nen Kyokai\\" (Society of the Year 1930) together with Satomi and other artists returning from France. The same year, he also won the Nika prize at the 13th Nikaten, an exhibition held by The Second Society in opposition to the more conservative, government- sponsored Bunten exhibition. However, Saeki could not find inspiration in the suburbs of Tokyo, and in August 1927, traveling via the Trans-Siberian Railway, he returned to France. Despite his worsening health, he frequently painted outdoors in inclement weather. His frenetic efforts at depicting the streets of Paris led to a deterioration in the tuberculosis he had long suffered from. By March 1928, he was largely bedridden. He also had a nervous breakdown, and died destitute in a mental hospital in the Paris suburbs.

Best known for winning Pro Tour Yokohama in 2007, Wafo-Tapa's career has featured three other Pro Tour top eights, and six Grand Prix top eights. He is also known as a deck designer and for his strong preference for control decks. In 2014, Wafo-Tapa was voted into the Magic: The Gathering Hall of Fame.  Career  Beginning his Pro Tour career in 2001 at Pro Tour Barcelona, Wafo-Tapa first came to prominence not for his playing abilities but for his deck design. In collaboration with Guillaume Matignon, he designed the deck used by Pierre Canali to win Pro Tour Columbus in 2005. The following season, he had his first strong finish on the Pro Tour. Playing a deck that would later be known as Wafo-Tapa control, he finished 12th at Pro Tour Honolulu, missing the top eight on tie-breakers. Wafo-Tapa would play every Pro Tour that season, and earn enough points to qualify him for every event the following season. His standard deck from the World Championship, Dralnu du Louvre, became one of the defining decks in standard over the following months. The 2007 season was Wafo-Tapa's break-out year. Following a top sixteen finish in Geneva, he made the top eight of Pro Tour Yokohama, joining a group that featured Hall of Fame member Raphaël Lévy, Japanese star-player Masashi Oiso, and players like Mark Herberholz, and Tomoharu Saito who had both won Pro Tours in the previous season. Defeating Paulo Carvalho and both Pro Tour Honolulu champions (Mark Herberholz, 2006, and Kazuya Mitamura, 2009), Wafo-Tapa won the tournament. With a 14th-place finish at Pro Tour Valencia, a 22nd-place finish at the World Championships, and an unremarkable 123rd place at Pro Tour San Diego, Wafo-Tapa finished third in the player of the year race. To begin the 2008 season, he reached the top eight of a Pro Tour a second time. The Pro Tour Kuala Lumpur top eight featured three other Pro Tour Champions, including Hall of Famers Jon Finkel and Nicolai Herzog. Wafo-Tapa lost his quarterfinal match to Jon Finkel, the eventual champion, without winning a single game. Wafo- Tapa's success continued through the next event, finishing 13th at Pro Tour Hollywood. Quick 'n' Toast, the deck he designed for the event, also became one of the format defining decks. The rest of the 2008 season was not very remarkable, with Wafo-Tapa finishing below 200th place at both the remaining Pro Tours. This trend continued through the 2009 season. He earned only ten Pro Points that year and lost his standing invitation to the Pro Tour. This did little to deter Wafo-Tapa, who went so far as to tell coverage reporter Rich Hagon that \\"It will be fine\\". This prediction turned out to be true. While his finishes at Pro Tours San Diego and San Juan, were rather unimpressive, he made back to back top eights at Pro Tour Amsterdam and the World Championship. Once again, Wafo-Tapa's fellow top eight competitors in Amsterdam featured multiple winners in the form of Brian Kibler, and the German Juggernaut, Kai Budde. Wafo-Tapa lost in the quarterfinals a second time, to Belgian Marijn Lybaert. At the 2010 World Championship, he made it all the way to the finals before losing to long-time friend and colleague, Guillaume Matignon. On April 28, 2011, Wizards of the Coast announced that Guillaume Wafo-Tapa was suspended for a year and a half, until October 2012, following a confession of his involvement in the spoiling of the New Phyrexia \\"God Book\\" several weeks before Wizards of the Coast was due to commence its spoiler season. The so-called \\"God Book\\" contained a spoiler of the entire set. Wafo–Tapa's teammate 2010 Magic World Champion Guillaume Matignon received the \\"God Book\\" so that he could write an article for the French magazine Lotus Noir about the upcoming release.  Achievements  World of Warcraft TCG Guillaume Wafo-Tapa has also had some success playing other trading card games.

Bartholomew Howlett (1767–1827), was an English draughtsman and engraver. Howlett was born in Louth in Lincolnshire in 1767. He was the son, by his first marriage, of Bartholomew Howlett, a native of Norfolk, who was settled at Louth. Howlett came to London and served as apprentice to James Heath, the engraver. He worked mainly on topographical and antiquarian works. In 1801 he engraved and published A Selection of Views in the County of Lincoln, with seventy-five plates from drawings by Thomas Girtin, John Nash, and others, of which a later edition appeared in 1805.A selection of Views in the county of Lincoln (Miller, 1801). He also executed plates for Wilkinson's Londina Illustrata, Bentham's History of Ely, Frost's Notices of Hull, George Anderson's Plan and Views of the Abbey Royal of St. Denys, the Gentleman's Magazine, and similar works. In 1817 he made a number of drawings for a projected History of Clapham, of which one number only was published. When the Royal Hospital of St. Katherine, near the Tower of London, was pulled down in 1826, Howlett made a number of drawings, with a view to a publication, which never appeared. He made drawings of about a thousand seals of English monastic and religious houses for the notable antiquary John Caley (d. 1834).
