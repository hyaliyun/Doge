Additional protocols and data models being built on top of the core of JMAP for handling contacts and calendar synchronization are meant to be potential replacements for CardDAV and CalDAV, and other support is currently in the works.  Motivation  Developers Bron Gondwana and Neil Jenkins wrote on the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) news site that \\"the current open protocols connecting email clients and servers, such as IMAP, were not designed for the modern age.\\" They wrote that \\"IMAP is resource hungry, difficult for developers to learn, and does not work well for network- constrained mobile devices.\\" And they noted that it interfaces in a complicated way with other protocols like SMTP, CalDAV, and CardDAV, and with calendars and contacts. They believe that IMAP and SMTP are ill-suited to modern mobile networks and in high-latency scenarios, and as a result, this has led to a stagnation in the quality of (especially free) email clients, and to a proliferation of proprietary protocols for instance for Google's Gmail and Microsoft's Outlook, all of which are meant to mitigate the major drawbacks of using the current generation of popular protocols.  Design  Gondwana and Jenkins wrote, \\"JMAP is the result of efforts to address shortcomings [in existing protocols], providing a modern, efficient, easy-to- use API, built on many years of experience and field testing.\\" The protocol was developed with the intention of providing a modern open, reliable, and easy-to-use solution, and as a result it relies heavily upon the commonly- implemented JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). According to Gondwana of Fastmail  which has been a leading developer of the protocol  \\"The use of JSON and HTTP as the basis of JMAP was always a key point — it means that people wanting to build something on top of email don’t have to re-implement complex parsers or find a software library in order to get started.\\" After atmail decided to implement JMAP, CEO Dave Richards wrote in 2018 that \\"the complexities required to implement IMAP in both user and server side software has resulted in user difficulties and a lack of software options, along with a rigid user experience...The new JMAP protocol solves the existing issues and is modular enough to take advantage of future technology. JMAP makes email better.\\"  Development  JMAP started around 2014 as an internal development project by the Australia-based email provider Fastmail. Starting in 2017 a working group at the IETF has been leading the development and standardization process. The core protocol and mail specifications were published in July and August of 2019 by Neil Jenkins of Fastmail and Chris Newman of Oracle, as RFC 8620 and RFC 8621. The WebSocket specification was later published in August 2020 as RFC 8887. Other ongoing JMAP drafts at IETF are for dealing with calendars, contacts, Message Disposition Notification (return receipts), quotas, Sieve mail filtering, and S/MIME signature verification. The working group has set milestones for these to be finalised by the end of 2020.  Implementations  As of version 3.0 Apache Software Foundation’s free mail- server Apache James has “experimental” support for JMAP. The OpenPaas collaboration platform provides a webmail implementation supporting James and JMAP. * Cyrus IMAP supports JMAP core and mail, with “experimental” support for calendars and contacts, as of version 3.2.0 released in May 2020. * Ltt.rs is a proof of concept email client for Android that only supports JMAP.

She was also a regular on Everyman's Theater,, Green Valley, U.S.A., and Hilda Hope, M.D. In the 1970s, she returned to radio to perform in episodes of CBS Radio Mystery Theater. She reprised the role of \\"Hope Melton Evans\\" on October 9, 1945 in an experimental CBS television broadcast of Big Sister. On April 18, 1945, she performed in an experimental TV variety program, Women in Wartime, also on CBS. Kalish made appearances in three episodes (\\"Salt of the Earth\\", \\"The Midway\\", \\"Terror in the Streets\\") of the ABC series Actors Studio.

First flown in the late 1930s, about 530 were built, some remaining in service into the 1960s. Design and development The first primary glider designed and built by the MSrE (Müegyetemi Sportrepülő Egyesület or in English the Technical University's Sports Flying Group) was the EMESE-B. It was designed to have better performance than existing examples of this class but did not prove popular. One of its designers was Ernő Rubik who used this experience to produce the R-05 Vöcsök, a simpler, lower performance aircraft. Like the EMESE-B it was a typical open frame (uncovered flat girder fuselage) glider with its wing mounted on top of the girder and strut-braced. This prototype proved very successful. Production aircraft were designated R-07 with the name Vöcsök if the pilot's seat was enclosed within a nacelle as it had been on the EMESE-B. R-07s with the seat completely exposed had the name Tücsök. This naming convention was maintained through the R-06 Csóvöcsök, a later, one-off tube (csó) steel fuselage version. The R-07 models, whether Vöcsöks or Tücsöks, were all-wood aircraft, with a wing built around two spars and rectangular in plan out to blunted tips. Because the nacelle increased the empty weight of the Vöcsök by (22%) it needed a longer span wing with 13% grater area than the Tücsök. The forward spar was close to the plywood-covered leading edge and the rest of the wing was fabric-covered. Broad chord ailerons filled the outer 40% of the span. The post-war R-07D Vöcsök introduced Frise ailerons. The wing was braced with streamlined steel V-struts to the lower fuselage. A flat, wooden, diagonally-braced girder formed the fuselage of all R-07s, with a deepened, ply-covered forward lower chord, longeron or keel which supported the wing struts, the pilot's seat and controls and, on its underside, a rubber sprung landing skid. On Vöcsöks the keel also supported a ply nacelle which enclosed the pilot, with fabric covering behind it to the first diagonal fuselage member. The nacelle lengthened the Vöcsök by . At the rear there was a narrow fin mounting a deep, fabric-covered balanced rudder with a trapezoidal profile. A roughly triangular tailplane was mounted on the top of the fuselage and forward of the rudder post. It was fabric-covered apart from a ply leading edge and carried constant chord elevators separated by a small nick for rudder movement. R-07b Vöcsök Operational history Despite the large number built (c.530 including all variants), remaining in use from 1938 to the early 60s, little is recorded in English about individual examples or their distribution over Hungarian aeroclubs. A 1981 replica R-07b, HA-2336, remained active until at least 2008.

History Land grew up between Washington and Anchorage, Alaska, in a middle class household. A car accident at age 16 led to her having post-traumatic stress disorder which was later exacerbated by her financial struggles. In her late twenties, she lived in Port Townsend, Washington, where she had her first child and became a single mother who worked maid service jobs to support her family. Although she did not grow up in poverty, she spent the next several years living below the poverty line and relied on several welfare programs to cover necessary expenses; this later informed her writing on issues of poverty and public policy. After six years of cleaning in Washington and Missoula she was eventually able to use student loans and Pell grants to move to earn a Bachelor of Arts in English and Creative Writing from the University of Montana. During her studies, she published her first public writing in the form of blog posts and local publications followed by Internet-based publications such as The Huffington Post and Vox. Upon graduating from the University of Montana, Land ended her dependence on food stamps, started working as a freelance writer, and became a writing fellow with the Center for Community Change. Land is married to Tim Faust and their family has four children. Maid In 2019, Land's debut book Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay and a Mother's Will to Survive was released. It debuted at #3 on The New York Times Best Seller list. The book was an elaboration of a 2015 post that she made to Vox. The book has received critical acclaim. In USA Today, Sharon Peters praised the book's honesty, writing that it fills the \\"with much candid detail about the frustrations with the limitations of programs she relied on. It is a picture of the soul-robbing grind through poverty that millions live with every day.\\" Emily Cooke of The New York Times summed up her review by focusing on the clarity of Land's suffering in the work: \\"Land survived the hardship of her years as a maid, her body exhausted and her brain filled with bleak arithmetic, to offer her testimony. It’s worth listening to.\\" Katy Read of The Star Tribune suggests, \\"The next time you hear someone say they think poor people are lazy, hand them a copy of Maid. Stephanie Land can tell them otherwise and, unlike most authors who write about poverty, speaks from personal—and recent—experience.\\" In The Washington Post, Jenner Rogers writes, \\"Maid isn’t about how hard work can save you but about how false that idea is. It’s one woman’s story of inching out of the dirt and how the middle class turns a blind eye to the poverty lurking just a few rungs below—and it’s one worth reading.\\" Kirkus Reviews concludes that Maid is \\"[a]n important memoir that should be required reading for anyone who has never struggled with poverty.\\" List of works\\"I Spent 2 Years Cleaning Houses.

Plot  Luther Albright is a devoted father and a designer of dams, a self-controlled man who believes he can engineer happiness for his family by sheltering them from his own emotions. But when an earthquake shakes his Sacramento home, the world Luther has constructed with such care begins to tilt: his son's behavior becomes increasingly bizarre and threatening, his loving wife seems to grow distant, the house he built with his own hands shows its first signs of decay, and a dam of his design comes under investigation for structural flaws exposed by the tremors.

This is a portrait of an ordinary man who finds himself tested and strives not to be found wanting.

Jacobs. Plot The plot begins shortly after the end of the events of The Secret of the Swordfish. China is torn apart by the clash between the Maoists and the nationalists of Chiang Kai-shek. Captain Blake is instructed by the Intelligence Service to travel to Hong Kong to ensure its protection. In London, Mortimer is interested in a Chinese archaeological object, but he quickly realizes that he is not alone in coveting it. A warlord, Xi-Li, is waiting for the opportunity to take advantage of the Chinese conflict to secure his power over the entire country, thanks to a mysterious manuscript. He also recruits a former officer of Basam-Damdu, the late dictator of Lhasa: Colonel Olrik.  Making of the album  The Valley of the Immortals is the first album designed by Peter Van Dongen and Teun Berserik. The two designers are each distributed 27 of the 54 plates of the album and draw each one on his side, then correct each other. Teun Berserik believes that his strong points are the technical part and the characters, while the city sets are the strong point of Peter Van Dongen. The cover, which shows Mortimer travelling in the streets of Hong Kong by rickshaw, is a reference to The Blue Lotus, published by Hergé in 1934-1935. That album's minor character \\"Gibbons\\" makes a cameo appearance. The plot, meanwhile, is written by Yves Sente, which is the eighth album he has done for Blake and Mortimer, the first having been The Voronov Plot published in 2000. The album explores a period that Jacobs said nothing in his albums: the one following the end of the Third World War recounted by The Secret of the Swordfish. Sente also tries to explain what happened to Olrik after his defeat alongside the dictator Basam-Damdu at the end of the Secret of the Swordfish. The theme of immortality, placed at the heart of the plot, seeks to pick up keywords typically \\"Jacobian\\" to stay close to the atmosphere of albums by EP Jacobs. The album was printed in 400,000 copies for its launch in bookstores in mid-November 2018.

The Gavà Mines, also known as Can Tintorer Mines, is a pre-historic (Neolithic) archaeological site that occupies the Can Tintorer, Ferreres and Rocabruna areas in the municipality of Gavà (Baix Llobregat, Catalonia, Spain).M. J. Villalba, L. Bañolas, J. Arenas, and M. Alonso (1983): Les Mines Neolítiques de Can Tintorer, Gavà. Excavacions 1978-80 (in Catalan). In the series Exacavacions Arqueològiques a Catalunya, volume 6. Published by the Generalitat de Catalunya. The site is under care of the Gavà Museum and the Gavà Mines Archaeological Park. The main feature of the site is a collection of ancient mines that are among the largest and oldest in Europe. The site is spread over 200 hectares and comprises more than a hundred known mines, with many more possibly to be still unidentified. Among them are the only known Neolithic mines of variscite, a green mineral used to make body ornaments.Enric Calpena (2007-05): \\"Dins de les entranyes de la prehistòria\\" (in Catalan). Sàpiens, issue 55, page 63. From the Iberian and Roman times through the Middle Ages, the mines were re-exploited to obtain iron ore. Notable finds from the site are the Venus of Gavà and the Trepanation Skull.  Geographic and geological situation  The Gavà mines are located on the West side of the Llobregat River, at the foot of the eastern slopes of the Garraf Massif, in the sectors known as Ferreres, Rocabruna and Tintorer. The geological structure of the area is dominated by slates and limestones of the Paleozoic era, formed between the Silurian and Devonian periods, about 408 million years ago. Slates and limestones are arranged in strongly inclined layers with numerous folds, faults, and overlays, due to folding during the Variscan orogeny (290 million years ago) and the Alpine orogeny (65 million years ago). There are two geologic alignments that vary between WNW-ESE and W-E. A limestone crust and red clays formed at the beginning of the Quaternary (1.64 million years ago), covering the Paleozoic slates and limestones.Alícia Estrada (2007): Guia del Parc Arqueològic Mines de Gavà / Guide to the Archaeological Park of Mines of Gavà. Municipal Institute for the Management of the Cultural and Natural Heritage of Gavà.  Modern history  The site was discovered in 1975 when construction in the neighborhood of Can Tintorer revealed openings to the rock. However, the presence of \\"holes\\" in the ground was known to the local population, which had been using some of them since antiquity. Building that houses the Archaeological Park of the Mines of Gavà In 1978 the original nucleus of the CIPAG (Collective for the Investigation of Prehistory and Archeology of the Garraf-Ordal) began the first archaeological excavations. The Gavà Museum was created later in that year, with the mission to explore the site and research, store, and divulge its finds. Until the year 1980, the located mines were excavated and the ground was reduced mechanically to locate new ones. In 1991 the Gavà Museum assumed the excavations, and part of the museum was opened to the public in 1993. It was during those years that two of the unique pieces of the site were discovered: the Venus of Gavà and the Trepaned Skull. In parallel to the excavations and the dissemination, the works of conservation and restoration began with the collaboration of the Department of Mining and Natural Resources of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. After a break, the excavations and restoration and consolidation work were resumed between 1998 and 2000. Additional excavation, conservation, and research were carried out by the University of Barcelona and the Autonomous University of Barcelona Reconstruction of a mine. Due to an urban development project, in 1998 a new sector of the site was identified in the Serra de les Ferreres. The works will last until 2009. New Neolithic and Iberian-Roman mines (number 83, 84 and 85) were located and excavated, yielding funerary artifacts with exceptional pieces such as a red coral necklace, an obsidian plate, square-shaped ceramics and honey silex.  Timeline  The Neolithic mines were continuously exploited between the Advanced Old Neolithic or Postcardial and the Middle Neolithic, as evidenced by ceramics characteristic of the Molinot culture of the Postcardial and to the Ditch Tomb Culture of the Middle Neolithic . Carbon-14 dating puts the Postcardial sites between 3350 and 2950 BCE (not calibrated) and those of the Middle Neolithic between 2950 and 2550 BC (not calibrated). This would place them between 4200 BC and 3400 BC.J. Bosch Argilagos, A. Estrada Martín, and M. J. Noain Maura (1996): \\"Minería neolítica en Gavà (Baix Llobregat, Barcelona)\\" (in Spanish). Trabajos de Prehistoria, volume 53, issue 1, pages 59-71. It must be borne in mind, however, that dating comes from samples belonging to the mining waste after the mines became inactive; therefore, the exploitation may be earlier. Indeed, variscite from Gavà has been found in the Can Sadurní Cave near Begues with Postcardial dates prior to those identified in Gavà.M. Edo, F. Antolín, and M. J. Barrio (2012): \\" Can Sadurní (Begues, Baix Llobregat), de la captación de recursos abióticos al inicio de la minería de aluminio-fosfatos (10500-4000 cal ANE) en el macizo de Garraf\\" (in Spanish). Rubricatum, issue 5 (Actes del Congrés Internacional Xarxes al Neolític), pages 299-306. Other samples, found in Huesca province at the Chaves Cave (near Bastarás) and Moro Cave (near Olvena), were chemically confirmed as Gavà but located in burials of the Old Neolithic from the 6th millennium BCE.Vicenç Baldellou, Pilar Utrilla, Jesús García-Gazólaz (2012): \\"Variscita de Can Tintorer en el Neolítico Antiguo del valle medio del Ebro\\" (in Spanish). Rubricatum, issue 5 (Actes del Congrés Internacional Xarxes al Neolític), pages 307-314. There are no agreed-on dates for the Ibero-Roman mines, but the exploitation would be located between the 4th and 9th centuries CE.Amaia Bordas, Roger Molinas, Manuel Saa, Joan Carles Melgarejo, and Saleh Lehbib (2010): \\"Les mines històriques al sector de la serra de les Ferreres: darreres aportacions a l’estudi de la minería del ferro a Gavà\\" (in Catalan). Rubricatum, issue 4, pages 247-262.  Neolithic period  = Flora = Diorama of local Neolithic landscape, at the Museum. In the Neolithic, the inhabitants of the site had access to varied vegetation environments from the surrounding mountains, plain, and coast. Along the coastline the flora was mainly oleo-ceratonion shrubland, with shrubs like the European fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), lentisk (Pistacia lentiscus), heather (Erica sp.), olive tree (Olea europaea), juniper (Juniperus sp.) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis). Elsewhere there were forests of sclerophyllous and deciduous oak trees (Quercus sp.), strawberry trees (Arbutus unedo), buckthorns (Rhamnus sp.) or mock privet (Phillyrea sp.), and adler (Alnus sp.), as attested by charcoal fragments found in the mines.Raquel Piqué (2009): \\"[ Les fustes carbonitzades de l'època neolítica de les mines 83, 84, 85 i 90 de Gavà: paisatge i recursos]\\" (in Catalan). Rubricatum, issue 4, pages 193-199. Some of these trees were exploited for their wood. Along rivers there grew forests with willows (Salix sp.), poplar, laurel (Laurus nobilis), ferns , kermes oak (Quercus coccifera) and cultivated fields. =Food resources= Soil deposits in the mines, dated from the Neolithic, yielded animal and vegetable remains, and tools such as arrowheads, hand grinders, axe heads and sickle teeth; showing that the caves had other uses besides mining. The presence of ruderal species and adventitious plants, as well as the association Rumex-Plantago-Cyperaceae shows the existence of disturbed and nitrified soils due to anthropogenic actions such as agriculture and livestock. Animal resources were used and exploited for food and secondary products like milk, wool, and leather. The main livestock was bovids, followed by ovicaprids and some pigs. The animal diet was complemented by hunting, chiefly of deer, wild boar and rabbits; and by fishing of seabream (Pagrus pagrus), pandora (Pagellus erythrinus), cuttlefish, and school shark (Galeorhinus galeus). Shellfish was collected for both food and ornamental purposes , including Chamelea gallina, the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), limpets (Patella sp.), and bittersweet clams (Glycymeris sp.). Land mollusks such as the vineyard snail (Cernuella virgata), grove snail (Cepaea nemoralis), and cabrilla (Otala punctata) were consumed too. The crops were mainly of barley (Hordeum vulgare and H. vulgare var. nudum) and, to a lesser extent, of wheat (Triticum monococcum, Triticum dicoccum, and Triticum aestivum). Legumes such as vetches (Vicia sp.) were also cultivated. The inhabitants also collected wild plant resources, such as olives, fox grapes (Vitis labrusca) and hazelnuts (Corylus avellana).J. Bosch, A. Estrada, et al. (1994): El Neolític Postcardial a les Mines Prehistòriques de Gavà (Baix Llobregat) (in Catalan). Issue 0 of Rubricatum. Published by Museu de Gavà. =Technology= The local inhabitants of the site during the Neolithic mining period used tools made of bone, and both chipped and polished stone. The chipped artifacts included flint and obsidian blades. They also used ceramic pots made of local clay and generally baked over open fires.Josep Bosch and Anna Gómez (2009): \\"Estudi de les ceramiques neolítiques procedents de les mines 83, 84, 85 i 90 de Gavà\\" (in Catalan). Rubricatum, issue 4, pages 63-83. Published by Museu de Gavà. Characteristic ceramics found among grave offerings include wide-mouth pots with a perforated horizontal ridge at mid- height, presumably intended to be suspended by ropes; and rectangular box-like bowls. = Burials = Once exhausted, some Neolithic mines were reused as tombs. Those burials contain remains of men and women, including children, adults and old men. Some bodies were placed in collective burials in the entrance well to the mine. After displacing the remains previously buried, the body was placed in a fetal position which was accompanied by funerary offerings (ceramics, tools, ornaments, etc.). In some cases, olive tree branches were burned. Individual and double burials were richer and more elaborate. They are found in small rooms, in places deep and away from the entrance of the mine. The burial space was closed with slabs and access to the mine was also closed with large slabs and stones. =Society and beliefs = Neolithic cabin model at the mining archaeological park The mine burials give some information on the society and culture of the Neolithic community. The average life expectancy was around 30 years; The average height of men was 164 cm and that of women 151 cm. In the bones of some individuals—men and women—there is evidence compatible with mining work, which may show specialization of labor. These signs include development of muscular inserts that denote flexing and extending the arms, carrying weight on the back, strong wrists, flexing of the legs at the hip joint and rotation of the torso. The differences in burials may be indicative of social inequalities. The burials also provide evidence of medico-sanitary practices, including healed bone fractures and an individual who survived two skull trepanations. The exploitation of variscite and its association to burials suggests that it had symbolic value. The same can be said of the practice of burying the dead in the mines. It has been conjectured that the stone's green color was symbolic of life; and the fetal position of the bodies, as well as the funerary offerings, reflected a cult of the Earth and belief in rebirth. That the community had specific religious beliefs is strongly indicated by figurines such as the Venus of Gavà, which has been interpreted as a fertility goddess Another puzzling find, that may have religious significance, is a large collection of artifacts including bone tools, arrowheads, variscite beads, and more, in mine 85.Ferran Borrell, Eva Orri (2009): \\"L'excavació de les mines neolítiques 83, 84, 85 i 90 de Gavà: estructura, ús, reutilització i rebliment\\" (in Catalan). Rubricatum, issue 4 (Intervenciós arqueològiques a les Mines de Gavà (sector de les Ferreres  Anys 1998-2009.), pages 15-46. =Mine structure and contents= The Neolithic mines varied significantly in size, geometry, and archaeological contents. Below are some representative examples. Mine 83 Mine 83 was excavated in 1999-2003. Access is through a vertical well about 1 m in diameter and 1.5 m deep. At the bottom, two galleries branch off in roughly opposite directions, about 1 m wide and tall: one straight and level, 2 m long, and the other bent at a right angle, 4 m long, descending another 1.5m. After the mine was exhausted, it apparently lay empty for a long time. Then a funerary chamber, about 1.5 m by 2 m, was dug off the \\"elbow\\" of the longer gallery, to hold the burial of one or more individuals. The mine was then sealed off: the burial chamber was closed with two limestone slabs, the entrances of the two galleries were blocked with soil and irregular stone blocks 20–25 cm wide. The entrance well then was blocked with a large boulder, roughly egg-shaped, about 1.3 m tall and 90 cm wide, and more soil. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the mine was dug before 4050 BCE and closed after that date (plus or minus a couple of centuries).Ferran Borrell, Josep Bosch, and Oriol Vicente (2009): \\"Datacions per radiocarboni a les mines neolítiques de la serra de les Ferreres de Gavà\\" (in Catalan). Rubricatum, issue 4, pages 241-246. Apart from the burial chamber, the only objects found in mine 83 were a ceramics plate and some animal remains from the mining phase, and some ceramics fragments mixed in the soil used to seal off the burial. In the funerary chamber were found a rectangular box-like ceramic bowl (with traces of fatty acids, suggesting that it contained lard or tallow, possibly part of a confitJordi Tresserras (2009): \\"Anàlisi de residus en ceràmica neolítica.

Rubricatum, issue 4, pages 133-137. a handful of variscite bits, and two necklaces (one of variscite with polished oval beads,Ferran Borrell, Alícia Estrada (2009): \\"Elements ornamentals neolítics de variscita trobats a les mines 83 i 85 de Gavà (in catalan).

Ŕubricatum, issue 4, pages 181-184. The bones seem to belong to a single adult individual, but they were extremely fragmented and incomplete, so the sex could not be determined. The skull was completely missing, except for a few pieces of broken teeth.Anfruns Josep (2009): \\"Estudi antropològic de les restes humanes neolítiques de la mina 83 de Gavà\\" (in Catalan). Rubricatum, issue 4, pages 207-208. Mine 84 Mine 84 was excavated in 1999-2003. This mine has a complex geometry and history. The original opening was a vertical well about 1.5 m deep and 1 m wide. At the bottom, there starts a straight gallery (1) about 10 m long, that slopes down for about 2.5 m. A second access well, which may have been created accidentally, is located about 2 m from the first one. The gallery ends in a room (r2) about 3 m wide and 3 m tall, from which three other galleries branch off. Two of them (3a and 3b), about 7–8 m long, go off on opposite directions, at about right angles of gallery 1. A shorter gallery (2), about 2 m long, branches off at a level about 1–2 m higher, and ends right above a part of gallery 3a. Most of the passages have roundish cross-section and are about 1 to 1.5 m wide. Gallery 3a broadens at the end into a room (r1) about 2 m wide. At a few places along those main galleries there are short side branches and a couple of shallow pits. The tunnels still preserve signs of the mining activity, such as a walking floor of compacted gravel, presumably from the mine itself; pickaxe marks on the walls; and niches that presumably held lamps. There are no significant archaeological remains from this period. After exhaustion and a long period of abandonment, the mine was reused as a burial site. Two individuals were buried in at the end of gallery 3a, in distinct epochs, with many grave offerings. The entrance of gallery 3a, and gallery 1 right after the second access well, were closed off with limestone slabs 50–100 cm wide, blocks of stone 20–30 cm wide, and soil. The closures appear to have been intended to be temporary, presumably to allow additional burials at a later time. Access well 1 was blocked in a similar way, but more substantially. Radiocarbon dating of materials in the mine is ambiguous and gives two likely dates, 3900 and 3750 BC (with uncertainty of a few decades). Either way, the exploitation of the mine and both burials seem to have occurred within the space of a few decades. The skeletal remains were highly fragmented, with natural and human-inflicted fractures. They had been deposited on the floor of the mine, without interment, and have been affected by animals (worms and rodents) and water that leaked into the mine. The bone fragments of individual 1, a mature adult man, where scattered over a couple of meters; they seem to have been pushed out of room r1 to clear the place for burial of individual 2, a taller but more gracile mature woman. The few teeth that were preserved had their crowns completely worn off, indicating an abrasive diet or their use as tools. The bones of the face of both individuals were missing, and there is evidence that the face of individual 1 was cut away from the skull at the time of death. His skull also shows apparent marks of two fully healed blows. The bones of individual 2 show signs of heavy labor, especially of the right arm, and of carrying heavy loads on the head.Alícia Casas and Tona Major (2009): \\"Estudi arqueoantropològic de les restes humanes neolítiques de les mines 84 i 90 de Gavà (Baix Llobregat)\\" (in Catalan)\\". Rubricatum, issue 4, pages 209-223. The offerings found with the two burials included two ceramic urns, a rectangular ceramics bowl, bone tools, an ox bone, a Glycymeris shell, flint blades, and some boar tusks. Some ceramics fragments were also fould mixed in the soil used to seal off the burial.

He was transferred to the cavalry as a cornet on 5 December 1785. He was made lieutenant in 1787. He served with James Stephenson's regiment of cavalry and in Third Anglo-Mysore War was present at the Battle of Sittimungulum, Siege of Bangalore and Siege of Seringapatam (1792). He was thanked by authorities in India and Parliament. In the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War he was present at the Battle of Mallavelly and the Siege of Seringapatam (1799). He served under Colonel Arthur Wellesley in the pursuit of Dhondia Wagh and was present at the battle and his death. He was later thanked in general orders by Wellesley for his role in the campaign. He also served in the Poligar campaign under Patrick Agnew, and was present at the capture of Pandalamworehy, for which he was again thanked by authorities in India and parliament in Britain. He was promoted to captain on 8 May 1800 and to major on 2 September 1801. On 15 October 1804 he was made lieutenant- colonel and given command of the cavalry brigade. In 1807 he commanded a force stationed in Berar and made resident to the Raja Govina Bucksh. Thereafter he was appointed to the command at Arcot. In 1808 he served under Colonels Wallace and Halliburton in a campaign against the Pindaris. He led a forced march for 120 miles from Jaulna, defeating the Pathan chiefs, dispersing their entire army and capturing 17 guns. Madras Revolt In 1808, Sir George Barlow, the Governor-General of the Madras Presidency abolished the tent contract system to reduce expenditure.Jeremy Bentham, The Correspondence of Jeremy Bentham: Volume 12: July 1824 to June 1828, Clarendon Press, 1968 The peacetime allowance for regimental tentage provided a supplemental income for commanding officers in the Madras Army and its abolishment drew heavy criticism from officers who were to be denied of this income and who felt they were now being accused of embezzlement. In July 1809 Barlow demanded officers sign a declaration of loyalty yet only around 150 officers did so out of approximately 3,000. In turn a number of detachments at locations including Hyderabad, Seringapatnam, Jaulna, Masulipatam and Ellore passed into open revolt. Doveton, then Commandant of a field force at Jaulna, revolted and along with the Commandants at Seringapatnam and Masulipatam, Lieutenant- Colonel John Bell and Major Joseph Storey, he was tried at a Court Martial which began in November 1809. Following deliberation Doveton was initially acquitted but later suspended on pay and allowances, whilst Bell and Storey were dismissed from the army. Redemption On 14 June 1813 he was promoted colonel and the following year commanded a contingent at Hyderabad with the rank of brigadier-General. The contingent, paid for by the Nizam of Hyderabad, consisted of around ten thousand men led by British officers, and was intended to provide a greater garrison in the Nizam's vast territory. During the Pindari War, Doveton achieved distinction for his rapid relief against of Nagpur. For his actions, he was made a Companion of the Bath in 1818, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in November 1819. In August 1819 he was promoted to major-general and the following year resigned from the army. Later life and death On retirement, Doveton remained in Madras. He was promoted to lieutenant-general and made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Bath in 1837. He died at his house in Nungambakkam on 7 November 1847 aged 77 years. His funeral was attended by large numbers and he was buried at St. Mary's Church.

She is best known for her paintings which typically blend historic and contemporary styles. Bush has won several awards for her works and has held international exhibitions. Work and career Bush's gouache on paper paintings are known for their level of meticulous detail, use of flattened perspective, decorative patterning, and chalky colours. Her unique style of painting blends influences from the history of figurative art, drawing on medieval illuminated manuscripts like the book of hours, through to Giotto's frescoes, Japanese Shunga art, Mughal painting, Persian miniatures, Dutch religious paintings, Korean still life and folk art. The English painter Stanley Spencer is also a key influence for the artist, as are facets of global popular culture and fashion. As curator Lauren Gutsell explains: \\"These disparate sources bind Bush's works to both the past and the present; the historical and the contemporary. Human interactions, humour, ambiguity, dramatic tension and intimate scale are her tools to draw viewers into a private conversation and, in some cases, a spiritual space.\\" Bush's early works often focussed on injured characters, giving the works something of the air of Mexican retablo art, though this feature has been largely absent from her more recent work. Bush received an Arts Foundation New Generation Award in 2013, and undertook the Frances Hodgkins Fellowship at the University of Otago in 2011. In 2009, the artist won the Art and Australia Contemporary Art Award, and undertook an Arts Centre/Asia NZ Foundation Residency at the National Art studio, Changdong, Seoul. Bush's work is held in institutions across New Zealand as well as the Queensland Art Gallery, Art Gallery of New South Wales, National Gallery Victoria. She is represented by Darren Knight Gallery in Sydney and Brett McDowell Gallery in Dunedin. Life Bush was born in Dunedin to English parents. Her father had studied art at Winchester School of Art, but did not complete a degree course. His interests in Asian history led to his daughter being named for the Kushan Empire, and the young Kushana's childhood was lived surrounded by books on Asian history and art. Bush went to Wakari Primary School and Balmacewen Intermediate School before studying at Otago Girls' High School. Bush completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts majoring in painting at the Dunedin School of Art in 2004.

She is known for serving as Biology Editor at Nature from 1983 to 1992, during which time Nature's visibility and influence in the life sciences substantially increased, and for her contributions to the influential textbook Molecular Biology of the Cell. As editor of BMC's open-access Journal of Biology, she introduced pioneering improvements in the process of peer review, including the ability for authors to opt out of re-review.  Early life and family  Robertson was the daughter of S. Anthony (Tony) Barnett, a zoologist specializing in rat behavior who was also a prolific author and broadcaster. He was born in Hertfordshire and moved to Canberra in 1971 to take up a position at the Australian National University, where he served as Professor of Zoology until his retirement. Her mother was Marjorie Phillips, who worked with pioneering educator John Newsom when he was County Education Officer for Hertfordshire during the Second World War. Her uncle, James Barnett, was a yeast biologist.  Career  Robertson joined Nature in 1970 during John Maddox's first term as Editor. As a member of the Biology Team and subsequently Biology Editor, she frequently wrote articles for Nature's News and Views series highlighting important recent developments in a variety of areas, including immunology, development, the molecular mechanisms of disease, and early efforts in artificial intelligence, in vitro fertilisation and gene therapy. In 1973, when Maddox was replaced by David Davies, Nature instituted systematic peer review of submitted manuscripts. Under Davies, and subsequently in Maddox's second term, the selectivity of publication decisions dramatically increased. As the difficulty and importance of these decisions increased, Robertson developed strong relationships with many key figures in the biological community to improve decision-making. Noted theoretical biologist Robert May described Robertson as \\"exceptionally good and well informed\\" in explaining his willingness to write an unusually large number of News and Views pieces for Nature. She knew Francis Crick both professionally and through family connections, and wrote a \\"brief and superficial impression\\" of his life and work after his death in 2004. In 1976, while still at Nature, Robertson began to work with a team of scientists led by Bruce Alberts and James Watson on a new textbook, Molecular Biology of the Cell, which was published by Garland Science in 1983. As the developmental editor, she organized an unprecedentedly large and diverse network of university undergraduate students and teachers to provide feedback on drafts of chapters. In the preface of the first edition, the authors wrote: \\"Most of the advice obtained from students and outside experts was collected and digested by Miranda Robertson. By insisting that every page be lucid and coherent, and rewriting many of those that were not, she has played a major part in the creation of a textbook that undergraduates will read with ease.\\" The book was praised by reviewers for its \\"unobtrusively lucid style, which is the mark of much tender loving care\\" and was later called “the most influential cell biology textbook of its time”. In 1992 Robertson left Nature and joined Garland Science. Because of her standing in the biology community and the example set by Molecular Biology of the Cell, she was able to partner with several noted biologists to create new textbooks. She played an important part in the development of Immunobiology by Charles Janeway and Paul Travers, and edited two editions of Introduction to Protein Structure by Carl Branden and John Tooze. In 1996 Garland Science was acquired by Taylor & Francis. In 1998 Robertson joined New Science Press as Managing Director, where she initiated a series of Primers in Biology with a modular design intended to make teaching easier. The series included \\"Protein Structure and Function\\" by Gregory Petsko and Dagmar Ringe and \\"The Cell Cycle: Principles of Control\\" by David Morgan. She also co-authored Immunity: The Immune Response to Infectious and Inflammatory Disease with Anthony DeFranco and Richard Locksley. In 2008, Robertson moved to New Science Press's sister company, BioMedCentral, the first fully open-access publisher. As Editor of Journal of Biology, which later merged with BMC Biology, Robertson introduced a number of editorial innovations, including a policy allowing authors to opt out of re-review after responding to reviewers' comments, arguing that \\"pit-bull reviewing\\" did not serve the community well. This policy was catalyzed by a situation of a highly delayed second review, reported to Robertson by Peter Walter. Announcing the new policy in 2009, Robertson commented that it is \\"the job of journal editors to promote the dissemination of research results rather than to obstruct it, [and] it is the author who is in the end accountable for the quality and validity of the paper that is published.\\" Robertson also introduced a checklist for documenting that submitted papers meet reporting standards for reproducibility and the ability for researchers to pre-register their planned course of research. Robertson's editorials often focused on open questions and unacknowledged \\"dirty secrets\\", using Sydney Brenner's term \\"Ockham's Broom\\" to refer to the practice of sweeping inconvenient facts under the rug. In 2017, Robertson announced her retirement from BMC Biology and was replaced as Editor by Mirna Kvajo.

The instrument is mounted on the Japanese Experiment Module-Exposed Facility on board the International Space Station (ISS). OCO-3 was scheduled to be transported to space by a SpaceX Dragon from a Falcon 9 rocket on 30 April 2019, but the launch was delayed to 3 May, due to problems with the space station's electrical power system. This launch was further delayed to 4 May due to electrical issues aboard Of Course I Still Love You (OCISLY), the barge used to recover the Falcon 9’s first stage. OCO-3 was launched as part of CRS-17 on 4 May 2019 at 06:48 UTC. The nominal mission lifetime is 3 years. OCO-3 was assembled using spare materials from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite. Because the OCO-3 instrument is similar to the OCO-2 instrument, it is expected to have similar performance with its measurements used to quantify to 1 ppm precision or better at 3 Hz. History and timeline 24 February 2009 - Orbiting Carbon Observatory was launched on a Taurus XL rocket but failed to achieve orbit when the fairing failed to separate from the satellite. * 1 February 2010 - The 2010 President's budget included funding for development and re-flight of an OCO replacement. * October 2010 - The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 project went into implementation phase. * 2 July 2014 - OCO-2 was successfully launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base with a Delta II rocket. * 2015 - Funding for the OCO-3 project cancelled. * 22 December 2015 - OCO-3 project authorized to proceed. Funding was included in the 2016 spending bill. * 16 March 2017 - OCO-3 was not included in the proposed FY2018 presidential budget. * 23 March 2018 - Funding for the OCO-3 project was restored. * May 2018 - Instrument underwent TVAC testing. * 4 May 2019 - Launched using a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The delivery was part of SpaceX CRS-17, which also included delivery of STP-H6 and a cargo resupply. * After arrival - Robotic installation onto Exposed Facility Unit 3 (EFU 3) on the JEM-EF. Instrument design OCO-3 is constructed from spare equipment from the OCO-2 mission. Thus its physical characteristics are similar, but with some adaptations. A 2-axis pointing mirror was added, which will allow targeting of cities and other areas on order of for area mapping (also called \\"snapshot mode\\"). A resolution context camera was also added. An onboard cryocooler will maintain detector temperatures of around . Entrance optics were modified to maintain a similar ground footprint to OCO-2.

Grating spectrometers separate incoming light energy into different components of the electromagnetic spectrum (or wavelengths or \\"colors\\"). Because and molecular oxygen absorb light at specific wavelengths, the signal or absorption levels at different wavelengths provide information on the amount of gases. Three bands are used called Weak (around 1.6 μm), Strong (around 2.0 μm), and Oxygen-A (around 0.76 μm). There are 1,016 spectral elements per band, and measurements are made simultaneously at 8 side-by-side locations or \\"footprints\\" each about or smaller, 3 times per second. Expected data use Overall measurements from OCO-3 will help quantify sources and sinks of carbon dioxide from terrestrial ecosystems, the oceans, and from anthropogenic sources. Due to the ISS orbit, measurements will be made at latitudes less than 52°. Data from OCO-3 are expected to significantly improve understanding of global emissions from human activities, for example, using measurements over cities. Near simultaneous observations from other instruments onboard the International Space Station such as ECOSTRESS (measuring plant temperatures) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar (measuring forest structure) may be combined with OCO-3 observations to help improve the understanding of the terrestrial ecosystem. Similar to OCO-2, OCO-3 will also measure Solar Induced Fluorescence which is a process that occurs during plant photosynthesis.

Biography Lokanatha was born near Naples in Cervinara, Italy in 1897 in the celebrated family of Cioffi and given the name of Salvatore, meaning the Savior. Brought up in an atmosphere of culture, he was a talented violinist. He studied chemistry and received his B.Sc. at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, in 1922. He then worked as a chemical analyst for the Crucible Steel Co. and Procter & Gamble before briefly attending Columbia University Medical School. It was the scientific impulse in him which led him to Buddhism, which he embraced not long after graduation. Shortly he was on pilgrimage to the places sacred to Buddhism and was ordained a Buddhist monk in Burma in 1925. Thereafter, he resolved to propagate the teachings of the Buddha all over the world. Returning home after mastering the precepts and practices of Buddhism in six months, he found the general atmosphere not favorable to his new religion in Italy. He returned to India on foot walking across Southern Europe and Asia Minor, reaching back Burma in 1928. The five years that followed were spent in deep study and meditations, his time being divided between monasteries and the Himalayan caves and forests. Strictly observing the 13 dhutangas, he emerged towards the end of 1932 with a spiritual radiance around him. From the year 1928 throughout his life he observed the self-imposed rule of sleeping in the sitting posture: only in his death he lay on his back. Three Buddhist missionary expeditions were launched by Lokanatha in the years 1933, 1934 and 1935 from Burma, Thailand and Ceylon respectively to Bodh Gaya in India, where the Buddha had attained Enlightenment. Lokanatha wrote extensively and published several booklets with a view to use these in his missionary expeditions in the West; he also completed a large volume dealing with his missionary work in the East. While the plans for a missionary tour of Europe and America were getting finalized, World War II broke out. All of Lokanatha's writings were lost. Besides, during the War he was interned in India. In October, 1946, he returning to Burma and found the Buddhist Foreign Mission organized in Mandalay; under the auspices of which he was sent out in July 1947 for a Buddhist survey of the contemporary world, with special reference to the USA. It was the first mission of its kind ever launched from Burma. The outcome of this Mission is detailed in his work Girdling the Globe with Truth. Preaching through Singapore and Malaya, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Manila, he sped across the Pacific through Hawaii to the US, and after a very successful tour of the United States and preaching in England and on the Continent, he arrived in Ceylon in 1950 to attend and address the First Conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists. In March 1951 he was back to Burma, where right-royal receptions awaited for him in Rangoon and Mandalay. In Mandalay he hoisted the World Buddhist Flag on March 24, 1951 for the first time in Burma. After 1951 he preached extensively and repeatedly throughout Burma, also dividing his time between Burma, India and Ceylon; mostly staying in Burma. He attended and addressed the World Fellowship of Buddhists' Conference in Rangoon in 1954. Also, he was elected the Spiritual Patron of the Mahajayanti Celebrations in 1956 in Pakistan. It was in the early 1930s that Lokanatha and B. R. Ambedkar, the Indian Dalit leader, contacted each other. The correspondence between them reveals that Ambedkar was greatly influenced by Lokanatha, in favor of Buddhism. Ambedkar converted to Buddhism with many of his followers in 1956. Donations for the world Dhammaduta work flowed freely to Lokanatha in Burma. He had planned for a World Preaching Tour in 1963-1965, which somehow failed to materialize. Towards the end of 1965, he developed a sore on his forehead, which turned cancerous. While preparing for his visit to the US for proper treatment, he succumbed to the temptation of trying indigenous treatment, against all expert advice. He died on May 25, 1966. On May 29, 1966 in Maymyo, his body was taken in a stately procession to the Shwezigon Monastery, where it lies in state for all Burma to pay homage. Lokanatha was a staunch vegetarian. His donations helped construct the Sunlun Dhammayone in Rangoon. His devotees included people from all ranks of life; intellectuals, scientists and people in authority from several countries were influenced by him.

Synthetic microbial consortia (commonly called co- cultures) are multi-population systems that can contain a diverse range of microbial species, and are adjustable to serve a variety of industrial, ecological, and tautological interests. For synthetic biology, consortia take the ability to engineer novel cell behaviors to a population level. Consortia are more common than not in nature, and generally prove to be more robust than monocultures. Just over 7,000 species of bacteria have been cultured and identified to date. Many of the estimated 1.2 million bacteria species that remain have yet to be cultured and identified, in part due to inabilities to be cultured axenically. Evidence for symbiosis between microbes strongly suggests it to have been a necessary precursor of the evolution of land plants and for their transition from algal communities in the sea to land. When designing synthetic consortia, or editing naturally occurring consortia, synthetic biologists keep track of pH, temperature, initial metabolic profiles, incubation times, growth rate, and other pertinent variables. Biofuel One of the more salient applications of engineering behaviors and interactions between microbes in a community is the ability to combine or even switch metabolisms. The combination of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes allows the unique possibility of a self-sufficient community that may produce desired biofuels to be collected. Co-culture dyads of autotrophic Synechococcus elongatus and heterotrophic Escherichia coli were found to be able to grow synchronously when the strain of S. elongatus was transformed to include a gene for sucrose export. The commensal combination of the sucrose- producing cyanobacteria with the modified E. coli metabolism may allow for a diverse array of metabolic products such as various butanol biofuels, terpenoids, and fatty-acid derived fuels. Including a heterotroph also provides a solution to the issues of contamination when producing carbohydrates, as competition may limit contaminant species viability. In isolated systems this can be a restriction to the feasibility of large-scale biofuel operations, like algae ponds, where contamination can significantly reduce the desired output. Through interactions between Geobacter spp. and Methanogens from the soil in a rice paddy field, it was discovered that the use of interspecies electron transfer stimulated the production of methane. Considering the abundance of conductive metals in soils and the use of Methane (natural gas) as a fuel, this may lead to a bioenergy-producing process. Bioremediation Use of the extensive range of microbial metabolism offers opportunities to those interested in Bioremediation. Through consortia, synthetic biologists have been able to design an enhanced efficiency in bacteria that can excrete bio-surfactants as well as degrade hydrocarbons for the interests of cleaning oil contamination in Assam, India. Their experiment took combinations of five native naturally occurring hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, and analyzed the different cocktails to see which degraded poly- aromatic hydrocarbons the best. The combination of Bacillus pumilis KS2 and Bacillus cereus R2 was found to be the most effective, degrading 84.15% of the TPH after 5 weeks. Further remediation efforts have turned to the issue of agricultural Pesticide run-off. Pesticides vary in class and function, and in high concentration often lead to highly toxic environmental risks. Of the over-500 types of pesticides in current use, two serious issues are their general lack of biodegradability and unpredictability. In Kyrgyzstan, researchers assessed soil around a pesticide dump and discovered not only that the soil had poor microflora diversity, but that some of the species that were present used metabolic pathways to digest the pesticides. The two most- efficient species found were Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus polymyxa, with B. polymyxa degrading 48.2% of the pesticide Aldrin after 12 days. However, when the strains were combined with each other as well as some other less-efficient yet native bacteria, pesticide degradation increased to 54.0% in the same conditions. Doolatkeldieva et al. discussed their findings, saying > \\"It is consequently possible that the degrading capacity of the bacteria > could be increased only through co-cultivation, which shows that these > bacteria naturally coexist and are dependent on each other for the > utilization of environmental substances. In the oxidation and hydrolysis > pathways of pesticide degradation, each bacterium can produce metabolites > that will be utilized by the enzyme system of the next bacterium\\". Bioplastic As an answer to the increase in use of non-biodegradable, oil- based plastics and its subsequent accumulation as waste, scientists have developed biodegradable and compostable alternatives often called Bioplastics. However, not all biologically created plastics are necessarily biodegradable, and this can be a source of confusion. Therefore it is important to distinguish between the types of bioplastics, biodegradable bioplastics which can be degraded by some microflora and simply bio-based plastics which are a renewable source of plastic but require more effort to dispose of. One of the bioplastics of interest is Polyhydroxybutyrate, abbreviated to PHB. PHB is a biodegradable bioplastic that has applications for food packaging due to being non-toxic. Repurposed E. coli, as well as Halomonas boliviensis, have been shown to produce PHB. PHB production starting from carbon dioxide in a co- culture between S. elongatus and H. boliviensis has proven to be a stable continually-productive pair for 5 months without the aid of antibiotics.

Biography R. Fortescue Fox qualified MRCS in 1882 at the London Hospital in 1882 and was house physician to Sir Andrew Clark. However, Fox developed tuberculosis, and went on a voyage to China as a ship's surgeon. Upon his return he went to Strathpeffer Spa in Ross-shire, where he recovered his health, practised medicine, and gained knowledge of balneology. In 1905 he returned to London and in 1913 published Principles and Practice of Medical Hydrology, adding to his reputation as an authority on British and foreign spas. He was a strong advocate of treatment and training of the disabled war veterans, and became the first medical director of the Enham Village Centre, which opened in 1919. He continued as director for a year. Fox was instrumental in the creation of the British Red Cross Clinic for Rheumatism. He was one of the founders of the British Health Resorts Association. He was mainly responsible for the creation of the International Society of Medical Hydrology in 1921 and edited the Archives of Medical Hydrology for several years from 1922. He was elected FRCP in 1925. R. Fortescue Fox's father was the seventh son of Quaker surgeon Joseph John Fox, who came from an unbroken line of Quaker doctors for five generations. All of the seven sons became doctors. The third son was Richard Hingston Fox, FRCP. Robert Fortescue Fox married Katherine Stewart MacDougall (1860–1937) and was the father of three daughters and three sons. The three daughters were Constance Mary (1886–1965), Hilda Angell (1887–1966), and Charlotte Iris (1890–1926). The three sons were William Fortescue (1892–1897), Andrew Stewart (1893–1915), and Theodore Fortescue (1899–1989). Andrew Stewart Fox was killed in action in WWI.

Structures on the property include a Craftsman bungalow residence, a hay barn, milk house, milking parlor, woodshed, and other outbuildings. The residence, built in 1915, is a -story wood-frame bungalow with a side gable. The hay barn, added in 1922, is notable as the earliest extant example in the Snoqualmie Valley of the use of the bow truss or Gothic arch for the roof. One of the first milking parlors in the county was installed at Broadacre Farm in about 1950. The milking parlor and milk house are part of a complex of four adjoining buildings. The complex, with additions made through the 1990s, is integrated with the hay barn. The Adairs sold the Broadacre Farm to Peter Sinnema in 1945. Sinnema expanded the existing farm complex by constructing loafing sheds on either side of the bam, adding a new tank house, and building a new Surge six-in-a-line milking parlor, one of first to be installed in the valley. Later additions include large detached loafing sheds, a new herringbone milking parlor designed for 16 cows, and a modem milk house with a 22,000 gallon tank. For many years, Broadacre Farm was the site for the annual Snoqualmie Valley Pioneer Picnic, which the Adair family first hosted in 1923. Broadacre Farm was a working dairy farm until the mid-1990s.

Apprentices have worked on important Wright projects including the Johnson Wax Headquarters, Fallingwater, Guggenheim Museum, and Monona Terrace. The apprenticeship program evolved into the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture, which was established in response to changing licensing requirements for architects, particularly the requirement to graduate from an accredited institution prior to sitting for the Architect Registration Examination. In 2017, the school changed its name to The School of Architecture at Taliesin. Academics The school offers a three-year, project-based Master of Architecture degree, with a focus on organic architecture. The school is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board and the Higher Learning Commission.  2020 financial challenges  On January 28, 2020, the school announced that it would cease operations on both campuses and close by June 2020. According to this announcement, the school's governing board determined that \\"the School did not have a sustainable business model that would allow it to maintain its operation as an accredited program.\\" This announcement followed the failure of discussions between the board and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation about the creation of new, non-accredited educational programs. At the time of the announcement, the school indicated they were negotiating an agreement for the 30 currently enrolled students to transfer to The Design School at ASU's Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts. The planned closure followed a 2014 challenge to the school's accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission on the grounds that the accredited institution was not incorporated separately from its funding organization, the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. The school maintained its accreditation through the 2020 closure announcement by establishing itself as an independent entity. Subsequently, students, alumni and staff clashed over proposed partnerships with other institutions and the school suffered financial difficulties. It was reported that prior to the closure announcement, the school and the foundation were in talks to develop alternative educational programming that did not require accreditation. According to the foundation, the proposals that emerged from these discussions were not approved by the school's board. Six weeks after announcing the pending closure, the school's board of director's reversed course and announced that the school had received new funding and was financially viable.

Middle Ages =Early Medieval Period= After the period of Roman rule, the Visigoth monarch Theodoric I (ruled 418–451) persecuted pimps, violence was often used against them, the maximum penalty being death. His grandson Alaric II promulgated the Breviary of Alaric in 506, one of its provisions was the prohibition of prostitution. A public flogging was the proscribed penalty. Under this code both pimps and prostitutes were included. Clovis I introduced the code to Frankish Gaul. Charlemagne (768-814 AD) further attempted to suppress prostitution, declaring flogging (300 lashes) as a punishment in his capitularies. This was primarily aimed at the common man, since harems and concubines were common amongst the ruling classes. Some idea of the seriousness with which the state regarded the offense is provided by the fact that 300 lashes was the severest sentence prescribed by the Code Alaric (Breviary of Alaric). Offenders also had their hair cut off, and in the case of recidivism, could be sold as slaves. There is no evidence that any of this was effective. =General tolerance= In the Middle Ages, the authorities, whether the municipalities, lords or kings, organised or supervised prostitution within institutions. Buildings run by the bourgeois or the church, (particularly abbesses in the 14th and 15th centuries) paid a lease to the authorities. These public brothels were indicated by a red lantern lit by the keeper of the house during opening hours. In general, prostitutes were not marginalised but integrated into a society where they have a role to play. In the fabliaux of the Middle Ages, the prostitutes were accomplices of other women and helped them to avenge the so-called seducers. The cathedral of Chartres has a stained glass (Stained glass of the Parable of the Prodigal Son) which was given by prostitutes, in the same way that other windows were given by other trade guilds. The regulations of this time were often municipal, and limited to supervising the activity: * Freedom of activity in certain streets or neighbourhoods; * Restrictions on the freedoms of prostitutes (travel, associates); * Compulsory clothing to distinguish prostitutes from other women (girdles); * Days and hours of opening the houses (10 am to 6 pm or 8 pm in Paris; Monday to Saturday,This type of regulation was not respected and night and Sunday working was gradually tolerated. closing during Sunday Mass and Holy Week). * Alongside this legal public prostitution, are private institutions (hotels, taverns and :fr:bordelages) and prostitutes who worked on the street or went from hotel to hotel. Under Philippe-Auguste an irregular militia, the Ribauds, was instituted around 1189, to whom the policing of the public girls was entrusted in Paris. Its leader, the \\"King of Ribald\\" ruled over the prostitution in Paris. The Ribauds were abolished by Philip IV (1285-1314) due to their licentiousness. =Occasional repression= This general tolerance has exceptions, Louis IX, after returning from the Seventh Crusade, sought to make the kingdom conform with religious views of morality and initially tried to prohibit prostitution. By a Royal Decree of December 1254, he pronounced the expulsion of all \\"women of evil life\\" from the kingdom and confiscation of their belongings. It also outlined punishment for prostitutes and pimps. The prostitutes went into hiding and the king was pressured to restore the previous situation. Faced with the impossibility of applying this decree, a second ordinance of 1256 was introduced. Although still railing against women who were \\"free with their bodies and other common harlots\\", he acknowledged the pragmatic desirability of housing them away from respectable streets and religious establishments, and so obliged them to reside outside of the borders of the city walls. These measures did nothing to reduce prostitution and the number of prostitutes continued to rise. In 1269, Louis IX, who was preparing to embark on the Eighth Crusade, again sought to root out evil from the realm. Once again, the clandestine activities of the prostitutes and the disorder created made the king revoke the order. His resolve to do away with prostitution was affirmed in a letter of 1269 to the regents in which he refers to the need to extirpate the evil, root and branch. The punishment for infraction was an 8 sous fine and risking imprisonment in the Châtelet (see below). He designated nine streets in which prostitution would be allowed in Paris, three of them being in the sarcastically named Beaubourg quartier (Beautiful Neighbourhood) (Rue de la Huchette, Rue Froimon, Rue du Renard-Saint-Merri, Rue Taille pain, Rue Brisemiches, Rue Champ-Fleury, Rue Trace-putain, Rue Gratte-cul, and the Rue Tire-Putain) (see below) Today, this area corresponds to the 1st-4th arrondissements clustered on the Rive Droite (right bank) of the Seine (see map). These streets, associated with prostitution, had very evocative if indelicate names including the Rue du Poil-au-con (or hair of the con, from the Latin cunnus meaning female genitalia, hence Street of the Pubic Hair, or Poil du pubis), later altered to the Rue du Pélican, in the 1st arrondissement, near the first Porte Saint-Honoré,Le saviez-vous ? Rue du Poil-au-Con... urban trip paris Feb 2 2010 and the Rue Tire-Vit (Pull-Cock, i.e. penis, later the Rue Tire-Boudin, Pull-Sausage) now Rue Marie-Stuart, in the 2nd arrondissement, near the first Porte Saint-Denis. It is said that Tire-Boudin was a euphemism invented for Mary Queen of Scots when she asked after its name, and the street is now named after her.Realms of Memory: The construction of the French past. II: Traditions; p. 363 Pierre Nora, Lawrence D. Kritzman. Columbia University Press, 1997 The nearby Rue Gratte-Cul (Scratch-bottom) is now the Rue Dussoubs, and the Rue Pute-y-Musse (Whore [who] hides there) the Rue du Petit-Musc by corruption. The \\"rue Trousse- Nonnain\\" (fuck nun), later became Trace-Putain, Tasse-Nonnain, and Transnonain; then in 1851 it was amalgamated into the Rue Beaubourg.In the 3rd arondissement from Porte Hydron to the Saint-Martin-des-Champs Priory. Rue Transnonnain. Le Garde-mots Nov 23 2009 The Rue Baille-Hoë (Give Joy) is now Rue Taillepain in the 4th arondissement near the Porte Saint-Merri. In 1358, the Grand Conseil of John II (1350-1364) echoing the \\"necessary evil\\" doctrine of Saints Augustine (354-430 AD) and Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) declared that \\"les pécheresses sont absolument nécessaires à la Terre\\" (Sinners are an absolute necessity for the country). Prostitution remained confined to designated areas, as indicated in this decree in the reign of Charles V (1364-1380), by Hugh Aubriot, Provost of Paris in 1367, outlining the areas outside of which prostitutes would be punished 'according to the ordinance of Saint Louis'; Contemporary accounts suggest that this decree was rarely enforced.Histoire de maisons.... closes mais d'un point de vue architectural !; batiweb. Retrieved August 3, 2007. Under Charles VI, in an effort to prevent wives and daughters being mistaken as prostitutes, brothels were permitted in designated, segregated areas. Prostitutes were given royal protection from rape, allowing them to refuse clients if they wanted. In 1446 new rules reinforced the measures being taken by prohibiting the wearing of certain outfits considered to be highly provocative; feather, fur and the infamous gold belts. Early modern era Prostitutes arrested and shorn following the police order of 1778, print by Jean-Baptiste Huet. Prostitutes in Paris during the revolutionary period, c. 1793–95. Engraving by Jacques- Louis Copia (1764-1799), after Jean-Baptiste Mallet (1759-1835). Bibliothèque nationale de France The tolerance period continued in the 15th century, but the 16th century saw a return to repression. Among the factors that may explain this change is the emergence of syphilis in the late 15th century (possibly in Naples in 1494, though recent studies challenge this) and the reformation in Catholic cities returning to more rigid morality. In 1560, the Edict of Blois made prostitution an illicit activity and a new moral order swept over France. Imprisonment or banishment was applied to those who did not respect the new prohibitions. Despite these measures the number of prostitutes did not decrease. Thus in 1658, Louis XIV ordered all women guilty of prostitution, fornication or adultery be imprisoned in the Pitié-Salpêtrière until the priests or religious officials say they have repented and changed. It is also Louis XIV who created, in 1667, the function of lieutenant-general of police, who will be in control of the surveillance of the public girls. In 1687, orders were issued that prostitutes should not be within two leagues of Versailles or in the company of soldiers. Punishment was severe and consisted of cutting off of nose and ears. The women should have their morals be corrected by work and piety. The police had full power to repress indiscriminately debauchery, prostitution and adultery, but in 1708 and 1713 (Ordinance of July 26, 1713 on \\"women debauchery\\" which enshrines the offence of prostitution), the conditions of repression are somewhat formalised (Louis XIV was in the end influenced by devout influences and ended his life of libertinage). Whistle-blowers have sign their denunciation, and a distinction is made between public debauchery (punished by fine or injunction to leave the premises) and acts of prostitution (banishment or imprisonment). This distinction however, has little effect. The death of Louis XIV stopped the repression. Louis XV, restored licensing and the morality police were limited to supervising the brothels and transforming the tenants into police auxiliaries. The advent of Louis XVI signalled the return of repression. On November 6, 1778, an order of police lieutenant Lenoir prohibited solicitation in all its forms.Let express very inhibitions to all women and girls debauchery hanging in the streets, on the docks, squares and public walks on the boulevards of this city of Paris, even the windows. All under penalty of being shaved and locked in the hospital. Every month, three or four hundred women were arrested in Paris. Those who could buy their freedom were freed, others are put in hospital or in prison. After the French Revolution, the revolutionaries removed prostitution from the domain of the law, refusing to make it a matter of legislation. In a break with the proliferation of the previous royal ordinances and their prohibitionist approach, the revolutionaries established, by absence in the main codes of law in 1791, the tolerance of this activity. Only the surveillance of places of prostitution is prescribed by the Code of Police and procuring minors is punishable by the Penal Code in the name of the violation of morality, a legal category created by revolutionaries. The practice of prostitution itself is not outlawed. On October 4, 1793, the Commune of Paris issued a regulatory order forbidding prostitutes to stand in public spaces to \\"incite to debauchery\\". Although it led to the arrest and sanitary control of more than 400 prostitutes in 1794, this decree did not prevent the continued development of prostitution, particularly at the Palais-Royal, which became the first sex market in the capital. There were many \\"daughters\\" that crisscrossed the garden paths and galleries of the Palace, and erotic shows and shops dedicated to prostitution. At the turn of the century, the authorities estimated that there were 30,000 prostitutes in Paris alone, plus an additional 10,000 high-class prostitutes. To measure the extent of the phenomenon, most contemporary historians point out that if the proportion of prostitutes was the same today (about 13% of women), Paris would have a population of more than 100,000 prostitutes. Contemporary era =Official tolerance= Prostitution at the Palais Royal in 1815 (Opiz). Map of France: the origin of prostitutes in Paris, published by Alexandre Parent du Chatelet in 1836 in a book entitled De la Prostitution dans la ville de Paris, considérée sous le rapport de l’hygiène publique, de la morale et de l’administration (1836) Map of prostitutes in Paris, published by Alexandre Parent du Châtelet in his book De la Prostitution dans la ville de Paris, considérée sous le rapport de l’hygiène publique, de la morale et de l’administration (1836) Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Salon de la rue des Moulins, 1894 Decriminalized during the French Revolution, prostitution was not accepted by French society. In Paris, in the name of the preservation of public order, the police continue to arrest women who prostitute themselves on public roads. By a decree of October 4, 1793, the Commune makes the \\"raccrochage\\" in public space a crime against morality and establishes the principle of health control of prostitutes. In 1796, an attempt by the Directorate to fight prostitution by making it an offence fails in the face of the difficulty of defining prostitution. MP Joseph Vincent Dumolard, a moderate deputy, explains that \\"It is not to the legislators of a great people that we must present regulations of monks.The abuses denounced (...) are all too true, the disorders are all too real, but perhaps they are inseparable from the existence of a commune such as the one we inhabit.\\" After this failure, the Central Office of the Canton of Paris, ancestor of the Prefecture of Police, inaugurates the principles of registration and census of prostitutes in the capital. The Consulate (1799-1804) continued the tolerance and paves the way for maisons de tolérance. A Decree of 3 March 1802 legislates mandatory health inspection prostitutes in an attempt to stem the spread of syphilis, which was endemic at the time. On Napoleon's order of October 12, 1804, the prefect of police in Paris, Louis Dubois, prescribed the official organisation of the houses of pleasures. The year 1804 saw the legalisation of tolerance and brothels. Women and houses are controlled by the Brigade des mœurs. The women had to register at the prefecture in order to work in a brothel. Each woman had to have a twice-weekly medical check-up, which is perceived as the most degrading part of their job and abhorred by the prostitutes. In April 1831, 3,131 girls registered at the Paris Prefecture. The women received a registration card, and the brothels a registration number. Prostitutes recognised by the state were said to be \\"soumises\\", as opposed to those working clandestinely, known as \\"insoumises\\", who were punished. This regulation lasted until the closing of brothels in 1946 by the Loi Marthe Richard. Soliciting was prohibited and the women were confined to registered brothels. It was at this time that Alexandre Parent-Duchâtelet published De la prostitution dans la ville de Paris (Prostitution in the City of Paris), in which he noted the misery of prostitutes, which he estimated to be 10,000 in Paris, and the poor functioning of medical control.He notes in particular that the two doctors appointed to control the girls were corrupt. The Third Republic was the golden age of brothels, and they were accepted as part of social life. The state, and especially the tax authorities, benefited from this trade by taking 50 to 60 per cent of profits. This is the era of famous houses, such as Le Chabanais and Le Sphinx, whose reputation is known internationally. In Paris there were about 200 official establishments in the middle of the century, under the control of the police and doctors. This fell to about sixty at the end of the century as a result of the multiplication of illegal brothels which were then employing 15,000 prostitutes. From approximately 1871 to 1903, the writer Maxime Du Camp counted 155,000 women officially registered as prostitutes, but during the same period, the police stopped 725,000 others for clandestine prostitution. The prostitute, on the other hand, was reduced to a status of sub-citizen, subject to regulations whose application is left mostly in the hands of corrupt police officials. A series of scandals lead to the dissolution of the Brigade des mœurs in 1881 (although it was reformed in 1901). In 1911, the police prefect Lépine authorises \\"houses of rendezvous\\" where prostitutes do not live, but where they come only to work. These include cafes with \\"waitresses\\", 115 of which opened in Paris that year. Other houses of rendezvous included perfumeries and bathing and massage premises. The police estimated that 40,000 clients a day frequented the various houses, which would be equivalent to saying that a quarter of Paris men had relations with prostitutes. Historian Charles Virmaître was particularly interested in Paris, its sexual mores, prostitution, brothels, and the various regulations and penalties. Many books deal with these themes: : Les virtuoses du trottoir (1868), Les maisons comiques; détails intimes et inédits de la vie de célébrités artistiques (1868), Paris-police (1886), Paris impur (1889), Paris-galant (1890), Paris cocu (1890), Paris documentaire : Trottoirs et lupanars (1893).. The traditional brothel, inherited from the brothels of the 19th century, underwent two major changes from around 1920. The prostitutes tended not to live in the brothels, under the changed regulations, the brothel was to occupy an entire building and the girls were boarders in order to contain prostitution. In the 1920s, in the face of real estate pressure, regulations allowed girls to become increasingly free to live outside. Secondly the hygiene requirements became increasingly important. =Appearance of the abolitionist movement in France= The abolitionist movement, born of the opposition to the \\"French-style\\" regulation in the United Kingdom, started to develop in France at the end of the 19th century. Most notably because of the campaign of opinion initiated by Josephine Butler. The French section of the International Abolitionist Federation was founded in 1926 under the name of the Union contre le trafic des êtres humains (Union against Trafficking in Human Beings) by feminist Marcelle Legrand-Falco. France had approved the International Agreement for the suppression of the White Slave Traffic in 1912, which had been one of the international achievements of the abolitionist movement. In 1925, brothels were closed in Bas-Rhin the prefect of police. = World War I = A group of filles de joie in Marseille, 1919 Paris, district of Villette, \\"public girl in the quarter\\"; photograph by Eugene Atget, 1921. During World War I, in Paris alone, US Army officials estimated that there were 40 major brothels, 5,000 professionally licensed streetwalkers, and another 70,000 unlicensed prostitutes. By 1917, there were at least 137 such establishments across 35 towns on or close to the Western front. Many were operated by the French authorities in an attempt to control STIs. Some of the prostitutes were recruited from the French colonies in North Africa. Brothels that had a high incidence of infections were closed. The British Army adopted local codes of ethics when fighting in another country, and so allowed troops on rest periods and days off to visit what became termed maisons tolérées. Such activity was not just tolerated but encouraged for both the young, as well as the married men who were missing their wives. As the war advanced, so did the need and rank of the prostitutes entertained. While British troops paid just six pence per day were often found in the lowest priced institutes, dominion soldiers from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada received six shillings and could afford higher-class \\"services\\". British officers preferred to \\"always indulge with armour (condoms)\\" and took to patronizing German Army officers' former prostitutes when the lines of conflict were advancing towards the end of the war, with the advantage that they sometimes gained tactical and strategic information as well. It is unknown how many or what percentage of men visited the institutions, but the French army recorded over a million cases of gonorrhea and syphilis during the war. In 1915, in Le Havre, a survey undertaken by the Royal Army Medical Corps counted 171,000 uniformed British Army visitors to the brothels in just one street. As a result, rates of venereal disease began to climb, with 23,000 British Army men at any time on average during the second half of the campaign hospitalized for treatment, with over 150,000 British soldiers having been infected by the end of the war. The disease at the time had a high social stigma, but a particularly bad infection could get a soldier medically discharged from frontline duty, even on a temporary basis. Syphilis was treated with injections of mercury, administered at a hospital over a 30-day period, thereby guaranteeing escape from the frontline. The result was that some prostitutes with particularly bad STI infections could charge more. Every British army unit had a sexually transmitted disease clinic, where soldiers could gain an ointment consisting of mercury and chlorine to prevent STI infection, or receive a urethral irrigation with potassium permanganate after STI exposure. The US Army attitude was different, driven by a reformist attitude at home. In October 1917, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker said: Aided by the American Social Hygiene Organization, he closed so called segregated zones close to Army training camps, which included closing the notorious Storyville district in New Orleans. When the two million soldiers of the American Expeditionary Force had been deployed to France, they were guided by a bulletin from AEF commander Gen. John Pershing to just say no: This was backed up by additional posters and pamphlets that read \\"You wouldn't use another fellow's tooth-brush, so why use his whore?\\" and \\"A Soldier Who Gets a Dose Is a Traitor!\\" The US Army had clear instructions on those who did not follow the no indulgence rule. US Army regulations required soldiers who admitted to having sex while on leave to submit to chemical prophylaxis, that included irrigating the penis. Soldiers who did not report for prophylaxis and later contracted STIs were subject to court-martial and possibly a hard-labor sentence, while those who contracted disease after treatment only lost pay during treatment. Implemented from the first day of training, the initiative was so successful that US Army doctors reported that 96% of the cases they treated had been contracted while the soldier was still a civilian. However, on debarkation at the designated port of St. Nazaire, a dispute with French authorities broke out, after the AEF placed the Maisons Tolérée off limits. With the dispute escalating, President Georges Clemenceau sent a memo to Gen. Pershing offering a compromise: American medical authorities would control designated brothels operated solely for American soldiers. Pershing passed the proposal to Raymond Fosdick, who gave it to Secretary Baker. Upon receiving it, Baker responded: \\"For God's sake, Raymond, don't show this to the president or he'll stop the war.\\" The French later proposed a deal that targeted the Black American troops, most of whom were assigned to unloading freight in segregated stevedore battalions, again flatly turned down by US authorities. But this merely highlighted US differential racial policy, as all black troops were required by US Army regulations to undertake prophylaxis when returning from leave, whether or not they acknowledged sexual contact. The policy adopted by the US Army worked, with far lower rates of STIs across their troops compared to French or British and Dominion combatants. However, after the signing of the Armistice, when the US Army could no longer plead military necessity as grounds for curtailing leave, STI rates among US Army troops shot up. =World War II= During the German occupation, the Wehrmacht promoted and organised a system of prostitution to avoid problems caused by relationships with women carrying venereal diseases or abuse. Brothels were controlled and classified, some reserved for officers and the Gestapo, others for enlisted soldiers. Soldiers and prostitutes were regularly monitored to prevent problems. During World War II, Dr Edith Sumerskill raised the issue of Maisons Tolérées in Parliament to Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden after the intervention of the British Expeditionary Force. Further questions were raised in Parliament after the D-Day invasion, to ensure such local practises and medical precautions were continued. After liberation, US soldiers encouraged by the propaganda of the US military, including via his newspaper Stars and Stripes, engaged in an uncontrollable debauchery. For the American soldier, France \\"is a huge mess in which live 40 million hedonists who spend their time eating, drinking and making love\\" according to Joe Weston, a journalist for Life. Propaganda largely conveying this image was aimed to encourage recruits to join the army. Persuaded that the French are a people of depraved, the soldiers seek prostitutes and promotes prostitution. In some cities such as Le Havre, one of the places the US Army arrives in France, public places are filled with soldiers seeking a relationship or practising it in plain view. French women also contributed to prostitution to support themselves. Poverty drives many girls to engage in it. Prostitution was out of control, the French authorities lack resources and the US military oscillates between an official regulation (organising brothels near military camps, followed in prophylactic stations to limit venereal diseases) and an informal indifference which promotes the spread of venereal disease and lack of control of the soldiers. This difficult period led towards the prohibition of prostitution, especially towards the owners of brothels, who were accused of collaboration with the Nazi occupiers. =The end of brothels= At the end of the Second World War, there were 1,500 officially recognised brothels in France, including 177 in Paris. Although France was the country of origin of regulationism, there were frequent proposals for the abolition of brothels (1903, 1920, 1930, 1931 and 1936). With public opinion against brothel owners due to accusations of collaboration during the German occupation, Marthe Richard revived the process in 1945. The Loi Marthe Richard closes brothels and provides for the creation of prevention and social rehabilitation services (SPRS) in large French cities. The law allowed brothels six months to close, the closure coming in to force on November 6, 1946. Although the law provided for reception and reeducation centres to help prostitutes to exit the industry, there was not enough budget allowed to set up the centres, so 40,000 \\"subjects\\" were found in the street. They join the \\"insoumises\\" or move to the colonies (which are not subject to the new law) or to European countries to exercise their trade. A minority started work in factories or cafes. The brothel owners open clandestine establishments, known as clandés, especially in big cities and around US and French military barracks. The brigades des mœurs, with the green light of the prefecture, practised a forced tolerance. Freed from police supervision, prostitution multiplies: in 1953, the lowest estimates were of 40,000 prostitutes in Paris (the highest being 70,000), while there are nearly 500 clandestine brothels, a number which was increasing. However, the Loi Marthe Richard did not apply in the colonies, which is one of the reasons France did non sign the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others until 1960. Indeed, the colonial authorities consider it necessary to maintain brothels around the colonial troops, and thus organise this prostitution. Active solicitation was also outlawed in the late 1940s. Passive solicitation (being present with revealing clothes at locations known for prostitution) was outlawed in 2003 as part of a package of law-and-order measures by then-interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, in his \\"Domestic Security Bill\\" (loi pour la sécurité intérieure 2003, or LSI also known as Loi Sarkozy II), and had the effect of reducing the visibility of prostitution on the streets.Loi pour la sécurité intérieure de 2003 Wikipedia Prostitutes' organizations decried the measure, which came into force in March 2003, calling it punitive and fated to increase the power of pimps.French police turn attention to 'the pimp on the corner' , The Independent, 21 March 2005 Many prostitutes started to work out of vans, a strategy authorities attempted to combat by using parking regulation enforcement. =Prostitutes activism= Demonstration by prostitutes in Paris, France, in October 2005. In August 1973, Jacqueline Treppler created an association of prostitutes, Les petites sœurs des cœurs (Little Sisters of Hearts), which proposed the creation of a chain of Eros centres, based on the German model, to decriminalize the profession. She also calls for a tax on prostitution. She received the support of Martha Richard, whose battle led the closure of brothels, who was in favour of a revision of \\"her\\" law\\". In June 1975, after roundups, closures of love hotels, and repressions of all kinds by the police, prostitutes, who claimed to work without pimps, complained of not being able to exercise their profession. On June 2, 1975, a hundred prostitutes from Lyon occupied the church Saint-Nizier in protest. This precipitated the occupation of other churches in Montpellier, Toulouse, Cannes, and the Chapel of Saint Bernard de Montparnasse in Paris on June 7, by over 500 prostitutes who demand recognition of their rights. Grisélidis Réal is one of the leaders of this movement that demands a recognised status for prostitutes, social security, the end of police repression, and opposes the reopening of brothels. In the 21st century, the fight against pimps has grown and caused the closure of many brothels. A law for internal security known as the Sarkozy law, whose article 225-10-1 was aimed at soliciting and was promulgated on March 19, 2003, provoking the appearance of a second movement of prostitutes in 2002. Since 2006, the Pute Pride has been held every year in Paris as a pride march for sex workers. Some sex workers in France are not in favour of binding legislation such as brothels, which do not allow them to retain the choice of their customers, practices, schedules, prevention, etc. Sex workers, gathered in Assisi on 16 March 2007, concluded unanimously that they will \\"march for the defence of our rights\\". In November 2007, prostitutes and their allies continued to protest the repression of soliciting by gathering before the Senate and protest for their rights. Soliciting on the street became more and more repressed and dangerous. As a result, some prostitutes started to establish contacts on the Internet in 2008. On March 20, 2009, at the end of the European Conference on Prostitution held at the Théâtre de l'Odéon, the STRASS (Syndicat du Travail Sexuel) was born. Since its creation, this union has received the support of at least 200 members and created 5 federations at the national level, as well as a representation in Great Britain. =Law to penalise the clients of prostitution= In April 2011, a parliamentary commission report (\\"En finir avec le mythe du plus vieux métier du monde\\") recommended the adoption of the Swedish approach of criminalizing the purchase of sex. The social affairs minister, Roselyne Bachelot, supported the proposal, stating, \\"There is no such thing as freely chosen and consenting prostitution. The sale of sexual acts means women's bodies are made available for men, independently of the wishes of those women.\\" Other support came from Mouvement du Nid. The French sex worker movement STRASS has condemned the proposals. In October and November 2013, French lawmakers began debating a proposal to punish customers of prostitution.« Vers une proposition de loi sanctionnant les clients de prostituées par une contravention », in Le Figaro, 2 octobre 2013, p. 12. (in French) On December 4, the National Assembly passed a bill fining customers of prostitutes by 268 votes to 138, with 79 abstaining, which would impose fines of at least €1500 on clients caught paying for sexual relations. Within the National Assembly, most of those who supported the bill were MPs from the Socialist Party, which dominates the house. The law was passed in the National Assembly on December 4, 2013. The bill caused considerable controversy in France among politicians and intellectuals, some for legalizing prostitution, and others wanting it banned. The bill was opposed by many sex workers, and was rejected by the French Senate in July 2014. Finally, on 6 April 2016, the French National Assembly voted to fine customers of prostitutes €1500.Prostitution : la pénalisation des clients définitivement votée au Parlement 'Le Figaro', accessed 7 April 2016 References and notes Bibliography            Régis Révenin, Homosexuality and male prostitution in Paris: 1870–1918, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2005 ( )     * External links \\" Confessions sur l’oreiller Testimonies of prostitutes and customers History of France by topic Prostitution in France France ","title":"History of prostitution in France"},{"id":"59988001","text":"The 1999 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game was a postseason college football game between the Georgia Southern Eagles and the Youngstown State Penguins.

Location  The boathouse is located at Stow Lake, which is on the easternmost side of Golden Gate Park. Frederick Law Olmsted laid the groundwork for the creation of Golden Gate Park in what was the Outside Lands in the western end of San Francisco. The park was built from east to west, with Strawberry Hill and Stow Lake being among some of the first constructions.  History and Architecture  The original Stow Lake Boathouse was built in 1893 in preparation for the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894 held in Golden Gate Park. The original rustic style boathouse was designed by Arthur Page Brown, an American architect who is best known for his design of the San Francisco Ferry Building. The first boathouse was much larger than the structure there today and had a gabled window above the roof and a wrap-around porch. After a fire destroyed the building in 1937, it was rebuilt in 1946 – 1949 from designs by architect Warren C. Perry who gave it an alpine chalet style look meant to integrate with the surrounding natural landscape. This was a style that was growing in popularity in San Francisco during the 1920s. The new boathouse was constructed by builders Wellnitz and DeNarde, who also did the rehabilitation of the Murphy Windmill in 1948. The new Stow Lake Boathouse was the first building constructed in Golden Gate Park after the end of World War II. The delay in construction was most likely caused by the depressed economy leftover from the 1930s and the start of World War II.  Tenants and Operations  Stow Lake Boathouse is owned by the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department, who governs all San Francisco public parks. The boathouse has been offering boat rentals since it was constructed in 1893 when it was known as the Strawberry Lake Boathouse. It is unknown who ran the operation until Calvin V. Tilden first leased the property in 1943. In 1971, his son, Calvin B. Tilden, took over and it remained in the family until 2011 when San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department evicted them. There was a protest and controversy over the change in tenants that was led by Suzanne R. Dumont, who created the Save Stow Lake Boathouse Coalition. The concern was that if a corporation took over the operation they would remodel it and destroy the old- fashioned character of the boathouse. Dumont lost her argument with the city and in February 2011 the Board of Supervisors approved the lease to Ortega Family Enterprises, which operates a number of concessions in national parks. Ortega received assistance from lobbyist, Alex Tourk, who helped them campaign to get the lease. Ortega did remodel the building, adding a small indoor café, painting the exterior while preserving the original look, and upgrading the kitchen.  Landmarking  In 2011, the Historic Preservation Commission determined that the boathouse was eligible as a landmark but put the decision on hold for consideration until 2012, when they decided to consider the boathouse as part of Golden Gate Park landmarking.

The freighter spent her entire career in the Pacific connecting the West Coast of the United States with the Chinese and Japanese ports in the Far East. Early in 1928 the ship together with ten other vessels was sold by the US Government to the States Steamship Co. and subsequently renamed Nevada. In September 1932 the vessel while on her regular trip to Japan ran aground in foggy weather on Amatignak Island and subsequently broke into three parts and sank with the loss of thirty four out of thirty seven men. Design and construction After the United States entry into World War I, a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Most of these new vessels were known as the West ships as they were built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States and all were given names that began with the word West. Design 1019 cargo ship was among the designs adopted by USSB, and was a standard cargo freighter of approximately 8,800 deadweight designed by Theodore E. Ferris. West Niger was the second ship of the second batch order placed by USSB with Southwestern Shipbuilding on 10 July 1918 and was laid down on 17 April 1919 and launched on 28 September 1919 (yard number 12), with Mrs. H.C. Bedwell of Los Angeles being the sponsor. The ship had two main decks, four main holds and had also all the modern machinery fitted for quick loading and unloading of the cargo from five main hatches, including ten winches and a large number of derricks. The vessel had electric lights installed along the decks and was also equipped with wireless. After successfully completing her trial trip on January 26, West Niger left five days later for San Francisco. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . West Niger was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 8,542. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 359 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three Scotch marine boilers fitted for both coal and oil fuel. Operational history In December 1919 as the vessel was nearing the end of construction West Niger was allocated to Pacific Mail Steamship Co. to operate on California to the Orient route. Upon delivery West Niger departed Los Angeles on January 31, 1920 for San Francisco where after inspection the ship was officially accepted by USSB. After loading her cargo, the ship departed for her maiden voyage on February 18, 1920 bound for Chinese and Japanese ports via Honolulu. On March 16 while leaving Yokohama West Niger ran aground in the Yokohama Bay but was able to refloat herself at next high tide and proceeded on her journey. After visiting ports of China and Manila, the freighter returned to San Francisco on May 28 bringing back nearly 6,700 tons of cargo consisting of 2,024 tons of sugar, large quantities of tea, jute bags and other oriental merchandise. West Niger made two more trips to the Orient, during her third one she carried among other things 500,000 gallons of gasoline for the Philippines to help alleviate an ongoing fuel shortage crisis there. Upon return to San Francisco on December 30, 1920 West Niger together with many other vessels was laid up in Benicia due to overabundance of tonnage and lack of cargo. In early January 1923 the ship was reactivated by USSB and put into Moore's Shipbuilding Co. drydock for reconditioning. On March 9, 1923 it was reported that the vessel was taken over by Columbia Pacific Shipping Company in San Francisco, and soon departed for Portland to load cargo for delivery to Japan and China. The freighter was assigned to the Oregon Oriental Line and carried cargo between the ports of the Pacific Northwest and ports of Japan and China. On her westward journeys the ship transported mostly lumber and flour to the ports of Japan and North China, and on her return voyages she was loaded with oriental goods, such as hemp, copra, sugar and a variety of vegetable oils. After a year of service the freighter was briefly laid up on March 20, 1924 due to drop in cargo availability, but returned to the Northern China route in May of the same year. For example, in June 1925 the freighter carried over 4,500,000 feet of lumber from Oregon ports to Far East destinations. In June 1925 USSB decided to have oil tanks of approximately 600-700 tons capacity installed on several vessels operated by Oregon Oriental Line to allow the ships carry large quantities of vegetable oils in bulk. West Niger entered the drydock at Portland at the end of September 1925 and returned to service in October after completion of installation. During her career West Niger came to other ships rescue on several occasions. In July 1924 when another Columbia Pacific vessel West Jena lost her tail shaft and propeller she was taken in tow from Dutch Harbor to Astoria by West Niger safely bringing the disabled freighter to port on July 31. In late May 1925 West Niger, while on a return trip from Dairen to San Francisco, picked up a wireless call for help from another Columbia Pacific ship, West Kader, who claimed to have water in her fuel tanks shutting down her engines. West Niger took the disabled vessel in tow and brought her to the mouth of Columbia River, where she was transferred to a local tug. In early April 1926 West Niger came to aid of steamer of the Admiral Oriental Line who lost a propeller in a gale halfway between Seattle and Japan. West Niger started towing the disabled vessel but the line parted and after several attempts to get another line Wheatland Montana was finally taken into tow. After about two weeks of towing, about 700 miles from the Puget Sound, West Niger was relieved by another Admiral Oriental Line steamer, SS City of Spokane and continued to her destination. On July 5, 1927 while on passage from Iloilo to Cebu West Niger went ashore on Cap Island, about 80 miles south of Cebu. The freighter sustained little damage and was able to refloat herself and reached Cebu on July 7. On February 16, 1928 it was announced that USSB got out of shipping business and disposed of its remaining three cargo lines in the Pacific. Oregon Oriental Line was one of these lines and was sold together with 11 ships it operated to a concern headed by Kenneth D. Dawson, owner of Columbia Pacific Shipping Co. for 1,065,000. West Niger was one of the vessels sold, and her price tag was set at 95,000. The acquired ships were to be operated by the newly formed States Steamship Co., and as part of the transfer were also renamed after states, with West Niger becoming Nevada. At the time of acquisition, West Niger was still on her way from Far East and did not reach Portland until June 12. After unloading her cargo, the freighter was put into dock for examination and repairs, following which she loaded cargo for her next trip and left for her first trip under new ownership in early July. The ship continued sailing on the same route between Portland and Japanese and Chinese ports through the end of her career. =Sinking= Nevada departed Astoria for her last journey on September 16, 1932 bound for Yokohama carrying full cargo of lumber, flour and general merchandise. The vessel was under command of captain T. W. Johansen and had a crew of 35 and additionally had one passenger on board. The trip was largely uneventful until September 27, when at approximately 20:00 in foggy weather the freighter suddenly ran aground at full speed on the eastern tip of Amatignak Island. Nevada sent S.O.S. signal which was picked up by Japanese steamer Oregon Maru located nearby, and American liner approximately 500 miles away from the site of the wreck. Both vessels turned around and rushed to the aid of the distressed freighter. In the meantime, the crew tried to launch lifeboats, but due to high surf and strong winds it was nearly impossible to do, as the waves kept crushing over the ship. One lifeboat was launched successfully, but it eventually capsized taking all but three men down with it. Some of the crew drowned when swept off the deck by heavy waves or thrown against the deckload of lumber, some jumped overboard and tried to swim towards the shore. The captain, the third mate and the radio operator remained on board the ship but when the help arrived they were nowhere to be found. The next day the weather turned for the worse, with a gale arriving which broke the ship in three pieces. Oregon Maru reached the wreck after a prolonged search around 21:00 on September 28. Their attempts to save the survivors were unsuccessful as due to fog, gale and heavy seas they were not able to reach the shore, losing one lifeboat in the process. President Madison arrived around noon the next day and after a four hour struggle was able to launch a lifeboat that reached the island and took off three survivors and transferred them on board the liner. They were safely landed in Victoria on October 5. On October 2 the States Steamship Company's vessel SS Oregon which was dispatched in the aftermath of the disaster reached the wreck and after thorough investigation of the wreck and the island found no traces of other survivors. On October 4 the U.S. Coast Guard cutter finally reached the area after being dispatched from Seward on September 30. After searching the area they also failed to locate any additional survivors.

To graduate from Brown's College, students need only have taken 30 courses, completed a concentration, and demonstrated fluency in the writing of English. Adopted in 1969 after the circulation of a report by Brown undergraduate students Ira C. Magaziner and Elliott E. Maxwell, it has since become one of Brown's best-known attributes.  History  From its founding in 1764 as one of America's nine Colonial colleges, Brown (originally called Rhode Island College) was characterized by a spirit of openness: it became the first college in the United States to accept students regardless of their religious background, a practice dating from its founding charter. While in early years Brown's curriculum was similar to that of Princeton (where Brown's first president, James Manning, had studied), with its emphasis on the Classics, President Francis Wayland instituted a series of curricular reforms in the 1850s, aimed at modernizing and diversifying Brown's offerings. With Wayland's reforms, students could now study modern languages, and applied sciences. Another important influence on the development of the Open Curriculum was the institution of \\"University Courses\\" in 1958: these were intimate discussion-style classes that were interdisciplinary in their nature, and therefore affiliated with no single department. In 1966, seventy Brown undergraduates formed a Group Independent Study Program to scrutinize Brown's curriculum, and propose reforms. By 1968, the group comprised twenty-five students, two of whom, Ira Magaziner and Elliott Maxwell, wrote a substantive 400-page report, \\"Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown.\\" The report called for the institution of several reforms, including: * The elimination of all distribution requirements in favor of an \\"Open Curriculum\\" * The elimination of pluses and minuses when grading * The option to take courses on a Satisfactory/No Credit basis rather than receiving traditional grades * The introduction of \\"Modes of Thought\\" courses for freshmen Though Brown's administration was at first reluctant to entertain the report, eventually a faculty meeting was called after Maxwell and Magaziner personally visited every Brown professor. After a two-day faculty meeting, Brown's faculty agreed to implement the New Curriculum. =50th anniversary= 2019's celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Open Curriculum opened with a picnic on the Main Green In May 2019, Brown began a 12-month commemoration and celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Open Curriculum.

Hemp was introduced as a crop from Central and East Asia to Europe by the Scythians during the Bronze Age and it was cultivated in France by 1000 CE and used for a number of purposes including canvas for sails and sacks, rope, and as a textile.

It is a detailed manual of instruction for British military infantry swordsmanship. It is the oldest known British manual intended to teach purely military swordsmanship on foot. Four editions were printed between 1798 and 1824, the first three in London, UK and the last in New York, USA. Known colloquially by its acronym AOD, the manual teaches a universal system of swordsmanship that is applicable to all military swords used on foot at that time. This includes the Broad Sword, Sabre, Spadroon and Hanger. It also includes a section on walking stick defence and opposing bayonets with a sword. The AOD system is a predominately linear (footwork) system that is deeply grounded in the back, broad and sheering (spadroon) sword sources of the late 17th and early 18th century. It utilises a parry-riposte system, where a strong defence is commonly made before responding with an attack. Extensive use of slipping (withdrawing the target your enemy aims at) and shifting (withdrawing the lead leg) is integral to the system. Attacks are broken down to a simple six cut system as first shown in Gaspard La Marchant’s official ‘Rules and Regulations for the Sword Exercise of the Cavalry’, of 1796. Roworth’s system also includes a range of traversing steps, thrusts and grapples. Roworth’s manual was never officially recognised by the British military. However, it was published at a time when there was no official manual for infantry exercise, and as such was recommended by many civilian and military publications of the time. The system shown is also very closely related with the Angelo’s, who went on to teach and create official military manuals on civilian swordsmanship that were used extensively throughout the 19th century.Art of Defence on Foot, Fourth Edition, reproduced and introduced by The Academy of Historical Fencing  Author – Charles Roworth  The Art of Defence is sometimes incorrectly attributed to John Taylor. A sword master whose ten lesson structure was added by Roworth in his third edition (see below). Charles Roworth was a popular printer in London, who printed many military works, as well as other written works, including those of Jane Austen.Jane Austen In Context, Janet Todd, 2005, Cambridge University Press He served in the Royal Westminster Volunteers,Art of Defence on Foot, by C. Roworth, Second Edition, 1798 a militia unit whose job it was to maintain order and protect the country in case of invasion.  Second Edition (1798)  The second edition was published in the same year as the first and has few changes. The most significant is the removal of the ‘Inside Guard 2nd Position’ plate and description. It was effectively replaced with the half circle or spadroon guard, as is shown in Angelo’s 1799 work.Roworth’s Art of Defence on Foot, Second Edition, scanned and introduced by the Academy of Historical Fencing  Third edition and John Taylor (1804)  In 1804 a third edition of the AOD was released. The most significant change in this manual was the addition of the ’10 lessons of John Taylor’. Taylor’s lesson’s and manual exercise (solo drill) were depicted in Henry Angelo’s work in 1799, forming the entire basis of his infantry system. Those depicted in Roworth’s manual are altered slightly. The most significant change being the implementation of thrusts in the lessons. The third edition also advises the swordsmen to keep the point of the sword directed at their opponent’s eye in the typical guard positions, as opposed to previous editions, where the blade was directed 6-8 inches above their head. This may speak to the increasing emphasis on the use of the point. A fact that is supported by the changes to the ten lessons of Taylor. John Taylor never published any works of his own, though is referenced in both Angelo and Roworth's work. He was sword master to the First Life Guards, and Sergeant and Sword master to the London and Westminster Light Horse Volunteers. He taught military swordsmanship at his fencing academy in Fish Street Hill, London, in the early 19th century.Morning Post, 18 June 1806Leeds Intellegencer, May 1821  Fourth Edition (1824)  Published in New York, USA in 1824.

Roworth used Henry Angelo as an expert witness and was ultimately successful.copyrighthistory.org Roworth v. Wilkes (1807)  Use in Historical Fencing/HEMA  Roworth’s manual is a key source for those practicing British Military Swordsmanship of the late 18th and early 19th century, as well as those studying American military swordsmanship of the 19th century.

It stands in front of the and not far from the place where the brothers were born. The bronze statue was unveiled by Queen Juliana on 28 May 1964. Description The statue is approximately tall. It depicts two men standing on a thick square bronze base plate, mounted on a low square stone plinth. The attenuated figures have similar modelling to Zadkine's statue De verwoeste stad (\\"The devastated city\\") in Rotterdam. The figures stand close together, intertwined, holding hands and leaning their heads together, although neither figure closely resembles the person it is intended to represent. The high light coloured stone plinth comes from Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in the south of France, where Vincent van Gogh resided for a year, and was donated by the municipal council of the French town. It contains a tube with soil from the garden of the hospital at the monastery of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, where Vincent was treated for his mental health. The plinth has weathered from white to a dirty yellow, stained by verdigris leached from the bronze sculpture. The front is inscribed with a quotation in French from one of the last letters written by Vincent to Theo van Gogh, dated 23 July 1890. This letter remained unfinished and unsent at the time of Vincent's death; he had it with him when he shot himself on 27 July, causing wounds that ultimately led to his death two days later:RM25, To Theo van Gogh.

The Van Lanschot family were also originally from Zundert. The Van Gogh brothers were born nearby, Vincent in 1853 and Theo in 1857. The house where they were born has since been demolished, but there is now a museum at the on the site. Their father was a Dutch Reformed church pastor who preached at the on the square. Zadkine was commissioned to make the sculpture in 1963. He made at least four sculptures and busts of Vincent van Gogh between 1955 and 1964, including a statue of Vincent standing alone unveiled in 1961 in Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where Vincent died in 1890 and where both brothers are buried in adjacent plots, and a bust of Vincent for the asylum at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. In his earlier work, Zadkine had discussed the relationship of Vincent with his brother with Van Gogh expert Mark Tralbaut, and an initial design had the two men seated, but Zadkine quickly abandoned that concept; within a matter of days after the commission was granted, he worked up a plaster model of the men standing together. He presented the model to journalists in Zundert on 14 May 1963. The bronze sculpture was cast at the Susse Frères foundry in Paris. It bears the inscriptions \\"O Zadkine 1963\\" and \\"Susse Fondeur Paris\\". It was unveiled by Queen Juliana on 28 May 1964, in the presence of Zadkine, Mark Tralbaut, and the Mayor of Zundert, GJA Manders.

It has been held by the Tate Gallery since 1923. Unusually, the work is painted with two different images, one on each side of the canvas. The unfinished surreal images both have covert sexual imagery. The painting on the front of the canvas, A Caprice, is believed to have been painted first. It depicts a scene in a theatre. A woman in a black dress with green details is being led by a short black-faced person in a red costume towards an arched doorway opening onto an auditorium. The woman has a white feather in her black hat, and is holding a white muff; her pallid white face is shown in profile, with prominent red lips and cheeks. The painting seems to be inspired by the first of Beardsley's three images depicting \\"The Comedy-Ballet of Marionnettes, as performed by the troupe of the Theatre-Impossible, posed in three drawings\\", which were published in the second volume of the avant-garde art journal The Yellow Book in July 1894. In the illustration, drapes hanging in the arched doorway give it a phallic appearance. In the painting, the red- clothed dwarf with black face may represent female genitalia. On the reverse is a painting known as Masked Woman with a White Mouse. The subject, a woman in a black face mask, is similarly wearing a dark dress, and made up with white skin with red lips and a black beauty spot, and black hair. Incongruously, a white mouse is passing on a flat surface before her, as if along the edge of a balcony, but she pays it no attention. The painting occupies the slightly smaller space within the stretcher, which frames the composition. The mouse is commonly interpreted a Freudian symbol for the penis, although some commentators have noted that Freud's psychoanalytical work was not known in London in 1894. A Caprice measures ; Masked Woman with a White Mouse measures . The paintings may be influenced by William Rothenstein, who also contributed to The Yellow Book and with whom Beardsley shared a studio. The paintings may also be influenced by works of Pietro Longhi depicting the Venetian Carnival. Neither painting was finished, and the canvas was abandoned by Beardsley in 1895 and left behind at 114 Cambridge Street, Pimlico, when his lease ended. It was found by the new tenant, Mrs. Pugh, along with many drawings which she destroyed. It was bought by R.A. Walker in 1920; he gave it the title A Caprice, and sold it to the Tate in 1923.

He is also documented as having translated the remains of Boisil of Melrose Abbey, as well as numerous northern English minor saints of the 7th and 8th centuries: the anchorites Balther and Bilfrid; Acca, Alchmund and Eata, bishops of Hexham; Oswin, king of Deira; and the abbesses Ebba and Æthelgitha.

Biography The finding of Cuthbert's incorrupt body, from Bede's Life of St Cuthbert =Cuthbert's shrine and the Durham Ecclesia Major= Alfred served as sacristan at the shrine of St Cuthbert in Durham during the time of the bishops Edmund, Æthelric and Æthelwine, in the early–mid 11th century.Kendall 1984, pp. 2, 11–12, 15 The miraculously incorrupt remains of the saint, who died in 687, were then housed in a large stone church or cathedral referred to as the Ecclesia Major, dedicated in 998 and demolished to make way for the existing Norman cathedral in around 1093.Kendall 1984, p. 5Bonney 2005, p. 23 The early chronicler of Durham's history Symeon of Durham praises Alfred as a pious man and an ideal custodian to Cuthbert's relics, and the later chronicler Reginald of Durham describes him as being \\"of decent life\\".Kendall 1984, p. 15 His descendant Ailred of Rievaulx describes him as an \\"active teacher\\". The modern theologian and historian Benedicta Ward, in her biography of Bede, describes Alfred as a stern teacher to the cathedral's young novices, and states that he was recorded as being respected by the \\"honest and God- fearing\\".Ward 1998, pp. 139–43 The modern historian John Crook writes that Alfred was \\"highly respected\\" by all three of the Durham bishops. W. M. Aird, on the other hand, describes him as the leader of a group that expelled Bishop Æthelric in around 1045; the bishop was subsequently reinstated by Earl Siward and succeeded by his brother Æthelwine.Aird 1994, p. 7 For part or all of his time as sacristan, Alfred is reported to have had the sole responsibility for tending to Cuthbert's remains,Kendall 1984, pp. 2, 15 and several stories have accumulated about his exceptional devotion to Cuthbert. According to Symeon and Reginald, Alfred removed one of Cuthbert's hairs, and found that it miraculously failed to burn. Reginald adds that he frequently opened the coffin to wrap the saint's body in robes, and to trim his fingernails and cut or comb his hair and beard.Kendall 1984, pp. 15, 18Crook 2011, pp. 1, 98–99Ward 1998, p. 142 An ivory liturgical or ordinary comb was among the treasures found in Cuthbert's shrine in 1827. Reginald claims that the two exchanged \\"familiar speech\\" at times, stating that Cuthbert gave Alfred detailed instructions on what to do with the various saints' relics he collected. He also recounts a story about a weasel that reared her litter in the reliquary. Modern historians consider Reginald's uncorroborated material to be of dubious historical value.For example, Crook 2011, p. 99; Ward 1998, p. 142 Calvin B. Kendall has suggested that the story of Alfred tending to the body's hair and nails might have originated in a similar account relating to the Norwegian king and saint Olaf, whose body was said to be tended by his son after his death in 1030; according to Kendall, this story would have been known to Turgot of Durham – the prior of the Durham monastery who oversaw the translation of Cuthbert's remains into the new cathedral in 1104 – as he had previously stayed at the Norwegian court.Kendall 1984, p. 18 Ward notes its similarity to stories associated with English saints, including Osmund of Salisbury. =Hexham and personal life= In addition to his sacristan duties, Alfred also held the church of Hexham, Northumberland, from Bishop Edmund, where his family were hereditary priests.Kendall 1984, pp. 11–12 As he lived in Durham, his Hexham duties were delegated first to Gamel the Elder (Gamel Hamel) and then to Gamel iunge. Alfred was married, his wife being the sister of Collan, prior of Hexham. His date of death is unknown, but he is recorded to be still alive at the time of Bishop Æthelwine (1056–71); Crook speculates that he might have died just before the Norman Conquest.Crook 2011, pp. 98–99Kendall 1984, pp. 11–12, 14, 24 Alfred's son Eilaf Larwa and his grandson, also named Eilaf, each succeeded him as the priest at Hexham.Kendall 1984, pp. 11–12, 23 A grandson Aldred or Aluredus is also recorded as a shrine keeper.Crook 2011, p. 101 The saint Ailred, Cistercian abbot of Rievaulx, was Alfred's great-grandson.Crook 2011, pp. 98, 102 Relic collector Boisil greeting Cuthbert at Melrose Abbey Alfred was an assiduous collector of relics of saints for Cuthbert's shrine at Durham as well as the church at Hexham. The medieval specialist Bertram Colgrave describes him as \\"the arch-relic-hunter\\", exemplifying the \\"rage for relics\\" of his time.Colgrave 1985, pp. 318, 339–40 Symeon explicitly records his having ceremonially moved (translated) the remains of the following saints, after having been informed of their whereabouts by visions:O'Donnell 2014, pp. 137–39Kendall 1984, pp. 2–3, 12–16, 20Farmer 2011, pp. 2, 34, 52Colgrave 1985, pp. 318, 246Crook 2011, pp. 99, 102–3 *Boisil (died 661) of Melrose Abbey, mentor to Cuthbert, whose remains were deposited in their own shrine in Durham in around 1020; *Balther (or Baldred; died 756 or 757) of the monastery of Tyningham, named as an anchorite; *Bilfrid (or Billfrith), a Lindisfarne goldsmith and anchorite known for working the ornate case of the Lindisfarne Gospels, now lost; *Acca (died 740) and Alchmund (or Alcmund; died 780 or 781), two of the Hexham bishops, who were reburied in the church at Hexham in around 1040; according to some sources, parts of their relics were also translated to Durham; *Oswin (died 651), the murdered king of Deira, who had a following at Tynemouth; *the abbesses Ebba (or Æbbe; died 683) of Coldingham and Æthelgitha, an otherwise- unknown abbess, possibly also from Coldingham or another Northumberland convent. =Hexham bishops: Acca, Alchmund and Eata= A variant version of the story of Alchmund of Hexham's translation is given by an anonymous author, probably from Hexham, in the Historia Regum. The vision of Bishop Alchmund is here given to a person referred to as \\"Dregmo\\", who summons Alfred to rebury the remains in Hexham church. Alfred complies, but secretly takes a fingerbone, which he plans to take to the shrine in Durham. On the following day the saint's bier proves immovable from the portico; Dregmo has a second vision exposing the theft, to which Alfred readily admits. After the restoration of the fingerbone, the ceremony proceeds unhindered. This version is repeated by Ailred of Rievaulx.Kendall 1984, pp. 12–14Crook 2011, pp. 100–1 According to the Historia Regum as well as the accounts of Richard of Hexham and Ailred of Rievaulx, when Bishop Acca was reburied in Hexham, several relics were removed undamaged from his grave. These included some of his vestments (chasuble, dalmatic and maniple), his shroud and a silk tunic, as well as a wooden portable altar. The chasuble and portions of his \\"face-cloth\\" appear in a list of Durham Cathedral's relics compiled in 1383.Crook 2011, p. 100 The 12th-century Life of St Eata suggests that a third Hexham bishop and saint, Eata (died 686), might also have been translated within the Hexham church by Alfred, although he is not mentioned in either Symeon's list of saints or Ailred's work. Eata also served as Abbot of Melrose Abbey and Bishop of Lindisfarne, and had taught both Cuthbert and Boisil.Crook 2011, pp. 101–2 =Theft of Bede= Bede's tomb at Durham Cathedral Alfred is also traditionally reported to have stolen the bones of the scholar and saint Bede (died 735) from its shrine in Jarrow, and translated them to Durham in secret.For example, Offler 1962, pp. 592–93; Kendall 1984, pp. 1, 3–6; Farmer 2011, p. 40; Colgrave 1985, pp. 339–40; Ward 1998, pp. 140–41; Crook 2011, pp. 102–3. Symeon's detailed account is uncharacteristically circumspect. No vision is mentioned. After establishing that Alfred was in the habit of commemorating Bede's death by visiting the Jarrow monastery, it states that one year he arrived back early, having left his companions behind, and never returned to Jarrow. He is then said to have acted as if he had \\"secured the object of his desires\\", saying when asked about the whereabouts of Bede's bones that they were in Cuthbert's shrine, but enjoining his listeners to keep the matter to themselves. When Cuthbert's coffin was opened a few days before its translation to the Norman cathedral, around half a century after Alfred's death, a little linen bag was discovered, subsequently claimed to contain Bede's bones.Kendall 1984, pp. 1, 3–6Ward 1998, pp. 140–41Crook 2011, pp. 102–3 The story has some similarities with the 9th-century theft by Ariviscus of the French Sainte Foy's relics from Agen, Aquitaine.Kendall 1984, note 82, p. 26 The discovery of the bag is also described by an eye-witness to the opening of the coffin in the later \\"Miracle 18\\" account. The anonymous author states that Bede's bones were known to have been removed from his original burial place in Jarrow; he names Alfred only indirectly as the person who also translated Boisil's remains.Kendall 1984, pp. 8–9Crook 2011, p. 103 Kendall notes that examinations of Cuthbert's coffin in the 1050s are not recorded to have found a linen bag. He considers the tradition of Alfred's secret translation of Bede to be \\"probably apocryphal\\", inferring that it was invented to provide provenance for the unidentified bones in the linen bag.Kendall 1984, pp. 1, 6, 9, 16–19 Some subsequent 20th- and 21st-century scholars have also cast doubts on the story's authenticity.Story & Bailey 2015, section \\"The Bedan identity of Symeon's bagged bones\\" and note 59 Ward describes it as a \\"strange story\\", and draws attention to its close parallels with the medieval \\"pious theft\\" literary tradition, a genre that embraces wholly fictional accounts.Geary 2011, pp. 12–14 She notes that the earliest written account of the removal of the bones dates from at least 100 years later, there is no external evidence for Alfred's action, and the attendant secrecy meant that the translation did not fulfil its purpose. She suggests another possibility: that monks from Jarrow translated the remains in 1083 when the Benedictine priory was founded in Durham. Medieval sources St Ailred of Rievaulx, Alfred's great-grandson, is one source for his life Alfred's history is relatively well attested, being documented in manuscripts including:Kendall 1984, pp. 8, 11–12, 14–16Crook 2011, pp. 98–102 *An Account of the Early Provosts of Hexham (c. 1100); *the Libellus de exordio (1104–15) of Symeon of Durham; *a section of the multiply authored Historia Regum (1113–64), possibly contributed by someone from Hexham; *the anonymous \\"Miracle 18\\" narrative in Capitula de Miraculis et Translationibus Sancti Cuthberti (after 1128); *the History of the Church of Hexham (1154–c.1160) by Prior Richard of Hexham; *On the Saints of Hexham (1154–67) by Ailred of Rievaulx; *The Life of St Eata (12th century), an anonymous compilation covering the Hexham saints; *the Libellus de admirandis beati Cuthberti virtutibus quae novellis patratae sunt temporibus (c. 1150–75) of Reginald of Durham. Although few if any of these writers could have been eye-witnesses to his acts, Symeon's narrative is in part based on the testimony of a monk named as Gamel, possibly one of Alfred's priestly deputies; Richard was acquainted with the second Eilaf, his grandson; and Reginald claims that at least some of his additions were sourced to Ailred and recounted traditions handed down within the family. Kendall considers that the early Hexham accounts are likely to be independent from Symeon's account, unlike Reginald's significantly later narrative.Kendall 1984, pp. 11–12, 14–16 See alsoDurham, a poem extolling Durham's relic collection *St Cuthbert's coffin Notes and references = Citations = = Sources =       11th-century English clergy People from Durham, England People from Hexham Christian relics Bede Collectors ","title":"Alfred Westou"},{"id":"59988844","text":"Joseph Stalin's tunic on display at his bunker in Izmaylovo District, Moscow.

Dean Subotich was the son of the well-known Serbian poet Jovan Subotić. Serbian-Turkish War Dean Ivanovich Subotich was born in Vienna, Austrian Empire on 7 May 1852. He graduated from high school in Austria, and in 1867 joined the Russian military service in St. Petersburg. There he was educated at the Second Konstantinovsky Military Academy where he received the rank of second lieutenant and appointed to the guards. From 1871 to 1874 he was enrolled at the prestigious His Imperial Majesty Nicholas General Staff Academy and the Naval Cadet Corps. Upon graduation, he was sent to the artillery brigade of the Caucasian Grenadier Division of Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolayevich and promoted to lieutenant on 13 April 1875. The following year he went to warring Serbia, to the headquarters of the Timok- Moravian army under the command of General Mikhail Chernyayev. According to Russian sources, he participated in a series of battles against the Turks, and on 5 February 1877, he was promoted to the rank of captain. In early spring of 1877, Subotich was re-enlisted in the Kiev Military District. Then, in September 1885, he became Chief of Staff of the 15th Infantry Division in Odessa, and from 6 March 1889 to 11 January 1893, he was again on duty in the Caucasian Grenadier Division in Tbilisi. Russian Far East In March 1894, after being promoted to the rank of Major General, Subotich was sent to the Russian Far East where he succeeded Paul Simon Unterberger as the military administrator of the Primorskaya Oblast on 27 May 1897. From 1897 to 1898 he was on duty as a military governor of the Primorsky Krai, and Ataman of the Ussuri Cossack Host. It was at the same time when his countryman, the chief engineer of Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) construction, Aleksandr Iosifovich Iugovich prepared the groundbreaking ceremonies for the CER to take place. Colonel (later Major General) Dmitry Horvat who would succeed Iugovich in 1903, was present in the capacity as head of administration of the Ussuri railway system. The highlight of the event was when ataman Dean Subotich of the Ussuri Cossacks unfurled the CER flag, a symbol of Russian and Chinese partnership and cooperation before 80 foreign delegates who had arrived specifically for the occasion. Later, Subotich was sent to the city of Dalian to replace commander Oskar Starck on 18 September 1898 to July 1899 as military governor of Transcaspian Oblast. Then, on 12 August 1900, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General. A year before Subotich's last promotion, a Boxer Rebellion broke out in China. Dissatisfied with foreign influences in China, rebels had launched a series of attacks on aliens. In Beijing and other cities, a large number of Russians and Chinese people who were converted to Christianity were killed in a most despicable way. Among them were 222 Orthodox Chinese, which the Russian Orthodox Church later, had them canonized as new martyrs. The so-called Boxers meanwhile attacked the Chinese eastern railway in Manchuria, the Chinese province of Heilongjiang. A significant part of the railway infrastructure, which Russia built, was destroyed or damaged, and there were also human losses. Unlike other parts of China, Boxers were targeting their attacks only on Russians in Manchuria. Russia intervened and regained control of Mukden (today Shenyang) and other parts of Manchuria. Russian intervention in Manchuria was one of the causes of the subsequent Russian-Japanese war. At that time, Dean Subotich was engaged in defending the Russian eastern coast of unrest caused by the Boxing Rebellion and the pacification of Manchuria. He participates in the Chinese campaign as Assistant Commander of the area of Kwangtung Province and commander of the Southern Mandarin Detachment. Subotich commanded the Mukden Operation that returned the city under Russian control. In the middle of August, he took command over the Southern Manchuria Column, reinforced to 9000 troops with 40 guns. On 11 September he set off towards Mukden in three columns: General Fleischer on the left, General Artamonov in the center, and Colonel Mishchenko on the right. The Chinese forces were deployed in two groups: 6000 at Niu Chzhuang and 16,000 at Aisyandzan. Also on the 11th the energetic General Fleischer defeated the first of the Chinese concentrations and took Niu Chzhuang. On the next day, the 12th, the Chinese fled from their Aisyandzan position. On 15 September General Subotich with just his artillery crushed and scattered Chinese bands at Lyaoyan and on the 17th occupied Mukden without any fighting. The whole of Manchuria was pacified by 20 September and this ended the Chinese campaign. Russian Turkestan Coat of arms of Subotich family After the Chinese campaign, Subotich served in Turkestan until 1902, where he commanded the 2nd Turkestan Army Corps and was the head of the Zasavje region. During 1902 and 1903 he was the general governor of the Amur Oblast (Priamur region), the commander of the Priamur military district and the commanding officer of the island's horsemen. At the same time, in 1903, he became a member of the Military Council of the Ministry of the Army. During this time the Russian Imperial Geographical Society petitioned Subotich to allow Bronislaw Pilsudski to participate in Waclaw Sieroszewski's expedition to the island of Hokkaido to study the language of the Äynu people and their folklore for four months. The petition got his support and that of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. In October 1903, Subotich wrote to Army Minister Aleksey Kuropatkin that Russia should exploit Vladivostok, not the city of Dalian, as suggested by Sergei Witte. His reasons were sound because he knew the geopolitical volatility of the region, not to mention the economic implications of the time. Subotich read Spiridon Dionisovich Merkulov's book (\\"The Possible Fate of Russian Trade in the Far East\\") which showed that \\"profits from the tea trade from China to European Russia via Vladivostok had fallen after the construction of the CER (Chinese Eastern Railway).\\" Two years later, Subotich commanded the Turkestan Military District, replacing the Governor-General Nikolay N. Teviashov (who died in 1905), and was the commanding officer of the Cossack army there. In 1906 Subotich and his assistant General Vladimir Viktorovich Sakharov were forced to resign on charges of being supporters of liberalism. Subotich's successor was General Nikolay I. Grodekov. In 1918, Subotich became the Honorary Consul of the Kingdom of Serbia in Yalta. He died in Zagreb, Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1920.

A sequel under the name of Ai no Kotodama: Sekai no Hate Made, with new plot and cast, was released on August 7, 2010. The film focuses on a young gay couple while they struggle with jealousy and insecurities. Plot Shinya Otani and Miyako Tachibana have been inseparable since high school. Now college students, both live together in a small rented apartment in the city while keeping their relationship as a secret, in order to avoid unnecessary complications. However, their happy life begins to fall apart after they meet Yukiko Mizusawa, an old friend from high school. While Tachibana welcomes her with open arms, Otani is not as excited as he is, mainly because at school there used to be rumors that Tachibana and Mizusawa were dating. As time goes by, Otani can not help feeling more and more jealous of Mizusawa, especially after realizing how perfect she was and believing that she was in love with Tachibana. His jealousy only gets stronger when she gives Tachibana a perfume for his birthday called \\"Jealousy\\", which turns out to be the same one that she uses. Otani becomes hostile and unfriendly, even beginning to doubt about the feelings of his lover for him and treating him coldly. This situation continues until, due to a series of misunderstandings after another, both argue and decide to separate for a while. Otani refuges in the apartment of Shougo Sunochi, a college friend who deals with a long-distance relationship with a young American boy named Alfred. Tachibana, meanwhile, tries to fix the things between them and sends Otani a text message citing him to talk, but he does not see it as his cell phone stops working after getting wet. Believing that Otani had ignored him, Tachibana begins to fall into depression. Mizusawa, aware that something bad was happening between the two, finds the courage to confess to Otani that it was really him and not Tachibana who had always been in love with, only to come to the shocking realization that Otani and Tachibana were in fact, a couple. After clarifying things, Otani and Tachibana make up again. Otani, feeling sorry for his behavior, invites Mizusawa to throw fireworks with them at their university, where Mizusawa concludes that her feelings for Otani would never be reciprocated, but that was okay because she had always enjoyed seeing them together. The film ends with Otani and Tachibana being a happy couple again and enjoying their company, with Otani hoping that one day his words of devotion, having so much power, will reach Tachibana.

The Augsburg Book of Miracles (also known simply as The Book of Miracles) is an illustrated manuscript made in Augsburg in Germany in the 16th century. History Based on watermarks on some of the pages, the frequency with which events in Augsburg and its environs appear and the naming of Augsburg artist and printmaker Hans Burgkmair within it, it has been concluded that the manuscript was most likely produced in Augsburg. The identities of the creators of the manuscript, and the person or persons for whom it was produced, remain something of a mystery. The name of the Augsburg artist and printmaker Hans Burgkmair appears on one page of the manuscript. Till-Holger Borchert, an expert in German Medieval art, suggests that, as Burgkmair the Elder died in the 1530s, the artist in question here must be his son, Hans Burgkmair the Younger, who is much less well attested by known works. In addition, at least two of the images appear to be based on drawings from the workshop of Burgkmair the Younger, leading Borchert to conclude that he was a contributor to the manuscript, possibly in conjunction with Heinrich Vogtherr the Elder and/or Heinrich Vogtherr the Younger. The manuscript itself was probably produced between 1545 and 1552 (some of the text is lifted from the Luther Bible of 1545; the final image before those from the New Testament Book of Revelation features a hailstorm on the town of Dordrecht in the Netherlands which occurred in 1552). The leaves were rebound in the nineteenth century. Some are missing, with only one or two recently re-identified. The manuscript is now in the collection of art collector Mickey Cartin. Manuscript The manuscript consists of 123 surviving folios with 23 inserts. Each page is illuminated in full colour in gouache and watercolour. Each illumination is captioned in German Gothic script. In general respects the images follow contemporary manuscripts, in particular Conrad Lycosthenes's Chronicle of Prodigies and Portents (1557) and the Histoires Prodigieuses by Pierre Boaistuau (1560), and designs by contemporary painters and printmakers, including Hans Sebald Beham, Hans Holbein the Younger, Lucas Cranach the Elder and Albrecht Dürer. The captions describe and/or comment on the images and, where appropriate, cite Biblical sources (from the Luther Bible of 1545) or the place and date of the event depicted. =Contents= The manuscript has no introduction, title page, list of contents or dedication that would be usual for the time. Instead it launches straight into its sequence of illustrations and commentary. It is written in rough chronological order, from the Old Testament through various phenomena and portents from Antiquity up to the time of production and finishing with the Book of Revelation. Old Testament The first section of the book, covering Folios 1 to 15, begins with miracles indicative of God's will before switching to events from the history of the Jews as described in the Old Testament. Subjects covered range from the Flood (Folio 1) to the vision of Ezekiel (Folio 15). File:Augsburger_Wunderzeichenbuch,_Folio_1.jpgFolio 1.

A grpE mutant of Escherichia coli is more resistant to heat than the wild-type. J Gen Microbiol. 1990;136(5):797-801. doi:10.1099/00221287-136-5-797 It is a heat-inducible protein and during stress it prevents unfolded proteins from accumulating in the cytoplasm. Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the cytoplasm can lead to cell death.  Discovery  GrpE is a nucleotide exchange factor that was first discovered by researchers in 1977 as a protein necessary to propagate bacteriophage λ, a virus that infects bacteria by highjacking the bacteria's own replication machinery, in Escherichia coli. By using a genetic screen, researchers knocked out certain genes in E. coli and then tested whether the bacteria was able to replicate, GrpE was found to be crucial to propagation. Since that time, GrpE has been identified in all bacteria and in archea where DnaK and DnaJ are present. The crystal structure of GrpE was determined in 1997 at 2.8 Angstrom and identified GrpE as a homodimer that binds DnaK, a heat-shock protein involved in de novo protein folding. GrpE's structure determination was important because it demonstrated the interaction of nucleotide exchange factors at the nucleotide binding domain of DnaK.  Structure  = Functional domains = The GrpE homodimer has three distinct domains: * N-terminal disordered regions — Amino acids 1-33 in the N-terminal domain can compete for binding to the substrate binding cleft of DnaK. Amino acids 34-39 have not been visualized because they are either too disordered or too unstructured to be crystallized. * α-helices — There are four α-helices, two short and two long, these are stalk-like and parallel to each other. These helices come together to form a helical bundle however, there is no superhelical twisting due to the heptad-hendecad (7-11-7-11) spacing of hydrophobic residues in these helices. Portions of this helical bundle are able to bind to Domain IIB of DnaK. These helices also act as thermosensors. * C-terminal β-sheets — There are two compact β-sheets which stick out from the helices like arms. The β-sheet proximal to DnaK interacts with its ATP binding cleft directly by inserting itself into the cleft and causing a conformational shift in Domain IIB causing the release of ADP. The distal β-sheet does not interact with DnaK. = Binding induces a conformational change = Binding of GrpE's proximal β-sheet to Domain IIB of DnaK causes a 14° outward rotation of the nucleotide binding cleft, disrupting the binding of three side chains to the adenine and ribose rings of the nucleotide. This conformational change shifts DnaK from a closed to an open conformation and allows the release of ADP from the binding cleft.  Function  = Nucleotide exchange factor = Nucleotide exchange factors are proteins that catalyze the release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to facilitate binding of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP has three phosphate groups and the removal of one of the phosphate groups releases energy which is used to fuel a reaction. This removal of a phosphate group reduces ATP to ADP. GrpE is a nucleotide exchange factor that causes the release of bound ADP from DnaK, a heat shock protein important in de novo protein folding. DnaK, in its open conformation, binds ATP with low affinity and has a fast exchange rate for unfolded proteins. Once DnaJ, a co- chaperone, brings an unfolded protein to DnaK ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP to facilitate folding of the protein. At this point, the DnaK•ADP complex is in a stable conformation and requires GrpE to bind DnaK, change its conformation, and release ADP from the N-terminal ATPase domain of DnaK. Once ADP is released from the cycle is able to continue.alt=  Kinetics  The interaction between GrpE and the nucleotide binding cleft of DnaK is strong with a Kd between 1 nM (assessed during active conformation using transient kinetics) and a Kd of 30 nM (based on inactive conformation through surface plasmon resonance). This low dissociation constant indicates that GrpE readily binds to DnaK. Binding of GrpE to DnaK•ADP greatly reduces the affinity of ADP for DnaK by 200-fold and accelerates the rate of nucleotide release by 5000-fold. This process facilitates the de novo folding of unfolded protein by DnaK. = Protein Folding = GrpE also has an important role in substrate release from DnaK. The disordered N-terminal region of GrpE competes for binding to DnaK's substrate binding cleft. Researchers mutated GrpE to identify the function of its structural domains. Mutated GrpE, without its disordered N-terminal domain, is still able to bind to DnaK's nucleotide binding cleft and induce a conformational change however, the substrate will not be released. = Thermosensor = GrpE is a nucleotide exchange factor for DnaK, a heat shock protein, its activity is downregulated with increasing temperature. In biology, reversible unfolding of α-helices begins at 35 °C with a midpoint Tm of 50 °C, this unfolding affects the structural integrity of GrpE and prevents binding of GrpE to the nucleotide binding cleft of DnaK This has an important physiological role to limit the substrate cycling and subsequent ATP expenditure during heat stress. The thermal regulation of DnaK slows protein folding and prevents unfolded proteins from accumulating in the cytoplasm at high temperatures. = Bacteriophage λ replication = GrpE was first identified for its role in phage λ replication. GrpE that has been mutated so that it is nonfunctional prevents phage λ replication in vivo and greatly decreases replication in vitro. In vitro overexpression of DnaK can recover phage λ replication without GrpE. GrpE's pivotal role in phage λ replication is at the origin of replication, after assembly of DnaB and other replication factors, GrpE facilitates bidirectional DNA unwinding through interaction with DnaK.  Regulation  = Transcription = In the archeas' genome, the gene for GrpE is located upstream of the gene for DnaK which, is upstream of the gene for DnaJ. Out of these three proteins, only the promoter region of GrpE has a complete TATA binding box and upstream heat-responsive binding site. This suggests that, in Archea, these three genes are transcribed at the same time. In E. coli, GrpE's transcription is regulated by binding of the heat-shock specific subunit of RNA polymerase, σ32. Under physiological conditions, σ32 is kept at low levels through inactivation by interacting with DnaK and DnaJ, then subsequent degradation by proteases. However, during heat shock these proteins are unable to interact with σ32 and target it for degradation. Therefore, during heat shock, σ32 binds to the promoter region of heat shock proteins and causes rapid induction of these genes.  Other biological systems  = Eukaryote homologues = In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the GrpE homologue, Mge1, is found in mitochondria. Mge1 is a nucleotide exchange factor important for shuttling proteins across mitochondrial membranes and in protein folding, it interacts with a yeast homologue of DnaK. Mge1 has a similar role as a thermosensor. Yeast have additional GrpE homologues including Sil1p and Fes1p. In humans, mitochondrial organelles have GrpE-like 1 (GRPEL1) protein. In eukaryotic cells, there any many additional eukaryotic GrpE homologues. Members of the BAG family specifically, BAG1 are the main nucleotide exchange factors for heat shock protein 70kDa (Hsp70), which is the eukaryotic equivalent of DnaK. Other nucleotide exchange factors that interact with heat-shock proteins in eukaryotes include, Sse1p, Sil1p, Hip, and HspBP1. These eukaryotic nucleotide exchange factors are all heat-shock inducible meaning that they serve a similar function as GrpE, to protect the cell from unfolded protein aggregation. These nucleotide exchange factors always interact with subdomain IIB of the nucleotide binding cleft of their respective heat-shock proteins. The binding of the nucleotide exchange factor to a nucleotide binding cleft and the shift to an open conformation is conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. = Plant homologues = In plants, GrpE homologues, CGE1 and CGE2, are found in chloroplasts. CGE1 has two splice isoforms that differ in 6 amino acids in the N-terminal, with isoform CGE1b being 6 nucleotides longer than CGE1a. This N-terminal domain is important in substrate release through competitive binding to the heat-shock protein. All of these plant nucleotide exchange factors interact directly with the cpHsc70, the plant homologue of DnaK. They are heat-inducible however, at 43 °C, they are not as effective as GrpE at protecting the cell from unfolded protein accumulation.  Role in disease  = Bacterial pathogenesis = Enterococci are bacteria that are commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of animals, including humans. These bacteria can form a biofilm, which is a layer of bacteria attached to a surface. Enterococcal biofilm is prevalent in hospital and surgical settings, it is responsible for 25% of catheter-related infections, is found in 50% of root-filled teeth with apical periodontitis, and can be isolated from other wounds. GrpE is found in the genome of Enterococcus faecilis and Enterococcus faecium and is critical for enterococcal biofilm attachment to polystyrene tubes, a plastic polymer commonly used in hospital settings. Group A Streptococcus pyogenes is a bacteria that can lead to common infections, including strep throat and impetigo, but is also responsible for life- threatening infections. During infection, GrpE helps streptococcus bacteria adhere to pharyngeal epithelial cells. GrpE in Streptococcus binds to endogenous proline-rich proteins in saliva, allowing adhesion of the bacteria to the host.

Thus he contested the 1974 All- Ireland Senior Football Championship, when Donegal fell to Galway at the semi- final stage. He was still a minor in 1974 and played both the Ulster MFC and SFC semi-finals on the same day. Then, the fall. McGettigan later reminisced upon the event; having travelled north for a Dr McKenna Cup final against Fermanagh, \\"the guy that brought me up had never been where the match was being played. He took a wrong turn and the teams were going out on the field. I was told that I wouldn't start in the circumstances, but to go in to tog out, I'd be on the bench\\". Towards the end, full back Pauric McShea insisted McGettigan be brought on. \\"As it turned out we lost the game by a point, but I was told leaving after the Fermanagh game that I would be in the Championship team in two weeks time against Derry in Ballybofey. When the team was picked I was dropped off the team and the panel for disciplinary reasons, circumstances for which I was never told what had happened… I vowed at that time I would never play with Donegal again, I played with Galway in the Connacht Final the following year\\". The incident caused a media furore. McGettigan vowed never to wear the Donegal jersey again. Having moved to live and work in Galway, McGettigan took up inter-county football with that county in 1978, and was part of a side that contested a Connacht final in his first year there (Roscommon won that contest). McGettigan, however, reversed his earlier decision and returned to play for Donegal in 1983 – just in time to win a second Ulster Senior Football Championship medal. McGettigan's return was pivotal; he partnered under-21 player Anthony Molloy at centrefield in the Ulster final, which meant Michael Lafferty could revert to his normal centre- back and Martin Griffin to his normal full-back position. Again though, Donegal met Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final and, again, Galway secured a win. =Provincial= McGettigan played for Ulster in the Railway Cup at a time when he was the only Donegal inclusion on that team. Coaching McGettigan led Corofin to their first All-Ireland club title in 1998. He had previously coached the club's minor team but took over as senior manager in 1997, following many of the players he had coached as young men, and on the proviso that Tony Murphy would be joint manager.

The bar opened in 1933, when Frank Sr and Victoria DeSantis converted their basement and added an exterior staircase to access it from outside of their Conkling Street row house. The 3-story mansion above the bar was originally built in 1920 for William Schluderberg of C., a member of the William Schluderberg & Son meat packing family, and now houses a local and organic farmers market store. History Established in 1933, just after the repeal of prohibition, a portrait of then-president Franklin Delano Roosevelt behind the bar continues to pay tribute to Venice's founding history. Venice was established by Italian immigrants Frank and Mary Victoria DeSantis Sr., and while Mary hailed from Naples in Southern Italy, her love of Venice gave the bar its name. At the time of the bar's founding, Highlandtown was home to working-class Polish, German and Italian families, and the simple, affordable (at 15 cents) beer offerings reflected the tastes of the neighborhood. Venice was run by the husband-wife duo for three decades. Frank Sr. died in 1962, and Mary ran the bar herself until her own death in 1967, after which control passed to their two sons, Frank Jr. and Vince DeSantis. Frank DeSantis Jr. turned the bar over to his son Dominic DeSantis in 2006. While not changing the aesthetic character of the bar, Dominic acknowledged shifts in the composition of the neighborhood and tastes, introducing various craft beers to the taps at Venice, but keeping the low prices which had made it locally notable. In recent years, Venice has participated in various tap takeovers and regional craft brewery features. It has also been a featured stop on annual walking tours during Baltimore Beer Week. The success of Venice eventually allowed the DeSantis family to expand bar or restaurant operations to Little Italy (Dego Dames), Canton (Hudson Street Stackhouse) and Perry Hall (DeSantis Pizza Grill & Bar). Accolades Despite its small size, Venice has received frequent write ups and recommendations in local, regional and national publications as a surviving example of the archetypal Baltimore corner bar. Baltimore City Paper dubbed Venice the \\"Craft Beer Underground,\\" due to the combination of its low prices and trendier craft beers. They also named it their \\"Best Dive Bar\\" in both their 2011 & 2017 Best of Baltimore lists. Tasting Table listed it nationally as one of \\"The Best Dive Bars in the U.S.\\" in 2017. The budget price of its taps remains one of Venice's most notable aspects, often in contrast to bars in neighboring Canton, Brewers Hill and Fell's Point, with Highlandtown Main Street claiming it \\"offers, very possibly, the most inexpensive craft beer in the state.\\" In opposition to what he saw as a rising trend of $6 beers, City Paper's Baynard Woods described Venice as \\"the bulwark against the brave new world where we are all willing to pay too much to get our buzz on just because.\\" Visitors and reviewers frequently comment on Venice's decor, which consists largely of dozens of boxing promotion posters and photographs from decades past, reflecting a time when boxing was a much more popular sport. Former co-owner Vince DeSantis was himself Highlandtown lightweight boxing champion in 1931, and maintains a listing in the Maryland Boxing Hall of Fame. In a period of Baltimore's history where historic corner bars are frequently closing, Venice has drawn comment in spite of rapid and multiple demographic changes in the surrounding Highlandtown neighborhood, for remaining a fixture of the community and adapting to accommodate people of a variety of origins.

Biography =Early years= Eustakio Mendizabal was born on 9 October, 1944, in the small village of Itsasondo, Gipuzkoa. At age 10, he was sent to a Benedictine monastery in Lazkao, where he remained for 12 years until leaving the order in 1966. =Career in ETA= Txikia was the right-hand man of Juan Jose Etxabe, the leader of ETA's Military Front during the 1960s. After an organizational assembly in September 1970 concluded with ETA officially branding itself as Marxist-Leninist, the Military Front of ETA refused to accept the policy changes, forming a splinter group called ETA-V (while the Marxist-Leninist ETA would become known as ETA-VI). ETA-VI initially enjoyed substantially more popular support, and in 1971 the dispirited Juan Jose Etxabe stepped down as leader of ETA-V to retire from armed struggle. With Etxabe gone, Eustakio 'Txikia' Mendizabal took charge of ETA-V. Mendizabal placed emphasis on action above theory, and was committed to armed insurrection in the Basque Country. Under his leadership, ETA-V began a campaign of bank robberies throughout 1971 and 1972 to fund its activities, and stole over 3000 kilograms of Goma-2 explosives from a powder magazine. While not as left-leaning as their counterparts in ETA-VI, ETA-V did intervene in two high-profile labour disputes. They kidnapped Basque industrialist Lorenzo Zabala in 1972, successfully forcing him to hire back some 200 workers he had laid off. In 1973, they kidnapped wealthy business owner Felipe Huarte, whom they likewise demanded to rehire laid-off workers, and this time received a considerable ransom payment (50 million pesetas). During the leadership of Txikia, an ETA commando was sent to Madrid to begin planning a kidnapping operation of Francisco Franco's heir apparent, Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco. =Death and legacy= Eustakio Mendizabal was tracked down by the police and shot in the head in Algorta, Bizkaia in April 1973. The ETA commando in Madrid named itself Comando Txikia in honour of the much-admired ETA martyr. Contrary to popular belief, an operation against Luis Carrero Blanco was already being planned when Mendizabal died, and Comando Txikia was not created specifically to avenge his death. Ultimately, the commando assassinated Luis Carrero Blanco in December 1973, after his nomination as President of Spain made the original kidnapping plan unfeasible. A song was written about Txikia by Telesforo Monzón, called \\"Txikia zuen guda izena.\\" A plaza in Algorta was named 'Plaza Txikia' in honour of the slain ETA leader, but in 2017 the Superior Court of Justice in the Basque Country ruled that the name must be changed, because it 'violates the dignity of victims of terrorism'.

An Algol-type eclipsing binary, its apparent magnitude is constant at 8.58 for most of the time, sharply dropping to 9.35 during primary eclipse and to 8.89 during secondary eclipse. The system's variability was discovered by W. Strohmeier in 1972. From parallax measurements by the Gaia spacecraft, the system is located at a distance of from Earth, in agreement with earlier estimates based on its luminosity (173 ± 11 parsecs). The primary star is a K-type subgiant with a spectral type of K0IV and an effective temperature of 5,000 K, while the secondary is an F-type main sequence star with a spectral type of F7V and a temperature of 6,300 K. The primary component, while visually fainter, is slightly more luminous than the secondary due to its higher infrared output. The primary is at the end of its main sequence life and is likely in the short contraction phase known as a hook, where core hydrogen fusion has ceased but shell burning has not yet started, before ascending towards the red giant branch. Photometric and spectroscopic observations have allowed the direct determination of the parameters of the stars with extreme precision, and this system is frequently used to test stellar evolution models. The masses of the stars, 1.247 for the primary and 1.197 for the secondary, are known to a precision of just 0.3%, while the radii of 2.91 and 1.84 have uncertainties of 0.8% and 0.5% respectively. Stellar evolution models show the stars have a common age of about 4.4 billion years. The orbit of AI Phoenicis has a period of 24.59248 days and a moderate eccentricity of 0.1821 ± 0.0051. The observation of eclipses is allowed by its 88.5° inclination to the plane of the sky. Times of minimum light show the orbital period of the system is not constant, which can be caused by a third star in the system. An analysis of the alignment of the system by the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect suggests that the secondary star rotation axis is not aligned with the orbital axis, with an angle of 87 ± 17° between them, which also indicates interactions with a third star.

Ulzurrún y Somellera was governor Palacios's nephew-in-law.Félix Pubill.

Ponce, Puerto Rico: Tipografía José Picó Matos. 1900. p. 27. Mayoral term Ulzurrún y Somellera is remembered for his fiscal accountability. Upon taking on the mayoral post, he soon realized the precarious state of the municipal bank accounts and that accounting books were not being properly kept. Suspecting money was being wasted, he instituted a safe box with three keys, and placed the box in his office. He handed out a key to the Municipal accountant and one to the Municipal depository and he kept the third key. He then required that money collected be place in the box on a daily basis, together will all associated receipts and accounting logs. Noting there continued to be a short in the funds, he demanded the difference from the Depositary in 24 hours or face a judge. Unable to provide the missing money, the Depositary left the country, and the Court subsequently found him guilty in absentia and ordered his arrest. Ulzurrún y Somellera then requested from the governor the forming of a commission that would review the earnings and expenditures of the municipality in the previous various years. The commission found there had been embezzlement of municipal funds and the Accountant also left the country. Having no one to perform the Accountant's and Depositary functions, municipal councilmen Luis Gautier and Juan Seix filled the posts on an interim basis. Unfortunately, Ulzurrún y Somellera mayored the municipality during the era of the Componte, a time during which Puerto Rican Autonomistas suffered political persecution. This resulted in mayor Ulzurrún y Somellera siding with his uncle-in-law which often meant abandoning some of his best practices regarding personal integrity. One such componte abuse was committed by the local law enforcement authorities against the highly regarded liberal journalist Francisco Cepeda, in the mayor's own office while the mayor watched the beating. Despite the public outcry for the event, as well as the order of disapproval by the Municipal Assembly, Ulzurrún y Somellera was not relieved of his mayoral position until his uncle-in-law's governorship had concluded at which point Palacios's componte practice also ended.Félix Pubill.

The disaster is regarded as one of the deadliest maritime disaster in Southeast Sulawesi. It was also the second deadliest maritime disaster in Indonesia in 2007, after the MV Levina 1 disaster off the coast of Jakarta, which killed more than 50 people. Investigation conducted by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee concluded that the main cause of the accident was due to the improper loading of the passengers and crews. During its docking to Baubau, one side of the ferry was overly crowded with passengers who were searching for phone signals, causing it to capsize. Incident Mv Acita 03 departed Tomia Island Harbor on 10:30 a.m local time. Harbor officials in Tomia Island, Wakatobi Regency had not calculated the ferry's draft, even though it was mandatory. Prior to its departure, the Captain had signed a sailing declaration, declaring that the ferry was only carrying as many as 60 passengers and cargo weighing at least 15 tonnes. The weather condition was in good condition, with high waves reportedly not present. Visibility was also reported to be good. The ferry was expected to arrive in Baubau at 18:30-20:30 p.m local time. It was mudik season at the time, so the ferry was more crowded than usual. At 21:00 local time, MV Acita 03 arrived at Masir Strait. At the time, the ferry was only 4 nautical miles off its destination, Jembatan Batu Harbor, which was located on Lakeba Beach. Lakeba Beach was able to be seen, located on the starboard of the ferry. The passengers then began to prepare to disembark from the ferry. They then began to search for phone signals to inform their relatives or friends to pick them up at the harbor. On the second deck, a passenger suddenly shouted that it had found signals on the ferry. This further attracted the other passengers to search for phone signals. Passengers began to move to the ferry's starboard. Some even climbed onto the roof of the ferry. Due to this, the ferry started to list. Crew members who were aware about the situation began to shout to the passengers on the imminent danger and ordered the passengers to stop. This was not listened by the passengers, who continued to search for phone signals. The ferry then immediately capsized to its starboard, dropping dozens of passengers to the sea. The Captain immediately put the engines on neutral condition. 10 minutes later, the ferry had fully capsized. Some passengers were still trapped inside the ferry. On the next 10 minutes, the ferry managed to self-right itself. The capsizing happened so quickly that not a single passenger was able to wear a life-jacket. Search and rescue Local fishermen immediately rushed to the site of the accident. At 23:00 local time, a joint search and rescue team, consisted of members of Kendari search and rescue team, members from the Baubau search and rescue team, the Indonesian Navy, local police and Indonesian Sea and Coast Guard, was assembled to search the victims of the disaster and to rescue the survivors. At least 3 ships were deployed to the site. Rescuers managed to immediately save 61 people. 15 bodies were also recovered from the site and 30 people were listed as missing. On the early morning of 19 October, officials announced that 125 passengers and crews had been evacuated from the site. Divers were deployed to search for the missing. A search area with a radius of 7 miles from the location of the disaster was made. The death toll later rose to 20 as more bodies were recovered. The search area was widened by officials, reaching as far as the Banda Sea. On 25 October, a week after the disaster, the search and rescue operation was stopped. 9 passengers were still missing and were presumed dead. The final death toll was 31 people, consisted of 30 passengers, of whom 11 of them were children, and 1 crew. Investigation MV Acita 03 was a type of wooden ferry with a V-shaped hull. Statements collected from the operator of the ferry revealed that they had chosen this type of hull due to its efficiency. Calculations made by investigators showed that the V-shaped hull was faster than the typical wide U-shaped hull, thus saving more money. However, they also noted that due to the slim shape of the hull, the vessel was not as stable as the U-shaped hull. Initially, the second deck was not intended as a passenger area. The decision to modify the deck into a passenger area was due to high demands in the region. As many of the people in the area were poor, most of them couldn't afford to board ferries with stricter safety rules. According to investigators, the main cause of the accident however, was due to the poor discipline of the passengers. The massive movement of passengers to the starboard side of the ferry caused the ferry to lose its stability.

It has since 1803 been owned by members of the de Neergaard family. The three- winged, Baroque-style main building was built for Carl Adolph von Plessen in 1726. It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1827. Nearby Førslev Church belonged to Gørslevgaard from 1544 to 1914. A number of former owners from the influential Beck family, who owned the manor from 1495 to 1659, are buried in the church. History =Early history= Drawing of Joachim Beck's grave in Førslev Church Førslevgaard takes its name after the village of Førslev where it was located. It is first mentioned in 1347 when it was acquired by Jep Andersen Halvegge. He was succeeded by his son, Evert Jepsen Halvegge, whose daughter and only heir married Peder Mogensen. Sivert Beck Peder Mogensen's daughter, Margrethe, brought Gørslevgaard into her marriage with Lasse Beck. Their son, Joachim Beck. expanded the estate with more land and tenant farms. In 1544, the estate was granted the status of birk. It remained in the hands of the Beck family for 150 years. It passed out of the family when Lauge Beck's widow, Margrethe Grubbe, married Steen Hohendorff and he bought out Beck's other heirs. Hohendorffs sold Førslevgaard to Hans Bøfke in 1685. He placed more land directly under the manor by dissolving five tenant fames. The estate then changed hands several times over the next centuries. None of the owners lived on the estate and the buildings gradually fell into neglect. =The Plessen family= Carl Adolph von Plessen In 1723, Førslevgaard was acquired by Carl Adolph von Plessen. He constructed a new main building, purchased more land and dissolved the remaining eight tenant farms in the village of Førslev. Carl Adolph von Plessen was the owner of seven estates at the time of his death. He had never marriage and therefore established a fideikommis under the name \\"De Plessiske Fidei-Commis-Godser\\" and left it to his brother's sons and their sons. A dispute arose over the distribution of the inheritance and a final settlement was not reached until 1778. The result was that Førslevgaard, Fuglebjergggard and Fodbygaard went to Christian Frederik von Plessen. His mother was entitled to three rooms at Førslevgaard as well as a pension for her maintenance. In 1789, he ceded Hørslevgaard and the other estates to his brother, Carl Adolph. He commenced the implementation of the agricultural reform programme of the time, for instance by discontinuing corvée (Danish: Hoveri) on his estates and by granting the copyholders a right to pass their farms on to their children (Spanish: Arvefæste). =The de Neergaard family= In 1802, Det Plessenske Fideicommis was converted into capital. This enabled Carl Adolph von Plessen to sell Førslevgaard to Peter Johansen Neergaard the following year. Today The current owner is Johan Nicolaj Flach de Neergaard.

Although an early source of this technology, which worked with phone cameras (and not needing additional hardware), opened in 2003 and closed in 2011, others in this space are still, several years later, using the words \\"one of the first.\\" Contactless fingerprint technology is the third generation: Wet- ink was followed by an option for \\"optics-based ... light reflected from the tops of fingerprints on a plate.\\" As of 2017, \\"face recognition technologies on the whole are in general less accurate than fingerprinting.\\" Aging, variations in pose and problems with illumination have caused the former to have \\"higher error rates.\\" History The use of lasers to detect fingerprints already existed in the 1980s, but this was limited to matching objects to fingerprints on file. USA Public/Private Contactless study A 30-page white paper titled \\"Risks and Opportunities of Contactless Biometrics\\" identified \\"spoofing as a serious limitation, and ranks what people know (password, challenge question) and what they have (keycard, identify \\"token\\") higher than biometrics. Although it ranks facial recognition and iris recognition ahead of contactless fingerprint identification, it is the fingerprint that ranks highest of the three for high-security situations. The whitepaper noted that the Canadian Border Services Agency was planning to utilize a combination of facial recognition and fingerprints. One such experiment used an assist: using flight manifests to compare faces with passport photos of those listed. A pending court case defined failures of even 1% to be \\"high risk\\" if it results in denials of government benefits.government statistics showed 92-95% accuracy USA DOJ report A 56-page report titled \\"Contactless Fingerprint Technologies Assessment\\" was funded in 2010,USA federal award number 2010-IJ-CX-K024 and version 2 of the report was \\"made ... available\\" in 2014 online even though it \\"has not been published.\\" After describing 13 R&D; projects in various stages of incompleteness, it identifies four \\"contactless fingerprint existing products.\\" * The first company's product attaches to a PC via USB and \\"is designed for indoor use only.\\" * The second company is footnoted as a \\"closed business.\\" * The third product scans the person's fingerprints and then encodes them into a small object that the person can then present; verification takes \\"approximately two seconds.\\" The objective had been \\"to speed access through restricted, high traffic areas.\\" Also, unlike the first product, which could operate at a \\"distance of 2 meters\\" this one has \\"optimum focal length of approximately three inches from the camera.\\" Another limitiation is that only works with one finger per person.\\"tracks only a single fingerprint per individual.\\" * The fourth product is the most advanced of the group, and while it is not touchless, there is no contact with the scanner, just with an \\"optical scanning area.\\" A list of nine \\"contactless fingerprint technologies that are worth noting\\" is part of the report. Of the top three, the first closed in 2011. Next come a pair from an inventor with 2 entries; one had 800 employees worldwide when, for reasons of mismanagement, it went bankrupt and was absorbed by another firm. Applications Aside from border, airport and access control, contactless fingerprint technologies have provided benefits in: * Microfinance benefit to poor: India's Unbanked have difficulty with qualifying for government and United Nations microfinance services due to lack of acceptable documentation. With use of a software-only fingerprint scanner (on a phone carried by a UN or government worker), simple loans of \\"$100 .. buy .. seeds they need to plant more crops\\" were enabled, beginning in the 2000s. This technology has also been opened to rural areas that have many unbanked and underbanked residents. * Convenience: Paying for goods and services with a swipe of a finger on a biometric sensor * Mobil Phone security: Software downloaded to \\"nearly any mobile phone that has a camera\\" can authenticate fingerprints. Research A 2012 technology review of fingerprint identification with 95 citations only had three regarding contactless/touchless research. A 2017 NIST designed to see how effectively members of the public could use a contactless fingerprint device in a simulated airport situation found that about half of the participants could not successfully validate their fingerprints on their first try.

The purpose of the project is to collect and distribute genetic, species and ecosystem information relating to marine biodiversity in southern Africa, which may be used to support informed decision-making about the marine environment. Purpose The aim of the project is to collect and make available genetic, species and ecosystem information about Southern African marine biodiversity. This information is expected to be useful to support conservation planning to inform decisions regarding exploitation of marine resources. =DNA barcoding= There is a known deficit in marine and coastal biodiversity databases for most taxa in South Africa. SeaKeys is part of an effort to change this. A part of the project is to use DNA barcoding of common, invasive, commercially important, rare and endangered marine species to aid estimating species diversity and distributions. The barcodes are accessible through the Barcode of Life Database History The project public launch was held at the Iziko South Africa Museum on 18 March 2014. Management The SeaKeys project is managed though the South African National Biodiversity Institute marine programme under Dr Kerry Sink. Research partners         * Citizen science input The citizen science component is a major input for several new biodiversity atlas projects. There are species mapping subprojects which include a fish atlas, a sea slug atlas, an atlas for corals, seafans and anemones, one for jellyfish and an atlas for echinoderms. Citizen science input is largely by way of entering observations supported by an identifiable photograph of the observed organism, along with details of date, location, tentative identification and other information on any one of the web-based platforms associated with the project. The project uses three web-based platforms to collect marine species observations. SA Jellywatch i-Spot and EchinoMAP (using Google Earth maps or GPS co-ordinates) to create detailed distributions of South African marine species. Crowdsourced data is provided largely by recreational scuba divers and recreational angling clubs, but a large amount of data is also provided by professional scientists from field observations. A small percentage is sourced from historical photographs, mostly of fish. Platforms: *iSpot hosted by the Open University, and Echinomap at the University of Cape Town allow for uploading of photographs of marine organisms along with date and locality information. *SA Jellywatch at University of the Western Cape records public participation in tracking jellyfish distributions and abundance. *Most of the data on iSpot was later migrated to iNaturalist when iSpot was found to be unsuitable for the purpose.

Greenfields has 2 farms and a factory at hillside of Mount Kawi in Malang Regency and Blitar Regency. The company was founded on March 14, 1997. Greenfields is a popular milk brand in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Brunei, and the Philippines.  History  Aerial of Greenfields Factory In the early 1990s, Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, experienced very rapid economic development. As people's purchasing power increases, the need for a healthy lifestyle and high-quality food ingredients also increases. Unfortunately the need for this is mostly filled with imported products, one of which is milk using imported powdered milk. The problem of imported milk which is very much in Indonesia is the initial idea of the formation of PT Greenfields Indonesia. On March 14, 1997, PT Greenfields Indonesia was born to a group of Australian and Indonesian business people who had expertise in the field of agribusiness. The company began by developing farms in Babadan Village, Mount Kawi, East Java, a place with a cool temperature environment for special dairy cows imported from Australia. In April 1999 the construction of a milk processing facility began operating in June 2000. The milk produced by this farm is high quality milk and fulfills the world's strictest requirements in microbiology. PT Greenfields Indonesia produces pasteurized milk and UHT milk in several different types, flavors and packaging sizes. At present, Greenfields farms have more than 10,000 cattle with Holstein and Jersey species. In addition to serving the domestic market, more than 50% of the production of PT Greenfields Indonesia is marketed in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines and other countries in the region. Now Greenfields has grown from dairy companies to dairy companies that not only produce milk but other milk derivative products such as yogurt, cheese and whipping cream.  Products  Greenfields Fresh Milk (Pasteurization) available in sizes 200ml, 500ml, 1 liter and 1.89 liters with Fresh Milk flavors, Low Fat, Skimmed, Choco Malt, Strawberry and Moccachino. * Greenfields UHT available in 1 liter packaging for in home consumption and UHT small for on the go in packs of 125ml, 200ml and 250ml. * Greenfields Fresh Cheese available in shredded mozzarella and mozzarella block, bocconcini, ricotta, and camembert. * Greenfields Fresh Stirred Yogurt available blueberry, strawberry, mango and original flavors in sizes of 1 kg, 500g and 125g. * Greenfields Yogurt Drink available in mixed fruit, blueberry, mango, strawberry, peach and lychee flavors. * Greenfields Whipping cream available in 1 liter size.

In the 1950s, he participated in the development of the Shenyang JJ-1 trainer and was a chief designer of the Nanchang CJ-6 trainer. Starting in 1960, as chief designer of the Chengdu Aircraft Factory, he developed the fighter jets Shenyang J-5A, Chengdu JJ-5, and several variants of the J-7 fighter, including the Chengdu J-7M, then China's only warplane competitive in the world market. He was an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.  Early life and education  Tu Jida was born 11 December 1927 in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, Republic of China. When he was ten, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out and Shaoxing was bombed by Japanese warplanes. To seek refuge from the war, his mother brought him and his brother to live in the Shanghai International Settlement. This experience greatly influenced Tu's decision to become an aircraft designer. After the end of the war, he was admitted to the aeronautical engineering department of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1946.  Career  After graduating from university in 1951, Tu was assigned to work for the Harbin Aircraft Factory. In 1956, he was transferred to the Shenyang Aircraft Factory to help develop the Shenyang JJ-1 trainer, the first jet aircraft designed in China. Working under chief designer Xu Shunshou and deputy chief Huang Zhiqian, Tu was in charge of designing the fuselage. The plane took its first flight in July 1958, after only 21 months of development. Nanchang CJ-6A basic trainer In 1958, Tu Jida and Lin Jiahua were tasked with designing the Nanchang CJ-6 basic trainer at the Nanchang Aircraft Factory. It took their team only 72 days to build a working prototype. After further development, in the 1980s it became the first Chinese-designed aircraft to be mass produced, with more than 2,000 made. In 1960, Tu was transferred to Chengdu to work for the Chengdu Aircraft Factory, then still being established. He served as chief designer for the Shenyang J-5A, an improved version of the J-5 fighter. The J-5A took its maiden flight on 11 November 1964. It was the first plane built by Chengdu Aircraft. Based on the J-5A, Tu went on to design the jet trainer Chengdu JJ-5. The plane was in production for 20 years, with more than 1,000 manufactured in total. It was the main trainer used in Chinese aviation schools, and more than 15,000 pilots received their training in the aircraft. It was also exported to more than ten countries. A Bangladesh Air Force F-7MB fighter In 1969, Chengdu Aircraft took over the development of the J-7 fighter (also known as F-7) from Shenyang Aircraft, and Tu was again the chief designer. He developed the J-7I model in 1973, and then the J7-II with a greatly improved ejection seat system. In 1987, he developed the J-7M, which was exported to many countries. It was the only Chinese-made warplane that was competitive in the world market, and Tu was hailed as the \\"father of J-7\\" in official Chinese media. He was also a professor and doctoral advisor at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Tu was awarded the State Science and Technology Progress Award (First Class) in 1985. In 1995, he was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.  Personal life  Tu had a son, Tu Zhengxing (屠征星), and a daughter, Tu Zhengyin (屠征音). According to his children, he devoted most of his time to work and spent little time with his family. Tu worked at the Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group until the end of his life. In the Chinese New Year of 2011, he went to Shenzhen to spend the holiday with his family. He had a fall when in Shenzhen, and died on 16 February at the Shenzhen No. 6 People's Hospital, at the age of 83.

Life  The date of birth of Edward Loveden Loveden, whose birthname was Edward Loveden Townsend, is uncertain. He is variously stated to have been born in 1749, 1750 and 1751. His father was Thomas Townsend, from Cirencester in Gloucestershire, and his mother, Jane, was from Buscot, then in Berkshire. He attended Winchester College for three years up to 1765 and entered Trinity College, Oxford in 1767, by which time his father had died. He changed his name to Edward Loveden Loveden by royal license in 1772. The change was imposed on him by a relative – Edward Loveden, variously stated as his uncle or great-uncle – as a condition of their bequest to him of the manor at Buscot. He owned Buscot Park, near Faringdon in present-day Oxfordshire. Loveden entered the House of Commons from the Abingdon constituency in 1783 when he won a by-election caused by of the death of the sitting member, Henry Howorth. He sat then as an opponent of the Fox–North coalition and claimed to be a free agent, not tied to any political group. In the same year, he joined the Thames Navigation Commission, of which he became particularly active from 1789. Loveden retained his seat in the 1784 general election and, despite some local opposition based on his parsimonious tendencies, again in 1790. In 1793, he was aligned with the \\"third party\\" of William Windham. From that year, and coinciding with the end of his most active period as a Thames Commissioner, he became a member of the Board of Agriculture. Loveden was forced out of the Abingdon seat in 1796 and lost the contest for one of the two Berkshire seats at that year's election. Between 1802 and 1812, he served as MP for Shaftesbury. Loveden was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1805 and had served as High Sheriff of Berkshire during 1781–82 and as High Sheriff of Brecknockshire in 1799–1800. He was also a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Berkshire Militia, 1794–1796.  Family  Loveden was married three times, firstly in 1773 to Margaret, daughter of Lewis Pryse of Gogerddan, Cardiganshire, with whom he had a son and two daughters. Margaret died in 1784 and in the following year he married the widowed Elizabeth Nash, a daughter of the MP John Darker. Elizabeth died in 1788 and in 1794 Loveden married Anne, whose father was Thomas Lintall. Loveden separated from Anne in 1808, which resulted in a notable divorce case. 22 years younger than Loveden, it was alleged that she had begun an affair with a Mr Barker, a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, with Loveden's staff providing evidence to support the claim. Divorce in England at that time was a three-stage process and although Loveden eventually won his case for criminal conversation, the divorce was never finalised because when some years later he presented his private petition to obtain it from the Houses of Parliament, it was ruled that he would have to pay her a £400 annuity. He objected to doing so, arguing that it amounted to rewarding her for being adulterous, and thereafter actually petitioned the House of Lords not to grant the petition. Loveden attempted to control his daughters, objecting without success to the marriage of Margaret to Samuel Wilson Warneford and then driving away the fiancé of Jane. His son became known as Pryse Pryse and was also an MP, taking advantage of the inheritance of money and lands in Wales that had been brought into the family by his mother.

It was designed by landscape architect Le Breton, in 1870. The park and its château were registered as French national heritage sites on January 9, 1992.Base PA00083909  History  The Parc de Bourran estate is home to the Château de Bourran. The former château belonged to François-Armand de Saige, advocate general of the Bordeaux provincial parlement, former commander of the Revolutionary National Guard (1789), and former mayor of Bordeaux (1791). François-Armand de Saige was arrested during the Reign of Terror and executed on October 23, 1793. His property was inventoried in December 1793. The day-to-day life of the Château de Bourran as well as its wine-producing activity can be reconstructed from this inventory.. The estate produced between 38 and 80 barrels of red wine classed in the Graves up until the phylloxera plague. The estate was acquired at the end of the 19th century by ship-owner Émile Ravesies and his son-in- law, banker Piganneau. In 1869, they rebuilt the manor according to plans made by the architects Jules et Paul Lafargue. Three triple-bayed corps de logis, capped by a slate roof, face the park. In 1890, the owners entrusted the Orléanais landscape architect Le Breton with the design of the park,Base IA00025233 which included connecting the Devèze river to a pond, constructing small bridges over the river, and installing a decorative stone gate. From 1912 on, the vineyards were divided into lots to build the Bourranville subdivision.

The Messa di Santa Cecilia (mass of Saint Cecilia) is a religious work by Alessandro Scarlatti, written in 1720 for five soloists (SSATB), choir and orchestra, commissioned by and dedicated to cardinal Francesco Acquaviva of Aragona. Scarlatti was sixty years old at the time and composed at the beginning of the 18th century, in a modern style of the period, characterised by brio and seduction, which culminated in the great masses of Bach and Beethoven and \\"seems to foretell Haydn's last masses\\". This remarkable work, \\"coronation of all his church music\\", almost contemporary of Bach's Magnificat (1723), has nothing to envy to it, \\"both in terms of musical interest and stylistic synthesis of early 18th century trends\\".Messa di Santa Cecilia on All Music  Details  Kyrie, in A major * Gloria * Credo * Sanctus * Agnus Dei, in A major The execution time of the 923 bars is about 52 min. The Gloria is the most developed, exceeding 23 min. and the Credo which follows reaches 14 min.  Analysis  Santa Cecilia in estasi by Bernardo Cavallino in 1645 (Museo di Capodimonte, Naples). Scarlatti's writing from the Kyrie is lively on the strings, close to Vivaldi and the Bolognese; the choir's interventions alternate or overlap with the singing decorated with soloists. The composer ends the Gloria with its complex structure, with an impressive five-part fugue on Cum Sancto Spirito, the subject of which is provided by the Gregorian intonation of the Mass to Saint-Cecilia, Dilecisti. The Credo, which in its style looks more to the future, is close to the writing of his own Stabat Mater, but more to that of Pergolesi seventeen years later. The joyful precipitation of the Et resurenxit which \\"intensifies to the tumult\\", contrasts with the sudden stop on et mortuo in a striking effect. The movement concludes with a fugue that takes up the subject of the Gloria in a completely different development. In the Agnus Dei, Scarlatti merges the old (voice) and new (strings) styles, until they are reversed. In addition to the mass, still in 1720, Scarlatti composed almost as long (40 min.) vespers, discovered more recently, both scores being intended for the Santa Cecilia in Trastevere church. In 1708, he had composed Il Martirio di Santa Cecilia, inspired by the same figure, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, patron saint of musicians.

German soldiers fired machine guns into a large crowd gathered on Dam square to celebrate the end of the war, killing over 30 people.  Background  The German forces in the Netherlands surrendered to the Allies on 5 May 1945. However, the western part of the country remained occupied by the Germans until Allied troops could arrive to disarm them.Stichting Memorial voor Damslachtoffers 7 mei 1945 Local newspapers reported on 6 May that Canadian forces would reach Amsterdam the next day.\\"The events of May 1945 in chronological order\\", Stichting Memorial voor Damslachtoffers 7 mei 1945 On 7 May, thousands of people gathered on the Dam, the central square of the city, to celebrate the end of the war and welcome the Allied soldiers. Shortly after noon, a handful of Humber Armoured Cars of the British 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division began to approach the Dam by way of the Rokin to carry out reconnaissance. A convoy of German vehicles, also carrying out reconnaissance, narrowly passed the British vehicles near the Dam, but quickly disappeared again. The British, observing that the situation was potentially explosive, decided to withdraw from the city until forces of the Dutch resistance () had successfully disarmed the Germans and taken possession of three key locations: the Royal Palace, the main money office and the main post office (Operation Three Castles).  Shooting  While the local citizens celebrated on Dam square, German soldiers of the Kriegsmarine were trapped inside the (Grand Club) building, a large building at the corner of the Dam and Kalverstraat. In the nearby Paleisstraat, local forces arrested two German soldiers. One of them refused to surrender his weapon and fired a shot. German soldiers then appeared in the windows, on the balcony and on the roof of the and started firing into the crowd with machine guns.\\"Amsterdam, '7 mei 1945'\\", National Comité 4 en 5 mei (Dutch) Large-scale panic broke out on Dam square and most of the crowd dispersed via the Nieuwendijk, Rokin and Damrak.

The Germans and resistance forces then started to exchange fire. In total, the shooting lasted about two hours, until about 5pm.

Life He was born in 1816, the son of William Stanger (1781-1855) and Rebecca Yorke (1785-1856). He was baptised in Fleet Baptist Chapel, Lincolnshire on 15 April 1816. He studied medicine in London at Guy's Hospital and in the late 1830s was a ship's surgeon and chaplain employed by the South Australian Company, which was set up to assist merchants colonising South Australia. Stanger served aboard the Sarah & Elizabeth, a ship sailing from Hull to South Australia under Captain Wakeling. He was appointed a member of the College of Surgeons and the Apothecaries Hall in July 1840. He then moved to practice in Nottingham in the early 1840s. In 1845 he was appointed honorary surgeon to the Nottingham Dispensary. From 1845 he was in partnership with George Mills White but this partnership was dissolved in 1851. By 1846 he was a member of the Nottingham Medico-Chirurgical Society. He was elected president of the society twice, firstly in 1870-71 and again in 1876-77. He married Mary Hurst (1819-1894), eldest daughter of baptist preacher Nathan Hurst (1779-1851) and Sarah Beecroft (1781-1866) in Broad Street Baptist Chapel on 4 Jun 1844 and they had the following children: *William Stanger (1845-1928) *George Hurst Stanger (1847-1905) *Henry Yorke Stanger (1849-1929) *Margaret Anne Stanger (b.1851) *Mary Elizabeth Stanger (1853-1922) *Charles Edward Stanger (1855-1917) *Walter Stanger (1857-1885) *Harriette Stanger (b.1858) He became a deacon at Castle Gate Congregational Chapel.

Between 1982 and 1988, he killed 7 women and girls in Sverdlovsk, 6 of which were rape-related.  Biography  After school, Fefilov joined the army and was demobilized in 1966. At the same time, he fell in love with his neighbor, but the girl rejected him. This is suggested as a reason for the subsequent killings. A few years later, Fefilov married, and two daughters were born in the family. He worked as a printer at a publishing house of the \\"Ural Worker\\" newspaper. He was constantly in conflict with his wife because he could not get a separate apartment, while the family was forced to live in a communal. On the day Fefilov committed the first murder, another quarrel had occurred in the family. = 1982 murder and the Georgy Khabarov case = Fefilov committed the first murder in a forest belt near the Staro-Moskovsky road, in the area of the Kontrolnaya bus stop in Verkh-Isetsky district, on April 29, 1982. His victim was a 5th grade student of the 41st school named Lena Mangusheva. Fefilov raped her, and then strangled the girl with a pioneer tie, covering the body with branches afterwards. He took the rucksack from the deceased girl, from which he stole a pencil case and two textbooks, and then threw it into the toilet of a gas station. The body of Mangusheva was discovered the next day. During the investigation of the murder, special attention was paid to the verification of persons previously convicted of sexual offences. On May 5, according to a Sverdlovsk resident, a 28-year-old intellectually disabled man named Georgy Khabarov who was released in 1970, was responsible for attempted rape, previously convicted for three years for robbery. At the first interrogation, Khabarov said that on April 29, when the murder occurred, he was at home all day. But on May 7, after a series of interrogations, he was forced to confess to the rape and murder of the girl. However, he incorrectly indicated the crime scene, the method of murder (he claimed that he had killed her with a knife), inaccurately described the appearance of the murdered girl, her underwear and the missing rucksack, which was still not found, and often changed his testimony. On July 17 and 18, acquaintances of Khabarov named Vtoroy and Yenkov were questioned, who said that they had seen him in the vicinity of the murder scene on April 28 or 29, then Yenkov began to assert that he had seen Khabarov on April 29 at 15 o'clock. Full-time rates with Khabarov's witnesses were not held, and the contradictions in date and time were not solved. Other acquaintances and relatives of Khabarov claimed that he came to the village of the 8th kilometer of the Old Moscow Tract, but after April 28 he did not appear there. Khabarov's mother said that on the following day, her son was home all day. Subsequent examination showed that the blood type of Khabarov coincided with that of the killer, determined from the sperm found on the girl's body. After Fefilov's arrest, a repeated examination indicated that the blood type was identified incorrectly. Despite the contradictions in testimony and lack of evidence, Khabarov was brought to court. On September 24, 1982, the Sverdlovsk Regional Court found Georgy Khabarov guilty and sentenced him to 14 years imprisonment. He was charged with the rape and murder of Lena Mangusheva, as well as the attempted rape of another victim and the battery of a third. After the trial, Khabarov wrote a cassation appeal to the Supreme Court of Russia, in which he claimed that on April 29, 1982, he was not near the area of murder, denying the charges of murder and attempted rape, claiming that during the investigation he had been accused of physical and psychological abuse by law enforcement officials. At the same time, the Supreme Court of the RSFSR received a cassation complaint from the mother of Mangusheva, who asked to cancel the conviction and to impose the death penalty on him. To her complaint, she attached a collective letter to the workers of one of the enterprises of Sverdlovsk, demanding that Khabarov be executed. On November 22, 1982, the Judicial Collegium for Criminal Cases of the Supreme Court of the RSFSR considered both cassation complaints. The sentence of the Sverdlovsk Regional Court was canceled, the case was sent for a new consideration from the trial stage to the same court, but in a different composition. On March 23, 1983, the Sverdlovsk Regional Court convicted Georgy Khabarov of rape and murder against Lena Mangusheva, also incriminating him in other crimes, sentencing him to death. On April 27, 1984, he was executed. = 1983 and 1984 murders. The Mikhail Titov case. = At the time when Khabarov was kept on death row, at the \\"Kontrolnaya\\" stop, the real maniac committed a new crime. On August 7, 1983, Fefilov raped and strangled with a belt a 22-year-old female student and VIZ worker Gulnara Yakupova, hiding her body in the bushes and her clothes in a raspberry tree near the stadium near the Staro-Moskovsy road. Yakupova had arrived in Sverdlovsk from Bashkiria, so her disappearance was not immediately noticed. The girl's body was found on October 7. After the murder, the killer came to the crime scene three times - on August 30, September 23 and on October 8th or 9th. On May 11, 1984, not far from where Mangusheva was murdered, Natasha Lapshina, a 5th-grade pupil of the 41st school, became the maniac's next victim. This time, Fefilov not only raped and strangled the girl, but outraged her corpse by inserting a stick into her genitals. The girl's body was then thrown into a water-filled ditch, and her clothes were scattered around the country road. Fefilov took a case filled with markers from Lapshina's rucksack. Her body was discovered the following day. During the investigation into the murder of Yakupova, her neighbors in the hostel said that the girl complained about the persistent courtship of Mikhail Titov. At the end of May 1984, he was detained for harassing girls on the street. It later turned out that he was registered to a psychoneurological dispensary. Soon, Titov was forced to confess to the murders of Yakupova and Lapshina. He constantly changed testimony, could not show where the crime scene was and answer where he put the stolen items of the deceased. But the investigators did not take these things into account. There was a witness who claimed that she had seen Titov on the day of the murder near the crime scene, but it later turned out that she was registered in the city's psychiatric hospital. One and a half months after the arrest, Titov, who had received numerous injuries, was admitted to the prison hospital where he later died. For this incident, the head of the prison was removed from his post. The murder cases of Yakupova and Lapshina were closed due to the death of the accused. = 1985 murder and Ivan Antropov case = On May 6, 1985, on the lakeside of the Staro-Moskovsky road, Fefilov raped and strangled a 21-year-old art and technical school student named Larisa Dyachuk. He then proceeded to abuse her corpse, again, inserting a stick into her genitalia. The girl's clothes and items were then scattered around the crime scene. Fefilov did not hide the body, but took the ring, medallion, wristwatch and medical scalpel from the victim. Her corpse was found on May 17. A month later, the two underage Yashkin brothers, who were forced to confess to Dyachuk's murder, were detained and named two of their acquaintances as accomplices. The Yashkins were kept under arrest until the autumn of 1985, but they failed to prove their involvement in the murder. Then, on suspicion of the same murder, Ivan Antropov, a fireman from the forestry enterprise, was arrested. Paint was found on his jacket, which, according to experts' opinions, was identical to that found among Dyachuk's things. Re-examination established that the paint on Antropov's jacket and the colors of the murdered girl did not have a common genetic basis. Despite the absence of evidence to his guilt, Antropov's case was twice brought to court and returned for further investigation. Ivan Antropov was under arrest for ten months in a pre-trial detention center until the next year, when the real maniac committed a new murder. = 1986 murder and the maniac version = On May 26, 1986, near the stadium near the Staro-Moskovsky tract, Fefilov raped and strangled a student of the Ural State Medical University, Olga Timofeeva. As in the previous two cases, the maniac outraged the corpse, inserting a stick into the genitals, but also cutting off her breasts. He then covered the body with some branches, taking a wristwatch, gold ring with a stone and sports trousers from the victim. Timofeeva's body was found two days later. At this time, the senior security officer of the Sverdlovsk Police Department Yuri Kokovikhin turned his attention to the similarity of the ongoing killings in the area of the \\"Kontrolnaya\\" bus stop in the Verkh-Isetsky district. In the Verkh-Isetsky District Department of Internal Affairs, criminal cases from recent years were checked. While examining them, Kokovikhin concluded that the killings were committed by one person, of which he wrote a report on and sent to the leadership of the Department of Internal Affairs. He proposed the creation of a single operational-investigative group to search for the criminal, but his version did not find support among colleagues. After the murder of Olga Timofeeva, considerable forces were thrown in to search for the criminal. All seven Sverdlovsk ROVDs allocated a certain number of employees daily in operational investigations. Police outfits patrolled and ambushed around the Kontrolnaya bus stop. Old criminal cases were reviewed and psychoneurological dispensaries were checked. But the actions of the police and prosecutors did not have a clear plan. Kokovikhin's version was still rejected. A theory was proposed that Kokovikhin himself committed the murders in an effort to prove that he's right. His independent actions caused great dissatisfaction with the leadership and he was removed from the investigation, and subsequently dismissed from the police force. The Svedlovsk Regional Party Committee demanded the immediate arrest of the killer. The father of the aforementioned Yashkin brothers, who was arrested for forging documents, was forced to write a confession, but then refuted his testimony. His guilt could not be proven. = 1987 murder = The measures taken during the search for the killer forced Fefilov to change his hunting grounds: he stopped killing at the Kontrolnaya bus stop, and instead moved to other areas in the city. The next crime was committed in the Zheleznodorozhny District. On May 22, 1987, not far from the VIZ train station, Fefilov raped and strangled 19-year-old Elena Kook with a belt. He then abused her corpse, inserted a stick into the girl's genitals and cut off her breasts. He then threw her body into the bushes near the railway embankment, where it was found the next day. Three people were arrested - the mentally retarded Galiyev, Karasyov (in 1985 he was suspected of murdering Dyachuk, as it was he who found the body) and the also mentally retarded Vodyankin. Soon, all three confessed to the murder of Elena Kook, with Vodyankin also confessing to the four other murders committed near the Kontrolnaya bus stop. = Arrest, death and aftermath = The last crime the maniac committed occurred in the Oktyabrsky District. On April 25, 1988, in the Mayakovsky Central Park of Culture and Rest, Fefilov tried to rape and then strangled a young woman. He took a wristwatch, a purse with money, a gold ring and glasses from the deceased. While trying to hide the body, Yevgeny Mordvyanik, a senior lieutenant of the internal service of the Interior Ministry who happened to be near the crime scene, detained him. On May 7, information about the arrest of the maniac was published in the newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya. In order to the investigate the murders, investigators for particularly important cases of the Prosecutor's Office of the RSFSR Viktor Pantelei and Vladimir Parshikov flew to Sverdlovsk. After his arrest, Nikolai Fefilov began confessing to his crimes, including the murder of Mangusheva, for which Georgy Khabarov was convicted and executed. His testimony was confirmed during the investigative experiments, during one of which a portfolio belonging to the murdered girl was found. While searching through Fefilov's apartment and workplace, the printing houses from the \\"Ural Worker\\" newspaper found the belongings of the victims, which were later identified by their relatives and friends. Forensic psychiatric examinations found that Fefilov was sane. The investigation into the murder series hit the reputation of law enforcement agencies of the Sverdlovsk Oblast hard, coupled with the fact that the maniac's trial could turn into a scandal. However, on August 30, Fefilov was strangled by his cellmate in prison. Officially, the cause of the murder was a quarrel, but a theory was proposed that the leadership of the police and the prosecutor's office in Sverdlovsk did not want to see him live long enough to face trial. Investigators from the Prosecutor's Office of the RSFSR investigated the murder, but failed to prove that it was a hit job. On October 25, the criminal case against Nikolai Fefilov was terminated due to the death of the accused. In 1989, Georgy Khabarov was posthumously rehabilitated from the murder of Lena Mangusheva. None of the law enforcement officers of Sverdlovsk were prosecuted for initiating fabricated criminal cases against Khabarov and the other detainees. The accused were the victims of the arrest of offending Deputy Chief of the Verkh-Isetsky District Department of Internal Affairs, Col. Shirokov, and the then-deceased criminal investigator Kabanov.

F. Mathews from a story by Vivek. It was produced by Raju Mathew through his production company Century Investments. The film stars Fahadh Faasil and Sai Pallavi. The film features original songs composed by debutant P. S. Jayhari and a musical score by Ghibran. The story is set in a psychiatric asylum. The film is a cultural remake of the movie Stoneshearst Asylum. Principal photography began in November 2018 was completed in January 2019 in a 55-day shoot, extensively shot in Ooty. The film was released on 12 April 2019. Plot Back in 1967, Lakshmi (Shanthi Krishna) comes home to witness her niece, Nithya (Sai Pallavi), playing with a piece of thread, having been completely dissociated from reality, while surrounded by the dead bodies of her family members. Her mental state and reaction upon seeing her aunt leads us to believe that she is the killer. The story then shifts to an eerie mental asylum set in the wilderness 5 years later where Dr. Kannan Nair (Fahadh Faasil), a psychiatrist, has come to inspect the place. We are introduced to the 5 resident patients, Renuka (Lena), the caretaker and Dr. Benjamin (Atul Kulkarni), who is the main doctor there, he is also the owner of the place. Upon meeting Dr. Benjamin, Dr. Nair is upset about the whole setup of the asylum and continues to question Benjamin's integrity as a doctor. Dr Benjamin says he will make Dr. Nair see how good of a psychiatrist he is by hypnotizing him. Dr. Nair notices that, although there are only five patients on the records; there seems to be a sixth patient, Nithya, who happened to be chained in a cell hidden away from the public's eye. Dr. Nair demands to see her, accusing that the treatment methods adopted by Dr. Benjamin is primitive, illogical and illegal, upon which Dr Benjamin states that Nithya is his daughter and that he has her locked away because she is too dangerous. Dr. Nair proceeds to visit Nithya in her cell and enters it avoiding the guard's warning to not do so, Nithya appears as a scary and sinister person, almost ghoul like. Nithya, upon spotting an intruder in her space hits Nair and he falls unconscious on the cell floor only to wake up in his room hours later. He records his day's findings on his voice recorder and decides to explore the place a bit. It was previously mentioned by Renuka that the asylum is so big and with so many corridors and rooms that even she hasn't explored the whole place yet. He comes upon a door that opens to a tunnel at the end of which Lakshmi was locked in a cell. She tells the Nair to somehow rescue Nitya from this place. After coming out of the strange tunnel, he goes into Dr. Benjamin's room to escape from a security guard who was patrolling the corridors. There, he comes upon a diary which was hidden under the doctor's study. The next day, Dr. Nair leads Nithya out of her room and settles her with the other patients, to live among them. When Dr Benjamin questions this act, Dr. Nair mocks him and says autism, which is what Nitya has, is not a mental disability to be locked up for. Dr Nair reads the diary he found from Dr. Benjamin's desk and it reveals to the viewer about Nitya's history. We see her father is not Benjamin, but Jaya Narayana Varma, a royal from Nadakkal Kovilakam. Nitya was brought to Benjamin by Lakshmi after the murders in their family and she asks him to treat her. and look her after as his daughter till the end of the days. We see that Varma loved his daughter and refused to believe she was mentally disabled by treating her just like a normal child, and when he discovers her perfect reflexes he teaches her kalari, a martial art form native to Kerala. While Nair was reading the diary, standing in front of a dock, he slips into the water and the hospital guard ends up saving him. Though Dr. Nair believes he was pushed by someone and tries to escape from the place at night with some medical documents but is chased the ground dogs and watchman suspecting him to be an intruder. These acts of assault lead him to believe that Benjamin is trying to kill him and this suspicion is somewhat strengthened by a dialogue they share afterward where Benjamin states that \\"sheep don't hunt, they are to be hunted\\". After this appalling turn of events, Dr Nair grows close to Nitya and takes her out on the hospital grounds and an obvious romance is bubbling between them. This disturbs another young patient Jeevan who also likes Nitya. In a conversation with the nurse and Dr. Benjamin, who appears to be lovers, it is revealed that he had erased Nitya's memories completely. Dr Nair finds this out, and tries to spark her memories by talking about her father and asking her what happened to him, and Nitya starts to remember her father, her aunt Lakshmi, and her cousin, Vinayan (son of Lakshmi). Dr Nair later goes to Dr Benjamin and tells him that he is going to take Nitya away and save her from his evil methods, Dr Benjamin mocks him and warns him to not make promises that he cant keep. Dr Benjamin suspecting Nityas memories are coming back plans to continue his primordial methods on her. Nair who searches her is misled by Benjamin and in an effort o find her chases a car that turns out to carry the catatonic body of asylum patient Jeevan. Upon running back to the facility, he is helped by the patients who are all fond of Nitya and they lead him to the place where the Benjamin conducts his therapeutic experiments. There ensues a fight between Nitya, Nair and Benjamin whereafter the two manage to escape by severely injuring Benjamin. The story then proceeds to a few days later when a man (Prakash Raj) claiming to be Dr Kannan Nair visits the hospital. In a rather mind boggling twist of events it is revealed that he is the original Dr. Nair and the imposter was actually Vinayan, Nitya's cousin. It turns out Vinayan was a patient of Dr Nair and was suffering from schizophrenia with delusions and all of its psychotic elements. Here we are shown various scenes from the movie that proves this, as it happens there was no real Lakshmi imprisoned in the hospital, it was all a figment of Vinayan's hallucinations. Lakshmi died a few years after admitting Nitya in the asylum. Vinayan plunged himself into the water while reading the diary, his paranoia made him believe someone pushed him, his growing anger and lack of professionalism, his attempts to be close to Nitya and a little too much protectiveness towards Nitya as a visiting psychiatrist, etc. The real Dr Nair censures Dr. Benjamin and his lack of insight in interpersonal relationships despite being a psychiatrist. He mocks the inability of theirs to spot someone as mentally unstable as Vinayan in those three days and is stunned by the fact that they didn't even ask Vinayan for any form of identity proof to show that he was Dr Nair. He explains to them that Vinayan from childhood was a sociopathic child. He was also trained by Nitya's father. During treatment he was able to maintain his composure of sanity under medication and was admitted there after the 4 murders he committed. It is revealed to the audience that it was not Nitya who murdered her family but Vinayan in his spree after Nithya's father was killed by his brothers and to further stop their attempt at harming Nithya. Both of them were actually promised to each other by Varma before his tragic death, and the voice over states that they are both very close to each other and will do anything to keep the other safe. The film ends with the real Dr. Nair swearing that he will catch Vinayan wherever he is hiding and it is shown that Vinayan and Nitya are happily living together in a beautiful house on the hills at peace. Finally free from the external world.

In 1611, with a decree from the Ottoman sultan, Theophanes was able to fend off the Armenians from taking over the celebration of the Holy Light. Due to careless financial management by Serbian monks who lived at the Monastery of Saint Sabas, Theophanes was forced to sell holy heirlooms of value to avert surrendering the monastery and its metochion of the Archangel to the Latins and Armenians. During 1631 to 1634, the patriarch was successful in obtaining a number of firmans from Sultan Murad IV that continued those of Mehmed II and Selim I, thus fending off demands of the French ambassador in Constantinople. In April 1619, Patriarch Theophanes traveled to Moscow to participate in the enthronement of Metropolitan Philaret as Patriarch of Moscow on June 1, 1619.

It is located at a distance of circa 200 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 973 is about 230,000 light years across. It was discovered by Lewis Swift on October 30, 1885.  Characteristics  NGC 973 is seen edge-on, with an inclination of nearly 90°. Its bulge is shaped like a box or peanut. The subtraction of axisymmetric components from the profile of the galaxy showed that its bulge has an X-like morphology, which indicates the presence of a bar. A prominent dust lane runs across the galaxy. The galaxy kinematics revealed that the northeast side is the approaching one and the southwest is receding. The disk appears flat, without warps. The total hydrogen mass of the galaxy is estimated to be about , and the total dust mass is estimated to be , with clumpy distribution. Faint emission from gas lying outside the plane of the galaxy was detected in H-alpha, correlated with the galactic disk and halo. The nucleus of NGC 973 appears to be active based on its emission. It is categorised as a type 2 Seyfert galaxy. The most accepted theory for the energy source of active galactic nuclei is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole.

An independent community until 1894, it was joined along with Leopoldau, Donaufeld, Floridsdorf and Neu Jedlesdorf to the greater Floridsdorf municipality, becoming part of Vienna in 1904. Jedlesee is most notable for being the site of the estate of Countess Anna Maria Erdődy, close friend and patron of Beethoven, who stayed there with her on numerous occasions between 1805 and 1818.Alexander Wheelock Thayer, Thayer's Life of Beethoven (Hermann Deiters, Henry Edward Krehbiel, Hugo Riemann, Editors, G. Schirmer, Inc., New York, 1921). History O'Brien Monument in the Aupark, Floridsdorf-Jedlesee. Originally a farming and fishing settlement situated on the Danubian flood-plain, the village of Jedlesee was re-established by the Franconians at the embarkation point of the Marchfeld to Nussdorf ferry crossing, after the victory of Otto I over the Magyars at the battle of Lechfeld. The place-name \\"Uotcinessevve\\" - ascribed to Jedlesee - is mentioned in a deed of gift of the diocese of Passau, to which the area belonged, made by Holy Roman Emperor Heinrich II to Bishop Berengar on 5 July 1014. From later times the names Utzinsee (c. 1120), Utzeinsee (1324) and Utzessee (1455) are known. The inhabitants of Jedlesee and their overlords gained prosperity through fishing and the passage of travellers to Vienna, but with the building of three bridges across the Danube arms in 1439, Jedlesee's fortunes declined through Vienna's own collection of tolls for the crossing and the rights thereto. Subject to repeated flood damage over the centuries, the village was rebuilt many times, gaining stability only after the Vienna Danube regulation of 1870-75. Georg Scheibelreiter, Die Babenberger (Böhlau, 2010), 'Jedlesee' in Viennese history wiki (municipal site, in German). In 1529 and again in 1683, Jedlesee was laid waste by the Turks. From 1533 the lords of Sinzendorf owned the village, but in 1575, after years of disputes over traffic rights, the brothers Friedrich and Tiburtius Counts Sinzendorf sold the entire site to Vienna's Brückenamt (bridge authority). From 1587, the name Jedlesee, formed by a spoonerism, is heard for the first time. Between 1573 and 1642 Jedlesee was a sovereign fief, first mentioned by a local judge (Gerstl) in 1587. During the Bocskai uprising, battles were fought with the cavalry of István Bocskai, and in 1619 and 1645 with the Swedes during the Thirty Years War. In 1642 Andre Gurlandt bought the fief for 200 guilders as a free inheritance; 18 different owners followed him (among them Albert Lonqueval Count Bouquoy in 1696 and the personal physician of Maria Theresa, Anton Freiherr von Störck, in 1778), the last of whom sold the domain to Klosterneuburg Monastery in 1841. In 1700 the Jedlesee manor house (founded c. 1650) was restored, and in 1712/1713 the Loretto Chapel (Jedlesee Church) was built. Jedlesee's Aupark is one of the last natural green oases in Floridsdorf that remained after the regulation of the Danube. The O'Brien monument at the northern entrance of the park commemorates Major General Johann Freiherr von O'Brien, who succeeded in forcing a retreat of the French in 1809 with only a handful of Austrian soldiers, thereby achieving an important prerequisite for the victory of Archduke Charles in the Battle of Aspern. Geography Plan of Jedlesee, 1821 Jedlesee in 1872 Jedlesee is a sub-district of Floridsdorf, the 21st district of Vienna, which belonged to Lower Austria until 1904. From the time of incorporation, an ever-faster development of agricultural villages resulted in the modern-day suburban settlement. The old village of Jedlesee stood at the southwest end of the Marchfeld basin. It was built on a tributary of the Danube known as the \\"black lacquer\\" (Schwarzen Lacke), which is still recognizable today as a strip of meadow abutting the church and close to the Erdödy-Beethoven Memorial. This branch of the Danube was the most frequent cause of the periodic destruction of Jedlesee by a river which brought both flooding and ice impacts. With the Vienna Danube regulation, the \\"black lacquer\\" was separated from the river's main stream and filled in after the Second World War with rubble from bombed Viennese houses and industrial waste.Topographisches Post-Lexikon des Kronlandes Oesterreich unter der Enns (kaiserlich-königliche Hof- und Staats-Druckerei, Wien, 1851). The \\"Black Lacquer\\" area north of the old arm of the Danube forms its own cadastral community, which today is regarded as part of the Jedlesee sub-district. The Jedlesee cadastral communities (covering 144.97 ha) and the Schwarze Lackenau (518.62 ha) together extend over an area of 663.59 ha. 85.97 ha of Schwarze Lackenau are located in the Döbling municipal district, 30 ha in the Brigittenau district. However, these parts are water areas of the Danube. The \\"Black Lacquer\\" area also includes sections of the Danube Island and the Marchfeld canal. To the north, Jedlesee borders the Lower Austrian communities of Klosterneuburg, Langenzersdorf and the Floridsdorf sub-district of Strebersdorf. To the east lie the Floridsdorf suburbs of Greater Jedlersdorf and Floridsdorf. Toward the southeast Jedlesee abuts the Döbling sub-districts Kahlenbergerdorf and Nussdorf as well as the district of Brigittenau. Places of interest =Erdödy Estate and Beethoven Memorial= The Erdödy Estate and Beethoven Memorial, Jedlesee. The Erdődy estate, built in 1795, the country residence of Countess Anna Maria Erdődy in the former Augasse (now Jeneweingasse), became the site of frequent visits by the composer Ludwig van Beethoven. Repeated sojourns by Beethoven at the invitation of the Countess are documented in particular for the years 1815/16, including the organization of house music soirées under Beethoven's direction. It was thanks to the efforts of the music-loving Countess that Beethoven was eventually furnished by noble patrons with the economic means to make his permanent adoptive home in Vienna. The friendship between Beethoven and Countess Erdödy also found expression in the composer's work: Beethoven dedicated several works to Anna Maria Erdödy, including the two piano trios Opus 70 (1808), the sonatas for cello and piano Opus 102 (1817) and the canon Happy New Year, WoO 176 (1819). In 1863 the estate burned down partially, but the lower section including the old stairwell remained undamaged. A memorial plaque on the wall shows the water level of the great Danube flood of 1830. In a niche outside the house there is a statue of St. Florian with helmet, armour and sagum, the left arm cradling a flag, with the right hand extinguishing the flames blowing from the windows of a house. In the garden is a statue of St. John of Nepomuk, created by the sculptor Würtinger after the original was destroyed in the Second World War. From 1973, the estate became a cultural centre through the initiative of the \\"Association of Friends of the Beethoven Memorial Site in Floridsdorf\\" founded by Leopold Wech, where chamber music, domestic and folk music were cultivated and author evenings and lectures were held. Due to a change of ownership, the memorial had to close in 2013. A cooperative venture with the Floridsdorf District Museum has made it possible for the association's events to be held there and for the exhibits of the memorial to continue to be accessible to the public.Former Vienna Museums (in German) =Beethoven Way= Sculpture near the Maria Loretto church on the Beethoven Path. Beethoven, who nearly always left Vienna to spend the hot summer months in the villages north of the city, had found various homes from home in Nussdorf, Grinzing and Heiligenstadt, and through his acquaintance with Countess Erdödy received frequent invitations to come to her newly acquired Jedlesee estate. Beethoven, preferring not to take the long detour from Nussdorf via the Danube bridge over the Prater, decided on the shortest route, the crossing between Jedlesee and Nussdorf. In memory of Beethoven's walks in Jedlesee, the Beethovenweg (\\"Beethoven Way\\" or \\"Beethoven Path\\") was opened on May 12, 2007. Along the way, sculptures designed by the artist Manfred Satke and produced by Josef Frantsits, four metres high, were erected in the shape of broken tuning forks to memorialize Beethoven's hearing loss.Route of the Beethovenweg: PDF 502KB Stations on the Beethoven path include * District Museum, Floridsdorf * Karl- Seitz-Farm * Beethoven Memorial * Parish Church of Jedlesee, Mary Loretto Church * O'Brien monument * Danube Island Cherry Grove =Maria Loretto church= Maria Loretto church, Jedlesee. The parish and pilgrimage church of Jedlesee is a Roman Catholic church located at Lorettoplatz 1 in the 21st Viennese parish of Floridsdorf. The parish is located in the City Deanate 21 of the Vicariate of Vienna City, belonging to the Archdiocese of Vienna. It is dedicated to St. Mary Loreto. The building is under a preservation order.Archdiocese of Vienna - Maria Loretto parish. By the 11th century there already existed a small chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas, followed by other chapels dedicated to St. Sebastian, St. John of Nepomuk and St. Three Kings. The core of the present church is the Maria Loretto Chapel, built in 1713 by Countess Antonia Renata of Bouguoy. It is modeled after the Italian site of Marian pilgrimage at Loreto. The area around Jedlesee and the Weinviertel was part of the diocese of Passau until 1785. On 5 July 1769, Pope Clement XIV granted the Maria Loretto church a plenary indulgence for the annual feast of Mary's birth. In 1779 the landowner Anton von Störck extended the chapel, making it the sanctuary of the church. In 1834 the church was elevated to a parish church and expanded again in 1877. The church received its tower in 1885 on the initiative of the priest Vinzenz Wenhart, who in 1873 laid out the current Jedlesee cemetery, the now abandoned one in Jeneweingasse having become too small. Interior of the Maria Loretto church. In spite of additions that changed its original shape, the church, which was thoroughly renovated in 1936, has retained the character of a simple country church. In the vestibule are statues of St. Florian and St. Sebastian. The two side altarpieces, of Saints Peregrine Laziosi and Patrick, are by Franz Anton Maulbertsch.; On the northern outer wall is a war memorial created by Adolf Weilguni with military insignia, a cross, laurel branches and inscriptions commemorating the fallen of the two world wars from Jedlesee, beside it another plaque commemorating the Capuchin priest Joachim Haspinger, a companion of the Tyrolean freedom fighter Andreas Hofer, who worked temporaily as a chaplain at the church. Coat of Arms Statue of the Virgin Mary of Loretto with Christ-child, Jedlesee. The Jedlesee coat of arms shows the Virgin Mary of Loretto with the infant Jesus in her arms against an argent field. The two sacred figures of the crest are shown wrapped in a golden cloak, decorated with pearl cords and crowns. On each side are two letters in red: M (for Maria) and L (for Loretto). Our Lady of Loretto is the patroness of the Jedlesee church, the coat of arms a replica of the local pilgrimage statue. The statue of Our Lady of Loretto can be seen in Jedlesee at the intersection of Anton-Bosch-Gasse with the corner of Wiener- / Michtner Gasse.

Typically the plate or paddle of the tilting weir moves up and down in a narrow duct by titling, pivoting or rotating on its bottom horizontal axis - which opens or closes the tilting weir thus controlling the flow of water out of the higher drainage basin. For example a reservoir, lake, duct, channel, river, pond, dyke or ditch to a lower lying area or catchment or drainage basin. Construction There are beamed tilting weirs and beamless tilting weirs. Beamed tilting weirs have a strut, bar or beam across the top of the tilting weir. Beamless tilting weirs are used where the watercourse could be subject to a significant volume of debris. Small boats and canoes are able to cross a beamless weir. Tilting weirs are manufactured from galvanized mild steel, painted mild steel, stainless steel, HDPE and set in channels which are likely to be reinforced with concrete. The different technical problems that an engineer faces during the design of a moveable weir including load assessments dynamic water pressure, wind wave tide, snow, ice, etc. and strength assessment of steel and concrete structures, static and dynamic floating stability assessment.Design of Movable Weirs and Storm Surge Barriers: Report of Working Group 26 of the Inland Navigation Commission, Brussels, Belgium: International Navigation Association, PIANC General Secretariat Brussels Belgium 2006, Operation Tilting Weir Animated Schematic In order to operate, the tilting weir needs to be manually or mechanically opened and closed. Small tilting weirs are operated with hand wheels and electric motors but other methods have been employed especially for larger structures. Tilting weirs are usually controlled by human intervention but a self-regulatory tilting weir that could be counterbalanced by floating weights was patented in 1994. At the time of construction the 2018 Leed’s tilting weirs were unique for being raised and lower by deflating and inflating giant neoprene bladders Applications Tilting weirs have been employed for flood control, environmental water management and water management in natural and industrial environments not excluding maintaining navigable depths on waterways. Conservation areas for example marsh land where the water levels need to be controlled to encourage wading birds in Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Swamp reclamation the 2007 Navira Swamp Restoration Initiative employed tilting weirs in Trinidad. Land and river systems drainage and monitoring. The Louth Navigation canal and parts of the old River Lud perform land drainage and water level control with a number of locks and pumping stations. A tilting weir controls water levels in the Riverhead Basin and includes a gauging station which measures the flow along the canal. Controlling the height of water within a chamber at water treatment works. Flood alleviation. Tilting weirs were constructed to protect the city of Leeds UK against flooding from the rivers Aire and Hol Beck. Power generation. The Lanark Hydro Electric Scheme in Scotland uses automatic tilting weirs at different heights to control the head and flow of water cascading through turbine generators. History The tilting weir has its origins in the 19th century drum weir which functions using the same principles as the 20th century design. The drum weir, was for a long time confined to the River Marne, where it was first introduced in 1857.Achievements in engineering during the last half century. Leveson Francis Verono-Harcout. C Scribner, 1891 Early tilting weirs were constructed from wrought iron and wood. The Lanark hydro-electric plant was built from 1924 to 1927. It has three pivoting counterbalanced gates or tilting weirs. A mechanical tilting weir that moved the paddles on a central axis was patented by WGJ De Wit in 1988 Regulations A tilting weir in the natural environment is likely to obstruct the natural movement of water species. Regulations exist to enforce minimising the damage to the environment and often require fish ladders and or elver passes to be deployed with a tilting weirs. Fish pass regulations state providing free and unhindered fish passage is a major objective of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) in achieving good ecological status. It is also important in the context of the EU Eel Regulations which gives the Environment Agency additional powers to require screening of abstraction intakes and outfalls. Eel and elver pass regulations require notification to the Environment Agency about man made structures likely to affect the movement of eels. Where any such structure exists, there is a requirement to construct and operate an eel pass to allow the passage of eels.

Early life Wilson was born Monique Marie Mauricette Arnoux in Haiphong, Vietnam in 1923 (or possibly 1928) to French parents. Her father was an officer in the French navy. As a child, she met Wicca founder Gerald Gardner while he was working as a British customs official. The two became close, with Wilson referring to him throughout her life as \\"Uncle Gerald\\". In 1939, Wilson's father was killed, and she and her mother fled with other refugees to Hong Kong. There, Wilson would meet her husband, Campbell \\"Scotty\\" Wilson, a bomber pilot for the RAF. Involvement with Wicca She became known as Britain's \\"new \\"Queen of the Witches.\\" In the 1960s, the Wilsons (now living as pea farmers in Scotland) developed an interest in Wicca. Monique Wilson wrote to her old friend \\"Uncle Gerald\\", asking for guidance in establishing a Wiccan presence in Scotland. Gardner referred them to his friend Charles Clark, who initiated the Wilsons and their young daughter into Wicca and gave Wilson the craft name \\"Lady Olwen\\". By 1961, the Wilsons had founded their own coven in Perth. She became a high priestess of covens in Scotland. Shortly before his death in 1964, Gerald Gardner named Monique Wilson his heir, bestowing most of his estate and the entire contents of his Museum of Witchcraft and Magic upon her.

In 1973, Wilson sold the Museum and its contents (10,000 items) to Ripley's Believe It or Not!, facing much criticism from the Wiccan community for her perceived betrayal. Later life After the backlash from her sale of Gardner's collection, Wilson distanced herself from the Wiccan community. She died in 1982, followed by her husband in the 1990s.

Weigall served in the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment and the South Staffordshire Regiment during the First World War, and later played first-class cricket in British India. Early life and military career Born in Marylebone, Middlesex, Weigall was son of a Victorian artist, Henry Weigall (best known for his portrait of Benjamin Disraeli in 1878–1879), and his wife, Lady Rose Sophia Mary Fane, daughter of John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland, and wife Priscilla Anne Wellesley-Pole. Through his mother, he was connected to the Duke of Wellington. A younger brother was Lieutenant Colonel Sir William Ernest George Archibald Weigall, 1st Baronet, KCMG, a Conservative Member of Parliament who was Governor of South Australia. One of his older brothers was the cricketer Gerry Weigall (born Gerald John Villiers Weigall). Another brother, Evelyn, was also first-class cricketer. Weigall was educated at Wellington College, before enlisting in the Rifle Brigade as a Second Lieutenant in December 1892. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in October 1893, with promotion to Captain following in February 1898. He transferred to the Royal Berkshire Regiment in that same year. Weigall ran a fishing company in Grimsby during the first decade of the 1900s, with the company ceasing to trade in 1909. Being located in Grimsby meant he played minor counties cricket for Lincolnshire from 1907-1914, making eight appearances in the Minor Counties Championship. World War I and first-class cricket Weigall served during the First World War as a captain in the Lincolnshire Regiment, though he was seconded to the South Staffordshire Regiment in January 1917. During his secondment he was promoted to the rank of major in December 1917. He served in British India with the South Staffordshire Regiment, during which he made his debut in first-class cricket for the Europeans against the Parsees at Bombay in December 1917. Weigall spent two years in India playing first-class cricket. He played for Lord Willingdon's XI in March 1918. In the days before India had Test status, Weigall played a first-class match in November 1918 for England against India at Bombay, playing alongside his brother Gerry. The match was a mock Test match celebrating the signing of the armistice to halt the war. He played seven first-class matches in India, scoring 171 runs at an average of 13.15, with a high score of 57. As a bowler, he also took 5 wickets. He died at Folkstone on 13 February 1957.

In July 1941, he was the leader of the Lithuanian Activist Front in Telšiai District. Noreika served as Head of Šiauliai District during the Nazi occupation of Lithuania, where he signed orders confining the district's Jews in a ghetto and confiscating their property. Noreika later became one of 46 Lithuanian authority and intellectual figures who were imprisoned by the Nazis at Stutthof concentration camp from March 1943 until the camp's dissolution on 25 January 1945, officially for inciting resistance to Nazi mobilization efforts. During the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Noreika was drafted into the Soviet army, then worked as a jurist in Vilnius, where he was an organizer of the anti-Soviet Lithuanian National Council.

For several days, Lithuanian activists took groups of 50 Jews and killed them near the village of Milašaičiai. Finally, on 12 July, the activists started fires in the town, which they blamed on the Jews. Noreika gave the order to massacre the Jews of Plungė.Pakalniškis, Aleksandras. Plungė. 1980. The activists marched and conveyed the remaining Jews to a site near Kaušėnai village and killed them there on 12–13 July. Catholic priest Petras Lygnugaris baptized 74 Jewish maidens but the Lithuanian activists killed them regardless. On 20 July, Noreika led a \\"Manifestation of Freedom and Friendship with Germany\\", where a crowd of thousands approved a resolution that he had written in support of Lithuania's Provisional Government and complete independence, as well as the German Army, the Reich and Hitler, and the Lithuanian Activist Front. He handed out medals at a water sports festival. On 25 July, Noreika, in the name of LAF, and Augustas Ramanaukas, as Telšiai District Chief, issued an order prohibiting local initiative in condemning and executing those detained. On 27 July, Noreika gave a speech in Plungė at a \\"Manifestation of Joy\\", where the locals approved his resolution. On 29 July, a group of 18 Samogitian local leaders chose LAF Telšiai leader Noreika to head the seven-member \\"Land of Samogitia\\" delegation, which also included Juodikis, Ramanauskas, Svilas, Plungė LAF leader Povilas Alimas (an organizer of the Plungė genocide), Dr Leonardas Plechavičius (who led the autopsies in Rainiai), and Jurkus (director of the Telšiai chapter of the Bank of Lithuania). The group drafted a letter voicing affinity with the \\"Iron Wolf\\", a fascist clique which on 23–24 July had failed to overthrow the Provisional Government, but had succeeded in taking over Lithuania's battalion and police forces, had established the Kaunas ghetto on 25 July and was organizing the Lithuanian Nationalist Party. The Samogitian group charged their delegation with negotiating unity between the Provisional Government, the Lithuanian Activist Front and the Lithuanian Nationalist Party.Blynas, Zenonas. Karo metų dienoraštis, 1941–1944 m. Edited by Rudis, Gediminas. Lietuvos istorijos institutas, 2007. 1941.07.31 – 1941.08.02. On 30 July, Noreika participated in a committee in Telšiai which sentenced Jurgis Endriuška to three months of a labour camp for leading a Communist Youth choir. In Kaunas, on 31 July, the Samogitians proposed that Noreika represent them in a troika which would merge the Lithuanian Activist Front and the Iron Wolf into the Lithuanian Nationalist Party. The Lithuanian Activist Front rejected this plan. The Provisional Government decided to appoint Noreika as Šiauliai District Chief as a way of getting him out of Kaunas. Interior Minister Jonas Šlepetys, who was being held hostage by the Iron Wolf, made the appointment on 3 August 1941. On 4 August 1941, Noreika replaced Šiauliai District Chief Ignas Urbaitis, who had asked the Provisional Government to accept his resignation. The Provisional Government, which Nazi Germany had never acknowledged, disbanded on 5 August 1941. Even so, on 6 August 1941, Noreika issued an edict advancing the Provisional Government's policy that Jewish property belonged to Lithuanian authorities. On 9 August 1941, Šiauliai Gebietskommissar Hans Gewecke announced himself in the Šiauliai newspaper Tėvynė. He asserted German control over Jewish property. Noreika aspired to a higher post, but Gewecke did not support him. Thus Noreika was not responsible for the City of Šiauliai, nor the ghettos there. However, about 100 documents relate Noreika to the management of Jewish matters in Šiauliai District, outside of the city, such as managing the ghetto at Žagarė. On 9 August, he commanded that the Jews of Tryškiai be moved to the town of Gruzdžiai. On 22 August 1941 Noreika informed local authorities and mayors that on the orders of the Šiauliai Gebietskommissar, all half-Jews and Jews in the district were to be moved to Žagarė ghetto, the Jews were allowed only to take clothing and at most 200 Reichsmark.Arbeit als Hoffnung: Jüdische Ghettos in Litauen 1941–1944, De Gruyter, 2015, Joachim Tauber, page 65, quote: Schreiben des vorsitzenden der stadr und des landreises Siaulai J.

Many Jews were shot on the spot instead of being sent to the ghetto. Noreika also took the initiative to send a proposal on 23 August to Lithuania's General Counselors that they permit the construction of a forced labour camp at Skaistgiris to make rational use of 200 Lithuanian undesirables. The Lithuanians rejected his proposal as they already had three forced labor camps. He was very popular with the farmers, and Noreika had the farmers supply food to students, so he was popular with them as well. During this time, Noreika was an organizer for the underground Lithuanian Front, and distributed their underground newspaper. The Lithuanian Front collected weapons for use against other Lithuanian factions such as the Iron Wolf.Parodymas pil.Vytauto Stonio.

He met with Lithuania's General Councilors on 24 February as they returned from Riga, the capital of Ostland, where they had been unsuccessful in linking recruitment of Lithuanian forces to political prospects for independence.Gyvenimas – meteoro skrydis.

On 26–27 March they were brought to Stutthof concentration camp, where they were held as hostages. The hostages included Pranas Germantas- Meškauskas, Stasys Puodžius, Vytautas Stanevičius, Pilypas Narutis-Žukauskas, Kazys Bauba, Rapolis Mackonis, Petras Buragas, Robertas Grigas, Juozas Narakas, Mečislovas Mackevičius, Mykolas Mačiukas, and Jonas Čiuberkis. In the first five weeks, several of the hostages died, but afterwards they were deemed honorary prisoners. They were housed separately from other inmates, allowed to wear civilian clothes, move about freely throughout the camp, receive parcels, write letters, and continue their education.„Die Mörder werden noch gebraucht“, Der Spiegel, 23 April 1984 Noreika studied English, but persisted in believing that the Nazis would defeat the Allies. In 1944, when the Germans retreated, Noreika was evacuated with other prisoners. Noreika nursed his friend, professor Juozas Jurgutis, and saved his life. The Soviets moved Noreika with other former concentration camp inmates to barracks in Slupsk, Poland. There, in early May 1945, he was mobilized into the Soviet army.Between the Public and the Personal: A New Stage of Holocaust Memory in Lithuania, Violeta Davoliūtė, 19 December 2018 =Post-war= In November 1945, Noreika returned to Vilnius. With Jurgutis's help, he got a job as a jurist for the Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. Noreika, Ona Lukauskaitė-Poškienė and Stasys Gorodeckis were the three organizers of a self-proclaimed National Council of Lithuania, which recruited suicide squads. Noreika assumed the rank of general and the nom de guerre General Storm (Generolas Vėtra). The Council worked to centralize partisan forces throughout the country, which helped Soviets locate partisan leaders, such as Jonas Šemaška. The Council engaged Lithuanian intellectuals as potential ministers, which led to the arrest and conviction of writer Kazys Boruta, who admitted to reading one of the Council's documents. Soviet authorities arrested Noreika and other leaders of the Council on 16 March 1946. When first interrogated, Noreika claimed that he worked for Soviet military counter-intelligence SMERSH, but three weeks later, he asserted that he had lied. Noreika was sentenced to death on 27 November 1946. He was executed on 26 February 1947, and buried in a mass grave in Tuskulėnai Manor.Tuskulėnai: egzekucijų aukos ir budeliai, 1944–1947, Severinas Vaitiekus, page 280 Legacy and controversy Memorial stone in Šukioniai, where Noreika was born The memoir of Stutthof hostage Rev. Stasys Yla established Noreika as a hero amongst the Lithuanian community in exile.

In 1997, the Lithuanian state awarded Noreika with the Order of the Cross of Vytis, first degree. A memorial plaque was placed at the entrance of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. A plaque in honor of Noreika is also at the front of the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights.LITHUANIA’S MUSEUM OF HOLOCAUST DENIAL, Dovid Katz, Tablet, 11 April 2018 A village school, as well as numerous streets in Lithuania are named for Noreika.War hero or Nazi collaborator? Family partners with victim’s kin to expose truth, Times of Israel, Robert Philpot, 8 January 2019 Noreika has been accused by several people and organisations for taking part in organisation of the Holocaust in Lithuania. An investigation conducted by the state-run Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania (LGGRTC) stated that these claims were not confirmed by the documentary evidence and a decision of the Regional Administrative Court of Vilnius Region confirmed this view. A subcommission of the International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania found the Centre's findings unacceptable and offensive, and objected to the commemoration of Jonas Noreika. In 2018, Grant Gochin, a South African Jew of Lithuanian ancestry (Litvak), filed a lawsuit against the LGGRTC for the charge of Holocaust Denial,The Woman Accusing Her Lithuanian ‘Hero’ Grandfather of Mass Murder in the Holocaust, Haaretz, Ofer Aderet, 2 February 2019 for erecting a plaque commemorating Noreika in front of the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights.

Remigijus Šimašius, the mayor of Vilnius, stated that there were no plans to restore the destroyed plaque, however, on 9 April, he announced that the plaque would be restored after documents confirming its initial placing in 1998 were found. The plaque was removed by Vilnius municipality on 27 July, 2019, days after the changing of the street name in honor of Kazys Škirpa, the founder of Lithuanian Activist Front, which was accused of antisemitic actions. However, in September 2019 a Lithuanian organization called Pro Patria produced a new commemorative plaque and installed it in place of the previous one. The plaque remains the subject of legal and political controversy and a focal point of disagreements about the role of Lithuanians like Noreika and the Provisional Government of Lithuania in the Holocaust. On 18 December 2019, the LGGRTC published a report about Noreika in which it claimed that the priest Jonas Borevičius, who was named to the Righteous Among the Nations for saving the lives of Jews in the Šiauliai Ghetto, and his testimony in a United States' court, Noreika saved the lives of Jews in Šiauliai. The centre claims that Noreika did not initially understand the true purpose of the Nazi ghettos.

The film stars Huang Bo and Shen Teng in the lead roles. It was released in China on February 5, 2019, the Chinese New Year. Plot An alien diplomat (Xu Zheng) is sent to Earth to establish intergalactic diplomatic relations. The superpower nation \\"Armenika\\" selfishly hide this contact with alien life, believing they are \\"the most advanced civilization on earth\\" and therefore have the sole right to do so. The alien diplomat however resents its assignment due to the requirement to interact with lower life forms. The treaty must be signed by exchanging DNA which is performed by putting a ball into the mouth and coating it with saliva. Armenika's Captain Zach Andrews (Matthew Morrison), through his own sense of self-importance, fumbles the signing of the treaty when he takes a selfie, and the alien interprets the flash as a sign of aggression. A satellite hits the alien spaceship, causing it to tumble out of orbit, landing in an amusement park. Two Chinese men working at the park, monkey trainer Geng Hao (Huang Bo) and his business-savvy wine merchant friend Shen Tengfei (Shen Teng), find the crashed alien spaceship, mistaking the alien diplomat for an exotic South American monkey, and remove the alien's headband. Having been in the circus monkey business their entire life, they do not know anything else, so they begin to train the alien as a performing monkey, much to the diplomat's disgust. Meanwhile, Armenika sends Agent John Stockton (Tom Pelphrey), their top operative, to search for the alien. The alien manages to take photographs of its surroundings by gaining access to its headband for brief periods of time, one of its gadgets apparently being a camera. Due to the setting being an amusement park, it has many replicas of famous architectural monuments around the world. The Armenikan agents intercept the transmission of the photographs, believing it to be in those locations, they go to the Kremlin and the pyramids of Giza, shooting everyone along the way. They eventually catch up with the alien. Meanwhile, Geng and Shen differ in opinion on what to do with the \\"monkey\\". Geng wishes to sell the \\"rare monkey\\" but Shen instead wishes to train the \\"monkey\\" in order to become a successful performer. The alien regains access to its headband which gives it telekinetic powers and confronts the two men, turning the tables and forcing them to perform for its amusement. It demands Geng sign the treaty by putting a new ball in his mouth, but he misunderstands and swallows the ball. They outsmart the alien, getting the alien very drunk, believing they have killed it, immerse its body in alcohol, planning to sell it. When the Armenikans arrive they hide the alien by dressing up their performing monkey in the alien's suit. They are taken with the disguised monkey to the Armenikan embassy, and the Armenikans interrogate them about the alien. They agree to help. Extracting the ball from his feces, Geng presents it to Agent Stockton, who proceeds to sign the treaty. The two men successfully pass off the monkey as the alien, performing their usual performing monkey show but with commentary explaining the fine points of intergalactic diplomatic etiquette and are let go. Stockton is told by a forensic scientist that the DNA they extracted from the ball was from a monkey, himself and an Asian man's feces. Discovering that he had been tricked, Stockton pursues the two men. Upon returning home, Geng and Shen discover the alien has resurrected. Stockton follows and arrives shortly after. A final battle ensues and ends with the two Chinese men getting drunk with the alien, signing the treaty with a third and final ball and the alien telekinetically taking all the alcohol home with it.

He spent five years writing a script. Crazy Alien is the final installment in Ning Hao's black comedy trilogy. It began in 2006 with Crazy Stone, continuing with 2009's Crazy Racer. Shooting began in Qingdao, Shandong on July 26, 2017 and ended on December 9 of that same year. Filming locations included Qingdao, Changsha, Russia and France. Animal abuse controversy =PETA's Account= In March 2018, a video surfaced showing a dog being spun around in a cage and dumped into cold water. The video was taped by a member of the movie crew. TMZ reported a representative of the movie saying there had been a design flaw with the suspended cage and that it had twice fallen into the water being completely submerged after spinning out of control; there was also a claim that between shots, the dog was worked into a frenzy so he would bark as loudly as possible, and that this had been done on several takes. The director did not give a statement, but Crazy Alien actor Matthew Morrison said he was heartbroken after seeing the video. =Studio's Response= The studio responded that the dog did fall into the water twice. They however contradicted PETA's account, arguing that the dogs were under the supervision and ownership of expert contractors and appropriate tents had been set up to dry the dogs with heating equipment. Several takes occurred without problem. On the final two takes the equipment failed resulting in the dog falling into the water. After the second failure the decision was made not to proceed but to use CGI. An empty cage was then repeatedly dropped into the water to be later combined with CGI. No animals sustained any injuries. Hao Ning, Director of the film, purchased the dog from the canine training school, which he personally vetted before hiring them to ensure the dogs were treated well, and it now lives in his family home. He named the dog August 1(zh:八一), the anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. Hao has invited journalists to his home to ensure that the dog is in good health and is treated well. Release Crazy Alien was released in China on February 5, 2019.  Reception  = Box office = The film earned a total of 1,000 million yuan in its first 3 days of release, grossing 1,500 million yuan on its opening weekend. It has grossed nearly 2,000 million yuan.

It is primarily active against Gram-negative bacteria, disrupting bacterial membrane integrity. The structure of this protein includes a proline-rich domain with similarities to the AMPs drosocin, pyrrhocoricin, and abaecin, and a glycine-rich domain with similarity to attacin. Diptericin is an iconic readout of immune system activity in flies, used ubiquitously in studies of Drosophila immunity. Diptericin is named after the insect order Diptera.  Structure and function  Diptericins are found throughout Diptera, but are most extensively characterized in Drosophila fruit flies. The mature structures of diptericins are unknown, though previous efforts to synthesize Diptericin have suggested Diptericin in Protophormia terraenovae is one linear peptide. Yet Drosophila melanogaster's Diptericin B peptide is likely cleaved into two separate peptides. Synthesis of Diptericin in vitro found activity of the full-length peptide, but independently synthesizing the two peptides and mixing them does not recapitulate Diptericin activity. Diptericin A activity is strongly tied to residues in the glycine- rich domain. = Diptericin as a model for understanding the specificity of host-pathogen interactions = A polymorphism at a single residue in the diptericin glycine-rich domain drastically affects its activity against the Gram-negative bacterium Providencia rettgeri. Flies with a Diptericin A gene encoding a serine allele survive infection significantly more than flies with an arginine allele. It is unclear how frequently such polymorphisms may dictate host-pathogen interactions, but there is evidence of widespread balancing selection that diptericin is not the only AMP with such polymorphisms. This close association between diptericin and P. rettgeri is further supported by genetic approaches that show that diptericin is the only antimicrobial peptide of the Drosophila immune response that affects resistance to P. rettgeri. The fruit fly Diptericin gene \\"Diptericin B\\" has a unique structure that has been derived independently in both Tephritidae and Drosophila fruit flies. This represents convergent evolution of an antimicrobial peptide towards a common structure in two separate fruit-feeding lineages. More surprisingly, sub-lineages of both Tephritidae and Drosophila that have specialized on non-fruit food sources have subsequently lost Diptericin B. In the mushroom-feeding fruit flies Drosophila guttifera and Drosophila testacea, this loss appears to have happened independently, as the mutations in these species' Diptericin B genes are different. This repeated loss of Diptericin B in fruit flies that have diverged to feed on non-fruit foods suggests Diptericin B is attuned to a fruit-feeding lifestyle, but unimportant and possibly even deleterious in non-fruit ecologies. These observations are part of a growing body of evidence that antimicrobial peptides can have intimate associations with microbes, and perhaps host ecology, in contrast to the previous philosophy that these peptides act in generalist and redundant fashions.  Functions beyond antimicrobial activityDiptericins can also have properties that reduce oxidative damage during the immune response. *Suppression of the diptericin B and attacin C genes in Drosophila leads to increased Sindbis virus growth.'' *Overexpression of diptericin and other antimicrobial peptides in the brains of flies leads to neurodegeneration. *The Drosophila diptericin B gene is required for memory formation.

Today part of the site of the former airbase is occupied by HMP Gartree. History =Construction & layout= Land for the development of an RAF aerodrome was earmarked by the Air Ministry in 1941, and work commenced on the construction of the Station during 1942. The construction work was undertaken by J.R. Mowlem & Co. and was completed in 1943. Vickers Wellingtons were by far the most numerous type operated from RAF Market Harborough RAF Market Harborough conformed to the layout of a typical RAF aerodrome, that is the specifications set by the British Air Ministry which called for three converging strips, each containing a concrete runway optimally placed (if practicable at the site) at 60 degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern. =RAF Operational life= The first Royal Air Force personnel arrived on the Station on 1 June 1943. RAF Market Harborough came under the control of No. 92 Group RAF (Bomber Command), and became the parent Station to the nearby RAF Husbands Bosworth when that Station was commissioned in August of that year. The complement of aircraft on the Stations as of 1943 is listed as 61 Vickers Wellingtons, 4 Miles Martinets and an Avro Anson. The Wellingtons were the primary training aircraft by that time largely withdrawn from front-line operations, the Martinets would have been used for the target towing operations and the Anson would have served as the Station's communication aircraft. Units =No. 14 Operational Training Unit= On 1 August 1943, No. 14 Operational Training Unit (No. 14 OTU) was re-formed at Market Harborough with the transfer of the unit from RAF Cottesmore. The OTU was tasked with the training of crews for RAF Bomber Command in both daylight a night operations. No.14 OTU continued to be housed on the Station until it was disbanded on 24 June 1945. Hawker Hurricanes also operated from RAF Market Harborough with 1683 BDTF =No. 1683 (Bomber) Defence Training Flight= In addition to the Wellingtons of No.14 OTU, RAF Market Harborough also operated Hawker Hurricanes and Curtiss Tomahawks which comprised No. 1683 (Bomber) Defence Training Flight RAF (1683 BDTF). The Flight transferred from RAF Bruntingthorpe on 3 February 1944 and disbanded on 1 August 1944. =No. 26 Air Crew Holding Unit= Following the cessation of hostilities in 1945, RAF Market Harborough became home to No. 26 Air Crew Holding Unit from 21 August 1945 until 18 September 1946. =No. 273 Maintenance Unit= No. 273 Maintenance Unit RAF (No. 273 MU) were occupants of the base from February 1946 until 5 October 1949. =Care & Maintenance= Flying operations at RAF Market Harborough ceased on 18 August 1945, following which the airfield was placed on care and maintenance managed by No. 273 MU. =British Army= Control of the former RAF Market Harborough was transferred to the British Army in 1948, the Station becoming known as 72 Brigade Vehicle Depot (72 BVD). The army retained custody of the Station until they finally left in the late 1950s. Today Because of the proximity of HMP Gartree, no aviation activity now takes place on the site and today it is largely used for agricultural purposes. In 1990 an application was submitted to develop some of the site into a cattle market on the area known as Airfield Farm. In the mid 1990s a further application was submitted to convert some of the land for offices, leisure facilities and an agricultural showground. In the late 1990s a further ideas concerned a Christian theme park together with a recreation of the Garden of Eden. =HMP Gartree= Following the cessation of military activity on the site at the end of the 1950s, part of the former RAF Market Harborough was earmarked for the construction of HMP Gartree in the 1960s. Opening in 1965, HMP Gartree was initially used as s Category C training center before it was upgraded to a maximum security facility. The most notorious episode occurred in December 1987 and concerned the escape of two inmates who were helped with the aid of a hijacked Bell 206 helicopter. Today the prison houses Category B prisoners.

The movement works to promote issues of economic, social and cultural justice, and to empower and create solidarity among women of the lower socio-economic classes in Israel.  History  The Ahoti movement was officially founded in 2000 by a group of Mizrahi feminist activists, including Henriette Dahan Kalev, Vicki Shiran, Neta Amar, and Shula Keshet, who is the executive director of the organization. The movement was founded upon the principles of Mizrahi feminism, and was born of the perspective that the feminist organizations in Israel were created and run by Ashkenazi women, mostly middle- and upper-class, and academics, from the center of the country, who worked to promote issues of interest and relevance to them. The Ahoti movement does not dismiss these issues, but contends that they are neither singular nor universal, and that they marginalize from the public consciousness the existence of large communities of women who are struggling for their everyday existence, and not for equal pay at executive levels or representation at senior levels of government. In 2007, Ahoti published the anthology To My Sister, Mizrahi Feminist Politics, which is a collection of articles, essays, speeches, personal stories, prose and poetry dealing with Mizrahi feminism. Included are issues such as class, identity, memory and alternatives. In 2012, Ahoti published From A to Z: A Dictionary of Peace by Women in Israel, the culmination of a 3-year project by 60 Jewish Israeli and Arab women from South Tel Aviv, Rahat, Yehud and Kfar Kera, who each contributed her personal perspective on peace. The book, which includes both prose and poetry, was translated into both Hebrew and Arabic, as needed. In 2003, Ahoti was a partner in the struggle of Vicki Knafo and the single mothers against cutbacks in child stipends. In 2008, Ahoti took part in the struggle against ethnically segregated schools in Immanuel. Together with the Tmura center, Ahoti sued on behalf of some of the parents in the settlement for violation of the law prohibiting equal use of public facilities. Concurrently, an appeal was made to the High Court of Justice, and protests were held in front of the Ministry of Education. In 2014, Ahoti founded the \\"Mizrahi Feminist Madrasa\\", an educational program offering courses and workshops. The Ahoti movement is a member of the Shutfut (partnership) Coalition, a coalition of women's organizations working together to promote equality and justice for women, with an emphasis on lobbying and advocacy. Other organizations in the coalition include Itach-Maaki Women Lawyers for Social Justice, Adva Center, Ruach Nashit (women's spirit), Kol Ha Isha (women's voice), and more. In 2009, Ahoti opened the Ahoti Fair Trade shop, the first and only of its kind in the Middle East. The store is operated in cooperation with 16 social organizations from around the country, and employs women on fair wage terms and sells handicrafts from more than 200 manufacturers from a variety of cultural groups, including cooperatives such as Ahta in Kiryat Gat, and Women Brewing a Business from Jerusalem. All the products are made by women who need economic empowerment, and through the store women can find new markets for their products, without the costs of middlemen or advertising.  Ahoti House  The movement's headquarters was established in the south Tel Aviv neighborhood of Neve Sha'anan, and serves as cultural and community center for Mizrahi feminism. It houses an information center, multi-disciplinary counseling, art shows, lectures, workshops, courses, and other events geared to residents of the neighborhood and the public at large. Ahoti house hosts the annual \\"Black Night\\" festival, which is held in protest of the Tel Aviv municipal \\"White Night\\" festival. Ahoti, together with other representatives of south Tel Aviv neighborhoods (which are largely Mizrahi, and more recently also Black) claim that \\"The White City\\", as Tel Aviv is known, is also the \\"White\\" city – that the municipality serves the Ashkenazi neighborhoods, and elevates Ashkenazi culture, at the literal expense of South Tel Aviv residents, whose neighborhoods have become slums, rife with drugs and prostitution, as well as pollution; and who in addition pay the cultural and social prices of this discrimination. \\"Black Night\\" events have become a target for police action, particularly in 2013, when the festival began.  Staff  Actor and director Ronit Alkabetz served as president of Ahoti, until her death in 2016. Shula Keshet is the executive director. The chairwomen of the executive committee is Oshri Hayon, and the head of projects is Carmen Elmakias. Past and present members include Smadar Lavie, Flora Sasson, Esther Eillam, Henriette Dahan Kalev and Pnina Motzafi- Haller.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=832495 on 2019-02-17 Description The length of the shell attains 11.5 mm, its diameter 7.5 mm. (Original description) The small, short shell has an ovate-fusiform shape. it is moderately stout, with slightly shouldered, convex whorls, and a regularly tapered, acute spire. The Suture is shallow, but well-marked. The shell consists of 4½ whorls, besides the large protoconch, which consists of about 3½ gradually increasing whorls. The whorls of the spire are obscurely shouldered at about the middle, above which the broad, sloping subsutural band is slightly concave. The sculpture on the penultimate whorl consists of about six elevated, rounded, revolving cinguli, with some much finer intermediate ones; some of the smaller cinguli are also found on the subsutural band. The transverse sculpture consists of fine, slightly flexuous lines of growth, crossing both the cinguli and their intervals, and on the subsutural band becoming more prominent in the form of oblique, recurved riblets, which do not take the form of nodules. On the body whorl the revolving cinguli continue at about uniform distances over the entire whorl and siphonal canal, but anteriorly the cinguli thicken and are wider than the grooves, while on the convex part of the whorl they are narrower than the intervals. The aperture is broad-ovate, rather large, acute posteriorly. The outer lip is thin, strongly convex in the middle, with a broad and shallow posterior sinus above the shoulder. The siphonal canal is short, straight, not contracted at the base. The columella is straight in the middle, with an oblique anterior edge. The inner margin of the aperture is strongly excavated and subangular at the base of the columella. There is no umbilicus . The animal is destitute of an operculum. The protoconch whorls are deep chestnut-brown, very minutely reticulated by oblique lines running in two directions. The whorls are regularly convex, the apical ones minute and a little prominent, so that the apex is acute. The color of the shell below the brown protoconch is translucent bluish white, with a somewhat glossy surface; when dead, yellowish white.Verrill A. E. (1885).

She is a staff writer for Tribune and was previously the economics commentator of the New Statesman. She also contributes to Novara Media. Early life Blakeley was born in Basingstoke, a town in Hampshire. She was privately educated at Lord Wandsworth College, and later attended the Sixth Form College, Farnborough. She studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at St Peter's College, Oxford, graduating with a first. Blakeley then obtained a master's degree in African Studies at St Antony's College, Oxford. After graduating, she worked as a management consultant for KPMG in their Public Sector and Healthcare Practice division. Blakeley then worked as a research fellow for a year at the left-wing think tank, Institute for Public Policy Research in Manchester, specialising in regional economic policy. Career Blakeley in September 2018 Blakeley joined the magazine New Statesman in January 2019 as its economics commentator, writing a fortnightly column and contributing to the website and podcasts. Her articles for the magazine included support for Lexit and a Green New Deal. Her first book, Stolen: How to Save the World from Financialisation, was published by Repeater Books on 10 September 2019. Michael Galant writing for the openDemocracy website, praised the book as a \\"convincing critique of modern capitalism for socialists and skeptics alike\\". CapX's Diego Zuluaga commented in his review that it was a \\"sweeping polemic against the market economy\\", and felt the author had been selective in how she presented evidence for her arguments. Blakeley has appeared on programmes such as This Week, Question Time, Good Morning Britain, Politics Live and The Andrew Marr Show. Blakeley became a staff writer for the democratic socialist magazine Tribune in January 2020. She sits on the Labour Party's National Policy Forum, which is responsible for policy development. Blakeley's second book, The Corona Crash: How the Pandemic Will Change Capitalism, is due to be published in October 2020. Political views Blakeley identifies as a democratic socialist and supports the use of capital controls, calling them necessary to \\"avoid economic blackmail by the markets\\" and protect the economy from financial flows. She opposes financial globalisation, arguing that it concentrates capital into financial centres that are more integrated into the global economy than they are with their own countries and leads to unfair trading practices that prevent countries from being able to protect their infant industries. Blakeley supports keeping interest rates low to prevent increased capital investment flows into financial assets and real estate, instead proposing greater public investment into the non-financial sectors to promote economic growth and raise living standards. Blakely also supports local and regional devolution across the UK, reasoning that decentralising the country's \\"grossly unequal\\" economy is the only way to rebalance it. She is critical of international law and European Union law in particular as a legal system, describing it as being selectively enforced \\"in the interests of the most powerful states\\" who are more able to influence its development than the weak, citing the Stability and Growth Pact as an example. Blakeley supports Jeremy Corbyn's views on the economy and campaigned and voted for him in the 2015 and 2016 Labour leadership elections, though she criticised him in 2016 for failing to \\"challenge the hegemony of neoliberalism\\" in the way she had imagined he would. =Green New Deal= Blakeley promotes a Green New Deal entailing billions of pounds of investment into green transport and energy infrastructure, social housing and R&D;, in addition to targeted support for manufacturers and exporters of environmentally-sustainable goods and technologies, as well as businesses that need to transition away from non-renewables. This is in conjunction with strengthened trade unions, increased wealth taxes, the nationalisation of key infrastructure and utilities, and the growth of cooperatives and mutuals. Though she has emphasised it as running \\"counter to a capitalist system\\", she has argued that \\"even those who do not identify as socialists\\" may soon realise that a green industrial revolution is the \\"only option\\". She calls for a \\"fair transition towards a low-carbon economy\\", in which the costs of adjustment are placed on \\"those most able to bear them\\", and for the government to take shares in businesses that they help to decarbonise, to redistribute the gains from the green growth. =European Union= Blakeley is a prominent Eurosceptic, and has branded the European Union as \\"neoliberal\\", \\"neo-colonial\\" and \\"run in the interests of financial and corporate elites\\". She has described the EU institutions as \\"inherently anti-democratic\\", citing the limited power of the European Parliament compared to the Council and the Commission, as well as the lack of strong mechanisms to hold MEPs to account for their actions, referring to Labour MEPs helping to narrowly elect Ursula von der Leyen against the party leadership's wishes as an example. She has also lambasted the Common Agricultural Policy as a \\"regressive measure\\" that has been \\"terrible for ecological diversity\\" and \\"disastrous\\" for farmers in the Global South. She has criticised the euro for being \\"incredibly favourable\\" to Germany and benefiting northern Europe at the expense of having \\"immiserated and humiliated\\" Greece and Italy and damaging the competitiveness of southern European exports. Blakeley supports a left-wing version of Brexit, arguing that the EU is a barrier to a socialist economy and that building such an economy outside of it could serve as a \\"beacon of hope\\" to member states that are \\"struggling under the weight of the EU's neoliberal technocracy\\". She advocates the UK ending free movement of capital and regaining full control of state aid as the priorities, and also supports maintaining free movement of people and promoting greater immigration from the parts of the world most affected by neo-colonialism. Blakeley has called for a post-Brexit UK to be built around a Green New Deal, which she has suggested would absorb the initial demand shock of even a no-deal Brexit and expand the economy's productivity. She strongly criticised Theresa May's withdrawal agreement and has accused its level playing field provisions of being an attempt by May and the EU to prevent a Labour government from implementing a \\"sweeping programme of economic reform\\".

It originated as a group of radical youths, and later grew with organized crime groups and became a large irregular force in the outskirts of Jakarta. Though the militia fought against the British and Dutch forces, they also fought against the Indonesian Army due to both ideological and territorial disputes. The group was scattered following an offensive by the Indonesian Army in April 1947, with its members later joining both sides of the conflict. History =Early years= The organization originated from the Angkatan Pemuda Indonesia - an organization formed by radical members of the People's Security Agency on 1 September 1945 - which organized and coordinated other youth groups across the city. API developed connections with underworld organizations of the city, due to API's political influence and the gangs' supply of weaponry. Despite so, API largely refrained from large-scale violence in its early period. API later announced a mass rally at Lapangan Ikada on 17 September 1945 - despite the presence of Japanese forces still - and the rally ended peacefully, with about 200,000 attendants and the presence of Republican leaders including Sukarno. Even prior to the Ikada rally, API had seized control of railways and tramways in Jakarta, and implemented free charges on the public transports. The group also established barricades on the city's roads, terrorizing the city's European community. Eventually, counter- terror operations - which included similar acts of terror against openly Republican-leaning Indonesians - resulted in the API considering of relocating outside the urban areas. The various groups under API was later reorganized as singular group, the Laskar Rakyat Djakarta Raya (LRJR), which was declared on 22 November 1945 in Salemba. Despite LRJR's attempt to remain inside Jakarta, Operation Pounce launched by British forces on 27 December forced the group to evacuate the city, and moved to Karawang, some eighty kilometers away. There, it used the Radio Republik Indonesia transmitter and published a newspaper, titled Goedam Djelata. LRJR was then organized into seven units, and formed relations and alliances with other revolutionary groups. At the time of the move to Karawang, LRJR had around seven hundred armed members, with the best equipment compared to other armed groups. =In Karawang= During its time at Karawang, LRJR and other armed groups controlled trade links between there and Jakarta, controlling the Karawang railway station. The group was initially supported by the Republican authorities, alongside with other irregular groups across Indonesia, and organized a central organization for the groups to coordinate, hence granting them formal military status. However, when the Indonesian administration called for a merging of the various armed groups into the Indonesian National Armed Forces (then known as the Republic of Indonesia Armed Forces, Tentara Republik Indonesia or TRI), LRJR resisted the move. LRJR was strongly opposed to the Linggadjati Agreement of November 1946, and openly called Sukarno and Hatta as \\"traitors\\". The group also incited fighting against TRI, at occasions attacking TRI posts. During the ceasefire negotiations that preceded Linggadjati, LRJR had launched a major attack against a Dutch barracks on 26 September 1946. LRJR later founded the Laskar Rakyat Jawa Barat - a coalition of laskar groups across West Java. During the negotiation process for the detailed demarcations of the Linggadjati Agreement, commander of Republican forces around the east of Jakarta Suroto Kunto disappeared, and was presumed kidnapped and killed. Kunto's superior Daan Jahja assumed that LRJR was the group responsible for the kidnapping, arrested a LRJR member and nearly killed him though he was prevented by Siliwangi Division commander Abdul Haris Nasution, who was wary of conflict with LRJR. =Dissolution= Relationship between TRI and LRJR further soured as the government attempted to enforce a monopoly on the Karawang-Jakarta trade, and a propaganda campaign painting LRJR as traitors was launched. In April 1947, TRI's Purwakarta commander communicated with the Dutch forces in Bogor and Jakarta, noting that they were planning on a \\"clean up\\" (i.e. handle the laskar), requesting \\"gentlemanly behavior\\" from the Dutch. The army began by disarming smaller armed groups and mobilized to surround Karawang. After a mortar was fired by the LRJR, TRI artillery units began to bombard LRJR positions, causing disorder in the LRJR ranks and inflicting casualties. By 19 April, the army had entered Karawang with little resistance and a week later the fighting ended. Some former members and leaders of LRJR eventually joined the Dutch side of the revolution, granted amnesty and was merged into the Hare Majesteit's Ongeregelde Troepen (Her Majesty's Irregular Troops) unit. Others later formed the 17 August Division who fought a guerrilla war against Dutch forces in West Java following the Renville Agreement, but the division was eventually disbanded on 1 September 1949, as it became clear that Dutch forces would withdraw from Indonesia. =Notable members= Some members of LRJR who later rose in politics include Chairul Saleh, member of LRJR's political council, who later served in various high-ranking political posts. Imam Syafei, who was a commander in LRJR, later became the Minister of Public Security under Sukarno's government.

It provides musical support for ceremonial events of national importance involving the army, the government, and the Dutch royal house. The repertoire of the band ranges from a variety of different genres, including military marches and contemporary/classical arrangements of symphonic music.https://www.rundel.de/en/the_royal_netherlands_army_band_johan_willem_friso/p-167/979  History  On July 7, 1829, William I of the Netherlands ordered that a music corps be established for the then Grenadier Regiment with 18 professional musicians and 10 conscript youths. The first public performance took place on 8 April 1830 on the occasion of the sixth birthday of Princess Sophie daughter of the William II. After the retirement of François Dunkler as bandmaster in 1849, he was succeeded by his son François Dunkler Jr, a clarinet player in the 11th Infantry Division. Dunkler Jr. Dunkler brought many merits and fame to the band over the course of the following 10 years, collectively winning second place at a musical competition in Paris. William III recognized personally these accomplishments by granting Dunkler Jr. the honorary title of Director of Music in 1861. Under the direction of Nicolaas Arie Bouwman, the band made a concert trip to Ghent, Belgium, on the occasion of the World Exhibition of 1913. The band was also present when Wilhelmina returned to her residence (Anneville) in 1945 following the allied victory in the Second World War. During the immediate post-war period, the focal points of military music were centered around wind orchestras. In addition, military tattoos were developed and as a result, the band gained more close international contacts, specifically in the NATO and European Union sphere. The country became widely known for the large military tattoos that were held annually. In connection with this, Anne Posthumus, who had previously been bandmaster of the Music Corps for the Troops in Suriname, became director of the band. Posthumus was succeeded on 1 March 1978 by Jan van Ossenbruggen, who was then succeeded on 1 April 1986 by Pierre Kuijpers van Ossenbruggen as the first conductor of the Royal Military Band in Hague. During his tenure, he began efforts for the introduction of symphonic wind music, creating many CD recordings with the band. The Royal Military Band \\"Johan Willem Friso\\" was created in January 1995 after a period of reorganization of military music organizations, which led to the disbandment of four then existing bands within the Royal Netherlands Army. It was a result of a merger between the Hague band and the Assen band of the Johan Wilem Frisco Infantry Regiment.https://www.defensie.nl/onderwerpen/muziek/koninklijke-militaire- kapel-johan-willem-friso Musical support Bevrijdingsdag Military Parade. The Royal Military Band \\"Johan Willem Friso\\" serves primarily as the musical accompaniment at military events and ceremonial occasions within and outside the armed forces. Its musicians give concerts, tattoos and shows at home and abroad. The band provides musical support to the Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment alongside the Traditional Corps of Drums of the Grenadier Regiment and the Rifles' Guards Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps (both formations staffed by veterans and reservists), due to the few number of military bands in active service in the Dutch Army, moreover it is assisted by the Veterans' Drum and Bugle Corps of the Johan Wilem Frisco Infantry Regiment. Aside from being the official band of the Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment it supports the activities of other regiments of the Army and of the Corps of Cadets, Koninklijke Militaire Academie, alternately with the brass bands of the RNA.

Bruguera came from a family of deep anarchist convictions in a PSOE dominated town in a Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) area. By the age of nine, she was getting politically involved by joining Juventudes Libertarias. She also became involved with the women's theater group Ni Dios Ni Amo. Burguera was a 21-year-old at start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936. Pregnant with what would be her only child, she initially headed towards the Spanish-Portuguese border. With the border being closed, she traveled with family to a plot of land owned by her partner. There, her partner and mother would be killed, her brother and father had a narrow escape, and Burguera and her newborn son were captured. Burguera avoided the death penalty, and had was given a 30-year prison sentence that was reduced because of her prison labor. She was separated from her son, with authorities changing his name to that of a saint because of changes in law demanding children be named after Catholic saints. After a little over eight years behind bars, Bruguera was released from a Madrid prison in 1946. CNT militant Aureliano Lobo and Bruguera became a couple shortly after her release. During this same period, Bruguera rejoined CNT, including clandestine meetings. As CNT splintered, Bruguera found herself within a feminist faction, going on to found the Committee of Free Women () with them. From this group, Bruguera would also go on to found the second wave feminist magazine, Mujeres Libertarias. Bruguera was cremated and her ashes laid to rest at La Almudena de Madrid Cemetery following her December 1992 death from natural causes.  Background  Bruguera was an anarcho-syndicalist militant woman who served as a indefatigable fighter for her beliefs until her death in Madrid in 1992. Early on, she was involved with Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), fighting for workers' rights. Later, Bruguera became affiliated with the Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT). She was often affiliated with the anarchist movement.Chaves Rodríguez, Candela: Sentenciados. La represión franquista a través de la justicia militar y los consejos de guerra en la provincia de Badajoz. 1937-1950 .Diputación de Badajoz, PREMEX, (2015).  Youth  Bruguera was born in Jerez de los Caballeros on 6 November 1915 to Antonio Bruguera and Elisa Pérez.Miguel Iñiguez, Esbozo de una Enciclopedia histórica del anarquismo español , Fundación de Estudios Libertarios Anselmo Lorenzo, Madrid, 2001, page 103 . [ archive ] (es) Her father was Antonio Bruguera. His own parents were from Palafrugell, Catalonia through he himself was born in Extremadura. Her family held deep anarchist convictions as a result of her father having had contact with anarchist media while working as an apprentice in Seville in the cork industry. At the time of Bruguera's birth, her home town was predominantly socialist with a corporatist political setup. While her father shared his anarcho-syndicalism thinking among political circles, it took time and the community had to self-teach themselves about the movement's teachings. Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) had organized the majority of peasants and workers in the Badajoz region by the end of the 1920s. Her father served as the President of Casa del Pueblo de Jerez de los Caballeros. In her youth, there was no CNT and associated union in Jerez for her father to be affiliated with at that time. As a child, Bruguera worked in a small grocery store run by her mother. This meant she had little time to for formal education found in a school. Instead, the grocery store became her school of informal learning. While working at the store, her mother also taught her embroidery. Her obsession with learning as a child led her to spend her last years of school at a local folk high school (). By the age of nine, she left school when Juventudes Libertarias came to her town. She was joined in promoting Juventudes Libertarias by her brother Antonio and Francisco Torrado. She would become involved with Ni Dios Ni Amo, a women's artistic group she had initially admired. Working with Ni Dios Ni Amo, she brought their programming activities to local comarcas.  Spanish Civil War  The coup d'état that started Spain's Civil War started in July 1936. Burguera was a 21-year-old at the time, and pregnant with Antonio as a result of her relationship with Francisco Torrado. Antonio would be her only child. Her father and brother quickly joined the Jerez Defense Committee (). Jerez Defense Committee's immediate goal was similar to similar organizations in other towns across Spain: arrest right wing sympathizers in the town to prevent similar uprisings in their own towns. The committee in Jerez would arrest 137 members of the right. While there were no deaths initially on the left, eight members of the right died. The details of how they died were not documented. By 18 September 1936 though, Jerez fell and sixty dead were taken from the streets of the town. Bruguera and her family escaped the massacre by fascists of Jerez's Republican left. Her father escaped to the Republican area near Badajoz. Bruguera and other family members tried to cross the border into Portugal. People from Huelva and Badajoz had all taken to the road to do the same thing. Many found themselves in the Coitadinha refugee camp near Noudar on the Portuguese side of the border. Others found themselves in a camp near Mourão. While not Spain, Portugal was not viewed as entirely safe either as Portugal was viewed as looking after the Nationalists interests. Given the limited options with the border being closes, Bruguera and her family traveled to a plot of land owned by Francisco Torrado. While there, Bruguera gave birth with assistance from her mother. Guardia Civil members patrolling the countryside discovered her, murdering Torrado and Elisa Pérez, along with others in the group. Her father escaped, eventually joining Republican soldiers on the front. Her brother also escaped, only to be captured soon after.  Life in prison  Bruguera's life was spared, and she was then taken to Jerez where she, for eight days alongside her son, she was hospitalized before being moved to a prison in Badajoz for a period of a year. While her son was allowed to stay with her for the first nine months of her incarceration so she could nurse him, Antonio was eventually separated from her. He was sent to live with Torrado's parents. A new regulation from the Spanish government had come down that all children were to be named after saints. This was a result of Catholicism being brought into government as a nationalist force. The result was Antonio had his name changed to Fransisco, a change that along with the forced separation was a great blow to Bruguera. After a year in the Badajoz prison, Bruguera was tried. She was subsequently given a death sentence in December 1937 that was later commuted to thirty years in prison. Time was taken off her sentence as a result of her work sewing and embroidering. She found herself moving among several prisons, including one at the convento de la Madres Oblatas de Badajoz. While she refused to work for nuns at convent run prisons, she continued utilizing her embroidery skills. While in prison, Bruguera suffered a third blow when she learned of the death of her father. He was killed on 17 November 1939 in Badajoz. He had been captured shortly before his death while fighting on the front. Bruguera's health also started to deteriorate while in prison. Subsequently, Bruguera was then moved from prison to prison, with stays in prisons in Salamanca, Valladolid, Saturrarán and Santander. Seeking better pay and more opportunities, she requested a transfer to a prison in Madrid. While in the Madrid prison, she first made contact with women with whom she would later go on to found Mujeres Libres.  Life in Madrid  Bruguera was released from a Madrid prison in 1946, after having spent eight years and one month behind bars. Following her release, she regained custody of her son and was able to reconnect with her brother, Antonio. Antonio, like Bruguera and their father, had been arrested at the same time and event that saw Bruguera's mother and partner killed. He had been released from prison himself, a few months before his sister. The brother and sister then rented a small apartment in Madrid. Bruguera tried to establish a new life for herself, but also keep involved with her previous political activities. Bruguera soon connected with CNT militant, Aureliano Lobo. The pair would subsequently become involved, and moved into together. The relationship with Lobo gave Bruguera new energy to participate in the left wing struggle in Francoist Spain. She also continued as an activist inside the CNT. The late 1950s and early 1960s saw severe repression of CNT by Francoist Spain that made activism even more difficult. Bruguera participated in clandestine meetings of CNT. In 1976, Lobo died and Bruguera through herself into organizing the Health Committee of CNT. Around this time, along with María Carrión and Lobo's sisters, Bruguera would become involved with the Committee of Free Women (). During the mid-1980s, Bruguera was also connecting with other like minded anarcho-feminists in Madrid in this period. During this same period, CNT was splintering into different factions. Bruguera aligned herself with one of the factions. This faction, already active with the Committee of Free Women , would be at the forefront of the founding of the magazine Mujeres Libertarias. They published the first edition of their magazine in Madrid in 1986. Bruguera played a critical role behind the scenes, finding resources to support the magazine, assisting in finding distribution channels for the magazine, and providing ideas for content. The magazine represented second wave feminism. Following the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Bruguera could be more open with her activism. She also began to be recognized for her efforts for the first time, especially among anarchist and feminist media organizations. Following her death on 26 December 1992 of natural causes, her body was cremated and her ashes laid to rest at La Almudena de Madrid Cemetery. At an emotional ceremony attended by family members and fellow compatriots, her life struggle to assist other women and workers was viewed as being part of her generous to devotion to others. Mujeres Libertarias No. 14 published in 1993 was dedicated in her honor. It would be one of its final editions, dissolving not long after her death.

Polanski maintained that Uziel, through his website, www.imetpolanski.com, falsely reported that five women had come forward to accuse him of raping them. Polanski was suing for libel and defamation of character. Herzliya Magistrates' Court rejected Polanski's request to be exempt from appearing in court after filing the libel suit. While Polanski gave various reasons for his inability to appear, the presiding judge, Gilad Hess, dismissed these one by one and ordered Polanski to pay Uziel ₪10,000 in costs. In November 2018, it was published that Polanski decided to drop the lawsuit, and was ordered by the court to pay Uziel ₪30,000 (US$8,000) for court costs. The court accepted Uziel's request that the suit not be dropped, but rather that it be rejected, making Polanski unable to sue Uziel again over the same issue in the future. In late December 2019, in Polanski's interviews with Paris Match and Gazeta Wyborcza, Polanski accused Uziel of carefully orchestrating the attacks on his character and for playing a major role in designing an international campaign to besmirch his name and reputation in order to make his career fall from grace.

Biography  Filippenko was born in Kerch, where he lived for the first 30 years of his life. He worked as a crane operator in a port, when one day he fell off from a great height, receiving serious injuries (about 17 fractures). During treatment, his wife, believing that he would remain disabled for life, filed for divorce. However, he recovered, but Vasily became hostile towards the opposite sex. In 1966, he moved to Leningrad, where he also got a job as a crane operator at a port, living in a dorm room with a propiska. At work, he was characterized as positive, and was part of the Voluntary People's Druzhina. = Crimes = In 1967, in the Obvodny Canal area, Filippenko began attacking women in the evening. When investigating the crimes, it was suggested that the maniac chose as victims those women whom he saw at the time of parting with another man. The first crime was committed on the night of May 23–24, 1967. The victim of the maniac was 19-year-old \\"Red Triangle\\" factory worker Nina Petukhova. While giving his testimony during the investigation, Filippenko stated: the future victim, after parting with the sailor accompanying her, decided to meet him herself while standing on the embankment of the Obvodny Canal; they reached the round-the-clock kindergarten located near the Canal and the women's hostel of the Red Triangle plant; during a conversation on the territory of the kindergarten, the girl reminded him of his ex-wife, and so he beat, raped and then strangled her. On the night of the murder, the on-duty kindergarten teachers heard the girl's screams, but thought they were unimportant. Two hairs belonging to the killer were found in the girl's right hand. The rapist's sperm was also detected, by which his blood type was determined. The suspect became a merchant seaman named Sergei Sergeyev, with whom Petukhova had met on May 23. An hour after breaking up with the girl, he went back to his ship, which heightened the police's suspicions. When Sergeyev arrived on the ship, information came that the law enforcement officers were interested in him - he was then isolated and after returning to the port, he was transferred to the officers of the criminal investigation department and the prosecutor's office. But soon after, Sergeyev was released, as his blood type and hair samples did not coincide with thouse found at the murder scene; the kindergarten teachers on duty at night said that they had heard Petukhova's cries around midnight, and she had broken up with him an hour earlier, which was confirmed by the records in the ship's journal. During an interrogation, Sergeyev said that before parting with Petukhova, he saw a man in a hat and a raincoat on the bridge over the Obvodny Canal - it later turned out to be Filippenko. In July, Filippenko committed a new attack. The maniac's second victim also met him at night in the area of the Obvodny Canal, as he had proposed to conduct the meeting. Not far from the girl's house, he beat, strangled her unconscious and then raped her, but did not murder the girl (or possibly couldn't). The investigators suggested that the offender lived in the Obvodny Canal area, and cards were taken from passport offices. The surviving victim was shown photos taken in the Obvodny Canal area, and she identified the attacker as 24-year-old worker Igor Vorobyev, who was arrested. Expertises showed that his blood group coincided with that of the murderer, but his hair sample did not match up with the one found on Petukhova's murder scene. Despite this fact, Vorobyev was accused of rape, but wasn't charged with the murder of Nina Petukhova as there was insufficient evidence. The testimony of his wife, who claimed that he was at home on the night of the crime, was ignored. Four months later, the court sentenced Vorobyev to 6 in prison, but he continued to deny his guilt. The fact that between the arrest of Vorobyev and his trial, the real maniac two more crimes was not taken into account. In law enforcement, it was decided not to link the second crime with the previous and subsequent attacks on women in the Obvodny Canal area, and the blood type coincidence was declared accidental. Even before Vorobyev's trial, an incident occurred in Leningrad, calling into question the testimony of the maniac's surviving victim. In September 1967, an LPI student was arrested in the Lenin Park, who had attacked and tried to strangle his friend. Although this attack was not similar to the crimes in the Obvodny Canal area, the arrested was checked for involved in Petukhova's murder, but his blood type did not match. However, he was presented at a police lineup to the surviving victim, in which she, again, recognized the attacker. It later turned out that the victim suffered from myopia, but did not wear glasses. This fact was not taken into account, and the Vorobyev case was brought to court. The next murder was committed on the territory of the Botkin Hospital. His victim was 25-year-old nurse Tatyana Kuznetsova, who was on duty that night. On the hospital grounds, the maniac found her accidentally: he was chasing another woman, but he lost sight of her - she entered one of the buildings of the hospital. Then, in the courtyard, Filippenko attacked Kuznetsova, raping and then strangling her. Unlike previous episodes, when the maniac did not touch the victim's belongings, this time he took the money from the nurse's handbag. The woman that escaped noticed that she was being pursued and turned to police in the morning, but her application was not accepted. Initially, the murder of Tatyana Kuznetsova was not associated with the murder of Nina Petukhova, the hospital staff and patients were checked for any involvement. Only when the tests did not produce results, the investigation drew attention to the similarity of details in both episodes. Filippenko committed the fourth crime on the night of October 18, on this day there was a flood in Leningrad and the city streets were practically deserted. On the embankment of the Obvodny Canal, he attacked Galina Ivanova, dragging her to a nearby construction site, where she was raped and strangled with her own tights. After the third murder, the investigators began to check previously convicted for sexual offences and those registered in psychoneurological dispensaries. Police and people's guards began to patrol the area of the Obvodny Canal. Attempts were made to catch the maniac with \\"live bait\\". The Leningrad City Committee of the CPSU allowed for limited information to be published in the newspapers and on the radio about the criminal situation in the city. In the same month, Filippenko committed a new crime in the Obvodny Canal area, his victim being LTI student Faina Anchak. He attacked a girl near her home, raping and then attempted to strangle her. As the examination established, Anchak could've survived, but during the strangulation the offender broke her hyoid bone, which caused her trachea to swell. As a result of the injury, the girl could not call for help and died from suffocation. The next murder caused dissatisfaction with the party leadership of the city. In the city committee, they demanded that the prosecutor's office and the police find the criminal within three days. The number of patrols in the Obvodny Canal area was increased, and attempts to catch the maniac with \\"live bait\\" were renewed. In early November, on Nevsky Prospect, the druzhinniks detained and took to the police station 26-year-old Viktor Danilov, who attacked women on the street. The detainee belonged to the \\"golden youth\\" category (his father held a senior position in the urban construction sector, and his mother was a famous doctor in Leningrad), who had no job. It was revealed that he suffered from mental retardation. Three hours after his arrest, he was released, but was left under secret police surveillance. A few days later, a search and seizure was conducted on Danilov's apartment, during which porn magazines were found and a collection of curls from female hair, which the suspect cut off from women whom he pestered on the street. Danilov was detained again and presented for identification to the maniac's surviving victim. The victim confirmed that the detainee was had molested her on the same day, but she had met him before meeting her the maniac. However, the investigator forced the girl to change her testimony and for the third time she \\"identified her abuser\\". Danilov was rearrested, and an examination determined that he coincidentally had the same blood type as the maniac. Under pressure from the investigators, he confessed to attacking women in the Obvodny Canal area, and even wrote a confession. The party leadership of Leningrad subsequently announced that they had captured the maniac. At this time, Filippenko struck again, killing a fish shop saleswoman named Valentina Stennikova. This time, he threw the victim's body into the Obvodny Canal. After the body's discovery, the examination established that the girl had been raped and killed. It was found that the same maniac, who supposedly had been captured, had committed the murder. Fearing a scandal, the results of the examination were falsified, and the mention of rape was removed. Instead, it was announced that Stennikova had been intoxicated and had committed suicide. A criminal case was denied. The girl's parents tried to protest the refusal in the prosecutor's office and at the CPSU city committee, but without success. = Arrest, trial and punishment = At the beginning of 1968, Filippenko, using a trade union voucher, went to Yalta. There, he was arrested when he tried to rape and strangle the sanatorium maid, and was placed at a detention center in Simferopol. In the cell, he told his cellmate, who was a police informant, about his crimes in Leningrad. This information was sent to Leningrad, from where investigators were sent to Simferopol to interrogate the confessor. During interrogation, Filippenko spoke in detail about the five Leningrad murders in the area of Obvodny Canal, reporting on many significant details that no outsider could know about. The offender was taken to Leningrad, where his testimony was checked and fixed during investigative experiments. In addition, it turned out that Filippenko, as a druzhinnik, helped the police search for the maniac, and in effect, was searching for himself. The criminal case against the mentally retarded Viktor Danilov, who had implicated himself, was discontinued and he was released. The condemned Igor Vorobyev was released from detention and rehabilitated. For the errors committed, six employees of the prosecutor's office were dismissed. Filippenko tried to avoid the court by pretending to be insane, but a comprehensive forensic psychiatric examination found him to be sane. In the same 1968, the court sentenced Vasily Filippenko to death through firing squad. In November, the sentence was carried out.

Floodlights were installed in 1960 and several plans were made to increase facilities at the ground, including installing a swimming pool and building office blocks or a hotel, but none came to fruition. The club's first floodlit game was against Wisbech Town on 21 September 1960, with the official opening coming in a friendly against Norwich City on 3 October 1960. In 1997, the site was sold to developers and the club had to move out of Chelmsford. Greyhound racing On the 23 September 1927 the London and Provincial Greyhound Racing Company bought land in Chelmsford to build a track but stiff opposition resulted and the planned construction failed to materialise. However, on the 20 May 1932 the Mid-Essex Greyhound Racing Club raced for the first time at the stadium on New Writtle Street, home to Chelmsford Football Club and next door to the County Cricket Ground. One year later director AH Bradbury-Pratt began regular racing on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday evenings over 440 and 550 yards. The racing continued irregularly during the years 1935 to 1937 before finishing. A second spell of racing was submitted for planning by promoter Flight-Lieut CR Thomas in March 1946, finally starting in 1949 but once again the racing only lasted a few years. On both occasions the racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club).

It is the third novel in a trilogy, following The Rotters’ Club (2001) and The Closed Circle (2004). The novel explores the experiences of characters from those earlier novels against the backdrop of the major events taking place before, during and after the Brexit referendum.  Characters  Benjamin Trotter: At the start of the novel, Benjamin is happily divorced from Cicely and lives in semi-retirement in Shropshire, having become fairly wealthy in London prior to the housing crisis. Since the events of The Closed Circle, he no longer speaks to his brother Paul. * Colin Trotter: After the death of his wife Sheila, Colin moves in with his son Benjamin. During the course of the novel, he begins to experience the psychological effects of old age. * Lois Potter (née Trotter): Lois continues to experience trauma as a result of the Birmingham pub bombings, where her then-boyfriend was killed shortly after proposing to her in The Rotters' Club. She lives separately from her husband Christopher and isn't in love with him, but cannot bring herself to admit this. * Christopher Potter: Despite being married to Lois, Christopher lives separately from his wife and is happy when he discovers that his daughter, Sophie, temporarily moves in with him. * Sophie Potter: Near the beginning of the novel, Sophie has to attend a driving safety class as a result of being caught speeding, and she falls in love with Ian, one of the instructors. She works as a lecturer in art history. * Ian: Ian is a driving safety instructor. He meets Sophie at one of his classes and eventually becomes her husband. * Helena: Helena is Ian's mother. Her political views become a point of tension with Sophie and, to a lesser extent, Ian. She is Eurosceptic and anti-immigration, at one point showing solidarity with the views expressed by Enoch Powell in his infamous Rivers of Blood speech. * Doug Anderton: Doug is a left-wing journalist who primarily writes op-eds for The Guardian and other publications. Despite growing up in a staunchly socialist family, Doug is married to an heiress and lives in Chelsea. He attended school with Benjamin and Philip in the 1970s. * Philip Chase: Benjamin and Doug's friend from secondary school. In Middle England, Philip runs his own publishing house, creating artbooks that contain archival images of British towns and cities. He offers to help Benjamin edit and publish his novel. * Claire Newman: Ex-wife of Philip. Claire attended King William's Sixth Form with Benjamin, Doug and Philip, and she continues to keep in contact with them. * Charlie Chappell: Benjamin's childhood friend. Although he attended a different secondary school to Benjamin, they rekindle their friendship as adults. Charlie works as a children's entertainer, performing as a clown. * Ronald Culpepper: Culpepper was in the same year as Benjamin, Doug and Philip at King William's School. At the time, he expressed racist views towards a black classmate of theirs; by the time of the novel, he has become the leader of a group called Imperium, a right-wing think tank focused on English nationalism. * Sohan: Sophie's Sri Lankan colleague. After same sex couples are given the right to get married in the UK, Sophie attends the wedding of Sohan and his partner. Other characters from Coe's previous works appear in the novel including author Lionel Hampshire and his assistant Hermione (from his short story \\"Canadians Can't Flirt\\", collected in Tales from a Master’s Notebook), while characters from The Rotters’ Club and The Closed Circle, such as Cicely Boyd and Paul Trotter, are mentioned in passing.  Development  In an author's note at the end of the novel, Coe states that there were two main inspirations behind his desire to revisit the characters from his earlier novels. After an interview with the novelist Alice Adams, in which she praised The Closed Circle, he entered into a correspondence with her, and “her enthusiasm” persuaded him that he “should revisit these abandoned characters”. In addition, after seeing Richard Cameron's theatrical adaptation of The Rotters’ Club, he became aware of the importance of the importance of Benjamin and Lois's relationship to the series of novels, and felt the desire to explore it further. In addition, Coe states that the character of Emily Shamma is named after a woman who made the winning bid to have a character in Coe's next novel named after her at an auction for the charity Freedom from Torture. Coe incorporated information about the origin of Shamma's name into the novel. In an article he wrote for The Guardian a few days before the publication of the novel, the author stated that he “wanted to convey a strong and specific sense of the texture of English public life in the last eight years”. Although he had many doubts about whether or not this would affect the longevity of the novel, he ultimately concluded that it was important for novelists to focus on contemporary events, since their works become “vital resources in trying to understand what happened”.  Reception  Alex Preston, writing for The Guardian, felt that Coe's use of characters spanning multiple generations, covering almost a decade in British history, made him “the first author to address our current crisis of national identity using the form that feels most suited to the task”, contrasting the novelist's work with contemporaneous efforts by Ali Smith and Amanda Craig. InThe Irish Times, John Boyne ended his review by saying: “Millions of words have been and will be written on Brexit but few will get to the heart of why it is happening as incisively as Middle England.” A number of reviewers compared Coe's series of novels to the works of Anthony Powell, with Ian Sansom calling it “the closest thing we have to a contemporary middle-class, middle-England Dance to the Music of Time”. Both Preston and Sam Leith, however, felt that the novel's closeness to contemporary events created flaws in the narrative, with the former saying the ending felt “slightly cobbled together”, while the latter described the novel as a whole as “less than completely successful” in its attempt to depict the state of the nation. Some reviewers questioned how relevant the more overtly political aspects of the novel would be outside the time of its publication, with Leith saying that “certain passages of exposition feel clunky” as a result of Coe's attempt to explain contemporary events such the rise of European populism and advocacy for the Kalergi plan conspiracy theory. Regarding Coe's political stance, Leith felt that it was a “great big Centrist Dad of a novel” that only asks the reader to sympathise with people who voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. In his review for Prospect, Ian Sansom called it a “brilliant Brexit novel”, but noted that “everyone who votes for Brexit in the novel [...] is portrayed as either mildly or explicitly racist, and at least a little bit stupid.” By comparison, Jonathan Derbyshire of the Financial Times noted that Coe's writing was interesting for its “ambivalent embrace” of Englishness despite the author's professed Eurocentrism, while Allan Massie in The Scotsman praised the author for showing “abundant sympathy for his characters” and recognizing that “much of the anger at political correctness and the resentment of people who feel no longer at home in their own country [isn’t] unjustified.” Many critics praised the quality of Coe's prose, plotting, characterization and humour. Leith called it “as smoothly accomplished as ever” and praised the humour of the author's set pieces. In his review for The Spectator, Jon Day commended Coe's “slick and precise” prose, along with the author's skill in handling transitions between scenes. However, he felt that while the novelist writes “compelling, humane and funny novels”, the lack of experimentation in his otherwise pleasurable style “confirms rather than challenges” the reader's prejudices. By comparison, Mark Lawson, writing for Literary Review, felt that Coe had evolved from a more experimental mode to a “low-key prose” style with a “talent for characterisation and captivating narrative”, and that this transformation is echoed in the scene in the novel where “Benjamin’s vast postmodern masterwork becomes, during an editing session, a conventional novella” that goes on to be nominated for the Booker Prize.

Hurd. At the time, it was one of the few resources for vegetarian and vegan cooks. The cookbook promotes Christian vegetarianism and a Bible-based diet, in keeping with teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. By 1991, the 750-recipe cookbook was entering its 44th printing and had sold more than 250,000 copies. An expanded edition with more than 1,000 recipes was issued in 2012. Title The title refers to a quote from Ellen White, a founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church: \\"The one who understands the art of properly preparing food, and who uses this knowledge, is worthy of higher commendation than those engaged in any other line of work. This talent should be regarded as equal in value to ten talents\\", which references the Parable of the Talents. Description The 1968 edition consisted of 750 plant-based, whole food recipes for adults and infants, along with glossaries of natural ingredients, tables of equivalents, nutritional information charts, natural remedies, and an outline of the Seventh-Day Adventist \\"prescription for health\\", or Christian vegetarianism. The book promotes a diet based on the Bible; and the covers of the various editions all depict author Hurd reading from a Bible. Numerous recipes using soybean products such as soy pulp, soy milk powder, and soy flour are featured. According to Shurtleff and Aoyagi, Ten Talents is the first cookbook to feature recipes for soy milk ice cream shakes and the earliest to have a recipe for soy sour cream. Only one chapter includes recipes with animal products—namely, milk and eggs—\\"for those who are in the transitional period\\", the authors note. The book published some of the first recipes for granola, familia and cashew milk. It used nutritional yeast and soy sauce for flavor. It relied heavily on loaves, fritters, and patties. Publishing history The cookbook was originally self-published in May 1968. It was updated in 1985; at that time it was published by College Press of Collegedale, Tennessee. In 1991, it was entering its 44th printing and had sold more than 250,000 copies. The cookbook was expanded in 2012 to encompass more than 1,000 recipes. In 2014 the cookbook was in its 48th printing. It has always been published in a spiral binding. Jonathan Kauffman, writing in Hippie Food (2018) said it sold hundreds of thousands of copies. Reception In 1971 the Santa Cruz Sentinel called the book \\"one of the very few completely natural foods cookbooks\\", and in 1977 the North American Vegetarian Society recommended the book as an encyclopedia of vegetarian cooking. In 1994 Vegetarian Times named it to their list of \\"Cookbooks You Can't Live Without\\" as a runner-up to the category of \\"Best Cookbooks for Beginners\\", saying it had been one of the few resources for vegetarian cooks in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was still one of the best general references. The 2004 Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets called it the classic Seventh-day Adventist cookbook. In 2017 Washington Post Food Editor Joe Yonan listed it as one of three \\"must-have classic vegetarian cookbooks\\". Vegan teacher and cookbook author Victoria Moran wrote that it was one of only two vegan cookbooks she had been able to find when she first started exploring veganism in the 1970s. =Critical reviews= In 1976 Connie I. Dahlke, Chief Therapeutic Dietician at Boulder Memorial Hospital, sent a letter reviewing the book to the bookstore manager at the Colorado Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists in Denver; copies had been forwarded to hospital and university nutrition and home economics department heads and to the authors. The letter contained a 21-point negative review of the cookbook and asked that it be removed from sale. Among the criticisms were the book's preference for raw sugar and honey over brown sugar and refined white sugar; the claim that \\"sunflower seeds, almonds and coconut are 'valuable sources' of Vitamin D...when in fact they contain no Vitamin D\\"; and an assertion that \\"monstrous statements about the ingredients of ice cream...and objections to meat eating...reveal emotionalism and poor judgment\\". The authors reportedly responded to the criticisms by \\"making many changes\\" in the text before the next reprinting. A 1977 article in Canadian Adventist Messenger said that a review by dieticians, pharmacists, and physicians found the dietary and medical advice contained in the book was unsound and advised readers to view it with caution. A subsequent article in the same source said the book was being re-edited to clarify the information. Awards The cookbook won a Silver Medal in the Cooking/Natural category at the 2009 Living Now Book Awards. Authors Rosalie Hurd (b. April 1937) is a nutritionist and home economist. Frank Hurd (b. March 1936) is a doctor of chiropractic and medicine. They are Seventh-Day Adventists and proponents of Christian vegetarianism, and met at Atlantic Union College, a now-defunct Seventh-Day Adventist institution. At the time of the book's first publication they lived in Chisholm, Minnesota, and ran a health-food store and sold a breakfast cereal called \\"Get Up and Go\\". As of 2014 they lived in Fountain City, Wisconsin.

Biography  Very little is known about the life of Igor Chernat before his murders. It is known that he was born in Odessa, and that he studied at the Velikodolinskaya Secondary School Nmb. 1 in the Odessa Oblast. After graduating from 8th grade, he entered a vocational school. He lived on Pionerskoy Street, and studied as a driver in the DOSAAF. In 1985, he was drafted into the ranks of the Soviet Army, where he served as an IFV driver. He served in the village of Kamenka, as part of the 138th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade.  Murders  Chernat committed his first murder in November 1985, of which he told only after his arrest. In March 1986, the maniac went hunting again. His second victim was Yevgeniya Nazarova, who had come to visit her soldier husband, who was at that time in the medical unit's infirmary. Chernat led the girl from the checkpoint and raped her, then killed her in a fishing line. In mid-April 1986, Chernat committed his third murder. The victim this time was Viktoria Bykovskaya, the mother of one of the soldiers, who was bringing food to her son in the military unit. Soon after, the maniac committed his fourth murder. The victim was, again, the wife of one of the soldiers, Elena Ivanova. However, this time the pair were observed by a Pvt. Zhevolyuk, who told of how he saw the victim on the day of the murder with a soldier, heading to the nearest forest. Chernat sold everything that he stole from his victims in the market of Vyborg.  Investigation and trial  Large-scale inspections began in all military units in Kamenka, as a result of which monstrous facts were revealed about the situation there: desertion, theft, dedovshchina, etc. During the inspection, one of the soldiers suspected of stealing military property said that Chernat had stolen most and nothing would happen to him. The accused was interrogated, but escaped that same night. He moved back to Odessa, where he tried to make new documents for himself, but he realized that it would fail. And then Chernat went to the police, where he stated that he was the maniac responsible for the murders. He was transported to Leningrad, where he soon began to testify. The military tribunal of the Leningrad Military District sentenced Igor Chernat to an exceptional measure of punishment - the death penalty through firing squad. In October 1987, the sentence was carried out.

Biography  Since childhood, Gritsenko grew up a closed and unsociable person. His father was a carpenter, while his mother was a strong and strict woman. Psychiatrists are confident that this led to the development of a misogynistic complex in Yuri. After serving in the army, Gritsenko began working for the militsiya (Soviet police), believing that his profession would quash his self-doubt. He soon married and had two children born, but the complex persisted. Understanding this, Gritsenko became addicted to alcohol. During this time, everything negative splashed out of him, which, in the end, turned him into a murderer. After some time, he was fired from the police forces for his drunkenness, after which he committed a murder and received 8 years of imprisonment. According to the killer, his victim was a prostitute who wanted to rob him, and which he killed her with a blow from a frying pan. When Gritsenko returned from the colony, his family was almost completely broken up. Since the beginning of April 2001, Gritsenko began attacking women. He struck his victims with a hammer, causing traumatic brain injuries. In just three days in April, he attacked five women, two of which the doctors couldn't save. The survivors couldn't described the criminal, since he always struck from behind. Gritsenko committed all his attacks in Zelenograd's urban forest during the day, when people were returning from work. He loved to walk around in the park, especially in the area of Lake Chernoe. He temporarily laid low for a while, but in August he resumed his attacks. During this time, he inflicted severe head injuries on four women. Local newspapers began pressuring the authorities, and facial composites were hung throughout Zelenograd. By the beginning of autumn, Gritsenko had committed 4 murders and 5 attempted murders in Zelenograd Forest Park. At the time, he again laid low, but on October 19, 2001, he attacked another woman, this time in the Northern Administrative Okrug of Moscow. Within a week, he beat three more women with a hammer. But soon one of the victims resisted him, snatching the hammer away and escaping her assailant. She then clearly described her attacker's appearance. On November 19, 2001, the maniac was detained during another attack on a woman in Moscow's Friendship Park. To her help suddenly came a young man, who heard her cries. Gritsenko, leaving the seriously injured woman, pounced with the hammer on her saviour, but couldn't kill him. Anatoly Sukhov, who was a bus driver, wounded the killer and waited for the arrival of the authorities. During the eight months of his criminal activities, Gritsenko had committed 4 murders and 10 attempted murders on women. He soon admitted to his crimes. A forensic psychiatric examination in April 2002 found him fully sane. In the summer of 2002, the Moscow City Court sentenced Yuri Gritsenko to 22 years imprisonment, with the Supreme Court of Russia upholding the sentence. = In the media = Documentary film from the series \\"Documentary Detective\\" - 'Zelenograd Chikatilo' See also List of Russian serial killers  References  Yuri Gritsenko * Comrade Sukhov declared war on the bandits People from Zelenograd Russian serial killers Living people 1962 births Male serial killers ","title":"Yuri Gritsenko"},{"id":"59994548","text":"Harold Everett (13 November 1891 – 27 April 1979) was an English first-class cricketer and civil servant.

On 13 September 2018, Thomas Zurbuchen of NASA signed a Pre-Phase A partnership agreement, with Breakthrough Prize Foundation's chairman Pete Worden to jointly create the mission concept and plan. The mission is the first privately funded deep space mission, and if launched as planned prior to New Frontiers Ocean Worlds and Europa Clipper, it has the potential to be the first to discover the existence of ocean dwelling extra-terrestrial life. The flyby mission proposes to search for microbes in the plumes of water that are being ejected from Enceladus's warm ocean, veiled under a layer of ice crust on its south pole.

Pakistan Levies is an umbrella term for the various Levies Forces which operate under their own separate chains of command and wear distinct patches and badging. About The Levies are locally recruited but federally funded and are covered in the Federal Levies Force (Service) Rules of 2012, and the Federal Levies Force (Amended) Service Rules, 2013. Organization The Command authority of Each Levies Force is as follows The Commandant or Commandant of the Force, is the Political Agent of the Agency or the District Coordination Officer for the local Frontier Region; the Commandant is assisted by two Deputy-Commandants: * \\"Deputy Commandant (Operations)\\" means an Assistant Political Agent of a Sub- Division or an Agency or FR or any officer of the District designated as such officer by the Provincial Government, who shall be Deputy Commandant (Operations) of the Force in their respective jurisdiction to exercise such powers and functions as may be prescribed; and * \\"Deputy Commandant (Administration)\\" means an officer of Federal or Provincial civil service or any officer of the District designated as such officer by the Provincial Government in their respective jurisdiction to exercise such powers and functions as may be prescribed and who shall be responsible to the Commandant for administrative and establishment matters of the Force. The Director- General is an officer appointed by the Federal Government, to exercise such powers and functions as may be prescribed; Director is appointed as such by the FATA Secretariat who shall have practical experience of civil administration in tribal areas and who shall exercise such powers and functions as may be prescribed. Forces =Balochistan= The Balochistan Levies operate in the Pakistani province of Balochistan where it serves as one of two primary law enforcement agencies tasked with maintaining law and order in the province. The levies force has jurisdiction in most districts of Balochistan. The force has approximately 23,132 personnel in 2018 and traces its origins back to the days of the British Raj, and has continued to function for over a century. It is headed by a director-general and is mostly constituted by local security personnel, including Baloch and Pashtun officers. During the regime of Pervez Musharraf, the Balochistan Levies had been disbanded and merged into the provincial police force. It was restored in 2010. Areas which are manned by and are under the control of the Levies are called \\"B-Areas\\" which constitute around 90% of the total area of Balochistan while those under the control of the Balochistan Police are dubbed \\"A-Areas\\" i.e around 10% . The levies have been praised for their efficiency and reliability compared to the police force; this is attributed to the fact that it predominantly consists of local officers who are familiar with and well accustomed to the political and law and order landscape of Balochistan, thus fulfilling the concept of community policing, whereas the police force predominantly consists of non-locals. It is also in charge of more areas as compared to the police, and yet has a lower budget, rendering it the \\"cheapest available law enforcement agency\\". However, many critics have contended that the force has been used by Baloch tribal chiefs to serve their own interests. The force has often been targeted by militants involved in the insurgency in Balochistan. =Khyber Pakhtunkhwa= The Levies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa operate between the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (PATA),kp.gov.pk/uploads/2016/02/49._Provincially_Administered_Tribal_Areas_Levies_Force_Regulation,_2012_.pdf and settled areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa known as the Frontier Regions (FR). Different from the khasadars, often referred to as tribal police who are appointed by tribal authorities, the Levies are appointed by the political administration on merit basis and are given arms and ammunition by the government. The 2018 sanctioned strength of KP levies was 11,739 personnel. The various Levies in KP report to Secretary Home and Tribal Affairs of KP.

The march was composed by Estonian musician Eero Liives (1892-1978). Today the march is played by the Kaitseväe Orkester during military reviews of troops such as the Estonian Honour Guard during state visits and the Eesti Kaitsevägi during military parades in Tallinn. On January 27, 1923, it was adopted as the military march by of the Estonian Head of State. Prior to that, Björneborgarnas marsch (known in Estonian as Porilaste marss) was used as a presidential song. The government chose to abandon the natively Swedish march, to differentiate itself from Finland, which also uses it as an honorary march. The march is still used as official honorary music for high-ranking officials. The march would be performed for the last time in 4 decades on Independence Day in 1940, due to the German and later Soviet occupation of Estonia taking place in the following four years.

In 1995, Larry Froistad murdered his five year-old daughter, Amanda Froistad. After he set their North Dakota home on fire while she was inside, Larry confessed to the crime on an email list with two hundred members. Only a few reported him. This incident has been seen an example of what has been called an online version of the bystander effect. In addition, the incident has been described as a notable failure of child welfare. Though a therapist reported that Larry had sexually abused Amanda; the authorities of South Dakota, where the therapist practiced, and of North Dakota, where Amanda lived, did not coordinate with each other and failed to protect her. Background In mid-1994, Amanda's aggressive conduct at daycare concerned her providers. Amanda's mother, Ann Purdy, took her to a counselor to find out why she was acting that way. The first thing Amanda told the counselor was that she was being molested by her father, Larry Froistad. The counselor, as required by law, reported the molestation to South Dakota's Child Welfare Agency. Because the molestation happened in another state, North Dakota, and because of bureaucratic incompetence, the case was not correctly followed up with the authorities, and Larry was not punished nor denied access to his daughter even though he sexually abused her. Incident In 1995, heavily inebriated Larry Froistad set his house on fire while five-year-old Amanda Froistad was trapped inside. He then climbed out the window. His daughter started screaming; after a while, the screams stopped. Larry then entered the house again, picked up his daughter, and put her outside the house. He then called the police and pretended to be upset over his daughter's death. Even though the death seemed unusual, the police did not prosecute Larry because the police personally knew Larry and could not believe he would murder someone. Confession In 1998, Froistad posted a confession of his murder on an online email list. There were many different responses to his email. Some said it was a long time ago and some said he was fantasizing this as a result of feeling guilt over his divorce. Only three of the approximately 200 members of the email list reported the confession to legal authorities. The incident has been studied as an online version of the bystander effect. Larry Froistad had also confessed to molesting his daughter to an online group of pedophiles. Sentencing In a plea deal, Larry Froistad pleaded guilty to both murder and child molestation. He was sentenced to 30 years of prison time, eligible for parole in 2024. Reaction Author Jeffrey Schaler expressed dismay over the failure of leadership of the online group Larry confessed on (a group called Moderation Management for people with drinking problems who try to drink moderately) to condemn member Larry Froistad after he admitted his murder in 1998. Because of the Froistad murder and subsequent controversy, Schaler recommended that psychiatrists let their patients know early on that knowledge of a felony involving direct harm to others would cause the presumption of doctor patient confidentiality to be waived.

Work at the Ural State University In 1951, after graduating from PhD course, he defended his thesis on the topic “The Effect of Small Elastic Stresses on the Initial Susceptibility of Ferromagnetics http://elar.urfu.ru/bitstream/10995/2488/1/trud_1958.pdf Materials to the bibliography of printed works of teachers of the Ural University”. In 1950-1971 he worked as an assistant professor, then associate professor first of the Chair of Experimental Physics, then of the Chair of Magnetism (since 1958) of the Physics Department of the Ural State University. The subject of study was the influence of the real (defective) crystal structure on the magnetic properties of magnetic materials, including those with rare-earth components. The phenomenological quantitative laws of the effect of the dislocations on the domain structure and the magnetic properties of electrical steels were established. In 1954–1955, Professor Jakov Shur and Associate Professor D. D. Mishin with graduate students investigated on the order of the Verkh-Isetsk Metallurgical Plant the nature for the uniformity of the magnetic properties of transformer steel along a sheet. D. D. Mishin was one of the founders and managers (1962-1971) of the Problem Laboratory of Permanent Magnets (PLPM) in the Ural State University (presently, the Solid State Magnetism Department of the Research Institute of Physics and Applied Mathematics. In 1969, the joint research work of the PLPM with the Pyshma Experimental Plant resulted in the organization of an experimental site for the production of permanent magnets based on rear earth metals-cobalt alloys. The first magnets were made only by pressing the original powder, later a special powder sintering technology was developed and applied, which made it possible to improve the magnetic and operational properties of permanent magnets. In 1970, D. D. Mishin defended his doctoral (habilitation) dissertation on the topic: \\"The Effect of Dislocation Structure on the Susceptibility and Coercive Force of Siliceous Iron.\\" Work at Tver State University In 1971, D.D.Mishin moved to Kalinin and began working at the Kalinin State University (KSU), transformed in the same year from a Pedagogical Institute to the University. In 1972, he organized the Department of Magnetism at the Faculty of Physics of KSU. In PhD theses, his PhD students investigated the processes of magnetization reversal in rare-earth metal alloys (Sm, Pr, Nd, Dy, etc.) with metals of iron and boron groups. A method of fabrication of permanent magnets with sufficiently improved properties has been developed, the laws governing the changes in the domain structure during various effects on permanent magnets have been established. The implementation of the results of his work in the industry was noted by gold and silver medals of Soviet Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy in 1987-1990. In 1988, by the decision of the USSR Academy of Sciences, the XVIII All-Union Conference on the Physics of Magnetic Phenomena was held at the base of the Department of Magnetism in Tver.XVIII All-Union Conference on the Physics of Magnetic Phenomena [3-6 oct. 1988 — Kalinin: KSU In 1996, D. D. Mishin became an honorary professor at Tver State University. Scientific and educational activities D. D. Mishin's research interests were in the field of physics of magnetic phenomena, the physical properties of rare earth metals, their alloys and compounds, the processes of formation of a highly coercive state in new hard magnetic materials, the experimental production of high-energy permanent magnets. Under the leadership of D. D. Mishin, 2 doctors (habilitate) and 20 candidate of physical and mathematical sciences (PhD) were trained in the department. He developed new special courses: the physics of magnetic phenomena, the physics of real crystals, the physics of magnetic materials, the influence of physical factors on the properties of permanent magnets, and current problems of magnetism.

It is also known in English as Responses to the Commandments, and in German as Zum Abendsegen. It was published in 1842, both in English and German, and by Breitkopf & Härtel in 1875 in the complete edition of the composer's works.  History  Mendelssohn composed the motet in 1833 for use in the Anglican Church. The first line in English is \\"Lord, have mercy upon us\\", an anonymous response to the Commandments from the Book of Common Prayer. The motet was published by Ewer in London c. 1842 as Lord Have Mercy upon Us / Responses to the Commandments. In German, the first line is \\"Herr, sei gnädig unserm Flehn\\" (Lord, be merciful to our plea). It was published by Bösenberg in Leipzig in an Album für Gesang as Zum Abendsegen (For the evening blessing), which was erroneously translated as To the Evening Service. The motet was published by Breitkopf & Härtel in 1875 in their complete edition of the composer's works.  Text and music  The text is based on traditional anonymous Responses to the Comandments in the Book of Common Prayer, which read: Mendelssohn's wording is slightly different: \\"Herr, sei gnädig unserm Flehn, neig unser Herz zu deinem Wort, und schreibe dein Gebot ins Herz, das dich suchet.\\" (Lord, have mercy to our plea, turn our hearts to your word, and inscribe your commandment in the heart that seeks you.) The music is in one movement in A minor and common time, marked Andante. The piece begins with two long chords like a call, both with fermatas, \\"Herr! Herr!\\" (Lord! Lord!). The tenor than begins a theme for a fugal development, reminiscent of the style of Renaissance polyphony, followed by alto, soprano and bass. The words \\"Herr\\" and \\"gnädig\\" (merciful\\" are accented by a melisma, the former a rising melody, the latter with an upward tritone for added intensity. A slow chromatic upward scale appears first in the alto in measures 25 and 26, again intesifying \\"gnädig\\", repeated by the sopranos. It is immediately followed by \\"und schreibe dein Gebot ins Herz\\" (and inscribe your commandment to the heart), the only section in homophony. When this text is repeated, the first theme is used again in imitation, first by the alto. The piece ends with the chromatic scales, now on \\"Herz\\" (heart). It has been characterized as with \\"a poignant intensity arising out of his subtle (and supple) handling of contrapuntally overlapping textures\\". Robert Schumann used elements from the theme in the slow movement of his first Piano Trio in D minor, Op. 63. In 1856, Johannes Brahms took elements from both themes in the unpublished Missa canonica which he wrote as a study in counterpoint with Joseph Joachim. He used the theme, broadened in tempo and shortened in notes, on the text is Agnus Dei, also a call for mercy.  Recording  The motet was recorded, with other motets by Mendelssohn, by the RIAS Kammerchor conducted by Marcus Creed. In 2005, it was recorded by the St John's College Choir Cambridge, conducted by David Hill.

The club was started in 1946, with Bill Powell purchasing the land and working on it in his spare time. It opened to the public and to all races in April of 1948. The club, which is located outside of East Canton, Ohio, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Bill Powell's daughter, Renee Powell who learned to play on Clearview, went on to become the second black woman to play on the LPGA tour.  About  The Clearview Golf Club is currently the only golf course in the United States that was designed, built, managed and owned entirely by African Americans. It is one of 13 black- owned or operated golf courses in the US. The club is located two miles outside of East Canton, Ohio. It is a par-72 course. It has 18 holes and covers around 130 acres of land. The club is named \\"Clearview\\" because Bill Powell, the designer and first owner, wanted a place that \\"would represent his 'clear view' of what the game should be about: access for all.\\" The club is currently managed by Bill's children, Larry Powell and Renee Powell.  History  The Clearview Golf Club was designed by Bill Powell and was begun in East Canton, Ohio in 1946. As an African American, Powell had faced prejudice when attempting to join other golf clubs in the United States, so he chose to build his own. First, Powell tried to get a GI loan, but was turned down. Powell obtained financial support for his effort to build the golf club from two black physicians and from his brother who took out a second mortgage. With this support, he was able to purchase a 78-acre dairy farm. Powell moved his family to a house on the golf course. At the time, he was working as a security guard and in his spare time, he started converting the farm into a golf course. He worked on the course during the day, growing grass and clearing the land by hand while at night, he worked at Timken. He completed the first nine holes by 1948. The club opened in April that same year, with Powell's wife, Marcella, helping out. His young daughter, Renee Powell, began playing golf on the course shortly after it first opened at the age of 3. Renee would go on to become the second black woman to play on the LPGA tour. Once the club was open, it welcomed everyone, regardless of race. The club did experience some problems with vandalism and community hostility, but these did not impair the club's success. A member of the Ku Klux Klan golfed his course, but Powell only told his daughter, Renee, about the incident. Racists called the club the \\"nigger nine.\\" But Powell didn't care. He said, \\"I wanted this to be a place where race didn't matter; where the only thing that matters is the game of golf.\\" Powell expanded the club to eighteen holes in 1978. In 1995, Renee took over as head golf professional at Clearview. Her father, Bill, never saw a profit while running the course. Like her father and her brother, Larry, Renee didn't draw a salary for working at the club. Renovations sponsored by the PGA of America took place in 1999. Clearview Golf Club Historic Sign In 2001, the course was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Also in 2001, the course began to operate as a non-profit under the name, Clearview Legacy Foundation. The foundation, the club and the Ohio Historical Society erected a historical marker on the site in 2001. The club was renovated for free in 2004 by Hurdzan-Fry Golf Course Design. The Hurdzan-Fry renovation helped fix the main drainage system at the course. The drainage system was connected to two ponds on the course. In 2007, civil engineering students from the University of Akron provided drawings and designs to help renovate the golf course. The drawings helped the fundraising drive to raise $1.6 million for capital improvements. In 2009, the club faced problems when Buckeye Industrial Mining was allowed to mine coal 370 feet from the club.

Bibliography  José Antonio Vivó Undabarrena was the Mayor of Olaberría, Deputy of Guipúzcoa and member of the political party named Guipúzcoa Unida. He was born in the locality of Burgos, from Espinosa de los Monteros. He was 49 years old, married and had six children at the time of the murder. = Assassination = On February 6, 1979, at 21:15 hours two hooded members of ETA touched the doorbell of Jose Antonio's house. It was the wife of Jose Antonio who opened the door to the hooded men. These men threatened her and two of the six children, and after plucking the cables from the phone to prevent any telephone communication. They took José Antonio by force. Moments later, his relatives heard several gunshots. Mercedes Galdós Arsuaga, a member of the Urola command, was the author of these shots. He was accompanied by Félix Ramón Gil Ostoaga, also a member of the same unit, who also shot José Antonio. After the gunshots, Jose Antonio fell with a deadly wound into a large puddle of blood. He was transferred by ambulance to San Miguel Clinic in Beasain, where his death was certified. It was proved that his assassins robbed a vehicle by using a gun before committing the attack. The car was a white Seat 124. The owner of this vehicle was kidnapped and tied to a tree in Beasain, where he was abandoned. After the attack, the terrorists ran out and headed for the car, in which they fled in the direction of the road, National 1. The members of the Urola command had monitored the victim for several months before the attack. The leadership of the group authorized this attack after receiving the data from the surveillance. At first, the authorities did not discard the intent of kidnap which ended in murder since the victim showed resistance. Following this attack, the Justice condemned the members of ETA Mercedes Galdós Arsuaga and Félix Ramón Gil Ostoaga. Mercedes Galdós Arsuaga was arrested in 1986 during the police operation that dismantled Nafarroa’s command. Two years later, on April 25, 1988, she was condemned to 29 years in prison under the sentence 20/88, dictated by section 2 of Criminal Chamber of the National Audience. The gunman who participated with Mercedes in the attack shot the victim at the same time, Félix Ramón Gil Ostoaga. Félix Ramón Gil Ostoaga was detained in the French town of Ciboure on October 24, 1989. Sentenced to the same penalties on November 19, 1994, when section 2 of the Criminal Chamber of the National Audience condemned him under sentence 66/94. In the verdict 66/94, both defendants were sentenced to the solidarity payment as compensation to the heirs of José Antonio Vivó. It is imputed the participation of José María Zaldúa Corta in the assassination of Jose Antonio even though he was never condemned in Spain for his crime.

The operation, originally intended to apprehend the Hussein brothers, turned into a four-hour gun battle outside a fortified safehouse which ended with the death of both Hussein brothers, a 14-year-old relative, and a bodyguard. Background In March and April, 2003, a military coalition led by the United States invaded Iraq and overthrew the country's Ba'athist dictatorship under Saddam Hussein. Following the defeat of the Iraqi Army, Saddam and his sons, Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein went into hiding and became wanted fugitives by the occupying Coalition forces. Uday had been the founder and commander of the Fedayeen Saddam, a loyalist paramilitary organization that served as Saddam Hussein's personal guard, while Qusay had been a high-ranking member of the Iraqi Republican Guard. Uday and Qusay Hussein were the ace of hearts and ace of clubs, respectively, in the Coalition's Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. Saddam himself was the ace of spades. A combined $30,000,000 reward for the brothers' capture was posted by Coalition authorities. Assault In July 2003, Coalition troops were notified by a cousin of the brothers that Uday Hussein, Qusay Hussein, Qusay's 14-year-old son Mustapha, and a fourth man described as a bodyguard were hiding in a safehouse in a northern suburb of the Iraqi city of Mosul. A decision was made to send a detachment of U.S. Special Forces troops to apprehend the brothers. At about 10:00 AM on July 22, 2003, eight Special Forces soldiers from Task Force 121, accompanied by 40 infantrymen from the 101st Airborne Division, surrounded the safehouse. A bullhorn was used to order the house's occupants to come out and surrender, but there was no response. Ten minutes later, a team of eight US Special Forces operatives knocked on the door of the house. When no one answered, the soldiers breached the door and entered the house. Inside, the team came under heavy gunfire from the house's defenders, who were armed with AK-47s and had barricaded themselves on the building's second floor. In the ensuing gun battle, three Special Forces soldiers were wounded inside the house. As the entry team attempted to withdraw, the occupants began shooting out the windows, wounding a fourth soldier. The four wounded operatives were evacuated by helicopter as the team retreated from the building and called for backup. After the Special Forces team retreated from the house, soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division and 3/327th Infantry surrounded the safehouse and opened fire with Mk 19 grenade launchers, AT4 rockets, and Humvee-mounted .50-caliber M2 Browning machine guns, and an intense gun battle ensued. By 11:22 AM, over an hour into the firefight, more than 200 reinforcement soldiers had arrived to assist the task force. A soldier from the 101st Airborne Division looks through a Humvee-mounted TOW launcher at the safehouse where Uday and Qusay Hussein barricaded themselves US soldiers fire on the safehouse during the raid Smoke pours from Uday and Qusay Hussein's safehouse during the raid after it was hit by a TOW missile The remains of the safehouse following the battle At 11:45 AM, several Kiowa OH-58D army helicopters and an A-10 Warthog arrived and began firing at the safehouse, destroying a large portion of the building with missiles. Nevertheless, the task force continued to receive heavy gunfire from the house's occupants, who also lobbed grenades from the roof. Unable to neutralize the defenders, the task force initially considered using Apache helicopters to destroy the safehouse, but ruled it out due to concerns over potential civilian casualties. At 1:00 PM, three hours into the operation, ten TOW missiles were fired at the house from Humvee- mounted launchers. The resulting explosion killed both Hussein brothers and their bodyguard, and reduced much of the safehouse to rubble. At 1:21 PM, several American soldiers entered the ruined house to search for survivors. As the team advanced up the stairs to the building's second floor, Qusay's 14-year-old son Mustapha, taking cover in a bedroom, opened fire on the soldiers with an AK-47, but was killed instantly by return fire. Aftermath Following the raid, the bodies of all four occupants were subsequently removed from the house and flown to Baghdad for identification tests. Morticians reconstructed the corpses of Uday and Qusay Hussein, who were identified through DNA testing and dental records. Both men had significantly changed their appearance to avoid detection; Uday had completely shaved his head and Qusay had trimmed his signature beard. Photos of the brothers' corpses were later published by the Department of Defense and shown on TV and in newspapers, generating considerable controversy. US officials announced that the combined $30 million reward for Uday and Qusay Hussein would be paid to the informant who tipped off Coalition authorities. The informant is also alleged to have been the owner of the safehouse where the brothers were killed. Uday, Qusay, and Qusay's son Mustapha were later buried alongside one- another in a cemetery in Tikrit. Qusay's other two sons, Yahya and Yaqub, are presumed to be alive but their whereabouts are unknown.

He was the Administer at the University of Liège, director of the Institute of Astrophysics at the Cointe Observatory, and director of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. Early life Folie was born on December 11, 1833 in Venlo (then in Belgium). He was the oldest of seven children. In 1930 Belgium declared itself independent from The Netherlands and there was a treaty discussion going on to determine the status of the regions. The treaty placed Venlo back in The Netherlands so his father moved to Liège as he was in the military and a captain in the Belgian artillery. In Belgium, his father was put in charge to teach pyrotechnics and artillery advancements to the army. Folie went to college in Liège and on August 13, 1855 Folie earned a mathematics and physics doctorate. His father died young and Folie had to support his mother and 6 siblings. Later life and Bonn He started to teach in 1857 at the University of Liège. While doing this he went to Bonn and started working with Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander in astronomy. He helped in a study of variable stars and with others completed a star catalog of the northern hemisphere. Also, while there, he studied thermodynamics under Rudolf Clausius. He took that training back with him to Liège and started teaching thermodynamics in 1867. On May 5, 1873 Folie married Adalina (born in 1849). Folie and Adalina had 11 children. He is the father of Franz Folie, poet, playwright and Belgian historian who wrote under the alias of Franz Ansell. Folie was the Administer at the University of Liège from 1872 to 1884, it was under his administration that most of the buildings of science and medicine were built. In particular, the Cointe Observatory which held the Institute of Astrophysics. He remained director of the institute until 1893. In 1883, he succeeded Jean-Charles Houzeau as director of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. In 1885 Folie became observatory director in Brussels. Because of the increase in size of Brussels it was no longer a good city to do astronomy and he built an observatory at Uccle. He visited the Bonn observatory several times where he worked on astronomy with Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander and Adalbert Krüger.L.
